insaneparents,ff5xkcs,t1_ff5tvfq,1579613552.0,"Well, I think the problem here is that no solution is cookie cutter. In my case the answer to 'how are they supposed to get to work if the parents won't drive them and refused to give the money to take transportation' is walk. But I lived in a walkable area. It was two and a half miles to work but at 14 I was working. I lied on my working papers to be able to get a job. Took me four years to get out but it 19, I got out.

Commenters come from the place that they know. And some people are unable to imagine anything else. so I can understand why some of them think it's so black and white. Having also lived in the country where public transportation wasn't even an option never even mind walking to a store, I can see a situation where a kid would be stuck without transportation.

That doesn't mean working saving up moving out isn't a viable solution, it just means it's not an  attainable one for that particular person at that moment in that way. Maybe they need to start asking a friend for help or something. Someone at school. Someone at church. Someone that they know will help without reporting back to the parents. It's not easy but there are people like that out there. 

At the end of the day, I wish that none of us had to deal with any of this."

dogs,ff20tkj,t1_ff164v7,1579490777.0,"Dogs don't have hope. Dogs live in the moment. Dogs are very much 'oh this is what we're doing today? Oh this is great!' I fostered dogs for many years privately and for shelters and sometimes time away from the shelter is all a dog needs to reset itself. We would frequently do weekends or days away from the shelter to give dogs time to decompress. It doesn't give them hope. It just gives them a day to enjoy.

Most of them, when they go back to the shelter get just as excited to see their favorite volunteers. The ones that aren't doing well in shelters stay in foster care.

In addition, a lot can be learned during those grace periods. For instance, I had a foster from the humane society who it turned out was terrified of trains. How did we know that? Because I lived 2 miles from train tracks and every time the train passed so the poor girl got the runs and started to shake terribly. Now what's a family supposed to do if they take her home and can't bring her back if they live next to the CSX or Amtrak line? Now you have a terrified dog and a disappointed family.

When I got older, an aunt explained to me that I was always the apple of my father's eye and my mother could never handle it. She was a sick woman and she fucked me up as a result. 

I have no idea what the answer is but I do know your wife is wrong to compete with your daughter. It's very immature, a sign of low self-esteem, and could potentially be damaging to your daughter. Hopefully she talks to a professional and straightens herself out.

SSDI,fcojoix,t1_fcoa09g,1577833920.0,"The first time you appeal an ALJ's decision, typically the ALJ is told to basically review their decision to see where, if anywhere, they were wrong. No new evidence can be presented at that stage. If the decision is upheld, another appeal would go before a new ALJ. If it is done still upheld, you can take it to the federal court although thats not too common. Your case would have to be very strong and your lawyer would have to be able to prove why the previous decisions were incorrect or the judge or judges made grievous errors. I do know one person this happened to and they did get approved at the federal level. 

So the answer is potentially three times. Each time takes longer and longer and is increasingly more expensive because disability attorney's generally take a max of 25% or $6000, whichever is less, only up to the first ALJ hearing level.

Anxiety,fcj7ftu,t1_fcj6kp3,1577679151.0,"No they can't. It's gotten so strict now it's crazy. And my most recent doctor just retired which is why I'm about to see a new doctor. I don't know I will say this when I get the dose just right, I feel no anxiety I just feel normal. But just a teeny tiny bit too much and then all I focus on is the side effect of feeling like I'm going to fall over and then I start to have a panic attack so it's counterproductive. And by teeny tiny bit too much I mean these are not snapping in half perfectly so sometimes I get a little more sometimes I get a little less.

I don't feel drowsy at all just drugged like I'm going to fall over. I keep walking into things. The first week that I took it I definitely couldn't drive. That's not going to work for me, you know? The anxiety is crippling enough. Xanax gave me my life back to an extent and I would expect any anxiety medication that I take to do the same. But the way the Klonopin makes me feel, I can't even drive. so it's taking my away my ability to live in a different way if that makes sense.

Perhaps if they really don't want me on Xanax I can ask for Ativan. now I'm beginning to understand why my doctor in New York who prescribe this for me in the first place said if it ain't broke don't fix it one time when I asked him should I switch? Have I been on this too long? He said does it still work? And I said yes. And he said if it ain't broke, don't fix it. I should have never left that psychiatrist talk me into changing."

Anxiety,fcj5iy0,t1_fcj530t,1577677786.0,"I just don't like change. When the doctor prescribed me Xanax 20 years ago he prescribed it in August of 1999 and I told him I'm never going to take this and he said yeah I know, just fill it. And I finally took one in December of that year. So it's like that. It takes me a very long time to work up the courage to try something but I was so terrified of this ""withdrawal"" they talk about with Xanax that I jumped right to the Klonopin once I got close to running out of Xanax. And I figured there's an adjustment period, sure, but I remember the very first time I took Xanax I didn't feel anything other than calm and I went out to dinner and I had a great time. It quieted my mind and allowed me to enjoy myself. That's all it did. I didn't feel sleepy I didn't feel drugged I just felt normal.

I fully expected to feel the same way with the Klonopin but that's not how it happened. I knew there was no way that I was going to take a half a milligram to start so I snapped in half figuring let me just play it safe. And it was awful from day one. I almost want to go count how many Xanax I have left and see when I can switch back to them but I don't know that this new doctor I'm going to see this week will prescribe them for me so I don't want to create a situation.
