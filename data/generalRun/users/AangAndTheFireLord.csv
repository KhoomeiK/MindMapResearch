nba,fgl671i,t1_fgklz74,1580883375.0,RJ is better than anyone we’ve picked in recent years excluding Porzi.
nba,fgl3yy5,t1_fgl3gj4,1580881267.0,They have value for lesser teams. Even just Capela and a first for Covington is terrible.
worldnews,fgl2hy8,t3_ez2bfq,1580879982.0,This woman even looks like a lizard.
nba,fgl2f84,t1_fgkxdg4,1580879918.0,I was harmed in the making of this troll. My heart almost broke.

NYYankees,fgku5ai,t1_fgj0wx2,1580873664.0,In the case of #3... why would they expand the number of votes? He got in either way so it’s not like the system is broken.
funny,fgktzln,t1_fgkpbfn,1580873562.0,Are you implying that any kids can move 15 or 20 mph?
gaming,fgkcej4,t1_fgkc2zc,1580862308.0,TIL. Thanks :)
gaming,fgk8eoe,t1_fgk71si,1580859712.0,"Not “hard” per say, but certainty more so than today comparatively. 

There used to be more puzzles and mazes, trainers in places you wouldn’t see or at the end of a long road/tunnel/cave, you had to grind Pokémon a bit longer to level them up and couldn’t share XP unless that Pokémon went into battle (made leveling up a Magicarp or Kakuna or low level Pokémon much more difficult)."
worldnews,fgk7ry8,t1_fgk799y,1580859320.0,"It’s entirely situational. Most healthy young adults that are relatively headstrong would end up dying of starvation before they died of anything else. 

But a handicapped boy that can’t move like this? Or someone with a mental disorder or very high anxiety, or someone on medicine to control these things? Yes, it’s quite likely."
FortNiteBR,fggt8zl,t1_fggrgzc,1580769044.0,Do it for the people! We want to know!
movies,fggbszy,t1_fgfw8lr,1580758539.0,Bruh what. I thought 24 sounded bad.
TheLastAirbender,fgffztm,t1_fgf4bux,1580737646.0,"Eh... it’s $20/hour in cash which means no taxes, so it’s more like getting paid $26/hr (or more) on the books. 

OP is talented, but admits that they have a different job and aren’t a full time professional artist, just a hobbiest. Seems about right to me."
sports,fgeuzgn,t1_fgen078,1580711013.0,B is the more important one. Giselle is worth like half a billion herself.
stopdrinking,fgeugxw,t3_exyps7,1580710453.0,"Fuck.. I’ve gained 13 pounds since I stopped drinking. I seem to replace drinking with a lot of eating. 

Good work!"
TheLastAirbender,fgeqwx4,t1_fgeeqkn,1580706943.0,"To anyone that expressed interest in seriously buying one: this means it would cost at least $100. 

$20 for the base bottle. 
$10-15 for shipping (is it more these days??). 
And then about $20/hr for their time and talents (this is assuming that they get efficient at making them and start cranking them out in a little under 4 hours each).


Edit: Forgot to say... AMAZING WORK OP :) I love this a lot and would buy one if I wasn’t such a poor boy. Uncle Iroh is possibly my favorite fictional character of all time."

Fitness,fge57o4,t3_exwffo,1580691637.0,I don’t know what all of these nerds are talking about but all you need to do is take a few shots of whiskey before you head up the mountain and you’ll be fine.
pics,fge4v5u,t1_fge3fqy,1580691419.0,Yeah this would make it appear that the oceans are hundreds of miles deep. They are not.

LifeProTips,fgdpxh6,t1_fgdmv21,1580685260.0,I have a different belief system than most people. I had a dream where Gallowboob told me that Reddit karma directly determines if you go to heaven or hell after you die. So you better believe I care.
