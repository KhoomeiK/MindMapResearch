TooAfraidToAsk,ff6f3xq,t1_ff69dnq,1579625825.0,"It’s really hard not to- as someone said before, these parents are also likely victims of past trauma and abuse. We live though in a time and society where as adults we can make our own decisions to get the help we need especially if we’ve experienced trauma in our youth. I often tell parents that if they are not getting the help they need to heal, how will they help their own child heal? Some become defensive and some just nod but never follow through. It can be frustrating."

PoliticalHumor,ff62kw7,t3_eruk89,1579617539.0,Hmm I thought at this time it was republicans that were for the civil rights act and the dems who weren’t? I know there was at one point a shift with republican and dems platform on this and similar issues.

ADHD,ff5it9v,t3_erqvx2,1579594839.0,Hi school psychologist here. When I test my students to see if they’re dyslexic (and say they already have an ADHD diagnosis) sometimes it difficult to tease out the dyslexia. They often have great phonemic awareness and have okay word reading skills (something people with dyslexia struggle with) but often they have to read and re-read a passage because their inattention is impacting their comprehension. Sometimes lack of focus also impacts word reading and putting everything together in a way that makes sense.
TooAfraidToAsk,ff5ijx5,t3_erqw7u,1579594492.0,"I’m a school psychologist. Because of my training and what I’ve learned through experience, it’s much harder for me to criticize or judge a client harshly because I know it’s not a black and white situation. There are typically underlying issues that lead to certain behaviors so judging someone on something that’s not their fault would be pointless. I have a harder time when dealing with parents of children who are supposed to care and be cautious in raising their kids when often they are the reason their kid is struggling."
