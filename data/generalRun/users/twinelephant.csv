It's just so normalized and I notice people choose to drink with enablers, so they really do have a skewed perception of their own habits. 

Just know that you are indeed limiting your pool oof potential candidates, but not by that much. You're really choosing quality over quantity here. As far as meeting them, just start doing as many activities as you can that interest you. You can also go to a bar to see live music and not drink.

But set goals. If you set aside $150 from every paycheck and put it into high yield savings, that will come to $100k once you're my age, which can be a down payment on a house or condo in NYC. Work while you travel, save up enough to get to the next place, then do it again. Set lofty yet attainable goals and accomplish them. You can do it."

It's turning into a fun college town and there are a lot of outdoor activities, like hiking, mountain biking, rafting, snowboarding, all close by. It's like a little Colorado.

RealEstate,fce43fo,t1_fcbhdp7,1577616744.0,"Sorry, I was asking somewhat ironically. An FHA at 3.5% would be very attainable for many people, especially at $135k. Where I live, there is a very small inventory and high demand, so even a fixer is over $250k, and $300k+ is considered affordable."
RealEstate,fcbbktz,t1_fcayvzd,1577584863.0,"How does a 22 year old by a house?

Edit: 

I know how a 22 year old can buy a house with under $10k down using an FHA, USDA, or other subsidized loan, particularly in a location with lower demand. I'm a firm believer that homeownership is easier than one thinks, and I'm a real estate agent to boot and can guide buyers to assistance or savings strategies to make homeownership a reality. 

I was speaking from my own subjective and anecdotal experience, where rent — whether two bedroom or one — is generally $1200/mo plus utilities, and entry level houses start around $300k. The combo makes it very difficult for young homebuyers, and nearly eliminates FHA loans as a viable option once PMI, taxes, upkeep, and interest are added. 

In other words, my region is not conducive to homeownership at a young age. Everyone's market is unique. Your results may vary."

Edit,: I also once worked for an amateur mover.

He was a generally bad guy, by his ineptitude, but also just fucked in the head and I believe a bad person...
