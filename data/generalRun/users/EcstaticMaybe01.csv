I know this is hyperbole but honestly, it depends on how you define a mass shooting. You can either define it as any violence involving a gun where more that one person is hurt (I mean, some of the ""Mass Shootings"" listed on Wikipedia are drive-bys likely caused by gang violence.

>  
>**Answer:** Your problem is not at all an uncommon one. However, it does require careful attention. The type of feeling that you have toward boys is probably not an innate tendency, but something that has been culturally acquired. Your reasons for adopting this habit have now been consciously suppressed or unconsciously repressed. Therefore, it is necessary to deal with this problem by getting back to some of the experiences and circumstances that lead to the habit. In order to do this I would suggest that you see a good psychiatrist who can assist you in bringing to the forefront of conscience all of those experiences and circumstances that lead to the habit. You are already on the right road toward a solution, since you honestly recognize the problem and have a desire to solve it.
