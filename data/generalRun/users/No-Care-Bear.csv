ScienceParents,fff4rmx,t1_ffeu8xp,1579875677.0,Currently fighting with my inlaws over the importance of the flu shot and Tdap booster before they meet my unborn son. They moved out of the country and said they can’t get them where they are. Claiming I’m overreacting and the baby won’t be in any danger if they don’t get them. Husband is torn between asking them to stay in a hotel until they get their shots or telling them not to bother coming at all.
PublicFreakout,ff8xxq1,t1_ff8swmd,1579699658.0,I was holding it together until I made the mistake of turning on the sound. The lady’s shaking voice trying to urge Sugar back did me in. Thankfully that man was there to save him!

Also, I pray you and your loved ones remained safe and were minimally affected by the devastating fires!!"

assholedesign,ff5l5dq,t3_errky2,1579598187.0,I’m more concerned with the prison cell bars. At least you still have the option to break the window and jump.
GetMotivated,ff5krok,t1_ff5iezc,1579597624.0,Asking the important questions!
woahdude,ff4urra,t3_ern3xr,1579572932.0,I can’t help but think it would be chilly without anything to keep the warm air in.
BeAmazed,fevta01,t3_eqp6x7,1579401203.0,"Lived just south of the Arctic circle for a year. The nearly 24 hours of sunlight was a lot more difficult to get used to than the nearly 24 hours of darkness!! Nothing prepares you for closing out a bar at 2am to be greeted by sunlight, not to mention local children outside playing at all hours of the night. Blackout curtains were our best friends (and keeping up a daily schedule on closing them about an hour before bed)."
AskReddit,feu0ess,t1_fetwa0g,1579381879.0,"I’m sure he is now, or at least enough for the two of us! He left this week for training and won’t be home till March. Jill will be very busy these next few weeks"
AskReddit,fetvo97,t1_fetrbou,1579380541.0,I guess I’m one of the unlucky ones who loses it at the end. Thankfully my husband has stepped up to the challenge!

AskReddit,fetp4up,t1_fetnyzd,1579377879.0,"I’ve heard many women do have an increased sex drive, and I experienced this until a few weeks ago. Unfortunately it took a nose dive despite my husband’s best efforts."
AskReddit,fetoq3r,t1_fetdydq,1579377719.0,Sorry to hear about the contractions. Hopefully you have a quick and easy delivery! Good luck with your last few weeks and congrats on the little one!!
AskReddit,fesfjer,t1_fesd2w4,1579364616.0,"Glad I’m not the only one, it’s so disgruntling. We’ve been trying everything, but I think there’s a mental block at play for me. Good luck with the last few weeks and congrats on your new family member!!"
aww,fesc3bp,t1_fes02ci,1579363728.0,"Same to you! Unfortunately people suck sometimes, but I’ve learned most people are good/have good intentions. Don’t let the ugly ones get you down!"
aww,ferhy4u,t1_feqw437,1579354112.0,"Nothing wrong with that opinion! I agree they aren’t equivalent to human children. However, I’m a huge animal lover and am more affectionate than some others when it comes to animals (especially dogs)."
AskReddit,feqdjkj,t3_eqe2it,1579340482.0,Being 31 weeks pregnant has really killed my sex drive
aww,feq6igk,t1_fepjh6x,1579338214.0,"It would be interesting to see how or why some animals react a certain way. If there is a correlation between the type of animal, breed, sex (fixed vs not), etc. Many of our friends are also pregnant or recently gave birth. Some have reported changes in their animals’ affection, including a cat who now sleeps on our friend’s chest."
aww,feq55ha,t1_fepir8k,1579337746.0,"Oops, I can see how that could happen!"
aww,feq4nq7,t1_fepzfu2,1579337658.0,A phrase used to mean dog (or could be used for any furry pet)
aww,fepciwx,t3_eq9wl8,1579317169.0,"Our little girl (she even has similar markings to your fur baby) has been my shadow since I was about 8-10 weeks. Currently 31 weeks and our big boy has started to follow me around more too. They’re constantly cuddling on me, and trying to be as close to my belly as I’ll allow them. It’s really neat how animals are able to sense these things and how they react is incredibly sweet!!

Congratulations to your sister and your family’s newest addition! Nieces and nephews are great!!"

pics,feigdvi,t1_feig1vx,1579137910.0,I’m currently 31 weeks pregnant with my husband and my first child. I think the hormones made him sending this to me even more special!
LifeProTips,fegosvq,t3_ep1zjv,1579098968.0,"Had a boss who started all meetings saying, “I want to respect everybody’s time and am going to review a few items to ensure everybody is comfortable while we’re here.” She’d then welcome everybody to grab refreshments as needed throughout the meeting and pointed me out for anything that may run low, then gave directions to the restrooms down the hall and always ended by asking everybody to please leave the room if they needed to take a call. It allows a cushion of time for stragglers without them missing anything, but also shows everybody their time is important."
IdiotsInCars,feepiug,t1_feemt4t,1579038505.0,"You can say that again! Recently moved back to NC from Colorado. We have an older dog we didn’t want to stress out through flying and decided to drive the whole way. My husband drove the Penske and my pregnant self followed with the dogs. We broke up the 24 hours into 3 days, but it was ridiculously long!"

ShitMomGroupsSay,fdq70rh,t3_emph68,1578657593.0,"As somebody who is currently pregnant with my first child, pro-lifers can go suck an exhaust pipe! Having kids is a choice and it’s not the right one for everyone. I am excited to be a mom in a few short weeks, but pregnancy was difficult and I’m sure motherhood will have its own challenges. Isn’t being a feminist about having the ability to decide how to live your best life and not being discriminated against, especially by OTHER WOMEN?!?  We all need to stop tearing people down because they live their lives differently than our own and celebrate our differences!"
