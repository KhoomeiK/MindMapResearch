BanPitBulls,ffh2rnh,t1_ffedakz,1579921550.0,Oh my god I’m at a loss for words at how amazing this is. I’m saving it forever
HumansBeingBros,feteexi,t1_fetc24v,1579374564.0,"Hey I just started working at one in a small town. Our register computer beeps, you print the order on receipt paper. It lists the sandwich type, bread type and size first, then has a list of all wanted toppings, toasted or untoasted.....and that’s pretty much it. Really hard to mess up, but maybe other subways have something different. Ours doesn’t get much traffic."
BanPitBulls,fee1jsi,t1_fee1gnk,1579024468.0,Cue the true story of a family getting mauled by trying to put a Christmas sweater on one!!!
BanPitBulls,fee12zr,t1_fee0a8i,1579024183.0,"I have been patiently writing down every argument I get and making a proven counterpoint back for each one, but I just keep getting that. “I don’t care. I know this one pit and it’s the best ever”. They just. Don’t. Care.

How can you see the trail of murder from this breed and not care? It’s disgusting"
BanPitBulls,fedz30e,t3_eomxdy,1579022919.0,My fiancé and my sisters keep using this against me. I just don’t even talk about pits with them anymore and it pisses me off to no end.
BanPitBulls,fedyyfz,t1_fedr8c0,1579022844.0,On the packaging?! Fuck that. Fire the marketing team. Why would you not display a breed that is a shedding machine? Plus I don’t fucking care how you believe Cujo is “loving” rescued good boi.... jfc
corgi,fedvsxm,t1_fedvhbg,1579020947.0,"She does growl when she hears mysterious noises outside, but then it’s followed up by her bark - which literally sounds like a turkey screaming, so no one can take it seriously lol

It’s almost embarrassing, when she barks at the dog park people start saying “what IS that?”... it’s like she’s stuck in puberty with her voice cracking."
adorableoldpeople,feduf1f,t3_eogr5c,1579020114.0,She looks amazing for her age and BADASS overall.
corgi,fedu7pt,t1_fedu5ox,1579019989.0,Haha exactly!
corgi,fedu28f,t1_fedtpkj,1579019897.0,"I’ve heard that some are, but personally, mine is nothing but cuddles and silliness... she does bark at cars. That’s about it."
dankvideos,fece8wu,t3_eo5tyu,1578971829.0,“IM GONNA FUCK YOU” lmaoooo
badparents,fe3uwqp,t1_fe3ud3z,1578853138.0,"Well good for you for keeping up with it. It will be a habit that will help you through life. I think the list is mostly reasonable - the thing that bothers me more is how it’s written. All the little notes about what will happen if you don’t do them, and how you have to do them FIRST thing. I had a lot of chores sometimes, but I just had to make sure they were done by the end of the day...

Anyway, if you’re not miserable then it’s a decent list!"
badparents,fe3u2dk,t3_enp4rd,1578852877.0,"I don’t think the chores are evenly split (which I understand is because of age difference probably, but jeez, that’s a lot for J)

I don’t like the way the list is written with aggressive wording. Quite a few of those things do NOT need to be done every day. And I don’t like that your dad and his girlfriend don’t do any of them while you are gone. 
This is a normal chore list, kind of, but for normal circumstances- which you don’t have. So yeah, I think it’s bad/lazy parenting."
antiMLM,fd5gjgj,t3_ejyglp,1578177377.0,"I only recently got my older sister “back”. She was sucked into doterra and it was alllllllllll she talked about.  She even went to their conventions in other states. I started dreading her calls. I joined her for a few months, but the hun FB group talks sickened me. I got into many arguments with them. 

They’re all the same... they just find ways to manipulate and prey on others. It’s embarrassing. Luckily she’s done with it, but she did make a decent amount of money at first. It fizzled and she couldn’t take the way her upline talked anymore."
iamatotalpieceofshit,fd536gm,t3_ejxsh4,1578173765.0,"Oh my god I’m so happy this had a good ending... what a cunt, my chest physically hurt seeing that poor dog get pushed away by her. I hope she shits splintered wood for the rest of her life."
MadeMeSmile,fc1yf7e,t1_fc1mcqc,1577333637.0,"Thank you for this - so important. My older sister wanted a kid so bad, but after all the years, miscarriages and money on fertility procedures, she came to peace with it isn’t happening. Yes, I know adoption is an option but it’s a road they weren’t really able to take after everything else. Now they are happy being themselves and just adopted a second dog."
