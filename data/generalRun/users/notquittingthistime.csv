FundieSnark,fev33gq,t3_eqftp8,1579392607.0,"What I think happens:

Now that she's an adult (and not off on her own), Nurie is being brought into the family business, i.e. boosting their brand.  Jill comes to her and says ""I think we need a post like this today . . . our grateful daughter expressing how grateful she is to her precious parents for raising her in the Lord.  Don't forget to mention how graceful we are to the unlovely.""  Nurie gets to go to bed eventually, and Jill makes a few edits and posts the thing while she's sitting up late for a Plexus-fueled social media binge.

No way Nurie has posting privileges, or the password.  But I do buy that her mother told her to write this and stood over her shoulder."
fatlogic,fegsvtv,t3_eor15q,1579101768.0,"I just keep thinking about how many people I know who are a little bit to fairly overweight, a bit depressed, don't make great lifestyle choices particularly around not getting a lot of movement; and have ended up being diagnosed with fibromyalgia, at which point they\* give up because they just have a condition that makes them be in pain, so they can't exercise, so they can't tolerate certain foods, so so so.  It's just sad.  Sometimes ""assume it can't be my weight or my choices"" leads to a diagnosis of last resort that doesn't serve them.

\*not everyone diagnosed with fibromyalgia, but it's the common response in this group"

FundieSnark,fe9lp8e,t3_enhfuj,1578939213.0,"I honestly think it's all very simple.

\-Jill is not very bright, thoroughly ignorant, knows nothing about child development, and thanks to the Pearls et al. she thinks little babies can be rebellious.

\-Jill very simply has no idea how much food children need, and when her little babies cry or are cranky she thinks they need to be disciplined.  Not that they are hungry.  Eventually, their stomachs get used to insufficient food and they stop crying.

\-She just doesn't have a clue how much food their growing bodies actually require, and they don't complain because they're too used to being underfed."

They're not getting it (or anything else) as a regular supplement; they're getting an occasional 1 in 12 turn at her leavings."

FundieSnark,fdkvw1m,t3_el7fn8,1578512242.0,"The Bible says you have to teach your children to love the Lord, and teach them wisdom.  Not obedience.  Wisdom.  So when they grow up they make good decisions on their own.  Even thousands of years ago they understood your job was to make your kids functional adults someday."
