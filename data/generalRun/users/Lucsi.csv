GetMotivated,fcmv4xp,t1_fcmqtfg,1577793730.0,Thank you. Your comment means a lot to me. <3
GetMotivated,fcmsvmh,t1_fcmr9bq,1577790627.0,"Yeah I get what you mean. I honestly think that if I hadn't been the one to start the conversation that we'd still be ""Together"" now, mostly for her (in my opinion irrational) fear of me leaving her alone with the kid, or up shit creek financially.

I do think that when handled correctly conflict is a positive driving force in any relationship though, and that by avoiding the subject you're not really avoiding the conflict, just delaying things until they bubble over and are probably worse."
GetMotivated,fcmots2,t1_fcmojlr,1577784826.0,"It's a fair observation. 

The reality is that even though we ""officially"" broke up a couple of months ago, what we had for the months preceding that was the husk of a relationship, and we were like two ships passing in the night most of the time at home - we'd been in trouble for months before we had the conversation that led to us separating.

As for the date itself - it's more of a ""Next step"" thing for me that I feel I have to face. I'm not sure how I feel about it myself, but I do know it's something I have to do as part of the process of moving on with my life."
GetMotivated,fcmoa8r,t1_fcmnlmd,1577784060.0,"I'll try to as best I can, although there's probably things that she didn't tell me.

Firstly, there are definitely things I have to accept responsibility for, especially with regards to pulling my weight around the house and with our son. I don't think I'm a ""Bad"" father per se and I have a great relationship with my boy, but it's an undeniable truth that she has done most of the heavy lifting with regards to family and home life since he was born. One of the things that we spoke about was how me moving out and having to take sole responsibility for maintaining a house and keeping our son alive for 3/4  days per week might be really good for both of us.

Other than that, the rest is really difficult to quantify. We were originally living in a country which neither of us were from, and this meant that there was very little family support for raising our son. This is something which I think can easily be taken for granted when it's just there, but us wanting to have a night out together was a logistical nightmare to find babysitters etc. This improved when we moved back to her home country, but by then it was too little, too late.

Like I said in my oriignal post, there wasn't really any huge event which caused our break-up - it was definitely a death-by-a-thousand-cuts scenario. If I have one criticism of my ex it's that she wasn't anywhere near as communicative with me as she should have been. I do feel that if she was up-front in talking to me about her concerns earlier we could have been a bit more proactive in addressing them before they became as big as they were."

I'm glad it made you feel better - if you need to bend the ear of someone feel free to drop me a PM for a chat. :)"
GetMotivated,fcmnrxd,t1_fcmkpxc,1577783349.0,"""So well"" is a bit of a stretch. I definitely think it was the right decision for both of us, but we wouldn't be human if there wasn't some lingering doubt or fear for what the future holds. I'm absolutely terrified of this date I'm going on next week for example - my first in 13 years!

The most important thing for us was to not have a breakup that led to the kid being torn between the two of us. We've still committed to attending ""Family"" events together and are splitting custodial/financial responsibilities as it relates to him 50/50."
GetMotivated,fcmnkk3,t1_fcmlw7f,1577783061.0,We actually weren't married. Neither of us believed in marriage and didn't feel that it added anything to what we had. Hindsight is 20-20 of course but it probably made our decision a lot easier in the end.
GetMotivated,fcmgxio,t1_fcm0aun,1577774842.0,"I'm gonna chime in as someone who was until very recently with that person. We were together for 13 years, had a kid together, and for me the sun rose and set with her - she was my world.

It was clear that towards the end of our relationship that she wasn't happy with me. She would avoid spending time with me, shy away from anything approaching intimacy, and we couldn't even hold a conversation together. We weren't fighting and neither of us had done anything wrong or bad, but it was clear that something wasn't right.

Couple of months ago I pulled her aside and asked her how she wanted to move forward, and she confirmed what I think I knew - that our time together as a couple was over. We had a good, long talk - easily the best we'd had for a couple of years - hugged it out and started working on the details of me moving out and us raising our son together as friends.

As sad as I initially was that things were over, this feeling evaporated when I saw her the next day. She had a spring in her step, was more lively in everyday tasks, and was more friendly and talkative to me than she had been in months. More than anything I was mad at myself for trying to plod on with the status quo in an attempt to make myself feel better when the sheer effort of pretending everything was okay was clearly killing her inside.

Fast forward two months on - I'm moving out into my new place in a couple of weeks, our little boy understands it all and is excited to get to decorate his new room in my place like Minecraft, I have a date next week and she's planned a trip away with her friends - her first since our son was born 7 years ago. But more than anything I feel better in myself because the mother of my child is happy again.

Not sure if this helps, but let me reassure you - your partner probably knows that you're already not happy, and if they're like me and knew that they were the cause then they'd be more than happy to step aside and let you get on with your life."

movies,fc2m35q,t1_fc2l9cz,1577366659.0,I can't believe you've done this.
