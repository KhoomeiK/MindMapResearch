yugioh,feqhnj2,t1_feq4e1a,1579342049.0,"I don't think YataBLS is entirely wrong with his assertion.

The Pendulums mechanic was incredibly overpowered when it was released:

* The mechanic allowed you to summon monsters from your hand with little cost
* The mechanic allowed you to summon pendulum monsters from your extra deck with almost zero cost (other than your monster dying).
* Monsters in the pendulum zone had effects that allowed them to be destroyed for benefit
* The pendulum mechanic (as I remember) didn't have a hard once-per-turn limit.  Meaning that if you setup your pendulum scale 'again' you could potentially special summon monsters from your hand or extra deck a 2nd time during your turn.
* Did I mention that Pendulum monsters were both 'spell' and 'monster' cards.  With effects that generally benefited whatever it was you were doing.
* This doesn't take into account basic things like monster type, level, the monster effect itself, the monsters stats, etc.

It was an overpowered mechanic when it was released.  One that, in all honesty, had a negative impact on the game as a whole.  It pushed the power level of non-pendulum monsters/decks to absurd heights.  It made special summoning all monsters from your deck the norm.  And, in my personal opinion, limited most decks strategies to:

""Special summon monsters from hand, special summon monster from deck, summon monster from extra deck, rince and repeat.""

I hope this is a sign that Konami is attempting to fix parts of the game that aren't working.  And that we'll see other mechanics other than Pendulum Summoning in the future.  The cynic in me thinks this is so the current T1 decks do not compete with whatever Konami has planned.  But the optimist in me feels this can only be helpful to the game in the long term."

In truth, part of it may even be that I'm just not understanding the configuration side completely.  Which is why I'm reading 20 different docs on Oath, Azure, etc.

For us, it's simply leveraging Azure AD instead of on-premise AD.  We already use Okta + the Okta AD Sync.  And our users already enjoy that experience.  Plus corporate-mandated we move everything to the cloud.  So the idea is to leverage Azure AD for identity + Okta for SSO...

And this is where the trouble starts.  Unlike the On-Premise Windows Server + Okta/AD Sync agent there doesn't appear to be anything out-of-the-box that sync's Azure AD to Okta.  Which is fine, it just means I need to see what my options are for syncing Azure AD with Okta.

Just doesn't seem like there's a lot of documentation on how to do this.  Even Okta and Microsoft seem to shy away from outright stating how to do this since both are competing products in the SSO space."

""A soldier shall not die until he has given meaning to his life.""

The image the creator showed at the end was Levi holding his and Historia's child.  Saying, ""We're free.""

The memory of Historia crying was Eren rejecting her.  Choosing to go accross the sea instead of staying with her.  My guess is that Levi filled the hole (so to speak) that Eren left behind.

It makes sense:

- At this point, Eren wants to take away everyone's freedoms.

- If what Eren said about Mikasa is true, then the same is true for Levi.  He's a slave to the royal family... so him being free of this bloody curse works.

- This makes Levi, symbolically, both Baldur from Norse mythology.  And 1 of the last two to survive Ragnarok.  Levi will rise to take Eren out for all he's done.  And from the ashes he and Historia will stand alone with there child.  And try to figure out what to do with the mess Eren left behind.

- This, symbolically, makes Eren both Loki and Jörmungandr.  And, in some ways, you could argue that Ymir is Eren's wife.  And the titans in the wall are Loki's children.
