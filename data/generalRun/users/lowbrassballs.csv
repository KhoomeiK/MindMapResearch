This article whines about women not doing all these things for men and that's the reason why things are shearing apart. Women are not demanding shit en masse. That's men's self reported, biased, misogynistic projection to explain to themselves why women reject them. Men are the ones demanding women work and be their mother, sex toy and nanny, pouting when when don't put out enough.

Men are a burden to everyone because they don't think about anything but their wants, historically entitled and reeling from slight changes to the servitude dynamic they learned from their fathers. They want a servant-sex toy and rather than develop social skills and treat women how they want to be treated, they piecemeal buy disparate experiences to simulate relationships rather than actually develop them. *Look at yourself* and if you wouldn't be friends or lovers with you and how you treat others, then fix it. Jesus, men need to grow up or get out."

Tons of school time is set for this. It's to calm the beyond wealthy students that attend these schools from experiencing any stress stemming from their consistent lack of coping or academic skills. Faux-Mindfulness is one of a litany of consequence-avoidance tools that the rich buy to defer outcomes. Without accountability and discipline, which are very hard to institute on power classes, letting go as a response leads to stagnation. Why improve when you can meditate your perception of personal responsibility into depersonalized nihilism where whatever consequences of your actions are mere passing thoughts to be let go?

Tldr: mindfulness is the new religion of nihilism to further subdue the poor and comfort the rich."
