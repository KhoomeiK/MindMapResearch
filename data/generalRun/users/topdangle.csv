Luffy has literally made this mistake already in Wano, rushing in and saving the starving town in Wano but completely revealing himself and his crew, causing Kaido to almost kill all of them and knock Luffy out in one hit. He also almost died getting poisoned if not for Chopper.

OnePiece,ffw8hfa,t3_evjx6r,1580289447.0,"I'm going to go against the grain and say Oden really is a fool and not just perceived as one, but in the same way Luffy is a fool. They both have too much pride and trust, which bites them in the ass.

Oden turned down an offer that could've saved his whole country a few chapters back. With either Yonko backing him Wano may have been retaken easily, but not wanting to burden his friends he decided Wano could take care of itself even though he had no idea what he was dealing with. If he had just checked in on his country for a few days instead of running back to adventure it would've changed history.

He trusts Orochi to hold up his end of the 5 year bargain, which is a level of naive that only Zoro has matched when he trusted Helmeppo. The situation is almost identical to Helmeppo scamming Zoro, and Zoro also would've been killed like Oden if Luffy didn't show up through sheer luck. Oden also wasn't preparing anything behind the scenes or developing an information network, as seen by Hyogoro's family getting killed and Oden only finding out about it second hand from Orochi.

Oden isn't a bad guy but I'd say his title is accurate. As the rightful Lord of Wano he acted like a heroic fool trying to save country himself, and Kinemon seems to also figure Oden for a fool as he is doing the exact opposite of Oden by begging for support from every ally he can find, including pirates like the SHs.

tl;dr Oden is Vivi before she meets Crocodile, and Kinemon is Vivi after Luffy slaps some sense into her and tells her she needs to risk all of their lives to win."

OnePiece,ffs34a0,t1_ffqmn9l,1580171956.0,"I think you're caught up on Monet being weak, even though shes shown as quite strong. She almost caught Luffy off guard and Luffy was struggling to break her snow. The reason Zoro made her an easy win was because he intimidated her, making her lose control of her powers, something that Luffy and Tashigi aren't good at doing. From what we saw she was pretty strong, so I don't think it's fair to say Tashigi was only fanservice just because she lost to someone who gave base Luffy a run for his money. Tashigi also trash talks Zoro even after seeing Zoro slice Monet clean in half; Tashigi clearly has balls of steel.

Tashigi put her money where her mouth was and tried to beat Monet, one of Mingo's respected fighters. To me that takes balls even if she lost. You can't win them all, especially in the New World.

Also I never liked ""power rankings"" to begin with. If power ranks were all that mattered then the manga would've ended at Alabasta with Crocodile. I don't think the manga has ever been about power with the exception of the Yonko/Admiral class, who have enough power to rule the world, and Tashigi was never trying to be PK/WSS level like Luffy and Zoro."

Just this arc Luffy got knocked out in one hit by Kaido after crying and vowing to protect his friends after Ace died. Losing after vowing to get stronger isn't unique to Tashigi.

If you go back pre-timeskip, the Strawhat team were way out of Tashigi's league. Now post-timeskip she has CoA haki when only 4 people on the SH crew have CoA haki, and all 4 of them are the crew's strongest fighters.

OnePiece,ffpaz8u,t3_eugcni,1580090551.0,"It would make Kuina's death pretty redundant if an exact clone appeared and also happened to achieve her dream of competing with Zoro.

Luffy/Zoro/Sanji are somewhere within the top 100 strongest people in the entire world at this point, why is it embarrassing that Tashigi isn't their equal? She was weaker than Zoro when they met and is still weaker. That sounds consistent to me, like how Koby is still weaker than Luffy even though hes way stronger than before. Zoro also trained with Mihawk during the time skip, how would her becoming his equal make any sense story wise?

World's strongest is an arbitrary title anyway. How is Big Mom not the world's strongest swordswoman? She uses a sword and fights Kaido for fun. Shanks is another swordsman Yonko, yet Mihawk is WSS. Nobody really knows what means to be the strongest yet."

For whatever reason these types tend to have the highest likelihood of going bankrupt, maybe because the effort to wealth ratio wasn't there to keep them responsible."
gifs,ff1znzb,t1_ff1r2ja,1579489941.0,"Yes but that argument is equally as silly as you'd be left with twig armed super heroes blasting warriors to bits with their finger nails. The audience needs even a little bit to help suspend their disbelief, and some muscle is good enough."
gifs,ff1zfqx,t1_ff1fqit,1579489774.0,"I get what you're saying but in reality bulk decays at a much slower rate than vascular performance. Proper caloric intake will keep you quite strong if you've built a base of muscle even without proper maintenance.

Realistically in your comparison they should be super sluggish compared to their peak, but still have substantial muscular strength. So like, maybe superman takes .01 seconds to fly around the world instead of .0001 seconds, but he'd still be pretty buff."
OnePiece,ff1w0ei,t1_ff1lk21,1579487442.0,"O-Toko's part is already pretty huge in the story, being the intro to the effect of bad SMILE and the daughter of Yasuie. Shes also the one that coincidentally reunites Zoro and Sanji."
OnePiece,ff1oecg,t1_ff13g6o,1579482602.0,"Maybe the real Hiyori was left and aged with time, raised by Kawamatsu, while Toki jumped to the current timeline. 

Now there's two ""Hiyoris,"" the real one raised by Kawamatsu, and Toki the one who just happens to be handing over Oden's prized weapons to Zoro before disappearing.

This would work with the whole ""Hiyori is the backstabber"" conspiracy theory considering offering up Enma to Zoro kind of ruined that theory a while back, but if it was Toki that offered it rather then Hiyori then she'd still be a candidate for the backstabber."

MrRobot,ff1gy6q,t1_fez3feu,1579479057.0,"Leon had no hate in his heart bro, that's the whole point of the seinfeld references (the show about nothing). There was nothing to him and he just executed as needed for whiterose. There was definitely deep hatred (not for Elliot) within Vera."
MrRobot,ff1gh7b,t1_feypnmk,1579478849.0,"I think some people get caught up by the charisma. Hes a great actor and it makes you want to cheer for him, meanwhile all he does is fucked up shit the entire show."
MrRobot,ff1g5mj,t1_feygnb9,1579478701.0,"Point is that hes the perpetrator, though. He was born by the cycle and continues the cycle. It's not black and white but he's also not really meant to be sympathetic.

Elliot is the literal hero for breaking out of the cycle, including for himself."
MrRobot,ff19hau,t3_er0ren,1579476533.0,"If you assume this was all planned out by season 1 writing wise, mastermind had already taken over Elliot months before the show started and before Darlene returns into his life as suggested by her dialogue early on and his complete unrealization of her as his sister. Then you'd have to assume the gaps memory/execution are due to his own psychotic breaks between personalities, such as when Mr Robot protects him from the ""realities"" of his life and creates new gaps. At this point Mastermind is the one leading the entire operation while Mr Robot is just there to protect him/keep him sane.

If you assume it was retconned to fit the new narrative of many Elliots instead of Mr Robot vs Elliot, it makes more sense with fewer plot holes as you're kind of forced to accept that they're different stories written under production limitations.

Personally I think Sam was trying to go for a ""compartmentalization"" metaphor, as its one of the best methods of opsec in computer science. Elliot essentially tried to keep himself safe by breaking his own psyche into bits (mother, father, youth, mastermind, ""real"" Elliot). ***He never had a complete memory because he never intended to give himself his complete memory***. It's a bit of a stretch and didn't flesh out perfectly."

OnePiece,feyu00k,t1_feytn86,1579450495.0,"But that's my point, we only see Croc and Lucci head out into scenarios where they ""might"" get stronger, and we see Enel in a scenario where he's already the strongest against aliens.
