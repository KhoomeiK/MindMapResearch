getdisciplined,ffc2xjl,t3_esgh84,1579790219.0,"Discipline isn't easy. Personally I have like a voice in my head that's a ""coach"" and I just listen to it. We always know what we have to do, but we don't always do it because it's very easy to ignore that voice in your head telling you to just do it. You have to give it importance by listening to it. Over time it gets easier. That's the difference between motivation (the early excitement) and discipline."
getdisciplined,ffc2d80,t3_eslsam,1579789805.0,"Get off social media. 

Just focus on school and your longer term goal of moving away. Stay on track for that. 

Other than that, keep going to therapy, somewhere along the way you'll probably get past these feelings. 

It's pretty basic really, you don't have to hate these people and you don't have to love them. You can just let them go. It's not revenge, it's not some victory or defeat, it's just you living your life, focused on your goals, which no longer involve them.

Its easier said than done, but with therapy to help you sort through the emotions you should be fine."
getdisciplined,ffbx73l,t1_ffbbr9o,1579785687.0,This guy speaks the truth. Been working construction over a decade. Getting in shape required specific effort and balancing what is being worked. Doing labor can often leave you performing weird moves in odd positions. It's honestly better for you to get in shape and THEN go into some sort of physical labor job.
wholesomebpt,ff34uqm,t3_ereezo,1579533715.0,"Cute but still subscribed to the idea that academic achievement and material wealth are the metrics for achievement even if we don't tie ourselves down to a timeline. 

Garbage."
socialanxiety,ferv144,t3_eq9aem,1579358601.0,"The hardest to swallow pill:

Letting your social anxiety dictate your comfort and not confronting it and overcoming it in a safe, controlled environment leaves you as a socially crippled adult who can't handle their own anxiety."
relationship_advice,fefv7g5,t3_eop40o,1579066259.0,"There's not much you can do besides be supportive. Your bf is gonna have to grow a thicker skin or date someone else. 5'7 to 6'2 is a huge difference so there's all sorts of ways he can be insecure, but it's on him to deal with those feelings. Your place is to be supportive and hopefully this isn't a relationship killer, but it very well could be. 

Try not to judge his family too harshly, this isn't specific to his family, there's social norms at play here too. Masculinity and being bigger and tougher and all that come into play. It's just a problem you'll have to deal with unless you find a larger man to be with or decide you don't give a hoot. That's ultimately all you can do on your end."

PrequelMemes,fdagi4q,t1_fdabso7,1578245815.0,"That's exactly who speaks for us. I'm also a star wars fan, but that contingent exists and they definitely bullied that kid. I've always been the kind to enjoy the movies for what they are but the fandom has definitely become more rabid and needlessly petty."
PrequelMemes,fd9yhlv,t3_ekctji,1578239603.0,They definitely did bully that little kid tho. Not Hayden was older but they definitely bullied a fucking child. SW fandom is garbage always has been. But the movies are great fun.
space,fd9shsp,t3_ekcg0e,1578237534.0,People have great imaginations. That's all it makes me think honestly.
getdisciplined,fcwc0ui,t1_fcvwvy8,1578021909.0,"There's a book called ""the mind illuminated"". I think that's what it's called. It's pretty dense but you don't have to read it front to back. Just go to the parts about meditation and follow the program. It works for learning to be mindful and the writer has a great way of explaining things. It's not a book for reading front to back. It's more a guide to meditation theory and practice."
getdisciplined,fcvssio,t3_ej647t,1578009292.0,"Mindfulness meditation. That stuff works. 

The long and short of it is you have to rewrite your brain. You've gotten used to a mental pattern. Feel the thing, focus on the feeling. You have to get to: feel the thing, let it go. 

Before getting to a decent level of meditation and mindfulness, it's hard to explain. One thing you aren't doing to help yourself is in how you view yourself. You say you're sensitive, so you will be sensitive. You've spent years, probably decades, saying you're sensitive, and being so, because what we say we are is what we allow ourselves to become. If you start by saying to yourself, I'm not sensitive, I'm tough, etc. That could be a start."

unpopularopinion,fc28401,t1_fc24wxi,1577344892.0,"It's meat free. Meat free and vegan are not the same. Burger King never said it was vegan, just meat free. This means that while the patty has no meat, they still put mayonnaise on the burger and will add cheese if you want. It is cooked on the same griddle as the meat options. All of this is problematic for vegans since there guy biome changes due to the diet. Vegan is not vegetarian, which generally includes animal products like cheese and sour cream. Vegan is more intense and a vegan persons body adjusts pretty dramatically."
