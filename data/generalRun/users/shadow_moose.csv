It's also worth noting that it can be very challenging to *predict* what upcoming updates will actually do to your product. Sometimes, updates that don't clearly pertain to an aircraft can still break some of that aircraft's functionality. 

This is a big problem with DCS because it has a massive code base, and it's been developed over a long period of time.

There are tons of groups out there looking to recruit guys, so there is no shortage of places for you to go if you're looking for people to play with.

Nothing fancy like the F-18, just something with enough depth that someone could really figure out how much they like the sim before committing money to it. 

Honestly, the A-4E would be a very good fit. If they could develop it completely and add it to the base game for free, that would be awesome and bring nothing but positives to the sim."

It will allow people to invite their friends into DCS, and then their friends will get tired of the limited functionality provided by the free aircraft and buy themselves a big fat full function module like the Hornet. 

I've *seen it* happen - we were running a rip off of GaW privately for our gaming group so we could fly around together, plenty of people who'd never been interested in DCS joined us and flew the A-4E since we installed it on the server. More than half of the people who came to fly with us in the A-4E eventually bought a paid module. 

This is a great avenue for sales and it would make the game more inviting to newcomers. I see it as an absolute win-win *if* the A-4E could be finished and implemented to a high enough quality standard.

hoggit,fetdlor,t1_ferhj0h,1579374267.0,"I'll chime in with my own personal real life experience and say that spotting airplanes while you yourself are in the air is very challenging. It's a matter of moving reference points more than anything else. If I'm standing still on the ground, it's *a lot* easier for me to see irregularities in the environment. 

When I'm 8,000 feet up at 140 knots, I have a lot of trouble figuring out where my buddy is visually so we can join up. When I'm in the cockpit, I generally don't *see* aircraft until they're about five miles away. I might know they're there, but I don't see them. 

The sky is a big place, everything around you is moving in different directions relative to you. All that motion (the ground moving by, your own aircraft moving, etc) makes it very challenging to track the motion of a small object.

I think DCS likely lacks some spotting features - I should be able to see any aircraft within five miles of me as a black dot at the least. Additionally, contrails need to draw at all distances. This is challenging technologically speaking as at certain distances, the contrail drawn will consist of *less* than one pixel. Obviously you can't draw half a pixel, so this is where you start to run into problems and you have to make technical/gameplay sacrifices to make it work."

Futurology,fejwh9w,t1_fejvx5a,1579187440.0,"> I’ve never seen a product that notes region-specific safety standard compliance.

I think that's because the requirements for most region specific safety standards have to do with the charging brick itself. The cables aren't a safety risk in most cases - the current/voltage is so low with USB that it's basically impossible to be harmed or start a fire with it. 

However, if the brick gets messed up somehow, that's 120/220 volts at whatever amperage going through to whatever is in contact with it. Thus, anything that plugs into the wall itself is more heavily regulated, which the cables that plug into the thing that plugs into the wall are not.

Guy smelled weed and I informed him that it wasn't probable cause for a search, and there were plenty of excuses considering I was a farmer, so he called his boss (who comes to all my barbecues) because I refused the search and told him to get his boss on the line. 

When he got off the radio he was pissed, he told me ""I know you've got a shit load of weed in that car, go home and don't let me smell it again."" and then he fucked off back to his car and I breathed a sigh of relief. 

Thing is, the sheriff lives about a quarter mile down the road from me and I drop off a box of vegetables and stuff for him every week, so later that week when I went to drop it off, we both had a good laugh over the whole thing.

I don't want to fly them, I just want their approximate known capabilities to be represented in game as an optional AI unit that can be placed. It would be an interesting and fun thing to do for players - flying 4th gen fighters against 5th gen can work in some situations and it would be cool to mess around with it. 

I think we know *enough* about the B-2, the F-35, the F-22, and F-117 to model them to a suitable standard to be AI aircraft. I don't know about the Su-57 and the J-20, they're a little different in the sense that hard performance figures are hard to come by, there's less footage of them, they are in many ways more classified in comparison to American 5th gen aircraft, and SME's are harder to find."

In DCS, I think the fit is pretty poor. It just doesn't do combined arms well - you will be sorely disappointed if you want to play combined arms in DCS. DCS is much more focused on the simulation of individual aircraft in what feels like a fairly sterile and incomplete environment. This is my biggest problem with DCS, it's rare to really feel like you're *at war* in the sim. 

BMS is *far* better in this regard, although it definitely does have it's shortcomings. I think you should check out BMS and the various theatres it has. It's very well made, although extremely old, however, it has been updated consistently and it doesn't actually have that many bugs. 

I remember seeing an East German Cold War theatre for BMS, so definitely take a look there. If you go try BMS, you'll only really be able to fly the F-16, but the Viper is a great aircraft and it can be a lot of fun in the well fleshed out dynamic environment BMS provides."

They don't know much about the technology used by US forces, they just know what they see. For instance, their bombs didn't work because of jammers on the US vehicles. They clearly didn't know about these jammers and instead (reasonably) assumed it was an issue with their hardware. 

They're not dumb guys, they can't be. You can't go around building mines and ambushing convoys if you're a *complete* idiot. I'm sure they're of fairly average intelligence, but they have MUCH less education than anyone you or I know, and they don't have the option to go *get* that education, either.

IASIP,fe92zo4,t1_fe8zlki,1578933669.0,"That's a very good point. It's not a problem if you're young, healthy, and you're doing a *reasonable* amount of coke. However, if there is a history of heart problems in your family, or if you are elderly, or if you are obese, or if you are dehydrated/vitamin deficient, the risks go up dramatically.

Like anything you put in your body, there are risks that you need to be aware of, but those risks don't make the substance *inherently bad*, it just makes it more risky to use. 

It's a cost benefit analysis you have to run through, and it varies significantly from person to person. What we should really all focus on is the fact that drugs are fun, but NO ONE should ever be forced to do them, and instead, they should be informed of the risks. 

Any time I've shared drugs with people, I made sure they knew what they were getting into and gave them a ton of opportunities to ""just say no"". We should all do the same. We're all just trying to have a good time, after all."

IASIP,fe8qo12,t1_fe8o8ku,1578929426.0,"> coke is probably a bad idea anywhere.

In my experience, the only good time to do coke is when you have no way of buying coke yourself. If you do coke and you have a guy you can get coke from, you'll go get more coke. 

If you can't get more coke, you'll do what you have, have a good time, and then be done doing coke. As long as you have a method of controlling your use (i.e. we're partying tonight but *just* tonight), it's totally fine. 

There are no acute health risks for very intermittent coke use - the health risks come up through chronic use. By only doing coke when it's *someone else's* coke, you can avoid the expenditure and the addiction risk."
