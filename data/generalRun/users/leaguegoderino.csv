selfimprovement,ffroetb,t1_ffrcct2,1580162265.0,"Based on your use of language in text, you’re clearly not stupid. So that fear had no validity. I’m sorry you felt that way as a kid. Now, the best advice I have is to write down some affirmations before you know you’ll have to speak at length. Something like “only I really care about sounding stupid, no one else.” It’ll help you remember that no one else thinks half as much about what you’re saying as you do. That affirmation isn’t the best as I can up with it on the spot but you get the gist. Whatever will get you some clarity to relax and just be you. The goal over time is to have that be your natural state. Which will happen pretty quick once you let go of your brain’s delusions. You ever hear of those people who one day just say “screw anxiety” and completely change? It’s a real thing. You eventually start to filter out the noise vs what’s real. You’ll get there :)"
selfimprovement,ffr691c,t3_euruoo,1580151355.0,"It sounds to me like you’re pretty tense and stressed when trying to speak. It’s easy to organize your thoughts and speak when you’re at ease with the situation you’re in. If you’re an anxious mess of course it’ll be hard. I’d say when you’re speaking what are you afraid of? It has to be something. Constantly remind yourself that the fear is irrational and to let it go. For example, if you’re speaking in a presentation and afraid of how you’re projecting yourself, you need to let that fear go and shift your attention to the present moment. Things like your subject material, or the story itself rather than some external factor. Just take a deep breath, re-asses and speak slowly but assuredly. Because at the end of the day, there’s really nothing to doubt/fear right? It’s your self-talk. Something that can be changed."

selfimprovement,ffpsfl7,t3_euhybf,1580104023.0,you already know the answer to your question. Stop worrying about what other people have done until this point and worry about what you can go do now. You're still young as hell. push through your social anxiety. Convince yourself that you're the type of person who likes making friends and being social. That's half the battle. Get off reddit and go do what you want to do. You clearly have something in mind.

movies,ffhswzo,t1_ff4x7jv,1579952239.0,"Alright that’s one example. It’s hard to feel empathy when that gene expression is hindered by emotional/physical trauma. Mental health is insanely complicated. Anyone studying the field will tell you so. It’s definitely insincere to say it’s mostly genetics. That’s perpetuating the stigma towards mental health today. Please do some actual research and talk to people knowledgeable on the subject. The brain and mind is one of the things we understand very little of because we don’t know how all the factors connect. Just because you don’t understand it doesn’t mean it’s “not that complex.” Literally other than why life exists, it’s one of the most complicated and nuanced topics, and it’s probably connected to other substantial topics."

Aim for Whole Foods and fruits and vegetables. Get a variety and avoid the bad stuff. I mean let’s be real, everyone knows the bad parts of their diet. Start by removing those and replacing them with good healthy alternatives. You don’t need a specific list, just go to the store! Once you have a solid basis, then consistent intake of probiotics will help tremendously. You can take probiotics alongside your new diet, but it might take a while for the healthy changes to take affect. Either way, you need consistent use."

Advice,ffddzuw,t3_et01eb,1579818886.0,"Listen with something like depression, it’s a signal you’re not getting something you need. I hope you get that something to improve your life. But when it comes to making a decision to get a pet it’s pretty simple. Having a dog will not suddenly improve your life. Sure it could be a little comfort, but that’s putting your well-being into an external influence’s hand. Only how you feel about yourself will make you feel better. There’s no secret thing you can buy or start doing besides addressing the root cause. So do not buy a puppy if that’s the only reason you’re doing it. A pup is a big responsibility. If you’re not responsible to yourself, how do you expect to be responsible for someone else? 


Just ask yourself, are you ready for the commitment it entails? You’re overthinking it. A puppy won’t limit your ability to become knowledgeable about smart investments. Just listen to yourself, does that make any sense? It’s not rational. You can do both. Stop putting limiting beliefs on yourself. If you’re ready to take care of something else and committed to it, then do it. But in my opinion, your desire of getting a puppy is of a selfish intention. Which is OK, so long as you understand that and take care of it all the same. Also, consider adopting! There’s a dog out there who might never have the potential to get a home because they’re not a pup! You wouldn’t need to train as much if you find the right one and it takes a lot of strain out. And you’ll still have a companion you love. I’m sorry if this sounded harsh, but it’s the truth. I wouldn’t tell anyone to never get a dog, but don’t overthink it. You want a dog? (pls adopt) Then get one and it will bring you happiness and joy, just make sure you’re responsible. This dog won’t ruin your life or magically fix your life. And honestly if you don’t think a dog is worth your rental options, etc. then you’re not ready for that commitment. If you have that dog, you better find a place where you can bring the dog lmao, no question."

selfimprovement,ff59hw8,t3_erp72h,1579584289.0,"Remember when it comes to goals, do not treat everything as a means to an end. Enjoy the moment. For example, when it comes to going to the gym, don’t rely on this fantasy of the ideal person you want to become. Humans like to act according to their identity. So if you say you need to go to the gym because you need to get healthy, you’re telling yourself that you’re unhealthy subconsciously, and unhealthy people don’t go to the gym. Instead, say you WANT (not need) to go to the gym because it’s important to you. You’re an active person and you care about your health. You’re a person who goes to the gym. That will take away that mental “tug of war” I guess of doing something. So try not to use an ideal “best version” of you as motivation. You’ll find that no matter how far you go, you’ll always feel like you’re coming up short and chasing after something you don’t identify with. It’s amazing you have a general direction with goals, but that’s all they should be. Learn to live in the moment and enjoy the process of these changes instead of things you HAVE to do, to achieve something you want. That takes the fun and enjoyment out of doing anything really. Operate from an abundance mindset of who you are and what you do have rather than a scarcity mindset of who you are not and what you don’t have. So I don’t mean convince yourself that you are health god and that’s why you’re eating right or going to the gym, because that’s just not true. But try to recalibrate and operate on who you are rather than what you aren’t. You’ll find that your goals will be fulfilled and you’ll actually be able to enjoy them and keep on going. All we have is the moment, you’ve already arrived, learn to keep on enjoying the moment and the process of what you CHOOSE to do. Not what you must, or should, or have. Think positive thoughts like that and positivity will come your way. You become what you think. Which essentially means you act on what you think and who you are, which results in being that person who has positive thoughts. Just realize that going forward. Save this comment and if you find difficulty in achieving your goals still, this will set it straight. Even if you don’t agree right now because you’re high on motivation lol."

AskReddit,fetxiv0,t3_eqies2,1579381049.0,"I was a teenager when that whole clown ordeal started happening. You remember where actual people would dress like clowns and some people even got kidnapped/murdered? Well, my friends and I went out late night to this trail near our houses. It was really late at night and usually the trail had lights on, but it was pitch black. The thing about this trail is that it’s a pseudo maze. Like it’s very easy to get lost. So we all went in and were excited because of how eerie it was, but then we heard a laugh. All three of us heard that shit. It was straight up a laugh like a clown and we all immediately pulled out our phone flash lights. Needless to say we were scared shitless until we found our way back out. Good thing one of my friends has good memory for things like that or else we would’ve been lost with that fucker. We called the police and notified them, but nothing came of it.

selfimprovement,fen6zoe,t3_eq0sn4,1579278350.0,"That’s a lot of drinks man. I’d say you should address the root cause of why you drink so much. Replacing that with gaming or other escapism “hobbies” will just hide the problem under a veil of switching it up. And you won’t genuinely enjoy those hobbies because you’ll be playing to escape rather than have some fun. So cutting down is a great first step, but why not replace it with something meaningful and work towards something you’ve always wanted to do? Dedicate that extra time towards meaning and purpose rather than free time. That could be reading influential books, being social and making connections, or just learning a skill that speaks to you."

productivity,feaqz1j,t1_fe9q90n,1578951429.0,"I guess it’s about optimizing your routine so you have energy for things outside of work. Make sure your sleep is long enough, but the quality is great also. Eat right, exercise. Once you get the small, but important changes on track, you’ll have the drive to achieve your ambition. If you could do anything, what is it? What speaks to you? What would you want to get paid for besides video games and leisure activities? Write it down and do what I said earlier about goals. Work does suck the life out of you if you let it. But it can also be a means to an end. So your sales job does have a lot of meaning just in and of itself. You want to be a physics teacher? Downsize your place, save up, and make the commitment and get that teacher certification. Don’t bullshit yourself, change doesn’t come unless you make it happen. Now I’m not sure about if you have a family or not so obviously you’d be limited in the severity of your changes, but the premise is the same. I’d say go for a career change if you really want, but do you think it’ll just be the same? You’ll just go teach and forget about it the second you get home and do nothing? If so, reflect on your life outside of work and dedicate more of your time to things meaningful to you. Those things are there, you just have to search for them. Hell, if you can financially do it, go take a long ass trip to a country you’ve always wanted to go. Dedicate your time to meaningful values like connection, compassion, and purpose, rather than money and status. Are you gonna sit on your deathbed thinking of moments where you bought a house to impress people you don’t give a shit about, or how much income you have? Or are you going to reminisce on moments of meaning and connection? Don’t let other people dictate how you live your life. Who cares if someone judges you for quitting your job or going after something else? You don’t have to live your life based on what someone else’s judgement of life is. So if anyone is keeping you from changing, have that conversation. There’s a lot of time for these moments outside of work, you just have to start going for it. It’s also there in your work too, but maybe in a more practical sense. If you want something different but don’t want to give up your current leisure and quality of life? Then you’re bullshitting yourself and things will always be the same."
productivity,fe9iw0q,t1_fe955f7,1578937889.0,"Think about it like this. You have to figure out a way to frame your work to make it meaningful. Does work allow you to have food and shelter? Already meaningful. But the problem is you don’t find intrinsic meaning in it, right? Think of what the paper can lead to. Go out in your spare time and work towards a goal, a passion. Take your most ambitious goals and turn them into their simplest form. Want to learn a new skill? Break it down into its smallest step, and start. Have some downtime in your day that’s wasted? Make small changes to your routine. Want to learn a language but don’t have time? Play audio learning tapes on the way to work and back, every day. If you don’t particularly find your work interesting, it can still be meaningful and matter. And who knows, maybe one day you’ll find yourself making money from a different passion. Nothing you do in life doesn’t matter. There’s more and it starts with your perspective."

bostonceltics,fdqmhr8,t3_emr4gs,1578670175.0,"I don’t agree with this take. I think the Jays have just as much to be desired as Hayward does. Hayward’s looking to pass and set up consistent offense that works over 48. If you rely on athleticism and “running teams out of the gym,” then you’ll quickly get gassed and lose steam. Hayward’s trying to play the right way, but there’s not enough ball movement. At this point, all our wings are now resorting to iso ball instead of moving the ball. If you’ve noticed we’re good when one of jaylen, Tatum, or Hayward are out. And that’s because we switch up how we play. They all need to learn to work better together. Hayward is too talented to be an elite 4th option. They all need to coexist as teammates and not options. Kemba is our number one scorer and the only time we resort to “options” is during the game if one guy is feeling it. We know kemba and Tatum are our clutch guys."

selfimprovement,fdki74g,t3_elro8s,1578504351.0,"Okay I just need to preface this by saying you need to stop assuming and judging other people’s situations. Most people in a 9-5 don’t like it. They’re passing time to go do fun, meaningful things that bring happiness. So more people are in your situation than you think. Some people work to live instead. I mean that’s what you’re doing right? It sucks, it feels like it’s just going through the motions. 


Working a job you don’t like is to give the luxury to be financially able to do things you truly find happiness and joy in. It sucks, but you can’t do those things in a society where money directly effects quality of life. Money isn’t happiness, but it can contribute to misery if you don’t have a comfortable amount. So you can do a few things, keep on working the 9-5 and convince yourself of all the reasons it sucks ass and why you don’t want to, or you can embrace that you’re working to have a nice life outside of work. I know it feels like work truly sucks your entire day, but it’s only 40 hours of the week. You have so much time. Make the most of the time outside of work. Also put your effort into work and know that just living life and being paid for your contributions is valuable in and of itself. You can go into work with a different perspective to do your best work. And maybe even leave work feeling content one day. You still won’t love it, or want to do it for the rest of your life, but it won’t be filled with these feelings of hatred and sadness. So those people you call “deluded” may just either be grateful for the spot they’re in or they may be embracing it because it will get them through to their desired goal. It’s a means to an end and they make the most light out of the means. 


So you can do this until you find a way to make money outside of work and that financially supports you. Let’s say your case, your music production takes off. That’s the perfect method of risk and practicality. Your earning money to support other needs and banking on your time outside work to get you to where you want. Again, like I said, you have a lot of time. 


Finally, you could quit. Take a massive risk. If you can’t change how you approach working from a mindset perspective, then take that big leap. It might fuck you over and I’m willing to bet that’s the reason you quit. That’s how you turn into the failed music producer who now works at a job worse than the one he had before. Use work as a motivation to work harder towards your 5-10 year goals, and be more thankful for it. Now this isn’t to say what you’re feeling isn’t valid, other people have, and others at your work so as well. Don’t be so judge mental, and try to get your psychological needs such as meaning and fulfillment and relationships outside of work and make the most of it. It’s not the end, you’re only as stuck as you think you are. If your ultimate goal is to not work 9-5, either make a big sacrifice like downsizing where you live and not buying anything unnecessary and completely sacrifice your quality/comfort of life, or change how you view it and work to get to where you desire. Or you can keep your quality of life to “Work” on your goals outside of work. But don’t be conceited enough to believe that this work doesn’t support your current actions/spending habits. So don’t bullshit yourself. Keep it the same and grind to go bigger, or change it up and get ready for some change. The balls in your court. I know what I’d do. But if you need money to support your hobby/passion and goals, then be grateful you have the chance and be motivated not upset. Even then, you could quit, and sell your shit, downsize, and work towards your goals, if you can’t fathom working a 9-5 at all. But I’m telling you, it’s about your mindset towards it. Don’t quit in my opinion, but go in knowing it’s not settling, it’s growing. It might feel like going through the motions but it’s not. In the end it’s your choice and both are valid."

AmItheAsshole,fdjnygv,t1_fdjlf71,1578480149.0,"There’s no way you actually believe what you’re saying. Like I cannot fathom that someone can exist and think that. Please come out and say you’re joking to end all this nonsense so all can have faith in humanity again. Incase you’re actually serious for some reason, hijabs and swastikas symbolize different things. You’re not denying what swastikas symbolize, but not everyone who wears a hijab supports the murder of adulterers and gays. I’d reckon most do not. Sure a small minority of idiots with a swastika might not support the murder of Jews, but what are the odds? If you do blatantly cast your beliefs out, people can oppose and refuse service. If someone walked into my store with a hijab I wouldn’t refuse service because I’m aware that most likely they’re wearing it for personal reasons that harm no one. If someone comes into my store with a swastika tattoo, it’s so inconsiderate that they have no benefit of the doubt. And should be refused service. It’s common sense man. Stop trying to justify something by creating an incomparable argument riddled with fallacies. You’re smarter than that. Own up to it, read this, and move on. You don’t need someone telling you that over the Internet, but if you must, there it is.

bostonceltics,fdcsuon,t1_fd9iixg,1578283348.0,"I also think that we had a really good #1 deep threat and outside guy for so long that our system changed to quick small passes instead of trusting our guys 1 on 1. I’m pretty sure Brady didn’t trust Harry and Meyers enough to throw it up and expect them to win. And they didn’t earn that trust because they were consistently losing 1 on 1 routes. Think about how different this offense was with Cooks. He was a reliable deep threat that Brady trusted. But you’re right, our system does need to develop and adapt to ALLOW Brady to get proper chemistry with these guys. I feel like being a WR on the pats is so much different than another team right now. And that boils down to scheme. Then again, all those times where Brady was waiting in the pocket for so long and had to throw it away? Guys weren’t winning man coverage. And Edelman was doubled. We need one guy who can win man coverage consistently. Tough to find, but there’s many out there. You’re right, we need a solid tight end to open up space. So it’s not all on the receivers and id say we should keep Harry and maybe Sanu, but we should go out and get a tight end and really consider who else we can get at WR."
bostonceltics,fd7g0yj,t1_fd7b0zg,1578203911.0,I’m sorry but Brady’s not banking on two guys maybe improving. We need a good tight end a proven reliable receiver besides Jules. We had AB but he wasn’t worth the drama. Our O line wasn’t as good as years past but I agree we need a little more so we can have a better run game.
bostonceltics,fd7673v,t1_fd74wrp,1578199950.0,"You’re fine, I feel the same way. Yeah we didn’t deserve to win, and the titans played well. We really need an offensive system shake up. I think McDaniels is overthinking things and not adjusting his play calls to the flow of the game. Too many useless runs and cheeky plays to cover up for the fact that our offensive roster is trash. The only players I feel bad for are Brady, Edelman, and White on offense. They deserved better around them. It always felt like we were trying to trick our way into good offense and hoping for Brady to bail us out. He has in the past, but it was too much to overcome this time. Defense did enough to win but were clearly didn’t have the personnel to stop the run. 


Unfortunate, but hey we can’t control what happens so we shouldn’t let it affect our mental state too much and shouldn’t be so attached to somethijf external. I just hope we get better receivers and a more aggressive offense coordinator. If not, Brady should retire because he doesn’t deserve to be in a bad situation."

Advice,fd3hwe6,t3_ejxjff,1578158433.0,"Listen man, I kind of see where you’re coming from as I struggle with similar issues. My “cure” was to not really care about the fact that I wasn’t in a relationship or couldn’t pick up girls. I just didn’t let it bother me. Then I got to working on myself. I built habits that made me feel good and stuck with them. I also figured out the root causes of my anxiety and sadness and tackled those. I didn’t even see a therapist, just a good amount of introspection and informative books/videos and I finally figured it out. I just figured it out a few months ago actually and my life has taken a complete turn. I’ve started to stop over analyzing and thinking as much and be more in the moment. More happy. Girls started to take more interest in me, and it was a nice bonus, but it wasn’t what I was after. I did it for me. Help yourself and seek help and companionship from people who love you. See a therapist if that makes it easier for you to figure it all out. All of my friends swear by it, and if I didn’t solve my problems within this year I was going to go to therapy as well. I’m probably still going to go, just to talk it out with an unbiased third party.


Now I don’t have a diagnosed condition like aspergers, so I can’t speak much on what can’t be changed. But my anxiety and small bouts of depression (if you can even call it depression, I’m 99% sure I wasn’t depressed, just unmotivated and unhappy and a little numb) were caused by things and they weren’t biological. As a human I had psychological needs that weren’t met. And I also had physical needs that weren’t met that were affecting my mental state. As I started to work on both, my life got a whole lot better and yours can to. 


If you want to message me and talk about what exactly I found out and took action towards, then PM me. But the best advice I can give you, is I know it can feel sucky not being in a relationship, but I promise in the grand scheme of things it’s not something to beat yourself up for. Sometimes some perspective is all it takes, to see what you’re truly craving. Also from your post, you’re just a guy that’s nice, not a “nice guy.” Just don’t overdo it with the compliments cause it comes off as a little pushy, but really, who cares am I right? Get on the important shit. You subconsciously, and if you think about it, consciously know what they are. Good luck my man."
