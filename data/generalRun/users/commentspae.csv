Well, with a personality as contradictory as hers, it's hard to know whether she *would* want that. Before >!killing two people because of her own insecurity about being trapped in the game!<, she seemed very demanding and self-centred. People who are egoistic like that already aren't exactly a great contender for an altruistic embrace, since they'd most likely respond with shocked silence, and then *after* that silence, they'd act noticeably more self-centred, in a more ""Someone accepts me for how I act"" manner than an ""I have standards that don't have any relevance in this group of people I still don't personally know about yet"" manner. Hifumi simply providing her with tea per her request incorrectly was enough to cause her to *moderately*, temporarily lose her sanity. Even if I *want* to hug a character like her...no, that's not going to happen unless she has some hidden depth behind her ego that can compensate for deciding to do that...

Of course, writing out that entire exception was redundant if simply asking ""Greetings, Celestia. How are you on the idea of hugging?"" receives a complex, posh answer that can be translated into a blunt ""I like it, and you can do it to me if you want to...for only 6 seconds, you pervert""."

Anyway, other than the inclusion of Jackspeticeye, yes, I concur. These people who create content apparently seem to overdo whatever they're attempting to do, and they all feel like they originated from Markiplier's misplaced American culture, if anything. Jacksepticeye, Markiplier, and PewDiePie all understandably act nonsensical, smug, unaware of the medium, and as for Mr.Beast specifically, *he doesn't use his money for any other purpose than distributing it among his social circle and it's impossible to know the reason why other than ""I'm American and inconsiderate of altruism"".*

In fact, they can be compared to a Danganronpa V3 character with how they act. Specifically Kaito Momota. Most people who use the internet subconsciously know what Danganronpa is, but Kaito Momota as a character? No. SO, time to explain on a miniature basis: Kaito is an astronaut that has an extreme bravado where he believes in people rather than suspecting them (Danganronpa's based around the prisoner's dilemma for context). Similarly to those content creators, he practically decided to be a dropout by illegally completing an exam based on lunar knowledge with an acquaintance. However, he apparently didn't get any consequences for it, and according to his introduction, they accepted him ""because they liked him"", similarly to how the audience of these people just accepts them for who they are ""because they like them"". Throughout the game, he constantly prioritises emotional output over logical output, which nearly kills the rest of the game's cast at one point in the game, which can also be compared to how those creators place nonsensical ideas before sensible ones, which would basically indirectly negatively influence their audience into a life where they would probably as feel little self-worth as possible, just like we as adolescents and adults currently act right now.

This is just a comparison between one fictional character and a hivemind of influential people. And that's all it *will* be since there's no other way to explain and compare otherwise without making a contradiction.
