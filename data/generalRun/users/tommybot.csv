Attacking? Atk/atk/cr or atk/cd/cr
Attack tank? Switch in an hp/def for atk

Tanking? Hp/hp/def
Tanky atk? Add an atk in for an hp

If the skills require crit take a build and add cr 

If it's an aggressor Mon
Hp/hp/hp or hp/hp/cr

Just my .0002 cents

In the end if you arnt sure after doing you due diligence in research, just ask. If anything your ask/answer will help a lurker."

We place IR patches on our kit and uniforms. When using NVGs (Night Vision Goggles) and IR lights or lazers, we see our teammates easier. These patches don't ""show up"" or light up when you use a regular flash light.

Googling ""ir patch"" gives me a wiki page and then a site to buy ir patches. I don't know if this is what you were thinking of but to me it feels common place because we use it every day."
