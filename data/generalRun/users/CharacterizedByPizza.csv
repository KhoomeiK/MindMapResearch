videos,ff5rvqi,t1_ff5jydh,1579607856.0,"I stopped when I saw a homeless dude yelling at a lady with a baby just trying to exit a grocery store, calling her the classic dutch equivalent of a whore with cancer. I came out after, he looked at me, yelled WHAT, very aggressively, like I got kinda scared.

My bike was like 1 meter behind him so I just kinda nodded and said ""mornin'"" and tried to be on my way, so I walked past him and started unlocking this bike and this mother fucker just walks up to my bag of groceries and attempts to just take something from it at which point I was like 'dude, fuck the hell off I'm pretty poor too, leave my bag alone' and he just goes into this homeless rage kicking the bag and my bike.

Karma was an instant bitch with two police officers on lunch break coming out of the store and seeing it happen. He got taken away and I've never seen the dude there again.

Now I just grab my phone and avoid any visual/social contact whatsoever. Beats interacting with deadbeat lunatics."

pokemon,fdrrhxj,t3_emsuuf,1578688633.0,"I've done hobbyist game programming for a few years and I myself wasted days on a single model. When I then heard The Pokemon Company earns millions of money-units by skimming on everything I pour my heart into on a daily basis just makes me feel like shit. So since the first leaks about the incredibly shitty GameFreak ways I've decided to boycot all of it until they get their shit together.

I get, from a business perspective, why they did what they did as a game studio, it's a tough industry and money makes the world go round. So yeah I don't actually expect them to ever get ""their shit together"". It's just me being mad about how the world works, I guess.

As for in-game reasons; I just feel the gimmicks have been so stupid the last few versions. It started with mega-evolution. Call me autistic or whatever, but I still feel the older starters should have never been able to evolve. It was such fan favoritism that it ruined X and Y entirely for me. It still feels unfair some poke's got it, while most others were and still are ignored. ""WHY DOES CHARIZARD GET TWO?"" was my initial thought. In hindsight it makes sense; he's a dragon. Kids love dragons, I guess. But it seems like as long as you add some flames shooting out of some Poké's butt, he's stronger in this universe. Cool lore, GameFreak. It's just such wasted potential.

So yeah, ever since X/Y it just started spiraling down for me.

This DLC is the nail in the coffin for me. I'm glad they won't make y'all buy another 60 bucks version, but this is just the start of a slippery slope I feel we've already been seeing for years with the whole lootbox mentality a lot of other online games have nowadays. People will buy it, they'll get away with it, but I won't slide down with them, I'm done.

I'll always love the genre, and maybe who knows, maybe some day they do something to make me love it again as Breath of the Wild made me fall in love with Legend of Zelda again, but for now, I'm not seeing that happen!"

theperfectpokemongame,fddat2q,t1_fdbtxuv,1578303048.0,"I haven't bought it myself, but people on this subreddit who make the ""how did they mess up"" complaint every single day seem to forget it's a children's game of a franchise intended to make money. Which it does almost automatically at this point.

Few people outside this subreddit seem to care about the PokéDex cuts, the 'realism' inside the game and such. As long as it has vibrant colors and cute/cool animal-esque stuff there's nothing stopping most kids from eating the games up.

It's just an advertisement game, and like it or not, people have been falling for ads forever.

Besides that, GameFreak rightfully chose to devote their resources to other games as The Pokemon Company clearly just wants to go in a Pokemon GO-esque direction.

I hate how it is too, but it's all business in the end and it does make sense. :("
