Yes

> Terminator uses time travel to introduce a future threat of skynet 

No.  Time travel is not used at all.  The future threat is merely explained by another character.  There is no scene with additional time travel shenanigans.  Looper has a guy literally running down the street while he gets chopped up in the future utilizing time travel mechanics.

No. Her motivation is merely to not get shot to death by a robot.

movies,fgl41k5,t1_fgl2s2c,1580881331.0,"nitpicking is picking at a single point.  Like in terminator.  They use time travel to get the terminator there.  Then time travel is never used again.  The rules don't matter because they don't affect the plot.  The point of the movie is that there's a deadly machine trying to kill someone.  That's it.  Time travel wasn't even strictly necessary, the terminator could have been some present-day-secret-project.  It's not important to the plot.

Looper: Time travel is there to get the plot rolling.  Then time travel is used again to present a threat (the future rainmaker).  Then time travel is used to motivate the mooks (cutting them up in the future).  Then time travel is used again when they discuss how immoral it is for the ""good guy"" to kill a child.  And they actually sit down in a restaurant and talk about how time travel works.  Time travel is absolutely important to the plot and everything revolves around time travel.

Then YOU claim you have to ""just ignore time travel, the movie isn't about time travel!""  Yeah, you're making dumb excuses.  It's not nitpicking when it's a point that comes up OVER AND OVER AND OVER again.  And over again.  It's a major, repetitive, driving point of the movie, not a nit."

like, 95% of my deaths wasn't from me mis-timing things, or not knowing where to go in the level.  It's the game's controls that have multiple actions bound to a single key, and trying to use ""contextual cues"" to pick the correct action.  And I just die when the game decides the wrong action **for** me instead of, well, me being a dumbass and **choosing** the wrong action.  I can accept the latter, and get better with practice.

movies,fgkim8m,t1_fgk441v,1580866418.0,"No, that's exactly what he's saying.

Time travel in other movies make sense *enough* to move the plot along without causing trouble elsewhere.  Take Terminator for example.  Killer robot from the future arrives.  That's it.  Time travel isn't used anywhere else in the movie, and it IS a minor point that can be mostly ignored.

In Looper, it isn't.  Time travel is used to explain character motivation, then threats from the bad guys, then use to set up tension, then used again to set up moral dilemmas, then used more, etc.  It places time travel front and center, then had the audacity to whine ""that's not the point!

At least with other movies that use time travel, they explain it in a way that almost makes sense and use it minimally so it doesn't get in the way.  Like Terminator. Looper did neither.  It put time travel front and center for multiple events and then doesn't even follow its own rules.  They have to literally say in the movie ""don't think about it.""

2.  They explain her ultimate armor: it absorbs (that is, HEALS her) certain elemental damage including ice.  They animate her putting it on.  Later in the fight, she gets taken out by an ice attack.

3.  They say she has even GREATER strength when she performs her limit break, but they won't count that because limit breaks are unusual or one-off situations.  Then they specifically animate her getting her limit break (with 100% critical hits, too).  Naturally, they ignore the strength increase that they pointed out.

Just a whole lot of bullshit all around.  Pretty much everything they explain about Tifa during the explanation phase... they just ignore completely.  Lol.

Unless somehow the Xcover Pro is released, is cheaper, and compatible with Freedom... lol"
BadMtgCombos,ffj82w0,t1_ffj77oy,1579992712.0,"[[Truefire captain]]: when she gets damaged, she can damage any player

1.  Make her indestructible (i used [[taranika, akroan veteran]])

2.  Put Gideon's sacrifice on her

3.  Have a damage enhancer [[Jaya, venerated firemage]]

4.  damage yourself or Truefire Captain (Jaya is also good for this)

target YOURSELF with truefire captain's ability.

Jaya increases the damage +1

Gideon's sacrifice makes TF captain take the damage again

Repeat until damage is high enough to kill the other player"
