Hello reddit, i’ve been a longtime lurker of this subreddit, and finally decided to share my own experience that occurred a few months ago.


My best friend and I decided to see a movie at 9:00 pm at her local movie theater. The plan was that I would pick her up and drive us to the movie. The theater is only about 15 minutes from her house. We planned to get to the theater about 15 minutes before the movie began so we could buy our tickets and snacks.  The plan was a simple plan but I swear something weird happened that night.

Some key factor about this story that are necessary to include before I continue:

1. My best friend lives in a small town. In this town it’s pretty rare for people to stay out past 8:00 pm on weekdays. Which is specifically why we chose a weekday and a late time to see the movie...less people = a more enjoyable movie. 

2. My best friend and I are both clinically diagnosed with OCD. Both of us have obsessive tendencies to check our plans for error. including checking showtimes/locations repeatedly to make sure there is no error. We both checked the showtimes for this movie compulsively on that day (making sure it’s the correct time, correct theater, correct date, etc.)

Continuing on with the story...on our drive to the movie theater, we drove down a lot of backroads that are barely lit. (small town). There was no traffic and we maybe passed by 1-2 cars the entire drive. Which wasn’t strange for the town we were in We reach a traffic light/intersection about a mile up from the movie theater. The traffic light is in a very weird area since it’s basically in the middle of the woods on a back road with almost no cell signal nearby. Very eerie and no street lights beside the traffic light itself.

Since we are the only car in the area, the traffic light should turn green almost immediately; however, it does not. This is where things get weird...My friend and I both vividly remember being stuck sitting at this red light for around 15 minutes and wondering if we were going to miss the movie because of it. (I wasn’t going to run the red light, and risk ANY chance of getting a ticket, also we could see that the traffic light was working because on the other sides of the intersection it would occasionally turn green randomly for an empty street.)

Finally the light turns green for us, and we rush to the theater hoping we could still make it in time after being held up at the traffic light for so long. 

When we park the car at the theater’s parking lot, my friend points out the time and shows that we still had 15 minutes before the movie starts at 9:00. At that point we begin to freak out because we sat at that traffic light for 15 minutes. we both remember talking about possibly missing the movie and sitting there for a long time. Definitely a WTF moment because we had no idea where those 15 minutes went. We were both very freaked out but shook it off that it could have just been an exaggeration or a trick of the mind.

The story doesn’t end there. We walk up to the ticket stand to buy our movie tickets and ask to get two tickets for the 9:00pm showing. The employee then explains that the movie we wanted to see doesn’t start until 10:30pm and that we must have read the showtimes wrong. We told the employee that we both checked that it started at 9:00. However the employee insisted that it definitely had started at 10:30 all along and there had been no changes to the showtime. No other movies started at 9:00 either so there was no way we got it confused with another movie. 

We begin to freak out once again and ended up just going home and seeing the movie another day. It was a very weird experience and we still don’t understand what happened. My friend joked afterwards that we entered some alternate universe at that traffic light. 

Still we often talk about what happened that night though. Why did we sit at that traffic light for so long but no time actually passed??? And how did we BOTH get the movie time wrong when we compulsively checked the showtimes for the right theater, date and time multiple times?? Maybe this is just an error on our part but it seems like some kind of glitch."
