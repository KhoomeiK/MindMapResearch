wicked_edge,ffiqwu4,t3_etur97,1579980477.0,Yes. Buy a blade sample. 5 blades each should give you an idea of what works for your razor.

I already have the altoids tin ready to go, but I like the idea of decorating it or taping it up. 

 I bought a Merkur travel razor and it disassembles and stores in a 2"" or so square leather case."

Wetshaving,fff8sgr,t1_ffewafa,1579878550.0,"Avoid buying from Amazon.  It's hit or miss on the quality and the prices are not as good as one would think.  I prefer to buy directly from the artisan soap makers.  (More margin for them, means they make more soaps for us.)

Start with sample packs of soaps and blades, and then go with what you like.  Get a good soap bowl (with a lid), to try said samples in.

Maggards Razors, West Coast Shaving, all offer good budget starter kits with lots of other options to feed the ""shaving monkey"".

Also, don't try an open comb at first.  The open comb is more ""aggressive"", and you will bleed profusely.  Once you have gotten more comfortable with shave technique, then you can switch up.

I have used a styptic pencil in the past, but get yourself a good alum block for post shave.  The better starter kits from the above vendors will include one."

Cruise,ff7hzry,t3_erwrur,1579649998.0,"Depends upon what you like to drink, actually....  :-)

We have been on about 6 trips with Celebrity.  (7th this May, bringing the Summit back from PR) .  We started at first with the Classic Package.  

However, we are Martini drinkers and the Martini bar is an upcharge per drink.  The difference between the two packages amounts to one martini per day per person.  That alone sold us.

 If you are a wine drinker, you get better wine options in the main dining room, as well as  in Aqua class, with the Premium package.  They offer better selections if you want to get wine by the bottle instead of by the glass too, as I recall.

If you are a coffee drinker, the dining rooms serve Lavazza as the drip coffee.  It's very good.  However, if you want expresso, lattes, cappuccinos, etc. then those can be an upcharge as well without the Premium package"
