dogs,ff8jywu,t1_ff5gk00,1579682051.0,They truly are an amazing breed!!! Except during an earthquake! Which we just had in Southern California. My baby girl deserted me. She ran out her doggie door before I could stand up. But I gave to give her credit. She didn't go any further than that.
Dogtraining,ff8gls4,t3_es73cc,1579677566.0,"Petco carries a product buy ""Richards Organics"" it is called PET CALM and it promotes relaxation. In bold letters all caps it says use prior to events that cause stress! I know this because I had to buy it for my Belgian Malinois! I believe it will work wonders."
dogs,ff5gk00,t3_erfncn,1579591907.0,"First: That is amazing!!! True teamwork!
Secondly: I had this crazy picture of a dog and cat in my mind that caused me to laugh out loud!!! Which in turn caused Hera my Belgium Malinois, who was sleeping soundly on her cot, to jump up on my bed and bark at me!! I'm not sure if she was cussing me out for waking her or checking to make sure I was ok! What a vivid imagination I had I'm still giggling."

Dogtraining,ff1xwbw,t3_er2gaj,1579488692.0,I meant to say that Yes you should have your dog on a leash
Dogtraining,ff1xq05,t3_er2gaj,1579488571.0,"Hmmmmm.... That would depend on many factors!  And not all in the following order!
1. The age of your puppy! 
2. Has it gotten all of it's required puppy shots?  I mean all of them! 
3. Has he ever been hiking with you before?4. Does he know and respond to basic commands? 
5. How well do you know the area you're planning on hiking? 
6. No you should not have your pup off leash!!
I have a 10 mo Belgian Malinois female 10 months old. I began her training at 8 weeks! She has all her Basics commands down solid. On and off leash! But she nor I had never set foot in/on the mountains trails that are less than 2/10 of a mile until Jan 17, 2020. I kept her on a 16"" leash. 
There is a pack of coyotes that live up in those Hills because I've heard them when they made a Kill it was probably someone's cat maybe it was a rabbit more likely it was domesticated animal because they have no problems coming down low especially when their hungry. 

I live in Southern CA"
Dogtraining,fepis35,t3_eq8y34,1579321574.0,That's great! But since you're all on the floor and you're looking mighty comfortable yourself! Looks like a tie to me. But Husky still the winner. Hands down. Wait I mean paws down.
