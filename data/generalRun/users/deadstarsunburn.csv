One thing I was told that helped was to view accidents in the house as my failure instead of the dogs failure."
puppy101,fgbv247,t1_fg8g6qa,1580666389.0,Mine is a year old and only squats. We just got a girl dog and I imagine he will always squat for sure now.
Dogtraining,fgaoz4l,t3_exp46u,1580653861.0,Maybe there something that he smells in that area? Try bringing some of his favorite treats to distract him.

mildlyinteresting,ffy5veh,t3_evu7tm,1580339142.0,I think it’s at least mildly interesting that they hold their shape while they expand like that. I mean it makes sense logically but it’s still interesting in its own way. My dog has some even finer markings in his spots and those have held out his growth from a 12lb baby to a 70lb beast.

Dogtraining,ffg5rrx,t1_ffg370w,1579899053.0,I’m in the same spot. My dog has been with us for a month and she turns a year in 4 days. She is a very good girl but she needs potty and crate trained. It’s so stressful. Good Luck to you and your pup!

I’m good at it and I’m really kind to people who struggle but I hate helping them with computer problems they should be able to solve on their own because their job requires it. I’m an admin and the amount of time I get stuck on the phone helping someone log into their email on their iPhone or turn off “work offline” mode is deeply frustrating.

TeenMomOGandTeenMom2,fehr7ob,t1_fehqr5c,1579122264.0,"Ahh that makes sense. There’s more than just risk of unwanted pregnancy when removing a condom without concent, it becomes a health risk at that point.
I appreciate you explaining to me!"
TeenMomOGandTeenMom2,fehq5f8,t1_feh87vb,1579121654.0,"I’m only asking out of curiosity but does it work the other way too? Like if a girl says she’s on BC and isn’t so she can get pregnant, can that also be considered criminal or at least labeled as rape?"

WhatsWrongWithYourDog,fefrdrs,t1_fefr9y2,1579062988.0,Exactly what I was thinking. My dog’s eyes look like this sometimes too. When he’s trying to peer through our window to let us know he’s ready to come back inside and it is kind of unsettling.
antiMLM,fefr3yx,t3_eox67e,1579062776.0,That’s why a lot of them have started giving the two options YES or HECK YES

AnimalsBeingPerfect,fdwlnf0,t1_fdwco4v,1578759938.0,Aww! We’ve got yucky weather too so we’re in the same boat. I stopped letting her out on a lead and take her on a walk to potty every time so I can tell her good girl. It definitely has is challenging adopting from a shelter! But it is definitely worth it. My dog is so happy just having some carpet to lay on lol.
Youniqueamua,fdw5hcn,t1_fdt15hg,1578755303.0,That’s spot on. I go to church with a girl that sells it. Ran into her at the grocery store without make up and she looked beautiful. At church she gobs on this magenta eye shadow that isn’t blended AT ALL. It looks awful.
antiMLM,fdvz60q,t1_fduvdkp,1578753351.0,My ex husband had this done to him with Vector like 6 years ago. I think they are just plain sleazy in how they handle pay.

funny,fds84zv,t1_fdrcxmo,1578696523.0,I once was on a not packed ride and sat back where the flight attendants worked. Talked with them a bit. The guy gave me two huge bags of peanuts on our way out. It was great!
AnimalsBeingPerfect,fdpi8nb,t1_f59tm8j,1578629332.0,Solidarity on the house training a shelter pup. We just got our new girl two weeks ago and we were out of town for part of it so we’re at square one again. It’s probably the most stressful part of the whole thing. My new dog is an angel beyond that!

Dogtraining,fdmlmlw,t3_elt34l,1578554600.0,My friends dog did this and she started with having a dog walking come by while she’d be gone for longer periods of time and slowly eased him into being about to survive the longer time.
Dogtraining,fdm8x3r,t3_elw8xw,1578542735.0,"My dog is like this. He wigs out at the vet because I won’t let him play with the dogs he sees there. I just keep a huge bag of treats on me and make him focus on me, have him sit or lay down and just keep popping treats.
The intensity has faded with a little age too. He was most wild between 8-11 months old. He turned a year in November 2019 and has finally mellowed out. Still eager to play and a bit overbearing but not as bad."
Dogtraining,fdm4e9q,t1_fdls9yf,1578539522.0,"Ah her crate is massive and she’s sharing it with my other dog. Together they still have lots of room so I imagine she truly has too much space. I totally forgot that plays a big part in it all!
I do have down taking them out as soon as they come out, I’m back to the old days of going outside every hour on the hour or more lol.
Thanks so much for the tips and the link, I really appreciate it! She’s a fast learner and has really taken to being eager to please so I’m trying to stay on top of things."
Dogtraining,fdllzoh,t1_fdkiylz,1578527041.0,My shelter pup learned to potty in her crate from the shelter. Do you have advice on how to break that habit? I’ve been slowly crate training her and I’m hoping that helps but this is kind of new. Our last rescue was rescued as a pup.
Dogtraining,fdllw13,t1_fdkldu4,1578526975.0,I’m struggling with similar as OP. New dog keeps hiding  and pooping in house but if my 4yo runs her out for a walk around the yard she goes no problem. Thanks for pointing this out!
stepparents,fdeptit,t1_fdep8hw,1578344095.0,"Man that’s frustrating. I guess at least BM is consistently a mess for us but she thinks she’s doing a fabulous job and couldn’t possible do any better than she is.
Sorry you have to deal with that. Raising kids is hard enough, raising a kid who is mostly not around is even harder."
