Those feelings of yours are very important. You want to be careful about making decisions based on them. 

I can't actually go the ""self love "" root myself. I get caught up in a lot of pride and arrogance. I aim for realistic expectations for myself and and accurate understanding of myself. If feel its a lower standard that i might on occasion succeed at."
confidence,ffhi4nu,t3_etlu49,1579936279.0,You don't know what they were laughing at. Sure it could have been you but you don't know that and there is no advantage to taking it personally. So you were clingy. You would have done better by trying to find ways to make her laugh. It is what you succeed in doing in the end so you're making  headway.  Hang in there. The only way to keep from any dumb is to do nothing and that in itself is dumb.
Christianity,ffhhl9p,t3_etlyi8,1579935583.0,Yes God loves you. I haven't found defining myself based on my sexual orientation to be helpful.
Christianity,ffhfigf,t3_etmkql,1579933082.0,"When it serves His purposes definitely. In my experience He rarely use ""The fallen "". Most often we are the ones who get in our own way. One of the advantages to this method is that it allows us to take responsibility for our choice, and repent. Progress only comes with repentance."
confidence,ffhf1qx,t3_etmku1,1579932542.0,"1. You are 23 your brain has 7 more years of development. 

2. At your age even the people who think they know who they are, and what they like don't because those things change at your age. 

3. You do recognize that their are people at your age who don't have degrees and who can't hold down a job. You appear to be deliberately discounting your achievements while setting unrealistic undefined goals as your standard. That is a very dark, very deep hole. It is not advisable to go there. 

4. At this point you have spent most of your life in school. You are now in a very different world. Be curious."
Christianity,ffhdy1w,t3_etmopu,1579931345.0,"In Jesus high priestly prayer He says ""that they might know you, the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom you have sent "". Christ did not come to manifest Himself but to show us  the Father. He made it possible for us to come boldly before the throne of Grace.  That being said each of the Gospels portray Jesus differently. Mathew is King, Mark is servant, Luke is son of man and John is Son of God. If you seek Him you will find Him. You will find Him leading the way to the Father."
TrueChristian,ffhd6vk,t3_etmpod,1579930549.0,It's not the punishment that is lasting a long time. It is God giving us time to repent that is  lasting a long time.
marketing,ffhbmis,t1_ffhb0a3,1579928991.0,"I'm comparing Google earth to wikipedia. I like books, I grew up with them all around me. Letters aren't my friends, but books i like. I like globes too. The globe is the one place you can see a map of the world that isn't distorted by being flattened.

You may be right that people need to broaden their horizons. If you need people to change inorder to develop your market you have a very big job ahead of you. 

Young children are very tactical oriented. Most globes aren't built to be played with and few people will buy large ones as toys. 

Google earth is your  main competition. They have a price advantage. They are more easily  accessible and they can provide much greater detail. Your advantage is being tactile. You need a market that values physical over vertual enough to make your product attractive. 

I appreciate that you are not going to find my opinion encouraging. 

Their might be a market among people who are nostalgic about globes. That would be educated men over 50."
selfimprovement,fffoeku,t3_etc6ct,1579888305.0,I found theater arts helpful in learning to connect with others.
DecidingToBeBetter,fffmwbc,t3_etcbev,1579887395.0,Any casino will sell you more hope than you can afford. Most religions provide some sort of hope.
marketing,fffmeyo,t3_etcbqp,1579887097.0,A globe designed for the blind could still have a market. Globe's used to be sold with encyclopedias. Encyclopedias couldn't compete with wikipedia's. I don't see globe's being able to compete with Google earth. A global is tactile that's its one advantage.
Christianity,ffefd3e,t3_et4wkr,1579845886.0,"I went to a fundamentalist evangelical bible school. It taught pre-trib. The ""liberals"" among us who did buy it said they would offer an apology if the rapture were pre-trib. So its only some fundamentalist. Their are some people who very much enjoy trying to scare people. The idea of hell can be very scary. It also takes our attention away from seeking the Lord. Its hard to maintain ones arrogance while seeking the Lord."
