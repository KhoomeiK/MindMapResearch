There are plenty of things to dislike about his personal life but hating him is a different story.

If you're still spending that much energy hating him outside of basketball up to before he died, you're pretty fucking pathetic."

It's not that far from Manila or Quezon City so if you could then it's definitely a nice visit. Pretty sure there'll be a lot of memorials around the country as well. It's been Kobe country for decades."
nba,ffrnmv2,t1_ffrna2a,1580161793.0,"I mean, ESPN didn't post that video first off. T-Mac finished the story about Gigi playing then they ended the interview there. T-Mac has told a lot of stories on ESPN as well. They didn't just up and ask him for a story about Kobe.

It's not as cunning as y'all painting this to be."
nba,ffrnbbn,t1_ffrgvbq,1580161600.0,If you hated the man outside of basketball then you're already kind of a piece of shit.
nba,ffrn8ha,t3_euu1my,1580161553.0,"LeBron, Messi, CR7, Serena, Federer, Pacquiao?

Those are all global icons that have been in GOAT conversations in their own sport for at least a decade now. Beloved in their own rights."
nba,ffrmk9m,t1_ffrlixx,1580161145.0,"You think ESPN be twisting peoples' arms like that? Sure, they can be shitty but I doubt someone like Tracy can be pressured to doing something like this."
nba,ffrbv77,t1_ffqli4i,1580154827.0,"I feel like I have no choice and at that point, I just want to remember  the person I love as much as possible.

Talking about it helps. Whatever support that comes from it could also help."

nba,ffr4coi,t1_ffr3tsb,1580150184.0,That's what I'm implying. It's their fault. They were the most likely the source and most likely one of them got paid big.
nba,ffr3n2x,t3_euqu88,1580149740.0,Kinda your fault. How the fuck did TMZ know about it?
nba,ffr3hxa,t3_euqu88,1580149651.0,Someone post that gif of Woody Harrelson wiping his tears with $100 bills.
nba,ffq88fq,t3_euj4xe,1580125534.0,"> Gigi died en route to doing what she loved, but that does not make the loss of a child any easier.

This gives me some peace but haunts me for some reason. 

They were both on their way to do something they love. Gigi loved playing basketball and Kobe loved helping his kid play the sport he also loved.

It's beautiful but haunting at the same time. Damn."
nba,ffp9wz7,t1_ffp8slw,1580089810.0,It feels too heavy to move.
nba,ffp9ucr,t3_eubqdm,1580089758.0,"I still can't process this shit. I wasn't a big fan of Kobe during his career but I was always a fan of his work ethic & drive. I became a bigger fan of his after he retired. We finally got to see the more human side of Kobe and he was just as great as he was on the court.

This shit is just devastating. It feels just like when Michael Jackson and Robin Williams died. Iconic legends that I grew up with taken far too early. Why him, man..."

todayilearned,ffmeb00,t1_ffmbm5m,1580053269.0,The thread you're commenting on is about how to get artists paid and one person suggested buying CDs again.
todayilearned,ffm9zmx,t1_ffk8hmm,1580051166.0,And do you think the artists sees anything from that $2 you spent buying the CD used?

Why the fuck would they buy old tech when they could pay $10 a month and stream everything and do it anywhere they want.

It’s a solution but not even close to being an effective one."
todayilearned,ffk5gfl,t1_ffk4zci,1580016478.0,Just checked windows laptops and desktops on Bestbuy and a lot of them dont come with cd drives.
todayilearned,ffk5caf,t1_ffk4hom,1580016370.0,"That’s cool but you’re part of a very very small buying demographic.

Also, vinyls >>>>>>> cds.

Only way I’d buy a cd today is if they go the kpop route where they include a bunch of cool materials/memorabilia with it. It’s more of what comes with the CD than the CD."
todayilearned,ffk44u5,t1_ffk3mps,1580015246.0,"Let's be real. Who the fuck is going to do that in 2020?

A lot of computers don't even have cd drives anymore."
gadgets,ffk3mcm,t1_ffij8eh,1580014780.0,"Because their current Macbook lines & iPad Pro line already uses USB-C for power and data.

It's just their phone and a few iPads that still uses Lightning. Why not go all in on USB-C?"

Same as the PS3. When BluRay players were hitting $1000, that $600 console was a great deal."
