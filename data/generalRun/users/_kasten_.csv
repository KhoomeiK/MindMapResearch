Prostitution indicates a willingness to engage in illegal activity for monetary gain. The same is true of blackmail, which your reply curiously overlooked, though it, too, was mentioned in the Wikipedia article.

TraditionalCatholics,fc66tcr,t3_eg6st3,1577473591.0,">So my question is: is what I've been told about the Jewish religion changing correct,...

Yes. In summary, the events after Jesus death (most notably, the insurrection leading to the destruction of the Second Temple) wiped out many of the factions of Judaism (the temple-oriented Sadducees, Essenes, Zealots, etc.) so that Pharisees, previously only one of many schools, [became the de-facto gatekeepers of Judaism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharisees). (Most of the rest -- the majority -- presumably became Christians, or eventually, Muslims). Some historians (e.g. Botticini and Eckstein, for one heavily economics-centered example) credit the rise of the Pharisees as a key factor in transforming the remaining Jews from a largely agrarian people (like the Samaritans who have remained mostly-agrarian to this day) into an anomalously urban and literate society of skilled laborers/craftsmen/businessmen (including their more controversial spread into moneylending and tax-farming -- positions where their higher literacy rates would make for a big advantage).

Brant Pitre has some useful insights into how Christianity retained many temple-related rituals (previously a vital aspect of Judaism) as part of the liturgy  that ""Jews"" discarded (since it was the Saduccees who in Roman times were the school entrusted with running the temple, and they were rivals of the Pharisees).
