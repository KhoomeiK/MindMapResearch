videos,ff2uyau,t1_ff2kfy7,1579525172.0,"CS applies to a wide range of industries. So demand and pay varies quite a bit.

Also, there are traditional pipelines that make starting your career a lot easier. If you go to a well known school, you're going to land internships pretty easily, even from really competitive employers. And if you have one or two solid internships under your belt, getting an offer before you even graduate is easy.

What's more tricky is if you don't attend a well-known program. If it's a decent program, then you probably have alumni already working for at least one large employer. So you target internships with those employers. Once you've got the internship, coming from a lesser known school doesn't really matter.

But if you don't do any programming outside of class and then try to get hired on directly from an unknown program, then you'll probably need to accept below market wages in a high demand field like web dev."

So if I've shown interest in death metal videos, then it will try to show me other videos that have proven popular in that demographic. But it can't overly cater to what it already knows I like, because that will bore me, so it's going to try to figure out what non-death-metal videos I'll also like.

With social and political videos, it knows that the most inflammatory videos get the most traction and interaction.

worldnews,fenf3rd,t1_fenc16p,1579283330.0,"That's rather extreme.

Bezos should pay way more taxes, and we need greater income equality and more progressive taxes so we don't rely on the benevolence of people like Musk, Gates, etc. for basic infrastructure and economic stability. And we also need better regulation and trust-busting to curtail the increasing amounts of political and economic power that the super-wealthy have accumulated.

But terrorism is not the solution. You can't solve systemic sociopolitical problems with violence. If you kill someone like Bezos, someone else will just replace him—and that someone will be more guarded, more paranoid, and probably do much more harm. That's basically how a bunch of dictators became so radicalized and repressive."

Your name, address, age, email, etc. were most likely obtained through public records and data brokers (including the major credit agencies and free sweepstakes, both online and in retail locations).

The way Google and Facebook monetize your data is more akin to magazine publishers. Instead of selling contact info and user profiles to advertisers, they sell targeted ad space. It still lets advertisers market to a targeted demographic, but unless I click on an ad, they don't actually know who I am and what my interests are.

It's still problematic in a lot of ways (esp. when microtargeting and content promotion algorithms are weaponized for political manipulation), but it's not like you can just pay Facebook millions of dollars and they hand you a database of user dossiers.

When that sort of info does get extracted, it's usually a hack or requires users granting FB permission to an app. And, again, the specific type of info you listed comes from sources that people rarely hear/complain about."
