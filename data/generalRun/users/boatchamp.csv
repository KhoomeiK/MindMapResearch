socialanxiety,fd084e4,t3_ejhwwi,1578115054.0,"I have a similar issue and situation. Can’t say I have a solution but I found that putting in twice the effort into prepping for the call has helped making my “anxious voice” less noticeable. I still crumble if I get caught off guard or don’t stick the landing, but hey it’s a start I guess"
socialanxiety,fd05alz,t1_fcyiexp,1578113834.0,"I did this a few years back for the very same reason and couldn’t have gone better. The first day was very tough. Having to ask for directions in a second language was scary af and getting yelled at for not contacting the landlord before my arrival at the flat definitely didn’t help.. but then came the second day and the pure excitement of just being in a new country almost took over those fears and with the realization that any potential social miscues wouldn’t get tracked back to anyone I knew back home, it became much easier for me. It was a great experience, you could even say it was a personal milestone. I’ve continued to intentionally travel solo in hopes to continue this self development. 

If you’re having doubts, please consider taking that leap. I spent a few weeks abroad and although it’s didn’t “fix” me in any way, I came back with at least the optimism that progress with my SA can actually be possible. 

OP, I’m glad it’s been a great trip so far!! Sounds like you’ve been doing well! Best wishes."
