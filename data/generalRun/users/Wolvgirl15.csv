worldnews,ffwe7g9,t1_ffw5qqt,1580297557.0,"Have you ever seen two males fight? Now imagine that on a scale of 500 in the same space. 

The shredder is a gruesome thought and I honestly don’t like it either but you also have to think logically about it. As a very emotional person this is odd to say but sometimes you have to set feelings aside and look at how everything actually works. There sadly isn’t really much else to do about it. If the world worked on a “I don’t like this so stop it” level then it would be great but sadly it doesn’t.

I don’t think you can stop the killing of male chicks unless you stop the chicken industry as a whole or MASSIVELY downscale to such small farms that it won’t be able to provide anything of significance for the consumers. Even the farms might kill male chickens themselves because of the first thing I mentioned. It has always happened in farming but now it’s just happening on a very big scale because of how the industry works."
worldnews,ffwdqzn,t1_ffw4trf,1580296983.0,There are a lot of things wrong with feeding animals in a cannibalistic way. Look up the potential illnesses that can be caused by eating your own kind unless you are literally born to do so.

It’s definitely a good idea but yeah if you’re not already making broth for something else then it’s gonna get expensive. Most pet stores sell bottles of oil with a pump. 

Also, if you have a cat with bad digestion and they need to gain weight then you can also get lambs fat. It stinks but it’s very very good for them if they need a lot of extra calories. Lambs fat/oil and salmon oil are two different fats. It’s just like for us humans! We are supposed to eat a lot of fish too to get those good fats!"

It’s worth a try! If not then the water can help too. It softens the food faster but it also doesn’t exactly add much flavor.

A thing you Could try if you want more good in them to maybe make them shut up would be to water sprinkle some water with a diffuser/spray bottle or get some salmon oil to put on the dry food. It will help soften the food up a tiny bit and the salmon oil will make it super tasty (if they like fish of course).

My fiancé has a very old dog with horrible teeth. I suggested he used salmon oil to also help with her fur and now she’s eating much better and get fur is amazing.

There are spiders like the tarantula that literally grows these hooks on their front legs so they can wrestle the female and hold her out of striking range. 

It very much depends on the spider or insects in general you look at but yes. Their world is very unforgiving.

insanepeoplefacebook,fft7y9r,t1_ffst00q,1580211530.0,"So a little girl gets horribly raped and gets pregnant. You think she should have to very likely die?

Let me make it even more real.

A couple with very unstable income. She’s on birth control and he uses a condom but she still becomes pregnant against the odds. She won’t be able to take care for this baby financially, let alone hospital bills if it’s in the US. Depending on the people it could ruin both parents lives, split them apart, and the chance of the child growing up in less than ideal situation is very likely and will very likely suffer from it greatly! You could even throw in the chance that the child is special needs which is even more financial straining.

You are really okay with potentially ruining 1 or more already functioning lives just to put another one on earth who will most likely grow up in poverty and suffer from the fact that they were very unwanted

**OR** maybe we could just leave the procreation to the couples and parents who are willing and ready to bring children into the world. Leave it to the people who are actually able to support a child. If we did that then we could probably see a lot of horrible statistics in the world go down."

One day me and a group of people got into the subject of slow laptops and she started complaining about hers being very very slow. I told her to show me her laptop at school and dear lord almighty the abuse I saw. The amount of trash installed, plugins and 3 malfunctioning anti viruses. On top of that she never turns it off, it’s on all the time, the closest it would ever go is sleep mode and the rare moment when windows forced a restart. She had Firefox open when she showed me and i wouldn’t even count how many tabs this girl had open. Probably close to 70 if that’s even possible. 

It was all around bad. I told her that if she wanted to actually enjoy the laptop she had I would gladly try and fix it a bit, clean out some malware and get her something of a proper anti virus. She then hit super defensive like how dare I think I knew better than her. This was her laptop and she will not let anyone touch it.
