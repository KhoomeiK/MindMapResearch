gaybros,ff4ff6p,t1_ff4d0ej,1579562315.0,I think it’s an oppressor-class thing per se; it just feels like this kind of fetishization of the “weaker” group.
gaybros,ff4azes,t3_erkq3r,1579559407.0,"I think what the other commenters might be missing is the idea that a white guy is only attracted to people of color. There’s a kind of weird racial power thing going on, like imagine some het-bro who exclusively dates Asian women. Not everyone is interested in thinking through these issues, but let’s try to use perspective and mentalizing when considering these things that feel like nothing but have more profound meaning for other people."

Sino,fesevyw,t3_eqhwu9,1579364483.0,Lol the reason is the foreclosing is outside sources of information and the suckling on the soon-to-be dry teat of economic expansion. People vote (so to speak) their economic interests

Lithium,fei57dp,t3_epa8uo,1579130541.0,"Were you diagnosed w/ Li toxicity? I'm so sorry you had such a nightmare experience. But there is a difference between the feelings and effects you describe and being literally ""toxic"" on lithium (happens when you overdose or your kidneys fail). If you were never physically toxic on Li then I would imagine there should be no long-term effects. Consult your shrink, of course, but it sounds like you just had a really bad experience because of the wrong drug and PTSD, which is a terrible thing to deal with. Again, you had a really rough time, but hopefully it was only a psychological and not also a physical experience. Even if you had been literally toxic, though, it's unlikely that it would have significant long-term consequences."
gay,fei44ws,t3_epa1o2,1579129869.0,"Man middle school SUCKS. All I can say to comfort you is that this is a universal experience, gay or straight (or etc). From the perspective of this aged queer (nearly 33 yo!), I want to say, It gets better! You’ll think back on this period in your life and laugh! But, I am trying to be fair to your immediate experience: right now school is most of your world and that world is increasingly confusing, scary, and stimulating of all emotions. So what is to be done? I won’t give specific relationship advice, because my romantic life in middle school was a solo affair. Generally tho I would try to remember that the world really is much bigger than your school, and stumbles or outright failures in middle school only feel mortifying in the moment. Your life really will change, and quickly, but there’s a lot of bullshit to put up with first. Good luck!"
WhitePeopleTwitter,fehuinv,t3_ep8are,1579124131.0,Great reason to help bring on four more years of the most exquisitely sensitive and nuanced thinker on Native American issues to hold the office of president since Andrew Jackson. Never forget that neither great man ever claimed to have Indian ancestry!

gay,fegexso,t3_ep1i5d,1579090431.0,Blood work does not automatically include STI screening unless you’re on eg prep which requires it every three months. If you ask they can easily add STI when you’re having other bloods drawn.
