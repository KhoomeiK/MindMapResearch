The fact that we don't feel the effects of centrifugal force due to Earth's rotation is that its radius is so large that it amounts to almost zero (actually it's about 0.003g).

classicalguitar,ffev9pz,t1_ffer2pi,1579867036.0,"> Under the sound hole nearest to the neck I have a bolt which I assume can be tightened and loosened using a wrench. I think this is the truss rod, not sure what else it could be.

Yep, that has to be a truss rod. It's interesting because truss rods are not standard at all in classical guitars.

> Is there another reinforcement you mean near the neck?

The mos usual way to reinforce a classical guitar is adding a [piece of ebony along the neck](https://s14-eu5.startpage.com/cgi-bin/serveimage?url=http:%2F%2Fultimate-guitar-building.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fclassicalneck.jpg&sp=0dfffd5e7a67b171446852c1b622649a). You've probably seen it a hundred times and just thought it was an ornament (ok, sometimes a black line is painted in guitar necks as an ornament).

In any case, if you guitar has a truss rod I'd use any strings you like designed for classical guitars, no matter the tension.

> I don't usually care about more sound because I'm playing for myself almost exclusively. Sustain and tone quality are probably the most important.

 In that case I guess trying carbon and nylon is a good idea. BTW, many guitar players use different material for each strings. For example, nylon on the first and carbon on third and fourth. But this is probably way too professional, and for sure if depends a lot of the player's taste and the guitar itself."
classicalguitar,ffeq9cs,t1_ffe3xx4,1579860097.0,Did your change the brand or type of strings. Maybe your new strings are more sensitive to temperature changes.
classicalguitar,ffepi7m,t3_et6sj6,1579858949.0,"My concern with using hard tension strings wouldn't be the bridge but the neck.

You talk about your truss rod, but I'm not sure if your guitar has this sort of reinforcement on the neck: https://www.musiciansfriend.com/guitars/washburn-c80s-madrid-classical-guitar

If you have a truss rod I'd use hard tension strings with no concern at all. Otherwise, I'd try to get info about how real tension on different brands (which is an info that not all customers provide).

On the other hand, depending on your own taste, your guitar and your repertoire, you probably can feel more a difference changing the type of string (nylon or carbon) than changing the tension. More tension will (most of all) give ""more"" sound, but the difference between nylon and carbon heavily influences the sound of the instrument. So to say, carbon gives you more bright, while nylon produces a nicer sound."

AskPhysics,fdxwj3x,t1_fdxlt6x,1578773635.0,"> Ohhh but the object at first endures no forces so it's inertia should be equal to 0 right ?

Not at all. Mass is an intrinsic property of matter. Unless you want to make a philosophical discussion about it, but I don't think this is the point of your post.

> An object that doesn't endure a force can't have a gravitationnal mass and therefore doesn't have an inertial mass ?

Objects have gravitational and inertial mass no matter what."
AskPhysics,fdxllg7,t1_fdxkx9z,1578770187.0,"When you try to move an object, its inertia is pretty relevant; the more mass (so more inertia) it has, the harder to move it. When an object is falling, Earth is ""trying"" to move the object, so that's why inertia is relevant."
AskPhysics,fdxkbnj,t3_enap5q,1578769627.0,"On the one hand, the more mass an object has, the stronger is its attraction to the Earth (AKA, its weight).

On the other hand, the more mass an object has, the larger is its inertia, so the larger is its tendency to not vary its movement; it's harder to move (or to stop) a massive object than a light one.

So we have these two aspects of mass; the gravitational side, and the inertial side. So when an object is falling, the gravitational side of mass goes for falling faster, since the gravitational force is larger. But on the other hand, its inertia is larger, so it's harder to accelerate it. 

The ting is, these two effects just compensate perfectly, and the inertial and gravitational masses are just exactly the same, and that's why two objects fall at the same speed no matter their masses."
