Engineering in antiquity is something else of course and those were some pretty ingenious people. Still, the average person wasn't doing algebra. Just doing what he had always been doing. 

And while the buildings of antiquity are remarkable in their seeming eternity, there's a reason why modern buildings aren't built like that anymore. They have ridiculous safety factors because the ancient engineers didn't have the know how to build them more efficient. Building an aqueduct or bridge that lasts millenia is impressive, but really overkill.

Most likely we will reduce meat intake by a lot and go further and further into vegetarianism. With lab brown meat thrown in there (also made from plant protein). 

Just makes the most sense from an energy perspective. Why use plant material to feed bugs if you can just eat the plants yourself and save a huge percentage of the energy? We will still have some stuff we don't want to eat, some garbage, that ends up in animal feed, or we find a way to sequester it and make cheap food out of it.

They had my big sister while still going through the early hell of the job (end of studies, residency) and she was practically raised by the village. Passed around from friend to friend together with another child. Whoever was available to babysit for a few days. 

When I was born, this mellowed itself out a little bit but I still remember being handed around and my sister basically raised me after we moved away from that close band of friends. I remember one evening in particular where I was crying from some fever or something and my sister was completely overwhelmed. My parents were at some concert so she grabbed my hand and we walked to the concert hall. With me crying all the way and being absolutely exhausted. When we arrived they were pissed and my sister to take me back home. So we cried our way back home. 

We grew up sort of emotionally detached, though my perception might be influenced by me being a bit of a special kid. 

They did read to me every night and taught me to read before school. My kindergarten was awesome. They also made sure to always go on vacation together and we spent a lot of time hiking, camping, in kayaks, visiting museums and such. This became a thing every weekend when I got older and my father moved up the ladder. We also ate dinner together when I was in school. 

Still, we only played boardgames once, never watched TV together and were always somewhat estranged.

Point still stands though. This is proven to have been the beauty standard for young women. And older women sometimes liked to portray themselves the same way.

The stark contrast between missions in India (around Goa mostly), South America and Africa compared to China and Japan was remarkable. And I came out with a real respect for the Jesuits. Them adapting to local customs, showing leniency and respecting the existing culture. They even made concessions around mass and such; also very active in learning and translating all sorts of local dialects. All in the name of the mission, but reading their letters made me think that there was an incredible drive to learn above all else. 

And then they got fucked by fundamentalist orders who demanded strict adherence to dogma and everything fell apart.

history,ff9srll,t1_ff9168p,1579720451.0,"While it wasn't complete isolation, it was certainly something that did happen. 

Let's take the Mission to China for example. In the late 16th century the Jesuits started to try and bring Christianity to China. They had already been active in India and Japan but it was even harder in China. Especially as they weren't allowed to travel the country. So they did their converting around Macau and had some success. 

Because the Jesuits were cartographers, astronomists, mathematicians, painters and linguists, they finally managed to gain entry into the court of the Chinese Emperor. Not as missionaries primarily, but as foreign experts invited to exchange knowledge. They did a bunch of missionary work but most of their time was spent painting or with scientific discourse. They became employees and sort of prisoners. All very much different from how missionary work usually worked (with Europeans dictating the terms). 

It was only the Jesuits though that gained this access. Other orders like the Dominican or Benedictines weren't allowed entry as they refused to accommodate to local rites and customs. They were also much more interested in converting from the bottom up rather than top down like the Jesuits who focused on converting local elites. 

This accomodation led to heavy disputes in Europe and the Pope finally banned the practise. The Chinese Emperor was pissed and kicked everyone but his favourite Jesuits out of his realm. Those few stayed and continued their work but missionary work was stopped and the mission to China was effectively over. 

What made China so different (also Japan to a certain degree) was how well organised and ruled those places were. The European missionaries couldn't dictate terms like they could elsewhere as they were so incredibly far from Europe and a few ships weren't enough to subdue the locals. Because of how centralised the power was, it was also harder to play local rulers against each other. And lastly, the difference in scientific and ""civilised"" process wasn't that great or perceived as such, so it was actually the Chinese who thought themselves superior to the Europeans. So less reason to give up their own culture and religion for something foreign and powerless."

Had definitely difficulties getting into it as my parents and grandparents were strictly against it. Against most forms of fun, really. Only reading was encouraged. 

I spent all my time at my friend's place and because of his brother we had two Gameboys and both Pokémon red and blue. We would play that or take turns playing on the computer while the other watched / trash talked or played Ninja Turtles or Mario on gameboy. Then he got a second computer and we played Diablo 2 and strategy games together. 

It took forever to get my own computer and when I finally did, it took even longer to get any games. My parents didn't get me any and there was no store in our hometown. So I asked my grandparents and they got me my own copy of Age of Empires. I was ecstatic! My grandpa installed it on his pc and we started playing together. All was well until some AI dude with a club came and smashed my villager's head in. This was much too violent for my grandpa and he asked me if this was really what I had wanted. Of course it was! ... is what I was thinking. But I didn't want to disappoint this legend of a person so I clutched my pearls and voiced my disappointment in the lowly state of games. We returned the game and I was a heart broken little boy. 

For the next few years I was playing whatever I was able to borrow from friends and all the demos and free games from magazines. 

Then a few years later, I was ready to finally have my own copy of Diablo 2. I wanted to play online with my friend. Had my aunt buy it for me but my parents intercepted it, looked at the description and pictures and asked me if this was *really* what I had wished for. Little pussy that I was, I said that it was a mistake and it was again returned. 

Then came steam and I spent all my money on finally getting games! Freedom at last. 

Though there was another battle to let me buy a new computer. From my own saved money and at a really low price. No super game rig or anything. But my parents didn't think I should get one. And didn't let me buy one until I begged and begged. And thus my 128mb RAM Win95 piece of shit was replaced by glorious 2GB RAM and stuff and I was able to actually play all those steam games.

Best friend and I were allowed to skip computer classes and work on the layout and editing instead. Unsupervised in a separate room with admin access for 90min a week while out classmates were learning word art and how to type. It was glorious.

Before we figured how best to abuse our privilege they took away our admin access. But they had instead given us access to all the teachers' personal files. Lots of pictures of drunken teachers at Christmas parties. Or personal letters (which we didn't read, we were very timid little nerds). But the best was the folder filled with pictures of donkey porn. Yes. Donkey porn... Close ups of donkey penises, donkey asses (ass asses?), donkey on donkey action. This was what stopped our snooping. 
Years later we learned that the teacher, whose folders we had found those pictures in, was a hobby donkey breeder and it must have been research.

totalwar,fextog3,t1_few0zqp,1579435900.0,"I loved the way it worked in MTW2. Cities had garrison ""slots"" that gave free upkeep for certain units with buildings giving more of those. So you would slowly build up a garrison of your own choosing. 

This also gave quite a bit of flexibility in terms of reserve forces. Your war going bad and running out of men, or the enemy breaking through your defenses? Just gather those militias and fight back. But at the risk of destabilising your lands and having to build up the garrisons again afterwards. 

Only issue was the added micromanagement but there could be ways to automate it.

Instead it's this insane ritual of all the security procedures that lead to endless waiting, having to come ridiculously early to account for possible delays, the airports being designed to accommodate all that theater. 

Obviously some more security is needed for planes but the whole process is so damn bloated. Do we really need to take off our shoes, belt, put all our stuff on a tray, get fondled? Also having to have them check your bags and possibly taking out certain items. The whole liquids thing etc. It's just insane.

In general, as someone who has played almost exclusively on pc for decades, what annoys me the most about consoles and the way they have influenced game design, is the limited number of buttons. Just add more programmable buttons to it! That part in the middle where the select and start things are, just throw in a bunch of extra buttons. Or put more on the face (over the 4 on the right maybe?). In addition to those on the back of course. 

And then design games with more buttons in mind. Maybe make better use of holding one button to enable multiple functions on others as well. 

Just so annoying to have games limited (also on pc) to a few actions because there aren't enough damn buttons on the controller."

Same with henchmen getting shot vs actual characters. Henchman gets shot anywhere and he's instantly out. Character can get shot multiple times and still do the heroic last stand. 

In reality after a gruesome firefight you would have people moaning or crying on the ground, some in shock, others still a threat from the ground. Some dragging themselves across the room, shouting for their mothers. People making horrible noises from their punctured lungs, gasping for air and such.

Yeah, they're incapacitated but they're not peaceful and quietly dead. 

Same with our hero's friend who get left behind or die in the field. They don't close their eyes after saying their goodbyes, letting our hero continue on with new determination. They are probably slowly and painfully dying while begging for help. Death coming hours later.

Seems like film makers think bullets are poisonous or something and if you don't take them out immediately they kill the victim. Anything else doesn't matter.
