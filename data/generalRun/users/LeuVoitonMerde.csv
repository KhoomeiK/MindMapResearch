RPI,fedp8me,t3_eohfu4,1579016909.0,"I took AI & Society last semester with Dr. Noble and Professor Si. The *topics* in the class were quite interesting, and I enjoyed lecture, to an extent, but found that the assignments were extremely varied in difficulty. Many were trivial, but a couple were nearly impossible without consulting youtube tutorials for several hours. Ended up with an A- in the class, as those 2? hard assignments weren't much of the grade. I'd say, overall, it was an easy A, but due to the large number of trivial assignments, not especially academically rewarding."

todayilearned,fedmz3a,t1_fedm2vq,1579015462.0,"CE stands for Common Era. Since Anno Domini and Before Christ are both religious terms, and perhaps more importantly, inaccurate descriptions for the change from BCE to CE, modern terms CE and BCE were coined. (Jesus was almost certainly not born exactly 2020 years ago)

&#x200B;

Oh, and BCE stands for before Common Era."

todayilearned,fcl18t0,t1_fchnr79,1577737613.0,"I generally use shorter mortgages when possible, to minimize the negative aspects of borrowing. If I were to use a 20 year mortgage as example instead, it would be something like 4000$ a year in mortgage, which would only make the 3200$ in taxes a larger chunk, so I'm not sure how my unusually short mortgage example benefits your point?

Additionally, I did not claim that government is bad, only that 3200$ in taxes yearly on a 70,000 house seems high, which is relevant to the comment I replied to. 

Finally, out of curiousity, do you mean a 230,000 mortgage, or a mortgage on a 230,000 house? 7400 a year seems low for a 230,000 mortgage. (For readers, 7400$/year would take more than 30 years to equal 230,000, even if interest rate was 0%)"
