Hyperhidrosis,fedgcgs,t3_eoilnl,1579010778.0,"Yes but I am here for a good time not a long time. Okay just kidding but it doesn’t really bother me as much anymore. I take oxybutynin and it kinda made my life 100x better. My hands and feet are now dry 24/7. The dry mouth is very manageable too, I’d say not half as bad as glyco. I feel as though I can finally live my life normally like everyone else."

TellMeAFact,fd509kh,t3_ejyol1,1578172867.0,"I had a sleep paralysis/nightmare a few months ago when I was back in my home country for a holiday. A lady was right next to me in the bed, I was in sleeping in foetal position. She started creeping up on me and chanting gibberish words right next to my ear and I could not move at all. I ended up singing the chorus of Whitney’s rendition of I will always love you cos I didn’t know what else to do. Probably scared the shit out of her cos it woke me up. 

Last night terror I had, I was at my ex partner’s parents house. I was sleeping next to him. In my dream I woke up in exactly the same room, it looked pretty normal and thought I just woke up normally. I then found my ex standing right next to the door naked but could not recognise him in my dream. He was more of a stranger to me who’s trying to hurt me. Like  a doppelgänger. I was scared to death that I was screaming on top of my lungs. I woke up screaming too, loud enough to leave my throat sore. I woke up him up and his parents. They were puzzled. It’s the second time this happened when were still together. 

Last lucid dream I had, I found myself with my head stuck in a railing. I was naked and couldn’t free myself at all. Then I saw a Minotaur like person approaching towards me. He ended up fucking me and I liked it. I knew I was dreaming."

AskReddit,fcuyw24,t3_eixc75,1577991272.0,"Well it certainly worked for me in a way that I've met all the people I dated through dating apps. I think as a gay man, it's almost like a necessary evil because it's hard to meet other gay guys out there without using the app. I am not really into the gay scene, gay bars etc. don't really interest me. Last time I went to a gay club/bar, I was sexually assaulted so never again.

I recently got out a long-term relationship, around 2nd quarter of 2019. We were together for four years and met him through tinder, it's just didn't work in the end. He's got his own flaws but certainly a great man over all. After a few months out of the relationship, I gave online dating another go again. Downloaded Tinder again after like 4 years and I must say the atmosphere is completely different from what I remember. I wouldn't say I'm very attractive or anything but didn't really have a hard time getting matches. The problem is that when I try to talk to people they either not reply, ghost after a few days, or just not interesting at all. Had a few dates but nothing came out of them. I am used to it now and don't really think too much out of it."

Hyperhidrosis,fco3bxo,t3_ei83mf,1577823287.0,"Hi I’m on oxybutynin and it works for me, I think you just got to experiment to find the right dosage that works for you. I take it in the morning and evening. 5mg dosage at a time. It completely stopped me from sweating from my hands and feet. The dry mouth, in my experience, is very manageable. I’d rather that than really sweaty feet and hands. You just need to keep yourself hydrated otherwise you’d end up with a cotton mouth. Good luck!"

wholesomememes,fckrbe5,t1_fck8l1a,1577731504.0,"I think as long as you give your best, that's what matters in the end. Even if you didn't perform as well as you wanted, you at least know that you did everything that you could do. That itself is an accomplishment. Exams can be daunting, a lot of external factors can affect you (e.g. nerves etc) so be always kind to yourself. Good luck on your examinations and don't overwork yourself! Take care now."
BreakUps,fcg6gvu,t1_fcfqjza,1577636921.0,"Hi, you know it's perfectly normal to think this way. I did too, so I completely empathise with you. I blamed myself for everything that happened and thought that he's the perfect guy for me and that I will never find a guy like him again. You will, and likely someone much better than your ex because if you try your best to work on to be the best version of yourself, you will eventually attract someone better suited for you.

What you have to realise now is you cannot do anything to change the past but what you can change is your future by working on your present self. Hang in there, it's a very slow process especially if you two had a very special bond. You will encounter voids along the way, they will ache for sure but there will come a time that they will become mere fleeting thoughts once you're in a much better headspace; in which you have properly processed all the emotions and feelings you are experiencing. Feel all your emotions, let them wash over you, cry as much as you want. It's healthy.

I don't even have a partner right now, I put myself out there sure, but I'm not actively seeking someone anymore as I'd rather pursue things that matter the most to me right now. Such as pursuing the passions that I always wanted to do but did not have the time to do whilst I was still in a relationship. It's a breath of fresh air. It's liberating.

Take your time, day by day. If that seems impossible for you do it minute by minute. If you still can't do that, do it breath by breath. Try your best to still do things that you always love doing even if it's in an autopilot mode. You can do this, it's not the end of the world. You're stronger than you realise you are. Take care now. If you need someone to talk to, just DM me. x"
BreakUps,fcg3i7s,t3_eh5s1x,1577636178.0,"""The moment your world starts crumbling right before you, everyday must be an act of rebellion  
As for every sunset means a time spent fighting your battles  
And for every sunrise means another chance at winning your war""

It's been quite a few months already since my break-up, I'm much happier and at peace with myself now. You guys will reach this stage again even if your emotions/feelings say otherwise. Just always remember to take care of yourselves and surround yourselves with people who deeply care about you if possible. x"
