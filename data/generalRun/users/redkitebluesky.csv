So, not for looks (but none of them are, etc.) Anyway my purebred BC is 90% bright white (“white factored” I’ve read they’re called) and every few weeks someone will ask his breed and balk at the idea that he’s a border collie. “They’re supposed to be black!” No, they’re like the one breed that’s not *supposed* to be anything but clever as hell."

When I mentioned it to her, she said she forgot to put the bark collar on the dog. So that helped. When the battery runs out, it’s back, but at least it’s an improvement. I just feel bad that the dog clearly (imo) has attachment issues and is at home alone freaking the fuck out all day. :/"
