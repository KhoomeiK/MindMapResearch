nursing,fgr9vy1,t1_fgr42hh,1581041680.0,"We're talking about a sniff of levo, but yeah it something that has happened with more frequency lately (partly from charge taking advantage and partly because we run on the brink of surging all the time now). It's being brought forward to management."
nursing,fgptlvt,t1_fgppiho,1581011756.0,"Well, they were just ICU patients and we don't have a step down, so anywhere from 10 minutes to do a head to toe and vitals to an hour or more if they're still a bit acute and need workup, liase with MRP, meds, etc.
We see anywhere from 5-15 discharges, respond to floor nurse calls, start difficult IVs with U/S, and the charting is bloody endless. We do an ICU level head to toe  in free text on every patient + chart our visit statistics in another provincially mandated system + a brief blurb for the handover tool we use. It can easily take 30 minutes to document a 10 minutes follow up. Multiply it by x patients + consults + iv starts + meet with ICU doc to review patients and write suggestions and voila, no break.

I use the term rapid response because what we really do is called 'critical care outreach'. We do a lot of supporting new nurses who have trouble recognizing deteriorating patients, are the defacto IV team, have end of life discussions, wrangle the hospitalists if they're being useless and ignoring their clearly sick patients. Our team has become something of a dumping ground for lazy nurses and doctors and we have *very* loose calling criteria.  BP 85/55? Call outreach. Can't reach the hospitalist after a couple pages for someone not all that sick but needs something covered by our medical directives? Call outreach. The intensivist has a consult they don't feel is worth their attention? Call outreach.

Edit: the reason I ask how others cover their breaks is because our team is tired of this and looking for change and to shift responsibility back on the responsible parties (nurses and MDs) because we're being overextended for things that others should be tending to themselves."
nursing,fgpbbn0,t1_fgo9fdl,1581001267.0,"I don't have numbers in front of me but this program runs in about 30 hospitals across the province and has caused a decent decline in number of bounce backs, bounce backs who return as code blue and overall code blue, so the numbers support this practice.

We're about 400 beds"
nursing,fgpazno,t1_fgp3okt,1581001053.0,"This is how we normally run, if that person coded there would be a bed instantly. The charge nurses somewhat take advantage of our presence to make life easier for them"
nursing,fgo8ug2,t1_fgo853y,1580962680.0,"1. Yes this is our only responsibility

2. It varies from day to day. I call it rapid response but these are usually not imminently dying patients, the nurses utilize us for a whole list of criteria that qualifies their patient for a second pair of eyes.

3. Holy shit yes, we do spend our days placating new nurses.

4. The first 48 hours is when ICU patients are most likely to bounce back so we see them for that long. It really has made for less codes and facilitated managed bounce backs and prevented many bounce backs. Our program pays for itself many times over with the reduction in ICU stay days.

This is the province's description of [our program](https://www.criticalcareontario.ca/EN/StrategicInitiatives/Pages/Critical-Care-Response-Teams.aspx)

For a bit more context, if I get paged to see a patient, I work under medical directives to do most of a workup on the patient including x-rays, EKG, blood work, start fluids, meds, CPAP, pressors, etc on the floor. And work 1:1 with them until ICU takes them in transfer.  For example it took 4 hrs from initial consult until ICU had a bed ready to accept so I was stuck watching someone on pressors on the Zoll until that time. That's why I don't always get a break."

nursing,fgnp5i0,t1_fgnj3gp,1580949817.0,"We have the same thing, one from each sub-unit of our ICU but maybe 1/10 of our staff is trained in rapid response so it's unlikely they could cover.

I've had physicians passing by me ask to do a set of vital signs on someone because they didn't know how to use the blood pressure machine.
