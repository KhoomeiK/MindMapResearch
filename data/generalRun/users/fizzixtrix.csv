Sleepparalysis,ffkpfzi,t3_etu7fe,1580026605.0,"Yes like that it’s actually more spiritual and your brain when asleep is opening the gateways to interacting with the spirit dimension?! I had two close friends growing up that had SP and would see demons. As they grew older they became really interesting people regarding their spiritual beliefs, and for example, belief in extra terrestrials, and the connections between all of it. It seems like it’s all very real and not necessarily just hallucinations, but more so, experiencing the fringes of paranormal energies. Both of these friends have had lots of spooky stuff happen to them in their lives. And I just can’t help but believe everything they tell me. Both of them are staunchly honest people and I really do believe them. One believes she knows her entire past life (she can tell you crazy details of it) and that she has been sedated and abducted by aliens in her sleep sometimes, because they sense her connection to the otherworldly. And this is all stemming from, that both of them grew up seeing demons in their rooms as children. The stories are bone-chilling to me.

Techno,ff44g7l,t3_ere3xn,1579555321.0,"Naps all the way! If I (32F) plan to do a 3am techno party and expect to see sunrise, then I am for sure sleeping cozy in bed from 10pm-2am. Besides, those hours are prime time for the wild drunk idiots, so I prefer to use my energy reserves later on in the night once the main crowd has fizzled out and the real heads come out to play... 

If I can’t fully fall asleep for a pre-techno nap (from excitement!), I’ll still just lay in the dark still and meditate in bed, under the covers etc. The benefits of this seem to be that (a) it helps keep a semi-regulated sleep schedule where you can easily still jump back into the 9-5 because you are still keeping a habit of sleeping 10pm, and (b) your body is as freshly rested as it would be after any regular sleep stint, so you’re not entering techno at a physical deficit from the stresses of day life (phone screen, hunch, sitting, audio stimuli, talking etc). Any 9-5 job makes your body tense up in weird ways, so just the simple shape of laying down in bed (totally naked is best for circulation!) for a few hours allows a lot of tensions to be released, making you less likely to feel aches once you’re out. Helps your eyes rest so you have better night vision with lasers. Helps rest your ears so they can regulate techno sounds better, etc etc. 10/10


Naps, plus drinking as much water as possible, and also stretching! Stretching before a good techno party can work wonders. Neck, back, hamstrings, feet... You never think stretching does much, but it can help your back and feet hold up better over long periods of time, just by getting some muscles stretched out the right way. Drinking water before/during/after stretching and naps can work wonders on your body’s longevity for techno parties. 

All of this allows me to party and dance with zero stimulants!

All of it is a way to make sure that they can successfully keep you walking on eggshells, and to also make sure they always have “reasons” to abuse you. Another phrase to describe it is “changing goalposts” and it’s very much the same thing as the “switch and bait”.

You probably are still suffering the remnants of stress from that relationship and feeling anxiety about everything: Is she really a Narc, was I crazy, why didn’t she even Hoover me, etc etc, but even this phase is totally normal.

But yeah don’t let your guard down quite yet, she may Hoover you any time for any reason that you won’t know of.

NarcissisticAbuse,fefffy4,t3_eotd00,1579055197.0,"First I was cut off by a Nex, before I knew about Narcissists and their abuse/patterns. I had never in my life dreamed of cutting someone off. Felt so cruel. I was devastated and mentally unstable trying to understand this.

Then I had some more Nexes, learned the real lessons, and properly cut them off on my own. At first it was really difficult, because it was totally new for me to assert this type of extreme boundary, and stick to it... But over time I was validated that it was the right thing to do. It brought me peace, and much-needed empty space. I learned how powerful and healthy cutting off bad energy can be.

Now, I instantly cut off people showing signs of true Narcissism, and it’s a really empowering skill to have, because you’ll never stop encountering new ones, unfortunately. I’ve probably cut out 30 or so people from my entire life by now, by my mid-30s. A combination of “friends”, coworkers, ex-bosses, ex-boyfriends, and all the flying monkeys too... I cut off a “best friend” of 10 years, and also acquaintances of 3 months... Whoever shows me they need the boot, gets the boot. So easy now.

Baby steps. If you’re just noticing you’re entwined with Ns, there are long-standing patterns you’ve had in your life that will likely lead to exposure of many other more covert Ns popping up from the past, present, or in the future still. They are not uncommon.

electricdaisycarnival,feep5x6,t1_feecllp,1579038299.0,"Tbh I would only take a few pills that you know you’ll need/want/use, and hide them well as if they are contraband. I know of an... experience... where someone I know had a few antidepressants, adderrall and anti-anxiety meds (previously prescribed to them!) all in a tiny carrying tin that they carried around with them in case of emergency. It was like, two of each pill, that they kept from a few years prior. Didn’t even use them anymore but kept them because why throw away something you might legitimately need? Well one time a cop searched them (claiming they smelled like weed, and that gave them the right to do a full search), and found it all, and instantly sent them to jail for multiple felonies. A felony for each pill itself and an additional felony for having each pill in “an unmarked container”. Really did them in, just to be an asshole. Pretended they didn’t know that these were real medicines and not like, ecstasy pills or something. I want to say one of the pills was Zoloft, and even that garnered two felonies!! Crazy unfair.


Anyway, not that it would be that extreme for you but it could be, if found by the wrong cop who just wanted marks on their belt. There are so many undercovers at EDC, and I even know of one in real life who spends the whole year learning how to blend in with ravers and appear as an actual raver, lingo and vibes and everything. But nope she is 100% an undercover Narc who specifically targets people for pills. Technically adderrall is schedule one, up there with cocaine and meth, so they’ll make your life very hard if they find it on you unmarked or expired. 


Basically just be ultra careful, treat it like you’re sneaking in ecstasy. I would recommend to just take the prescription bottle with you on your trip to prove ownership, but not to the actual event, as that might draw more attention to it than if a few pills were just hidden, you know? And you might get a security guard who notices the expiration date, which, if law enforcement sees, they can arrest you for. I also would not recommend fudging the date because that’s also a felony if somehow found.

Once in a while I’ll send a selfie to my mom (long distance) but besides that, someone getting a selfie from me is suuuuper personal. Not sure if it has anything to do with specifically being Demi, but it’s possible. The big association with selfies is that they are used “for attention” on social media, or are narcissistic, or often used as “thirst traps”, or even as potential blackmail if they are in the sexy/sexual range... It could just be that she has all of those associations strongly rooted in her mind and doesn’t see a point to partake in selfie culture. I had to learn on my own to take selfies for “myself” and occasionally a loved one, but it was a deprogramming, away from the social norms of what selfies usually are. If you don’t see a point to them, it feels super weird/fake to take one just to send to someone who asks. I have had other friends/SOs who feel this way too about sending selfies.

I dunno probably none of this helps but just typing out loud about some thoughts regarding this. I know in the past I regretted sending selfies to exes once I wasn’t with them anymore. For your gal, it could be combo of personality traits related to Demi, but not necessarily just being Demi, plus societal norms etc, all making a complex aversion to sending you a selfie, without her thinking of it much at all."
NarcissisticAbuse,feeesxq,t1_feec4p4,1579032277.0,"Yep totally. “He can’t tell whatever false stories he tells” is spot-on.

I had a different Nex (self-proclaimed sociopath actually!) do a weird thing at a music festival where, we drove hours to go camping together at this big festival in the woods, totally my jam. He acted so excited and told everyone and all this jazz, and then as SOON as we got there, all of a sudden everything was bad. His nose was running, then his back hurt so I had to pitch the tent for us, then all of sudden he had altitude sickness, then he didn’t even like the music... never-ending. He said the people were weird, he said he couldn’t sleep, he basically just couldn’t “exist” there on this setting. We ended up leaving after only 10 hours (!) because he was just awful to be around, and I wondered, how could he even be so miserable in this beautiful setting? But in hindsight, he just wasn’t able to wear his masks and tell false stories there. He was held TOO accountable in this setting, just by the nature of being there (with me). Accountable for our livelihood (camping), accountable for personality (making friends, enjoying my company) etc etc and he couldn’t do it. He got fake illnesses because it was too far beyond him to remain consistent in this setting.

Sure enough, within minutes of us awkwardly leaving, now that we were isolated again, under his control, he was suddenly back to his normal high-energy self, and literally FORGOT about his nose/back/altitude sickness when I asked how he was suddenly feeling so much better. It was weird like he actually did get physically sick just from having the social pressures to be a normal happy person in this setting where he couldn’t control/manipulate with personas. Wild creatures!"
NarcissisticAbuse,fee0v6x,t3_eomh2s,1579024051.0,"Yes and no: I can vouch that when I go to music events solo (which I have for many years) I do meet new friends and have adventures, and that it’s 100% because I’m alone that these situations even come to fruition. The moment I am with another friend or SO, the more wild&free scenarios don’t “find me” as much. A couple together at a music event is very boring and the more wild people will ignore anyone who looks like a couple. Ive even had couples try to hang out with me because I am alone and look fun being solo, so they’ll kind of take that as a cue to come hang with me, and I kind of avoid them because they just don’t have the right energy, and it’s 100% because of their couple-ness. I’ve never once had couples present in any of my most fun, “out there” experiences at festivals. It just doesn’t happen. So as annoying as it might be to acknowledge that, it’s a real thing, he might genuinely not have the same experiences with you around him.

That being said!! Of course he is probably also exaggerating. But, he may also be acting like a completely different person when alone too. So he may actually have all of these friends and experiences, when he is wearing a different mask at these events, and the mask he wears with you when you attend with him, is not a mask that gets him any attention/friends. I’ve noticed this with a few Ns before, that without me around they will suddenly become these wild personalities like almost a comic or character, just for the sake of needing to be surrounded with attention from others. And they’re good at it, so when they step into that role, it does work. They get a million photos with a super huge smile and a bunch of happy “new friends”. But then later if I’m with them, they can’t get away with that same persona, it just doesn’t work, because I see through it. I’ve caught a N trying their “fun” persona out accidentally in front of me and it was unsettlingly bizarre to witness. They turned it off very quickly when I didn’t engage how they were hoping/expecting. It was like, they were used to being the life of the party on their own and wanted to try it out on me to see if it would work, and it didn’t, so they became their “normal” self again (the self they show me). It’s very weird!!

TL:DR; Yes they are being Narcy but there might be other stuff there to consider!"
demisexuality,fedyxe1,t3_eogj3d,1579022826.0,"Totally. Making out is useless to me now. I suppose when I was younger I would performatively partake in kissing as the first step to other things, but at some point I became too annoyed at kissing in general. I don’t want to taste your spit. Why does anyone? It does the opposite of arouse me, so if sex is on the table, the kissing will make me cringe and not want sex anymore. 

Everyone thinks they are a great kisser and that their spit is sexy. I’ve had too many convos about this. Me: I’m sorry I just feel gross exchanging the spit of the dinner we each just ate. Them: But the spit is hot, that’s what’s hot! Me: Thank u, next. Like how would someone else’s spitty bacteria/old food chunks being forcefully swirled into my mouth, plus cold spit all over my face from the sloppiness, be in any way shape or form a sexual arousal? No clue.

The older I get, the less I understand the fascination with sloppy kissing as somehow foreplay to sex. Even in movies it comes across as fake to me now. Like everyone is programmed to have it as the first appropriate step to induce eventual sex. For me, I’ve had my best sexual encounters with people who I refused to exchange spit with, and it’s been glorious! 10/10"

NarcissisticAbuse,fe624qi,t3_envi7b,1578880078.0,"Okay I wouldn’t feel right if I didn’t comment this: Sure he may not have any criminal history. Yet. That you know of. That he was caught for. Expect the worst.

In addition to this, be extra careful about this next phase and a PPO. He has a gun?! Yikes. Worry about this.

I had someone assault me and even with filing a police report, and recommendation to get a PPO, I was also told by several people that the most dangerous time in a woman’s life, statistically, is once she has alerted law enforcement of the abuse. That’s when the abusers typically do their worst. That’s when women get murdered, once the abuser feels angered that you have told on him to the grand authorities. I was advised to not even pursue the PPO on my assaulter because, they can’t jail him, they can only notify him of the order, so, he can basically become enraged and act out in retaliation against me, or, have third parties harm me so he doesn’t have to. And I don’t even know if he has a gun. But I know he is not trustworthy and that’s enough to know, I don’t want to be a statistic.

This is how you hear news about some dude walking into a restaurant and shooting his soon-to-be-ex-wife in the head because he just found out that some authority was finally in the mix. Could be a lawyer that sets them off, could be that the police show up to notify them of a PPO/restraining order. Whatever it is, consider this person mentally unstable and a potential murderer, until you are fully away from them. You just can’t predict. 


So. I encourage you to absolutely fear this person and get away and do anything you can to protect yourself, and with that, I also suggest you begin the process or notify the police but do NOT officiate the PPO order until you are safe in a location he does not know of. Ask for a female officer if you can. Tell them you are in the middle of leaving domestic abuse. Many have seen the patterns, and shortcomings of the law, and can help you time things properly. And never post your new location to social media, and keep very close tabs on which people you share your new address with, for a long long time after this move. He may stalk you. He may retaliate, seek vengeance, angered that you got away, angered that you told the police. 


Too many times you hear of women being murdered who had already reported to the police or had orders filed... but if that person still knows where to find you, none of those pieces of paper stop them from physically harming you. Scary. Best of luck and be paranoid-level safe!"
paris,fe5w2ro,t1_fe5ukw6,1578876239.0,I would be so sad
paris,fe5vhpm,t3_ensnc9,1578875865.0,"I’m sorry you’re dealing with this, it sucks! I can totally relate, and it’s not fair, and not your fault.

One thing that seems to work well for me in any country, anywhere, for any type of harasser, is to just surprise them back by immediately replying to anything they say with a loud “I said, leave me alone!!” It’s an escalated response that they aren’t expecting because they usually do sneaky small things, specifically so they can get away with it, or use your shyness/kindness/politeness against you.

Harassers usually seek you out because you seem like an easy target, like you seem nice/docile and won’t cause a problem for them. If you show them instantly that you’ll be a problem for them, a lot of times they are so startled that THEY will walk away alarmed. (Muttering “this crazy girl...” haha) It can even be funny too. You don’t have to scream or anything, but just make sure you don’t say “please” or “no thank you” — don’t be pleasant at all once anyone enters your bubble. Just instantly jump to a dramatic “leave me alone!!” Which also teaches them how extreme what they are doing even is (it is extreme, even though it’s normalized).

Another benefit of this reaction is that it alerts other nearby strangers that something is wrong, because it looks like this person has been bothering you for a while now and you finally had to react. Instead of even giving assholes the time of day by engaging or humoring them with fake convo (hello miss, how are you, etc), just immediately cause a scene, to embarrass them for even thinking they can approach you, and hopefully they’ll learn not to even bother women anymore because it (rightfully) draws bad attention to them.

Headphones in is a good idea but also can be a sign that you might not be paying attention to your surroundings, or, wouldn’t be able to hear a predator approaching, so headphones in can also be a sign that makes harassers target you as well. Just have to use your best judgement there.

Another thing that works well is practicing a fast and dominant walk with good shoes. If you appear strong, agile, and able to run away fast, or kick, etc, then jerks looking to bother you will not see you as easy prey. If you walk slow, hunched, in teetering shoes, and don’t look like you can comfortably move, you tend to look like easy prey for predators, like a sitting duck.

Hope this all makes sense. loudly saying “leave me alone!!” has worked for me in any place I’ve tried it! Best of luck! xo"

LifeAfterNarcissism,fe5tmie,t3_env97p,1578874668.0,"Just want to tag on and validate all of this!! I too recently passed my 2-years NC and it feels great. It does get better if you do the right stuff.


I didn’t personally journal but I was extreme about my NC. I didn’t just grey rock, I blocked this person on every digital platform possible and made sure that ANYONE who facilitated him hoovering me promptly cut off also. And the Hoovers absolutely still came, even with blocking and NC. If I hadn’t been educated about how hoovering by proxy even works, I wouldn’t have known how to steer clear. So grateful for all the help from others.


It works. It’s hard and painful but it does work. Some flying monkeys I had to snip off but some people respected when I asked them to never talk about him to me or share info etc and that showed me who was worth continuing a friendship with (or not). Can’t believe how many people I had to cut contact with over this whole time (seriously probably around 50 people if I really count) but it’s so so so worth it because they are only cluttering your social space anyway, making it harder to have space for the right people. It’s a huge lifestyle shift.

PointlessStories,fdojskq,t3_embnq9,1578606573.0,"Pro tip from a bee expert: The less tension they sense around you, the les they’ll ever attack you. It’s best to just let them freely roam and never harm them. Hives have collective memory that will know that you, the nearby threat, killed their friends, making them more aggressive to specifically just you and your scent. People who tend to not fear bees, and are able to just let them “bee” without swatting, killing, screaming, etc are less likely ever be stung. As soon as you start freaking out, the bees do too. With no freak out, bees actually want nothing to do with you and don’t want to even use their stingers, as it kills them. They are usually only around as scouts. Might want to hover around and scope you out, but that’s it... unless they sense that you are in fact a threat.


Sincerely, Someone who has held thousands of peaceful buzzing bees with stingers, had bees even nap with/on me (did you know bees nap!) and was only stung ONE time in my entire life due to landing accidentally on a bee where it didn’t even intentionally sting.

LifeAfterNarcissism,fdo958v,t3_emdg10,1578601035.0,"Tbh I have “studied” anger my whole life and it’s something you can never repress, you have to experience it to let it out truly. Even being physical (workout) to expel the tension of anger, doesn’t actually heal the anger root itself. I can’t give you perfect tips, you’d have to find for yourself what you feel is most realistic for you, but, for myself, something that has helped immensely to resolve anger from my life (Ns) is to go be by myself somewhere remote and scream all of the anger at the top of my lungs. Like screaming “fuck you so-and-so for doing xyz to me!!!” ...over and over, for any time, any person, until you can’t even think of any more times. Sounds basic and maybe lame or crazy, but for me it’s one of the only things that worked, because the anger is usually about repressed stories. If you let the story out, with your voice, your version, your words, you’re expelling that from inside your depths. Hope this makes sense! 

Besides something this carnal and “innate”, nothing else has really helped me, including meditation, yoga, therapy, journaling, running, dancing, music... none of it allowed the actual anger to be the focus, those were all pretty band-aids to cover a deeper wound. Like sure it sounds nice to journal and do yoga, but if you honestly think about it, why would those have any affect on something deeply-seeded into your psyche? 


When you have anger, it’s because of an injustice, something unbalanced, unfair, where you took on a burden, or were violated, etc. and to me it only makes sense that the rage built up from that, channels out properly as what it really is: rage. Let it be what it is. Let yourself BE angry. We have that experience for a reason, so let yourself exist as you need, which, is that you are still needing to experience the anger. It’s not a feeling to be ashamed of. It only turns dangerous if repressed and taken out the wrong way, so let it flow and come out the right way. The “right” way for me turned out to be screaming my truth at the top of my lungs, since my anger was largely around never being heard/understood/listened to. The “right” way for you might be something else based on whatever your anger stems from.

Hope this helps! Just remember, anger is a signal that something within you needs attention: give yourself that attention."

I see both sides, and understand even in myself, that it’s hard to tell someone what to do, when you’re telling them to NOT listen to someone else telling them what to do. Like the whole lesson we are all in here learning, is, how to learn for ourselves. So telling someone how to react isn’t necessarily on track with that intent... But, on the other hand, one thing that we all do need, IS the validation. To even know what to listen to. Having others say “no you’re not crazy, yes avoid that person if you have the gut feeling” is kind of the whole point of this sub.
