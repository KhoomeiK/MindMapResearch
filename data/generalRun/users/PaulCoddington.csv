audiophile,ffghnpo,t1_fffr4h7,1579906453.0,"I was born in the 60's, and in my part of the world (NZ) they were called ""record players""  and the discs were called ""records"", with subtypes ""singles"" (7"" 45rpm single track per side), ""EPs"" (7"" 45rpm, 2 tracks per side), ""LPs"" (12"" Long Playing 33 1/3 rpm albums).

Sometimes they were just called ""45s"", ""33s"" and ""78s"" (which were old tech at the time, but older people still had 78 rpm discs in 10"" and 12"" forms). Record players had a cartridge design where a double sided stylus could be rotated to play the odd 78 rpm which had a wider groove and needed a different stylus design.

I don't think anyone called them ""vinyl"" until CDs came out."

audiophile,fekx7zk,t3_epjwbx,1579209474.0,"I'm using ToneBoosters Morphit VST in JRiver.

Out of all the options I tried for my HD6XX (including published objective EQs by Oratory1990 and Rtings implemented for free in JRiver parametric EQ, and also a Sonarworks trial), it came closest to the memory of high end B&W speakers and/or electrostatic headphones I have heard in the past, improving things overall but not overdoing it to the point of causing new problems (good sub bass extension but not so much as to muddy everything else, etc).

But that is for my ears with those particular headphones, other people may find that other options work better for them.

The Oratory1990 and Rtings settings are free, good quality, a good place to start experimenting if you have parametric EQ available. Morphit and Sonarworks have free trials.

I was not too keen on peak limiting kicking in too often with Morphit (default setting), so I dialed back the gain a little to avoid it.

As for the rest of Windows, I don't bother. All serious music playback happens in JRiver. Streaming movies incidentally get some headphone specific EQ when using DTS:X add-on to convert surround to emulated binaural."
audiophile,fei5h4u,t3_ep4hu6,1579130712.0,"It seems questionable to me to claim that the brain can perceive something not passed on by the ear.

It also seems questionable to me to assume the ear is not capable of passing on the difference when the perceptual masking relied upon by lossy compression may be happening all or in part within the brain.

Possibly a misunderstanding due to ""human ear"" and ""the brain"" commonly being used as synonyms for ""perception"", but then taking the phrases literally to mean ""microphone-like stage"" and ""CPU-like stage"".

But, I was a vision guy, not a hearing guy, so not my field. There might be bunch of papers out there that show perceptual masking is 100% in the ear, for all I know. 

It seems plausible that low quality signals are more fatiguing because more work is done to reconstruct them.

We all experience that with trying to read text on a bad screen, etc. People may find it easier to hold a telephone conversation wearing their glasses (an old joke that may have a basis in reality).

But I think the opposite effect may also happen: subjectively I can find it less fatiguing to not wear my glasses in a visually complex environment, because it reduces the amount of visual information to process."

In the unlikely event it is discontinued, it will always be possible to code a converter (it is non proprietary).

It can be used as a reference Master copy to export to lossy format on the fly for loading portables, etc. If you store a lossy format to begin with, conversion doubles the losses.

The only music I have that is not FLAC is because it is not available in FLAC (something very rare that can only be found in a web archive), or SACD rips (DSD).

For photos and artwork, the recommended archival format is TIFF using non-proprietry lossless compression, but there are also other options to consider if the original is camera RAW. Same principle."
headphones,fec640u,t1_fe71897,1578967258.0,"Some early transistor gear did not sound that good. As for radios, they were less sensitive and shorter range than the big domestic valve sets. But things improved.

Recurring pattern: some early digital audio had audible problems that some found more objectionable than the faults of state of the art analog; early digital photography was much lower resolution than film; early consumer digital video was much worse than peak analog LD; early LCD/TFT monitors had horribly bad contrast, colour, gamma and viewing angle compared to a good CRT; early digital audio streaming and downloads used very lossy compression.

It's like new tech comes along, has some advantages (lighter, cheaper, more robust, convenient) but is not as good in other respects as the best of what it replaces, but it is often better overall than budget/typical gear, and eventually it catches up and moves ahead to be better than the best of what it replaced.

Unfortunately, things are less than ideal and a bit complicated during the transitions.

When I see some budget valve gear out there, I am amazed to hear people saying things like ""this amp is really good, makes the sound warm, it came with a hiss in one channel out of the box but I fixed that by changing the brand of valve used at extra expense"". To anyone who lived in the valve era, that is not ""valve sound"", that is ""broken"" and ""defective design/manufacture"".

With the better units, the fact that valves are no longer mainstream seems to make them expensive, but I can see the appeal for enthusiasts who love the tech. Like a turntable, you can see how it works, nothing about it is ""black box""."

There are plugins in Windows 10 that try to emulate binaural stereo from surround sources to give a simulated surround effect. Not miraculously effective, but they can be a pleasing effect. At least, everything stays balanced and nothing is missing.

There are also higher pitches that can be detected by bone conduction, but that's not really ""hearing"" and I suspect no audio system is going to ever produce sound levels in air that will result in bone conduction for ultrasonics under any realistic scenario (eg: playing music).

There are also some papers out there suggesting that mysteriously ""sick"" buildings have lots of ultrasonic noise, suggesting it may affect some people adversely. But again, I'm not in a position to comment on the quality of those studies.

Finally, there has been some discussion out there on whether higher sampling rates are better for stereo imaging as inter-aural timing detects very fine intervals. But if true, it may only be relevant for binaural recordings, I would guess.

So, I can see where these claims are coming from, I just don't know how to regard them. 

I don't think companies are being deceptive though, just practical. Cars are designed to hold most people, but the rare 7ft person, will have trouble fitting. It's not a dirty little secret or a trick.
