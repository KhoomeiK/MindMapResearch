There are things in your life that you enjoy and still find worthwhile. Even the most mundane things like cheap coffee can bring you warmth and comfort. 

Having a degree in the arts means that you have the discipline required to get a college degree, even if the title of your degree isnít ìapplicableî to many job postings. You have the skills to work hard at a job, whether if itís menial tasks or skilled labor. If McDonaldís didnít hire you, then itís their loss and the Burger King down the street will be happy to have you. 

The fact that your situation upsets you and makes you stressed out signifies that you do very much enjoy living, because you want a better life than what your life is right now. Furthermore, itís clear that you are capable of and willing to work for the life that you want.

Plan ahead for whatís to come - save what you can, apply for jobs, look ahead for temporary housing that can get you through this time until you can get settled. Keep in mind that thereís only so much planning one can do before it overtakes their every waking thought and becomes unproductive and unbearable. Take comfort in the small things that you can, and cherish them. Tough times will inevitably get better; spring will always follow winter, and we just have to keep chopping firewood in the meantime until it comes.

There are things in your life that you enjoy and still find worthwhile. Even the most mundane things like cheap coffee can bring you warmth and comfort. 

Having a degree in the arts means that you have the discipline required to get a college degree, even if the title of your degree isn‚Äôt ‚Äúapplicable‚Äù to many job postings. You have the skills to work hard at a job, whether if it‚Äôs menial tasks or skilled labor. If McDonald‚Äôs didn‚Äôt hire you, then it‚Äôs their loss and the Burger King down the street will be happy to have you. 

The fact that your situation upsets you and makes you stressed out signifies that you do very much enjoy living, because you want a better life than what your life is right now. Furthermore, it‚Äôs clear that you are capable of and willing to work for the life that you want.

Plan ahead for what‚Äôs to come - save what you can, apply for jobs, look ahead for temporary housing that can get you through this time until you can get settled. Keep in mind that there‚Äôs only so much planning one can do before it overtakes their every waking thought and becomes unproductive and unbearable. Take comfort in the small things that you can, and cherish them. Tough times will inevitably get better; spring will always follow winter, and we just have to keep chopping firewood in the meantime until it comes.
