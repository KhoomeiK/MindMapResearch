Most new diagnoses for diabetes are in the 45-64 age range. I’d say it screws higher in my area cause it seems like they all have Medicare."
UpliftingNews,ffisf8g,t1_ffhdhmy,1579981549.0,"I work in a pharmacy and probably 90% of new diabetics we get are 65+.

This is because as you age your pancreas naturally begins to not work as well. I’d say the present of obese diabetics we have is probably only 20%-30. 
Most of them are either type 1 or old people who’s pancreases are sputtering our."
UpliftingNews,ffis7wc,t1_ffhfbm0,1579981402.0,I mean I work in a pharmacy and I’d say probably 75% of type 2 diabetics don’t get insulin in my rural Midwest town.
UpliftingNews,ffis3ss,t1_ffh8ygc,1579981321.0,No they just need to test their blood sugar and that tells them if they should eat or not.
UpliftingNews,ffis15x,t1_ffgxias,1579981268.0,"Getting diabetes is just a part of getting old too you know.

Once you pass 60 your pancreas just becomes less effective. I work in a pharmacy and the majority of people who we sell insulin to are 60+ and of a relatively healthy weight and for sure we’re in their youth."
AmItheAsshole,ffi1yar,t1_ffhlc57,1579962677.0,"If you can’t take care of a mentally ill child don’t be a parent because it’s always a possibility. It seems to me like OP has been looking forward to that 18th birthday like it was their get out of jail free card where they could wash their hands of her son.

OP’s stepson is displaying very common behavior for both bi polar people and people with anxiety, and I’m sure he is depressed too. What he needs is an extended in patient stay, not his family abandoning him. Giving up on someone the moment they turn 18 shows that they were only caring for him out of strict legal obligation instead of love for the child. 

My little sister is severely autistic. She will never be able to take care of herself she can’t write her name or wipe herself after using the bathroom or hold a conversation. It’s why my mom dosnt date because while she has never been violent or mean a lot of the things she does can be pretty annoying to people like yelling and waking up at 4am every morning. She has had one boyfriend since getting divorced who after 3 dates mentioned once she turned 18 just putting her in a home. And she never spoke to him ever again. 

Abandoning your child as soon as they turn 18 because they arnt technically legally your absolute responsibility anymore is an asshole move. Especially if the mother wishes to continue to have a relationship with her child this will effectively ruin it for 5-10 years."
AmItheAsshole,ffgzm9i,t1_ffg8gnx,1579919167.0,They need to give him more support. And check him into a long term care facility.
AmItheAsshole,ffgz4ha,t3_etaue7,1579918797.0,"YTA.

If you were not prepared to take care of a mentally ill child you shouldn’t have married their mother.

Abandoning an 18 year old mentally ill person and washing of your hands of them will permanently affect his relationship with his mother. Does your wife not wish to continue a relationship with her son?

You really need to try more drastic measures before you give up on being a father figure. I would look into extended stays at a mental health center. Puberty and post puberty for mentally ill young men can be turbulent.

Serious discussions need to be had for the safety of your other children and he should for probably a couple months be in a live in facility for his own betterment.

The boy is only 18. A couple of months passing and him ticking over to 18 does not absolve you of responsibility for a mentally ill child. It sounds like you only care about how this is affecting you and that it dosnt matter to you how he ends up as long as you can be done dealing with him."
AmItheAsshole,ffgwu8j,t1_fffnh27,1579917091.0,"If you marry someone with a child who is special needs you need to be prepared to care for that child.
Or else don’t marry that person."
AmItheAsshole,fff6qks,t1_fff55iq,1579877123.0,"I would say this is more coming from a place of fear for men that has been engrained in their heads since birth.

Fear that men can’t control themselves and that your body is just a commodity for men to plunder as they want. My mom would tell me that I was looking to get raped if I wore anything shorter and capri jean shorts out and I wasn’t allowed to wear skirts or dresses. 

I’ve been hearing since birth from both women and men that if I dress a certain way men will find themselves entitled to my body."
AmItheAsshole,fff67ci,t1_ffefxzv,1579876736.0,"So when you have daughters they are never allowed to just be comfortable on the couch they always need to be wearing uncomfortable restrictive clothing?

I feel sorry for your household where no one is allowed to be comfortable and you do underwear checks."
nottheonion,ffcq69s,t1_ffcpnsz,1579804897.0,"Because it’s their job to verify checks.
They called the police before they even tried to call the bank that the check was issued from.

Do your job first. I work at a pharmacy we get fraudulent prescriptions all the time. We get suspicious prescriptions all the time.

But I would be fired if I called the police before I called the doctors office that wrote the prescription and verified the information. 

They wouldn’t even let him deposit the other two checks."
nottheonion,ffcdo5p,t1_ffc7v0j,1579797214.0,Calling the police is completely ridiculous though. Also the title is misleading he was looking to deposit the checks.
