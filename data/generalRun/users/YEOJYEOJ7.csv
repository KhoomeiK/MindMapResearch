BreakUps,ff27ibp,t1_ff27bqo,1579496037.0,"Trust me... the amount of pain that I have gone through these past couple weeks is unlike anything I have ever felt. I wish we could just talk, but she’s apparently wanting me to get over her. I asked if she was for sure done with me and she said “yes”. It’s the most painful thing I have ever experienced and not a problem, I hope you never have to go through that. Pride kills."
BreakUps,ff26wcu,t3_er6emx,1579495522.0,"My ex (female) broke up with me (male) and regretted it the second I started driving home after I dropped her stuff off at her house... she called and texted and begged, but she did so indirectly and so that’s why I didn’t answer. (Indirectly meaning she begged for my weed and said she would only need me for one day and that she promised to never bother me again because she has no one else... well yeah you broke up with me)... while I cried my way on the drive back to my house, I didn’t respond to any of her texts or calls of pleading because I did not understand what was happening, I was so confused... she wanted to break up with me and so I listened and respected her wish. I waited til the next day to sort out what in the fuck just happened, texted her back, we saw each-other that night... we had sex and we talked about why she wanted to be single... she still WANTED TO BE SINGLE even after everything because she said she didn’t see us lasting... didn’t see us being married... also she said her pride would’ve been hurt and she knew she couldn’t take back what she had already said. It’s honestly a really fucking sad story because if she wasn’t so prideful, we would still be together probably. We haven’t talked or seen each other since that night. It’s been 16 days now. I still would marry this girl, I think she’s being an idiot. Just my 2 cents."

Marriage,ff1vum0,t1_ff1vpug,1579487336.0,"This just makes me miss her even more since we broke up, she told me she fell out of love for me and when I asked her why she wasn’t fighting for our relationship anymore that she should be fighting for our relationships when she needs to be “finding herself”"
Marriage,ff1vc7q,t1_ff1v731,1579486999.0,"This! That’s what I have found out lately too! It’s about hard ass work, I feel the exact same way, it’s not a love story, it’s knowing that you want to spend the rest of your life with this person! Thank you for reinforcing my own thoughts... she is easily influenced and I’m afraid that her mother has a way of getting into her head"
FREE,ff1uwc8,t3_er31c0,1579486723.0,Thanks for being so thoughtful about giving away things for free at a time where we need this type of love and caring the most... in video game style ;).
ExNoContact,ff0ral0,t1_ff0qxtm,1579471565.0,"Thanks for taking your time out of your day to help me and to read up on what I have talked about, it really helps put things at ease even if it’s only for a little bit. I hope you have a great day! I will do my best to put false hope aside because I know that it can only hinder my healing process"
ExNoContact,ff0pqo7,t1_ff0pd78,1579471133.0,"Thank you! I agree, I will remain in no contact. It’s weird because I really do believe that she is gone and moved on, usually I would say things to myself “oh she will come back” but this time feels different with this girl. I think she is totally done and moved on and gone. So that hurts. I will commit to myself though and recognize that there is nothing I can do at this point and nothing I could’ve done if she felt that way. Thanks again"
ExNoContact,ff0od9p,t1_ff0lc38,1579470758.0,"It’s our “2nd time” breaking up though. We broke up a month before that because she seemed more interested in one of her guy friends that I didn’t feel comfortable with and she ended it. We got back together because I told her how much I loved her and she was all about it, but inevitably she couldn’t see it lasting"
ExNoContact,ff0nziu,t1_ff0lc38,1579470629.0,"My first breakup in general? No it’s not, why"
ExNoContact,ff01aeg,t1_fezm1fm,1579464062.0,I started no contact because I needed time to take a step back and re evaluate what the hell just happened as our break up was not mutual and she didn’t even think she was making the right decision by breaking up so it has definitely been a very confusing and frustrating time in my life right now. But you are right if she wants to go she will probably initiate contact. I’m just afraid that she won’t because maybe she’s thinking that I should since I mentioned it post breakup is all...
