OldSchoolCool,ffgkvnr,t3_etfnzc,1579908577.0,You look gorgeous! This is the year I was born.
transgenderUK,ff8ew3t,t3_es15e7,1579675522.0,"This looks amazing! I will say though, I think you pass 100% already."

offmychest,ff6ejeh,t1_ff4g1ld,1579625472.0,"I didn’t say you should act on it, I said that the feeling seemed normal, I.e. if we accepted that then people might cheat less."
offmychest,ff4ekr0,t1_ff3wfvx,1579561749.0,"""They wanted the comfort in you, the familiarity, what you had built together and have been through. And they wanted the new thrilling excitement of someone else.""

Yeah? This seems like a completely normal desire. If society could accept that this was completely normal human behaviour, we wouldn't be so fucked up."
sex,feayigg,t3_eo93yk,1578953554.0,"Personally I think orgasming is a skill for people with vaginas -- we have to learn it. The first time I managed it, it took me ages. It's really not obvious that you're heading in the right direction, and it takes a lot of work!"
ftm,feapuke,t3_eo8c0i,1578951178.0,"I'm so sorry. Always remember that you know you. Parents always think they know their kids and it's vanishingly rare that it's the case. Also remember that while this hurts, and it will always hurt when parents aren't accepting -- because they've failed in their number one duty as parents, to love unconditionally -- you'll still be happier being yourself without them than living a lie for them. Trust me."

ftm,fe5oro6,t3_enu35s,1578872352.0,"I have quite big hands, but fairly small feet. It really annoys me that my feet are a size smaller than the smallest size most men's ranges offer. Ugh."
FTMOver30,fe5of52,t1_fe5md8t,1578872143.0,Thank you!!
FTMOver30,fe5lbuj,t1_fe5kism,1578870931.0,"We don't have the concept of tenure, but I get what you're saying -- and that's actually a great idea! I know just the guy to ask. I haven't had top surgery, but do bind, and thank God it's January!"
FTMOver30,fe5kxof,t1_fe5jr99,1578870755.0,"Thank you! 

Yeah, I do think (because these dinners happen fairly regularly) that ""black tie"" in these situations is a bit less formal than black tie for a really fancy occasion."
FTMOver30,fe5ktbd,t1_fe5jhem,1578870711.0,"God, this is complex. Having slogged through loads of these dinners before, I wish I'd paid more attention to what everyone else was wearing, but I was mostly too uncomfortable about myself! Plus, everyone wears a gown over the suit so it's less clear. But I'm pretty sure it was more ""black suit and white dress shirt with bow tie"" than full tux. 

Thanks, I will try looking in the usual places for suits first."
FTMOver30,fe5jf0c,t1_fe5itl2,1578870165.0,"I'm in Oxford, and there is possible one tailor that I'm aware of, but as a junior academic on a fixed-term contract, I'm not exactly made of money!"
NonBinary,fe5e8jv,t3_entt0f,1578868276.0,"I think the history of the lesbian community feeds into this a lot, because traditionally there has always been a very strong equivalence drawn between being a lesbian and being gender nonconforming. This is to the point that there are, and have long been, ""he/him lesbians,"" which is to say, women who defined themselves with their gender being ""lesbian"" rather than being ""female"", who presented as butch and might be confused for men by others. It even used to be believed (even by lesbians) that butch lesbians were lesbians, but the femme women who slept with them were just ""women"". Today we know that gender and sexuality are not the same, but the lesbian community has been so defined by butchness and gender nonconformity that a lot of people who might previously have just identified as butch now identify as non-binary lesbians. This is particularly the case where the person is non-binary transmasc and has dysphoria about, for example, their breasts, but equally feels that their lesbian identity (or even ""gender"") is a key part of who they are.

So basically, most non-binary lesbian identified people I've ever met are butch lesbians who prefer they or he pronouns, are to a certain extent transmasc, and are attracted to women."
NonBinary,fe5dfb4,t1_fe5boja,1578868056.0,Trans-fem enbys are AMAB people who don't identify as binary women but present as feminine.
NonBinary,fe5cmqw,t1_fe5caz1,1578867730.0,"Also: Is it more common than I think it is to go by your not legal name?

It really, really is! We have a system at the place I work that has thousands and thousands of people in it, and on a very regular basis I'll open a record and it'll say ""First name: Mark; Preferred name: James"" or similar, where there's no clear explanation for it. It seems cis people do this all the time."
NonBinary,fe5caz1,t3_entmuj,1578867633.0,"I'm called Jay. It's not my legal name but I've used it for ten years. I changed my name to Jay long before I recognised that I had gender identity issues (although in retrospect, it should have been obvious): I just knew I hated my common, girly name and I wanted to redefine myself. Whenever I start a new job or similar, I just say ""I've been called Jay since I was 20, everyone calls me that."" Nobody has ever argued or asked. Partly, I think they may assume that it's a gender thing, given my very transmasc presentation, but on the other hand I really think people just give fewer craps than we think. If you say ""call me this,"" they will."

AskReddit,fc5af6e,t1_fc2rcz9,1577450987.0,"It’s obviously not a small minority given that by complete coincidence, my mother is like this, as is my wife’s mother, and my best friend’s mother, and her wife’s mother. When I found this out, we felt like former cult members realising actually everything was like the cult."
