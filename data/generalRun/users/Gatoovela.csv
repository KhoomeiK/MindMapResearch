It does sound like at the very least it'll add a little more thickness-wise under the dress, but the comfort and support might be well worth that. But I guess you might not be able to be sure, until you physically try one on underneath your dress."

Sometimes it would meowl a wild war-cry while charging at you. It was so bad, all the family members carried a rolled up magazine or other means of protection when walking about the house. 
It was pretty funny to watch though, as long as it wasn't you that was being attacked"
