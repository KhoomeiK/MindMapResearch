This is one way to do mental health checks. If someone says they're going to hurt themselves or others, they shouldn't be able to go and purchase a firearm the same day.

TwoXChromosomes,femyrn7,t1_femcn8y,1579273048.0,"she calls it sexual assault because that's what it clearly was. imagine if your doctor grabbed you, took your clothes off, and started touching your privates. the same doctor who has had many other woman say the same thing, and some even subjectively worse things. 

this is serious shit and I don't think theres room for trolling here

Added: from the article,

Initially, she says, she didn't see any red flags, but as the months progressed, Hadden started asking her inappropriate, unsolicited questions about sexual activity with her husband, which were unrelated to her health or the health of her unborn child. Looking back, she now believes he was prepping her for sexual abuse.

""There was absolutely no premise for that line of questioning, and it seemed like he just wanted to hear about me talking about sex. What I kept sticking to was this: 'OK, so my doctor is pervy. I have a pervy doctor, but I'm going to focus on having a healthy baby,' and the idea of changing doctors was overwhelming for me.""

Going to the gynecologist is an experience that makes many women feel vulnerable and uncomfortable. Going when pregnant adds an entirely different level of anxiety, especially during a first pregnancy, when a woman may not know what to expect. Yang says Hadden took advantage of that.

""The examinations became longer, more frequent, and I learned that they were unnecessary most of the time,"" she recalled, but she told herself, ""I suppose I just need to trust him.""

Yang says Hadden violated that trust in an unthinkable way when she was seven months pregnant.

""I was in the exam room, and I was dressed and ready to go. Then, at the last minute, he kind of made up an excuse. He said something about, 'I think you might need a C-section,' and he proceeded to grab me over to him and undress me and examine me internally, ungloved,"" she recalled."
