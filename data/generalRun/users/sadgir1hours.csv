introvert,fguiig2,t3_f0izor,1581121656.0,I don't know if this is a introvert/extrovert issue. I laugh at the dumbest things all the time.
Trufemcels,fgp0xew,t3_ezlio0,1580993752.0,"In a way I think they do, they think they want a naturally beautiful girl and not someone who is 'fake'. But they can't tell the difference between natural beauty and natural makeup lmao."
Trufemcels,fgndkeg,t3_ezgp0p,1580942600.0,Fuck romance I'm seeing the sonic the hedgehog movie with my friends
ForeverAlone,fgmqsjp,t3_ezdt39,1580930161.0,Does it really matter what she looks like if you love her?
depression,fgmqho3,t3_ezdz2s,1580929986.0,"Yeah, but I have maladaptive daydreaming. If you spend hours a day daydreaming you probably have it too."
Trufemcels,fgmpq67,t3_ez4lsj,1580929536.0,"Honestly I feel like looks are much more up to personal preference than people think. Which is one reasons why I hate r/truerateme (aside from that it's voting system is shit especially towards women). If someone is attractive, they're attractive. To certain people they may be a 10 and to others a 7, but still objectively attractive. Same with ugly people. I'm objectively ugly but to certain people I may gain or lose a few points."
infp,fgki979,t1_fgkhhqc,1580866182.0,Yeah just read the description on wikipedia and regret it haha. Human centipede is gross but obviously really a really stupid concept...Tusk is more horrifying. Definitely a movie I am never ever watching even if someone paid me to.
infp,fgkf4ah,t3_eyw9dz,1580864090.0,"Yes but only because I'm so awful at comforting people :( 

I'd say I'm more awkward than uncomfortable"
infp,fgke7s6,t3_ez0ab6,1580863495.0,"God this is so embarrassing but I was like 13 when I just read the concept of the human centipede and I had anxiety for the next 3 days just thinking about how awful and gross it was, I was like...why tf would anyone make this? I mean, I know it was probably supposed to be so horrifying and grotesque to get peoples attention and it worked. But I can't even imagine working on that movie...

I do really like true crime and horror though, there is a line where it becomes too much. I have had to turn things off or stop reading about them because it makes me feel too bad."
Trufemcels,fgk1b62,t3_eyv3tn,1580855452.0,"The treatment is really dangerous. You could go blind, please don't do it! I have to put in contacts everyday just to see and it's kind of annoying but not that hard tbh. I have blue eyes naturally and trust me it is not as important as just having nice eyes. Like nice lashes, no bags/dark circles, etc. People think it's attractive because it's not as common. There are so many pretty girls that have brown eyes, it's not the most important feature and doesn't take away from their attractiveness at all."
Trufemcels,fgir5ad,t3_eykqyi,1580829048.0,"Hey I'm a lesbian femcel too!! I haven't even been on this sub very long and I've had incels in my DMs be so rude to me, I'll say I'm a lesbian upfront then they get mad if I ignore them because girls just want a hot man...bitch im GAY what. Most incels are sexist."
Trufemcels,fghr2uu,t3_eyi75o,1580791492.0,"I've never though about how different beauty standards can be in other countries/cultures, I'm curious as to what's so different from western standards? Also where are your parents from?"
AskTruFemcels,fgg264t,t1_fgfcvsw,1580752624.0,"I was referring to just general misandry, hating all men just for being men. Definitely not everyone has this attitude though, I wouldn't even say most femcels tbh."
AskTruFemcels,fgfiihc,t1_fgfi1rd,1580739682.0,"I worded that badly, obviously sex comes w/ relationships and is natural but I meant wanting a relationship JUST for sex."
AskTruFemcels,fgenpzu,t1_fgeni3c,1580704220.0,"Hmm maybe. I actually was watching a video w/ an interview with an incel a while back. It was very clear he had some messed up views about women that were affecting his dating life, not his appearance. Someone asked about his mom and he said he loved her a lot and respected her, it was like he didn't see her as the same as potential dates."
AskTruFemcels,fgeng9h,t1_fgenc95,1580704007.0,"I wouldn't know about unheigenic or mommy issues, I've never met them of course. I meant mommy in the sense of being expected to be taken care of, ofc this doesn't apply to all of them. Just some I've seen."
AskTruFemcels,fgen95x,t3_ey0zde,1580703849.0,"I might get downvoted for this but I feel like even though I'm new to the femcel community I see a lot of 'sexism' (by your definition). Definitely nowhere near as bad as incels though. I regularly see incels striaght up admit they hate women or talk about how bad they just want to have sex. As well as pushing sexist standard about how a women is 'supposed' to be. I'm not into men anyways, but I wouldn't want to be with someone who sees me as a mommy they get to fuck. From the few incels I've had in my DMs they've been very rude when I don't want to get to know them better even though I'm upfront initially about the fact that I don't like men, I'm not sure if incels even have the problem of being harassed by femcels just for posting in their communities."

depression,fgem38v,t3_ey09uw,1580702938.0,"Go on r/skincareaddiction . I'll share what I do because I'm dealing with similar problem rn, I've mostly cleared up my acne and am working on getting rid of my dark spots. Always wash your face at least once a day, twice if your skin is oily (morning and night). It's really important the type of cleanser you use, you can't just use any soap on your face (because it may actually make your skin worse). I've used a few different ones but I always use a gentle non foaming cleanser because my skin is sensitive and acne prone. You may want to use a foaming one if you're skin is very oily (but still make sure it is gentle and unscented). Next exfoliate, use a chemical exfolient (some people use scrubs to exfoliate as well but that is really not good for your skin in the long run). I use lactic acid from the ordinary, I'd recommend starting off with that since it is the most gentle acid. It might make you break out at first but once your skin gets used to it it will be SO smooth. For dark spots you can use a vitamin c serum or niacinamide serum (I've tried both, I personally like vitamin c better but a lot of people love niacinamide, you just have to experiment with what works for you). Then moisturize and also make sure to put on a sunscreen every day (even if it is not sunny you are getting sun damage everytime you go outside). Aaa I feel like this is a lot but I hope this helps!!"
Trufemcels,fg20z2j,t1_fg1n1gj,1580436232.0,"Men are awful because they choose to be awful. Saying they just are that way, and nothing can change it makes it seem like it isn't their fault for their aggressions. There are studies that say T causes aggressive behavior and studies they say it doesn't matter, even assuming that it DOES cause aggression: humans are self aware. If someone is more prone to violent behavior it is their responsibility to deal with that shit, and if they act out on it it isn't because they're a man with high testosterone it's because they're a bad person. It gives men the idea that's just how men are supposed to be as well, and that's what masculinity is supposed to be (so why bother changing your behavior if it'll make you less of a man?). I've literally seen guys use that same mentality to justify their behavior, or the behavior of other men and it sucks."
Trufemcels,ffx48ay,t3_evldph,1580317404.0,"Lmao just stalked his account a bit, and he posted on some weight loss subreddits and is overweight himself..."
Trufemcels,ffwwh2r,t1_ffvb2xk,1580312588.0,"I hate the idea that men and women genetically act differently, like that women are naturally more calm, kindhearted, and 'pure' while men are more violent and angry. It makes it seem like it isn't the fault of men being awful because that's just how men are even though its learned behavior."
ForeverAlone,ffv1u0s,t3_ev5nnu,1580253740.0,"No, I'm ugly and I find I don't really noticed other people's looks. I think it depends though, some ugly people are so obsessed with their own ugliness they look for flaws in other people as well. Not even really ugly, like people that are obsessed with their appearance. I've known girls who are insecure or all they have is their looks so they tear other girls down for their appearance...I've also noticed attractive people who are unaware of how attractive they are don't seem to notice the appearance of others. Overall though I'd say ugly people are less likely to see others as ugly."
Trufemcels,ffrib6j,t3_euhbcb,1580158560.0,"The actual tweet aside, #hotgirlsforbernie??? Is that actually a thing? Why do looks matter at all in terms of who you are voting for?"
depression,ffpvkv4,t3_eujeh2,1580107383.0,"Thought the same thing when I turned 18 last year and had no idea what to do with my life because I didn't seriously plan for adulthood, hang in there! It's a slow process but it'll get better if you look for help, whether you need to talk to someone or find ways to help yourself. Anyways, happy birthday :)"
introvert,ffptokq,t3_eujnah,1580105312.0,"She sounds kind of like an asshole tbh, I mean ik ik kind of assuming a lot from one post but when you have a roommate you can't dictate when they can be in the house or not just because you want 'alone time'. She wants to feel like she has her own place when she has a roommate, you just can't have the luxary of truly being alone when you live with other people. That's just how it is?? Like I get a little annoyed that my family barely goes out so I never have the house to myself, but they live with me. It is there home just as much as mine and it would be very rude for me to suggest they get out more often. Just stay out of her way when she is home, that's really all you can do. It's your home too and you deserve to be comfortable as well."
ForeverAlone,ffn9m2c,t1_ffn52b6,1580063467.0,"I like the experience of sitting in a theater, it's much nicer than just watching it at home. Imo most theatres just overprice the food and the tickets are relatively reasonable. Sounds like you just don't like movies in general though."
Trufemcels,fflpxbv,t3_esj4cc,1580042665.0,"Okay I'm biased because I'm a lesbian and love girls with all of my heart, but yes. However, it doesn't mean relationships are going to be a lot easier? If that makes sense, like I have almost no dating experience but I know from friends that you will still be dealing with relationship drama that you would in a striaght relationship. I find most of us care less about looks than men overall, but it is definitely still a thing people care about. It's just we are more understanding because we deal with the same problems and insecurities."
Trufemcels,ffiw579,t3_etuyzo,1579984147.0,"I get this. I feel so out of place in nice clothing and makeup stores, like I don't belong there."
Trufemcels,ffgwbzs,t3_eti8dh,1579916719.0,"I think you should go for it. I've gone through similar situations and I always feel bad if I don't go after. Sometimes I'll force myself to go to social events and hate it but sometimes it's really fun, you gotta take that risk haha."

Trufemcels,ff311cz,t1_ff2rvc4,1579530817.0,"Yeah but even then you might end up getting scammed out of money, unless you're filthy rich I don't think it's worth it."
Trufemcels,ff209f8,t3_eqphtt,1579490370.0,"I feel like it's wrong to be with someone you know doesn't love you and is just using you for a better life, there's also a power imbalance there. Like their chance at having that better life is in your hands (the shit I hear some people say they went through in their home country on 90 day fiance is genuinely awful). Just seems like it would all around be shitty relationship to be in all around, and also very risky on your end."
Trufemcels,fev2ca2,t1_fev00yg,1579392299.0,Yeah I found it pointed out my flaws pretty accurately as well :(

Trufemcels,felefuu,t3_epfctx,1579220246.0,"When I was in middle school my friend, to make herself feel better about being short said 'being short is so much better than being tall, no guy wants to date a giant'...I was 5'8"" (in the 8th grade) and the 2nd tallest girl in my grade. I'm not even really insecure about my height anymore, I'm really just slightly above average. At the time I saw super insecure about it and my height was commented on all the time like...did you REALLY need to say that to me? I don't know why people are stuck in there own insecurities so much they don't even think of the things they are saying and how it might make others feel..."

I won't say kids shouldn't be allowed online, but there shouldn't be spaces that can be so easily accessed by creepy adults that are supposed to be for kids/teens."

Trufemcels,fdzs5c5,t3_en0v3x,1578794514.0,"Not all trans women have the money for that, most don't tbh. Not to say that means trans girls who don't have money for surgery automatically look masculine and don't pass well, it all just depends. There are features that look good on both sexes, so when someone transitions they still have those good features. I'm more jealous of people that just have the money for that at all honestly... On a side note, I know trans women go through a completely different struggle but I really relate when I see them talking about how they feel about their appearance."
socialanxiety,fdiitv9,t3_el8o5f,1578443882.0,I wish my parents pushed me to conquer my social anxiety/shyness as a child...they knew it was a problem but thought I would 'grow out of it'. I never did and know I have social anxiety and have no idea how to interact with other people normally.
