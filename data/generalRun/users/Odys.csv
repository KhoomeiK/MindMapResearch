rareinsults,ffpzuhj,t1_ffmtps0,1580112823.0,"Sexist guys date women just to have sex with them. A true racist really doesn't have black friends: no way. 

I guess I'm just tired of this time; I wished I could fast forward a few hundred years into a (hopefully) more sane time. All people seem to be pitted against each other: all races, male-female, straight-gay, left-right, all the different religious and non-believers, one nation against the other. I feel most suffer from this, but I also think a few can use all this to their own advantage and fuel it. And the rest let this happen as they are too busy fighting each other; and that's the whole point of it.

Race is just some stupid tiny difference (is it even ""race"" in the biological sense?) that is blown completely out of proportion by humans themselves: by whites *and* blacks. Just like a white guy can never really understand what it means to be black, so can't a black guy really understand what it is to be white. Blacks sometimes see racism where there is none. For example: a black friend complained that a neighbor was racist as he never greeted her. But that same neighbor never greets anyone. 

I'm not denying the existence of racism here; it's rampant at some places; I feel the in the US especially. But it isn't a strictly white property; it is a *human* property. 
There is talk about white privilege; sure there is truth in that. But how about the many whites that are from very poor families? 
Both my parents are white, both came from poor families. My dad even never had toys as a kid and had to work hard for very little money. I work in engineering, thanks to both my parents.
I feel proper education needs to be free, payed by society, so that children from *all* poor families can study.
At one time in history one race is at the short end of the stick, at other times another. And this think goes beyond race; take the untouchable class in India for example. 
It's a human weakness in all races, or variations, among us. 

But how does going on and on about racism help? I think whenever you meet prejudice people, you have to prove them wrong. That might not be fair, but there is no other way."
