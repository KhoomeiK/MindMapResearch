NASCAR,fft2w2j,t3_euv2en,1580204163.0,"5 > 25 at Hendrick any day. But seriously, I'd put money on Larson taking over for Jimmie. 

The one big reason I can't see Penske ditching Blaney is the fact that they went from 2 cars that they'd run for ages to 3 specifically to bring Blaney in from their farm team at Wood Brothers. Unless they're really disillusioned on him, I don't see him getting kicked out there any time soon.

So that puts Chastain in the 42 and the Penske roster stays pat."

As far as track goes, I've never understood people's love for Road America. I love road racing, but I really dislike that track for whatever reason. I would go with a revamped Pocono roval."

fantasywriters,ffcpwbj,t3_eswh3m,1579804717.0,"First of all: wow, that's a plot.

Second, I could see the confusion. On the one hand, there's only so many unique names that can exist, especially with a name that short. I personally don't find it confusing for pretty much that reason.

Third: Danaerys often went by Dany. Maybe Aris is an abbreviation of a longer name that doesn't sound like Danaerys at all? Racharis, Aristelle, Synaris...

My recommendation is to spend a little bit of time playing around with other names and asking yourself if you personally prefer them over Aris. If you've not found one after a bit of searching, I think it would be safe to say that your character's name is fine as is."
AskReddit,ffbjiu2,t3_esp094,1579768265.0,"Okay, so my crazy ex-girlfriend picked up on something several years ago. If it's someone I'm just having a simple conversation with, nobody particularly special, I stick with looking at one eye--usually their right.

If it's someone close to me, I'll alternate between both eyes. The more emotional attachment, the quicker the alternation.

She knew our relationship was over before I did because apparently at some point I didn't look at her left eye anymore. On the one hand, very astute. On the other hand, creepy as hell."

dataisbeautiful,ffaihqm,t3_esgqiz,1579736528.0,"This is a great map. I'd love to see it broken down into smaller chunks.

For example, NorCal hates SoCal. Most of Western Oregon hates SoCal, but the Portland area hates Seattle with greater passion. 

Portlanders in general don't like Washington, but they get along with Vancouver and the rest of Clark County decently well. 

Seattle hates Portland right back, partly because they can't handle the fact that we still have an NBA team and they don't, or that we're just a better city overall. :) Suck one Seattle.

I think Eastern Oregon hates Portland about as much, if not more, than SoCal. Politically speaking, once you get out of the Willamette River Valley, it's like Texas out there."
dataisbeautiful,ffaha3p,t1_ff9uasm,1579735713.0,"Oregon really hates California, but it's not really reciprocated as far as I know. Portland and Seattle absolutely despise each other specifically, but Oregon and Washington as a whole do get along decently well."
