TheCircleTV,fgo07yn,t3_eyv8t6,1580956801.0,I didn't like him at first because he definitely came off as a loser lol. Then he seemed really nice abcess he grew on me a bit. He quickly got my nerves with his weird push for everyone needing to be genuine. He was a broken record and he took things too seriously. It's a game.
TheCircleTV,fgnztpk,t3_ezj3cg,1580956547.0,Lol I definitely didnt believe his spiel about wanting to show men's emotions. No one really liked Rebecca besides Shebam and he was clearly feeling duped.

unpopularopinion,fgnazmt,t3_ez9yt7,1580941091.0,There's posts like this every week. This is a stupid over generalization that sums up many societal problems as men problems. Yes homelessness is an issue. Yes people do tend to have more sympathy for homeless women and children. Instead of talking about homelessness as an issue and working on solving homelessness let's focus on it being a man issue. There doesn't need to be some huge societal uprising to protect men. These are individual problems that need to be addressed.
TooAfraidToAsk,fgn3w56,t1_fgl8ce7,1580937214.0,That is crazy. I actually took percocet for a month and I had no issues. I was a kid though..
truelesbians,fgl8h4s,t1_fgl8215,1580885777.0,Lol this is hardly misogynistic. You can disagree or be annoyed with other women without having internalized misogyny. This is literally a random rant/vent post. Let her rant.
casualiama,fgl7xbv,t1_fgl7uit,1580885170.0,Lol you can probably make any excuse for his behavior
TooAfraidToAsk,fgl7upm,t1_fgl7pgy,1580885091.0,Allow it how? I guess. I took percocet for about a month and had no problem. I'm under the impression that most of the people who get to that point of addiction purposely abused the drugs.
TooAfraidToAsk,fgl7q28,t1_fgl78et,1580884952.0,Haha I mean you should probably take it after that. It is a bitch to ween off but it is necessary. Hopefully if you're being treated responsibly you shouldn't get to that point of withdrawal.
TooAfraidToAsk,fgl7koe,t1_fgl78kx,1580884791.0,That makes sense. So if most people who get addicted to opioids do so by illegal sought out drug use then why does it seem like the opioid crisis always refers to doctors prescribing pain pills? As someone who genuinely needed some sort of pain medication that I couldn't get prescribed it seems unfair to limit pain medication for everyone.
casualiama,fgl2mn0,t3_eyd7oa,1580880092.0,Do you worry about the increasing transgender rates? Some doctors hypothesize that transitioning is a growing trend and that a concerning amount of teens identify as transgender when they're really not.

BoJackHorseman,fgg5bk2,t1_fgf540i,1580754572.0,As have I. I'm glad that it helps you. I just dont like things like this because it tends to be used in a way that people who have no idea how being suicidal feels and barely repost and share as though they're fighting the good fight.

BoJackHorseman,fgg1vsr,t1_fgfj69p,1580752437.0,Yeah I mean there's nothing wrong with that person's thoughts and feelings about the situation but using this as proof that anyone else would/ should feel the same is annoying.
BoJackHorseman,fgf0016,t3_exvst5,1580717213.0,Ah idk I don't like this. This is one of those things people who've never have never been suicidal throws in people's faces on why suicide is bad.

SeriousConversation,fgdtj8d,t1_fgdsic4,1580686730.0,It's hard to be specific in advice if you're not specific with your goals. Go out. Meet people. Go to meet ups. Lose weight. Stop being so bitter. Hoy need to change your thoughts about other people. Whenever you have a negative thought about someone out of your own insecurity call yourself out. Treat everyone like they already like you. Treat yourself like you already like you. Stop making excuses. Listen to the very honest advice you get. Go out of your way to talk to someone new every day. Try to have a real conversation with someone new every day. Look up how to make friends and be social. Look up body language and how to be approachable.
SeriousConversation,fgds6hi,t1_fgdrsil,1580686240.0,You have all of these huge long term goals. What about now? I mean you can definitely do those things you mentioned but you mentioned being jealous of couples. Is there anything you actually want in dating besides a vague idea of a relationship? I'd say you need to get out and live. Make yourself uncomfortable. Do shit you don't want to do. Realize what you're doing now isnt working and you're the only person that can fix it.

bipolar2,fgabb9f,t3_exkqp9,1580649160.0,I do. Sometimes it feels like it's so loud. Adderall can seriously backfire on me when all I can concentrate on is my inner monologue. It's like it's on a loud speaker and everything else is background noise.

AmItheAsshole,fg8cdef,t3_exa2hq,1580615397.0,YTA for even posting this. You both need therapy.

facepalm,fg6a5c2,t1_fg5touf,1580561052.0,I mean non binary doesn't effect sexual attraction. Sexual attraction is based on sex. If you're attracted to female bodies and a woman you're attracted to comes out as nonbinary that doesn't automatically change your attraction to that person or your sexuality.
antidepressants,fg4wofn,t1_fg2oxfp,1580512772.0,Good luck! Also I obviously don't know your situation but I thought I was treatment resistant and getting treated for bipolar type 2 rather than MDD made a big difference.
explainlikeimfive,fg4ckh4,t1_fg3mz5a,1580500876.0,I mean targeted fat loss is definitely a myth but people lose fat in different places and have different figures from it. I wonder what exactly makes the body lose fat where it does. I think genetics would be the short answer.

antidepressants,fg2lp0w,t1_fg2j39d,1580447544.0,"No problem! When I first started taking it I would feel like really heavy and I couldn't think within 10 to 15 minutes. Then I'd fall asleep within another 15. Over time it'd take longer for that feeling to hit me and a few months later it went away completely. I actually still take it before going to bed because I don't want to risk it making me tired. 

That and nausea were my only side effects. I hardly had nausea issues, it was more of an upset stomach but I'm sure sleeping through it helped too. 

I'm still me. Trintellix has been a different experience from other meds I've tried. With other antidepressants I think they're suppose to work within 2-3 months. For those months it's like you're constantly wondering if it's working and trying to trick yourself into believing it is. My psychiatrist told me that with trintellix I should feel better within 2 weeks. I'm not sure how long it actually took but I think it actually made a difference within days of taking 20 mg. I knew I felt better rather than constantly questioning it."

antidepressants,fg2ghfl,t3_ewi27r,1580444543.0,I haven't heard of the other one but I live by trintellix. I did have some side effects at first but it went away with time. I started at the lowest disre of 5 mg but didn't see progress until taking 20 mg.

bipolar2,ffr4kxd,t1_ffqg43p,1580150323.0,It can be caused by both. Right now I'm just telling to relax a bit. Tomorrow I'm going to double my vyvanse and hopefully shake myself out of it.

truelesbians,ffagmwv,t3_erz57p,1579735292.0,Ehhhhhh. I mean you're definitely not asexual since you have a sex drive. I think you're not being honest with yourself. You say this is what you want and exactly how you want it because you prefer it that way as a way to feel in control. This sounds like anxiety and/or being uncomfortable with yourself. I think a lot of people are uncomfortable and scared to be touched/seen for the first time but it's typically something that's worked through. Labeling it as a fixed part of your personality or sexuality will only keep you like that.
