BipolarReddit,fflx1tq,t1_fflv08a,1580045204.0,"Thank you so much for the offer to message you! I’ll definitely take you up on that. I do have a question: should I be feeling the effects of the steroid this soon? Yesterday was my first day taking it and I felt EUPHORIC the whole day! My friends even noticed and kept mentioning it. I left a voicemail for my psychiatrist telling him that I started it but he won’t get it until Monday. So I’m concerned about whether or not I should keep taking it. I didn’t get much sleep last night either because of it. 

And that’s an interesting idea. I sometimes wonder if I’m in the same boat (but in regards to Zoloft). Like was the Bipolar there before I was put on Zoloft at 13? Or did it develop afterwards."
BipolarReddit,ffjw917,t1_ffjrh6n,1580008663.0,Did it happen to you?
BipolarReddit,ffjw4jx,t1_ffjk2iu,1580008566.0,"Thank you! My chest pain has been very concerning and I’m really not sure what all is going on. I’ve had an EKG, an X-ray, all of that but they still can’t figure out what’s wrong. And it’s not anxiety either so I’m just not sure."
BipolarReddit,ffjjdot,t1_ffjj4za,1579999552.0,Hopefully I only need it for about two weeks! It’s definitely not a long term thing unless the chest pain persists.
BipolarReddit,ffj2tpm,t1_ffiz4zh,1579988973.0,That’s my concern. I’m hoping it doesn’t trigger any symptoms whatsoever. Thankfully I’m on a low dose (and it’s not Prednisone) but I’m still concerned about drug-induced mania and psychosis.
BipolarReddit,ffj2q5u,t3_etrv7a,1579988904.0,I love Trileptal! I take 900 mg of it and it’s helped my mood significantly.
bipolar,ffj1rsp,t1_ffj1p0y,1579988223.0,"How long has this been going on? Normally they’re not THAT short but if you’ve been experiencing that for a few days, then that would be a cause for concern."
bipolar,ffj1mol,t1_ffj0ykj,1579988120.0,That sounds like a mixed episode to me?
bipolar,ffj0s8c,t1_ffh18nx,1579987504.0,"So I’m not the only one whose psychiatrist tells them to think positive thoughts! When I was depressed, that got on my NERVES. But now I see that he did kinda have a point."
BipolarReddit,ffh13of,t1_ffh0zjh,1579920292.0,How soon after starting the steroid did you notice manic symptoms? And were you on a high dose?
BipolarReddit,ffgwhh3,t1_ffgvh9v,1579916829.0,Thank you for sharing your brother’s experiences and I’m hoping that he’s doing well now! That is one of my concerns with taking a steroid. I’m hoping nothing like that happens!
