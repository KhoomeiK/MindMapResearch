For good stretches of that game we were the better side and on a different night (just like at anfield) we could have won it. Liverpool are going to win the league and no doubt going to break a load of records in the process, but I think we've proven that we can compete with the elite in this league. We may have lost but it's still an amazing time to be a Wolves fan."

For example, the other day we had parsnip and maple cake which was delicious. One time last year they had a bug stall. This included mealworm brownies and cricket chow mein. Turns out crickets taste very earthy and I'm not a fan, but the mealworm brownies were fantastic. Nice crispy topping to a good brownie.

NoStupidQuestions,fedl4tk,t1_fecpczb,1579014229.0,"I can agree with this 100%. My short term memory is bad to the point it effects most relationships in my life. Since I left school and started work I started note taking to try to help. Filled up endless notebooks, then got a smartphone and started using note taking apps. Currently use onenote as I also use that at work. It helps endlessly and most people are used to my whipping my phone or iPad out to make a quick note. 
 The best thing it's helped me with is I am terrible at buying presents but I have a note which I add to throughout the year any time my wife mentions something that she would like or enjoy. Without this, she would probably just end up with flowers and some generic perfume for presents."

When we got there we pulled into the drive and called my mum. My sister talked to her to make sure they were home and decent as we let ourselves in with our spare key and crept upstairs while still talking on the phone before sitting my kid on the floor behind her while she was still on the phone at the computer. My sister told her to turn around and she did and screamed (in a happy way). Was even better in that her and my dad had had a daft row about something so he was in the back garden mowing out his grump, so we managed to do the same with him and prop my lad up at the end of the garden. My dad got to the other end and turned back and almost cried when he saw him. Best cure for a grump ever apparently."
