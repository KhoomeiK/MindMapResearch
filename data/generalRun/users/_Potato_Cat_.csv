Has he ever been there for you? When was the last time he genuinely showed love for you? Show up to a school performance? Sports day? Anything like that?

He doesn't sound like a father, and ignoring his only child reinforces that.

She is miserable. She won't learn and she'll resent it eventually if she doesn't already.

She's old enough to make her own choices regarding this. 

I'll admit I've only ever taught one kid who was miserable in one of my classes and that's because she truly hated the subject (English.) Whilst it is obligatory in our curriculum where I was in France, it wasn't the be all and end all and I managed to convince her mother to let me teach her English using French rather than having to throw the poor girl in by her ankles. 
She eventually warmed up to learning in her own time.

As a teacher I can confirm the punishment for being found helping someone during a *test* far outweighs any supposed benefit of feeling good for helping someone.

She needs to learn to do it herself, as you won't be there for her when she gets out of school. You can't do her adult work for her. You can't raise kids for her if she has them. You can't tell her how life works unless she figures it out.


Stop helping her. Entirely at this point. It sounds more like she's using you then being your friend."

>So I work for a certain company that rhymes with Umberland Arms. I recently started working for them as my first ever real job. So last week I’m working register. When CB walks in and this is how the conversation goes

Me: Good Morning! How are you doing today?

CB: I’m doing okay. How about yourself?

Me: I can’t complain! What can I get for you today?

CB: Can I get $40 on pump 4?

Me: Of course sir your total will be 40 dollars.

CB: Hands me 30 dollars

Me: Excuse me sir? You only gave me 30 dollars?

CB: Yeah I know that’s all I have on me and need 40 dollars in gas for my truck, I figured you’d just pay for the rest of it?

Me:Excuse me sir but I’m not giving you 10 dollars in free gas and I’m not paying for it.

CB: Well the customer is always right and your going to pay 10 dollars so I can put gas in my truck!

Me: Sir I’m not paying 10 dollars for you to get 40 dollars worth of gas.

CB: I want to speak to your manager. Because this is horrible customer service!

So after this discussion CB tries to tell my manager that. I stole 10 dollars from him and pocketed it and that he gave me 40 dollars. She offers to pull up the overhead cameras to watch my register and what I do. He declines after realizing he got caught lying and walks out without his gas."
