He discusses eating from the philosophy of our nomadic ancestors.

not to mention many people will turn around and over eat in response to go in that time. Without eating.

What if we take blood sugar for an example even just a couple days of eating extremely cuts or no carbs at all can actually return your insulin resistance to 50% of what it was. 


Sadly for how long we've had human bodies we are pretty empty on the amount of nutritional information and studies we've had that give conclusive evidence.
constantly we come up with one getting information and talk about how great it is and then turn around and change to something else and then we turn around and come up with the third and say oh well it turns out this is okay in this circumstance when mixed with this but under this circumstance is poisonous....

I find many of them tend to be too strong in their flavors. They focus on being sour taste zingy to an extreme.
This means anything I want to use them on which I often would do for adding moisture to possibly a dry dish I have to use more than I would want to.

Beyond that actually understand some of it can be very beneficial to a meal they have appropriate fats if May properly and health conscientiously they can actually help with the absorption of certain nutrients and other foods and balance out the proper fat ratios."
