webdev,fegi9km,t3_ep01q2,1579093614.0,"I've build a custom CMS for the company I've worked for in 2006. It has been changed and redesigned a lot since then, but they are still using it. I left the company in 2015, and in 2017, I started my own company and build a new CMS from scratch.

I also made it open source recently: [https://github.com/krazzer/kikcms](https://github.com/krazzer/kikcms)

My main motivations are:

* Easy to use. I still haven't found any CMS that is as simple as I want it to be and my clients also love it. Obviously I'm biased here, but I haven't seen anything yet that would change my mind.
* Speed. Most CMS's are slow in my opinion. I also build mine on the Phalcon framework for extra performance.
* Every website I build is a custom build website. Owning the CMS means possibilities are limitless. Of course I still separate client code from CMS code.
* The CMS is not just a CMS but also a toolbox with commonly returning stuff like logins, file management and CRUD, so I can develop this stuff faster.

Is it cost effective? I don't really know but I really like working on it, so it doesn't really matter to me. On the other hand I get subsidy for it, and it saves me a lot of work on projects I do where I use the CMS."

NoFap,fed0gsl,t3_eo8007,1578992497.0,"Just sharing my thoughts here as an ex-addict:

* The chances that he really is clean for a month is slim. Accountability software is very easy to get around.
* The chance that he will quit are slim. Even if he's willing to, it might take decades of work. (I'm trying to quit for 10 years and still not completely recovered)
* As a porn addict, he will likely be not as good a dad as he can be. Most likely, you have to do most of the parenting work. Having 2 kids myself, I know this is not easy, even with 2 available parents.
* You should decide for yourself if you want to spend the rest of your life with him, or not.
* If you want to leave him, make sure you receive alimony to support yourself financially (I don't know how that works and when your eligible so you should look that up)
* If you want to leave him but don't want to raise a child by yourself, abortion is still an option.
* If you want to leave him, and look for another man, do so, but don't expect him to not watch porn. Most men do unfortunately, it's a sad fact of the society we life in now.
* Don't try to change him. It won't work. Focus on working on yourself.
* Don't count on him being attracted to you again unless he really quits for good. 1 women can't compete with a hundred novel ones per hour."

selfimprovement,fdn6cl9,t3_elzuo1,1578578508.0,">I just learned to code to build stuff I thought people would like, I don't think I could ever do it as a career.

You don't need to be a great programmer at 20. I sucked at programming at 20 but now I'm almost 35 and I'm great at it. That's 15 years of learning. And 35 is still young.

If you don't know what people will like (like me), just build stuff people ask for. Do it for a company or freelance.

Massive opportunity here."
