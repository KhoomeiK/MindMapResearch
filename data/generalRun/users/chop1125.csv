* don't have a reception, 
* do it your way anyway which sets ground rules for your relationship with your MIL, or 
* let her have it her way.

If you choose to do it your way, then you, personally, can tell your MIL that this is the way I am doing it, and she can get over it.  This sets up a bit of an adversarial relationship between you and your MIL.

If you choose not to do it at all, you can tell your MIL I am not doing this because of your demands, and she can get over it.  This sets you up as a person with less of a backbone because you are allowing her to force you to cancel your plans.  This shows her that she has power over you.

The third option is to tell do it her way, but only if she pays for it.  If you do this, you get to be as frugal as you want, but it also allows her to have a modicum of control over your lives.

politics,ff6k1u9,t1_ff689wo,1579628865.0,"This is entirely wrong.  As a lawyer you have 3 competing duties:

1.  Duty of Candor to the tribunal;
2.  Duty of zealous advocacy to the client; and
3.  Duty of fair dealing with the other side.

The duty of candor requires a lawyer to both be honest with the court, and to correct misrepresentations to the court.  The lawyer cannot advise the client to lie or assist in the lie.  If the lawyer knows something is a lie, the duty requires that the lawyer correct the lie on the record.

The duty of zealous advocacy does not include a duty to lie on behalf of the client.  This duty is one that requires the lawyer to talk to the witnesses, to examine the evidence that was found, to do adequate research into the law to ensure that the client's rights are protected, and to avoid revealing client communications.

The duty of fair dealing with the other side involves not lying to them, not concealing evidence from the other side, to only file motions which have a basis in fact and law (i.e. don't give busy work), and to actively work to resolve disputes wherever possible.

Lawyers who are caught lying can be subjected to very harsh sanctions.  There is a Federal Court Rule called Rule 11 that allows for severe sanctions for lawyers and law firms that sign pleadings which they know are false.

Then there is the sanction imposed by the state bar association if the lawyer is found to have violated the candor requirements.  The bar can block a person from practicing as a lawyer for making false or misleading statements to a tribunal."

Just so we are clear, the boiling point of a liquid is the point when a liquid can get no hotter in that state of matter and starts to become a gas as a result of heat and/or pressure.  

Basically, you can boil water without boiling it off, but the boiling water will remain at 212 Deg F.  If you continue to add heat, the water will eventually boil off.

So, yes the boiling point of water is higher than the boiling point of ethanol.

AmItheAsshole,fegxhxj,t1_fegtmbl,1579104728.0,This.  A big issue that a lot of homeless people face is that they are bored and get shunned from normal human contact.  When someone actually treats them like a human being it is a big deal.
AmItheAsshole,fegxdwy,t1_fegn44o,1579104658.0,"He probably did bring the homeless man joy because he was interacting with him.  He didn't act like the man was invisible, like many people do.  He actually treated him like a human being.

I have a friend who was homeless during part of high school.  He lived in his car, because his parents abandoned him to go do work in Alaska.  They didn't even offer to bring him along.  He told me one of the biggest issues with homelessness is the boredom.  You don't have a TV, you don't have a computer, you don't have a game console, so you spend a lot of time just being bored.  Having another human interact with you is a big deal in terms of easing boredom.

As to the save that money up for a skateboard, I am not really bothered by that because he was trying to say something nice, and not condescending while leaving.  He didn't tell the homeless man, ""now don't go spend that on drugs or alcohol"" or something to that effect.  He may have missed the mark, but I'm not sure what he could have said otherwise."

When my wife gave birth to our first child, she had some meconium in her airway.  The nurse had to take her to clean her up.  Once she had done so, she handed her to me to carry back to my wife.  On my way, my MIL took my daughter out of my arms, and held her before my wife got the chance to see her.  At that point, I decided never again.

When my son was born, he was an emergency c-section.  He went with me while my wife went into the recovery room.  I refused anyone holding him until my wife was allowed to see and hold him.  I caught a lot of flak for that, but my response was simple, the hospital room was mine until my wife got back, if they didn't like that, they were free to leave.

As the dad, your job sometimes is to catch flak from anyone who is trying to upset you, your wife, or your child during this process, and to bounce anyone who tries to give you shit for it."
