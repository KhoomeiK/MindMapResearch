AskWomen,ffmlev3,t3_eu63yk,1580056258.0,I had been working on this for awhile. I started investing more in hobbies and such. I solidified it by taking a trip alone.
AskReddit,ffjsupi,t1_ffjsea9,1580006018.0,Then why do they make it so easy to open from the other side?
AnorexiaNervosa,ffjn0su,t3_etyuw2,1580002020.0,"I think it’s still a good idea to take it, just remind yourself any side effects are temporary and necessary to ensure you don’t get pregnant. And remind yourself that we all make silly decisions like not using protection sometimes, it’s ok.  You’re taking actions to correct it. Try not to beat yourself up and commit to do better next time!"
exmormon,ffj1gt6,t3_etvspb,1579988001.0,"What an excellent topic! I struggled with wanting to maintain my relationship with friends and family, but being hurt and upset and not knowing another way to connect."
AskReddit,ffj1ctv,t1_ffivwt2,1579987923.0,I was around that age when I learned how to pick those lame bedroom locks. Perhaps she really did lock it.
AskWomen,ffitom7,t3_ettozy,1579982456.0,"Board games, dog parks, browsing around at the mall,batting cages, or watching sporting events."
AnorexiaNervosa,ffiovob,t3_etiz5l,1579979055.0,I relate to that feeling of being empty. Even when I’m restricting I can’t help but purge.
AnorexiaNervosa,ffii9zz,t3_etp1lh,1579974517.0,Same.
AnorexiaNervosa,ffi37zz,t3_etorfv,1579963775.0,"My understanding is most of the effects are from malnutrition, so the level of restricting/speed of weight loss will be the biggest factor."
fatlogic,ffgu1r8,t1_ffgtx0a,1579915057.0,"Even when I don’t talk about it, people find someway to sneak it in. “You’ve lost a lot of weight. Are you ok? You’re getting too thin, but not anorexic thin or anything.”"
fatlogic,ffgtmh1,t1_ffgs2qu,1579914747.0,"I’d probably have a million. Like underweight, no period, with osteoporosis and every other medical complication under the sun and when I ask for support I hear “you look fine.” It’s maddening."
funny,ffeb613,t3_et0f5e,1579841866.0,My friend has ALS and could actually use this! She can’t grip and has a hard time with balance. This would make her life so much easier!
quilting,ffdqyp3,t3_et0lj6,1579826798.0,Sorry for you loss. What a beautiful tribute to her life. Thank you for sharing this.
AskReddit,ffdf9tc,t3_esqst2,1579819652.0,"Just by making time for each other, touching each other, supporting each other."
AskReddit,ffdf6pf,t3_ess64d,1579819599.0,My favorite is just ignore them. Like walk away. Makes them feel awkward.
BusinessFashion,ffb8k4f,t3_enrxhc,1579755072.0,What a cool idea! Your survey was super cool!
AskWomen,ff94min,t3_es99h3,1579704726.0,"I think I felt this the strongest when my sister told me she was pregnant with her second baby a few weeks ago while I’m still unmarried and childless. I was never sure I wanted kids and I’m not sure current partner does either. When she was on #2 before I even had one I felt like she was passing me by in life. It was a weird feeling. I’m so excited to have another niece or nephew, but I feel so odd not having kids of my own and with no plans to."
AnorexiaNervosa,ff1qkgu,t1_ff1hjx8,1579483982.0,"It felt like she was forcing me into a higher level of care, which I understand where she’s coming from. But then there’s the ED that likes control and feels out of control in that decision and makes me want to do the opposite."
fatlogic,ff0uayb,t1_few4md8,1579472382.0,"I relate it what you said about mental illness turning weird shit into inspiration. I’ve struggled with anorexia on and off for a decade, and I knew when things got particularly bad when I would watch porn of fat people being force fed to get off because I was so far into a fast and food was all I could think about."
fatlogic,fems5j6,t3_epu9dz,1579268060.0,"You know what’s funny to me, in Linda Bacon’s Health at Every Size, she talks about how her “HAES” approach caused her to lose weight. Made me question her intentions from the start."
AnorexiaNervosa,femp4vy,t3_epu5y4,1579265369.0,"Ugh. I related to what you said about you can even pinpoint where it starts. For me it all started very innocently... “I’m going to quit drinking alcohol.” “I’m going to bring my lunch to work.” “I’m going to try that intermittent fasting.” Next thing I know, I’m sicker than ever before."
AnorexiaNervosa,femp082,t3_eps1fc,1579265245.0,I do relate. I was doing well in recovery and then PMS gave me massive bloat and cravings. I thought I had gained weight so I rebound restricted and purged until I was at an even lower weight and now my treatment team is very concerned. All because of dumb hormones.
AnorexiaNervosa,fekjfj4,t1_fekiw12,1579201303.0,Thank you for your supportive comment. Good luck with your PHP.
AnorexiaNervosa,fekgi7j,t1_fekg6xb,1579199559.0,Thank you for your supportive comment and different perspective to think about this from.
AnorexiaNervosa,fekcnkb,t1_fekaln2,1579197267.0,She thinks I haven’t made enough progress physically and need to be at a higher level of care.
AskReddit,fek5w67,t3_epfjje,1579193265.0,Gall stones were the worst pain I’ve ever experienced. I’m kinda stubborn and drove myself to urgent care and passed out the second I made it through the threshold of the door.
quilting,fejoztw,t3_epejf9,1579182075.0,Congrats! What a lovely quilt for a March baby!
AnorexiaNervosa,feir05z,t3_epbft2,1579145023.0,"I got so excited when the number dropped on the scale again, then saw all my ribs when I looked in the mirror and got sad. But when I could see my entire collar bone, a strange calm came over me. Anorexia is weird."
healthyeating,fehjqf6,t3_ep643n,1579117952.0,"GNC “Lean” shakes are ones that I’ve found that are tasty, fortified well, and with their frequent sales are generally low-cost per serving. I get the ready to drinks because cleaning a protein shaker after it’s been sitting all day is gross to me. I think they are only 170 calories, so if that isn’t enough for your morning, I like Ensure Plus for extra calories and carbs. They frequently give you coupons and stores/pharmacies regularly run sales."
Instagramreality,fehftxw,t3_eov9ue,1579115664.0,"That first picture she is using the little lighting ring. From personal experience I’ve learned good lighting basically erases lines, wrinkles, even cellulite. Coupled with some make-up, you get a near flawless picture!!"
AskWomen,feh01s9,t3_ep2ojr,1579106302.0,I try to match my breathing with his and then I usually calm down enough to fall asleep. As long as I’m asleep before he starts snoring it’s not usually a problem.
fatlogic,feeyjgy,t3_eomg76,1579044034.0,Got trapped in the break room with a pregnant woman who said if I lost any more weight I’d disappear and that all my weight “went to her belly.” Ugh. Couldn’t get out fast enough.
AskWomen,fecme92,t1_feck56r,1578977508.0,"I was so uncomfortable and ashamed of my naked body until I started spending time with my naked body. I started just by air drying after a bath, then went on from there. Maybe sit on the couch naked, eat dinner without clothes, do some chores, or hop in bed naked. Now I feel comfortable showing my naked body with the lights on to my partner."
AnorexiaNervosa,feadaff,t3_env5qd,1578947217.0,I have those thoughts when I go on business trips or my boyfriend is away. “No one here to make me eat.” It’s so hard to fight those thoughts.
AskReddit,fdz5y0w,t3_en7n9i,1578787053.0,Tom Cruise
AskReddit,fdobx0z,t3_em7trd,1578602388.0,Fml.com
AnorexiaNervosa,fdn38bt,t3_elt7b8,1578575969.0,"I’m the same way. I want him to see I’m working on recovery, but I do want validation for my struggle."
quilting,fdm2hg8,t3_elst2k,1578538236.0,All over meander with a light grey thread is probably what I would do! It’s adorable! Great work!
cookiedecorating,fdm2b52,t3_elxkqn,1578538121.0,Precious!
AnorexiaNervosa,fdkd88r,t1_fdk882h,1578501407.0,You’re right. I know he does. I think I’m mad at myself for engaging in ED behaviors that come between us.
AnorexiaNervosa,fdjzeq1,t3_elo6jo,1578492147.0,I was in a serious funk when my period returned. Ugh. The bloat just messed with my body image and the cravings. Ugh.
AnorexiaNervosa,fdcjd4h,t3_ejfs2j,1578276346.0,I’m underweight and restrictive type and some purging without binging.
AnorexiaNervosa,fdcj9xf,t3_ejevnd,1578276282.0,That’s how I feel. As I’ve worked on recovery I think my brain equates eating more with automatic weight gain and therefore I must be fat.
sewing,fdbapee,t3_ekd4z5,1578255576.0, Connecting threads has lovely and soft cottons for a great price! Very cute collections and fun pattern ideas!
Baking,fd7h9mo,t3_ek5yd0,1578204486.0,those look so yummy!
aww,fd355d6,t1_fd1lpe1,1578154800.0,My cat loves everything dairy. I can’t eat it in the house without her coming to take a taste.
AmItheAsshole,fd045ou,t3_ejkij2,1578113359.0,MYA- My mechanic won’t inflate a tire without calling me first.
stopdrinkingfitness,fcy1yxx,t3_ejf5k8,1578073663.0,"It’s weird at first as you form new habits, but my life lately looks the same just without booze, terrible hangovers, and bad memory. I still go to bars and parties, but drink a Diet Coke instead. My friends have largely quit drinking as well. My boyfriend doesn’t drink. We have clean and sober fun and remember it all the next day. You find there are so many people who don’t drink for whatever reason. After about six months I had no more cravings for alcohol and even get repulsed at the idea now. I feel better and look better without it so that’s what I’m going to keep doing!"
LifeProTips,fcx7dks,t3_ej8qdj,1578054223.0,Thanks! Had no idea what that setting meant even though it should be straightforward.
sewing,fcwfgb1,t3_ej9vbk,1578024258.0,"I started with the colored blocks of quilting cotton at 9.5”x9.5”. Next I added the sashing of white cotton at 1.5”. Then I sat with my scrap bin of cotton, felt, flannel, ribbons, and added fun shapes and textures. I sewed them on with the batting. Then used a striped canvas for the backing and rolled that to the front to bind.


Next up, an Ispy quilt to use up more scraps!"
AskReddit,fcuefzb,t3_eixc75,1577979008.0,Mostly trash men who want a fuck buddy on demand. Have some good friends I’ve stayed in touch with as we weren’t romantically compatible or neither was ready for commitment. My current boyfriend I met online and he’s a gem. I was seriously ready to give up until I met him.
AnorexiaNervosa,fcrpxwl,t3_eijf2w,1577905046.0,I’ve had some cardiac complications with my anorexia and the chest pains get so bad I restrict more sometimes hoping I’ll die.
Baking,fcp0krd,t3_ei8dzv,1577846805.0,They look so tasty and beautiful!
quilting,fcjdcqm,t3_ehfldg,1577683719.0,These are my favorite projects. So many memories wrapped up in one.
AskWomen,fchujn7,t3_eh8wy3,1577654303.0,"I started doing yoga, reading more, spending more time on my hobbies (mostly art and sewing), and being a better friend!"

Baking,fch4v74,t3_eh73or,1577647340.0,It’s a game changer. You deserve it! Enjoy!
