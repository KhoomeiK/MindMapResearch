Pathfinder_RPG,ff7f2fy,t1_ff72871,1579648067.0,"I actually have a similar document I keep maintained for my players to refer to. It changes a little campaign-by-campaign. For example, my last campaign was a wild west campaign set in the real world so I severely limited magical classes. My next campaign will be set also in the real world but thousands of years ago so magic is more flexible so I'll re-allow certain magical abilities (like the Druid's Wild Shape). Other rules range from meet tardiness and attendance rules to making the player reroll a dice if the dice falls off the table and isn't clearly visible to everyone.

Pathfinder_RPG,ff7e2h1,t3_es067e,1579647410.0,"One of my favorites is a homebrew feat I developed during my wild west campaign that I'm now using again in a fantasy campaign as a picaroon. The feat is specific to people who use firearms, and is called ""Save Ammo"". In effect, it's Cleave but for guns. It requires Precise Shot as a prerequisite, and once you unlock it if you confirm an attack on an opponent with a firearm, you may then as a free action make an attack on anyone standing in a direct line behind them with no range restrictions (though range penalties still apply). In essence, your bullet travels through your target (killing them in the process) and hits someone else to deal extra damage. 

A ""Greater"" variant even exists. Greater Save Ammo allows you to make attacks against every enemy standing in a straight line as long as you confirm hits. Pair that with a rifle (which has a range of 80') and you can get some mean combos going during large sieges, or it's handy during dense close quarters combat. Our current campaign is a pirate campaign so it's commonly a lot of people fighting in close quarters on a ship so it comes in handy for that.

Ninja edit: I forgot to mention that, since it's the same bullet traveling to multiple targets, additional attacks made with the ""Save Ammo"" feat do not consume additional ammunition."

Stone tools first appeared around 3,000,000 years ago (3mya, but to demonstrate it's helpful to have the zeroes). The first evidence of stone tipped spears comes simultaneously from *H. heidelbergensis* and *H. sapiens neanderthalensis* sometime around 500,000 years ago. Seeing as the arrow is just a tiny spear, it makes sense that it didn't come about until after. The first evidence of arrows that we have comes from *H. sapiens* in Africa about 70,000 years ago.

Futurology,fdr3ppl,t1_fdqp9az,1578679098.0,"> From what I’ve seen its the affluent urban areas that have substantial electric vehicles. The rest have very few. 

A huge part of the issue is battery life. In the 2000s, most electric cars had less than a hundred miles per charge. Not a big issue if your daily commute is measured in blocks or even from the suburbs to the city, but a problem if you have to drive two towns over to get groceries in a rural area. Another problem is electric cars tend to be small economy cars, while people in the country tend to prefer trucks and SUVs since trips into town are rare so you wanna have more space to bring stuff back, not to mention 4WD helping navigate muddy roads, high ride height negating flooding, and bigger vehicles being damaged less in deer strikes. In the '10s, we saw battery life extended to where most electrics have a 200+ mile range, and in the '20s we're already seeing many companies (Tesla, Ford, Rivian, Chevrolet, Toyota) explore or announce electric trucks and SUVs. Historically, the Ford F Series has been the best selling car in America for like 25 years. An electric F150 and affordable electric F150 competitors will be huge for the electrification of American cars."

ancestors,fca7ulh,t1_fca6w1m,1577564374.0,"I have to pay an effective 40% tax between sales and property tax, titling fees, registration, e.t.c on my new truck. It adds up to paying about $300 in fees for a craigslist truck I bought for $700. It's less ridiculous when buying cars worth several grand, but applied to a cheap Craigslist car it gets silly fast."

If not, you need to do more stuff while carrying a baby or two to build more energy. I find that just walking through water and smelling and listening to everything for a few minutes is enough to fill it. It feels a little grindy, but it's an optional grind."

asktransgender,fc9je86,t1_fc9ipdk,1577553538.0,I might also mention the reason I'm changing my name is because I got married and my spouse and I are choosing to start a new last name instead of going with either of our family's names (though the surname did belong to my recently deceased uncle).
ancestors,fc9ibih,t1_fc7rn8g,1577553095.0,You think that's bad? I'm about to buy a house in Jackson County. I'm really hoping this 15% law goes into effect.
asktransgender,fc9i4fw,t1_fc7z97f,1577553011.0,"It's Germany. The German name I'm changing my name to here in the States is a fairly common one but it's got 11 letters, 7 of those consonants, and three syllables which is a lot for American. I'm worried what a complex German name is, [Rhabarberbarbera?](https://youtu.be/gG62zay3kck)"
ancestors,fc9gtiz,t3_egrm0s,1577552467.0,I hope my post helped inspire this. There's a joke to be made here about libertarians playing a game as prehistoric troglodytes but I can't quite put my finger on it.

ancestors,fc7d4am,t1_fc7bms9,1577503917.0,My first truck was in my uncle's name with Oklahoma plates on it. Now I've got a '94 Dodge worth $700 that I'm supposed to effectively pay 15% tax on this year.
