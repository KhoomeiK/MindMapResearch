news,ffbxd3v,t1_ffbok56,1579785830.0,"> But a 5 year old doesn’t become obese without their parents feeding them too much. [...]  Kids who are overweight before they’re in high school are that way because parents and guardians have allowed them to eat too much for their age/activity level. 

I'm not sure we're still on point because that really isn't what I'm contesting here. Of course parents are at fault when their kid gets obese. In an abstract sense and to various degree based on age/maturity a parent is always responsible for their underage childs access to things that are bad for them. 

Raising genetics among many other factors that contribute to obesity is not an attempt to excuse responsibility on the parents side but to point out these factors make it hard to proof the parents acted knowingly and with foresight to the harm of their child. At least in comparison to kids that are starved.

It's a lot harder to convincingly put a parent on the stand because they weren't able to get their obese kid to exercise and eat right when they are already a bloated mess of all sorts of contributing issues, as opposed to a parent that literally didn't feed their child.

Starving a kid is a simple kind of abuse - primarily because people who starve their kids don't mean well (without being severely mentally disturbed) and it's not intuitive. Overfeeding is complex because the parents are ignoring good advice, aren't educating themselves and are enabling the kids ""free"" behaviour. That's why I said its easier to hold people accountable for abuse when they are starving a child as opposed to overfeeding it. Because they aren't neglecting the child, they are neglecting to consider and act upon facts."
AskMen,ffbvdex,t1_ffbrn21,1579784032.0,"Well, yes hormones can be bad, and I know I'm in the lucky third just based alone on comparatively mild periods, but the idea of multiple generations of women telling each other it's just how it is instead of actively working on being reasonable in that phase doesn't sit well with me.

In my very personal opinion, women should not need, ask or expect special treatment beyond accommodation of the pain, because how you deal with irrational feelings, hormonal or otherwise, is a basic skill we should always seek to improve on. Being sensitive to emotional triggers during certain phases is not other peoples job to work with but yours to make yourself workable with regardless. 

Hormones are a great explanation for having irrational feelings. They are a bad excuse for acting out over it. And they are a worse excuse for wanting them treated as legitimate. If hormones make one pissy people aren't *actually* pissing you off and need to change their behaviour. If you treat people badly or unfairly because you're having a bad day, you're at fault. Hormones don't change that. 

Unrelated, not so much a personal opinion: Your gf should track her own periods. It's an important medical detail gynaecologists use to access and evaluate a variety of trivial to important womens health issues. It's nice you track it for her but outside the relationship frame she should really be motivated to take care of this by herself.  The classic primary factors to log are date, flow, pain level."

news,ffbo1g0,t1_ffb6uwq,1579775065.0,"Is that copy pasta for whenever someone says genetics and obesity play into each other? 

Because how calorie differences work is not the only factor in obesity. Especially not childhood obesity.

Things that genetics affect are how you carry your weight, how severely it cripples your organs and which, and how quickly you become uncoordinated or in pain when doing basic activity. It affects how slippery the slope is when you're already gaining weight, how effectively you will seek out sugar as a gratification tool.

Kids who experience the side effects like joint pain or immobility early are much more likely to isolate themselves and withdraw from an active life- and playstyle. Easy to become obese in that situation or use food as comfort. Kids that get chubby but dont have those problems can plateau as simply notable overweight.

It's not all about calorie difference. When talking about obesity.

Getting bullied is pretty calorie neutral yet we've established pretty well that bullying fat people will worsen their self-destructive eating behaviour."

Kids dont ask to be starved. They do ask to get a candy bar after another. You cant starve your child to the bones by being naive about nutrition

So even if that is a true word-by-word account of what was said (and memory gets selective after a conflict), sentences like this can have been said in all sorts of rethorics and OP is not an objective judge because his feelings were hurt based on his *interpretation*.

I don't think this is something this sub can really chip in on because you'd need to be in the room or at least have both sides tell their perspective. 

It's also one of those common conflicts that a healthy couple should be able to navigate through on their own strength and empathy.

If the question is when to quit GoT not all season ends are equally as suitable imo.

> As for dna, you should just have hospital records with any testing for diseases

There is more to a family history than just genetic diseases you can test for at birth. Conditions that develop after puberty or in early adult hood, tendencies towards certain mental illnesses or cancers (and here again when donors are needed it's of interest to have document genetic relatives) and much more. We're not yet scientifically advanced enough that with dna alone you do not need family history for diagnosis or treatment. 

> Religious people will oppose it, because cheating spouses would be outed.

I don't see why we have to blame religion here. There are lots of reasons beyond that make it unappealing to give genetic testing at every birth. And by no means is it explicitly a religious thing to have an issue with cheating spouses. 

It's expensive, consumes resources and if it's mandatory the government has to pay for it, when all it has to gain is someone dropping out of parental obligations putting more financial pressure on society.

That statement is true until it becomes relevant for health reasons to have the family history from a genetic point of view to take care of the child until it's of age. 

As far as I'm concerned a birth certificate should contain both. The people legally assuming responsibility for the child at time of birth and the people that contributed genetically and or carried the child to term because both seem relevant information regarding a childs birth.
