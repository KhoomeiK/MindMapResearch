roadtrip,fffuuzi,t1_fffrh0l,1579892297.0,"Born in Bradenton, live in ATX now!  I vehemently third the Hill Country suggestion : ).  From NOLA -> Austin it's 8-9 hours, via Houston, fairly straight.

If you still want to hit Santa Fe, there are routes you can take from Austin up through Llano, TX and most of New Mexico's Eastern corridor, but that can be a rural route through a lot of snow and ice this time of year.  You can also hit I-35 North from Austin, hit Dallas in 4 hours, and then take a route up through Wichita Falls, TX -> Amarillo, TX -> Sante Fe, NM.  Honestly most routes get pretty rural when you get into NM.

I have family in the DFW Metroplex - It's not a terrible place, but basically mostly urban sprawl.  The Plano/Frisco Northern side always struck me like a more expensive, more expansive Lakewood Ranch lol.

AskExCoC,ffbzol7,t1_ffbfl6j,1579787747.0,"I had a similar experience.  I'll never forget how often denominational churches and their members were brought up as examples of 'soft' and 'selfish' people, who just wanted to use their religion as a good time.

I had a few best friends whose fathers were pastors at Baptist churches - It always seemed like Baptists were considered the absolute worst heretics.  I could never go to their churches though I'd been invited in a friendly manner.  The few times a friend came with our family, they were immediately pressured by total stranger adults to get baptised and/or keep coming.

There were some truly friendly and warm, understanding normal humans whom I adored, who I never saw partake in that type of behavior too, it's important I note that.  But they were few in number.

I remember being on a family trip in Alabama, and my Dad found a CoC (we always had to find one if we were away, sometimes with interesting results haha).  We ended up at a CoC whose membership was nearly entirely minority, and the dynamic was totally different from our home CoC.  They were so friendly, non-judgemental of others outside the church.  They were an example in my mind of the good that could be done."

datingoverthirty,ff864oo,t1_ff846q3,1579667056.0,"You hit the nail I've been hammer-dancing around on the head!  In my limited empirical view, ""Transactional"" now describes the spirit or essence of dating behavior, or mating in Western modernity writ-large.  I think everyone now recognizes that we've moved inward in our definition of health and dependency:

- From: What is good for the community, the tribe?
- To: What is good for our nuclear family?
- And Now: What is good for me personally?

I think ""Transactional"" was such an apt descriptor, as I'd posit humans used to get less reward personally, but more benefit for their loves ones/community (altruism of a sort).  This seems to have distilled into an expectation that most of the benefit in a relationship is not in the mutual bond, but rather what [I] receive from that bond.  Another user here noted something similar in describing it as ""Projection"" - I'd argue that's also an apt descriptor.  So it makes sense in that narrowed scope that, if a relationship is about [me] at it's core now, I want someone who fits a higher social caste, as I want to see myself as a member of that caste as well.

Again, I wouldn't ever generalize that as everyone, everywhere, or even as good or bad, but it's accurate to my experience."

I respect your decision to bow out until you feel up to it, having made the same decision.  It's a super tough place to be in, but I 100% believe in your ability to do whatever it takes, and take as much time as you need to get to a good place.

I just deeply hope you know that while right now might not be conducive, you're a lovely person, are at your core a terrific partner and worthy of whatever relationship you want to have as soon as you're ready."

datingoverthirty,ff7q11h,t1_ff7mjgj,1579655564.0,"This.  It definitely goes both ways of course; I find male acquaintances my age (mid 30's) do the very same thing, though it seems more oriented towards physical characteristics.

I completely get the following givens about human nature:
- As someone else in this thread noted, career/income/vehicle/etc. are quantifiable attributes
- Human deduction and decision is fuelled largely through comparison
- We also rely heavily on pattern recognition for survival

All of these combine to make a seemingly unsympathetic rubric a distinctly human one.  To all of our chagrin, we could probably agree that the archetypal 'gold digging' woman, while certainly not universally true, is not a preternatural phenomenon - Money is a totem for resource, and in our primate-roots females selected mates with the most resources/means to gather resources to ensure their offspring were more likely to survive.  An equal number of our ideals about male behavior are of course similarly derived - Hopefully modernity continues to dispel these notions as culturally necessary in lieu of better qualities.  Apologies if that came across as some kind of redundant or ill-conceived digression!  I recognize it's common knowledge.

I guess what I hope to see develop between all genders is a little more realism, and the desire to understand all of the qualities a potential partner may have to offer.  I get that people don't want to take on the role of a parent, but maybe getting to know someone past that $20k annual salary difference, that dream of going back to school towards a CPA, or that roommate they took on to decrease their school loan burden ISN'T being their parent."
datingoverthirty,ff7l9xk,t3_es01yu,1579652242.0,"Honestly, this is completely understandable as an adult in general, I get not wanting to repeat bad and unfair relationship dynamics.  However, some of this is totally demoralizing as a 33 year old widower.

Some people couldn't build a stellar career or academic success between 18-35.  I worked really hard to get where I am as a software engineer, never having finished my BS - But I had little opportunity to live a normal life between 18-30, and honestly little choice in choosing a career I have passion for.  And I've been a terrible mess since she passed coming up on four years.

I get this is maybe not the standard situation, but so much can happen in someone's life.  So much can shake someone to their foundations that it takes years just to get themselves back to 'alright.'  In my case, I'm well aware that I shouldn't date anyone anytime soon, even though loneliness kills me.  I would hope others in my situation who aren't ready would recuse themselves as well for the mutual benefit of all involved.

But this generic expectation that everyone should only have 'minimal baggage', should work where their passion lies - This world doesn't exist in a way where we can all just follow our passion.  I'm not trying to dog anyone's reasonable expectations, it just seems everyone, irrespective of gender/orientation, seems to desire this Instagram filter-notion of what a partner is.  It fits hand-in-glove with the, 'You want to sail to Portugal?  Just quit your job and yolo' temperament, just possibly a later graduation of that arc.

If they find someone who checks 3/5's of the boxes at that current time, they might hold onto them just long enough to find a possible candidate that checks 4/5's, ad infinitum.  At this rate, in this society, I feel those who didn't have the same opportunities earlier will be left behind."

SuicideWatch,ff2mjq9,t3_er1x8y,1579513386.0,"OP, as a man nearing 34 myself, I also want you to know that I identify closely with the sentiments you've shared about yourself and your experience.

I've tried multiple forms of therapy and counseling, medications, and various forms of escapism to no avail.  I have a handful of immediate family, but nearly no friends who I'm in regular contact with, and like so many, work in a field I have no passion for doing something I barely feel adequate enough at to pull off.

I often grasp at reasons to stay.  I'll share one thing I've noticed I gravitate towards - I hope it helps, or provides some helpful thought technologies that can actually be deployed.

I think about what it would take to become a completely different person.  To wholly abandon everyone and everything I've ever known, leave (not sell, just leave) every literal thing behind me and go somewhere there is almost no possibility of encountering my past self, in any way.

A huge part of what keeps me in this depression, and has done so since I was a teenager is that most sweeping changes I could make, like moving to a new city, are still tied to much smaller constituent changes, which require me to replay my depression and past failures, etc. ...  To hold ties to this experience of my existence.  And that has always made me ultimately feel powerless to experience my life any other way.

I'm often only struck by stories where someone throws everything they are at risk, or just releases it in devotion towards some cause or goal.  There was a podcast episode I'd heard years ago about a man who left everything behind to help a total stranger rescue her child from an ex involved in the drug trade in Mexico.  I envied his ability to find a truly altruistic, albeit likely misguided goal and devote himself to it entirely, to the point where his own experience didn't really matter, nor his life.

I hope this helps OP, and I deeply hope we both can find something to help us through.  Even though your friends are busy with their lives as are mine, you can bet I'll think back on you here in the coming days."

excoc,feyrzo0,t3_dt2cs3,1579449854.0,"Unfortunately, that's SOP.  I wish I could go back to my youth and tell them all to sthu.  My Fiancee passed from ovarian cancer - Many of her best friends were the most beautiful, kind and generous people I've ever had the honor of knowing.  And they just happened to also be LGBTQ.  It makes me so angry to this day.  To say that a god would hate them for something they cannot control, and wouldn't bother to look upon all of the kindness they've done for others completely selflessly.

As someone else here noted, at CoC the maneuver commonly pulled when someone was in a personal crisis or had a personal revelation was  excommunication (unless you played entirely by their rules of course).  None of these friends had ever/would ever excommunicate anyone from their lives in this manner."
excoc,feyqsuj,t3_du1cdb,1579449373.0,"Former one time-FC camper here.  I went as my girlfriend at the time attended each year - Her father was a Professor at FC, and her brother a student at the time.  While it mostly seemed a 'family friendly' summer camp, there were definitely strange elements.

As an adult, I look back on the weird separation of sexes in certain activities with a suspect eye.  Additionally, I remember there being 'war games,' which were fun as a kid - But, what kind of lesson does that teach?  It glorified all of this weird stuff about the military, which was something I was obsessed with to an unhealthy end as a kid.  Also, like any summer camp, there were the 'have' and 'have not' cliques.  Certain cabins were bullied by other cabins.  The relentless jock archetype was strong, and seemingly encouraged by many adults.

I was born into the church, and remained very involved in the church in my teens - I think my peers there could've cared less to be honest, and I don't blame them.  I think I was very naive.

At the same time I was in the church, the only friends who accepted socially awkward me in the larger world were a bunch of punks and hardcore kids  (thank god).  So I ended up spending time (where I could steal it) with them.  Many in the congregation wanted me to attend FC, and become a preacher.  I ended up going to USF instead, and ultimately leaving the church.

Our congregation had split - Several fights had developed between the elders and our preacher, who was a good man.  He preached love and advocated the we all attempt to understand and have compassion for those different from us, including LGBTQ persons.  As you can imagine, this didn't go over well with the blue haired-hardliners, and they quickly replaced him with a friend of theirs over some technicality.

The dishonesty and lack of empathy by nearly all involved sickens me to this day, and really revealed that CoC, like any other hierarchical and patriarchical society, is bound to being disingenuous and ultimately breeds corruption."

widowers,fev6p7h,t3_eqeyqj,1579393742.0,"I have a few pieces to commemorate her.  The first was an illustration of 'The Tower', derived from the last tarot card she ever pulled.  I know the symbology is often troublesome for many, but I think she truly saw it as a sign of major transformation.  

I also have a skeleton key, which is a direct illustration of the key I wear along with her ring around my neck.   The key went to an old heirloom glass case her Grandfather fixed for her, which was quite beloved to her.  It use to sit in our guest room, next to her heirloom vanity, where I would often watch her sit and do her makeup.

Lastly I have a large Saint Christopher pendant.  She'd been given this pendant by her Paternal Grandfather before he passed when she was very young - She always adored him.  She gave it to me to wear on a flight, and told me it would keep me safe, knowing how much I hate flying.  Needless to say, despite my cynical nature it worked, because I thought of her.

The night she passed, I had to go through her purse with her Mother to retrieve her Identification.  The medallion was the first thing I found, at the very top of her purse.

I'm not sure how old my Klee Kai is - Neko (after Neko Case) - She was strangely a stray that my Wife's grandfather rescued.  He spent months looking for her owner, even took out local radio ads but no one came forward.

Our thought was that she was around one year old.  Like any full-sized Husky (or Shiba Inu), she had plenty of energy early on, but was very very quiet (whereas my Sibe talks constantly to everyone possible).  She was fiercely independent in younger years - Just a head's up, the Husky-escaping-the-yard and tearing through the neighborhood impulse was very strong.  I once chased her three miles barefooted at 3am, through yards and major intersections alike.

But she has become very close and affectionate in the least six years, and has always been friendly and highly intelligent.  Whereas my Sibe is very communicative and excitable (despite his boomer pup age), she is demur but always close by, seeking affection.  She's also much better with encountering stranger pups and new people.

I won't make generalizations by saying that dating or relationships across the board are different now, but it does seem like there is a common thread people are detecting, where some are out to solely fulfill their needs on a shallow level, rather than doing so by fulfilling the needs of others.

Within a month after her passing, I found myself back at my local pub nightly, because honestly I couldn't be in our house, just couldn't, and good friends of mine were there nightly who had been there for me when she'd passed (although I hadn't seen them in years prior due to everything we had going on).

I pretty quickly found two friends of theirs who were around were always paying a lot of attention to me - One whom my Fiance and I had known in passing, one who I'd never met.  I started liking it, and for years (and sometimes still) I felt so guilty about this.  I didn't let anything happen at the time, even when one of these people propositioned me directly during a conversation.  But if I were to put myself in someone else's shoes, and even if something had happened, I would have told me that it's okay.

This is such a starkly lonely experience.  I think I craved the attention too because, I wanted to know that maybe I won't be alone forever - That maybe I could have another partner.  In reality, I think that was the most guilty thought I had by far.  But now, a few years out, I think it's a natural pressure valve on a situation I know I never thought I'd be in."
