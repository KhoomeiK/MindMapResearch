You don't address the fact that your free speech can be buried under multimillion dollar campaigns.

There is no argument that there is a bare minimum cost to voice yourself, what is the problem is that that voice is a squeak compared to the cacophony that paid for 'free speech' buys."

Other symptoms would be racing thoughts, a feeling like ice in your stomach, constant muscle tension, hard to concentrate, real hard to relax, sometimes feelings of frustration/annoyance/anger when it gets bad. 

Talk to your doctor or a therapist, perhaps changing your diet (that can help greatly), the longer you wait the more ingrained living like this will be and recovery will be longer.  Good luck."
