SuicideWatch,ff43cfj,t1_ff433ka,1579554638.0,"Then you should've been less ambiguous. Of course you only want warm kisses and to hear that everything is going to be okay. Don't worry, you'll never kill yourself with that attitude"
SuicideWatch,ff438b2,t1_ff435j3,1579554567.0,It is. It's a seductive relief
SuicideWatch,ff428q0,t1_ff426kp,1579553957.0,"It's a survival mechanism. Enjoy it, faggot"
SuicideWatch,ff41wu7,t1_ff3yp4r,1579553754.0,Weren't you looking for an opinion/input on your situation? Would you rather hear white soothing lies and forced care rather than honesty? Look at the top comment on your post. Do you feel any better now? Did it help? What the fuck do you want even.
SuicideWatch,ff41a3h,t1_ff416sg,1579553362.0,Me me me me me me me me me me me me me me me me me me me
SuicideWatch,ff418wc,t1_ff416sg,1579553342.0,Thank you for helping
SuicideWatch,ff40ufd,t1_ff3yp4r,1579553091.0,Weren't you likely going to kill yourself today anyway? As you have stated in the title? Why are you mad? Was it a gimmick? Gotta love this community
SuicideWatch,ff3xems,t1_ff3wcm8,1579550946.0,"You're looking at suicide from a sensualistic and ""righteous"" viewpoint. As if it's somethig strictly negative. People desire death. If you're suicidal you should at least not be dumb enough to have this shallow perspective on suicide. You're a sheep. ""Don't kill yourself, you have a life ahead of you"". Yeah sure"
SuicideWatch,ff3vr9p,t1_ff3vhm2,1579549912.0,"Aight, so you're putting an age restriction on suicide. Congratulations on being 31, asshole.

>You should clean yourself up and try to find a job

That's incredibly insightful and helpful of you. Is that an original idea?"
SuicideWatch,ff3ukdq,t3_erfr44,1579549171.0,Dude at this point I would honestly just do it. Hopefully I don't get to be held responsible because of a comment.
SuicideWatch,ff3tk18,t3_erhypi,1579548544.0,"Not morbid at all. For all we know the fall of the civilization could (though improbably) happen within our lifetimes.

I also let myself be immersed by the concept of my own death. It's fascinating in a macabe way. I wonder what will it be like to die by artery restriction"
SuicideWatch,ff3mieu,t1_ff3lr00,1579544220.0,No action is barren of intention and not all actions are reinforced consciously. I don't agree with you but you make a valid point.
SuicideWatch,ff3ljm2,t3_ergq4s,1579543620.0,"I'm in the same boat so I totally get you. Same age, college stress, loneliness, self harm, drug abuse, you name it. Managing horrible life of ours is all about the coping strategies.

Do you have anyone to talk to irl about the way you feel? Do you have any engaging hobbies? Is there any issue in particular you would want to discuss to narrow down the conversation?"
SuicideWatch,ff3l4cw,t1_ff3kw9a,1579543358.0,"What's the point of your post?

This subreddit is apparently made for sob stories. Look, if you were (or anyone else was) going to kill themselves truly, there would be no telling anybody. That could only disrupt the whole process. So you're not going to kill yourself today. You're lonely and depressed and want someone to talk you out of your alleged attempt."
SuicideWatch,ff3kt31,t3_ergose,1579543168.0,"Hopefully someone comments on your post and talks you out of it, right? Your intent is so firmly set that you have to tell someone in order to go through with it, right?"
SuicideWatch,ff3jldw,t1_fe6aiue,1579542431.0,Fuck you buddy
SuicideWatch,fe5ere6,t3_enu1mw,1578868543.0,"Dude I know this is probably not what you want to hear, but you always have your family. Someone you can fall back to. It's something at least.

Getting to be loved by the people you meet through life can be impossible on the other hand. And I totally get you here. But it almost seems as if the less desperate and yearning for love you try to be, the more likely it is for the situation to better itself spontaneously. You get to appear more self sufficient and thus more likable. And if you manage to steer your focus away from the negative aspects of your life you might catch yourself being grateful for the things you already have and improving your self esteem. It pays off to try to manage your mind by yourself and have only yourself as company while being fine with it.

It does sound like a bunch of clichÃ© bullshit but it never hurts to try."
SuicideWatch,fdhyqo7,t3_eldgnh,1578432597.0,"That's just the raw truth that's hard to swallow. You and me, we are alone and helpless. The sooner one comes to terms with that, the easier it is to finally go through with suicide"
Drugs,fddbks3,t1_fdcew07,1578304212.0,Thank you for your support
Drugs,fdbtw9m,t1_fdbsblv,1578262041.0,">and in general, they are useless

Wouldn't necessarily agree with that, as such concepts exist in our psyche for evolutionary purposes but the rest is on point. Great comment. Changing the source of influence seems important"
Drugs,fdbo3nw,t1_fdb417g,1578259349.0,"I feel you man. The short term plan would be quitting drugs, at least temporarily."
Drugs,fda80hk,t1_fda6qa3,1578242773.0,So how does one get started with that? I find it impossible to manage my emotions and be productive while sober.
