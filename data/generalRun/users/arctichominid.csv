CanadianForces,ffdw5lc,t1_ffcbvrz,1579830416.0,"Let's ground the conversation somewhat in practical terms:

The US military in the 1980's developed, tested and fielded equipment for use with laser guided munitions. The SOFLAM as man portable target designator, an onboard electronic target designation equipment for vehicles, planes, and other equipment.

Canada is not there. We have some equipment that works with the US hardware, but for the most part we have imaging hardware only. And of that, most of it is incomplete. Thanks in part to ITAR, which in practice is likely about 25% effective but only for man portable hardware most military's do not yet possess advanced night vision, or high resolution infrared imaging equipment.

What will likely happen in the next decade is that agencies like DARPA, and foreign entities will develop drones armed with explosives that are capable of homing in on targets emitted from even smaller, rifle mounted laser target designators. The drones will likely be deployed in the field, or based on a number of tests, deployed via high speed jet aircraft and conduct individual missions within an area. Either by remote, or by command and control on the ground.

Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan has seen the use of existing drone technology to the extent that it's likely to be expected that more advanced, non-RF guided drones delivering munitions onto the battlefield are common place in upcoming conflicts.

The US has relied on jamming drones. What likely needs to be developed is kinetic kill vehicles for destroying drones at a fraction of the cost of using existing anti-aircraft missile systems.

There is a high probability that the sort of drones you see in FPV drone racing, that is highly manueverable quad copters capable of carrying a payload of explosives across a limited or possibly protracted area.

An excellent example of this is the suspected Iranian attack on Saudi oil fields last year.

Sadly, no one is talking about it. The Saudi's likely had no radar warning capabilities because the drones were all much smaller than conventional ship or shore based missile systems. Defending your airspace against birds is an entirely different proposition than defending it against hardware that is 4-5 times larger.

That's the current arms race. And we're still stuck in the 1960's and 1970's."

SOPs don't start out the way they are. They're usually written in bloody little moments of idiocy that cost people their lives or their limbs, or were close enough that someone had a light bulb moment and said ""Let's do this better.""

Also, if you ever have an officer tell you to wear your helmet while helocasting into an open body of water during high winds and from an elevated height, tell them to go first.

I use this example often because it's an excellent example of well meaning contextual ignorance. It's bad because  your helmet was not designed for marine operations and absolutely will catch water. While your body cavitate's through water, it will cause your neck to separate from your spine. It doesn't take much force to do that if it's applied from below and at a constant rate. Both of which occur when you're dropping into water loaded up with kit.

But that's probably just another example of the dumbest bullshit ever.
