psychotherapy,fez0gfz,t1_fey2pwe,1579452733.0,I think it feels very unnatural as well! I feel like as clients start to build rapport with you and feel more comfortable and open around you that things like that won't matter or be as big of a deal. Especially if my overall body language was portrayed as open and approachable (which I try to do).
psychotherapy,fevzlfu,t1_fesmztc,1579403479.0,"Interesting! Has anyone ever brought anything up about it? (If I may ask). I heard from a professor that crossing your legs could suggest being closed off? And that I should try to not cross my legs, but that seemed a bit extreme to me."

psychotherapy,fesyss5,t1_fer5d89,1579370256.0,This is true! I've been told that the intake paperwork does a lot of the work for you in the first couple of sessions and helps you get a feel for the person. Thank you!
psychotherapy,fes8y05,t1_fes7eej,1579362677.0,"Yes! I, too, clasped my hands for both entire practice sessions I had with a classmate. It was fine, and I know I am able to sit still, but I know that as time goes on with a real client that doing the same thing where I sit with my hands clasped on my lap with both my feet on the ground might not be a very sustainable position in the long run. At least not for me lol."
psychotherapy,fes68zr,t1_fepjle7,1579361886.0,"I feel like your idea of fidgeting and my idea of it are different. Also, it sounds like perspectives differ from someone who has ADHD vs someone who does not, as well as from someone who struggles with anxiety and someone who does not. Either way, I'd like to encourage you to broaden your perspective on this topic and consider the benefits of this for both the client and the therapist :)"
psychotherapy,fes5ntr,t1_fer41fv,1579361674.0,"This is very true! Part of the micro skills hierarchy includes confrontation, and therapists are encourage to use it when they notice things like that. So you could say something along the lines of ""on one hand I hear you say that you are frustrated by X, Y, Z, But I keep hearing that you have taken no action to change it."" And maybe following that thought with something along the lines of ""what's one small step you could take within the next week to help with this situation?"""

psychotherapy,fepgy5b,t1_fep8noe,1579320224.0,"That's not the context in which one would be using fidgets at all, though. This is about when one is having more normal/regular interactions with a client and is meant to be used as a way to help you focus and be more still. Especially if you have ADHD it can be hard to sit on the same spot for very long without moving at all. Besides, I really don't believe that having a pen in your hand or some kind of small squishy or rubber is going to distract a client like that. That's getting blown wayyyyy out of proportion, lol. Most people have their own little quirks and things they do absentmindedly and, from what I've heard and read on this post, it can help other clients relax/feel more comfortable with their own fidgeting if there are fidgets available and such."

I actually think that once I start things off and get into a conversation that 90% of my nerves and feelings of uncertainty go away and I'm able to focus on the present conversation and let my personal style sort of take over and lead the way.

psychotherapy,fep3mpx,t1_feosvf8,1579311392.0,"The intake process for my clinic seemed so...charged. we have to go over informed consent (obviously) but then there's an intake form that's about 3 pages, AND we have to establish a safety plan with each and every client at the beginning of the first session as part of the intake. Seemed like a bit much for me but idk"

tifu,fcm205d,t1_fcllse2,1577762154.0,"That's not stupid or pathetic at all. It's not good for people to be alone. We all need somebody to lean on. Humanity is, at it's core, yearning and desperate for connection. It sounds like you are describing a relationship and a moment in which you felt loved, needed, wanted, and cared for. And that's not stupid what so ever üíï

I wonder if maybe part of your current misery has to do with a underlying fear...maybe you're afraid that you won't find love and connection like this again. Maybe you feel like this is somehow your fault, and that's what's scares you? 

I can see that you are a caring and supportive person, and that you were there for the moments he needed you most. He won't forget that, and just because you won't do what he wants right now doesn't mean you don't care for him"
tifu,fclldqq,t1_fclifwi,1577750500.0,What is it that's pulling you to him? What makes the attraction and the desire so strong that you're willing to risk everything for? Sometimes getting in touch with your why can help make things clearer

But soon enough life proved me right. A lot of times the right decisions will feel wrong because often times they're hard to make. You deserve someone who will be there without manipulating you and making you feel bad whenever you don't do something he says. You deserve someone who comes and doesn't leave üíï"

tifu,fc131hz,t3_eflfy0,1577306826.0,"I feel like everyone is just choosing to blame everything on you? And taking zero responsibility for anything. First of all, it's 100% THEIR choice for feeling ""offended"" or whatever that you didn't text back. You were working and officially you're not even supposed to be on your phone anyway. Also if they needed something that bad they should've just called you. Like of I really need something and the person isn't responding I at least give them a call/leave a voicemail or something or just go do it myself.
