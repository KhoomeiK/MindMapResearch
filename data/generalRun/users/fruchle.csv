""The ladies can touch you, but you can't touch the ladies.""

If an octopus wants to touch you, and you want to let it, that's fine.

If you want to touch the octopus, get out of the water, go home and think about what you did wrong."

smartwatch,ffaohf2,t1_ff96c9u,1579740764.0,"Two problems - screen size affects usability and battery life. Battery life is the absolute killer. Radios use a lot of power.

Good phones these days have 4000+mAh batteries. A watch could hold... 500mah? At best?

Once batteries get a major upgrade, we can talk again.

(But like others have said, you can easily by a phone-watch online.)"

AskReddit,feda24o,t1_fed2j5i,1579005261.0,"Just to be clear, ""not powerful"" is not the same as ""under powered"". If you think there is no middle ground with a reasonable amount of power, then there is much in life you will find frustrating.

A ""family sedan"" has more than enough power to do most everything a normal human needs a car to do.

A peel p50 could be considered ""underpowered"", maybe.

The Honda CBR125RR is track raced. Plenty of power.

A 50cc vespa is potentially underpowered."

AskReddit,fed27br,t1_fecw6gz,1578995028.0,"Far, far from underpowered. A 1996 250cc bike will still do 100mph/160kmph if you push it. A modern 300cc bike? More.

Anything over 60mph is fast enough / too fast, unless you're on a track."
