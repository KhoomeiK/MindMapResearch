One thing to note, however, is that the main reason extenders aren't allowed by the spec is due to signal integrity issues, not power concerns. It's actually pretty easy to make a cable that can deliver small amounts of power, even ones that can be chained together. What's much more difficult is making a cable that can send a few billion 1's and 0's a second.

Usually the problem you run into when using an extender cable like this is that the system won't be able to talk to the device. If your just charging something it's not a problem."

I wonder how long this factory was making pots with helmets. This video makes it seem like they were producing them pretty fast, i wouldn't be surprised if they ran out of helmets pretty quickly."
