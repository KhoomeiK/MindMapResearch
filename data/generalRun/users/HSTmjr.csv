Futurology,ffr1lym,t1_ffqrkm3,1580148469.0,"That's totally false though. The polar caps are melting and everyone is lining up to exploit that new oil fields. Fracking is still fairly underdone and has massive room for growth.

My point is if your best arguement is that it's only profitable to go green than you are sadly mistaken.

Going green must solely be a moral/ethical choice or we are fucked"
news,ffr0x5n,t3_eun7kg,1580148030.0,"I remember one of Trumps brain dead speeches about how great it was that Pennsylvania had these pipelines being built while New York state did not. How great to see brand new cars in Pennsylvania from the business while New York was all old cars.

Well this is why they opposed the pipes you piece of shit"
nba,ffmjp31,t1_ffjzctd,1580055621.0,"I always find that line of thought backwards. 

Good amount of guys today practice 3s alot but just aren't that great at them.

Shooting in the nba is more than just practice. Theres a certain degree hand eye coordination/focus under duress that separates two people who equally put in hard work into something"
JoeRogan,ffj059p,t1_ffisv1k,1579987043.0,"For every pro tankie on the sub there is a anarchist or trot making fun of them. Most leftist spaces attract all different types and tankies are definitely a small minority 

It's long running meme on the sub about the Maoist ""Communism will arrive in 100 years of Party Rule"""
NBASpurs,ff3iuih,t3_erb4s3,1579541972.0,"We can disagree with Pop if we want to, no harm in that.
Which is way different than calling for Pop to resign/retire/or take a leave. Hes earned the right to do that whenever he choose.
Saying nobody can be called on their present day mistakes is silly though. Nobody can stay golden forever.

Truth though he has done a good job with the pieces he has. I just wish he stopped his personal crusade againist the 3 ball"
nba,fethg7j,t1_feqvfd9,1579375517.0,"No not really and he probably only saw a few minuets his rookie year as a 3 before it was clear he wasnt.

The early 00s nba was very weird and scouts thought it was possible to play super long athletic guys like Tyson and Darius Miles at the 3 and just let them dunk defend and run on people. Those were silly dreams though lol"
MurderedByWords,fepbhu4,t1_feofnkx,1579316475.0,"I dont know how it is in most of the world but UK and Australia also have very trash bootlicking poltical commentary. 

I would say UK is the worst since there is just so many of them and they are egregious liars"
nba,feo1evi,t3_eq2vh4,1579293797.0,"Who remembers this guy was drafted as a potential Small Forward back in the day lmao

nba,fenz2pz,t3_eq31r7,1579292924.0,"All it takes is one really bad playoff loss and the most ""loyal"" player will look elsewhere.

Not that loyalty to these sharks counts for anything"
offmychest,fenyb6c,t1_fenw9bv,1579292602.0,Lmao true
offmychest,fenioco,t1_fen81y7,1579285524.0,The gap between lifetime income potential between those with degrees and those without is insanely large - and getting worse
offmychest,fenieb0,t1_fenaefc,1579285351.0,"There is still a lot of value in getting a degree not in STEM, Trade School , or Medicine.

We still need a ton of people capable of writing, researching, and communicating.

I think the main problem right now is theres a lot of grads who pursue these degrees without understanding how valuable things like a writing portfolio, networking events, and internships are. A lot think I'll just focus on my diploma and do the bare minimum. If you want a Liberal Arts degree you have to get your hands dirty with the extra cariculures- I learned that the hard way"
offmychest,fenhqgy,t1_fen6u2v,1579284942.0,I read a stat that the majority of grads dont directly use their degrees in their jobs. So that's the norm I guess.
nba,fde78r7,t3_ekl3hw,1578332713.0,Shame on Westbrook that was really petty. Bodyguard doesnt even give him a warning just tosses him
nba,fdbx3eb,t1_fdbq3hu,1578263270.0,"You really don't know how quick young Shaq moved. He routinely was the focal point of a 90s Magic fastbreak

Of those guys you listed only KG was faster or more agile"
seduction,fda3dte,t3_ek8hzf,1578241187.0,"So some strange advice from this post. Lotta stuff you would get from girls like ""be confident!"" and ""be yourself!"" Disappointing to read

So as a shy guy you dont have to be the life of the party but you do have to master crafting informative sentences. You cant just be shy and give small answers with no information 

What I mean is when talking you still need to demonstrate your value either through confident flirting or signs your an active social guy. If you master short and sweet answers that leave people CURIOUS they will try to fill in the blanks themselves if they like you.

Being shy also doesnt mean you have to sound quiet. Practice speaking loudly too so you cant easily be ignored"

coolguides,fc9yalx,t1_fc8ykg3,1577560016.0,"I thought the US and other western nations generally bury the plastic waste versus these countries who throw into the ocean. I read that burying is far less harmful, though obviously still shit compared to recycling"
starterpacks,fc48tpd,t3_eg0gxa,1577409745.0,"The militarization of American police is only a very recent phenomenon but has caused a lot of issues. Economic wise they are a money hole and socially it changes the police mentally from civil servants into under siege soliders

I forgot what publication did a excellent right up about it after the Missouri protests broke out"
