I would 1. be careful about certain subjects you talk about that may be sensitive now 2. Pay attention to her and how she acts. Remind her that schools have Therapist and its free to students. This could be helpful to let some emotions out in a healthy way 3. Avoid saying things like ""things happen for a reason"" "" Shes/Hes with god now"" 4. Come over and do laundry/cook a meal/ clean a bit if you have time 5. She may be distant so checkup regularly if you can and try to keep her company. 

Grief can be quick for some people and others it never ends so dont put a time stamp on it for her. And honestly the grieving process may not fully kick in since you are in the middle of school because your brain is also focused on that. In the end there isn't much you can say that will help but actions go a long way during this time."

drawing,ffwca46,t3_evij5n,1580295028.0,It looks great. My input would be to look closer at the creases (?) In the hand. Naturally the real hand has creases that look more like a Y on the palm while your drawing has a horizontal line across.

BlackDesertMobile,ffc2uxg,t1_ffbw96y,1579790166.0,Thank you for this comment. I really dont understand why people had to be so rude. Its a game and people post accomplishments on here offten. Plus I was already stressed out when this pulled for non-game related stuff and it made the moment just happy.

ArtistLounge,fehta60,t3_ep8dhm,1579123433.0,"When doing a quick search it looks like Titebond 2 keeps coming up and is water resistant. Another thing you could think about is cutting out the paper for the canvas, water coloring it first then glueing it down to the wood. That way you might have more leeway on finding glue that works but you wont be working on a finished canvas."
