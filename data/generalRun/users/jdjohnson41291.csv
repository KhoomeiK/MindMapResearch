SuicideWatch,fgu6jmh,t3_f09khz,1581114074.0,"Don't shit on someone else's existence because you wanna go. Truck drivers don't need that extra stress on them. You wanna go so bad, go without inflicting trauma to others directly... Of course I would rather wish you wouldn't go but definitely do be ignorant about it and drag someone else down."
arizona,fgs526z,t3_f06xhu,1581071978.0,That's a beautiful quick sketch. As I kid I got in trouble for that plenty at school. I also once drew the rocks old bill tattoo on my arm and went to sleep after school on my dad's new leather couch. He loved that most let me tell you lol.

HumansBeingBros,fgl4cd6,t3_eyzmu8,1580881605.0,As I always say to these posts. I wish this guy the absolute best in life. He can always have a beer on me.
news,fgl0qzs,t1_fgkyf7s,1580878505.0,"Of course. I appreciate your comment as well, I definitely do. My mother who's not my grandma's daughter is the same way too so I was stuck with it either way from both sides haha. Enjoy your night my friend. And always remember even with the Michael Vick dog bust. A lot of those dogs got adopted. Some had to be put down (two or three) but over twenty I believe made it out and to loving homes. Love can do wonders."

news,fgknu9b,t1_fgknn9k,1580869765.0,"Always. Unless he's begging obnoxiously or won't get off of my chest. Then I complain and he's just like ""if I walk away for two seconds, we be good"" and he's sadly right lol"
news,fgknol7,t1_fgkmd9l,1580869670.0,"That was probably the case with the previous owner. He wasn't ""fighter"" enough for them so they threw him out. Its disgusting honestly. Your dogs smile reminds me so much of mine I love it. My other pit who wasn't a rescue had the same issues you talk about with other dogs. I believe his came from people in my grandma's hood walking by with their dogs and harassing him. He was big, strong and beautiful. They use to ask me if they could ""walk him around the corner and breed him""..... Yeah that's a fuck no from me dog and then the shotty sat by the front door.

My rescue Bud also has severe anxiety. He will attempt to chew thru a door or completely flatten a doorknob if he feels he's being left behind. He doesn't do that often, twice honestly but he does lick allllllllllllll the time if I don't tell him not to. Definitely anxiety based. Some dogs just have their boundaries and we learn them we go and we change or reflect what works best for them. Keep being amazing and taking him out to the patio to interact with the people. I'm sure he appreciates the hell out of the extra love. I truly appreciate the human being you are. You can help change the minds of others. They're not landsharks. They're just built beautifully and for that, taken advantage of. Much love my friend."
news,fgkmswm,t1_fgkmc26,1580869137.0,I appreciate you. Where he is on me now is his preferred spot. He would've made a better blanket lol.
