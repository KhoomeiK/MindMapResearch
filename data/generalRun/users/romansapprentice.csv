So while the Commonwealth may be ""safer"" in that there would be less baddies out there, ie super mutants, feral ghouls, they wouldn't help society progress further than that I don't think. Nothing like the NCR or the Followers."

And how do you think you can do any of these things if you cannot write properly? If you cannot write, you cannot communicate your ideas. This is especially an issue at the graduate level. You have student performing experiments that they then cannot write lab reports about. I know multiple students that pay other people thousands of dollars to write the data analysis of their experiments because they can't do it themselves. I've had multiple STEM professors -- scientists, CSI instructors, etc -- vent to me about how none of their students can write and will therefore fail their classes. 

The entire backbone of science is curiosity and analysis -- that you see something, you question it, you wonder if you do XYZ to it if something different will happen, you test it, you record it.

I think people can get very disillusioned and confused about the purpose of the humanities if they've had a shitty experience.

changemyview,feed0m6,t3_eomspd,1579031228.0,"What basis do you have for this argument?

Japan was basically being run by the War Council at this point. Even AFTER it was confirmed that an atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima and that it was basically leveled, the War Council still REFUSED to surrender. 

So dropping an atomic bomb on a place that was a major city didn't deter the Japanese military into surrendering, so why would you think the Americans dropping it in the middle of the sea would have? 

I don't think you can truly have an educated option on this issue without first taking the time to learn about the methodology and culture of the Japanese Imperialists at the time. The tl;dr is that the Japanese full well knew that if the American invaded, they would lose. They knew it was over. They refused to surrender anyways. They hoped that if they sacrificed enough millions of their own people, and caused enough devastation to the invading Americans, that the Americans would be so horrified at the death tolls on both sides that they'd agree to an armistice instead. Japan has literally been training kindergartners for years at that point how to sharpen bamboo and stab people to death, they were going to have their military dress in civilian clothing so the Americans would be forced to mow down every man, woman, and child they encountered. The Japanese Imperalists mass murdered their own citizens as they were evacuating out of Manchuria. That's the way of thinking the people controlling Japan had at the time, you are operating under the assumption that the Japanese War Council (the war hawks, at least) gave a shit about their civilians -- they didn't."
changemyview,feebxi8,t3_eoerpz,1579030593.0,">If you see a pic of a skinny person, you don’t see comments asking whether they smoke cigs, how much they drink, whether they ate too little or exercised too much, whether they slept well, whether they drank 8 glasses of water that day, whether they purged to fit into that swimsuit. Why? Because it’s ridiculous and none of your business and impossible to give an accurate health assessment based on a photo

Being skinny is not a health concern. Being fat is.

A more accurate comparison would be between a smoker and someone who is very overweight. Is every single smoker on earth unhealthy? No. Will some live very long lives and seemingly not have any repercussions for their situation, which statistically dramatically raises your chances of death? Yes. But just like Smoker Aunt Suzy living to 102 without developing lung cancer isn't ""proof"" that smoking doesn't raise your chances of getting it, the same can be said about fat people and heart disease.

People don't make these comments on skinny peoples' profiles because being skinny is not a health risk -- being fat in and of itself is, regardless of the context and why you're fat. Being malnourished is a genuine health concern, but you can literally do that at any size, including when you're super morbidly obese.

>Yet I don’t see half of the “disgust” and outrage over pics of extremely skinny women as I do over larger women. People might express some kind concern in the most extreme cases (and I’m talking ribs showing), but then it’s mostly kind and gentle without name calling or cruel judgments.

Did you never read any of the comments that people like Eugenia Cooney got? Most of them were cruel. And actually, as a skinny person, I constantly get rude comments both online and irl about being too skinny, anyone else I know male and female -- have received the same. So I'm not sure exactly what ig accounts you're looking at lol. Just yesterday I was watching an episode of that Cheapskates show on TLC on YouTube, the comments were filled with people mocking this guy's teenage daughters because they said they looked like they were ill, they were dying, the dad must only be feeding them table scrapes and someone should call CPS. Both the kids had 6 packs.

Over 60% of America is fatter than they should be. I'd argue that this is such a problem in America that skinny people are absolutely mocked for their weight -- people who wouldn't even be seen as skinny in most countries, just as average people, and even in some countries like in South Asia would actually be seen as fat, are now labeled gross and anorexic because they aren't overweight like the rest of America.

>Also, anorexia is the most deadly mental disorder. Not binge eating. Anorexia.  
>  
>**But those who simply binge are lazy slobs who have no excuse?**

Binge eating =/= overeating.

Binge eating is not simply overeating, it is a specific eating disorder with a specific set of behaviors. People with binge eating will sit down and eat thousands upon thousands of calories, violently throw up, yet keeping eating. To the point where they aren't enjoying themselves and aren't even tasting the food or getting any happiness from it, they're eating that way because of their disorder. That is very different than someone who just eats because they like to, or they're using it to fill an emotional void, etc. Being overweight does NOT mean you binge or have binge eating disorder, the majority of overweight people don't.  Someone like Amberlynn Reid is 600 pounds, but doesn't have binge eating disorder. This is a very unhelpful misconception when dealing with eating disorders and the obesity epidemic in general.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

And all of this agreeing with your main argument, I guess -- if you're just commenting on some random dude's ig and telling him he's fat, yeah, you probably don't actually care about his health at all. I think what mainly bothers people though is when people try to make excuses for obesity, argue that it has a right to be normalized, that it isn't as dangerous as it truly is. That's completely different, and I feel oftentimes ""you don't actually care about XYZ's health, you just want to mock them"" often devolves into that type of excusing obesity trend, and even this post does it. I think that's mainly what gets people."

>Also, anorexia is the most deadly mental disorder. Not binge eating. Anorexia.  
>  
>**But those who simply binge are lazy slobs who have no excuse?**

Binge eating =/= overeating.

Binge eating is not simply overeating, it is a specific eating disorder with a specific set of behaviors. People with binge eating will sit down and eat thousands upon thousands of calories, violently throw up, yet keeping eating. To the point where they aren't enjoying themselves and aren't even tasting the food or getting any happiness from it, they're eating that way because of their disorder. That is very different than someone who just eats because they like to, or they're using it to fill an emotional void, etc. Being overweight does NOT mean you binge or have binge eating disorder, the majority of overweight people don't.  Someone like Amberlynn Reid is 600 pounds, but doesn't have binge eating disorder. This is a very unhelpful misconception when dealing with eating disorders and the obesity epidemic in general.

And all of this agreeing with your main argument, I guess -- if you're just commenting on some random dude's ig and telling him he's fat, yeah, you probably don't actually care about his health at all. I think what mainly bothers people though is when people try to make excuses for obesity, argue that it has a right to be normalized, that it isn't as dangerous as it truly is. That's completely different, and I feel oftentimes ""you don't actually care about XYZ's health, you just want to mock them"" often devolves into that type of excusing obesity trend, and even this post does it. I think that's mainly what gets people."

And it's not Gaelic. Don't call it that near any actual Irish people that can speak Irish. 8\^)"
therewasanattempt,fcv172z,t1_fcnem28,1577992533.0,">First off.. it's called gaelic.

No. It's not. Gaelic isn't a language -- it is a subcatagorization of the Celtic languages which includes Irish, Scottish Gaelic, and Manx. Saying you speak Gaelic would be like you saying ""I speak Germanic"" instead of saying you speak English. ""Gaelic"" is only used by ignorant Americans and British people who don't realize that that term was coined by people who actively tried to irradiate Irish people. So you as a non-Irish person are actually trying to tell me as an Irish person what I should be called, using the terms the people who murdered my family used. Lmfao. You saying ""Gaelic"" out loud is just more evidence that you have no clue what being Irish actually is, you only know what your whoever whose great great great great great grandmother was Irish has told you. Which is nothing.  

>They weren't treated like black people.. they were treated worse.

LMFAO. In most states, you could literally beat a black person to death in full view of anyone and get away with it, masters raped even their male slaves for fun, you could sell black people because they weren't seen as human beings, they were legally and socially considered property. You could not do any of that to an Irish person.

>After the black slaves were freed in america, the irish ones were not

You realize that less than a single percent of the Irish who came over to America could be considered slaves? A high amount of indentured servants were Irish for two sole generations, which is absolutely nothing like chattel slavery like black people faced. Comparing someone willingly signing over to work for XYZ amount of years is nothing like a boat coming to your town as your sisters and mother are raped, beheaded, and you're forcibly sent to another country to die.

>Irish people in America have had their culture ripped away and if they try to even talk about it..

You don't even know what language they speak, what would you know about what it means to be Irish? Irish-Americans ""don't know"" their culture just like all the other millions upon millions of people whose families have lived in America for many generations.

And FYI, the reason why the knowledge of ""Irish culture"" is poorer when compared to other nations is because the British forcibly colonized Ireland -- beat and imprisoned and starved people for speaking Irish or anything representing the Old Ways. You go to Ireland today not in Connemara and it just looks and acts like England. A lack of Irish culture is because it was forcibly irradiated and beaten out of them by the British -- it has nothing to do with America -- the vast, vast majority of Irish were Christians who only spoke English by the time America was even first colonized.

If anything, you can find older Irish culture in America more than even Ireland itself -- more people can speak Irish fluently in America than even in Ireland itself. You see MORE Irish culture in America than in Ireland, not less, lmfao.

>And you're not fucking Irish you fucking pick, you don't even know what the language is called, or the basic history..

**""Irish"" is sometimes erroneously referred to as ""Gaelic."" The Irish language should never be referred to as ""Gaelic"" because doing so is historically, socially, formally, and linguistically wrong. ""Gaelic"" is now correctly applied to the principal historic language of Scotland, although it also was referred to (in English) as ""Irish"" for most of its history. The distinction is not subtle: ""Irish"" refers to the native language of Ireland, and ""Gaelic"" refers to the major native language of Scotland, although the term came into common usage only in the past two hundred years, or less.**[**\[12\]**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_language#cite_note-12)[**\[13\]**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_language#cite_note-13) [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish\_language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_language)

Lol, you mix up completely different groups of people (because they're all the same to you, right?), use the same word that the people who murdered over half the country call them, clearly don't know about the colonization of Ireland which is literally the most relevant thing to happen, and then try to tell people who are actually Irish what it means to be Irish when you have likely never stepped foot in Ireland yourself.

He was told by immigration authorities that he was in the right. Why should he have assumed otherwise? Who said he wasn't trying to become a legal resident again anyways? The articles don't mention it one way or another, he could have been for all we know.

>He has a birth claim for Thai residency

No, he doesn't. He was a refugee born in a refugee camp in Thailand. He is not Thai and would not be considered a Thai citizen or resident. It's not the same thing. ""If you're born here, you're our citizen"" is a thing in the USA, but not for many other countries.

>a claim via his parents, presumably, for Cambodia.

No, he doesn't. He's not Cambodian. You can't just deport someone to a country they've never been to because their parents were from there. You cannot ever modify anyone's legal case in such a way over consideration of what their parents did or are from, that is, again, illegal.

>Is it true neither country would accept him? I did not see that mentioned in the article.

That's how deportation works with literally every country. A country isn't going to accept a random person that's never been to their country ever and was never a citizen of your country at any point because another country -- two that don't even have good relationships with the USA, mind you -- because another country demands them to. Why would they? That's such a liability. That country is going to be the one paying money to help feed and house a person that isn't even theirs. Of course they'd send them away. Do you think we'd accept a million people from Guatemala because they sent them over with a ""please trust us on this guys, they're def yours""? Of course not. No country is accepting people if you can't prove they're actually from there -- there's huge amount of outrage in various places on earth over it going on right now over it, with millions of people dislocated and in limbo. That'd be an extremely unfortunate precedent for Thailand and Cambodia to set anyways -- they'd have a shit ton of people demanding to come in because they were born in a camp there and want to leave whatever country they're in now, or that they're parents are from there so they legally should be let in too. Even in terms of legalities just in America, we cannot deport someone until we have proven country of origin (for the reason listen before). So even if Cambodia or Thailand were to accept them (they wouldn't), we couldn't send them to those placed in the first place, we'd be breaking our own laws.

>And why is it ""illegal"" or ""immoral"" to send him to either one?

It's been explained to you multiple times why it's illegal -- the ACLU advocates have explained why it's illegal -- the judge has said why it was illegal -- idk what more you want me to say, honestly. You can't send someone to a country that you don't have the legal right to send them to. He was never a resident of Cambodia or Thailand. You can't just send someone to any Asian country because you figure they're similar enough.

For it being immoral, it's the same reason why me sending you to Nigeria or Vietnam or Russia would be immoral. You are sending someone to a country full well knowing they would have no way to survive -- nobody to communicate with, likely no way to get housing or even food themselves, no realistic way to get a job. You'd send someone to a place with no ability to communicate, just asking for them to be preyed upon. you're sending someone to a situation full well knowing they are completely unequipped to live there and will be completely taken advantage of. On a scale of one to ten, how well would you do if I drove you down to Tijuana and kicked you out of the car? Don't answer with how you haven't robbed anyone and were born here, that wasn't the question. ""But I'm not Mexican!!"", well, you aren't from Tijuana just as much as this man isn't from Cambodia. 

>I'm assuming he has seen immigration judges multiple times. He's had legal counsel.

He was not properly notified and was not given the time for him to build his own case or file the paperwork he is legally entitled to. Please read the article.

Yeah, he's had legal council. They're saying his rights have been violated.

>Why, exactly, is he our obligation?

How is he our obligation now? The only ""obligation"" here is the obligation that every single  human being in the United States gets -- a fair trial. You are advocating that we get rid of that. What happens when it's no longer the random refugee you don't like that's having his rights violated by federal authorities, but yours? Your family's? Why should we care then if you yourself didn't care when it was happening to other people? That's our ""obligation"", and that's why it's an obligation. So that everyone can have that fair trial. And everyone deserves one. There's a great many countries that don't see it the same way -- China, Russia, North Korea..."

>Any immigrant from anywhere can and often are deported for committing serious crimes. I know of a number of people from Britain who would take care to fully stop at stop signs while their residency applications were pending.

Because they're British...there's a place they can be deported back to...he can't...this isn't rocket science.

>Whether he should go to Cambodia or Thailand isn't really relevant. Either one will do.

Wouldn't you know it, the United States government and our laws actually don't act depending upon what you think is and isn't good enough? And that Cambodia and Thailand actually don't care what you think about the matter at all either? I love that people keep pointing out that Cambodia and Thailand would both refuse to accept them, he would immediately be back in the United States even if we did go through with deporting him (which we won't), but you keep ignoring that.

>He had years to attain citizenship, did not, and committed several serious crimes. Why can't he be deported? Two separate and serious criminal convictions - for which he was judged guilty - should be enough.

Because there's nowhere to deport him to. This has been explained to you, very slowly, multiple times by multiple people.

&#x200B;

Maybe you don't think there's a big difference between Cambodia and Thailand because you think they're the same, and you don't care that a government agency is knowingly and blatantly violating peoples' rights and refusing to give people fair trials, but ThE ReSt Of Us do. This guy isn't getting deported. He won't be deported. He can't be deported. It's as simple as that, no matter what you or I yelling on Reddit say."

>For the past nine months, Kim has been held at the Franklin County House of Correction in Greenfield. ICE seeks to deport Kim in January to Cambodia, a place heâ€™s never been.""

He was a greencard holder \[likely as soon as he could\], then was in jail, then was released upon the condition that he check in with them as per immigration authorities, he did, then they suddenly told him they weren't going to do that anymore. He was either a legal resident or in direct contact with ICE the entire time he's been there. Fine, forget that, regardless they have not sent him any of the documentation or given him proper notification for any of the deportation hearing that he is LEGALLY ENTITLED TO. You cannot do that -- it is illegal, you are violating their rights, they cannot be deported off of that alone. You cannot just pull minorities off the street and start deporting them because you feel like you have a good enough reason to, you need to go through and have a hearing to do that, you need to notify them, you need to give them the ability to defend themselves because ""innocent until proven guilty"" is a basic foundation of our court system that doesn't get thrown in the trash just because the person wasn't born within our borders.

Besides that, becoming a citizen of this country when you're from a country that has high immigration rates, you will be waiting many decades and paying thousands upon thousands of dollars, shipped back to whatever country you came from each decade, to eventually, maybe, become a citizen. Our ""pathways"" to becoming a legal citizen are extremely broken, both sides of the aisle unanimously agree with this, so I honestly don't get why people keep parroting ""lulz just become legal"" as if that's in any way possible and obtainable for most people they're talking about. Should he have just gone back to that now likely-nonexistent refuge camp back in Thailand to wait a decade or two for our country to get its shit together? All while he probably doesn't speak Thai and knows nothing about Thailand? That's literally the only other option? That's why I posed the example of Nigeria, doing that would make no sense at all. He's as much Thai as you are Nigerian -- not culturally, not ethnically, not legally.

&#x200B;

>If we can't deport people for armed robbery and assault, which seems to be your argument, for what criminal offenses can we deport them, legally or morally speaking?

I never said he shouldn't be deported. I said you can't just start deporting people to wherever you feel like sending them to. If you cannot prove that ABC person is from XYZ country, you can't deport them to it. The country you're sending them to will refuse to accept them, they will put them right back on the boat they came on to send them back to America. You can't just take someone out of their home and illegally deport them to Cambodia because they seem Cambodian enough to you, even though they've never been to Cambodia. Which is what you're suggesting they do. Which is not legal. Which is why the ACLU is upset, why the judge is upset, and why he's going to end up staying in this country, because they legally can't do anything else.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

The issue isn't even his criminal record. It's 1) ICE has not been following proper procedure to deport someone, and 2) we don't really have anywhere to deport him to. You repeating that he's a violent offender may be an emotionally gripping argument, but doesn't have anything to do with why his deportation is an issue rn."

>Nor was I born in Nigeria.

Nor was he born in Cambodia.

And he left Thailand when he was 6. ""Left"" being a very flexible word, in that he was a refugee, thus never actually a Thailand resident at any point of those 6 years -- so probably knows nothing about Thailand anyways, he would have been segregated with other Cambodians. Lord knows, if you leave a refugee camp at 6, you will be completely fluent in that language and be able to function there as a 4-whatever year old man anyways.

You asked if someone's citizenship status is in question, we can't deport them? The answer is that you can't, it doesn't matter what context you add onto it. Nicaragua and Guatemala would be dropping a few million people off each on our border if that was in any way legal. I'm telling you, no matter if you think it's justified or not, we a nation are not allowed to do that. The other country won't accept them anyways, they'd be turned back.

Do you think judges love deciding in a way which shows federal agencies are completely incompetent? ICE did not do what they are legally obligated to do, they have keep medication from him (which is highly illegal and against international law), they don't even have any legal right to deport this guy to Thailand or Cambodia anyways. Yet another lawsuit of a federal agency breaking laws and violating human rights, yet you're more concerned with sending a guy halfway across the world to a place he's never been to. Alright lol"

The government must establish where a person came from before they deport them to that place. No, you can't just send someone off to a place that they may have never been to, where that other country has absolutely no legal obligation to take them.  The idea that you can just drop off illegal immigrants onto another country just because is not allowed, and for (hopefully) obvious reason.

No, you shouldn't be deporting people to XYZ country if you don't know if that's where they actually came from. What if I took you and just deported you to the middle of Nigeria?
