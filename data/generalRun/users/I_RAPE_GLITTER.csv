Have your productivity measured down to tenths of a percentage and micromanaged in order to elevate the status of your superiors. If they like you, then you might succeed. Otherwise, expect a 2ish or 3% raise per year in exchange for endless amounts of personal suffering and anxiety. I do this and I'm supposed to feel ""thankful"".

A college degree doesn't guarantee you a better life. I'm treated exactly the same as those with twice my education."
