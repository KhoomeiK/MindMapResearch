RandomActsOfTf2,fcgquoz,t3_egynia,1577643067.0,"A small little experience from my childhood. There was a bird outside the door to my apartments and it just stood there, Looking at me. I didn't wanna come near it because I was scared it would attack or had rabies or smth so I also just looked at it. This was not very effective as we were on the third floor and the bird had nowhere to go, I realized after far too long. So instead I went back down the stairs and went to a friends place to have fun. 

I don't have many stories so this is the best I could do. Thank you for the giveaway!"
