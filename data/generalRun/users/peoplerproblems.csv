They have long incubation periods, are highly contagious, and kill quickly once active.

Pneumonia is also a symptom. Not a disease. Yes it can kill you, but without an autopsy you need to go for the most likely answer. Which in this case is the virus."

You need a transmitter, and a receiver. Whatever you drive or fly or sail, it's up to you. Cheapest to start is probably a Flite Test model, as you can make them for the cost of foam board and electronics. Then just crash them as much as you need to to learn. You'll need a hot glue gun and some tape. Otherwise Horizon Hobby or Hobbyking can provide prebuilt trainers as well.
