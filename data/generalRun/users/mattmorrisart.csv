drawing,ff2jemp,t3_er6kcf,1579508824.0,"If you're thinking of tattooing, pull together a portfolio. Include your favorite pieces, things that you are proud of. Go to your local tattoo shops with it and ask about apprenticeships.

Tattooing is not the same as drawing. At all. There is a lot to learn about art and design, the machine side of it, and safety. You don't want to spread diseases or contract one yourself by mistake. Or fuck someone up by practicing on them.

Why a shop instead of YouTube and practice? Simple: more teachers. You'll learn a ton and when you're ready to practice you'll have specific guides advice to supplement your experience. It's so helpful to have someone talk to you while you do something. It's a place customers are already seeking out, so more canvas to practice on. It's also generally the only way to LEGALLY do it.

Tattooing has been good to me for the past 15 years. Respect the trade and get in to it the right way and it can be lucrative and rewarding for you too!"

gardening,fd4ij0m,t1_fd3azcp,1578167799.0,"I've practiced bonsai for 19 years. I was taught by a super cool old gentleman who learned while living in Okinawa for 20 years. He passed a tree down to me that I've had for 15 years. I do not know its actual age, but I'm the third caretaker, and I can account for 65 years of it's long life.

It's an indoor tree. Many bonsai are not kept outdoors during the winter. All bonsai nurseries have greenhouses for this purpose.

A ficus can absolutely be used for bonsai. Virtually any tree that doesn't have a tap root can be used (traditionally bonsai are kept in very shallow pots, so if the species requires deep roots it's not suitable). Azaleas are an example of a ""non tree"" that have been used in bonsai for hundreds of years.

The upkeep varies by species, but it isn't incredibly difficult to keep a bonsai alive, provided you have the knowledge and (most importantly) patience.

It's been a truly rewarding art form for me, and taught me much about patience, planning, and flexibility. I recommend it to anyone who is interested in plants."
