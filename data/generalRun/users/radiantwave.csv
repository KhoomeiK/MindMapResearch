I Hate it when people claim knowledge on Asian ethnicity who don't understand shit. Specifically as a caucasian American with a Chinese born wife who has grown up in OC... I tend to be a little sensitive to it.  I hear shit from other non-Asians about stereotypes all the time and it absolutely grinds my gears. 

Well, this morning when researching the issues I saw an article on ""Asian population in OC... And they talked about Chinese population at schools, and influx of Chinese immigrants buying homes, Chinese bla, Chinese bla bla... The article was specifically titled, ""OC now Third largest ASIAN population in USA..."" but By the time I finished reading it I literally brain farted the Asian 1/3 title to the  article's referencing Chinese population growth in OC. Holy shit did I pull a dumb...

worldnews,ffifrdd,t1_ffid4mw,1579972809.0,"Yes and no... Think about it like this... This is a new virus and they had no idea what they had on their hands. It takes time to figure this out just from a mapping of the virus. Once they realised it was a new virus they had to come up with a plan of attack, so they published the results to the world wide medical community and asked for help. Worked with these medical professionals to determine how bad it was and then act appropriately. All of this is a tough thing to do, something made worse by doomsday panic. The big thing was the Chinese government did this day one. That is unprecedented for them. 

One of the reasons it is so hard to align the R0 today is that anyone with a sniffle is running to the hospital terrified that they are going to die. While some are infected, most are not... But they probably now will be because they all were just hanging out with infectious people for 12 hours in a line waiting to be tested. 

Add to that the hospitals running out of supplies because everyone wants to be tested. And that every one of them considers their own problem to be the most important thing the hospital needs to do. 

What the Chinese government is doing is trying to calm people down... Granted they have a tendency to go overboard but often times that is due to people being stressed and not working together. 

Shutting down the celebrations and restricting travel and trying to build new hospitals and offering to pay for anyone's treatment... Let me say this had this happened in the US... Our government wouldn't have gone this far in less than a months time... So you ask if I think China is doing a good job... I think they are doing the best they can with what they have and what they knew in just a 30 day time frame."
worldnews,fficygg,t1_ffibk6j,1579970911.0,"I actually do not, they ARE erroring on the side of downplaying the virus and only reporting confirmed cases. This means there are a lot of people showing up at hospitals with normal flu symptoms who just have the flu or a cold. But this is more than likely ending up exposing them to the actual coronavirus while their immune systems are already under attack.

Testing is the problem, with everyone scared they are all running to the hospital to find out... This is only going to make it worse. 

Also, I have family in China who were in Wuhan and made it out just before the lock down...  They were still planning a family get together this week in Chundu... Told my wife she was to cancel her trip back to see the family in China in a few weeks and tell her parents not to go to the family gathering this week. The best advice they can tell people is stay home, do not go anywhere non-critical.

worldnews,ffibdp4,t3_etrvku,1579969834.0,"There was an initial R0 of 3.8 which was lowered yesterday to 2.5... studies show the R0 to be somewhere between 4 and 2...

Basically [here is an explanation of the R0 system](https://www.healthline.com/health/r-nought-reproduction-number)

To understand what an R0 of 3.8 would mean  [a Harvard trained epidemiologist explained the consequences on Twitter.](https://mobile.twitter.com/drericding/status/1220950012059881474) 


In his words...

>HOLY MOTHER OF GOD - the new coronavirus is a 3.8!!! How bad is that reproductive R0 value? It is thermonuclear pandemic level bad - never seen an actual virality coefficient outside of Twitter in my entire career. Iím not exaggerating... We estimate the basic reproduction number of the infection (R_0) to be 3.8 (95% confidence interval, 3.6-4.0), indicating that 72-75% of transmissions must be prevented by control measures for infections to stop increasing... We estimate that only 5.1% (95%CI, 4.8-5.5) of infections in Wuhan are identified, and by 21 January a total of 11,341 people (prediction interval, 9,217-14,245) had been infected in Wuhan since the start of the year. Should the epidemic continue unabated in Wuhan.... we predict the epidemic in Wuhan will be substantially larger by 4 February (191,529 infections; prediction interval, 132,751-273,649), infection will be established in other Chinese cities, and importations to other countries will be more frequent. Our model suggests that.. critically dependent on the assumptions underpinning our model, and the timing and reporting of confirmed cases, and there is considerable uncertainty associated with the outbreak at this early stage. With these caveats in mind, our work suggests that...a basic reproductive number for this 2019-nCoV outbreak is higher compared to other emergent coronaviruses, suggesting that containment or control of this pathogen may be substantially more difficult.î!!!!cannot be stopped by containment alone. A 99% quarantine lockdown containment of Wuhan will not even reduce the epidemicís spread by even 1/3rd in the next 2 weeks. Thus, I really hate to be the epidemiologist who has to admit this, but we are potentially faced with...possibly an unchecked pandemic that the world has not seen since the 1918 Spanish Influenza. Letís hope it doesnít reach that level but we now live in the modern world with faster travel Than 1918. Who and CDCgov needs to declare public health emergency ASAP!
 
[>REFERENCE for the R0 attack rate (reproductive coefficient) of 3.8 and the 99% containment models come from this paper:](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.01.23.20018549v1)

 Also [here is the tracking map  made by John Hopkins](https://gisanddata.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6)

 With the jump of reported cases in the last few days the tracking of this virus is looking more and more like it is following this exponential curve of an R0 of 2.5... it will take about another week to nail this down but the biggest threat comes from the reported non symptomatic but infections cases. The numbers being reported now are past the non symptomatic point and are people who were in this phase a week or two ago. 

With the leader of China openly admitting that this is getting this bad... It is something the leaders of China have rarely done and is worse than we see in the Chinese press."

AdviceAnimals,ffgx65d,t3_etauhq,1579917332.0,"My employer solved this problem by taking away the 2 weeks of sick time and added 1 week to your vacation time and called it PTO. From there on out they just tell us when you are going to be out, no questions asked. So basically if you had 2 weeks vacation and 2 weeks sick (where most people started) it became 3 weeks PTO. 

What happened is we saw fewer people calling out sick and people just saving up their PTO time for vacations. In rare cases people had real health issues and the company instituted a plan where people who were maxing out their PTO (360 hrs) could donate it to other employees... And they did, a lot.

gaming,fesvj00,t1_fernwg4,1579369443.0,"Ahh... Yes, good ole Google translate. Explains it all.

People talk about how tools like auto translate will change languages but don't get that there is a whole cultural world of slang, innuendo, subtext and idiom that any language carries. 

For instance I could say:
You are watching a stump waiting on a rabbit..or just that you are waiting on a rabbit...(ÂÆàÊ†™ÂæÖÂÖî¬†Sh«íu zh≈´ d√†i t√π.)

And of course you wouldn't know what the hell I was talking about... But anyone from China would. 

This idiom refers to a famous story about a peasant who happened to see a rabbit run head-first into a tree stump and die. From then on, the peasant expected to find other rabbits making the same deadly mistake, and so he continued to wait idly by the tree stump instead of going out and hunting, or making other efforts to feed himself.

The idiom is used to describe someone who waits in vain for luck or opportunity to befall him or her, rather than striving to make an effort or take the initiative.

Foodforthought,fdm5pp9,t3_em2b63,1578540434.0,"Where I disagree with this line is simple... 

Let's compare the author's capitalism to automobiles. Socialism would say that since the speed limit is at most 75mph no cars can be constructed that can go faster than 75mph. Capitalism says we can build cars to go as fast as they can go. So as a result people under capitalism drive like maniacs and kill people. So capitalism cars are bad and people who drive them are bad. 

This is the wrong lesson because it fails to point out that there are speed limits that, when violated beyond the flow of traffic can result in serious fines and even loss of driving privilege.

It is in this distinction that the capitalist world has failed. It is not that capitalism is bad it is that bad actors have not been regulated. For years the far right has strived to remove the speed limits and penalties for capitalism. The results of this are that those willing profit off the weak and vulnerable profit faster than those with morals... And given the rules of capitalism this means that those companies and those people become the strongest and most profitable. They are then allowed to consume their competition. In fact unfettered capitalism rewards the most viscous of these corporations. 

Now socialism has the same problem, only instead of corporations being the great evil, government takes on that role. Politicians profit off the people, one of the reasons people like Putin are some of the richest in the world.

Systems of government and systems of business need to have rules and regulations that define right and wrong. They need systems of checks and balances that say, ""Hey you cannot sacrifice safety for profitability! People come first before profit."" They need both safety nets and stop signs that when violated take away more than the profit that the violation of the rules gave them. Today those rules do not exist. But they should. 

The problem with socialism is that those making the laws are those who stand to profit. The problem with the current incarnation of capitalism is that those who stand to profit are stuffing money into the pockets of those making the laws. 

The solution to the problem of capitalism is to separate the money from the politicians... There is no solution for socialism. 

Whether this can ever happen at this point is to be seen, but some people are trying.

The solution to the problem becomes a blend... Some things should never be motivated by profit, education, healthcare, public utilities... These things should be human rights. You shouldn't be able to say, ""if you want to live, pay me as much as the market can bare."" There should be rules to say you can profit to a point and after that the better good is to provide for betterment of the people. 

Capitalism tries to do this but in many cases the far right has crippled the stop signs or made the fines so inconsequential that driving through them is less painful than a speed bump. 

Is the system broken, yes... But fixing it would not be that complicated.

Of course it could be worse, [it could be a Theocracy](https://v.redd.it/svefsu3v4r941)"
