needadvice,feol48q,t1_feni45j,1579301650.0,"Op stated that the boss refuses to sit down and talk with him. Talking on the phone won't go well either. It's not an ""oh, I'll just give up without trying."" situation. 

I've been in a fairly similar situation. Nothing I did was changing the stupid stuff that was happening. The supervisors didn't care. The boss had more important things to do. So, what do you do? You Let the boss find out the hard way that making everything difficult costs him. Boss may not care, but it's better than pretending that it's a good idea to stay and 'keep trying'.

To be honest, (I am trying to make a joke here btw) the nuclear option would be to scream at the boss and demand he get his act together. That option would probably end wonderfully"

cats,fenlayr,t1_fempgr7,1579287121.0,"We wanted her to die at home, on her own terms too. Whispers will probably leave her alpha tendencies at the bridge and let him be her friend. But just in case she doesn't, tell Max to bring his courage. 

As much as Whispers will always be my baby sister, it gets easier to just let them go once they say ""I'm ready"". I wish you enough strength to tell him everything you have ever felt about him. Tell him he is the best boy, and that an internet stranger knows a few lovely cat friends. Ones that even Whispers will recommend. 

I wish you luck"

cats,fem3w5e,t1_fem1wfy,1579238894.0,"For the past three or four years she gets an upper respiratory infection in the winter. This time she just isn't recovering. She kinda acted like she was about to pass away last year, but bounced back at the last moment. From what the vet said a few months ago, she has a hernia that pushes on her bladder. She was on medicine for that, until recently. Now that she is off the medicine, I'm sure the discomfort will come back. I should also add that she may be seeing a vet at a different clinic in a few days, if she makes it that long. Thank you for asking"

cats,fem1i12,t1_felyk1m,1579236709.0,I think the main reason I call her my ginger queen is because of the ginger crown that wraps around her forehead. Her W is still one of my favorite markings. Those dang tabbies and their W's. It makes her crown stand out. Thank you
