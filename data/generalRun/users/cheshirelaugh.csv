A snippet from my daycare provider newsletter this past November.

>Almost 3 years ago now the Child Development Division made some major changes to the state regulations regarding multiple areas but the area that I want to address right now is surrounding staff qualifications.  They changed the regulation to no longer allow the CDA or Child Development Associates a Nationally recognized certificate count for teachers to be considered a head teacher.  What this meant was that teachers that were working on Friday as a head teacher would come back Monday no longer qualified for their same position. Teachers were given the option to go back to school and get qualified over a certain period of time. At that time I had three amazing teachers that have taught for me between 3 and 7 years leave the program because in their minds if they had to go back to school to do the same position they were in it made sense for them to go back to school and enter a profession that allowed them to make more money. This made sense to me and many centers faced the issue of how they would pay teachers more money for doing the same job because now they were incurring additional expenses and having to do much more work to become requalified.  Child Care Centers across the state were facing a staffing crisis and having to close classrooms or their centers entirely."

Once I started using Privacy.com's single-use pre-loaded-value CC numbers I've not had a card compromised in 3 years.

edit:  And I'll admit I was defending them when people first started complaining.  It's easy and not uncommon to oclone a credit card number.  But Once is a coincidence but twice is a the beginnings of a trend, I wasn't going to give them a third chance.  Thankfully I only use credit cards for online purchases so I've never been left holding the bag for fradulent charges.
