wholesomememes,ffim30p,t1_ffik6oe,1579977136.0,"Your points dont disagree with mine. Sure, you dont need to watch a movie in class, but do you need to see every calc 2 lecture? And picking which things to focus on is a very important skill. Otherwise you will probably burn out, and have to cope with stress."
PrequelMemes,ffijidv,t3_etrbl1,1579975361.0,James Harrison is a hall of fame level linebacker who recently retired from the Pittsburgh Steelers.
wholesomememes,ffigza7,t1_ffigimb,1579973642.0,"Because physics isnt important to English majors, and philosophy isnt important to a civil engineering major. The point is that you know what you need and what you dont, and that wasting your time and effort on stuff you dont need is stupid. And you are saying that choosing what to put effort into will create a lazy and useless professional. You are wrong."
wholesomememes,ffi581l,t1_ffi25an,1579965409.0,"This isnt a hard concept, pay attention to new material, and anything pertinent to your major, but many classes simply arent and are just required, and dedicating your time to paying attention in those classes is a waste."
MURICA,ffgevt1,t1_fffzvsg,1579904682.0,"And why should people who have never left their town get disproportionate voting power? People in cities are better educated and, barring major agricultural players (which are few in number and a minority even among rural voters) are the most important people in this country."
MURICA,ffgckjp,t1_ffg149h,1579903237.0,"Real thoughtful rebuttal. America number one, right?"
MURICA,ffgca1q,t1_ffg2uch,1579903060.0,"Well, the nationalist rhetoric is extremely damaging, he is burning bridges with many established allies, the economy is only good for the wealthy with wages being entirely stagnant. His policy hurts the working class, immigrants, and most anybody who isnt a white man. This doesn't even consider his criminal acts, where he has apparently held funds over Ukraine in exchange for dirt on a political rival. So, that is the short version of why orange man is in fact bad."
MURICA,fffvz7i,t1_ffeyyue,1579893000.0,"We should though. Fuck your nationalist agenda, we are a part of the world, we need to cooperate. We are a laughingstock to educated people in the rest of the developed world, and I would really like it if we weren't."
MURICA,fffvpxx,t1_fff3s32,1579892838.0,There's no issue with violent protests either tbh.
MURICA,fffvghz,t1_ffevg42,1579892672.0,"Ok, but the electoral college gives voting power to land. That just seems weird to me honestly. We are all americans, why not have the same value when voting?"
MURICA,fffvbuv,t1_ffeep2z,1579892590.0,"To be fair, orange man fucking bad, but yeah he did show support for HK. I just wish we were the america Hong Kong thinks we are. We are just China lite."
nba,ffe89kx,t1_ffe7bui,1579839401.0,"There's a difference between being a poor shooter, and literally not attempting 3 point shots.  Simmons is a post up player that has amazing passing ability."
nba,ffe3y8e,t1_ffdwhrr,1579836068.0,"I mean, calling him a guard is quite generous, but yeah he runs the point. Imo you have to have a jump shot to be considered a guard. Hes a point forward."

ToiletPaperUSA,ffan1v4,t1_ffaiyau,1579739798.0,"Nah shes a fair bit better, policy wise. Her voting record is suspect, yes, and doesn't hold a candle to Sanders, but to call her the same as Biden is massively incorrect."

DemocraticSocialism,ffafrv8,t1_ffa7mvk,1579734715.0,"2016. Bernie was running then too. Look, you wont find radical and violent change at the voting booth. But you will find progressive steps and a better environment for radical change to be made. Vote for the best candidate, or someone worse will win."

LateStageCapitalism,ff9xesz,t1_ff9pqqe,1579723590.0,Maybe we oughta quit placing people in poverty because they picked a skill the free market decided wasnt worthy. Also 30k a year is rent in many major cities.

nottheonion,ff6v7ym,t1_ff5xyq8,1579635569.0,"Your entire argument is a strawman. The vast majority of people get a ""useful"" degree, and imo more people should go into the arts if that's what they are passionate about."
nottheonion,ff5tked,t1_ff5t7n0,1579609724.0,"You see, patriotic Americans should be more than willing to shell out tax dollars to make our nation more educated, because that shit improves any and every facet of your nation. We can pay for endless wars, but we can't make real improvements for our people? I dont get why we shouldn't help ourselves with our money."

AmItheAsshole,ff5ihn2,t1_ff5ieyo,1579594407.0,"No, this is shit where you discuss what went wrong and rectify it. Not everyone is flawless, and you have to make relationships work sometimes."
AmItheAsshole,ff5gcmt,t1_ff5d7tr,1579591657.0,Especially considering she put bride in quotes in the title
AmItheAsshole,ff5f0ya,t1_ff5evgv,1579590050.0,"Yeah but there are things you do with gifts, and selling them isnt it. She is allowed to do this, but she is an asshole for doing so. Not everything needs to be spelled out. When several different family members hand stuff down, you are expected to do the same, once you dont need them anymore. That is how this works."
AmItheAsshole,ff5eo9l,t1_ff4lds0,1579589646.0,"But, they were given all these clothes. Usually things are handed down more than once, you use them, then you keep them in the family because they are so expensive. This lady decided the buck was gonna stop there and that she deserved the spoils. OP is TA"
AmItheAsshole,ff5d2ja,t1_ff4dzv1,1579587870.0,"Are you fucking kidding? You dont divorce someone over shit like this. You make it clear that it's an issue, and you work through it. I swear people here are way too quick to say ""end it""."
dankmemes,ff59fch,t1_ff58nsz,1579584224.0,"Now this begs the question, do the Simpsons predictions come true, just because the Simpsons predicted it? We may never know."
GamersRiseUp,ff54h6n,t1_ff52gn9,1579579976.0,But neither works in a post-scarcity world. We dont need capitalism anymore. We can make the lives of millions better by nationalizing a few key industries. Why not?
