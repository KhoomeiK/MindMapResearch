facepalm,fei8iv5,t1_fei7ziy,1579132658.0,"Have some humility - you can’t have an accident like this and still think you belong on the road. 

I’ve had so many close calls from people like you who nearly crash into my motorcycle, run me off the road, and run me out of my lane by merging into me without looking. 

If you crash into a pole that’s right in front of you, you don’t deserve a drivers license; you’re going to kill someone one day; and when you do you gong to say what they all say - “I didn’t see him or her!”. 

Get off the road."
