OldSchoolCool,ff1gjmn,t1_ff18d58,1579478881.0,"This is by far the most common grammar mistake I see educated people make. I see it all the time on here, hear it in songs, and even see it in published works and news sites sometimes.

The problem is that whether to use I, me, or my depends on the grammatical case. Since English has almost entirely abandoned cases, this is a hard concept for English speakers to grasp. People seem to think it should always be “(other person) and I” after getting corrected once in elementary school. The easiest way to figure out the correct usage is to remove the other person and see if it still sounds right. 

People will argue until they’re blue in the face so they can keep saying this wrong for some reason. It’s to the point where they say crazy shit like “my wife and I’s” instead of my and my wife’s. I’ve also seen people use “myself” when it should be “me”. A lot. You’re the only one on earth who can do anything to, with, or about yourself."

news,fdlz329,t1_fdkfa3s,1578535927.0,"I once read a timeline of the Lockerbie bombing crash and they hypothesized that many passengers would have been rendered unconscious from collapsed lungs and/or lack of oxygen once the cabin rapidly depressurized after the explosion. Still some were found to have survived until they hit the ground. 

Either way, in this case the passengers died a painful, terrifying death as well. That’s the reality of it and we should feel the weight of this incident in honor of those who died. 

This crash was collateral damage from political stunts and saber rattling. Maybe trump and khamanei knew it was all for show, but the rank and file guys in Iran’s SAM air defense units weren’t in on it and were no doubt scared shitless when they saw this delayed plane on the radar. They were likely on the highest alert and did what they thought they had to do to defend their country. I honestly feel bad for those guys, too."
