You don't gotta wipe if you get infected - unless it's some kind of insano rootkit or ransomware, but those are *incredibly* rare unless you do something monumentally stupid. With nearly everything else, run Malwarebytes, make a snack, restart your computer when it's done.

I didn't get commission so I didn't mind - my customers trusted me - but I can totally understand why ""we can cure your cancer with herbs and naps"" might be more appealing to someone than ""we're going to hack off some bits and poison you for months and maybe you won't die as quickly.""

Not that I'm saying your stance is Orwellian or anything; I just think being a little mean is okay if you're not hurting anyone by it. It's fun, and I like free expression. Mockery serves a valuable social utility.   


I've changed views over time (long story, I was raised a Creationist) because I've seen ideas I once believed in widely mocked. While I definitely dug my heels in when attacked to my face, the widespread teasing did a lot to wake me the fuck up and realize there was probably something wrong with my preconceived notions.

Some of it's because the medical establishment has collectively abused the trust of the people who depend on it - often not intentionally, but enough to undermine its perceived credibility.

You don't have to completely seal the case if it has more air being pulled in through the filtered intakes than air being pushed out by the exhaust fan(s). This also doesn't require a bag that end users will open to insert peripherals and the like - most filters can just be easily slid out and cleaned off.

worldnews,ffru6mz,t1_ffrolvy,1580165912.0,"Yeah, most of what makes these diseases scary is them getting spread without us knowing. It's one reason why the ""Spanish Flu"" (not actually Spanish, but hey) was so deadly - troop movements and the draft and harsh conditions made it a lot more prevalent and difficult to treat.  


But these outbreaks never end up being the world-ending superviruses that people seem antsy about. Even seemingly world-ending plagues like the Black Death or Spanish Flu generally only become as bad as they did by truly horrendous mismanagement.  


It might get bad for the poor souls in rural China, or in extremely densely populated areas connected to affected rural populations. It probably won't be that bad for us. It's cold comfort but the media is taking an opportunity to make some money here - and it's not like it's unethical to tell people to be wary of disease."

Like, they're all *bad* \- the flu is bad - but they're not the zombie apocalypse world-ending viruses of fiction.   


Honestly, this disease - and most real world plagues in history - only achieve such high infection and fatality rates from really, really incompetent management of the disease. In rural China, that's a real issue, and it's increasing the radius of the virus and making it a global issue as well.   


But we're not rural China - we aren't a massive, dense population with many uneducated people spreading the disease via unsanitary meat markets, while ignorant of its incubation period and symptoms. We're not shutting down public discourse about the outbreak. Our medical infrastructure - flawed as it is - isn't already massively overstressed as a matter of course. China isn't a *worst-*case scenario, but they're a lot worse off than we are in terms of managing an outbreak."

1. Be sure your PSU is switched on (Power switch on the back) and set to the correct voltage for your region (Small recessed switch on the back, US is 110 or 120 V)
2. Be sure your case's wiring harness (i.e., the wires from the buttons at the front) are correctly connected to the motherboard's input headers (check your motherboard's manual for a diagram). These should work even without the case - you can literally short the power headers with a screwdriver and this should work. I recommend giving this a shot, just so you can be sure it's not your case that's the problem.
3. Make sure all the motherboard's power headers are attached to the PSU - 8 and 4 pin especially.
4. Be sure your PSU's power cables are attached to the GPU, if applicable (It probably is, basically any modern GPU needs extra power). 

If none of this works, try unplugging components to narrow down what's going wrong. For example, try seeing if it'll turn on without the GPU installed. Make sure your motherboard is seated correctly in the case - double-check its manual and possibly your case's so you can be sure you have the mounting points set correctly. You can also try reseating the CPU.
