YouShouldKnow,ffbj4mn,t1_ffam47z,1579767717.0,The leg press also moves the weight at a 45 degree angle so you've got to half the weight before you even think about it.
IdleMinerTycoon,fetl9df,t1_fete7jn,1579376507.0,"Absolutely agree. My old phone used to take a few minutes to load this game and each location change. Removed all the managers doing ""0.01%"" and cut the loading time in half."

MarioMaker,fecmzm0,t1_feblwks,1578977955.0,"Just to clarify, dev exits are not good level design and should never be used to make a level that is too hard for the creator to beat legitimately.

An exception to this is when creating well designed co-op levels, where the 'dev exit' is really just a single player exit, not a hidden one."
IdleMinerTycoon,fecfvwm,t1_fecfe53,1578972934.0,"That means that the base income of the mine is multiplied by 5.9. So if you prestige again your income will increase by approximately 5 times. However obviously you will be starting at mineshaft level 1 and have to wait for barriers etc. 

It is best to save up some income, perhaps a day or two, before you prestige so you can quickly get your elevator and warehouse and mineshaft back up to the level they were before prestige. Except now the will be transporting 5 times as much cash. Just be careful not to max out elevator and have no money left for warehouse or vice versa."
IdleMinerTycoon,fecf4lr,t3_eof0j3,1578972427.0,"Spending 200ac to upgrade your Coal mine might increase your idle income from 10ab to 15ab per second. But spending 200ac in your Ruby mine may increase your idle income from 10ab to 50ab because the multiplier is much higher for Ruby.
It all depends on what research you have and how many times you have prestiged.

Knowing that eventually the Ruby mine will have the highest multiplier I would recommend only prestiging Ruby on the first continent. However I don't recall how slow progress was at the start so you may have to look at the multipliers and work out what is the most rewarding option."
IdleMinerTycoon,fdl1hqp,t1_fdkzm7o,1578515410.0,Thanks. It seems like Blingsley would be a better boost for my Ruby mine which I only collect from every day or so to go up 1 level at a time.

IdleMinerTycoon,fdivc5k,t3_ellpzs,1578451862.0,"I also find this counter-intuitive and constantly upgrade the wrong thing.

In the mainland mines I like to upgrade the warehouse by 50, then the elevator by 50, and then go to my lowest mineshaft and upgrade that. It requires me to move right and the left 2 times which I find annoying."
