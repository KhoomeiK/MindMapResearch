I ask because, while I’m a lot younger than you (32), I spent an inordinate amount of time in my 20s chasing some really unsustainable dreams. I wanted to be a video game journalist, and then I also wanted to work in the games industry itself as a writer.

I managed to do both, but I still wasn’t happy. Because while I enjoyed being able to say “I do these interesting things” and act like a special person because of that, the actual work was pretty hellish at times. Long hours. Low pay. Not even the illusion of job security. 

I spent so much effort trying to maintain those careers that I completely ignored how unhappy they made me. (Seriously folks, the modern games industry is a nightmare.)

I work a more boring job now and my writing goals are less ambitious than they used to be. I’m writing a children’s book, but I’m doing it to read to my children. I’m writing a novel, but I’m not expecting any major success from it.

All I really want is to tell a good story and have people read it. If I wind up getting a book deal, awesome. If not? I’ll self publish. Or maybe even just release it for free. Whatever gets it out there into the world.

You’ve said in comments that you have something like 10 novels written and ready to go? Why are you just sitting on those? If you wrote them and believe in them, publish them yourself. It’s easier than ever and the stigma for that is going away. 

And why is it going away? Because, in part, people are beginning to recognize that most people, no matter how good they are or how hard they work, won’t get book deals. Publishers only have so much money to spend and they skip over great books all the time. 

You really have to ask yourself if you actually care about being a writer, or just the idealized dream you’ve cooked up of what it should be? Dreams, even when they come true, aren’t always what they’re cracked up to be. Reality, on the other hand, always has the potential to be happier than we’re currently allowing it to be."

That being said, I would do as some suggested and A) continue therapy to sort out your feelings on this B) give your body more time to recover and get back to normal. My wife lost most of her baby weight really fast, but it still took her time to get back to where she was before. 

One other thing I would caution, and why I think continued discussion with your therapist would be valuable. Your body is going to change. It doesn’t matter if you have a baby or not or get plastic surgery or not. Time will have its affects and you’re still, someday, going to look at yourself in the mirror and not see the person you picture yourself as. 

I’m a man, and so my experience can’t be equivalent to yours, but I also used to be really naturally thin. I got used to that. Then one day, I started to get bigger. Some of that was from laziness (I’ve gotten better about that), but some of it was just me filling out a bit more.

I didn’t like it. I still don’t sometimes. But I’ve come to accept (for the most part), that there’s only so much I can do about it. I’m getting older and I’m never going to look how I did when I was 20.

I’ve sometimes been very self deprecating about that. My wife had to pull me aside one day and tell me to cut it out. “You’re teaching the kids that their bodies are something to be criticized.”

I want you to consider where we a thousand years ago. People were lucky to live to 30. Most went to bed hungry and even the smallest of wounds had the potential to become fatal thanks to infection. Plagued routinely wiped out entire populations of people. 

And yet we adapted and grew and conquered that world. The new world coming toward us might be a shittier one, and it might be of our own making, but we have already have all the tools we need to conquer it too. All that’s missing is the will. And the worse things get, the more quickly people will find it.

Should it take all that for people and governments to do the right thing? No, of course not. But we’ll get there. 

I say all this because fatalistic talk does nothing. Despair is useless. At its worst, it just gives the apathetic and uncaring an excuse to roll their eyes and continue not giving a shit. “Look at those fear mongers and doom and gloom.”

The Holdo maneuver in Last Jedi was breathtaking in theaters. As was Kylo killing Snoke and teaming up with Rey. As was Luke and Kylo’s confrontation. Movie was a mess and points but it had a lot of genuinely excellent moments. 

I’d also put the watery lightsaber battle between Kylo and Rey in there too. As well as Ben’s conversation with memory-Han and his turn to the light. That movie was a terrible mess, but that entire section was excellent and Adam Driver acted the hell out of it. 

I will say this, though. Attack of the Clones is actually a much better movie than people give credit for. I rewatched it recently in the run-up to Rise, and I actually had a really good time with it. Anakin and Padme’s “relationship” is super awkward and unconvincing, but the other half of the movie following Obi-Wan and his investigation is really great.

We get some party supplies, everyone gets to pick their favorite take out, and then the kids get to stay up a little later than usual.

We don’t deceive our kids because we want to get wasted. We do it because they’re young and they’d A) struggle to make it to midnight B) be super tired and grumpy the next day. We still plan something to make the evening special for them and for our family.

You deceived your kid so you could get wasted. You shouldn’t even be getting wasted around you child AT ALL.

The basic idea I like is that a faction or Sith is stirring up trouble. A Jedi Master and their Palawan go to investigate. It’s a trap though!

The Padawan is pursued and in the ensuing battle they become trapped with a Sith-in-training in some underground cave system (or something). 

The two realize they’ll never escape alone and decide to set their differences aside to get out and survive. They succeed, bonding in the process, and the Sith allows the Padawan to leave and return home.

The Sith returns to their own camp and it’s revealed that they’ve decided to launch an attack on the local Jedi base to ensure their dominance of the region. They attack, the two friends on opposing sides inevitably fight each other, and come to the conclusion that they can’t be anything other than enemies.
