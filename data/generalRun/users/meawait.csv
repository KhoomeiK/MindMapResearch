Seattle,ff31gxn,t1_ff2dm3w,1579531163.0,Both times I went we heard about them- I know they change it for the audience that’s there. The comments were subtle but very frequent.
education,ff30y2l,t3_erdt9b,1579530743.0,My nephews go to catholic school and aren’t. Their family has some honest discussions about religion and it’s differences when the need arises. It’s not a big deal.

education,fet3edz,t1_feshdru,1579371426.0,I happen to know one of the Obama era ED people. First in her family to graduate college as I recall. Holds a doctorate after teaching for 20 years in education policy. Before coming to D.C. she worked with low income students in WA state to make college and hs graduation possible for them. She also was an ed professor (not mine) and I wished I had someone who rode me on equity and process like her when I was becoming a teacher.

SwingDancing,feicg48,t1_fehdp8e,1579135263.0,I honestly haven't been interested or impressed by many of the choreographed routines posted here lately. There's been a lot of sameness in choreography and music choices.
SwingDancing,fefkgn9,t3_eoodoz,1579058229.0,I actually enjoyed that and thought it was original.

I appreciate your care as a student."
running,fe43w59,t3_enrfr6,1578855572.0,"Look at the course map and pick an option: 1. It curves around so you could walk/ jog to 2-3 spots along the way and then get to the finish to cheer/ catch her. You can make 1 or more signs or make a fun tshirt. 2. Route is not able to be cut to cheer, look up if there are good places to stop or away from places other groups claim (giant cross fit gym- I'm talking to you- thanks for the human tunnel) Get to the finish to cheer. 

I like funny signs and power up signs.
Oh and thank you. I run most of my events alone and families like yours make me happy."
education,fe2wyu2,t3_enlq9l,1578843742.0,History major here. I would echo what others are suggesting of doing history and something else. I know a very successful business and history major who works at a museum on the business side. Comp. sci. Is also a good pairing.
EatCheapAndHealthy,fe0izot,t3_eni1us,1578814151.0,Chop up and freeze it all in one go. If you want to steam the beets you can then it makes super fast meals. You can also roast the garlic by wrapping heads in foil.

SwingDancing,fdaxaxx,t1_fd7ukjm,1578251481.0,I see they are targeted for dancers and made by dancers so I would hope they have dancers in mind. I just was calling out that they only have three reviews in 9 months.
running,fdawwb9,t3_ekebvq,1578251331.0,"I had a gym membership and ran for about a year and a half. It was a Y. I took advantage of the classes and pool as well as the equipment. I lived and worked within 15 minutes of the gym and was living in an area that wasn't great for outdoor running during my preferred AM hours so I did run at the Y inside and out (they had a workout group that ran outside on a route so more eyes and people around. I liked it a lot and felt in great physical form and had less injuries. I quit because I moved and  have other commitments (dog) now , if I could make it work I would."
education,fd5vwil,t3_ek3wqv,1578182157.0,Heck yes.
SwingDancing,fd5t5r4,t3_ejulbv,1578181216.0,"They look really cool. Is there any feedback if they are danceable in? I see three comments total on their website. If not perhaps ask at a social next time what brand shoes you like the look of are (or you may already know). 
For me I found a nice pair of flat ballerina slips and sewed in elastic  crisscrossing the top of my foot for my nicer shoes for quiet some time."

education,fczipbv,t3_ejp4na,1578102111.0,"Do you have an AA or community college near you. You have to show you can do it to admissions (admissions essay about how you came to the light wouldn’t hurt when it comes time). It’s going to be long and hard to dig yourself out but with focus and determination (and perhaps a guidance counselor) you might come out ok. 
My bigger question I want you to consider: why does the top tier matter to you now? Most really successful people I know did not go to Yale etc."
