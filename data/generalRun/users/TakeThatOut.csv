Just remember to wash your face after you rinse your conditioner on your hair. Some conditioner would end up there and leave our face some what slimy resulting to break out. If you’re on a budget, get an spf with moisturizer. At the end of the day, wash everything on your face before sleeping. At 23, a toner would do after you clean your face. Look at the product if there’s parabein. They said it’s cancer inducing. Also, look if your face is reacting badly with things with alcohol. If yes, try looking for alcohol free toner.
