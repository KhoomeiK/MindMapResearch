sydney,ff2nwpn,t3_er87kh,1579515508.0,You made my night.
aww,ff24seo,t3_eqmf31,1579493805.0,Hooray! You're the best!
veganarchism,ff01ig7,t1_feyr3ly,1579464164.0,Yep and thats exactly why this whole article and rallying against plant based products is silly and self defeating. The less meat that is eaten by non vegans the better
veganarchism,fey5psg,t1_fetvkok,1579441156.0,Nope
veganarchism,fey28q1,t1_fewl1bs,1579439736.0,"I do exactly the same and am well aware that some sort of horrible farming practice is probably affiliated somewhere but aside from starving to death, not buying the products directly tied goes far in terms of not supporting those industries - supply and demand right?

The majority of food companies are owned by like three parent companies or something? Not to mention all the animals that are killed to grow fruit and vegetables, nets, chemicals, shootings, traps... Think orangutans..... but we are all doing our best with our choices (both beyond burger and impossible have no palm oil... Unlike a vegan staple like nutalex).

 Maybe when you've had this diet for long enough you gently step off the high horse and try to make it as sustainable as possible while still living your beliefs."
veganarchism,fey142b,t1_fev7sen,1579439414.0,"That is exactly the point. Firstly I don't think these companies are trying to cater for vegans - we are just not the centre of attention, surprise surprise. And secondly my whole point is that I am just pleased that there are options for people who are not like me, who make different food choices then I do. They, like most people didn't choose to be vegan or even eat less meat when it was a lot harder to do so - 25 years ago - for whatever reasons, but maybe this will help them to do so now - that's all I care about. 

Secondly, the majority of food companies are owned by like three parent companies or something? So, yeah the place where you're getting your corn is also probably affiliated to a dairy farm in some way, not to mention all the animals that are killed to grow fruit and vegetables, nets, chemicals, shootings, traps,habitat destruction ... Think orangutans (both beyond burger and impossible have no palm oil... Unlike a vegan staple like nutalex by the way so the red list is not so simple actually) ..... but we are all doing our best with our choices.

We are each responsible for what we choose to eat and therefore I just don't understand why any of us would take out a vendetta against mainstream meat free choices for others and us.

Will I buy these products? Well, many of them aren't vegan in the way that I am eg. The whopper has mayonnaise, while vegan KFC not available in australia, so that cuts it down, but if there are choices out there with credentials that I am happy with... Hell yes! I have bought beyond burgers at the supermarket - wish they had less packaging... And would buy impossible burgers if they were available, they are great. Have also tried vegan pizza hut pizza and it was great after this many years to have such a treat. It's not a 'gateway' option, it's just a fun junk food option and after this long it's a delight instead of the bad old days when tofu was the only sometimes available treat... 

I don't usually have much to say about it, but this current take down of plant based products and mainstream options, especially if it's suing burger king and such, really annoys me and represents the stuffy, elitest, closed minded totatitarian and punishing vegan attitude that has arisen lately and works against the things I believe in anyway.

Less people eating meat/ more people from different backgrounds eating plant based = good.

Making it hard for this transition to happen/making people feel bad about choosing plant based =bad."
veganarchism,feukcro,t3_eqcp16,1579387319.0,"Vegan since the mid nineties, all I want is to watch things continue to improve in terms of vegan accessibility with the aim of more people eating less meat. And particularly people who would otherwise not even consider doing so, people from different socio-economic and cultural backgrounds. I think people who want to bring down mainstream efforts at vegan or at least meat free options have a very different motivation. Aim to make it easier for people who are not like you for goodness sake! Of course it's from the same industry, basically all our food is."

australia,fdsahgo,t1_fdq33wf,1578698109.0,On pointe! It's so different huh? Usually you can hear them squarking away in the trees. We know we lost a lot last week but I don't think we will know the state of things for quite a while.

australia,fdphqxe,t3_emlio6,1578628955.0,"These little creatures (not just bats) come every year grieving the loss of their family, and I say to them ""if you can just stick it out with me for a while, I'll release you and you can go back and live a wonderful life. Just trust me and I'll keep you safe and care for you the best I can, you will get there little one"". 

The last few years, and particularly this year, I can't make that promise. We probably lost near to 20% of the Sydney population of bats in that one day of heat last week, there is a drought, everything is on fire, they have lost much of their habitat also to development. Although i am grateful to care for them, and although all the bat wraps are a god sent, I ask myself, what's the point if we don't get real change? 

Once they are released, where will they live, what will they eat? 

I hope we all go to the protest this evening, and every other time. I know it's not perfect but it's better then not doing whatever we can and some. Please tell me if there are other ways to affect change as well. Beyond the warm and fuzzy. Yep I'm a massive downer, but it feels like we are loosing our chance here and my heart breaks looking at these guys, so had to say something."

sydney,fdmngum,t1_fdmi0p0,1578556783.0,Sure. But when? I'm just wary of thinking things are improving when they are not. I don't see any rain in nsw that is not on the coast (I also live on the coast where it rained a little the last few days).
sydney,fdmg4t0,t1_fdlsgxm,1578548763.0,"That's what I'm thinking. I'm dubious of a post that gives the impression that it is raining this much somewhere useful for droughts or fire. I don't think it is, I think this is misleading at a time when we need to keep it real"

sydney,fddk2d5,t1_fddd5ji,1578315344.0,"Thanks! This is my first Reddit post.

sydney,fddjkib,t1_fddhsop,1578314819.0,Great advice. Thanks! Will do something like that next time I got out.

australia,fdd749b,t1_fdd6drx,1578297749.0,"Thanks! Good advice! Am in the wildlife rescue group and would like to find injured guys to help, but unfortunately volunteer groups can't take people into burnt areas because it's too dangerous (branches falling), but the feeding groups are doing the unburnt surrounding areas. What I've been hearing is that it is pretty rare for them to be injured without being killed, just lots of starvation and dehydration :-( have a couple of baby bats in the bathroom right now that have been orphaned. There's a lot of orphans that can be helped, so, if anyone is not already but wants to join a group, I'm sure they would be so pleased."
sydney,fdd5fkj,t1_fagdppr,1578295593.0,"Devil's advocate. I'm backing this, and commend you for being brave in saying what you think... Even if it's not popular and not something I one hundred percent agree with. I was there and there was a lot of navel gazing, before you jump on me...I didn't notice indigenous  navel gazing, but having been to every protest in Sydney this last few months/year it is pretty frustrating to get time out of work to stand around and listen to someone tell you how upset they are/special they are/socialist left they are (or worse, have millions of people in the domain listening to your mates, not so good high school band...) I want to turn up and discuss what actions we can take, mobilise and organise. I want there to be protests where mainstream people feel they can access it without being harassed by socialist alliance people (yet I am a fan of socialism) hijacking climate action and pushing pamphlets. I get what you're saying, it's not why we are all there.

On a different note, in response to other responses.... I think it is dangerous to romanticise indigenous fire management. Fire stick farming was done to create grasslands (as in burn down the forest to make grasslands) so it is easier to hunt. That is ingeneous, but probably is a luxury of the small population of people that lived here before European invasion. It is a terrible approach in the context of our current population. Fire stick farming did change the landscape, moving further away from gondwanic rellics and closer to arid grasslands etc. Constantly reduction burning - as we do now, will work to further weaken remaining pockets of fire protective, wetter forests. Replacing them and encouraging pyrophytic plant communities like - grassland and sclerophyll all of which have oils and heavy fuel loads that encourage more fire, and more intense fire... A feedback loop of regular reduction burns/fire stick farming."

australia,fdd1pav,t1_fdd1awg,1578291290.0,"Ohhh that was good advice. Thanks! I put out about 10 water food spots but didn't always find cover (burnt). Strung fruit in the trees for the possums and cut some leaf tips and flowers as well - it was hard to get enough so fruit had to also do. Lucerne hay, clover mix, sweet potato, leafy greens, bird seed and nectarvorous mix. Does your guide say it could be better to put in unburnt areas near by because that's where the animals might have gone? There are emaciated kangaroos further down the valley where it's not burnt but deeply in drought, I've put some out down there too but outside other people's property, so they will probably be removed because they will attract unwanted wildlife. I'm not near Canberra, but will join your group now :-) thanks"
australia,fdd174u,t1_fdcksnt,1578290742.0,There will be more. There's also other ways if protests are your thing. You probably are already doing them...
sydney,fdd0w6u,t1_fagl8o6,1578290418.0,"Hold your horses..... I'm the friend you talked to while I was downstairs at the rally. We did talk about more focused ways of enacting change, but we also talked about the importance of numbers on the streets, the feeling of action for people in democracy, how rallies.... no matter how frustrating can be hubs for further action rather then opportunities for naval gazers to preach to the choir (as they currently can be), and how to make them more accessible to mainstream people rather then fringey groups who are bent on hijacking the highly valued 'good guy' narrative real-estate.

I should presume anyone's political opinion but I am presuming we all want better action around this stuff. I know there is one in Sydney, town hall at 5:30. There have been lots of protests, you've probably already been to many of them. Lots of different organisers.

Just put this up to give people a bit of positive amongst all the negative and try and tend to a little of our collective heart break.

I see there is an organisation FAUNA further north who are feeding animals that people can donate to if that works for them.

Otherwise see you at the protests on Friday.

P.s. sorry about the passive aggressive title. I wanted to put this photo up so that people who are stressed about the animals know that some thing is happening (there are quite a few of us that I know doing this). But when I first put it up I just got lots of complaints about rocks and sticks...."

I'm really sorry to hear that your home is under threat. Our fire fighters were amazing, they managed to save most houses around here, I'm hoping the same for you. We have a ginormous concrete water tank... It was completely evaporated, but hopefully your water buckets are still there.  Am thinking of you and wishing you well. 

I see there is an organisation FAUNA doing feeding further north which can be donated too if that's an option for anyone as well. Walking through our 100 acres of burnt, it's the occasional howl or wining noise and knowing that their suffering is not close to over that is terrifying. Not just fire, but deep drought, never seen such skinny and desperate animals here in my +30 years of growing up with this amazing property and we've had fires and drought before.

Our apathy is terrible, but is also a reflection of our hopelessness.
