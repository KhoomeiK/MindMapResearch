I thought just food was cut, I found myself sorely mistaken when my insurance renewal got rejected. 

To be considered not able-bodied, I'd need to have insurance so I can go to the doctor and get diagnosed. A diagnosis and 2 years of treatment I believe is what they want for mental conditions.

The main issue is I can't stand being around people, it makes me physically ill. I grow increasingly ill the longer I'm around people or the more people that are around me, if too many people are having too many conversations around me, I lose consciousness and collapse. It's embarrassing and horrifying.

First time I did it was in 7th grade science class before class started in that period where everyone is rowdy and loud.

Now, for something more positive. ""I only exist to help out the people that need me"", that's a purpose. Not is it just a purpose, it is a really good one.

Walmart whole wheat pasta $1 a box. Their veggies and beans 54 cents a can. Tomato sauce 29 cents a can. 

1/3rd a box of pasta, a can of veggies, a can of beans, a can of tomato sauce makes a giant pot of food I can eat throughout the day. 


54+54+29+33(.3 repeating)= $1.64(.3 repeating) is what I spend on food in a typical day. I also add in spices and sometimes use eggs instead of beans, but even then it isn't breaking 2 bucks."

We have very different perspectives of what is ""ridiculously cheap"", because $8 is an hour of work. I don't see the value of sitting in a movie theater as $8 even if I liked that kind of thing. If I was into it...to sit in a seat, $2 cover charge to get in(and you should be able to freely pick what movie(s) you watch once you get in), then you make your money on your overpriced concessions. That's what I think is fair, but I admittedly have a much different world view from most people it seems. 

Personally I wouldn't pay anything for that experience as I hate being surrounded by people, I hate sitting in seats other people sat in. $8 is what you'd have to pay me to sit and watch a movie in a theater."

In the entire span of human history not one person to date has proven to have psychic powers. So no one is just gonna pick up that shit ain't right in your head, you can't just leave little breadcrumbs and hope someone comes to be your hero. It just doesn't work like that. 

Eating the negative emotions and hiding it from everyone doesn't lead to good things, I would know I've done it for two decades and I'm a fucking mess because of it. Open up to people if you want people to know how you're feeling. If you alienate them, fuck them, they weren't worth having around in the first place.

Depression without a clear cause is probably a chemical imbalance, especially if it is frequent. That or (to armchair psychologist) you could have some deep psychological thing you're refusing to address and it is manifesting in depressive episodes.

Personally meds only made things worse for me, if they aren't working for you, you gotta express that to your doctor. If they aren't listening to your concerns or properly adjusting to your needs, find a new doctor.
