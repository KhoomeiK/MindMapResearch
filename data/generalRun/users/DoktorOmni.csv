climateskeptics,ffcav2y,t1_ffapklu,1579795456.0,"> Human history is a drop in the bucket compared to Earth's history, and recorded weather conditions and temperatures are a fraction of that.

Worse yet, human *lives* are a drop in the bucket compared to human History. If you go to the Internet it gets worse, ""old"" folks here usually are in their 40s and 50s, and millennials and Gen Zs don't even have a decadal historical perspective. Politicians and the media often use that skew to be particularly efficient at manipulating the youth.

Example: recently there was horrible flooding in my city and the mayor used the excuse that it was an ""once in a millennium"" rain. But I am (and he is) old enough to remember far worse flooding in the early 80s. Fortunately, in a rare example of the press going *against* climate scapegoating, the local newspapers quickly brought serious meteorologists and engineers that pointed that rains were far worse in the 80s and that the problem is in the drainage infrastructure of the city."

Não é à toa que naquele filme Contágio, que é considerado uma dramatização realista de dispersão de pestes, quando finalmente entendemos como o vírus apareceu foi por causa de um morcego que cagou na comida de um porco que no dia seguinte estava sendo servido num restaurante chinês para a mulher do começo do filme.

That worry is already very weak for countries where the energy matrix is mostly from renewables, like Norway (97% from renewables), Brazil (80%)  or even Canada (65%). I don't think that this has much impact on their capacity (or lack of it thereof) of sustaining war. Fuel is far more important, and that takes us to your next point:

> if it get fitted into ships or planes

For ships the impact would be about the same of (fission) nuclear powered ships (particularly carriers and submarines) that already exist. Their ""charges"" last over decades, essentially forever as far as war is concerned.

For planes I don't know... I know that nuclear planes were researched (but abandoned because of issues of weight versus radiation shielding) and they were intended for staying on air for years and such, much like carriers. So the issue would boil down to fusion reactors not producing so much radiation as fission ones, which right now doesn't look the case - AFAIR experimental fusion reactors produce *lots* of gamma rays and neutrons while in operation (though unlike fission reactors they don't leave waste)."
