aww,fdh5vbg,t1_fdh3gtl,1578416039.0,You need to look up the definition of adoption. You don’t get to choose your own definition of what you THINK that word means.
aww,fdh0t5d,t1_fdgz59n,1578412899.0,"Those are acceptable as well. Saying “adopt” isn’t whoring yourself out for karma/fb likes, if OP said they “rescued “ it then I would call BS. I adopted my dog even though I paid for him."
aww,fdgxzqk,t1_fdgxcvs,1578411088.0,"It’s still adoption. So you’re saying those dogs don’t need homes? It’s not their fault they were bred. At the end of the day, the dogs still need homes. If OP has the money to buy a pure bred then who cares, it’s his or her money and that puppy still needs a home."
aww,fdgxgr2,t3_el6imn,1578410724.0,"To everyone shitting on OP for their title:

Adopt means bringing it into your family as your own. Nothing wrong with their title. 

Maybe you guys should make your slogan, “Rescue, don’t shop” so you won’t confuse yourselves anymore. All rescues are adoptions, but not all adoptions are rescues. You cant claim a word for yourself, there can be no debate on what the word adopt means, OP adopted this puppy."
aww,fdgqld9,t1_fdgq9iz,1578405736.0,"Adoption isn’t the same as rescue. OP adopted a dog, but it wasn’t a rescue. I think you’re under the impression OP said he rescued a dog. 

If you legally get a dog that is unwanted by its owners, bought or not, it’s an adoption. All rescues are adoptions but not all adoptions are rescues."
aww,fdgncgz,t1_fdgl9bl,1578403042.0,"I feel like adoption is taking a dog from where it isn’t wanted. Whether you buy it or not, it’s still adoption. I think people are getting adoption and rescue mixed up. Not all adoptions are rescues. But all rescues are adoptions."
aww,fdgmqa7,t1_fdglg6f,1578402492.0,"No they adopted it. They just didn’t rescue it. I think you guys are confused. You pay money to adopt kids, same with dogs."
aww,fdgldiz,t1_fdgl04u,1578401223.0,"I’m good, It just annoys me that people like you like to shit on someone’s happiness of getting a new puppy. 

“But it’s not a rescue dogggg”. 

Well OP got the dog THEY wanted, HUN. Not everyone wants a rescue dog. Sure go browse your shelters first, but if you want a specific breed then get that breed if you don’t find one at the shelter. Don’t settle for a dog you’re not 100% committed to."
aww,fdgkw4j,t1_fdgkmlj,1578400754.0,"Most dogs do cost a lot of money if you take care of them properly. But yea “free” as opposed to buying a $1000 purebred.

Let’s be real, you know exactly what I meant."
aww,fdgkop5,t1_fdgk4xv,1578400544.0,"Then who cares? OP can spend their money however they want to get the dog they want. Get over yourself. Getting a rescue dog doesn’t make you any better than buying one. The bought dog still needs a home, just like the dog at the shelter."
aww,fdgk2ci,t1_fdgjz3y,1578399913.0,OP can buy whatever dog they want. It would be more unfair to the dog if he got one he really didn’t want just because it was a shelter dog.
aww,fdgk01f,t1_fdgjlhq,1578399847.0,Exactly. Plus some people have small kids and want a breed that is well tempered to grow up with their kids. You can just grab a random shelter dog that you know nothing about
aww,fdgjjep,t1_fdghxnu,1578399361.0,Why does this bother you so much?
aww,fdgjfp2,t3_el6imn,1578399254.0,"Dog worry about all of the “adopt don’t shop” nut jobs in this thread. They’re just mad their free pit bull mix isn’t as cute as your puppy. Get the dog you want, not the one people tell you to get. They’re a long term commitment."
aww,fdgja3b,t1_fdgdpsa,1578399083.0,"Well he/she sure as fuck didn’t give birth to it.... what else you gonna call it? Adopting kids costs a lot more than adopting a dog. Do parents say, I bought my son or I adopted my son?"
aww,fdgj4ii,t1_fdgfcgu,1578398914.0,Not everyone wants a free pit bull mix.
