Damnthatsinteresting,fbt82sr,t3_eeba5a,1577070864.0,"Every year my mother in law sets up her village and every week I move something subtly so she has to go looking for it when she notices it's gone. One year I made the monks humping the nuns behind the gas station. One week, I hid all the tires to the garage. My proudest was when out of an entire snow village of people there is only one black figurines. It's a mother with a little boy so I made her a black lives matters sign out of a lollipop stick and paper and put it in her hand. She then took her son, in ice skates and all,  to the police station to protest.  I been teaching my nephew to take over the job of messing with her village. Granted, it's done out of love. Beautiful set up you have going here."
