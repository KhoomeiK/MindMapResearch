and need a haircut which i usually get in chinatown too lol"
runefactory,ffm6pfd,t3_eu6srx,1580049429.0,"the way i play is

* 3 chickens, 3 cows, 1 monster of each element, bosses 

* start with planting 2 seeds of each type, 1 for harvest/shipping, 1 for using the scythe on to upgrade level

* upgrade your scythe when possible because the rusty one gives max lv3 seeds, the next one up to lv6, etc. ship a seed once it reaches level 3, 6, etc. so later the shop will sell them at that level and your process won't be lost/you won't have to start all over from lv1 if there's a storm. seeds you pick up in the dungeon will become that level also. i only start planting a lot once the seeds have been upgraded to at least lv3-5.

* starting from lv6 you may also need to use a greenifier to continue upgrading seed level

* plant as many apple/grape/orange/twinkle trees as possible (at least 1 square apart between the rows/columns or however you plan it, for easy picking). apparently the more fruits you pick up (especially apple) the higher level and stronger the field becomes through the game and can withstand typhoon/give better seed level/idk. twinkle trees give woods and items which if upgraded into your weapon will increase its range. this means that every day i have to visit the tree that gives random tree seeds.

* make wettable powder at the pharmacy to sprinkle on crops to prevent typhoon damage if a villager starts to talk about dark sky/strong wind or give hints that there's going to be one, you need to plant and stock up cherry grass and the blue bell looking flowers (forgot name) to make wettable powder when needed.

* till withered grass in soil if you reuse/harvest on the soil too much or used too many formula A/B/C (make a lot of them at the pharmacy and make use of them to speed up crop growth)

* upgrade the scythe/hoe in the forge with a magnifying glass to conveniently check the level/strength of the land plot and crop

* get fodder in the hidden right screen in the cave, no need to plant it. bring the fodder bin and put it at the save point in the cave so when you teleport back you can put the fodder in it immediately

* as for how many fields/barns to expand, just make it simple - if you run out of space then get a new one. no deadline/goal needed. sometimes upgrade an existing barn is cheaper then building a new one, check how much it costs. you may want to have the left/middle/right of a field to work on your own (not let a monster work on it) because it's reserved for upgrading seeds/making giant crop/harvesting a crop for the first time (monster's harvest don't count for quests) or whatever. you may also get a new entire field you don't plant on but let your monsters work there to gather woods/stones/herbs.

* lamp grass is the recipe for giantizer, so if you want to make a lot of giant crops (to tame bosses, etc.), start planting and stocking up lamp grass when you can afford to

* spinach is the fastest growing crop (2 days) if you want to spam it or get 1 crop to lv10 the quickest. you can also give 1 to vishnal every day as a gift."

There is a subset of users who create multiple accounts to self-refer and reuse coupons (in December there was coupon for $20 off, so imagine how much Skip lost).

elemental monsters: absorb elements, you can spam their magic while riding and raise your magic skills

typhoon monster (appears in a typhoon): heals itself, kinda OP

not monster, but forte will accompany you from the beginning of the game if you ask. she can heal.

raise villagers to lv3 hearts, you can then invite them to go with you: margaret, vishnal, arthur etc. heal you in combat. kiel throws you food (sometimes you can obtain expensive dishes this way if he throws it on the ground) and can heal you. another great thing about giving villagers gifts (1 love gift + 1 like gift + 1 neutral gift everyday if possible) is sometimes they gift you something back. forte/kiel can give you rare monster drops, arthur gives you formula B/C (accelerate crop growth), someone can give you a free giantizer to make giant crops so you can tame bosses (otherwise they're 12,000G at the shop)"
