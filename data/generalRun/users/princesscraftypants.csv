relationships,ff4p5e6,t3_erhaf3,1579569072.0,"I'm so sorry, OP, this sucks. Office dynamics like this are the worst.

I don't actually think it's a good idea, but part of me really wants you to dial the awkward up to 11 with them. After whoever is done calling out everyone's specific names to make it known they don't want it for you? Slide into the middle of the room and yell, ""Aaaaaaaaand houseofLEAVEPLEASE, amirite?"" \*eyebrows\* / \*finger guns\* -or- something like, ""Oh, but NOT me? Okay."" -or- go stand by the desk with your mug and when they all look at you and mention they weren't talking to you: ""I know."" \*siiiiiip\* - etc.

Seriously, though, I don't want you to feel like you can't be yourself, but I wonder if ""trying so hard"" might seem fake to them? Some people can't believe that there are genuinely nice people that make Christmas presents for people who hate them. I would agree with other posters that it's not worth it to continue to try to do nice things for your coworkers - they don't deserve it. 

And if you want to go for broke, I'd say fuck it on trying to pretend like you don't have history with the office manager. These people bullying you aren't nice people, why bother giving a fuck with their feelings anymore? The Karens are excluding you and OM is left - who else did they think you'd be able to interact with? There is a chance that realizing you're friends with the person they're trying to badmouth you to might piss them off more, or it might make them pause and rethink their strategy. But either way, you wouldn't be as alone in the office anymore.

Also, is there anywhere nearby that you can leave to during lunch? Taking that hour or half hour to yourself in the middle of the day might reset your mind to make it through the rest of the day easier. Can you wear headphones or one side of a headphone? If so you could start listening to music or podcasts."

A lot of app and device options being listed to help you guys plan together if she's up for learning the new systems (not sure her disability). ""I'll add it to the list"" will become the new mantra.

\+1 to everyone reminding you that just because someone is upset doesn't mean you did anything wrong. If she wants to sulk over a boundary, that's her decision.

I wanted to go more into detail when you say that your mom always says she's ready and then takes half an hour to actually be ready when you come to take her on errands. There are some things people can change and some things that will just always be part of who that person is. Depending on what it is, you have to decide how to (or if you want to) deal with it. Some people have said to leave if she isn't ready, and that's one option that is perfectly valid. I would also suggest, since it happens *every time* without fail, that you simply budget this into the new time ""blocks"" you set up for helping your mom during each week. If grocery shopping always takes an hour, set aside 1.5 hours, etc. Assume it will happen because it has always happened. Bring a book or expect to have to help her with her shoes, whatever.

Also +1 to all the suggestions about uber or lyft (or some states/areas have buses for differently abled persons (if you're in the US)). See if there are activities around town she might enjoy. Book club? Church group that puts together kits for the homeless? Pub quiz? Quilting classes? DnD??? Maybe just more hobbies or things to do at home - puzzles, baking, does she have good tv show access, etc."

relationships,fd7kiaf,t3_ek0hav,1578205914.0,"\+1 to all the other comments about grooming.

I want to caution you to handle this carefully with your son, though. I worry about a few things - (a) Mark trying to gain access to your son without your knowledge after the breakup, (b) your son trying to gain access to Mark without your knowledge after the breakup, (c) your son feeling like he did something wrong when you break up with Mark.

In regards to (c), be very careful how you describe the breakup to your son when you tell him. I don't want him to be ashamed of what happened (which seemed probably pretty cool and important from his side of things), or to feel in some way responsible for what happened - which was not his fault. I'd suggest saying that you realized that Mark wasn't right for you anymore and not going too much into the rest of it.

As for (a) and (b), I have to admit I don't really have any concrete solutions about how to handle any of that - but they are very likely scenarios that you should try to plan for. Staying with grandma when you're overnight at work might help, but I don't know if she wants the responsibility of trying to make sure the kid doesn't sneak out to a car waiting down the street.
