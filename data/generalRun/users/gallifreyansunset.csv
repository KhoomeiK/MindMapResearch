AmItheAsshole,ffj0c00,t3_etsada,1579987179.0,"NTA. Just for reference, my first child did not spend the night away from me until he was 2,5 and only because I was really sick and my mom offered to take him for the night so I could focus on recovering. Please note that he has NEVER spent a night at my in-laws house. You're the parent. It's about what you are comfortable with. Your child is not a commodity to be parcelled out or hogged. Your baby is a human being with needs. Those needs come first, then come yours, and then you can think about indulging your inlaws' wants. It's understandable that they are excited about the first grandbaby and want as much time as possible. Just don't feel bad about not being comfortable with giving them absolutely everything they ask for."

AmItheAsshole,ff26nbe,t3_er3m1l,1579495313.0,"NTA. Honestly, what your ex is doing seems to be bordering on child abuse. He's giving your son food that he doesn't eat or that makes him sick and refusing to budge.

The whole fiasco with the chocolate seems surreal. It almost seems like he saw the chocolate and gave himself the go ahead, figuring he can blame it on you.

Also, while you did undermine him by providing your son with a way to not starve for a week, in no universe would I call what he is doing parenting. It's all about him, which is why he's refusing to acknowledge that your son might have needs that are not being met."

worldnews,ff03li4,t3_eqzm5c,1579464790.0,"Eh.... technically, the premier resigned (and was assigned a new post made up just for him), and the rest of the govt followed sort of by default.

He's wanting to rewrite the Constitution a bit. In the stated objectives:

-- giving the parliament power to confirm federal ministers, premier

-- closing the loophole which allowed him to serve 4 terms instead of the prescribed two

-- preventing any citizen with a double citizenship or a permanent residency anywhere other than Russia from holding a high govt position

-- establish the supemacy of Russian construction over international law (w/in Russia I'm assuming)

-- allow the federal committee to remove judges from the high and supreme courts

-- define the powers of the so-called government committee so that it is no longer simply an advisory institution, but becomes part of the executive branch

There will also apparently be a referendum on the whole thing, but we know how those go. The only hope is that nobody shows up, which will make stuffing the ballot boxes marginally more difficult."
AmItheAsshole,fevit2y,t1_fevc5bd,1579397909.0,"Exactly this! This is such a betrayal. I am so, so angry on your behalf. Please understand that you didn't deprive him of witnessing the birth of his child. He did that himself by prioritising his mother's feelings over your and the baby's health, against your repeated protestations.

He wants to sulk and be a big baby about it? Fine. That is his choice. Just like betraying your trust when you were most vulnerable was his choice. Missing out on the prescious moment of his child's birth was his consequence. It's as simple as that. NTA. He's nobody to blame but himself. And if he really wants to, his mother, for pushing this after she was specifically, and I'm assuming multiple times, told no.

Edit: Wow! My first ever award! Thank you so much, kind stranger!"
