Just take out loans dude.

Anyway quit being silly. Nobody cares about your cc gpa. Transfer in to an actual institution and then hold that 4.0 for 1-2 years and we will be impressed. Even one year of research is fine. You can transfer in your junior year, do research for one year, and then apply as a traditional applicant. Boom. Also focus on volunteering until then.

I’ve seen many stories on here where people excel at cc and then struggle in university, and given how naive you are I suspect the same, although I hope you do well.

Being picky with which medical schools you want is silly. It’s far too competitive a process for that. Especially as a freshman that mindset is really ignorant."

It’s one of those classes where you spend so much time wondering what the hell is going on and the exam averages are so low. It’s one of those classes where you get a good grade not because you understood the material well, just better than other people. Spare yourself. 

Just take 104. 208 has easily been the hardest class I’ve taken on campus so far but I had no electricity and magnetism or optics background coming into it.

Concepts are extremely difficult to grasp and you’re going to have a VERY hard time grasping the math if you don’t conceptually understand the content, which for me I HAD to read the book for since it isn’t explained very in depth in class other than long winded formula derivations."

You’re not a 500 kg deadlifter so don’t try and imitate what Eddie hall does. Those guys are experts and will do their own thing, ignore it.

You’re starting with your hips too low and they fly up. You notice how the bar didn’t budge until your hips went up?

You’re just leaking energy. Learn how to properly tension the bar and get a wedge in and you’ll get much stronger.

Don’t take 207/208 if you don’t have to. 208 is ridiculously hard. Nothing wrong with taking physics senior year either. But I’m pretty sure your major doesn’t require 207/208 so at that point you’re making your life unnecessarily hard.

premed,feg3h97,t3_eoxv99,1579075254.0,"Hey listen.

You can literally make ochem lab the last class you take. It’s barely going to teach you anything you need on the MCAT that isn’t already covered by the Kaplan ochem book last chapter and UWorld. 

For admissions all you have to do is take the prerequisites by *matriculation,* not application, so don’t stress."

But if med school is your goal and you KNOW you’re a slow learner and you’re deliberately taking a major that is hard... that’s silly. 

You should pick a major that you can enjoy AND excel in. Picking BME because you like it just to end up with a 3.4 or something is a horrible horrible idea.

Give it one or two semesters and then if it isn’t working switch to something easier. Your future med student self will thank you. If your GPA is pretty low like sub 3.5 and you’re insistent on applying only MD you’re almost going to have to do a post bacc or something to get your GPA up.

If okay with DO then that gives you a bit more wiggle room with GPA.

Anyway here’s why it’s bad if you’re still in highschool:

1. You’re not ready for college classes and the level of intensity needed ESPECIALLY for something like ochem

2. Bio is not easy. It’s a weed out class. So you’re taking two hard STEM classes as a freshman.

Just be careful man. I been on this sub for 3 years now and I’ve seen so many cocky freshman overestimate their abilities and the post about their GPA in the gutter. Most high schoolers are not ready for college exams. Some fix it after the first test. Some get their whole semester ruined."
