My wife and I live abroad and get flight reimbursements through work. We basically try to stretch them as much as possible. We fly to a location on a crap airline (no checked bags, tiny carry on, seats not together) and then explore it like crazy for a day or two. Then maybe we pick another flight closer to home, this one with a 17 hour layover and go explore a city in that time. We live out of a backpack, sleep in hostels about half the time, have no structured meal time, are regularly walking 10-15 miles a day. We fly into New York because it’s much cheaper and get on a 4-6 hour bus to get home to save 150 bucks. 

This is how I like to travel. Will I do this forever? No. But I’d like to do it until I’m at least 35 (currently 28). I cannot do this with kids. It isn’t fair to kids (or even most adults).

2 c sugar 
1/4-1/2 tsp salt 
2 tsp vanilla 
2/3 c powdered sugar
1/3 c corn starch 

Grease a glass or ceramic container for the marshmallows. 

Pour half a cup of cold water into bowl of stand mixer. Sprinkle gelatin over top. Let sit until VERY firm, about 10-15 min

At the same time, put the remaining water, sugar, salt and corn syrup into a bowl. Swirl a little bit. Bring to boil over medium heat , swirling. Let cook 6-8 min or until it hits 240(I never check the temp. 8 min always does it). Then, pour your mix into your gelatin as the stand mixer runs on low. Let it mix for 10-12 min, raising the speed to a medium after the initial pour. They should get big and fluffy. Add your vanilla at the very end, just mixing to combine. 

Pour your mix into your glass container. Combine powdered sugar and cornstarch and sift that on top. Let marshmallows sit overnight. The next day, grease your knife, cut, and toss in your powdered sugar mix"
