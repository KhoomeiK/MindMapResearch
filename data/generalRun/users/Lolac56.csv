baseball,ffm6xzu,t3_eu6kda,1580049606.0,"This past year was a very difficult time for me.  What kept me going was watching my Nationals go from 19-31 to a World Series championship.  Even when they were losing, just being at the ballpark brought me joy.  I felt like this was a gift just for me and I will cherish it for the rest of my life."

AskReddit,ffgawn1,t3_etcyd6,1579902222.0,"We need to stop treating men like they are complete morons.  I hate how men are portrayed in popular culture as complete idiots who can’t do anything right.  Most men I know are competent, reasonable human beings and we as a society need to appreciate that."

roadtrip,felvknh,t3_epje9v,1579232020.0,"My daughter and I did a road trip a couple of years ago.  We did not make any reservations in advance.  We just started driving and when we decided what town we were going to stop in, we used the Bring Fido app to search for pet friendly motels. (We had her dog with us).  We would look on the map to see what was ahead and decide how many hours driving we could handle that day.  We even stopped at random places we didn’t know existed.  It was seriously the most memorable trip I have had because we were under no time constraints.  
My deepest condolences on your loss.  I love the way you are honoring your husband.  
(P.S.  I have to say your username makes me sad because I am sure you are not any of those things)"
dogs,feka7i5,t3_epi99u,1579195822.0,"I have to ask:  What on earth were your parents thinking getting a puppy when they knew your dog does not play well with others?  This is on them.  Sadly, your dog is dangerous.  You will most likely have to put him down.  I had a friend who had a dangerous dog.  He bit other dogs a couple of times but “never humans” so they kept him....until he bit their 3 year old daughter in the hand, barely missing her face.  When they took the daughter to the ER, by law the dog was reported to animal control.  The dog was quarantined and eventually put down. It is a tragedy to have to do that, but the risk of human injury is not worth the risk."

dogs,fei0lxc,t3_ep5jpm,1579127692.0,"Dear friend, letting go of a beloved pet is the hardest thing in the world. It is also the most compassionate thing you can do for Emily.  She no longer has a good quality of life and she can’t express to you how much she is suffering.  She is trusting you to see.  I will be thinking of you even though you are a complete stranger because I have had to do this and I know how very hard it is.  Fly free over the Rainbow Bridge, Emily."

dogs,fdia1mg,t3_ele34n,1578438442.0,"This is not borderline abusive, this is full-on abuse and that poor dog needs to be rescued.  Record and document these things and show the police.  That poor fog is suffering and deserves a loving home."
