It's simply used to prove that it is very possible to have and advantage over women if you have been a man.

Eg. Having been a man would result in an individual having a larger bone structure.

Simply look at the size of mens hands, and the width of their shoulders, once you transition into a women your bone size doesn't decrease, you forever have that advantage.

Men are simply bigger than women, and that advantage doesn't go away with hormone blockers etc.

In professional sport, even a slight advantage eg. 10% advantage means the difference between first and last place"
