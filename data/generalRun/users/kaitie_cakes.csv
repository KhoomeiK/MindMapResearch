OccupationalTherapy,fgo1fg5,t3_ezl13i,1580957576.0,"A lot of jobs require you to input your license number on the application (or else it's an instant rejection, which can cause a delay up to 3 months if you want to apply for that company again). So just be aware of that!"
OccupationalTherapy,fgo0pvb,t3_eziw56,1580957119.0,"I worked at a neuro rehab for brain injury patients when I was younger. It was very IADL based. I made some really great connections with patients. The best part was you could basically do whatever you want, as long as you can justify it helping patients. This equated to doing anything from grocery shopping, cooking, cleaning, balancing checkbooks, learning medications, etc. I really enjoyed it. It's definitely a good rotation for you to have!"
OccupationalTherapy,fgkh3go,t3_eyxxoz,1580865417.0,"Not sure about in Australia, but in the US there are issues with liability, plus a huge influx of students, so a lot of places are unable to accommodate for ""shadowing"" anymore. Your best bet may be in outpatient settings (as patients are more independent), or look into becoming a rehab aide so you can get a feel for how the career is, while getting experience and making money."
OccupationalTherapy,fggz3su,t3_eyfsw5,1580772837.0,"There are definitely a lot of pre-fab off the shelf splints you can use, but if you have someone odd shaped or with special cases (two diagnoses), then you'll probably have to create one. 
The only way to get better is practice practice practice! If there are other OTs in the facility, you can ask them to help you out or give input until you start feeling more comfortable. My outpatient actually didn't do many splints, so it's more based on population. You can ask this at the job interview if you haven't already."
OccupationalTherapy,fgggfw6,t3_ey9obv,1580761352.0,"When I looked into travel therapy, they weren't really keen on you traveling around your home area, plus you aren't guaranteed to find a facility within your region. You will need an alternative address as your home address (i.e. your parents place), but make sure to talk to the recruiter about this as you can get your housing stipend voided if agencies think you're doing something fishy. You would also have to go to your parents place for x amount of weeks per year (can't remember how much) and all your taxes would come from that state since you'd be a ""resident"" of that state. It's been a while,  so I'm fuzzy on exact details, but there's definitely some legal and tax stuff with it to keep in mind."
OccupationalTherapy,fgekqg5,t1_fgeklc4,1580701904.0,"I'm in the US. I don't know about international accreditation, sorry!"
OccupationalTherapy,fgejirh,t1_fgehxak,1580701013.0,"I work inpatient and acute. The practitioner orders for my setting usually just say ""OT tx/ PT tx"" then you are free to make your own treatments. They don't say ""you have to do ther ex, ther act, and modality only with this patient"". We went to school to learn how to plan our treatment sessions per patient diagnosis"
OccupationalTherapy,fgebaq6,t3_exz02r,1580695647.0,"Definitely not frequently. And it's not mandatory. If I feel a patient would benefit from it then I'll include it, but you could forgo it if you want. You plan your own sessions"
OccupationalTherapy,fg8ew9i,t3_ewtuze,1580617457.0,"I'll just give a fair warning (and please understand this is not meant to be critical), but a lot of hospitals around my area, my hospital included, stopped accepting students from USA because they were so under prepared for their fieldwork that they became a liability. Plus it's extremely expensive. Not sure if you are applying only within your state or you've applied outside as well, but that's just some things to consider."
OccupationalTherapy,fg8emam,t3_ex6roj,1580617228.0,"See what equipment your facility has to offer also. Most places are moving to ""no lift"" facilities, because no matter how much you strengthen yourself, you still run risk of injury! Making sure your body mechanics are good is key. Same with using devices like sara-lifts or standers. You only have 1 back. Take care of it <3 (also, good excuse to get frequent massages)"
OccupationalTherapy,fg8eeya,t3_exb5fq,1580617057.0,"I applied for a job 1 week after graduation and got the call 2 days later that I got the job.

OccupationalTherapy,fg5lele,t3_ewzfw1,1580530706.0,"Standing wheelchairs have been in the United States for a while, but are pretty hard to get insurance coverage for (unfortunately). I wrote a letter of medical necessity for one before and it was an incredible hassle. I wish insurance companies would realize the great benefits this type of wheelchair has to offer."

OccupationalTherapy,fg3877l,t1_fg382mf,1580474044.0,"Ah, it was a while ago for me! TherapyEd is definitely harder than the NBCOT exam though, and I still stand by it as the best tool to study with :)"
OccupationalTherapy,fg37pns,t1_fg31ws7,1580473559.0,"Not sure I understand your question. The test is out of 600 points. Minimum passing is 450. My score was around 520's something, which would be like an 86% on an exam. Is that what you mean?"
OccupationalTherapy,fg23ew0,t3_ewcsa5,1580437316.0,I was hitting (if I remember correctly) around 50 points above passing on the TherapyEd practice tests. And I hit well over 120 points above passing on the actual exam! I only used TherapyEd to study.
OccupationalTherapy,fg231ow,t3_ewgzuy,1580437145.0,Talk to your CI and see what you should be improving. The take that info and practice writing notes at home. Your CI is there to help guide you!

OccupationalTherapy,ffyzuju,t3_evycw4,1580359534.0,I worked all through undergraduate and graduate school. My main two were rehab tech and cosmetologist. It really helped with cutting down cost of school each semester and limiting amount of loans required! Look into working at clothing stores or restaurants for more  flexibility with hours. Rehab Tech was great for hands on experience and getting foot in the door.
OccupationalTherapy,fftaag0,t3_ev16x3,1580214217.0,"Value your mental health. Especially since you're newer right now, you have the potential of pay increases at other jobs (yearly performance evaluations), which will allow you to jump back up to what you were making. If you're burnt out and can't give your patients your full ability, you are cheating yourself and your patient. Money isn't everything!"
OccupationalTherapy,ffs9ahs,t3_euw776,1580176281.0,"A lot of jobs I had applied for out of college wanted you to fill in your actual license number on the application before submitting it, just a heads up."

OccupationalTherapy,ffaf8ay,t3_esjfpd,1579734333.0,"Pedretti and TherapyEd had the same information, if I remember. TherapyEd was a great resource for studying and I used just that for my boards. Milestones were laid out in a chart and explained perfectly."
OccupationalTherapy,ff7fkm8,t1_ff7ccg8,1579648399.0,OTD is not necessary for supervisor or director position either.
OccupationalTherapy,fejfwdb,t3_epduj4,1579172285.0,"Your drive time and parking should not be factored into your salary negotiation. Since you are entry level, I wouldn't try to get too crazy on your negotiable price. Check out OTSalary to get an idea of what other entry level COTAs are making for your area and use that as your guide."
OccupationalTherapy,feidcen,t3_epatxk,1579135860.0,"A lot of jobs require you to input your license number in the application, so applying now wouldn't benefit you much on those particular applications. I know a girl that tried that and put ""to be determined"" or something for her license number, but all her applications got rejected and she had to wait another 90 days to apply with that same facility. I would wait until closer to graduation. That way you can even start talking to your fieldwork locations about coming in PRN as a way to get your foot in the door"
OccupationalTherapy,fegg5t9,t3_eov2ts,1579091659.0,"When I had initially graduated, I worked all PRN contract jobs. I have some friends who still do. It's possible! Just takes a good level of organization and follow up"

aww,fef1r8b,t1_feexyqt,1579046139.0,This happened to me. It scared me thinking that I would be resented as a parent if I adopted.
OccupationalTherapy,feey7pg,t3_eooyw6,1579043821.0,"I work for a few different hospitals and because of safety concerns, we no longer can have volunteers ""help"" with patients, nor do we let people shadow. But I suggest looking into a position as a rehab tech as this would get you direct patient experience, working side by side with therapists, give you an idea of their workday, plus get your foot in the door and give you some income at the same time!"
austinfood,fecbe7g,t3_eo9e8f,1578970102.0,"Oz taphouse is a little ways out (northwest, up by lake Travis). They don't have as many TVs, but they play the games and are usually not as crowded as other places so you can get better seats by the TVs. They have picnic style tables, plus longer high tops for bigger groups.
But the best thing is they are a self serve taproom, so you all can just get an RFID card and help yourselves to the beer, wine, cider, etc, plus order food off a tablet without having to wait for a server."

AskWomen,fdsnxst,t3_emxwr1,1578705686.0,"Can't believe kids are still doing this. When I was in middle school, we all had separate lunch tables that the different cliques would sit at. The football players would cue up and play this prank on the table of ""nerdy"" or ""weird"" girls (i.e. us girls that were in band, drama, or choir). I had some friends on the football team (pastors son that I grew up with) so I knew what prank they were playing. I witnessed them play this prank on a few girls in the middle of the busy lunch room then crack up laughing when the girl got excited or said yes. 
One day, I saw the guys gearing up for another one of these stupid pranks (they all would huddle close, whisper, and pick out their next victim). It happened to be my friends sister that was sitting across from me at lunch. The boy came strolling over, acting suave and cocky, and asked Megan ""so, you're pretty cute. Do you wanna go out sometime?"" I saw the rest of the football players hunched down, snickering, trying to contain their immature laughter. Megan looked shocked and was about to reply when I spoke up and said, ""Ew! Gross! You're so nasty, why would she ever go out with you? You're disgusting!"" The other girls around me caught on to what was happening and starting chiming in with their own chorus of ""gross"" and ""no way!"" 
The football player was so taken aback. He made his way back to the football player table where his buddies were roaring with laughter at HIM. Megan looked embarrassed, but was relieved. That stopped their game at lunch time and the next year were are all in high school, and I didn't see them attempting it anymore."
OccupationalTherapy,fdsc92b,t3_emxx3g,1578699300.0,"All the companies I've worked at (unless it was as PRN) specifically stated the liability insurance we received through working with the company, rather than having to search for your own. You sure your company isn't offering anything?"
OccupationalTherapy,fdsbz54,t3_emz2pt,1578699112.0,"The classes applied depend highly on the setting you are working in. For example: Ortho for acute care post op, neuropsych and psych for mental health, childhood development for peds, phys dis in inpatient, etc. You end up using a lot of the classes because having knowledge of it all makes us well rounded therapists. 
I have heard some others say that schools have given preferences to males upon admission standards, but my university assigned us all numbers so as not to bias by gender (or if a professor knew one of us from undergraduate) and we had to get in through merit only. 
Save the money and go for your masters. Doctoral degrees are only if you want to teach or or into the field of research (both which require you to work as an OT for a few years first regardless). Also you may run the risk of places not wanting to hire you initially out of school with a doctorate since it'll mean a higher pay for them and no extra experience on your end. Do a master's first then in a few years decide if doctorate is right for you."
OccupationalTherapy,fdsbex9,t3_emyjmf,1578698735.0,"This has been a frequently posted question on here. But as you'll find in other comments on here, just hang tight. This isn't the first time big changes have disrupted the medical field. Wait for things to swing back around after changes have been implemented. Also try looking into other cities or into non-traditional settings. I've already begun to see an uptick in the amount of jobs opening since last October. Just give it some time!"
OccupationalTherapy,fdragjo,t3_emt05e,1578681655.0,"You could look into working as a Rehab Tech as it doesn't require an special degree, but would still allow you to get into the field, get some experience, and offset costs of school. Plus it's a good way to get your foot in the door at facilities that would likely hire you once you graduate."
