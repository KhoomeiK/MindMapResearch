AskReddit,ffjcljj,t3_ett7fr,1579995455.0,"Intentionally having a kid with someone I had known for 6 months at best who, after removing my rose colored glasses, turned out to be a narcissistic BPD gaslighting physical and mental abuser who 5 years later is a completely absent mother who in no way contributes to the wellbeing or upbringing of her wonderful child. Jokes on her. I get to spend all my free time with a great kid. Bonding. Making memories. Love. She's missing out. She's the loser.

Worst (and somehow best?) mistake of my life. The thing is if this didn't happen I wouldn't be who I am right now. I don't know who or what I would be. Still using drugs and alcohol to excess? Dead? Jail? No telling."

rant,fek6x0t,t3_epj3s5,1579193871.0,"My ex works at a bar and would sometimes keep her oldest daughter (12) at the bar with her until all hours of the night so she wouldn't have to be home alone. I was wondering what was the lesser of two evils. Let the daughter stay home alone or keep her at the bar till past midnight on a school night? OR just let her live with her great-grandmother again where she'd be properly cared and provided for.

I was recently able to convince her to let her daughter move back in with her (my ex's) grandmother where she (daughter) was raised and had lived for years before her mother decided to take her away for a stupid reason.

She's a joke of a mother. No maternal instinct. Reaps tax benefits from having several children, yet none of the children live with her. She barely contributes to their wellbeing."
