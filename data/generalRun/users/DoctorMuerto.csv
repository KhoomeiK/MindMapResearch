todayilearned,fcfdmkl,t1_fcdsggi,1577628939.0,Spain literally built the capital of New Spain on top of Tenochtitlan. They then co-opted the eiltes into parts of of the colonial power sturcture. The Aztecs didn't go anywhere.
todayilearned,fcfckqf,t1_fcefd3y,1577628635.0,TIL that Romans didn't go extinct after the death of Jesus. There are still millions in Europe who have ancestral connections to the Roman Empire.
todayilearned,fcfahqz,t1_fcew50x,1577628047.0,"This distinction is really important in due to the history of European colonialism during which one way that Europeans justifiwd their supposed superiority was no mark the colonized as lacking some important trait of ""civilization"", such as a proper language. When Spanish amd Catalan could be claimed to be proper distinct languages belonging to distinct peoples, but K'iche and Tzotzil could be dismissed as simply dialects (despite the many differences in vocabulary, grammar, amd phonology) it was easier to claim that the speakers of the former had a duty to impose their civilization on the speakers of the latter pair. The continued denigration of Mayan languages as dialects feeds in to contemprary Guatemalans' racist structures, too. So we ask that you don't reproduce that linguistic error please."
