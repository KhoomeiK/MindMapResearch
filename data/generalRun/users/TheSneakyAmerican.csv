They also have a grandfather clause allowing the millions of “assault weapons” to remain in possession, even though they are supposedly *so* dangerous.

They are extremely expensive to make so destroying them for no reason makes no sense unless there is some benefit to it. Our military is several times more powerful because if you compare military spending among NATO members, you will find that our European friends are woefully unprepared to deal with Russia or China if a conflict should arise. The fact is, nobody knows the future. Just like Pearl Harbor and 9/11 came out of left field when they happened. The future of warfare as predicted by the US and NATO is a “hybrid” and “near-peer” War. The enemy would use conventional forces, but due to their weaker economy, they would augment their forces by using paramilitary and unconventional forces like the “little green men” in the Ukraine conflict. If we disappeared the US military tomorrow, China and Russia would make power grabs across the world instantly.

China is literally the only reason North Korea exists today. If 300,000 Chinese soldiers didn’t swarm the NATO forces and push them back to the 38th parallel. China prefers the US to be bogged down in conflicts, that’s how their military has dramatically modernized since the late 1990’s. No wars mean more money to build a stronger military.
