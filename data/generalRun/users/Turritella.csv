whatisthisthing,ffjws19,t1_ffjuey6,1580009086.0,"This seems like a very likely theory to me! One thing I've been wondering about is the curvature. A lot of people have suggested it's a car emblem, but when I googled those they all looked flat. Maybe that's not true though, and some are curved like this?

When I googled the car emblems, I also found out there was something similar for bikes... however, even though this is curved, the curvature is very slight. All the bike emblems looked much more curved. I tried laying this flush against different jars in my house, and whatever it was affixed to must have been larger than any bike part I've ever seen.

Sooo... I guess what I'm asking is, do we still think this is for a car even though it doesn't lay flat? If not, could there have been an exhibition race for bikes? Because the exhibition idea makes so much sense."

EntitledBitch,ffcqr1k,t3_esklt7,1579805285.0,"I live in the US and it's simply not true that all charging stations cost money. I've lived in two communities that provided free ones. My undergrad also offered free charging for electric vehicles (and had super high parking fees). Where I went for grad school, the parking fees were lower and charging your car wasn't free, but you had to buy an add-on to your parking pass that gave you unlimited charging access and the cost of charging was quite low. Lastly, I now live near a huge city where parking is very expensive. Big employers usually offer paid parking; i.e., you have the opportunity to buy a parking pass to a facility owned or subsidized by your employer. This costs a few hundred a year, fees and specifics vary, but it's much cheaper than buying parking on your own. Some of these have charging stations with the same commercial fees you'd see anywhere, some have highly subsidized and therefore cheap charging stations, and some include it for free.

What I'm trying to say is that pretty much every pricing structure exists somewhere, and it's not at all weird to have free charging in a situation where access to that parking requires being qualified (a student, employee, whatever) and paying for access."

Episiotomies, having experienced a bad tear before, and large babies all make it slightly more likely. It is also pretty common to get fissures around the anus from the general stretching and pressure of labor.

EntitledBitch,ff96kkf,t3_es258c,1579706039.0,"Ok, devil's advocate: I think people are reading into this. There's nothing strange about having life insurance on a former spouse. They have a child who will need lifelong care. Aging and trying to provide this care alone is outrageously difficult, and the financial needs are intense.

If she has a reasonable fear that her ex spouse will commit suicide, leaving her the sole parent, then she definitely would need additional money. She would need to pay for some in-home care and the odds of having to pay for residential care at some point are increased (to raise just two small issues).

Maybe people are reacting to the fact that she thinks he might kill himself if she gets 'everything she wants', but based on this post we have no idea what that is. It may be provisions that are extremely reasonable or even unavoidable (perhaps spousal support that continues indefinitely, rare but possible because of the disabled child, or having to shoulder the medical costs for that child). The truth is that dividing a household in two is difficult and it is totally possible for both people to be fair, for the court to be fair, and for one or both people to end up in financial hardship anyway. That's the case even without the disabled child.

Imagine a wife who is in that situation. She is pursuing what she needs to keep the family afloat. She knows it will be hard for both of them post divorce, perhaps extremely hard, and she knows her spouse has a history of suicide attempts. She fears what will happen if he kills himself. What is she supposed to do?"

With a skewer and a grill that also smokes you'd be hard pressed to hand me a veggie I couldn't grill to deliciousness. And if you don't think grilled fruit is good too, then up your cookout game.

fatlogic,fegsq29,t3_ep26oc,1579101660.0,"It always makes me feel a little sad to see people use this kind of reasoning to tell themselves their weight doesn't matter. It matters if it's hurting you!

Starting to see myself as a real, full person and not just as a fat person was really important for me when I started to lose weight. I would tell myself all the time ""I am not a fat person, I am a person who has fat on her body"". Obviously this is dumb wordplay but a lot of motivational self-talk is. I shed the weight (partly) because I felt like a person who was separate from it. If fat is something you just *have*, and it isn't you, then the core *you* is in control, you know?"
fatlogic,fefx539,t3_eoue6r,1579068111.0,"I'm going to be honest, I don't think this is fatlogic and I don't see any actual disconnect between what the poster said and what the linked article says.

The only issue, to me, is whether or not you consider ""starvation mode"" to be another name for adaptive thermogenesis. And, personally, I do. Hear me out: way back when I was 11 or 12 and dieting for the first time I heard a lot of confusing stuff about starvation mode, leading me to do many hours of reading on the internet. And what I eventually landed on was (a simplified, I'm sure) understanding of adaptive thermogenesis. I came to understand that if you're eating at a deficit, deepening that deficit will always speed weight loss, but the relationship between your deficit and your rate of loss is not linear. I (and other teenagers on my diet forums) thought of this as the ""real"" starvation mode, and we thought of the idea that you gain weight when a deficit is too deep as a simple misunderstanding of ""starvation mode"" which does not have it's own name.

There is no indication I can see *in the comment itself* that this person has misconceptions about calories or metabolism. That's all baggage that readers are bringing to their interpretation because of the phrase starvation mode. But this person may have the same history with that phrase that I do, and genuinely see the article as a clear explanation of their position. I hope that all made sense."

alexa,fdlul3k,t1_fdlsplm,1578532851.0,"No, I'm sorry for the confusion. I am using the Alexa app to play music through the dot. When I said ""from Google it looks like...""

I have a smart tv that directly supports Netflix, Hulu, and Amazon. I also have a firestick which is how the echo dot currently connects to the tv, and the Firestick supports my Netflix, Hulu, Amazon, and Disney +.

In the Alexa app I have found the tv/video settings and connected it to my Hulu, but selecting Firestick on the same screen doesn't do anything (it just tells me to talk to Alexa, which works fine through the dot but not the app). I hope this all makes sense, I'm extremely new to this.

trashy,fco9w5v,t1_fcmizfy,1577827082.0,"A lot of people who answered you gave great advice. I just have one little thing to add: occasionally, it just doesn't happen, and that's ok. Sex can still be fun and feel good and create intimacy even without an orgasm. Of course I want the man I'm with to care about my orgasm, and I love to have them, but I don't want to feel pressured or like a disappointment or a burden if it isn't gonna happen that day. Anything that creates tension around sex can make people shut down, and make an orgasm less likely (that day or next time). Especially if the woman already has any trouble with it. 

So I guess I'm saying follow the advice here, and keep caring about the satisfaction of your partners. But also embrace the other good things about sex and don't put too much pressure on the orgasm itself."
