This is Neil Gaiman's speech to graduating arts students from 2012, ""Make good art"".

i don't know, if this helps you any, but this video gave me back some of my enjoyment of creating art, even if i am at the point where it is coming back as a hobby for now.

it also helped me with some personal problems by changing my point of view a bit. 

worth a try :)"
AmItheAsshole,fe2bv64,t1_fdxo7mk,1578836684.0,"i see that i went a little overboard here.
but i really do not think that hurting her is the answer. as you said, it is the most important thing in her life right now. being denied that WITHOUT making her understand what she did wrong is only a cruel punishment where she most probably will not learn the lesson you want to teach her. her deeds need to have consequences. but she also needs to have a discussion with the adults around her about why what she did is not okay, and she need to learn from her mistakes. just grounding her not gonna make her a more understanding adult i believe.
but this is just my opinion."
AmItheAsshole,fdxh78h,t1_fdx4qlb,1578768682.0,"i am wholeheartedly standing behind the bullied girl.
but a lot of you are very very strict with a 17 year old. she needs to reflect on what she had done, but really. IF she is reflecting on her behaviour, and apologizing to her, and making it up some way, why should she not be able to go? aren't you putting a label on her that says bully, do not come back, and that she does not deserve human contact? people change. that is our most basic nature. be forgiving. you don't even know the full story, and you are condemning a 17 year old."
AmItheAsshole,fdwjl0j,t1_fdwgjzn,1578759395.0,"that is a good question. i don't really know, but it is.

i'm 32f, and i was at our equivalent of a prom, but i only danced in our class dance, and no one asked me to dance walzer. which meant i did not have the white dress everyone else had. i still feel vaguely left out. not a big thing, but stays with you. no party, dance, ball will ever give this missed one back to you.

somehow for a girl this expectation of a first ball seems to have seeped down from ages before. we hear the stories about the princesses going to their ball, and we all want to go there at least once. even the not really romantic looking teenaged girls want to be there. i promise you..."
CPTSD,fdwdxf8,t1_fdusqcv,1578757706.0,"try to imagine small you, and what would current you do for that small kid, to stop the suffering.

do that for yourself.

you are still that kid inside. be the loving adult in your own life, and hug that little kid. do something nice for yourself, something small. make a cup of tea or coffee, sit down and imagine doing this for that kid, for yourself, giving something small, but caring. have a nice shower. reread a book/rewatch a movie you really liked from a cocoon of cozy blankets. buy a bar of chocolate in the store if your eyes are caught by it. give random small acts of love to your inner kid by giving  to yourself. it gets harder sometimes, but if you make a small habit out of this, it helps with the emotional part of it later.

it is so much easier to love that innocent child inside, than the broken ourselves in the current time. 

and the trick is, that kid would love you back for the love and attention that you know you missed back then. and by being the one who gives love to that kid, you at least know that the small you inside loves you already for doing this for yourself.

keep on keeping on! you are strong, and the fact that huge stuff like this is surfacing, means that you are ready to face it. it is going to be hard. but by looking at problems clearly, you have a chance to actually step past them one day.

this is healing. it is painful. but it gets better. one small gesture at a time.

ps. i's recommend looking into therapy options, it really does help if you find someone you can trust. they have a point of view outside of your story, and the expertise to know how these things usually play out for human beings. but they are just there to help your journey, to guide you if you have questions, and verbally hold your hand when you are facing difficult memories. even with some questions, they can direct your focus on some details that can alter your perception about yourself.

big journey. worth it."
AmItheAsshole,fdwarpg,t3_emv42p,1578756808.0,"nta. you thought it through, carefully budgeted it, and made a decision.

if they want you to drive your brothers, they can buy the car, and put fuel in it. why would you be responsible for the cost of taking your siblings to school, as well as the labour of it? 

maybe ask them to pay for some of the gas and insurances if they want you to drive them around, and put together a fund from which you can buy your own before you go to college. this should be an affordable compromise to both?"
AmItheAsshole,fdw5pko,t3_en6jau,1578755353.0,"if she is willing to show remorse, i would go back on the prom. you dont want her to remember at 40 that she was the only one who couldnt go. but no party is fair.

you have not failed as a parent. this is the point where you still have the authority to teach her.

this seems like useful resource. engage her in conversation, and make her understand, that she will need to think and react to this. give her a book to read from the list:

i did not read through the lot, but it seems to be scaled by age brackets too.

(edit) now i did, and it is on the too young audience for your daughter. here is a more age appropriate looking list:

[https://www.readbrightly.com/10-honest-books-bullying-teenagers/](https://www.readbrightly.com/10-honest-books-bullying-teenagers/)(edit ends)

maybe put prom as an option if she is willing to work on this and discuss?

also consider that most bullies have problems themselves. they are trying to balance out their confidence by presenting bigger and badder than others. ask her if she has any problems that caused her to behave this way with her peer.

you will need patience with a temperamental teenager, who currently probably ""hates"" you for ""taking away her freedom/life"" (we have been all there, being a teenager equals being that dramatic). if she does not listen to you, try asking the grandparents who ""were on her side"" how would they present the case to her. i am pretty sure they would agree that it needs to be discussed even if they see your move as too harsh.

edit: typo, eidt2: added more age appropriate reading list"

CPTSD,fcq0wb4,t1_fcpagl5,1577876348.0,"i think this day is just the same as every other. yeah we completed a round around the sun. like yesterday. 31st last year. or the day before that compared to 30th. 

we can start anew everyday. obviously, that is not easy to do. everyone here has problems with this, that is why we are here, searching desperately for kindred spirits who have the same questions. is it worth it? when it hurts so much? and what i am so baffled about is how everyone can genuinely be happy for each other for the shared successes, and how caring all we are. 

we were hurt. we want to not hurt. we thrive to not hurt others.

and we slowly learn not to hurt ourselves.

i think new start is everyday. this new year shit is a consensus between weird little hairless monkeys that once a year we should celebrate that we survived one lap around the sun again.

i think what is really hard is to start the new me. again. and again. and again. but i see the subtle changes. i see how i worked on my communication, controlling my anxiety and horribly self-abusive thoughts. and i am going to start again tomorrow if today i fall back a couple of steps."

depression,fc8jq1f,t1_fc8gss3,1577536367.0,"hi there :)

I feel you... getting diagnosed sounds scary. I am 32, and has been struggling with depression, and anxiety on and off since... high school? and about a year ago, the add thing just clicked. yeah, i am one to talk, i still did not get officially diagnosed with it, but we talked about it with my previous therapist. I wanna get diagnosed when I am finally through with my schematic therapy next month (I have been trying to get into this therapy for half a year).

The thing is, it not only explains my weird focusing problems (hyperfocus, or completely ""oh, this is important, i am paying atten.... wow, a butterly!"") but the depression too, as my loneliness as a child mostly came from how I felt no one understood me really, and however well meaning my parents were, they just made mistakes because they had no idea about ADD. (possible i am better off, as back in the 90s they heavily over-medicated kids with adhd around here(Hungary)).

I never really wanted to hurt myself. But the thought of how much easier it would be to just die, and how everyone can be sad now, that they lost me, and how i cannot take the damn hurt inside anymore were pretty frequent for  a while.

Live your own life. Your parents live in a different life, different culture, they might not be able to understand your mental state, but it is your decision to go and get diagnosed and look for help. Life is not about money, or how much you contribute. 

And yeah, drugs are fun. Obviously. But if you use them moderately, and look for the quality of the feelings and emotions that you get when you use them, try to figure out what can give you that feeling in everyday life. Obviously it will be a smaller version of the feeling, but you can build up. My first time using mdma (only a handful of experiences through a couple of years) I cried from the happiness I felt. Because I forgot how I can feel happy from the bottom of my heart. But I kept that feeling as a sample, and I am working on getting there without the drugs too. I am in a relationship, and we are struggling financially and mentally, but I WANT it to change for the better now, and I am nearing therapy, and I have rare, but very happy moments now. 

Baby steps, I guess :)"

BPD,fc8garl,t3_egoxe8,1577534268.0,"Do you have any medications that are related to your condition? They might be affecting your libido. I mean yeah. We change a lot. But if sex was ever something that was not only about control, but connection and enjoying yourselves, it might worth it to talk to a doc and see if your meds can be at fault. 

Also, I think, if you value this relationship, as you seem to be, you might want to talk to your lady about this, and ask if she is okay with this. Sexuality is an important part of the relationship. Be on the same side about it. If you are both alright like this, then cool, if  not, you will need to deal talk about it carefully, to keep the connection you have, but keep you both happy."
depression,fc8ctp0,t3_egdm43,1577532030.0,"Hi there!

I just wanted to say that I started to turn around my life around 25. I couldn't bear the constant arguing with my mom, I was drudging along with a bachelors degree for the 6th year (and I loved it, I had good grades, I just did not show up for some exams when depression hit really hard.) I left my country, and spent 9 months in London. I found a bycicle delivery job for sandwiches, and put together enough money in half a year to do an English teacher  training. CELTA course is a month to complete, and a lot of my fellow students left to positions in less than a month, in awesome places (I came home to finish uni). Most of them are still teaching English in places like VIetnam, Vienna, Malta... oh. and most of them does not have English as first language. I am just saying this, because of a lot of people does not realize how important it is to learn English to anyone who does not speak it as a mother tongue. Boom, you already have some important skills here! I am also pretty sure you could get hired closer to home teaching immigrants English, or doing summer camps for kids (which is an awesome way to get experience). Long shot, but if you are interested, you can definitely look into this. 

I also had a lot of friends who went on cruises as bartenders, photographers, cleaning ladies. It is quite a lot of money in Eastern European terms, but I bet, you could save up some money with a couple of years of this. It is tiring, but you don't have to pay rent or for food. It is perfect to save up to start from, and all of my friends came back with tons of friends all around the world.

25 feels too old to live at home. But unfortunately nowadays all around the world we have problems with this...

Also, as someone who left not one but two nice paying jobs in IT service desks, I will let you know, the people I was jealous of from afar, who fly around the world for their jobs.... they look a lot less happy from close up. Money issues with prepaying the tickets, flying around but just to teleport between different offices around the world with different timezones of 9to5. 

25 is not late. Not too early either. Just keep on looking into what interests you. Check on what you can learn on the internet, videos, courses... Then look up options to have a training, and where you can find a job and move. 

It sounds like you will have to make a decision. No one else will.

Good luck! 

(ps. don't tell it to everyone, but after 30 it is kinda awesome. i am still depressed. but i found a lot of friends and an awesome guy, who are also mostly depressed. we understand each other. and we don't deal in bullshit. i think 30 was when I started to build up my bullshit detector, and it works awesomely. still a lot of work, but it's worth it)"
