unpopularopinion,fh84lom,t1_fh7x44d,1581351908.0,"So I'd have lost the bet, because I didn't snoop your profile. What a tragedy! Guess you're just nasty in general, which is worse."

unpopularopinion,fh73s8a,t1_fh6zhfe,1581314106.0,"I mean, right off the bat, they cited South American countries as a whole then listed others individually as if Venezuela's got it going on economically, socially etc, not to mention Bolivia..."
unpopularopinion,fh73hz0,t1_fh70cj8,1581313824.0,"You know, I've replied lengthily to several comments on this post, but I think you've really simplified the matter."
unpopularopinion,fh73ehj,t1_fh71tdp,1581313730.0,"Oh, I don't know about that. 

I've personally only been outside of the country once, but I've traveled relatively extensively within it and seen quite a bit, my father spent his formative years in the backwaters of Southeast Asia and (as a ranger) has traveled to many other countries, and my mother (a respected RN for nearly three decades) has worked for several physicians who came here to escape (in their words) the depression of socialized medicine.

 They told stories of leaving through the back door of the office because they couldn't stand to walk past the patients lined up out the door who they couldn't see that day, after already having been there long past regular hours.

We're not perfect, and those stories (and many of ours) hurt my heart especially now that I have children. But we are, or at least can be, the land of opportunity.

America has a whole lot to offer, and you shouldn't judge our people by our politicians or the televised minority."
unpopularopinion,fh72sxx,t1_fh70t8t,1581313153.0,"I could be wrong, but I'd be willing to bet it's an alt account made for this sole purpose. I lean a little liberal, but what the hell is the point of wasting effort on something like this?

You're never gonna change anyone's opinion by being aggressively douchy lol.

Edit: I'm talking about ""Fuck off, troll"" guy, just so y'all know lol"
