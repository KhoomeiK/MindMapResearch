news,ffi42a0,t3_etjae7,1579964482.0,"I am still startled, every day, that people don't understand how this all works.  The US President is a narcissist who has had wealth his entire life dictate that he gets to do what he wants.  He is elected (he gamed the system to win, which sucks but if you don't like it, change the system) and then hires people around him to either help him look good or just help him look good.  (Big surprise here, too)  And then, when the people are put in front of cameras, they SIDE WITH THEIR BOSS.  Either they started that way and were hired because they hold similar views and are similar people ORRRR they are covering their own ass in public, to maintain the idea that they are in lock step with the President.  Likely it's some combination of both.  It's no secret the guy is stupid like a box of hammers but why we keep marveling at his stupidity, why we keep retweeting his nonsensical bulilshit, why we keep pointing cameras at the guy and then being upset when he doesn't speak the truth (or some weird semblence of it anyway) is the part that really, REALLY boggles my mind.  He's an ass and an idiot and he got elected.  Now, vote him the fuck out."

She's an awful person (I don't ha e any evidence but I'm good if others do) but if we aren't being truthful about her ugliness then we can't combat it. The truth is very important.
