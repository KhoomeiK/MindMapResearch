SuicideWatch,fdeko54,t1_fdeisuh,1578341059.0,"Eh, creativity is only an idea - even if it's more of a hobby than a job, it really does bring a lot of meaning into the way your life is lived. And though I can guarantee you aren't skill-less, I know that some of the most skill-less people in life end up doing the most. My Grandma for example? Somewhat socially awkward, never really got a proper job, dropped out of med school halfway through, and just stayed at home to raise her kids as best as she could. But even though she really didn't have any work-type skills, she's one of my favourite people - she loves me just simply for existing, and anything she knows how to do or say to help, she will. Technically speaking, her skills aren't the best at anything - but her impact on my life makes me happy that she's stuck with us for this long"
SuicideWatch,fdeinew,t1_fdegntg,1578339835.0,"Oh I regret failing the attempt alright, and most days I'll have moments where I truly wish it had worked. Just, I know that that's my depression speaking, not necessarily how I always feel. I've also learned to appreciate smaller things in life - after I was let out of the hospital, the first thing I did was go to a restaurant, and I just looked at the logo and smiled, because I wouldn't have seen that logo ever again otherwise. 

And yeah, I know how useless a comment like mine can seem. Really, there's not much you can do if someone's decided to go and off themselves. (I know this cause I never responded to the people who commented on my own suicide note here.)

I don't know if what I said will help, all I know is that I wanted to offer OP a little tidbit of that wretched emotion known as hope."
SuicideWatch,fdehzy0,t1_fdeeeys,1578339440.0,"I feel like it's one of those things that can only be fully understood in hindsight, but I'll try and come up with some sorta answer for ya.

Basically, you either end up dead (which I suppose is the point), or you end up getting treated like some sort of special person who's highly sensitive by everyone who figures out. You get a lot of kind people, but you know that part of it is faked, that they're being nice only because they know. It kinda increases your paranoia about people (do they really like me? Or are they just acting that way cause I tried to die?) 

Also, some form of PTSD often accompanies a failed attempt, (which I assure you is never fun)"
SuicideWatch,fdehjga,t1_fdefror,1578339156.0,"To answer your first question, I only regretted it after the second attempt (which is when my family + friends found out, and is also my first time getting professional help). And honestly, sometimes I still wish I had followed through and attempted a third time (my depression still affects me like that)... I simply realized that while life sucks, it still exists for a reason, and I still have something to offer the world (no matter how small it is)

Also, I haven't had any books published as I am still in highschool. My studies have gotten in the way of writing novels so far, but I've written a lot of short stories and poems that I send to my friends and family, just little things to keep my creativity flowing until I have the time to write a real book.

Sorry if those answers are confusing/hard to follow, I'm currently tired and probably not making a lot of sense :p 

Hope your day is treating you well :)"

2. Believe me suicide attempts aren't worth it, I've tried twice and regret both times. Also, use your lack of popularity to your advantage: you're free, way more free. I have more friends now than a few years ago, and while friends are good to have around, there's a certain sense of freedom that comes with only having a few. (A freedom that I now miss having)... Loneliness sucks ass, I know. And work life sucks even more. 

Question: how creative are you? I'm trying to avoid a 9-5 job by becoming an author, which is tricky to do, but worth it cause I enjoy it. Perhaps a 9-5 job just ain't your way to go, which is honestly an amazing thing (cause 9-5 jobs suck)"

If you ain't normal, you're already on my good side - (cause I'm not normal either)... Abnormality is fun for the most part, people who make fun of it are just missing out"
