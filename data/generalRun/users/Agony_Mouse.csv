Everyone who knows me now is shocked to discover that I wasn't always a cat person. I was team dogs until my grandparents came to watch me for 3 weeks while my parents were on vacation. They brought their two cats, and one of those cats converted me. Now I get to watch my calico convert others. What a beautiful cycle <3"

Then it took them forever to find someone to go into a personal examination room with her because ""no one wants to handle a cat with claws."" Mind you, she was being very well behaved.
