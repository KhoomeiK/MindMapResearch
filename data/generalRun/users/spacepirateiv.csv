Whatcouldgowrong,ffqphtc,t1_ffqkpuq,1580140606.0,"So this was the specific case at hand and I was responding to somebody, but what I said was not strictly only about these people. I don’t know them. I was basically commenting on the larger social media phenomena of being a huge amplifier of stuff. Social media stars have to sell, its their job, it’s how they make money. Doing this requires larger than life reactions, camera angles, photo shop, makeup, poses, lighting, etc etc. I think most people find a fake ness in social media and are distrusting of it, which I am. Being distrustful of social media stars doesn’t make me miserable."
Whatcouldgowrong,ffqjvzi,t1_ffqhujy,1580136611.0,"They are trying to make the most drastic signal of how ‘happy’ they are by an over the top smile on the girls face and some kind of outward display of jubilation (in this case jumping into the dudes arms). The thing is, happiness is it’s own reward and it wouldn’t manifest in such an obviously carefully planned out video for social media. People who are actually happy would often do a very quick after thought one take photo which would resemble maybe a classic family photo where people are just stood smiling. These people here are trying to sell a lie of a perfect life and that’s why the reaction to something so basic is disproportionate to the thing they did. I’m not an expert though, this is just my experience of it."

Thus she is as bad as the other guy who has no dignity for himself and paid it. The alternative options I listed were the things a responsible adult with a moral compass and dignity would do."

modernwarfare,fcvptf3,t1_fcvkofc,1578007375.0,"Shoothouse is a different story. It’s so small that spawn flips will happen every few minutes regardless. I’m talking the other massive maps where certain home spawns have a locational advantage to B (most of the maps have a better home base). I cap B and then go hunt the enemy likes it TDM for the rest of the match. As I’ve said to others, it’s important to kill the other team members as much as possible to suppress them and keep them from gaining ground. On those bigger maps, your gonna want your ground and map control over a quick and dirty cap."
modernwarfare,fcvog1n,t1_fcvllio,1578006509.0,"I don’t camp either, I run the front lines back and forth between their path and B and try to predict where they are trying to move too. If they start capping home flag, I go back there. Often times I do go right back to their spawn but won’t cap the flag unless our home flag is being capped. You don’t have to camp a flag to defend it, you need to aggressively suppress the enemy so they gain no ground. In fact a team that caps more flags but gets less kills is likely to lose the match so rushing is needed. Plus if you don’t rush and kill them, odds are they will gather into a group and be able to break through and take your flags."
modernwarfare,fcvl4cl,t1_fcvg3qn,1578004425.0,"Holding all 3 flags, IMO, is a theoretical peak performance of domination that can come about in the game at about the half way point. Capping all the flags is one thing, but to hold them for any meaningful amount of time means you need heavy enemy suppression wherein all team members coordinate their assault and saving/launching all their killstreaks at once. This will suppress the enemy for a while, but eventually the other team is bound to recap a flag. Capturing all 3 flags is something you try to do for as long as possible to gain a big lead. 3 flag caps, for any meaningful amount of time,usually happen in cod if your team is doing much better than the other team and is crushing them with kills. But in SBMM world, this occurrence is more rare, so often just focusing on two flags is the best course of action as nobody uses mic’s in public’s to coordinate anything more complex than that."
modernwarfare,fcv7cl6,t3_ej2ni9,1577996159.0,"I swear to god, every match I tell my squad:  “just let them have C. Right now guarding B is our primary concern and we have full map control on this end now. Capping C will spawn flip us and we will lose control.”

modernwarfare,fcsdxfw,t3_ein842,1577915179.0,"The sbmm at the very least needs to be relaxed if they don’t want to remove it entirely. I mean we aren’t exactly at the levels we were in advanced warfare where it seemed like going neutral in a match was the best you could ask for, but the sbmm in MW Is definitely up there with some of the strictest we’ve had."

Essentially he gave a variety of answers to different news outlets, but in the [Hollywood Reporter](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/carrie-fishers-urn-is-a-huge-prozac-pill-961625) source that Google pulled the answer from he states it was an antique from the '50's, but he is clearly mistaken."
todayilearned,fcn9r5j,t1_fcn8nxg,1577806878.0,I have no idea about it. All I did was google search the answer so that nobody else had too. That explanation is paraphrased from a quote that is supposedly from her brother who states it’s from the 50s.
