Assuming a d&d like setup, the boys and Cas are probably around level 19 at this point, and so their bonuses and class abilities are higher than almost any other creatures they have encountered.  Leviathans probably capped with Dick Roman at level 11.  Most Angels and demons are lower level than that, Regular Arch Angels are between level 15 to 18.  Buffed Arch angels are probably 19s, and Chuck, Amara are level 20.   I am such a dork."

Before it started happening to me, I saw it unfold the same way a number of times for other people I know, the more confident they become, the less need or time they had for caring about other people.  But it's fine, I posted this in a sub called unpopular opinion.  I'm confident that if studies were done on the subject at length, you'd see a correlation between a drop in attitudes of care towards others, especially strangers, with general increases in confidence.  It's difficult to become highly successful without confidence, and those same people who become successful in life generally have to do so at the expense of others, it's just the nature of the beast."

As I've gotten older, starting around my early 30's, I've been able to operate with confidence around people and in regards to my job, but there has been a cost.  It used to be that I could be moved by the stories and experiences of others, often to tears, but these days it's become almost effortless for me to just tune the suffering of other people out if I have some more pressing concern, and even when I do care, I don't care as much as I used to, nor do I feel compelled to help others the way I did when I was  younger.  It took me a while to realize, but the more confident I am in my life, the more people look up to me, the more I find myself looking down on others.  I have not changed for the better, but I don't know how to go back either.

unpopularopinion,ff4s7br,t1_ff1y2tv,1579571174.0,"No, I'm not saying it's not possible.  But I've never met anyone like that.  The confident people I've known in my 40 years of life weren't able to understand empathy, sympathy and genuine care outside of their selves and close circle until their confidence was shattered by some life event.  In contrast, most of the shy, un-confident, awkward people I've known, the ""undesirables"" if you will, usually have very high levels of empathy, sympathy, as well as high degrees of neurotic or antisocial behaviors.  

In my own life, as I've become more confident, I can tell you that I'm honestly less empathetic and caring about people than I used to be.  It's a bit disturbing, but confidence just sort of creeps up on you, and it changes you, not in a way that I feel like makes me a better person.  Truthfully, I just feel fake most of the time these days."

All people lacking confidence are creepy, cringy, stupid, incels, etc.  I've known a lot of confident people, and they're all assholes, at least until their confidence ends up biting them hard because they stop being people who can evolve and change with the world.  Once they lose that confidence, they usually become bearable to be around again.  There are no doubt some confident people who don't become assholes, but in my experience, I haven't come across any."

I guess the Leviathans could have turned on each other after Dick died, but they never left any remains of their victims in the past.  I guess that means that there is something else that can kill a Leviathan, perhaps weapons made in that world can innately kill anything that dwells there, I remember when Dean brought back a weapon from there and it seemed to be dangerous to demons.

I had a crush at work that I admitted to having and she told me it was inappropriate to have feelings for coworkers and took HR action.  Prior to this we were what I would have guessed as good work friends, joking, hanging out on breaks, etc.  The result was that I was investigated for sexual harassment, none was found a day later (because there just was none), but I was instructed to have minimal contact with her from now on, only allowed to interact if it was a strictly work related issue.    


A month later she puts in her two weeks notice (there was not a single word had between us during that period), and I felt awful, like maybe somehow I had actually harassed her without realizing it, I just didn't understand why her reaction was so extreme.  I was thinking at most I'd have gotten ""thanks but no thanks"" and I would have let it drop there.    


I figured that since she was leaving in two weeks (and taking vacation time for all but 1 of those days), there was no harm in trying to at least make a last ditch apology by email.  So I did, telling her how awful I felt that I had done something to make her so uncomfortable and wishing her the best of luck at her new job she had lined up.  Well, that was stupid of me. She forwarded my email to HR and they put me on suspension for the two weeks that she had left (but wasn't actually coming into the office for) so there was no chance of contact between us since I couldn't be trusted to follow the rules.   


Several women I know and have talked to about the incident told me that it's a red flag and completely ""creepy"" to be approached by a man at your place of work.  Evidently it's the first sign of stalker behavior...(Stalkers of Reddit, I really hate your guts).   


So, lesson learned I guess.  If the reverse had happened (and I just wasn't interested), I would have just sorry, not interested and let it go. I guess I can understand her reaction though, the world can be a much more dangerous place for women, so I try not to take what happened too hard, even though it left a mark on me. My best guess is that she must have had some bad past experience that flavored her reaction."

Oh and of course is smart on top of all that.  Basically, low neurotic ism.   


Luckily I have a wonderful wife and I am actually none of these things (except for Supportive), so there's hope for the rest of you out there too!"
dataisbeautiful,fcucin6,t1_fctu5pn,1577977763.0,"I feel you on this.  I'm seeing a therapist right now, every week for the last six months for depression and self worth issues, and it hasn't helped yet.  It is kind of nice to unload in a session, but I can't say that I feel any better about myself or the world in general.  Every day I look in a mirror and tell myself how great I am, all the while feeling nothing except that I'm lying to myself.  ""Give it time"" is what you're told.    


Since it's so important to my wife that I do this, I'm faking improvement, which I'm sure long term is just going to make things worse.  Some people just don't respond to talk therapy.  I'm sure it doesn't help that I read up on all the techniques that therapists use and so I recognize what she's trying to coax out of me at any given time, making it that much more difficult to have any real self revelations."

Kind of how I might react if someone told me they believed that a Corgi named Claudia pooped out Spain in 1856 and that's the reason why we have molecules.

Nothing as weird as what I've seen here, but stuff like ""I'm fucking the Doctor's secretary but she's not my wife.""  This always seems to happen on elevators.  So far I've always just nodded along like everything was perfectly normal and that this stranger wasn't confiding one of his dark secrets to me and making regular small talk.  My wife didn't believe me until one day we got on an elevator with another guy, who leans in toward me and says ""My daughter's husband likes to dress up in her clothes, can you believe that shit?"" I hate elevators, and it has nothing to do with the usual reasons."
relationships,fcgctfc,t1_fcd0hha,1577638711.0,"Yeah, the initial reason for the breakup is key for understanding where the relationship can possibly go, but on the face of it I wouldn't trust that anything will really be different a second time around."
polyamory,fcgcgnl,t1_fcddmeu,1577638606.0,"It can happen, but usually only when the circumstances are very hard for the people involved.  Where my grandparents grew up they didn't see their first automobile until 1955! This is the U.S. where cars had be standard for quite a long time.  They lived in highly rural Arkansas and were about as poor as one can be, having no electricity, no car, having to make their lives on farms that were barely able to sustain the large families they had (she had 4 sisters and 5 brothers) (he had 5 sisters and 2 brothers).  Under such hard conditions you don't really get to be a child.  You appreciate the people in your life that you care about in a stronger way perhaps because it's all you really have.  

So, I'll still agree that most of the time people don't really understand what romantic love is at 14. For that matter I don't think they understand it at 18 either, and some people I don't think ever really understand it at all.  But there are exceptions and I believe that they are the product of how difficult life is for you growing up."
polyamory,fcceg8c,t1_fc598ln,1577597457.0,"My grandparents were together from the ages of 14 (her) and 16 (him) till when he died at at the age of 66 from cancer.  She says that she fell in love with him from the moment they met and is still in love with him to this day (he's been gone now for 25 years).  I would say that in the majority of cases you are right, but from an absolute sense, you are wrong.  Eighteen is also remarkably arbitrary, people aren't much different from 17 as they are from 18, probably not even that much different from 16 to 18."
relationships,fcbxq0u,t3_egwl3u,1577592142.0,"I don't think you can prepare anyone for a breakup.  Telling him that a breakup is on the table is only going to heighten his anxiety, depression and sadness, and likely lead to him becoming far more unstable than he might already be, potentially in a dangerous way to both you and himself.  Desperation can cause people to act extremely irrationally.    


Like someone else said, let him know that therapy with you is the only option to continue forward, otherwise you have to part ways because you aren't happy anymore the way things are and you have to have hope that things will get better.  This is a reasonable and minimal step to take, and if he goes once or twice but then stops going, or makes unreasonable excuses for not being able to go with you, then let him go.  Put distance between the two of you, and know that you tried and that if he does harm his own life, that was his choice.    


No matter what you have a rocky road ahead of you."
relationships,fcbu2pg,t3_egz7u5,1577590984.0,"First, try to remember why you broke it off.  She's not going to suddenly be a different person, even if she might be acting differently this time around, it's only going to last so long.  If you broke it off because you just wanted to play the field a bit longer, well there you go, you did and weren't satisfied and now understand what a good thing you had.  Don't mention what you've been up to while you were separated unless she wants to know, and if she does ask be honest.  It's likely a bad sign if she asks though, it's really none of her business what you did during those four months, and I'd be skeptical even if she indicated that she were ""fine"" with you having a couple of sexual partners. Just the fact that she wants to know means that it's important for her to know, and I don't know too many people in that situation that would just want to know ""just because""."
relationships,fcbsbfi,t3_egfglf,1577590418.0,"I'll never understand emotional cheating.  If he isn't satisfying needs you have, that's a legitimate complaint, but emotional cheating is not, nor ever will be,  a real thing.  Were that truly so, women and men would be emotionally cheating on their partners all the time.  The logic there is that people typically have many of their emotional needs met by their friends, things that for one reason or another they just don't get from their partner. It's not reasonable for one's partner to expect that all or even most of their emotional needs be met by them.  I have many of my needs met by my wife, but I other needs that are met by my closest friends, yet others by family, and finally some needs that are only met by a therapist I see.  It's a red flag for me when someone tells me their partner wants all or most of their emotional needs met by them, that's typically a sign of someone who is being very possessive, and unless the relationship is between two very possessive people, ultimately one of the two is going to start feeling trapped and controlled.  I'm glad that you broke it off with him, I don't think the relationship would have been healthy and fulfilling to either of you in any kind of truly long term situation, you're just naturally poison to each other.  Two bullets dodged."
relationships,fcblz8x,t3_egvpqn,1577588397.0,"Most people here are going to tell you to forget about him even though you said multiples times that you love him dearly.  If things were reversed and he was supporting you while you were trying to develop some artistic talent, I don't many people would tell you to just give up the relationship, no matter how progressive we seem to be, it's still ok for men to take care of women but not for women to take care of men in most situations.   


As for why he can't do better, that's a tough one.  Some people are not wired to be able to be able to have such a strong mentality for working their way out of a situation no matter how difficult it is, and artists are notoriously like this.  If you believe he really has talent that is worth nurturing, and that he can and will make something of it one day, then eventually you might be the one reaping the benefits of his fame and success that could emerge from it.  You really need to decide if he has the talent.  You also need to know that you can't change a person's nature.  Only they can do that for themselves, and usually only after they have suffered through something difficult that gives them a different perspective on life.    


Your situation is especially difficult because you've come to the end of being able to realistically take care of yourself and him at the same time.  I don't think you have a choice, you don't have the money, you can't take care of yourself and him at the same time.  You need to make it clear that you aren't splitting up your living situation for any other reason than you just don't have a choice and that if things improved for you or him or both of you, you'd be willing to entertain living together again, because you love him dearly.  If he doesn't understand that, then he's probably not truly in love with you and is just using you and would likely leave you anyway if someone better came along.  That's a hard thing to have to come to terms with, but you seem like a woman of great strength and I believe you'll be able to overcome the sadness that comes with it and be able to eventually find someone who makes you just as happy, if not more, that does have your best interests at heart."
