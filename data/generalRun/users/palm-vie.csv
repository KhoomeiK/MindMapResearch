MoonGirl did “lay it out” but overlooked the fact that OP mentions that his connection doesn’t exist. That isn’t some BS mistake that happens when you misread something. It’s sketchy as hell.

Your experience is different from the one I outlined. There’s knowing your heritage and then there’s randomly discovering that your great great great great great grandmother was from Mexico and using performative identity to be “Mexican”.

A friend commented on some gifts I bought for Christmas and wanted to buy the same ones.

Sleep regression, nightmares, night terrors, illness, wetting the bed, needing to go to the bathroom, feeling scared, etc. could impact why a kid isn’t always asleep through the night. My two 5 year olds will still wake up sometimes and at 3-4 they were having issues staying dry over night consistently.

TeenMomOGandTeenMom2,fgk1h1q,t1_fgjn767,1580855544.0,"The thing is some people use comparative models to show how much “better” they are now but don’t afford it to other people. Kailyn is screwed up but definitely a little better than her mother. However, she’s still a shit show. She doesn’t see that though. And I’d bet to wager other people in that same situation don’t either. I have friends who grew up screwed up. While they love touting* how much better they are than their parents, they still engage in the same shitty behavior just in a lower frequency. So yeah a lot of people might have had tough childhoods and might be doing “great” but what that looks like is pretty subjective.

However, because of increased progesterone, I noticed how short my breath got when doing anything more strenuous than walking. Swimming was the one thing that helped with back pain though.

WeightLossAdvice,fgi9k6i,t3_eycgq3,1580812777.0,"I will say that in my teen years, playing sports helped to maintain my weight - a lot. You still need to learn to eat healthy(I used to gain 20 lbs in between seasons because my food habits were crap) but staying active will help tremendously. You don’t have to be an all star to at least make the JV teams. It just a dedicated amount of time each week, that you spend being active during practice. Find something you like and try to go for it. Again, what you eat will make a difference, especially as you get older and it becomes harder to spend time working out. But staying active is a part of setting yourself up to lead a healthy lifestyle. That being said, if your parents are receptive to it, try to make small changes, even if it’s just for yourself.

The rooms we end up with are typically 2 queens and a pullout/sofa bed. When with infants, the hotels would try to provide a portable crib for us to use. Don’t be sneaky, it’s not worth the headache."
FundieSnark,ffh3gg2,t1_ffgqxjm,1579922073.0,"Same. There were a lot of screamers and ladies who curse when I delivered #3. For the first two, I think I was one of three people delivering that day and they spread us all the heck out so I didn’t hear anyone."
FundieSnark,ffh37yv,t1_ffglum1,1579921890.0,"I heard other women birthing at the Hospital while I myself was birthing. A lot of loud ass grunting, shouting, cursing, and screaming while you’re pushing. That was with an epidural. We had a “new moms” meeting room and yeah. You may not be able to feel contractions but even with medical intervention you can feel baby crowning and splitting you open."
AskMen,ffgzbt9,t1_ffgfcbe,1579918948.0,"I thought The Killing was fine and appreciated the slow burn nature of the show. It made it more “realistic” than a lot of other police procedural shows where it’s a new bad guy/new case each week. However, I hated where things ended with Linden and Holder. It was unnecessary, forced, and completely out of left field."
jerseyshore,ffgiioy,t3_etgclh,1579907015.0,"Mukbang videos are pretty popular. I’ve never watched Mike or Lauren - don’t think I ever will, but some it’s cool just to see other dishes that I wouldn’t normally order myself. They can be cool just to show case “exotic to me” cuisine."
CountingOn,ffgdyef,t1_ffgcj96,1579904099.0,I never said he was always fundie.
CountingOn,ffgc182,t1_ffg8uwz,1579902910.0,"Lol what? I’m responding to your comment regarding Kanye’s discography after I mentioned, “Jesus Walks”."
CountingOn,ffg87g0,t1_ffg6v9g,1579900564.0,">And?

Fundies are dense enough to over look all the stuff and simply say, “he was saved” or view it as a testimony to God’s greatness. If all Sex Pest had to do was give a half assed apology to prove he changed, I doubt the bar is higher for any other man*. Christians like the Duggars get a hard on for anyone they even think agrees with them. 

*Man and not woman. We all know to fundies, men > women."
CountingOn,ffg3eti,t1_fffskx0,1579897606.0,"TBF, “Jesus Walks” is old Kanye too"
DaveRamsey,fffzd73,t1_fffpfwv,1579895111.0,How long did it take you to find that? We’re in a 2bd/2ba with a den (so maybe 3 bd) for $3k in the South Bay. It wouldn’t be bad at all if we didn’t have have the biggest cheapskate for a landlord. Will be moving at the end of our lease.
FundieSnark,fffcbn1,t1_fff9eln,1579880825.0,"I mean it is certainly true. But again, knowing something like that versus having some smug AH shout it at you are two different things. If it was *maybe* supportive from a designated accountability partner, okay. But this isn’t supportive and it’s her FIL negging her the same way her POS husband does."
FundieSnark,ffdqy2u,t3_et2fho,1579826787.0,"So I know “abs are made in the kitchen” but if my FIL sent me that, I’d kick him in the hip."
FundieSnark,ffdqrtu,t1_ffdk6qu,1579826676.0,Exactly. My face contorted into a Chrissy Tiegan like grimace when I heard her “correct” herself.
FundieSnark,ffdarin,t3_et04fq,1579816826.0,The cringe in this video. Also WTF is wrong with people not using “and I” vs. “and me” correctly? Not the best example of being smart and educated.
FundieSnark,ffcvne5,t1_ffc55p7,1579808211.0,"I left DS because it just drifted so far away from what it was just a year ago. Now, it all has to be 100% Duggars. No drawing parallels, anything that isn’t super hateful is seen as leg humping, most of the snark is reserved for appearances and less about their beliefs, etc."
