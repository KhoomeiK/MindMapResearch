He complained to the owner, owner told him to relax and accept it.

During a meeting he was ranted about employees not showing “love for the project”. And he expected employees to stay over pass regular hours.

The most passive member of the cad designers spoke out of the sudden. 

No raises, no benefits, cant even go to the bathroom without you complaining about how long it takes us to pee, treat us like crap and you looking for love for the project? What are you high?

I started laughing right away. Hell the owner of the company was laughing too.
