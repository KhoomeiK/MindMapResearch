During an attempt at a complicated trick, he crashed hard. After they were sure he was fine, someone said, “you wrecked so hard, I thought you might be able to get up and walk!”"

Christianity,fcxlbxq,t1_fcxkk1p,1578065710.0,"It is up for debate, considering no one believed in a rapture until the 19th century. 

Your interpretation of 1 Thessalonians is not clear. “Caught Up” comes from the Greek word *harpagesometha*, this word has a more nuanced meaning and “combines the ideas of force and suddenness seen in the irresistible power of God” (Leon Morris, Tyndale New Testament Commentaries, Revised Edition, 1984, p. 94)."
Christianity,fcxk2tj,t3_ejgj2g,1578064863.0,">is there scripture that proves otherwise?

Yes, but not the way you’re expecting. To put it bluntly, the entire idea of a rapture is considered completely bogus by most theologians. 

The book of Daniel and Revelation isn’t some secret code that needs to be cracked in order to predict the end times. Scripture doesn’t work that way. Also the entire premise of a rapture came about in the 19th century. So it’s a relatively “new” concept with no support from early Christians. 

Personally, I believe the “end times” and Christ’s second coming is when the world gets better, not worse. Just like in the Lord’s Prayer “your kingdom come your will be Done, on *earth* as it is in *heaven*.”

When Jesus talks about the beatitudes (“blessed are the poor” etc) he’s describing what we imagine heaven is to be like, but He’s describing what this world can become.  Jesus returns to confirm our good work in pursuit of making the beatitudes a daily reality in our world. Heaven literally comes to earth and we live eternity here on earth in God’s presence. 

Here’s a article that further describes the rapture. Not a long read: https://www.ucg.org/world-news-and-prophecy/the-rapture-a-popular-but-false-doctrine

Also, if you want to read more about alternative perspectives on the end times and Christ’s return, look up NT Wright’s “Surprised by Hope” or or books from Ben Witherington III “Revelation” and “Jesus, Paul and the End of the World”

Disclaimers: I’m on mobile, so excuse me for being brief or any misspellings, poor grammar, or missed capitalizations. Also, I would not argue that NT Wright or Ben Witherington have the exact same beliefs as mine, when I described my view of Christ’s return."
