facepalm,ff3cobl,t1_ff389qq,1579538512.0,"Nobody has to hold your hand, and I'm not about to. A sort of just did I suppose, but let me make something clear. I'm not calling you an idiot to be insulting, im calling you an idiot because you are acting like an idiot.

You are either an idiot, or you are purposefully acting like an idiot to try to tick people off, which is in itself acting like an idiot. If that offends you I guess that's your problem, you don't get to decide what is and isn't fact simply because you don't like it. The Hardline on this is that what is being portrayed in these pictures is racist and if you're having trouble understanding that you can absolutely ask why that might be.  it's the way in which you tend to respond that makes it pretty clear you have no interest in learning changing or becoming an actual human being, so much is just ""getting at the libs"" which makes bothering with you a complete waste of my time. so I'm just going to block you from here forward feel free to rage into the void if you'd like I've made clear why this is racist and why you're an idiot for believing otherwise."
facepalm,ff3c29d,t1_ff396c3,1579538204.0,"The context in which this is racist is pretty straightforward. You have a bunch of white guys, wearing shirts proclaiming black people for Trump. At this point, you have basically white guys proclaiming that the black community supports Trump. This isn't true

He may actually have some followers who are black, and they're welcome to wear those shirts if they'd like. You're also not seeing the shirts at functions proclaiming or pretending to be black organizational celebrations for black people supporting Trump which might allow a white guy to wear such a shirt in support of that community. What these are, are a bunch of racist assholes trying to get a rise out of people. in that context, knowing that them wearing the shirt will cause outrage, makes the entire situation racist."
facepalm,ff2t9pf,t1_ff26b3x,1579523227.0,"Wow, did I strike a nerve?

No, a shirt isn't racist.  Even the slogan on this shirt isn't racist.  It's the context within the wearing of the shirt that is racist.

So again, if this is difficult for you to understand, you might be racist.  You might also just be an idiot.  You could also just be acting like an idiot to get a rise out of people.  One way or another, it makes you pathetic, unless you are genuinely racist, which makes you uneducated."
facepalm,ff1qzt7,t1_ff15wfr,1579484261.0,"If you can't see the racist bullshit going on, it's highly likely you yourself are racist.  It has nothing to do with how many supporters he has.  You've gotta be racist, stupid, projecting, or any mix of the three.  I'll let you decide on that one.  You'll guess wrong anyway."

Planetside 2.

Even then, Planetside had been out for years before MAG.  Im not sure if the original could reach 256 players or not however.  If not, it came close for sure.

Its seemingly always forgotten about, i'll never fully understand why but its not like SOE did itself any favors.  Even Daybreak has no idea what its really doing with the IP anymore after Planetside:Arena crashed and burned like the joke it was.  Its sad, PS2 is still a fantastic game, it'll never reach the audience it should have."

So, if she stays quiet nothing changes.  He rots, she's free to live her life.  If she speaks up, her life is destroyed, and his is not fairing well either.  She now has almost no incentive to admit to wrongdoing and therefore doesn't.  He rots in prison longer than he already has as a result.

Maybe the problem lies in finding someone guilty of something they didn't do?  Maybe finding guilt based on the word of the victim only should carry a different charge?  I don't have the answers, this is a hard issue.  What is clear is what you suggest will only lead to worse injustice than what's already has happened.
