actuallesbians,ff7vc0q,t3_erv60m,1579659226.0,"Dude Im so confused over my emotions right now. I want to be with someone so badly... but I don’t feel ready. There’s a girl I like and I’m not even sure if she’s still Bi-curious. We talk a lot and I try to flirt, and I just hope I dont make her feel uncomfortable :/ Its so confusing.."
scythebookfans,fexpyc8,t3_eqrjl8,1579434622.0,"Boy, I wish there were scythes that were DOGS! I don’t remember reading anything about pets in the books but I’d assume that their lives were at least prolonged to around 50ish years?"
scythebookfans,fexpo9m,t3_eqvaie,1579434504.0,That’s really cool!
ScythePosts,fexpl49,t3_eqlyjv,1579434467.0,Dude it’s beautiful! You did the shading so well

scythebookfans,fek4tz3,t1_f7xfd1c,1579192630.0,What if I wanted to get gleaned though? B)
scythebookfans,fek4ne4,t3_dxdo6n,1579192520.0,"I thought about that, and to me someone is determined a villain not by what they want, but their execution of getting such things. There’s always a ‘good’ way and a ‘bad’ way in achieving those things, all with varying degrees of difficulty, but all still possible. A good way can be defined as doing in such a way that either has a neutral or positive effect on those not involved in the opinion of your goal."
scythebookfans,fek3w20,t1_fek3kyw,1579192063.0,"That view on the Thunderhead is funny, and something I should definitely look more into lol. I’ve deprived myself of social media view of the books at all until recently."
scythebookfans,fek3plt,t3_eoww1g,1579191955.0,"Like Morrison at the beginning of the third book, I love knowing who wins ahead of them so I can see who wins. That’s why I usually read the last sentence of a book before reading it to get a small hint of what I’m looking for."
scythebookfans,fek3h5k,t1_fek35kt,1579191813.0,We should probably put an “End”ura on this
scythebookfans,fek3c7q,t3_ency8n,1579191730.0,"I think it was less “rushed” and more choppy. The different points of views didn’t blend well together, and it was hard for me to keep track of everything in my head. Yet at the same time, all the stories individually were equally compelling and exciting to read, and almost every new entry of a character was one that had me hooked from the beginning. It’s a lot to ask of one book, but it was handled decently nonetheless."
scythebookfans,fek324a,t1_feg7syx,1579191560.0,Haha I’d call that joke pretty “deep”
ScythePosts,fek1s54,t3_dcbr7l,1579190773.0,Scythe Possuelo has a forest green robe in the third book maybe?

ScythePosts,fegxex0,t3_emwi5m,1579104676.0,I literally joined this subreddit because I FOUND THIS QUOTE WHILE I WAS READING and wanted to post it on some sort of scythe related page. this quote is ingenious.
AskReddit,fee7bm3,t1_feckj1l,1579027890.0,"DUDE! Ive never even seen the movie but it’s a joke in my family because when my parents were dating, they got the movie on accident and were horrified by it!"
