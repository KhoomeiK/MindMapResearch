SuicideWatch,fcnh4oz,t1_fcmuxx5,1577811593.0,"I have, and I want to, but I'm scared to reach out to anyone anymore I kept going to one of my friends (who, no offense, had really bad mental disorders impacting him greatly in his life and I didn't know it was as bad as I thought) because we shared similar problems and it ended up scaring him off. and also I don't really want family getting involved if my friends tell anyone else."
Therian,fclb8yx,t3_ehr57c,1577743835.0,"she can talk to me if she wants, if she doesn't feel comfortable that's okay. I'm also a canine so I figure we could relate on certain things."
Therian,fbd8vu1,t1_fbczmem,1576752817.0,"yeah, I felt awful for getting a real tail, I just didn't know where else to get a tail that moved realistically/had realistic fur patterns."
