tumblr,fffun0i,t1_fffpwat,1579892160.0,"I have memories of things that never happened like going to a funeral that never occurred and going places I’ve never been

Probably the most interesting thing to me is how my mind created an alternate memory of a traumatic event that happened to me.

Slightly nsfw story that includes death so you’ve been warned.

>!when I was about 7 I had this chicken called MuBuff (short for My Buff Orpington) that would follow me around wherever I went and would come when called, it was the best pet that 7 year old me could ask for. One day when I was out running around the barn this hawk flew down and ripped MuBuffs head off right in front of me. I guess that was a pretty traumatic thing for 7 year old me because instead of that memory, I have an alternate one where MuBuff managed to escape from the hawk somehow!<

I find it fascinating that even though I know the truth, that alternate memory feels so real and tangible. It just goes to show how fallible the mind is."

MovieDetails,ffa9mze,t1_ffa8lp4,1579730584.0,"Genetics and environmental changes go hand in hand, a species can’t evolve without both. If the environment does not change then the necessary recessive genetic traits will not surface and become dominant, and if a species does not have the proper genetic traits within its DNA to help it survive in a changing environment then the species will cease to exist.

The reason that fish OP posted about hasn’t changed in the last x million years is because the environment the fish lives in hasn’t change. It has reached the pinnacle of what it needs to be to survive in its current environment so there is no need to change or adapt or change."
