Why vegans don't use or eat animals? For the same reason I've Talked about in the previous comments: we don't want to hurt Animals in any single way, we don't want to be part of this fucking Holocaust.
You are saying just 50% of what veganism is all about.
Veganism is about giving a voice to those who can't defend themselves: the animals.
Animal agriculture is linked to climate change and lot of deseases in humans.
Go vegan!"

Oreos involves killing innocent animals, therefore are not vegan.
A Vegan is a person who does not eat meat eggs and milk, we do not use animals in any way and we do everything that it's possible not to hurt or kill Animals.
It's a simple concept dude, try to use your brain.
Animals deserve to live, go vegan"
vegan,ff712s6,t1_ff6qd1g,1579639009.0,"#Veganism is not just a diet choice. It is a social justice movement which recognises animals as sentient beings that feel pain and have emotions, just like us humans. So, they cannot be treated as commodities, food and other products.
If a plant based food involves hurting, using or killing an animal then it's not a vegan product."

Oreos are plant based, But not vegan.
Palm oil is derived from Palm fruit.
Palm plants needs to grow in tropical areas.
To meet the global demand, they need more space for more plants.
Huge areas of the rainforest are destroyed to make way for plantations that produce palm oil, and several species of animals are threatened with extinction as a direct result of its production.
Hundreds of Animal are being killed just for oil.
All the pictures and videos of dead tropical animals it's heart breaking."
