I'm aware that they live in the city, thanks. Maybe some or most can just go back to work the next day, but it's not like you can be facing down riot cops and say ""T-out guys, we'll pick this up tomorrow, 5:30 sharp!"" 

I'd imagine, being a SMALL CITTYYYY, some places can't just pick up the next day, given they're in the middle or near all the turmoil.

Policing? Take the angry hyperbole down a notch, jesus."
politics,ff7scfv,t1_ff7qjb7,1579657176.0,"I would, if I claimed that they worked.

Truckers,ff4ju6h,t1_ff4ghuj,1579565350.0,"And I'm saying the return is literally the betterment of yourself and the expansion of what you know/understand.

No dude, I just hate the common view that if you don't get a degree for making money, college and uni are pointless."

Way to make yourselves look as dumb as you're desperately trying to not come off like."
Truckers,ff472un,t1_ff42hts,1579556967.0,Some schools have very cheap tuition. Some countries have provided for schooling. There are night classes. You don't have to take a full course load.

No shit. Teachers who know their material make learning much more streamlined and palatable."
Truckers,ff40nwy,t1_ff3w3w9,1579552977.0,A barista joke. From a trucker. How original. Those people went trying to make more money but fucked it up. How thick are you? Are you really debating that school can't be used solely for education?
Truckers,ff3uus6,t1_ff3qdbv,1579549351.0,"If you're strictly going to increase your ability to make money, sure. But y'all don't seem to be aware some people go just to learn. Mostly older people because they have the time, but yeah."

I know exactly what she's referring to, as 2/3 blue collar guys I interact with on a regular basis are racist. They praise me when I walk in the door for not being a brown driver. No, I'm not kidding. Sexism can be just as bad."
