GetMotivated,ff4vdb6,t3_ere89c,1579573341.0,"Yes but the ability to travel at a late age doesn’t mean you can actually travel.  

I only say this because I’ve made it a point to get out there and see as much of the world as I can as young as I can (maybe to the detriment of my savings and investments portfolio). When I’m abroad, I see so many old people struggling to do things like dive and sail and zip line and hike and all this stuff and you can tell they have a disappointed looks on their faces. 

Just gets me sometimes that’s all.

Edit: I’m actually writing this from Fiji and spent the morning snorkeling on a breathtaking reef from my beach bure (bungalow)"
