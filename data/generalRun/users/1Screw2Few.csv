keto,ffaave0,t3_ery6uu,1579731293.0,"Holy shit woman! You found your best self! What a stellar transformation! Don’t let it be for nothing and hang in there with moderation in your diet going forward. Keep an eye on the scale and take action if you fluctuate more than 4-5 lbs. little corrections are much easier than big ones.

Wow you look amazing!"

dogswithjobs,ff6xmwn,t1_ff67smr,1579636994.0,Oh shit. I totally ready right past the name of the harness. Dert. Thanks for spelling it out for my attention deficit disordered brain. I see your point!
dogswithjobs,ff674ek,t1_ff4az7y,1579620713.0,"But if it’s an ad, what’s their angle? What are they advertising?"
dogswithjobs,ff49uft,t1_ff3qgc7,1579558687.0,"What is creepy about this video to you? I’ll admit, I am usually the first to suspect a /hailcorporate that is being pawned off as real, but I fail to see that here for a few reasons.

1) There is no visible branding anywhere that I can see in this video. Ads for generic items don’t benefit a specific company.

2) Some here are saying this is a dog harness ad. Talk about a niche market. You gotta be kidding, right?"
ConvenientCop,ff07pag,t1_fey6k8s,1579466099.0,Correct answer in the comments again! BAM!

instant_regret,fex7c4c,t1_fer0bvu,1579425911.0,Try to ignore the head snap that happened before he even got close to the pole. He has great potential as a footbal (soccer) player.
trashy,feuhunu,t1_feuh25j,1579386661.0,"Well, I apologize for our lack of regulations on the social media companies that are ruining your political climate. Oh, and your climate climate."

news,felty1p,t1_fel71ty,1579230857.0,Capitalism run amok. I wonder how bad peoples lives need to get before we just won’t put up with “business as usual” anymore.
WTF,fedmu92,t3_eoizsa,1579015374.0,I feel like this is possibly an analogy of how the current political situation could go in 2020 if we are lucky.
gifs,fed0qb4,t1_fecz8yk,1578992866.0,Exactly. His spine and cranium broke his fall. S’all good.
u_GovSchwarzenegger,fecro84,t3_eodip7,1578982048.0,Do you care for them completely or do you have help? I am curious how much work a donkey requires.
Showerthoughts,fe6b1se,t1_fe69kd6,1578885878.0,A poop spoon just seems so much safer though.
WTF,fe3xbwr,t1_fe2z19i,1578853710.0,That’s good. The people that drive the commuter rail here make about the same as the bus drivers. Not minimum wage but not far above it.
WTF,fe2s3qy,t1_fe2r48q,1578842288.0,Yeah. Fuck the train company with their underpaid employees that are scraping by in a job where people disrespect them on a daily basis just so they can feed their kids and hopefully one day quit working with enough in savings to not file for welfare. Fuck yeah! Punish them by painting the tool they use to do their job!
AskReddit,fe0v9sw,t1_fe0d0tg,1578819125.0,"Yeah, I miss that guy. He lived the hardass drill instructor persona in most things he did after Full Metal Jacket but was apparently a very kind person IRL from what I have read."

dataisbeautiful,fdnr2z7,t1_fdn2703,1578591188.0,"Not necessarily. It could also be the data is challenging the statement that the president is the hardest working.

Edit: reworded for clarity"
MurderedByWords,fdnpegn,t1_fdn8925,1578590389.0,It’s not just politicians. Anyone who drives can vouch for how many people out there think they are special and laws are really just suggestions.
EarthPorn,fdn7y1e,t3_em7kc7,1578579721.0,"I am sure everyone will downvote this to hell, but it sure looks like a composite image to me."
AskReddit,fdmnmge,t1_fdm1sms,1578556977.0,It brings to mind the adage that says something like “He who protests loudest has much to hide”. Maybe your parents were swingers?
halo,fdj90d4,t1_fdiec9j,1578461931.0,It looks like a slightly tweaked version of 2fort from the original Team Fortress days.
BeAmazed,fdj6sul,t1_fdixgzf,1578460058.0,No. Matthew Modine from Full Metal Jacket.

politics,fdfypu0,t3_el1g9s,1578373982.0,"“for-profit immigrant detention center”.

That pretty much sums up everything that is wrong with how immigrants are being handled. So basically these are the *other* brown people prison’s."

worldnews,fcxdavy,t1_fcxc41z,1578059845.0,"Don’t, please don’t. Else the zealots will get their self-fulfilled prophecy of Armagedon. It is so obviously a fiction that they want to be real and it sure seems like they will stop at nothing to bring that fantasy to life."
synology,fcvoihn,t1_fcuawwp,1578006552.0,"Yes it should be, but the world we live in is dumbed down and getting dumber every year. Take a look at any major current OS and then compare that to an OS from ten years ago. The options available to users are much simpler and limited and any complex configuration often requires command line knowledge where it did not in the past. Rather than educating users on how to work with complex systems, systems are being made less complex to appeal to a larger market share. Synology is no exception. What is common sense to most of us isn't to a larger and larger user base as time goes on. Putting out this warning hurts nobody. Criticizing this warning just makes people sound like all the elitists that plagued Linux forums years ago. Nobody likes to hear """"I told you so"" or ""I can't believe you didn't know that""."

Dell,fcshflb,t3_eig8nk,1577916606.0,That is basically the first thing I did when I bought my XPS 9560 and my wife's XPS 9360 after each had problems with the full signal wi-fi dropping was to replace the Killer cards with Intel's. Very inexpensive upgrade and we have had no problems with either since.

politics,fcr01bg,t1_fcqylop,1577894773.0,Wow. American freedom just seems like a shadow of an idea that was never fully realized. I feel like we are all now just livestock for the wealthy to exploit. Sad.

funny,fcke6vr,t1_fck93it,1577723330.0,"I remember ashtrays in restaurants, malls, hospital waiting rooms, pretty much everywhere. It wasn’t until the mid 1980’s that restaurants where I lived started segregating smokers in their own section. It seems so weird now that they don’t ask you when you dine out if you want to sit in smoking or non-smoking even though I haven’t been asked in 15-20 years."
mildlyinteresting,fcbnpaw,t1_fcaadg0,1577588946.0,Not in America obviously as the tree wasn’t cut down to make room for the fence.
