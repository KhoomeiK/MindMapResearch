I was dating this girl for a few months and just fell head over heels - so much that I had her name tattooed on my penis. When I had an erection it said “WENDY”. When flaccid it just said “WY”. 


Yeah dumb, because soon after, Wendy left me and broke my heart, so rather than kill myself i I went on a vacation to Jamaica to try and forget her. You know just going to bars and getting plastered. One day I’m at a bar and have to piss, so I go to the bathroom. I’m standing at the urinal, and this huge black Jamaican dude walks up to the one next to me and unzips. I’m kinda drunk and can’t help but sort of lean over to peak at the guys dick, just outa curiosity. 


To my astonishment, his member also says WY!!! So I say, excuse me sir...is your girlfriend’s name Wendy? He looks at my dick and just laughs that hearty Jamaican laugh and says “No, mine says ‘Welcome to Jamaica mahn, have a nice day’!!!”"

So save that 20%! Put it in a super low cost index fund like the Vanguard S&P 500. DO NOT TOUCH IT EVER.  By the time you’re 40 you will have lots of choices in life, including the choice to walk away from a bad situation. 


Also, get a degree in something that will pay for itself in earnings potential. By the time you’re in your 30s-40s it can easily double if not triple your income."

I did something like this 10 years ago.

I call it the “trailing spouse syndrome”. Spouse goes along with the move, but it turns out to be super mentally taxing, especially with little kids.  And since it’s usually the husband that’s being moved, the wife is stuck at the new home with the kids, with no friends, no support, no way to get around. Very hard and not to be underestimated. I’ve seen more than one divorce caused by this - even moves within the country. My wife is actually very easy going and I was surprised at how difficult it was for her at first.
