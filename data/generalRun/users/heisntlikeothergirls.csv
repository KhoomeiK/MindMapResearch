Best way out is to be a ""nest""....work on creating a mental and emotional ""environment"" people find healthy. They come.back not out of pity but out of balanced living - no manipulation, no fear....they want more of what you have. YOU become the force in their lives for good, can offer something, the one who makes people smile and feel safer when you arrive
