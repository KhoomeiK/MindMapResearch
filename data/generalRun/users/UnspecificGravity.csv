AmItheAsshole,ffs12du,t1_ffr7gou,1580170551.0,"I feel like being in a relationship where the other party is actively planning for you to be dead soon is a situation worthy of some panic.

Double down on that when you are about to give birth and that person is going to be in charge of your medical decisions if you are incapacitated."

TopMindsOfReddit,ffryr1n,t1_ffr8u6m,1580168975.0,"They were always there, we just decide to amplify the dumb shit they say because someone out there needs a reminder us that they are better than them."
gallifrey,ffry3hv,t1_ffrvook,1580168529.0,What did they do?
gallifrey,ffrumtv,t1_ffro5pj,1580166200.0,Right? And then they brought them back half a dozen times since then.
LeopardsAteMyFace,ffrsm3g,t1_ffr5gen,1580164913.0,Kinda interesting to note that he had started acting before the crash and if you watch his performances before and after there does appear to be a pretty significant difference.
gallifrey,ffroo9c,t1_ffq3igl,1580162429.0,"It also taught me that she wasn't a heroic activist deliberately facing unknown consequences in the name of people who couldn't fight for themselves, she was just some lady that wanted a seat on the bus."
gallifrey,ffro50i,t1_ffnv1fo,1580162100.0,I think the fanbase is starting to get pretty anxious about this show.
gallifrey,ffrmnnd,t1_ffpl2zi,1580161202.0,"To be fair, a lot of folks are of the opinion that what you are catching up on is the high water mark for new Dr Who. I am not completely sold on that yet, but it doesn't sound insane to me."
gallifrey,ffrm29j,t1_ffrlele,1580160843.0,"He is kinda missing an important element though. We all decide what we watch. The people ARE the only ones that ultimately decide the fate of any show. If their dollars go a different direction then this show doesn't happen.

This show absolutely can fuck up big enough that people stop watching, and then the show is done. No one is going to pay for an expensive shows that doesn't bring in any viewers. RTD and Chipnal can complain all they want about it, but ultimately no fans means no show."
UnresolvedMysteries,ffrl7i8,t1_ffr3let,1580160323.0,"Before you take the time to make more serious replies to this poster, you should go to the main page of his first source to see what kind of person you are dealing with here."
UnresolvedMysteries,ffrl5dk,t1_ffqiosx,1580160285.0,"No, they did not."
politics,ffrjt55,t1_ffqzt8j,1580159476.0,Id be interested to see if they can find 51 republicans to vote against letting John Bolton testify.
politics,ffrjogt,t1_ffqr04j,1580159396.0,Kinda seems reasonable that if a judge is asked to preside over something that they are indeed being given the role of a judge over that activity.
gallifrey,ffre4jo,t1_ffr8x1k,1580156223.0,"It is what people want to believe. That somehow their opinion matters in the sense that it can influence the show.

There is room for small changes here and there based on feedback, but the overall story arcs are mapped out long before anyone sees the first episode."
gallifrey,ffr4xrc,t1_ffpxf4x,1580150543.0,"That's the thing with me too.

Doctor who isn't really dependant on canon, and it's not a huge deal to me IN GENERAL. But Chibnal isn't the guy who gets to mess around with the good work that came before."
gallifrey,ffr3vzh,t1_ffpqpxs,1580149894.0,I don't think they even give you the job if you can't give the BBC a roadmap. That's the first thing I would of ask a candidate for that job.
politics,ffr2sjj,t1_ffqztrc,1580149211.0,"Right, but the only outcome of an impeachment trial is being removed from office. That means that the removal is what cannot be pardoned. The underlying crimes would have to be prosecuted in a regular federal court, and I think would be subject to the pardon."
politics,ffqw4j7,t1_ffp9zf7,1580144983.0,"My personal theory:

Bolton HIMSELF leaked this information to Nancy and Chuck so that they would pump the brakes long enough so that this information would come out during the trial.

That really helps the impeachment effort. It also makes sense because it would ALSO seriously pump the sales of this book, which is undoubtedly what Bolton was going for."
gallifrey,ffqt763,t1_ffqi0z0,1580143085.0,"Seriously, enough of this kind of bullshit."
gallifrey,ffqszq7,t1_ffnslt7,1580142948.0,"Unfortunately we are probably going to get some bullshit Doctor Who is basically Jesus malarkey by a reveal that they are somehow so magical and special that none of the (very limited) established rules for the universe apply anymore.

You are already thinking in a level that seems unaccessible for the current show."
Documentaries,ffqhe32,t1_ffq611f,1580134653.0,"Same reason they don't ""celebrate"" holidays. It's hard to run a cult when your members get Thanksgiving weekend to get deprogrammed by their families."
worldnews,ffol5rb,t1_ffnew8b,1580078819.0,So it would be like a big outbreak in Chicago or Atlanta a few days before Thanksgiving.
news,ffnpqa1,t1_ffnmqr1,1580069071.0,"The number if people that are defined as ""celebrities"" has expanded dramatically over the years, so this is going to remain increasingly common."
books,ffnea26,t1_ffkoml5,1580064815.0,"You think that's cheap? They will give you all the books you want FOR FREE. Man, it's going to be crazy when people figure out this loophole. I don't know how they are going to stay in business just giving away product like that."
todayilearned,ffn7smr,t1_ffmir4a,1580062913.0,A fun game to play at a job you don't really like us to try and find out exactly where the performance standard is and how good they are at measuring it. You can probably distill your job down to a surprisingly small number of duties.
todayilearned,ffn62df,t1_ffm0bwb,1580062418.0,"Right, but the cost if the space is easily quantified. The lost productivity is fuzzier, so therefore unimportant.

If a manager can't deliver a metric for it, they aren't doing it."
todayilearned,ffn5t4h,t1_ffn31gi,1580062324.0,A lot of companies have figured this out. The cost of a fully stocked fridge is negligible compared to the cost of your whole workforce leaving for an hour to get lunch or going home an hour earlier.
todayilearned,ffn4aht,t1_ffmp8wk,1580061924.0,Absolutely this. I get way more space at home than at work because my family actually cares about my preference to have time to work. My coworkers don't.
todayilearned,ffn3sgp,t1_ffmar2t,1580061741.0,It's been really been about anything but maximizing output and minimizing costs. They have been pilling workers into I've big room for centuries because it's cheap and people work harder when they are being watched all the time. The change is that grown up professionals have stopped demanding better working conditions and there aren't really any unions out there trying to get something better. This won't change anytime soon.
LifeProTips,ffiihjl,t1_fffruzf,1579974662.0,"George Foreman has 12 children. Five of them are boys. All five are named ""George Foreman""."
space,ffh1jy2,t1_ffgcs6h,1579920632.0,Since it's imaginary anyways it doesn't really matter.
TwoXChromosomes,ffh1a9h,t3_ete3o4,1579920431.0,"Issue a complaint about that gyno, that shit isn't acceptable."
politics,ffh0frp,t1_ffgx1zb,1579919783.0,I was talking about his radio program back when it was popular.
McMansionHell,ffgwnus,t1_ffgud0k,1579916961.0,That's a bit of a stereotype really. Plenty of gays are pretty masculine.
