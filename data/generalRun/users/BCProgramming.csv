I believe you may have been misinformed, as I cannot find any information to substantiate this claim, and the reaction profiles I can find for Isopropyl Alcohol would seem to contradict it. According to those, It neither catalyzes oxidization nor oxidizes most metals, with Aluminum being the main exception (in the presence of Mercury, presumably related to the amalgam) It's lack of metallic reactions with conductive metals is why it is often sold as an Electronics Cleaner. It also doesn't react with most plastics, Polyvinyl butyral being the main exception.

>and pcbs aren't plastic, they're fiberglass.

The substrate is often fiberglass. But the substrate is beneath the impermeable solder mask, which is a polymer epoxy/plastic, so would be more relevant in terms of reactivity.

> In addition, the adulterants in otc ipa will leave mineral residue on evaporation. 

Very seldom are there unlisted ingredients other than Water and Isopropyl alcohol. Those that do contain additional ingredients will usually have it clearly indicated on the label what those adulterants are, as those are usually intended as a selling point for their intended purpose. Obviously, those would be poor choices for using on electronics. Occasionally even in the unadulterated cases the water used will have Calcium Carbonate dissolved which will be left behind as a residue when the alcohol evaporates, though it tends to be harmless; It's also rather uncommon as distilled water tends to be used even for over the counter preparations. There can also be reactions with any leftover flux on the board from the isopropyl itself, leaving behind residue as well, which tend to be alcohol salts which do not have any deleterious effects. 99% Isopropyl Alcohol is sold as an electronics cleaner. IPA is often found in other contact cleaners as well.

With regards to your later comment, which alludes to manufacturers advising against the use of Alcohol for cleaning, I can't find any recent/modern manufacturer information that advises against it. The main manufacturer that I can find that explicitly advised against the use of Alcohol has been Nintendo, where it was discouraged right on the back of NES cartridges. SNES cartridges were less explicit, and suggested they needed to be cleaned regularly, and insisted that they only be cleaned with the official cleaning kit.

However, the official cleaning kit for the NES as well as the SNES used Isopropyl Alcohol for the cleaning solution, so it seems that they didn't follow their own advice."

Plastic yellows due to parts of the polymer being UV reactive. The butadiene breaks down into carbonyl radicals which subsequently form chromatic molecules that discolor the plastic. ""Bromine"" is never added to any plastics; Brominated Flame retardants are, but referring to tetrabromobisphenol-A as Bromine is as accurate as calling Salt Chlorine.

Neither Bromine or Tetrabromobisphenol-A react to UV light.

>As far as brittle, I've heard that rumor too

It's not a rumour. It's chemistry. Plastic is not a magic; it's fairly well understood and there are many papers written regarding different ways that plastics decompose or deteriorate.

For ABS plastic as noted the Butadiene polymer is itself photo-reactive, so will breakdown. That ""breaks the chain"" of the overall molecule. Plastic is plastic largely due to it having long polymer chains. As more and more of those molecules are made shorter, the plastic becomes brittle and ""crumbly"".

""retrobrite"" is trash. People constantly tell others to use ""retrobrite"" on yellowed plastics but they don't even understand what it does, since if they did they would probably never recommend it. retrobrite, is pretty much hydrogen peroxide, an oxidizer. It encourages the chromatic molecules that discolour the plastic to oxidize into simpler, colourless compounds. 

It also greatly accelerates the original reaction, since now the butadiene is being encouraged to oxidize by an oxidizer, not to mention ""treatment"" has the plastic being left out in bright sunlight. Of course the products from that reaction are readily oxidized. 

It also destroys any UV stabilizers or absorbers in the plastic. These have been added pretty much since ABS plastic was discovered entirely because the butadiene is known to be photoreactive. These compounds are intended to effectively work as bodyguards- they either absorb the moment energy or they reflect it so that the polymer can remain intact for much longer. Destroying them means the plastic will react much more readily on UV exposure."

(The interactive Mario head at startup *was* written in C++, mind, though I doubt the video creator was aware of that)

As to ""Nintendo's big mistake""- I don't buy it. it's possible, but I question the methodology that reached the conclusion. Basically, people decompiled Mario 64, then they were able to recompile it with optimizations. So, Nintendo forgot the optimizations.

But I don't think that holds. The N64 SDK used GCC for compilation, as part of MIPSE. I did a bit of searching and from what I can find, proper support for the optimizing compiler was added for the MIPS architecture in GCC 2.7.2.2, which was released January of 1997. Pretty damned coincidental timing if you ask me, given the Japanese and U.S releases of Mario 64 therefore used an earlier version, and therefore had no or very limited optimizing compiler support. 

A lot of these discoveries are based on discoveries in the Master Quest debug ROM. references to the compiler, ""IRIS Development Option 5.3"" were found.

I'm skeptical that indicates that it was built with that compiler, though; it's possible the code merely has references to it as it was used for actual debugging on IRIX workstations, and the text constants were left in the builds targeted for the N64.

regardless of that fact, though, that Compiler would be nearly 2 years newer than whatever was used for Mario 64; It doesn't seem that an assumption that it used the same compiler is sensible in any case."

You need new staff training with a new system, a shitload of man-hours to do data entry because it's doubtful the devs of some fancy new product would know what ISAM tables are let alone have any plans for migration. The costs of almost any upgrade would be far in excess of any software price tag, and at the end if we're talking about software they've had for decades with customizations, there is a good chance other software will be missing features.

I disagree. I'd actually argue the opposite.

>We used to have scroll bars because some mice didn’t have scroll wheels and computers were new.

Scrollbars were prevalent before Graphical interfaces were in home computers. They were found in text-based software as a way of (roughly!) indicating the position being displayed within a larger block. in Environments with a mouse of course you could move the scroll using the mouse too.

IMO, content which is expected to contain more than fits on screen should always display a scrollbar. *even if that content is not currently larger than the screen*. That way you know that A) The content can be scrollable and B) it is currently not scrollable. Additionally, scrollbars which shrink from their ""interactable"" expanded form to a smaller ""read-only"" form I'd argue are poor design because now the interaction has less visibility; and it's also not consistent- it looks different based on recent passive user activity. And now in order to change it into the ""interactable"" version, you need to hover over it- which increases the cognitive load.

Designing for a desktop User interface is not the same as for a smart device. A Smartphone's primary interaction is the touch-screen so an interactable scrollbar is redundant, since scrolling actions can be done by swiping or dragging. This means they just need to be for display. 

That doesn't apply to desktop systems, however, and attempting to adopt those same designs is bad design IMO."

ABS plastic discolours because the polymer itself breaks down. The butadiene component of the Polymer is photocatalyzed into carbonyl radicals which form chromatic molecules that accumulate and give the yellow tint.

""retrobrite"" Came up as this kind of magical cure. The original postings were a bunch of worthless chemistry gibberish. My favourite was how ""ABS plastics chemical properties are not well understood"". Or the now oft-repeated bullshit about how the discolouration is due to ""flame retardants""...

hydrogen peroxide is an oxidizer. It encourages oxidization. The reason it removes the discolouration is because it encourages those chromatic molecules to themselves break down into colourless compounds. 

However recall that the original discolouration was caused by oxidization. That reaction is greatly accelerated during ""treatment"", It's just the products of that reaction are themselves oxidized. 

If discolouration was the only effect of the polymer breaking down, this would be merely a curiousity. Bit the polymer molecules are what gives the plastics it's strength. The breakdown of those polymers is what results in the plastic becoming brittle, not just the discolouration, and ""treatment"" greatly accelerates this reaction. retrobrite does absolutely nothing to ""reintegrate"" the polymer. It just washes away the molecular debris.

Additionally, ABS plastics, especially for consumer use, have UV stabiliser and absorber compounds in the plastic, these are designed to reduce the rate at which the breakdown occurs. (This is why discolouration can occur at different rates on different plastics of the same device). Using ""retrobrite"" destroys these compounds, so they *will* discolour more quickly."

The metallic reflective layer uses aluminum, and that will readily oxidize if it is exposed to oxygen.

Those scratches we are avoiding getting on the bottom of the disc are just going on the top.

That's right. ou. See, for all they might claim about is speaking incorrectly, they are such poor spellers they had to create a new language from their spelling mistakes. Common among this is losing ou.

So, when Americans see ""about"" it is a difficult word for them to translate to speech. it's like a unilingual French person and the ""th"" sound. it's confusing, and strange. And perhaps, a little bit scary to them, And when they see it, perhaps, for a short time, their world stops making sense. 

Remember that for Americans, making fun of us Canadians for saying ""about"" or various other words wrong is just their way of coping with a flimsy house of cards that their education system built for them, all under the pretense of teaching them ""English"". They need the outlet. They live in a confusing world; one they had isolated themselves within. For years, they heard tales of unusual peoples living outside their borders, with strange words and ways of speaking. These mythologies- these legends, if you will, suddenly became more real when the Internet appeared, exposing innocent Americans to things like ""zed"", ou, and even strange, scary words like ""cheque"", and ""celsius"". And for decades they have attempted to understand the strange, frightening world around them, ans they find these astonishing differences prevalent along countries of the world. Why, there are even areas in Canada itself where many people refuse to speak English, instead using another language altogether, like Newfoundland. 

If Canadians need to occasionally hear from Americans how they speak incorrectly, perhaps it is a small price to pay to help re-integrate them with the rest of humanity, providing a conduit by which they can communicate with other people, by providing interpreters capable of understanding both English and American."

nintendo,fejckj0,t3_epfemw,1579167260.0,"Nintendo sells their games for full price because people are willing to purchase the games at full price.

Frankly, that's the only reason any software gets sold- the price's aren't selected based on the work that went into it, it's sold based on the amount that customers are expected to pay, and they attempt to maximize the revenue. over a particular period.

Both Nintendo and other companies will occasionally drop prices for some games. (Less so Nintendo in general, Mind) But don't fool yourself into thinking that Uncharted 4 sells for $10-$20 because Sony is a Santa Claus of corporate benevolence; they had marketing reasons for selecting that price point and estimated revenue was one of those concerns, paired with others like how much it would cost for the warehouse space to hold them if they didn't sell, having to buy back stock if their Cost was too high for retailers to be able to shift stock quickly enough, etc.

Nintendo considers all those same factors, but comes to a different decision. maybe they own the warehouses so there is no additional cost associated directly with overstock. Maybe Retailers are less likely to return their purchase orders for Nintendo content knowing that they tend to keep their value or even increase after some time, So Nintendo doesn't have to be concerned about the cost of buying back stock. I don't have the numbers- but the people at Nintendo making these pricing decisions do. And the price points are chosen for a reason.

Hell, the price of Doom on the Switch isn't even really Nintendo's decision. Bethesda apparently came to the same conclusion as Nintendo and decided people would pay more just because it was on Nintendo hardware. Fact is, they were *right* because loads of people bought the game.

For the most part people who have Nintendo consoles and games are willing to spend more on their games. Whether that is a wise, or justified decision is a completely separate matter, of course, but Nintendo knows this and as a corporation they will price their product accordingly."

The idea that end-user consumer PCs become ""zombies"" or get infected because the OS has stopped receiving security updates is nonsense. Security vulnerabilities are largely used in targeted attacks, and only occasionally used as part of any ""in the wild"" malware infection vector; and even then, it's never the primary vector, Because it's not really worth that effort from the perspective of a malware author to use it as a primary infection vector. Why go to the trouble to exploit security vulnerabilities? Like, sure, you *could* spend ages researching vulnerabilities and implementing exploits to utilize them as an attack vector- or you can just call your malware ""fun screensaver.exe"" and let people infect themselves.

Over the last few decades most malware has gone from trying to utilize weaknesses in OS security to infect a system to exploiting users. Users are a lot easier to trick.

I mean, fuck- I've seen people post arbitrary executables claiming it installs a ""new theme"". People say ""Oh it is flagged by my AV"" and the rando who posts it can just say ""oh that is a false positive"" and they'll disable their AV and run the program.

But for Consumer systems it's largely nonconsequential.

1. Very few of the exploits are actually applicable to consumer systems. Privilege escalation exploits in RDP sound scary until you consider RDP Server isn't in Windows 10 Home and even on pro, that means you've got to basically port forward RDP to the wider internet and create a limited user account with a weak password.

2. Those that do apply to consumer systems are hardly worth the trouble to those who create malware.

Why go to all the trouble to write code exploiting security vulnerabilities that may or may not work based on particular configurations or could be patched when instead of focusing on vulnerable *systems* you can instead focus on vulnerable *users*. Too many people can be easily tricked to run executables, disable their AV, and even run it as admin and then if appears to do nothing they go ""oh well!"" and ignorantly go about their business as if programs doing nothing is something totally expected. From the perspective of malware authors, that would be analogous to an attacking army coming up with a sophisticated sapping technique to workaround the defenses of a castle, when you could just walk up to the front gate with your army and say you may look like an army but you are just a false positive, btw give us the key to the keep"" and they do. 

>but don’t forget that you are putting the rest of the online community at risk by potentially giving criminals a platform – in the form of your compromised Windows 7 PC

Not really relevant. Security exploits hardly change this simply because they aren't the most common infection vector. Trojans are, across the board. People largely infect their own PCs; they run some shady program, it does nothing, and they forget about it; months later their PC is acting weird, but because they are missing a security patch they, or some tech decides that must be how they got infected. It's fucking ridiculous. Fact is the OS you are using and the state of it's security patches is less important on a Home, end user PC to security than how the user uses it as well as their technical competence; But we, in the sense of the technology community at large, seem to be doing very little to fix this absolute dearth in education. 


It seems to me that there are many people who have a lot to gain by keeping end-users scared about security and the threat of ""hackers"" getting into their PC. Software Firewall and AV companies in particular, as enterprise deployments usually aren't enough to meet their bloated payroll.

I started thinking about this back in 2006. Win32.Virut was able to utilize vulnerabilities in every single AV vendor's scanning engine which allowed arbitrary code execution that allowed it to, by merely being scanned, infect the AV software. From there it could basically own the system because it had *FUCKING RING 0 ACCESS* to the god damned system. And consumers wouldn't even know because the infected AV would report a clean bill of health.

The AV vendors silently patched the problem. There was no ""security advisory"" issued by any of them; none that was made widely public.

I wonder why that might be? I'm sure it is only a coincidence that such an announcement that the fundamental security software that frightened users have come to depend upon to protect them from the scarey internet boogeymen being themselves almost trivially exploited and used by those same boogeymen would result in a massive loss of trust of AV and security software in general.

This same ""upgrade to a new version or a scarey boogeyman will get you"" narrative was all over the place as April 2014 approached. Did April 2014 spell ""Doomsday"" for Windows XP? Did systems start to get unavoidably infected after getting connected to the Internet as scary hacker boogeymen somehow compromised Consumer XP systems through conventional NAT routers? Nope. I still have some systems running Windows XP (Pentium 4 and a Pentium M-based system) . They aren't infected despite being connected to the Internet."

You wouldn't expect people to start a first date with ""Hi, I'm Veronica, and this is my colostomy bag"" or ""Hello, I'm Steve, I have a micropenis the size of a clitoris"" or ""Nice to meet you, I'm Sheri, I have a birth defect which means my vagina is sealed up and unusable.

Generally speaking, People are far more invested in a relationship later on, and things that could have had them give up or ghost earlier, they are more likely to work towards keeping it intact later, and maybe even rethink things that they might otherwise not have.

And that is probably the same fundamental premise behind Trans individuals not revealing it, because like any number of other uncomfortable facts that can be deal breakers, it never seems quite the right time. ""Things are going so well, and maybe this isn't the best time to talk about my tiny micropenis"". ""3rd date? Well, I really should tell him that my vagina is completely unusable, but we are having such a nice time I don't want to ruin it"" and before you know it, and without even thinking, you are in the bedroom. ""What is this? A colostomy bag?"" ""I Was going to tell you I swear""

So we have to ask ourselves, what makes the situation different with trans individuals? The way I figure it, there isn't a sort of ""denial"" movement trying to basically wipe them from existence. Nobody goes ""There is only one asshole!"" and talking about the biological truths of how Stoma's are mutilation.  A man doesn't learn a woman has a genital defect that makes her vagina unusable and start beating the shit out of her and possibly murdering her for ""tricking"" him into thinking she had a usable one.

And yet, when some men learn their partners are actually trans, for some reason, they assault or even murder them. Maybe trans people decide that their partner will be OK with it, probably. And convince themselves it's not a big deal, because they don't want to lose them? I can at least understand that. And before you know it there isn't really any ""lead time"" left. to try to bring it up."
