TrueOffMyChest,ff1y2qs,t1_ff14rql,1579488813.0,My son got a pink dress shirt as a gift once and ill admit I was a little nervous letting him wear it. He loved that and wanted to wear it everywhere. I told my husband I just wasn't sure if I should let him wear it out. Next morning hubby got up and dressed him in his pink shirt and told me they would be back. He came home wearing a pink dress shirt with a purple tie. Just imagine this burly construction worker in a pink shirt with a purple tie. He said now let someone say something. From then on anytime we went to town they wore their pink shirts. I loved that man.

AmItheAsshole,fe4rnnh,t1_fe39oqq,1578862159.0,I agree. I take numerous meds as well as injections for Rheumatoid Arthritis. It's no one's business if you take meds or why. I would have simply ignored it or at least asked if op was ok. Not interrogate her about what she's taking and why. NTA
