Besides, KDP wasn't neo-Nazi, so even if we are to believe that Three Arrows would associate themselves with the KDP-ran Antifa (a shaky claim at best) he still wouldn't be a Neo-Nazi.

So I'll give you a thought experiment: let's say that Labour party does have an antisemitism problem. I personally don't really think so but for the sake of argument let's go with it.

The Polish government clutched pearls hard at the mention of that. Accusing Poland of systemically engaging in the Holocaust in any way is a big crock of horseshit though of course, and being angry about that I agree with. 

Also the independence day marches have been far right riots for as long as I remember. Probably not Nazi, but certainly with Fascist tendencies."

Edit: the user's followup comment was sadly deleted, but equated to a weird argument that Antifa was created to fight Three Arrows movement. This was my response:

""What? Even in your own quote Three Arrows was clearly made to fight Antifascist Action, not the other way around.

Besides, KDP wasn't neo-Nazi, so even if we are to believe that Three Arrows would associate themselves with the KDP-ran Antifa (a shaky claim at best) he still wouldn't be a Neo-Nazi. He'd be a Communist, likely Stalinist in specific. However he's shown home to be much closer aligned with the actual Three Arrows movement- again, not Nazi.

It's especially funny because in this equation, no matter which you choose as the basis of your claim, he's still not a Nazi, _whilst we're talking about Germany and actual Nazis_."""
