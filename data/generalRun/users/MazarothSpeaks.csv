Simply put look at modern games. Its just a visual simulation. Look at Elon Musk and how he talks about it. You simplify the calculation at the point of perception to save processing power. You only add details that have a chance to be observed.

Think of quantum physics double slit experiment. Light is both a particle (pixel) and a wave (vector) the particle only appears when observed or (texture map)...

I think that we can never know anything for certain but the simulation hypothesis seems to be the most inclusive paradigm when it comes to explaining both simultaneously.

Its hard to accept both simultaneously but evidence for both exists. Look at a moebius strip for example. You can keep walking and end up back where you started. If everything was part of a persistent illusion than one doesn't have to manipulate reality, just the perception of it.

The idea then gives us the possibility to modify the rules of the simulation rather than actual reality. If we have more of a chance of being in a simulation than not, than I'm betting on this resource saving workaround in programming explaining BOTH observations within the framework of a simulation."

Asking questions helps me understand your position but you seem far too upset, more so than myself.

If anything you sound like you need to sort out more than me because specializing in one field of knowledge and claiming a preference for animals over people seems more like an anti-social disorder. You have beaten people over the head in comment sections all over reddit, for what?

You don't seem any happier doing so, obviously. That's what I mean by sorting yourself out.

Animals don't talk back, people do.

It's not so much more than a conversation but you levy insults and a superior attitude over what amounts to little more than a spare time pursuit.

I feel that the welfare of the homeless should be supported along with the animal they care for instead of stripping them away traumatically to the possible detriment of both.

I'm not a vet, but it just seems like common sense that if the animal is a breed that can survive outdoors and the homeless party can reasonably care for the animal that separation should not occur.

So why are you so fired up and insulting about it?"

Poorly-bred thank you for the correction. Turning a conversational debate into a god complex is a bit much.

We are in a boring dystopia because we are causing a lot of our own problems using technological methods as a way to prey on our environment and the people in it instead of utilizing more ethical policies and means to solve our problems for short sighted financial gain.

Animals are supposed to live outside. If a person living outside bonds with a stray, taking care of that stray effectively is challenging but not impossible.

I believe that since we all live on this planet together that the needs of humans and animals are both important and both should be cared for because we are collectively indivisible from our environment.
