Using one or two much larger birds will help it look meatier and easier to see. It's also important to keep away from (1) single color logos when you can add different effective shades or hues, (2) primary or 'straight' colors like pure red, pure green, or pure blue when off-red/blue/green is available, and (3) a single font style throughout. For fonts, either use a bold/non-bold pair or a combo of soft and hard fonts like a script and a thick sans. Don't use more than 2 styles."

Showerthoughts,fcmdeti,t3_ehs4f3,1577771308.0,"My family has, for all of my conscious memory, had a ""lucky"" spoon that is purported to bring good fortune to the user. It has a very serious and in-depth history/mechanics.

It is just a normal spoon from our silverware set, but once upon a memory it was caught in the garbage disposal and got a bend stuck in it (a sorta hump/curve that disrupts the straight handle).

1. For the luck to work, you have to receive/obtain the spoon by chance. This can either be from someone setting the table and you sitting at the right spot, or you picking the lucky spoon from the top of the stack naturally. You may not hunt it out from within the stack. It must be by chance.

2. You must balance the spoon before luck is dispensed. You can do this on the edge of a bowl or cup. You balance it by sticking the hump over the rim. The spoon is perfectly weighted so that it is able to balance where the hump is (coincidence?)."
