I agree it's not hard to tell them you want the ice cream and not the show but if I was in a situation like this and neither me or the other guy could communicate well I'd have to put up with as another person said ""20 seconds of sleight of hand.""

Edit: I'm not trying to excuse the actions of the guy in the video, just pointing out that some people, myself included might not be able to communicate with the vendor in the video so we wouldn't be able to tell them we don't want the entertainment, just the ice cream. As for finding a normal ice cream shop, I still wouldn't be able to read the signs because I don't know the language."

I'm not going to be enraged like others or say you should divorce him, just try to go to counseling with him and try to work things out because I'm not an expert when it comes to relationships like this, you are a very kind person though and I wish you the best going forward in life."
