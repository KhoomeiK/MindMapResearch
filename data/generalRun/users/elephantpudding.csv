There is a fucking sub for this, r/ffxivart/, but the crappy mods here think they should keep these here, for the desperate attempt of keeping the post number up while not realizing they're just shitposts. They won't change the policy for this reason, the mods here don't care about the community, simply the click/post rate. I bet half of them haven't played FFXIV in a year or more. Some of them have probably never played it.

Keep in mind, that as an adult you'll be far more aware of Lewis' angle in the books, in the form of Christian apologetics. But, you should not let that get in any way of your enjoyment. Many of the things that happen in the books are in fact just Christian mythology with animals, Lewis was very much a defender of the truth of Miracles."
