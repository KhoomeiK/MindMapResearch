seriouseats,fe2yrd5,t1_fe2tsr4,1578844332.0,"At least from the Costco I go to, they sell beef subjected to jaccard-style tenderizing. Basically a bunch of wide needles get stabbed through the meat repeatedly. For a whole, non-stabbed piece of beef to be considered “safe” for those with compromised immune systems, all that needs to happen is that the outside surfaces are pasteurized (requires a certain time at any given temperature). That’s because the interior of a piece of properly-handled beef is considered to be practically sterile for all intents and purposes. This is unlike the stabbed piece of beef where the microbes on the outside surfaces can be brought into the interior of the beef, making it so that the entirety of the piece must be pasteurized if it is to become “safe” (same definition as above).

Of course, if the meat has not been mechanically tenderized in that fashion, then there’s no need to worry. The label should indicate if it has been.

As for pasteurization, well, it can happen in 1 second at ~160-165 F, or over an hour at 130F. I’d have to look up the time-temp curves again to be sure. Note also that it can take a significant period of time for the meat just to get up to temperature as well."
