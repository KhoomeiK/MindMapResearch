CODZombies,ff96p62,t3_esb4ik,1579706124.0,"This is something ive wanted since black ops, and have actually put a lot of thought into it, though i know they would never do it. It would be so good, a campaign based around zombies, like a real Aether story, and then the zombies mode would be a huge mode compared to what it is now, since the game is based fully around zombies, and then they could even have regular multiplayer and turn sections of some zombie maps into mp maps. Like theres so much you could do and make a dope ass game that i think would still sell quite a bit, especially if you still had a full multiplayer mode, that just had extra game modes and shit based around zombies, maybe even some l4d style stuff"

FloridaMan,fej20q5,t1_feixr5p,1579154004.0,"It doesnt work like that though. If you steal something, the type of charge can change by how much the item stolen is worth. But that worth is subjective. If you steal an item at walmart thats listed at 30 dollars, you will get hit with a theft under 50 charge, but if its listed at 65 at target and thats where you steal it, you will get theft between 50 and 500. Of course these laws vary but you should get the point there. Use that same ideology alongside how insurance deals with these situations. Youre right, walmart probably didnt spend more or even at whatever they are selling an item for, but that potential money that could have went towards a sale is still technically a loss, even if they didnt really ""lose"" that money. Walmart doesnt buy something for 5 dollars to sell it for five. Say they buy something for 5 and it gets listed at 10. If you steal it, thats a 10 dollar loss for them because while they only spent 5 on it, the whole point was to make that other 5 off of it. So instead of making 100 percent profit, they lost 100 percent of the investment. Thats a 200 percent difference in what should have happened. And if the guy had the capital, it would definitely make sense for him to target the higher end PCs they have available, as the hardware you pull out of those is going to get you more money. But yea, these definitely weremt alienware computers. Walmart has $1000+ computers, though, and like other people have stated, they cant sell them when they are gutted. They are stuck either paying even more money to get the thing in a condition that it can be sold, or, as we see here, mark it as dead for insurance and get what you should have gotten for the item. Thats why they have that insurance. Fuck walmart, but thy arent exactly doing anything uncommon or wrong by having the computers covered at what they have them listed for"

apexlegends,feelv6q,t1_feekicd,1579036387.0,"I dont think pathfinder solely needs to be buffed though. Gibralter is without a doubt the most stacked player when it comes to abilities and perks. I think all legends should start getting extra stuff too. Gibby has the dome shield, gun shield, faster revive speed and heal speed under his dome, mortar drops, which is quite damaging, 15% dmg reduction and not slowable by bullets. Pathfinder can scan beacons, grapple, and pop a zipline, and takes 5% more dmg. He is just the example I used. It went from each legend having a passive, a tactical, and an ultimate, to where now some have basically 5 passives, 1 tactical, and 1 ultimate, where some still have 1 in each. For a support character, theres not a lot you can do to support your team as pathfinder other than ziplining and showing the next ring, which while useful, is not as useful as something like bonus revive speed or better heal speed for teammates, which a defense character has both of those on top of their regular defense capabilities. Yes you can do things no other player can as pathfinder, but i think when it comes to supporting your team, he is lacking. Should be a recon character if anything, but I still think he could go with an extra passive ability that assists your team more directly. Thats all. I dont think he needs some crazy buff to do more damage or take less or some ability thats over powered. Just something more to support the team"
apexlegends,feejim3,t1_feeigwf,1579035021.0,I am actually. Compared to gibby he has nothing going for him other than a grapple. Woohoo

Food meds and beds are never a worry, especially once facilites and outposts are done. After that I cycle through survivors and leaders to build up the base then exile survivors (construction after i build my storage mods, electrical once i upgrade to refrigerated storage [I utilize ammo, mats, and fuel for my own purposes way more often so I dont need a big backlog of those]) to get recruits with quirk skills as I dont meed most of the stuff. I use a cnc mill on my workshop so I dont need a forge. Right now its all about morale (mine floats between 89-100), getting prime recruits, making sure their skills go the right way, drop 1500 on books here and there when they dont and bam youve got a community that can easily last a long time. I keep an automechanic around and a surgeon, and my red talon dude has utilities and plumbing for the morale bonus in the red talon officers quarters. Oh also a cook for morale but i get them and the surgeon way after i cycle through other survivors. Be ready to reroll characters for an hour to get those 3 starting skills though. I got lucky and none of them had any negative traits and the fishing guy even had the nose to tail hero bonus so i get even more food from him. I have a community of 8 right now with food at plus 2 a day with one hydroponics facility and a bag of fertilizer mod on it (+50 percent food yield)"

Thats all im talking about. Im not saying HR is pointless or shitty. Youre wishing people wouldnt feel like it was, im giving you a reason why some people feel that way. But youre continuing to argue that HR departments are good. Which i havent argued against. Im saying people arent always a fan of them because, wether you want to believe it or not, they arent always competent. But a lot of times they are, and the whole point of HR is to help employees. Reading comprehension goes a long way, you need to use it some more before making pointless comments that arent on our original point.

I think you misunderstood part of my other comment. When im talking about the people not wanting to do anything, im talking about the people that got taken advantage of, not the people in the HR department.

Most residential we do we do cat5e, but most people even in the nicer areas we are at are never getting speeds high enough to worry about a keystone jack being marginally better anyways. Like I said, ISPs suck. Im sure your keystones do just fine even if theyre messy, just like a lot of mine. I keep them pretty neat but not usually that neat lol

But if youre doing gigabit speeds you should use cat6. Im just saying, i know theres that case, but most of the time wiring isnt the reason for bad speeds, and it never is with us, we do wire right. All smooth curves and coils, no kinks. And i know this isnt exactly the optimum conmection into a keystone insert, but it will still get the job done for years, and well"
