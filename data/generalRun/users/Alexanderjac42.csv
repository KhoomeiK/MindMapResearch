greentext,ffgixrj,t1_ffggyt6,1579907297.0,"“\\” is a special character. It’s what’s called an “escape character”. In a lot of programming languages and text formatting stuffs, certain characters do special things. For instance, the “\>” character on Reddit makes the text do this:

>wow look at this text

So if you want to make a “\>” without the text doing that, you need to put an “escape character” in front of it (which in most languages is a  “\\”). The “\\” signifies that you just want to write the character and not the character’s special function. 

There’s nothing special about “/“ though."

Fleet Footwork + Triumph + Legend: Bloodline + Last Stand

Resolve: Second Wind + Revitalize

Start Rejuvenation Bead + Longsword and then rush Tiamat. After that, get boots, Caufield's Warhammer and Stinger. Build Caulfield's into Essence Reaver. Then either work on Infinity Edge if you're ahead, or finish Trinity Force (get both but order doesn't matter a whole lot). You'll want to upgrade Tiamat into Ravenous Hydra, or if you really like Death's Dance, sell Tiamat and get that. Last item kinda depends on what the enemy team has, but Rageblade is usually pretty good.

factorio,ff4prlm,t1_ff4edsy,1579569498.0,"There isn’t a limit to how many inputs and outputs to a fluid system, but pipes only have so much throughput, so if you’re using a lot of fluids, you’re going to need more pipes. The game also prevents you from mixing liquids.

Definitely process the oil at your base. Processing crude oil results in 3 separate liquids, so it’s much harder to transport. For the turrets you have two options. Either make your turrets laser turrets so they only use electricity, or put a ton of belts that run past all your turrets, and have inserters feed the ammo to the turrets.

Trains can be kinda confusing at first, especially when you have trains overlapping. Just follow this general rule: always have rail-chain-signals before an intersection and rail-signals after each intersection. And use rail-signals on long, straight pieces of track to create separate “chunks”. Idk if chunks is the word, but when placing rail signals, you’ll see that the rail is split into different colors. The colors don’t mean anything, they just are shown so it’s easier to see where the chunks are split. A train will only enter a “chunk” if there’s no other trains in it... And like the other guy said, make sure you have 2 rail paths for everything: one for each direction. You don’t want any head on collisions lol.

factorio,feffkdt,t1_fedvsrn,1579055272.0,"Actually you know what I just realized? You only really need to automate Iron, Copper, Tin, and Lead for the first bit of the game, and that doesn’t even require any Ore Sorting. Sure, you need the Silicon Ore to make glass for a few early buildings (mostly greenhouses). But it really seems like the main priority at the beginning is to get Automation Science Packs going, but then to get Steel and Basic Electronic Boards automated, and you can get those all going without dealing with any Ore Sorting. I think it just makes more sense to not worry about complicated metals at the beginning of the game."
factorio,fefcsxj,t1_fedvsrn,1579053532.0,"So I’m about ~10 hours into my first Bobs/Angels run and dealing with excess ores has also been my biggest issue starting out. Warehouses and Ore Silos can store tons and tons of items, so those are a good place to start with for holding onto items.

You will end up with a lot of Crushed Stone and Slag which are annoying though, and you don’t really want to save that much of them. I’ve gotten used to using Clarifiers and Flare Stacks. Both of these buildings just straight up delete what you put into them, so it’s useful for getting rid of excess materials. However, you can only put liquids and chemicals into these buildings, so you need to turn your Slags into Crushed Ores, and then your Crushed ores into Mineral Water before putting them in a Clarifier. I know you can turn Iron and Copper into Ferric Chloride and Cupric Chloride, and I haven’t tried it, but I’m pretty sure you can get rid of those in Flare Stacks. I’m sure there are other ways to convert other ores into disposable products too.

But really at the beginning, I don’t think it’s really important to worry about making the most efficient ore smelting designs. Getting some Ore Crushers and Ore Sorting Facilities, and smelting what you get from that should be plenty for the early game. Idk what catalysts are cause I haven’t gotten that far though. Besides Slag and Crushed ore, you’re probably good throwing most things into Warehouses."
