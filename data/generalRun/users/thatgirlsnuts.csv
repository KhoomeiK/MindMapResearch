college,fesm8pl,t3_eqdwbp,1579366717.0,"In my experience, confidence is built from successes. But your brain don’t know the difference between big or small successes. So I’d like to suggest giving yourself a single *small* “task “ to complete either each day/week/event. For example: say your first task is to say hello first to a stranger you would not otherwise need to talk to. Seems small, but you need proof that you can do it and nothing bad will happen. That’s one success! Next time, you initiate a quick convo (think easy topics: weather, food, etc.) with a classmate you are aware of but maybe never spoke to.  Boom! Second success! Then just keep upping the stakes with each task. This gives your brain a frame of reference to go further each time. Fake it till you make it could be good if you know what to model as your faking it. Some people have no clue what their thing looks like so faking it is impossible. 
At any rate, good luck!!"

rant,fdprual,t1_fdp969n,1578638067.0,"I LOVE dark/offensive humor. It IS the best humor out there. What has to be considered is the level of rapport between the joke teller and the “target” or “audience”. Reason being, it’s hard as a POC to know for SURE what’s truly a good-natured joke and what’s a latent bias against a set of people said in a joking manner. Why? Because everything could be pushed aside with, “stop being so sensitive.” “Learn to take a joke”. That sort of gaslighting REALLY fucks with a person. 

I think of it like this: I can call my sister a bitch all day long, but if one of my super close friends calls her a bitch, I may not dig that so much. Especially if there’s a lack a rapport between my friend and my sister.

AskReddit,fdlu2mv,t1_fdlc3l3,1578532506.0,"Yeah, so this was at an ER so you can imagine that it was busy. My husband was such a bulldog for me, chasing doctors and nurses to get them to come in. But it was literally like they would give me a dose of the pain meds and I would be OK for 10 minutes until a contraction hit and as soon as it did it was it as if they never gave me the medication 10 minutes before. My blood volume was so low that my blood pressure was dangerously low and I continued to pass out every few minutes because of it. It became an issue of them fearing they’d overdose me. 

The attending physician was calling around to every hospital to see if there was someone anywhere who could perform the emergency D& E that I needed. I learned from that trip that hospitals don’t generally do either D & C or D & E so they don’t have the appropriate equipment to do it. What ended up happening is an OB was coming in to be on duty and she approached us and said that she had done the procedure maybe three times but she felt confident she could do it because I had ‘evacuated’ so much in the time I had been at the ER that some of the usual instruments would not actually be necessary. She said it would take her a half hour to set up, an hour to do the procedure an hour to do recovery and that I’d be out by midnight. They rolled me out of the ER in a wheelchair at 12:01. This was a really terrible situation, but my life was saved by those people and I am forever grateful."
