bujo,ffeorqe,t3_esvf8f,1579857835.0,Is that a Pokemon sticker? I love this. I've been looking into rolling spreads because I find that I waste a lot of space with pre-set ones.
pokemon,ff3qaf2,t3_er0lzj,1579546539.0,Very very cool. You are talented.
pokemon,fexk8t9,t3_eqsy5h,1579432349.0,"Haha, was someone watching Michael/MandJTV? I learned that yesterday too."
boardgames,fetvezs,t3_eqjg68,1579380453.0,"Mine would have to have been Caverna, which goes against the grain. I love Agricola, I love other worker placement games, but that was too much. Too many pieces. Too many rules. It just became too much of a hassle to set up/tear down. 

I watched videos, for sure thinking I would love it. But then when I got it, nope.. I ended up selling it here and haven't looked back since."
cats,fel44od,t3_epq2f2,1579213650.0,Oh my goodness. Reunited!!

>This is so adorable! Would you please take a video of the two of them together, if you can? I’d love to see them together."
cats,feifkd0,t3_ep7cq5,1579137356.0,"I'm so sorry! :( You sound like an awesome friend. Keep Cooper company, he loves you so much. Enjoy one another's company. You and Cooper are in my thoughts."
bulletjournal,fei4mou,t1_fehs03g,1579130178.0,I've always wondered that too. I want to find a way to combine my trackers to correlate things for medical reasons and I haven't found a way to do it effectively. I'd be interested to hear any successes in doing this.
cats,feh31d3,t3_ep0uzv,1579108103.0,So sorry.. Very very lovely lady. It's difficult to lose family.
AskReddit,fdmxztm,t3_em2vfz,1578570808.0,"Taking my shoes off immediately after entering my house. To this day I still do it and sometimes when I am at another person's house they tell me to not do it/it isn't necessary.


.. But I still do it out of habit. Plus, it keeps the floors and carpet cleaner."

Catloaf,fde2mbr,t3_eknspx,1578329787.0,Please don't wait. I lost my baby last year like this.
crochet,fd96544,t3_ek73i2,1578228996.0,This is great. It reminds me of Zygarde (the Pokemon). [Reference](https://cdn.bulbagarden.net/upload/9/94/718Zygarde-10Percent.png)
bulletjournal,fd95xtd,t3_ek4546,1578228866.0,I love this. I am going to steal this idea. It will simplify my journal a bit.

KneadyCats,fcmsdv4,t3_ehotrc,1577789922.0,Where did you buy the lamb plush? This is cute!
AskReddit,fcmrpco,t3_ehrop4,1577788940.0,"This was my ""new years resolution"" this year. Our household loved homemade quesadillas, vegetable lasagna, and chilli. With new stuff like the instant pot and my trusty crockpot .. and batch prepping this year, it made it a lot easier to decide, ""going out is more effort than it is worth."""
