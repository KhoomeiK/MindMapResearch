I had both of these albums when they were released in 79 and 80 and have since gotten the re released versions as well. They are good albums, but not considered classics or hard rock by most fans, minus a handful of songs. I do agree the songwriting is mostly great too. And I'm aware that these albums were big in Australia. But again, most of the songs are not considered hard rock."
videos,ffcgllb,t1_ffcchlt,1579799017.0,Never said it was illegal. And yes it is part of the issue here. Judge gave the cop attitude as if he was above the law. Cop should have cited him for the reason he was pulled over once he was given attitude. This happens everyday. Quite often your attitude determines if you are getting a ticket or not.
