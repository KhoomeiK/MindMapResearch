datascience,fc5ypi2,t1_fc5rz20,1577468608.0,"I've got a job in software right now, having a bachelor's in physics. On a typical day, I work with some of the technologies you said you were unprepared for in the interviews: REST APIs, SQL, A/B testing. Probably many others you didn't mention but were probably asked, including unit testing, writing documentation, and OOP.

While not terribly specific, focusing on that sort of skill set might help you find work as a software engineer. Then whatever you need to learn for data science, you could potentially do in your own time. You might even be able to transition into data science for whatever company hires you; that was (and maybe still is) a possibility for me."

So far, I've found the following options. Are any of these a safe bet for a complete piano beginner? Thanks!
