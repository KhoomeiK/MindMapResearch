depression,ff51zsm,t1_ff4tdi1,1579578059.0,I know
depression,ff3l018,t1_ff37m8s,1579543286.0,Try to do something nice for yourself today. You're worth it.
personalfinance,ff2cim2,t1_ff26mx1,1579500700.0,"Also, given my situation, what would you recommend for my 80k in cash? Should I start buying in increments every month and ETF s&p index fund (that's where most of my IRA money is)? As I said, my parents have money, I make money, I really can't see a gloom and doom situation and I'd obviously keep 20k or more as emergency. Would just you just start buying right now?"
personalfinance,ff2cbxm,t1_ff26mx1,1579500511.0,"Thx man, I know the saying about timing the market. I don't really know what I'm waiting for, but I guess my fear is that I buy high."
personalfinance,ff1zujy,t3_eq6h7i,1579490072.0,"I'm 30, I have no debt, make more money than I spend, and have a lot of it sitting in cash (after maxing out 401k and IRA contributions).

I've been sitting on cash because I'm scared of a bit hit of an upcoming recession. I feel that this strategy is kinda smart but I've lost out on making a lot of money because of this anxiety.

Any help? I really don't foresee buying a house in the next 3 years, I don't like the housing market."

climbing,fek19tk,t1_fejxjx8,1579190458.0,"It's more that I don't see ambition from him in creating close relationships with other ppl to climb outside with or working on better climbing technique. I feel I would benefit from other influences and so would he.

I've been teaching him stuff lately that I pick up, but it's more that it's been an exclusive and consistent Mon and Wed at 5 relationship for so long that breaking it up kinda seems like a strong gesture."
climbing,fejwvih,t3_emqryn,1579187698.0,"Have you ever split ways with your climbing partner? I've been climbing with the same guy since I started (3 yrs) and it's good that he's consistent but I feel like he doesn't foster a sense a community, he isn't teaching me new things, and I just don't feel excited or happy about climbing with him.

I'm thinking of telling him that I think a change of scenery would be good, but I understand the value in having someone that shows up consistently."
climbing,febfmfd,t1_febdr4v,1578958294.0,Thx man!
climbing,feb74wq,t3_eo3z9u,1578956037.0,"Recommends on YouTube videos that help with technique? I've been climbing indoors for years and wanting to get next level, looking for help! What pushed you to the next level?"
Cardinals,fdnxswo,t1_fdnskpg,1578595025.0,"It's not hard, it's just gated super hard. Like a difference of 2 levels makes a fight a slog."
food,fdhrdvb,t1_fdhqzfk,1578428686.0,"I kinda eye balled but this was the basis - I added leftover pineapple juice from the canned pineapple and added more sugar. I tried to use less sugar/honey but you gotta make it taste good!

I also didn't deep fry the pork, couldn't be bothered breading but the marinade was so good, the pork by itself was phenomal.
