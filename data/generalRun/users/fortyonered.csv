There’s gotta be a use for it...”"

MonsterHunterWorld,feh3f78,t3_em6mou,1579108335.0,"Just trying to set my expectations correctly as a Hammer boi — my squad is me (hammer), HH, and Charge Blade. We’re just starting IB (about to fight Glav and Narga) and I’m getting trounced by the Charge Blade in damage output. I do better if the target is easier to pin down, but my charge blade buddy is pretty consistently 45-55% of damage output in our group with me slightly ahead of the HH.

I know damage output is just part of a clear picture, and I need to practice staying in front of the monster more often without getting carted, but I feel like even when I’m playing well our CB outperforms me — hunts take twice as long two-manning with the HH than with all three of us. Is hammer more gear dependent than CB? Am I just bad?"
tumblr,fedqqah,t3_eoh84w,1579017842.0,"A few years ago my girlfriend spotted a peacock wandering around a North Texas college campus, unsupervised. As someone who has seen a peacock maybe once at a zoo, her frantic message with accompanying picture alarmed me greatly.

I quickly shared this insanity with my coworkers, who acted as though seeing a peacock in any setting was as droll and commonplace as seeing an elderly woman in a car, or a bird in a bush. To this day, I am infuriated by this response. It’s not nothing! It’s a peacock loose on a university campus!

Epilogue: I do not get out very often because my things are all at home, but I have still never seen a peacock outside of a zoo. I’ve heard tell of peacocks that live in edge-of-city domestic environments as rural-adjacent pets (like donkeys or alpacas or chickens) but have yet to see one in person. The closest I’ve gotten is a pair of mischievous turkeys in Frisco, sneaking from their yards in the dead of night to sit on top of their privacy fence, which — frankly? — was nearly as disconcerting."

deadbydaylight,fdj7a76,t3_elnt8f,1578460457.0,"I know this is isn't entirely consistent with other mechanics (Legion notifications during Frenzy come to mind) but because the shock originates from the Doctor himself I would expect it to still use the Doctor's terror radius, which I guess would be zero? Dark Devotion has always had nebulous interactions with other mechanics.

Maybe I'm trying too hard to apply logic here. I think having it originate from the survivor could be interesting in edge cases, so maybe rule of fun wins out."

skyrim,fdfrb2c,t1_fdf11jn,1578368300.0,"There was (is) a mod for New Vegas called Feng Shui that used the script extender to allow fine placement of world objects and to lock them in place.

You activated it through an aid item and it caused whatever item was under your crosshairs to glow. Hitting enter would activate placement mode, letting you move that item around and rotate it, and then hitting * would lock it in place. It had a pretty robust set of features too, like multiple movement modes, local vs. absolute for rotation, scaling, etc.

When I picked up the remastered TES5 I looked for a Skyrim iteration, but never found anything like it. But it stands to reason that even if we never get anything like that in vanilla, it might happen through mods."

**HOUSE:** You don't know the things people do when they think they're alone. Wiping boogers on my banisters...

**LEONARD:** Right.

**HOUSE:** ... masturbating in my showers...

**LEONARD:** Not good.

**HOUSE:** Thank you for noticing. How would you like someone cutting a hole in your head to “let a little more light in”?

**LEONARD:** You're preaching to the choir, sister. I still think twice before proclaiming the Earth revolves around the Sun in a public square.

*(HOUSE sighs wearily, tone softening.)*

**HOUSE:** It's nice to let this all out.

*(Brief silence. LEONARD seizes the moment.)*

**LEONARD:** Look, I don't know how to say this without being insulting, but no one wants to hear what you have to say. They just want to live here.
