I checked the most popular engineer union in my country. It costs $1000 a year to be a member, but $800 of that can be deducted from taxes.

Being a member gives you all sorts of other benefits outside the usual salary negotiations, where the average salary is currently being reported at $75k.\*

Various insurance policies for the home and such at much lower prices, stipends for phds, cheaper living if the union has a deal with realtors in an area, might even come with buyer's priority, special accounts for additional savings if they have an agreement with a bank, the list goes on.

When you have strong unions you can get so much more out of it than toothless parasites collecting dues, you get actual support, and you have someone who will fight for your rights and contract so that you don't have to take all that time and effort out of your own time.

Point is all the benefits Americans tie to workplaces other countries tie to the union. If you swap to a different employer to get a higher salary you keep all your previous benefits because you're still in the same union.

Even after the US has proven itself to be unreliable after the 2008 crisis, the value has somehow shot through the roof.

ABoringDystopia,fexj1q4,t1_fewxmwh,1579431795.0,"Unions aren't necessarily per-workplace. For example: engineers hired in various industries and companies can be part of the same union. Normal warehouse and grocery and logistics workers can all be in the same labour union.

This most certainly requires full-time positions. Part-time position is an issue and a problem, not a solution, one of the things Americans should learn.

Same goes for overtime -- if there is enough work to be done that employees are constantly being asked to work overtime then the company has no excuse but to hire more people in full-time positions, by law.

That's the thing in countries with strong worker-rights; if a position exists, it should be full-time by default. Part-time positions are for special cases, like paid summer jobs for high-schoolers. In my country these laws are in regards to your age. If you're under 18 companies have more lee-way, but once you're an adult they're required to offer full-time positions by default, unless you choose to have a special contract arrangement.

The workers for the union have to be able to feed themselves too, you know, they shouldn't be out there doing shifts different jobs and worry about money for gas.

The problems are incentives. Just like police somehow run their departments as a business profit center, so does union become corrupt in America, where everything is treated as a business by default. ""Squeeze out that profit wherever, anything goes"" mentality."
