Paranormal,ffeoq0z,t3_et0mmm,1579857763.0,Need to carry some silver on you. Seems like a wraith. Wind was probably howling too.
brakebills,ffeolvt,t1_ffehq8n,1579857586.0,A pack of smokes for a rabbit sounds like a good deal to me.
college,ffeoj50,t3_et2f4x,1579857468.0,Why are you telling me I'm broke. I definitely have at least three moneys.

college,fektgz2,t1_fekivcm,1579207258.0,"And now I know, thank you."
college,fekiqa0,t1_fek10d8,1579200883.0,To that extent I do see how it could be difficult. I've survived so far with minimal interaction in college and don't mind it. However I do sometimes regret missed connections from high school so I understand your point to some degree.
college,fekiia7,t1_fek0wwv,1579200751.0,I see that now. Thank you.
college,fekiemd,t1_fejt7li,1579200688.0,That's understandable. However I'll die when I die. I myself do not see a need to prolong my life if I enjoy what little of it I get.
college,fejabs6,t1_fej5o59,1579163939.0,What's the problem with avoiding people honestly?
college,fejaa36,t1_feiw739,1579163873.0,Why not go through life like this? Honest question.
college,feja5d4,t3_epchz8,1579163684.0,"I for one have a ton of small talk experience due to work and absolutely fucking despise it. Don't ask me about the fucking weather, we live in the same city. As a college senior I have made a couple acquaintances but that's from them approaching me first. I see absolutely no reason to engage with anyone because I don't see any way that it could be worth it honestly. Not saying that this is the right way to go along with your college experience but that's just me. 90% of people I meet piss me off to one degree or another. Don't get me wrong, I've met some amazing people as well, but overall I keep to myself. Nothing wrong with being overtly friendly or a people person but that's not who I am so I tend to hate it when someone forces me to match their character. Sorry for the rant, but just be you, the right people will find you, and if they don't, fuck em."

witcher,fdo6big,t1_fdmt7zd,1578599649.0,"Not my math, just what I was able to find and which seems most accurate. Yes in Wild Hunt he's about 100 but that's around 10 years after the last book apparently.  In the beginning of the show he can be anywhere from 40-60. Once again, we have no idea honestly."
witcher,fdo5ifx,t1_fdmp83o,1578599254.0,Books predominantly but games as well. Also from something Sapkowski mentioned I think.
