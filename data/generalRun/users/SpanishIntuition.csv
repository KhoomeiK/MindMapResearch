You can experience something similar when you're dreaming.   Although you may be fast asleep,  inside your head you could be snowboarding with your friends.   The 3D environment, the snow, your snowboard, your friends and the people around you are all fake.

Is it starting to make sense? Haven't you noticed that you're a very soft hearted kind and empathetic person? that you don't really belong to the commercialization of this society? Think about it for a minute. So whenever you try to ""motivate"" yourself to do something for you, your soul fights it.

but why? BECAUSE you're you. even though you've been conditioned to want to be successful for yourself, your soul refuses because your true nature tells you that your REAL need to get fit and strong and succeed and push forward is for others. You're not like anyone else and you Know it. Your very nature has always centered around this NEED to help others. It's your definition.

so when a commercialized society conditions you to succeed for the self what happens? you reject it. You feel anxiety, a lack of motivation. Depression. Let me prove it to you.

Try this little exercise. Go to the gym. grab a random weight machine and push it with an image of you working out for yourself. record the number or sets and reps. good.

NOW go to another machine and imagine an earthquake and a child trapped under a car. And as you push the weight, your muscles get stronger. and with each rep, you lift the car right off the child so she can escape. how many did you do?

EXACTLY.

see the actions and the goal is the same. the WHY is different. Put aside your need to push forward for you, or for fame, or wealth, or none of that bullcrap that for you don't matter.

BECOME BATMAN. pump iron, go to the gym. Get out. for that kid. or that population, or your family whom you will one day help or save with a much stronger body.

Study hard, and get that better job NOT for self wealth. But for the idea that you're gonna do it so that you will have enough to buy sleeping bags for the homeless. Or give a person a meal or a place to stay when they need it.

and with that. with who you REALLY ARE in mind.

the Moment you finish reading this, your anxiety and depression and lack of motivation will go away.

get to the gym, get fit, get into MMA, study hard. only this time not for yourself. for others."
