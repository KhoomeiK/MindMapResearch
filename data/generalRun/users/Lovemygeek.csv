I use them on my face, on my kids in the bath, in the kitchen, on my kids faces and hands after dinner. A wet washcloth can be used on a feverish forehead or to hold an ice cube to an injury, or to wipe door handles. We use little to no disposables like makeup pads.

It sounds like perhaps you are thinking of the wrong definition for washcloth."

autism,ff9cizv,t1_fdoj4kr,1579709908.0,"Eh. I'm a para with a BS in Ed and working on my master's. I work with kids all across the spectrum, service medical needs, emotional impairments, as well as more 'traditional' cognitive impairments. 

I guarantee the person you are responding to is correct. I currently have a student on the spectrum who shouldn't need a babysitter/helicopter-er. He's very bright and could fly through his work. He can go from place to place responsibly when he wants to. But we never know when he is going to he disruptive/have an outburst (like screaming TELL ME WHY I SHOULD CARE ABOUT THIS STUPID STUFF), refuse to participate in class by rolling around on the floor reading a book (sitting at his desk refusing would be different), or bail out on where he supposed to be to hide somewhere reading a book, or lock himself in the shitter to avoid doing his work. In his mind he is not causing a problem, he doesn't see an issue with his behavior and he always has a personal justification.  No matter how much I work with him, he insists he is right and I am wrong. Now, don't get me wrong, I dont have an answer besides ""because the state said so"" for why he has to do that stupid stuff, but he needs to ask in the right time and place with the right volume and level of respect to the instructor AND he needs to do his assignments. I now have to helicopter and it sucks on both ends, him and me... plus I guarantee my district would rather allocate my skills somewhere that they would be better applied.

They can do things like start a load of laundry or help me clean the garage. We have gone on long trips together and they're just good companions. They can play strategy board games and sit quietly reading with me. We can build stuff together (today it was forts out of scrap lumber in a snowstorm, last week they did their own pinewood derby cars,unassisted). They can pack their own lunches. But they still snuggle up with me to watch a family show together. My oldest will take off with his buds now and then and I do miss him actually needing me, but he is also growing into a pretty cool kid. Number two is at the most fun age where he will ask me to snuggle but also does things like care for his bearded dragon with only infrequent reminders (like hey remember he needs a  bath today) and swap beyblades and pokemon cards.

There should also be a case manager or social worker who could help create a social story for James regarding when it is ok to give people hugs (eg ""some people like hugs. Some do not. I need to ask someone if it is ok to hug them before I give them a hug. If they say yes then it is ok to hug. If they say no, it is not ok to hug."")

They refused to redeliver, I was starving and pregnant and had a broken leg. They said if I came in they'd remake the order. When I went in they said they needed the food but I had legit already thrown it away, because she told me just to come in and had acknowledged the mistake. 

At this point I think she was trying to fuck with me or try to get me to go away because she told me just to bring the trash to show her - I had driven to the restaurant with my leg in a cast, on crutches, and visibly pregnant how TF was I going to carry the trash. So, I ran home and grabbed the trash bag to show them and hobbled in dragging it behind me  Then she refused to remake the food because it was in the bag (?!?) So I pulled it out and put it on her counter. Yes it was a dick move BUT it was like $50 of food that they had made incorrectly and were refusing to remake. No joke, she then called the cops on me. I didnt yell or swear or anything, I was frustrated, confused, and hungry but not mean. I sat quietly and waited for them.

The police were like uhhhhh you either have to remake her food or give her the money back or we will issue a citation. Then they waited for me to get my food (or a refund) and made sure I got my delivery fee back.

Do what is right (and tell your mom your daughter's rent agreement is between the two of you). You could always go the route of asking her to pay $25 in rent then spotting her 25 in gas. My mom holds my current mortgage even though we are both on the title (long story but we will finance traditionally this year) and I cant remember all the legalities but I pay ""rent"" to her (for tax reasons, otherwise it is a gift I think?).
