recruitinghell,fen1nku,t1_femszpt,1579274973.0,"One of my coworkers yesterday was talking about how much he used to work. Bragging about how when his daughter was born he didn't take any time off at all, and how that made him happy because he didn't have to spend time with his daughter, who they had to bring back to the hospital a couple of times because she was sick.

I have no idea how he's still married."
