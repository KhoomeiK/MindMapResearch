AnimalsBeingJerks,ff51d4s,t3_epmqe0,1579577590.0,My pit is just as bad. She’s terrified of kittens but adult cats MUST be friends with her. She will cry at cat until it gives her any attention.

iamatotalpieceofshit,fej0o5m,t1_fefunn4,1579152719.0,"Either way, way too hot for a brachycephalic breed like the boxer. And assuming they were this stupid they probably didn’t provide water to the poor animal as well. This is all too common in airlines when pets are involved."

AnimalsBeingBros,feekhwb,t1_fedt48k,1579035587.0,You think horse girls are crazy?! HA! They’re mild compared to dog girls. My poor husband has to deal with my dog obsessed ass even when he’s at work! And to top it off I love horses. I’ve never owned one but love to help my aunt out with hers.

MakeMeSuffer,fe03yad,t3_enhejl,1578802479.0,As a bather/groomer trainee this is my worst nightmare! My own dog’s ass juice has splashed me in the face before and it sucks. This stuff smells like rotten fish on a hot and humid deck in the swamps of Louisiana. And is gritty in texture. I cannot fathom the amount of vomit I would project across the room if this ever lands in my mouth.

aww,fdp1aa4,t1_fdoxvqg,1578617620.0,I’ve decided my critters from here out will be Disney themed. I really want a female ginger cat (rare I know) so that I can name her Thomasina.  Hopefully that’s not for many years to come as our rule is no more pets until the ones we have are gone. We have three cats and two dogs as well as the three rats.

Wellthatsucks,fdlrirx,t1_fdkffyf,1578530777.0,"This happened to me when I was like 8. I slammed my thumb in the trunk and screamed for help for like 2 minutes. My sister could hear me and ignored me. I finally wiggled free and ran inside. My nail fell off and I was swollen and bruised for quite a while. Surprisingly,  didn’t break my thumb."
aww,fdk8vsy,t1_fdk8kag,1578498729.0,Awww bless your neighbor! That’s so sweet. My grandpa did the same for a jack rabbit when I was really little. He has to keep it in an upright refrigerator box so that it couldn’t jump out until it was old enough to be released. It stuck around for a few months and then moved on about three miles down the road where a bunch more rabbits were being fed by the neighbor
Zoomies,fdk8imj,t3_elrxf9,1578498496.0,My pitty does the same even if it’s just frost she goes crazy!
aww,fdk4xb0,t3_eln2x3,1578496139.0,"We had a doe at my grandpa’s place out in central Oregon. She had several fawns right of his back porch and would hang around for snacks every evening for years. She was the sweetest old girl. She couldn’t keep up with the rest of the deer as she got older but still held her own against the dogs and coyotes. It broke our hearts when we had to move GP into a memory care center and had to sell the house. She loved pears and peaches (so we named her peaches). Mostly she loved stealing tomatoes from the neighbor’s huge garden and then running to GP for shelter. He wouldn’t let anything happen to his furry friends. 
When we sold the house we left a description of Peaches and her favorite foods on the counter for the new owners. When we weren’t home my grandpa’s friends would keep an eye on the place and leave peaches some apples or pears."

trashy,fda14aq,t3_ek95mj,1578240460.0,"I had this happen when I was like 18. A guy started messaging me on FB telling me “I bet you’re great in bed.” “You’re so hot” so I snooped his profile and he was listed engaged! Now this was like 11:30 pm and I had just gotten off work. I was tired, sore, and not ready for bull shit. I asked him about his fiancée, and he said she crashed after work and he was horny. (So you hit up random girls on fb?) I told him he needed to come clean with her about what he had been doing before she finds out. He then proceeded to go all nice guy and show just how nice he was. Some people’s children I swear!"
PublicFreakout,fd7ayeg,t1_fd1nacy,1578201753.0,"As someone who has worked as a caregiver, this frightens me. I had a woman like this who would scream at me and shriek like this when she was told she had to/couldn’t do something. One time was telling her that she was supposed to eat her diabetic snack and not feed it to her dog. And that she was supposed to be walking her dog not staff(against company policy) she shrieked for help for twenty minutes while I tried to explain to her that her dog couldn’t be allowed to potty in the apartment. She finally moved out when her daughter realized that she was more than an assisted living case. And they ditched the little dog. (Dog went home with a staff member after following legal procedure)"

ChoosingBeggars,fcxjxvt,t3_ejewev,1578064768.0,Oh. My. God. My sister is an Army wife and says her biggest reward is that her husband comes home in one piece! She recently had quite a few medical scares and nearly died. The army sent him home from Kuwait within 48 hours so that he could care for her. That’s her reward. That’s the perks. Not free drinks

If you undercut the sand dune I can only imagine it would be a short lived experience whereas a flash flood can carry a lot of water for a long time."

trashy,fckghi1,t1_fcihkce,1577724798.0,"Assuming this is in the US, the local shelters can take the animal free of charge with simple questions asked and then can either euthanize or try to place the pet in a foster home or rescue."
BuyItForLife,fcje0sy,t3_ehdpd1,1577684308.0,We bought one of these after our son was born a little over three years ago. It kept water warm throughout the night for formula so that we didn’t have to keep walking back and forth to the kitchen with a crying baby. Even when he started in soy milk we kept hot water in it to warm the milk up for him until he finally learned to sleep through the night.

MadeMeSmile,fbuoqxv,t3_eejby8,1577117946.0,"I remember when my grandpa was nearing the end. He only remembered my dad. We had my aunt (GP’s older sister) fly from Seattle to Bend to see him about a year before he passed. He thought she was my grandma and then all together didn’t recognize her. It broke her heart but she was incredibly understanding. About 8 months later he asked how she was and how her son’s racehorses were doing. My dad was overjoyed and called her right then. My grandpa was always hard of hearing so my dad helped him understand her over the phone. The last words they said to each other were “I love you, stubborn. And there’s nothing you can do about it!” Most sibling thing I’ve ever heard lol. He passed about 3 1/2 months later. And she passed September 2 of this year. The stories that were told about the two were legendary. The two of them got in and out of so much mischief it was comforting for the family to think that they are continuing that lifelong adventure somewhere peaceful"
