todayilearned,ffepskf,t1_ffe8znx,1579859381.0,When I commented most of the comments were negative. I see it's opposite now.
TwoXChromosomes,ffepo02,t1_ffe9ifk,1579859192.0,"Society tells us to care *that much* about it. Virginity is a social construct and I agree with you that it doesn't really matter, but what we call something is important because we make it matter."
todayilearned,ffep80c,t1_ffe9vl5,1579858509.0,"Yeah, you should have the pigs eat some Orwell. Maybe they'll revolt."
todayilearned,ffep28e,t1_ffea1pa,1579858271.0,That's horrible!
TwoXChromosomes,ffep14v,t1_ffea5th,1579858226.0,"I wouldn't really call being raped a sexual debut. That's sort of an important part of my reason for this word; it frames sex as something participatory.

AsI understand it, many rape survivors won't define a sexual assault as the moment they lost their virginity, but society ""corrects"" them if they say it. I feel *sexual debut* includes rape survivors' perspective."
AskReddit,ffeoslq,t1_ffenly5,1579857872.0,"Oh, thank you for sharing this. It really made my experience much more easy to deal with."
todayilearned,ffeopch,t1_ffef1g6,1579857734.0,"Well, I care if my meat has been humanely slaughtered, and whether the animals have have been treated well. I don't think killing animals for food is wrong, but I think we should make sure they're not subject to unnecessary suffering."
videos,ffdwpaw,t3_et2i8n,1579830803.0,The most uncomfortable thing was how she locked her elbows on the first jump. That had to hurt.
askgaybros,ffdwim7,t3_et26sl,1579830672.0,Report him. He is threatening you and has filmed you without your consent in a compromising situation.
todayilearned,ffdvrwe,t1_ffdvm0y,1579830146.0,Possibly more than you.
TwoXChromosomes,ffdvg9y,t1_ffdv732,1579829920.0,Debuting sexually. As I said.
MapPorn,ffdv7q1,t3_et227p,1579829754.0,"Uhm, these aren't all historic names, are they? Some names seem to me just the modern place names rewritten in an Old-Norse sounding way."
todayilearned,ffduhr2,t1_ffdu20w,1579829238.0,"Lol. Thanks for the psycho-analysis, bro. I'll be sure to discuss this with my therapist next session."
MapPorn,ffdrnop,t3_et1h79,1579827247.0,"Firstly, this map has historical inaccuracies.

Secondly it's bad design to have such similar colors between the countries who contributed voluntarily and those with puppet governments. Especially when you call it the map of shame."
todayilearned,ffdpwwd,t1_ffdpa9z,1579826136.0,Have you actually counted how many of the comments were from before and after my comment? I assume you haven't because that would be crazy. I just remember how it was when I first read the comment section.
TwoXChromosomes,ffdpjnz,t3_et1e9b,1579825905.0,Jesus Christ! Do your friends really have so little regard for your emotional well-being that they remind you of trauma just to correct you on something that's just a social construct anyways?
todayilearned,ffdovi4,t1_ffdn5ia,1579825483.0,"Yep. It's quick an painless. Obviously we're talking about killing animals here, not humans."
todayilearned,ffdomy7,t1_ffdoiqh,1579825333.0,"Lol, when I posted my comment an hour ago the majority of the comments were negative."
nonononoyes,ffdnqay,t3_et0qd1,1579824779.0,Oh thank God. I was worried for that chair.
todayilearned,ffdnkw6,t1_ffdnb9x,1579824689.0,"No, but I've been to a real farm. Several actually."
todayilearned,ffdmsch,t1_ffdm9h5,1579824209.0,"Let me guess, you've seen one video of animals treated badly and assume that's how it is everywhere?"
AskReddit,ffdmguq,t1_ffdi7s6,1579824016.0,"Well, now you're definitely on her list."
todayilearned,ffdmdhs,t1_ffdm33l,1579823957.0,"Yeah, those firemen probably thought the farmer would show mercy to his pigs after they survived the fire. Ooor they realized that they were saving livestock."
todayilearned,ffdlzm0,t1_ffdll65,1579823715.0,"If you don't want to eat animals because you empathize with them, that's completely fine, but if someone's fine with eating animals I don't see how them surviving something is going to change that. All farmers have to work hard to make sure their animals survive until they can be slaughtered for meat. That's just a part of animal husbandry."
AskReddit,ffdlmz2,t3_et0asi,1579823503.0,"I remember in middle school the was this one girl who would grope my thighs and such, and just generally making unwanted physical contact. The worst part was that she would make sure to do it in public and people would make fun of me for how her advances made me uncomfortable."
todayilearned,ffdl14d,t1_ffdkt6b,1579823127.0,Hate to break it to you
todayilearned,ffdksdq,t1_ffdbj51,1579822976.0,Sneaky editing there. Too late though.
todayilearned,ffdjo9w,t1_ffdjglq,1579822299.0,Muslims and Jews don't make up half the world's population. I don't think adding vegetarians is enough either.

todayilearned,ffdi4kk,t3_et0aby,1579821352.0,"What's with all the people saying that this was a ""fuck you"" to the firefighters? You do realize that pigs are raised for eating, right?

The firefighters possibly saved the farmer's livelihood, and it's much more pleasant for the pigs to be humanely slaughtered than dying slowly and painfully in a fire."
todayilearned,ffdhqj0,t1_ffdhbi5,1579821117.0,You understand what farm animals are for?
todayilearned,ffdhmie,t1_ffdfwrd,1579821050.0,"I mean, pigs are for eating."

MapPorn,ffblf53,t3_esez03,1579771057.0,What's that island off the coast of the US that's not in the Caribbean?
composer,ffblcsj,t3_esg3j8,1579770958.0,"Not about composition, but recording. Did you record the singer and piano separately? Because it definitely sounds like that as they don't blend very well. You can fix it by turning down the volume of the soprano a bit and adding a slight reverb to both. I know any sort of fixing and mixing is sort of taboo in classical music, but it isn't really uncommon. Studios usually have an unnaturally dry sound."
therewasanattempt,ffbkh6t,t3_esiw1u,1579769621.0,"I'm Norwegian, but have a name with Latin and Slavic roots. Does that mean I'm evil?"
IRLEasterEggs,ffbk0ia,t3_esak3t,1579768959.0,Where is this? I left that exact kind of Harry Potter mini figure in an attic when I moved many years ago.

nottheonion,ff4jd7o,t3_ere6f9,1579565013.0,"If you read just a couple of paragraphs you'll get a completely different picture from what the headline tells. He was referring to *specific* people as creeps, and only one person who ""teaches kids how to kill.""

Now, I'm not saying that he doesn't have anything against video games. I don't know that. But the headline isn't just misleading, but wrong. There's a significant fucking difference between calling one game developer a creep who teaches kids how to kill and calling all game developer**s** for creeps."
