FireEmblemHeroes,fgk5548,t1_fgjehdi,1580857700.0,"Not just big youtubers. Jensarii1 had his channel taken over, and then deleted because the hacker uploaded illegal anime shit onto it. He did star wars vs videos."
FireEmblemHeroes,fgk4z07,t3_eync7l,1580857597.0,Azura again? I get she's amazing but do we really need her again in the pool? I'd prefer not to get a plus 2 Azura.
GBO2,fgj30lp,t3_eymobr,1580836017.0,Its strong point is mid range stun and suppression of the enemy it's not supposed to make plays but enable them

GBO2,fgeg4h5,t3_exw2jm,1580698786.0,"When no one takes bases, and people spread out in really bad formation. Raids going towards the front ignoring looking for supports, generals just being outmatched, and the support acting like the best place for him to be to be right in front of the pack. I usually see it most in the newest ruined city map. People don't back up the people they spawn with and immediately zoom off to the center. Alternatively they all gang up on one person while ignoring the five guys coming just right behind them without blinking an eye."
GBO2,fgefyca,t3_exrzy7,1580698664.0,I mean I fight unless I've had a really shitty day and the team has completely abandoned any sense of fighting line. Like being a gunner gundam literally pushed up against the edge of the map because I have nowhere to go in our base spawn type stuff.

FireEmblemHeroes,fg2edrg,t1_fg2b3qe,1580443418.0,"As an eagles casual fan it was a pretty pitiful season seeing Carson, and Ertz drag what was left of the Philadelphia Eagles into the play offs in spite of a bizarre loss to the dolphins only for him to get wrecked again at the start of it."
movies,fg2dwbi,t3_ewfgo8,1580443157.0,"Its a shame this series never made it past two in terms of quality. But Star Wars also got punched, and castrated by Disney so I guess this is just the world we live in."
Shadiversity,ffvssk9,t1_fcxsit7,1580272221.0,"In legends it was designed to specifically give more options in saber dueling and not so much for blaster deflection. When the sith died off...well that model of saber, and style became considerably less popular"
Gundam,ffvolqv,t3_euv6m5,1580269065.0,"That's a hard one if we're going for specific combat scenarios:

Long Range: Lockon Stratos

Multi Directional Attacks: Haman, Char, Amuro, Kira, or Puru.

Close Range: Ali Al Sanchez, or Mikazuki Augus

Mid Range: Char, Judau, Amuro, or Ribbons Almark

I'm going for the better half here pilots who are consistently able to fight at those ranges. G Gundam makes it hard to judge their martial artists, and super humans so yeah they can probably do better at close range but what about in all out warfare scenarios? There are plenty of pilots who's data can be used most Char Clones, Seabrook, Judau, Scirocco, Kamile, etc. If we're making drones we need pilots who are consistently able to perform at a high skill ceiling and able to recreate that not just in one instance but multiple ones with proven combat records, or talent."
FireEmblemHeroes,ffvmhqi,t1_ffs8nhm,1580267614.0,I still feel a bit bad I got azura but I already had her with her best iv set so even if I got Lyn I could've at least fixed her IV Bane atk stat.

todayilearned,ffsh6hk,t1_ffsca2p,1580181610.0,Steve is above peak human but he is human. He can be killed just like Batman could who is just peak human. The difference is Batman has outsmarted actual gods because he's batman. Steve is better in actual physical combat.

FireEmblemHeroes,ffpo3hw,t3_eueqcr,1580100032.0,I'm really curious what they would've done if Hector won the first CYL? He'd probably not be the lancer armor we have him as today.
FireEmblemHeroes,ffpnxvi,t1_ffotmz2,1580099904.0,I did my part for team corrin back when we had the unfortunate nature to fight Ninian in the semis.
grandorder,ffpnmvm,t1_ffpc1db,1580099653.0,I'm pretty sure I remember him even fighting his instinct a bit and going easy on us. Didn't he act reckless around the ark.

grandorder,ffpnd7u,t1_ffpe2a4,1580099437.0,Neither am I but I still say its worth a shot. It has actually significant difficulty. If not that its relatively easy to grind once you have auto on a map.

movies,ffpn2ur,t3_eu9atl,1580099204.0,Interested in seeing where they take it. The ending to the matrix was pretty final from what I remember. Not the biggest fan but I'll consider giving it a shot.
GBO2,ffjza41,t1_ffjkjor,1580011073.0,Better than dp at least.
Gundam,ffjkh3b,t3_etedyz,1580000285.0,Honestly great game BUT I feel it was way to repetitive it lacks variation. If you don't like dynasty warriors I would suggest heavily think about getting it since a lot of it is hack and slash on repeat.
AskReddit,ffj2737,t3_etts4s,1579988529.0,If you can take it you can make it. If you can overcome whatever issue you have in that given moment you'll have another chance eventually to have a better day.
Gundam,ffin9b8,t1_ffhm3s1,1579977948.0,"He also rebounds back into his Quattro phase by the end of the series turning into protector wind so he manages to overcome his self loathing in order to protect his sister, and to remember his old friend."
GBO2,ffiml46,t3_etmvh3,1579977483.0,"I'm not a big fan of it the standard doesn't match my play style I lean more to the Kampfer, Alex before that. That being said it can be a very solid suit if played correctly, otherwise its a slightly better act zaku."
GBO2,ffi35hk,t3_etm4zl,1579963717.0,Act zaku because it carried me through d to b. 56 sorties I think. 96 sorties in the gunner gundam because it murders on port. And the efreet is because 300 350 it murders.
Gundam,ffgelrn,t1_ffgegsz,1579904507.0,"Hathaway literally gets attached to a character many people hate, and ends up gunning down a pilot who was attempting to save his life. Not saying Chan is best girl or whatever she is rather undeveloped all things considered but Hathaway flat out team killed a fellow soldier in the middle of a colony drop situation."
Gundam,ffgedqw,t3_etccya,1579904365.0,"Out of the lot I'd say Shinn but I'd honestly say CCA Hathaway, or Gyunei."
Gundam,ffe4u7d,t3_esfnnp,1579836731.0,"Emma was a pretty solid character but I don't think I'll ever get into all the bizarre romance angles, and especially fucking Reccoa. The better part of Zeta was its later half when Kamile somewhat matured as he had seen combat, and kicked around a bit. I'm in the vast minority but I'll never lie when I just don't like something."
Gundam,ffe4mzp,t3_eslka5,1579836581.0,"Wing has a lot of narrative issues and really bizarre choices in character interactions. A lot of its cast can be liked by vastly different people. Some like Zechs, some like Duo, and others like Heero. Its an average anime at best that suffers from many different flaws but its commentary of drones has aged fairly well. I personally really like Treize Khushrenada. I just wish it could've been a bit more coherent."
Gundam,ffe3s3s,t1_ffbq2vr,1579835943.0,The thing is by the end of the series he wants MORE of that. After being shoved into the AEUG conflict in Zeta he seems almost insulted he wasn't going to immediately be the one to pilot the MK 2. He clearly does still hate it but I feel that trauma just turned Amuro into a soldier for life.
FireEmblemHeroes,ffdxfwr,t1_ffdr9bc,1579831331.0,Those were just off the top examples eirika edelgard hilda Marianne Petra nino and others are still there in the bracket.

funny,ffb4ssh,t1_ffb4izc,1579751799.0,"That's just due to his circle being different than what you're use to I would assume I can say the same about Tudyk. Mercer is not just a voice actor but also sings occasionally for jobs, and does DnD stuff for Geek Sundry or whatever they're calling themselves now."

FireEmblemHeroes,ffa9ntt,t1_ffa9jqv,1579730597.0,"She has fans but like we both said three houses, and other stuff have come out since the last poll. Girls like Marianne, Hilda, Edelgard, Petra, and others have rather large followers especially among newer players."

FireEmblemHeroes,ffa8cd0,t3_es8a9u,1579729858.0,I mean there's a chance but Marth is probably going to get at least 2 he has not gotten the brave alt people have wanted for him since the first gauntlet and now multiple highly popular lords are out of the running.
FireEmblemHeroes,ffa7m44,t3_esgfhr,1579729449.0,"While Loki would be a very interesting choice I'm not too sure how much support she'll get since Three Houses are out, and people still want brave reinhardt, marth, seliph, etc. She'll probably make the top twenty at least I'm sure and that's low balling."
grandorder,ff97u9p,t3_esahgn,1579706863.0,"For real though I see some of the ridiculous box farming numbers of some people and wonder how they do it. It just doesn't seem healthy to be farming the same node, even for whales, for literally the whole day. I watch tv, play other games, and other gatcha's even to spread out what I do. I farm what I feel I need, maybe some extra if I really need something and then take a break. Excess farming just seems unnecessary when most of the time I just default to Waver, or Merlin and whoever I need for that specific map."
GBO2,ff96doe,t1_ff5lz7m,1579705913.0,I think the GMP is best in the abandoned city at 350-300 levels it can provide covering fire with its cannons while still being able to fight passably at mid range. There's very few suits that are remotely comfortable at close range in terms of supports at that range.
grandorder,ff7nxio,t1_ff7n72h,1579654085.0,I just want to say that not even bond 10 herc carried me through all the way to Camelot personally bond 10 herc is just the icing on the cake you can do more than just guts stack for days. Regardless I'm honestly not to interested in debating this. He can pick whatever he wants I just wanted to see if there was some big mass of comments about the ticket after last night on here.
grandorder,ff7fwqz,t1_ff7f80s,1579648623.0,Pretty much why I recommended Herc boss if you want to talk about Helena talk to one other guys.

But the only ones I have at bond 10, as a player since launch, are Herc, Cu FS, Emiya, Raikou, and Jeanne Alter. Granted I use a lot of my servants too. Guys like Waver, Merlin, Altera, Artoria, Ishtar, etc are at least bond seven."
grandorder,ff6fowg,t3_eruzh5,1579626190.0,"For real one can head canon what they want though. There are a few events that let you consider what might have happened if anything. For example Fergus's, and Jing Ke's valentines ce's are the most obvious of those you can. So unless they explicitly say something, like how the MC's is in fact Asian in Salem, or just want to ignore that one mention one can think of whatever they want. It is a game at the end of the day."
