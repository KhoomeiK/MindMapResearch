todayilearned,ffmee0f,t3_eu5wt2,1580053310.0,"I think open concept office spaces are the next step in trying to slice off another little bit of our humanity to make us more efficient drones. I'll explain.

1: Open concept saves on rent by cramming you into a smaller space. Don't let the modern amenities fool you. Your chairs are harder, your desk is shared with 10 other people, and when you stretch your arms you may hit someone else.

2: In many of these offices you don't even have an assigned desk; you just find one that's open and start working. Therefore, you have no personal ties to anywhere in that office. No memorabilia, no pictures of your kids, cool posters, your signature water bottle, etc. When you get up and leave the office is unchanged without you. Only what you produced has the opportunity to be remembered; you are a placeholder.

3; If everyone is able to see everyone else in the office, then everyone will be pressured to work in the same way as the most ""productive"" employee on any particular day. Any breaks, even for reasonable amounts of time, may be counted against you. And not even by your managers, but your coworkers betraying you to kiss ass to people who (see point 2) likely just see you as a placeholder."

For as long as I can remember, people line up to hook up hoses to water fountains to fill up their pools, water their lawns, take showers, everything they need it for. People just took water and just froze it and melted it over and over again for fun because they could just *have* it. This is why water shouldn't be free. People will just take advantage of it."

It's a cut in productivity, but we get a tax benefit per employee, and if one of them die then it's a much lower cost to pay off their family (we calculated it's a 28% chance the pool of ""applicants"" we pick from have a family, and most accept a negotiated settlement of less than $500, which can be garnished from the new ""employee's"" pay.)

We hope you understand. You have 24 hours to collect your belongings and leave the premises. Until you fill out your employment termination exit interview documents (EETEI-17 and EETEI-41, both 6 pages long) and wait the appropriate 6 - 12 weeks for our response/rebuttal, your last paycheck will be held, and may not be released if we do not find your documentation satisfactory.

Before, many would just drown them in vices and suffer in silence.
