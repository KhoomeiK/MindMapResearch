SS13,ffwq26y,t3_evgwtm,1580308229.0,"There are basically two main versions of the game: current gooncode (which pretty much requires industrial espionage to get ahold of) and various versions of the game based off a 2010 release of gooncode, with TG-code and Bay-code being the two most popular ones. There are other codebases out there, such as Eris-code (or whatever the various Star Trek based sergers use) that have some impressive features such as multi level station capability. 

If you’re looking for the original, the closest thing is either old Goon code or some 2003 based ss13 code and honestly; there is very little point to trying to reinvent the wheel by redoing years worth of progress. 

If you’re looking to get into coding or running a server, my recommendation is TG since they’re usually open with their code and they have people contributing to it constantly which offers you the possibility to integrate the work of others into your own codebase. 

With that said, TG’s current coding staff are notorious for making unpopular decisions about the gameplay direction of their existing codebase. It’s essentially a good code base that is increasingly being ruined by poor administration, and an excellent code base for a server if you’re willing to restore content that was removed."

politics,ffwal4t,t3_evhinf,1580292628.0,"A few key points:

* Palestinians do not have any airspace under this deal, literally putting them under Israel’s control as permanent Israeli control would be legalized under this deal. 

* The deal does not address water rights, and previously Israel has treated any omission in treaties as authorization to continue the current policy. The current Israeli policy with water rights is that settlers are free to drill wells wherever they want, destroy Palestinian infrastructure, and receive IDF protection if they get surrounded by Palestinian farmers while trying to cut down their trees.

* The treaty does not contain provisions repealing Israel’s unequal status regarding criminal prosecution. Under the current state of affairs, no Israeli can be tried (or even arrested) by Palestinian law enforcement while Palestinians are frequently arrested outside Israeli territory and tried by Israeli courts. 

Without key changes to those points any proposed Palestinian “state” is a place where Israel controls all borders, has total control of water and Palestinian usage of water, and where an Israeli can commit any crime against a Palestinian without repercussions as long as Israelis are okay with it.

The early system of government made the runner up the Vice-President (and capable of breaking ties in the Senate), kept the Senate reasonably non-partisan due to Senators usually being chosen by State legislatures, the only form of mass media was newspapers and there were relatively few barriers to starting up a small newspaper, and the popular sentiment that emphasized a connection to one’s own state made the idea of a national party placing its own interests over everything else somewhat hard to achieve. 

While we had political parties, those parties were far from monolithic or disciplined. They were in general agreement about a majority of issues, but for most of American history it was quite common to see more differences within the parties themselves than between the two dominant parties. For example, the Democratic Party of the 1940s had Adam Clayton Powell Jr, William Levi Dawson, Strom Thurmond, and James Eastland in the same caucus. On the other side, you had Republicans like Thomas Dewey, Nelson Rockefeller, and Richard Nixon in the same party.

It wasn’t until we entered the age of television, talk radio, and one corporation being able to own a vast amount of the limited airwaves that we say the laying of the foundations for “Party over country”.

Banks and other financial institutions usually close down the accounts of known fraudsters, pass the information to Federal authorities and other financial institutions, and pass the cost onto consumers/recoup losses through insurance/etc. 

These people work in groups, they identify a retail chain where store policy allows them to operate, stay a few hours in a given town to pull off their scam at the various retail outlets that were already identified, and ideally they’re across county lines before the stores even close in the town they targeted. You can spot these people all the time in budget hotels along major highways; typically it’s a group of about 4 to 6 men and women whose relationship with each other isn’t particularly clear, they don’t have any tourist accouterments, and they’re all pretty low key (which is understandable given they they’ve been working all day and there’s nothing exciting about traveling for them since they do it all the time). 

What usually does them in is when someone gets police attention for something else like expired tags or running through a speed trap and all the various federal warrants pop up when police run their ID through the system.

politics,fff3c66,t1_ffevd1p,1579874586.0,"I would argue there is a massive gap that Republicans have to overcome, and that gap is only getting bigger. As the boomer percentage of the overall electorate has gotten smaller, the trend has decidedly tilted to favor the Democrats. Perhaps the best way to illustrate this is to look at the weakest states for each party, in Hawaii  the Republican Party is essentially a third party whereas the Democratic Party in Wyoming is several times more effective in representation. Both parties are weak, but the Hawaiian Republican Party doesn’t even have 10 elected officials combined at the State level.

In California and New York, Democrats dominate their state governments to the point where they almost have a permanent supermajority. A decade ago, such a thing was practically inconceivable. Change is happening, it’s a gradual process but the results are there.

From what we’re seeing with Republican performance in elections, when Republicans win they are winning by razor thin margins and only in places where they’ve been in power long enough to tilt the odds in their favor. They aren’t gaining ground in key states, and when Texas flips in a few cycles it’s going to be practically impossible for a Republican to be president without the Republican equivalent of Bill Clinton coming along."

SS13,ffbskd0,t3_esqff6,1579781150.0,"Arguably, the best location is already there. Renovate the Aloha Snackbar. 

There is already plenty of space to set up a nice establishment, you’re between engineering, medical, and science so you’ve got plenty of potential customers if you want them. As for how I’d do it:

* Step one: get some lights, space cleaner, an airlock painter, and materials to build an airlock, tables, and floors. Basically you want to get the place looking presentable. 

* Step two: install your equipment, wall off some of the rooms and corridors directly north of Aloha Snackbar and integrate the space into your bar. Devote some of the space to floor space for your patrons and some of it to more back room space to store your bar’s extra supplies and materials. 

* Step three: get some customers. If you’re looking to be the hub of maint dwellers, reroute the disposal tubes to the south with an exit, an empty space, and then a disposals entrance so garbage stays in a pile but people can choose to resume their disposals trip or visit your area. 

* Step four: help other maintenance merchants set up around you: plenty of space for a black market doctor or drug farm in the rooms to the left of Aloha Snackbar. They can provide you with a community and keep things interesting. Assuming there is a collective garbage pile to scavenge from, they should do quite well.

As for construction tips when building an hospitality establishment that may be raided by security:

* Make the internal layout of the place difficult to navigate directly to your location. Tables should be arranged in an almost Tetris style pattern to prevent there from being a direct line from the entrances (you want an entrance on the west and on the south) to your barkeep station in the eastern side of the establishment.

* Place windows next to both sides of the doors/airlocks (the south already had windows) to enable you to see people coming before they open the door. This is more important than a lot of people realize. Entrances should both be double airlocks, to avoid bottlenecks.

* Your bar serving station should have a wall or two in its layout, to allow you to quickly duck behind it when you see a sec goon walking to the entrance with a taser or laser in hand. 

* If you’re feeling particularly cheeky, fiddle with your doors and attach a remote signaler to a wire (or wires) of your choice on all of your doors. It’ll buy you time to make an escape through the secret exit in your back room.

* Your secret exit should ideally be a corridor entirely separate from the corridors used to get your bar, a one square hiding space behind a false wall next to the back room with a disposals systems in the back room itself that leads to space (getting your pursuers killed if they assume you flushed yourself), or a disposals tube entrance hidden behind a false wall. A simple hiding space behind a false wall isn’t terrible, but strongly consider dressing a dead body in your freezer with the same clothes so pursuers might assume it’s you."

As for people supporting him, not every position that Trump gets behind is necessarily the wrong position. With that said, Trump’s incompetence usually does more harm than good.

Regime change in Iran was essentially Phase 3 of the Bush administration’s plans in the Middle East/Central Asia. They hoped that a successful invasion of Iraq (where the country transitioned to democracy according to plan, without sectarian bloodshed or an insurgency) would result in an wave of liberalization movements across the Middle East (and particularly in Iran). 

Given that the Saudi leadership at the time were cautious about using military force abroad, betting on Iranian change from within was a sensible calculation. 

Nowadays, there is a Saudi leadership that has no issues with occupying Iran indefinitely if America knocks out the Iranian conventional military Gulf War style (which American can absolutely do). 

It’s important to keep in the mind that Saudi Arabia is a Sunni Arab country (like virtually all Muslim countries outside of Iraq and Iran), and that most of the countries in the Middle East are far more threatened by Iran than Saudi Arabia- Iran’s allies are basically Syria (a country where a Shia minority rules over a Sunni majority with terror) and a bunch of Shia terrorist groups. Even the Iraqis aren’t willing to ally with them militarily. 

As for your fear that the Saudis would commit atrocities to quell an insurgency, that is pretty much guaranteed (just about any military that isn’t from a highly developed country quells insurgents through heavy handed repression). It’s no different from what Iran does when dealing with domestic opposition.

Faced with the threat of a Sunni Islamic Revolution, the Saudi royalty opted to try to essentially buy indulgences from their religious fundamentalists.

Toppling the Iranian government would do more to take the wind out of sectarianism than anything else: Al Qaeda’s biggest recruiting tool is videos Iranian sponsored forces carrying out violence against Sunnis. 

Step 1: Destroy the conventional military forces of the largest sponsor of terrorism in the region. 

Step 2 A: Does a provisional government promising elections and a new constitution overthrow the existing government and request a ceasefire?

That kind of “whatever we Republicans support, Democrats must oppose” mindset is typical of Republicans, but it doesn’t work outside the small pool of Republicans who repeatedly elect charlatans and hucksters because they said they loved America, family values, and breathing air. 

Combined with Trump’s mishandling of the situation -didn’t inform Congress, but did inform multiple foreign governments- there are plenty of reasons to withhold support for Trump even if you agree with the basic principles behind a military response to Iranian provocations. 

Had a similar terrorist attack to 9/11 occurred under Trump, he would accuse Nancy Pelosi of cheering for the terrorists. One of the fastest ways to lose credibility is tell a bald faced lie during a time when the whole country is paying attention (as opposed to just the Fox News crowd)."

We’ve moved from denial to “if only America hadn’t increased tensions...” with breathtaking speed, as if Iran didn’t start this whole thing by repeatedly launching attacks on bases in Iraq in an effort to kill Americans.

At the rate we’re going through the narcissist’s prayer, brace yourself for all the eventual Iranian astroturfing claiming that those people deserved to die."
WarCollege,fe22cgv,t1_fe0fzmz,1578833755.0,"Interestingly, the concept for Red Wings was initially done by the Marines and they initially only sought to use Special Operations aviation assets in their plans for Red Wings. It was only after they were told that Special Operations ground forces would have to included (in order to get the aviation assets), did the Red Wings we all know start to take form. 

As originally intended, Red Wings was a continuation of a reasonably successful strategy that folded the intelligence gathering capabilities of special operations assets into a battalion sized combat unit."

You ever work at a business where the owner was poorly informed, yet wielded absolute power over the organization? It’s a lot like one of those, right down to the constant turnover in senior management as people in charge quit due to constantly being countermanded by the owner.

There are several different interest groups (similar to how cliques or factions will form at a business), and they’re all vying for Orange dummy’s attention. Given that this is the government, there are literally dozens of different interest groups within the Executive office alone. 

Catch Trump at the right time, make a good pitch for your idea, and he’ll sign off on whatever terrible idea you’ve proposed. The trick is to carry it out as quickly as possible before someone else gets to Trump and tries to stop you. If it goes badly, he’ll later deny involvement and try to blame the rest of the company’s management for it. 

In the case of the Soleimani strike, the consensus is that it was the most extreme option presented of an array of possible responses to Iranian aggression and Trump chose it because he thought it might take attention away from his impeachment. We should be grateful that the military didn’t put a proposal to kill the Ayatollah on the table."
worldnews,fe1sual,t1_fdva4j1,1578830447.0,"> It's not like Iran was just sitting there one minute and open firing the on aircraft the nexts.

That is exactly what happened. The Iranians had the flight plan of PS752, and the idea that a lone American missile would suddenly materialize in the middle of their country (flying away from their capital no less) is at least unrealistic enough to attempt to get confirmation of the target. 

Had they bothered to check their own air traffic control system, used additional radars to determine the size of the object in question, or redirected fighters to get a visual confirmation they wouldn’t have killed all those people. 

It’s understandable that civilian deaths occur, as the Iranians are the only people who exceed the Saudis when it comes to military incompetence."

The family separations, the month long government shutdown, the new tax code, the multitude of mass murderers praising Trump in their manifestos, and his latest food stamp cuts have all hit people across the country personally. Prior to 2016, it was easier to write off Trump’s failures as simply part of doing business. 

When you’re forced to work a month without pay because the President was too stupid to ask for his wall to be funded at any time between 2016 and 2018 while his party still controlled Congress, you remember that."

It’s worth noting that Bernie Sanders generally doesn’t run negative campaigns or engage in nasty attacks. He doesn’t have much in terms of political skeletons in his closet, there are very few (if any) votes in his past which are a liability for him today.

It’s not as if they were simply sitting in the gulf one minute and opened fire on what was presumed to be an Iranian aircraft the next. 

Given the escalating situation And previous situations where Iran sent aircraft to attack navy vessels that crossed into its territory, it made sense to presume that an aircraft headed for the Vicennes was part of an Iranian military response."
politics,fdpg5o6,t1_fdors1q,1578627762.0,"The thing is, the military has options to genuinely stymie Trump’s requests to bestow awards on war criminals if they really wanted to. 

For starters they can ask for any order to go through proper channels (and not hold the President’s hand), Trump would have to ask the Chairmen of the Joint Chiefs via an NSC meeting, present the order in writing, work his way down the chain of command, and any sort of technical mistake in the order could be grounds for rendering the order invalid and requesting it to be corrected and reissued.

Secondly, they could adhere to the principle that they’re legally required to refuse to obey any executive order that contradicts their service’s regulations without a preceding executive order that nullifies the relevant regulations barring compliance with the order. While the President has the power to set policy, he does not command the military by decree. 

The military can be obstinate if they want, but there are far too many officers who have failed take their oath to defend the constitution seriously."
