smashbros,ffj6xbe,t1_ffiv6a2,1579991922.0,"It only absorbs ""energy"" (fire, electric, lasers, aura, anything glowing afaik) and only ""projectiles"".  So Pikachu's down-b you can absorb, but ganon's jab or link's arrows you can't, even though the former is electric and the latter is a projectile."

keming,ffdd4kn,t1_ffcffem,1579818358.0,"I think the response was referring to the ""doormat"" part rather than the ""communist"" part.  It isn't really a mat if it's made of stone."
keming,ffdd0jp,t1_ffcmy7n,1579818289.0,"Makes sense.  To my knowledge, Chinese and Japanese are almost always monospaced."
