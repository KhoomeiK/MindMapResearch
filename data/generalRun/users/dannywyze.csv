amibeingdetained,ff7w5jl,t3_emfd6n,1579659785.0,What is “Deceived consent” I’m thinking they mean Perceived consent.
amibeingdetained,ff7v6hn,t3_eomttq,1579659122.0,“A signed wedding signature”!? These people don’t even know what they’re saying. They print that BS paper offline and go out and get themselves arrested.
AskReddit,ff60ipz,t1_ff60c4h,1579615986.0,Oops.
Fitness,ff5ujyn,t3_eru3ri,1579610749.0,"My fitness pal, map my fitness. Are both good apps. If you’re not worried about muscles and you are, in your own words, bony then cardio is always a good option. If you run outside both the mentioned apps can track your distance and estimate the calories burned. If you go to a gym the treadmill will do that as well. The apps can also track calorie intake as well. (Always stretch before running no matter how young you are)"
AskReddit,ff5t9lv,t3_ertq21,1579609404.0,(-40F - 32) * 5/9  = -40C. Thats the conversation formula. And it seems to work so ya it’s odd for sure but interesting.
AskReddit,ff5rz8t,t3_erthyc,1579607971.0,"Large Prawns w/ fresh made pasta with a pesto sauce. It was in Florence, Italy with my Girlfriend at the time she is now my wife."
cringe,ff2usma,t3_eok4fb,1579524997.0,It’s kinda cringe at first but the dude kinda nailed it. I hope he got the job.
AbruptChaos,ff1vrny,t3_er67rg,1579487280.0,I thought something went wrong at first.
onejob,ff1ve07,t3_eqytex,1579487031.0,It’s just an Air Force uniform. They are just the space ops people who used to be assigned to the Air Force are now in the Space Force. Not even Pilots are in the Space Force they all stay in the Air Force. No new bases or really anything is changed it’s all a publicity stunt.
justdependathings,fezpads,t3_eo6dqj,1579459959.0,The cashier was totally right. It’s really the military that puts these idea in family members heads. At every function they have the spouses stand and say how their job is the hardest. It’s not at all and before I get hate. I’m saying it as both a veteran of the military and now a dependent spouse of an active duty military member.
Cringetopia,fez9rxo,t3_eqwsru,1579455112.0,A mind numbingly obvious troll post. “I might die at the hands of anime god”!? Wtf. Outed in the very first comment as a troll with a link to this post and has been removed already. So ya good job bringing the cringe... it’s you.

metalgearsolid,fdi1l13,t1_fdi1b6q,1578434115.0,No it doesn’t. The white boarder between the PS4 banner and the art is odd. Also the rating and the fox logo aren’t even. It looks wrong all around.
metalgearsolid,fdi15zv,t3_eli42h,1578433902.0,What are they asking? I’ve never heard of this ever being released but that art by him can be printed offline I know.
memes,fddnv79,t3_ekubsz,1578319029.0,For all those memes saying people that play COD are “ready for WW3” you’re not. They’re not thumb wars.
