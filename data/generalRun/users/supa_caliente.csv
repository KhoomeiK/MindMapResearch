AmItheAsshole,ffcqxuy,t3_essrci,1579805410.0,YTA. Big time. You should really figure yourself out. Insecurity issues because of your cousin’s vibrant hair? Really? What an odd thing to take issue with. I’m glad you showed your family and your fiancé your true colors.
JUSTNOMIL,ffcpcek,t3_esvvsa,1579804351.0,"Next time your JNMIL tries to squeeze anything from you guys (because it will happen), be sure to send her a screenshot of this email. Honestly, that’d be my go-to. She tries to get in contact at any point? Send a screenshot of the email. You guys get a “why won’t my son talk to me?? I’m his mom!” Send the email. There’s no way she can talk her way out of that"
AmItheAsshole,ffbew7f,t3_esos54,1579762304.0,"YTA. He’s old enough to listen to what he wants. And honestly, you really don’t have the authority over this. Even more so after your wife told you it wasn’t your place. The only thing you’re accomplishing is building up his resentment towards you. Leave the decision making to the birth parents, who are very much in his life. This is not your lane, OP"
AmItheAsshole,ffbele7,t3_esohok,1579761951.0,"It doesn’t matter if you borrow money from him frequently. I bet it’s safe to assume you have always asked him beforehand. But this time, you crossed a major boundary. It also really doesn’t matter that you sent him the money through Venmo immediately, either. It was a violation of trust and personal boundaries. Truthfully, I wouldn’t be surprised if this changed your dynamic slightly. Now your roommate will be thinking twice about what he leaves lying around and if he should keep his door locked when he goes out. It’s going to take some hard work to rebuild his trust. You owe him a major apology. YTA."
TwoXChromosomes,ffbdd3h,t3_esoiew,1579760568.0,"I can’t use tampons or pads anymore, no matter what I do or how frequently I change them, they always leak. I’d definitely recommend looking into getting a reusable menstrual cup. I was also really impressed with the brand Softcup and their disposable cups. Definitely another option to consider if you don’t want to immediately splurge on a reusable menstrual cup"
