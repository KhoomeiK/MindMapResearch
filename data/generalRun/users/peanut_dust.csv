I have to say, Android leaves a lot to be desired in terms of reinstalling all settings as they were prior to factory reset.  Somewhat poorer experience compared to Apple, i would say.

I noticed that my note 10+ had stopped fast charging in the past week or so.  Went through all the software options including full factory reset when i updated to One UI 2.0.  No real improvement in the fast charge so i concluded it was a hardware issue.

I have just quickly put the Dyson to the charging port for a quick second or two and lo! Note 10 fast chargeth again.
