What you can do is try and get her to redirect her gifts by telling her what you ACTUALLY want.  I suggest experiences or consumables.

Or if there's an upcoming event that you'd like to go to, talk about getting tickets for XYZ.

MakeupRehab,ffjgrlj,t3_etl2um,1579997907.0,"Last year (before I realized I had a problem), I bought several (over 10) palettes that were under $10.  Many under $5 because I""m a bargain hunter at heart.  I was going to places like Burlington and TJ Maxx (the latter you can find good deals at).   Even going directly for the clearance section at Ulta without passing go and collecting $200.

When I did my inventory and declutter in December, every palette that went bye-bye (after one last use to determine her fate) was a sub $5 one.  The quality and pigmentation wasn't there, especially compared to the Colourpop monochromatic palettes I paid $8 (sale) for.

There are some great lower-cost brands out there (Colourpop comes to mind) that put out a good quality product at a low price point.  I do like Primark makeup (at a price point lower than many drugstore products).  But the difference between them and drugstore products is that Primark has testers available in store (whereas CVS or Walmart does not) and they're (house brand at least) cruelty free (a deal breaker for me).  My HG foundation is Primark.

But now I have learned my lesson which is not to let bargain-hunting get the best of me.  If I see a pretty palette for $5 and I can't swatch it, I will go online and look for reviews of it.  If I can't find reviews, it's most likely a shitty quality product.  There was one recently at 5 Below that had a pretty color story, but I knew (never heard of the brand) that is was probably patchy at best."

Unless plastic bags are banned in your area, even if you give them up, people around you won't.  One of your friends will probably have plastic bags lying around.  So why not use someone else's waste.

My tip for keeping the grocery budget down is meal prepping.  I make double of any recipe I make and utilize my freezer.  I have meals frozen in family (a few days for me) and individual serving sizes.  

Also learn a few meatless recipes that you like (even if your family are carnivores).  My grocery bill went down when I went vegetarian.  [Here](https://bitesofwellness.com/vegan-mexican-rice-and-lentils/) is a vegan lentils and rice recipe that is tried and true (for me).  I stretch this even more by adding bags of frozen veggies ($1/lb at Wegman's) to it.  I got easily 14 meals for under $1 each.  In fact I stretch every recipe I make with frozen veggies (makes it healthier too).  

Lastly how much of your grocery budget is drinks (with or without alcohol)?  Learn to drink tap water (pennies on the dollar) with every meal instead of juice/soda/bottled water/etc.  If your water isn't that great, a $20 Brita filter is an investment that will quickly pay for itself."

What helps is air between the clothes so there's airflow to help dry them.
