ApplyingToCollege,fei0p1m,t1_fehydc3,1579127744.0,"Cool! I chose my school for a few reasons:

* Size - I knew I wanted something in the 500-1500 per class range
* Location - Was more interested in rural

ApplyingToCollege,fehoxbp,t3_ep7uji,1579120949.0,"Nooooo. Do not bring notes to the interview. As an interviewer, I'd find it very odd and likely ask you to put them away so we can concentrated on our conversation."

dartmouth,fefx8e8,t3_eoy8mi,1579068201.0,"I can try to address these bit by bit, but some of this feels like really serious oversight/lack of research on your part.

* The quarter system, and with it the D-Plan, is a huge part of what makes Dartmouth unique. Yes, it can be hectic, but you get used to it. 

* Can't really say the DartHub is outdated. It was updated about a year and a half ago, and having worked at other universities, it could be far worse. Also, this is one of the most minor issues I've ever heard anyone raise about a school

* Not really sure what you mean by this one. Some classes will have the ability to see your grade as the term progresses, others won't, but you can always ask the instructor to discuss your grade

* Definitely no grade deflation, what makes you think that? The average GPA is a 3.4something

* Yep, there's a lot of involvement in Greek life, and this is something that is well known about Dartmouth. Having seen Greek systems at other schools, I have a lot of stuff I like about how Dartmouth does it. Obviously there are issues to continue to address, but overall it fares better than most I've seen
