can't blame you for wanting to be able to text your bf. In this day and age most people prefer text than call. This seems to be a huge issue for you so you brought it up multiple times, but based on your story you didn't seem to be overly aggressive or threatening about it. It also helps that you offered to buy a phone for him versus making him deal with it himself.

On the other hand, bf is not the AH for having a preferred method of communication too. No one is wrong here, you just have to figure something out that suits the both of you."

I get why you'd be more proud of John than Hannah. At the end of the day we're not perfect, and as much as you want to love your children the same, you can't help how you feel sometimes. Everyone has their own definition of success and John's life just matched your definition more closely.

I think what you said was hurtful to Hannah, but i don't think it's totally your fault since she asked the question. Its not like you offered this information on your own will.

People on this thread saying that Hannah is a product of how you raised her are jumping to conclusions. There's nothing in the post that suggests that, and i don't think it's fair to call you an AH for information we're missing."

Given your history and relationship with her, you two are generally comfortable enough to mock each other. This seems like a one-off scenario that would've been hard to foresee, and afterall you meant no harm.

She's obviously not an AH for being hurt by your mockery.

People saying ""she already told you she was insecure so you should have backed off"" clearly haven't experienced a relationship where you're comfortable enough to mock each other in good fun.

That being said, at the end of the day you did hurt her feelings so i think you should apologize, and don't mention to her that you don't think it's a big deal etc."
