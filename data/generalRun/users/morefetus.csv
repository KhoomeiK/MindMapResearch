personalfinance,ffruuvo,t1_ffrcjrl,1580166349.0,"These large banks do not need you. Therefore they do not care how they treat you. However a small credit union will usually give you much better customer service, because you’re a part owner. I’ve even had my credit union call me up and ask me if it’s OK to cash a check I wrote to someone, because it looked suspicious. They also called me up before paying a bill because it was going to result in an overdraft and they gave me a chance to deposit some more money before letting the transaction go through. And you would never get such consideration from a large bank."

personalfinance,ffqradk,t3_euoa87,1580141817.0,"Use a credit union or online bank like Simple or Ally.  The best thing about a credit union is that you are part owner. You actually own shares, so they are more likely to have your best interests in mind. You can also elect the board members.

So healthcare is inadequate to deal with the crisis. Transportation has been shut down. Even gas stations have run out of gas. The government is not communicating affectively or honestly with its people. No one knows the real danger of this coronavirus or the mortality rate or how it spreads because they are not being informed. He makes an appeal to the international community of Chinese to put pressure on the Chinese government to be honest, open, democratic and free. He says he wants democracy and freedom."

I do not think you need to declare bankruptcy but I do think you need to go cash only ASAP. You can cut up those cards or freeze them in a block of ice in the freezer. And then pay off the highest interest-rate first ASAP.
