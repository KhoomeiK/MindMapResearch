Also, assuming this is the case that just happened, they arrested someone about an hour ago for it. I have a friend that lives nearby as well."
UnsentLetters,fctafta,t3_eir9ku,1577937251.0,"I'm so so sorry for your loss.  


I wish it had been available when my dad was dying as well, it would have helped him tremendously. I think about this a lot when I see advertisements for it."
DestinyTheGame,fcsqfgj,t3_eilv31,1577922492.0,Congratulations - that ring is so pretty!
offmychest,fcs8e1c,t3_eikr29,1577912889.0,Congratulations!
offmychest,fcpadjj,t3_eibdao,1577856050.0,And to you!
offmychest,fcnp1ga,t3_ei13oi,1577815715.0,"Glad you had such a good experience and hope you have more!  


I'm with you on the french kissing part, just not a fan of it!   
 Cuddles though are amazing!"
raisedbynarcissists,fcl9i6w,t1_fcl2ddq,1577742731.0,"The really hard situation, especially in medicine. A name change could help, as could a state or country change, if that's an option for you.  


I know you have loans but you could try and defer them further and do a doctors without borders type of thing for a few months to a year and build your own reputation and relationships that way if your field of study works for that sort of thing. Or depending on your field look into working for a private corporation or global company that needs in-house doctors, psychologists, etc - hard to get those positions but could be worth looking into if your family doesn't deal with those directly.   


Either way, best of luck with medicine and getting away from the family as you can! You have a lot to be proud of even finishing up medical school and hopefully you'll get a great position somewhere that suits you and is away from your nparents."
offmychest,fcl7x9b,t3_ehobx5,1577741741.0,"Glad you contacted CPS, keep on top of it (call again if things remain the same, etc) because things can and do fall through the cracks especially if you live in a highly-populated area with limited CPS resources.  


You're a good friend and just good person for contacting them, don't feel bad at all - better to do it this way since she can't find the will to leave (which I get, it happens) and save the children from more abuse and god forbid anything worse. Not sure the state/county but a lot have systems in place that if they end up in a foster situation or similar she may have to leave him and do some classes/counseling/etc before gaining access to the kids again which will benefit them all in the long run.  


Hope it works out for them & again, good on you for stepping up and helping the kids!!"
destiny2,fcbt4rr,t3_egwp51,1577590677.0,Looks awesome! This could only look more accurate if my guardian's body was smooshed below it.
Damnthatsinteresting,fbt209g,t3_eeba5a,1577066192.0,That's a really clever idea! If my pets weren't all jerks I'd attempt something like this.
