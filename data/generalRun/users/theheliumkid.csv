linuxquestions,ffur8nu,t1_ffuq94p,1580247810.0,"The problem is that each games is a bit different. I don't think there's any question that a Linux native game will be faster than Linux + Proton. But Linux/Priton vs Windows might not be quite so clear cut  some games will no doubt be a bit worse but it seems some might be slightly better. Ultimately, for those where there is a (small) performance hit, it will depend on how you like to play and the nature of the game. I think my point is that Proton is, by and large, a viable solution.  Here's another piece I googled.

linuxquestions,ffu9di7,t1_ffu60ku,1580237230.0,"This is probably the most important point. Beyond this, performance differences are relatively small and tend to favour Linux if you are not using Wine to run Windows games. I'm not sure about Steam and the client using Proton for Steam Windows-only games, but this report suggest that even there, Linux does better.
