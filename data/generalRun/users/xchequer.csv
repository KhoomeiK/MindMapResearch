ProgrammerHumor,ff2yqz3,t1_ff2tv6e,1579528892.0,Right on. If you are paying that much in rent then you are  living beyond your means. It would make sense to get a house where your mortgage +taxes +insurance is about $1500 and build from there.

Christianity,fepw4nq,t1_fepgsyv,1579333409.0,Bear in mind the other mentions of creation and the flood in other scripture is a reference to the scripture in Genesis. Also you have to bear in mind that the references to creation in Genesis were not original or unique. They were part of Jewish folklore which borrows from folklore from other places that preceded the mention in Genesis by many years. The Jewish folklore version would have been the most recent at the time.

Christianity,fepmenc,t1_feph5jk,1579324354.0,"There is so much complexity about life that is not covered in the bible and could never be as you would require millions upon millions of texts to cover that. But because the Bible does not get into the intricate details of life does not mean that God had nothing to do with it.

There are observable truths that no one can deny. One if those truths is that we are adaptable beings. Adaptation is a core concept in animal and plant life and in the theory of Evolution. It really demonstrates how intelligent creation really is. To deny this is to deny truth in my mind."

youtubetv,fe3p7p1,t3_enpev9,1578851565.0,"I was on Hulu live for quite a while before switching to YTTV. My biggest issue with Hulu was/is how many clicks it takes to get to what I want. The menu was not customizable and the landing page was always account > recommendations I never cared about.
YTTV is far better in all those areas plus the standard unlimited DVR. It also has a far superior sports experience which is huge for me. Switching between games during the college football season was easy. I would argue that it is the best experience out there. Yes, even better than the ol cable/satellite experience."
