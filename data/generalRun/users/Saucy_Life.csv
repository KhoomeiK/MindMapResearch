AskReddit,fetwclk,t3_eqfgfg,1579380678.0,"Joker and 1917. Not just saying that because they are recent but they both did things I really like. You can tell the amount of effort, care, and ORIGINALITY that went into these movies. 

Joker- Just a goddamn masterpiece. Doesnt even need to be comic book movie. Doesnt really feel like one either. The writing, cinematography were all great. Had no clue where the story would go, which can be bad, but in this case it was good.

1917- Very realistic cinematography and what not. Maybe I havent seen a historically accurate movie in a while, but the action in this movie was simple yet emotional. A guy running has never been so intense. I believe this is due to how everything seems to be done in one shot, one take. Action doesnt always need quick cuts. 

They both give you a lot to look at and think about. I feel like a lot of movies these days rely heavily on ""classic"" movies and their troupes/plotlines so every movie feels the same and not try anything too original. At this point I just want to be entertained, so if a movie goes beyond that Im fairly happy."

depression,feg13f8,t3_eophbs,1579072421.0,"First off, goddamn, Im sorry you had such a rough childhood. Secondly, fuck family. That word has lost meaning the older I've gotten. No my family hasn't put me through what they did to you, but in the end they're just people. Family means something to some people, but very little to a lot of people. If they dont care about you then you shouldn't focus on them at all (mainly talking about your Aunt here).

I wish I had answers for you bud. My life is in shambles too, but one thing I did notice that you're able to do and Im not is: recognizing your achievements and potential. You mentioned being proud of losing weight and also your good grades. Focus on those things again. I know you have reasons for letting those things slip, but get them back at your own pace. You know you have the power to do so. Basically, all in all, your goal should be to rediscover your self-worth and love yourself. 

You said you're a lover of anime. How many characters have crazy stories like yours? A ton of them. I do think it sucks that many of them get over their struggles by friending someone that cares about them unconditionally but if you've seen enough anime, I know you've seen characters that fought their way up from a rough childhood to some position of power all on their own. Hell, their personality might be super positive too, not even giving any hints that they suffered 15-20 years of their life. That could be you!

Take this time to reflect. Did she always treat you like a best friend? You think of her as your best friend but did she think the same of you? Was she good to you? 

I just ask that, because throughout highschool I considered one of my friends my best friend but looking back I was treated like a second tier friend, and it was obvious he preferred others than me. I guess I pushed through and ignored those truths.

depression,fefry56,t3_eorigf,1579063429.0,"Honestly, you just went through my fear of telling my dad my same depressed/suicidal thoughts. I dont think I'll ever tell him. One, he has dismissed all my feelings in the past and he does this thing where he is always able to make me feel guilty for feeling the way I do. Two, he wont understand and will think Im being overdramatic. So I hide away all my feelings day to day and he just thinks thats who I am. Kinda sad, he should know that Im not the same, that Im sad most of the time, but he doesnt. 

Anyway, just because he doesnt understand doesnt mean others wont. Open up bit by bit to those you trust. Your dad is an emotional roadblock. He cant help you through these dark times. Im on this journey too, so I dont have the answers. Find your own way through this whether that be other people or life changing actions. Good luck, friend."

Joker- Just a goddamn masterpiece. Doesnt even need to be comic book movie. Doesnt really feel like one either. The writing, cinematography were all great. Had no clue where the story would go, which can be bad, but in this case it was good.

1917- Very realistic cinematography and what not. Maybe I havent seen a historically accurate movie in a while, but the action in this movie was simple yet emotional. A guy running has never been so intense. I believe this is due to how everything seems to be done in one shot, one take. Action doesnt always need quick cuts. 

They both give you a lot to look at and think about. I feel like a lot of movies these days rely heavily on ""classic"" movies and their troupes/plotlines so every movie feels the same and not try anything too original. At this point I just want to be entertained, so if a movie goes beyond that Im fairly happy."

depression,feg13f8,t3_eophbs,1579072421.0,"First off, goddamn, Im sorry you had such a rough childhood. Secondly, fuck family. That word has lost meaning the older I've gotten. No my family hasn't put me through what they did to you, but in the end they're just people. Family means something to some people, but very little to a lot of people. If they dont care about you then you shouldn't focus on them at all (mainly talking about your Aunt here).

I wish I had answers for you bud. My life is in shambles too, but one thing I did notice that you're able to do and Im not is: recognizing your achievements and potential. You mentioned being proud of losing weight and also your good grades. Focus on those things again. I know you have reasons for letting those things slip, but get them back at your own pace. You know you have the power to do so. Basically, all in all, your goal should be to rediscover your self-worth and love yourself. 

You said you're a lover of anime. How many characters have crazy stories like yours? A ton of them. I do think it sucks that many of them get over their struggles by friending someone that cares about them unconditionally but if you've seen enough anime, I know you've seen characters that fought their way up from a rough childhood to some position of power all on their own. Hell, their personality might be super positive too, not even giving any hints that they suffered 15-20 years of their life. That could be you!

Take this time to reflect. Did she always treat you like a best friend? You think of her as your best friend but did she think the same of you? Was she good to you? 

I just ask that, because throughout highschool I considered one of my friends my best friend but looking back I was treated like a second tier friend, and it was obvious he preferred others than me. I guess I pushed through and ignored those truths. 

It hurts but time will heal. If youre in school still you should join a club or something to make new friends. Idk, hope all goes well for you."
depression,fefry56,t3_eorigf,1579063429.0,"Honestly, you just went through my fear of telling my dad my same depressed/suicidal thoughts. I dont think I'll ever tell him.

Two, he wont understand and will think Im being overdramatic. So I hide away all my feelings day to day and he just thinks thats who I am. Kinda sad, he should know that Im not the same, that Im sad most of the time, but he doesnt. 

Anyway, just because he doesnt understand doesnt mean others wont. Open up bit by bit to those you trust. Your dad is an emotional roadblock. He cant help you through these dark times. Im on this journey too, so I dont have the answers. Find your own way through this whether that be other people or life changing actions. Good luck, friend."
