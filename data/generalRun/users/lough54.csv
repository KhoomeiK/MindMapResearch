Targeting civilian women and children for fun? If there were any justice in this country, he would have been court martialed, stripped of his rank and sent to the brig for life. He's not a war hero...he's a cowardly murderer. Those men who blew the whistle should be promoted or rewarded for showing leadership and risking their own careers and safety."

dogs,ffgnbst,t3_etd5f7,1579910242.0,"So sorry about your ex. It would not have taken me 3 trips to the ER. Totally agree with you. I have spent a life time working with all kinds of animals, esp dogs. No animal is 100% safe. Probably no human either. What with inbreeding and mental deficits and poor or no training, any dog can go off under the right circumstance... with no prior history. Owners have a responsibility to control their animals at all times and protect them too. If you can't do that... don't have an animal."

I carry a cattle prod and bear spray. A freaking miracle we weren't injured more than we were. Animal control couldn't do anything until a second or third reported attack!"

news,fehfba9,t3_eold7v,1579115361.0,Thanks for info. Another question: with all the aid and 2 jobs she still couldn't survive? Does China not have free medical or care for disabled? I just assumed communist countries did. Tragic situation.
howto,fefqd5y,t1_feey0tz,1579062212.0,"Yes probably veneer. Could be over particle board, mdf, or lumber core ply. If you are feeling confident and frisky... and are handy and have tools...you could slip a palette knife under the veneer and rough  up the underside of the veneer with a little sandpaper or xacto knife. With a syringe or a pallette knife, get some yellow glue in there. Looks like you'll have to use a couple of C clamps on either side of the table to hold a 2x4 across bubble for compression until it dries (couple hours in warm space). Be sure to wipe up excess glue asap... and use wax paper under 2x4."
