They go into certain recovery rooms. You clearly know nothing about sterilization standards."
dogswithjobs,fg6hm83,t1_fg6bzpk,1580568206.0,"I guess the dental world is different than hospitals, so a quick google search tells me that the CDC sets the standards for dental office sterilization and infection control, and I *think OSHA enforces it.  Regardless, The thing is when sterile instruments and/or environments are in play, and people are receiving injections or getting cut into, I don’t think patients should have the right to decide if they want to have pets around because there are bigger issues at play. It’s a medical office. There shouldn’t be pets on or near the equipment. With them being on top of a patient, they could cross contaminate all the equipment nearby. Pet hair could get into the hand pieces, dander could get into the air hose, etc. I realize these might be long shots, but the things is...if it could happen, it probably will happen eventually. Bottom line, animals are filthy, and if I’m going to sit in a chair and get a tooth pulled, or a needle injected into me, I don’t want to have to worry about if a dog was sitting there 30 minutes ago.  If you want to go to a dentist office with dogs crawling on the equipment, fine, but they better make  ALL the patients aware that dogs are on the equipment, because I think they deserve the right to choose an office that adheres to a more strict practice of sterilization and cleanliness. I for one would report this office to OSHA, and find a different dentist."
