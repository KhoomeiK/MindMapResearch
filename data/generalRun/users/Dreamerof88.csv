ArthdalChronicles,ffl71ga,t1_ffkc98z,1580035712.0,"Yea I heard about it too. Idk why celebrities would still do something morally wrong knowing that they r public figures. Their lives aren’t their own!! Hahah. But people change, people grow, so I hope each and everyone will learn. 

I am also looking forward to season 2. It will likely take awhile but it will surely come. It was said they signed the contract. 

I’m just thinking, that by the time a new season come out I would have forgotten much of the details and would have to either win it or rewatch. Plus, I wouldn’t have the same feeling as right now.

I truly hope, despite all this drama we would get to see something this fall."
ArthdalChronicles,ffjvl26,t1_ffj81ix,1580008154.0,"If the Nweantal still rule the Plains of The Moon, the Saram can’t move in to do agriculture. Plus, they would be the Saram’s greatest enemy. They don’t just fear the strength of the Nweantal, but the attitude as well. If people start following how the Nweantal lives, the Arthdal wouldn’t have their town and nation.

The Nweantal do not have greed and vengeance like the Saram; and seem they can’t be control with religion. They were hunted to almost extinction but the remaining ones doesn’t seem interested in revenge. They also would not turn against each other, as you see, they weren’t killed from the inside. They were poisoned and then killed because a spy could not be planted. 

Look at the Ago tribes. Idk if Eun would ever find out who Red Claw really is. 

You really should go re-watch."
ArthdalChronicles,ffj7gnk,t3_do3x7w,1579992296.0,"Ipsaeng said it was 1,000 years ago that Inaishingi was spat out of the waterfall."
ArthdalChronicles,ffj0idl,t1_ffiv5xe,1579987308.0,"Of course they know!! But she’s a pure Nweantal. The last known female, which I think is absurd and not likely. Mass genocide in unknown territory is unlikely especially in a jungle like Plain of the Moon where Nweantals have lived their entire lives. They know the up and down, and how to navigate it and make use of it to their advantage. The chance of survival out there is pretty high. If you watch the clip of how Igutu came to be regarded as bad luck, there were many Igutu meaning at one time the Saram and the Nweantal got along. There ought to be a couple who blend in with Saram or can go and in and out without notice. 

The prophecy should be taken as just foreshadowing. One curse already came true, so I believe we can bet that the prophecy would also hold true. 

They met Eun and passed Saya. Who knows if Rottip will ever tell the twin of their parents history. I think everyone has the right to know about their parents. Sadly, no one ever bother to tell them of their parents—not even Moo-Baek. I kinda wonder if Eun even know Arthdal is the home of his mother and he’s part of the Asa Clan. 

Life itself is a bunch of melodramatic back and forth. It’s a mystery and that’s what make all shows interesting—because nothing is obvious or clearly said. I think the director did a great job at creating suspense. It’s theories until we see the theories unfollow within the drama. So far this isn’t a soap opera I am annoy at."
ArthdalChronicles,ffiu7b4,t1_ffi2zt5,1579982829.0,"No. They didn’t know she exist until they met her. They were mixing in with the town folks and witness the scheming of mankind. Why? 

Rottip clearly said they were looking for someone, when Moo-Baek asked what they were doing in Arthdal. He asked if they succeeded, Yiseuroobeu responded that “they will, soon.”

Yiseuroobeu looked over when he said it, but I think he wasn’t referring to her. 

I’m rather curious, if showing us that the two Nweantal saw Chae-Eun and Moo-Baek means they follow Chae-Eun to find Nunbyeol."
ArthdalChronicles,ffik138,t1_ffhtywg,1579975718.0,Hope you’ll like it. I had put it off for so long that when I actually sit down and watch—I can’t stop binging it.
ArthdalChronicles,ffijy1l,t1_ffhtxwr,1579975660.0,"What? But there were a few confirmation that the show is gonna go on. Why would any actors not want to be in the second season? The filming set is kinda gruesome with so many actions, but the acting is pretty well done.

Who wouldn’t want to be on a team with such amazing talents and skills!"
ArthdalChronicles,ffhqqvj,t1_f0xtzme,1579948902.0,"And he truly care about his town and his peers,  but I still hate him. He had no empathy for the slaves and probably have little compassion for people outside of his circle. 

Just look at how he and the others call the Nweantal who were much stronger. It’s a lack of respect to culture and people lifestyle."
ArthdalChronicles,ffhqkgg,t1_f1q2m8f,1579948622.0,"No, Yangcha was already like that when Tagon was shown in the first episode."
ArthdalChronicles,ffhqbb9,t3_d7srxx,1579948234.0,It was shown in Ep18 ending clip the coming of the unknown civilization that destroy Remus!! The shield found with the man on the beach has the marking!!! And the Momo tribe will be the first to meet them!! The comes the war. We just don’t know who is waging the war against whom!!
ArthdalChronicles,ffhq1x1,t1_f1d9di2,1579947826.0,I think he learns his lessons. He didn’t run and return in the following episode.
ArthdalChronicles,ffhpzo5,t3_d8a91p,1579947731.0,It doesn’t matter. He is the second coming. The story will just help him and make his journey smoother.
ArthdalChronicles,ffhpvyr,t1_f1lz453,1579947573.0,"The problem isn’t if he is this or that god. It is, who is the horse? How long has it lived? Why was it there when Eun was first betray?"
ArthdalChronicles,ffhpqyr,t3_d8wqpw,1579947361.0,Anyone got a theory on who the Nweathal is looking for??
ArthdalChronicles,ffhpq7l,t1_f1d8h3q,1579947331.0,I think they are distant cousins. Tanya ancestor is an Asa. The twin’s mother is from a lower branch of the Asa. They are all cousins. Very distance cousins and should be able to copulate.
ArthdalChronicles,ffhpmjl,t1_f3fu3u8,1579947174.0,I thought she was saying bless Tagon. I thought she is a spy. But who exactly where that bird is going to—season two get here soon!!
ArthdalChronicles,ffhpfos,t1_f1dudpx,1579946879.0,"If you saw the clip telling of the Hae’s fallen city Remus, you’ll see that the man found on the beach has the same shield as those destroyers!!

I think it’s the unknown group and so Momo tribe was the first to meet and be defeated. But it shows one solider, so maybe not. It could probably be the opportunity to learn more about them."
ArthdalChronicles,ffhp7q1,t1_f16xn2i,1579946538.0,But she haven’t met Eun and doesn’t know Saya has a twin. The mirror and sword isn’t as obvious as Tanya who is now the owner of the bell.
ArthdalChronicles,ffhp656,t1_f0nqzk4,1579946468.0,Saya is very dark. He‘s like Tagon. But still I wanna believe that meeting and knowing Eun will help him see a different side to life. That they can work together.
ArthdalChronicles,ffhox55,t1_f0lswia,1579946084.0,"No I think he will have to live else the mirror wouldn’t exist. It would no longer be a mirror if it can’t reflect. Saya needs to be alive! But this make sense if both Eun and Saya are the mirror, and Nweantal girl is the sword. Why else would she be taught the sword? I have to go back and check, but if he found her during the hunt, she could be born on the comet day."
ArthdalChronicles,ffh6d1j,t1_ffg9a2v,1579924356.0,"Yea, It’s probably a side story. I wonder if this would bring encounter between the twins and the Nweantals. Season 2 is so long away. 

I believe that’s not it. They said they were looking for someone when they met the female Nweantal!! From their conversation and attitude that wasn’t it."
rant,ffepwoc,t1_ffebhum,1579859559.0,They doing that to CA as well. But they could because our government allows it.
ArthdalChronicles,ffejcou,t3_do3x7w,1579850396.0,"Confuse, confuse. Rottip doesn’t look five. So he must not have been one of the three babies, but rather a toddler when he was saved. It could just be that they couldn’t find appropriate children to cast and went with whatever they got. 

But honestly, the timeline makes the people way too old for any actual physical fighting. What if the three were not 20? There has to be some time lapse from when the Wahan tribe was captured and enslaved to when Tanya gain power. Maybe when all this started they were barely 18. 

For year 0, it was said that Tagon was barely a young man, so maybe around 13. The rest should be under 20."
ArthdalChronicles,ffej4ob,t1_f6cp85n,1579850124.0,They could have just done some make up to add in age.
ArthdalChronicles,ffeiwfv,t3_djvokg,1579849850.0,Draw one of the Nweantal!!
ArthdalChronicles,ffeiv21,t3_dp3avl,1579849803.0,"I didn’t even connect the dots. But the dream was super sad. She couldn’t give up the child, and so it took the father. But what if she gave up the child? Would Ragaz manages to evade death? 

She was also afraid for her life. The scenes was too fast. Am not sure if she was afraid of death or really did everything for her child."
ArthdalChronicles,ffein3z,t3_duvzrh,1579849542.0,"If she grieves, it wasn’t shown. She couldn’t have gone after the baby and not be noticed. She believes strongly in the prophecy. 

I am rather more sad for Eun since he grew up with a half crazy mom who doesn’t tell him any of his history. He didn’t understand why his mom was so crazy about going down the cliff and then when she died, she still didn’t tell him anything; but a strange necklace, telling him to return later when the stuff on his back had shedded. Where would be returned? How would he returned? That’s is why all this happened. 

Then when he met Rottip, the guy acted like he knew him, and yet just walked off. That moment where he stared at his own blood—it was screaming where do I belong? The Nweantal didn’t give a shit and the Saram hate Igutu. It’s painful to learn that your dad is a monster and your mother ate the forbidden fruit. 

I really wish that the writer would actually find the moment for Rottip to explain to the twins their history. I wonder who Rottip is looking for anyway."
ArthdalChronicles,ff8eaep,t1_ff7pfv9,1579674836.0,Mmmm...I think I read that info somewhere. I guess I must have mis—read it.
ArthdalChronicles,ff8e4y6,t1_ff7pnds,1579674667.0,"It could be. Even a good person can be used, but I get it. I wouldn’t question much if someone I trust gave such things to me too."
ArthdalChronicles,ff6su5v,t1_ff5ox4k,1579634165.0,"It suddenly pop up in my head, the Nweantal are strong strategic fighters. They should be on alert and should know not to accept such gifts!! They aren’t rats! But then, Nweantal does not seem to record their knowledge and that’s what made them lost. The Arthdal has records of many decades. 

I think the creator made the Nweantal too stupid. A few should be able to understand they shouldn’t underestimate their foe. It would be amazing if the second season has the come back of the Nweantal. Imagine a couple blending and living in Arthdal to learn the way of defending against their enemies! Meanwhile, their stronghold is elsewhere. Yisroob just haven’t met them yet! Haha"
ArthdalChronicles,ff6b57a,t1_ff5ox4k,1579623332.0,"What? Tagon and Ragaz are half brothers? Tagon’s been raising his nephew without knowing and almost kill the other one!! Ah geez. 

Didnt Sanung say that Tagon attempt to kill his mother? What’s that suppose to mean? His step mom or his biological mom. Why did he take back the kid and not let the kid stay his mother?"
ArthdalChronicles,ff5m1eb,t1_ff5ko7g,1579599550.0,"Then wouldn’t that make Yisroob pretty old? He’s like even older than Tagon!! But then it would also explains why he know Ragaz and couldn’t recall who was Asa. I would love to know what happens for Yisroob to be one of the five male survivors. In my logical mind, he would have been the leader leading whoever is capable away to safety. 

Where was it revealed that Mutrup was Ragaz’s mother? Gosh, because the director left out the culture of the Nweantal that there are so many puzzles. The fact that Eun and Saya are half Nweantal should make it worth while to show more of the Nweantal. The genocide doesn’t quite make sense to me. The Nweantal can’t be down to just five survivors. An entire species, especially one as strong as the Nweantal can’t be erased by just 10 years. I’m quite puzzle. The leader seems wise and quite stubborn with his no, why would he accept the goods? I would never find this answers."
ArthdalChronicles,ff5jl8t,t3_d5kl7b,1579595927.0,"Issroob is most recognize to pop up in the later episode, but did he also shows up in the first episode too? Part of the four that went to the cliff for “alliance” meeting?"

Yea that anxiety that things could go wrong. I usually just mind talk myself into believe that nothing will go wrong. Even if it did...well, I’ll deal with it when it did until focus on building safety net and trying to find ways to be happy as I am."

Getting anxiety during the day is horrible. Idk how I would function if I had anxiety during the day. I had them when I was in middle and high school—it was not good knowing I can’t run. 

When I was stressing about my new work, I had to take sleeping pills with my cold meds to help me sleep through the night. It helped me sleep deeper so I would wake up feeling less tired."

Maybe I made peace in my dream. I hope you find ways to defeat your fear of life and keep walking. It will be a constant battle. It is okay to feel weak and tried.

Yea depression makes you feel like shit. Anxiety makes you struggle more than other. But don’t mop about it and say it set you back.
