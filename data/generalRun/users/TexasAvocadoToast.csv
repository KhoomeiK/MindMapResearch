AskReddit,fghoajw,t1_fghnwg3,1580789477.0,"Absolutely! I love it so much, I cancelled my Audible because 14.99/month for a book I'd only listen to once or twice was not great. They also have digital copies of books, not just audiobooks but e-books too that you can export to your Kindle app or read straight in Libby. 

You get each loan for 21 days (at least at my library) and you can always return them early. I think you get 10 at a time but since you don't really need to get so many at once I only check out one at a time. It's super convenient, it's free, and best of all it's books!"
AskReddit,fghnitc,t1_fghmn5b,1580788929.0,"I use an app called Libby that lets you put in your library card details and it gives you access to check out a boatload of online books and audiobooks for free, it's pretty sweet. If you have a library card or can get one, I highly recommend the audiobooks for the series, they're really good and although her voice is hard to adjust to at first it suits Katniss very well."

AskReddit,fghmajx,t1_fghg3se,1580788072.0,I just reread these books and I absolutely love the characterization of Katniss and Peeta in the last two books. Peeta is holding strong for the most part but falls to pieces when he gets rescued in Mockingjay. Katniss is totally and completely mentally ruined by so many different things- the books genuinely show how it destroys her and how she suffers from it instead of glossing it over. Wonderful

We have a lot of safety checks in place at my clinic but... they age out at 12, from us. They go on to somewhere else, where who knows what'll happen to them. I love my little kiddos, and the idea of someone hurting them absolutely crushes me"
TrollXChromosomes,fg2ammx,t3_evpne0,1580441477.0,"Protein shakes are wonderful honestly, they're really nice for a meal that doesn't feel like a meal.

AskReddit,ffsmevj,t1_ffs9d3q,1580185395.0,"As someone who works with kids on the spectrum... Yeah. Some are ridiculously smart, logical, and incredibly good with memorization, but they're not savants, that's not a symptom of autism. They're not all intelligent at something, some of em are normal people. They're wonderful kids and I love them with ever fiber of my being, every ounce of my brain, but some of them will never be 'normal' and it's so much better to accept them where they are and help them improve than to expect savantism from them when they struggle to achieve age appropriate tasks :("

Vincent Nigel Murray in Bones. 



I love that show even though the last few seasons were... Questionable at best... 


But like, c'mon, the kid gets shot in the heart for no reason and it's the first time since Zach got sent away that Brennan shows any emotions towards her interns. It's so painful and it obviously crushes her, and that whole episode had me sobbing. It led into some good storyline, for sure, but I literally gasped when he got shot and was so surprised- he was obviously her favorite and her prodigy, her apprentice, and then he just ... dies."
