CanadaPolitics,ffhxl1c,t1_ffhcw9y,1579958302.0,Seems like a PM is pretty 'managerial' in role
CanadaPolitics,ffg6152,t1_ffg34tj,1579899214.0,This first one is a thing though. The corporate veil doesn't protect deliberate illegal action and those in charge can be prosecuted for it.
CanadaPolitics,ffdlfps,t1_ffd425j,1579823378.0,"Are you afraid of answering what to think are useless degrees? 

If you can't even back up the argument you are trying to make, what's the point in debating with you?"
