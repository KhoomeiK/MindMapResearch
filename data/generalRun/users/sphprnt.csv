Anxiety,feru59x,t1_feroy7i,1579358369.0,The thing is that the place thats easiest for me to get to is the on campus clinic and they only do same day appointments. Its really stressful for me to try call and try to squeeze a time into my schedule when they regularly run late with the doctor appointments.
