AskReddit,fcku6aa,t1_fcja1p8,1577733266.0,"Your post reminds me of when I was about fourteen, and I used to ride horses. The lady who owned the barn was old and had a son who did a lot of work on the farm. My dad asked if I wanted him to get to know them better since the son would own the farm one day, and specifically asked about inviting him over for dinner. I said no, because I didn’t want him to know where I lived. He used to try and get too friendly with all the girls. In retrospect he was absolutely a pedophile, and I knew he was, but I don’t think I really understood the seriousness of the situation. I only remembered the whole thing when I had a flashback after seeing him at the county fair a few years ago. I wish I had understood and said more to my father back then."

All the blood testing is also exhausting as I’ve had to do a lot for a seemingly unrelated joint issue. It has hit a point where I really can’t afford it. I have imaging of my joints I still need to get done and more testing for that. It’s been so expensive."

I’m on anxiety medication that helps a lot. But I found that I quit my favorite hobbies and haven’t taken up any new interests, haven’t been participating in things I love at all. Feeling kind of empty. But I’m not sad, or upset—I’m actually pretty content and happy most days. There’s nothing “wrong” per se. I’m trying to just put a smile on until I figure out what’s up."

It’s not a big deal, there will be other parties, but I went to all of his holiday parties for his friends, cooked and bought us outfits and put in lots of effort. All he had to do was show up for my friends’ party, and he couldn’t even do that."
