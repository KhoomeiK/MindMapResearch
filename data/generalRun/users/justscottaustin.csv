funny,ffgn4l0,t3_eti87m,1579910104.0,Not even a little.
Austin,ffgj7gz,t1_ffgj0qw,1579907475.0,Right now? Nah. Not really. Sort of in between things for another 5 minutes.
Austin,ffgj46o,t1_ffgimvm,1579907414.0,"They're... they're not?

They're watching what you've become? Wow. Do convey my condolences."
Austin,ffgiiyd,t1_ffghutz,1579907020.0,"Anyone can explain it to you, but no one can understand it for you. Blame your parents and education. Mostly your parents. May they rest in peace."

Austin,ffgh9ky,t1_ffggehc,1579906197.0,"Do you know what a ""bonded pair"" is? I doubt you do until you look it up. It's a very specific phrase with regards to FTT.

See? This was a heart-wrenching tale of lies and betrayal, then ""bonded pair"" was thrown in in such a manner that it just seems to attempt to up the ante.

The story was fine and heinous up to that, but OP couldn't leave well enough alone. He/she had to throw in ""bonded pair.""

Now, see? If this truly were a bonded pair, this would have been an entirely different post, so this was merely added for the heartstrings factor which is unnecessary bullshit and **also makes people who actually understand what that means doubt the rest of the post.**"
Austin,ffgg98f,t1_ffgg1sg,1579905548.0,"Bzzzzt. Nice try, though. Think younger. Better looking. More money than most."
Austin,ffgg7nt,t1_ffgfu4l,1579905520.0,Me? No. I don't really ever report posts. Certainly not dog posts. And certainly not legit ones like this.
Austin,ffgftv2,t1_ffgfagp,1579905276.0,"Didn't think I had to bother. I forgot this generational thing You Millenials have for not minding your own fucking business and answering questions and phoning in on conversations which did not involve you.

Try this next time (spoiler: WORKS EVEN BETTER IN REAL LIFE):

1. Ask yourself ""am I involved in this conversation?""

2. No. The answer is usually no.

3. Mind your own fuckin' business.

4. That's it."
Austin,ffgegm5,t1_ffge0l6,1579904416.0,"We probably would. Doesn't mean you're not an entitled little bitch. I am married to one. Some of my closer friends are entitled little bitches who can't mind their own fuckin' business and think that they **deserve** things. Aka Millenials. Shit... nearly **all** of my wife's friends are **way** worse than her.

It's hard to rise above the way you were raised. Of course, being GenX and inherently awesome, it's not as important for me to try..."
Austin,ffgeaie,t1_ffgdmtf,1579904309.0,"I'm curious whether you know the meaning of the term, and whether you have actual evidence to back up that this is a bonded pair or whether you (more likely) just went overboard with your post when the facts with no editorial would have sufficed."
Austin,ffgde2v,t1_ffgd0ab,1579903748.0,"Don't need anonymous, Princess. If we were in the same bar, I (and everyone else sitting at the bar) would be telling you the same thing to your face, Nancy.

But, seriously. Check #2. Or PM me a pic of the ""ticket."""

Austin,ffgcvj4,t1_ffgbw2m,1579903425.0,"Not at all, and if you think in any way that Adler was the best choice, we have absolutely nothing to discuss.

He is a hypocritical corporate shill sellout who cares nothing for Austin, but only himself and MAYBE his cronies.

 He is a piece of shit. Who is a Democrat. He is a piece of shit with a (D) next to his name."
Austin,ffgbxf7,t3_etgxpu,1579902846.0,"The Weed is still illegal. Carry on doing whatever idiocy you were doing before you heard something you can't possibly understand with the exact same consequences as before in mind.

With any luck you'll be back here in a week bitching about how unfair it is that you got arrested for doing illegal shit."
Austin,ffgb9ed,t1_ffgaq6m,1579902437.0,Those of you who voted for Adler.
Austin,ffgas0h,t3_etfvdb,1579902144.0,"1. Next time realize you are not entitled to park where and how the fuck you want to park. You have to park legally. Don't be an entitled little bitch, and think of others. Spend that 30 seconds to fix your shitty parking job.

2. Ok. Now that we've handled your fuckin' Millenial sense of entitlement, we're trying to save that $75 for more avocado toast, right? Well, are you sure it's a legit ticket? You said it's a private company. Well...then you might not have to pay it. I would check with COA.

3. Or just accept this as your Douche Fine and pay it until you quit being a douche."

>Also, that is some grade-A level of projection right there.

Not really. I mean you guys did elect Adler which is kind of the exact definition of a bag of shit with (D) next to his name."
Austin,fff2bby,t3_eta2ft,1579873781.0,"*shrug* You're a city of activists, folks. At least that's what you tell everyone who didn't care. So. Whatcha do is this...

Everyone starts smoking hemp buds. Immediately. In public. Be damned sure they're THC-less. For every ticket and arrest, file suit against the City of Austin. They're aware _they're not allowed to ticket or arrest unless there is THC_ by state law. Every single time, tell the cop it's hemp, not weed then sue.

Someone needs to post a quick fill-out form to sue the city for this.

Now? This will have no effect if it's just one of two. Get two or three thousand, though, and this becomes an enormous issue."
Austin,ffef69s,t1_ffeerwk,1579845692.0,"Never said it was a **joke**.

Seriously. You should learn to read, though glancing at your history, you seem to just need to mature several years, and you'll be fine, kiddo."
Austin,ffe7nee,t1_ffe61jx,1579838901.0,"Look up the definition of the word ""hyperbole."""
