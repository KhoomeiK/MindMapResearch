unitedkingdom,ffcrsso,t1_ffbmo9q,1579805936.0,"> Frankly, as an outsider, I find the UK government's actions rather cavalier

That's putting it mildly.

> To me, as a foreigner, Brexit seems to be an expression of nationalism, but primarily English rather than British nationalism

It's an expression of anger from those who have been forgotten by successive governments - both left and right. A vote to change the status quo, and roll the dice. Scotland has fewer forgotten these days because they have more local governance, and it seems to be doing (in general) good. I think that's why you see a difference in voting patterns. That's also true of urban vs rural.

England and Wales have large sections of post-industrial rural wasteland economically speaking, and those are the centres of leave sentiment. That's not really about nationalism, but nationalists have piggy-backed on it and turned it to their advantage and we're now heading for isolationism.

In Northern Ireland the equation is different because of the dual nature of NI between the UK and the ROI. If NI was to become part of a unified Ireland, then you're risking a re-ignition of the troubles, but with the other side being the insurgents. An abandonment of NI by the UK government might change feelings though.

> the ultimate decision of Mr. Johnson to throw his Northern Irish unionist allies under a bus to get his Withdrawal Agreement through

He doesn't have unionist allies any more. The DUP are voting against him for exactly the Irish border reasons we're talking about, but since the election he doesn't care.

- Temperatures are normally mid to high 20s centigrade with a 4 degree drop thermocline at around 35m.

self,fednqqc,t1_feb1rob,1579015957.0,"I was on the other end of this a little while ago. I was the straight guy. Honestly what made it awkward was the timid nature of letting me know what he was after. 

Swapping numbers to make plans to go out is something I'll do with with any new friend. Then the texts started that weren't about making plans. They were a little ""vulnerable"" and awkward from the start, and although i felt i was setting a boundary they continued in that vein. 

In hindsight, this is when i should have sought clarity, but i do think the onus is on the person making the advance.  Asking someone you're interested in if they ""are seeing someone"" is basic courtesy, sets a tone,  and is a good opportunity to listen for pronouns. Nothing like that ever happened though, and it was all wishy-washy as a result. 

After disappearing and reappearing over a few months, he finally went for it with some real ""Ewwww"" line (...that I'm pretty sure i wouldn't have gone for even if i was interested) and i just said ""That's not who I am"", and it was done. I made it clear there was no problem, it was flattering even, and I'd have happily been his friend.  At that point I think he was too embarrassed and disappeared (Fair enough. Been there!)

I just feel if I'd known earlier it wouldn't have got so awkward, but at the same time I  recognise that both of us were avoiding being direct because reactions when you get things wrong can go bad. At least I've got a bit more experience if it happens again."
