UBreddit,ffae6qj,t3_esfftt,1579733515.0,"I'm assuming that in a music class attendance is very important. If you can't go any of the classes , find another elective."
UBreddit,ff1p0zw,t1_ff1m2ty,1579482991.0,"yea I really liked Suny New Paltz but I'm happy I transferred to UB because the course-work is more challenging and I feel like I can go more places from UB. That said the other majors besides Computer Science at Suny New Paltz were all really respectable. It's a good environment and everyone is extremely friendly there. But I think UB provides more opportunity than Suny New Paltz. Some of the professors are sexist and have told students straight up that because they are female, they should consider a different major. But I believe that professor was fired. I also think that you could get professors like that at any college, not just Suny New Paltz. If your grades are up there though, really just stay at UB or try Stony Brook. Suny New Paltz (and UA) both have less opportunities than UB and Stony."
UBreddit,ff1fv6v,t3_er30c9,1579478571.0,I think UB comp sci is better but if you are doing poorly consider transferring to UA or a different college. A-lot of people at Suny New Paltz transferred from UB.
