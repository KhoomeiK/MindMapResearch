If you did an oil change on it, the VG33e only calls for 3.5 quarts, not the normal 5ish.

Unfortunately they do not cover anything inside the home. Very few do, with an exception to common things (think roof, sewer main, water main, etc)

Your ownership in the townhome is 100% the inside space. HOA covers grounds maintenance, exterior maintenance, common areas, etc.

Put new caulking around your windows, call an electrician, and call someone who does insulation. This is routine maintenance and is a part of home ownership unfortunately."

If you have the money to pay cash for a new luxury car, then awesome. I see WAY too many people leasing or financing a new Mercedes who complain about how expensive everything else in their life is. Every time someone asks my opinion of what car they should get next, and they’re showing me ads for Audi’s, BMW’s, etc. I have to show them what the payment will actually be, and what repair costs will look like. When I tell them to buy a good used car with cash, they scoff and point out how frugal I am. The very next month I hear them complain about their bills.
