ShitMomGroupsSay,fgmjcrz,t1_fgmaumv,1580925746.0,"I struggle with depression, and have over time cultivated a daily yoga practice. In my experience it can slow the slide into a depressive period, be a lifeline out, improve recognition of mood triggers, and provide a supportive community to surround myself with.

In my case that’s a 10 year evolution. It’s not a magic bullet. 

It’s a helpful lifestyle addition that in combination with a lot of other challenging, ongoing, consistent work makes being depressed a little less shitty for me when it happens.

I feel like yoga gets unfairly thrown out there as a solution mostly by people who don’t themselves have a yoga practice and have no idea what benefits it can or can’t provide. Kind of like how your friend with terrible credit has the most tips on how you could have gotten a better deal if you used gift cards."

1500isplenty,ffdrluz,t1_ffdpmd2,1579827213.0,"Parboil for a minute or two until it’s bright green - it’ll take the bitterness out and keep the color. Get a pan real hot and hit it with olive oil, salt, red pepper flakes, and turmeric. Flatten florets against hot pan. When the florets have browning/char on both sides throw fresh garlic in there and add a tiny bit more olive oil or a little water if the pan is dry. Garlic will be done in 30 seconds - 1 min. Adding the water to slow the cooking will make the garlic a lil sweeter but you want you cook it off before you serve bc soggy shit is gross. 

Anyway TL:DR; this method is what first made me start to like broccoli."

WhitePeopleTwitter,fehwual,t1_feho4cu,1579125448.0,"I have found it critical to keep basic ingredients in stock (celery, onions, carrots, garlic, lemons, rice, potatoes, butter, olive  oil, eggs) which helps with flexibility if I bring some weird veggies home that I didn't plan that well for. Eggs, rice, and potatoes help fill in if there aren't enough ingredients left for a ""real dish"". Celery onion carrot makes a mire poix to use as a flavor base for just about anything. Garlic and lemon give an oomph to anything that is lacking in flavor or may be a little bit past its prime. 

Step 2 is to buy for the week. A few things that spoil quickly like lettuces, zucchini, and tomatoes and a few heartier items that will last until the end of the week such as cabbage, eggplant, and kale."
SkincareAddiction,fehvbdy,t3_eoxqvr,1579124585.0,"FWIW squalane breaks me out like mad. Like, got acne quicker than with anything else I've ever gotten near my face.

So does the CeraVe in the tub (although their Baby version is holy grail for me). Everyone's skin is different. That said, when I went to a derm they told me to use Cetaphil, which also breaks me out, and gave me Differin, which basically gave me chemical burns. YMMV with literally everything. 

What helped me when my skin changed again as I moved to a dry climate and entered my 30's is reading about individual ingredients on the simpleskincarescience blog and following his recommendations for gentle products that do not aggravate malassezia even though I had never been diagnosed with fungal acne.

I only use an occlusive if I'm going to be outside for a long time in dry/cold/windy weather, or if I've just done the TO AHA/BHA peel and have new baby skin exposed. Then Vaseline is a lifesaver because it takes the beating so your skin doesn't have to."
