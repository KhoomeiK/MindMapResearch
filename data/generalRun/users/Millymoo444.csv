PoliticalHumor,ffftj2o,t3_etebqk,1579891473.0,"There are 2 sexes, there are many genders, science doesn’t debunk lgbtq, in fact, there have been many observations of homosexuality among animals, and some animals like the clownfish can change their gender ( though that’s due to situational advantage). As I said before, gender and sex are 2 different things. Sex is when you have either XY chromosomes or XX chromosomes. Gender is who we as humans feel we are. Gender or sexual preference is the same thing as having a favorite food that other people don’t think tastes too good, or how some of us enjoy scary movies while others enjoy comedy’s. Yet you don’t see people hating, casting off, and hurting people who enjoy crab over a hotdog. And some would say that having those preferences is human, and so is homosexuality. There have been gay people for a long time and there may have been more than what we think because so many people lived their whole lives thinking there was something wrong with them, denying who they really were. Your entitled to your opinion but you clearly knew nothing about this matter."
