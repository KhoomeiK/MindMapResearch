IncelTears,ff4kufz,t1_ff3vgat,1579566051.0,"Try to gradually worry less about your looks, cut yourself off  gradually from actual incel subs, try to get invested in a hobby (an inclusive one as to meet more people and develop yourself better, and also a more obscure one if you intend to have better chances at a long-term thing). Gardening is a personal favorite.

Visit more positive subs such as /r/FreeCompliments (sort by new and upvote everyone, please) so you can get a better outlook, both by learning where exactly you stand on shortcomings, and also by seeing how people's days can get better. Try learning to compliment in person while complimenting online. You can also get some compliments for yourself, but don't focus too much on that exclusively. Giving constantly will make you better than receiving a few times.

Get out there more. Both in the internet (please, I can't stress enough just how much incel groups are crab buckets) and real life. Find a type of place you're comfortable with visiting and make yourself presentable. Make small talk with no interests at first. Greet people around you and be someone to listen to. 

Having a positive outlook on your own life and learning how to be a good influence will make you more likable and reliable, which are cornerstones of a good personality. In return, you not only get the benefits of friendship or relationships, but reinforce these new, better core aspects you'll be developing."

However, there's a few stories of folks who boil pump ethanol to drink it afterwards.

This and other cases extreme alcohol abuse pop up at times in my university hospital. There are cases of people who drink perfume and basically anything containing alcohol during a craving fit.

TB only affects a portion of those with the bacterium (which could make up to a quarter of the world population), while malaria renders the host increasingly resistant after recurring infections, especially if it's a weaker strand. Some strands also house themselves in the liver for a late recurrent episode, without the need for reintroduction through a new mosquito bite.

It takes a weakened immune system, and also factors we aren't entirely sure of, for these infections to surface as an actual illness, in the aforementioned situations. First infection with malaria is pretty much sure to cause an illness, at any rate."

blackmagicfuckery,fef3zo8,t1_fef2h9e,1579047636.0,"That doesn't explain why it doesn't occur all at once. The previous explanation was a little closer to the whole truth. The vapor applies pressure onto the liquid, and this determines the ease with which a molecule may traverse from the liquid to the atmosphere. It depends on the liquid and the temperature. If all of the liquid reaches a vapor pressure equal to atmospheric pressure, it boils as basically nothing is holding the molecules back, they have more energy than is required to undo the weak bonds holding them near one another.

At times, some molecules or group thereof will already be carrying enough energy from favorable collisions and heat absorption, and also be pointed in the right way. These can escape the weak bonds holding them back with great ease.

Some liquids simply do not behave this way, as these collisions and uneven patterns of heat absorption do not occur, as the molecules are too big or too peculiar in shape."

It's well constructed in the sense that it presents a blatant lie, as you've researched, in such a way that it seems perfectly believable if one does not know even a tad about what's being referenced. To those who know it's wrong, or those who understand that many satire articles are completely topsy-turvy, it is good humor and a well-made piece, regardless of the reader's background. Sure, some other satirical outlets and writers prefer to walk in parallel with the truth, but going in reverse is also a valid form of satire.
