The only thing that is going to get done here is the usual because, apparently, no game company can see or understand that there's no risk in adding social contracting, and no real downside to it, either, particularly in relation to long-term replayability and community support.

The problem is human nature. So make it worth more to protect than to predate.

This is hardly rocket science, and it's not even without credible reference. But I'll not be posting all those links here because I posted them all there, at that time, and this 'player against mindless undead' thing has been done to freaking death.

They need to DEFINE just and total wars and weight them for risk/reward accordingly.

They need to CODIFY mechanics that take social  contracting (e.g., law enforcement, etc) seriously.

They need to REPORT to players on issues affecting safety, security, and economy.

You know... all the stuff every company on the planet is trying to get a grip on for profit?

Sometimes, it's incredible how the answer is staring them in the damn face and they're too busy resting on the assumption of past laurels to even see it.

Sometimes, if you're incredibly well endowed in environment and evolution, you actually can make a (relatively) secure space in the world within which you can build whatever version of ""best"" you can imagine. 

If you have that, don't you dare waste it. It's an insult to everyone who spends their entire life dreaming of what you throw away.

If you don't have that, don't you dare give up. It's an insult to everyone who doesn't get a choice if you do not make use of yours. 

You are constantly informing the world how you will permit yourself to be treated. Don't thoughtlessly give others permission to injure you.

Because you are here, now, you deserve as enjoyable an experience in this life as any other. Don't spend your self, your time, or your money on those who clearly disagree with this statement.

Save when you can, spend when you must, learn to build something others need.

This is why I said all this tempest in a tea cup over ""right"", ""left"", and whatever other 'dichotomy of preference' you're clinging to, it's a distracting sham.
