I also like to imagine a real up and coming super villain who is really in the weeds on his unbelievably ingenious plan where he on the cusp of being the greatest villain ever and is constantly ignored. So to unwind, in his down time, he invents fun things. He unadrevtidly invents the worlds greatest children’s toy and it becomes the only thing he is known for / remembered for despite his best and constant efforts until the day he dies. In fact the damn toy was never meant to be seen by anybody. But it found its way out to the public my accident of history and oh well you know the rest..."

todayilearned,fgr6gmu,t1_fgqifx8,1581039323.0,"I’m torn about this. I see it as two issues :

Should China be condemned for attempting to repatriate things which were essentially stolen from them, even if it means stealing them back? No, assuming the only casualties are stolen artifacts. Physical harm to people in the process would be a step to far for me. 

That being said - I don’t really care what China does with the artifacts. It seems weird for me to have an opinion about what to do with the stuff we stole from them upon returning. They may sit in private collections upon repatriation but if I were running this scam I would allow the same - get priceless artifact back and you get the honor of hosting it privately for x# years. I mean now that I am really thinking about it, what if these artifacts were all private possessions to begin with ? Just because something is old doesn’t mean it has to be in a museum."

politics,fgnlvq1,t1_fgnk535,1580947665.0,Agreed. I just watched his floor speech. It did feel honest and personal. I hope he finds a way to help kick trump out of office. He should run for the GOP nomination late in the game.
