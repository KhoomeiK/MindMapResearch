AmItheAsshole,feyi732,t3_eqqgby,1579445878.0,NTA -they could have at least gotten the little ones those big ear muffs that protect children's ears at loud events. If you're bringing babies to a movie you gotta have a better plan for inevitable crying than just shushing them!!!
AmItheAsshole,ferwxd0,t3_eqdd5c,1579359174.0,NTA - If the genders were reversed in this situation they absolutely would have honoured your request. There is literally a sign in my doctor's office that states a chaperone is available for female pelvic/chest exams (my doctor is male). So why wouldn't the reverse be true for this situation? That the doc chose to skip the exam rather than accommodate this very reasonable request is very concerning. I'm glad they aren't your regular physician. I would report this.

AmItheAsshole,fdrduj3,t3_emimf3,1578683058.0,"NTA this was thoughtful and observant! Especially if you got her brand/type correct. It's not creepy to me, I would be appreciative, but a lot of women still feel private/shameful about their periods, especially around men, because *society* so her reaction is understandable. I'd just talk with her about it and try to see where her reaction is coming from. I honestly wish putting tampons on the household shopping list was as common as milk and bread."
AmItheAsshole,fdlg0y7,t3_eluqog,1578523226.0,"If Bob's sobriety is so fragile that he can't help but to go through near-stranger's medicine cabinets, then there's no help for him. We can't all live our lives anticipating all the bad stuff people might do to us -no one would ever get out of bed in the morning! You have every right to keep medication that was prescribed to you/a family member in a medicine cabinet and expect that it will be safe there. Circumstances like this can contribute to the opioid crisis, but that's hardly the issue here. Bob didn't get addicted to your wife's meds, he was already an addict and went looking for them. That's no one's problem but Bob's and your family needs to accept that."
AmItheAsshole,fdjwovp,t3_elnmu4,1578489922.0,"NTA - you should terminate if that's what you want. And then get some huge distance between you and both of these families. No one has your best interests at heart here, except you."

aww,fdijr13,t3_elegoj,1578444462.0,"2.5 years ago we adopted a 2 senior kitties -a bonded brother pair who were 10 years old and had been back and forth to the shelter 3 times. Having limited experience with cats until then, I expected them to hide for a while and be pretty shy at first. What I got instead was a pair of barnacles, within 2 days they were glued to me, sleeping in bed next to me, taking turns sitting on my lap, licking my hair. I have no idea why they were returned to the shelter so many times. They are the most darling cats, so affectionate and playful. I can say for sure they will never go back to a shelter ever again."
