When I'm wanting that extra kick to it (even though it's already decently spicy) I add a little bit of their Reaper-Acha sauce to the mix and it really gives it a strong mule kick while not ruining the flavor of the mix. Unlike Da Bomb which just taste gross and is only hot for hots-sake"
tifu,ffcg5lh,t1_ffbt0me,1579798745.0,"The hotter ones still taste good but and they hurt bad. This one is just like ""hot, hot hot hot hot gone...ew, I better rinse that out of my mouth"" kind of flavor. It is weird though, if you can just leave it alone it really does just suddenly stop being bad after a couple minutes. Like someone flicked a switch and the torture is over and all you're left with is a bad taste in your mouth."

I've gotta say, even though they have a few that are technically hotter than it, it has a particular factor I cant put my finger on that just makes it fucking intense for no good goddamn reason.

Basically completely abandoned his old children (us) for his new family. Years later, his whole new family burns up in a house fire except for him and the initial child from the adultery. MY older sister adopts this half sibling of ours that we never met before because my dad obviously isnt a great parent. He now lives alone in a run down house and occasionally one of us will see how hes doing and talk to him because all of that really seemed to change him but we still keep him at arms length because the only version of him we ever knew was a piece of shit, so it's hard to trust this new version we get as adults is genuine or not...

AskReddit,fdmlh9v,t3_em2vfz,1578554424.0,"Dont squeak the floor.

During the day my dad was a logger, which wasn't necessarily an everyday or all day thing. At night he'd go help my grandparents throw newspapers. Almost all other times hed be shitfaced drunk and asleep in the basement. This led to never knowing exactly WHEN he was sleeping.

Now it wasn't ever stated fully as a ""rule"" but if you made the floor in any part of the house squeak even the tiniest amount he would barrel up the stairs and beat you til his arm got tired. So I kind of just unofficially made a rule in my head of ""sneak around the house like a cat burglar playing the floor is lava at ALL times"" just in case. 

It's since led to many, many moments in my adult life where I startle people by appearing near them without them knowing.
