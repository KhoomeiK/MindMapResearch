I herniated six discs in my spine two years ago, and they're above the size and medical issue limit for my insurance to pay for one. I had really hoped that they would shrink naturally, but even when I was 130-150 lbs for years they were huge. :("

So I start calorie counting and trying to be more active, and I lose 20 pounds! Then, I go in and get my boobs measured to buy some new bras, and I've gone up to a 40 F! Wtf???

This is super dumb, I'm don't with this. Idk why you care so much, good luck in life."
TLCUnexpected,fevnlnz,t1_fevljlu,1579399400.0,"I don't know her, I watch her videos so when I see somebody making a statement she's addressed in one, I comment. My name is Bella, I live in Wyoming, I've never met McKayla, hope, or Chloe. She talked about how she's in therapy in one of her recent videos.

I really don't understand why people talk about her so much if they don't watch her videos. She addresses a ton of the points on here in them."
TLCUnexpected,fev2dvk,t1_feuzdt2,1579392319.0,"Lol my name is Bella, keep reaching though. This is an area I really sympathize with her though, as I've had similar experiences with PTSD, depression, and anxiety. I watch her videos and her insta stories, which I know a lot of people here don't, so I try to bring that knowledge.

Playing into it though, want to pay for my tattoos?"

TLCUnexpected,fekpucn,t1_fegan5l,1579205120.0,"Her grandparents don't approve. She has a medical marijuana card, from her doctor, for her PTSD. She goes to dispensaries and buys mostly marijuana Vapes and gummies so that the kids don't smell it or get affected by it. She's stated all of this in videos and on her stories.

TLCUnexpected,fe0906l,t1_fe07tk6,1578806408.0,"If you're neglecting your kids to smoke, that's different than just smoking."
TLCUnexpected,fe02xt6,t3_enidnx,1578801751.0,"Not saying anything specific about McKayla because I don't know how she reacts to it, but when I used to smoke I was a far less anxious person. It was way better for my anxiety than medication, which had a tendency to make me mean and overly teary. When I smoked I was able to be far more rational, and it helped me keep things in perspective. There's also a difference between smoking a little weed to calm you down or increase your appetite than getting stoned. It's all about how much you do, when you do it, and how it affects you.

Speaking about McKayla though, we've seen that her anxiety definitely affects her behavior. I think it would be reasonable to believe her when she says it helps her be a better mom by helping with her anxiety.

Side note: Marijuana is not a gateway drug. It is not addictive (unlike alcohol or tobacco) and if she's going to a dispenser, shes not in situations where people would be trying to push other drugs on her. I don't see this leading to a drug problem like her mother's."

twilight,fbwhgm3,t3_eet16m,1577150032.0,"I moved to a new school that was roughly the size of forks in high school, and people pretty much treated me the same as they do her.

I even had a Lauren, one girl hated me because everybody else was curious about me. 

By my second year it had worn off, luckily."
