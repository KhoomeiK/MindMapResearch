AskReddit,ffk6pu6,t3_etv2i0,1580017681.0,"Not a parent but an aunt.  My cousin had told me to watch his boys and they were four and five years old so I thought it would be nice since I didn't have school and I knew that being a single parent was probably hard for my cousin. When I was taking care of the boys, I put some movies and I went to the bathroom, when I came back, they were seeing who could pee the farthest and the carpet smelled like pee for hours even after I had cleaned it and then I got in trouble when my parents got home"
