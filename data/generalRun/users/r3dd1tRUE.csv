slowcooking,ffyu88g,t1_ffypsjf,1580355264.0,Cooked a pot roast. Shared it with room mate. Except he ate all of it. Made him buy me another one. Cooked it. Left it out all night and not in the fridge. Ugh.

Is that a better summary?"
todayilearned,ffh1lvg,t1_ffgg92u,1579920671.0,"In New Mexico, people say locusts when they mean cicadas. It's just a misnomer that I'm used to hearing. I kinda forget locusts are actually grasshoppers until I read it in a TIL like this."

todayilearned,ffh0riq,t1_ffg1dmg,1579920030.0,So all locusts are grasshoppers.. But not all grasshoppers are locusts.
todayilearned,ffgtzch,t1_ffgnqog,1579915008.0,"Thanks you for the confirmation.

I figured that's where the mule gets it from- the donkey. Most of my experience is with horses. I've ridden mules, I love em. But I've never spent much time around a donkey. I didn't wanna act like I knew about the donkey even though it's just Reddit."

AskMen,ffgrcp0,t1_ffg82s2,1579913097.0,I wanted this show to be brilliant mind games and outwitting the opponent like Boston Legal except not in the court room. I never even bothered with the second season. It was just gore and blow things up all flashy like.

todayilearned,ffg8u2m,t1_ffg5bzn,1579900948.0,"No. That's horses.

A mule and probably a donkey will stop precisely when they mean to. Not before or after."

NewMexico,ff328ev,t1_ff2bntx,1579531763.0,O but you just reminded me. New Mexicans are kinda mad at Colorado recently for the chile thing.
NewMexico,ff1xc56,t1_ff1eoo6,1579488321.0,"Idky you're getting downvoted, I enjoyed your banter. Just don't drive crazy. Living on the east side of the state has it's fair share of crazy Texan drivers.. They pass on the righty side of the road using the shoulder. The shoulder is not a passing zone."
NewMexico,ff1tcg2,t1_ff1etjb,1579485728.0,"It's okay, it's mostly a joke.

I got stuck one time overnight in Dallas in 2012 because other people handled the tickets and that lady at the airport gave me a hotel to sleep in.. And there was a shuttle to Denny's.. And the Denny's people let me take a coffee cup outside to drink while I smoked. Everybody was extremely accommodating and nice to me that night in Texas.

And the second person I ever had sex with was a Texan. He wasn't bad, either."
NewMexico,ff17oij,t3_er3uyt,1579476078.0,I thought we disliked Texas.. As a group..
relationships,ff06sb1,t3_eqw1r9,1579465771.0,"Female gamer here. I've played through Dragon Age 2 a lot. It's always fun to try to get everyone in bed. Especially if you can manage it in one long span of cut scenes. My personal favorite is [Fenris](https://youtu.be/P3GrxycI0AM).

That being said, the game is mostly quests and fighting. The romance bit is incredibly light and mostly in the background dialogue. Also it's a pretty quick game. It's not hundreds of hours on end to complete it.

You're gf is being silly.. Unless you're dreaming of Merrill or drawing erotic pictures or buying Merrill blow up dolls or writing extreme elf erotic fan fic.. Meh. You're fine."

Because Arizona sucks and Texas blows."
