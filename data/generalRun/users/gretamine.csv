mildlyinteresting,ffg4o3k,t1_ffg4hu7,1579898381.0,I have never seen comments say edited x minutes ago. That does not appear on my phone app. But if my memory is correct I recall it just saying saggier and didn't see it saying less
mildlyinteresting,ffg4aaq,t1_ffg4521,1579898147.0,It just said saggier before. They adjusted it. Perhaps it was a typo on their part and they hadn't realized til I commented
mildlyinteresting,ffg20o2,t1_ffg1ofg,1579896745.0,Just because a large amount of people think something doesn't mean they are correct. You have no argument other than you find something arousing and therefore other people can't do it.
mildlyinteresting,ffg1hdv,t1_ffg1abl,1579896410.0,Me not wearing a bra is not pushing anything on anyone. It literally has nothing to do with you and you're making it a you issue. Do you think all women should also wear burkas because Muslim men find hair arousing?

mildlyinteresting,ffg0b5m,t1_fffuaua,1579895694.0,At 35 why do you care if other people think it's cool to go braless tho? Do whatever you want
mildlyinteresting,ffg029b,t1_fffy928,1579895543.0,Bras usually mean saggier boobs actually. If you're constantly wearing them then your chest muscles are doing no work to keep your breasts up because the bra is doing it for you. People who don't wear bras have slightly stronger chest muscles that are used to holding up your breasts
mildlyinteresting,fffzwfw,t1_fffw3ai,1579895443.0,Nipples are considered arousing because society fetishizes them. Some places in Africa don't consider breasts a sexual feature at all. Women don't need to wear bras because you're a perv who can't stop staring at their chest

The answer to that is context and the concept of 'in-jokes.'
