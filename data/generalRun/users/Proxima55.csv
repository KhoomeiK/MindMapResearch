In 2018 and 2017 this number increased by 1.0%, in 2016 by 1.1%. In other words ""record numbers"" have been made for a few years in a row now.

[Edit: as u/cmd_blue pointed out, these numbers are all for the first half of the year. For the entire year the passenger numbers were 139M in 2016 (1.1% increase), 142M in 2017 (1.0% increase), 148M in 2018 (1.0% increase)]

In fact the [total number of kilometres travelled by train](https://www.deutschlandinzahlen.de/tab/deutschland/infrastruktur/verkehr-und-transport/personenkilometer) in Germany have increased every single year (since 1990 at least) by on average 1.9%.

Linking this ""development"" to current affairs, like the Greta effect, seems disingenuous. If anything this effect is minor.

The decrease in domestic air travel is also hugely overstated: the article claims a decrease of 12% compared to November 2018, when in fact [their own source for that](https://www.adv.aero/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/11.2019-ADV-Monatsstatistik.pdf) says the 12% decrease is compared to last **month**, October 2019. Compared to November 2018, the number has only dropped by 1.3%. This is nothing spectacularly new (although slightly more so than for trains) total passenger numbers for 2018 dropped by 0.8%, before that they were growing slightly."

Not really surprising though, because Belin is just by far the most populous. That's why Munich being 3rd here is also to be expected.

To me it's very interesting that considering only employed people seems to make such a large difference. I guess it means Munich has disproportionately many unemployed residents (or maybe just second homes for people working elsewhere?) compared to those other rich cities."

>If a person leaves home at the end of his week's work on the Saturday afternoon to spend the evening of Saturday and the following Sunday with friends at a distance, he is said to be spending his week-end at so-and-so.

So it seems that weekend originates from the ending of the working week, which at the time was Saturday (so nothing to do with modern 5 day weeks). It seems to me to be straightforward, following terminology and practices like the weekend described here, to place Sunday at the end of the week."
