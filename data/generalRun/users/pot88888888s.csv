SonicTheHedgehog,ffncg1a,t3_eu5l9i,1580064233.0,"I think the …excessive shading on his abs distract from the normal form of his body too much. It looks a wee bit more like he's got man tits which isn't a good look in my eyes. They are also so high contrast and detailed, I find my eye is drawn to it first rather than his eyes. :( As a result, I don't really have a positive view on this drawing overall. I have to say as well, I don't really know how I feel about his shoulder puffs. They look just a bit to 'tacked on' like pom poms rather than a natural part of his body. Idk how to fix it, though. 

However! I do like the design of his snout. It's very stylized, in a good way in my eyes. His large ears are also pretty okay and are really expressive. His pose isn't bad either. The shading on his head's pretty good too.

Also if you see anyone taking home a drunk person stranger, it should really be ringing serious alarm bells. Bartenders should really be the ones looking out for fishy situations like this rather than taking part in them. Regardless of their intentions, I really don't want this to be the norm and I definitely don't want to wake up at a bartender's house.

>**do the research on addiction centers for your friend.** Just deciding to seek treatment in the first place can be hard enough for an addict. Help them by finding out whatever you can about treatment centers by visiting, calling, or searching their websites. Find out:  
>  
>Where is the facility located? Is it a convenient or preferable location?  
>  
>What is the center's approach? Is it medical, therapeutic, or some combination? Does it offer any spiritual guidance?  
>  
>Does the center's approach incorporate a 12-step or similar support program?  
>  
>How does the center operate (inpatient or outpatient)?  
>  
>Is its program tailored to each individual?  
>  
>Does the center adapt treatment as the addict's needs change?  
>  
>How long does the program last? There is no single correct answer here, but longer is nearly always better when it comes to addiction treatment programs.  
>  
>What is aftercare like? Try to find a program that offers outpatient care after the person has left.  
>  
>  
>  
>**Stage an intervention only if you are fully prepared.** [Holding an intervention](https://www.wikihow.com/Perform-an-Intervention) is a stereotypical way to help an addict. However, experts now believe that it is much more helpful to offer incentives and focus on well-being than to ""shock"" them into seeking treatment. Some believe that interventions can do more harm than good. If you do want to try an intervention:  
>  
>Consult a professional addiction counselor first.  
>  
>Make sure friends and family are on board with the idea.  
>  
>Wait until the person is not under the influence to hold the intervention.  
>  
>Stay calm and be nonjudgmental.  
>  
>Avoid using the term “addict.”  
>  
>List specific incidents and examples of issues caused by the addiction.  
>  
>Use “I” rather than “you” statements (“I am concerned for your well-being” rather than “You are ruining your life”).  
>  
>Be prepared for the person to push back against your claims.  
>  
>Be ready to suggest concrete means of support, such as treatment centers and counselors.

Since the whole conflict in the game was the result of this entity,  Sonic and Elise never met and the game resets itself to where it started.

SonicTheHedgehog,fdxi1g1,t1_fdx5pa8,1578768862.0,Ditto. Those cutscenes were all beautiful.
SonicTheHedgehog,fdxhe8x,t3_enambv,1578768747.0,Does the intro to Sonic CD count?
SonicTheHedgehog,fdxhbph,t3_enambv,1578768724.0,"In Shadow's story for Sonic 06, I thought a lot of his interactions with Rouge was great. A particular cutscene....I guess when they meet Mephiles.  The intro for his story was fantastic as well. 

I like Shadow and Rouge in Sonic Battle a lot too."

CarletonU,fdpbs2h,t1_fdpa4q5,1578624681.0,Thanks.

CarletonU,fdp10ti,t3_emgcfu,1578617444.0,I'm not sure. You can always download blender onto your own computer.
CarletonU,fdm3ne4,t1_fdm2d1x,1578539024.0,"Hi! Thanks for answering! 

I was wondering if there was a mark for tutorial attendance. Did you find the midterm and final exam hard? Is it just marked on those three things? 

Memorization. So are the tests mostly multiple choice?"
CarletonU,fdm1bty,t1_fdm02o9,1578537459.0,"Yeah, no problem. Send me anything. 

Don't worry at all about the game or web things in your portfolio. Many of my classmates didn't do anything like that for their portfolios (including me). You can get in perfectly fine without it. For some reason I couldn't see your response at all (outside of my inbox on my account). 

Also, does my links work now? I had problem responding, lol I looked at the thread and it says there are 7 comments, but I can only see 4 under the post. This is only showing up for me now, lol. 

Btw, by ""the other two"" in my comment above I meant creativity and ~~breath?~~ range of abilities I didn't want that to be ambiguous, lol."
