It's an unwieldy term though."

There's one thing that may be slightly off. At extreme high wizard levels going yellow with a bit of other color may be better than pure yellow. (True Colors has higher bonuses to dual colors).

I did not test that in game yet, so I may have incorrect info on the bonus damage/special stacking algorithm."

Did you have VSCode in mind in your first sentence?"

ProgrammerHumor,ff8sm58,t1_ff7wizg,1579694505.0,"There are languages, which have much better support, and more free plugins in VSCode.

For C#, C++, F# i would pick VS any time.

For Python, node js or web languages I would usually choose VSCode."

Stern reminders do not really work if they are not followed by a pressure.

If a country wants to pressure only the other country government, the options are limited to spying, defamation, assassination and coups.

The first two hardly ever work, since those people have most of their wealth within the country and have a following and a stranglehold on media.

The second two... well... US has shown us what the results are, and it is not pretty."
nottheonion,ff8n88e,t1_ff67pwr,1579687014.0,"The funniest thing is, the the reverse is unlawful.

Fees and punishments must be strictly defined and not depend on one's income in the US. And god forbid you declare it should be otherwise. You would be drowned in propaganda of how it would break the law and allow for unequal punishments. 

So much for the justice in law in the US."

Creating an environment allowing for starting new, stable business should be a cornerstone of capitalism. While it is being portrayed otherwise."

Nah, I am joking, letting people make their own money is a communist scheme (/s) we need more elaborate and complicated tax system, so only the richest corpos can figure out how to get an infinite tax breaks."

ProgrammerHumor,fe74p5m,t1_fe6svdi,1578909964.0,"It requires time and financial security in case of a failure, or a delay of profits. Not many people can bear that risk.

I could afford to do so, you probably too judging by your response. But it is too easy to forget that other people's situations aren't so good. 

Most of them will end up on the street if they give up their work and focus on a business that fails for half a year or even less.

Of course there is also a way out in wooing the investors. Then one can either create a business with an exit plan in mind, just to secure funds. Or accept the fact that they will eventually be outed from their business by some greedy, rich morons with deep pockets who bought it."

ProgrammerHumor,fdmkijo,t1_fdlm9w7,1578553317.0,If a binary data set is imbalanced you can always 'choose' the majority class and have more than 50% accuracy. Also a random classifier still gives 50% accuracy.

An act of aggression weeks after signing the pact with Nazi Germany about the invasion on Poland is a fact.

Sure Russia and Germany backstabbing one another was inevitable, and so what? 

The one to start the war is the side to start the invasion, which in this case was the Germany, followed by Russia."
worldnews,fcohi07,t1_fco9pgl,1577832348.0,"You could say that about the pact alone, but Russia literally invaded Poland from the other side when they were struggling with Germany after signing it. Good luck justifying that."
