SuicideWatch,ff2dods,t3_er13gq,1579501915.0,I’m not afraid of killing myself. Just afraid of fucking it up and being worse off than before. Also some sense of guilt over emotional pain my family would suffer

SuicideWatch,febupu5,t3_eo0v3v,1578962947.0,That would be fantastic. Just snap my fingers and cease to exist.
