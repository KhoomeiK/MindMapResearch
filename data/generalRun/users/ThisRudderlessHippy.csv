irishtourism,ffacbeh,t1_ffa2w1f,1579732177.0,"Ok. 

I would suggest Dublin for maybe three or four days. Do Jameson, Guinness and the Oscar Wilde Statue. If you're a literary type, I think there's a literature tour you can do but just make sure you see the Longroom in Trinity, Marsh's Library, and the Winding Stair bookshop. Kilmainham Gaol is great but needs to be booked in advance. St Patrick's Cathedral is nice and the National Gallery is worth a look. If you have Irish heritage, you might be interested in the EPIC museum. Take the DART out to Howth to see the market, castle and maybe do the cliff walk. Eat fish and chips. Do another day trip to Glendalough and the Wicklow Mountains. Beautiful spot. 

Then, take the Citylink or GoBus to Galway city. Around â‚¬25 return and they go very regularly. The train is marginally more comfortable but takes the same amount of time and is more expensive and not as frequent. Avoid Bus Eireann at all costs. 

Use Galway city as a base to explore the West. Do day trips to the Cliffs of Moher and the Burren; the Aran Islands; and Connemara and Kylemore Abbey. Regular bus trips to all three leave the city every day. Galway is great for food, nightlife and atmosphere. Walk the prom out to Salthill, try and time it at the weekend and hang around the market, and people watch on Quay Street. There are pub crawls if you're looking to meet other travelers. 

Get the bus back to Dublin to head home. 

Book your accommodation early. It's nice to have freedom but Ireland is *expensive*. Airbnb and hostels are your best bet. B&Bs are favoured by older people and hotels can be insanely expensive, especially in the city centre. In Galway, it's worth actually staying in the centre because the transport isn't as good as Dublin."

A couple of years before me, girls around the whole country staged a walk out so that they would be allowed to wear trousers and were successful. I'm really glad that they did. It's good to have the choice and on cold days it's a lifesaver."
irishtourism,ff4iujm,t3_erhozb,1579564660.0,"You could stop in Athlone on the way back from Galway - Dublin. It's a nice little town with a castle and Europe's oldest pub (Sean's Bar). I always recommend Newgrange too. A bit out of the way but a very impressive sight. 


You could stop in Lahinch near the Cliffs. Some good seafood. Also Dungaire castle is meant to be nice. 

Galway is a great place to spend an evening. Lots if great food and live traditional music and good drink, including a whiskey tour and local craft breweries if you're interested. However, the best part of Galway is out in the country. Head out to Connemara and visit Kylemore Abbey and Killary. That's the best bit. 

Connemara has plenty of cottages and sheep. Not so much rolling gree hills though. Craggy, wild bogs and mountains."

irishtourism,ff1bovl,t3_er3pmc,1579477214.0,"The best thing you can do is not try and blend in too much. We really are sticklers for authenticity. Be forthright and honest: you're American, you're here on your holidays and you're enjoying yourself. Be friendly and polite and people will be the same back to you (and if they're not, they're just dickheads so fuck them). 

Trying to look or act Irish or even just not American can get very cringey very quickly. People will be polite to you regardless, but if you want to ingratiate yourself to average Irish people don't tell everyone your ancestry, we hear it A LOT and, like most Europeans, we're not as interested in genealogy as Americans are. Avoid talking about Irish politics or religion. It gets wearing when people try to ""educate"" you about your own culture. Somewhat unfairly, expect some gentle mocking about Trump, guns, etc. American politics is kind of world politics and seen as fair game. Take any playful mocking (we call it slagging) as a compliment. It's something we do with people who seem fun and like they can handle it. Don't try and use our slang or even speak Irish to us. Like I said, it get's cringey, and it's unnecessary.  We will understand you perfectly, even if you don't understand us (we're all fluent in American). Mind the volume of your voice in quiet pubs and restaurants. Americans naturally speak much louder than us and can really dominate a room. If everyone shuts up in a pub, you shut up. Someone is probably going to sing.  If everyone stands up, you stand up. It's not so common these days but they sometimes still play the national anthem towards the end of the night. You don't have to put your hand on your heart but stand and be respectful. Be very friendly to bar and waitstaff, we're not as hierarchical as other cultures (absolutely no waving money or clicking your fingers). We don't do tabs so expect to pay for each round there and then and always, always get your round in if someone gets you one. 

That's really it. Honestly, even if you didn't do any of those things people would barely give you a second thought because we're so used to tourists anyway. 

Have fun!"

AskReddit,feunfc9,t3_eqies2,1579388228.0,"When I was about 12 and my cousin was 13, we went sitting in the back of the car while my mother was driving us somewhere, and my cousin started telling me about this very vivid nightmare she had where she was shot and woke up clutching her stomach. Before she could finish the story, I told her the ending and said ""you told me about this dream before, with our other two cousins in Aunt Marie's house"". 

She seemed confused. She said she had told the other cousins this dream but she didn't remember me being there. It went back and forth for a while with me describing the scene perfectly, where my other two cousins were (one on a top bunk with the storyteller, one on bottom bunk sulking). Storyteller confirmed that yes, that is what happened, but I definitely wasn't there. I was getting irate and insistent when my mother interrupted and said I couldn't have been there. 

See, the Storyteller cousin  had only recently moved to our country from abroad.  I had not yet been in Aunt Marie's house at the same time as her. As soon as my mother said that, I realised that my memory of the event was strange. The vantage point didn't make sense, I would have been hovering in mid air to see it the way I did with both bunks at once. I couldn't remember anything else of the visit. I just had this strange, vivid recollection of the event alone, and could tell my cousin specific details of the dream she had and how she told the story when I couldn't possibly have been there. 

I'm sure there's an explanation but I've never found one."

It's extremely patronising and dehumanizing to take the position of ""I'm going to help you but only if it's only what I think is best for you"". If you're giving someone a chance to actually get on their feet and transform their lives, then absolutely set parameters.  If you're giving them a few euro, just allow them the dignity or spending it how they want. Not trusting poor people and policing how they should live their lives is a major problem in society.

Bits of it were hard, he'd have occasional screaming fits, had to be watched like a hawk because he was learning to walk and seemed like he was trying his best to fatally injure himself. 

I would definitely say it's hard but it was the tedium, loneliness and worry of it that was hard for me, not the difficulty of feeding, clothing, bathing, entertaining him, etc. That bit was easy."
AskWomen,fcyvk5r,t3_ejftg3,1578088015.0,"Just got engaged to partner of 15 years (we started going out at 15). 

I experienced a little of what you're talking about in college, mainly due to pressure from others. We took a couple of breaks but always got back together within days and still acted like a couple the whole time. Ultimately we realised that we're just not happy apart.

 I happened to find my life partner really early. A lot of people spend their whole lives looking for what I have. We've had so much time together, so many adventures and so much more to look forward to. I'm so, so glad now that I didn't throw that away for nothing. 

However, I'm also glad that I didn't over commit too young. At no point did we feel trapped. We were both free to leave whenever we wanted. We didn't even live together until 6 years in because I wanted a normal college experience and to live with friends. I didn't let being in a relationship stop me from travelling alone, travelling with friends, having hobbies and interests separate from my partner. Yes, it can work out when people marry early (my parents for example) but my advice to people in young relationships is to keep things as low pressure as possible for as long as possible. There's no rush and I know a lot of genuine loving relationships have been tarnished or destroyed by feeling suffocated and trapped too young."
irishtourism,fcw3ozn,t3_ej306q,1578016425.0,I would go with the Wickow Mountains and Glendalough.

irishtourism,fct6nsa,t3_eirx7x,1577934268.0,"Example itinerary: 

Day 1: presumably flying into Dublin? Get settled and recover from jet lag (if you're coming from far away). Go out for a meal and to hear some traditional music in a pub. A Dub will have to advise you on where is best to go for that. 

Day 2 - 3: Dublin sightseeing. I always like to do walking tours in new cities because it helps to get a feel for the place. The Book of Kells at TCD might be interesting for your wife as an artistic piece and the long room is worth a visit. The National Gallery is nearby and has some lovely peices. If the weather is nice, have a walk in St Stephen's Green. I'd really recommend visiting Kilmainham Gaol and St Patrick's Cathedral.  Tourists usually enjoy the Guiness Storehouse and/of the Jameson Brewery.  The EPIC museum might be of interest if you have Irish heritage.  

Day 4: Pick up rental car. Start driving to Donegal. Stop in Newgrange, Co. Meath on the way. Arrive in Donegal. I'd recommend staying in Ardara. Lovely town. The food in Nancy's is great. 

Day 5: spend the day exploring Donegal. Lot's of lovely drives. Check out Sliabh League. 

Day 6: take the scenic route to Galway. Stop off in Sligo or Westport along the way. Stay in Connemara that night (maybe around Killary harbour). Lots of lovely pubs, scenery, etc. 

Day 7: explore Connemara. The famine walk around the harbour is beautiful,  the Killary Adventure Centre is fun, as is the Sheepdog Farm (plus they have puppies!). Don't miss Kylemore Abbey. Drive to Galway that night and go out on the town if you can. Lots of great restaurants and arguably the best nightlife in the country. Check out The Crane and Tigh CoilÃ­ for brilliant live music and the Roisin Dubh. 

Day 8 explore Galway city a bit. Maybe take a day trip out to one of the islands. Very foodie city. If you can time this at the weekend, there's a great Saturday market. 

Day 9:  drive south. Stop off at Dungaire Castle, Doolin, and the Cliffs of Moher. If you can make it to Kerry that night, great, but if not stay maybe in or around Limerick for the night.  

Day 10 - 12: the ring of Kerry. 

Day 13: Drive back to Dublin, stopping off at the Rock of Cashel and Kilkenny along the way. 

Day 14  fly out.


If you want to take a more leisurely pace, remove Donegal or Kerry and just add the extra days elsewhere. Kerry is arguably ""prettier"" but it's also much more touristy. I kind of prefer the more rugged, secluded nature of Donegal.  You could lose the day in Galway city but it might be very rushed and a lot of driving without it. 

Any other questions, let me know. Thanks!"

TooAfraidToAsk,fcmp9t6,t3_ehrok6,1577785462.0,"I like being around my nieces and nephew most of the time. I've watched them grow and develop little personalities. I see them when they're being a pain in the arse  but also when they're being incredibly sweet or funny. They love people so much and so openly, it's honestly the best thing ever. I much prefer being around them when they're a little older (age 5 plus). 

But I don't like being around other kids that much or being stuck beside ones in public that are misbehaving. I don't think anyone does. What you are experiencing is normal, especially at your age where you're questioning the traditional route life offers. You may have a change of heart or you may not. I'd encourage you to keep an open mind. People who make hating children part of their personality can be a bit tedious.  It's not acceptable to say you hate any other group of humans universally so I'm not sure why people think it's ok to hate children."

irishtourism,fclj0n4,t1_fckzhwp,1577748922.0,I would do a stop over at the Rock of Cashel and/or Kilkenny instead. It's much more direct and a nice way to break up a long drive.
irishtourism,fcixmxl,t1_fci1qp9,1577672270.0,"That's too much. 

You would need a full day for driving to Donegal with a stopover at Newgrange. Plus at least a full day to actually see Donegal. Then another long drive to Galway with a stopover in Westport/Sligo, then at least an evening in Galway with the tour to the Cliffs the following day and then back to Dublin that evening or the following morning. 


Would you consider just picking Galway or Donegal. In Galway, for example, you have a city with great culture, food and nightlife that can be used as a bass for day trips to the Cliffs, the Burren, Connemara, Killary Fjord, the Aran Islands, Kylemore Abbey, Dungaire Castle. Lots of beautiful scenery right on your doorstep and you would be saving a lot of time otherwise spent driving."
