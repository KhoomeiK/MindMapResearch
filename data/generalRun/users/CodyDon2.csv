gaming,ffghic1,t3_etgn4g,1579906354.0,I hate feeling like I'm dragging my squad down. It's why I wont play Apex or Squads on Fortnite. But it also blows my mind how fucking shitty some people can be that you aren't as good as them at a game or they don't help guide you to make you better.
Fantasy_Football,ffggmqk,t1_ffggc1m,1579905790.0,I was going to say something about that but felt it would come off bad and didnt wanna seem like a dick. But congrats on the win and the book. Hope life is better.

MLBTheShow,fe964qh,t1_fe6nay8,1578934689.0,You can still be late and square a ball up. I wanna say hitting it on the back foot is considered late but a ball away is meant to be hit on back foot to push it the opposite field. But I assume you mean more of late and weak hits.

MLBTheShow,fdpt7sj,t3_emn88c,1578639540.0,"People will tell you where to start your pci, what settings to use blah blah. But you just gotta practice and find what works for you. It takes time. But you eventually get the hang of it. But I would do the weekly challenge to start off with. It helps you get the flow of using PCI more. Then I'd say try out Battle Royale cause you'll end up facing a lot of lower overall pitchers which helps get a feel for online pitching.  But just practice practice practice."
MLBTheShow,fdpt0b4,t1_fdpsuj6,1578639312.0,"I honestly think switching to an xbox control will help with this tremendously.  The location of the left joystick being higher will allow pulling (or rather pushing) up to be much easier and allowing us to sit in low pitches, so less likely to pull down. If that makes sense at all.


Btw,  I dont mean you can use an xbox controller.  It's just something I was thinking of since they announced they are going to multi platforms."

MLBTheShow,fdprwib,t1_fdntmlg,1578638131.0,Play Battle Royale if you have the funds to. It's on All Star and you'll face a lot of lower level pitchers at times which helps get a feel for it. It's how I learned to get a true feel for playing online. I still struggle with Hall of Fame pitch speeds though cause they are pretty drastic compared to All Star.
