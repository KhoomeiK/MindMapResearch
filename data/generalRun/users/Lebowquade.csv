However, did it occur to you this person may:

a) be young enough not to have encountered this statistical description yet

b) be old enough not to remember this specific detail from high school

c) have been recently taught this standard explanation, but did not understand it and wanted to know more

All of these scenarios are perfectly reasonable. And frankly, even if you look it up, the concept that ""atomic particles do not physically exist excepting as a probability cloud"" is really fucking confusing-- especially if you try to reason out what is actually happening in a physical sense. 

In a lot of ways, the electron cloud model is not terribly informative, especially when it comes to trying to figure out which conclusions about the actual behavior of electrons are valid or not. As demonstrated by this very thread, a lot of people misunderstand precisely what QM or SM implies about the nature of subatomic particles.

In general though, calling someone out for wanting to learn something is a shitty thing to do."
explainlikeimfive,ff6nyuz,t1_ff6g0zc,1579631247.0,"You're joking, right?

The question hes asking is about quantum mechanics, and it does not have a simple answer. The actual behavior of electrons at an atomic scale is complicated, extremely confusing, counterintuitive, and nuanced. 

Whatever you thought you learned about electrons in grade school is probably mostly incorrect.

In some cases I agree with you-- sometimes questions in this sub have a straightforward Google-able answer. But... in this case I think you're vastly underestimating the complexity of the topic. You can easily google pictures of electron orbital shapes (which I assume is what you're thinking of), but those really do not paint a good picture of what's really ""happening.""

Also: shunning someone for asking a question that you yourself know the answer to is, in general, a dick move. Sometimes people dont know things, and sometimes people may want to see an actual discussion from people who do know what they're talking about."
explainlikeimfive,ff6mvuq,t1_ff6c6np,1579630592.0,"It may also help to remember that the electron does not have a well defined physical size.

When you imagine an electron zipping around somewhere, that notion is already incorrect because it does not take up physical space the same way that, say, a beach ball does. 

Even using words like ""location"" or ""speed"" or ""movement"" are misleading because (confusingly) it just doesnt really have any of those things."

The length of the pulse is not the issue. The actual response time for the gain medium will be on the scale of picoseconds. The chip would heat up and burn itself out within a few nanoseconds trying to push out that much power in that short of time.

""2 or 3 joules total per burst"" doesnt sound like much, but when you're trying to push it through a 10 square micron area in a tenth of a microsecond, the energy density required to be moving through that area is impossible."

For comparison, industrial CO2 cutting lasers used to cut and machine solid materials (including some aluminum alloys) are in the 500W to 5000W range. Most are pulsed, very few are CW.

mealtimevideos,fekw8c0,t1_fefsmsu,1579208887.0,"I'm a physicist. I build lasers.

Even for a ~100 nanosecond long pulse (which is typical for pulsed lasers) it's not a feasible amount of power.

""2 or 3 joules total"" doesnt sound like much, but when you're trying to push it through a 10 square micron area in a tenth of a microsecond, the energy density required to be moving through that area is impossible.

I never said it wasnt a crazy powerful laser, because it clearly is.

But it is not a million watts.

Additionally: the source of my confusion about the wall power was that he is quoting 1000000W of PEAK power per pulse, and not 1000000W of AVERAGE output.

Laser power is basically only ever listed as the 2nd one, even for pulsed lasers. I see now he clearly means the first one. That makes sourcing from the wall plausible, but I stand by my assertion that a million watts of peak power is not gonna happen.

And, even if it did have a million watt peak output, it would still be frankly disingenuous to call it a 1000000W laser if the average power output is only 10 or 50 watts."

If its pulsed, then the pulse rate has got to be like.... 0.001%.

Maybe 100W I could buy. Even 1000W.
But 1000000 is straight up fantasy considering hes using wall power, and especially the type of laser hes dealing with (i.e. a diode, and not a gas laser).
