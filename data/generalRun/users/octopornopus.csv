Got it to a parking lot. Swapped the battery, ignition coil, and a few other parts, then gave up for the night and went to get dinner. Went back to grab some things, and just for giggles tried to start it, and fired right up. Got it home and did some research.

Turns out, they placed the module in the worst possible place, except directly on the exhaust manifold. They didn't use enough thermal paste at the factory, and the module had no airflow. You can grab one off an Aerostar van, where they're remote mounted on a heatsink plate, and mount it on the inner fender. I couldn't find a donor, so I just grabbed one off a truck."

keto,fe8uilc,t1_fe66d5z,1578931094.0,"Similar situation for me:

Played football, lifted weights in high school, worked in construction and warehouses, could eat anything and not worry about it.

Started working inside retail, didn't change my eating habits like I should, and packed on the weight, fast.

I used keto and c25k to drop 100lbs, and felt great, but a couple injuries, a couple slip ups with fast food, eventually led me back to old habits. 

The hardest part with keto is recognizing that it's not a ""diet"", it's a dietary shift in your eating habits. I see too many people jump on it like they did with one month juicing, or other trend diets, and as soon as the allotted diet period is over, they go right back to their old diet and gain it all back. Most of keto is going to be mental, cutting out cravings for things like sweets, breads, starches, it's hard, and it takes time. Having dinner with family or friends, smelling pizza, or seeing cake, it can suck. You just have to be mentally tough enough to power through.

You'll also start to get a lot of attention from those around you, whether you want it or not, and it won't always be positive. You'll see a lot of people on hear venting about their family or coworkers making snide remarks, usually because the OP is making changes in their life that other people can't or won't make for themselves. Don't let them get you down, just focus on your goal and live your life.

Don't feel the need to explain yourself to everyone, it can lead to a lot of problems. There are way too many misconceptions about keto, like ""you can eat a pound of bacon and a dozen eggs everyday and lose weight!"" I had it this weekend with my uncle when we went out to eat for his birthday. We were at a steakhouse, everyone was eating the free bread, the deep fried appetizers, and chips. I had a ceaser salad, no croutons, and grilled chicken Laredo (covered in cheese, avacado, grilled onions), and steamed broccoli. Everyone had to make a comment, trying to get me have a beer, to take a bite of their fried foods, and then a slice of ice cream cake.

You gotta power through, and after a while you'll hit a groove, but until then its tough. Stay strong."
