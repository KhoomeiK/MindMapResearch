There are multiple methods. Best way for me  is distillation.

I put cold water from the faucet through a filter that filters plastics and other items into the distiller,then distill.

That also has  a carbon filter,and then when done,I put about a teaspoon of baking soda to balance PH.

Reason why to run the water first through carbon filters is because distillation does not remove plastics and sometimes other material.

You can also get a reverse osmosis,but thats usually more expensive.
