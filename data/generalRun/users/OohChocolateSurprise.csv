OldSchoolCool,ff8x5av,t1_ff8wnkl,1579698972.0,"I mean, it's Taming of the Shrew, so it was always meant to be the story of two garbage, abusive people who deserve each other. Hollywood, of course, either missed that part or figured dumb teenagers wouldn't catch on an find the whole thing romantic and aspirational."
HannibalTV,ff8vphh,t1_ff8oz5x,1579697682.0,"According to the internet, Hugh is 5'11 and Mads is 6'0 (180 cm to 183 cm,) so they're basically of a height. Hugh is even fairly sturdily-build, if not particularly beefy, but I think Mads might be broader through the chest and shoulders. I have noticed, and in this picture it's particularly obvious, that Mads also has a very physical presence about him, where he seems to sort of command space even when he's just lounging about or standing still. It makes him seem bigger than Hugh, even though he's not, really."

BeautyGuruChatter,femfb5c,t1_felmguk,1579252505.0,"Wtf are you talking about? What exactly do you think I'm proposing? She's not entitled to receive PR, no one owes it to her, and if this is what she does with it, it's not ""out of line"" to anticipate that she would be removed from a company's PR list. She already has been, by several other companies, for her dishonesty and for her repeated displays of bigotry/insensitivity."
BeautyGuruChatter,felckpy,t3_epodpq,1579219002.0,"Lillee Jean lies. Like, that is her running on factory settings. At the very beginning of the video, before she's swatched anything yet, you can see that all of her fingers look slightly damp/shiny/oily. Subsequent close-ups of her fingers look even *more* wet. Even if one were to believe her later edit in the description box that she was using some kind of coconut oil makeup wipe to clean off her finger between swatches, why would she not dry off all the goop left on her finger before putting it into the next shadow? Starting 1:42 seconds, you can see that there is so much of the goop on her finger that it has mixed with echo, chill thrill, into the blue, and dreamer to make a wet paste.

Not only is this going to obviously give you an inaccurate impression of the formula and how the product performs on its own, but smearing all that coconut oil into the pans is going to permanently fuck up the entire palette. This is disrespectful to her viewers *and* careless handling of product sent to her for free. I hope someone at morphe sees how she's trashed their PR and takes note."
