You did a smart thing by removing yourself from a potentially dangerous situation, we can’t predict how we will act when something like this occurs and I hope you don’t beat yourself up with “I should have done...” scenarios!"

I’ve got the response written for if he does reach out but I don’t want to send it because I don’t really want him to know he hurt me when he doesn’t seem to care at all"
depression,fcojk3c,t1_fcoah8b,1577833826.0,"Honestly there’s a big snowstorm right now otherwise I just might, but my hitching everything to this dude who was waving red flags at me the whole time is not worth her getting on the roads right now... I made this bed so I’m gonna eat everything and lie in it"
depression,fco2et2,t3_ei19sk,1577822812.0,"I feel for you. It’s so hard to live with this crushing sadness and loneliness on a normal day, let alone a day when everyone else seems to be celebrating and socializing. 

I thought I’d found a kindred spirit the past few months. He asked me on the weekend if I wanted to spend NYE with him. I cancelled my one friend coming from another city for it. Now he’s ghosted me for the past two days and I’m gutted. And too embarrassed to tell her that he ditched me. I don’t know many people in the city I’m in so I too will be alone to start the next decade."
