todayilearned,fficjg3,t1_ffib2iw,1579970625.0,"> the project would use solar energy to pump water up

My very first comment talked about solar energy.  So what do you mean whats my point in the discussion of solar????  Using solar for this type of project IS IN EARLY DEVELOPEMENT.  Using solar here IS NOT MATURE.  The system might not care where they pull energy from but my very first comment talked about a solution to storing SOLAR ENERGY.  Go reread the context and my first comments."
todayilearned,ffi9hc6,t1_ffhsvu4,1579968515.0,"""Because these plants require energy to pump water uphill, pumped storage hydro plants have net negative electricity generation balances, meaning that they consume more energy than they store. Most pumped storage systems require 15% to 30% more electricity to pump water uphill than what the water generates when it flows back downhill.""
You need even more solar area than normal to meet a demand.  Which you or somebody else already mentioned land use is a challenge for something this big. 

None of these use solar energy to power the pumps.  When solar energy which needs light levels that can be bad based on weather it makes the system unreliable.  The efficiency levels of solar cells on top of the energy lost during the pump phase means you are getting virtually nothing back some days.  So its not a viable solution.  Im not trying to say its a terrible idea, im saying if it didnt come with a host of problems they would be used far more frequently everywhere around the world."
todayilearned,ffh5n52,t1_ffgx0ff,1579923778.0,"I think proven is a stretch.  Im no expert but this guy was and he was pretty open about the design challenges and problems that come with this kind of solution. I cant remember all the things he said since i spoke with him over 2 years ago. Maybe things are different now, who knows."
AbsoluteUnits,ffgvobi,t1_ffgvaov,1579916238.0,Probably because he messed up the spelling.
todayilearned,ffgtaup,t1_ffge22f,1579914512.0,"I spoke with an engineer working on a project that was basically a natural battery to store massive quantities of solar energy.  Problem with solar power is that energy demand in during the night when everyone turns on lights and sits down to watch tv/game/wind down.  So the project would use solar energy to pump water up to a resevoir at a higher elevation.  Then at night release the water past a hydro turbine and capture the stored solar energy in the form of water running down hill.  


NOW OBVIOUSLY its not perfect. Lots of energy loss due to friction. LOTS of maintenance cost.   But its a neat idea to a problem nobody has an answer to which is storing solar energy."
