keto,fgkdrat,t1_fgja64u,1580863199.0,"So, I've been on and off keto.  I generally am happier on keto bc I have more energy and typically eat a lot more vegetables and non processed foods.  Just plain healthier. My family totally supports that and my brothers, mother, cousins, aunts and uncles all have accommodated me.  My Italian aunt has made meals for everyone and there was no pasta or bread.  

I go off it for periods to keep me sane, and bc there are too many foods I love that aren't keto. And for this next reason.

My dad always liked to cook and gather people around.  Family and friends, and spending quality time with them was very important to him.  One way he could do that was cooking big meals with good food.  Often nostalgic food, family recipes, other comfort food, etc.  When he died, I've tried to emulate that.  Cooking has become a big thing for me.  When I go back home, I'll plan to cook something special to make sure everyone gets together. 

But, I'm also very accommodating with allergy or religious restrictions....multiple people in my fam with celiac disease...one who has strong aversions to some textures.  Part of it is getting together with them, but I do want to enjoy the food with them.

I don't think you need to change your diet, but do try to understand her point of view.  I might understand hers, but see if there's a way you can accommodate each other and both get what you want."

Still gives me chills.  I love it bc I didn't necessarily expect it even if I should have.  Bc of the double meaning.  Bc the light eyes did nothing, bit Kal flipped over on to the sand bc he protects."

Stormlight_Archive,fg1m1u2,t3_eweo4b,1580429533.0,"Yeah man, I cried.  I was so happy and excited and the next instant I was devastated.  His change from spoiled and selfish to him understanding his shortcomings and working to better himself made my feelings on him skyrocket."

Stormlight_Archive,fe0epa2,t1_fe0dsq5,1578812046.0,"I have a friend and a co-worker that both disliked Lift enough that they didn't finish Edgedancer.  I don't dislike her but find her at times a bit awkward and out of place.  Even if she's meant to be, I don't find those scenes enjoyable."
gaming,fdzckht,t1_fdz86qh,1578788935.0,Just means a big game developed by one of the big devs.  The stuff you see commercials for on TV.
