1. Worse case: I have a panic attack. I would remove myself from the situation and do some grounding exercises.

2. I say or do something embarrassing. The other people think I'm an idiot. Experience has shown me that I can live with this, even if feels awful at that moment.

3. Best outcome, and most likely, nothing bad happens. Social interaction successful. Mission accomplished."

From my own experience I have found that while I find it helpful to talk about what happened and how I feel other people find things like talking about them and visiting the grave to be just too painful.

My own suggestion would be to go along with your friend and read your letter. Spend a little time telling your sister how you feel. If it helps you then you can always share with your family what you did and how it made you feel and maybe they will be more willing to come along next time.

I wish you the very best in whatever decision you make here, there are no right or wrong answers as we all grieve on different ways. Sending hugs."
