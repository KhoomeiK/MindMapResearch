I had a problem with this for YEARS. One thing that has helped me is opening up to them anyway, telling them that I feel like maybe I’m over-reacting and that it makes it hard to share sometimes. Then I know I can ask them if I’m blowing things out of proportion or talk to them about anything and they have that context. I know it’s hard, but I have never had someone respond negatively to this. They are usually very supportive. 

I still have issues with it sometimes, but it makes it easier and sometimes, you just have to say fuck it and hit send and value your mental well-being over the effect sharing might have. I hope this helps."

dating_advice,fdnph8l,t1_fdnmeh0,1578590427.0,"I get that, but I think most people here are probably not going to assume you mean someone underage. If it helps, you could always try saying something that indicates age like “girl (early twenties)” or “woman (early twenties)”. I think that’s encouraged in this sub as well.

Anyway, good for you for taking a chance!"

We’ve talked about it and I can tell he’s trying so I feel like even though there are things happening that still upset me, I can’t really complain or bring them up and I should just be happy that he’s trying."

hingeapp,fcyedr7,t1_fcycsgu,1578078879.0,"I’ve (25F) wondered this before too and I wouldn’t think so. (Someone correct me if I’m wrong) I feel like it’s fine because people understand that their like can get buried and also tbh, I don’t send many likes and I still don’t remember the guys I sent them to. I think guys send more likes than women so I doubt they’d be bothered by it either? People also get busy and don’t look at hinge for long periods of time so I think it’s nothing to worry about."

I’ll also add that I prefer first dates to be on weeknights. I really value my weekends and usually already have plans with friends. Maybe morning or midday on a weekend, but that’s pretty hit or miss. 

Plus, with weeknights, if it’s not going well, there’s an easy out of “well I need to go, I have work tomorrow” or if it is going well, you can stay as long as you want."
