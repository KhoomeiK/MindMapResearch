But OP still doesn't get it, because she says: Moral of the story, *Don't Sleep With Your Ex!*  (I have known people to sleep with their ex and it worked out fine, they get back together, etc. It's generally not a good idea, but it all depends on a lot of factors.)

The actual moral of the story is: *If you want a faithful, committed relationship, ask for it in a timely fashion (even a year is waay too long), and expect him to act like it, ie, have a normal relationship where you meet his family, co-workers and friends, look at and be included in his social media, etc, or don't be surprised if you get played! Talk about shared values and goals, do normal couple things. Players are always looking for suckers and saps, don't be one.*

OP, you weren't in love with who he was, you were in love with the fantasy he created for you. Apparently, he wants a much younger woman that he can easily manipulate, or else she is willing to share him as long as she is the wife, (so maybe they have a clearer understanding? If she marries him even if you tell her, that is the case),  that's not you, apparently you're not willing to share him. Or, maybe she is playing him in return. He has income producing property, she might be looking for an older man with deep pockets to fund her lifestyle or career goals and is just telling him what he wants to hear.  My long life experience has showed me, that when players find someone that they are compatible with, it's usually another player, even if it's not obvious from the outside. That's karma.

You are in a better place. Now you are grown up, you're in a much better place to find what you are really looking for. 

Tell her or don't tell her. Shake it off. Wash that man right out of your hair, and don't look back. Living well is the best revenge. But the choices you make from now on, are not about them, it's about you. Hopefully you believe that you deserve better. If not, become a person who deserves true love and good treatment. And start acting like it. Don't leave yourself wide open to be fooled and taken advantage of."

AmItheAsshole,feylbf1,t1_fexq4lj,1579447116.0,"OP won't forgive his sister for doing what her parents required her to do. OP could have done what he knew his parents wanted him to do, then he would still have been in their good graces. He could have waited until he was at least 18 and out of the house, to explore his sexuality, it wouldn't kill him. Little sisters tend to have prohibitions on their sexuality too, in a religious family home. 

The thing is, it sounds like he would choose to be in the bosom of the family given the opportunity, because they ""kicked him out of the house,"" he didn't just leave. He wants his sister 3 years younger to defy their parents and face the consequences, but it sounds like he does not want to face the consequences that he played a much larger part in creating for himself. He was the one who got a boyfriend, he knew how his family would react.

And it sounds like he is the one, 3 years later, who has not made efforts to repair the relationship with his parents. He says: *We have not spoken since.*  No one can stop him from speaking to his parents, call them up.  It sounds like he is jealous of his sister for having his parents financial support after age 18, but it was his choice to disobey them while living under their roof.  

>*Plus, I just can't reconcile the fact that she's still close with our parents, who are sending her to a great school and giving her such a wonderful life. It's just not fair.*

See, jealous. He would accept his parents support, even after being treated harshly, but he doesn't think she should be supported.  It seems to me if he loved his sister and wanted what was best for her, he would say: *Don't make the mistake I made. Wait until you are self-supporting to make independent choices. I'm glad it's working out for you. I'm proud of you. And thank-you for understanding what I'm going through, and apologizing.*  But that would require a more emotionally mature person.

He said that he absolutely knew that everyone in his life of any importance, would absolutely hate him, if they knew what he was doing, but he did it anyway. So he knew the consequences. Well, apparently his sister isn't of any importance because she doesn't hate him, but that's not enough. He wants his sister to suffer and be without parental affection and support as a result of his choices. 

Whether his parents were right or wrong, he knew what he was doing and he knew the consequences. Religious parents feel like it is their duty to train their children in a certain way and to demand obedience.  Once the child is out of their home and doesn't require their support, they are more accepting of their child's freedom of choice. Parents then feel like they did what was required of them, and aren't as likely to take it personally."

There's a Hot Dog ($5) and a (Fakin') Bacon, Lettuce and Tomato Sandwich with Chips ($8). (It's worth noting that these last 2 don't include the usual class 1 carcinogens).  It's cafeteria style instead of sit-down service, so a large tip isn't required.

You can always get a taste of the soups first to help you decide. I really like their chili and corn bread. Mashed potatoes and gravy! If it's hot out i have been known to succumb to a vegan milkshake, the best flavor? Jah Mocha! Indian Curry Plate with rice and veggies and tofu, a delicious sauce, gererous spring rolls with a sweet peanut dipping sauce. Mediterranean Pasta with olives and sun-dried tomatoes.

Meditation,feg1v47,t3_eo0k5t,1579073310.0,"I think what you experienced is called samahdi. 

In my mid 20s, I used to take a yoga class that included meditation, and I would slip into this blissful state. When the class was over and I stood up and said goodbye to the teacher and students, I would come out of it, and go back to normal. Then, one night, the class ended and i said goodbye to teacher and students and drove home 40 miles, to a tiny town where i lived, i didn't come out of the blissful state the whole drive. I felt like i was in wordless communication with God. I felt no ego,  regret or concern for the self. I felt like I was in such bliss to be linked with God, that it didn't matter what God asked of me, I would do it. I wasn't at all self-destructive, but i would have given up my life in a second,  and thought nothing of it, to follow the will of God for me, which i could sense, and i trusted completely. I felt like I was one with the universe, but it was so much more than these words can impart. I was so much more than this body i inhabit, so much more than  my place in space and time, or my experiences, those things didn't concern me anymore, and it was so freeing, you can't imagine the pleasure. I think I was bigger than life, I was Spirit, with a capital S, not just my spirit, but Great Spirit. But it wasn't an ego trip, i was full of love and compassion for everyone and everything. But a different kind of love, so it's chill. It's like we are all in this together, a shared experience. So no worries, nothing necessary to accomplish, everything is cool or somehow understandable and acceptable. In the Spirit, you don't worry about insignificant matters of mortals?

When i got home, to the house I shared with my boyfriend, I was aware of my spirit, and it didn't want me to go in there, and sleep with my boyfriend, when previously i would have been happy to be there. When I was in samadhi, my spirit knew more than I knew consciously. It wasn't a psychic thing, but a crystal clarity of mind. I was not in denial of anything, i was not repressing anything, i was not in reaction to anything, i was so much more aware. When i am in my normal state there is an insecurity (or some combination of neurosis?)  fogging up my thinking. (Maybe it could have been psychic, if i wanted to be for some reason, but i was completely fulfilled with simply being).

Now when you live in a sparsely populated part of the desert, and you're driving around in the middle of nowhere, you carry a blanket in your car, because of extreme temperature changes, it goes from hot in the day to really cold at night, and you could get hypothermia if your car broke down in the desert somewhere, (this was before cell phones), and if you couldn't stay warm. So I did what my spirit told me to do, something I would never do in my ""right mind"". I could have slept in my car, but I got my blanket and walked out into the desert and laid down in the territory of rattlesnakes and scorpions and fell asleep, looking at the stars in total bliss and happiness unlike anything I have ever known. I knew full well that there were lots of  rattlesnakes and scorpions around there, and they would be attracted to my body heat, but I felt that it was something that God was communicating with me to do, I felt like that was what I should do. And i did feel like i would be okay, but if i wasn't, i was okay with that, too; it's hard to explain, but i was just so intuitively sure of my path in the moment as a result of my connection with divine guidance.

 In the morning, I woke up, and I was normal again with ego and anxiety and all the human condition, and I wept the bitterest tears, I cried like a baby for what I suddenly realized I was missing. 

Edit: It's worth noting that i was not doing any drugs at all, even alcohol or caffeine, although i had done some in previous years. I was on a clean diet which managed my allergies, and very busy working and raising my boyfriend's child. Unfortunately, there was not necessarily a great change in consciousness after my samadhi experiences, although i did have some profound cosmic events.  Looking back on it, I did not, afterwards, suddenly have wisdom beyond my years.  Although it is hard to say how clueless i might have been without experiencing samadhi."

Meditation,fe37bns,t1_fe0wscq,1578846618.0,"A very popular system that includes meditation is the Wim Hof Method. It has been studied extensively and continues to be studied. The founder, Wim Hof says that it helps people overcome psychological trauma and depression and anxiety. It includes cold showers and I know that helps because I used to get suicidally depressed then would swim in the ocean, and feel fine. I never realized why the pool didn't provide the same benefit until I read about the Wim Hof Method. It also includes pranayama to prepare for meditation. If you can't get into the cold showers, especially in the winter, at least try the pranayama and meditation. WHM is based on Tibetan Buddhist techniques, without the religious aspects. Art of Living also teaches a meditation technique that includes pranayama. It is offered as part of a Hindi yogi's philosophy, and tries to be secular, but some yogi worship can sneak in, depending on the leader. Some teachers are much better than others. Anyway, we took the 5 day course and found it really useful, as it set us on a solid program of daily pranayama and meditation. Although any meditation is better than none, a 20 or better yet 40 minutes a day done regularly will usually bring better results in your mental state. There are also many places that offer free introductory Buddhist meditations for beginners. But they don't include the pranayama, in my experience, a definite plus for deep meditation. If you want an easy immediate substitute you might try 30 minutes of vigorous aerobic exercise, breathing deeply, before meditation.

And so she married one of the most famous people in the world, a  British prince, who is constantly under observation. I'm not buying it. And Prince Harry hates the paparazzi and the press, too, and apparently the royal family, his own family, who has given him the best of everything, so he married a drama queen American actress, who is constantly demanding better accommodations and better treatment. She is an actress, in her professional life constantly in front of cameras, but she can't handle it. And she doesn't want her newborn to have his picture taken at all when he was born, is always saying the details of his life are private, including details of his birth and christening, and who his godparents are. She is just a simple girl, a private citizen who had her baby shower in a hotel 
 suite that costs $75,000.00 a day. And takes private jet planes trips that cost half a million each.

I don't think she loves Harry at all, I think she loves money and fame. And I think she wants to be in California where she will get custody, but first she has to alienate Harry from his family. I think she's beautiful and driven and ambitious, those things are okay. 

And I hope I'm wrong here, but I think she's a man eater, and I think she will chew him up and spit him out. I think she is using him and people don't respect the people they use.

That is not necessarily a step mother, because that is usually someone a man chooses for himself. But if you had a wife who was the boy's mother, a good guy would provide a lot for her, do things for her, etc.

So I suggest that you look for a nanny to hire, someone to take him places teach him things, and do some of the motherly tasks. But not just a housekeeper, cook.   You might have to pay a little more than rock bottom and be extra respectful and considerate to her, you are looking for someone who is more family than employee. But remember, this is about your son, not you. You are to serve the relationship not benefit from it. You may ultimately benefit from it, in time, but if you start making this about you, it won't work.

Giving your description of hooking up, with your child's mother, I doubt you have a selection of quality women to choose from for a mother substitute for him. You might consider some personal reassessments to make your home and family a comfortable and welcoming, safe place for wise and kind motherly women of good character and self-respect. Just a guess.

You have the inkblot-shaped coffee table, that casts an inkblot-shaped shadow, but then it falls on top of an irregular-shaped, patterned cowhide, on top of a herringbone patterned rug, it is all too busy. It's very eye-catching but it doesn't work. To be fair, something like that is hard to pull off. Any area that busy needs to be carefully considered, and elements expertly combined. So turn that cowhide into some sandals and a handbag, or put it in an entranceway, or somewhere there is a less busy layout. And start with a simpler rug, maybe something solid, with a simple  border, get just the right size.

After you pick out the better carpet, it's time to get a larger piece of wall art, and put it right over the couch, not quite so high. Move most of those smaller art works and wreath to smaller walls, hallway, entranceway for instance, you want artwork with some impact from a distance. The white lampshade is okay, but i would change the material on the chair, an American Indian blanket would look great if it fits in with the room. If you prefer a solid color seat cover, maybe put an indian weaving on the wall. You want something eye-catching on the wall, and shapes of various sizes, and / or color here and there, so that your eyes move comfortable around the room from one pleasing combination of elements to another.

Your friend is completely wrong. When it comes to health there is a great many things wrong about being fat. Here's what medical researchers at Harvard have to say about it (article linked below):

>Among seminal findings was the first study to document the extraordinarily tight connection between the two diseases (Obesity and Diabetes). The work, by Walter Willett, the Harvard School of Public Health’s (HSPH) Stare Professor of Epidemiology and Nutrition, and by his colleagues showed that being even slightly overweight increased diabetes risk five times, and being seriously obese increased it 60 times. The study’s authors had to push just to get the results in print.

>“We had a hard time getting the first paper published showing that even slight overweight greatly increased the risk of diabetes,” Willett said. “They didn’t believe it.”

>They believe it now. Studies have shown that becoming overweight is a major risk factor in developing type 2 diabetes. Today, roughly 30 percent of overweight people have the disease, and 85 percent of diabetics are overweight.

My friend is a nurse in the only hospital in our mid-sized California city. She told me that 90% of the patients in the hospital are there for complications of diabetes. Diabetics have to carefully control food intake or they will suffer blindness, amputations, etc. There are so many complications of diabetes, and that's what kills diabetics. 

1, 2010 -- Diabetes cuts about 8.5 years off the life span of the average 50-year-old compared to a 50-year-old without diabetes, new research indicates. The study also shows that older adults with diabetes have a lower life expectancy at every age compared to people who do not have the disease.  - WebMD

Guitar,fcwv8zq,t1_fcvrj1r,1578039034.0,"I have 4 heriated discs, including two in my neck that pinch the nerves going to my right dominant arm and two in my lower back, all from injuries.

I have had lots of chiropractic, definitely only go to very good chiropractors, i prefer Palmer trained. Chiropracty gives quick relief, but needs frequent treatments if pain is significant. I have also had lots of Physical Therapy. Physical Therapists vary greatly in skill. At first i thought that physical therapy could do me hardly any good at all, then i finally saw some very good physical therapists. Bob and Brad ""the most famous physical therapists on the internet,"" have lots of very good advice videos on YouTube.

A low-fat whole foods plant-based diet can do wonders in relieving pain, because it improves circulation to your damaged tissues, (the back is not very vascular, and injuries can can take a long time to heal, but they are usually capable of much more healing than most people know). But you still have to be aware of your limitations in movement and lifting, to prevent constantly aggravating your condition and re-injuring yourself.  

Another thing that can help is prayer, once when i was in very great pain, it occurred to me to pray, and to my amazement, i got significant relief. It can also produce inspiration that leads you to seek healing in new and different ways. I prefer to meditate focusing on breath and calming my mind, and when my mind wanders as it inevitably does, i repeat my simple prayer for healing and then return to focus on the breath. I also see myself humbly and gratefully in the presence of the Great Spirit, who i envision simply as an infinite intelligence which has compassion for me, and good will towards me. You don't have to believe any dogma or say many words, just be there, in the Spirit, with your spiritual Source of which we are all a part. (I don't think that the spirit holds it against me if my concept is not accurate or correct, or even that i am far from saintly, so i don't worry about it, it works for me.) I don't know how or why it works but it does and it is magical and has saved me from much pain medication and despair. *Ask and you shall receive* said Jesus, who was supposed to have been a healer. Maybe it is placebo, or mind over matter, but it works for me. I have had many times i could not walk, for significant periods, and decades of pain, so i would try anything.

Also have hope, herniated disks are a common medical problem, and research hospitals all over the world are working furiously with stem cells to develop techniques to heal them.   One technique is to take stem cells from your olfactory nerve via your nose, and inject them into your herniated disc. Two weeks later, perfect disc!

So, please have hope, there are a lot of good options for healing, more all the time. All pain killers deaden the nerves, and so affect your brain and increase the risks of dementia, so i would not use them more that absolutely necessary. Same goes for self-medication. The cure can be worse than the disease.

I have known quite a few rich men from rich families, not as rich as trump, but it is just another world for them. Women throw themselves at them all the time. They make themselves sexually available as soon as they get a chance to communicate that to him. and someone who's experienced can read a great deal by a look. Just like you don't necessarily need to ask permission to kiss someone for the first time, you just know when their eyes give permission. Well for him, I am sure there are plenty of women who instantly ready to have sex. That is what he was saying, and it is disingenuous to say he has admitted to being a rapist and assaulting women. 

I don't see him as a rapist at all. I see him as a man who has loved his wives, although in an imperfect way, and also loves his daughters.

The very people who are calling Trump a rapist, want to let anyone who enters this country illegally become an citizen, many who come here doing human trafficing of children. One in 5 of illegal immigrant ""families"" who cross our southern border, claim to be with their children when DNA says those are not their children. They don't seem to mind that Mexico is a violent country and a lot of people come here for criminal purposes, gangs of criminals are profiting off violent crime like rape and human trafficing, that's a fact. But a lot of people are saying this lie that there is evidence that Trump is a rapist. And a lot of people have no problem with mass immigration from cultures where women and children are typically sold for sexual purposes and have female genital mutilation, and are kept in sexual slavery for life. And they have no problem with a religion that teaches it's members that it is completely okay to rape women and children of any other religion or who ascribe to no particular religion (that's not really a  religion, that's violent conquest disguised as religion, if we are stupid enough to accept immigrants who don't value our freedoms, those freedoms won't be there for our children and grandchildren). Trump is trying to protect our women and children from the rapes that are happening in other countries which have let themselves be overrun with people who religiously justify rape. So I don't think that these accusers of Trump care at all about rape. They have an whole 'nother agenda.

It's not like I think Trump is an perfect man, but he doesn't deserve the hysterical condemnations directed at him. I am so sick of the politicians on both sides. Our duty as adults is to protect our children and our freedoms. ""Oh, don't it seem to go, that we don't know what we've got till it's gone."""
AmItheAsshole,fcmj5zo,t3_ehyl3t,1577777415.0,"INFO. It doesn't matter if your mom's new boyfriend is significantly older, probably. Attending a wedding typically only takes a day, maybe two. Isn't it possible to go a day earlier or a day later? Or can you take public transportation, and or a shuttle or cab, with just a suitcase, and she arrive in a day or two with the rest of your things? 

It's kinda sad that there isn't someone else in your life to help you make this important step, but sometimes that is the way it is. My family was far from caring and I was on my own at 18 as soon as I graduated high school. I wish I had not wasted so much time, looking back in anger and wishing my life was different. Because if you are going to have to fend for yourself, you have a lot to learn and a lot to do. (Choose your friends carefully). 

But your life can be just as good as anyone's. But you can't make anyone else do what they don't want to do, including your mom.  A (wo)man convinced against her will, is of the same opinion still. Try to be understanding, your mom doesn't want to be alone all the time, she has found someone, try to be happy for her. It's good karma."
