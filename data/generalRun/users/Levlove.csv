Or 1 1/2  or so TBSP pudding mix and a TBSP chocolate chips.  

I don’t actually measure anymore, but that’s a rough estimate of how much I use.  The pudding mix is kind of cool because it thickens a little and makes the whole thing a little more like a mousse."

As for the original recipe, I use truvia/stevia sweetener and don’t really feel like it’s super bitter, but if you don’t like the tartness of Greek yogurt you could just use plain yogurt.  I love Fage yogurt because it’s crazy thick and indulgent feeling.  In either case, I never thought it tasted like cookie dough, but definitely it’s own thing that I eat all the time!"

nursing,ffqlskn,t3_eugr7w,1580138023.0,"I live in CT for context.  I’ve never had a coworker give a crap about anyone’s LGBTQ+ status.  Every once in awhile we will have a patient who is either racist or prejudiced in some other way, at which point the solution is simple:

“Oh Mr or Mrs Smith, we don’t want our coworker to be verbally abused by you, and of course we don’t want you to be uncomfortable with your caregivers, so we’re *happy* to get you someone else.  Of course you’ll understand that being added as an extra patient to someone else’s workload will result in some delays in care, but I’m sure you would prefer that to being cared for by someone of a different sexual orientation/color than you.”  Then we flounce out before they can respond.  Anytime they call for something (obviously not life threatening things) the response is something along the lines of “Shannon will be happy to get that glass of water for you, as soon as she can finish with her other patients!”  “Amanda would be happy to come change you, she just has a few things to finish first and she will be right in.”  Nursing care is pretty short and sweet, we go in, assess, provide meds, answer questions, and leave with zero small talk.  

If the patient complains to the nurse she/he usually just replies with something along the lines of “Sorry Mr Smith, we are very busy today, is there something you need that hasn’t been brought in?”  Usually they say “people are being rude to me” and we just tell them “you were rude to Vincent when you called him a Queermo and told him to get his homo ass away from you.  I don’t know why you would think any of us would go out of our way to be particularly nice to you after you verbally abused our coworker.  You have all of your needs provided for, and all of your medical concerns addressed.  If there is any other needs you have, I’m happy to have the charge nurse come in and address them.”  The charge nurses on my unit are very protective of staff, so they basically just repeat the same message.  We’ll provide for your physical and medical needs, but no one is going the extra step for you.  Obviously, we don’t want the abused employee going in anymore because they don’t need to be subjected to that kind of crap.  Luckily, it’s pretty rare that it happens; we had it happen maybe once or twice a year with our gay nursing assistants.  

When it’s someone racist it’s pretty funny because at least half the nurses and assistants are black, so if they do complain that now they have to wait we just bring in every POC on the floor at once, point to them, and say “if you choose to wait on white people to provide all your care, you need to accept that you’re going to wait a hellova long time.”  Get on up out of here with that bullshit.

Edit:  I was thinking I also should point out that I work in high enough acuity that a good deal of our patients don’t give a crap who is taking care of them, they are too sick to care and are grateful for anyone who will help them feel better.  The bullshit patients are always the healthiest ones.  High acuity is the way to go IMO if you want patients who care more about your skill set than what you look like."

In addition to my healthcare plan being more expensive than my husband’s, I’m restricted to using my own healthcare system and it’s affiliated offices.  Even providers who are “in network” for my insurance company aren’t covered the same if they aren’t in my actual healthcare network.  Basically, every time I want to see someone new I need to call and specifically make sure they are covered.  They don’t cover any pediatric specialists, because my company doesn’t employ any, so we had to file paperwork for my baby to have a procedure so they would cover it “at a lower rate”.  To make matters worse, my insurance company doesn’t cover many things that are considered routine care and covered by just about every other insurance company out there.

If someone suggested I leave my husband, I would have 50 reasons at the ready for why he is an amazing partner and I’m just venting a frustration.  It wouldn’t cross my mind that we should stay together because the logistics of splitting up are messy.  People divorce with kids and houses all the time.  It sounds like the longer you stay together the more distant you will become and it will likely end the same either way.

nursing,fffu632,t1_ffeba5m,1579891866.0,"Same - there were some residents on there posting about the “stupid” things nurses have pages them about and I’m thinking “those are things we know are benign but HAVE to page you about because it’s hospital policy.

Residency,ffftf8w,t1_ffby70b,1579891407.0,"I got reamed by an attending the other day for not letting the resident know that my patient with a GIB had a maroon colored stool that morning...again... as they had since they had been admitted.  This attending informed me that I was supposed to tell them every time the patient had a bloody stool, even if they were charted so that the team could just look in her chart and see.  So she got a text 6 times that day to let her know that the patient had another maroon colored stool.

Sometimes nurses are yelled at for unreasonable things, or sometimes it’s just a matter of protocol.  Granted, our night team is always awake because they work the ER at night, but we are supposed to inform the MD any time the patient has a fever.  I usually give Tylenol and inform them an hour later so I can also let them know they responded fine to the Tylenol and vitals are stable, so I technically followed protocol and they don’t have to think about it again.

Edit:  when I have to text over something that isn’t really a problem (like a random asymptomatic finger stick of 69 in the morning that I treated with a cup of juice and is now fine), I typically let the resident know it’s just an FYI because we have a protocol to let them know and I have to chart it.  That way they also know the next time someone texts them something that seems pretty benign that it’s not that we want to waste their time, we just have to let them know."

Now I have a perpetually mispronounced French last name because I’m married.  I don’t look anything like my last name and because my parents didn’t give me an Irish first name, I have no names that tie me to my identity.
