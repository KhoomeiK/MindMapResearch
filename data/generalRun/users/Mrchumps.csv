JoeRogan,ffetcic,t1_ffdiepq,1579864584.0,I thought he said he was also voting for Tulsi Gabbard?
DBZDokkanBattle,ffdphhg,t1_ffdp2ej,1579825867.0,You got it backwards. First time we see it is his fight with Majeets. Then the show off with Buu. However he achieved both SSJ2 and SSJ3 in otherworld. We don't know the specifics of how these were achieved or if he fought anybody with them.
DBZDokkanBattle,ffdox1j,t1_ffdou39,1579825510.0,That we know of.. Unless I'm forgetting something.
DBZDokkanBattle,ffdorrn,t1_ffdo0fs,1579825417.0,I would've liked a good filler episode showing him do it. Maybe against an otherworld enemy. Or challenging Cell to a rematch in Hell.
DBZDokkanBattle,ffdol5o,t1_ffdkw1i,1579825302.0,He definitely achieved and used it off screen before SSJ 3.
DBZDokkanBattle,ffdgvmr,t1_ffddhtm,1579820598.0,"It may have been off screen, but at some point SSJ 2 was Goku's strongest form."
DBZDokkanBattle,ffdd0eu,t1_ffdctjn,1579818286.0,What about when he first turned SSJ 2?
DBZDokkanBattle,ffd1fk0,t1_ffcvot2,1579811526.0,Order doesn't bother me. However super saiyan 2 has been SHAFTED!
modernwarfare,ffbrsls,t3_esj50a,1579780247.0,Aint played in a minute.. Thermite Crossbow what???
GODZILLA,ff9fdfa,t3_es15vr,1579711827.0,I love your art style. It's unique and makes Godzilla really pop.
FREE,ff955yc,t3_es5twv,1579705094.0,I'll buy dragon stones and I'll post what I pull in dragonball z dokkan battle!
GODZILLA,ff91600,t1_fefi3yd,1579702241.0,If i recall correctly it mentions him in the novelization.

GODZILLA,ff5pfmy,t1_ff5cxct,1579604670.0,Yeah how did Gigan come out looking so clean.
Cringetopia,ff4k8ih,t1_ff39tuz,1579565628.0,Okay but that's kind of hilarious especially towards the end. It comes across as satiracle.
Overwatch,ff393kh,t1_ff2zbtc,1579536586.0,Yeah one thing I do is find a good spot to swing around and around. Smack em around enough ro where they get annoyed and all take aim at you then just let go and roll away. Hit and run annoying gorrilla tactics with all that health goes a long way. Especially if they're dumb enough to chase you where you can knock em off the map.
gaming,ff2l85a,t3_er7w69,1579511376.0,"While it's not my favorite I did just buy the Naruto Ultimate Ninja Storm Legacy which is all 4 games in one package. I haven't been into naruto for about 10+ years, but just started watching through the series with my wife. I never finished it. So we're both enjoying it. Waiting to play the games to avoid spoilers, and I currently only have one controller. Super excited though! I'm sorry to hear about your break up. I hope you find someone willing to share your interest."
modernwarfare,ff0d8cb,t3_eqw5bp,1579467797.0,This looks even cooler man!

DragonballLegends,fesg9lb,t3_eqgm4z,1579364871.0,"I think this looks really awesome and sets itself apart from the rest. The only thing that throws me off is the separation of the gi for the tail. Like he's had to pull his pants down, and shirt up."

aww,fel1u9d,t1_fel0ieb,1579212233.0,"If it was anybody else recording the video (or if this was an article about the moment) I would be right there with you, and think it's just crazy and dumb to describe her as ""Man's wife."" But the headline's primary Job in this circumstance is to describe the video. Not describe her."
aww,fel13cl,t1_fel0pae,1579211785.0,Well repost are usually trying to describe the original post.
aww,fel04dj,t1_feky53a,1579211210.0,"I love my wife more than I do myself and would give my life for her in an instant. I belong to my wife, and she belongs to me. That's what marriage is. Neither of us would refer or treat the other as merely property."
aww,fekyqu5,t1_fekxiha,1579210385.0,"No it's not, and I'll tell you why. It's recorded by him on a cell phone. It just describes what you're about to click on. If this was recorded by a doctor or anybody else then yeah it'd be the same as your examples. With irrelevant information in the headline, and it'd be very strange having her described as ""man's wife""."
aww,fekxyrg,t1_fekwxv2,1579209918.0,"I mean you could and it's an acurate description, but I don't think people would care as much. The two of them being in love is what helps make the video precious. When you say it has nothing to do with him. You are so completely wrong. She's hearing the love her life's voice for the first time.    

If my wife suddenly lost her hearing all I would care about is her getting her hearing back. That's all i would pray for, and if she ever did it would be the happiest moment of my life. Because it'd be the happiest moment in her life. That's what love is, and it's evident in the video. How are you blind to it?"
aww,fekw01y,t1_fekuws9,1579208750.0,"How is it not? You may not be able to see his face, but you can hear the Joy in his voice as much as hers. The moment is extra special for her because he's there. Her being described as her husband's wife is just a description. I mean I'm not gonna care if someone describes me as ""Mariah's husband."". I could spend the rest of my life without my name, and forever be referred to as Mariah's husband and not care. I don't see why you people are so triggered by a title of a video."
aww,fekuc3r,t1_fekq7l1,1579207769.0,When you're married these moments are precious to both parties. You share everything together. Whether it's a nice moment like this or something tragic you go through it together.
aww,fektuj3,t1_fektmv6,1579207481.0,Okay cause I usually assume that when someone uses the word partner. If the title had used it I would've naturally thought this is a gay couple.
aww,fektbi5,t1_feksjuo,1579207169.0,"I see and agree with your point, but why did you replace the word husband with partner. What's wrong with the word husband?"
aww,feksogv,t1_fekrgzg,1579206788.0,"Um I do? I see these kinds of videos posted all the time. I don't always watch them, but the title let me know this one was a couple, and the husband was filming. I thought it was gonna be a sweet precious moment. Can you imagine what it must be like to not only be hearing for the first time in forever, but hearing the person you're married to for literally the first time. That's why I clicked and watched it.         
  
NO ONE is trying to takeaway her individuality.
The title is just being descriptive of what's portrayed. Now if the husband wasn't even there and it was just a recording her friend or someone did. Then yeah I'd raise an eyebrow and go that's a weird way to describe someone. However that's not the case. You could've titled this video 'women hears her husband' voice for the first time' or 'Man watches wife's hearing restored' OR even 'strong independent women gets hearing back while HER husband holds the camera for HER.'         
Any of these titles describe the video."
aww,fekqq42,t1_fejyqa7,1579205645.0,Because she's his wife? The title is just discriptive of what's portrayed in the video. The aww post is just a shortened version of the original. By reading the title I knew right off the bat he was the one recording. You people are over analyzing for nothing.
NarutoNinjaStorm,fehk1ak,t1_fe6k7gj,1579118127.0,"Well turns out there was some glitch because now it's showing the legacy edition on ps4 for $20. Says it's been that way since the 20th, but I KNOW it said 70 the other day. Kinda lame, but what ever. Now and I have the trilogy on switch and Legacy on the Ps4."
GODZILLA,fehguq1,t1_fehe695,1579116262.0,Yeah we get to see Godzilla tank a black hole.
GODZILLA,feft0e1,t3_eow5wr,1579064301.0,This is a cool meme. This movie is one of my favorites. It's underated in my opinion.
GODZILLA,feesrdy,t1_feeq31l,1579040421.0,Yeah turns out that leak that has godzilla with the shotgun. Is only the first act. Kong comes back better than ever.
modernwarfare,feelb5n,t3_e4q2i6,1579036064.0,"I'm you from the future. I've come to tell you fara will be available with the battle pass, and the other one Nikto becomes available through a bundle you have to purchase."

GODZILLA,fedqhma,t3_eok4yb,1579017689.0,"The tone of this trailer was sooo awesome. It really made it feel like Godzilla was gonna be this ruthless force of nature that would be terrifying for all humanity. I'm happy with what we got, but this would've been great as well."
aww,fedfhkq,t3_eokyfc,1579010100.0,May I ask why ya'll were told this?
news,fe9cbrb,t1_fe9369b,1578936314.0,Well you're wrong. I never called you evil. I said demhumanizing a whole group based off your own prejudice is evil.
news,fe915xv,t1_fe8z8wh,1578933074.0,Okay now you're just being ridiculous. Good day sir.
news,fe8yib1,t1_fe8x9yb,1578932371.0,"That's not a good measuring stick for evil.. You can ask most cops those same questions and the answers are gonna be 0. The same as yours. Yet you'd still call them evil. Amber Leist was trying to help someone in need, and in fact she did. When her life was taken from her. But if she wasn't a mother you'd be celebrating this fact. How can you not see how truly wrong this is??"
news,fe8wl1d,t1_fe8uxl6,1578931881.0,How about you try judging people off they're individual character and merit? Rather then demhumanize a whole group based off your own prejudice. Because that's not right at all. It's evil.
news,fe8v5id,t1_fe8tsjl,1578931306.0,If I didn't know anything about them personally how would I know they're cartel members? I don't know why you think it's crazy to just give people respect.
news,fe8t0mz,t1_fe8sqpb,1578930445.0,I automatically give everyone respect. It's a part of  being a decent person. You give respect to get it.
news,fe8pqgk,t1_fe8pj8l,1578929033.0,Because she's a person.
news,fe8o6n8,t1_fe8mouj,1578928436.0,Even if she wasn't a mom! It's still terrible. Not a cause for celebration!
news,fe8m0iu,t1_fe8ljip,1578927738.0,"No because she was a decent human being who was trying to help someone, and you shouldn't be celebrating her death just because she's a police officer. Seriously what is wrong with you? Your comment is disgusting, and you should be ashamed of yourself."

NarutoNinjaStorm,fe6jj7l,t1_fe6d3x3,1578892949.0,"Well i have a ps4, and I don't see what having a ps5 has to do with anything. I imagine the game just runs better on ps4?"
NarutoNinjaStorm,fe61u30,t1_fe5zntp,1578879890.0,Yeah thats what im doing! Thanks for the reply ill delete this post.
NarutoNinjaStorm,fe5zypb,t1_fe5zntp,1578878700.0,Yeah i think that's where im leaning i think its on sale for 20. Plus my wife likes the switch and we can play on road trips and such.
