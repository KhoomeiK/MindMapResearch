And the thing is a lot of these obese people are actually suffering from malnutrition (which is different from undernutrition). They're huge but they aren't getting the required vitamins and minerals and proteins and essential fats that the body needs. So the option to just stop eating or eat a lot less as another person in the thread suggested isn't really going to help, it'll just make things worse, it'll make them more ill, which if we're still talking about the cost to the healthcare system then it's the wrong way to go."

Sounds pretty awful to me. Maybe that's just a specific Chicago problem rather than a northern cities problem in general
   
The video I watched that I learned this in was actually about the film Candyman, and it was fascinating, if went into how that film was secretly a film about this ghettoization in Chicago and the poverty and issues that happened in some of the communities.

My grandma on my dad's side, died when I was 2 so I never knew her, but my dad says it was absolutely horrifying and soul crushing watching her deteriorate from the alzheimers. He said in his mind, she died years before her body died.
  
Her first language was Welsh, but she spoke English too. But as she got worse, she forgot more and more English until she could only speak Welsh by the end, and my dad doesn't speak Welsh so he couldn't even really talk to her even when she was lucid
   
He said it started with the most mundane of things, like seeing an actor on TV and forgetting his name, except it kept happening with more and more till she could never put a name to the face of so many actors on screen. Then my dad realised it was serious when he and her were out shopping, bumped into an old friend of hers she hadn't seen since school decades before, they started catching up and telling each other about their lives
  
And then when asked how many kids my grandma had, she said ""oh just the 2, [my uncle] and [my dad]. Then my dad turned to her and said something like ""umm aren't you forgetting someone?“. She'd completely forgotten her youngest child, my dad's sister, my aunt
  
It went like that, going backwards. She forgot more and more of the most recent events, almost regressed back to her childhood, that was all she could remember by then.
 
And yeah my dad said the last time she recognised him was a year before she died. After that she was a shell of who she was. It crushed my dad, he said it took him years to grieve. Watching your loved ones die in such an emotionally wrenching way is the worst thing
  
And alzheimers is hereditary so I'm terrified my dad will end up the same, though he's 65 and it hasn't appeared yet. But also I might get it, both because it's genetic and because I have schizophrenia which makes it way more likely I'll get it anyway, as just living with a mental illness even when you're managing it well with meds and therapy, slowly rots your brain.

It's on pc and all the consoles, and it's like a full game version of P.T., hell it's even got a section where you're running around the same square of corridors over and over with things changing, just like P.T.
  
I bought it twice, on pc and switch, cos it was so different from most horror games, like there's barely any real jump scares in it, it's more about the mood and atmosphere being so creepy, and the geometry of levels changing when you turn your back to them, like the house you're in is alive, rather than there being ghosts. And there's a story there but you have to kinda figure it out yourself, it's not explicitly told to you, but if you read all the letters and stuff you pick up it becomes quite clear what it's actually about, like it's more about suffering from a mental illness than a ghost
  
It reminded me a lot of the book House of Leaves too, which similarly has a house that is ""alive"" and lots of weird frightening geometry stuff fucking with your mind, and lots of letters and extracts of stuff that add extra context (like halfway through the book you go to the index and start reading there for a bit). It's the weirdest book, it's so good, you have to read it upside down or with a magnifying glass/zoom on your phone camera, all sorts of stuff, it's great.

It's 2 actions rather than 1, save 5 and kill 1, instead of the 1 action to save 5 and whoops some dude is killed as a side effect
  
It could be made better to reflect that if that's the choice. Maybe not use the trolley problem at all, come up with some other hypothetical. Like perhaps using some kind of medical scenario, where you can cure 5 people of a terminal illness if you extract all the blood from 1 other person to inject into them, but doing that kills that 1 person. You do nothing, the 5 die, but if you choose to kill the 1 person to save the 5, then it's a deliberate action you've taken that ends in the death of someone even if you are technically saving others, whereas if you do nothing, more people die, but arguably that's not your fault at all because you didn't do anything and weren't involved (or that it *is* your fault if you think that failing to act when you had the opportunity is just as bad as making a bad choice itself)

It also is incredibly useful to do this when you have your instrument too. When you're learning and practicing, imagine everything in incredible detail before you move your fingers to that position. It'll make it way way faster to learn and get quick at whatever it is e.g. Some sweeping arpeggio shredding metal solo or whatever, compared to just practicing by mindlessly repeating the thing over and over

Like wear them all day for a few weekends. Walk around in them a fair bit but not too much. Formal shoes never usually feel good the first time you put them on, but if they're leather they'll gradually mould to the shape of your feet if you were them enough, and can become insanely comfy if you find the right pair and wear them enough
  
Obviously don't wear them too much, cos you're meant to leave them to let them rest, and use leather conditioner. But yeah before any wedding I buy a new pair of shoes cos I like buying new shoes, and the process to wear them in for a few weeks, like I'll put them on when I get home cos I'm not gonna be walking around much at home so they don't get uncomfortable
  
Also wear two pairs of socks when you're wearing them in, to push the leather a bit more outwards. I wear two pairs of sports socks, the thick ones, while wearing them in, and then obviously wear smart socks (the thin ones) on the day of the wedding or whatever it is
  
And once you find a perfect pair, that feel comfortable, *take good care of them*, and then they can last you decades. Like use the conditioner like I said before, put in shoe trees when not wearing them, polish them thoroughly every so often. You can keep a good pair of leather shoes alive for a very long time, and they can become super comfortable after a few years of using them.
  
Alternatively, the secret service and other similar organisations wear formal leather shoes that are actually hidden running shoes, in case they have to run quickly as part of their job. You could try and find a pair of them perhaps"

Austin talks about it a lot, whatwho he'd wrestle if he had one more match, but he makes it clear he'd rather be able to walk/be alive than do another match.

And it didn't shy away from talking about things like religion, it was actually the main theme of the show.
   
Then they wrote themselves into a corner, which the writers themselves admitted, and they ended up using very literal deus ex machinas all over the place (with the religion aspect) and the fate of humanity boiled down to *a Bob Dylan song*. Seriously. It was just dumb af.
