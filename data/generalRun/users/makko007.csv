bookscirclejerk,ffi5fii,t3_etp1tg,1579965570.0,I’ve never read 1984 but I feel like on this subreddit it’s like a reverse peer pressure to so every time I see it in a bookstore I’m just in a brief wonder what to do

AskReddit,ffdtvdg,t3_cvajws,1579828797.0,"I have a scar on my head and neck from 1. Her slamming me into a table when I was five and 2. Scaring the cat while it was on me so it scratched the shit out of me.

She’s loud, aggressive, screams, throws tantrums, starts fights to belittle/ degrade people, and blames everyone, *everyone* for her problems.

Another few things,

1. She came in my room screaming and crying that our cousin was dead, and when I was freaking out, started laughing hysterically since she’d made it all up.
2. Would steal money from me, sometimes hundreds of dollars.
3. Would humiliate/ torment our autistic brother
4. Fat shame everyone: I grew up extremely underweight/ unhealthily thin and insecure thinking I was fat because of her


So yeah, that’s that."
