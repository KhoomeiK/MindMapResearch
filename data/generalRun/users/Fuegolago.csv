dji,ff8a9a2,t3_eryuti,1579670688.0,I'm trying two more (different) phones today and if it fails again I'm shipping that thing back. Sad times.
Gloomhaven,ff898ol,t3_es6lvw,1579669738.0,"IIRC you have to manually toss those aside. Did you add these manually or was there some button to add those automatically (can't remember, haven't played in a while)? I think if there's button to add those automatically then they would get removed automatically but if you add them manually they won't get removed"
photography,ff88ker,t3_es70yo,1579669136.0,50mm is a bit tight at certain places where 22mm will cover most situations from indoors to outdoors. Then again I have 50mm 1.4 as my go-to lens on a full sized sensor
Gloomhaven,ff6bjb4,t1_ff6afpv,1579623584.0,"Yeah, that is right and thank you for clarification"
Gloomhaven,ff64zk8,t1_ff64rzd,1579619262.0,2. They move if they can perform attack action on that same turn. They stay put if they can't attack. Monsters do not plan ahead.
Gloomhaven,ff64502,t3_ervnwb,1579618663.0,"Other guards try to hit next closest/fastest player with least movement reguired. If they can't get in reach to hit they stay put. Monsters always focus on a empty hex where they can perform attack action (rather than specific player, to simplify your thought process)."
dronevideos,ff5np5l,t1_ff5jxdb,1579602093.0,Very good results anyway especially if you were editing for first time!

photoshop,ff5h0hd,t1_ff5gqt0,1579592477.0,Ok fair enough but how can Google know how it looks on your given image?
photoshop,ff5fvc1,t3_err2q0,1579591066.0,"Why Googling when you can just try what those do? I understand my most used blend modes and after those it is just testing which gives desired results. There's some logic to those tho. I don't remember exactly in what order these go because I'm not on photoshop now but those modes are separated in to own sub categories, one darkens, one lightens, one mixes and so on... IIRC first one with multiply in it is the one category which darkens things. That section where's Screen is the one which lightens things etc......

Edit. Typo"
Gloomhaven,ff2ohjl,t3_erbe8q,1579516388.0,Gloomhaven campaign tracker is good app if app usage is something you can do. There you add your achievements etc and app shows you which missions are available/blocked/completed.
Gloomhaven,ff2oat0,t3_erbgpd,1579516104.0,"Are you saying that you don't share monsters hit points with others? That info should be available for everyone. You can't say exactly what your initiative number is but you can say something like ""I'm going fairly slow"" or ""I try to go first""... As manager/operator/dm you don't keep any monster info hidden and if you like everyone can link their gloomhaven Helper on same network and everyone can see hit points etc from their own devices. Players can also insert their own initiatives through Helper app and as long as round gets started there would be question marks for players initiative numbers which are revealed once round starts."

photography,fezh62j,t3_eqzpcl,1579457297.0,"Small, cheap dslr camera so you can buy better lenses later on if desired. But if you think you won't take dslr with you everywhere then some of those compact cameras with fixed zoom lens would be better option.

It doesn't matter which brand you buy, they are all just fine from performance perspective."
blackmagicdesign,fexexc2,t1_fen3my3,1579429881.0,"I'm having problems with this. Holding ctrl key while dragging a clip to time line between two clips does not ""push"" other clip away but instead new clip is overlapping that other clip. I'm working on PC."

Warframe,feqywxl,t3_eqf8sh,1579347674.0,What platform? I played this maybe six times yesterday and had no problems when Hemocyte appeared. PS4
Gloomhaven,fen8tvd,t3_epnx7n,1579279487.0,"Do you want to play every starting character before opening sealed characters through retirement or why you have to settle for starting characters after retirement? That combo is not optimal, I personally don't like brute even a little, and tinkerer is a support character where support characters shine with bigger party. Tinkerer has some good damage cards and other gadgets so I think that duo is totally playable.

Not optimal combo, but playable, think about using summons too"

Gloomhaven,fejcgzz,t1_fejbvdl,1579167109.0,"Yeah and that is why that rule is a bit wonky. Everyone can think of ways to say numbers without saying those numbers ie. city area speed limit. So I wouldn't allow use of those terms either, if you really want to play RAW"
Warframe,fejbyh2,t1_fejbgll,1579166329.0,New to F2P concept? It is a pain to wait for your first new warframe but after a while there's several frames waiting in your printer when you level up your current frame. Just put new frame in printer at Friday and spend weekend doing other things and on Monday you have your new shining frame.
Gloomhaven,fejbp69,t3_epgwl1,1579165945.0,"Yeah this is a bit random thing, I mean I have played campaign two times to completion and I can pretty much know what cards are in play for certain character. I'd say that you can't say ie. ""I'm going to hit that archer for 3 damage"" but you can say that ""I'm going after ranged enemies""... In the end, situation might and will be totally different from before round start and by the time you get to do your turn."

premiere,fe83ql1,t1_fe822cd,1578922176.0,"Are you using a LUT? If yes, then do not use LUT. First example is good in quality, and imo only needs a bit of contrast and very little saturation"

premiere,fe7unrq,t3_eo3ir1,1578919459.0,Is your source footage heavily saturated and/or has big contrast? You want to shoot as 'flat' as possible to give more room for post production.

I'm not sure if you log in while connected to internet and then you go offline and start PS if PS will remember your log in information... Worth a try if you can get internet access temporarily

Battlefield,fe0azyr,t3_enipi7,1578808244.0,HC went unplayable after BF3 when teammates killed own players to get jet or helicopter. Until that time I only played HC but after that phenomenon I haven't even thought of playing HC. And normal mode is kinda good when you get used to it.
Gloomhaven,fe0alel,t3_enj2o0,1578807862.0,Increasing your characters levels would increase mission difficulty at some point ;) but I'd add that xp and just move on

photoshop,fdv2ma5,t3_en6cg0,1578742429.0,"You definitely can do that! Is it big enough in resolution? You can use curves to bring up midtones and while at it, you might want to bring dark areas a bit down (left most part of diagonal line) and highlights up too (rightmost area of that same line) to give contrast to that photo. Midtones are at the middle of that line and when you bring that up you make photo a bit flat, hence contrast tweak. Then you can go to filters and use 'unsharp mask' to sharpen that image.

Those are little, quick things you can do while I don't know what photo looks like exactly."

logodesign,fdmkm2p,t3_em5ub7,1578553426.0,Could that number be same color as other font? I'm not too sure about that icon sitting inside number 5 but can't suggest other place for it also :/

Gloomhaven,fdmi526,t1_fdlrcw9,1578550740.0,Tank-thing was half a joke because generally in this game you can't tank and your goal is to avoid any damage or kill enemies before they hit you.
Gloomhaven,fdlbetq,t3_elzf7d,1578520435.0,"Good luck to those who try to tank with Brute :D

Quote below. What do you mean by 'deck of level 1 cards'? Each character gets deck which contains cards up to level 9 but when you start you can only use level 1/X cards. 

""Each class includes:

A miniature

Character mat

Deck of level 1 cards

Attack modifier adjustment cards"""

Warframe,fdg3tiz,t3_el7cvl,1578378958.0,2. Limbo is a solid solo frame because you can switch in to rift where you can't take damage from any source including laser beams/doors. Look into it among those already mentioned.

Warframe,fd8oa80,t3_ekb1cc,1578220843.0,One thing I would like to see in the future is 'favorite' weapons option. I'm speeding MR ranks and I don't even remember how many weapons I have sold and what were good. Once I find some good weapons there's high chance I might sell it because I can't remember if it was any good. So simple favorite mark would do wonders when clearing inventory.
