That literally just isn't true.  That is you making up extra criteria for a word that already has a definition.  You are attributing common lifestyle traits to a word that just describes a particular diet.  

>Veganism goes farther than just personal food consumption. Its a complete lifestyle.

No, it really doesn't.  You might equate it with that in your mind, but ""vegan"" has an official definition and there is nothing in it outside of diet.

You can believe whatever you want to believe, but that doesn't actually make it true."

Then you have to factor in a couple of kids, statistically speaking, and all the healthcare costs they incur, plus all of the couples healthcare costs on the way to retirement, and then you throw in one serious illness, maybe a fight with cancer, and I'm not even entirely convinced that $29,500 a year is high enough."
