Democracy is a glorified popularity contest, and who you vote for ultimately decides who has the right to use violence upon the population. This is why the electoral college is important, and should be imitated on a state level. A candidate for governor of California can (and sometimes do) win the election by campaigning only in CA's largest cities by population, leaving suburbs and rural areas fucked without an effective voice. Hillary Clinton tried this strategy on a national level and appealed mostly to big cities back in 2016, and while she won the popular vote, she got pummeled where the votes actually matter.

>For example, it became clear rather early on that the majority of victims of the Terror were ordinary workers and peasants — people who presented no challenge to Stalin’s power. When Stalin’s private papers were released in 2000, historians initially expected to see a gap between them and Stalin’s public self-presentation as a loyal follower of Lenin and defender of the Revolution. But it wasn’t there. **In public and in private, Stalin was committed to building socialism, not to building a personal dictatorship for its own sake.**"
