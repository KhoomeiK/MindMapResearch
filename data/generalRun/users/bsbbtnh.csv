That's a gross mischaracterization of the 'Powell Doctrine'. It was actually about a growing trend of trying to link art to 'lost tribes' that there was no evidence for, in order to attract people to exhibits. Powell didn't like this, and basically said that it is ok to show these things, but making up origins for them was not in the purview of the Smithsonian, and to cut that shit out.

TheMotte,fft5v8w,t1_ffsvpg4,1580208721.0,"I don't see how a Walmart union would benefit workers. They get decent pay and benefits. Most unions for low-skill jobs have one thing in common; they whittle away the benefits of 'new' employees in exchange for *more* benefits for long-term employees.

So I imagine a union at Walmart will see wages for new employees fall, benefits becoming scaled based on length of service, hours based on seniority, etc. 

I'm in Canada. My sister worked at a unionized grocery store. Minimum wage had been raised above what the union had negotiated in their 5-year contract. Basically their contract was something like $0.10 raise each year for everyone, and you get a standard $0.10 raise every couple hundred hours.

But once you reached 7,500 hours, you received a $1.50 raise or something crazy, essentially putting you at $22+/hour. Unless you're customer service, a clerk, or other jobs like that, which your wage would top out at like $17/hr. All the long term employees know to get into the bakery, stocking shelves, meat, deli, etc. 

My sister left that job (she got injured, the union didn't give a shit, and she was basically forced out) and then went to Walmart, where she started above minimum wage, above what she was working for at the unionized place, *and* she didn't have to pay union dues (which had put her below minimum wage..) and she literally has more benefits at Walmart."

Basically, the book is written by a pimp. In it, he talks about a situation where one of his top prostitutes 'snaps'. He says every prostitute goes through this. So the pimp tells her he'll let her leave if she takes one more customer, and all she has to do is put something in the dude's drink, so they can rob him (IIRC).

Anyways, the prostitute puts the stuff in the customer's drink. But the customer dies. She calls the pimp in a panic. He goes into the hotel room, looks around, and gives her a hug. Tells her he'll take care of it, but she'll owe him, but can work it off. He got another few years out of her.

Turns out, the customer never died.  It was a setup, meant to make the prostitute think that she'd done something 'wrong' so that the pimp could pretend to be her hero, and continue to exploit her.

So when Dave fled to Africa, I don't think that was some ""I'm finding myself"" type shit. I think that was ""I'm fleeing because I've committed a crime."" And then Viacom tells him they can 'fix' the problem, but they have no reason to do it if he doesn't do another season (and another, and another, and another..). Dave must have found out that whatever he'd fled wasn't real, and that's why he felt he could still leave the show.

He'd done that somewhat cryptic interview with Oprah years ago. It was rather interesting watching that show and coming out with more questions than answers. I think he'd also brought up other actors who'd done strange things, like Martin Lawrence, as if he was implying that whatever caused them to have those freak outs was the same thing that cause him to flee to Africa. (Martin Lawrence, IIRC, was running down the streets of LA, freaking out, with a gun in his hand).

TheMotte,ffq7yhi,t1_ffq4fqy,1580125175.0,"Chappelle was telling a joke. It's amazing that comedy has now been framed as having to be a socially responsible endeavor. It feels like the way 80s/90s family sitcoms always had some progressive moral for each episode. Now people think every joke needs to have a message behind it, and the 'correct' one as well. And not just that, it has to be *blatantly* spelled out.

Chappelle's joke about MJ's accusers isn't really a dig at them; unless they believe Dave is actually saying that people should be honored to be molested by Michael (that was literally part of his joke..). It's frightening that people seem to pick and choose what to take seriously from his routine.

He also said every black person should legally purchase a firearm, if they truly want gun reform. Yet I didn't see the media talk about that. He also talked about murdering a bunch of crack heads. Weird that the media didn't call him out for committing murder. Oh right, they somehow managed to figure out *he was joking*. 

It's obvious that they just want clicks. And ""Dave Chappelle made me laugh"" won't get anybody to click.

On the bigger picture, most people seem to forget that the vast majority of minorities are far more conservative than your average liberal/Democrat. Blacks tend to be more conservative (especially socially conservative) than Republicans. More religious, too. So it isn't surprising that someone like Dave is popular and successful, while holding a mirror to identity politics and crushing PC culture.

Democrats are risking a substantial portion of their base to Republicans. For decades they've used ""Republicans = racist"" as a fundamental way to ensure that minorities keep voting blue. Whether Trump is able to garner more minority votes, I have no idea. But I feel that once Trump leaves office, that Democrats won't be able to pull the race card anymore. Their accusations against Trump have been so wild that they won't be able to do that against your average politician. The media can't even pretend Bush is racist anymore.

Not to mention the fact that the Tea Party and then Trump have largely pulled the Republican party to the left on a lot of social issues (or at least put those issues to bed). I think we'll likely see the Republican Party grow as people reject identity politics. Add in the fact that the Democrats seem to ignore blacks and legal hispanic voters, and are instead promising the world to illegal immigrants, transwomen, etc. It seems like we're primed for a radical change in the political landscape in the next decade. It'll be interesting to see if blue states withdraw their National Popular Vote laws if the Republican tent starts growing."

There are typically protocols for that. For instance, every British nuclear submarine has a letter on board, written by the Prime Minister, with specific instructions on what to do if a probable war breaks out and they cannot make contact with higher ups. It is presumed that the instructions are to submit to an ally's command. 

For everyone that isn't a nuclear submarine, the standard is to connect with other units, allied countries, etc.

So if you're US forces in a garrison in Germany, the world goes to shit and you can't contact your command, you basically submit your forces to Germany. There may be stipulations that you only take a defensive role, and avoid any offensive missions that doesn't further American interests.

This is basically how it was during most wars, since contact with your chain of command was much more difficult in the past. It's why fighting usually continued for days/weeks/months after a war ended. But nowadays, with nuclear bombs creating a scenario where the outbreak of a war can lead to your command being immediately cut off, those protocols are more important."

If anything, this process is *better* than most, since it is actually two completely separate departments handling it. DHS is in charge of immigration in the US. But the immigration court is controlled by DOJ (same with the BIA). When you go before an immigration court, it is DHS arguing the case, and DOJ appointed 'judges' that rule. Same on appeal to the BIA. Once it goes to the US Court of Appeals, it is the DOJ who argues the case. 

The interesting thing about this case in particular is that neither DHS nor the AG's office (DOJ) were arguing in favor of the BIA. DHS never presented that argument to them. AG never defended that argument to the US Court of Appeals. And I Think that's why the courts didn't rain fire and fury down on the BIA/DOJ/AG. 

Now the precedent could be specific to the 7th circuit, while other circuits have ruled differently. It's possible with immigration 'judges' having been moved around that whoever was on that BIA didn't know this was precedent in the 7th circuit. So when the case comes before them, they cut it down. When the Court of Appeals kicks it back to them, they don't take the time (probably because they are swamped with cases) to dig into the case law, and they end up issuing the same ruling."

TheMotte,ffm5iht,t1_ffegogm,1580048765.0,"Problem with public transit in the majority of cities is that it isn't consistent. Everyone hates public transit for a variety of reasons. It usually becomes a political issue. And after every local election, some politician who knows nothing about public transit usually ends up tinkering with it, thinking they've got it covered. And it always blows up in their face.

A big problem is ridership. Many cities will look at evening/weekend/holiday ridership numbers and say ""wow, barely anybody rides it at that time, on that day"". And they think cutting the hours, limiting availability, eliminating routes, shutting down on holidays, will result in *savings* that exceed lost revenue. What usually happens is that you lose everybody who works late, who works early, who works weekends, and who work holidays. You also lose a ton of people who work during the day, but also need public transit to go shopping in the evening. 

These could be people taking the bus during regular work hours twice a day, but 1 day a week they take an evening bus somewhere. Suddenly they need a car or a cab. And when that cab costs the same as their monthly bus pass, suddenly owning a car becomes a lot more desirable.

Anyways, city council (or the city manager) will make these changes. They'll lose a ton of riders. They think things will change. And when ridership continues to decline, they get cold feet and reverse it. And what happens? More people stop riding. Those are people you gained, yet never realized because you'd lost so many from your last change.

And then transit becomes an election issue.. and someone new comes in and.. you go through the cycle, again and again.

People *can't afford* inconsistent, unreliable transit. Especially the people who *need* affordable transportation. It doesn't matter how good public transit is, nobody is going to bet their car on a politician not fucking it up in the next couple years. You can lose your livelihood overnight because of a transit change. So its better to have your car and insulate yourself from the whims of some public officials or politicians with supersized campaign promises to fulfill."

>buses don't run early enough to meet my official start time.

I think this is the Achilles heel for most public transit. If you don't run ~18 hours/day, than the majority of low-income users are missing half their trip (since most jobs outside the 9-5 are lower wage). Cities don't want to extend the hours because of cost and lower revenue/ridership outside their main hours. But not having extended hours lowers the revenue/ridership during their main hours. 

Same issue with holidays and weekends. These are typically times when low wage workers are more likely to work, and it is also the time when public transit has reduced hours, fewer buses/trains, or are shut down completely. The very time that the people who most need it can't access it."
