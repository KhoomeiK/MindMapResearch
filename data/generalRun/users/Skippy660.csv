buildmeapc,fewhnu5,t3_eql5kt,1579410751.0,"I had this problem, here's what i did to fix it, keep in mind for this fix to work you will need any other functioning GPU. First I swapped out the GPU with my older, working GPU, then booted to BIOS. Then I changed the PCIe speed from 'auto' to '3.0'. This is because by default, it was trying to run at PCIe 4.0, and when it runs at that speed, it recognises the GPU as an NVMe drive, instead of a GPU, it's weird. Anyways I hope this helps, if not then I'm out of suggestions.

Edit - I just read that your old GPU doesn't work either. My bad..."
