mildlyinfuriating,feexbh7,t1_feewnt1,1579043246.0,"Not the one I went to. How the system works is they hold the game disk until the customer buys it, so they don’t steal it. It was kinda sketch so I don’t know if it was a real game stop or not to be honest."

The aids said that it was all part of growing and that I should stop worrying about it and get back to work. I was mentally scarred for a while, but not that long. Then I freaking tear a hole in my shirt and I get sent to the principals office for disrupting and distracting the class. I am so glad that I’m done with that school and I don’t have that much memory of it."
