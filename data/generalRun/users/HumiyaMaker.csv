paypal,ffb9el0,t3_esj56y,1579756042.0,"People hijack emails for paypal all the time. Its most likely a throw away account or stealth account that the perp created in order to steal funds. 

They purchase the account names in bulk and then sell them to scammers to make multiple paypal accounts at a time.

While I would contact paypal, please note that the account may already be banned/limited and a waste of time to try to retrieve. 

use a new email and put security on the account to avoid issues like this in the future"
paypal,ffb5xxs,t3_esjzv6,1579752668.0,Exact thing I went through 2 weeks ago trying to pay someone. In the end. They told me I wouldnt be able to use their services anymore but then told me to try to link and relink my CC. I told them to fod off.
paypal,ffa1861,t1_ffa0g44,1579725835.0,"It really doesnt matter to paypal. We as sellers don't matter.

It is VERY rare that they will side with you. 
They feel that you need them and they need the buyer to stay happy and keep coming back.

If you have strong proof you are being scammed, Meaning ALL the evidence, file a BBB report or a IC3 police report against the person who scammed you. 

They will most likely bite the bullet and give you the money back because  IC3 will contact them to ask them about the situation. And again, they are not a bank and shouldn't be trusted with money.

Ive seem others do 
boxing videos
Delivery videos
time stamps
emails 
personal deliveries 
etc 
and STILL lose money. 

I made a living just filing BBB complaints for people or helping them with cases."
paypal,ff9zso0,t1_ff9wus6,1579724996.0,"yeah that may be different. They caught the issue beforehand. Ive had those too.

I mean the person got the item after sale, used it then flat out called paypal and told them it wasnt them. 

in my case, it was game codes they won, used and then did the unauthorized move like a month later.

 I called the gaming company, explained the situation, showed them that I indeed purchased the code and they shut the account down. The guy left me a series of emails asking what happened then cursed me out because it caused his system to get banned."
paypal,ff9y6he,t1_ff9cchr,1579724050.0,"They claim BS all the time. There have been class action lawsuits against paypal and people who take them to small claims all the time. They are not a bank so they change the rules to suit their needs. They steal simply by saying you arent who you say you are and we need more info or simply say you were selling something fake. 
They are the worst."
paypal,ff9vwze,t1_ff97xz3,1579722671.0,"Did you have to call in? 
ive had 3 in my entire paypal history and lost 2 out of the 3.
Only won the last one because I had a high standing seller account and the rep just gave me the funds back."
paypal,ff93zr2,t1_ff9372o,1579704292.0,"Yes. Despite the website.

Give them a ring to see if they will honor their agreement.

Its highly unlikely. 

An unauthorized dispute is not an item not received or SNAD case.

Unauthorized means the CC company is involved and the person didnt make that transaction. (Which is a lie in this case) 

But paypal will make you eat the loss in this case.

Call them but be prepared to lose. 

Ive dealt with paypal since 2009. They protect themselves first."
paypal,ff933uf,t1_ff92wqj,1579703666.0,"It means nothing at all sadly.

Paypal does not even follow their own rules and once they find out youre selling digital items, they will likely issue a warning to you or limit your account and tell you that you wont be able to use their services anymore."
paypal,ff921z4,t3_eschwa,1579702909.0,"digital is not covered and you have no tracking.

Best recourse to do is contact the code the company is for and tell them the code was stolen.

Obviously, never send digital goods through ebay or paypal. Paypal themselves are a load of scammers"

paypal,fevuopf,t3_eqqipb,1579401744.0,if you are in the USA file a BBB complaint against them. A higher up will respond to  handle it.
paypal,fepnkx5,t3_eq6yff,1579325322.0,"File an IC3 report, contact the police and file a report against the buyer with both addresses

Contact USPS and tell them of the mail fraud then forward the reports to paypal who will most likely give you your money back due to them not being a banking agency and do not want the hassle.  

Jump on this QUICK"
paypal,fem5xdb,t1_fem4rtr,1579240897.0,"yes, do not give the buyer a hint there is an issue. Just deal with it on the back end. Paypal wont help you in this matter at all."
paypal,fd7oquu,t1_fd7lsg0,1578207737.0,"Or another way to get payment thats safer.

Once the buyer goes to their CC company, its out of paypals hands and they will force you to pay for it.

On top of that, the sold account may get shut down due to changing info and IP conflicts. 

Do either a bank transfer or another one way payment gateway. 

As a seller, I NEVER trust paypal with my funds. 

Im having a huge issue with them now trying to just send a payment."

When they argue Then I proceed to make them feel like absolute shit in a professional way: 

They may be better off in the streets where someone who will care for them and not treat them as an ornament to be put in the back yard and stare at once a week."
