facepalm,ffjjo29,t3_etxzdb,1579999747.0,"It's just a joke, try growing a sense of humor."
progun,ff6hskw,t1_ff6gxct,1579627490.0,You're mostly armchair warriors but if one or two of you snapped I wouldn't be surprised. Unless you're telling me that the people of this sub just sit around fantasizing about starring another civil war for nothing. Surely there must be a few go-getters around here.
progun,ff6fs2p,t1_ff6cp1o,1579626245.0,"Who says you can't be a deranged nutjob and an armchair commando? My assessment you your mental illness is entirely fact based. Telling yourself it's just an ""emotive label"" is delusional and just more evidence that I'm entirely correct."
progun,ff6aemw,t1_ff68u5g,1579622861.0,"Maybe my argument just seems weak to you because you've erroneously decided that I'm talking about gun rights.

Sorry chief, but if you're a regular one  this sub then you are as nuts as the rest of them."
progun,ff687xh,t1_ff5jz8l,1579621442.0,Because you're also armchair commandos. All that tough guy talk was nothing but hot air. You're an r/iamverybadass content mine.
progun,ff4mk9v,t1_ff4m3en,1579567245.0,I didn't predict anything about the rally.
progun,ff4kx4f,t1_ff4k6w7,1579566102.0,Nice temper tantrum. Please keep going.
progun,ff4k1v1,t1_ff4jf02,1579565498.0,I still think you're deranged nutjobs. Your behavior isn't doing you any favors.
progun,ff4j7a7,t1_ff4ijb9,1579564901.0,"I'm not wrong, you guys are deranged. You haven't said a single thing that makes me think otherwise."
progun,ff4i2pj,t1_ff4gqh5,1579564134.0,I didn't make any predictions though. I just said you guys were unhinged nutjobs. That assessment was based on the posts in this subreddit. I wasn't wrong about anything.
progun,ff4go53,t1_ff4fnil,1579563164.0,"No, if anything I'm feeling validated that my comment upset you enough that you came back 2 days later."
rva,ff3reyu,t3_ergw5e,1579547229.0,We need guns to protect ourselves from gun nuts. They're a hair's breadth away from succumbing to full-on paranoia and thinking that everyone's a deep state agent coming to get them.
progun,feuedje,t1_fete1b5,1579385721.0,"I could easily see one of you guys snapping and opening fire on a bunch of pedestrians because you think they're really deep state agents. 

You people are dangerous and unhinged. You're the bad guys that the ""good guy with a gun"" needs to be vigilant for."
worldpolitics,fesz2rp,t3_eqj3l7,1579370346.0,Not so much concerned as envious.
progun,fesph5e,t3_eqbx8r,1579367638.0,This is why we need guns. To protect ourselves from nutjobs like the people of this subreddit.
worldnews,felwx3f,t3_epuhad,1579232995.0,Many of his supporters worship him as if he were a divine prophet like Jesus. They want his family installed as dictators for life North Korea style. They're a cult.
facepalm,fekm06l,t1_fekl95m,1579202836.0,"No, not at all."
facepalm,fekkmob,t1_fekhpvh,1579202019.0,"No, in this case it actually would count. Even by the racism = power+prejudice definition.

The university is an institution, a ""power structure."" If they allow bigoted practices, they are institutionalizing those practices. With the support of a power structure said bigotry is now racism by every definition."
worldnews,fei3t1s,t3_ep9k57,1579129659.0,These people are creaming their pants over the idea of starting a second civil war. This is why gun ownership is so important. We need to protect ourselves from lunatic right wingers.
pics,fe8ux4c,t3_eo5p1u,1578931162.0,"Last time this was posted, the mods had to lock it."
worldnews,fdwl4x5,t3_en8w8s,1578759838.0,Q conspiracists are so nuts that they were too much for even r/the_donald to handle.
AmItheAsshole,fdkagk9,t3_eltfzp,1578499722.0,"NTA: not only are these cheaters unfairly jumping the queue, they're probably doing it to wrong you specifically. These people are out to get you, OP. If they've targeted you at the drivethrough, they're certainly attacking you in other ways that you haven't noticed yet. Stay frosty OP. Don't let them catch you unprepared!"
AmItheAsshole,fdk9a28,t3_elt6no,1578498978.0,YTA: Haemophobia in 2020? Wow...yikes sweaty. There's so much to unpack here and so little time. You either need to accept that your wife is full of blood or you need to remove your bigoted ass so that she can find a more hemophilic relationship.
AmItheAsshole,fdk7fog,t3_eln4i7,1578497799.0,"YTA: He will probably thinks that his proposal made you cry because of how ugly he is. His self confidence is crushed and he will likely need many years of therapy to be whole again.

He's damaged goods now. You should dump him."
worldpolitics,fdep8yp,t1_fdeowz0,1578343758.0,"Nope, I'm just calling it as I see it."
worldpolitics,fdeic7j,t1_fdehzsa,1578339647.0,"Chomping works too. ""Chomp"" is in fact, a variant of the term ""champ."""
worldnews,fde6lpe,t1_fde3266,1578332313.0,"Hate to tell you this, but a good portion of America is drooling over the prospect of getting into another war. Just visit any conservative sub on reddit to watch them in action. They can't fucking wait to get shipped out."
worldpolitics,fde4i2m,t3_ekw72h,1578330993.0,"Too late. Trumptards are now chomping at the bit for a war, any war. They'd probably go to war with themselves if dear leader told them to."
unpopularopinion,fddthjm,t3_ekusi1,1578323565.0,"You'll notice that people who spend all their time in those echo chambers never have their views challenged by a competent opposition. As a result, their own ability to argue their points degrades over time. They get arrogant, thinking that their opposition is weak because knocking over strawmen is easy. Then, you'll see them pop up in non echo chamber subs and get absolutely destroyed. It's pretty funny.

This can go beyond politics too."
IAmA,fd9rnbg,t1_fd9pix7,1578237108.0,"I did, it was an excellent troll, triggered the shit out of righttards. It was really fun to watch them sputter and cry about such an obviously fake story."
worldnews,fd9otnl,t1_fd9no6b,1578236184.0,"It's trash talk, you have absolutely no idea what you're asking for. Even against an inferior foe, war has a massive cost on the lives of everyone involved. Acting like it would be a trip to candyland is beyond moronic."
worldnews,fd9mlp9,t1_fd9llm0,1578235339.0,"That's exactly the sort of trash talk I saw before the Iraq war. I wonder if they still feel that way now that they live in a cardboard box behind Walmart trying to drown their PTSD with booze.

 I'm sure you're *totally* different though, right? That would never happen to a real American like you!"
worldnews,fd8z5ur,t3_ekbn9q,1578225706.0,"Watching all the trumptards salivate over the prospect of another war is surreal. It's like they really, truly want to throw their lives away for 10+ years only to return to a life of war induced mental illness and poverty.

I mean, we all saw this happen with Iraq and Afghanistan, right? Then we saw them vote to gut veteran aid programs. I'm starting to run low on sympathy here."
worldnews,fd756rb,t1_fd70y9c,1578199575.0,It baffles me that conservatives apparently haven't learned shit since the last war they started.
worldnews,fd5oi7z,t1_fd5o4lv,1578179692.0,"They do, but they get ignored."
worldnews,fd5minw,t1_fd5kxyd,1578179079.0,"There are plenty of ""rational left."" They don't get attention because rationality is boring."
worldnews,fd5i5nk,t3_ek3bmn,1578177918.0,"Trumpers are absolutely fucked if he decides to get us into another disasterous war. Unlike Bush's base, who were allowed to disagree with him from time to time, trump followers are all in on everything he says and does. They'll never be able to say ""oh, I voted trump but I never agreed with him on this one thing."""
worldnews,fcylx8e,t3_ejkdz0,1578082440.0,"Trumpists have backed themselves into a corner on this one. By being so unquestioningly faithful to their dear leader, they have no choice but to support another war or face excommunication from their cult."
MurderedByWords,fcvjm5u,t3_ej2kd8,1578003490.0,If the artist is so nice then why are her comics so mean?
worldnews,fcuv8m8,t3_ej11dn,1577989229.0,The right condones this behavior. Just look at the discussions on this issue in their subreddits. They're questioning if war crimes are really such a bad thing.
insanepeoplefacebook,fcke0uv,t1_fcjxbyj,1577723221.0,"Gamers label themselves. Just look at r/gamersriseup. There are a lot of subs that make fun of strawmen and stereotypes. R/gamersriseup is the only one I can think of where the strawman literally came to life and took over. That casts the gaming community in a pretty bad light.

The bigoted asshole gamer is no longer just a stereotype. It's a title that gamers have willingly claimed for themselves."
