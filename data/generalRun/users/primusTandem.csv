Fuck that. The only thing I want him to do now is leave, I don’t care how many non-horrendous things he accidentally does."

Well, she won the popular vote by 3 million votes, so so most certainly *could have* won the election. That she didn’t win the electoral college doesn’t change that. Also, I dislike her FWIW."

PoliticalHumor,ff46jhu,t1_ff41wps,1579556633.0,">	Being rich and having a rough day doesn't compare to being poor and having a rough day. A couple rough days being poor can make you end up homeless.

I don’t think that’s quite fair. It’s a bit of misery gatekeeping; no doubt there are millions of people (read: poor African countries, for example) whose rough days are much worse than yours. 

The point of the story above yours is to highlight that bad days are universal, and the only helpful thing is to help those who have less support and resources in their bad days. Rich isn’t having more money, rich is living below your means and defining for yourself what success is."
