bipolar,fdyc7cv,t3_encbw8,1578778230.0,"I have a friend like this, who's very public about the fact she feels like she's got everything under the sun, OCD, depression, anxiety,  the whole 'fashionable' lot. I don't like it, because I'm very careful to keep my fears for the future under wraps and it doesn't help when you're trying to figure yourself out to have this constantly in your ear reminding you that they're depressed and they have therapy and meds and nobody understands. It's all very odd to me."

If it's stopping you from proceeding, just leave a placeholder sentence explaining what you want there and continue. It'll come to you eventually. Best of luck!"

trashy,fcyn39e,t1_fcym6ea,1578083125.0,"Oh no shit towards you OP it's just that some people get well up in arms about this, and I want to be clear that pedophilia and all that is not okay within the community. There's no P in LGBT and god forbid anyone tries to add one.
That being said people do need to know about this poor child because there is some sketchy bullshit surrounding him.
Quick google confirms this kid is ""Desmond is amazing"" and if anyone's interested ScareTheater did a pretty good video on the whole thing a while back [here](https://youtu.be/uL8PA2J1-fA)"

We don't support this shit. We are not okay with it. The LGBT community has not ""crossed a line"", these fuckers have crossed a line."

LifeProTips,fcnau54,t1_fcnaarg,1577807627.0,Google it. You need a little plugin called microG as well if you're on a stock android phone. Sometimes the website is a bit shit but keep trying till you get one Vanced file and one MicroG file and install them both.
