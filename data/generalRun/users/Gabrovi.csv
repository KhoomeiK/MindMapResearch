AskGaybrosOver30,ffddghz,t3_esyi1w,1579818565.0,"There are two types of people in the world - those that get it and those that don’t. Your manager is obviously one of those who doesn’t get it. I think we cut a lot of slack (rightly or wrongly) for these types. I’m picturing a Michael Scott character from The Office. Honestly, the higher ups probably want to get rid of him and that’s why they’re so interested is what happened."
oakland,ffd9og1,t1_ffd9az5,1579816167.0,Yes. We call every time it goes down. They always give a credit. What’s crazy is that the rep can see exactly when it’s down. Why don’t they just automatically give credit?

teslamotors,feki7fa,t1_fekblp3,1579200571.0,"I have a feeling that you’re right, especially considering how close in price point they are. It sounds like the two will be built on the same line, so it should be easy for them to adjust to demand."
teslamotors,fek6jh0,t1_fejmx19,1579193650.0,"I agree that they don’t show any cause and effect. However, it does show a decrease in sedan sales practically everywhere- some by huge amounts. Tesla, on the other hand, has been able to do the opposite. This shows that Tesla has a market where we’ve been told that the market is dying. 

If SUV/CUV numbers go down among legacy carmakers after the release of the Model Y, then I think that we’ll have enough data to show that Tesla is stealing customers from that segment."
