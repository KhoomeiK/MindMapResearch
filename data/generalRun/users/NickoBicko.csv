My name is actually Mike.

Stoicism,ffvzhtu,t1_ffvxmfq,1580278277.0,"Well, Stoicism is interesting in that it has this dualistic element in it. The Spiritual and The Material. 

In the FAQ, under [""Do Stoics Believe In God""](https://www.reddit.com/r/Stoicism/wiki/faq#wiki_do_stoics_believe_in_god.2C_or_gods.3F), it goes a bit about the Stoic Thiesim. 

From my understanding, the Stoics were trying to make sense of the world. And especially connect the emergence of the Natural Sciences with Philosophy. That is try to find rational explanations for things. 

I believe part of that is just to fit into the culture, as science and technology were becoming greater forces.

If you read Seneca, or Epictetus, you get a sense that they are talking not just about the ordinary world. Or ordinary events. But there is this deeper meaning to things.

That Virtue, is just ""your decisions"". It's a real, external thing. Morality, is a real external thing. 

It's not this ""relativistic"" doctrine of, well... things mean anything, and you have to find your own meaning, and own morality, etc. Like the moral relativists of today.

They believed in fixed Virtues. They believed in God. They believed in providence. And super natural forces. 

So anyway, I was saying why I believe this is an essential part of Stoicism. 

If you believe that we live in a 100% material world AKA non-spiritual world.   
The world is essentially ""dead"". It's simply just rocks and elements. No intelligence or wisdom in it. Everything is this ""structured chaos"". 

Then, why morality? Why Virtue? Why ethics? Why be a good person?

Really? 

Well, because it feels good. Well, what if doing bad things feel good? 

You have this slippery slope. Logically it makes no sense to ascribe to a specific Ethical doctrine, especially one as strict as Stoicism with regards to Virtue. 

Materially, Epicurianism is more logical. Do what makes you happy. Because there is nothing else that matters. Other people literally don't matter. Only your own peace of mind. 

In a material world, that makes perfect sense.

If you take a drug, and have an incredible experience, your entire perception of ""the real world"" disappears. The world problems don't matter. 

So, logically, if you create a machine that can let you live feeling amazing all the time, detached from the world, that would be the most logical. 

But, if there is a spiritual element to the world. Something like Karma, that punishes us for bad acts, and rewards us for good ones. Then we are bound to be good all the time. It's not just when it's convenient. Not just when we can ""get away with it"". 

Finally, the belief in God has endured through all of known human history and pre-history. 

There's even a video of a runner that uses the oldest hunting technique, where they run down the animal to exhaustion and then kill it.

The video:  
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=826HMLoiE\_o](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=826HMLoiE_o)

And he would believe that spirits were ""guiding him"". 

I believe ""spirituality"" is an important upgrade to our psychology. It's a great source of faith, endurance and hope. 

How many Athiests are willing to be tortured for their ideology? It makes no sense. Just renounce it and move on, nothing is hurt. But Thiests couldn't do that. 

I highly recommend watching Joseph Campbell's interview (or reading his books)

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7xuLN8WIkI&list=PLmmc\_Sy1OV2JpAOi6RGd4sB4npoZnCtVn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7xuLN8WIkI&list=PLmmc_Sy1OV2JpAOi6RGd4sB4npoZnCtVn)

I've learned a lot from him about the universality of mythology and spiritual elements in human cultures. 

There are things in the human psych that can only be unlocked through a belief in supernatural things. Which I logically explain as a shortcoming of our logical defects (see Cognitive Distortions [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive\_distortion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_distortion), work of Daniel Kahneman [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thinking,\_Fast\_and\_Slow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thinking,_Fast_and_Slow), or Dan Arialy [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predictably\_Irrational](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predictably_Irrational), etc) 

So, this rejection of Spirituality. Of God. Of supernatural forces. I believe is foolish, even if you really are an Athiest. It is better to learn to incorporate those into parts of your psyche, to reap their benefits. Otherwise, you won't be able to tap into the complete human experience. 

I'd really love if there was a term for being like a Dualist. A person that both fully follows science and scientific findings AND embraces the practical spiritual elements (including the belief in a higher power)."

Your attempt to be ""extreme"" and eliminate your habit in one go, isn't courageous or strong, it's based around a fear. 

You're afraid that nothing less than a 100% will solve your problem. 

Maybe that's true. 

But, as someone who has helped thousands of individuals transform their lives, and have been obsessed with this, since I was much younger than you, and now I'm 12 years older.

I've found those ""extreme goals"" have an extremely high failure rate. 

And this from someone who was super extreme.

First time I tried to lose weight, I made a diet of 400 calories per day for myself (a 6'3, 220lb male...) 

AND

I would go to the gym for at least 1 hour a day. Sometimes up to 3 hours a day. Lifting and running. 

AND  


I would take every kind of fat burner and supplement I could find. I even went to using research chemicals and hormones, like T3 (thyroid hormone) and Clenbutrol -- a steroid given for horses that increases metabolism in humans. 

I would take that everyday, on top of caffeine pills, ephedrine, and aspirin.

I would take massive amounts of benadryl so I can fall asleep. 

My resting heart rate was 120. (normally around 70).  
I had constant tremors and shakes. I couldn't eat without my hands shaking like someone with parkinson. 

On my way to the gym, I'd drink a large coffee. One day I even mixed that with the most powerful energy drink and went to do cardio. My heart rate quickly reached over 200. 

I lost 30lbs in 6 weeks. But then I slowly gained it all back, and after 6 months I got fatter than I was. 

I'm sharing this with you to show you that I'm not a ""slow & steady"" person, or someone who is satisfied with small results. 

I was an extreme obsessive. I didn't care if I was going to die. I had a goal and wanted to achieve it. 

But, that' was my mentality at 18. Since then I've learned a lot of lessons. 

Let go of your fear and living in your head. 

Start doing real things that get you real benefits in the world. 

You have to work with yourself, you can't be at war with yourself. 

Plus, you are talking about FULFILLMENT.

You know how many people have sacrificed their lives for goals, yet at the end realized it was all a waste? Because they never listened to their intuition. They didn't learn how to be fulfilled in the moment. How create an incredible journey. 

Be humble.

See this statement:

> but that's because they are too attached to these forms of entertainment. 

See that absolute statement? That's not how you learn and improve. You grow by asking questions and intelligently considering view points. 

You can either learn from others, or by your own experience.

Your own experience is very costly, and takes years.  
From others, you can learn instantly."

Stoicism,ffueua3,t3_ev7lbc,1580240472.0,"I want to add that this topic is more complicated than its put to be. 

The problem with “seeking validation” is that it’s also intertwined with the wish of the individual to be a positive member of society. 

We have a natural instinct that we don’t do things to hurt others since they will get upset and will retaliate against us. 

The opposite is true. 

We want to be valuable. Contributors. 

How attractive is the idea of being a person that makes his friends laugh, or can entertain his friends with his music. 

So the desire to make a positive impact on others isn’t a vice specifically. 

It would be in the area of “somewhat in our control” and isn’t a virtue in itself. But it’s a preferred indifferent. 

I wouldn’t worry too much about it. 

Mostly protect against feeling insecure or the destructive validation seeking behavior. 

Also developing your own security and inner judgement where you aren’t relying on other peoples validation. 

You can play a song for a friend and hope they will like it. (Otherwise why push something to your friend that they wouldn’t like). 

But if you get hurt or upset because your friends don’t validate you or reject you, then that is a vice. It’s getting upset over something that isn’t in your control."

I've seen so many posts like yours, where the individual is essentially overcome with lack of motivation, feelings of worthlessness, as well as feeling like there isn't much out in the world for them except for anxiety and such. 

One big mistake that is made in giving a ""prescription"" for this case, is looking at ""normal"" individuals AKA those who do not have issues with depression / anxiety / agorophobia / internet addiction, etc. 

Then the advice is just to ""do what normal people"" do. 

Like, go outside. Make friends. Show up to work, etc. 

All good things. Although this is all presented as a ""the solution"".

Here, just do these simple things, and you will be okay. 

But that's like telling someone with a food addiction, hey look at how normal people eat, just eat like them! 

It doesn't work. 

There is an immense EFFORT that is required to overcoming those negative habitual patterns.

One important distinction is that these Eastern Spiritual teachings aren't singular. There are so many different traditions and schools. And even opposing views under the same umbrella.

I’m talking about new age thinking, the biggest one being The Secret. 

The Wikipedia does a good job detailing it:

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Age

My main issue with new age thinking is that it’s been the commercialization and perversion of spirituality. 

They’ve taken esoteric and spiritual practices, modified them to be attractive to Westerns who had been self-centered materialists. And made a lot of money in the process.

Edit: hit submit too early. 

The focus on the individual ego. And that is all you need goes against almost all spiritual teachings. 

Spiritual practices have been about the group and society. Not the personal ego. 

But these practices have literally made the individual into the center of the universe. 

All you need to have a good life is your own self-gratification (they call it something else though). 

Where is the talk about, Duty? Service? Social Harmony? Being responsible individuals of the world? 

It’s all about retreating to a room, closing up our eyes, and engaging in spiritual masturbation until your life is perfect. 

Viktor Frankl had it right when he said that all throughout history, human beings haven’t been obsessed with themselves. With their own neurosis or own existential being. 

They were concerned with the world.  
With a cause. A mission. Something they needed to do. Someone to love. Something to serve. 

The focus is external. Being good human beings. 

New Age thought tells you that do not worry. All of that doesn’t really matter. 

We call that in business, Unique Selling Proposition. That’s the advantage of what they are selling. 

You can be happy and successful by manifesting. Not by doing the hard work. 

How? By magic of course. 

Even Buddhist trainer their monks by being good people. 

They had discipline and regiment. 
Their training was more like a soldier than what the new agers do. 

In fact, they were beaten and disciplined. 
And their focus was on being good social humans. 

Their focus on service and being a good person. 

But being beaten and disciplined and made into a good non-selfish person doesn’t appeal to rich westerners. They want a shortcut. 

And that’s the tragedy that many are suffering from today like I had suffered.

The thing about Wayne Dyer, is he started off with a more ""hard work"" approach. 

His first book, which I believe was Your Erroneous Zones, which was published in 1976, was based on concrete psychological principles. In fact, if you read wikipedia, you see that he's accused of plagiarizing the work of Albert Ellis:

>Psychologist [Albert Ellis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Ellis) wrote that Dyer's book *Your Erroneous Zones* was probably ""the worst example"" of plagiarism of Ellis' [Rational Emotive Therapy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational_Emotive_Therapy) (RET).[\[16\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wayne_Dyer#cite_note-16) In a 1985 letter to Dyer, Ellis claimed that Dyer had participated in an Ellis workshop on RET before he published *Your Erroneous Zones*, in which Dyer appeared to understand RET very well. Ellis added that ""300 or more people have voluntarily told me... that \[the book\] was clearly derived from RET."" Dyer never apologized nor expressed any sense of wrongdoing but truthfully, Dyer had not committed any wrongdoing and had nothing to confess. Ellis admonished Dyer for unethically and unprofessionally failing to credit Ellis's work as the book's primary source, but he never took legal action and that is because in the final analysis, he actually felt overall gratitude for Dyer's work, writing: ""*Your Erroneous Zones* is a good book, ... it has helped a great number of people, and ... it outlines the main principles of RET quite well,... with great simplicity and clarity.""[\[17\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wayne_Dyer#cite_note-17) In the book *Your Erroneous Zones*, Dyer makes reference to Albert Ellis in chapter seven.

That's one reason why I was interested in his initial material. It seemed based in a rational place.

I haven't read all of his books, but the craziest stuff I've found is really in his most recent books. For example, Wishes Fulfilled & I See Clearly Now. 

He's a charismatic and a great storyteller. And he does a good job of mixing reason, history, spirituality, and stories with the metaphysical stuff, that it's really easy to start believing it."
Stoicism,feh8wo1,t1_feh6nla,1579111581.0,"The ""Law Of Attraction"" is a part of it. 

There is a whole continuum of teachings, and they are varied from different teachers. 

The main teaching though is that you essentially have supernatural, psychic powers. 

Best case scenario, this can help you have more optimism, self-belief, and positive confirmation bias in your life.

If you think...

""A girl will smile at me today""

And you go outside. You will start paying attention, and when you notice a girl smiling in your direction, you take that as confirmation of your magical super powers.

When in fact, it was just confirmation bias. You simply looked for the evidence, and found it.

Or maybe you had positive expectation, and smiled at a girl, and she smiled back. 

But eitherway, it wasn't magical. You didn't distort the laws of physics to somehow force a girl to smile at you. 

The same with the parking example. (which is perhaps the most cited one). 

Here is what I will say...

Some super natural beliefs can be useful IF you realize they are ""mental crutches"".

Human beings aren't 100% rational beings, far from it. And our thinking has a lot of distortions naturally. And it's impossible to become 100% rational, even with training. 

So, believing something like, ""I will protected on this journey"", might give you a sense of serenity and confidence, even if it's not true. 

But these things are like how a parent treats their child by telling them fairytales and such. Just because they lack the ability for more intelligent thought. You can do the same with yourself. When talking to your inner self.

But you must maintain ""the rational parent"", otherwise you fall into delusion.  


>  how can you stop worrying about failure , future , poverty when things arent going your way for example when your business was failing ? 

By accepting that this is a normal and inevitable part of life. 

And by shifting 100% of your focus toward Virtue. Your own reactions and actions.

Rather than focusing on the results you get, you focus on your responses and what you do.

You judge yourself by your actions, not results. 

Pain is a normal part of life. All beings experience it regularly. Just look at how much pain an animal experiences everyday. 

Yet they aren't distraught by it. Because their focus is simply on being a good animal. They don't have the future obsessions or future fears or the existential crisis, or the past guilt haunting them.

Through training, a person can start to re-train themselves to be more ""natural"".

At the same time, work to improve your life. Find ways to create a real positive impact. 

My goals used to be very grandiose, I wanted to change the world. To become infinitely rich. Etc.

Now, I focus on real improvement in my world. On attainable things. I work progressively towards greater aims. 

If you can't walk for 10 minutes, how can you run for 30 miles? You can't. 

Often times this is the source of our disappointment and failure. We expect so much, yet do so little. And then we wonder why our life sucks.

Expect less from the world.  
Expect more from yourself.   
Do good things.  
Help people.  
Let your good intentions, responses, and actions give you pride, peace, and joy.   
And any more fruits you get, is just more reasons to be happy, celebrate and share."

Personally, I am not AS liberal as many. I try to really understand the classical teachings, and evaluate and implement them best I can. And then fill in the gaps and use other frameworks/philosophies as needed.

If you feel limited by the philosophy, then by all means, work to resolve that limitation. I recommend to start by trying to understand it deeper. And if that fails, to find an alternative.

One thing to keep in mind about Stoicism, is that 90%+ of the Stoic have been lost. And even what we have today is 2nd hand or 3rd hand accounts and such.

Are new age ideas. 

A lot of them are destructive and go against the core philosophy of Stoicism. 

Stoicism very much is an active philosophy. 

It doesn’t reduce the world to an “illusion” and “reality can be whatever you want” and “you are God” and just “meditate and you will experience heaven on earth”. 

Stoicism is about being an effective citizen. An effective member of society and the world. 

It’s about taking an inventory of yourself and working on improving yourself, not simply isolating yourself from society and engaging in mental spiritual masturbation. 

I spent a few years personally testing these types of new age teachings, and it ended up being the worst years of my life.

Stoicism,fegrq36,t3_ep2qi8,1579100989.0,"That’s not what “out of my control” means. 

Check out the book the 7 habits of highly effective people. And specifically the chapter on the circle of control and circle of influence. 

The in your control/out of control is basically what you can 100% control. 

Like if you want to think of a tomato. You can 100% do that. 

But make $1 million. You don’t have the same level of control. 

Maybe you can have 90% chance of success if you do your best. But that’s not 100%. 

And there are things which you really have no control over. Like gravity or storms. Or war. Etc. 

It’s probably useful to think of % of control rather “in vs out” of my control. 

The “not in your control” is basically a way to get rid of fear, worry, anger, greed, excessive lust, and other negative emotions. 

We become obsessed with things we have little power in or expect more control than we currently have, and we suffer. 

It’s the same doctrine of the Buddha saying desire is the root of suffering. 

But desire and wanting things isn’t bad. 
It’s just can cause bad things. 

And when you are suffering because of desire, you can remind yourself of what you can vs can’t control to restore your sanity. 

I wrote in another post titled “why stoicism isn’t enough”, that Stoicism mainly deals with the ethical foundation and core of life philosophy. 

But it’s not enough for a rich life. 
It focuses a lot on the foundation/stability/defense side. 

It doesn’t go too much into the more striving/achieving/success part of life. 

This is where you need complimentary teachings and methods to help you have a rich life."
