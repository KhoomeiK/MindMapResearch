cars,fekfao5,t3_epa0mg,1579198836.0,"For me, it would be a feature where when you (or the rain sensor) activates the wipers, the headlights should be turned on automatically. The reason I say this is that in my state, and I'm sure several others, the law states clearly that if your wipers are on, your headlights have to be too. Now most may ignore this law, including law enforcement, but it's dangerous. Side view mirrors on most commercial trucks are garbage. When they get wet, the driver's visibility through them is severely hindered. Having your headlights on puts a giant beacon on the nose of your car that truck drivers can see and identify very easily. Along with other passenger car drivers whose visibility may also be impaired through their mirrors."
