I'm unsure with the new evidence or studies done, the implantation is from what I was told by my doctor and researched a few years ago. It looks like the FDA, NIH, and pill manufacturers and ACOG had been disagreeing about the effectiveness and function for a long time. However, your odds of pregnancy should still be pretty low. In the Princeton article, it mentioned that ella is more effective around ovulation, do you still have access to it within the window of time? Unfortunately most of the information I found is about women trying to get pregnant (having sex consistently without protection, tracking their cycle, ect).
