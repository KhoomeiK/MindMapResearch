Because always being convinced of the happening  of the worst possible case scenario doesn't seem like it would provide joy to anyone.

I can see how it may reduce one's sorrow on rare occasions. For example, a person's mother whom they were very close with dies. I believe nihilism might be an effective tool with emotional processing of this problem. I imagine the person would have a mindset along these lines : ""Yeah sure, she died. How does it matter exactly ? I'm going to die one day and forget everything about her, and my earthy life anyway. Just chill out."" Indeed, it can be helpful with reducing stress and sorrow.

Thank you for the answer.

I became somewhat interested in Scientology solely because of the fact it claimed it could cure homosexuality, among other things. I'm a gay teen and after reading some stuff about homosexuality which doesn't necessarily or at all adhere to the general opinion that it is innate, unchangeable and not a mental illness, I started being interested in it and, after finding some correlation between the alleged causes of it from conservatives' point of view ( mainly sites like Conservapedia and a few far right Redditors I'd stumble across from time to time ) and my personal case, I started pretty much hating myself and life in general more and more, and the more I learn about it the shittier I feel. I even tried ""curing"" it ""at home"" by forcing myself to masturbate to females exclusively, imagine being with a satisfactory romantic relationship with a female, turn around after passing by a conceptually attractive female and forcing myself to think of her as attractive...with little to no success in all of these attempts. I'm just desperate. The controversy of homosexuality is killing me, and the fact I take others' opinion VERY personally all the time, and not in an annoying angry liberal type of way, but in a ""person A says : gays are sick ; me : *proceeds to feel like shit for the rest of the day and more, and eventually cry*"", definitely doesn't help at all.

The thing is, I am not going to grow out of this, of which I'm 100% certain now. And I'm pretty sure I won't simply grow ""not to care"" either, because it gets worse every year. I want to get struck by a lightning honestly, and I also want all other gay people to die, because I want this controversy of homosexuality to stop. They're sickos ok, just burn them down so they're non-existent anymore and get it over with. I'm sick of 50 different people having 50 different views on one of my crucial characteristics.

scientology,fc1eq0i,t1_fc1aice,1577316546.0,"Well, the E-meter basically measures aggregate conductivity in the brain. For this, it requires physical contact between the subject and the cans connected to the E-meter by wires, right ? It is how it works. I still don't get why the auditor did self-auditing while talking to you on the phone and how it functions technically speaking. It makes absolutely no sense, no offense. I'm trying to figure it out but it doesn't seem to be plausible regardless of how I perceive it. How did the E-meter detect your change of focus when it wasn't even connected to you ? Maybe you just stuttered or remained silent which made the auditor think you preoccupied with something else, possibly something suddenly popping up on your phone, which is why he asked ""What's that ?"". I see no other logical explanation, even under the assumption the E-meter works 100%. It just isn't in use here. It doesn't measure anything about your anathomy or nervous system. 

You certainly did help about a lot of stuff, so consider your insight greatly appreciated, but there are still quite a few foregoing things that remain unclear about the E-meter, that I don't feel like anyone is going to be able to clarify for me.

And about homosexuality, it is thought that engrams accumulate in chains, and that each person has 15-20 such chains consisting of around 10-15 engrams. There is always a ""baseline"" engram which, if properly dealt with, will make it quite a bit easier to remove the other engrams branching from it. According to this doctrine, it is strongly believed among scientologists that there is a specific engram which is the cause of homosexuality and that homosexuality, despite the controversy, actually *can* be dealt with by auditing, like most other mental problems.

Now I have a MAJOR question which is so fucking important that I BEG you not to ignore it or pretend I haven't asked it : Is believing that homosexuality is caused by a specific incident during early childhood, like for example sexual abuse by a member of the same sex, in accordance with beliefs of scientologists ? In other words, can engrams be something like incidents of sexual abuse, or they gotta be something which occurred either during the unconscious state of our mind or during some of our past lives ?

The first one is following : how exactly does the therapy work through Skype ? How can the meter be used to measure anything if the subject isn't holding the terminals ? It doesn't work auditory. How *does* it work in this particular case then ? Why does the auditor take the grip of tin cans if he isn't even the one who should be read ? And why does he examine his own readings and presenting them as yours, with your consent...? It makes no sense honestly. I'd immensely appreciate it if you could clarify this for me. 

The other question is, based on your experience in The Curch of Scientology, do you think auditing can cure homosexuality ? It is what many prominent scientologists, including Hubbard, have been saying for a long time.
