TrueCrimeDiscussion,ffg7s77,t1_ffg6ens,1579900299.0,See that's where you fucked up. That's why I'm just planning a good ol' murder suicide. If I can't have her no one can. ^^I'm ^^only ^^joking.
unpopularopinion,ffg7gbu,t1_ffg3gmc,1579900094.0,"I have to ask, because I am genuinely curious: if you had an equal connection with two women, and one was more physically attractive to you than the other, would you choose the more attractive one if everything else was the same? I'm also curious (and you have no obligation to tell me shit) what ""gets you off"" when you do find that connection? Like I'm an ""ass man"". I'm not interested in anal sex, but the touching and feeling of it is important to me in a sexual encounter. But if physical attributes mean nothing to you, do you not have any fetishes? Preferences? Is it just penis in vagina totally ""vanilla"" sex? 

And as for what you mentioned about the woman with the traumatic experiences, I can totally relate to that too. My girlfriend had almost no sexual experience when she met me, and one of those very few experiences was someone trying to rape her. This led to her being a virgin, and not really caring about/wanting sex for a long time. Obviously that has changed since she is pregnant (I forget if I mentioned that). I went into the relationship knowing she was sexually inexperienced, I learned early on she was a virgin, and only about a month ago did she tell me about the will-be-dead-if-I-ever-see-him-coward that tried to rape her. I knew at the very beginning that sex may not be on the table. I'm not sure if this came through in my last post... But while sex is important to me, I don't NEED to know ""I'm going to be able to fuck this girl before I decide if I like her"" because I'm already physically attracted to her. I know I'll like the sex if it happens. But I do need to know it is a possibility, even if I need to wait a long time (which I did). 

How you feel about the brainless bombshell is how I feel about the ogre. Because at the end of the day, I can *always* find a friend I hit it off with. It is much harder for me to find someone I really want to have sex with who also wants to have sex with me and is compatible sexually. I would be so unhappy if I was stuck with a woman who repulsed me physically. Falling in love can only do so much to improve someones appearance in your eyes. 

Anyway, as for *when* we are getting married, we haven't set a date yet. She wants to get married ASAP, but I want to wait until we are in a better place financially. We also did everything so fast. We've only been together for... I'm terrible with dates. Less than a year. She got pregnant a few months after we started dating. We already loved each other and we both wanted a kid. She's also pro life, and I have only recently started to lessen my belief on that. I was adamantly pro life. Hardcore pro life I guess. But some people, on reddit, actually, opened my eyes to the flawed way I was seeing things. I hadn't considered rape victims, children who would be severely disabled, or women who ran the risk of dying in child birth. I also try not to judge women who get them for reasons other than what I mentioned because I don't know their situations. But... Actually let me stop there. That isn't what this is about. 

Anyway, I want to wait a while to get married. I'm secure in our relationship. I don't need to get married right away to validate my feelings. Soon though. No longer than a year."

unpopularopinion,ffg0uvj,t1_fffvz08,1579896027.0,"I hear what you're saying, but there are still parts that just don't make sense to *me* as a person. Because what you're describing just sounds like friendship to me. What makes something go from being a friendship into a relationship is a mutual sexual attraction. If you don't want to have sex with someone, how are they any different from any other friend? And if you *do* want to have sex with them, you must be finding their physical attributes attractive to your specific tastes. 

As for the woman who had a double mastectomy, yes, I would date her. But that, of course, is because it isn't incompatible with what I find attractive. But to flip it, if some woman somehow had no ass, thighs, legs, etc, no, I absolutely would not date her. Because I'm a (relatively) young and sexually active person. A sexual attraction is as important to me as an emotional attraction and an intellectual attraction. 

However, I am definitely a pretty superficial person. At least to a degree. I would date a disabled woman in a wheelchair as long as everything worked, and had feeling. But I would not date the ogre with the heart of gold. I've tried. I tried dating a girl I really hit it off with that I had no sexual attraction to, I really did. It didn't work for me. 

I guess I get what you're saying. I just find it very surprising that a person who (I assume? If you're asexual it would make much more sense to me) is interested in sex could date someone that they do not find the least bit sexually attractive. It's literally in our genes to be attracted to people physically, and to want to do sexual things with them. Obviously there are things like pheromones that influence the situation a little, but not enough to explain away all sexual attraction. 

I think you are in a very small minority of people who think this way. I know a lot of people *pretend* to think this way, because they think it makes them look good to women (LPT for people who do pretend to think this way: most women don't really give a shit one way or another if you say this, unless they themselves are absolutely hideous). 

I guess another explanation that would help *me* understand it (which you are not entitled to make me understand, I'm just kind of putting thoughts to words here to cover all bases) would be if you yourself were an extremely unattractive person, and therefore your options were extremely limited. But based on how you talk you *seem* well adjusted, and people like that tend to be very bitter and angry. 

I guess there really are all different types in the world. I just never thought I would meet a person who enjoys sex but doesn't care about sexual attraction. 

As for the brainless bombshell, at least just for me, I would be much happier dating that than the ogre with the heart of gold. If my future wife (my now fiancee, this isn't a hypothetical) were to die before me, and I was over the age of 60, I *might* just look for companionship. Definitely if my dick stopped working.

Idk man, I know I kind of rambled a bit. I've just never imagined anyone on earth with an at least somewhat average sex drive and isn't a hideous ogre themselves would ever think like that."

And I'm not saying that sexual attraction is the most important trait, or that it has to be the trait you seek out the most. I'm just saying it *has to exist* in a relationship. It's great that you're not a totally superficial person, but if you're at all a human, you are superficial to some degree. It's part of our DNA to lust after the opposite sex (or whichever sex you lust after, there are so many these days).

u_throwaway-exrac,ffd12a1,t1_f699ok7,1579811319.0,"Yeah, a guy who beats someone to death on a whim probably has other murders attached to him. I wouldn't want people telling the internet either."
u_throwaway-exrac,ffd0k0t,t1_fbbpmx5,1579811040.0,It's amazing what people on the internet will believe.
u_throwaway-exrac,ffd0exw,t1_f71e1q8,1579810963.0,"I'm confused. What would it matter if you told us if no one knows his name, what month/day/year this happened, we don't know what country it happened in, etc. What could we possibly do with that information?

Oh, and did the YouTuber interview him? 

What about the person who reached out to you? Did they do that in a private message? Because I couldn't find any comments that said anything about knowing the guy. 

If he's so private, why would he share this story with some guy he met on Steam?   

What is the username of the guy who reached out to you? Does he want privacy too?"
u_throwaway-exrac,ffczgqt,t1_f5zzkue,1579810434.0,"I mean, the guy brutally assaulted someone with almost no prompt whatsoever. He was also on the run from the police. Just because he is against kidnapping and inevitable rape (and probable murder) that doesn't mean he's some warm and cuddly guy. At the absolute best he's a violent person. Probably pretty dangerous too."
tipofmytongue,ffcywr6,t1_ffcwobm,1579810127.0,Yes. Solved!
tipofmytongue,ffcyw59,t1_ffcw6uz,1579810117.0,Yes. Solved!
MovieSuggestions,ffcyudf,t1_ffcvvh8,1579810090.0,"How would I *possibly* find the quote you were referencing specifically? When you say ""my firm"" it's obvious you mean your special needs classroom. 

Are you also too stupid (you are) to realize it would be literally impossible for me to find a quote that you were talking about when you provided no information? Especially in a movie that had at least 4 antagonists. You really are a special breed of idiot."
u_throwaway-exrac,ffcy6l4,t3_dogu5d,1579809706.0,"What was cigarette guy on the run for? I'm glad he saved you, but how quickly he reacted with violence, and the fact that he was on the run from the law, make it seem like he might not be such a great person himself (obviously he's better than a kidnapper and would be rapist, and probable murderer).

The person who contacted you and said he knew cigarette guy, did he not post in your thread? Did he request anonymity?"
