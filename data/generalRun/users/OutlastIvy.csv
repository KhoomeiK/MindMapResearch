FAMnNFP,ff92ros,t1_fekh9hm,1579703426.0,"I had the same issue too at some point! I think the band starts to stretch a little bit after a while so you have to occasionally tighten it as well.

One night it had been so loose that I had taken it off and placed it on top of my phone while I was asleep, haha! I was so confused when I woke up. ""Why... why is my Tempdrop on the nightstand..."" It still miraculously had managed to measure my temp though!"
MakeupAddiction,ff8uyzh,t3_es7d8x,1579696986.0,"Amazing look! I love everything about it. 

I see you got those lashes from Aliexpress. Are they a dupe or something else or do you know any other lashes that look similar? Those lashes really compliment your eye shape (as well as mine) and I'm always on the lookout for lashes that are not too thick and are longer on the outer corner."
sfx,ff2fodc,t3_er3hop,1579504152.0,"You just keep torturing us with your vile creations. 

...keep up the good work."
notliketheothergirls,ff0ixtw,t1_feznlm8,1579469302.0,It's treason then.
americaneskimo,feoazj9,t3_epvg9k,1579297591.0,"My Japanese Spitz has her ears back when she's relaxing and getting pets. 

It's the best party trick to go ""where are your ears?!"" with a high-pitched voice and watch the ears perk up!"
GothStyle,feo9oxv,t3_eq2yb9,1579297062.0,Love your outfit!
aww,fe6rwtg,t1_fe5zn7h,1578902513.0,Huh. I always thought it meant stress or being overly excited!
FAMnNFP,fdxs8fr,t3_en72ob,1578772406.0,"You should contact them through the Tempdrop app. There is an option that you can send an email with your device's report so they can easily debug and see if your device is having an issue.

When I first got my Tempdrop I didn't get any readings in the morning. I contacted them through the app and send them my report. They asked to see a picture of me wearing the device in case I was wearing it wrong. After that they looked into my report and noticed that my device was faulty. Then they sent me a new one!

Customer service was very helpful, don't hesitate to reach out. Good luck!"
sfx,fdq2m3e,t3_emhvl8,1578651808.0,"Ah, hate when that happens.

Very nice!"
samoyeds,fdo6lhq,t1_fdnsfnt,1578599787.0,You can swap an Eskimo with the Japanese Spitz when needed! They look so similar I usually can't tell the difference.
aww,fdml54v,t1_fdmd2z6,1578554032.0,"I once had a wasp land on my ham sandwich. It bit on a little piece of ham sticking out and started cutting. It took him a while but eventually, he cut an entire piece off and flew away with it. I just sat there staring."
OculusQuest,fdmjhck,t3_em1vdq,1578552161.0,"Oh cool, love this! 

Would it be a good idea if it was possible to position the piano on a table or some other surface so you wouldn't have to play in the air? Then you could just tap the table and have some sort of extra feedback."
sfx,fdc1pi0,t3_ekgr90,1578265379.0,Well. That's vile!
aww,fdbwwqq,t1_fdbiovd,1578263165.0,She obviously rides it home.
beatsaber,fctp24v,t1_fcto8vg,1577952299.0,"I've only been playing for such a short time that I don't have any feelings towards the sabers but this idea is really cool! 

Earning sabers like trophies. And then you can just equip them. Yes."
OculusQuest,fcfrfwh,t1_fce2uq2,1577633024.0,This is my guess too.
OculusQuest,fayxkzn,t3_eacnef,1576408543.0,Hey! Did you record this by using the Quests built-in recording system? I tried to record some 360 maps but when I transferred them to my computer they seem to be unplayable for some reason. I'm wondering if there's something wrong with my Quest or with Beat Saber.
