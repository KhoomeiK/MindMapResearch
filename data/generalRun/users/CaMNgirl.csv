This girl (former college roommate of mine) is a larger person & is extremely body positive (great, cool) but she posts a lot about how being fat doesn’t equal self worth and everyone and everything should be body-inclusive.

When this re-org occurred in October, I had asked if we were going to be compensated (half jokingly) for the surprise moves and management at the time said “it’s something we’re talking about”. No confidence in the “talks” there."

AskReddit,fen7h4r,t3_eptxb3,1579278649.0,"I was really close to my grandpa (my mom’s dad, former Navy man, father of 4). I thought he was a strong, resilient, hard-working & honest man. I grew up with him as my hero and the ultimate family man & husband. 

He passed away about 10 years ago and I couldn’t go fo his funeral due to being in college over 2,000 miles away and I was really hurt & had a hard time processing his death for about 2 years. 

I found out just last year from my mom that my grandpa had cheated on my grandpa more than once with a woman or two at his place of work.

That literally shattered my entire view of him and who he was in my eyes. My grandma worked hard to earn her degree in America (both of them immigrated from SE Asia), raised 4 kids & worked hard all her life to keep her kids & husband happy, fed & healthy. And here my grandpa was fooling around with other women. 

No one else really knows about my grandpa’s infidelity except for my mom, my sister & I and my grandma doesn’t know that I know. 

I give my grandma an extra big hug whenever I visit home."

I keep my electrolytes in check with Gatorade Zero & electrolyte supplements I bought from amazon. In a pinch I have salt tablets from my running days.
