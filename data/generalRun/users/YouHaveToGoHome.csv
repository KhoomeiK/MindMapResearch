It makes sense; given more examples of short people doing normal things, people might be less likely to shoehorn you into either the ""feeble"" stereotype or a Danny Devito knockoff (overly macho/confident to ""make up"" for being short, as if being short were a deficiency) I also never made the connection between all those articles talking about tall CEOs of Fortune 500s and how height discrimination can seep into a professional setting rather than just being confined to dating.

>**the reality is that height discrimination is much more likely to be a problem in male dominated circles, and is much more aggressively propogated by other men than it is by women.**

Perhaps the only part I would disagree with. I've almost never seen height requirements with other men on dating apps while it's been rather common with women. I'd say different genders push the height issue different based on context, but that's just my experience.

SeriousConversation,ff23ow0,t3_er5foq,1579492945.0,"As a guy that's also the child of a deadbeat dad, I would oppose this measure. The priority to satisfy should be:

1. The mother's bodily autonomy. If she doesn't want to undergo medical risk to have a pregnancy, then she's entitled to an abortion. Conversely, if for whatever reason, she wants to keep the baby, then she's entitled to do so.
2. The child's best interest. Even though you are the parent, there are some decisions you don't get to make for your child, and we enforce these through the courts. You can't refuse medical treatment or force them to drop out of school. Signing away your child's claim as a dependent or beneficiary for their biological father should be another one absent any extreme motivating factors (ex: father is incredibly abusive/mentally unstable/violent).
3. The mother and father's wishes for the child.

imo it's your decision whether or not to keep the baby. But it's not your decision to give up something the baby has a claim on. Perhaps this would be different in a society where social services raises the child from cradle to school and lack of family resources is not such a driver of inequality so the decision is irrelevant to the child's ""best interest"". But we clearly don't live in that world. The guy isn't stuck with the woman's choice; you're both stuck with the child's best interest if you choose to bring it into the world.

Moreover, while I fully support gender equality, it doesn't really apply to this case. There is no equivalent to the decision to abort a pregnancy for a man because pregnancy itself is a complete process that involves more than finances.  This ""signing away parental rights"" is kinda like saying we're treating everyone equally by asking a 6'3"" guy and a 5' guy to dunk a basketball on the same hoop.

Also, Adam backed up his statements with citations to data-driven research on the healthcare industry; Dr. Mike is a plastic surgeon making assertions about the economics of healthcare. Finally, I think Dr. Mike is missing a key concept of Adam's video: the economics of healthcare imply that it is a poor industry for a market system. While he acknowledges that lack of transparency and the necessary rather than optional nature of healthcare products makes for poor consumer decision-making, he states that ""hospitals have to turn a profit"". Do elementary schools need to turn a profit? Does the post office need to turn a profit?

Dealing with HIV is already a huge challenge; we really shouldn't make it harder on people by setting up barriers and ostracizing them. I'm also 24, and I grew up with an alcoholic dad who used to beat us and then ran away with his mistress. I don't remember the beatings much, but I do vividly remember other adults avoiding me as if being near me would poison their children and homes with the same abuse and divorce. Humans evolved as social creatures; the way other people treat us really does matter because we really can't go it alone.

First, I would say organize and decide your priorities; your writing kinda gives me the impression that this is all been spinning in your head and you're feeling overwhelmed. Divide and conquer: write down the main problems so you can think about them one at a time rather than try to solve them all at once. Also, you need to prioritize. What would you like to change and how important is it to you? From your comments it seems like you might have some conflicting goals: you want to move somewhere with people who are more tolerant of HIV-positive individuals (generally a suburb or a city), but you want to stay because you like rural areas and your dad is likely going to leave you the 400-acre property. What's most important to you *at this point in your life*? Are your actions here necessarily permanent (like moving away)?

Second, one trick I've found that helped me when I was depressed, scared, or confused was imagining how the future me, who has conquered these issues, would act. How would the future u/simplydontknow, who has found friends, a satisfying career, and recognition for his abilities decide what to do in this situation? How would he react to the regularly scheduled tests to the FAA? (Probably wouldn't stress too much; they're a regular part of his life) How would he react to being asked not to serve food to his family? (Probably would calmly explain how you can't transmit HIV that way and maybe make a joke). Then start behaving like him until you are him.

Finally, ""go where you're celebrated, not just tolerated"". You're resilient, resourceful, smart, and passionate about flying (I can tell you a lot of people wouldn't even have thought of a house burning down as an opportunity to further invest in themselves). But you're surrounded by people who rather than recognizing these traits, barely tolerate your existence and seem to brand you solely by your HIV-status.  It doesn't sound like there's great opportunities to put your abilities to use where you are. And finally, you have no idea what you're missing out on. Other people are being kinda crude by saying ""cut the umbilical cord"" because you're still living with a parent. I think you have the opposite problem though. You need to find a better community that will not only offer you tolerance but *support.* HIV isn't something that you have to hide in shame; in fact, people can form communities around the common struggles they have to endure. They're going to have doctors who are much more familiar with HIV patients and who understand the importance of getting in that FAA test result promptly. And being around not only other young people, but people of all ages from different walks of life will give you an idea of what's really possible in life, even with setbacks. Being told not to follow your dreams can be lonely, but it's less lonely when there are 5 or 10 of you all trying to make it work anyway.

If you want to get deep, the right to abortion isn't about unwanted babies; it's about no longer wanting to be pregnant. It's about having the power to make decisions about your own body regarding severe medical risks such as pre-eclampsia, internal bleeding, herniated discs, postpartum depression, and tearing from your vagina to your anus during childbirth. If you got into a car accident and the only way your child could survive is with your blood transfusion or a liver transplant, the doctors could not harvest you for organs nor could you be put into prison because the right to your body supersedes all else.

Decided to start watching Season 5 Untucked while cleaning this weekend and I was really surprised at the backstories of some of the queens, even ones I thought I was familiar with. Yes, everyone has their own struggles, but there are some that just present huge obstacles to having the time and money to be polished and TV-ready. You would never find someone like Monica Beverly Hillz on a current season, but what a huge add to her season she was. At the same time, having drag come into the spotlight has allowed best practices to spread better, especially in terms of makeup.

It also seems like now queens are just hungry to be whatever the producers want in order to get press and make it to the final. Older seasons the queens seem to be more strongly rooted in their personas and brand. I always think back to the horrible comments Katya got before her commercial in AS2, yet she stuck to it and killed it."
todayilearned,fcsvf1s,t1_fcstlfb,1577926099.0,"First is compartmentalization. Unless you are a philosopher, I think most of us have a ""worldview"" that's just a bunch of independent models of the world stitched together. So perhaps your belief that ""everything needs equations and formulas"" will apply to modelling how bridges deform but ""God did it"" helps you realize your place in relation to a chaotic world/universe. I think the more strongly motivated a particular piece of the quilt is, the more strongly you hold onto it even if it conflicts with other pieces which function well (make predictions based on past observations that produce results which match with reality). One of my closest friends is an oncologist with a doctorate yet still believes in intelligent design because he ""just can't believe randomness could produce all the order we see""; I would not say he's an extreme outlier among his cohort, just that his training in physics on the road to becoming a doctor didn't need to do a deep dive into entropy.

Second is the distinction between mathematical and scientific logic. Math is deriving logical conclusions from a set of assumptions (inductive logic); science is testing theories which make some observable prediction about reality and generalizing (deductive logic). This means math doesn't necessarily have anything to do with reality; you can conjure up entire systems unrelated to anything we've observed based on your fundamental assumptions for the system and they'll be ""true"" (consistent with the rules of the system) but not ""real""."
SeriousConversation,fcpwjas,t3_eiemdi,1577873679.0,"24 as well, but have been living on my own a few years. Really impressed by your side income; there's nothing quite like panicking that your entire income stream will dry up bc your boss gets upset. Some general things I picked up:

1) It's generally easier to grow income than cut expenses when trying to get financially stable. Sure, you can cut out coupons, buy a year's worth of canned goods at a time, and walk home instead of taking the bus, but usually your quality of life improves much more significantly when you gun for either a promotion or, as a millennial, by jumping jobs once you accrue even 1-2 years' experience. It's not really meaningful to fret about a $7 avocado toast when housing, healthcare, and car payments are orders of magnitude larger. Similarly, if you only spend like $200 a month on food, cutting back to the cheapest grocery store brands will save you at most $2.4k/year if everything was free. A good job jump will usually increase your salary far more than that.

2) You will inevitably burn money while learning. There are just way too many gotchas that come with living on your own, from knowing how to not scratch your new pans to having regrets about that questionably cheap and itchy futon you got from a yard sale. You'll get better at avoiding the mistakes eventually but try to see it as the cost of learning rather than beating yourself up over ""wasted money"". No use crying over spilled milk.

3) Durability and quality count. Furnishing your place for the first time is exhausting because it's just a spending spree for many items you will buy once but use for many years. But don't just buy the cheapest items from Amazon, Ikea, and the thrift store; in some cases you'll end up spending more replacing them over the years. Having roommates helps defray the costs so someone can cover the dining table and another person the couch and so on.

4) Learn to cook. Cooking saves so much money and time; by the time you've decided what you wanted and either traveled to the take-out place or had it delivered, you could have prepped a meal. Plus abs are made in the kitchen. Eating healthy goes much further than working out at an expensive gym or with a personal trainer (obviously having all of the above would be the best).

5) Don't look for places and furnish them like it's the last place you're ever gonna live. Buying too many appliances/too much furniture SUCKS when it comes time for a move. Almost always, the furniture/appliances are optional; the move is not. Also decide how much time  you're actually going to spend in your apartment. No use in blowing the piggybank on making it super nice if you never have people over and are out most of the time."

gaysian,fclx957,t1_fclpx7c,1577758701.0,">Yang is going to model the VAT after those of countries that have reduced VAT rates for staple goods & increased rates for more luxury items.

The switch from wealth to VAT taxes was followed by a ballooning of the wealth gap between the top 1% and the rest in Sweden and Denmark. So again, 99.9% of us will share wealth more equally.

>Warren's wealth tax is not revolutionary at all. There's a reason why developed countries scrapped their wealth taxes and why 160+ countries have a VAT system instead, USA being one of the only ones that currently don't. You can evade much of the wealth tax.

Wealth individuals evaded the wealth tax by moving to... the US. We have some of the most stringent banking and anti-laundering laws but some of the most lax tax loopholes on personal income and assets, so we basically suck in money and it just sits there. One of the most powerful weapons of the US during the Cold War was this mechanism: something on the order of billions of corrupt money flowed out of the Soviet Union and into American banks, thereby crippling its economy. We're doing this to other developed countries as well. This needs to end; otherwise companies will just come up with more ways to get around paying the VAT. It's as easy as demanding ""tax credits for creating jobs"" or some other pork project.

>Greg Mankiw, a Harvard professor who authors widely used economic textbooks endorses Yang's plans and has a NYT piece on why it is better than Warren's wealth tax.

Having been a student in his class and taken a few other courses in the Harvard econ department, I had a good chuckle at anyone trying to use Mankiw as a serious reference. He's pretty much a pariah among the department because in addition to being an economic advisor for the disastrous Bush administration, he keeps on spouting bullshit like [we can't trust Keynesian economics because he didn't have children and isn't thinking about posterity](https://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/30/business/economy/30view.html?_r=0) and [why Hamilton tickets need to be expensive so rich people like him can see it on demand.](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/23/upshot/i-paid-2500-for-a-hamilton-ticket-im-happy-about-it.html) That his introductory textbook is widely used means bupkis; Ec10a and 10b are literally the joke courses of the department. There are far better arguments and people arguing against a wealth tax, but I fail to see why the 500 richest families should be allowed to subvert our democratic values around equal treatment under the law. As a trader, the question I'm asking when thinking about wealth taxes is ""do people with more wealth have a returns premium for equal risk simply because they have more capital?"" If the answer to the question is ""yes"", which our social mobility indicators strongly support, you have a system set up for runaway effects. VAT does not address this issue because again, it's a consumption tax and the wealthiest tend to consume less relative to their wealth.

>It's not going to bankrupt the country. That's a Republican propaganda talking point lol. We already have the money in our economy. It will just be redistributed and money will circulate faster because the money will be spent. It will go right back into main street businesses and so forth.

The ""so forth"" is the issue. Because when people have more money, they're going to spend it on their big ticket items, which are largely provided by people who already have a lot of capital: housing, childcare, healthcare, and education. I agree Yang is very pro-small business, but the money isn't going to circulate effectively if he doesn't couple it with adequate anti-trust enforcement and worker protections to ensure a competitive market; for him to get my vote, he also needs to be pro-consumer if not also pro-worker.

>New businesses will open and small businesses will actually be more able to compete with bigger businesses.

This hasn't played out in the new tech economy at all; Facebook, Google, Apple, etc. have just gobbled up any upcoming competition just due to the sheer size of their cash reserves. The oligarchic situation persists.

>The real drain in our economy are the billionaires who hold their money in offshore accounts to avoid paying their fair share in taxes.

No silver bullets man; these are pretty complex issues and things like child hunger, education inequity, living in rural/aging areas, and cultural norms about taking service jobs over physical labor also contribute to the problem."
