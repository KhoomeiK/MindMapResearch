todayilearned,felhbrc,t1_felfab5,1579222173.0,"In response to your edit. It’s not the responsibility of the hospital to determine who can be a donor. In the US, organ procurement organizations identify and evaluate patients, and are the “middle man” between the donor and the transplant surgeons."

todayilearned,felf62n,t1_felen6l,1579220729.0,"There is a specialized team to facilitate and coordinate organ donation. Organ Procurement Organizations employ specialized staff who identify and evaluate potential donors, as well as speak with families about the opportunity to donate. They also gather all the needed information and communicate that to Transplant centers so they can evaluate for their patients."
todayilearned,felemtv,t1_fel0alt,1579220374.0,"One would think an “opt out” system would increase donation rates. However, recent studies have shown this is actually not the case.

“ Regions that have an “Opt-OUT” program—where the government assumes under law that individuals are donors unless they formally register their decision not to participate—actually have donation rates that are 27 percent lower than the “Opt-IN” regions, including the United States”[Source ](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20190808005797/en/U.S.-States-Lead-World-Organ-Donation) 


Spain is the only country with an opt out system that ranks as high as the best performing opt in US states."
