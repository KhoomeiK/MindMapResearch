depression,ffj0us6,t1_ffj0iqj,1579987557.0,I really have no idea how it dissapeared that quick either. I was in a deep depression and din’t keep track. Plus 1k was due to car expenses.
depression,ffivt83,t1_ffiv3of,1579983911.0,"It took me a year. The last 5 grand was blown in a month i was out of work and my car broke down and too depressed to get outa bed. I drank and ate takeout. 

I have zero debt. Well 600 dollars of credit card thats it.  Only a cellphone bill and car insurance plus groceries and gas. 

I used to stash away 250 a week. Aiming for 350-400 a week but that will be tight. 

I got income tax coming in that should be atleast 1k back. 

I make about 40k-47k a year dependint on overtime. 

My worry is the upcoming college debt. I’m gonna need 30k or so to finish 2 years. Gonna need a loan. Then of course ill want a house and a car. Im freaking the hell out."
BreakUps,ff8zfzh,t3_es6pq2,1579700887.0,I dated a girl with BPD. She loved me like crazy did everything for me until I ended treating her poorly. Long story short she became upset and started to resent me. She is the opposite of what she used to be. At one point she started hitting me. She met someone else and has basically told me to fuck off. I still remember the days when she was nice and sweet fondly. I miss those days.
BreakUps,fdgrkz1,t1_fdgr6p9,1578406501.0,I felt the same way the other night. Then it occurred to me that chemistry does not happen overnight.
