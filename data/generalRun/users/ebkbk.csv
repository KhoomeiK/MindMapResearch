TeslaLounge,fh9aqc1,t1_fh9acp2,1581376925.0,"Did any standard range model 3s actually come out or was it downgraded by Tesla? I thought it was only standard range+. 33000 is only 6k under the MSRP for a new 2020 SR+ (2k under MSRP of SR) with warranty. Keep in mind the warranty is gone now. 

Personally I would pay the extra. If it was another $4k cheaper I would go for it. Also demand outweighs supply ATM."
