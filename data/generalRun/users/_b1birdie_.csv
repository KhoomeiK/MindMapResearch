BipolarReddit,ffdkcyz,t3_et18hb,1579822719.0,I was feeling like that too. I’m hoping for a friend for you.

BipolarReddit,ffazbr0,t1_ffa23gk,1579747983.0,Discrimination against disabled employees is against the law. There’s a couple that would protect a person with Bipolar who has experienced workplace discrimination.
BipolarReddit,ffag7sw,t1_ffafrik,1579735014.0,I’ve taken trazadone before and I guess I was on a low dose and I wasn’t sleeping fully either. Thank you though. I’m not on a mood stabilizer either that’s why I was a little skeptical
