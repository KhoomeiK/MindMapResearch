AskReddit,ffp8tab,t1_ffp7fkb,1580089055.0,"Surprisingly, yes! Just turned 7 and still the best pupper ever despite scaring the shit out of me way too many times. The last one was last summer when he jumped up on the counter and ate an entire bottle of rimadyl (dog pain medicine) while we were sleeping. I found the chewed up bottle when I woke up and learned from a quick Google search that shit kills dogs pretty easily in higher doses. The emergency vet said it was a toxic dose so I rushed him in, hysterically crying thinking he was about to die. Didn't seem to phase him at all."
AskReddit,ffp7exr,t3_eub23g,1580088105.0,"I bought a $400 BCBG MAXAZRIA Faux Fur Teddy Bear coat but returned it because I felt guilty spending that much on a coat that I probably wouldn't wear often. Felt too fancy to wear to work and I don't really go many other places. It was ridiculously soft and cozy though. I hated returning it.

Edit: this post inspired me to look for the coat on poshmark and I found it brand new with tags in my size for $89. Offered $50 and they accepted! Yay, thank you for making this post."
AskReddit,ffp5t44,t1_ffjibfx,1580086971.0,My fucking idiot dog has eaten so many things I thought were going to be the death of him. Once while camping I woke up to find him eating ROCKS that my son had brought into our tent. He then proceeded to throw them up and then tried to eat them again!
NatureIsFuckingLit,ffozmpz,t1_ffow7yv,1580083666.0,For reals the great salt lake is smelly and gross. You go walk on the shore and the ground moves with each step due to all the flies. It's nasty! Can get some cool sunset pictures out there though.

Anxiety,ffoisww,t1_ffoddts,1580078080.0,"I understand that it helps her feel better and it's working for her in that regard but this isn't something I just pulled out of thin air. There are lots of articles and research out there that say reassurance seeking is just another form of compulsion that is not helpful for recovery from OCD. I seek reassurance often, so I'm not knocking it but I am aware that it's not helping my disease. OCD is hell, so whatever people do to get by, I don't blame or shame them for it. Here's some articles that explain it.

AskReddit,ffnggue,t1_ffjzj21,1580065624.0,You joke but this is a huge reason I don't want to get married. I don't want to get divorced and the best way to avoid it is by not getting married in the first place. My boyfriend and I just celebrated 11 years this week.
