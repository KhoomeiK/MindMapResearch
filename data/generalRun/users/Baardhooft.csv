apexlegends,fft81za,t1_fft7u6p,1580211656.0,"Yes exactly. He’s really taken off on this sub after his lore + leak posts. He mostly memes now but that’s not how people got to know him initially. This very thread is another karma farm from him. I love his lore related posts but threads like these are a bit meh, especially when he then goes on to say he doesn’t want to start any drama."
apexlegends,fft75hm,t1_ffsr8gs,1580210524.0,"There are only two ways the image could’ve been leaked, either through them releasing it early on YouTube or someone inside Respawn leaking it. If it’s the former then yeah, it’s on Respawn or EA and it has happened before with the season 2 and season 3 trailers. If it’s the latter it’s seriously scummy stuff. 

And as much as you like to go for the moral high ground now it’s not like you didn’t participate in the same things he is/was.

I doubt many people actually care about the smaller leaks like skin re-colors or weapon/ability speculation, especially because we’ve mostly been wrong on the abilities. It’s just hype building and for me one of the few things that keeps the game interesting during the radio silence from Respawn. I’m not so happy with trailer leaks myself either but so far those leaks have all been on the company and not because someone stole it."
apexlegends,ffso920,t1_ffsbzz7,1580186912.0,"My dude, just some well meant advice, but if you’re having such a hard time climbing out of platinum don’t even try to get diamond. I’m a diamond player and can reach diamond within 1-2 days on a new account and I’m telling you that’s kinda where the fun ends. Honestly I’d rather stay in plat than having the diamond grind with randoms, it’s just not worth it."
apexlegends,ffso0b6,t1_ffsf7zd,1580186709.0,"I don’t think the dummie mode has SBMM. I’ve had many instances of my squad insta quitting after hitting the ground and I still managed to solo wipe a few squads. Looking them up their ranks range anywhere from bronze/silver to predator, but not really in any specific way. I was matched with #230 Predator and had another teammate who was a gold player. We fought some full silver teams and whatnot."
apexlegends,ffsnkv7,t1_ffsibnr,1580186342.0,"None of my friends even want to play anymore. I had at least 4 other friends who are diamond/pred with 3k/4K and many 20 kill badges, people who’ve spent €300+ on the game and all have stopped playing. I play solo queue from time to time but honestly after a few matches I just close the game because it’s impossible to have fun solo with SBMM. The only time I can have fun and goof off is with my smurf accounts at gold or platinum levels. Having to make and remember all my smurfs though isn’t much fun and not having my skins and other items on those accounts also sucks."
apexlegends,ffsn39z,t1_ffsll16,1580185945.0,"I’ve 1vs1 so many preds it’s not even funny, but I’m stuck solo in diamond. Even in diamond you have so many bad players who belong in gold or low plat and it makes ranked impossible to climb after diamond. Ranked is a joke tbh and pubs isn’t much better. Obviously the game feels like I should be facing predators in pubs despite it not letting me reach predator as a solo ranked player."
apexlegends,ffsmrkd,t1_ffslbko,1580185678.0,Yeah I turned it off
apexlegends,ffsmca0,t1_ffrkuyw,1580185335.0,"The worst part about ILG videos is the amount of filler he puts into them. Just get to the point man ffs. 

I respect T1MG but ILG not so much. T1MG decides to not leak game-spoiling content whereas ILG doesn’t care about what he puts out there."
apexlegends,ffsm65a,t1_ffrebdm,1580185202.0,I honestly wouldn’t mind that and I think that’s the best solution. But calling them out here and being hypocritical about it isn’t the way either. Frozenfroh has become a shameless karma farmer on this sub and is now attacking the very people that basically brought him to where he is now.
todayilearned,ffsiybu,t1_ffsiw2n,1580182835.0,Yeah I meant 185 lol
apexlegends,ffsga4b,t1_ffsfwcf,1580180987.0,"Don’t ask me I’m not saying that. Also, T1mG didn’t even leak this, it was ILG and Sethly and some other youtubers. I find the hate coming from Frozenfroh towards T1MG a bit hypocritical since [he was hyping and mining stuff about crypto’s release himself way back when.](https://www.google.nl/amp/s/www.ibtimes.com/apex-legends-leak-new-legend-named-crypto-could-be-coming-season-2-2802923%3famp=1)"

todayilearned,ffsciwf,t1_ffsahtu,1580178449.0,"It was back in 2006, so sizes might differ? But I vividly remember getting a Medium and being really surprised about fitting into it. Recently bought a Large shirt from an American retailer and it fits more like EU XL or XXL."
todayilearned,ffs8as0,t1_ffs67is,1580175598.0,"When I was obese at 270lbs 6ft1"" (120kg 185cm) and went to the States I was so surprised by how ""average"" I was. I would fit into medium clothing instead of XL or XXL. I still have a Ralph Lauren Polo shirt that's US S and right now at 158lbs (72kg) I'm literally swimming in it because of its sheer size."

worldnews,ffri8e5,t1_ffr9o8i,1580158514.0,"Yeah you're right, but just do a quick google search about 3-MCPD in soy sauces and you will find articles dating from before 2001. It's something that happens often and isn't always tested for by importers. I'd rather not take the risk and assume it's safe."
apexlegends,ffr76vn,t1_ffr2nr2,1580151940.0,"I don't love or hate leak culture but I don't see how that ruins everything for people. If anything, it builds up the hype for me because I see a little preview and it keeps my curiosity piqued."
worldnews,ffr2trl,t1_ffqnwxm,1580149234.0,"The anti-nuclear sentiment was very strong a few years ago and it has toned down a bit, but still not enough to make a difference. Meanwhile Germany still mostly runs on coal as if that’s somehow better than nuclear. I’m not discrediting Greta’s fight, I believe she has many good ideas and is right about our planet, but unless we can find a way to fully run the country on renewables having nuclear as a secondary option is the best of all evils."
apexlegends,ffqyfe1,t1_ffqnbyv,1580146449.0,They won't say how it works because then we could counter their system. They really don't care about anything but raking in the $$$.
worldnews,ffqwz1f,t1_ffqtx1r,1580145529.0,"Often enough many Chinese Soy Sauces contain too much 3-MCPD, a carcinogenic compound due to the way it's manufactured. A Dutch show [investigated it last year](https://www.npo3.nl/in-deze-sojasauzen-werd-3-mcpd-aangetroffen) and found many contaminated sauces. Your safest bet is getting a good Japenese soy sauce, as those are usually made by fermenting it over long periods of time instead of using hydrochloric acid. 

Chinese soy sauce can be made in as little as 3 hours using hydrochloric acid, but the Japenese fermented soy sauces take anywhere from 6 months to 3 years or even longer to produce and are therefore also more expensive."

apexlegends,ffpzwu0,t1_ffpt2gz,1580112916.0,"And that’s what new players should be learning too. Most new players and scrubs spend most of their time looting, looking for that perfect setup before they even think about fighting whereas most predators collect their loot from squads they’ve killed. It’s the faster and better way of collecting loot. Not only that, but many times these noobs also get caught out by the zone because they drop at the outer edges of the map."
apexlegends,ffpzgpi,t1_ffpohn5,1580112294.0,Even shroud said it: this game isn’t fun if you aren’t playing with a full pre-made squad and he’s right.

apexlegends,ffmh6wk,t1_ffmgsbu,1580054656.0,"Yeah no I honestly don’t care. After 1000+ hours you can easily see who’s gonna clutch and who isn’t. If I actually have a decent teammate I will stick around but that rarely happens. Sorry Reddit scrubs, you can downvote this but it won’t stop me leaving"
apexlegends,ffm4zgw,t1_ffkmhxz,1580048646.0,There’s two types of people in Apex. Those that want to kill farm and engage in many fights and keep on moving and the ones that literally run away from fights and spend most of the match looting locations far away from the center of the ring. The latter is what mostly populates reddit.
apexlegends,ffm4lot,t1_ffjnqgy,1580048429.0,Faster to re-queue than to watch some noob trying to land one shot before dying.

apexlegends,ffj32z9,t1_ffiwyci,1579989154.0,"Yeah Mendo is just toxic, but people like Aceu have serious complaints and his complaints get downvoted here. There are many pros who offer constructive criticism but y’all focus on the toxic ones smh."
apexlegends,ffj2q5j,t1_ffivfzk,1579988904.0,"It’s not just my ego. I don’t want to analyze every fight like I do in ranked. I just want to push a fight and not get instantly melted, have a little back and forth going on. I just had a match on KC with like 6 third parties. It was hectic, but fun. Yeah I died but it wasn’t in the same way as when you face a 3 stack pred team with g7’s and wingman’s who focus you. You think that just because you have the skills to be in a higher tier you want to be sweating every match? I play games to have fun and have never cared about the competitive aspect honestly. I just hit diamond every season in the first week to get the rewards and then fuck off to pubs to have mindless games. That all changed with SBMM."
apexlegends,ffiv8x7,t1_ffitahp,1579983546.0,"Are you not understanding what I'm saying? SBMM IS RANKED, so it doesn't make sense for SBMM to be in casual matches. That's all there's to it. Have ranked and remove SBMM from pubs."

apexlegends,ffi1rvm,t1_ffhvdqr,1579962518.0,"My complaint is that there was ranked in previous seasons as well and my skills haven’t deteriorated, if anything they have improved, yet somehow I’m doing worse stat wise than previous seasons. Not only that, but every pub match now is a fucking grind. It’s not just me, my friends who all picked up this game when it first dropped, have 20 kill badges, 3k or 4K badges are all experiencing the same. It’s not a fun game anymore to play casually and every pub match feels like ranked. If you try playing ranked in Diamond you get teamed up with dashboarders who belong in gold or low plat and you’re fighting against 3 stacks of predators, often in the top #100 world. I’ve faced Taisheen many times in diamond 4 lobbies how does that even make sense?

My friends have all given up on the game due to SBMM. It has completely taken the fun out of the game. If I can drop a 4K damage match in a platinum lobby where my squad mates are struggling to get one kill, but they are plat I somehow and will reach diamond soon how the hell is that supposed to pair up?"
oddlysatisfying,ffi196q,t1_ffhww90,1579962040.0,I’m the Metherlands you can also go up to the customer service desk and ask for one if you don’t have any change on you.

I had 280 wins in s1, 342 wins in s2 and 90 wins in s3 despite s3 being a month longer. I’d like to blame myself but this is really the result of SBMM fam."
apexlegends,ffhtulj,t1_ffhr7un,1579953604.0,"The map is beautiful that’s a given, but gameplay wise it’s a total downer. Too big, too many wide open areas and too many choke points"
apexlegends,ffhtoxq,t3_etpb3m,1579953379.0,This has been in the game since release. Just turn your party options to invite only.
apexlegends,ffht4n2,t1_ffhowe7,1579952556.0,"Which is actually a fresh breath for once. All the new legends so far have been defensive or recon. You can’t really count octane as a viable legend because his abilities...suck. Out of those 3, Wattson is the only viable legend and she is a defensive zoning type. Combine that with the sniper meta and worlds edge and you get a slow paced and rather boring game where there’s a whole lot of downtime in between fights."
apexlegends,ffhsr5y,t1_ffhsp3m,1579952000.0,I would’ve done the same tbh. The whole game mode didn’t make any sense.
