Y'ALL ARE FUCKING RESPONSIBLE, ***AND*** ACCOUNTABLE, FOR WHAT **YOU** DO. If you make a shitty community based on the perverted motive to sexually exploit anyone it can, and perpetuate that with self righteous arrogance regardless of how harmful it is to gay people, that's what you get.

I have been preaching this to people for fucking years! Look. If you wanna have sex, there's nothing wrong with that. **How** that happens is something that needs consideration though. Not everyone wants to meet in a crap slathered bathroom in a park to instantly drop their pants. Not everyone wants to send nudes and meet up to have sex in an instant. Some people want connections. They want to make friends. Maybe they want sex. Maybe they want it really bad. That doesn't mean they're obligated to act foolish. Some of us like to go on a date and see if we like the person first. Some of us have a 3 date rule. NOT EVERYONE IS FUCKING STUPID SLUT.

Yet everyone in gay culture tries to create these dumb cliques that reject and bash on people for not disregarding themselves for the sake of reckless perversion. Gay culture likes to push a perverted agenda and pretend people are obligated to act that way BECAUSE they're gay. People don't realize, this is exactly what homophobes were talking about. You're making them right. At this point every reason they had to not like you (not necessarily to harm you, but at least to reject you socially and not like you) is completely justified, because gay people think burning themselves over lust is gonna set homophobes on fire, and it's not.

Every time I bring this up or talk about it on the internet people get fucking mad and lose their shit. It's true though. Why they fuck do so many gay people *ACT* feminine, by portraying bad female stereotypes? Especially when they pick snobby female stereotypes to act like, like they think it makes them ""fierce."" (It doesn't of course. It just makes them look fucking dumb.) I mean I don't care how use to doing it you are. I don't care how gay you are. If you're not from California, talking that way isn't natural. It's an act.

The reason it's called a valley girl accent, is because it's native to people, IN THE VALLEY OF CALIFORNIA, and most notably prep school areas in northern California or around the bay and LA. Yeah it stands out in girls. Guys talk like that here too though. I mean, IT'S AN ACCENT. It's not like only 1 sex living somewhere gets the accent and the other is somehow immune to culture mannerisms. So like, as a Californian native, I talk that way, but that's because everyone here, in Los Angeles, in San Francisco, and the general valley area talks that way (To varrying degrees, but still...). Not because I'm bisexual.

I don't get why gay people idolize women and try to imitate bad female stereotypes. Especially when you're using an accent native to a specific geographic region THAT YOU'RE NOT EVEN FROM to do it.

>You can easily buy TET Manos clothes, TET gathering tool, and full DUO accessories for around 14B, and with Master 4 gathering that would give you 1130 gather mastery without cron meal or khan's heart.

I'm not even gonna talk about Khan's heart because that's a rare drop and buying one is a few billion silver for a stupid 25 points.

Also, DUO Manos accessories are more than twice the value of TRI blue, with a 4 point increase for rings and earrings (Increasing from 36 to 40) and a 5 point increase for necklace and belt (45 to 50).

5 x 2 = 10 for necklace + belt.

(4 x 2 = 8 for rings) + (4 x 2 = 8 for earrings) = 16.

16 + 10 = 26. 1004 + 26 = 1030.

You're 20 points off from the next bracket and you still need exactly 4,925,000,000 silver (The exact current cost of [TET Manos armor + tool] - [TET Carta + Doster]) or master 8 gathering (which would almost put you in the top 29 gatherers in-game) to hit it. Where do you even get that in the first place without good life-skilling, or mob killing for MONTHS?

There's another problem here too.

>And these pieces aren't really exponentially more expensive to make or buy than their predecessors, so I don't think you're in the hyperbolic part of the curve yet.

Currently as I look at the marketplace in game while I write this, blue accessories cost 400mil each for 36 (ring/earring) and 45 mastery (belt/necklace). For that 4 to 5 point increase you have to pay 1 bil per accessory (Roughly 600+mil more, MORE THAN TWICE THE PRICE). Let's do the math. 36/40 = .9 = 90%, which mean's you pay more than 100% for a 10% increase on rings and earrings. 45/50 (With the necklace and belt) = the exact same. So look, I'm not gonna sit here and argue. If you want to spend money stupidly for hard minimal gains that's up to you. The total increase you get from going TET blue armor + tool with TRI blue accessories, to ""TET Manos clothes, TET gathering tool, and full DUO accessories for around 14B"" is extremely minimal and the cost is extremely high. The cost-to-benefit ratio is poor, which makes doing that a bad investment.

You're also really missing the point here. Softcap is the end point at which is gets ridiculously harder to progress any further. After that point it's referred to as ""hardcap."" What your describing is NOT softcap. It would take ridiculous of time to pay off an **EXPENSIVE** (and not worth it) investment to even start profiting from equity, and the task doing so is not at all *easy*.

GOSH. 14 BILLION IS SO EASY TO COME BY THESE DAYS IT'S LIKE YOU DON'T NEED MASTERY GEAR TO MAKE MONEY AT ALL. /s ""BETTER WASTE IT ON A BAD INVESTMENT.""

>I know for fact that the game does not allow me to ""graduate"" from gathering a max 4 base mats to a max 5 - it goes straight to 6.

That's interesting. I'll look into that my self since you don't have a source.

I think though, perhaps you're one of the players who already had money laying around and not much else to buy with it, so having 14 billion silver to put on it you did so (along all that free time to work that much off), which is **MUCH** different. That's not normal. That's not something the majority of the players would consider ""easy"" nor ""softcap."" I'm sure veteran players who have more time and money in the game have an advantage as to how far they can push things, yet starting from the bottom and working up is what we're talking about here.

Regardless of semantics it's foolish to push further than 1004 though because it does not pay off. (Less money per time before equity starts.)"

I have been preaching this to people for fucking years! Look. If you wanna have sex, there's nothing wrong with that. **How** that happens is something that needs consideration though. Not everyone wants to meet in a crap slathered bathroom in a park to instantly drop their pants. Not everyone wants to send nudes and meet up to have sex in an instant. Some people want connections. They want to make friends. Maybe they want sex. Maybe they want it really bad. That doesn't mean they're obligated to act foolish. Some of us like to go on a date and see if we like the person first. Some of us have a 3 date rule. NOT EVERYONE IS FUCKING STUPID SLUT.

Yet everyone in gay culture tries to create these dumb cliques that reject and bash on people for not disregarding themselves for the sake of reckless perversion. Gay culture likes to push a perverted agenda and pretend people are obligated to act that way BECAUSE they're gay. People don't realize, this is exactly what homophobes were talking about. You're making them right. At this point every reason they had to not like you (not necessarily to harm you, but at least to reject you socially and not like you) is completely justified, because gay people think burning themselves over lust is gonna set homophobes on fire, and it's not.

If you're not from California, talking that way isn't natural. It's an act.

The reason it's called a valley girl accent, is because it's native to people, IN THE VALLEY OF CALIFORNIA, and most notably prep school areas in northern California or around the bay and LA. Yeah it stands out in girls. Guys talk like that here too though. I mean, IT'S AN ACCENT. It's not like only 1 sex living somewhere gets the accent and the other is somehow immune to culture mannerisms.

>You can easily buy TET Manos clothes, TET gathering tool, and full DUO accessories for around 14B, and with Master 4 gathering that would give you 1130 gather mastery without cron meal or khan's heart.

I'm not even gonna talk about Khan's heart because that's a rare drop and buying one is a few billion silver for a stupid 25 points.

Also, DUO Manos accessories are more than twice the value of TRI blue, with a 4 point increase for rings and earrings (Increasing from 36 to 40) and a 5 point increase for necklace and belt (45 to 50).

5 x 2 = 10 for necklace + belt.

(4 x 2 = 8 for rings) + (4 x 2 = 8 for earrings) = 16.

16 + 10 = 26. 1004 + 26 = 1030.

You're 20 points off from the next bracket and you still need exactly 4,925,000,000 silver (The exact current cost of [TET Manos armor + tool] - [TET Carta + Doster]) or master 8 gathering (which would almost put you in the top 29 gatherers in-game) to hit it. Where do you even get that in the first place without good life-skilling, or mob killing for MONTHS?

There's another problem here too.

>And these pieces aren't really exponentially more expensive to make or buy than their predecessors, so I don't think you're in the hyperbolic part of the curve yet.

Currently as I look at the marketplace in game while I write this, blue accessories cost 400mil each for 36 (ring/earring) and 45 mastery (belt/necklace). For that 4 to 5 point increase you have to pay 1 bil per accessory (Roughly 600+mil more, MORE THAN TWICE THE PRICE). Let's do the math. 36/40 = .9 = 90%, which mean's you pay more than 100% for a 10% increase on rings and earrings. 45/50 (With the necklace and belt) = the exact same. So look, I'm not gonna sit here and argue. If you want to spend money stupidly for hard minimal gains that's up to you. The total increase you get from going TET blue armor + tool with TRI blue accessories, to ""TET Manos clothes, TET gathering tool, and full DUO accessories for around 14B"" is extremely minimal and the cost is extremely high. The cost-to-benefit ratio is poor, which makes doing that a bad investment.

You're also really missing the point here. Softcap is the end point at which is gets ridiculously harder to progress any further. After that point it's referred to as ""hardcap."" What your describing is NOT softcap. It would take ridiculous of time to pay off an **EXPENSIVE** (and not worth it) investment to even start profiting from equity, and the task doing so is not at all *easy*.

GOSH. 14 BILLION IS SO EASY TO COME BY THESE DAYS IT'S LIKE YOU DON'T NEED MASTERY GEAR TO MAKE MONEY AT ALL. /s ""BETTER WASTE IT ON A BAD INVESTMENT.""

>I know for fact that the game does not allow me to ""graduate"" from gathering a max 4 base mats to a max 5 - it goes straight to 6.

That's interesting. I'll look into that my self since you don't have a source.

I think though, perhaps you're one of the players who already had money laying around and not much else to buy with it, so having 14 billion silver to put on it you did so (along all that free time to work that much off), which is **MUCH** different. That's not normal. That's not something the majority of the players would consider ""easy"" nor ""softcap."" I'm sure veteran players who have more time and money in the game have an advantage as to how far they can push things, yet starting from the bottom and working up is what we're talking about here.

Regardless of semantics it's foolish to push further than 1004 though because it does not pay off. (Less money per time before equity starts.)"
