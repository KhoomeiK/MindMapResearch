My point to this is that basing a performance on critical reception is valid and not a new practice. Bethesda didn't do it to screw Obsidian over. Bethesda gave Obsidian a deadline, Obsidian said ""we can do that"". B and O agreed to conditions for a bonus, a score of 85 by critic reviews by such date, and Obsidian failed.

I didn't have any of the foundation a family with its shit together provides kids growing up in it. The hope is that when a kid leaves the house they have some preparation for the world, the foundations, and a support network of family and friends to navigate the hard stuff. How to do adult stuff, how to function normally and independently, how to navigate relationships, hopefully with some experience, process emotions, feelings, talk about and through things, interact normally with people. All the stuff that goes into living that is just a normal function of day to day life, and sometimes part of the bigger events. I got very little of that, and most of what I did get in very unhealthy ways.

Abusive home, one parent who worked himself to exhaustion to provide (too exhausted to care) and another who used us as slave labor and babysitters. Homeschooled, and piss poorly at that, so lack of decent and well rounded education. Brainwashed into an ultra conservative, cult like, Catholicism. No lessons in handling money, saving, no healthy experiences with girls (""girls are evil and will only corrupt you""), few healthy relationships with boys (mostly because they weren't Catholic or culty enough), no lessons in life experiences. No hands on skills taught. I can cook basic stuff, but only because I had to sometimes cook for my family. I can clean a house, change a diaper, do grocery shopping, plan meals, but not budget. No healthy relationships with family because we were explicitly taught the only family we could trust was Mom. Not Dad, not siblings, grandparents, aunts, etc. Through actions and words, Mom was the only one we were allowed to trust. Physically and emotionally abused in adoptive family, those plus sexually abused in foster before that. All of which went untreated. Raised to be 100% dependant on my parents, specifically my mom. 
It says something about me that it broke me when my dad died a few years ago, despite what an awful person he could be. He was rarely abusive like my mom, but when he was it hurt. I have a scar on my face from his belt buckle and remember the feeling of the scissors on my chest. Yet the world that took me 4 fucking years to build was just gone. Medication for depression just stopped working, mental exercises to manage anxiety just vanished..

My entire identity growing up was founded on two things, cultivated by my mom. Being her golden child, and a good Catholic boy. It made me so fucking proud to be those. When I rejected them because I caught a glimpse of just how fucked up it all was, my personal identity crashed, and with it my worldview, my belief system, everything that made me me, was just gone. So not only did I have some really shitty foundations, I ripped up the land around them scorched Earth style because the whole thing was just fucked. And I did it without an understanding that I needed help, professional help, to rebuild (by the time I'd begin seeking help, 4 years later, I'd already fucked up my first opportunity in college). 

Anxiety, depression, PTSD, sexual dysfunction, crippling self esteem, poor educational foundation, no self motivation stemming from years of being told whatever I do I will fail at because it isn't what she had planned for me, reinforced by years of trying so desperately to succeed, only to fail to combinations of factors out of my control and my own actions, often in response to said factors. 

And anytime I start to manage things, claw my way through this shit, start to get my life on track, get my shit together, become the man I wanted to become when I first fled the house, something happens that sets me back years. An ex ghosting/cheating on me, my dad dying, friends betraying me. 

Edit: When you hit a certain low, little things snowball to big. For example, I have dirty dishes in my room right now. I've made a few efforts to wash them, but my roommates have filled the sink with their dirty dishes that they don't wash. In order to wash mine, I'd have to go through theirs. And I've done that in the past, but it just repeats. And that's assuming the sink doesn't just stop running water for awhile, which happens a lot because it's old and somewhat broken. Because I have dirty dishes sitting on a shelf, I can't put other things there for storage, so I plop them on the ground. Now I've got stuff on the ground, so I just toss more there. And more. And because I've got stuff on the ground I don't want to walk around or through it to my garbage, so I throw more of that on the ground. And now I'm living in literal trash. Except I'm not currently, because a couple days ago I partially cleaned up my room, vacuumed, sorted dirty and clean clothes, and threw out 4 trash bags of garbage and old mail/packages. And that was fucking exhausting. That's just part of ""having your shit together"", and it was a struggle to do that.


**TL:DR** A big part of why I don't ""have my shit together"" is that the foundations most of us get for how to live and function as adults, I either didn't get or got very unhealthy versions of. Having to not just build foundations but often unlearn or tear down existing ones in order to be a healthy adult is incredibly fucking hard by itself, even more so with life constantly throwing shit at the fan."

offmychest,fe3nf1r,t1_fe29kwi,1578850966.0,"No. You say that, but you didn't actually think it through. The second you give a government the legal authority to neuter/chemically castrate its citizens, you've lost. You might think it's for a good cause, neutering creepy old men who assault young girls (although this isn't even that, since nobody was actually assaulted), but one day the government decides to use it for other things, and quickly it becomes abused.

Edit: For those downvoting me, do you want the government to have the authority to decide which citizens are sterilized, castrated, or neutered? You might say yes, thinking it will only be the bad people you think should deserve it, but what if one day the government decides that's you? It's been done in the past, so why would you think it wouldn't be abused in the future?"

You are absolutely right. Most sexism in the US is not a bunch of misogynistic men making decisions with the explicit purpose of excluding or offending women. That stuff happens because sexism against women in the US and Western world is so casually ingrained in society that it's often not recognized at all or dismissed as unimportant by the people perpetuating those behaviors."
