Futurology,fgstxgt,t1_fgrfo9p,1581092582.0,I've always wondered why they can't go in and laser the calcified plaque. Is it because breaking it apart runs the risk of releasing a dangerous size piece into the blood stream?

But I know someone who was stuck in traffic while their wife was in labor. They called 911 and as police officer was close by he escorted them to the hospital.

The point is to call emergency services and they will decide what the best/safest course of action is. Don't try and do it yourself because you are going to get yourself and/or someone else killed."

A very well thought out and explained response. I never thought of it being mutual trust.

To add to the discussion, I wonder how much different things would be in Hong Kong if they had the 2nd ammendment as we do. Do you think the HKPF would be so open about abusing their power as they have been?"
