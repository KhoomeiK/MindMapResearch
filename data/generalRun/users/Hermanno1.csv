What I like about Denmark is the beaches, the food and how peaceful it is, nothing else is really that interesting. What I hate is the people especially outside the cities, people are narrow minded, some are rude and don't like to look beyond the norm. I also hate how little nature there is and I hate our language, I totally understand why people say that it sounds like we have a potato in our mouths when speaking, words that sound so cool in English just sound totally lame in Danish."

I hear this all the time, where people view relationships as the embodiment of happiness, but I'm here to say that there are pros and cons to being in a relationship and being single, trust me I've seen so many people just loose themselves and their individuality in a relationship, which is really scary. Take your time and find someone who are on the same wavelength as you and it will be so much more worth it, than rushing into a bad relationship and wasting everyone's time. But yeah I can definitely relate to what you said about missing someone to love, that's the hardest part of being single."

If i can give you some tips then I would recommend to take it a bit easy, don't implement too much stuff at once, it will burn you out, try to focus on your diet first, and after you've lost the weight you want you can then start by implementing some training.

I've been doing a min of 18 hours fasting everyday since the 10th of December, but my average is about 21 hours, it's really easy and I don't really feel that limited, but it all depends on the person and I don't recommend it for everyone. Drinking plenty of water has also helped me a lot, better skin and cleaner teeth. Its also important to think of unhealthy food as a treat, I only drink soda when I'm out for dinner or at the cinema, and when I finally have it I enjoy it way more.

Btw fasting by itself won't amount to weight loss, but it can be a good method of limiting the time you eat so that you won't eat as much, just want to make that clear for people, it's a lifestyle that fits some people great like myself and I use it with a combination of being in a calorie deficit.

Keep at it, doesn't matter how much you loose, just that you are working towards a goal is really respectable."

Have you seen the statistics of people who get divorces, in my family 4/6 families have been divorced, it's been traumatic for my cousins to see their parents fight and yell at each other, my parents were close to getting divorces aswell. People tell themselves that once they get in a relationship have kids, get wealth and success they will be happy and live a meaningful life, but those people lie to themselves, or are delusional. Once you have lost your childish ignorance and seen life for what it is then there is no way back, it's a gift and a curse, that's why you are here you have acknowledged that life is a mess and that you don't want another being to experience it.

The loneliness and lack of love you can experience while single can be crushing and the judgement from society can so too, 

Being in a relationship can too be very difficult and grim, I've seen so many families get divorced and just experienced so much suffering, I've seen people gain significant amounts of weight during a relationship, couples shouting at each other and acting like complete fools in public, I've seen people loose their individuality and just almost merge together with their SO.

It's not about one being superior to the other it's about choosing one type of cancer over the other and what best fits ones lifestyle, either way you'll regret any decision you make in life so it doesn't matter anyway.

There are pros and cons in both being single and in a relationship, so don't get too optimistic. But congratulations non the less, one can always hope that people stay together although the statistics aren't looking too good.

My advice to you would be to throw out happiness and replace it with meaning, because happiness is fleeting it's an emotion which can't be attained all the time, but when you have something meaningful in your life then it will satisfy your life and in turn enhance your sense of purpose and well being, and sure that can be another person, but it shouldn't be the only thing that bringd you meaning, because then you become a very stressful and annoying person to be around if you see that person as the embodiment of everything ""good and meaningful"" and the main source for your ""happiness"""

In the past people lived shorter lives, so a person who died by age 30 had experienced (often) less suffering than a person today who lives to age 90, they rarely got to experience the terribleness of old age back then.

antinatalism,fdiy0t0,t3_elmoio,1578453633.0,"I disagreed by saying that our civilisation is doomed to extinction no matter if we continue reproducing or stop reproducing. Another civilisation will likely rise again after us but would have either way, reproduction or not, maybe sooner, maybe later depending on our actions.

I want to understand this, because if there is a flaw in antinatalism I feel it's important to address so I dont go and spread false information, but I don't understand how not reproducing will lead to more suffering?

But yeah now that I'm here my goal is to be a good human and reduce other people's suffering"
