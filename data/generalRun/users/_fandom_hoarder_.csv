I start to slowly back away and as I  turn my head slightly I notice a cub standing behind me. The momma bear started to look really angry so I ran to the side so that I wouldn’t be between the mom and the baby, but the bear had already started to lunge in for an attack. I kept running toward the side and glance back quickly only to realize that the bear wasn’t lunging at me, it was lunging at its cub. The bear scooped the cub up in its arms and proceeded to break every bone in the cubs body (I heard every snap). Once the cub was sufficiently broken, the momma bear started twisting the cub into pretzel shapes, made eye contact with me, dropped the cub, and ran away."
