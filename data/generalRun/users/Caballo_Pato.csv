depression,fdda639,t3_cml6ni,1578302087.0,"I was doing so good, I find a lot of healing helping others in this forum and then a devastating bad news. All the safe hate is back, I can't stop crying, have to concentrate really hard to keep my breathing stable. This is lasting about 12 hours now. A lot of feelings of self harm, but I am not alone so no high risk. 

I am trying to concentrate in the good but the headache is so strong I can only hate. I feel I am not worthy of being alive. This is a very bad step backwards. Can't reach professional help where  I am. Trying my best to stabilize, warm in bed, dangerous things away. Will cry and rest, try to distract myself. I am such a piece of shit. I can't see anything good and I am paralized by fear and impotece. I know what to do, but too much panic. 

Trying to calm down. We all have bad days, this one is mine."
