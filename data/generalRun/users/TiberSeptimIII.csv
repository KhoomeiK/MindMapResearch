TrueReddit,ffnd23f,t1_ffm9y49,1580064473.0,"Who exactly is *Facebook* accountable to?  The thing is that these guys **brag** about being big enough to swing an election and when caught using that power to actually affect the election, it’s seen as time to tell them to delete, censor or label as ‘bad’ anything they think is unworthy.  The same people who allowed Cambridge Analytics to manipulate the election are now supposed to be tasked with determining the truth of political claims, that’s insane to me.  

I don’t think anything should be censored based on the content in a forum that has so much monopoly power over political and social discourse.  This isn’t a minor corner of the internet, it’s a place that bills itself as a place open to the public for public discussion like a pub or a store or a restaurant.  If I can’t kick you out of my pub because you said something I wish you didn’t, Facebook shouldn’t be able to kick me off for the same kinds of things.  A content neutral rule, I can get behind it.  Don’t be violent or no libel or slander is reasonable."
TrueReddit,ffm7lbk,t1_ffkoapi,1580049837.0,"How do you do that without effectively creating a large scale censorship project?  If you’re going to evaluate content and ideas, at some point either a human or an AI created by a human is going to make the call that certain ideas are ‘unfit to be read’.  And that, especially on a platform as large as Facebook or Twitter or even Reddit can (at present, not in the future) can absolutely swing elections. 

That is pretty much the end goal of such talk— unelected, unaccountable entities getting to decide what information is too dangerous to be allowed.  The ability for said groups to control democracy.  Elections will be won on Facebook in the back room where monies interests can decide to allow or not allow or declare false anything that undermines the desired outcome.  

The social media networks want that power because other companies and the government will give them lots of money to control the dialogue around the issues that affect them or to provide the names of troublemakers."
thelastpsychiatrist,ffm4vg9,t3_etrsin,1580048594.0,I think just observationally that this is true of all relationships.  I think it’s honestly why our mental health is so bad.  You don’t want a real relationship with a real person.  You want a low maintenance relationship with a person who’s fun to be around and helps you when you need it but never has needs of their own.  And lots of people will dump you the minute you need something from them.

The coup that prevents more serious opposition to war is in keeping the downsides of war **abstract**.  If people saw maimed bloated bodies, dead kids with limbs blown off, starving babies, and other concrete downsides of the war, we wouldn’t be fighting nearly so many.  By allowing *only* sanitized images (flags on caskets, for example) you undercut all the opposition.  If they saw kids blown up by ieds or amaumed soldier, they would not like it.  Even Abu Graib was sanitized."
Futurology,fff82mu,t1_ffeqprm,1579878053.0,"I think we need to do both.  It should be illegal to use data for purposes beyond what the person actually authorized.

But then again, I don’t think that negates the need to promote data awareness and data safety.  Telling someone to not walk alone down a dark alley doesn’t mean that I don’t think mugging should be illegal.  It just means that even with a law you don’t want to do things that put you in a dangerous situation. I wouldn’t do things with my data without thinking about whether I’m okay with the consequences.

TheMotte,ff67dja,t1_ff355mb,1579620884.0,"Well yes, but I think since most people don’t take modern western ideas as seriously as they used to (more people are into Vipassana meditation than the Rosary, for example, and fewer take Christianity seriously) so while you could try to revamp the 1950s ideas, it probably won’t work.  

And the problem with using Eastern thought as a basis for creating meaning in the West is that it’s not nearly as easy to map Eastern ideas onto a Western culture.  We are a lot more individualistic than the traditional cultures that gave rise to Confucianism.  We didn’t and still don’t have the same social structures. I think the East has a lot to teach us, but I don’t think a blind copy of Chinese philosophy will work as well as we think it will.

Also, I think a lot of the stuff we’ve left behind is equally as true and beautiful as the Tao or Buddha or Confucius.  We just don’t look into it anymore.  Secular Buddhist ideas and Epicurean ideas are similar.  Plotinus or Aristotle and Cicero and the Stoics have a lot of the same ideas as eastern philosophy, but developed in a culture much closer to our own and thus more likely to give revelant advice."
Foodforthought,ff3776g,t1_ff33opn,1579535325.0,"I think this is probably the only answer.  You have to get out of the bubble and talk to and listen to people who you disagree with.  Having a gatekeeper is a terrible idea for a couple of reasons.

First, it is susceptible to manipulation.  The most powerful position in any society is the guy who decides what you can and cannot hear. And once that starts in ernest, people with axes to grind will take over those positions.  Think about it.  If you can kick viewpoints from the big three social media networks, you assure that very few people will hear of that idea.  And thus it won’t win elections.  

Second, it creates a problem in that you can’t audit the gatekeeper.  Is snopes accurate?  The Times?  Drudge?  If they’re the people tasked with the decision of whether a fact is true or not is on them but you can’t check them.  If they decide it’s fake, it’s memory-holes and you can’t actually confirm that it’s a lie.  You probably won’t even know a different version existed.  

Third it’s a great way to allow for corruption.  Just declare all those stories about the leader to be lies and delete them before the public hears them.  Ukraine phone call?  Fake news.  Hillary making a lot of money from her foundation?  Ha fake.  Delete those lies."

They are wrong about the causes and solutions, but the feelings are normal and most people who are in those kinds of positions will feel that way.

Gay isn’t all that different, especially if we’re talking about a white gay guy.  

Second, it’s an ally against the killjoy Christian Right.  The right, at the time of the first blush of gay acceptance was doing a very loud very public morality crusade.  Ripper Gore was labeling ‘bad’ music.  There was a crusade to stop premarital sex (see Murphy Brown scandal).  The CR was opposed to abortion as well.

You can’t make the hot wings, beer and pizza diet into the next big diet trend if the early adopters are incels.  I can’t convince you to take social justice seriously if the people into it are uncool.  I can’t sell people on beards if the people with beards are poor rednecks.  

Ideally you want to find the kind of people that are either aspirational in a social sense or those who appeal to those people.  Like Yoga is pretty big but it’s big with upper class white educated people.  Meditation is in that same demographic— UCEWP.  Things like drinking beer and playing rough sports are working class and nobody wants to be like them.  MCU is big, but only the movies not the actual comics and not the obscure stuff that isn’t in the movies.  The movies are loved first by the IT guys.

1.	 He is supernaturally good at getting the opposition to overreact.  He can thus make his opposition look positively stupid.  He can also make very serious charges disappear because his enemies vastly oversell it and by the time the nitty gritty stuff becomes known it’s covered up by so much hyperbole and outrage and scissors statements that most people have long since tuned out.  And therefore getting the public engaged enough to *demand* a real investigation into the impeachment charges.  Or whatever else.  The same skill keeps his base super involved.  It’s weird.  The people talking about serious insurrection on social media are *Trump fans*.  They’re ready to go full Civil War (\#bugaloo) the left is yelling, but not ready to march in the streets. 
2.	Trump knows how to get the middle American riled up.  He doesn’t have a base, he for all intents has groupies.  He somehow made these guys follow him like they follow football.  He knows how to look and sound exactly like them so no matter what he actually says, he sounds truthful to them.  
3.	he knows how to play with attention spans.  He knows that things don’t stay in the public unless there’s a lot of new things to talk about.  By talking about the story himself when there’s no news on it, he can essentially make it boring to most people.

The school itself gives almost no information about the actual usefulness of any program they offer.

That, to me is akin to someone trying to get you to buy a car but never telling you the miles on the car, or the age of the car, or the maintenance history, then also refusing to give a total cost.  Nobody would buy a car or a house unless all of the above were disclosed and written out and verified.  Nobody seems to care when it’s a school program.  

Personally, I think everyone going to college should basically write a sort of career business plan.

Even if we weren’t massively increasing the number of years a person draws SS.  

The second problem is also easily seen with SS. We live in a democracy, and in a democracy, numbers matter. That means that not only can we not fix the problems (Because that requires cutting benefits) but we have to increase the payouts. It’s easy mode re-election.

So they can get only the stuff that’s too shitty for people who already have it so much better than they do.  

I think a compromise is possible to let everyone thrift without having the poor shoved out of the way for the rich to take the good stuff before they have a shot at it.  I want a poor ten year old kid to get a cool (if used) Star Wars shirt instead of some professional thrift company takes it to sell it to some neck beard who only wants it because it’s ‘vintage’.  Under the current system the poor won’t ever get anything name brand, or that still looks nice, or has a fandom attached because the rich hire pros to get that stuff the minute it comes in.  

It’s not that I’m telling you not to thrift, I’m telling you to create a system so that the poor can get clothes and dishes and so on that are fairly nice."

SubredditDrama,fcotmku,t1_fco2it6,1577841224.0,"I’m not saying don’t thrift.  I’m saying be mindful that you are quite possibly taking something that means the world to a poor person because you are rich enough to buy from a company that pays a guy to camp out at goodwill to snag anything of value while the poor are working. 

I think there’s room for both.  But what I hate about the current system is that it absolutely pushes poor people aside in favor of rich people.  Like used stuff that still looks decent is too nice for the poor to be allowed to have it.  Like they can’t even be allowed to buy someone’s castoff Nike’s from two years ago because someone with more money wants them.  That seems unnecessary and cruel to poor people who just want their kids to occasionally get nice stuff."
SubredditDrama,fcnv0ix,t1_fckav72,1577818970.0,"But only the ones old enough and ugly enough to not be resold to richer people.  Which is the part that I’m not good with.  Because of resellers, the only clothing poor people can buy for themselves is stuff that’s really shitty stuff that are not good enough for rich people. 

I think if you’re going to allow that, then there should be either a designated day or an extra fee to discourage people from camping out at the point where the clothing is being brought out.  At least that way, poor people have a shot at finding something good instead of being only allowed the cast offs of the cast offs."

FanTheories,fcjxqsx,t1_fchs57g,1577709654.0,"I didn’t call it a good plan, but given that Disney has a history with princesses, I think it makes sense that they’ll keep her around because doing otherwise is fiscally risky and might hurt sales of dolls and stuff.  It’s one reason that I hate their monopoly franchise approach to filmmaking.  You can’t take seeious risks and do something original because people might not like it."
FanTheories,fcfspfe,t3_egm7r3,1577633341.0,"Another point in support is that Rey in either case is a princess, and Disney doesn’t kill off princesses.  Or turn them evil.  Plus the series promos took great pain to point out that they purposely had a diverse cast."
samharris,fcewzfe,t3_egxu5l,1577624517.0,"I think it’s ultimately futile anyway.  These sorts of screenings can’t catch racists for the same reason it can’t catch Star Wars fans — you cannot read minds so unless you have a history and a pretty active one at that with a known racist group, you aren’t going to be caught without turning over social media."

“Blacks don’t know how to express emotions.  Here’s how it hurts white people.”

It’s completely insane to talk about a problem faced by one group of people in terms of how it affects somebody else.  Men’s suffering is about men, not women.  Black peoples suffering isn’t about white people.  Like what’s wrong with people?"
