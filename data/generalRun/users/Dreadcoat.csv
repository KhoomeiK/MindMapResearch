But just to add, dont sit too close. Protect your eyes! 

If you play on PC dont waste your money on Gunnars or similar products. Download F.lux - it does exactly what gunnars do, apply a blue light filter tint to the screen so you dont burn your eyeholes out. Itll also help you get to sleep better and may even reduce headaches.

Repetition is your best friend.

A beginner practices to learn, a master practices to perfect. In other words, you will always be practicing.

Very helpful to learn playing with a click. Theres hundreds of free metronome apps. You can use it when practicing things like scales or even learning a song by halving the BPM and working your way up, that way even though youre playing slower youre still in time.

Never be afraid to step out of your musical comfort zone. This is especially true if you want to start songwriting.

No you do not have to start playing on an acoustic because the strings are harder. If you only want to play metal just start on an electric. 

Learn to take care of your guitar. Cleaning. Restringing. How to adjust the neck. How to adjust the bridge if necessary. Etc. 

You dont have to be a guitar hero. Learning how to play the rhythymn portions of a song can be just as important.

If you arent having fun, put it down for awhile. You dont need to play every day and sometimes taking a break can be more beneficial than just beating your head against a wall.
