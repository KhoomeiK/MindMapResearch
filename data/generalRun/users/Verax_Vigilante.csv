likeus,ffe5a7w,t3_eswiwa,1579837065.0,Who else wondered at the end if he would figure out to step just a few more steps to get the platform to move?
aww,ff46zz1,t1_ff3tu5l,1579556916.0,I like the idea of someone actively in the process of receiving SARS and them being aware of it lol.
aww,ff45hpn,t3_erft7p,1579555979.0,This is so cute
aww,ff45gq8,t1_ff3myye,1579555962.0,Even if you look at him?
Paladins,ff3w0mq,t3_ere3r6,1579550077.0,"I have a dumb question. Can someone please tell me if the new chat system took away Laugh, Joke, and Taunt?

I can't find it, but I still see some people in the game tell jokes? Is it because they are on a different platform possibly?"
Eminem,ff3vhzr,t1_ff372cx,1579549752.0,"Nah, should be on the front cover just as it is. You don't put that on the back."
MMA,ff3teq6,t3_er5ih7,1579548453.0,"Watch it again. He didn't take the mic, the music started to play, but even THAT stopped when she started speaking. But, she had already heard the music, so she just said nevermind.

What I'm saying is, the music people were even quick to react by turning OFF the music when she started speaking. Now, the absolute FAILURE is on Joe Rogan, for not actively saying, ""no, Holly, come back, it's fine, what were you going to say?""

&#x200B;

That's where Joe Rogan failed."
Paladins,ff3igxg,t3_er6iq3,1579541740.0,"Unpopular opinion:  Don't give options for support to do really good damage. That will deter people from picking support classes for the SOLE purpose of damage. If you're picking support, just do your job and heal."
aww,fes8se4,t3_eqfhyk,1579362618.0,I can't help but wonder if it's totally safe to send her out there like that. But guess they know each other (hopefully) and so there was no risk of the horse feeling spooked or startled by anything unpredictable that a little kid could do.
microbork,fes885u,t3_eqg66q,1579362438.0,Love the little reaction once the scratching resumes
Eminem,fehpu36,t1_fefxjhn,1579121472.0,That's my favorite album in general.

ChildofHoarder,fefy0jw,t3_ec4c74,1579069009.0,"The argument I use is, ""well when is the last time you even THOUGHT about using this?"" 

And my mother can never logically answer that. It drives me crazy. I told her I'm not visiting anymore until she addresses this."
ChildofHoarder,fefxewn,t1_fcc4t07,1579068384.0,"When you say move on, are you saying don't visit them? I know for me everytime I visit my mother, I've tried all these things you said, and you're right, it never works.

What radical/shocking thing did you do? Or are you saying nothing worked and you don't visit anymore?"
ChildofHoarder,fefxbq0,t1_fckclpw,1579068295.0,"I'm about your age. I have a question, so do you still visit them? It makes me angry every time I visit my mother."
holdmyfeedingtube,feefxzb,t3_eohkgd,1579032954.0,I watched this 4 times cause I thought that person lost their lower half.
aww,fecxsqb,t3_eod1tj,1578988973.0,"I like the idea of him sitting there setting up a profile, verifying his identity, etc."
instant_regret,fecxmy9,t1_feci67o,1578988774.0,"I didn't know concussions could affect a person's impulse control, that's very interesting. Is it like an urge to say things?"
likeus,fecxh8z,t1_fechyjr,1578988576.0,"For some reason I pictured you crawling away on those very fingers, with a whimsical xylophone sound playing."
holdmyfeedingtube,fecxaq0,t1_feau0hj,1578988355.0,Really? I went to the ghettoest high school in America and have never seen this happen.
IdiotsInCars,fe3xams,t3_ennz49,1578853698.0,"This is the ONE time where I'd advocate rape. Just so she will spend the rest of her days withdrawn, shameful, hating herself, and completely mellowed out, to say the least."
AccidentalRacism,fe09d6a,t3_enj5xk,1578806733.0,Oh god that looks so disgusting. Them piled up like that.
instant_regret,fe04ebx,t1_fe01kdu,1578802790.0,I kinda agree. It looks staged. And the reaction at the end seems over the top.
likeus,fdnhtbh,t3_elzdax,1578586104.0,"This is fascinating, how they turn around. Like how can they even conceive that:

1) That it's an image they're looking at (and not just 2 weird, small cats)

2) And even more fascinating, the fact that they somehow comprehend that this is a type of ""mirror,"" to know to turn around to investigate the ""source"" of how this weird, magical image is being projected.

Animals are amazing. Can y'all do one with a dog next, and a dog filter, if they have that? Thanks."
holdmyfeedingtube,fdn8h2c,t3_elusc7,1578580104.0,"I recently discovered this reddit, and it makes me wonder how many of these people actually die in these clips. Some of these are insane."
doggifs,fd7jf71,t3_dhzk1n,1578205461.0,I wanna see more of that dog
dogswithjobs,fcwdzgv,t3_ej2rcr,1578023224.0,Man I wish I could see a video of this
PetTheDamnDog,fcslrbh,t3_eieb1p,1577919224.0,He looks so happy
