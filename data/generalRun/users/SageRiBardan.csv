warriors,fgtvume,t1_fgtocsj,1581110051.0,"I suppose all we can do is wait and see. Unfortunately it seems a lot of fans don't want to be patient. I'm not going to bother with platitudes because I don't think anyone wanted or expected this season to go this way. At this point I agree that general fit and roster building are key for the team to continue to compete at the level they have in the last few years. I'm just hopeful that Wiggins will flourish here with Steph and Klay, no way to know until they are finally together."
warriors,fgtleof,t1_fgtl0k5,1581106050.0,"Being in Minnesota can't be good for anyone trying to grow and evolve as a player. Not to dump on the T-wolves but coming to the Warriors and knowing that this season ""doesn't count"" hopefully does good things for Wiggins mentally and will help his game."
warriors,fgth29a,t1_fgtfs80,1581104410.0,"Yeah, I feel like All Star is ""neat"" but players want championships. If Wiggins works out and has good chemistry with Steph, Klay, and everyone to where we win again I don't think it matters whether LeBron picks him to be an All Star (or however they are doing it these days)."
TheMaskedSinger,fgtf1a9,t1_fgtevil,1581103648.0,Yep! I want him to do it. It would be so fun and I doubt many would expect it to happen.

I want them to have someone guest judge for one group (A) and then be a contestant in a different group (C). Since the judges don't determine the winners it would be a good way to throw people off."
TheMaskedSinger,fgtdvzz,t3_f0e5qd,1581103131.0,I like the solo artist format. It allows people who are known for being in a group to step up solo.

My dream contestant is someone too big to even consider being on the show. Or some one hit wonder who performs their own song."

I wasn't a huge fan of Matrix 2 & 3 but I'm excited to see if Lana can revive the series."
warriors,fgt4mvn,t3_f0dugo,1581098952.0,"Does being an All Star matter that much? It will be 8 years after being drafted (and being rookie of the year). Which all doesn't matter to me if he can step up during the regular season and contribute. I want the best players to support Steph, Klay, and Draymond. I don't care who they are as long as they can play."
YouShouldKnow,fgt3tto,t3_f0e1t8,1581098468.0,"Well if the game is still canon I hope they have some voiceover narrative or scrolling intro to explain it. Also need to explain how Trinity is still alive since she died outside the Matrix. 

The third movie ended with the machines taking Neo's ""body"", though there is no reason to believe he was dead at that point. Overall I'm very skeptical that they won't toss out the game for simplicity and expediency."

community,fgsl6qj,t1_fgsh4lx,1581087075.0,"It is the last Sony/MCU movie, the new deal covers one Spider-Man movie and one more guest appearance in a Marvel movie until a new deal has to be made. This deal only happened because Tom Holland made a personal appeal to Iger and Rothman to get done. The deal feels like a way to close out the trilogy and then move on."

I have a 5 year old so here's what we've read/been reading. Mo Willems Elephant and Pig books, my daughter loves them. 

A Big Mooncake for Little Star by Grace Lin is a beautiful sweet book. 

The Friend Ship by Kat Yeh & Chuck Groenink

The Watermelon Seed by Greg Pizzoli

Kitten's First Full Moon by Kevin Henkes

I'd suggest buying for a slightly older child, they will get a ton of board books that they can chew on.  They are good for a 2-5 year old at least."
Sacramento,fgri2vl,t1_fgrfzm3,1581047351.0,"Right, I mean really calm down OP! It's a sign for a store, I'm sure people are upset that they didn't properly handle it but demanding money and threatening people is unnecessary. None of us are perfect at our jobs and to get this angry about the sign for a corporation, even a homegrown one, is melodramatic."
community,fgr2vmp,t1_fgr11h5,1581036919.0,"That's what I think it was intended to be, just like the Shocker, Mac Gargan (Scorpion), The Tinkerer, and, I'm sure, a bunch of names were dropped in the first movie. I don't believe that Sony wanted to develop Miles Morales with Marvel because they had Spiderverse in the works and the partnership with Marvel was for 2/3 Spider-Man movies."
Sacramento,fgqwlc1,t3_f00770,1581033019.0,"The commute to Roseville from Midtown/Downtown is not fun (understatement). It would be smarter to live-in the Roseville area and then drive into downtown to have fun. Doing this you avoid constantly dealing with the terrible parking situation, the escalating homeless issue, and the late night drunks. However, if you still want to be in the city do yourself a favor and look in East Sacramento/Tahoe Park Elmhurst or West Sacramento. Both have quick access to downtown without the problems of downtown.

My wife and I lived in a Victorian in midtown for a few years, while she commuted to Roseville each day, before moving to Tahoe Park. Only regret not moving sooner."
community,fgqvl7l,t1_fgqn5gg,1581032422.0,"I just don't see it happening with this being the last MCU/Sony Spider-Man movie, the way the last one ended, and the rumor that Kraven is going to be the villain. This iteration of Spider-Man has been one villain per movie with his real life foibles as the subplot. I'd love to see the Prowler and Miles but not if it takes the focus away from Peter, after all Miles will be back in the Spiderverse sequel the following year."
youtubetv,fgqdzi5,t1_fgqaukx,1581022362.0,When you DVR something it also allows access to all the episodes that are available. As your DVR is limitless there's no need to worry about running out of space. It should tell you how many new episodes you have to watch in your library.
netflix,fgq8kn2,t3_ezxu8n,1581019873.0,I'm ecstatic they finally added this! I'm so sick of browsing through and having a show start.

StayAtHomeDaddit,fgq2eet,t3_ezx72i,1581016579.0,"Watch it with my 5 year old little girl often. Only kids show on Disney Junior that has legit made me tear up (the camping episode because I have fond memories of camping & I could imagine my daughter in a similar situation). 

I never complain when she wants to watch the show because it is fun, has quiet moments, and teaches without ""preaching"" at her. We implemented the ""touch my arm to get my attention"" when I'm talking to a grown up. And I sympathize with that dad so much."
youtubetv,fgq10ia,t3_ezwzs7,1581015823.0,"I had Hulu live with no commercials and switched to YouTube TV as soon as I learned about it. 100% the best thing about YouTube TV compared to Hulu Live is the Guide, finding shows is much easier. Also I can add a ton of shows to my DVR without having to worry about filling it up, YouTube TV is less expensive IIRC, and you can record more than one show at a time.

TheMaskedSinger,fgpxg0t,t3_ezwh6n,1581013862.0,"I honestly wondered when I was watching the first episode if they made it obvious that White Tiger was Gronk because they thought he would be off first (the night of the Super Bowl), I mean he can't really sing and he does silly dances. But people vote for what they like and silly dancing football Gronk is fun to watch.

Unless it's all a misdirect and it's someone I'd never expect like Howie Long. LMAO"
books,fgps6c2,t1_fgprnpc,1581010963.0,I think some of that desire to read mostly male characters is because I had(have) an annoying younger sister and mostly didn't have male role models around. I'd read The Once and Future King by TH White and imagine myself as Arthur. As I got older it evolved to wanting to be a knight of the round table or member of the merry men instead of the main character but in the beginning I wanted to be the center of the story.
books,fgprat3,t3_ezvkvu,1581010476.0,"I (middle-aged white male) prefer to read books with characters that don't look like me, as I don't know what it is like to be someone other than myself. When I was younger (childhood through teens) I only read books with boys, preferably that looked like me (bonus if they looked like me and had my first name), because it helped me to imagine myself in the adventure/book."

I was excited to see him in Spider-Man: Homecoming as Aaron Davis because my mind conjured thoughts of him as the Prowler, the introduction of Miles, etc... But I don't know that he has the time or desire to do that, he's able to create his own projects these days and I'm sure that's his focus.
