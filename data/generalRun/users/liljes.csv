nintendo,feeodf1,t3_eolmuw,1579037838.0,I think it seems unlikely to me because Nintendo and Valve have no and have never had any working relationship I can think of. At least they have been working with Square since the 80’s and Final Fantasy even started on NES. Nintendo has been working with Atlas for years and at least they actually have some sort of Persona game on 3DS and it’s a big cultural thing in Japan. Chell is just way too random and makes no sense whatsoever. No ties. Even imagining Chell getting revealed sounds like a joke to me along the lines of Goku.
cringe,fedm863,t1_fedlgq3,1579014967.0,I guess but I find it kind of funny and endearing honestly. Maybe I’m just cringey too lol.

todayilearned,fdz7dl1,t3_encb8o,1578787413.0,Honestly smoking that much weed every day and being permanently stoned like that does not sound fun to me at all. My throat would be constantly clogged and I would be in a constant state of exhaustion. Makes me wonder if he’s running from something?
AskReddit,fdqzxa3,t3_emqd57,1578677646.0,"Nintendo. Been playing their games since I was 4 years old and have had so many incredible experiences because of them. There have of course been disappointments throughout the years but it has always been balanced with stellar games every generation, and they just keep me coming back. I never miss a Nintendo console launch and I buy every major game they put out."
