“Kobe Bryant died 23 years too late today. He got away with rape because all the Hollywood liberals who attack comedy enjoy rooting for the Lakers more than they dislike rape. Big ups to the hero who forgot to gas up his chopper. I hate the Lakers. What a great day! #Fuckthelakers

— Ari Shaffir (@AriShaffir) January 26, 2020”

He also posted a video of himself on Instagram celebrating the crash. People rightly were upset because Bryant’s 13 year old daughter died. Also on board were: a mother, father, and one of their daughters. So now three children lost their sister and their parents.

I saw jokes including “Black Mamba Down” that didnt make me laugh, but it’s easy to see the attempt at humour. So I’m not the least bit upset with those people. Ari in contrast was simply being mean spirited."

A comedian that I follow posted “Black Mamba Down”. Which I didn’t laugh at, but is at least an attempt at humour. He’ll have no issues in L.A."
PeopleFuckingDying,ffs40lo,t1_ffs3g42,1580172583.0,"Basically. It’s another room you build outside the front of the house. So the actual front door of the house is inside that room. Dunno if I explained that very well. 

I’ve never been in a mud room that wasn’t carpeted. But it’s also extremely thin carpet on top of concrete so it’s pretty easy to clean. And yeah they’re very rugged. Because you’re not meant to hang out there, you just pass through."
PeopleFuckingDying,ffrv7h6,t1_ffrcypf,1580166583.0,It’s a mud room not a living room. It’s meant for people to come in with muddy/ snowy footwear. It’s also not heated so the snow wouldn’t melt.

Eyebleach,ffq7o7o,t1_ffq7krb,1580124800.0,Well not snow and cat specifically. But it’s for people to come in with snowy/muddy footwear. It’s not a room to hangout or entertain company.

worldnews,fdivagy,t1_fdirca7,1578451831.0,"Both Pence and Pompeo believe that starting a larger war in the Middle East, will allow the Jews to finally retake the holy land and will bring about the end times. 

They don’t think that metaphorically. 

That’s why Pompeo has been pushing since he got there for striking at Iran and starting a war. Evangelical christians in the U.S. see this as an opportunity, and Trump as god’s imperfect messenger to bring about the rapture.

Pence and Pompeo both believe that literally to be true. These are not stable people."

At the time, Patricia M. Byrne, the U.S. representative in the host country committee, said the United States “reserves to us … the right to bar the entry of those who represent a threat to our security.”
