AskDocs,ff7arcf,t1_ff6x4bk,1579644875.0,It’s the group plan with work.  It’s not the best but I don’t have many options.  I can’t afford individual coverage
AskDocs,ff6dp8f,t1_ff66rfr,1579624952.0,"Right, and that’s you.  That doesn’t mean it’s that simple for everyone.  I have insurance that comes with high copays, high deductibles, and high premiums.  It’s a lot for my income.  So when things come up I always have to consider - is this life or limb ? Can I go to a walk in clinic instead? Can I wait to get in with my PCP?   

That’s just how it is for many Americans."
Frugal,ff5rxg1,t1_ff50mw0,1579607912.0,Just with soap and water?

AskDocs,ff48867,t1_ff2d2wf,1579557673.0,Fact.   We have to decide is it worth thousands of dollars of debt or can I wait a day or two until my primary can squeeze me in?? Not everyone understands this struggle.
AskDocs,ff47twa,t1_ff3zjbm,1579557428.0,Absolutely.  And the people that don’t think it’s a priority don’t ever have to stop and consider between getting medical help immediately or waiting due to cost.
AskDocs,ff47oqp,t1_ff3gwyx,1579557342.0,"When you get the bill, ask for an itemized version.  Then get on the website for the hospital and seek out the forms for financial aid.  They are typically straightforward and ask for proof of income.  It could save you thousands."
answers,ff477sx,t3_ere0de,1579557052.0,"Should be fine.  I do this routinely.  In fact, at the moment I have chicken thighs on my counter and they’ve been defrosting since last night.  

Smell it and go from there"
ADHD,ff44dhk,t1_ff2pomw,1579555272.0,It really is.   I’ll order things and not even remember until they arrive and I open them.
quityourbullshit,fez23jl,t1_fez0x82,1579453130.0,Well... TIL.   thank you !
quityourbullshit,feynb8m,t1_fey7a90,1579447906.0,"Right, but they would airlift or transport by ambulance to the nearest facility with these services available if the baby is still living."

LibraryScience,fejj3ei,t3_elvgb3,1579176424.0,"Hi! I am a teacher working on my Masters and I couldn’t decide what to focus on either.  I am currently interested in school librarianship but in the future I may want to go the public route.  

My advisor said I could just work toward both because many classes overlap and in total it added 2 classes to my courseload.  When I graduate I’ll be certified for both. 

I think you should just talk to your advisor and see if that option is available to you.  No need to pigeonhole yourself in one area if you’re interested in two!"
LibraryScience,fejiyls,t3_eo5vsq,1579176273.0,Hi! I am going online through NCCU in North Carolina.  ECU also offers an online program.

currentlyreading,feeoa2o,t1_feegya3,1579037782.0,This is such a good idea I think I may do that. I also like listening to audiobook so that could help push it along
currentlyreading,fe2wmls,t1_fe1zpir,1578843681.0,I really am loving it so far.   It’s hard to put down
AskReddit,fdsuu5h,t1_fdrfck4,1578708230.0,I can’t believe it.  I just took mine down today and went to dig it out of the recycling to confirm that it’s handwritten.  Amazing
AskReddit,fdsto2e,t1_fdqzilq,1578707799.0,"I love this company.   When the filter on my fish tank went out I called them.  A real person answered on the first ring and sent me a replacement filter - no questions asked.  This was 6 months after I purchased it.  
Another time I received my cat food order and a couple of the cans busted during transit.  They sent me an entire new case. 
Great company.  I recommend them every chance I get"
AskReddit,fdn9q8k,t1_fdmg5w0,1578581004.0,Well...... I’m embarrassed at how long I’ve believed that one

AskReddit,fdm26bk,t1_fdl348a,1578538030.0,"Same in NC.  I teach in elementary and I know it follows the kid to MS and I assume beyond.  After that, I don’t know but the shit that’s in those folders are interesting."
konmari,fd6cuft,t3_eiry8q,1578189024.0,I just got a bunch of new journaling stuff and was looking for a container.  My husband handed me an old tackle box and I love it.  It’s perfect
bulletjournal,fd69rka,t1_fd61kk3,1578187694.0,"That is so true.  This year I made a list of about 60 books I am interested in, then I sat and annotated which were on Libby so I can get others while I sit on the waiting lists."

aww,fck6y7l,t3_ehldvi,1577718313.0,This is amazing work and so kind of you to do.  My heart is bursting just thinking about how much this will mean to that parent.  And that you did it for no other reason than to do something nice for a stranger gives me such hope for humanity.  You are a good human.
bujo,fcatp3y,t1_fcahv1d,1577576410.0,Ok.  That makes sense.  Thank you !

Those gifts show that you are an incredibly generous and thoughtful person.   Your reaction shows that you are sensitive and kind.  

He doesn’t deserve a decent person like yourself."
