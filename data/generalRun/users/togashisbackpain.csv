anime,fgmg7nr,t1_fgmfasd,1580923901.0,"Well, main character is an orphan who grew up without the warmth and love of a father and mother ( he is a lot more than that but that is one of his defining treats) and up until this point, we as the audience have witnessed that longing of his for having bonds. A little before this scene, we see his mum’s and dad’s flashbacks and their ultimate sacrifice for the future of their village and their son. Here, we see mc meeting his mum for the very first time in his life ( he didnt even know what she looked like before), ofc she is basically a ghost and they get to say how much they love each other and say their farewells. This is the longest he has been with his mum and will ever be."

Cmon man, this is like saying listening a song you like dozens of times is stupid. There is not a limit to see a movie that is actually good. To me it is 5 or 6 at most before i burn out, but there is nothing stupid about being able to do it more.

I think you simply lack passion for movies compared to some."

whitepeoplegifs,fgh0dxd,t1_fggxrc1,1580773706.0,"You sure you actually know what super average means ? For them to be considered super average, most girls around must have their looks. Even if you have very high standarts and both dont meet them, it doesnt change the fact that they are at least above average looking.

Where do you live ? who do you hang out with ? Send me a ticket please. I want to be a part of that average looking community :)"
OldSchoolCool,fgguqz8,t1_fggralx,1580770008.0,"My point is being a same part of the continuity doesnt mean you are actually playing the exact same thing. Deniro’s and Brando’s Vito had big differences as well. Character is the same character, but what translates to the screen is not. In that way, it is Similar to watching two different interpretations of 1 character.

I understand your point. I just cant exactly grasp what we are supposed to call it if Joaquin wins it as well. They are both playing the Joker. Not the joker and the jokerer, just the joker, the iconic batman villain. I dont think it should matter that much what continuity they belong to."
OldSchoolCool,fggr1rx,t1_fgg38jr,1580767659.0,"I mean , ofc they are the same character, but deniro played a much younger vito with a very different mindset and personality. I would say it is not as far as from playing two different jokers as you make it sound to be."
anime,fggj8vx,t1_fgg3oyq,1580763016.0,"The thing is, most of the narration in that arc actually adds an extra layer to the characters’ mindsets and the complexity of the situation or even the most trivial things in ways you can not convey visually. The first that comes to my mind is the fucking elevator in the palace,  there is no telling what it does and why it was made to be that way visually. Togashi actually thought some backstory to the elevator and gave us all that complex info. If you ask me, it wasnt much needed but i seriously cant grasp how it can be called lazy writing when it is actually the complete opposite. 

I wont deny narration was too on the nose at times, but when it wasnt. it was very apparent the guy really thought all of it thoroughly. If that is lazy writing or taking shortcuts, i welcome it with open arms."
anime,fgghjlk,t1_fgfynxn,1580762002.0,"Well even though they differ vastly due to different set of abilities and circumstances, i have to say there is a pattern to most of big HxH fights. 

Kite vs Pitou, Gon vs Pitou, Meruem vs Netero, Hisoka vs Gotoh, Gon vs Hanzo, even Kurapika vs Uvogin, Leorio vs Ging, Cheetu vs Morel, Hagya vs Morel are the first that comes to mind. All of these fights are actually very one sided. No matter how awesomely the loser performs, it was as if the winner was already decided even before it began. In hxh, it is a rare sight to see a fight that could go either way. It is almost never a close call. You can add Hisoka’s fight with a certain someone in the manga. 

More interestingly, fights like Bomber vs Gon and twins vs Killua are actually very one sided as well, but unlike the rest, these ones end in utter defeat of the ones that are dominating. 

I am not stating this as a counter argument to you. It is just an interesting pattern to me to me and wanted to share it."

HunterXHunter,ffhqpz2,t1_ffhgjbz,1579948864.0,"Made in abyss. Season 1 has a sequel in the form of a movie that came out this year, so time to watch it if you have not already. Adventure, action, mystery, world building and mind fuckery, everything you are looking for. 

Fate/zero. Mad anime with mad animation. It is actually a prequel to fate stay night, but zero is hands down masterful, while stay night is, a lesser anime, so i especially suggest watching zero first.

Well, try not compare anything you watch to HxH. That will also help :)

Edit: Also Haikyuu. That show is Fire !"
