Det finns medicinska konsekvenser av backhoppning också. Låt oss plåstra om folk som ramlar dit, och sen är vi klara. Behövs inga poliser eller domare i denna ekvation. Det är slöseri, och förstör folks liv.

I was so happy with my last mag purchase that I didnt really pay attention... Just BB-pollution and big smiles XD 

But I digress - I always cram my mags and it seems to work fine. Maybe I have ""broken them in"" by simply stressing the spring, unknowingly.

Can any techie confirm?"
mildlyinteresting,fdtxvbu,t1_fdtv0dy,1578724015.0,"Not necessarily true. 

A greenhouse is covered in glass, which isolates decently. And these kinds of setups are filled with electronics and high power lights that produce tons of excessive heat. This is nice because you want a tropical environment, but it almost always needs to be regulated since a greenhouse is setup to produce heat in relative excess compared to the climate on the outside. Sure, they must have extra emergency heating for blizzards and extreme weather, but it looks like this climate offers quite a lot of snow, so they must have expected it and built, isolated and equipped their greenhouse accordingly.

Thus, the computer may indeed find it is time to roll up the curtains for a little while. Even though snow is visible."
airsoft,fdptw6c,t1_fdot6ey,1578640298.0,"Oh, so it IS about design and perceived area of use! A gun does not compare to a wrench or hammer after all, because its an evil killing machine - even when shooting plastic?

I use *toy* guns precisely because of what you just said. Now go ahead and delete your comment, moron.

Oh - and good night/morning america! This thread is going to be my all time best screen shot on reddit, pure gold.

Edit: I mean how are you that stupid that you manage to ruin the arguments of both your fellow gun lovers *and* airsofters in a single comment trying to defend them? The intellectual incompetence here is staggering."
airsoft,fdo32jg,t1_fdnut69,1578597992.0,"And I dont like the ""odds"". What's not to get?

I just dont think this is very advanced. And I say this as someone who also compensates because of general safety restrictions in society. I ignore most of your points because they fail to hit. I've said since the start that the sentence above is where our opinions  branch.

And you bring up me not becoming a politician. Dont worry, though I find your approach strangly authoritarian. I dont belong to the camp that is prone to resort to the victim card, but lets at least acknowledge that - I - never insulted your educational level or maturity.

May just skip that beer after all."
airsoft,fdns55p,t1_fdnqp7l,1578591734.0,"I'm sorry but it's not ""odds"" to me. Its disgustingly stupid, is what it is. And for what? The sweet sensation of cleaning a gun? We dont value life the same way, simple as that. I really do think that you should have your ""privacy insulted"" by having to rent a gun and shooting it while supervised.

Too bad. We may agree on other stuff.

Edit: And yes, hunting should be strictly commercial and heavily regulated. No guns."
airsoft,fdnmloi,t1_fdnh5ug,1578588942.0,"Well, no. You would be at risk of getting shot by disillusioned teens if you were american. This is also a good point about how the conversation has changed, now that it's been localized.

My point will allways be that no icicle deaths are better than 1 death caused by icicles. Or guns for that matter. I engage in military simulations to enhance my experience of life. This is a very ""pro-life"" (wink) stance in general, I really am a smelly hippie and proud of it. Airsoft can still kill me, I could trip inside a ruin and pierce my head on a rebar or something. But at least I dont pose a lethal risk to my friends.

At this point I also want to state that I am fiercly liberal, as liberal as my various other principles will allow. I firmly believe each of us should be the masters of our own health. I want to legalize suicide - thats not why i brought up the point about stable people falling apart unexpectedly. I just dont want guns in the hands of unsupervised mentally unstable people. If you really want to throw in the towel you will have to find some way that does not also pose untold risks to your fellow man.

Edit: Have you considered that you may not like the extremes of the data since it actually reports death?"
airsoft,fdneno8,t1_fdnbn30,1578584188.0,"Oh, UK.

Well, that minimal margin of accidental shootings that still occur in the UK could be prevented. On occasion, apparently rock-solid people wake up feeling sad, too. They cant explain it, but suddenly their brains have lost affection for their family and friends, and everything seems bleak and frightening... And there's the cabinet with a way out.

I dont trust a person, but I do trust people. So i dont think recreational shooting is a problem as long as the range owns the guns. But the pros of private ownership cannot compare to the cons, by my standards."
airsoft,fdna8z4,t1_fdn7g8y,1578581364.0,"It's very interesting how discourse changes people. This may sound like an insult, but it is beyond me that you would even think of asking if I'm talking about sensible cabinet use. Cabinets are a non-argument, since they obviously do not affect the statistics at hand (the people that actually die, or the people that could be saved by guns).

That being said, you really seem like a smart enough guy when looking at your arguments, and I like that you don't shy from discussion, and obviously think critically. I'd have a beer with you any day dude, so please just see this as commentary :) 

You and I will not agree here though, I'm calling it. I think you know what I mean - deep down you and I don't look at guns, or even life, the same way. We'll have to let the beholder decide who's a pussy and who's bloodthristy :)

See you in the field."
airsoft,fdn75al,t1_fdn46rs,1578579127.0,"That ""less dangerous guns"" kill just as well as any other gun, and should be locked away from the public.

This isnt about your right to smoke and get cancer, or go skiing off-pist risking a broken spine. Accidental shootings ALWAYS affect other people than the weilder. Its just not a product that true liberals can promote in a marketplace."

science,fcmjhns,t1_fcm5alh,1577777798.0,"Yup. Expanding on this, on a hypothetical level, you could assume that if we did have nano bots, they would probably maintain the body in such a way that comatose states never occur in the first place.

And if they had wifi and elctrochemical features, they could provide internet to our brains.

I dont really believe in this development though. Our current ""form"" of tech doesnt seem applicable to the microscopic level of things."
