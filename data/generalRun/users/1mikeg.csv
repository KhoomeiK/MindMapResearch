assholedesign,ffqdv46,t1_ffqa2h6,1580131605.0,"I wish I could say you were right, but this series is unfortunately going to be a boon for Netflix. It's going to hook them into the ""daytime TV mom"" demo they've basically been missing for the last ten years.  

And, unfortunately, the Goop brand is fucking huge among ""daytime TV moms"" because it's a fashion and home goods brand first, and a crazy homeopathic holistic bullshit market second. So for every ""this vagina scented oil diffuser balances your chakra"" segment, there's three to four not shit-bird insane segments.  The Netflix show is basically a fully paid gateway ad for Goop.com. And Netflix is cool with that because money is cool."
assholedesign,ffqddoa,t1_ffq7q29,1580131157.0,"It's intentional. Amazon is pushing really hard to place themselves into ""sundries and supplies"" meaning they want you to use Amazon to replace your grocery store, department store, and hardware store. So their big push is to get you to repurchase stuff you've previously purchased and any items that can be considered ""related"" to the item you've purchased.

The part that isn't intentional is how much of a mess their related item tables have become due to third party sellers trying to game the item description."
