This guy has spots, not pure white, so hopefully unaffected.

Wellthatsucks,ffbpzax,t1_ffb3kba,1579777909.0,"Uh, yes it is the vet's responsibility to make sure the animal gets to go to the bathroom when it's been there for hours. Some dogs try to hold it while at the vet, and the owners should be told that too. They should also be told to give the animal a chance to go before getting in the car if they haven't.

Edit: I also have serious concerns about how that e-collar is tied on. It's going to cause armpit rope burns."
