Showerthoughts,ffcyxbl,t3_esrbxk,1579810135.0,"This is true and it also helps with short term memory transitioning into long-term memory. I allowed my students one 8 1/2 x 11“ study cheat sheet for all exams, front AND back. Over the course of three months, my students became very adept at taking notes, drawings, highlighting and other creative ways of retaining the information they needed. I taught a terminology course and words was what it was all about. The biggest problem I had was that they could not believe that this was a real thing I was promising they could do for exams. It is sad that so many students have spent much of their education years having to only memorize everything just before the exam."

CozyPlaces,ff9zyba,t1_ff95vcm,1579725089.0,"I have more stuffed animals than her and have them all over the house. I’m 65 and my husband loves me. My 40 year-old daughter has stuffed animals on her bed. 

Oh I forgot. You’re just someone with no life who has to troll and have jumped on an opportunity to nitpick."
whatisthisthing,ff4f7ih,t1_ff3xbi5,1579562170.0,I have several from the same company. If there’s not enough sunlight on it during the dead of winter then it won’t illuminate or if it does it only illuminates for a very short time. They often can be set to be motion activated only or to turn on when it gets dark. If it is set for the latter it needs a good amount of Sunlight during the day to stay on for any length of time. Unless you are in a sunny state.
Chonkers,ff2algq,t1_ff213u6,1579498803.0,I will soon. Someone’s got to help walk me through the process as I have never posted on Reddit before. I have figured out that once you’ve posted you can’t go back and change things so I better get it right the first time!
Chonkers,ff1t795,t3_er3hoh,1579485635.0,"I have two cats that look similar and my gray one is also slightly chonked. The funny thing is, her name is Cuddlebug!"
Awwducational,ff13jz8,t3_er24nf,1579474841.0,So glad you posted this! Absolutely makes my day seeing this precious Congo line! Someone should add some music because there are some stops and starts to it!
AskReddit,fewzk1p,t3_eqouu3,1579421905.0,I love possums. I like interesting facts about them but kept messing up how many of their teeth were incisors so I decided to help myself remember by making it my username (I’m older than dirt).

povertyfinance,fdtwom0,t3_emylzl,1578723434.0,You can do it! This is the time to get real creative with some of the food that you do have. It can make for fond memories later and some good laughs sometimes.
AskReddit,fds61kg,t1_fdqsg7t,1578695158.0,I’m in my 60s and the Apple Watch is the only watch I’ve been able to wear an entire day. I have a drawer with different watches I’ve tried in the past. I just can’t tolerate any kind of jewelry on my hands or wrists. Their silicone band and a large sized watch puts an ok amount of pressure that does not annoy me into a frazzle. I should mention that I only learned about five years ago that I have a touch of Asperger’s. This probably explains why I can’t tolerate rings on my fingers or earrings.
Instagramreality,fdo27md,t3_em8lz0,1578597536.0,"This is what I see; two pictures probably taken with two different cameras. Second photo has a stronger flash effect on the body making for it to be more washed out. The softer lighting of the first photo with the shadows cast downward and back a bit create a more flattering photo. Lighting can differ from one spot to another spot quickly as one walks through an indoor facility. I doubt J Lo is having her team make adjustments to these photos. They’re posted probably by different photographers Or if the same photographer, the flash was bounced differently.

What I don’t doubt is when things like this get posted so many crawl out from the woodwork to post opinions of how disgusting it is that these subtle changes exist and then assign blame as if experts. How small can a petty stone get?"
