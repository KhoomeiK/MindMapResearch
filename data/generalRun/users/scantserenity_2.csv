amiugly,fee39ip,t3_em8q5z,1579025491.0,You aren't bad looking but your eyes look really empty apart from the smiling pics and that'd the only issue
MandelaEffect,feau6je,t3_enalqy,1578952200.0,Another weird thing that relates to this is I remember shaggy he called him 'grandma' and this was when he had a headscarf.
MandelaEffect,feaszsv,t3_enalqy,1578951935.0,I find this really weird because I was watching this film a week before this post came out and I felt something was off with the film like something was gone

depression,fdc84wp,t3_ekldpn,1578268964.0,Sometimes it can help just asking about them and figuring your own thoughts and they would try to give you support but too much depression might consume them. Try just telling them small thoughts you have but not too much! Hope you feel better soon
depression,fdc7uuz,t3_eklav0,1578268812.0,"Don't be scared! Because even it might seem like there's lots of side effects they probably don't end up happening. I'm on a medicine now and the only symptom was one (overheating)

So if you need medicine I would recommend you to try it and I promise you'll be fine, I hope it can help you"
Anxiety,fdc76or,t3_ekl8xz,1578268440.0,You aren't alone I'm also like you. It can happen anywhere to anyone even when youre in public and it can be embarrassing but it's also good because it can let them know how nervous you are so they don't let you do overwhelming things. It can help stop the shaking when you go outside
Anxiety,fdc6u8x,t3_ekl5fj,1578268251.0,"I also have the same thought process as you! Except the only reason is because when I think it goes it always comes back. If your anxiety goes away I really recommend trying not to focus on it, because your brain is trying to find something wrong when it's good to just accept that you're happy your life isn't anxious! Sometimes it just helps to change the thoughts you have"
mentalhealth,fdbgshs,t3_ekhwxj,1578257217.0,"Hii I'm really sorry you're not well. I also have anxiety so a really good medicine I recommend is fluoxetine (prozac)

The doctors give it you when you have bad anxiety so if you can I would try it. I would really recommend though 'piriton' hayfever medicine because it helps you to sleep and ease your mind

I know it might not help but when you worry about relatives dying sometimes it can make you happier to just live the moment and think how happy you are that they're there. I hope you feel better soon"
mentalhealth,fdbfp39,t3_ekiay3,1578256924.0,"This also happens to me too, so a coping method can be focusing on the conversation and thinking about it after talking and it seems to help. It helps making a worry time to think about it after. The more spare things you do the less you will worry.hope you feel better soon!"
mentalhealth,fdbf4oi,t3_ekioke,1578256782.0,"I understand how you feel and don't be harsh on yourself for having your condition you could never help it and its okay if you didn't grow up when everyone else was because you would eventually. If anyone made fun of you it's because it shows them for who they are

Although you might not believe me you aren't. A burden to anyone and they love you!!"
mentalhealth,fdbe29i,t3_ekin1j,1578256503.0,I understand you probably feel kinda tired of consistently being depended on but at the same time you're for your friend. It's a really kind thing of you to make sure they're okay and remember that when you help them it's making their day better knowing that you can help them
OCD,fdbdkyo,t3_ekh9ik,1578256337.0,I understand you! Sometimes you keep thinking what if on something you wrote and because you can't see you double check it. I really recommend to help this a good idea is to go with the first idea your memory tells you that you did
OCD,fdbdbno,t3_ekhdsp,1578256239.0,Ocd can really make your thoughts disturbed and distorted and this is one of the symptoms I've also had similar thoughts as you. I wouldn't blame yourself for it but rather just trying to tell yourself we can't help it. It's really our heads saying it's our fault but it isn't really
Anxiety,fdbcmxi,t3_ekig3i,1578256043.0,"I think some stay at home because they feel more comfortable in the house than to see a doctor so they say they are fine. A good idea might be a home visit doctor if there's one

It's a good idea to show him that he can get help and medicine if he visits the doctor because it can send you to hospital if stress increases"
Anxiety,fdbbzrk,t3_ekid7n,1578255901.0,"So I used to worry about the future all the time. It drove me to the point where I couldn't concentrate so I spoke to some people about it. They all told me it wasn't true but I didn't believe them

I had it consecutively but one day I got so tired I gave up. It never seemed that easy but the best method was trying to believe there was some hope it would never happen

It's still there but it's improving because of the thought process of letting things go. I started going outside more and focusing better"
Anxiety,fdba54p,t3_eki0gq,1578255383.0,"On ebay there's an icon that looks like the shadow of a person, so you click on it and you should see a sign that says 'purchases'

This link here might help: https://www.ebay.co.uk/help/buying/search-tips/purchase-history?id=4047

Don't worry about it! I'm sure theyll know and be over it all within 2 weeks time. I wish you the best of luck"
Anxiety,fdb7qnn,t3_eki4gg,1578254725.0,"I'm with you sometimes I also find chewing gum stress relief I think it's because of a nerve that you have to have something

I also occasionally try and pick up things to relieve stress like the squish ones. I might look silly but it does seem to help"
depression,fdatudm,t3_ekh0tb,1578250074.0,I think a way that may help is thinking about the theories of the world and how similar life is to the simulated versions. It might help believing in those things. Even though life could be real it may also be a dream. I hope these thing smight help you
depression,fdao1y0,t3_ekgmut,1578248257.0,"Think of the meaning of life it isn't harm its never the answer love. Even if you feel like the worst is happening there can be brighter days when you do something to distract yourself this can help
Don't focus so much on others and concentrate on your wellbeing and colouring may help. I hope you feel better soon"
depression,fdant6k,t3_ekgfgs,1578248155.0," It can help looking into the nearest other cities if theres any but if you can't there's always online therapy/books for help. You can feel free to send me a message anytime. I'm similar to you because  I'm like you in your thinking

 Sometimes it's better to focus on mental health than anything else. So start thinking of ways you can make it better by changing your thought process into something to distract you if it makes sense. I hope things can get better for you"
depression,fdaab84,t3_ekfh64,1578243614.0,"Things will be okay because you have a life to live and you will be happy in the future things might seem like they aren't getting better but they will I promise youre only young so don't lose hope

I hope you feel better soon and you might get suicidal thoughts but I hope that you know you're loved and feel free to message me to talk about it"
depression,fda5qzj,t3_ekf5ye,1578242070.0,"I'm really sorry about you feeling like that maybe you feel this way because a lot of the time there's situations where you can be sad for a long time and it can sometimes be due to past experiences.

 I understand you and it can happen when you never know why. Although it's difficult it can lift your mood going outside more or trying something like reading it's something to focus on, I hope you feel better soon"

depression,fcy225y,t3_ejisvv,1578073709.0,"I understand how hard it is to hide a mask and not cry, stay strong. Even though the days seem tough life goes on and some days there can be ways to swap negative thoughts for good ones as a distraction"
depression,fcy1tff,t3_ejiro1,1578073584.0,"I Sometimes it helps to just change the mindset a little. Although it might feel like things might not change it can help to change your outlook on life and forcing yourself to do things.

I know how hard it us, sometimes it can take a few more weeks to figure yourself out I understand"
depression,fcy1hof,t3_ejikqz,1578073394.0,"I really hope you manage to get better soon. I dont believe depression ever goes away, but it always remains but it can lift by changing your motivation and mindset. I used to go days not going outside because of depression.

A year later I do stay in lots but not as much. I try my best to get out of bed and force myself to go outside"
depression,fcy152s,t3_ejioio,1578073279.0,"I agree with you too, sometimes life just gets you so angry because you can't escape thoughts/feelings. It really helps when you play stress relief games on your phone or device."
aspergers,fcy0nz8,t1_fcxqhzz,1578073112.0,"It can be really difficult to get out I get you! Sometimes the only thing that can get you out is a purpose like a place you have to visit. If its the weekends thats when it happens

Like when you have a break you just start to do nothing all the time so it can make you worse"
aspergers,fcy0fyc,t1_fcxynd6,1578072981.0,"Sorry about your money. Thanks for the reply and I also I agree its tough even just to go to the post office. You get told youre too lazy but its the opposite, I also really dislike the post office. Me too the only way you can get out is if there's a purpose

It can sometimes make you low mood but its all because of avoiding places and motivation lack. I hope you can break your fears someday!"
aspergers,fcy006w,t1_fcxqkrc,1578072751.0,"I get what you mean. Thanks for the response! Sometimes when I dont go out I start to get depressed but it's because of jo motivation because everything you have can be in the house. I understand you, but yeah sometimes it can feel like a prison to get outside.

Sometimes even help can't help you get out."

depression,fcstr8a,t3_eiq8aq,1577924889.0,I understand you. A lot of people are feeling the same way they see couples and they feel alone but don't worry because it's okay! You have yourself and that's the best gift. I'm sure you'll find someone don't worry about that. You are loved remember this!
depression,fcste65,t3_eiq8u7,1577924625.0,"I'm really sorry about what's happening. A good way to stop it is to put something like an elastic band or hairband around your wrist so you can do day to day things but avoiding it too

Instead of scratching your arms try alternatives like scratching the walls, scribbling on paper or letting feelings out. I hope you get better soon!"
depression,fcst1u3,t1_fcsnbzz,1577924384.0,"I'm sure any girl you find would support you no matter what depression you're going through, they would be supportive and still love you! 

You do blend in with society but you can't see it yet, a few people feel the way you do and you aren't the only one

Just be who you are, even when being who you are makes you I quote ""really unhappy"", and despair just be you! Don't let life destroy you!"
depression,fcsj0ij,t1_fcsi9j0,1577917460.0,I definitely understand how difficult it is to stop the thoughts. They can be all different scenarios but what I can suggest is that a positive idea is to think about the times he worried and tell him that he moved on to another and stopped thinking of it. Hope everything goes well for him!
depression,fcsi5g9,t3_eiokam,1577916957.0,I understand why you have this mindset on life. You might not wanna live but I'm sure if you weren't here you would really miss life because there are so many new things every day. I'm sure if you found someone you loved it can lift you and the more time you spend with them you'l be happier. You also have a life to live with others that care about you!
depression,fcshkvx,t3_eiolim,1577916675.0,I do the same as you. I lean on others when my head is a mess and so I push them away and it ends up worrying them. What I will say is the best way is to fake your smile and go for a break say upstairs alone. Sort out your feelings and remember it's okay to let your feelings out as long as you say it because when you keep it in they worry more
depression,fcsheam,t3_eioliv,1577916590.0,Sometimes it helps to just hold your own hand. I'm sure there are times where everyone has felt lonely and wanted a hug. It's a comforting thought to know that someone would hug you if you got along well and I'm sure there are people that would hug you. So don't worry!
depression,fcsh6ol,t3_eiokka,1577916491.0,"Everything's gonna be okay, I know you're having horrible thoughts but I promise there are people that love you.

depression,fcsgrcy,t3_eioigi,1577916296.0,Tell him that I have exactly what he has! I spend my days endless worrying to the point where I also had suicidal thoughts about bad things happening. The way I got rid of it was just thinking to myself 'just let it happen because it isn' t gonna.'' Every fear I had everyone said was a lie so I lived off that. Hope he gets better. Sometimes it helps to distract yourself with hobbies or little things
depression,fcsgft6,t3_eiohhq,1577916160.0,I get what you mean! Everything seems like it could be more better in this world with more distractions to have. They aren't the ones to say if you have depression or not because they haven't had a second of your life. They tell you that because they view the light but there could be more advanced things we could be building
depression,fcsfvrw,t3_eio36o,1577915935.0,"I completely understand it's really difficult to sort your head out you get thoughts you just wish you could never know. I hope you know that everyone wants you here and adores you and things aren't as bad as what you imagine. Take your time with work don't rush, it's important to sort yourself out at home first. Have a certain time for your thoughts"

Someone you love will come I'm sure that once you find someone you can get along with they will live you

You are good looking and the only thing is the sadness in your eyes because you're scared of not finding someone. You look good don't worry I'm being honest

Don't think of yourself as ugly be confident and don't let it consume you. Even the ones that others think are handsome hate themselves too

Everyone does this and don't compare yourself but ignore beauty standards you are good as them"
