sleeptrain,fdj4lpn,t3_ekpt35,1578458298.0,"Yes I had a fussy kid, too.  She hated baths.  Due to my schedule, I was often home alone with her.  What I did was sponge bathe her in pieces, like only one leg, then the next with T shirt and diaper on.  Then put on baby bottoms.  Bathe hands and arms and dry them.  Take off T shirt and bathe body trunk.  Put shirt back on.  Wash face and neck.  Wait awhile and wash hair very quickly while the baby was fully dressed.  It was exhausting but the only way until she was about 10 months.  We started her playing with bath toys and eventually she liked playing with them in the water.  
As for the feedings, I gave my little bundle of joy feedings from an eyedropper when she got fussy.  Also do not pick her up when she gets fussy- I patted her and sang a lot.  It is a miracle that my singing did not make her cry harder.  
Take heart- this too shall pass and then she will be asking you for the lastest million dollar designer sneakers as she enters grade school."
postpartumdepression,fdj32r1,t3_ektnf7,1578457153.0,Sounds like part of your sad feeling is that your partner is not helping you feel good or special.  Having a baby is work and your LO got off to a rocky start with you.  By 3-4 months the baby should start to recognize you.  Also see your doc about anti depressants and someone to talk to so you can get through this bad patch

If my partner were with the baby 24/7 as you say you are, I would feel bad that we do not get enough time together alone as a couple.  Your baby does not need you 24/7.  Your fiance also needs your attention."
