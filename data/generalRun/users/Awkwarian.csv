stopdrinking,ff6rrqe,t1_ff6pp1m,1579633521.0,I'm spending the first part of the day being responsible - getting my tire repaired & working. Then the second part of the day I'm going to a movie & getting dinner!
selfimprovement,ff3i66k,t1_ff37h5p,1579541556.0,"Well I guess I should have explained the social thing better - I was somewhat of a small public figure in the music scene in my city for years, but a couple years back this girl posted some really horrible stuff about me & it spread to the point where I was getting threats from random strangers, so I stopped playing music & haven't been doing well. Last year I had moved to a different city, so I didn't really have to worry about that stuff but now I'm back here & don't feel safe going out to a lot of places here. I'm saving up to move again for good this time, and my routine will be changed in some ways when I move, particularly to make room for more social time."
