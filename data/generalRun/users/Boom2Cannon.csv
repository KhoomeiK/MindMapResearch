Im not even like a die-hard Kobe fan or anything, but go tell that man that his defense doesnt matter. Or Jordan. Or wade. Or any other number of actually elite SGs. 

Yeah, rim protection matters, but it sure as shit doesnt matter if the shooting guard keeps his man in front of him and doesnt let him get to the rim; something that Harden is literally incapable of. 

His technique is embarrassing. He literally opens up defensively and allows the middle of the floor to the players he defends. He doesnt slide his feet worth a shit. 

Theres a reason that he cant, and never will be able to, get his team to a championship, let alone win one. 

Like I said in a previous comment - Id be willing to bet that you think that Trae Young is worth a damn"
NBA2k,fep5t0z,t1_fep49h2,1579312776.0,"You literally are way too young to know what youre talking about. It shows. 

He can average 50/15/15 and it wont mean shit. He will never win a ring. Never. 

Hes MAYBE an average defender. TMac and Drexler were elite offensively AND defensively in their prime. They also didnt need to flop like little pansies to get to the line. They also didnt have the insane turnover numbers harden has. Its disgraceful to the position. 

And if you want to talk stats, we certainly can. We can even look at advanced metrics.  Harden doesnt stack up. He never will not only is he not the best SG in Rockets history, but hes also not even the best shooting guard in the league right now. 

Again, if you think that an all-time great player can only be great offensively, you dont know what the fuck youre talking about. Hes great at only 50% of the game. The other 50% is laughable. Hes lazy as fuck and has never actually impacted a game defensively. 

Yes, Tmac never had any playoff run, but nor has Harden. Spoiler alert: harden wont this year either. However, Tmac became an all-time great in basically 6-7 seasons (injuries). 

Go watch some videos of Drexler. Thats how basketball is played. No pansy double-step back, pump fake, flop shit. His game literally had no weakness. 50% of Hardens game is a weakness; defense."
NBA2k,fep3u50,t1_fep2fho,1579311524.0,"You clearly are not old enough to have ever watched Drexler. And any person that uses stats to justify Harden is a damn joke. 

Mcgradys best four years were undoubtedly better than Hardens best four. Harden is a one-way player that is embarrassing to watch. How he has exploited the ridiculous new-age NBA rules isnt skillful. He would have gotten stomped in yesteryears NBA - hes soft. Regardless of the past, he still cant play defense worth a damn. He could be the best offensive player ever (hes not), but that doesnt mean jack shit if he gets scored on at-will. 

People that legitimately dont understand basketball or what it takes to win are the ones that base a players talent level off of offense and flashy plays. 

Harden will never win a ring. Ever. 100% guaranteed. Hes a defensive liability. He puts up gaudy offensive numbers in the regular season, yet he routinely gets shut-down in the playoffs; when players actually D up. Hes nothing more than a volume shooter."

This doesnt even come down to an eminent domain argument. 

There are 49 other states to build. There are millions of square acres they can build elsewhere. 

Wanna know why Apple decided to pay the property owner that amount?  Because they literally decided that piece of land was WORTH THAT. This is no different than the owner of the land. He/she decided it was WORTH THAT. They also could have chosen to not sell it at all. They didnt fucking force Apple to pay. Apple wasnt forced to build there.

Lets assume that a pencil costs $1 to produce. If I sell that pencil, and even thousands of others for $1.10, Ill likely lose money after you factor in overhead.

I’m not even like a die-hard Kobe fan or anything, but go tell that man that his defense doesn’t matter. Or Jordan. Or wade. Or any other number of actually elite SGs. 

Yeah, rim protection matters, but it sure as shit doesn’t matter if the shooting guard keeps his man in front of him and doesn’t let him get to the rim; something that Harden is literally incapable of. 

His technique is embarrassing. He literally opens up defensively and allows the middle of the floor to the players he defends. He doesn’t slide his feet worth a shit. 

There’s a reason that he can’t, and never will be able to, get his team to a championship, let alone win one. 

Like I said in a previous comment - I’d be willing to bet that you think that Trae Young is worth a damn"
NBA2k,fep5t0z,t1_fep49h2,1579312776.0,"You literally are way too young to know what you’re talking about. It shows. 

He can average 50/15/15 and it won’t mean shit. He will never win a ring. Never. 

He’s MAYBE an average defender. TMac and Drexler were elite offensively AND defensively in their prime. They also didn’t need to flop like little pansies to get to the line. They also didn’t have the insane turnover numbers harden has. It’s disgraceful to the position. 

And if you want to talk stats, we certainly can. We can even look at advanced metrics.  Harden doesn’t stack up. He never will not only is he not the best SG in Rockets history, but he’s also not even the best shooting guard in the league right now. 

Again, if you think that an all-time great player can only be great offensively, you don’t know what the fuck you’re talking about. He’s great at only 50% of the game. The other 50% is laughable. He’s lazy as fuck and has never actually impacted a game defensively. 

Yes, Tmac never had any playoff run, but nor has Harden. Spoiler alert: harden won’t this year either. However, Tmac became an all-time great in basically 6-7 seasons (injuries). 

Go watch some videos of Drexler. That’s how basketball is played. No pansy double-step back, pump fake, flop shit. His game literally had no weakness. 50% of Hardens game is a weakness; defense."
NBA2k,fep3u50,t1_fep2fho,1579311524.0,"You clearly are not old enough to have ever watched Drexler. And any person that uses stats to justify Harden is a damn joke. 

Mcgrady’s best four years were undoubtedly better than Hardens best four. Harden is a one-way player that is embarrassing to watch. How he has exploited the ridiculous new-age NBA rules isn’t skillful. He would have gotten stomped in yesteryears NBA - he’s soft. Regardless of the past, he still can’t play defense worth a damn. He could be the best offensive player ever (he’s not), but that doesn’t mean jack shit if he gets scored on at-will. 

People that legitimately don’t understand basketball or what it takes to win are the ones that base a players talent level off of offense and flashy plays. 

Harden will never win a ring. Ever. 100% guaranteed. He’s a defensive liability. He puts up gaudy offensive numbers in the regular season, yet he routinely gets shut-down in the playoffs; when players actually D up. He’s nothing more than a volume shooter."

Let’s assume that a pencil costs $1 to produce. If I sell that pencil, and even thousands of others for $1.10, I’ll likely lose money after you factor in overhead.
