MurderedByWords,ffa8sp5,t3_eseax0,1579730109.0,"I understand the point being made, but the analogy is wildly inaccurate. Yes, a portion of your 401k will be in equities, but your going to have fixed income, as well as alternative investments within it as well. The whole point of diversifying the portfolio stems from the idea that we cannot accurately and consistently predict or beat the market."

clevercomebacks,fde28oa,t3_ekuf73,1578329540.0,"I will preface this question with the fact that I understand entirely that these powers do not fall under the executive branch. Do you believe that should we suffer an attack, that we as a country should not defend ourselves as well as send a message that we as a country are not to be taken lightly? If not, how would responding to an attack with diplomatic avenues ONLY and not in addition to military reaction, not portray us as an ineffective and weak country?

Edit: I am not stating my personal opinion, I am purely asking to understand the point of view of those that do not believe reactionary military force is ever a positive course of action. I do not understand why you would downvote a question."
