Maybe it's just me, since I replaced some boards on *my* deck two years ago and had a very similar effect."

He also somewhat regrets moving that far because he knows I wouldn't follow him but would want to hire me without a second thought."
personalfinance,ff5u147,t1_ff3hfo7,1579610218.0,"In my company the accoutants are underpaid and working 60-80 hour weeks. Every time one leaves the CFO/controller etc says ""I wish we could figure out why they are leaving!"" I was actually in a meeting with them once when they said something like that and it was really hard for me to not roll my eyes so hard they could hear it.

Then when I was in the lunch room a couple days later, one of the accountants who hasn't quit (yet) was telling people that she was picking up her lunch and saw one of the people who had just quit. She got a pay raise at the new company, never works past 6pm (and never works past 5 more than once a week), and the company was letting them all off early the following Friday to take the entire department to a Xavier game."

I've got a baby due in 5 weeks and I'm way more financially secure now than I was before we were pregnant. If things really got dire, my wife could cut back on her unpaid time early."
personalfinance,ff5tj2k,t1_ff46qoh,1579609684.0,"My fantasy every morning on the drive into work is that they tell me I have to work over my paternity leave (which isn't company-provided, btw, I have to blow all my vacation and sick time), or if my wife goes into labor early they realize they haven't prepared for me leaving (even though I keep telling them they need to) so they try and get me to take my computer to the hospital. Then instead of saying ""yes"" one more time I finally say ""no thanks. You can fire me if you don't like it."" Then I use my vacation payout to take the time off I was already going to take anyway, and by the time that is up unemployment has kicked in, and I get to spend the day with my new kid and spend the evening/nap time applying for new jobs until I find one that realizes it's the year 2020 and dads don't want to miss time with their family to work for free with no path for promotion."
personalfinance,ff5tdin,t1_ff3vu6c,1579609519.0,"I dunno, I'm not far from doing this myself. I've already got funds saved up to cover my wife being off, and I need a job that respects the fact that I'd like to see my family every now and then, but I don't have enough hours left in the day after work to actually apply.

I also know that my skills are highly marketable and my current job title garners at least $20k more than what I'm currently making, so a couple weeks or months with only 1 income would be made up for pretty quickly."
personalfinance,ff5sb44,t1_ff4bp1j,1579608349.0,"So I'm currently looking for a new job because of the ridiculous expectations my company is putting on me. If my last manager were still here, I would grin and bear it because I would know he would be fighting for me (he actually got me a *huge* raise *and* a bonus right before he left), but my current manager (who, in fairness, just hasn't been here long enough to realize these ridiculous requirements are brand new to me) doesn't really care, and I know I'm not going to get any support from him.

So yes, there could be factors beyond a manager's control, but a great manager can still work with that."

I mean, my house is full of LEDs, but if global warming didn't exist and I didn't care about my energy bill (and they were still legal) I'd be nothing but incandescents.

The weird part to me, isn't that he's complaining about non-incandescents, so much as people care enough about the issue that he constantly uses it as a bragging point. Like with everything else going on in the world who the heck cares?! Maybe he's just appealing to the ICE/coal-rolling crowd? (A group which I REALLY don't understand... I'm usually good at arguing for the other side but I can't even get started on that one)."
