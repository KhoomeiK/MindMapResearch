PlantGoths,fefqgg9,t1_feeqb8l,1579062282.0,I got it at Michaels a couple years ago around Halloween! One of my friends found some this past Halloween as well.
plantclinic,fe8t78j,t1_fe8szlq,1578930557.0,Yeah I have heard takes up to a month for dumb cane to get some roots. Thanks for the confirmation. Just don’t want to kill my last cutting!
succulents,fe8lgra,t1_fe8a8m3,1578927534.0,"They probably need more water than that. Usually in summer I water my succulents once a week. It allows the soil to dry out so the roots are not consistently wet. In winter i typically water every other week. You just don’t want your soil wet all the time. With my fountain I have a plastic bucket buried in the soil, so all the water is falling into that and not touching the soil my plants are in!"
succulents,fe65kjj,t1_fe63q8i,1578882287.0,Yeah it will cause you plants roots to get root rot. They don’t like soggy roots!
plantclinic,fe615ir,t1_fe60xqb,1578879463.0,Fingers crossed! Only piece left from my root rot salvage. All the ones placed in soil did not root. Hoping to have success with water propagation!

succulents,fe5fxes,t1_fe5f3my,1578868955.0,Found the water feature at my local thrift store! Was happy with the color on it as well.
succulents,fe5f09a,t1_fe5exkv,1578868657.0,Thank you :)
succulents,fe5dsna,t1_fe5db19,1578868201.0,Yep it goes into a little container under the rocks!
rootporn,fdtwkef,t1_fdtb7v0,1578723375.0,You don’t want to know
airplants,fdpmy3e,t3_emcbsg,1578633229.0,Wish I had that kind of space! I am pretty much maxed out at my place.

barkour,fdivmtx,t1_fdidfa1,1578452057.0,"I have one as well, but he is mixed with a papillon! He’s a little one eyed crackhead, but still the best dog ever. He can really hang with me on some of my longer hikes!"
PlantGoths,fde5inb,t1_fddvsmk,1578331634.0,Glad I could provide you with a new wallpaper and some joy haha! One of my favorite planters I have.
succulents,fde56d5,t1_fde4m0n,1578331421.0,Yep! Just one corner in my back yard!
PlantIdentification,fddqscw,t1_fdd6oxt,1578321512.0,"Oh alright! I will leave it in there for now, and if it starts looking weird I will just move some place else!"
PlantIdentification,fdd16iy,t1_fdcn6iq,1578290725.0,"Thanks! Was reading up on them some. My plan was to put it above my shower which gets a lot of diffused light, but worried since it goes dormant in winter. I won’t water it often, but worried the humidity might mess with it. Any thoughts?!"
plantID,fdct3rd,t1_fdcotd1,1578283551.0,"Happy I stumbled upon this guy at the nursery!
Thank you!!!"
PlantIdentification,fdcldql,t1_fdcjyv0,1578277786.0,Thank you!! Time to do some research on this bad boy!
PlantIdentification,fdclbyj,t1_fdcjtjv,1578277751.0,Thank you so much!!!
plants,fdce54a,t1_fdc48y4,1578272682.0,"Exactly as listed below. Just have a clean break where it narrows. Let it dry up for a day or so, and stick on some soil. Easy to propagate! That small green plastic pot in the picture I have a couple rooting."
PlantGoths,fdapbfo,t1_fdakrvm,1578248638.0,Alway tossing random stuff in my planters!
PlantGoths,fdaogfl,t1_fdak7d6,1578248417.0,"That pot was basically my bucket of my propagation, accidental knockoffs over the past year! They had all finally established some solid roots and are taking off.

The pot is 15 inches wide*"
plants,fdans6z,t1_fdakz2e,1578248142.0,I had moved it to this spot about two months ago. Before it was getting more sunlight. This new spot only gets direct light is during sunrise. Seems to be a lot happier.
plants,fcm3bb9,t1_fclfotd,1577763136.0,I actually just got it for Christmas from my mom. It also has a mechanism under so it can spin around in a circle.
cactus,fbuuvqa,t1_fbut9as,1577120737.0,Well at least the dragon fruit cleared the cactus ID lol. I swear whenever I am certain it’s a cactus it a euphorbia. Thanks for the correction though.
