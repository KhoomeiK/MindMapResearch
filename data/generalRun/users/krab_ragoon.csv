AskReddit,ffdimu2,t3_esse9d,1579821662.0,I was swimming in the ocean when I was around 13. I was like 50 feet out and just having the time of my life looking at fish and such. On the shore I saw this kid approaching the water with his mother where he just sat at the edge for like 10 minutes. He kept on looking my way but I pretended not to notice as I was super nervous around strangers and hated new contact. After a while he and his mother got up and started to leave and I saw that he only had 1 arm. I felt so bad because i thought that he was nervous to approach me and maybe he thought that I wouldn't like him. I really dont know what I was thinking but after that I always went out of my way to be friendly to people and meet them.
