fireemblem,ff2ytl4,t1_ff2rfrr,1579528957.0,"Well i mean basically all their dads are responsible for what happened to Edelgard, the noble ones obviously. Someone on another thread summed up the Black Eagles really well, the over arching theme of CF is the right use of power, from Edelgard's obvious arch, to Hubert's shadows, Ferdinand and the proper noble, Linhardt with pacifistism and inaction, Caspar with the role of violence, Petra and her internal conflict on how to lead and Dorothea and the role of the oppressed"
todayilearned,ff2k6bk,t1_ff2k1nm,1579509872.0,"I dont follow sorry. AIDS is so unfortunately political because it seems a large portion of the population feels its a disease only undesirables get, yet at the same time in the 80s there just wasnt the research there is today, so its hard to judge actions in the 80s off the knowledge we have today. People were losing jobs over HIV status and the general population along with the medical community were not fully aware of transmission"
todayilearned,ff2iie3,t1_ff2hxgv,1579507634.0,I really didnt mean that as a Foundation vs Dune post just that foundation is really not visual at all when you think back especially compared to other scifi of its era like Dune
todayilearned,ff2hiza,t1_ff2gfkj,1579506389.0,"So the transmission rate from an HIV infected transfusion is higher than 90%, it wasnt until the mid 80s that they were even able to properly screen the blood supply.  It would not have been heartless advice to tell someone to keep quiet in thr 80s that they were HIV positive as its always been a disease wrapped in politics.  People were being denied care and benefits over HIV status"
todayilearned,ff2h3do,t1_ff2g1pz,1579505855.0,"I mean this as no disrespect towards Asimov but in some ways it shows in his books where almost everything can be just visualized as people talking in a room. Foundation is a lot of talking in the future, its not Dune where the settings are vivid and characters in themself."

smashbros,fexfv8a,t3_equ3fx,1579430307.0,"I dont have a full list but my dream character for the last slot was either the Knight or Hornet from Hollow Knight. I think both would naturally fit in smash and pretty have fun unique movesets already made up. I also would love Waluigi, hes a meme but at the same time smash is the type of game where his meme-y nature would be fun. It would be weird moves made from scratch"
OldSchoolCool,fejkvin,t1_fei8n1q,1579178318.0,Not saying arguing that it was ethically correct but surviving children could have been used to by royalists in order to rally support or used later to try and retake the thrown and reinstate the Imperial state. Killing the kids insured there was no obvious rival to the Bolsheviks from the old regime
fireemblem,fczfysp,t1_fcz8dp3,1578100400.0,"It might be easier to list the non garbage nobles. I cant think of any adult nobles in the Empire who arent horrible, Rodrique for the kingdom is a good guy despite what Felix thinks, and not that we ever see Holst but he seems okay. So yeah crests are to blame lol. I feel like even if you dont agree with Edelgard you have to admit she is probably one of the best characters fire emblem has ever had for a lord, at least one of the most interesting"
fireemblem,fczbcr8,t1_fcyek5r,1578097491.0,"I feel VW needed an Almyran plot. If this makes sense i feel like his fight against racism and for gobalism is too easy to support. I feel like i played VW with no conflict with Claude's ideals, he feels too right. I wish there was some sort of conflict with Almyra that caused a reckoning and made Claude make hard choices. I would want him to fight for a more inclusive future and for it to feel earned. For him to bring people together on screen and not just off screen"
