> She was screened for PPD by her OB and her OB believes she doesn't have it, 

When was she screened? At one week post birth? At two weeks? Has she been screened since then? First of all, a lot of the things you wrote about your wife feeling overwhelmed, constantly tired, run-down, etc. can be symptoms of PPD. Also, keep in mind, PPD can often be difficult to diagnose. “Screening” for PPD only means the woman is asked questions...and many times, a woman will not answer the questions honestly, for fear of how it makes her look. For example, a question such as, “Do you feel a lack of affection or love towards your baby?” Well, even if a mother does feel this, many women would answer no, because they feel like if she answers yes, it means she is a monster and a terrible mother. “Do you feel feelings of resentment towards your baby?” “Do you ever have thoughts of harming your baby?” Etc.

Edit: I mean, you can downvote me, but using the elbow to cover your face/eyes is a common fear reaction in kids and adults alike. The kid was expecting to be hit by a car, so he was protecting his face/head. Not dabbing."
