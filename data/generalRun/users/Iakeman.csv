That’s a strange question. Have you *seen* the Venezuela episode?"
TheGoodPlace,fdsf21e,t1_fdsa4lt,1578701253.0,"Every major religion believes that life is suffering, right? In the Abrahamic faiths we suffer on Earth until we go to the afterlife, if we’ve been good. Dharmic religions believe in samsara, the wheel of life, literally translated as suffering. Souls forced to live and die over and over until they can finally break free and ascend. Truly evil people would be unable to ever break the cycle. They even said that the difficulty of the test would depend on your behavior in your previous life. Perhaps Hitler would be forced into a loop in that bunker, watching his empire crumble around him, killing his wife, dog, and taking his own life, simply to wake up again in the same situation. Imagine that for eternity.

Hitler caused the suffering of millions of people. Let’s say 12 million—the 6 million figure doesn’t count the other populations he murdered, nor does it take into account the people who suffered acutely under his reign but escaped with their lives. An argument could be made that he deserves at least concentration camp level torture for an equivalent value of suffering as he inflicted upon the world. But let’s do the math. 12 million times a generous average lifespan of 80 years is just shy of 1 billion years. A mind-bogglingly long time, literally incomprehensible to humans, who are by nature very bad at comprehending vast distances and lengths of time. But a billion years is still *nothing* compared to *eternity*. And that’s what hell is—excruciating, sadistic physical torture for long after the universe has died of entropy. No one deserves that."
