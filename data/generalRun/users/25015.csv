China_Flu,ffq0tfk,t1_ffpphhv,1580114214.0,Because the WHO has not recommended that international travel should be halted at this stage.
news,ffljsm5,t3_etyli6,1580040441.0,"The patient is not being “treated by a robot” - he has doctors using a camera and microphone, which happen to be on wheels. The human doctors and nurses are treating him entirely conventionally."
medicine,ffhw06n,t1_fff9399,1579956439.0,Well the proper name would be ARS but that seems a bit unfortunate. I think NARS - Novel Asian Respiratory Syndrome would be ideal. Maybe we can do some kind of Reddit vote.
medicine,ffhvttt,t1_ffh616d,1579956221.0,The two coronavirus precedents are SARS and MERS. They had/have a mortality of up to 10% across the population and more in vulnerable groups. That’s obviously way closer to Ebola than rhinoviruses. It seems like there are some extreme measures in China too based on some photos I saw (patients being transported in plastic cocoons???) but I don’t know how widespread that is.
medicine,ffhvown,t1_ffh9lii,1579956055.0,"It’s built out of modules. In a big country that does a lot of this construction (i.e. China) there would be enough modules already built I presume that it’s just a matter of stacking them and connecting the utilities. Even in Australia it would only take me two weeks to transport and build a house extension if the pods are already warehoused.

More relevantly to medicine, in Australia we have built many hospital extensions with these construction techniques. Because it’s all built offsite, there is a minimum of disruption at our hospitals while we add operating theatres, rooms and corridors etc."
nextfuckinglevel,ffhvabb,t1_ffhnp6l,1579955547.0,"Experience is one half of it, the other half is learning new techniques, and the chance that someone at say 85 years old is able to incorporate entirely new fields like stereotactic radiosurgery or stereotactic open surgery into treatment plans is pretty slim."
nextfuckinglevel,ffhv76h,t3_etm8z3,1579955437.0,"The only next level this is, is the nextfuckinglevel of bad judgement."
medicine,ffhutnu,t3_etq482,1579954942.0,"3 take-aways - pathway from genomic sequence to phase 1 trials of a DNA vaccine has shortened to around three months after work with SARS and MERS. mRNA technology may speed this up further

-severity of disease appears to be lower than that of SARS (although given how extreme the SARS pathology was, this might not be saying much)

-importance of classic public health measures is stressed, as was effective in SARS but less so with MERS which continues"
languagelearning,ff52jkh,t3_eria03,1579578480.0,I’m learning Uzbek because of all the Reddit jokes- I told me son I would do it for laughs. So you really don’t need a reason. I mean I wouldn’t tell an Uzbek person I was learning his language as an in-joke
