I think it's why I like programming so much because you're using previous solutions to help solve your specific problem. But the constant flow of people just gets to you. Every now and then someone comes up and is just so cheerful and they make up for the past 5 customers. Then you get a customer that doesn't get it, doesn't understand that you need xyz information from them to help them and it starts to piss you off how difficult they are making your job when you know it's so easy for you, you just have to work with them to go through step by step to get their information and by the time you're done with them, it's been 33 minites when it could have taken you 5.

AskReddit,ffb3dt4,t1_ffar6db,1579750759.0,">we didn't have any sales because of no merchandise so they cut hours.

This is how you know a company is going down.  My store is going through a catch 22.  We aren't making profits.  They then have to cut hours.  Because they cut hours, there's no people to stock the sales floor.  If there's no one stocking, there's no merchandise in front of the customer.  No merchandise in front of the customer, the customer doesn't buy stuff.  Customers don't buy stuff, we don't reach sales goals and make profits.  Don't make profits and they have to cut hours...etc.  Round and round.  The biggest problem is they start cutting the front end's hours (the cashiers), not the people on the sales floor whose job it is to keep shelves stocked and to sell special order merchandise and get install leads and details.  When you hardly have any cashiers, customers wait in line for a long time.  Customers don't like that so they stop buying stuff at our store.  Management sees customers walking out after standing in line and think the fault lies with the cashiers because they should never get a line, right?  So now the front end isn't doing their job correctly and hours get cut again...

Customers can still buy stuff if there's no one on the sales floor.  They can't buy stuff if there aren't cashiers."

It seems everyone just defaults to supporting OP and blaming their SO even if we don't get enough information or it seems to be the fault of both OP and their SO.

Sure, any belittling of your partner is a huge red flag and should not be tolerated, but in this case, it seems like it can be managed through couples therapy and *communication*.  ***You got married to this guy.  Make it work or pay the consequences.*** Let this be a lesson, don't get married unless you don't mind spending *every living second* with this person.  You may not do that, but that is the commitment you need for a marriage to work.

I've browsed your post history and everything is removed.  I cannot gleam any useful information from your history other than you are unhappy at your husband's behavior.  Don't come to reddit then.  It's just an echo chamber.  All you're going to get is ""divorce his ass"" or similar.

>Yesterday he snapped at me because I changed the subject mid conversation when he was done talking. I thought he was finished because he said the same thing about work for like fifteen minutes venting... so I stopped offering sympathy and changed the subject.

Honestly, I would be furious too.  I vent to my partner *for 15 minutes*, which obviously means I'm passionate about it and it upsets me that much, and all she does is change the subject?  What the fuck?  *You* stopped offering sympathy, but he was not done being upset about whatever happened at work.  I'm doubtful he ignored you and was just in his own head working through his thoughts and feelings.  Since you checked out of that conversation, he did not want to talk to you further until he was done working through whatever he was feeling.

From how you write and the instances you've written about, I don't think it is purely his fault for how you're feeling. A marriage is a joint effort.  It takes 2 to tango.  You're upset at how he treats you?  Communicate it to him, not to Reddit.  At the same time, he needs to communicate better to you as well.  What you guys need is couples therapy.  A safe place where you're forced to just talk it out and resolved any issues.  *Divorce should be the last option when all other options have been exhausted*.

I wish you guys the best and hope you work it out.

I mean no offense to anyone, there are issues that transgendered people face every day that can cause physical and emotional harm, but in my opinion, if you're not average, you should preface eventually why you are not average, whether that be a small dick, big dick, curved dick, huge balls, burned vagina (idk, I'm making stuff up), or transgendered, as well as anything else.

AskReddit,fe0jgze,t3_eng8y5,1578814389.0,"I never really understood the point of questions like these.  A virgin is a virgin because they can't *get* sex, not because they can't *have* sex.  People know what to do, unless it super basic sex ed they need.  Penis goes in, penis goes out.  Ejaculate outside the vagina.  Boom easy, thread done, right?  Nope.

Questions like these should be answered about seducing a woman/man or the events leading up to sex.  How to talk to a woman/man, what to do on a date, etc.  Once you've kissed and touched her/him, you can pretty much be handsy to a point.  A virgin is never going to get to that point (unless the other person is desperate, imo).

My advice? Save money to ""donate"" to a...sex worker.  No need to seduce anyone.  You've bought yourself past that point and now you're guaranteed sex (if you want).  All worries are now out of your mind and your penis (or vagina) can work to its best ability without having to worry about performance anxiety or something.  Obviously, have a condom ready, tell your...sex worker...you haven't had sex and you want to use their...services...to gain confidence and knowledge in the bedroom.  Ask em' to be your...sex teacher...or something.

Depending on how much you've saved for...donations...will determine how quickly you can...dance horizontally...with a non sex worker.

Lastly, stop worrying.  Make friends, make fuck buddies, make whatever else you want.  Do not surround yourself with worries of sexual desire.  You'll tear yourself apart.  Go with the flow, be confident in yourself, love yourself first, do stuff you enjoy, be yourself, enjoy what life has to offer (sex isn't the only thing!), just be happy.
