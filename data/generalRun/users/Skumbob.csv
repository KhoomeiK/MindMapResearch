My point is, despite whatever trauma you've suffered, you've still a reasonable chance at making at least an okay life. And, you really can make a genuinely good life for yourself.

Kid, you can do it! Just don't get caught up in romance, do you and only you. Romance turned out to be my kryptonite, don't fall into the trap I did.

Rely on yourself and realize that you are worthy of life."
aww,fdgc165,t1_fdgbb0a,1578389397.0,"I want that companionship very much, especially having experienced it to a lesser degree as a child. I'm aware of the bond, your comment brought tears to a miserably drunken man's eyes. As much as I desire, and could even benefit from such a relationship, I'm barely capable of taking care of myself. 

Thank you for your relationship, I envy you. It was a truly rare example of fond nostalgia for me."

depression,fdg71et,t1_fdfzz6f,1578382651.0,"Thank you. I'm a monster because I upset the day to day normalcy of people whom claim to care about me.

The worst, ""morally"" thing I've done in my life is sell bootleg cigarettes and grass while I was in highschool, at least according to society. I've done worse towards those whom I care about, apathy. My seemingly constant apathy is what makes me a monster. I'm, however, not apathetic. I'm simply a product of my upbringing. And drunk as shit too; being a writer, I proofread before I post."

aww,fdg4van,t1_fdg2zmd,1578380100.0,"They're my favorite because of their uncanny ability to mimic us. I've always thought of them as a reflection of ourselves. Of course other stimuli from other folks and all...lol

I wanted to get an African grey, but my ex wanted nothing to do with the responsibility. Now that I'm alone, the company of such a fine animal would be welcomed, yet I can barely take care of myself nowadays, and to have any creature under my wing would be irresponsible."

Seeing it for the first time back in high school, it inspired me to look into blue grass and more importantly, the blues.

I get drunk after work every morning and stare holes into a revolver, oftentimes it's sitting in my lap. I wish I was devoid of integrity and could bring myself to break one of the most important promises, important to me at least, I had ever made.

I want to be selfish, but can't bring myself to be and I hate myself for it."

I've sobered up some, hence the more concise syntax.

I also still want to swallow a .44 freedom pill."
