I always work to create diverse teams and have always had great success with that. And I think everyone treated everyone else very respectfully. It created strong teams and very little drama that were able to make what seemed impossible happen. 

However, if the team are not strong, there will be lots of gossip and infighting and women typically take the brunt of it. To the point were they are constantly under various forms of attack.

I think the Military Industrial Complex is at most time working globally with a few super strong international allies to assure that WWII and WWII events never happen again on this this planet. There are those who profit from it, but you are never going to change that, whether it be a dictatorship or a capitalistic nation.  The Military Industrial Complex May have more power than  politicians, however I’ve worked on a few government project and politicians can really screw up the work of a 1000 hard working dedicated people in a heart beat. There has to be a disconnect but a loosely coupled connection. Otherwise this plant goes to s*** .

Is there a better way of maintaining the balance yes, however, in my opinion many other countries don’t want to budget for it. So the American capitalistic way took over. It’s not pretty but sometimes, if there’s enough money in it, that way, the GD America Capitalistic way, gets things done. 

Disclosure: I’ve worked with or  within this complex. It is filled with amazing, dedicated, hard working,  super intelligent yet know how to get the job done people. I only did it for 6 years, found it was time to move in, but I’ll never forget those people and how much they helped me ."

That my mental illness was never violent or turned outwards.  People with violent tendencies and mental illness are so lost. There is little help for them. Psychiatry has come a long way but has so far to go, there are so many in need and we have no clue what to do with them. 

 I say this as someone who lightly helped / volunteered with homeless in Manhattan  but more importantly had conversations and gotten to know some with violent tendencies. 

Another way to put this African proverb is that we are all like trees in a forest who need sunlight(love) those who do not get enough of it grow in weird direction, for before maturing, fall down one and die one day out of the blue because they grew asymmetrically. However, once in a while, those who do not get enough sunlight(love) and fall down take others with then."
