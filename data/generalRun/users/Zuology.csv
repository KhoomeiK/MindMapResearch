Modern Nike React shoes are designed with react foam making direct contact to ground with good traction but visually unpretty wear. Those designs have minimal rubber contact patches at the toe and heel but none in the midfoot.

Rubber is a heavier and more expensive material (compared to foam) that requires separate/additional tooling to manufacture, and requires additional steps/labor to attach to the midsole (have to glue/bond the rubber to the foam outsole).
