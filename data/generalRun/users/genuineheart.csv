It's amazing that you also have such high profile clients. It sounds so wonderful, thank you so much for encouraging me. I am currently working on getting a degree for Graphic Design. A big reason is because I hope to be able to successfully freelance if needed to some day. I am the only child of parents with very serious disabilities, and it's possible soon they will need me to help a lot more or care for them all together. This is so inspiring though, it gave me another idea of a professional job I can have where I could kind of control my own schedule. Thank you so much. It feels good to have different practical possibilities. Congratulations to you on your amazing business. :)"
