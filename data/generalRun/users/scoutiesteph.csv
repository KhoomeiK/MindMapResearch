The other thing they like to do is post about how co-workers, medical professionals, etc., only ever talk about food and weight and how boring they are."

If itâ€™s the same thing most days itâ€™s super easy to fall into a rut and chew to pass the time because your brain (and body) arenâ€™t getting adequate stimulation.

- Enforce a rule with yourself about snacking. Say, youâ€™re allowed one pre-planned snack after lunch, or no snacks between meals, etc.  Whatever works for you.

- Anytime you feel like snacking go for a walk. It doesnâ€™t need to be anything outside or away for long. Try just getting up to use the bathroom, check your mailbox, or get a refill on water. Do it once an hour to keep from sitting too long. Use your lunch time to take a longer walk and the eat at your desk later. 

- Start getting proactive with your career. The more responsibility you have in the day, the more work you have (usually) = less available time for snacking. Bonus in that it may lead to a promotion or better job down the road since youâ€™re building your resume"

fatlogic,fefawbd,t1_feem6wf,1579052277.0,"Because even though everyone agrees that breast milk is better than formula, not all moms have the option or ability to EBF. Iâ€™m glad breastfeeding is getting more attention and focus when for years it wasnâ€™t, but thereâ€™s a pretty strong backlash/judgement happening now with moms who think breastfeeding makes them superior. 

I already laid my story out in another comment on this thread, but to add to it- you will never understand as someone who was lucky enough to be able to EBF the heartbreaking failure when no matter what you do, your body fails and you have to give up feeding your child that way. You will never feel the silent judgement of strangers who see you pull out the formula supplies when with your hungry infant, the eye contact and minute shakes of their heads when they make all kinds of assumptions about your parenting based on your choice to FEED YOUR CHILD.

I donâ€™t know if you intend to come across that way, but your wording above indicates you hold some judgement about moms who donâ€™t EBF. I didnâ€™t choose to go formula out of ignorance or because I didnâ€™t care about my babiesâ€™ health. I did it because my body failed and they were hungry. I will have to carry that failure for the rest of my life, even though logically I know it does not matter when they are now thriving. Itâ€™s the knowledge that at its most basic level my body does not do what itâ€™s genetically designed for.

Thatâ€™s why youâ€™re getting downvoted."

fatlogic,feeczea,t1_feeajvj,1579031209.0,"I understand. You do sound very stressed about this, so just know youâ€™re not alone. So much of motherhood is glossed over or made to look pretty for social media; no one likes to discuss the struggles or the pain when things donâ€™t go the way you planned or the way other moms seemingly pull it off effortlessly."
fatlogic,fee8sjy,t1_fedwssx,1579028755.0,"Why not? It doesnâ€™t have to be an all or nothing thing. I struggled to keep my supply with both of my babies, and despite everything I did, all the pumping, massaging, lactose cookies and supplements.... almost no supply for either by 2-3 months in. Supplementing and eventually having to switch saved my sanity and likely pulled me back from PPD. I sobbed in the hospital when the lactation consultant handed me a bottle and gave me permission to not listen to my first cry from hunger.

Homemade bread also tastes better and is (IMO) more filling, so itâ€™s better bang for your calorie buck.

Sex addicts manipulate the people around them to get off, risk STDs, etc., Over-exercising is an addiction that FAs make light of to push their agenda. People are addicted to games and technology- see Japanâ€™s birth rate crisis for more info on that."
Breadit,fct2ghn,t1_fct1xs5,1577931141.0,"Mainly rise- I would love to see some large air holes. The flavor Iâ€™ve been happy with- tends to be more on the acidic side, but I keep my starter in the fridge between bakes so I expect that."

fatlogic,fcp2byo,t1_fcp1fz8,1577848317.0,No. No one should ever seek to improve themselves or their own well being because it makes them feel bad.
fatlogic,fcp0m1g,t1_fcp0680,1577846835.0,Itâ€™s like praise hands. Clapping is this ðŸ‘ðŸ»
fatlogic,fcooyy1,t1_fcooqkm,1577837739.0,"Well paying is relative. I started loan processing for a bank because no teaching jobs were panning out besides subbing and student loans donâ€™t pay themselves. Iâ€™ve since moved on/up and now do document reviews for high value loans on business equipment, which is a fancy way of saying Iâ€™m a paper pusher with the ability to wire money. But now I have two kids to feed and house and I carry our family benefits, so Iâ€™m overall pretty content with it. Teaching at this point would be an unsustainable financial hit due to loss of income."
fatlogic,fcooc8s,t1_fcohm0i,1577837281.0,"In another life I was going to be a teacher. TL;DR, plans didnâ€™t work out and I had to get the first well paying job I could.

My advice- have a big water bottle in class. Donâ€™t guzzle as bathroom breaks will be limited, but it gives you something to hold and sip if needed. Itâ€™s also helpful to remember itâ€™s not fair to eat in front of your students when a lot of schools restrict what they can eat and where outside of the lunch room. 

Also, restrain the urge to stress drink after school. A lot of teachers fall into alcoholism because itâ€™s easy to drink while grading and such."

Go to HR. Your boss wonâ€™t do anything, they absolutely will if youâ€™re not at a small company.

Or fight fire with Fire."

fatlogic,fcnh8vq,t1_fcnd2dl,1577811662.0,Sounds like you need a break for your Kentâ€™s health. Why not eat at maintenance for a few weeks and then get back on track when youâ€™re more focused?
JUSTNOMIL,fcnd5t6,t3_ehwunc,1577809181.0,"I mean, you sound like you have it covered. Go mama.

I can commiserate. I had the first girl in 50 years on my husbands side. His mom was the last one and she wanted a daughter. She went a little nuts right after DDs birth out of excitement (we didnâ€™t know the gender going in), but mellowed out over time and with consistency between DH and I. Now sheâ€™s just a happy grandma to a girl and boy (my DS), with minor BEC for me because sheâ€™s my MIL."
fatlogic,fcnbdr0,t3_ei3zsk,1577807992.0,"First time working in the office in about 2 weeks (thank goodness for weather and holidays making managers agree to extra working from home days). Itâ€™s our busiest week of the year, so we get catered lunch every day. Iâ€™m looking forward to it as itâ€™s some of my favorites in town (mexican today), and itâ€™s the only day I get to indulge in it since Iâ€™ve been working at home. 

Since walking in the door Iâ€™ve been offered:
- leftover pizza from yesterdayâ€™s lunch
- boozy fruitcake, which I tried because Iâ€™ve always wanted to
- copious amounts of candy
- Cookies 

I tried my cake, ate my yogurt, and got my fancy coffee that I planned on today. I saved a little candy to bring home, so this far Iâ€™m on track. But itâ€™s 10am and lunch isnâ€™t even here yet.

Send help guys. And yet offices are just TEEMING with diet culture, right???"
fatlogic,fclrd8q,t1_fclqkmp,1577754610.0,"Projection. The more their disordered eating becomes normalized, the more they can cry foul at healthy habits."
fatlogic,fcke8a2,t1_fckdtif,1577723355.0,"Even your example I would say shouldnâ€™t be on a diet. 11 yo girls have a lot of growing left, so unless their doc needs something done NOW, you can take advantage of puberty. I will say that child is old enough to be taught nutrition basics- you have to tailor it to the developmental age youâ€™re working with. A 2 year old knows no reasoning, so you give them healthy foods and an occasional treat. An 11 year old can understand their dietary choices have consequences"
fatlogic,fck56lp,t1_fck47cn,1577716912.0,In general itâ€™s not a good idea to put kids on diets unless itâ€™s emergent and medically supervised. Studies have shown itâ€™s been better to establish better eating habits as a family and let nature/next growth spurt take its course.
fatlogic,fciw7lw,t1_fcisgrg,1577671290.0,"I hear so many things that I think in the US at least, lent is very different for everyone. Some donâ€™t eat all day, some small meals with no snacks, etc. Always the no meat on Friday, but thatâ€™s about the only commonality I see"
fatlogic,fcho489,t1_fch8ln9,1577652297.0,"Depends on your flavor of Christian how strictly itâ€™s followed. Iâ€™m Roman Catholic, so adults follow it if they are of sound mind/medical allowances. Children and elderly are exempt. I will never claim to be perfect at it, but for me I cut out all non-meal snacks and usually down to 2 meals per day. Sundays are considered little easters so youâ€™re allowed a little â€œfeast.â€"

fatlogic,fc0w24u,t1_fc0ur7e,1577301185.0,"Try not to think of it that way. Yes, calories are important, but obsessing over them for one treat, one meal, one day of the year is the attitude FA folks think we do all the time and vilify as if being calorie conscious impedes on your life. If your family wants pie, make the pie. Enjoy it for a day, then move on until next year."
