-egg + spinach + bean sprouts: ~110

- 60g sweet potato: ~50

- string beans: <30 (didnt measure, but I know it was less than 85g) 

Full plate for under 200kcal. Added in a 300-kcal protein bar to fill out calorie count. 

Cooking without oil and not eating refined sugar and carbs seems to be the way to go, weight-management wise. I also don't snack anymore. Or drink calories. 

I calculated my rough TDEE from when I was 180-190lbs and it seems plausible - I can definitely see how over a week I would average 2000-2300kcal/day. Now, I'm struggling to make it to 1600-1700 because VEGETABLES."

i.e., I had a chocolate craving, so i just had a chocolate protein bar for breakfast and now I'm moving on with my life. Fits into my calories, gives me protein so that I'll be satiated, still scratches the chocolate itch (granted, I really like protein bars.)"
