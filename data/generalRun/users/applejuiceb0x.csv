todayilearned,fefg9aw,t1_feexyvd,1579055688.0,He was assassinated for exposing tea as the inferior beverage to the immortal elixir known as coffee. Everyone I know that is dead doesn’t drink coffee drink coffee anymore. Coincidence? I think not.
FocusVCarta,fe5b51m,t1_fe4k8aq,1578867246.0,My focus V sic is bigger than my quartz and titanium and it’s an issue. The titanium cap puts too much pressure on the insert and I keep cracking plates
FocusVCarta,fcyo957,t1_fcyezcs,1578083768.0,Yea but I believe the temp on the PID is based off resistance in the cool and probably not accurate to what it’s reading in the actual bucket. I could be wrong but it’s what I’m assuming.
todayilearned,fcyo487,t1_fcy2ie3,1578083694.0,Can I give you an example where an entirely theoretical concept based on tech that is not yet available? Lol. I’m sure if I go back through history I can find something similar enough to draw a parallel to but at the end of the day I don’t care to because my point still stands that your examples aren’t relevant for reasons stated above.
FocusVCarta,fcy1ciq,t1_fcy0bfc,1578073311.0,Makes me want a terpometer
FocusVCarta,fcy1bpy,t1_fcy0bfc,1578073297.0,Yea it was bugging me because my friend was able to run his on a way lower setting than I could no matter which base I was using (I have 3) but what I was able to conclude is it’s variation in the resistance/ohms of the coils.
FocusVCarta,fcy04mp,t1_fcxzxqy,1578072793.0,I’ve seen pretty high variation in the kits I got from focus V. I want to try me bonsais or the JCvap ones to see if they’re more consistent.
todayilearned,fcxznl1,t1_fcxyn5z,1578072698.0,Lol either you’re reaching buddy or just aren’t smart enough to realize none of the things you’re mentioning are even remotely the same as they don’t also come with access to the persons personal info and payment information which changes literally everything. Can it be abused? Of course and abusers will be dealt with and removed from the system. If people are still fucking with cars the punishments will get more severe until people stop.
todayilearned,fcxyia9,t1_fcxxv1x,1578072249.0,Pretty sure that would be possible and business would spring up specifically for this purpose in automated car world
todayilearned,fcxxtzb,t1_fcxjp9u,1578072023.0,I was just about to comment this. I can’t wait for the day when my car is off ubering making us money while I’m not using it.
FocusVCarta,fcxwnv6,t3_ejgqtn,1578071558.0,You can get rebuild kits much cheaper than replacing the whole atomizer housing with similar effect. Odds are the resistance on one of the atty’s varied. Coils can vary too it seems. I’ve had some seem way hotter than others
puffco,fcskw12,t1_fcs3r94,1577918659.0,I believe the v3 hits a little lower temp than the v2 but I could be wrong. Many people recommended the puff coil repair or Mr bonsai replacement heating plates as they have a lower resistance and fire hotter than stock
MorganaMains,fcj0ryh,t3_ehe8ii,1577674434.0,ok so you put one point in each for levels 1-3 then levels 4-5 are into W and 6 ult. At level 7 look at your lane and look at your team. If you're behind in farm put another point into W. If you're good on farm but need to start getting kills put it into Q. Same question at level 8 after that it no longer matters much either works. I usually build zhonyas and luden's simultaneously because having a stop watch early helps.
FocusVCarta,fcj08or,t3_ehfw45,1577674058.0,try taking atomizer off and then back on if that doesn't work try taking the batteries out and put them back in upside down turn it on then take them back out and put them back in the right way. If that doesn't work the atomizer might need rebuilt.
television,fca8h94,t1_fca7ehz,1577564671.0,you do cardio while not doing cocaine to build up cardiovascular strength so that on the weekends when you sit around doing cocaine its ready for it! or something.
television,fc3bqwf,t1_fc34ps4,1577386290.0,you get a new job and spend the next 15-20 years paying off student loans on something you'll never get any use out of. (source ex animation student)
FocusVCarta,fby5dy3,t1_fby5790,1577208504.0,Instagram. As far al I know he’s down to just stock and white bases but I could be wrong. He’s got a bunch of random stuff leftover
