AskReddit,ffo02bc,t1_ffk32kc,1580072837.0,"Droid labor would be one reason.  If you have a workforce that doesn't need to breath you can just drop workers and tooling on a small moon or an asteroid that has the right mix of elements and have them do all the work from mining to smelting to fabrication all in place.  Just jettison all unusable material and tow the resulting products to wherever final assembly is done.  Keep doing that for an entire star system that has most of the constituent elements you need.  

Wookie slave labor never made sense to me compared to droid labor.  Protocol and astromech droids should be a small minority compared to construction and manufacturing droids that can work 24/7.  For every R2 unit out there there should probably be 10,000 mining bots in a universe like Star Wars."

For a screen adaptation it works better to show those kinds of things ahead of time so we can see why Rand developing powers is about the worst thing that can happen to him.  It creates tension since anything that happens to Logain is what Rand can expect to happen to him."

At some point I wanted to ask people in this sub a similar question about read speed.  I was curious if there is any sort of correlation due to some of us categorizing scene details rather than visualizing them and how that might (or might not) affect how fast we read."

Aphantasia,ffbvmw0,t3_esrzr0,1579784278.0,"The effects of Autism on a person's life are often a lot more pronounced, defined, and diagnose-able then the effects of Aphantasia.  Add to that the idea that most people who have Aphantasia probably have no idea that it even exists and there just isn't enough inertia to create a large community for it.

If Aphantasia was more ""debilitating"" (for lack of a better term) it would be more widely studied, which in turn would lead to more community.  

Personally I don't look at it as a condition, or something wrong that needs to be fixed or treated.  Rather it is just a slightly better understanding of how different minds can be given the same data, but process that data through different methods.  In some cases it may be advantageous, in some cases not.

Our brains are all different, so obviously how it affects your life may be wildly different than it's affect on mine."

politics,ff3kt1y,t1_ff3h2t6,1579543168.0,"From their point of view ... why would they?

They are standing up for their right to own, and bear arms.  Leaving them home would seem silly.  If you had to sum up their belief and reason for protesting it would be ""We are armed, and will not be disarmed"".  Leaving the gun at home doesn't make the first part of that point.

They don't believe that the 2nd amendment is for home defense or hunting, they believe in the right for the reason it was included (amended) in the Constitution; to protect against a tyrannical government."
politics,ff3g2we,t1_ff38o5c,1579540321.0,"They want to make the point that several thousand responsible gun owners can show up and protest peacefully.  

The only way this thing will go sideways is if agitators show up, or police handle things poorly, both of which are unlikely.  The protesters are **very aware** that any trouble today will hurt their cause immensely.

> As if they don't get their way they want to warn people they have weapons and will use them. 

That is kind of their point.  If our government tries to take people's guns their will be a 2nd civil war.  There is no maybe about it.  That will be the result, and it would be the worst thing that could happen to this country."
LifeProTips,feqlvem,t3_eqa3om,1579343411.0,"You should honestly talk to any aging relatives that you are close to about those kinds of issues.  Not just their will, and who gets what, but things like their Living Will, Do Not Resuscitate orders, things they worry about as they get older, where they keep important documents, combos to safes, etc..

My parents made sure we talked over all of this.  It saved us from a lot of heartache when my dad was unresponsive and wasting away.  Even having discussed it we still had to make tough decisions, but it would have been much worse without knowing what he'd want us to do.  

To give an example.  My dad was unresponsive, and hospitalized as his health declined.  We read through his Living Will and one of the sections involves whether or not to administer dialysis to keep him alive, to which he had answered No.  Except ... he had been on Dialysis 3 times a week for 5+ years, which means we would be discontinuing it rather than choosing not to start it.  The living will document predated him starting Dialysis.  But, my siblings and I had had plenty of conversations about health and aging with him and knew it was an older document and were able to make the correct decision (in our opinion, and his).

Another section covers feeding tubes, and was another yes or no question.  But there are different kinds and levels of procedures that fall under the header of feeding tubes.  Temporary IV lines would give him nutrition long enough for us to get results from the tests the hospital administered, but are only short term solutions.  A surgically inserted feeding tube is a longer term solution but comes with risks of infection.  Following his Living Will strictly would have meant not administering **any** form of feeding tube, but that wasn't what he have wanted either.  The document just can't cover every potential medical situation, so you are left with Yes or No answers to very broad questions.  

These kinds of decisions are not something you want to have to make in an incredibly stressful, emotional time.  Not knowing if you are making the right medical decisions for loved ones can be heartbreaking, and guilt inducing.  Having discussions about these things ahead of time can save you from misery.

As far as the actual question the OP asked.  My father had talked to each of us as he got older and asked each of us what items we might want, and how he'd like things divided.  He had worked it out in advance to the point where there were absolutely no arguments about who got what.  He paid for funeral services before he passed.  He even chose music he'd want at the service, and the minister he wanted to speak.  You can't imagine how much stress he saved us from by thinking ahead.  It is one more thing I greatly admire about him."

local pizza shop or bar (for 6 packs but not cases).

In the last few years our state government blessed us with the ability to buy a limited amount of beer at grocery stores ... but we have to buy it at a separate counter.  The obvious solution is to just drive farther and spend my money in Delaware.
