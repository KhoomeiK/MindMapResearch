no, Angels aren't good or evil in Judaism, they are simply tools of God, the Hebrew word for angel, malech, simply translates as messenger

Smol means left in Hebrew so maybe...? 

>Didn’t he aid in the corruption of man? Then, is he also the devil? I thought his name changed to Lucifer once the civil war started. Are these two the same or separate entities?

none of these are Jewish concepts. there is no original sin or corruption of man in Judaism, no Devil/Lucifer, no heavenly civil war."

Just to clarify, Lublin was once the Seat of [the Council of the four lands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Council_of_Four_Lands) (in hebrew:Va'ad arba Artzot) which was a semi-independent body that oversaw Jewish life and the [Qahal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qahal) system in the Polish-Lithuanian commonwealth in the 16th century. in the 20th century or at the time of the holocaust there was nothing that could in any sense be described as a ""Jewish government"" in Europe and jews were as varied in their political beliefs as their non-Jewish neighbors."

Often, yes. Hence the Jewish underground in the Warsaw Ghetto tended to use women as runners outside the wall as they were less likely to be caught. 

Beyond that, though there were a lot of other ways to be caught. For one in eastern Europe where the vast majority of European Jews lived Jews were socially separate enough that they spoke a different language (yiddish) at home and many had a distinct accent when speaking polish or Russian. On top of that, many countries at the time included religion and national group on as part of state documentation."

Judaism,ff2qj8z,t1_feypcd5,1579519475.0,"There are assholes in the Jewish community like any community, but those who speak poorly of converts are not acting in accordance with Jewish law or values. 

No yeshiva has a blanket rule that disallows converts, or Sephardi, or jews of Color etc. However there are yeshivot that have absurd requirements about the home lives of their students (which may be legally questionable if ever challenged) like they won't accept students whose mothers wear pants or drive a car, that basically discourage anyone not from their specific community from applying. 

all in all the issue doesn't really come up with non-jewish students because they would never apply. Catholics schools are often well funded, significantly better than local public schools and tend to not be overly catholic. Yeshivas tend to be worse than public schools for secular subjects, still cost money, and devote the vast majority of the day to Jewish subjects.  there's no reason a non-jew would want to put their kid in that situation.

And who are you to say this, Jewish identity is not solely predicated around religious practice, there is a massive culture and national identity that goes with it and there are many Jewish Atheists who see no contradiction there.
