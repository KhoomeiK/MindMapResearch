LSD,fej75l0,t1_fehwvtp,1579159714.0,"LSD is better and safer for your first time compared to shrooms. My first dosage of LSD was 150 and I had an amazing time. Tripped probably over 50 times ever since then. (maybe an exaggeration, I don't keep track). Actually planning on tripping this upcoming Monday or Sunday. Whenever you do trip please don't forget to stay hydrated

Also don't be too scared on what you'll envision. I'm sure your first time tripping isn't going to be a huge dosage. You won't be hallucinating as much as you think you will or something. But then again everyone is different"
