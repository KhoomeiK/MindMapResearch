Given that it also has a slow and knock-up it makes it a pain to get close enough, and a decent player can knock-up just as you go for the stun guaranteeing some slaps that can, and most likely will, take a good chunk of health, even if you are tanky. If I can slap an Ama with a hefty amount of defense for 515 with one hit, no crit, then something is a little wrong here."
Smite,feblman,t1_fc6ta05,1578960052.0,"I honestly don't get people saying he's not broken. I shouldn't be slapping an Ama who built a lot of defense for 515 with one auto, no crit. I shouldn't be able to kill them in 3 hits. I really don't get why his 2 needs a slow in it as well. It already slaps for a lot of damage, the knock-up just guarantees some hits. I don't mind his 3 if they tune it a little bit. The ult is okay if they tune the damage. Cool idea, but holy shit, majority of the time I fight against Heim I have almost no chance. Only one time comes to mind when I was against a guy who had zero understanding of the game. Otherwise, even if they are bad at the game, his damage makes up for it."

That series was incredibly biased, had zero point, and he tried painting Jake as some misunderstood guy. 5 minutes of Googling Jake would bring up that video of him explaining how he markets toward kids, along with a myriad of other stuff.

I firmly believe he just cashed in on the Paul's before their buzz died down. Which is perfectly fine, make money any way you can. Same can be said about makeup. Now I know Jeffree did it for him since he helped him with the first documentary. But damn, the way Shane acts is just odd to me. Taking a break again while through the whole thing complaining about money, despite living in a very nice area of LA with nice cars, in a pretty big home while not having to work a typical job and able to take large breaks has always rubbed me the wrong way. Especially now that he made millions from merch and makeup sales along with anything made off YouTube. I guess I never liked how he calls himself poor.

I mean ffs Jake literally did an interview talking about how to market to kids and Shane let him get away with saying he doesn't, or something along those lines. Or the psychologist he had who does not specialize in, what was he saying Jake had, sociopath? And loads of other issues with his way of documenting.
