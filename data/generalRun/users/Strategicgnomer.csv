moderatepolitics,ffqre43,t1_ffqp9zk,1580141889.0,That's a very prejudiced view and objectively wrong. You need to go talk to some trans people and stop being so closed minded on the subject of sexuality. Until then you aren't worth arguing with.
moderatepolitics,ffpfsjz,t3_euh8bx,1580093969.0,"Ultimately no, bias is inherent in politics. There's no objective truth to human psychology. Just as one person can get beaten daily and have no trauma while others have a lot, directing any humans in any manner can go right or wrong depending on the human. So because there's no singular way to govern correctly, there never will be one universally agreed upon truth and so it's all opinion. Additionally, if you have two people (for example) expressing two opposing views about the same subjects for any length of time, those views will change and possibly merge or diverge over time. So there's no reliable way to stay neutral on any subjective piece of information.

As the former person pointed out, appointing conservatives judges was something Republicans wanted, it didn't benefit Trump ONLY and probably hasn't done anything useful for him personally. So your point about him only doing things for himself is incorrect.

TwoXChromosomes,ffk0ao6,t1_ffju30x,1580011904.0,"I think there is a solution offered here which is, introspection. It takes a lot of time and maturity to start seeing your own faults in situations like this so it may be very hard, many people in their 40s and 50s still can't. If you want to have better relationships though, you need to be able to look at what you did wrong.

&nbsp;

I'm not sure why you may be attracted to guys who have very close female friends but since it seems like you are, maybe it's time to examine your jealousy. 

&nbsp;

I'm not trying to lay all the blame on you here, but if there's a pattern, that's usually a clue. One thing you need to learn is that your previous trauma, while valid, doesn't excuse poor behavior. You have the ability to change how you act and react to situations and people, no one else is responsible for that. You may have an initial reaction that gets triggered by a previous painful incident but you can train yourself to stop, take a breath and rethink that thought process. Evaluate whether that feeling is real or a product of an assumption you're making due to some preconceived notion you had about relationships. 

&nbsp;

To give you an example, my father was a very angry person and would lash out at people for the slightest things. I took that on too. But it was making my life very miserable and I had to stop doing that. So every time I get angry, instead of snapping, I stopped, asked myself, is this right, is it fair to the person I'm angry at, and if I snapped faster than I could stop myself, should o apologize and explain? It didn't happen fast I might add it took years of work, but now it's much easier. Not perfect, I still have issues but I don't jump to conclusions like my father, assuming people are trying to just hurt me or attack me.

 &nbsp;

It may be time for you to look at your assumptions and whether your actions are warranted. In some cases they may be, in others you might need to challenge your views and actively work to change them.

&nbsp;

You can't have a good relationship if you have jealousy. I also had jealousy issues and I can tell you, now if my partner cheated on me, it wouldn't end my world and probably not my relationship. And because of that my relationship is very very strong because we both trust each other very much. Jealousy is a burden, an anchor that holds you back from moving forward together and it's very toxic.

&nbsp;

Anyway, good luck, I hope you find the strength to get through your traumas and live a good life and find a good love."

personalfinance,ffjr55w,t3_etrnsi,1580004779.0,"Sounds like you're doing ok financially. If you do decide to buy a car, buy a beater. It won't look cool but older cars like older civics, Ford focus or similarly popular cars will be cheap to fix if you can find a cheap mechanic and you can find one for <$800 that will last you a few years. Gas and insurance are the real costs here so look into insurance rates first and add it to a proposed budget. Do a spreadsheet of what you'll have saved, how much per month you'll earn and how much you'll spend. Take into account your rent, heat/water/internet/phone/etc., food, then see if your insurance and gas will fit in. Depending on how much you're driving, expect anywhere from $20-40 every two weeks for gas and maybe 80-120 for insurance, depending on where you live per month. It's hard to say what you'll be spending on bills because it can change so drastically from place to place so look up averages for your area and do the math. How many hours will you work, will you be able to get overtime, etc.

PoliticalDiscussion,ffbnbqx,t1_ffbl9fc,1579773988.0,"I disagree, all you need is the numbers and Democrats will show up if they have a candidate they like and she's the most agreeable. Trump isn't very well liked by swing voters or Democrats at all, all you need is someone people are willing to go vote for and she's it. She's got the largest secondary support, almost everyone has her as second choice or first choice. Not nearly as many people who don't like Biden want Sanders, but people who like Sanders are ok with Warren and so are Biden supporters, and she has her own strong base. I think she's the only candidate that everyone will be on board with enough to beat Trump. If you go with Biden, Bernie supporters will likely not vote out of spite, like they did with Hillary, if you go Bernie, same thing with the moderates, but both camps are ok with Warren. That's the major thing, you have to have EVERYONE at the polls to beat Trump. Democrats have greater numbers by far, enough to swing the election from an incumbent, but they all need to be ok with the candidate. Everyone may not love Warren like Sanders supporters love Bernie but no one would outright not vote if Warren is on the ticket. I think Biden and Bernie are too controversial in their own respects."
PoliticalDiscussion,ffbj9tq,t1_ffbhxjm,1579767917.0,"Not to mention Warren is the better candidate, more people have her as second choice over all other candidates.

I'd take him over Trump any day, and probably over most Republicans certainly, but I'd much rather see someone who is both progressive and willing to compromise and reach across the aisle.

Very finicky."
NoStupidQuestions,fe8zkhy,t3_enyv72,1578932601.0,"I'm on the side of, it's a lasagna, singular, and here's why:
Lasagna
noun
pasta in the form of wide strips.
a baked Italian dish consisting of wide strips of pasta cooked and layered with meat or vegetables, cheese, and tomato sauce.

There's no specified way of cooking or arranging the lasagna, and no specified number of layers or thickness. So much like if you take two bottles of wine and pour them into one pitcher they become one pitcher of wine, if you put two lasagnas on one plate/platter etc, they are now one lasagna. Unless they are separated by some defining qualities such as, store bought vs made from scratch or vegan g/f and meaty in which case, get your damn train wreck off my lasagna!"
PersonalFinanceCanada,fe8w6p4,t3_eo4xc9,1578931715.0,"Top suggestion, sound proofing. There's a cheap way which will work a little, and an expensive way which will work very well. 

Also, let this lesson in, always read the bylaws twice. Think of things you'd hate to have and check if they're covered in the bylaws. In our condo, no noise after 11pm and there's a minimum sound proofing requirement. If you like to decorate, make sure your bylaws don't prohibit alterations, ours only restrict walls and floors requiring approval for any alterations to either. Etc. 

Call the strata president, see if they're chill or super uptight, ours was early 40s, lawyer, responsive, helpful, cool. If your strata is all old uptight people who get their kicks power trippin, avoid.

Basically, think of everything that can go wrong and check that it's covered. Fire? Earthquake? Flood? Does it have a depreciation report? Etc.

Don't buy until you're confident and get a realtor who will tell you these things. If your realtor isn't giving you the run down on what to look out for, find a better one. Ours almost wouldn't let us buy a place because it had no depreciation report. I thought, what's the big deal, until he explained it to us and pointed out the possibly leaky windows and such, we understood to avoid that place.

You can also rent out the current one as some have suggested though that's extra headache too.

Anyway, sorry you got a bad deal, at least you know better now what to look out for and you'll be much more prepared for your next place! And keep complaining. Eventually the owner will get sick of it and hopefully do something like soundproofing from their side? Just remember to be polite or you'll get nowhere. And get in good with the council, start saying hello if you see them, make some cookies and offer them some, catch more flies with honey and all that. Even the rude council members I always treat with kindness, even when they are nagging me about something, because then when I want something, they are happy to help!

A condo is a shared space, if you treat your neighbors nice, they'll be nice. If you don't... They won't try to help you either.

Anyway, good luck! I hope it resolves for you. Shitty living situations are very frustrating indeed."

This is sort of exactly the behavior of a government against freedom. If my nation isn't allowed to choose for itself what to do with it's own industries because America doesn't like it and, by choosing to do so invokes war, the country starting that war on my country or not necessarily war but operations that can be construed as acts of war, is taking away my freedom to choose my government.
