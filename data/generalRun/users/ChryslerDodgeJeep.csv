Next year is still a rebuild for Detroit but I can honestly see them being in the conversation for 2023 or 2024.

Detroit's an original six market and only Buffalo (1978) has a longer streak without an NHL ASG than Detroit.  Detroit has seen both the Super Bowl (2006) within four years of completing Ford Field as well as the MLB ASG in 2005 after Comerica Park was completed in 2000, so there's definitely precedence for this.  Considering that Detroit last hosted the NBA ASG back when *Olympia* was still being used in 1959, they're more than due for one as well.

Also, consider that this is the first year Detroit isn't having the North American International Auto Show in January in decades.

The NBA gets 'sposure because the individuals are marketed almost as much as the teams are.  It makes sense given how impactful one person can be in a game of basketball, but it could do hockey some good to attempt to market or showcase individuality as well.

I mean, look at EASHL.  It went from two dudes picking a random team (which was awesome) to everyone playing for the same two teams but now being able to individually customize their avatar.  These are much smaller and lower-impact changes that have little to do with improving the game itself but allow for an *enormous* domain of uniqueness -- these are focused on giving the player that extra dose of dopamine in hopes of bringing them back for more playtime.  See games like CS:GO, Fortnite, and Rocket League to even titles like Gran Turismo[1] where you are still forced to drive the same vehicles in certain online modes.  This is just the way that incremental changes are heading when it comes to gaming.

If the NHL front office is smart, they'll seek to do something like this eventually.  The problem is the conservative, and almost dogmatic, nature of professional sports that holds playing fields and jerseys as Grail-like objects.  Tradition is worshipped at the cost of evolution -- the game of baseball is a fantastic example of this.  Hell, I'm willing to bet the 3v3 overtime was only instituted because the league had their backs to the wall and were seriously hard-up for ideas to make the game more exciting thereby bringing in more viewing revenue.

And then once the passing lane section ends, they slow back down to a crawl. JUST. CAN'T. TAKE. IT.

Detroit's coaching staff comes up with a game-plan before the game, show the players some tape, coach them on how to play, and it works well.

What goes wrong?  Opposing coaches witness the strategy during the first period, quickly draw up tactics to defeat during the intermission, and their players execute in second and third periods.  They are able to execute in the second and third periods because the the staff in Detroit are simply unable to respond on-the-fly to these in-game changes.  If we suppose that Detroit's coaches are competent enough to sniff out the adjustments, they are either unable to convey them to the players, *or* the system that they play or mindset that they preach is so rigid and inflexible as to be detrimental to player execution.

There's also a whiff of conditioning problems.  Gone are the days when an AARP card-holding Chelios was kicking everyone's ass in the weight rooms.  If you hate yourself enough to watch Wings games, you'll see at least two or three instances of them getting hemmed into their own end and looking like they're on the PK when it's 5v5 for no reason.

The kicker?  Each of those years they lost *less* than Blockbuster.

Below are the net income reported each year in millions of USD$.

| Year | Netflix | Blockbuster |

| 2003 |7|-977

Between 2004 and Blockbusters demise in 2010, Netflix increased their profits *every single year*, setting a new record *every single year*.  Blockbuster?  They had *a* year in the black, with $51mm in 2006.  The other years between 2004 and 2010?  All losses, for a total of $3,000mm (BILLION)."

> When movie studios turned to the DVD format, they departed from their years-long strategy, opting to offer new movies at prices anybody could afford. Walmart, Best Buy and other box retailers quickly became among Blockbuster’s biggest competitors, as they could price movies at or even below wholesale costs, using them as loss leaders to drive traffic. Oh, and those DVDs were also lighter and cheaper to send through the mail, giving rise to Netflix’s initial mail-service business and allowing for a more practical kiosk rental model (i.e. Redbox).

> “The economics of the business completely changed,” Payne said. Studios were “mining their back catalogue and selling millions of these things to Walmart and Target and everybody for like $3 or $4. And they would retail them for $5. Well, [customers] would go in a Blockbuster to rent it, and they’d want to rent it to them for $4.50.”"
