fatlogic,ffiiyjm,t1_ffi8uc8,1579974988.0,"Yeah, the big box places are really bad about vanity sizing. The brands you wear are probably more true-to-size, if that term even has meaning anymore."
fatlogic,ffi83vf,t1_ffi7tlr,1579967546.0,"You do? Like at Target or Old Navy, you’d wear a 12?"
jobs,ffgyfwx,t3_etk2ng,1579918287.0,"I would be honest with your current employer. If you’re looking to make more money, then you have to do what it takes to make that happen. I would let her know that you’re interested in something that could affect your current job and see what she says. 

It’s possible that she might even offer you more hours at your current job."
fatlogic,ffglq8d,t3_eti3vu,1579909156.0,What if you were working hard to change your body? And what if the poster is proud of their effort and doesn’t want your negativity?
fatlogic,ff5um0f,t1_ff5tzbk,1579610805.0,"Yes, me too."
fatlogic,fel3arn,t1_feimujt,1579213139.0,"That’s true. We don’t have control over anything that happens but also if we do, it’s bad."
fatlogic,feik6i0,t3_ep773m,1579140424.0,"So self-control is bad. Awesome. I’m ready to commit my first murder. Annoying work lady, watch out."

SneakyAnimals,fdztzm3,t3_en95uw,1578795746.0,I love how he made sure that the coast was absolutely clear.
fatlogic,fdy5fqb,t1_fdy2rjd,1578776288.0,"Small to XL or sometimes 2XL/3XL. You can buy your clothes at a standard store, not only at a plus-size store or online."
fatlogic,fdxx058,t1_fduqqwn,1578773809.0,"Husband, or boyfriend. When I was on her Instagram I saw something that made me think he was a husband. I can’t remember what it was and I could be wrong, anyway."
cuddleroll,fdt7a8j,t1_fdsnxr7,1578712854.0,"I’m telling you what I think about having cats in public spaces. I would be so excited and happy to see a cat anywhere. I get hives, itchy eyes/ears/throat and my nose runs and I sneeze. Still want all of the cats."
cuddleroll,fdsngzn,t1_fdsafec,1578705509.0,"Not for me. I’m very allergic to cats, but my symptoms are worth it if it means I get to cuddle a cat."
fatlogic,fds8vm5,t1_fds7re5,1578697011.0,"I just read that. Wtf. She judged the guy immediately and he didn’t judge her at all. Why is he the bad guy? It’s okay for her to do whatever the fuck she wants with her body, so why can’t he do what he wants with his? Maybe he feels better when he eats fruit versus when he eats chips and candy? 

Maybe he doesn’t like her fancy tea? She thought he was a moron simply for that. If he was as fat as her, would she have even gone out with him? If this is how she feels, why would she even agree to a date with a non-fat guy? He went to and did everything she wanted. 

Her husband has to be the most patient person ever."
fatlogic,fdbp2pu,t3_ekgr6e,1578259644.0,But I thought all bodies have a natural set point and it doesn’t matter if you exercise or not?!?
