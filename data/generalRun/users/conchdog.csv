RoverPetSitting,ffcpme5,t3_eswktd,1579804535.0,"Variations of this question get asked frequently on this subreddit, but since I strongly feel that sitters grossly undercharge for a service like this I'd like to reiterate what I've said before:

I charge an hourly rate more or less equivalent to what I charge for a 30 min walk or drop-in. IMO if you charge only a daycare fee you undervalue yourself as you would end up making less than minimum wage (in my county). I'd say daycare is appropriate if the client brings their dog(s) to you and you are able to take on other dogs at the same time to make a livable hourly wage. When you're going to their home and they expect your undivided attention on their dog(s) only, they should be prepared to pay accordingly."

RoverPetSitting,fd0pp70,t3_ejsjix,1578122090.0,"*How often are you paid, and is it a direct deposit into your checking account?*

You get paid two days after a booking ends. Payment is through PayPal or check. 

*What happens if you are so sick that you can’t leave the house? Like you get the flu, stomach bug, or appendicitis? Can you get coverage day of the walks?*

Ideally your clients would have a back-up walker for situations like this. You will not be able to send a third party to a client's home without their permission. 

*What if you have regular clients but need to take a day off for personal reasons? Or go on vacation?*

This is something you arrange directly with your clients. I suggest giving notice to your clients well in advance. 

*Do you have to wear a Rover shirt? I have red hair and fair skin, so I have to cover up completely when I’m outside several hours a day doing walks - especially in the L.A. sun. I have all the risk factors for skin cancer, so wearing a t-shirt isn’t good enough.*

You can wear whatever you want. 

*Do you have a window to do the walk, or do you have to be there at a specific time? What happens if you’re late?*

This is up to you and your clients to decide. For Rover Now you should be there close to the time requested, or within 30 min of accepting an ASAP walk. If you are significantly late clients may leave a bad review. 

*The map thing makes me nervous because I’ve walked some dogs that are stubborn or slow, and if a map tracked us, it would look like we didn’t get very far. I’m afraid of clients being upset in that scenario.*

Sometimes clients will get upset. It comes with working in the service industry. I will say that have never had a client upset for this reason. They are typically aware if their dog is a slow or reluctant walker. 

*Can you still set your own rates?*

Yes, except for with Rover Now. 

*Can you do walks in two separate parts of the city?* 

You can currently only set one service radius. Alternatively you could set a service radius that covers both Calabasas and West LA. 

*Can you walk two or three dogs at the same time?* 

Rover is focused on individual attention on one dog, or multiple dogs from a single household. However, if your clients agree to it you can walk multiple dogs (from different households) at once. With Rover Now you cannot walk dogs from different households together. 

It takes a while to build up clientele with Rover, so don't count on making much (especially considering COL in LA) the first couple of months. You can start making some money right away with Rover Now, but the payout is low ($12/30 min walk, $18/60 min walk, slightly more for two dogs)."

dogs,fdw5v71,t1_fduq308,1578755370.0,"Due to his size the only option was cargo. I called all the airlines with direct flights to ask which of them could accommodate his crate, and the only airline with a direct flight that could do that was Hawaiian Airlines (HA). Otherwise I would have preferred Alaska Airlines too. 

Before booking my ticket I called HA cargo to see which flights had spaces left for dogs in cargo. As soon as I got a confirmation I booked my ticket online, then I called HA cargo again to book a spot for my dog on the same flight. He was booked specifically on that flight, but this was a couple of years ago so HA's policy may have changed since then."

RoverPetSitting,fdtiqfk,t3_en2nur,1578717339.0,"Interesting read, thanks for sharing! I frequently think about how boarding dogs in one's home is technically illegal in residential/non-commercial areas (which is naturally where most people live) in my city, and similar to what was mentioned in the article, one cannot house more than three dogs (one's own pets included) without a kennel license. Yet there are at dozens of sitters in my area who do both of those things with impunity, at least for now."
dogs,fdtfxwp,t3_en1x4x,1578716193.0,"I have used Hawaiian Airlines at two different locations, and both times I had to check in my dog at the cargo terminal. The cargo crew was great at both locations, but on the last flight no one was able to confirm that my dog had in fact boarded the aircraft. Fortunately it turned out that he had, however it made for a quite stressful flight. I would have preferred a different airline, but Hawaiian was the only airline that had direct flights between my destinations that could accommodate a 700 series crate. 

Before you head to the airport make sure that the crates comply with the requirements of your chosen airline. 

Good luck!"

RoverPetSitting,fdffctb,t3_ekyzbv,1578360387.0,"I think Rover Now is good for getting your first reviews on Rover, but not worth it in the long run considering you make $12/hr (less than minimum wage in my city) and have to cover your own transportation costs such gas and wear and tear on your car."

RoverPetSitting,fd0pp70,t3_ejsjix,1578122090.0,"*How often are you paid, and is it a direct deposit into your checking account?*

You get paid two days after a booking ends. Payment is through PayPal or check. 

*What happens if you are so sick that you canâ€™t leave the house? Like you get the flu, stomach bug, or appendicitis? Can you get coverage day of the walks?*

Ideally your clients would have a back-up walker for situations like this. You will not be able to send a third party to a client's home without their permission. 

*What if you have regular clients but need to take a day off for personal reasons? Or go on vacation?*

This is something you arrange directly with your clients. I suggest giving notice to your clients well in advance. 

*Do you have to wear a Rover shirt? I have red hair and fair skin, so I have to cover up completely when Iâ€™m outside several hours a day doing walks - especially in the L.A. sun. I have all the risk factors for skin cancer, so wearing a t-shirt isnâ€™t good enough.*

You can wear whatever you want. 

*Do you have a window to do the walk, or do you have to be there at a specific time? What happens if youâ€™re late?*

This is up to you and your clients to decide. For Rover Now you should be there close to the time requested, or within 30 min of accepting an ASAP walk. If you are significantly late clients may leave a bad review. 

*The map thing makes me nervous because Iâ€™ve walked some dogs that are stubborn or slow, and if a map tracked us, it would look like we didnâ€™t get very far. Iâ€™m afraid of clients being upset in that scenario.*

Sometimes clients will get upset. It comes with working in the service industry. I will say that have never had a client upset for this reason. They are typically aware if their dog is a slow or reluctant walker. 

*Can you still set your own rates?*

Yes, except for with Rover Now. 

*Can you do walks in two separate parts of the city?* 

You can currently only set one service radius. Alternatively you could set a service radius that covers both Calabasas and West LA. 

*Can you walk two or three dogs at the same time?* 

Rover is focused on individual attention on one dog, or multiple dogs from a single household. However, if your clients agree to it you can walk multiple dogs (from different households) at once. With Rover Now you cannot walk dogs from different households together. 

It takes a while to build up clientele with Rover, so don't count on making much (especially considering COL in LA) the first couple of months. You can start making some money right away with Rover Now, but the payout is low ($12/30 min walk, $18/60 min walk, slightly more for two dogs)."
