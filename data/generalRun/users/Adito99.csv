I don't know that this is true. They like that he's making liberals angry but the *way* he does it is mostly irrelevant. It's why he can break laws, get his supporters saying ""nothing happened,"" then have that lie exposed with no loss of support. The original defense was a means to an end with no integrity behind it. Same with foreign policy, withdrawing troops is good and so is risking a war by assassinating top officials. There is no substance to Trumps populism beyond spite.

Now as far as Bernie--

>demonizing/scapegoating a group of people as a whole that are part of this country.

This may not appeal to you personally but the cause/effect he's pointing out are real. The rich have too much power. That's real. If money is free speech then the 50/50 split of ""free speech"" in this country has 400 people on one side and 330 million on the other. That's real. Compare this problem to the effect immigrants have on the economy.

>I think even if he could, such a seismic reorganization of so many sectors of the economy at one time would cause enormous problems in the short term

Global warming is going to cause more systemic problems than any policy Bernie could propose and try to make happen. His solution might not work because big problems are tough to solve but what we're doing now is 100% guaranteed to fail. It's like we're sliding towards a cliff and grabbing a branch on the way down might not save us so your conclusion is to do nothing."

This doesn't just apply to teens. People usually commit suicide in a moment of crisis, it takes work to psych themselves up to it. The more barriers there are (like having to drive to a bridge) the less likely they will be to go through with it.

That's why gun control would cut down on suicides by such a large margin. No people wouldn't just find another way because guns are by far the simplest  and quickest option."
