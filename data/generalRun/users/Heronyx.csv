What I would like to ask now is why do you keep using the word ""unique"" whilst contradicting yourself by stating that the niche (or in this latest comment domain) is over saturated. How can something which is part of an over saturated genre or whatever be unique?

Unique:  being the only one of its kind; unlike anything else.

That's why I specifically mentioned ""original"" content.

Original  created personally by a particular artist, writer, musician, etc.; not a copy.

For example, the last post about how wealthy people split the payment for a meal. IMHO the post isn't unique in terms of an easy google search showing thousands of similar questions and answers on various websites. You just make generalisation about what you do but where's the story that makes it individual or original? You or whoever could have given a detailed example of a particular instance or instances in which you've had first hand experience.

Your website has both a bookshop and a blog so it's a bit misleading to post it to a blogging subreddit. Anyway the blog is a bit too random.

Your about section reads:

>We are an eBook marketplace with a single mission to bring the best business content to our readers. We work with writers who focus their writing on business, entrepreneurship and education subjects. Reports and eBooks available in the [bookstore](https://hundredfoot.com/bookstore) aim to provide knowledge to our readers in the space of self-improvement, business, and lifestyle.

What is the blog about and who are the target audience? The posts really seems very generic because not enough time has been taken to flesh out personal experiences and make original content. For example your post about La Estancia de Cafayate poses the question as to if it's worth visiting. You then mention that you have visited. You don't say when, nor provide any real details or original photographs. Just a 436 word post which doesn't really answer the question it posed. So if your blog was focusing on a wealthy lifestyle then where is the content that sets it apart from the crowd and will bring in readers?

Even as someone who has had her work pirated, I personally think that google should allow everyone to have ads and then remove when infractions are found but since that isn't the case, I do think that we all need to work harder to be actually unique and original even within our niche markets because obviously mainstream interests and trends help to drive traffic but if the content doesn't make the reader want to stay or come back that is the problem, not over saturation when people are increasingly fanatical and obsessive."

For myself, I'm not really interested in the serial killers themselves. I don't find them to be clever, interesting deep etc. I'm actually very interested in the social changes that have created them in the first place. I'd like to know what exactly it is that has caused this. Is it feminism, industrialisation and with it increased urbanisation? Is it sexual liberation and increased prevalence of homosexuality (given that many of the most prolific serial killers are pederasts or homosexuals who kill males), is it modern warfare and PTSD in their parents? What exactly is the reason for people doing this or are we just calling people serial killers who would have raped and pillaged as mercenaries or soldiers in the past?

Actually remember learning some years ago (I honestly can't remember if it was a book or television show) about how the actual ability to replace hangman / executioners also contributed to the abolition of the death penalty both here and in Europe. After all remember that executioners in the past had low social status and were almost like untouchables in other cultures. You know, since they are legal murderers but not in the James Bond way?

I thought the only bone of contention was what exactly ""Let him have it."" meant. Was it an order to kill or was it a request to hand over the gun?

I'm against the death penalty in general and I certainly am happy that it has been abolished in the UK where I live, but I don't think that at the time 1953, the execution was horrifically unjust. To be honest extrajudicial lynchings in the US which were also happening at the time were considerably worse than a criminal being executed for apparently ordering the murder of a police officer whilst being restrained (not in custody per se).

I think that because Derek Bentley has been described as having a low IQ that it gives a false impression of him as being naive or even thick. That's not what having a low IQ means at all. He wasn't even ruled innocent, that's the saddest part of the idea spread in the media. In fact his conviction was posthumously quashed because the original trial was unfair.

So is your idea of unique writing basically what they described as ""sites that copy content from other sites, modify it slightly... and republish it.""? I ask because the word unique and original do not mean the exact same thing.

1. You're laying out evidence regarding a theory, so basically like writing an essay. For the sake of length knowing that most people do not have very long attention spans I think that it would be ok to break the post up for length so with the introduction and half of the content in one post and the remaining content and conclusion in another post.
2. You're writing a webnovel or short story and are breaking the post up for length.
3. You are making a post about a specific subject, for example ia particular serial killer and the information is so extensive that you need to break the post up into multiple parts.

I wouldn't personally have a problem with any of these situations if the first part informs me that this post will be part of a series. This is actually a very common practice in big and small businesses, serialised fiction, television etc. I don't think it would have a negative impact if you say that it is part of a series but what would have a negative impact is not posting anything for a long time thus giving your readers time to look elsewhere or forget about you.

The main page of the blog loads fine for me in the UK, I didn't notice any problem with the speed until I tried to load the older posts and then... I came back here to type whilst I wait... I don't know how to improve the site speed though sorry. 

As for the layout and format, I think that it is problematic. 

The shade of green that you've used as an accent colour is too bright and I think it can cause eyestrain (it hurt my eyes immediately and I always keep my screen at the lowest brightness due to light sensitivity) because it's a lime green / chartreuse shade quite close to yellow so you're missing out on the beneficial effects you could have gotten if you'd used a shade closer to blue like  #00A59C. Please read this  [https://www.colormatters.com/color-and-vision/color-and-vision-matters](https://www.colormatters.com/color-and-vision/color-and-vision-matters), it's not particularly great but I think it makes the point.

Other than the colour problem, I think the layout is fine but maybe there should be more than four posts on the main page so that the fact that there is plenty of content can be made clear. I know that there is a list at the side but I think the main page looks a bit blank. Maybe the shade of green is so bright that it creates clear demarcation between areas of content and empty space, I'm not sure...

You didn't ask but this is another observation I made so I hope that you don't mind. I can't tell who the target audience is. This wasn't made clear because I don't know the sites you've posted and have no interest in following a think to a second site to find out the genre of the first site. I don't think you should make the assumption that everyone knows about those sites because they don't and it leaves you at a disadvantage.

Also, on  your About page which seems to also be the first post you wrote:

 ""Comment section below is open and questions or queries are encouraged.""

whilst in the post about Driverless Cars you wrote:

"" Saw a post that sparked my interest about driverless cars and their problems on [**Twitter**](https://twitter.com/rationalwalk/status/1207138506688077825) and here we are! ""

This habit of writing as one speaks and also using questions instead of statements as headers makes me think that your blog is supposed to be conversational and is therefore informal. The target audience must be your friends and acquaintances.

If you meant to write for an audience of strangers (again I'm not sure which demographic you had in mind) then surely you would write something like:

""The comment section..."" and ""I saw a post on Twitter regarding driver-less cars and problems relating to them which sparked my interest."""

I had a look and I think it's great. The colour scheme was very comfortable on the eyes and it's well organised in my opinion.

 I read the first chapter of ""The Crash of The Starship Redemption"" and enjoyed it a lot. It certainly encourages one to read more because a lot of questions are raised in the reader's mind. What happened to the ship? How long has it been? Who are they? Where is Osiris Six? etc. It reminds me of a bit of a Philip K. Dick story that I read some time ago but can't remember the name of.

Have you thought about the advertising of your work? You mentioned on your About page that you're also a musician. Had you considered making music for each story? If you did something like that then you might be able to link the posts to youtube or Soundcloud then you can share your work to social bookmarking sites like pinterest and because many people are attracted by sensory stimulation it might bring in more traffic.

For example I was thinking that your piece ""Interlude (Instrumental)"" in some ways suits the almost desolate mood of the survivors in the story mentioned above.

Blogging,fddkyc9,t3_ekl5vy,1578316258.0,"I think that it depends on who the readers are, how good your writing skill is (can you express your point concisely and is it interesting) and if the people are particularly interested in your genre or subject matter.

The point is not about quantity in my opinion but quality.

I love reading but I'm not so obsessed with it that I'll read something that I consider to be poorly written or otherwise outside of my realms of interest. Even if I can see it's only short, if I'm not interested at all that's it. Once I had to commit the sin of throwing away a book because it was that terribly... I still feel guilty about it.

On the other hand, if something is very interesting or well written, I prefer something lengthy (you know since it's quite rare).

I think that you need to consider certain factors when choosing the length of your pieces:

1)Have you said all that you need to say without too much repetition? I don't know about others but I don't like reading the same point over and over merely because someone has a word limit to reach.

2)Will readers get visual strain reading your posts?  Although the internet gives us access to lots of lengthy pieces of writing not all devices are designed for reading comfort and eyestrain is an side effect. The design of your blog could impact if people are able to maintain focus. For example I have a migraine right now so my screen has a grayscale filter on it to reduce colours. Other people have other visual issues and might find certain colour schemes problematic. They might be able to struggle through a short post but not a longer one.

3)Who exactly is your target audience? If your target audience are people within your socio-economic class than they might have similar ability to read as you. However if your target audience is an average American then I think that you need to consider that literacy and comprehension rates in the USA are quite low and therefore the larger portion of your audience will not be able to appreciate the lengthy piece. Why do you think that books in the YA or young adult genre are so popular because the simplistic writing style is accessible to the widest majority.

There are more factors to look at than merely what is recommended, one needs to know the basis for the recommendation and boredom is only a tiny factor."
Blogging,fddjme4,t1_fclzxbq,1578314873.0,"Sorry for the late response, I don't use reddit very often.

In regards to the pictures, I don't personally think that there is anything wrong with not having a picture for each post but I think it is the general trend to illustrate posts so it puts you at a disadvantage in relation to others. I think that in our society at the moment there is a great trend to over simplify everything and to cater to demands even if you want to be more individual. There's a saying when it comes to food that ""the first bite is with the eye"". I think it's similar in posting to the internet. Imagery and graphics definitely play a key role in attracting reader attention and building interest. The only instances I can think of in my 22+ years online where a website with few pictures is popular would be translations of foreign novels into English or other languages.

Another aspect to consider is that if you don't have pictures for each post then advertising a post is harder. One of the easiest ways to help yourself to gain more readers would be to post links to your work on instagram, pinterest and other media sharing websites but if you don't have an image then you're at a instant disadvantage.

science,fddf360,t3_ekmj1w,1578309375.0,"I don't think the article or study had a wide enough pool of people to come to any conclusions. The article obviously takes the most interesting parts such as:

> Women who considered themselves attractive also tended to dress less revealingly when meeting a prospective new female friend. But this was not the case when attractive women were told they would be meeting with an existing female friend. Women who considered themselves as less attractive, on the other hand, tended to dress more revealingly when meeting a prospective compared to an existing female friend. 

It doesn't explain if the female friend is more attractive, about equal or less attractive than the woman participating in the study. From my personal experience though it's much more complex than the simplified conclusions mentioned in the article. For example I think women tend to make friends with other women who have similar looks or body shape to themselves just as previously when women would mostly be around their family or similar ethnicity so everyone looked more or less similar.

I think that the people mentioned don't have multiracial friendship groups because from my personal experience as a non white multiracial person, even if you make friends with a generally similar body shape, like in my case I know that having large breasts is a major problem for a lot of less well endowed women (they'll deny it but that's my personal experience of bullying and abuse), so I tend to only be friends with women who are above a G cup so they can understand me. I mean when you can't even get your bra in a shop, or your bra is so heavy that your shoulders are destroyed women who don't have that problem simply can't understand. Just as a woman with light menstruation can't understand women who have problematic periods and get dragged to the brink of death every month.

Even though all of my friends have been naturally busty women, since most of them were white Anglo-saxons and I'm a multiracial person originating in the West Indies, the fat distribution elsewhere was different so I have slender ankles, calves and arms but thicker thighs and buttocks but their ankles, calves and arms were thick with flatter buttocks with more fat on the lower abdomen, so it was a problem when shopping. Let alone choosing what outfit to wear because one would be abused. 

Then there was the texture of my hair that was a problem. I have very soft, fluffy hair natural ringlets which they likened to sheep's wool... and this is even after I was voted as ""one of the guys"" and they were franked as females by our classmates at university. I never had a boyfriend during the time I was friends with these girls, actually I was a virgin so there was no outright competition for men. They had multiple men, I did not. What was their motive?

My point is that there is significantly more to modest dressing or how one presents oneself or even intrasexual aggression than whether it is a stranger or a ""friend"" and I do think that some sort of pack mentality comes into play. The entire study only had 584 women in total and quite frankly there's no mention of their socio-economic class, age, weight, if they are actually attractive or merely think they are (so mental health) etc. In my personal experience there is more intrasexual aggression from people one knows who are more likely to be in real sexual competition. 

Realistically I would think that when a woman goes out alone or to a new place she dresses modestly out of fear of sexual assault or rape. Not insults from some random. When a woman knows she'll be meeting friends she might be more confident of safety in numbers. I think the conclusions are very misleading as presented in the article and quite frankly it seems like a load of crap.

> “More specifically, women are deeply rational and strategic; women are aware of the threats posed by others and act in ways to avoid those threats. Here, for example, we show that women are aware that appearing and/or dressing certain ways make them more likely targets of other women’s aggression, and that, in situations where this knowledge is salient, and for women most at risk of incurring aggression, women then choose to dress in ways might help them avoid others women’s slings and arrows.” 

So the thousands of years worth of literature about the sexual competition between women or the resourcefulness/craftiness of women didn't make this a known fact?"

I think the comment box is too obscure. I personally didn't see it until I was looking at perhaps the third post and I think comments are a good way to build a fan base."

1. The font is nice and the layout is ok. I can read it without eyestrain so it is inviting in that way but yes it is too minimalistic because the posts don't have any pictures which is somewhat unappealing if one does not know the subject matter in the title.
2. The subscribe button looks good IMHO.
3. Yes. I think that not only should you ""link"" the podcast aka provide references, you should also give some sort of explanation as to what you're writing about. For example I have no idea who Brene Brown is or what ""Brene Brown: The Call to Courage"" is.  Since your blog provided no information I had to go and look it up. This is actually incredibly annoying since the first thing one understand when writing an easy is to assume the reader's ignorance and explain. Instead you've assumed intelligence of something that quite frankly there is no reason to assume anyone would be aware of. You could have added a simple introduction like this: Brene Brown: The Call to Courage is a 2019 drama documentary directed by Sandra Restrepo and starring Brene Brown, a research professor at the University of Houston.

I don't know if I'm supposed to make this comment but I'm quite a down to earth person and your blog seems somewhat pretentious. I wouldn't read it especially because there's really no explanation of who you are or why anyone should pay attention to your opinions which long story short is what it's about. You make note or give observations based on your subjective interests. What exactly is the target audience? 

You said "" The goal is to be **intentional** in my knowledge consumption. To **slow down**, take notes, digest, and formulate my own thoughts and opinions.""

That's what most people do, we all go to school, temples, museums, galleries and other educational facilities hoping to acquire knowledge on specific subjects but we also obviously learn subliminally through environmental exposure. It's not something one can help because humans are great apes and live in communities not normally in isolation where we can completely monitor our input. 

Also if the goal is all about your knowledge consumption and you formulating your own ideas, why isn't this a private journal rather than a public blog? Again, who is the target audience?"

1. The posts and website as a whole look very sleek and professional so yes they are engaging. As to their helpfulness, I don't think they are to me personally. I think people should eat their native diets that their bodies have adapted to (also living in our native habitats would help too), none of the food mentioned are native to where my ancestors are from so it's not particularly helpful for me but for Europeans and those of European heritage I think it would be.
2. Hmm, not really. In my humble opinion the banner at the top with the search bar is too large. If I am visiting a site either physical or digital for the first time I think to see information about it or know where I'm going. In order to get the first piece of information or content one has to scroll down which may or may not encourage clicking.
3. No, I would not expect to see more nutritional research articles on there because your ""Work With Me"" section suggests that you live in the USA. Your country's literacy rate is something like 86% and apparently 50% of adults can not comprehend anything written for children over 14 so since your target audience is obviously Americans I wouldn't expect to see anything too complex since this would discourage the large audience you likely want to attract. If you're going to simplify the information for the average consumer will you also take legal responsibility if someone who isn't necessarily competent or sane takes your nutritional information too far to their detriment? Being sued is a realistic issue this could create.

Lastly, I think you should use the picture from your Work With Me page on the front page as it's more attractive than the one currently there IMHO.  

I hope this helps."
Blogging,fck6lww,t1_fciu5q5,1577718045.0,"Hey,

I'm new here but I just had a look at your site and read a few of the stories. I would say that in my struggle to find any sort of feedback for my stories 

*(I've been publishing my works in one place or another since 2015 but never gotten* ***any*** *other comments then on one subreddit where people were annoyed that I wrote a short fanfiction for a game on an otherwise mostly abandoned sub, and on a writers facebook group where one person said that she couldn't read my work because apparently in her mind a one sentence paragraph can't exist. Somehow my books have been digitally pirated though so that's bizarre)* 

what I found is that even if lots of people do like your work or read it, they tend to wait for others to comment before saying anything on the other side of this are the other writers / wannabes who will condescendingly ignore your work if they see errors. I think that some of the typos in your work for example in ""Old Man Eddie"" you wrote:

>“Well, I’m afraid, I guess.” said Eddie

In fact this is not correct. It should be """"Well, I'm afraid I guess,"" said Eddie"" or """"Well... I'm afraid, I guess,"" said Eddie.""

This is a mistake I often make when typing and then have to go back and correct. If you examine some books you'll see that in dialogue, unless there is another type of punctuation mark like a ! or ? then it's a continuation of the sentence and therefore takes a comma not a full stop.

I personally think that you need to pay for some kind of advertising and/or also create some other kind of media to advertise your works. An instagram, pinterest, youtube channel etc. 

As for the look of the site, I found it a bit difficult to read. You should consider readability when choosing a font and colour scheme. I think the black on white writing is a bit too stark of a contrast for my light sensitive eyes. Also the font might be too large. 

Lastly another thought I have is which genre are these stories in and what is the ultimate purpose / target audience of them? It was somewhat hard to tell."
serialkillers,f9pdbc2,t1_f9p8sm8,1575530554.0,"School shooters are not serial killers. They are terrorists. 

They tend to use high calibre weapons, sometimes have IEDs too (like at Columbine but thankfully these didn't work, though copycats have also tried) and they target their peers not necessarily those who bullied or did anything to them with the objective of instilling fear in the minds of the public so that they can gain fame. 
They are terrorists. 
A serial killer generally speaking doesn't have an objective about anyone else but seeks to gratify themselves."
