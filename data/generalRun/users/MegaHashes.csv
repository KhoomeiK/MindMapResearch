webhosting,fh99ue2,t3_f1iu23,1581376352.0,"Handling configuration and updates particularly with databases on your own server is not an easy task for a novice. Not sure what your application is, but you'll find ram getting quickly chewed up by your database needs, and your performance will start to choke unless you increase the size of your VPS. Linux VPS capable of supporting a minimal mysql installation is going to be around $5/mo for a 1v core/512GB ram instance. Cpanel like what your used to using to make easy web management possible is $15-$20/mo/instance overtop of that. $25/mo buys a lot of managed/shared web-hosting elsewhere that's so much less hassle if you don't already have the skills for this. That said, if it's something you want to learn how to do, don't let me discourage you. You DO you."

TooAfraidToAsk,fh4yo3c,t1_fh42nkr,1581283290.0,">	So if you live in a rich area you might pay a much lower percentage of your home value than someone who lives in a lower value area. 

Not sure where you live or what the tax laws are like, but in MD it’s a flat percentage of assessed value based on the county you live in, with a couple small carve outs for high poverty or development targeted areas. 

In Baltimore County the tax rate is $1.10 per $100 assessed value regardless of if your home is $50,000 ($550/yr) or $5,000,000 ($55,000/yr). 

Percentage is the same across the board. Essentially property tax is a flat tax."

Owners of expensive homes pay more property taxes

They get to send their kids to better funded schools for free

It’s not free if you pay more in property taxes, is it?

Hell, the section 8 elementary school near my area was one of the nicest new schools until this year when they finally finished rebuilding the old asbestos filled school that *my* property taxes have funded for the last decade."
Picard,fh069ou,t3_ezqs5g,1581200784.0,"I liked the first two episodes, but this one was awful. I don’t remember a single character ever smoking anything that wasn’t required to breathe, and she drinks like an alcoholic.

So many questionable choices for dialog: “JL”? “You have to take me with you! I’m the foremost expert on” (cringe)? 

The guy gets a piece of metal pulled out of his shoulder that clearly severed his collar bone, but acts like ‘tis but a scratch’. Unintentionally comical. 

Glad they finally got off the planet, but I hope this episode was a fluke. I was nice to see the ‘Engage’ but felt too telegraphed.

Wished they had brought the two Chateau Romulan characters. I think they have really great chemistry with Stewart. They do a great job of giving that we’ve been together for 5 seasons now vibe just in this episode. That fight seen was probably my favorite part. 

Absolutely floored with the quality of CGI and set design on this show. Just wished they had the same love for it in the writing dept."

Plenty of places to discuss business that don’t have a bed no more than 30ft away. 

In this context anyone asking you to meet them alone in a hotel room is very likely DTF and hopes you are too. 

Pretending otherwise is just... acting.

So, it’s ugly, but these adult women made choices that contributed to their assaults. It doesn’t mean they were ‘asking for it’, but the choices should be called out anyway.

We came up on a car that was kind of swerving gently in his own lane, saw an old man passed out or sleeping at the wheel, car is on cruise. My dad used to have legitimate air horns on his van blew his horns to wake the guy up. Blowing 90db until the air tank exhausted, and still this guy didn’t wake up. 

We’re going like 55 down the highway, no phone to call the cops, no way to stop the car without killing someone, we had to just pass him and keep going. That shit still bothers me. Wish we could have done more. No idea what happened after we got way down the road from him, but I like to think he woke up.
