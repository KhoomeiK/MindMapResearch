Also, brees is notoriously guarded in his answers, never wanting to accidentally say the wrong thing and that's just when talking *football*.

These guys *were on the backs of elephants*. Like as in three fucking elephants. They had about two or three guys (all trained professionals) on the back of each elephant. So basically you had six or so trained hunters on the backs of three elephants all ACTIVELY LOOKING AT ALL TIMES for a tiger. So they're in this tall-ish grassy area, but nothing CLOSE to tall or thick enough to hide a fucking tiger sneaking up on them or so I thought (really no other cover except grass). Then suddenly out of nowhere, maybe four feet away from one of the elephants this fucking orange blur just explodes out of...somewhere...straight up until it's fucking vertically *level with the people on the backs of the elephant*. Like 10-12 feet straight up. Short story shorter, tiger got away with three of one of the hunters fingers and not so much as a missing whisker.
