depression,fg8bbpo,t1_fg89jud,1580614574.0,"I'm not really looking for advice, I know what I have to do, and for the most I'm doing it. Its just a slog. I feel like I'm running 1000 marathons with weights on my legs and a gun in my back.

I was raised Catholic, but ""lost"" my religion in my teens. I know that people find solace and fortitude in their religion, and I think that's great. I just know there's no shelter there for me.

Honestly, this is me reaching out there. I talk to my friends about it, but I can't just keep going to the well. They're great friends, but everyone has the point where they're just dried up, so I try no to do it all of the time. I had the urge to post this on my Facebook account, but did it here instead. I'll confide in close friends or complete strangers, but I'm not calling out to acquaintances for public performance.

This is just me shouting out into the void."

astoria,fei0vbn,t3_ep7or8,1579127849.0,If I ever saw this while trying to park in Astoria I would have a fucking conniption.
depression,fegpq1o,t3_eoxun3,1579099612.0,"When my therapist suggested meds, I actually said that I didn't know if I wanted to take them, because I would miss my depression.

That's what made me try them. Things aren't perfect, but they're ok. I have a lot of heavy shit going on, but I'm maintaining.

We all know depression is insidious, it feels like it's a part of you, that it defines you. Sometimes I think that's why it's so hard to try to deal with it.

I hope you get to enjoy the good stuff."
