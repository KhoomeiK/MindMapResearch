pcmasterrace,ffar16k,t1_ff9d3ua,1579742474.0,Don’t buy an amd card. That’s coming from someone using a 3800x and an r580. the rx580 is a beast really but the 5700xt is a hit or miss especially how the drivers are right now. Nvidia card just work like a charm and the 3000 series is coming. Also if you’re interested in selling me that 1060 I need something to use for now until I buy an nvidia 3000. I gave my brother my 580 feelsbad.
buildapc,ffao0cq,t3_eskrfm,1579740443.0,I just bought a 3800x and for it I bought an asus x470 crosshair vii hero for 200 LE...pretty solid deal if you ask me.

apexlegends,ff993ov,t1_ff98yq3,1579707675.0,You’ll get there. Just pop a ryzen 5 1600 in a cheap b450 motherboard with 8 gigs of ddr4s no rgb and you’ll have plenty of cash for a good gpu.

only thing left is a gpu which I’m waiting for the nvidia 3000 series to buy one. you’re not alone."
apexlegends,ff98nak,t1_ff98j1x,1579707385.0,If I had the cash I would’ve bought a pc for every controller player to compensate for their suffering.

buildapc,ff889w2,t1_ff86st7,1579668876.0,I’d spend a couple more bucks for the nzxt x52 240mm I believe it’s 125 right now. Looks better performs better and u can get a pack of ezdiy moonlight 6fans if u want rgb and you’re good to go.
pcmasterrace,ff885y9,t1_ff7weeb,1579668782.0,I strongly suggest you go for a ryzen cpu and a 2060 laptop. intel is just not the buy right now I bought an i5 9600k and then a 3800x and the 3800x is just beautiful and far more versatile. workwise ryzen just trumps nvidia and future proof gaming with the hyperthreading. single core performance is still intel tho.
apexlegends,ff8758n,t1_ff7z1c6,1579667906.0,"They’re upset because some of them are new and you’re ruining their games to get your ego off. A typical bully, Acts tough but is quick to retreat once confronted."
apexlegends,ff86vk2,t3_es5hub,1579667680.0,Frankly I’ve never had people leave on me once I grab their banners. You just have to prove yourself in the early game I’m almost always the kill leader this past month and people will stick around to either watch or be revived if you show them you can carry them to victory.
buildapc,ff86ouv,t1_ff80c0m,1579667523.0,"I would say sell the 2080 before it gets released so you can sell it at a higher price,nvidia seems to drop prices right now it hit the 2060 and soon the 2070 will follow so I suggest you quickly sell your 2070 before it goes for 350$."

pcmasterrace,ff80knc,t1_ff80ert,1579662861.0,smart man. I couldn’t justify buying a corsair ll120 they’re just too damn expensive.
buildapc,ff80hi3,t1_ff80ee6,1579662797.0,diff strokes for diff folks man. I prefer a little rgb on my stuff and I prefer it to not block the view of my parts.
pcmasterrace,ff80ak9,t1_ff8065b,1579662660.0,I’m going with the edziy moonlight fans for my deepcool matrexx 55 and my kraken x52 nzxt aio. They look really elegant like the ll120s and tamer than the hd120d and they cost 40 bucks for a 6pack.
pcmasterrace,ff804sv,t3_es5lw2,1579662543.0,finally a built that doesn’t have corsair ll120.
buildapc,ff7zy8h,t1_ff7zeja,1579662408.0,Except it’s super ugly. If this guy is going for a rainbowish aio then he must care about aesthetics.

buildapc,ff7zak3,t3_es5qyt,1579661945.0,Do not buy anything right now and wait for nvidia’s 3000 series! keep the 2070 for now and wait till march !
exmuslim,ff6cdfe,t3_erwrsl,1579624118.0,To become a vegan is to reject reality. The most Basic truth of our world is for something to live something else must die and it has always been survival of the fittest. The animals you are so eager to save eat other animals and the plants you are so eager to eat feel pain and are living breathing creatures just like you. You would sacrifice your physical prowess...your mental sternity wanting to find purpose in life ? how about providing food for children in Africa or doing some actual good towards humans in this world ? there are fellow human beings who are still suffering and you’re concerned about animals ? Please don’t pretend like I’m attacking you and try to sieze the moral highground and respond to my argument like an adult.
pcmasterrace,ff39ou3,t1_ff39hs4,1579536965.0,I’ve just ordered an nzxt kraken 240mm. I’ve been builing a pc for around 2 years now buying part after part.I have a 3800x and I’ve been thinking about coolers alot ... is getting a watercooler that risky ?

Aceu ? Diego ? mendo ? siv ? I don’t know anyone past 1k viewers ? They never ever wait for randoms to res them unless the random is good and not a loot goblin."
apexlegends,ff0oa8h,t1_ff0ne5a,1579470731.0,Civil ? you dare say that word ? There are kids dying of starvation in Africa while you’re whinning about a skin in a video game. You’re spending money on a video game while they can’t find money to eat and you have the audacity to complain. Let that sink in and then come and tell me to be civil. I know you hate being confronted with your bullshit because you are too entitled to admit being wrong but that will never make you right.
apexlegends,ff0m0q8,t3_eqzqhy,1579470169.0,Can’t you see how many dowvotes you’re getting? that’s how much of a brat you are. Jesus just play the video game.

offmychest,fezoxpw,t1_fezo487,1579459835.0,"With more testosterone in your system you’ll be more confident and more calm. You’ll perform better under pressure and build more muscle more quickly. You’ll just feel better in your skin and people who say testosterone makes you violent and whatnot are just feminists who envy us for having it naturally while they have to inject it trying to make themselves as strong as men.
It took me years to get where I am and drop the body anxiety thing and it’ll take you quite some time but don’t despair it does go away but you need to work for it."
offmychest,fezo017,t1_feznn12,1579459515.0,"Look it up I can’t remember but it seems everyone with moobs has that in common,chicken abuse. Either way it goes away as long as you’re a man with normal testosterone levels. Do you drink soy milk ? it’s debatable but I really believe it has something to do with the feminization of men and the huge increase in moob removal surgeries."
offmychest,feznbnh,t1_fezn4kr,1579459286.0,I don’t remember exactly it was either the skin on it or the meat itself that caused estrogen increase and I know that for a fact because I eat a fuckton of chicken.
offmychest,fezms89,t1_fezljji,1579459106.0,"It was a normal mammary duct enlargement which is not uncommon during puberty with the hormonal hawyer, Increased estrogen does that to you but after a few years it drops on it’s own. It finally went away after 7 years but here’s how you can speed it up. See a nutritionist and set up a diet that increases testosterone and reduces estrogen production in your body which would mean no more chicken wings and skin,more protein and nuts maybe even take meds that increase your testosterone and reduces estrogen. Working out also increases testosterone."
apexlegends,fezltyf,t3_er0392,1579458773.0,Holy shit
buildapc,fezl76p,t3_eqzngy,1579458519.0,I’m currently sitting on 500$ waiting for the 3000 series. I wish there was an AMD card worth the buy but the truth is their gpus are just hit or miss... nvidia gpus are more reliable and newer is always better.

offmychest,fezj7oh,t3_eqzsyf,1579457908.0,"I feel you man. I’ve been mocked for my moobs and I’ve been through it all. It was not until I punched the last guy who said it unconscious did people stop joking about it. It’s a sad truth of the world but it’s always been and will always be hunt or be hunted. If you can’t defend yourself and assert dominance you’ll be a target. My moobs are gone but I’m still body conscious and feel very uncomfortable when my fucking mother touches me. It all comes down to one thing,people don’t put themselves in other people’s places and are only aware of what they experience. You’re saying all of that because you’ve been there but you’ve most certainly judged other people and ran over them when you haven’t been in their place, We all do it we just don’t know it.
Edit: and yes body positivity people are just a bunch of entitled irresponsible first world morons who can’t stop stuffing fucking donuts down their throats so they blame society. If you have a medical condition fine but it’s still not something to be positive about it’s a fucking illness something that isnt right it’s not homosexuality it’s a health issue."

offmychest,fezb3z8,t3_eqy2op,1579455571.0,How did he walk into your house ? did he break in ?
apexlegends,fezanvn,t1_fez2r35,1579455409.0,"Fully agreed. If he wants teammates he should squad up instead of blaming randoms for not wanting to waste their time watching him loot the same house 3 times over. We’re not playing this game to socialize I’m a med student I don’t have the luxury of time to sit and watch If I’m on my pc I want action. If you’re good enough trust me I’ll always stick around and wait for you to res me and I’d even watch you till the end but if I left good chance you’re just a boring loot goblin and I can’t rely on you. You’ll either res me so we can die together anyway or you won’t and you’ll die alone a boring death getting ran down.
Big streamers like aceu and diego and pretty much every single streamer out there leaves every game after they get downed and no one bats an eye."
offmychest,fez663v,t1_fez5vas,1579454184.0,It’s good that you understand that. But the part where you said how your husband made you feel bad about your depression gave me the impression that you didn’t love him all that much.
buildapc,feyuy63,t3_eqy6d4,1579450845.0,"No cpu will be good enough for that budget. Don’t be greedy and find the best cpu for the buck you’re willing to spend.
The choice is almost always ryzen with low budget pcs so you’ll 100% go for ryzen 5 1600.
Saving enough money for a gpu is essential. with a 1600 you’ll be able to get yourself an amd rx570/580. don’t buy a fancy case or anything rgb just bland efficent stuff."
offmychest,feyumyv,t3_eqtea1,1579450733.0,I think you should start taking your fate into your own hands or you’ll never be happy again. Either let that friend go for good and move on with your life which I don’t recommend or tell him how much you love him...throw yourself in his arms and cry and big ol ugly river of tears and trust me no weep will feel as good. You made a mistake when you got married to someone you don’t love but it’s never too late.
pcmasterrace,fexbd8d,t1_fexap51,1579428086.0,So what about the deepcool rf120?
pcmasterrace,fexa9kr,t1_fex9i7a,1579427596.0,From what I head corsair fans are very quiet ?
pcmasterrace,fewn2j1,t3_eqst62,1579415310.0,I can’t even bring myself to buy a single corsair LL fan. Shit’s too expensive to have it shipped and taxed.
PUBGMobile,fevuje1,t1_fespzfz,1579401685.0,Actually there are cheaters in every region americans and europeans are not saints. But the truth is arabs and indians and asians are the vast majority. They’re just undereducated and they don’t understand honor.
PUBGMobile,fevu5n3,t1_fetbr5a,1579401541.0,Man it’s really fun watching how entitled first world kids are. You’re even entitled to being kind and you have the luxury to imagine the world a utopia. I live in a third world country and youth can’t find jobs here. I’m in medschool and every guy my age in my country lives with his parents our culture does not see it as a bad thing because youth can’t suatain a life of their own with the lack of jobs and payment. Your first world country has so much money to give you you literally don’t even need to finish your college ed and u can drop out and still make as much money as my father who is a doctor who worked his ass off his entire life and carved into stone to get where he is. He is a racist asshole but he worked hard and your entitled ass can’t understand that. I’m studying 10 hours a day and sometimes not sleeping 3 days in a row and I still have to apply for a license outside of my third world shithole to get paid properly and a first world brat like you comes to reddit and calls me a loser who lives with his parents. I’d love to put you in my country and see how well you fare you dropout worthless scum.
PUBGMobile,fes2pqa,t3_eqfk9g,1579360810.0,And this is why Indians and arabs and every third world country should be region locked. I’m an arab and I’m ashamed of how devoid of honor and basic human decency my people are. My dad  says chritsians will go to hell daily proudly.
freefolk,fer03rh,t1_fequajz,1579348014.0,Do you mean to say she slept with them ?
nvidia,fep8tq6,t3_eq89up,1579314717.0,Which fans are those ?
freefolk,femk9im,t1_femjovp,1579259817.0,"Not all of them. Peter,kit,Emilia (who is not as affected but she still thinks it was garbage)and varys’s actor and barristan. They were all visibly upset and hinted at how pissed they were in interviews but they could never flat out say it and risk the career butcher. Varys is the one who seems most annoyed he actually puts down the script paper and daydreams during their conference. Barristan’s actor mcgsomething is an old man who probably doesn’t care as much about his future career as the rest of the young actors he has had a career and he did well for himself so he said how D&D disrespected him and killed off his character,mocked him for sending them a message in an old fashioned letter,it was really sad.
As for maisie and sophie they’re the ones I despise the most. D&D with their sjw pandering seem to be feeding their egos and they’re really enjoying it. The smug looks on their faces in the show and interviews are just infuriating and sophie had the audacity to publicly insult the petition fans. I hope that made her lose a good chunk of her fans but I know most of her fans are thirsty for her anyway they’d probably love her more if she humiliated them further."
exmuslim,femgt74,t1_femg0k2,1579254777.0,no but it’s going to make me feel better and him feel worse. I won’t build up inner anger for a douche I have enough on my plate. Maybe your life is easy and you don’t have to worry about much and being kind comes easy for you. Either way mine isn’t and you shouldn’t go around assuming everyone is capable of being kind to dicks as easily as you.

Why do I have to treat an asshole kindly? I treat people how they treat me the world is not black and white dude. We don’t live in a utopia be realistic.

I do stand by my point that he makes emotional decisions and it’s proven by him not wanting to hear or argue. He just called me judgemental and sulked away.
