I love this medicine.  I got my BMI down to 24.9. Been on it for years. Kept the weight off except when my co worker brought in candy constantly and I gained 10 pounds. Very happy when she went on maternity leave.  Weight is coming off. My blood pressure is no longer high. Life is better.  Nausea is real but I also take a SSRI that's famous for its nausea producing  side effect. Ondansetron for nausea is great.  I'm always constipated. I  drink  metamucil daily."

Also I take ondansetron every day because I also take trintellix which is really hard on my stomach and the combination of the saxenda and the trintellix makes me really nauseous.
