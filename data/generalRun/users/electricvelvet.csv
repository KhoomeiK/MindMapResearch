sports,fezh9o7,t1_few50uq,1579457334.0,"I highly doubt there are millions of people capable of doing what he is doing. Most people find out if they are athletically inclined growing up because at least in america, every boy has some experience playing sports. And the vast majority who are athletically inclined who really want to be pro athletes and put all their effort into doing so still fail. Even though they train just as hard, most people in peak physical condition are inferior to the select few pro athletes in peak condition. 

In my opinion, it is more unnecessary to discuss training because training is not the unattainable thing that separates pros from amateurs. It is natural ability that is of course realized through training that causes the separation. If we're discussing the different levels of ability between two pros at the top of their game, then sure, one who trains harder than the other might be superior because of that training. But the dichotomy between a pro and an amateur is due to the natural ability of the former.

Actually, i guess we dont really disagree on too much: the main disagreement seems to be whether people of such capabilities are relatively common (millions) or extraordinarily rare (hundreds or thousands). I do think it is unrealistic to hold that the only thing preventing millions of people from being professional athletes is their work ethic, and not their genetic limits. But then again how can either of us prove this? We really can't, so I suppose I can't say any more about it."

todayilearned,fdxv2en,t1_fdxlp6m,1578773205.0,"Lol, I was just carrying on your video game scenario. But come on, be real. If you repeatedly use drugs to do the things mentioned in your post to change how you feel instead of just using things recreationally, you can easily become physically dependent. If you use opiates whenever you have pain, you become dependent. If every time you experience nerves you take a benzo you're at risk of developing dependence. If you regularly dont get enough sleep and use amphetamines as a crutch you may become psychologically dependent. And you certainly will throw your neurotransmitters out of whack and feel the need to take them more. Sure, if it's an every once in awhile thing, it's fine. But anyone that is using those pharmaceuticals regularly to manipulate how they feel for functionality reasons is at high risk of developing dependence. MOST drug users don't use them for those things, at least not regularly. Even if you are not physically dependent you can become mentally dependent on them as a crutch. That's not even mentioning the health consequences of long term usages---stimulants are rough on the heart and benzos increase your risk of developing alzheimers and dementia, even when using them as prescribed if you do so long term.

How do you feel about testing the power tubes by first pulling the inside pair and testing volume, then doing the outside pair? Is it better to go ahead and buy a new set? 

I will wait until I've tested all the tubes, but i suspect i will at some point open up the chassis and check on all the caps. I also wanna see what all looks original and whats been replaced. There is a three prong power cord so at some point, someone did some work on it."

Also, the overdrive sounded like shit, but the overdrive may just sound like shit to me in fender tube amps. 

Do you think pulling the inside tubes and then the outside pair of tubes is an acceptable way to test them, or do I need to buy some spares? That would not be ideal if theyre still good, but i can do so. I do have plenty of 12ax7's in my other amps that i know are good. So i can swap out the preamp tubes that way. Although i know i can use 12ax7's in place of the 12at7's, because of the fact that they won't sound right, I'm not sure i would be able to identify the problem--i guess if it's hella loud with the new tube, that may answer it, though.
