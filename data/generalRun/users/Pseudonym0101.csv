They really need to invent a non-addictive, somehow non-opiate solution. Something better than buprenorphine or methadone. 

I believe people in active addiction (especially of the opiate variety) are truly sick and should be treated as such. It just gets real tricky dealing with the ones who don't want to stop or won't accept help :("
