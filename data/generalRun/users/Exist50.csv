First, on the topic of general performance competitiveness, yes, Apple's chips are competitive with Intel's in single threaded performance at a fraction of the power. Think it's about a 5x perf/watt difference between the A12X and Whiskey Lake. Intel does maintain a slight edge in some cases by virtue of a high turbo boost, but that of course comes at a tremendous power cost. You can turn off turbo and get much better power numbers, but then you create a significant performance gap.  

As for the whole RISC vs CISC thing, that discussion really is dead these days. As an illustrative example, if you compare the number of SPECint instructions for ARM vs x86 with similar compiler settings, they're almost exactly equal. It's honestly shocking how close they are. Now, I guess I should mention that technically x86 has higher code density, courtesy primarily of its very flexible instruction length, but not many users care about that (with a few important exceptions), and it must certainly cause headaches for the architects. Instead of RISC vs CISC, a more productive discussion would be ARM vs x86, or perhaps even just the value of legacy. The x86 ISA in particular has built up a lot of crap over the years that everyone knows is garbage (looking at you, MMX), but there's the expectation that once code is compiled, it should be able to run till the heat death of the universe, so this stuff sticks around. In any case, however, I don't think that ISA difference is all that important here. Quibbling over the smaller details.

To BandeetoX86's credit, however, there is the matter of special classes of instructions like AVX[2, 512]. There's a lot of effort put into these instructions, and they have a disproportionate impact on die size. I seem to remember someone once saying an AVX-512 unit was as big as a full Atom core. For most consumer workloads, the benefit is negligible, but there are definitely some professional or niche use cases that can substantially benefit. The trouble is that it can mean non-trivial modifications to the code, and at minimum a recompile. Intel in particular spends a lot of software effort trying to get milage out of new instructions, and so you'll see them leveraged in Intel-provided math libraries and the like. I'm not particularly sold on this whole strategy, but it's at least what we have for now. 

As for what this all means for Apple's products, who the hell knows. There's a very complicated question of software support, product development cost, long term performance projections, integration benefits, and consumer purchasing considerations that all need to be factored in, and I can't begin to say where exactly Apple will fall, short term or otherwise. I'd imagine it's a very hotly debated topic within Apple themselves. My personal prediction is more along the lines of BandeetoX86's (i.e. ARM for low end, consumer-oriented, x86 for Pro), but that's a justification for another comment."

All else equal maybe, but when you have superior gate delay, you don't need extreme voltages. Similar end result in terms of clock frequency, with dramatically different power implications. 

> At stock? 

Yes, at stock. When you see those 5GHz boost clocks, how do you think those are possible? Think about whatever voltage you'd need for that to be a stable overclock, then add more on top as guardband.

> Not entirely, that seems more to do with some more 14nm polishing and Skylake-X style software boost

> Are you really going to argue that the performance capability of TSMC's 7nm is comparable to Intel's 14nm?

Yes, actually. I think, for starters, that the architectural component is being quite significantly undervalued. But more to the point, 14nm's only advantage is its ability to survive extremely high voltages. What do the latest chips use? Something like 1.4V? Utter insanity. But the thing is that pretty much the only major market that cares about that kind of behavior is the enthusiast desktop market. It's damn near useless for everything else because of the power draw. At any sane, useful voltages, I'd imagine N7 sweeps the floor in terms of frequency. But beyond that, I would bet that if Skylake was ported to N7 with decent tuning, it would perform better even for desktop chips than 14nm Skylake.
