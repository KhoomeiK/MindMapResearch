selfimprovement,fcu7kfe,t3_eixloq,1577974433.0,"the only time i have had major success was in getting better about sleeping more and procrastinating less. this happened at the beginning of my freshman year in college. i think the environmental change is what helped most, along with making new friends who share my new, healthier habits. i haven't personally been successful in any other circumstances, but that doesn't mean it isn't possible. i believe in you!!"

It is natural and might even be good. There are good people out there. A few (or even many) negative experiences are not representative of every possibility :) Protect yourself, but don't close yourself off from potential happiness!"
Coffee,fcqa4x4,t1_fcq9fms,1577881944.0,"I have also worked in a cafe, and some of my more experienced coworkers had issues with the layout/organization. They wrote out some changes they wanted and brought them up to the manager. Some were implemented, and they dealt with the other things they didn't like."
Coffee,fcq8ux8,t3_eihepv,1577881184.0,"ask the manager if s/he will accept some input. ideally, do this together with a coworker especially because it sounds like you are new to this job. make sure to try to understand if there is some type of logic to the setup that you are just unaware of. after all, there are many employees who must work together and compromise. best of luck, and don't be afraid to leave if it isn't for you :)"

Instead, if his accomplishments and ego in a certain field are bothering you, maybe you should try to work on yourself in that field until you knOw you are better than him. Then, it won't bother you what he thinks because either 1. he will realize you are just as good/better than him and stop expressing that he thinks he is great or 2. he will not realize, but you won't care what he says. Actions speak louder than words, so use your actions to show him."
