explainlikeimfive,ffbtj76,t3_ess1ja,1579782206.0,"Coronavirus is just a particular family of viruses. SARS and MERS are both specific types of coronavirus. The current thing going around in China is also a coronavirus, just a cousin of SARS and MERS.
Edit: fun fact...they’re called coronavirus because they look like the sun when you see them under a microscope."

pics,ffbcjt9,t1_ffapnwd,1579759674.0,"Giving out weapons to any random idiot isn’t well regulated, it isn’t a thing in good working order and it’s not calibrated at all let alone well calibrated.  No matter how you slice it, handing out weapons of war like candy is exactly as stupid, random and disorganized as it seems on its face and there’s no way in hell you’re going to convince me that’s how the founding fathers intended to create a society. But since you’re open to interpreting what you think they “meant” you might want to consider the fact that they were shooting muskets, not semi-automatic rifles with high capacity magazines."
nonononoyes,ffbc6e0,t3_eso6ho,1579759268.0,Accurate.

politics,ff5gojd,t3_erlj4t,1579592065.0,"I don’t believe this for a second. Trump’s cult doesn’t know or care about anything other than “Trump good, news bad.”  He could admit to rigging the election himself while fondling Putin’s balls and the Fox News crowd would coronate him King before he got off the witness stand."

pics,ff5fcyw,t3_erq32g,1579590444.0,"VA wants universal background checks, a ""red flag"" law, a ban on assault-style rifles and a limit of one handgun-a-month purchase. It does not call for confiscating guns currently owned legally. 

Those are all common sense proposals you paranoid, intransigent toddlers. And by the way, unless you’re in a well-regulated f’ing militia the constitution doesn’t grant you squat as far as guns are concerned. Stop purposefully misinterpreting straight forward language in order to keep playing with your toys. Grow up. The adults in the country are sick and tired of dealing with absurd amounts of gun violence because you idiots think guns make you “free”."
