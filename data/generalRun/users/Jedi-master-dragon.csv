DnD,fezjbc3,t3_eqzw5g,1579457944.0,"The owlbear skeleton is just an undead owlbear that can be created by a necromancer.  Since many owlbears have been fought and killed over the centuries or just died of natural causes, it stands to reason they have left behind their bones.  So it is possible that any high level necromancer could easily make one if they find their bones."
DnD,fezik9x,t3_eqzu2d,1579457725.0,"Yet another owlbear that has been awakened using magical rituals.  However, instead of using them for guards or extra muscle, they are used for entertainment.  Often found in fighting pits for the entertainment of corrupt and bored nobles or just to fight naughty adventurers who are trying to make things better for the average citizen by taking down the evil rulers of cities.  The gladiator cares little for who it fights for as long as it is fed."
DnD,fezhrv4,t3_eqzsc0,1579457475.0,The Owlbear frostbeak is similarly created as the Owlbear Flametalon but using ice based magical rituals.  The rituals gave the owlbear the ability to breathe cold blasts of air and do extra cold damage.  A good monster for a cold weather campaign.
DnD,fezgozq,t3_eqzq98,1579457174.0,The owlbear flametalon was created by being blasted with fire based magic.  Giving it the ability to breath fire but also giving its natural weapons a bit of an extra kick.  Any high level wizard or spellcaster can create one with the right amount of magical rituals and an owlbear.
DnD,fezfvnd,t1_fezcvkk,1579456883.0,Owls always look so peeved.
DnD,fezfnth,t3_eqzmgl,1579456851.0,"Owlbears were created as a joke by wizards.  But Awakened owlbear warriors were intentionally created by wizards who wanted some extra muscle and needed a monster that was a bit more intelligent.

I saw that Esper the Bard called the owlbear a basic monster and not very versatile.  But I think that something basic is actually a really good thing because something as basic as the owlbear leaves room for some serious homebrew."
DnD,fezd0cf,t3_eqzfyx,1579456050.0,"Trained owlbears are often used by everyone from cities to rich nobles to even evil wizards.  But often those are normal ones, there are some who will put armor on their owlbears and put gauntlets on their claws that will enhance their claws.  (If you read Guardians of Ga'Hoole, think battleclaws)"
interestingasfuck,fese5jr,t3_eqc7pw,1579364263.0,"Wow, that's effecient.  But it is a basic structure since cows don't need sinks or lights.  Also, fun fact about amish.  Depending on the community some do have electrical appliances but its limited and they have to go through the approval of the community leaders.  So yeah, they aren't stuck in time and they won't freak out if they see lightbulbs like that one episode of Dexter's lab.  Not sure if they go to doctors or anything, I don't know that much about them."
