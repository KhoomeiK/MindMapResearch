I'm on vacation. I'm not working. I'm on vacation. That's the point. To vacate. 

Yeah it might be a bad attitude, but no one is as important as they think they are. Delegate your responsibilities before you leave, and just fucking go.

*I HATE* when my co-workers don't get this.  There's almost no job or situation that comes up that you couldn't have delegated beforehand. Yeah, emergencies do happen, for sure. But for most people's ""emergencies""? That's just a failure to plan ahead - i.e. doing your job.

The American work culture of never disconnect is uniquely depressing, because none of it is almost ever necessary. On call for jobs, sure. But on vacation? You're not on call. Live your life. We only get 2-3 weeks. Take them off"
