Absolutely true!

The real trick is in the idea that the power ""lies within"". It doesn't - we are only human, and very limited. Practising magick/occult ritual is the process of becoming beholden to forces outside of ourselves. Those forces will grant a person temporal pleasures in exchange for their ultimate destruction."

ValveIndex,ff6xar7,t1_ff2brp3,1579636795.0,"VR is akin to manifesting a mild out of body experience - I don't know anything for sure, but it seems it would stimulate the brain in such a way as to  mimick a lucid or waking dream state. This stimulation could very well carry over into increasing the frequency and intensity of dreams, as the brain is now ""primed"" for such activity.

Just musing, but I've had the same experience, and it seems many others have as well.

An increase of activity in otherwise sedentary lifestyle could definitely play a part as well, but I had similar experience after using the original Rift prior to motion controls."

I own a Rift CV1, which I love and still use all the time, and was tempted to get a quest for the no-fuss simplicity. But after trying my Brother's Index, I decided to hold off and get an Index. The clarity is incredible, and the field of view makes a huge difference. The controllers feel perfect as well. It's a major leap over existing VR solutions. Sadly I made my decision after they ran out of stock - keep checking email every few minutes hoping I'll be able to order in time after getting notified. XD"

TrueChristian,fe6cyba,t1_fe4ojy6,1578887294.0,"Your ""fully Calvinist"" comment resonated with me. I lost faith for a while, and while I was never an atheist (perhaps more of a deist who kinda believed in Jesus, albeit puzzlingly), the tenants of ""Calvinism"" were what I let become an opening for a wedge between me and God.  Couldn't really reconcile things like Predestination, especially. I adopted a ""Universalism"" type belief (thanks in part to the movie ""Hellbound?"" and New Age-ey beliefs and philosophies). Since we were all gonna be saved,I let a lot of things slip in life and gave increasingly into sin (it starts small, but inevitably grows when left unchecked. Sin grows like weeds.) Didn't really believe, didn't care to try. I walked away for a long time. One thought that brought me back was ""What is it we are saved from?"" Thereafter, ""When are we saved?""."

oculus,fdg40kq,t1_fdd1guw,1578379166.0,"I am a loud and proud owner of the Oculus Rift CV1 - which I still love and use daily - but I decided to hold off and go for an Index after trying the one my brother has. Man, it is amazing - the clarity and FoV are tremendously improved over first gen headsets, and the refresh rate is way higher which makes things oh so smooth. And the controllers feel perfect to me, way better than any other VR controller so far. I love Oculus touch, but it has nothing on the Index.

So, as someone who has waited to upgrade and decided to shell out for an Index over the Quest or Rift S, it's something to consider.  They are unfortunately under a severe backorder at the moment, so I'll have to order it later than expected. But maybe see for yourself if saving up would be feasible within a reasonable timeframe for you, and do research on the Index and consider whether or not you think it is worth upgrading to.

Just a friendly thought."
