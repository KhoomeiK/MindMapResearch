dogs,felm3r1,t3_eptbpo,1579225445.0,"Never use negative reinforcement, it’s not effective anyway. Give treats and say good girl go potty when she goes potty on the pee pad (i’m assuming you’re using one). 

Then start to anticipate when she may have to go (say 15 mins after eating) and try directing her to the pee pad and say go potty so she goes on command.

Once she understands that go potty means do her business inside, you can take it to the next level and start saying go potty when you’re outside and she should be able to generalize the phrase “go potty” so she goes out there too."
Colorado,fekghf3,t1_fekg8we,1579199546.0,Got it. Makes sense. Glad you put them back. It was worth it for such an awesome picture!
AmItheAsshole,fekdlf1,t3_epmwp8,1579197822.0,"NTA- You absolutely said and did the right thing for 3 call outs in a 30. You are allowing her time to get her car fixed—if she has another call out give her a warning or write up and if it continues, term. 

Back when I worked as a cashier at Costco, a place that was EXTREMELY strict about time/attendance, there were people who took the bus to work when they had car troubles, because if they didn’t, they would’ve been let go. Absences/tardies were not tolerated there."
Colorado,fekd9fh,t1_fekcy2s,1579197624.0,Like what? What’s the issue lol
