My criticism of his current wealth is based on my syndicalist perspective, and from that viewpoint he also does not deserve pity. You could consider my posts to be a way to criticize the point the guy made from two different perspectives. I think it would be productive to analyze from which position he was arguing from - he implied that artists deserve obscene amounts of wealth because of popularity and nothing more rather than what value they generate for the consumer which is both antithical to the neo-liberal perspective as well as my personal perspective."

weekendgunnit,fe6h6vi,t1_fe6h4od,1578890787.0,Absolutely 100% does. You get much less velocity and much less spin out of short barrels. This is why pistols are much less accurate than pistol carbines.

weekendgunnit,fe6gezj,t1_fe6g12j,1578890118.0,"Unless it's a direct shot to the heart or aorta, no, it won't. You are looking at a ton of energy loss between 100 yards and 500 yards, even moreso now that you're running a gimped ass barrel. 

To addon to my above post, it's actually a lot worse than I thought at first. I originally thought you went from a 20 inch barrel down to 14, but you went from 16 down to 10. This results in a ton less energy. You're looking at more like 2,500 fps out of the barrel rather than 2700. You willingly just gave up 16% muzzle velocity for memes.

In terms of energy imparted on target, the standard 55 grain load dumps 1750 joules on target out of a 20 inch barrel at 100 yards. You just dropped that down to about 1040 joules with that barrel length.

To put it into perspective, a standard 5.56 out of a not-derp length barrel at 500 yards will hit with about 423 joules. You're going to be hitting with a lot less... something to the tune of 200. That's about as strong as .22 LR at 100 yards."
weekendgunnit,fe6fudz,t1_fe6eopc,1578889627.0,"Velocity is largely determined by how much force is applied to the rear of the bullet. The longer the barrel, the more of the powder is allowed to impart energy and thus propels the round faster. A standard 5.56 bullet goes around 2900 fps  coming out of a 20 inch barrel. This same bullet goes about 2700 fps out of a 14 inch barrel. This is a 7.4% loss in velocity. Considering intermediate cartridges rely heavily on velocity to impart energy, you're throwing away lethality. 

There's also the problem of punching through armor. There are two main ways to punch through armor: velocity and/or composition (i.e. a penetrator). A slow moving 5.56 isn't going to penetrate most level III armor. However, zippy cartridges like the xm193 does accomplish this more often than not because they are fast as hell. Get rid of barrel length and you reduce all possibility of most rounds cutting through. Even rounds with a penetrator will have more difficult doing their job if they don't achieve enough velocity.

Then there's the consideration if you're using hollow point rounds. These need a certain amount of velocity to expand. Fail to reach this velocity or shoot far enough distance to where the bullet loses velocity and you have a round that really sucks at penetrating armor AND it fails to do its job correctly.

Edit: Forgot to also mention you're also indirectly losing lethality in the form of accuracy. Bullets are accurate because they move quickly while spinning. The less fast they move, the more susceptible they are to outside forces, such as wind. In addition to this, you also have bullet travel time. If you're shooting at a moving target from a distance, you want the bullet to reach it as quickly as possible as this means you will have to lead the shot less."
