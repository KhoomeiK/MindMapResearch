confession,fejf6j2,t3_epe0jc,1579171222.0,"In my country, most of the people live with their parents after they are married, it's no big deal here. Living with parents is considered as a good thing in our country, as a mode of reciprocating the love and care"

Paranormal,fefrp8z,t3_eoufd6,1579063232.0,"I've never had any such experiences, but my friend had told me once that at night when she got up to go to the bathroom, she saw something on her chair but later on she saw nothing. It seems her relatives would always tell her to put something on the chair, any item, so that the chair is never empty. Something about ghosts occupying the chair, I really don't know whether this is true or not, I don't particularly believe in it. Anyways, stay safe."
Paranormal,fefpayd,t3_eosvq8,1579061430.0,"It's always better to take precautions, so I suggest that you should inform a priest about this, maybe get some holy cleansing done around the house. As mentioned in the previous comments, set up cameras and other devices to get evidences of such activities. Also keep an eye on your children, entities probably target them first, also on your dog cause they can sense such entities, so if they start barking at an empty space all of a sudden, it may be a matter of concern. You might have to even shift if this problem becomes huge, I hope this problem gets solved at the earliest."

Paranormal,fedkodg,t3_eogpg3,1579013915.0,"Woah footsteps, that's really scary, especially when it's right next to you. Hats off to your brother for enduring it till the morning, I think I would have fainted by then. When I sometimes wake up in the middle of the night to go to the bathroom it's so damn dark and scary, if the light broke I would seriously scream and forget whatever I was doing. You're brave for at least finishing what you wanted to do"
