AskReddit,ffj04ka,t1_ffiy5lq,1579987029.0,"Exactly. That's why I like that show so much, it has a pretty realistic depiction of what high schoolers are doing (I mean, with dramatic license, but still). Same with Superbad, Book Smart, and that kind of movie."

askteenboys,ffglgko,t3_etac0z,1579908973.0,"I really just think it's (at least in the US) the self-reinforcing norm of not talking about it and the sex-ed we get doesn't help much.  People are expected to not talk about it much which is reinforced at every turn. I mean, I grew up in a fairly sex-positive area and family and I still felt weird telling anyone for a solid few months afterward. Plus, sex-ed in many places is still abstinence-only, and even in my area where it isn't, they still have to emphasize the benefits of abstinence at every turn."

todayilearned,feoy3h5,t1_feox600,1579307895.0,"You might have just heard his name cause he co-wrote Good Omens, which just got a Prime adaptation. 

As far as where to start, there’s a bunch of opinions. His main body of work is the Discworld series (r/discworld), but the first one is far from the best. If you want a lighter read, there’s The Amazing Maurice and His Educated Rodents, which is about a talking cat and some talking rats who team up with a completely normal musician to run a pied piper scam. It’s a YA book, but don’t let that put you off it. If you want more straight-up fantasy, Small Gods (what happens when people believe in the church more than the god, in a fantasy blend of Iran/inquisition Spain), Mort (the anthropomorphic personification of death needs an apprentice), Unseen Academicals (Romeo and Juliet, with soccer and wizards and goblins), or Monstrous Regiment (Mulan, but in a fantasy Baltic nation with an insane god, and it’s good) are all strong choices. If you like mysteries, Guards, Guards is a good place to start, as would be Men at Arms (technically after Guards, Guards, but doesn’t matter much). If you want to borrow a pdf, just PM me. Happy reading!"
