gainit,fgse47j,t1_fgsapbu,1581081789.0,"Yeah I talked to my psychiatrist about how much it makes me sleep, but he said all the positive effects far outweigh that one negative effect. He's not wrong, just wish I had something besides caffeine to help. Also I go to the gym late at night, have a big meal and protein shake when I get home then take my tablets. Usually asleep before I get hungry again."
gainit,fgsdybg,t1_fgsakx9,1581081653.0,"Ahh well I won't argue because I'm only going off what he (Jeff Nippard) said and the studies he used, which may certainly be flawed. However having more protein just in case those studies were right wouldn't hurt at all. Only issue is having too little protein. But .82g-1.2g per lb of weight would be a good range."
Fitness,fgsddt1,t1_fgrv06y,1581081170.0,"I actually lost 6kg while cutting and not once did I cut out my favourite comfort foods like kfc and popcorn. Instead of a large meal I’d get a much smaller meal, I’d eat it a little less and make sure I wasn’t eating too much. Helped keep me sane."

So I have a pretty strong idea how you’re feeling, not saying exactly but in the ballpark. It’s hard to be motivated sometimes when you’re really down, trust me I know that. At times I wouldn’t leave the house or shower and brush my teeth for 5+ days in a row. Sometimes I was too depressed to cook and eat so I just didn’t. I know the feeling. But getting into fitness has really helped my mental health both now and in the past. Working to improve yourself is such a good feeling and when you finally see results it’s beyond compare. Having something to occupy your time and sometimes to even get your anger or frustration out on. Gym can be a very healthy way to do it.

I’m not saying focus 100% on gym and eating right and it will fix everyone, it doesn’t work like that, but it does help. Even if you can’t make it some days because you’re too sad to go, just know that’s ok to. Just do your best and try your best to be consistent. Having routine can also really help. But again, don’t be hard on yourself in those down periods. I believe in you!"

gainit,fgs4vyb,t3_ezsjxl,1581071728.0,You’re lifts should be a lot more than where they are considering your starting lifts and how long it’s been. I think you need to push yourself more in the gym and follow linear progression and by doing that you’ll get more results.
gainit,fgs43g3,t1_fgoh1a3,1581070573.0,"Not wrong, but depending on how skinny and how little they ate before hand, some of it could be water weight as well. But still a fair bit of fat gains."
gainit,fgs3ymh,t3_f02g3e,1581070372.0,"Man I'm 6'4 and my starting weight when I first hit the gym was 3kg heavier than you are now. I promise you a lot of it's in your head. I'm up to 92kg (203lb) and my ab definition is slightly there but mostly gone. Don't think as if that's always a bad thing. I used to be 'shredded' but was stick thin and had no decent muscles. Track your calories, be in a 500cal surplus and lift heavy weights and stick to a linear program. I promise you won't regret it. At your weight and height there is no real reason for you to need to cut."
gainit,fgs3n83,t1_fgrck8s,1581069894.0,Some people like Jeff Nippard suggest (researched based) more protein when you're trying to lose weight and gain muscle. So commonly 1g-1.2g of protein for each lb of weight. So I'd personally suggest 210g of protein would be best.

gainit,fgs3f0o,t3_f02wm1,1581069549.0,"I have bipolar 2 and was put on a medication called seroquel, which has a very common side effect of weight gain. Mostly because it suppresses that feeling you have when you're full and makes you continuously hungry. I need to eat round 4000cal a day and because seroquel also makes you sleep for like 10-12 hours I only have 12-14 hours to get the 4000cals in. I honestly don't have any issue with that at all.

(Depression and having no motivation to cook or feed myself contributed to this as well). Decided it was time start bulking... guess who gained 10kg in 2.5 months? This guy!

AskReddit,fgov0ws,t1_fgns0cf,1580987889.0,"I needed both of these things. Then I dated a girl that needed to have a movie on so she could sleep, full brightness, full sound. Non negotiable as she has an abusive past and that’s what she did to drown out the world around her so she could sleep. I wasn’t going to argue as I wanted her to feel safe. So for the first month or so, I’d be dead tired and pretty much have to wait till the movie was over before I could pass out. We compromised after 2-3 months and had the brightness down to the 3rd lowest setting and volume down to about a quarter or a third. Was still difficult for both of us to adjust to at the beginning but it worked out in the end."

tall,fgomxqg,t1_fgolk94,1580976552.0,Ok imagine there are two girls. One is 5’4 but not very attractive at all. The other is 6’ and a super model. I’m still going to find the super model more attractive. Now imagine there are identical twins. But for some reason one of them is a few inches shorter than the other. Due to that I would find the one slightly shorter more attractive to me. Height is just a very small factor when it comes to what I find attractive.
tall,fgol96b,t1_fgoklsq,1580974395.0,"God damn, did you not read my last 2 comments? I also like girls with tattoos and bright coloured hair.

gainit,fglp7rb,t1_fgloucb,1580907061.0,"Hahah it’s ok, what I said was 35kg “a side” so 70kg all up for dumbbells. But for someone who’s only done barbell I very much doubt  they would be able to do the same. Just as I can’t lift more on barbell because I haven’t trained in it much. Best thing to do in my opinion is start with something think you can reasonably do, a little on the lower side and work your way up each week."
Fitness,fglosp2,t1_fglfhxg,1580906678.0,"Once had a guy come up to me to give him advice on a lift we were both doing at the same time. I told him what I knew, a few things he may want to change from what he was doing. But also told him that everything I said may not be 100% fact and it’s just what I know and what’s worked for me. But I was 99.99% sure it was a better method than he was using. Was pretty happy that day."
gainit,fglod5e,t1_fglo4kx,1580906278.0,I really promise you that’s not a good reference. Dumbbells are a lot harder as you need to use more stabiliser muscles to balance then. Someone that’s doing 70kg barbell would more likely be doing 30kg a side and that maybe even be difficult less. It’s just I’ve been doing dumbbells for years and my bench press form is weak.
gainit,fglo1rz,t1_fglmght,1580905974.0,May not be all that helpful as I literally only started this 3 weeks ago so I’ve literally only done barbell bench press 3 times properly in my life now as I always preferred dumbbells as I’m taller and they were more comfortable. My dumbbell bench press is 35kg a side for 3x8 and my barbell bench press is 70kg for 3x8.
Fitness,fglnfif,t3_ez7d96,1580905367.0,Really want to talk to my gym crush as we barely go to the gym at the same time. But really don’t want to be one of those creepy guys that hit on girls at the gym. Very conflicted.
Fitness,fglmarj,t1_fglkw9i,1580904195.0,"Pretty much in a similar boat, get form down with lighter weights and slowly progress, no shame on using a weight belt even in lower weights as it’s helped me a lot. Lastly, work your core, I’ve ignored mine and it only creates more problems."
gainit,fglkiqp,t3_ez0pbf,1580902177.0,"Personally I train for both. The difference in training is usually the weight and rep range, lower reps higher weight for strength and the opposite for hypertrophy. I stick mostly to 3x8 for majority of my lifts as that’s a pretty good sweet point for working on both strength and hypertrophy. Has worked super well for me in the past."
gainit,fglke0j,t1_fglkadj,1580902018.0,"I do PPL 6 days a week, first push day dumbbells second push day barbell. Seems to work well for me."
Brogress,fglbyvq,t1_fgkyt7j,1580890070.0,"Thanks a lot :) I’m super happy with my progress, since that photo was taken I’ve gained 9kg but the first 2kg was water weight, then did creative loading for a week and gained like another 2-3kg in water weight. The rest is fat and muscles, I want to bulk up to 100kg then do a massive cut, but mainly focusing on getting my lifts heavier and getting stronger."
gainit,fgkvakb,t3_eyzrn6,1580874416.0,One that’s great to hit both is heavy shrugs with a 3 second hold at the top. Gets more time under tension for the traps and makes you hold on to the heavy weights for longer.

gainit,fgam6o1,t1_fgagu7p,1580652891.0,That does make sense actually. I guess I'll work on my form more and continue doing both so I can improve both.
gainit,fgam1qc,t1_fga7pc9,1580652844.0,"Thank you for the reply, A lot of what you're saying makes sense, as I haven't done it much in the past I'm sure my form isn't superb and honestly I'm still figuring out the width for the grip as well. I'll do some more research on form and making video my lift to get proper critiques as well."

Anyway he ran away and said he didn’t want to be friends because he thought we were gay and trying to come onto him. He tried reconnecting again a year later. But if he’s willing to stop a 15 year friendship because he thought I was gay. I didn’t want to be friends with him anymore."

Fitness,ffwto9x,t1_ffwh26e,1580310748.0,Honestly I did it pretty effectively at a much lower bf%. 88kg on the left side and 82kg on the right side. Now I do believe a lot of it was muscle memory from going on and off the gym for the last 5 years. But it’s doable. https://i.imgur.com/X92yJw6.jpg
Fitness,ffwt6iu,t1_ffwgl2e,1580310418.0,If you’re doing a keto diet it will use the fat as you’re not giving your body the carbs to do so. Super difficult to maintain and really rough the first few days from what I’ve heard though.

Fitness,ffwqn16,t3_evkz1t,1580308648.0,"At the gym right now and every week I’ve been increasing deadlifts my 5kg all the way up to 125kg for 3 sets of 8. Today doing 130kg on my last set I only managed 5 and realised my form was pretty shit most of the sets. Going to deload a bit and readjust. Really thought I was some type of deadlift beast and could keep going up till a super nice number. Reality is a bitch.

Edit: leaving not even half way through my workout as I can almost 100% guarantee I will throw up if I attempt my next exercise. Oh well, I’ll come back tomorrow and finish it and even do some extra pull-ups and abs tomorrow.

Edit 2: I sat for 5 minutes and decided fuck it and finished my workout! Didn’t throw up either, I was a few steps away from the door before I decided to just chill for a few and see how I feel."
