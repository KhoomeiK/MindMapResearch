pools,ffu0b9c,t1_fftn7bl,1580231704.0,"Pentair pretty much has the premier VS pumps - the IntelliFlo and the SuperFlo (well engineered, well built) and the top rated salt catalyst (IntelliChlor), so I'd probably head you in that direction. 

Both the Pentair pumps and their salt catalyst are ""intelligent"", meaning each unit handles its own programming or they can be slaved to a controlling device (though that's not necessary for most pools).

As far as filters - some locales don't allow backwash which means you'll have to continue to use a cartridge filter. I'm not a fan of cartridge filters because they require a lot more hands on periodic maintenance than either a DE (diatomaceous earth) or a sand filter. A DE filter requires a bit more hands-on maintenance than a sand filter although the DE filters water a lot cleaner than either sand or cartridge filters.

I recommend a sand filter for most applications as they do a good job and are pretty easy to deal with. With the addition of a glass media, sand filters rival DE for cleaning the water and their long term maintenance is negligible. 

The filter and the pump should be sized to each other... you wouldn't put a 2.0HP pump on a 75 SQft filter because the pump would destroy the filter and/or cartridge quickly. Additionally, the pump/filter choice has to be sized to the piping to and from the pool - there is only so much water that can flow through an inch and a half pipe so there's no need to put a 3.0HP pump on a system with 1.5"" lines because that will break stuff quickly and actually degrade performance of the system.

If you have 1.5"" piping to and from the pool (to the equipment pad) I'd probably go with a Pentair SuperFlo VS pump, a Pentair TR-60 filter with glass media and a 1.5"" multiport (a side mount filter as opposed to a top mount filter for easier maintenance), and a Pentair IntelliFlo salt catalyzing unit. If replacing equipment pad valves I'd use Jandy NevrLube valves. And of course all piping should be done in appropriately sized schedule 40 rigid PVC pipe with solvent welded connections."

The clips you're looking for are often called ""timer dogs"" - you'll want to purchase a set for an Intermatic timer (all [Intermatic timer clips for the model with a yellow dial](https://www.google.com/search?q=Intermatic+timer+clips&client=firefox-b-1-d&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjYovj8yKbnAhWRo1kKHbR0CiEQ_AUoA3oECAwQBQ&biw=1501&bih=857#imgrc=BA-53_TcjRTFGM:) are the same). There are two clips to a set, each a different metalic color, one with the word ""OFF"" imprinted and one with the word ""ON"". The ""ON"" one, naturally, turns the device on when that clip goes past the time line (the silver arrow pointing down across the yellow dial).

There is a chemical available that if used correctly *can* reduce cyanuric acid, but it's expensive and apparently tricky to use and for a large pool it may be that dilution is the cheapest answer.

I'm pretty sure they're not using stabilized calcium hypochlorite tablets because they don't exist. They're probably using trichlor pucks. You might want to change up the sanitizer to a liquid feed (sodium hypochlorite) or a calcium hypochlorite feeder (don't reuse the feeder you have now if it has had trichlor in it - it will blow up).

I'm not a fan of calcium hypochlorite pucks (and their feeders) because they are very messy and high maintenance."

A quick test is to roll it on a flat hard surface - it should growl a bit while rolling (they come to a halt within ten feet). 

If it ""hiccups"" or ""jerks"" while rolling, or doesn't roll at all - it'll probably cost you (a bit) less to rebuild it as it would to buy a new one.
