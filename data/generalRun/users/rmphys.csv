Can't this only be true for 1 team in any given game.

It's also heavily dependent on what you want to get out of your Ph.D. If you're wanting to go into academia, your time would be much better served doing something at least tangentially related to your field.

Generally true wherever you go, but academia will probably slightly prefer someone with interests outside of their field.  Industry doesn't give a fuck what you do outside of work.  Academia likes the occasional interesting professor to show off or create fun stories to help the university stand out.  Unfortunately, there is a really large anti-sports and anti-athletic bias in a lot of academic fields.  Just another complaint about academia.

Workout more and eat healthier.  Lifting weights is better than cardio for putting calories to use, but you gotta find an exercise that you enjoy.  You don't have to eat less (in terms of volume) if you eat calorie dense food.  My go-to is carrots in balsamic viegar.  It's filling and low calorie, but others prefer things like celery or even flavored seltzer.  Also look for lean meats.

This actually is not the case in every state or at every school.  It was recently very hotly debated at PSU when the grad students looked to unionize (unfortunately, it was a shit union so it didn't get enough support).  Basically most schools just try to treat grad students as students when that is beneficial and as employees when that is beneficial to the institution.  It's part of the reason academia is so toxic and full of abuses of power, because they pretty much strip grad students of any form of recourse other than quitting."
