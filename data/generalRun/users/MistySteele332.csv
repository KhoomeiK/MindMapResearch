loseit,ff4lipr,t3_ermc3a,1579566519.0,FYI - weight watchers has most veggies and fruits (even bananas) as free points because it’s really difficult to overeat real fruits and vegs. Pretty much only potatoes and avocados are points because Americans abuse potatoes in our diets and the high (although healthy) fat content of avocado. They recommend eating more fruit/veg if you’re hungry after using up your points. So especially after a work out day if you’re still needing to eat then go for the extra portion of vegs. If there’s sauces or they were cooked in a fat it could put you over so be aware. Good luck with your journey!
college,ff03tmk,t3_equnt3,1579464861.0,Did you intern anywhere that you liked? What drew you to psychology? An MBA/MHA without any real world experience probably won’t get you too far. There’s other options for grad school with psych under grad but it’s mainly professional programs like Occupational therapy or education. Do you want to work in the administration office of a hospital? An MHA is helpful but you have to have some real experience within an organization before they’ll trust you to be in charge of anything. You can get hired in an office with a bachelors degree and build your resume. My anecdotal experience is from an old roommate had a psych bs and started in patient registration but quickly moved up through the hospital food chain.
college,fezzknh,t3_eqx0jh,1579463583.0,"If you’re planning on a college like Columbia they won’t give you credit for ap classes they might use it for placement only. Your state school is a better bet for ap credits cutting cost. Take the most challenging core classes that you can get A’s in and look for electives you’re actually curious about learning and see where your passions take you. College admissions officers are used to seeing the students who pad their resumes with what they think might look good but have no real passion for. They seem to appreciate the students who find what interests them and go for it. 

As far as nursing and psychology, inpatient psych units are staffed by nurses. My (RN) coworkers sister is a psych nurse practitioner and is super in demand and compensated as such. There are so few NPs who specialize in psychiatry. So you don’t have to go through med school to be a psychiatrist or get a PhD in psychology you’ll have lots options."
college,fezwdvp,t1_fezqh5f,1579462523.0,"Heavy lifting (50 lbs) is a lot of nursing and direct patient care jobs. If you want a job quicker look at some of the short term training programs like phlebotomy tech or the cc near me just started a 6 week dialysis tech program. Those are less heavy lifting, cost a couple thousand dollars and take a couple months and you’re employable at a hospital for an ok wage. 

Most hospitals have tuition assistance for full time employees and as your health improves you can continue to take college courses towards whatever you like. Look at the hospital near you website and see what they’re hiring for. They’re like small cities and need people for everything within. I started in patient registration and spent a few years at cc to be a respiratory therapist. I work with nurses who started as cna’s to LPN to RN to BSN and in school now for a masters. Strangers on the internet can offer all kinds of ideas but only you can decide what is best for you. I hope you continue to get better and find what works for your situation."
college,fezpkkg,t3_eqx8h9,1579460059.0,If you’re disabled I’m certain you can find grants/aid to afford cc. What are your physical limitations? You mentioned something medical in another answer but many medical jobs are very physical. There are some that can accommodate you however. It would be better to meet with a guidance counselor at the closest cc to see what your options are. I’m a respiratory therapist and can answer (or try) any questions you might have about different careers.
loseit,fejlrx8,t3_epir9e,1579179200.0,Have you spoken with your doctor about your struggles? What about seeing a counselor? This is really affecting your mental well being and needs to be taken seriously. Please make an appointment as soon as possible. You’re suffering and need more help than internet strangers can give. Hugs to you.

travel,fcl3hd4,t3_ehrnj5,1577738991.0,"Indonesia, it was such a different environment and culture than anything I’ve ever known before. Volcanoes, rice paddies, tea plantations, mosques, and just the beautiful terrain was enough. I spent about 2 weeks on Java and 4 days on Bali. I had family working in Jakarta so was able to experience it from an expat view vs as just a tourist. The food was the best I’ve ever eaten still to this day. I’ll never forget flying from Jakarta to Denpasar and seeing mountains and volcanoes popped up in the ocean along the way. The people were friendly and treated me so kindly. I was 22 and traveled alone in Bali and the hotel staff really looked out for me. I wish it was in the cards to go back!"
politics,fbz6nlt,t1_fbz3z06,1577236726.0,Van Drew represents a red district. Lobiondo was the republican representative for a very long time before “retiring”. Van Drew was a very well liked Democrat state senator from the same district and easily got elected because of name recognition and he was genuinely respected. I’m sure he’ll keep getting elected for many years to come without difficulties. No Democrat ever came close to unseating Lobiondo.
