relationship_advice,ffab85f,t1_ff9o0nu,1579731497.0,"The advice given to the OP is pretty solid. I've been married 13 years, and I agree with the replies calling the boyfriend insecure. He's calling to break up based on helping out someone in a storm. Stating he had a problem with it is one thing-- floating the idea of breaking up over it is another. 

It stormed. He was stuck. I couldn't imagine being so cavalier about someone's safety just because he's of the opposite sex."
Instagramreality,ff9wk0h,t1_ff9ushb,1579723065.0,"I think the OP is pretty clear. Media representation of POC is dreadful when it comes to acceptable beauty standards.

 The default is white, and anything outside of that is not considered the norm. It’s better now than it used to be, but it was pretty bad when I was younger. 

Tanning is an entirely different area that has little to nothing to do with how POC are represented."

Dogtraining,ff4zj5n,t3_ergtvb,1579576239.0,"My dog does this as well. She knows how to jump, twist, and shrug the shoulders. The only way prevent this is to keep close enough to her so the leash doesn't get taut. If the leash is loose, her trick won't work. I will definitely look into the Martindale collar. It sounds like it would make the walks more enjoyable. She's great with people and dogs, but wildlife? They taunt her, I suppose."
Michigan,ff2igca,t1_fetlsbt,1579507558.0,"Definitely try Slurping Turtle. They are fantastic. 

I understand sticking with your favorite. I recently moved to PA about an hour outside of Philly. Every time I go into the city, I go to the same ramen place. I keep wanting to try a different place, but end up at my original place. It’s ridiculous."

relationships,fegxtlb,t3_ep2ow9,1579104928.0,"I had a boyfriend like that. At last check, he was spreading his love language across multiple island countries. 

Eventhough at the time we broke up, our drives were pretty well matched— nothing else was. He wasn’t comfortable compromising in the least bit and I had checked out. 

OP, it sounds like the two of you are incompatible. He does sound incredibly immature, but on a base level, you two may not be a good match."

She and her husband wanted sandwiches (I had a particularly nasty bout of food poisoning and wasn’t going to cook anything). Alright, let’s go Wawa. We pulled up and she just looked at me like I was insane. There is nothing in Michigan remotely similar to a Wawa. 

The sandwiches were good, thankfully. But it’s definitely a paradigm shift to accept decent, not terribly bad for you food from a gas station. Good prices and quality."

The water quality here is awful. I moved here a few years ago— all I’ve noticed is drier skin than normal and have to use a clarifying shampoo bi-weekly or I look like a drowned poodle. 

You can try a water treatment system. I want one, but that would be admitting that I’m staying here long term. I’m not ready for level of commitment yet."

relationships,fdu6d7k,t1_fdu1vhi,1578728372.0,"Thank you. 

I couldn’t imagine telling my parents what rules I’m going respect in a house I don’t pay for. Especially over a guy I just met three months go.

 I’m young enough to remember the rule dance with my parents and old enough to anticipate it with my daughter. I’m far more progressive than them, but acknowledge the potential awkwardness of the situation."
relationships,fdu1ng8,t1_fdu0oxq,1578725919.0,"My point is to obey house rules if you live at home. I never posited if I thought the rules were reasonable or not. You (in general) have a good idea of what your parents will and will not accept. If you choose to go against it- take your lumps and move on. But what I wouldn’t suggest you doing is telling them you won’t respect their rules in their house, adult or not. 

That’s hardly unreasonable."

KidsAreFuckingStupid,fdsiyaz,t1_fdscg2r,1578703644.0,"No, that’s a school culture problem. Kids know admin won’t do anything- all bets are off. AP won’t back the teacher, kids won’t listen to the teacher.

relationships,fds4kzy,t1_fds2qe7,1578694216.0,"Nope- got that part. Mom should not have barged in. That’s not going to help the OP, however. ‘Yes, your daughter and I were having phone sex in your bathroom, but how dare you barge in.’ Take that path and see how wonderfully the relationship progresses with her folks.

If you’re doing something against the rules, it doesn’t automatically stop being against the rules because you were caught in an unfair way. Parents don’t have to get warrants. 

They both can be wrong, but only one side has the steep consequences."
Costco,fds12rr,t1_fdrzp04,1578692650.0,"I have a larger, horizontal one. I believe it also came from Costco. It is a workhouse- it was my mom’s then I took it when she passed. 

Storage is a pain, however. The stand-up version does seem more practical from that point-of-view."
relationships,fdryl8r,t1_fdrq5wv,1578691683.0,"I’m going to ignore the shot of lower sex drive. It has nothing to do with sex drive. If your parents don’t want you having sex in their house, do not have sex in their house. It’s RESPECT. Don’t like it? Move out. 

“Everyone’s gotta respect everyone else’s lifestyle” except the parents who are prudish? Respect isn’t the same as permissiveness. Are they free to disrespect other rules as well because they’re adults? Or just the sex rules? No boundaries because that’s a lack of respect, right?"
relationships,fdrgsc3,t1_fdqzjxv,1578684315.0,"It’s her house. 

Yes, boundaries should be respected. But if you don’t like the way mom runs her house, then be the adult you’re claiming and leave. 

I moved back with parents after college. They were similarly inclined. I respected their rules until I moved back out. Still had/have a great relationship."

My daughter found a very realistic pellet(?) gun at my father’s house. She brought it to us. ‘You know that you’re not to touch firearms- real or not’. Her: Yeah, I know. But I knew papa wouldn’t have real guns in the house. 

ARGH! She’s twelve and in the know it all stage. She’s right. But only because he used to have a shotgun my sister and I were little. We used to sneak away to touch it. Mom made him get rid of it not too long later. To my grandmother. We found it there, too. The 80s were a different time. 😄"

funny,fc21dd3,t3_efp6ce,1577336591.0,"I realized this today when our Christmas plans were scrapped due to sickness. My husband started the day with a particularly bad case of food poisoning. My daughter had a re-emergence of some type of bug, and I, being pregnant and old, started to come down with some bug as well. From homemade monkey bread for breakfast to lamb for dinner- all the fancy plans were turned into day-old bagels and orange juice. 

Every Chinese restaurant I went to was absolutely packed. My favorite one stopped taking carry out orders around dinner time because they were so slammed. I had to wait a hour and a half just to call in an order. I’m sure my order of pork fried rice gave me away as not participating in the tradition. However, I’m grateful it exists nonetheless."

My mother made some amazing dishes. She was a phenomenal cook. On her death bed, I realized that I’d never have her spanakopita again. I certainly wasn’t going to ask her. I’ve been trying to piece it together ever since. I still can’t quite get that right flavor, but I’m getting closer. The one thing I remember her telling me is “add your spices until you can smell them”. Both incredibly helpful and unhelpful at the same time.
