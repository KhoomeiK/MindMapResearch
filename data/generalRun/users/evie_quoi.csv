Codependency,ffchpsg,t3_esoz4w,1579799704.0,I don’t think you should be ashamed of yourself. I think the image of you punching your abuser or someone who was mean to you in the face is a way of visualizing how you saved yourself. And you want a partner to care about that and see your strength. That’s okay! Just don’t try in real life to create situations where you’re the victim so you can falsely “overcome” your “hardships”

My mom worked in a jail and was one of the “nice” guards who was friendly with the women drug addicts who were in and out all the time. Years later my mom went in to a Taco Bell and this woman all excited calls her name. One of the heroin addicts who had a pretty long criminal record had ended up kicking her habit and worked her way up to be manager of the store. Her husband worked there and she pointed to a brand new truck out in the parking lot. 

I know you want more than that for yourself, but my point is - if that woman could turn *her* life around and find real happiness, a history of DUIs at 21 is completely manageable"

Edited to add: this has been so useful for me in modeling behavior, dealing with issues in intimate relationships by validating feelings, and has given me relief because I now know my struggles with intimacy at least make sense"

I really responded to your metaphor of swimming against a current. In that are the ideas of life’s ebbs and flows/tides, drowning, succeeding. 

Have you tried meditating on, instead of fighting the tide, stopping your resistance? In real life, the way to escape a rip tide is to swim with the current or float so you don’t exhaust yourself and drown. My friend told me when she feels like she’s drowning, she imagines swimming to the surface and taking a breath. I wonder if a similar mental image would help you find solutions/work arounds/accommodations to your current situation.

Getting through the day-to-day, create as much structure as possible. I just made a chores/self-care list I can check off throughout the day, which helps keep me organized. 

Get yourself back to baseline, and then tackle more complex self-improvement projects. Good luck!"

Part of it is about managing my budget, but also I like my relationships to feel more egalitarian.

relationship_advice,fcuu1s1,t3_eiyhsn,1577988492.0,"Thank you for sharing your story here. You’re definitely making the right choice and you should feel proud of how strong you are!

Reading about how you feel about your body and if you are desirable as a dating partner, I just wanted to share this:

I have a work friend who is fit and attractive. We were talking about intermittent fasting and he told me he used to be 300lbs and pulled out his phone to show me a picture of him before he lost the weight. 

This guy is great at his job - like one of my favorite people to work with in the area. He’s great at his job because he’s an understanding, lighthearted, kind person with this laser focus that somehow never makes him seem high-strung. He just can juggle all these different needs without making anyone feel like they’re putting him out and it’s amazing.

Sometimes he’s self-deprecating about his body. It’s so frustrating because he looks great, and also the chubby boy in the picture he showed me? Still attractive. He’s always been attractive because of who he is, no matter the size. It’s in his eyes and smile.

I know he looks at that picture and sees all the shame, depression, and self-loathing he felt during that time. Putting on physical weight will always carry an emotional weight only he can see. 

Looking forward, I urge you to recognize all these layers of emotional pain you are feeling and remember that, to the right people, on the outside, it looks like depth of character. The guy I work with, once he shared his story with me, I’m just even more impressed with his drive and work ethic. And if he was still 300lbs? I would still be impressed and love working with him. He lost the weight to feel more authentically like himself, but it’s always been the same soul in there

Good luck!"
