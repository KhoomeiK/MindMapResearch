The difference between you and me in this scenario is I'm literally admitting that my mind can be changed."
news,ffar04i,t1_ffap69d,1579742455.0,"For the record, I didn't have any terrible experiences. I left on good vibes with my ward and elders quorum president, my old mission companions, and my family on both sides who are still extremely active. I'm actually having the missionaries over tomorrow just to hang out. 

But the Mormon church is lot like McDonald's. Once you find out the meat is pink slime and the chemicals in their dessert drinks don't allow them to legally be called Milk Shakes it all boils down to one question: Is it going to stop you from eating there? A lot of members don't care about the facts because they like the church in their life. Live and let live, right? But once a McDonald's fan starts saying ""their food is nutritious"" I'm going to step in and say ""Hold up!"" because now they're spewing misinformation. You can enjoy your McDonald's and there's nothing with that, but even whether someone likes it or not it doesn't change the fact that their company has a dark past and some shady ingredients. Hence why whether or not I had a bad experience with the church shouldn't matter, because it doesn't change the fact that the church too has a dark past and some shady ingredients."
news,ffapaqz,t1_ffaodqp,1579741310.0,"When I was a believing member I would be saying the same thing you did here, so I don't blame you for feeling defensive. But I'm just as much sorry to you as I was to myself when I learned I was wrong about the church. 

The history is clear cut and if you too researched the history you'd agree with my comments. You may say at the end of the day that you still believe its the true church and you're still willing to live your life by it's standards - and that's fine. But it doesn't change what the church has done and continues to do to perpetuate the reputation it has historically carried."

As a former Mormon, I disagree with you and they are not misinformed. 

Mormons do influence the government like crazy, one of countless examples was Senator Gordon taking direct orders from church headquarters.

Mormonism is a cult.

Historically Mormonism has never cared about the law.

Mormons give immense power to their bishops to influence their kids.

What did you find was misinformed?"
