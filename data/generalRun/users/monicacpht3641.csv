Instagramreality,ffr1xvk,t1_ffqlnyp,1580148676.0,Accutane can have serious side effects for people. Her deciding not to take it doesn't automatically mean she is proud of her acne. It may mean it doesn't bother her enough to risk the potential complications accutane can cause. I decided not to take it for the same reasons. The possibility of my depression getting more severe wasn't worth it. Neither was the risk of it worsening my already severe digestive issues. The benefit doesn't always outweigh the risk.
Botchedsurgeries,ffjt2vw,t1_ffjrogy,1580006193.0,"Comments like this are what lead people to believe they need radical surgery. I don't think you can see enough of her ""gut"" to decipher whether or not she is or was male. Not everyone has the fake r/instagramreality tiny waist massive ass and boobs combo."
facepalm,ffjfk7k,t1_ffjazh5,1579997191.0,"I sometimes forget that my sarcasm doesn't always translate well over text. I have an eating disorder myself, and my way of dealing with shit is to joke about it. Wasn't trying to lessen the seriousness of the disease."

Botchedsurgeries,fff4nl5,t3_etapgq,1579875595.0,"I feel like her cheeks are suspect, but given the abdominal scar, I wonder if the cheeks are possibly health related. Like how rounds of prednisone give the moon face look. Not sure, though."

I'd be so pissed if I bought what I thought was the color on the left and it ended up just being blue chalk."
Instagramreality,ffalrly,t3_eskhx0,1579738922.0,"I can't tell if it's supposed to be 2 boobs with blurred cleavage, or if it's sideboob. It looks like both at the same time and it's fucking with me."

facepalm,fdqo9rd,t1_fdqknj7,1578671309.0,"I have a retroverted uterus, but considering I was underweight when I got pregnant, and the fact that it was twins, meant I was showing really early. Like I was visibly pregnant at 3 months, with people asking if I was overdue starting at 5 months. I had my own gravitational pull by the time my girls were born. But that's just my anecdotal evidence. Everyone is different."

AnimalsBeingDerps,fd5twoy,t1_fd5nop0,1578181465.0,"DUDE that's what ours was named when I was a kid. My parents had a 75 gallon tank in the living room, so George definitely didn't go hungry. When he died, we all had a fishy funeral around the toilet. Dad wanted to flush him, Mom insisted he'd clog the toilet. 

Dad should've listened to Mom. I remember my sister crying and my dad swearing and my brother poking at poor dead George on the bathroom floor. Ahhh childhood."
