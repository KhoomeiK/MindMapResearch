cats,ff0i20u,t3_eqyase,1579469079.0,"OP, sorry for your loss. It is heart breaking when they leave at any age. But damn, Sammy was young. 

He is gorgeous in the photo. The eyes, oh man, staring contests must have been mesmerizing."
AmItheAsshole,feyg646,t1_fexvn9z,1579445065.0,"I have two EVERY one of my past partners I would go back into a burning building for my cat and not them. Every time I meant it. I prefer animals over people. I prefer my cat over ANYONE. 

Humans a vile and disgusting. We create things for the purpose of killing and destruction. 

I will gladly let any animal keep THEIR bed instead of telling them to move because someone let them self get too fat."
AmItheAsshole,feyfqzr,t1_feyewad,1579444903.0,"And what about the pain the dog is in? And the fact that the chair is essentially a chair shapes dog bed that has pee pads on it? 

Priorities. It is not the dogs fault the woman got too fat to take care of herself."
Catloaf,ferpqgx,t3_eq9mm6,1579356964.0,"You say over cooked, they say perfectly broiled."
catpics,ferpbz0,t3_eqdv05,1579356816.0,He is so pretty!!!! Looks like a love bug!
catpics,fepaaqv,t1_feof8ss,1579315674.0,"Totally understand that. 

I myself do not enjoy almost all video games. Few hold my interest for any length of time. 

Oblivion Elder Scrolls. I lived for that game for a while. Over it now cause I played the shit out of it.  BOTW is like Oblivion for me. Loving it. For now."
instantkarma,fepa38t,t1_feo1j9t,1579315538.0,Yes! Thank you!!!
instantkarma,fenxjd0,t3_eq2kwl,1579292282.0,"Why can I not stop watching this? 

Gets better every time."
AmItheAsshole,feng2xp,t1_fenclux,1579283925.0,"Yet it is okay for her to continuously embarrass others? 

Being called out for her behaviour in that way was a little shitty - but sometimes that is EXACTLY what is needed."
AnimalsBeingJerks,femlspj,t1_femjdm3,1579261775.0,When the person laughed I cringed so f**king hard.
AnimalsBeingJerks,femlrih,t3_epy6ou,1579261735.0,Disgusting.
catpics,femlf5i,t3_epukzm,1579261320.0,Seeing the big exposed belly makes me want to dive right in for snuggles. Beautiful boy.

AmItheAsshole,fekaxqa,t3_epmj51,1579196251.0,"YTA 

For a list of reasons. The fact that you cannot see how horrible you are about this is just sad."
AmItheAsshole,feik462,t3_epa98w,1579140381.0,"NTA. 

If he felt is was inappropriate to discuss at work, he shouldn't bring up topics he is not comfortable with. 

Hate when people start a topic then try to back out."
cats,feh1amw,t3_ep0uzv,1579107055.0,"She is beautiful. Looks absolutely at peace and content in her favorite spot. 

The love and bond you shared is a wonderful thing. Beautiful thing. It will never be forgotten by either of you. 

Her spot by your side, she is now sharing it with another kitty in need. She knows you are strong enough without her, and that you still have an abundance of love for a new member or your house. 

Am so sorry for your loss. It hurts, I know. Because it was real and true. R.I.P sweet kitty."
catpics,feedjl9,t1_fedzp0o,1579031535.0,Justice for the kitties!! :D

ZeldaBotW,feecvtj,t1_feec19i,1579031150.0,Am learning so much every time I play it.    A parent recently passed away- playing that game was a great way for me to cope and deal.
AmItheAsshole,fee0jh3,t1_fedsu3g,1579023842.0,Did you read the post? You should read it again.
catpics,fedgzcx,t3_eokl0r,1579011263.0,Does she have resting grumpy face or did you catch her in the perfect moment?!
catpics,feda53s,t3_eogpig,1579005345.0,20 years!?! Amazing!! If you don't mind me asking - how old are you?  The bond you must have is wonderful!!
catpics,fed5ib9,t3_entyya,1578999882.0,Awe! Thank you kind stranger for the award!! Very unexpected!!
cats,febsvk2,t1_febmedn,1578962260.0,"She will never be replaced. Her spot will never be taken. Her memories never erased. Your love for her will never fade. Your heart will grow bigger for a new kitty when it has healed. You will bring so much love to a new furbaby. 

I don't mean or want to make you cry or feel sad. But I do want you to know I have experienced this type of loss. Bonded pair, just me and one here now. Whether your first or multiple, it always hurts. Simply because the love and bond was real and true. 

You are not alone."
funny,feavxwu,t3_eo6mqs,1578952728.0,That fucking plop at the end!!!! Yes!!
cats,feavj9r,t3_eo9k1m,1578952597.0,"Am very sorry for the loss your family is experiencing. Am positive Alex was extremely loved and cared for. He probably had the best seats in the house and everyone trained to his needs. 

When ever you open your heart to a new kitty, Alex won't be mad - he will be happy you are not alone! He is passing his spot on to the next kitty who is deserving of your love."
catpics,fe9jk7r,t1_fe5lril,1578938233.0,Wonder who lost it?
catpics,fe9jg1z,t1_fe8zb53,1578938162.0,So happy she is spending the rest of her years with someone who loves her so much!!! She is very lucky to have so many people wanting her in their lives!

catpics,fe7vl7u,t1_fe6d3vp,1578919678.0,"Been learning with Reddit a person needs to experiment with finding a sub and group of people they fit in with. 

Maybe I went about it wrong (my captions can use work) but the other subs I have tried did not work out. That is okay though! 

Thank you! He loves to pose in adorable positions then move when I grab the camera. Haha."
catpics,fe7upuz,t3_entyya,1578919470.0,"Thank you everyone for giving my boy so much love!! 

With him growing older and his issues I really wanted to make sure I shared his adorableness with others! He has brought me so, SO, many memories over the years - not to mention a drive across the country!- and I love him more then I can express. 

It is hard not to flood the sub/internet with pictures of him - I promise I will not over post but I would really enjoy sharing more photos of him!"
catpics,fe7t5ce,t1_fe76xdm,1578918987.0,I love your wording!!!!
catpics,fe65cy9,t1_fe5f401,1578882145.0,He became very spoiled this last year and now has lots of food to choose from every day ðŸ¥°
catpics,fe659gc,t1_fe5zxqd,1578882080.0,He LOVES belly rubs!! You can pet his belly for 30mins or more before he might get bothered. People say ginger kitties are affectionate - and he truly is!! Thank you!
catpics,fe5ejom,t1_fe5cyiv,1578868432.0,He is so so sweet!! The older he gets the more he wants the love!!
catpics,fe5ehub,t1_fe592v4,1578868406.0,Thank you!! Cannot deny I find myself taking lots of pictures of his face/eyes! Haha

catpics,fe53w91,t3_elkpe0,1578865445.0,Their faces say they will challenge anyone who questions it. Love it! Beautiful kitties.
AmItheAsshole,fe2n9dc,t3_enhiy2,1578840855.0,You are so obviously NTA. Not sure why you are asking if you are.
secretsanta,fe2lhsb,t3_ennqht,1578839971.0,"Are you able to find the post office the parcels are being held at? Maybe, if you are able to and call they can give you an update on them. Or a time line for how ling they will hold them. 

Best of luck. That really sucks. Sorry that happened to you."
secretsanta,fe2l33l,t3_enko0u,1578839754.0,On the website for the exchanges it has everything listed. All events and exchanges happening.
AmItheAsshole,fe2fw9g,t1_fdzde1r,1578837933.0,"Agreed. I am finding it hard to read a lot of the comments because of just how... cruel, they are."
shittyfoodporn,fdw9y73,t3_en7h49,1578756594.0,"Call me crazy, but I fail to see what is so shitty about this. Chicken nuggets and fries, yum! Condiment of mayo? Sometimes sure!"
help,fdtmirc,t1_fdtgtpz,1578718918.0,"I have not been in your situation before. But, I really enjoy this sub and reading the posts and comments. Lots of helpful hints people give on this sub. 

Could also try browsing through the sub for a post where someone was having a similar issue. Positive you could find some more things to try from them. 

Good luck."
help,fdtg4t5,t3_en1ewo,1578716276.0,Have you messaged one of the MODs in the sub to ask?  Hope you get answers!
help,fdqkwik,t3_empiqb,1578669133.0,"From my experience -when I first joined- I didn't get treated horribly, most were welcoming :) 

Be prepared to get a back bone though. I say this because there WILL be people who down vote you and give you shit for things. Take it in stride and remember that not everyone on here is like that. 

Also, welcome to Reddit!"
AmItheAsshole,fdq977i,t3_emmaaf,1578659926.0,"NTA. 

You NEED to talk to the vet office manager, owner, who ever is in charge. 

If they have done that to your poor baby in front of you, what did they do while the cats were in their care? 

You NEED to report this."
AmItheAsshole,fdor3m6,t1_fdo78so,1578611007.0,"Then what the hell is your problem? People who love each other should not be together? Should she have stayed with her ex just to please you? 

Pull your head out of your ass OP."
KidsAreFuckingStupid,fd9247n,t1_fd7vdf5,1578227178.0,Am wondering the same thing.
cats,fd5oh4m,t1_fd5n1in,1578179682.0,It is actually a kids pillow!! Saw it in a store and thought it'd be so cute if he liked it. Turns out he does! :)
LostALovedOne,fclmuis,t3_ehui8c,1577751503.0,"Oh my gosh. That sound all so very over whelming and stressful. That is a lot for a person to feel and cope with. 

So very sorry for the loss you and your family experienced. Hope in time you find peace of mind. 

As for your Christmas. Wow. I do not think I would want a christmas tree either. Honoring a memory is beautiful, but that is quite a bit of pain. Sorry your wishes were not listened to. 

The legacy book. Despite the tears brought on from it, I am sure it is beautiful and will bring lots of joy in the years to come. Very nice of you to hold on to it. 

Wishing you positive energy and warm thoughts. Hope you find time to yourself to settle your thoughts and mind."
funny,fcipfak,t1_fcio4qr,1577666701.0,"Not disappointed with update. Damn. To see his face drain of color would be icing on a cake. A pale cake. 

Picturing this I hear you giggling like a mad person in the background."
LostALovedOne,fcip7z7,t1_fcio2gc,1577666568.0,"Thank you for taking the time to read my post. Admittedly it was quite long. 

Thank you as well for the kinds words. I needed to hear them. 

Doing my weekly shop today, song plays in store, triggered me and I started tearing and crying a bit. 

Felt so embarrassed."
funny,fcim9wl,t1_fcilflk,1577664940.0,Yes. Need updates.
LostALovedOne,fciluaj,t1_fcijhj7,1577664728.0,"Thank yoy for the kind words. 

Where I work has an actually pretty decent program in place for people who need to talk to someone. It is all over the phone. 

If that is something you are comfortable in, perhaps look into that? Or see if the community you live in has resources available."
LostALovedOne,fcicdhy,t3_ef07r9,1577660470.0,"I wish I had words of advice for you. I myself am in the same situation; it was my father who passed away. 

I do not have words of advice, but know that you are not alone. There are others out there who have experienced this and can offer you/us their strength and guidance. 

Sorry for the loss and pain you are experiencing. Hope you find peace of mind after you grieve and sort your feelings and emotions out. Best of luck."
The10thDentist,fcf6b95,t1_fcf53pd,1577627042.0,"Agreed. Most teenagers ALWAYS think they are grown up enough for everything. So not the case. Just because your body may physically be ready why, just why? Why would someone even want it to be lowered? 
All around gross and creepy."
cats,fccnbdq,t1_fcc1wzt,1577600387.0,"Thank you. Cannot rush the process, but I really want eventually to come sooner."
AskReddit,fccms1q,t1_fcay50m,1577600211.0,"Needed to read this. Have just lost a parent - functioning through daily routines is so impacted. 

Friend was asking me what I needed and I couldn't focus enough to come up with an answer. 

The simplest of gestures is really all that is needed, most of the time."
AskReddit,fccm6np,t3_egwusn,1577600019.0,"My father passed away on the 23, and I did not find out until the 27. 

Been avoiding telling anyone in my daily life because I do not know how to handle their well wishes. 

For me personally, I feel when I say ""I'm sorry"" it is not enough. 

But like the OP said, what do you say besides that?"
cats,fcbynr2,t1_fcbxlu2,1577592434.0,Thank you for the kind words. Kitty snuggles are a pretty amazing thing.
aww,fc05qar,t3_effdak,1577279774.0,This is so wholesome!! Love how thoughtful she was!! So adorable. Smart and sweet girl.
