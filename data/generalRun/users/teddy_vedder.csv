Thought the image quality was way too high for a Victorian era photograph so I decided to check."
Instagramreality,ffz5dqo,t3_evzul8,1580364568.0,Is her nose job crooked?
aww,ffz35xk,t3_evxg8q,1580362435.0,I’d love to work from home so I could spend more time with my cat. It’s just me and him and he loves attention and deserves more than I can give him.
HuntsvilleAlabama,ffz2m9h,t3_evyvtc,1580361939.0,"Okay so here’s the thing — don’t count on teaching as something you want to do until after after you’ve tried it as a grad assistant. Also, don’t count on having a master’s degree until you actually *have* that master’s degree. 

Furthermore, adjuncting is not always something you can just dabble in if you have a master’s only. You’re usually restricted to beginning level courses, and don’t always have a ton of choice on what schedule you’d be given. Furthermore, academia is getting super saturated job market wise, so holding only a master’s might make getting hired tougher when they can just have people with PhDs work for the same amount of money. Teaching college can also be a more demanding workload than you think — I only taught two courses a semester and some weeks HAD to spend 30+ hours on teaching duties because that’s just how things ended up with grading and lesson planning. 

Basically what I’m trying to say here is just try not to get too ahead of yourself. I had no idea what a master’s and teaching at a college level was like before I started, and now that I’m on the other side, I totally abandoned that career path even though I absolutely was in love with my subject matter."
RetroFuturism,ffz15r5,t3_evytiq,1580360635.0,I feel like this would make vehicle accidents far more lethal
UrbanHell,ffyyufc,t3_evw18q,1580358706.0,I’d rather just die smh
HuntsvilleAlabama,ffyltrc,t3_evv8xm,1580349489.0,At least you didn’t put “an interesting title”
AmItheAsshole,ffya8ru,t1_ffxgxz6,1580341645.0,"Though by choosing only one instead of hurting all three of them equally, it definitely feels disproportionate to the sole child hurt. I can’t imagine how unwanted she probably feels just getting left there while her dad’s new family goes on the trip"
MapPorn,ffy7ger,t1_ffwr8ip,1580340037.0,"People in the humanities don’t stay in that field unless they really, *really* love it. The payoff in terms of salary and hours spent doing all the work is rarely worth it if you don’t love it more than most anything else"
HuntsvilleAlabama,ffy5qg3,t1_ffy0xwz,1580339066.0,I just want a good quality sit-down Italian place that isn’t a massive chain. Like Gianmarco’s in birmingham but a little less swanky.
TheBluePill,ffy4xox,t3_evjzn8,1580338624.0,Trying to read the whole post gave me heartburn
tacobell,ffy3sj0,t1_ffx9voz,1580338002.0,I still mourn the naked chicken chalupa like once a week. one fresh outta the fryer with that avocado ranch....hnfff
aww,ffy21ks,t1_ffxsfsb,1580337034.0,This was my thought too. Istanbul cats are special cats.
HuntsvilleAlabama,ffxoizn,t1_ffxg509,1580329309.0,"I almost yeeted my phone away when I saw that, especially having it ranked higher than the other tex mex. I don’t go to taco mama because I can honestly make the same quality of food at home, which is saying something because I’m *pretty* bad at homemade tex mex. It’s wildly plain and bland for being allegedly a cuisine full of spices and flavor. 

I’d rank El Cazador FAR above it. I’d also rank bandito and little Rosie’s above it."

bon_appetit,ffxjteo,t3_evikxo,1580326583.0,"I enjoy Molly’s food and she is usually fine. I think she and I just don’t quite vibe which happens, people are different. To me she just kind of gives off similar energy to girls I knew in high school who were generally nice but occasionally said something kinda rude or insensitive and tried to pass it off as funny. Y’know, “lighten up, it’s just a joke.”"
HuntsvilleAlabama,ffxbn9n,t3_evp6mq,1580321833.0,Time to stock up on my antihistamines!!!
TheBluePill,ffx34lh,t3_evkkc8,1580316736.0,"Wow those comments are nasty. Extrapolating tons of info that can’t reasonably be drawn from anything in the comment, calling her a bitch(?), painting a picture off zero evidence, showing zero compassion even though their whole community is based off feeling the same way (but being more vicious about it). Ugh"

unpopularopinion,ffw4gdg,t3_eva633,1580283907.0,"Even so I think it’s dangerous to tell people they’re “not actually” mentally ill if you’re not a medical professional because honestly, you have no way to know. 

All through high school I had major depressive episodes and my family refused to help me seek treatment because they thought I was just being an edgy moody teenager. I literally can’t remember any of 9th grade I was that fucking depressed and out of it the whole time. 

Cut to college, I tried to kill myself. Ended up in therapy and spent a year on the highest dose of Zoloft most doctors will prescribe. My family might believe me now but they definitely avoid the topic.

I just always think it’s better to take someone seriously and risk being wrong, than to not and risk being wrong."
unpopularopinion,ffw3og5,t1_ffw2g7l,1580282931.0,"Man I’m sick of this joke. Alabama and the Deep South have just as many laws against incest as other states. Doesn’t have any higher rates of it. If you go far enough back into history where cousins in Alabama were marrying,  cousins in every other state were too. Damn, like make fun of us for something bad we actually DO, like poverty or shit tier education"
unpopularopinion,ffw3jol,t1_ffw2u7q,1580282773.0,Yeah this severely lacks empathy. I have never ONCE cried in public on purpose and any time I’ve cried in public it’s been totally uncontrollable and horribly embarrassing and I wished I wasn’t. Sometimes something comes up out of nowhere that just beats your spirit down so bad you can’t control yourself.
TrollXChromosomes,ffw3d0q,t1_ffuiq9d,1580282544.0,"Reddit has convinced me that not ALL men hate women, but more than enough do (especially secretly) for it to justify women being generally wary of men as a whole. It’s disgusting how popular misogyny can be on this hellsite, even in seemingly neutral subs"

 No you’re being unnecessarily rude and hurtful when you could have just kept your mouth shut, you absolute muppet"
TrollXChromosomes,ffw2i84,t1_ffv0xvo,1580281522.0,Man I remember seeing photos of her back then and really being concerned about how many bones I could see beneath her skin. I never remarked upon it of course because I didn’t want to seem like I was just trying to body shame or something. I’m glad she’s recovering and seems to be healthier now.
