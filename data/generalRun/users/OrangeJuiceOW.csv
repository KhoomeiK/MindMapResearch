The only importance we give to that horrible country is the fact that Mecca and Medina exist inside it's borders. It's disgusting human rights violations, it's graphic abuses against the LGBTQ+ community (which I am a part of), and the profiteering off war and oil are not actions that reflect Islam, a religion of love and peace. That awful country should be held accountable for it's actions not pampered for it's oil."

This could be so that appetite is decreased, digestion is slowed or halted, and the body will then less likely need to use the bathroom and thus poop. Evolutionarily this was originally how we escpaed predators or danger, but it could be induced through flight or fight and even stimulants and hysteria from or hallucinations from psychedelic drugs."
