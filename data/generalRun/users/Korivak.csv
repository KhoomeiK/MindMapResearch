AirshipsGame,fd5yp3r,t1_fd5s893,1578183175.0,I love the presentation!
technicallythetruth,fczq6vn,t1_fcznw6e,1578106677.0,"That’s why I’m sure it’s a choice instead of a weakness. Stephenson is a great writer of beginnings and middles, settings and characters, comedy and thriller...everything else. He could write more conventional endings perfectly well if he cared to."
technicallythetruth,fczm4cl,t1_fczhh84,1578104222.0,"If he had done as many endings as he has and they were all unintentional bad, I’d agree with you, but I think it’s much more likely that it’s a stylistic choice of his instead. He just really favours extremely abrupt endings right at the climax that leave a lot of minor points unresolved.

A maddening and divisive authorial choice, sure. But not *bad*."

HisDarkMaterialsHBO,fcyka29,t3_ejgsra,1578081536.0,I like this format!
JustCause,fcyk54z,t1_fcyjgm2,1578081459.0,"My approach to the game is that speed is my armour. Anything that slows you down *seems* cool, but it makes you slow which will eventually make you dead."
Stormworks,fcxs8s7,t3_ejh2dh,1578069663.0,I love old warbirds. Looks great.
iosgaming,fcxquzk,t1_fcwedwt,1578069262.0,"Haha, I always throw in a recommendation for Slay any time I can, and it’s great to see it get some love before I even get to the comment thread.

I played it on Windows, Palm, and then nothing during the dark days, and now iOS. It’s icon is in the top left position of honour on the games screen always."
KeepWriting,fcw6fys,t3_ej19z5,1578018233.0,"Goodness, your character is named Wendell! That’s a rare one...I know of only three personally: my grandfather, my son, and some hockey player. I like it!"
