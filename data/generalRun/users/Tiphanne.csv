ChronicPain,ffe3plh,t1_ffe2sq7,1579835891.0,"I really hope it helps. I knew intuitively it was something I had to look into months after the accident. I had the initial doctors visit Dec 2014 and the actual surgery 6 days ago. 

I’ve had every imaginable scan (that I’m aware of) and every time I have a complaint it’s never answered by any of the scans. One showed bulging discs and maybe a pinched nerve but the scan was so blurry to say for sure. It has been several years now since these so I guess seeing a comparison over many years could be helpful now. I guess I’m tired of being told nothing is wrong when I feel very much different."
ChronicPain,ffdylc0,t1_ffb723m,1579832156.0,"It’s been long over due I’m sure as well? 


I just had a breast reduction. Really hoping it will relieve some neck shoulder and back issues that were brought on after an MVA 6 years ago. I have other joint pain as well that’s mostly degenerative. Which feels like a huge pill to swallow at the young age I was first told this and that it wasn’t caused by the accident. Would still like another opinion on that but I also don’t want more scans done."
ChronicPain,ffdy0um,t3_esrfjt,1579831748.0,Painfully accurate. I just had surgery to hopefully relieve some pain but ugh starting to regret my current added pain from surgery.  Sleep was good for the first 5 days. Now it’s agonizing just to get in bed.
ptsd,ffba9k2,t3_esoi67,1579757151.0,This is a very good question and I also would like to know. Thank you for asking. Hope we both can get some answers.
ChronicPain,ffb5vgo,t1_ffb5nd2,1579752614.0,We can! Was this surgery in an attempt to alleviate chronic pain? Thank you I’m rooting for you as well.
ChronicPain,ffb5eud,t3_eskzl3,1579752262.0,I too am recovering from surgery. Day 5 of a 4-6 week recovery timeline. Can’t wait to see if surgery helps any!
AnxietyDepression,ffabr3l,t1_ffa6rbc,1579731807.0,Posting here could lead you to a solution. They are right in saying you are responsible for your own healing but shame on them for making you feel guilty in some way for posting in the first place. You did nothing wrong. Faith may be a good place to find support but as with anything else listen to your intuition and if it does not feel right it likely isn’t. Find support and treatment that works best for you! Best of luck. Your feelings are valid and heard.

CPTSD,fepets8,t1_fep9mu8,1579318734.0,"Yes they want you to know without a shadow of a doubt. Which is bullshit in itself. You’ve been conditioned into questioning your own truth so of course your answers are going to be riddled with doubt. Again, that’s a them problem and not a you problem. And sadly therapy can help with that but I will reserve that bit of advice because it honestly takes years. As to the text messages regarding therapy requests to your pos father, how disheartening to think those could be used against you. He’s on trial! Not you!!! Oh hunny I am in tears for you. I wish I could offer my shoulder for you to cry on. This stuff is heartbreakingly horrible. Here’s a few more little bit of information I’ve learned in therapy that might help;

Box breathing!!4 seconds in 4 seconds hold 4 -6 out and four to hold again. Repeat. At least three times. Do as often as you can. And breathe from the belly. Stick that sucker out and fill those lungs! 

CBT - this one is a lot to explain but google it and find a triangular chart that feels best to you, I’ve received a few different ones in therapy that never felt easily understood but I’ve found many on the internet that make more sense. Repeat this as often as you can but do not beat yourself up if you don’t find it useful or successful at first. Try writing it out in a chart style and doing as many different scenarios as you can. Like anything practice brings improvement! And this also takes time. 

Epson Salt baths or just a bath. Do everything you can to relax!! Meditate and often and for like 2 minutes if you can’t stand it at first! Try an app called Insight Timer! They have short guided meditations to follow! 

Please send updates! You always have a place to vent and talk here!"
CPTSD,feno26h,t3_epyre0,1579288451.0,"I respect and believe you! Remember this regardless of what anyone else says. You are doing the right thing by standing up against him. My heart goes out to you, I’ve testified against an abuser and it didn’t go the way I thought I wanted it to go. I wanted him to pay. I wanted him to be locked away. Before trial and before I even went to the cops I didn’t want this. Strange I’m sure but I also understood he was also very sick. Hurt people, hurt people... Jail just becomes a place for them to work on being better at hurting people. This is just my opinion. I believe in your case he should 100% not be aloud around children so thank you for thinking of potentially new victims and taking a stand. I am so sorry you were ever made to believe you made anything up. People sometimes have a hard time seeing the evil in the world for what it is and it’s easier to believe the opposite of that truth. This is a them problem, not a you problem. Be selfish with your time, take lots of time to yourself, don’t be afraid to speak up and take breaks if YOU need them. I powered through my testimony and felt extreme relief when it was over but also extreme defeat when I was told he’d been acquitted due to police error and inconsistency in my testimony because having to face him was completely destabilizing for me. If you feel any of that, ASK FOR A BREAK! collect yourself and try again! No one will hold this against you. I wish you the absolute best as I truly believe justice comes whether it’s at the hands of the justice system or by way of karma. You are brave, important and stronger because of everything you’ve been through!"

This totally brightened my day as I sit awaiting my surgeon."
Wicca,fekrozn,t1_fekq6vz,1579206211.0,"Thank you. I’m rather passionate as you are clearly as well. I have come to understand as an eclectic myself is that aboriginal cultures as well as pagan cultures worked with what they had available. There is another to consider here as well, Mother Nature herself! Which of all religious communities I feel pagan and aboriginal of any kind respect and pay tribute to the most! With that said I would imagine if something was to become unavailable we all would adapt and main stream markets wouldn’t probably even flinch. 

Mother Earth I believe has lessons to teach as well which we ultimately have no control over other then to respect her and not damage that relationship by way of things like packaging. Which again comes back to big box stores. And that can of worms comes into more conversations then just our ritual practice but our daily lives as well. The foods we eat, clothing we buy, cars we drive etc etc etc."

Wicca,fekpv4o,t1_fekmzpm,1579205133.0,"I call it smudging because Iâ€™ve learned it from the culture it came from. This is important to the conversation.  I donâ€™t think shaming everyone whoâ€™s ever bought white sage or smudge bundles is conducive to what is being attempted to be achieved. Teaching the practice brings conversation and this culture to the forefront, not supporting big box companyâ€™s and their desire to make a buck I think is becoming more important to so many even outside of this community. Teaching people to cherish what they have now with respect to where it came from and change how they go about their practice in the future is important in my opinion. I sought out a First Nations woman to teach me. Reach out and giving these marginalized cultures a platform is important to prevent cultural destruction as well as the tools and materials they use for ritual. I treasure all of the information and tools I have gathered and done a great deal of research into both sides of the argument and personally I donâ€™t believe in everything I read. 

Edit ( I donâ€™t believe everything I read online, because I had a school teacher as a mother and I regretfully admit I am becoming her ðŸ™ˆ)"
Wicca,fekm7he,t1_fekkedf,1579202956.0,"I know and Iâ€™m sorry I was combative in anyway. Full moon had me bugging out. There is definitely a lot to this subject. Iâ€™m from Canada and was taught by First Nations the ritual of smudging but I felt called to make it my own after. I had no idea the appropriation that occurs else where in the world just around the word smudging and I will definitely be holding our local natural health and foods stores accountable for their products now as this is clearly a global issue and not just local. Even though I would never buy from some of the companyâ€™s you sourced in you video as examples of what not to do (I stay away from big box stores as it is) not every health food store is automatically ethically sourced either, doing your research locally is important as well. Looking forward to palo santo video! Again well done. We are all only as accountable as the individual research we can do with what we have in our hands before we support with our money!! Blessed be! Education is key!"
Wicca,fekjmlc,t3_epl5dl,1579201422.0,Thank you for doing the research. Video is well done.

ptsd,feedqww,t1_feecily,1579031657.0,"What whoa, no?! Sounds a bit far fetched so maybe thatâ€™s why he didnâ€™t believe in it. Technically they target the chemicals in the brain, but I meant to say psychiatrists are one of the very few specialists who donâ€™t actually LOOK or take scans of the organ they treat. Which seems WILD to me. I watched a TED talk I believe where a guy saved his nephew from a life on these meds and worse because he actually scanned his brain and found a tumour, had he not had an uncle who was a doctor he would have likely been put in a mental institution until he died. I also had no idea the dangers of Advil and Tylenol when I was young! I developed ulcers at a young age also due to neglect and stress but obviously tons of this stuff didnâ€™t help. They severely hurt my stomach now any time I take them, which doesnâ€™t help having chronic pain. Meds numbed me right out, I also couldnâ€™t take NSAIDS on them either. Double screwed. Smdh."
ptsd,feecq6o,t1_fee2cio,1579031059.0,"Well said. Iâ€™ve definitely had 1 out 4 specialists Iâ€™ve seen say one thing and itâ€™s made me personally question myself, even though Iâ€™m in some level of pain daily and had been previously diagnosed with chronic pain after PTSD. Before I even saw the guy I looked at his reviews and saw an overwhelming number of people reporting him being dismissive, so go figure. But do you think Iâ€™ll likely ever forget his comment? Sigh"
ptsd,feec0sr,t1_feeb9dp,1579030647.0,Absolutely. Pharmaceuticals treat symptoms not the actual problem. Not to mention the negative side affects. Maybe this will be different. What Iâ€™ve never understood is the lack of looking at the actual organ psychiatrist treat. Iâ€™m not a doctor but that seems like shooting a fish in a dark barrel...with your eyes closed.
myfavoritemurder,febs8p4,t3_eo4h5z,1578962100.0,Theyâ€™ve made such impactful statements in their work.  Love MFM
witchcraft,fe62wor,t1_fe62flo,1578880571.0,Absolutely! I did a deep cleaning and found things after Iâ€™d done my original burn and once I added it to the box I immediately noticed a sense of relief after feeling disappointed that my original burn left me feeling like something was missing. Itâ€™s just a standard legal file box but Iâ€™ve painted it and put a protection spell on it to seal the contents within until I can deal with them properly at a later date. Or whenever I feel my energy start to stagnate.
Wicca,fe5ywwq,t3_enuuui,1578878035.0,This is amazing! Thank you for sharing ðŸ˜
witchcraft,fe5jbx0,t3_enmm11,1578870145.0,I have a â€œBurn Boxâ€ that Iâ€™ve done something very similar to this with! I love that you shared this! I add to the burn box anything that I canâ€™t just throw away and honestly I feel like I have more to do. I thought I had gotten all the gunk out but this has given me so many more ideas. Thank you!! The box is just a temporary place I put things to remove them immediately. Then I burn them ceremoniously in a big bonfire during a full moon.
Crystals,fdzs6wb,t3_encqx2,1578794543.0,Beautiful!!
witchcraft,fdpum7u,t1_fdpp62f,1578641142.0,Thank you for writing this. Itâ€™s both enlightening and reaffirming of how I have been coming to understand my own mental health struggles recently. I immediately clicked on this post and I too feel teary eyes and warm inside. Iâ€™m both relieved and saddened but grateful to feel alone because Iâ€™m really not alone at all.
CPTSD,fdp4wss,t1_fdnicnr,1578620071.0,"Oof, wow thank you. I too crave physical touch but donâ€™t like being touched mostly due to trauma. It seems so backwards...Glad to know Iâ€™m not alone in this."
AnxietyDepression,fdohyee,t3_emedhb,1578605510.0,"Just be honest. What you are experiencing is real. Trust your intuition, if something doesnâ€™t feel right itâ€™s likely not. Donâ€™t be afraid to speak up and advocate for yourself. You have parents that care for you as they are obviously here for you and many parents would just let their kids go on without ever addressing the situation. I know it may feel like you are about to be punished but you have people who care and want the best for you and I know from having been in similar situations that they just want whatâ€™s best for you. Even if they donâ€™t know what exactly that is. School systems arenâ€™t designed to fit everyone. What works for one doesnâ€™t work necessarily for another and thatâ€™s okay."
ptsd,fdoaqcz,t3_emapgp,1578601809.0,"Iâ€™ve had Physio specialists say before asking me anything or really having any concept of who I was â€œHas anyone ever told you you are okay?â€  And then proceeded to do his full medical examination on me after a brief interview where I told him I had recently been assaulted. I cried the entire time. With a female secretary in the room. (Iâ€™ve seen multiple male doctors prior none who had a â€œwitnessâ€ come in during an exam) I was in extreme musculoskeletal pain and he ignored all my recoil as he moved my body to test my range of motion. He later told my lawyer ( I was in for a legal medical assessment) that he would not write a report because I was inconsolable and unresponsive even though I answered all of his questions, and that there was nothing physically wrong. What he did get right was that I was suffering physiological distress, which was not his area of expertise. Clearly. His stupid exclamation that I was perfectly okay haunts me still. I want to be okay but fight flight and freeze is all I know. It was a totally triggering event and I still to this day get terrifying dreams about male doctors. I refuse to see any male doctors going forward. Doctors/EMT/police are just people. They arenâ€™t super human. They are just as susceptible to being stupid, ignorant and disgusting or all three or worse even with taking sworn oaths to serve and protect. They too can be monsters hiding in plain sight. Iâ€™m grateful for your courage to speak about your experiences. Thank you.

Edit: I should note I had been assaulted just prior to this appointment which had been scheduled due to a prior MVA which fully triggered my own PTSD."

ArtistLounge,fdl9v5q,t1_fdl7lx8,1578519523.0,"Haha word vomit fear is real!  Thank you for expressing that first of all! Secondly, thatâ€™s a wonderful explanation and again thank you for clarifying. 

 I wasnâ€™t seeing the con being conversation abbreviated and more the â€œlong conâ€ like an â€œOceansâ€ movie plot line giving it a more sinister/criminal feel? Just my initial thoughts but obviously now this makes sense. 

Please word vomit about critical authority (in my mind that would be baby boomers) and what â€œrealâ€ art is. Personally to me art is whatever the artist and viewer/consumer says it is. And are we talking on a career level (starving artist vs successful artist) and what that means as well?"

astrology,fdl2le7,t1_fdl0wfc,1578515993.0,Sooo I guess that would mean that itâ€™s very individualized as well. Hmm interesting. Thanks for sharing that! Iâ€™ve always been upset when someone refers to me as a millennial. Maybe more so when itâ€™s in a negative light.

depression,fdksexo,t1_fdjzrj3,1578510182.0,"Jokes aside, wasteful as well! But I also am guilty of the shower so long it turns cold and youâ€™re literally and figuratively frozen. So yes depression sucks. For everyone."
depression,fdkr1lj,t3_elpxkm,1578509365.0,"This could be the result of parents saying â€œStop crying or I will give you something to cry aboutâ€ or â€œBig girls/boys donâ€™t cryâ€ or any dismissive neglectful behaviour realized or not. However, that may have also been their upbringing as well so before you start blaming mom and dad for this, try to be kind. As kind as you need to be for yourself! First! Neglect is still neglect even if itâ€™s completely unconscious. I feel your pain of needing to bottle up emotions and almost a denial that anything is wrong but yet you feel it. You know something is not right. Trust that. Itâ€™s likely just because you were never shown that feelings (good, bad and ugly) are all normal and perfectly okay to express. When you donâ€™t have examples in early development of healthy emotional expression, it can have negative impacts later in life. We as humans need to express and release our emotions or it becomes a festering train wreck of confusion and pain. And in this case also guilt. What you are feeling is okay. Get out as much as you can. It takes time. You may be literally reparenting yourself. Therapy can be very beneficial in helping you make a lasting change. Best of luck! Be kind to yourself and donâ€™t hesitate to reach out when you feel a desire to express ALL your feelings. You are not a burden!"
astrology,fdkowvm,t1_fdk1ofv,1578508097.0,These dates also range and change from source to source. My mom (born in 64â€™) refuses to accept sheâ€™s a boomer but now everything makes more sense! Still frustrated just confirmed that itâ€™s not just me. Thank you for sharing
ptsd,fdij7wh,t3_elghj0,1578444128.0,Definitely consider going to therapy for yourself too! I know you want to help him but you are dead right about not being able to force a horse lead to water to drink. Sometimes leading by example is the way to start small. If you equip yourself with ways to cope with what you are also going through then it will be easier on both of you. Iâ€™ve had to get very frank with my loved ones when they suggest â€œjust getting out of bedâ€ or something else that is realistic to someone not suffering with PTSD. Itâ€™s a hard thing to have to do but abusing alcohol takes a tole on not just him but you as well obviously as you arenâ€™t able to live with him. I know heâ€™s important to you but you should also be important in this as well. Take care! I wish both of you nothing but the best!

But thank you for standing up for my rights to exist in this space too!

myfavoritemurder,fdfneyc,t1_fdfn8jh,1578365727.0,I feel like Iâ€™ve seen it but Iâ€™m rather picky about my crime doc commentary voice lol I will give it a swing again. Thank you.
depression,fdfn7ci,t1_fdedpes,1578365587.0,"Yes saying nothing is better then saying something hurtful or something you donâ€™t actually mean. Whatâ€™s her dad doing in all of this? Not pointing fingers but I bet both daughter and mother are equally scared he could die due to stress of any kind but is he eating healthy and is it just old age and genetics? 

Sorry Iâ€™ve had friends tell their parents theyâ€™ve hated them and then they were killed 20 minutes later by a drunk driver soooo... some things are truly out of our control but our words are always in our control and it sounds like the mother in this case is very afraid to loose her husband, and isnâ€™t using her words to explain that in a way thatâ€™s helpful to anyone."

Edit: the subject or title of the project was called what makes me strong...."
tarot,fdbg0nb,t3_ekfhr4,1578257039.0,Wherever did you get this?!
CPTSD,fd84gd3,t3_ek4xjk,1578213820.0,"I totally relate to the feeling youâ€™ve expressed about not remembering things. Iâ€™ve also had delayed reactions to many things that have happened to me, many things related to my father. Inappropriate behaviour etc. 

Our brain does funny things when youâ€™re  in danger, perceived or otherwise, it blocks out and rearranges things. With no real reason or rhythm. They can be triggered by reading other peopleâ€™s stories as well, which is helpful when youâ€™re ready to face it but also a very individual thing. 

  Thatâ€™s where therapy is helpful. It can help sort things out so you can be more aware of whatâ€™s actually going on and make decisions for how your relationships will work best for you. This takes time and you shouldnâ€™t just expect them to change overnight. And never expect anyone else to change. I still have this overwhelming desire to have a relationship with my father but the less of one that I do have the better I do in my daily life. Thank you for sharing your story. It helped me realize some of my own feelings. Be brave and trust your gut!"
WitchesVsPatriarchy,fd7zg57,t3_ek62z4,1578212181.0,Wow this made me cry. Blessings to you! This felt like a big hug thank you for sharing.
ptsd,fcyr942,t1_fcwvt93,1578085413.0,"Iâ€™m glad this helped. I know feeling like a human garbage fire sucks but think about it this way, fires canâ€™t burn if you donâ€™t give them fuel to burn. Thoughts are invasive and fuel to that fire. Therapy gave me tools to dim that dumpster fire. CBT was a big one that at first I didnâ€™t see the value in but with time and practice I now see my thoughts that fuel that fire and I turn them into water to not only extinguish the flames of that fire  but fuel my internal desire for what Iâ€™m most passionate about. Helping others is a big one, so thank you for reading and considering another perspective. PTSD is tough. What works for me may not work for others but I think having knowledge and trying something new never hurts anyone and you just never know whatâ€™s going to stick. Be brave."
ptsd,fcw59z3,t3_ej536l,1578017471.0,"My best advice would be in your very own title. You are changing. And if you donâ€™t like it keep changing! But allow yourself the freedom to be present and know you wonâ€™t always be this way. Iâ€™ve been diagnosed PTSD for 6 years and 3 in therapy. Iâ€™m still snappy. Iâ€™m still learning and changing. Therapy helps when it is consistent. Yoga and meditation helps too. Discover more about yourself and know that who you are today is not a reflection of who you may be in the future. Right now sucks. Let it suck. I know deeply how you are feeling about not liking who you are right now. Take time to be alone with that. And do not feel guilty for it! I hope therapy can help you! I know itâ€™s helped me even if just to feel like I have someone to spew all my thoughts at whoâ€™s completely unbiased. And although Iâ€™ve had luck with therapists so far, donâ€™t settle if you donâ€™t click. Find someone else and keep moving! Donâ€™t hesitate to ask me anything if you feel inclined to do so. Iâ€™ll do my best but I am no professional. I just relate to feeling like a human garbage fire and not feeling like you have much control over it. Be well and take time to yourself!"
CPTSD,fcvpehi,t1_fcvo1zk,1578007110.0,"I feel that same way. I feel it as both a burden and a blessing however. Now we get to do it right with generations of what not to do as examples of how to get it right. We now know thanks to previous generations just sucking it up that what they were sucking up was venom. Pure poison that we now have knowledge and better understanding which translates to poor mental health which also leads to poor physical health. 

I know this wonâ€™t be easy, Iâ€™ve been in and out of therapy for most of my life, but only after being injured in a car accident have I really begun to understand what a mile long train pile up of bullshit Iâ€™ve been handed down by multiple generations of just winging it. I have a mother who was physically abused by my father and then in turn physically and mentally abused me. I have grandparents who witnessed war and major drug and alcohol addicted parents which they have never really spoken of. I have other grandparents who were emotionally neglected due to family size and poverty because of that. Thereâ€™s just an overwhelming weight coming down three generations of crap shoots on both sides and damnit if third time is the charm! It takes time and the healing is a lot most of the time. BUT I believe with the amount of knowledge we have today we can overcome all of it. My biggest hurdle currently is the reaction of my mother to me getting things right and maintaining health boundaries. She spews hate at me still but I am getting more resilient and unforgiving of my emotions as they come. I wonâ€™t be a bottle anymore. I wonâ€™t be an emotional dumping ground! 2020 is going to be a ride"
realwitchcraft,fcvo54y,t1_fcvlnkl,1578006316.0,"In the spirit of trying to keep things positive, think of how many people saw your comment and immediately started researching regardless. Hidden comments and downvotes can sometimes gain more viewers then the rest. You may have just sparked some interest where someone may have had no idea this world exists!"
CPTSD,fcvnfw7,t3_eivjt3,1578005874.0,How sad it is to see how similar all of these comments are! Iâ€™m glad this is something you have chosen to speak about. One thing I have always been curious about is where these parents got this from? We Villainize our parents for behaving like this but we donâ€™t ever ask why they are that way in the first place. Generation trauma is a thing. Thank you for being brave enough to break the cycle!
realwitchcraft,fcvl779,t1_fcvkc0h,1578004476.0,Wow really? Dogs would be so disappointed.
realwitchcraft,fcvkufd,t3_ej5abm,1578004253.0,I upvoted your comments. I agree they were way out of line. I get that more science minded people may be defensive but my momma always taught me that if you donâ€™t have anything nice to say donâ€™t say anything! Interesting about pumice! Thank you for sharing. Iâ€™ve had a real attraction to â€œholyâ€ stones of any kind and I keep a few pieces Iâ€™ve found over the years among my crystal collection but never really did any research into why I kept them or what their properties are. Thank you and I hope you have a happy new year!
DontFuckWithCats,fby2nyr,t3_eezaw9,1577206619.0,Thank you for pointing this out. I definitely believe mental health and itâ€™s care is still very much in its infancy. Add generational trauma into the mix as well. I imagine the mother experienced trauma in her life as well which likely could have been passed to her son even if she was a loving caring mother to Luka. Merry Christmas to you hope you are well and taking care of you. This documentary wasnâ€™t something I personally wished I would have watched this close to Christmas!
