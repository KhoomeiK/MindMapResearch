ParticlePhysics,ffby9th,t3_ess35z,1579786607.0,"In brief, it's a result of the unitarity of the Cabibbo Kobayashi Maskawa (CKM) matrix. Quark propagation eigenstates are not aligned with the eigenstates of the weak interaction, so in general there's a big mixing matrix that connects the quark flavours to the W and Z bosons, but it is heavily constrained both by mathematics, physics and experiment. Mathematically, this matrix is necessarily unitary in order to respect symmetries of the Lagrangian, which constrains its coefficients to obey certain relations. Physically, its number of degrees of freedom gets further reduced by removing unphysical phases inside the quark fields (mixing in these directions doesn't affect physical states). These two facts predict that there are no tree level lagrangian elements that permit FCNCs of this type, though they do permit them to exist at ~~tree~~ loop level. 

In addition, FCNCs are further reduced at loop level due to the Glashow - Iliopoulos - Maiani mechanism (the full generality of which also contains the above justification for the absence of tree level terms).

This, conveniently, is then empirically verified in experiments, meaning this fairly minimal coupling of the electroweak sector and the quarks does the job correctly. Modifications beyond the Standard Model can create such terms, which means that the new model needs to have some way to reduce their occurrence."

* RPG Limit Break: RPG-only speedrun marathon
* ESA: the European Speedrunning Association's Marathon
* Big Bad Game-a-thon: Awful games, done quick
* Weekly randomizer races: many randomizer runs have regular practice times
* Regional language events such as Zocktoberfest or Bourg-la-Run  

EDIT: Some other good suggestions from the comments

* Benelux Speedrunner Gathering: mini-mini ESA if so to speak, focused on Benelux runners, but streams are in English
* Speed Games United - speedrunning event organized in Finland, streams are in English.
* GTA Marathon - marathon focused on GTA series and ""GTA clones"" (True Crime, Saints Row, Bully, RDR, etc.). Has a lot of games and categories showcased, really good stuff if you enjoyed VC/SA runs on ESA/GDQ.
* Grandpoobear's Mario Masters Colosseum
* Frames Fatales, event for women speedrunners
* Zelda Dungeon Marathon
* Kusogrande: More awful games done quick"
ParticlePhysics,fdqj5va,t1_fdqgoby,1578667960.0,"Well, *something* has to interact with the extra dimension, otherwise it has no physical impact, you'd never be able to prove its existence.

 In addition, if the dimension exists, then matter can generically propagate through it, it is difficult to justify why particles wouldn't be able to go through the extra dimension."
ParticlePhysics,fdqg9z6,t3_emr0kj,1578665918.0,"> Would physics break? 

We actually know what particle physics and general relativity would look like with time + 4 extended spatial dimensions, and it would not look like what we experience in our world. In particular Quantum Electrodynamics and the Strong force would change radically, the inverse cube law is one consequence but it's not the only one. In our three dimensions + time, the strong force is very strong at large scales (and binds protons together), but very weak at small scales (and so quark jets work a bit like electromagnetism as a result). This range of behaviours is very sensitive to the number of large (infinite) dimensions. Essentially, not only does adding a fifth non-compact dimension does not help in explaining physical phenomena, it predicts completely different results. 

This is why most of the activity has centered on adding compact dimensions to the mix, in which case you can eventually recover the physics of our world. 

There is one scenario where an extra infinite dimension helps in explaining physics, the Anti de Sitter / Conformal Field Theory correspondence or Holographic duality, but it is a more mathematical statement between objects commonly used in theoretical physics, a different way of arriving to the same result, so far at least."
