gradadmissions,ffee419,t1_ffee2du,1579844622.0,"No. If I have a phd already, can i get another funded phd in astronomy?"
gradadmissions,ffedv06,t1_ffdxf1j,1579844376.0,Hi! Is it possible to get a second PhD (in astronomy) in UCLA?
gradadmissions,ffbi19b,t3_esn8zn,1579766235.0,"this hit hard, man."
gradadmissions,ff98o2f,t1_ff98e5n,1579707400.0,"That’s a long wait for you. Haha.

My only worry is that my other applications, if ever I get in, might have an early deadline for confirmation and these deadlines might not hive me enough time to weigh my choices. The confirmation might be needed before the result of another program comes. Haha.

It’s difficult to apply at one program per country haha."
gradadmissions,ff97cy9,t1_ff973u4,1579706553.0,"Haha. This one is a PhD in Austria. Haha. Last year, according to their records, they started reviewing after a week. I thought applications are scheduled to be reviewed one week after the deadline but it might be just for last year. 

Well, I do a part-time job so that really helps and I do boxing on the side which really takes not just my mind off of applications but also the anxiety."
gradadmissions,ff95ts6,t1_ff955kt,1579705538.0,"On one of my applications, I submitted on the final deadline because of one referee. It was January 12 and I have not received any notification yet that they’re reviewing the applications already. Nothing has changed in the portal ever since. Haha.

It’s frustrating. Now, I have this idea in my mind that my application is so awful, they don’t even want to look at it. Hahaha.

Good luck to us, indeed!"
WhitePeopleTwitter,ff8lhf3,t3_es64cd,1579684322.0,This hit hard. But what if I had a bad life?
depression,ff84ckd,t3_es3msr,1579665649.0,I’m so proud of you.
