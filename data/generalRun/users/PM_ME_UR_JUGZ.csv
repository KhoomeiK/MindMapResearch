>The CHP sent websites ""cease and desist"" notices in an effort to get the photos off the Internet. The Catsouras family hired ReputationDefender to help remove the photos, but they continue to spread. ReputationDefender estimates that it has persuaded websites to remove 2,500 instances of the photos, but accepts that removing them from the Internet completely is impossible

television,ffm7ro3,t1_ffm5m2l,1580049974.0,"I mean like our expectations of how the force worked, from what was already established in the ~30 years of time that had passed from episode 1 to episode 6. Force projecting, what force ghosts were capable of doing (influencing the real world), force healing, kylo and Rey basically being quantum entangled. How powerful you could be without training. How basically anyone was capable of being force sensative (Finn implied he was force sensative, broom kid) when before it was pretty much something you were born with I guess? Idk just a lot of shit that totally skews what was previously accepted as achievable, and if they were able to do what they did now in previous movies, it would totally change the outcome.
