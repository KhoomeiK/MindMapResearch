facepalm,fekrfrb,t1_fekqooe,1579206062.0,"Agreed.  As an example, the University of Iowa had hired (and fired apparently) a ""diversity coordinator""  to the tune of $225,000.00.  I am not going to argue whether a ""diversity coordinator"" is necessary but I would argue $225,000.00 for such a position is too much money."
facepalm,fekq6k0,t1_fekoj0f,1579205323.0,"I know that.  Either way, not allowing for bankruptcy is one part of the student loan issue as it doesn't matter how high tuition is raised, the Universities and colleges know that the loans are 1) (virtually) impossible to discharge and 2) guaranteed by the federal government.  These two factors are why tuition has been raised to ridiculous heights over the last 20 years or so.  If students would be able to file bankruptcy, the Universities and colleges would have to stop raising tuition or make it more manageable as people could just discharge the loans after school.  

I guess my original comment ""taken care of"" wasn't well worded.  It would definitely help if bankruptcy was available to those who simply can't pay back the loans."
facepalm,fekmr3n,t3_epktir,1579203281.0,Student loan debt issue could be taken care of via one thing:  allowing those who can’t pay back the loans to file bankruptcy.  This would allow people to use the bankruptcy system to help them just like any other investment loan or business loan does.

Iran had the timetable for their attack, they planned it and completely bungled it and it is...Trump’s fault for killing a terrorist leader who had attacked US forces continuously, killed a US citizen and planned the attack on the US embassy.  

Amazing stuff.  Just freaking amazing."
iamatotalpieceofshit,fedglr1,t1_fedf3wn,1579010975.0,"This is a good comment.  The small business owner is who gets hurt with the minimum wage increase the most.  A lot of small businesses (in US) only clear $4k a month in profits.  You increase the minimum wage and you are looking at a lot less in profits without dramatically increasing pricing or reducing staff/hours/etc or a little of both. 

This comment isn’t supposed to be seen as being against a minimum wage increase, I just think a lot of people do not understand how it impacts small businesses."

People who get stuck on “imminent” don’t quite understand that Suleimani was planning attacks against US forces.  What would be imminent?  He had just killed a US contractor and then organized an attack on the US embassy.  He was planning for more and you all say....

In Chicago, none of the ""liberals"" that I know are against going after him for as much as the law will allow because he really made a lot of their own causes look weaker as a result.  Hoaxes are no joke and shouldn't be written off.

Take this line from this article:  ""Trump’s governance itself is legally in question right now""  - This is unequivocally false.   Trump is the President and will remain so with all the powers it holds until and IF the Senate votes to remove him. Period.  No wishful thinking will change that.

This situation sounds similar to that:  these two always had this in them to do this to you.  I would reflect on other things that they did to others that would have indicated that they had it in them to do this.
