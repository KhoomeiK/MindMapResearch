I saw a dog running down the interstate once and it scarred me for life but he made it as far as I know bc I turned around and looked for him - road pancake or alive. as a cat lover though, this would fucking kill me."

todayilearned,fd7xkak,t1_fd6laxl,1578211514.0,"i'm just saying, he was 14. think about it, like i'm not trying to justify it, or even defend him, i just see a youth of color who has grown up in a city known for violence and hardship, who as a child, got his first felony. and not even for something violent. i'm not blaming any one thing for it, and i don't want to assume anything about him either, i just find it sad that something in his life went awry for him to go down this path, for him to think this plan was feasible. think about when you were 14. you were probably a freshman in high school, and while you might not have done something this stupid, think about the maturity level of a 14 year old. they're teenagers, but they are still very young and still technically children. what he did was wrong and really stupid, but maybe he's mentally ill. maybe he was abused. maybe he had a sterling childhood, who even knows? i just feel like he could have had some help and rehabilitation had they cared enough to not only give him probation at the time. am i saying lock him up? no, but they could have definitely looked more into him and pondered what would make a child want to do this in the first place. 

sorry for typing a novel, i'm just trying to explain why i feel some kind of sympathy for him. that's just my opinion. i'm by no means endorsing any kind of behavior like this, if anything, as another commenter pointed out, it could have gone very badly very quickly had a dangerous situation arisen, but i just feel like this man was failed by the system as a child and could have very well turned around during those formative years had a little more probing been done on the situation."
todayilearned,fd7vpoi,t1_fd6n4oz,1578210863.0,"i agree, and who even could comment on what his life was like before? i have no idea what happened in this kid's life to send him down this path, but i don't know the entire story, either. it doesn't justify it, but it can kind of explain why things are why they are."

todayilearned,fd7en5r,t1_fd7dxwq,1578203279.0,sounds like you could do some basic reading on nature vs nurture and read a couple of the articles detailing this incident and the ones that occurred after. i'm failing to see where i have diagnosed this person anywhere on any of my responses... i am simply commenting my opinion.
todayilearned,fd6jiet,t1_fd6ixcp,1578191995.0,"Yes, these are all events that happened after the original 2009 incident, during which he was 14 years old. Something clearly went awry in this young persons life to lead him to these choices. I read that comment."

todayilearned,fd63g5n,t1_fd61we7,1578185012.0,"Man. Clearly this kid was troubled. I do want to believe though, that had he intended ill will in dressing as a cop, he would have done that instead of going for a ride a long. Who knows though. I feel bad for him. I know that violence in any way is not ok, but it seems he didnâ€™t beat his mom, but pushed her and shoved her. I donâ€™t know if I missed the gang affiliation, but I didnâ€™t see it mentioned. 

Edit: just kidding, I reread and saw the part about the gun case. Still so sad. Tragic, really."

todayilearned,fd5oqik,t1_fd5of6s,1578179767.0,For sure. He didnâ€™t even take a gun from what I read. Not like he was out trying to kill people. I guess he was caught again doing this at 21.
todayilearned,fd5o1ms,t3_ek3ya2,1578179546.0,"Damn... that kind of makes me sad. Sounds like he was looking for a place to fit in. And while what he did was wrong, he was 14... poor kid copped a felony for it. I donâ€™t know the situation but it sounds like he was not doing anything crazy, but rather was interested."
todayilearned,fd5n3nh,t3_ek3yiq,1578179268.0,Birds definitely have dialects that vary from region to region. Recently learned this and was very impressed by that. I could see them picking up other dialects from migration for sure.

personalfinance,fd5a37d,t3_ek372y,1578175589.0,"You might not be allowed to take those classes or even be enrolled unless you can straighten out the aid, as you canâ€™t start a class and not be able to pay for it. Do the sap appeal and be prepared to make your case. This happened to me and I was very honest with them, I told them I was dealing with a lot of stress from starting a new job on top of going back to school and they were very understanding. I ended up not going back but if you are determined to get an education, be prepared to work very hard to reverse those grades and to prove that you deserve aid. Donâ€™t be like me and be paying for one semester of aid for 5 years for classes you failed. Decide now if you think you can turn it around this semester. If not, take a break or try community college where the loss will not cost so much. I wish you the best of luck."
