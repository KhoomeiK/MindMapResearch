ChoosingBeggars,ffjur8m,t3_etx7b9,1580007506.0,I am a girl and the only time I even give a second thought to what a person is driving is if they have a really expensive car I think “what a douche”. I think guys think we care about it a lot more than we actually do.

TeenMomOGandTeenMom2,fff4d74,t3_et45rp,1579875379.0,What is with all these father-daughter dances on this show? Is this a popular thing in the US? I have never ONCE heard of them where I live.
