I think she's ignorant. And not in a pejorative way, I just think she's ignorant to the ramifications of continuing a relationship of any sort with abuser guy, and ignorant to the fact that abuser guy has NOT changed (and probably never will).

Guys like abuser guy tend to target compassionate, empathetic people. Unfortunately with young compassionate, empathetic women, a certain level of naivete is also present.

I went through this. Not while in a relationship with another person, but I did try to be ""friends"" with my abuser for a while. Obviously, it didn't go well. We got back together for one week and I realized he hadn't changed and never would."

It sounds like you're having an identity crisis, which is separate from but also related to your newfound sobriety.

college,ffh7wtw,t1_ffgni0y,1579925642.0,"This. The only times I didn't go to class last semester were if :

a) my kiddo was sick/had a day off school and my husband couldn't work from home or my dad couldn't come take care of the lil bub

b) I had an appointment (at one point I had to take some stupid transfer student training that was only offered at times when I had class)

c) I was sick (mostly still dragged my butt to class though)

To be fair, had I gone to college immediately after high school, I doubt that I would have had th discipline to show up or be engaged in the work. I also had the ""smart kid"" mentality and was lazy AF. Now I realize how fortunate I am to have the opportunity to go to college and don't want to waste it.

Maybe OP should consider taking time off and coming back when he's ready. Best decision I've ever made, honestly."

oneanddone,ffdknuh,t3_erj4ck,1579822899.0,"I have many reasons. I'll group them into categories of ""selfish"" and ""unselfish"":

As a disclaimer, of COURSE I love my son and am so lucky to have (imo) the coolest kid ever as mine. I just am not a fan of motherhood in the general sense.


""Selfish""

1. I don't want any more kids.

2. Babies suck.

3. Kids under 5 are worse than babies.

4. Seven year olds are straight up Hellspawn (Mine is 5 and I'm not looking forward to 7)

5. I like wine and vaping and I don't want to give up either for 9 months.

6. Academic pursuits and work are so much more nourishing to my soul than motherhood.

7. I don't want to pay double (or more) for childcare.

8. My son will be 18 when I'm 38 and having an adult child at that age sounds f*cking amazing. I don't want to reset that clock.

9. Pregnancy is awful. Mine was practically perfect as far as pregnancies go, but it STILL sucks.

10. I wanna do cool shit with my cool husband.


""Unselfish""

1. I have bipolar II which is heritable and affects my ability to parent when I'm in depressive episodes (yes, I am medicated, but sometimes the meds stop working/need a dosage adjustment and no, I wasn't diagnosed prior to having my first)

2. I don't think I could split (or ""multiply"" as the people who push more kids like to say) my love and attention between two or more kids. It wouldn't be fair to either of them.

3. We can't afford more kids. It would do any further kids and our existing kid a disservice to have less resources.

4. The world is overpopulated as it is.

5. I don't want to raise any more kids in these messed up political and environmental crises.

My husband is going to get a vasectomy soon and I have the paragard IUD. If for some strange reason we decide we want another kid, we'll adopt an older child."
BipolarReddit,ffd1zri,t3_ess59i,1579811839.0,"My 5 year old overheard me talking about it to my husband and I explained from there. I just told him mommy has bipolar disorder and it makes mommy's moods unstable. I gave him examples of my mood changes and I think he got it.

Last night as we were tucking him into bed he said ""Raise your hand if you have bipolar!"" which I got a big kick out of."
DecidingToBeBetter,ff00qmb,t1_few9dfq,1579463955.0,"There's alot of tutorials on YouTube, but what works best for me is to cut the lace (for that you'll probably want to watch a YouTube video because it's hard to explain in writing), and use got2be glued gel or their freeze spray depending on how much hold I want."
DecidingToBeBetter,feuwvmg,t3_eqewqh,1579390758.0,"YAAAS get it!

But I also wanna say weaves are expensive AF and so is the upkeep. $200+ to install depending on whether it's a sow-in, tape, or the bead thingy (can't remember what that's called), and you have to get it redone every month or two depending on how fast your hair grows. Bundles of synthetic hair are pretty cheap but don't look as natural or last as long, while bundles of human hair are usually pretty expensive (I've heard that Alibaba has some good deals on human bundles though). I had weaves from ages 15-18 and spent so much money on them.

I personally like human hair 360 lace wigs. If you get them professionally installed it's pretty expensive from what I understand, but I install mine myself and use products that can be taken off easily so that I don't have to sleep with them on. I just ordered a 24"" body wave and I'm so excited to get it.

I also taught myself (thanks YouTube) how to do builder gel nail extensions. It's not as difficult as acrylic imo, and gives me more control of the final outcome. The initial investment is kinda high, but I've been doing it for about a year and have saved alot of money overall.

Cheers to you friend, it's a new year and a new decade, so live your best life!"

relationship_advice,fedkjb1,t3_eoi396,1579013819.0,"She sounds exactly how my best friend was like at 19. She is right now in her second rehab facility at 28. 

If your girlfriend doesn't stop drinking at the rate she's going, it will consume her. You have to ask yourself if you can take the heartache of watching the person you love destroy her life repeatedly. Of course, she could successfully get sober, alot of people do. But, you have to be prepared for either situation if you are to continue a relationship with her.

Alcoholism changes people. They become the worst versions of themselves and they know it and end up hating themselves and not giving a fuck if they live or die (in my experience, clearly not all people with alcoholism are like this). 

If she was as trashed as you say she was last night (not that I don't believe you, it's that people have differing ideas on the level of drunkenness they're seeing), she probably doesn't remember trying to make a move on your friend. However, that does not make her any less responsible for her actions.

If it were me, I would cut my losses and get out now. I hate saying this, but I wish I had gotten out of my best friend's life before she became as emotionally dependent on me as she is now. Now I feel obligated to continue our relationship when I really don't want to see her at all until she's 100% sober and working on her shit."
BipolarReddit,fedihr1,t3_eoepy9,1579012385.0,"I hated the Mirena. I had it years ago, way before I was diagnosed with BP or medicated. It made my moods swing horribly. I pulled it out of myself during what I now recognize as a hypomanic rage. Interestingly, I had nexplanon (arm implant) and it didn't affect me the same way despite having the same hormones. Now I have paragard (non hormonal iud) and it's great. The only side effect I've had is a heavier period, which is fine, I don't care.

That being said, my good friend who also has BP has been on Mirena since we were teenagers. A couple years ago she got it taken out to see if it was affecting her cystic acne and mood and had it out for a year and neither improved.

All in all different people have different reactions to different hormonal birth control."
