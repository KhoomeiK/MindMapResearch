Anxiety,fex922i,t3_eqszok,1579427065.0,I need this. Thanks
depression,fek0j62,t3_epdnfo,1579190003.0,"Oh damn. I feel like a waste. I don't know what I did with the past 10 years of my life. I feel like I went through the motion. Work, home, sleep, repeat cycle. My friends most likely find me annoying for even complaining. How do I explain to them that hey, I am unhappy and just because I have the minimum covered like a job that can pay rent and buy the basic grocery and other necessities, doesn't mean I can't I feel this way. I know there are other people that have it worse than me, far worse but I just am not happy and I feel meaningless. They probably go here it goes again, the complain. The thing is I only complain because I feel like this is crazy, how can I work for 10 years and still unable to find a purpose in life? I talk so much about it because feeling my life has no purpose has become part of the of this rudimentary routine. Sometimes I wish they can just terminate the friendship and tell me the truth rather than either ghost me or passive aggressive tell me off. I wish they end this with me. I wish everything ends with me. So tired with life. Same ol same ol"

Anxiety,fegmccw,t3_eoyczh,1579097127.0,"Yup. Anyways, very sorry for what had happened. There are times I think to myself it would've been better if I was never born. After a point, it is just tiring to continue to carry the baggage from the past."
Anxiety,feglrwg,t1_fegfhvd,1579096675.0,I like this advice. Will definitely apply it for myself too
Anxiety,fegl021,t3_eov1jp,1579096036.0,"I'm so happy for you!!! I used to read similar anecdotes and wonder if it is true, I mean it is something very routine and simple at the end of the day but that was until I tried it myself. Mine was in the same vein. I told myself I'm going to wash my hair, iron my clothes, leave the house at a certain time and catch the train to get some stuffs. Today, I did that and thereafter felt calm, like I can breathe. It feels so good. So, just like you I am going to try to ride this wave. It feels even better to have read your post today. Makes me feel happier in that airy and light way. Thank you for sharing!"
depression,febyvl4,t1_fe8m2pw,1578964446.0,"How are you so insightful? My primary question for a very long time is truly what is happiness to me and will I ever find it? Why, as you so correctly point out, I find myself trapped is because I don't know how to even go about to figure out what makes me happy in the first place. I feel even more helpless when I see other people around me happy and thriving in life whilst I only skate through it. I've had satisfaction, contentment, enjoyment but never achieved true happiness and this inability makes me feel that my life has no purpose."
depression,febxc6q,t1_feae836,1578963834.0,Thank you for your kind words
bulimia,febwlmq,t1_fe8wknm,1578963543.0,Thank you for your kind words. I will definitely won't give up
depression,fe8jm61,t1_fe6y0eh,1578926861.0,"I feel alone when I see my existence as pointless. Funny when someone asked if I enjoyed working and when I replied I'm indifferent because it is just work to me I was told that I'm too young to feel like this and how am I to survive if this is my outlook at this age. I was told to look for other jobs that pay more and allow more flexibility. I feel so depressed hearing that because it makes me feel extremely dumb and incompetent like it is that easy to get a high paying job with great flexibility and I unlike the mass am not able to clinch such a job. It also makes me feel so low, like I am that worthless that I have to settle for this job and lifestyle. Unfortunately, I don't have the qualification that is in demand where I can just go around and make demands. In my current position, more money means more work and boy, do I feel what is on my plate is enough. I hate it when people kept saying impliedly that, at the end of the day, I am not successful. Bloody hell"
depression,fe8i0jf,t1_fe6xqci,1578926390.0,"Oh wow. That line ""to fund a life I am not entirely sure is worth living"". I question myself a lot on this. We spend most of our waking moments at work. The money from work, we spend it on holiday, clothes, items, which provide a temporary boost of enjoyment. However, at the end of the day we still clock in and out. I feel the money spent on those enjoyments are as a goal for us to look forward and to be happy but I also feel that it is there as a goal because we are generally not happy in the first place otherwise it wouldn't bring us so much enjoyment and thereafter depression when we have to go back to reality (talking more about myself here). If we are not happy then, realistically and statistically, it has to be due to what we have mainly be doing with our life which is working. Then again, I need to work, otherwise I can't even live. I mean I need a roof, food and all those necessities to survive but it also begs the question, why do I need to survive in the first place? What is the purpose of me being alive? I generally feel hopeless about having to continue to live when everything is just a shit show"

bulimia,fe8b6fy,t3_enxhs9,1578924391.0,"The thing is I'm unhappy with and without bulimia. I hate that I look at it as a method to cope with the negative aspects of my life. As much as I derive satisfaction from the physical sensations of purging, I hate that I actually enjoy it. Also, I hate that in the span of time I do not succumb to bulimia, I feel like I am hollow and bland and cannot justify my state of unhappiness. It doesn't make sense to me that when I don't purge, I am still not happy. I know it is not easy and I shouldn't treat it as a mental switch but I am so frustrated that when I stop purging, I feel more unhappy. I feel so pissed at times, like what else do I need to do to be happy and content with my life? Shouldn't dealing and overcoming the constant struggles to purge suffice? What else? Why do I feel even more depressed and shitty when I don't resort to my bulimic tendencies? I actually try to be better but don't get better (although I have to admit that the longest I spent without purging is 2 weeks, not long by any standard). At this juncture, I am just tired. Sorry for the rant. I want a way out too"
bulimia,fe87q24,t1_fe14q9r,1578923538.0,"The daily struggle resonates so much with me. Everyday regardless I was successful or otherwise, I struggled with looking to purging as a method to purge the negativities of life. I hate that I feel that if I can purge all the food I've eaten, I feel good and can now conquer those negativities. I hate that I need that and without it, I feel bland"
bulimia,fdzo7xf,t1_fdpqa33,1578792367.0,Thanks for the tip! It is just quite hard that the negative consequences take time to develop so in your head it is not as immediate as the physical gratification
bulimia,fdzo0cs,t1_fdp39ga,1578792274.0,I hope this year will be great for all of us
bulimia,f8tx6dh,t1_f8rzni8,1574813478.0,"Thank you so very much for sharing this and most of all for your kind and encouraging words. Feel like there is still hope. I'm going to save the last paragraph with me, always. Thank you"
