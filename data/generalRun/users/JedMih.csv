However, IF you plan on going on into math research AND you can work through this now, it's going to really benefit you down the line. For most people, research is really frustrating the majority of the time. As a student, you're fed carefully curated problems that (ideally) are at just the right level. As a researcher, you have nothing but your best guess as to whether the problem is even solvable. The more you can work through your natural anxieties and your various inhibitors of motivation now, the better you'll be later.

My first instinct, for what it's worth, would be to split the two white stones by placing your third stone two intersections above the middle stone.

The play from here will get rather complicated.  Such is the nature of 9x9.  The opening often involves ""can they really be separated?"" questions plus life and death problems.

The key concept is keeping yourself connected and powerful while keeping your opponent separated and weak. However, the 9x9 is fast enough that you might find your opponents two struggling groups have managed to grab just enough territory that you can't afford the komi.

re: opening at the middle point

Obviously, you won't guess correctly most of the time but you should try to understand (roughly) the purpose of each move. Doing this will help with learning the Joseki, since these are some of the times you'll be most likely to guess correctly. 

In general, try to understand the rough ""story line"" of the game. Who has more territory? Who has more power? Which groups are being attacked and what is the attacker gaining from it? How are stones effectively sacrificed?

Obviously, there are levels and levels of analysis in each pro game that an amateur couldn't begin to understand but there's also a lot you'll absorb naturally without even realizing you're doing it. I didn't say it before but I wouldn't get bogged down in any pro analysis of a professional game. That tends to be at too high a level until you are a top amateur."

There's a ton of randomness to the process.

Moreover, the various subs all have different ""cultures"" to them. Comments that would be massively downvotes in one sub will be massively upvoted in another. There are plenty of people with tons of Karma who don't treat others nicely.

Having said that, it does seem like a reasonably effective process for people to be able to create the types of subreddits they desire.

With respect to the life and death problems, its important to find ones that are challenging enough that it takes effort to read them out correctly but not so advanced that you can't find the answer. Ideally, you wouldn't even need the solutions as a reference -- you'd be confident you found the right answer.

As a lay person with no relevant experience, I am agreeing with the /u/jezzmund's assertion that Special Ed training would help a person deal with a variety of behaviors that could be called irrational. They need to be able to handle a wide variety of situations, including the bullying and malevolence that might arise from the so-called normal kids.

Again, I don't have any experience. For the record, I would believe someone if they can assess from their own experience or cite a study that dealing with a malevolent narcissist requires a completely different toolkit than what a Special Ed teacher would likely be taught and/or develop.

From what I've seen, Trump has some very childish tendencies. My best guess is that ANY elementary school teacher's experience is relevant and that Special Ed training would prove useful, in general, not just in the realm of irrationality.

&#x200B;

From the third paragraph, I absolutely agree that resultant behavior is massively different. To me, that's a separate issue from whether a particular professional would well equipped to deal with those two different behaviors.

The only ""luck"" in go is your opponent making a mistake well below their level. It's not uncommon for someone to say ""I got lucky"" if they win a game that they were clearly behind in.

There are analogs of ""bluffs"" in go. A bluff in Go is when you play a move that you know won't work but it's a sufficiently complicated position that you hope your opponent will play a suboptimal move. Unlike poker, bluffs are NOT part of ideal play but they do come up in certain player's games occasionally.

I used to make my living playing poker, roughly 20 years ago. I lived in Las Vegas and was walking distance to the Bellagio. The internet poker boom was around that time and by the end of my time there, I was mostly playing online since the games were much more profitable. I also found myself playing a lot of Go again since I was desperate to play a complete information game with no luck factor."

Love your argument!!

EDIT: The comment is not saying Trump is like someone on the Autism Spectrum or with other special needs. Instead it is saying that part of Warren's background involves learning how to deal with irrationality. That will be useful for directly facing Trump.

EDIT2: I removed the initial ""lol"" since a number of people seem upset, in general. I'm assuming the senator's training dealt with elementary school aged kids. That's the part I found amusing and yes, comparing Trump to a toddler or pre-teen is not fair to toddlers or pre-teens."

However, if someone seems to be showing signs of cognitive decline before they've even been elected, that's significant at any age. Moreover, there are statistical likelihoods associated with being over 75, over 80, etc. and given how demanding the job is, these are certainly relevant.

The analog of ""Greed"" in the game is huge, but also important is ""Jealousy"". One could argue that the metaphorical use of these from notions from real life are somewhat arbitrary, but greed and jealousy are such natural fits!

I was once teaching Go to a friend who was a professional poker player. I mentioned that, stereotypically, Korean pros have a very aggressive style. He said ""That's true in poker, too!"" It took me a second to process whether I could consider ""Aggressive Poker Playing"" as akin to ""Aggressive Go Playing"". While they are clearly very different things, the fact that ""aggressive"" is an apt description means there are many similarities and  a strong analogy between them.

 

I'm curious to see how much of what we learn from AI can be fit into conceptual frameworks and how much will just remain ""machine understanding"" that never quite jives with how our own neural nets typically develop."
