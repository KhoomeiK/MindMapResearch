Documentaries,ff08pak,t1_ff01vd7,1579466371.0,"Aside from the act of sex itself (which isn't bad or good, it's just sex), sex work is linked with tons of negative externalities, drug use/substance abuse being a major one, and psychological damage being another. 

Sex work also has no long term future. Women get in it when they're young, a large portion of them don't develop any other marketable skills, and when they hit the age of 32 they're out of luck because there aren't many clients into them anymore.

There's a risk of pregnancy and STDs, which while contraceptives can prevent those things, we don't live in an ideal society and there are a lot of sex workers that aren't using them. I know there's a huge difference between legal sex work and illegal sex work when it comes to this but still, it's a factor in a lot of places.

Finally, there is a social stigma associated with it, even completely removed from religion. 

I don't have a problem with people selling sex, I don't even think it should be illegal. I wouldn't want someone I love in that line of work though, being a sex worker shouldn't be held up as an aspirational goal for a woman in any society.

Now you could go to somewhere like Berkeley and still have to jump through a ton of online hoops, just to have a shot, not even guaranteed.

That's why it's so hard for me to take career advice from older people. Chances are younger folks now are way more qualified, the opportunities are just lacking, so the artificial ""competition"" is higher for limited spots.
