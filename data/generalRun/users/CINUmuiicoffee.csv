depression,febzy5s,t1_fd9cukh,1578964750.0,"I’m not sure. Depression is surely hard to diagnose. But I would probably say better now then sorry later. I regret letting my depression get this far, I hope it doesn’t happen to you too. Watch your health and see if you notice any changes. It’s better to get help before it gets worse."
depression,fd6zbji,t3_ek5mgc,1578197578.0,Can you focus on things? Do you eat too much or eat too little? Wake up too early? Think too much? Care too much or too little? Anxiety? Insomnia? Irritation  and mood swings? Back aching and back pain? Joint pain? Digestive system acting weird? Decreased pain tolerance and everything hurts more? Eye problems and fogginess? Stomach pain and queasiness? Memory problems?
depression,fd6xz4w,t3_ek5mgc,1578197109.0,"Can you sleep at night. 
Are you too tired to wake up in the morning. 
Do you find yourself thinking where did the time go. 
Does your heart feel empty. 
Can you do the same things you could done so easily. 
Does your chest feel tight. 
Your back aches and your head hurts? 
These are some of the few symptoms of depression."
depression,fd6wz71,t3_ek7113,1578196770.0," Wow I’m so sorry.. I know that experience, not loosing a husband but opening up only to be crushed. I broke down somewhere about 6 months ago and nothing’s been the same since then. We pretend everything is fine but after I just let it out... they joked about my depression and just fucking blamed it on my friend and said I’m fine. I’m just acting. Yea. I’m sorry you had to go through this. I’m sorry you are going through this.

 I believe sometimes self care is the best thing even though it’s hard. Out yourself around people who care and let go of the people who don’t have time to. Someday he might come back but it doesn’t mean that person changed. Maybe he didn’t mean it but sometimes thing you shout out in anger are your deepest feelings. It’s not always true but sometimes it is. I’m only 14 so I’m not very smart with this so I’m sorry if this sounds stupid but I hope you can find someone who will help you."

I don’t like talking about this but god let me tell you, you need to move. Either that or stay in her room for a few days with her and you’ll see. Seriously stuff like that becomes traumatic."

I’m too comfortable and safe in mine. Sure they hurt me and abuse me emotionally and sometimes physically but I’ve dealt with this for years. I used to think it was my fault but I hope you make it. Make it out. I’ve sunk too low. My family is like a show. We keep pretending and saying our lines no matter what happened backstage."

abusiveparents,fcox3ia,t3_eib70t,1577843963.0,"Maybe that’s too much. Too much trust to put on someone. Just voice record, save up videos and then go to court. Ask them to let them give you freedom and money to get a apartment and get one of those things where they have to stay away from you."
abusiveparents,fcowwza,t3_eib70t,1577843819.0,Aww... that’s so ducking sad. I hate abusive and manipulative people like them. I can relate to some of the stuff you go to even though yours is worse. You are in such a sh*tty position and it’s sad bc that’s life. Do you have any money saved up? Personally I would use the time where they are asleep and take their money and leave when it’s time. But start slow or just take a lot. Pack up your cards and stuff. It only gets worse if you stay. Go to a teacher you know when school starts again and pack all your “books” in your bag. Hopefully they will help you. Show your bruises and maybe some recorded stuff. It’s proof.
depression,fcouzov,t3_eiba99,1577842299.0,Happy New Years! 💕
abusiveparents,fcoumff,t3_eib70t,1577842008.0, Fuck that’s so messed up. I wish I could just hug you and cradle you to sleep. Okay maybe that’s a little too creepy but yea. You can’t really depend on anyone in this world. I wish I could say something comforting but my minds blank.
aww,fcond75,t1_fcnuy65,1577836568.0, You are right! You can see the tiger’s eyes look dazed and not-really-here kinda look. That’s disgusting.

depression,fcnslad,t3_ehmqfh,1577817621.0,"Hahaha shitty ass might do that! But for like what, 4 days? I weigh 140 because I stupidly gained 5 pounds in one week. Fuck. Imma just drink water besides I’m barely eating shit rn anyway. Imma fucking binge eat today then starve myself for the rest of this damn week. I don’t give a damn if it’s unhealthy bc goddamn when was I healthy."
depression,fcns8ye,t3_ei30zb,1577817438.0, It’s sad how we hated this but grew attached to it. It’s home now. There is depression that we’ve known for all our life’s then there is that other world. The world seems so bright as if you don’t belong there. In a way it’s scary and terrifying while depression feels like a safe place.
depression,fcns19x,t1_fcnf9mz,1577817330.0,"Yea now that I think about it, life without depression seems scary. Something new and I hate new things I hate change. I don’t know if I can live without depression. How do I act? How do I behave? It would all be new and that’s scary. I am to scared to be happy nowadays. Feeling emotions more than sadness and hollow sounds terrifying."

aww,fce1hq2,t1_fccjq4s,1577615926.0,"And honestly how do you even get there from the sentence “beautiful but sad.” That has always been my go to thing and tbh I don’t see a problem with it? Never did I say the kitty isn’t unique or that it doesn’t have a lonely home. 

 Like you said “You can’t get angry at someone for not understanding what you meant when you gave zero information to go off.” There was no information about me disliking the cat nor saying anything bad about the disease. The person got mad over nothing (as you said) and accused me. Am I not allowed to defend myself?"
aww,fcdzhgx,t1_fccjq4s,1577615388.0, Maybe I shouldn’t have wrote “ It’s funny how you gave me hate before trying to understand what I meant” but I mean my other comment was right above the other saying I believed it hurt the kitty. Maybe it wasn’t shown 🤷🏻‍♀️
aww,fcdywgi,t1_fccjq4s,1577615193.0, But I only stated it was beautiful but sad? Who even gets angry at that? I wasn’t even angry lmao 😂 I was explaining the situation. I had also written another comment after that one because I forgot to add the reason why it’s sad. It’s literally right above this one?
aww,fcccaco,t1_fcc7a3u,1577596766.0,"Also what made you so mad lol 😂 You must have been in a bad mood, that happens to the best of us."
aww,fccbx0p,t1_fcc5ijo,1577596645.0,I accidentally mistaken it for albino c: but thank you for the explanation
aww,fccbpg1,t1_fcc7a3u,1577596577.0, It’s funny how you gave me hate before trying to understand what I meant. I accidentally confused it for another genetic disease which hurts. I believe it’s called albino because I remembered it causes you to be all white. Also why all the dislikes lmao. Anyway I do find her/him unique. Please do not put words in my mouth. I’m sure I also wrote it must hurt and stated it’s beautiful.

This is affecting many things and I think I might have a eating disorder which also caused low iron. I hope you and O both can figure out what’s happening.

depression,fcaybcl,t3_egxcvx,1577579022.0,"End the engagement before you marry and do something you regret. Break up now and lay of romance for a while. Sometimes you need to stop trying to find love from somewhere else and look at yourself. I know it’s hard to love yourself but that’s the start. You’ll feel lonely, miss him but it’s not really love. It’s something you got used to, a habit. I have no experience but trust me, you need this. There will be times you want something physical, anything and you might make yourself believe you are in love. You aren’t. It’s you trying to make yourself believe and pretend it’s okay.

 When it’s time, that person will show or maybe you will find that person whether it be a man, woman or something else. You need to let go sometimes. Sometimes that loneliness is the answer."

depression,fcaxd18,t3_egs2tc,1577578487.0," I heard using a picture and talking to that person helps. Maybe eat a dinner with your dad and let yourself cry. Sometimes that’s the best answer; cry. You’ll feel better afterwords no matter how long it takes. Whether 2 hours or 6. It hurts, and sometimes tiring yourself by crying might be the only way."
depression,fcax2q6,t3_egw1u2,1577578320.0,S***. It’s happening to me too. Hopefully I have more time until then. I hope you find something else. To not be able to enjoy music is sh*ty. I already am loosing my love for books. Something I’ve enjoyed since I was 5.
