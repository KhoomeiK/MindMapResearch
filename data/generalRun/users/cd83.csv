DestinyTheGame,fec98xu,t3_eo1tva,1578968907.0,"• Which activities which currently lack matchmaking should have a matchmaking option added? Examples: Blind well, Escalation protocol, Altar of sorrow, Heroic Menagerie, 950/980 power nightmare hunts, 950/980 power nightfalls, raids... Please explain your reasons in detail. 

Blind well, Escalation protocol, Altar of sorrow are fine as public events, and are fun to drop into. It’s easy enough to hang around a public area and find enough people, and with patrols and other bounties to do, it’s not a problem waiting.

Pit of Heresy, Shattered Throne, Heroic Menagerie, 950/980 power nightmare hunts, 950/980 power nightfalls should all have in game matchmaking or LFG of some kind. Most of the time I do this with completely random people from LFG without a mic. The only difference is that the people in LFG have to go through the extra effort of finding a fireteam.

• If matchmaking were added to some of the above activities, should entering matchmaking require a completion of the concerned activity to participate in it? (example: after a player has compleed a 950 power nightmare hunt, they can enter matchmaking for that activity)

No. Remove this barrier to entry entirely. 

In game matchmaking / LFG should be more obvious in the game how to find groups. Even help messages such as ""Use the official app to find a group!"". As dumb as it sounds, I didn't even know the companion app existed until end of D2 Year 1. I always just used /r/fireteams. For casual players who don't follow the news, the entire LFG / Matchmaking experience should be easier.

• Should story mode have an option to play matchmade with other players? Warframe and several other games allow this. You can also opt to start immediately and allow other players to join your mission in progress…

YES PLEASE

• Should strikes or certain other activities with matchmaking have an option to turn it off so they can be soloed/duoed?

YES PLEASE

• Should there be an in-game LFG system for PVE activities? What sort of things would you like to see?

Incorporate the features of the companion app into the game. That would be perfect.

• Patrols - Give your feedback on patrols and exploration. What are your favorite patrols? Which patrols do you dislike? How could patrols be improved?

The only types of patrols I ever do are Kill and Salvage. The others feel like a waste of time - too much time investment for too little payback.

• PVE weapon balance - what feels too strong in PVE? What feels too weak? Please explain your reasons.

It currently feels like using anything other than specific weapons is far too underpowered. For example, things feel fine when I play on my account with Izinagi’s Burden, Wendigo, etc. But, when I play on my son’s account to help him with certain things, it is way too much of a struggle. With the proper weapons, you can melt a Strike boss in 5 seconds. Without them, it could take 5 minutes.

• Gun mods and seasonal artifact mods - What are your thoughts on current gun mods and seasonal artifact mods in the PVE? Whats too strong or too weak? Please explain your reasons.

There is no current reason to use anything other than Bows or Rifles because of the Champion system. 

• What are your thoughts on other current PVE activity modifiers (elemental burns, blackout, etc...)? Should certain modifiers be added to or removed from PVE activities? Do you have any ideas for new PVE modifiers that would be fun?

Blackout is more annoying than anything else. The other modifiers are fine as they add variety.

• ""Junk"" and auto-dismantle - Do we get too much ""junk"" from playing PVE? Should there be an auto-dismatle option for certain types of loot (ex: blues below your power level)?

YES PLEASE

• Cosmetics & Eververse - What are your thoughts on cosmetic rewards from PVE activities including eververse engrams & bright dust? What changes would you like to see and why?

I just want more options to spend bright dust on. I missed the one week the Empyrean Cartographers helm was sold, so I’m missing that one piece. Same with Quiao’s arms. It feels silly to only be able to get one piece from one set per week. Give us options.

• Experience from gameplay Does playing PVE game modes (outside of bounties) enable you to level up your season pass at a reasonable rate or does the amount of experience from certain PVE mdoes need to be changed?

Nope, not at all. 

• Would you like to have the option to cross-platform play in PVE? Why or why not?

ABSOLUTELY. If I could have one thing from all of these questions, it would be this. Cross platform is essential and I highly believe it would expand your player base. I personally know several people that don't play Destiny 2 because they have different systems, but would if we could play together."
