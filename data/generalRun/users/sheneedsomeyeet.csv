AquaSwap,ffh0e8t,t1_fffs62s,1579919751.0,I need one for my 50! I've been thinking about this for a week now. What are the chances! Let me know when you have some ready!
Aquariums,fezqdyz,t1_fezp4iy,1579460334.0,My phos is steady at .5 ppm. I don't think phos is the cause.
Aquariums,fezjett,t1_fezi1kj,1579457978.0,"I ordered some Ada phyton-git, was mostly just seeing if anyone had any other tried and true or an idea of what caused it. I'm thinking the high nitrates but unsure."
Aquariums,fezczof,t1_fezbq8f,1579456043.0,"Mine doesn't seem to be touching it. But I also feed him algae pellets mostly, unsure if this is a case of him being well fed and preferring the pellets or not. I didn't think Gourami ate BGA ??"
Aquariums,fezcawo,t3_eqzbwm,1579455894.0,"Additional info that may help: I added Fluval Cycle after the second water change before leaving as I did some extensive gravel vacuuming and some cleaning of the plants.

I usually dose about 19 drops (1pump) of UNS plant food once a week after water change.

 I use distilled water remineralized with equilibrium.

 This is a 10 gallon, heavily planted tank stocked with 1 dwarf Gourami and 2 nerite snails.

Typical weekly maintenance includes a gentle gravel vac and 20% water change.

Once a month I do an extensive vacuum or cleaning of the filter (the media only gets squeezed out in dirty aquarium water about once a month, but I clean the tubing with a pipe cleaner).

This tank has been up and running for 4 months now. I've only switched out the filter media once and let it colonize with the old media."

dogs,fdw1dov,t3_en21kr,1578754074.0,"Look how sad he is! That's so terrible. Thank you for caring for him. The pic looks to me like an allergy or fungal skin issue, but could also be other things. Skin scrape at the vet will tell you. A keto shampoo may help in the interim. Poor baby. Please keep us updated."

My dog is a little maltipoo and he has this weird obsession with rubbing his butt (above the tail) on people to get them to pet him."

personalfinance,fcxfj7l,t1_fcvvh1i,1578061601.0,"County tax valuation is not an accurate means of determining market price. CMAs are a free service from any agent worth their salt.if you speak to a realtor you can likely work something out. I've done many sales where I solely help with listing price and paperwork for reduced commission or a flat fee. Some agents won't go for this, but if you have a referral from another agent or from a friend, agents will be more likely to work with your situation. I mentioned in another comment I'd be willing to help out, just send me a message.

Best sale time will depend entirely on your local market."

 Tasteful is the aim when showing your home."
personalfinance,fcxeqya,t1_fcvyg8n,1578060998.0,"Hey, I'm in real estate and we handle situations like this very often. Let me know what area you're in and I can do some research on some agents  and brokerages for you and give recommendations for your sale. I'm not interested in a referral fee or anything like that. It's a tough situation to be in and I am happy to share my experience to help you out."
personalfinance,fcl7f3k,t1_fcl4f2n,1577741430.0,"Closing can have a negative impact on credit score. I think the wiser choice might be going for a credit card with a good interest rate with an introductory 0% for X number of months. Ideally one that she could keep open to help with credit age and credit mix. Also, one with a limit high enough to not effect her utilization ratio. Personally, I stay away from the specialty credit lines unless it's a loan for a car or school (or mortgage) or for health/veterinary uses. If she isn't going to get much use out of it except for this one purchase and maybe a purchase years from now, I'd say go with a different credit line."
