politics,ff3kkrk,t1_ff325fq,1579543026.0,"I am reminded of a story I read (that probably isn't true) about Sun Tzu.  Sun Tzu was in a kings court that was looking to higher him to train his armies.  Sun Tzu claimed he could train anyone to be a soldier and the king wanted to put this to the test.  The king challenged Sun Tzu to get his concubines to march in formation and perform maneuvers.  Sun Tzu accepted on the condition that he would be free to use whatever methods he deemed necessary.  The king agreed.  The women were given weapons, organized into squads, and given some rudimentary training.  In charge of the whole ""army"" was the king's favorite concubine. After training they were gathered before the king to demonstrate.  They failed to march in formation and played around.  None of them took it seriously.  After the demonstration, Sun Tzu executed the king's favorite concubine that had been in charge in front of everyone.  He then promoted the king's second favorite concubine.  They ran through the marching and maneuvers again.  The second demonstration was nearly flawless.
