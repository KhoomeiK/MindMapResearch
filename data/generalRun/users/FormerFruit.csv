AskReddit,ffthzon,t3_ev2sdo,1580221056.0,"Have some self control and discipline. I'm still trying to lose weight and when it boils down to it, it's all about your mental control, at least in my experience. I am not saying starve yourself, but some hunger is not going to do you that much damage. If you're feeling like you want to eat something in the middle of the day, don't reach for chocolate. Be tough with yourself. Drink a glass of water. Water curbs appetite. Dehydration can be mistaken for hunger. 

The idea is to lose more calories than what you eat. This is where your self control comes back in. Instead of eating something high in calories and thinking you'll go and jog it off, just don't eat it altogether. Much easier. Eat more fruit and vegetables and drink water."
