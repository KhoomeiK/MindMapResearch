The thing about keeping your tattoos professional is that people without tattoos generally think its safe to bitch about them to me, I love the look on their face when I casually slide up a shirt sleeve and they see mine.

Just like this election. Bernie is popular with white people (mostly young) while Biden has broad support including people of color. Because the primaries have changed it gives an even greater voice to the type of voter who supports Bernie. Now they're so overrepresented he may win the primary but he'll lose the general and trump will actually be right about winning the popular vote. Bigly.
