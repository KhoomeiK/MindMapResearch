misanthropy,fff0hj3,t1_ffe5t9u,1579872257.0,"I actually haven’t revealed my philosophy at all. I was just interested in your comment, because you said we have some kind of responsibility to pursue some sort of endeavor that appeals to you. Comments like that usually do pique my interest, because I then wonder how they arrived at it. I mean, there are things I feel are true for me...but I don’t know that I’ve ever projected that on others. I personally choose to do nice things for others when I can, just because I know that doing so often inspires reciprocal behavior. Mostly, though, I feel that doing nothing is often the best route. 

In my opinion, there is no waste of time. We simply go from birth to death, and in between we do things we enjoy, find ways to amuse ourselves on the journey, and ordinarily do what we can to mitigate the amount of misery we know is coming and mostly can’t avoid.

Again, I just found it interesting that you said we have a “responsibility”...and I wanted to explore your thinking about it. I will admit that I do think the human race is “doomed”, although I wouldn’t use that word. That has more of a judgmental feel to it. I just think we are mostly stupid and destructive, and if we want to make any kind of change, it will mostly only be changes that will affect ourselves and maybe some people who are closest to us. That’s about the extent of our influence.

And I also think that burying our heads in the sand and pretending that we can change the world is lying to ourselves...but I also know that’s how some people mitigate the pain they know life brings; it makes the journey more bearable, so more power to them. I don’t have any gripes about how people fool themselves...I only take exception when they then feel like I need to do what they’re doing. “I have what you need”...I don’t respond well to that."
misanthropy,ffezkza,t1_ffedqnp,1579871443.0,"Yes, you are right...I thought you were the OP, my apologies. Your tip wasn’t really all too necessary...it’s advice I already take, but, hell, we all make mistakes. Thanks for the response anyway."

Sean Penn played the role of the father whose daughter was murdered. He won an Academy Award for his portrayal. This page is the thoughts of the detective investigating the case, Sean Devine...played by Kevin Bacon. The next page even sounds closer to a nihilistic approach to the world...and he even sounds like a misanthropist from the next page. Great novel."

misanthropy,ffdxcgv,t1_ffdq3t9,1579831263.0,"Oh, I’ve watched it twice. Some of the best acting I’ve ever watched. I had no idea Jim Carrell could act that good. And Timothee Chalamet is one of the most talented young actors I’ve seen in a long time. Reminds me so much of a young DiCaprio and River Phoenix. Very old-soul acting. It’ll be interesting to see where his career goes. 

The story is heartbreaking, I agree. I wish that opiates were legal and free to use as often as we wanted. Wow, that would make life endurable. Just as long as we would never run out. If I had the means, I’d buy a shit-ton of heroin and sail on out of here. I’m not suicidal or depressed, but I’m going to stop existing at some point, and it doesn’t matter to me if I get off the bus right here...or 40 years down the road.

We pick what philosophies that resonate the most with us or that appeals to us. But I outright reject the notion that I have some responsibility to make myself happy. If I want to live a miserable existence, that’s as valid as another person who wants to be an optimist. 

None of it matters anyway. In 120 years (and mostly far sooner), all of us will be just as equally dead."
misanthropy,ffdwofc,t1_ffds7og,1579830787.0,"You said, “Humans are asshole, so they like assholes in fiction.” That just doesn’t necessarily follow, so I disagree. I think that humans are generally stupid (if you like the word ‘asshole’...that works), but I don’t think that people like assholes in fiction *because* they’re assholes...or even *because* they are stupid. 

I think many people like certain fictional characters, because those characters are often the *most interesting* and are part of *stories* that are interesting. Many of the characters in films that I love most are *not* the assholes of the story. They are often the ones who are trying to avoid the assholes...or work against the assholes. But sometimes the asshole character is just the most interesting character. 

In truth, I don’t remember many times where someone told me that they liked a character in a film that was the most reprehensible character. They often talk about how much they “hate that guy”. I mostly see people rooting for the nicer characters, the ones who survive the misery served up by the asshole.

Where the hell did you read this?? I have no such responsibility at all...and neither does anyone else. If I choose to do so...that’s my choice, but I have zero responsibility to make myself happy. I have only 1 or 2 things I absolutely must do: live and die.

If it were easy, I would do it in an instant. I have a lot of things in my life that I enjoy doing, but none of them is enough that would keep me here if I could find a very easy and simple means to shuffle off this mortal coil."
misanthropy,ffdouto,t3_esidr6,1579825471.0,"I’m not sure, but I can relate to the sleeping part. I am overjoyed every night when I start to get sleepy and head to bed, because I will effectively not exist (from my own perspective) for some amount of time...and each morning when I start to wake up, I start having dread, knowing that the daily grind is starting up again. About a minute or two after getting out of bed, it fully settles into you just how heavy life is.

misanthropy,ffdojyr,t1_ffc6f3b,1579825281.0,"There’s a huge difference between being born sadistic and being born with the potential for sadist behavior. We all obviously have sadistic potential; just turn off all the power in a city and we’ll start proverbially (if not literally) eating each other in less than 12 hours. 

Most people can be pushed to sadistic behavior, given the right elements or factors. That doesn’t mean that every person IS sadistic. I could be pushed to murdering someone with little or no regret, given the right circumstances; that’s doesn’t mean I’m a born murderer. Faulty logic."

It’s simply not true, though, that all people who find such characters interesting are interested in those characters because they are just like that themselves. That’s a sweeping generalization...a fallacious perspective. If I want to know if someone is a certain way or thinks a certain way...I ask them. Or look for evidence of that characteristic."
misanthropy,ffdnl1y,t3_esux4s,1579824692.0,"I don’t agree with this assessment, although I might admit that it is true for some people. I find fictional characters who are assholes appealing, because those kinds of characters are often the most interesting. I don’t read a fucking novel to read about a goody-two-shoes philanthropist ass-button who shoots out of bed each morning with utter delight, immediately looking for the next old lady to help across the street or homeless dog to feed. 

I look for complex characters who are interesting and who bring a complexity to an interesting story that’s going to hold my attention. If I want the former type, I can go find a Young Adult fiction novel from the children’s section of the local library. Like The Hardy Boys or Nancy Drew or something similar."
nihilism,ffdn11d,t3_et1y3o,1579824357.0,"I didn’t know I couldn’t add writing or text to the shared photo, so here is what I wanted to say. I don’t go looking for these novels, but not hard to find in the genres listed. I didn’t post this to be all negative or depressing or to whine and moan about life is hard, blah, blah, blah...but instead, this page jumped out at me, because it so adequately sums up how my mind often thinks about the world around me.

Sometimes if I don’t get out of myself, I sound just like this in my head, and I see the ridiculous repetitive nature of daily life that I just want it to end, because what’s the point? It’s easy to go down this path and wind up suicidal...and I’ve been there. The answer for me has always been to make my own fun, to make my own purpose, to find things to amuse myself, to find another good book, great film, a new album to discover...something to make the drone of daily life appealing in some way. 

What novels have you read that have such characters, or just have characters who display other more common nihilist features?"
misanthropy,ffd7owz,t1_ffb0b0x,1579815027.0,"The topic isn’t about Christianity or any other religion, for that matter. Jesus appears in other religions, and he also appears in literature that is not Christian. Yes, you are free to branch off into your own unrelated conversation about why you dislike religion...but that’s not the topic of this discussion, and I don’t care in the least what the poster’s personal beliefs are.

Maybe you should start your own discussion over this topic?"
nihilism,ffau65r,t1_ff92fwe,1579744569.0,Exactly. You won’t know you’re dead anyway. No more experiences of any kind. Can’t wait.
misanthropy,ffati64,t1_ffamiz0,1579744127.0,"Of course, not. That’s not even what irony means. 

I detest religion as an institution, but I also know that there is a very rich history there to be explored and that can’t be ignored. There was never any savior born beneath the North Star with wise men and all of that nonsense...but there is an ancient historical text written by Bronze Age goat herders that tells the story of one. That’s literature, as much as I hate that it has been (and is still being) used to torment and destroy millions of people. 

Wisdom teaches us to separate issues, so that we can glean knowledge from all sorts of unlikely, even ugly, places. I can’t erase history any more than you can. The Nazis and Ghengis Khan and Pol Pot and the gulags and the Killing Fields and Alexander the Great and Auschwitz...these are all horrors of human atrocity; but they’re also historical facts that can be studied. Just like the myths of Mithras, Zeus, Osiris, Buddha, Jesus, Thor, and David Koresh. 

The point he made has absolutely zero to do with whether Jesus actually rose from the dead...or was just another myth in an old book. For the point, it doesn’t matter."
misanthropy,ffambgl,t1_ffalnu6,1579739298.0,"No offense, but does it matter whether you think there is a need for a religious example? If it were me, I’d tell you to mind your own business regarding my particular beliefs about spookies, ghosties, pixies, and deities. The point of the analogy works whether the person is an atheist or a catholic priest. Why do they need to clarify what they believe to you? It has no bearing on the point at all."
misanthropy,ffal8n6,t1_ffa88cm,1579738554.0,I think you missed the entire point of what the person said. The answer to your question wouldn’t make a single difference for that point...probably why the person hasn’t responded.
misanthropy,ffakq6u,t1_ff8jv47,1579738178.0,"Yes, I agree with your edited remarks. I was recently at a meeting I had to attend, and a guy I know sat near me, and he completely ignored the fact that I was at the moment typing a message on my phone, I was writing a comment on this subreddit, actually. He asked a quick question, inquiring into how I was...and I politely responded with a few words, a very quick glance, and then right back to the message. He did not take the hint, neither from the look nor from my thumbs which were typing as fast as I could make them go. 

He launched into whatever nonsense he thought I needed to hear, and as I recall, it was some anecdote that was as unremarkable as most are, and twice as long. If I were a different sort of person, I would have said something. But, alas, I am not that person, and I just kept my face pointed at my phone, giving a little verbal “mmhh-hmm” every few sentences. But I never looked at him again. He still kept at it. 

After awhile I couldn’t follow the story even accidentally, because was totally preoccupied with probably exactly what you described: he was so wrapped up in his desire to vomit his story all over me that he couldn’t or wouldn’t read the cues that should have told him that I wasn’t the least bit interested. 

Having said all of this, I know that this characteristic I have is not the majority...being disinterested in making small talk is not the norm, I guess. I know that, which is why I try to just tolerate it from others, and I try to not be rude, and instead I try to just wait until it’s over. One thing I try to make clear when writing about this is that I do not entertain notions that I think that I’m more interesting or better than anyone else. I just don’t want to make small talk. I’m not rude or stuck up or snooty or self absorbed...I’m not silently judging everyone (well...let’s be honest: sometimes I am ha!)...I mostly just want to be left alone. I don’t even expect people to know this. I mostly just want them to pick up on the cues I give, and then honor it by shutting the hell up."

I do experience a sort of “stand out” thing with the way I am...there are certain family members who like to point out to you in front of others that you are too quiet...or are a “hermit”. I hate that shit. Because then you sort of get that label, and people start treating you like you’re defective or broken, as if the default setting should be a blathering fool thinking everything in their day is an anecdote to be shared with just whoever happens to be standing nearby. 

You see posts on Facebook like that. The Facebook version of the social blather-head. They have to share about every encounter in public they had with others, what the coffee was like, a picture of their sandwich, talk about all the yoga and classes and hikes and drives to the beach are scheduled today. I never understand this. I always get the urge to comment, “I think what we need around here is a little more Shut The Hell Up” :P"

I don’t think many of us would enjoy living even a few days in 1935 when you had no air conditioning, probably no television, maybe a radio and a record player. It looks cool in films, but ask the people who lived then. They’ll tell you how difficult almost everything was. And the people were worse in so many ways. If you objected to some of the ways people were awful in those days...they just killed you."
misanthropy,ff4lcln,t1_felcrcd,1579566404.0,I think you should put your post in its own conversation or post...it should be viewed by more readers here. It’s just a very succinct and reasonable message.
misanthropy,ff4ks2b,t3_eqv4wm,1579566006.0,"Fictional characters are written by real people, so they mostly resemble and behave just like real people, so I would say that I like them about as much as real people: mostly not at all. I do get amusement from watching fictional people, because they behave in ways that fit within the context of a story, and most of us like stories. Films are very satisfying, because I can watch stories I like, relate to people I find interesting, and turn them off when I’m sick of them. Films also allow me a way to feel certain emotions...the art form is very effective in a cathartic way, because they make me feel a certain way, depending on the film and, again, I can choose when and what to watch."
misanthropy,ff4kbcx,t1_ff2pl8c,1579565682.0,"Yes. That’s exactly right. If the Nazis had wiped out all races but the “aryan” race, they would merely have eventually found another way to discriminate amongst themselves...probably some kind of caste system, as you indicated. Wealth, intelligence, brute strength, physical appearance. It’s in our nature to do this. It’s not even deliberate or conscious, I think."
misanthropy,ff4k03d,t1_ff3vh69,1579565462.0,"For me, it’s indifference to most people, although I do not want to see anyone suffering, and I have compassion when I see people hurting. But I don’t want to mix with them, get to know them, hang with them. If I have the means, I will help someone to ease suffering, but I’d prefer to do it from afar or even anonymously. 

I don’t have animosity towards most people, I guess is how it is. I just want them to stay the hell away from me."
misanthropy,ff4jrv4,t1_ff3o7zf,1579565308.0,"Apathy or indifference maybe? Those seem to be interchangeable. And for me, it’s as you say. I love individual people, even though I don’t want to be around them. Trying to square that in my head is difficult. I guess it’s love. It’s hard to define. 

I’ve always struggled with making connections with anybody. Even close family members, even though I feel affection towards them, I don’t want to hang around them or listen to them talk about things. They bore me pretty quickly, as do most people. 

I’ve taken interest in watching people...sometimes they are pretty amusing to watch, like the way you can watch monkeys in a zoo. And this is not to say that I’m better or more interesting than others. Much to the contrary. 

I know how fucking mediocre I am. Blending in has always been my goal."
medizzy,ff1su9b,t1_ff1sgs0,1579485409.0,"Haha, right?? What sparked me to reply was the mention of being “embarrassed” by choking, and I had never really focused on that aspect of what happened to me, because I still felt sort of stupid that I was too embarrassed to tell anyone I was actually choking. Isn’t it weird that we are that self-conscious? The same thing is why once I vomited all over my desk in 3rd grade instead of going to the bathroom...because I was too embarrassed to tell anyone that I was feeling *that* sick. You just have this feeling that you do not do not do not do not want that kind of attention :P It’s the worst! I am terrified of having a bunch of attention in a crowd. Even to this day...I just want to *blend*."
medizzy,ff1kkgh,t1_fev70vv,1579480682.0,"This almost-exact same thing happened to me in the 4th grade. We were having a classroom party, and I was sucking on a piece of hard candy of some kind...I must’ve taken a breath or something, because it suddenly was lodged in my throat, and I couldn’t swallow or bring it back up. I was panicking AND was terribly, terribly embarrassed....I did not ask for help, I walked to the corner of the room, bent over, feeling faint at this point, and shoved my fist into my stomach. I have no idea why I did that or if that’s what did it, I do not remember ever learning that, but it flew out of my mouth and bounced across the floor, and nobody ever found out. It was probably one of the scariest moments of my life, if not the scariest. Those few seconds when you literally know that you are probably going to die...but still are too afraid to ask for help...everything stands out in vivid color. I can still picture where every person was in that classroom at that moment, but I have no memory of the rest of that day at all, the hours before or after that one incident."
misanthropy,ff1f1nl,t1_ff079r5,1579478359.0,"I don’t think people can choose to like or dislike anything. You either don’t or you do...and you discover that you like or dislike something. Perhaps a person can condition themselves to respond a certain way to something over a period of time, but that would be a different topic, I think. 

My experience has led me to my feelings towards humanity. I certainly did not always feel this way...and some might say that one has become jaded, because life hasn’t turned out a particular way for the person, but that certainly isn’t necessarily the truth, even if it is true for some. 

I’ve disliked people in general for a long time, it’s just that for years, I never knew there was a word for it."
misanthropy,ff1e1im,t3_er138t,1579477993.0,"There’s a grain of truth to it, but as with most things, it’s far more complicated and nuanced. Growing up, I wasn’t considered an attractive male, but I rarely had anyone tell me that I was ugly, either. I was somewhere in the middle, though for most of my life, I have considered myself ugly...for reasons stemming from being bullied, horrific upbringing, etc, etc blah, blah, blah. 

I noticed that the most attractive children around me did get the most benefits and privileges....even teachers treated them better, generally speaking. The most popular kids often got away with behavior that an unpopular and ostracized kid wouldn’t be able to. I think this was mostly subconscious behavior on the part of the adults. People gravitate towards physically attractive people, whether they are children or adults...and I don’t mean sexually. 

I think there is a certain curse that comes with it. My mother was extremely attractive as a teenager and was a cheerleader, extremely popular, had the most popular boyfriends in her hometown high school year, etc, etc...but this came back to bite her in the ass, because once she graduated, she was a small fish in a big pond, and her looks didn’t have the same kinds of advantages, but she expected them. Also, as she aged, she had a hard time coming to terms with aging. She was sure she looked 10-15 years younger than she actually looked, and would often comment about how some salesperson or stranger thought she looked 25 when she was nearing 50. 

Look at shows like America’s Got Talent and other shows...a mediocre singer who is smoking hot will have a much greater chance at success than an ugly singer who is phenomenally talented. Susan Boyle is a rare exception. And articles about her still talk about the “ugly duckling” syndrome, even though she’s a decade into stardom and fantastically successful. 

I have no idea where I was going with this, but I just think that the public’s general obsession with appearances and the privileges heaped on the traditionally attractive...make me dislike humanity all that much more. We are a superficial, stupid, shallow, and petty species."

misanthropy,ff0trev,t1_ff0ji7k,1579472216.0,"Yes, I know. I just thought there was a particular angle you were going for. Violence...yeah, I do agree with some who say that for some reason, we are drawn to it. The visceral nature of real life happening...the world comes to life when violence happens. Things stand out. Suddenly it’s not just passive living...shit’s happening. We all want to see that. I am drawn to violence, but mostly in films. Real life violence isn’t glamorous like they show it in films. It’s ugly, the sounds of it are sickening, punches don’t sound resonate and tough, they sound flat and meaty and they sound bloody, if that makes sense. 

I saw a fist-fight only once in my life, and that was in school, and the two boys barely got any good punches in, but there was A LOT of blood, not that Hollywood would be any indication. Also, one hit to the face left the person with severe swelling and bruising for weeks later. Again, not like many films. 

For me, shooting a gun feels violent. Every time I’ve shot one, it felt like I got punched in the shoulder or chest. There’s a violent feel to having a gun go off that doesn’t feel nice."

Check out the income of the big influencers on Instagram, the ones who only got famous for Instagram...it’s almost criminal how much money they make for having no discernible talent at all...aside from having good looks.

Because you’re the only one who *has* to live with you. I don’t. Nobody here does. Nobody in your life does. But you have to. So...my only advice, if I were forced to give it...would be to honestly try to find out if you can live with whatever you decide. If you can...then why not? 

If I knew that I could make $4,000 a month by showing my ass on Instagram...I wouldn’t hesitate for a SECOND. Because I’m greedy? Not at all. 

It’s because having enough money makes life a little less miserable. 

I’ve made decent money in my life, and I always wind up doing things to help others, so much that I’ve never heaped a lot of savings or wealth to myself. I just don’t have that kind of relationship with money. To me, money is just one of the means to mitigate misery. It makes life just a little bit easier. I’ve never been one to horde money or belongings. (Well, except books)"

I’m not saying you are doing this, but I’ve read “articles” or blogs from people who claim that it’s all habit and that you can train your brain out of stuttering, which is supported by nothing from the thousands of experts in the field of speech pathology, medicine, and science. I don’t pretend that they have all of the answers, either; but I know that it’s probably not wise to take all of our truth from a blog from one or two people who have an experience, especially when the stuttering phenomenon is so different for so many people. 

The danger of ideas like the “training out of it” thing is that it then places the blame of stuttering on the shoulders of the person who stutters. You’ll start to hear things like, “Well, you don’t want to be cured enough” or “You’re not trying hard enough” and other terribly unfair and wrong things. 

Stuttering is far too varied to draw any conclusion that will apply to all stutterers. There are just too many variables involved."

Last night I had to go to a meeting, and I always sit somewhere that I feel is less conducive for someone to try to start small talk, but there’s always someone who does it anyway.

That’s why I feel bad about complaining, because in my mind, I was “egging him on”, giving him a false sense of positive response. When in reality, I was growing in resentment that he wasn’t getting it. It’s just not in my nature to disrupt things. I’m sure that comes with how I was conditioned to be passive in a very aggressive environment as a child; they didn’t need more problems. Not only was the household entirely fucked up, but now there’s behavior problems with the kid? No. You learn to just take it and roll over and be passive. It’s easier. 

But that builds resentment, and I’ve yet to be able to break out of that. It’s still easier to just take it and then come to a place like this and rant about it. There is catharsis in processing this way...and definitely in someone showing that they understand, like you did...so thank you again."

Pills are one of the most unreliable means of ending your life. It can be done, but you’d need something far, far more toxic than OTC sleeping pills. There are cases of people swallowing entire bottles of Ambien, a controlled level of sleeping medicine, and even they mostly survive. Killing yourself just isn’t as easy as you think, unless you are 100% committed to it.

But a self-absorbed narcissist would see things that way. The lack of self awareness makes it impossible for you to see things from anyone’s perspective but your own. I’m quite sure some around you can clearly see your mannerisms and character flaws, but you’ll would never admit to any of them, despite it almost being a statistical fact that you do have many, just like we all do.

I have no further ambitions beyond that. 

I have a hard time making a fuss unless it’s something that’s seriously an egregious affront to someone else. If it’s a matter like this...I’ve always just bit the bullet and suffered while the person never learns. And I’m at fault for not proving those teachable moments when they are presented. It’s one of thing things that’s a carry-over from the trauma from childhood. I’m just very meek when it comes to standing up for myself. The entire struggle happens inside. 

So I sat there, continued to type while this annoying person kept walking about the room, talking, talking, talking, and I would give him very brief sideways glances with a little half-hearted, “Uh huh”...hoping he’d eventually see that I clearly wasn’t interested. Nope. No self-awareness, no gauging the interest in the listener, and stories that truly had no point or any high points to underscore exactly why I was being subjected to this chit-chat. 

I eventually packed up my bag, turned off the computer, slung my bags over my shoulder, and headed for the exist, and he continued to yammer on and on until I got to the front door of the building and I said, “Well, you have a good evening,” and then he returned the greeting and was on his way. 

I will accept that my reaction was probably just my problem, and maybe we all have to endure such things in we’re not willing to be a bit more assertive. I suppose I mostly just wish I understood the desire to do what he did. I would literally never corner anyone like that and start sharing little anecdotes, especially without checking in now and again to see if the listener was either interested or even paying attention.

We never wanted that kind of attention, plus I recall that we talked about how embarrassing it was to be stared down when there was nothing we could do, being someplace with a screaming baby. If my son was sick and we had to go to the ER...one of us would always walk down the corridor while he cried, just so we wouldn’t be a bother to the other sick people...a hallway that was mostly empty...or just outside, if it wasn’t cold. 

I was terrified of the idea of being a bother in public. Even now, I do as much as I can to blend and never stand out in any way in public. I hate attention. This is also why I loathe (and am confused by) people who talk loudly on their phones in public places. Don’t they realize people can hear every word they’re saying? Why doesn’t that bother people?

At least regarding their own particular pet peeves. We all have blind spots. 

For example, I doubt anyone has ever criticized me for being a boring, intrusive, over-bearing loudmouth in public. I know how awful those types are, and I purposely keep my mouth shut in public, especially places where we are forced to wait together...like the DMV or at a doctor’s office. 

You will never catch me blabbing on my phone in the presence of strangers, or bothering the guy next to me who is reading a book with what I think of the weather, and I won’t make a loud comment about what is showing on the news in the waiting room communal television, with the intent of drawing anyone into a discussion about whatever bullshit is rolling around in my head regarding whatever news story is playing. 

I have enough self-awareness to know that few people care what I think, and most people certainly don’t want to hear about it. If you ever watch this happen, take a look around at the people who look away uncomfortably, because they know how goofy that shit is when it happens.

I digress, but I also have noticed that the males who do this are wearing a baseball cap, have their arms folded over a huge gut, or have a beard. Possibly all three.

The beavers still didn’t just survive off the natural system...they used their teeth and building skills to alter the river, creating an artificial dam and barrier for protection. 

Couldn’t this be the way humans also did it, just on a larger, more sophisticated scale?"
misanthropy,feaesty,t1_fe9hc0q,1578947824.0,"Thank you for the detailed analysis you gave. I just question the use of the words “natural order”. Isn’t anything we do, as humans, considered “natural” since we cannot operate outside of nature? What would be outside of nature? Do you see my point? 

The planet did not come with a handbook...so whatever ancient man did to survive would be considered the “natural order”, wouldn’t it? Maybe the harnessing of agriculture like they did was just the next natural step, once their brains and thinking evolved to the point where they realized they could actually do it. 

I understand what you wrote...and I think that it’s a reasonable description of the consequences. I guess that’s why I say that it’s probably in our very nature to destroy ourselves. That seems to be the natural order. Industrialized agriculture seems to be inevitable, because humans are inherently greedy and hungry for power and control."

misanthropy,fe8m760,t1_fe8l58q,1578927820.0,"I also wear clothing, watch television, drive my car, use my phone...and do other things that amuse me on a daily basis. Was this suppose to demonstrate some kind of irony? I’ve already conceded that humans have created useful things. That’s not the point of what’s being said."
