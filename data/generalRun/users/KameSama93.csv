The less cards you have to go through, the more likely you are to pull what you need for a combo. A good example is the exodia deck. Ideally, it would have 5 cards, the exodia pieces, but you cannot do that, so you fill your deck with cards that will let you burn through your deck to find exodia. So if you play pot of greed, you effectively got rid of 3 cards."
