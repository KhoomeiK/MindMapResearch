You said it yourself, it still looks good and what is 40 squids for a laugh man?"
insaneparents,ffes4v4,t3_et0dgw,1579862886.0,"Obviously we know how dangerous Meningitis is. If a parent can make the choice for a 7th grader (I'm British but I believe that is equivalent to Year 8 so the kid is 12ish) to not have a jab as vital as that, (Maybe Gillick competency should be practiced) then provided the child consequently contracts and dies due to Meningitis, should we be charging voluntary manslaughter?"
enfj,ff7eetj,t3_es12l7,1579647635.0,"True in my experience. 
Emotionally and physically abusive and neglectful parents.

Specifially the Fe though because until I was 17 I would bottle my own emotions but was always good with other peoples."

But yeah nah lefty"
Drugs,fco95wa,t1_fco8kpa,1577826585.0,"Calm down sweetie. 

I do know what I'm saying.

These are facts.

The vast majority of voters are manipulated.

You can't spell especially."
enfj,fco1406,t1_fco064g,1577822192.0,"Yeah. That's why I said about the context.

Not everything is going to work out and you were honest and didn't use him or anything. 
If you do feel bad, you shouldn't. 
Giving people closure is good thing to do; you know how it can be getting caught up in your head.

I try to stick to three things. 

Be open minded

Be inquisitive

Be kind

Hope you find a job or you have one now.
Either way, I wish you luck."
Drugs,fcnyjvt,t1_fcnwblr,1577820928.0,"Yes. Issue there is bureaucracy. As I understand it superdelegates (bought and paid for) voted Bernie out of contention and handed the nomination to Hillary.

Enter a nice smear campaign from the Trump side ( Crooked Hillary ) and the potential of interference and perversion of your rights ( fiddling the vote ).

Boom Trumps ya man.

System is setup so the system wins I'm afraid.
Maybe time to use the 2nd Amendment for something other than killing eachother?"
enfj,fcnxh2s,t3_ei6s2n,1577820361.0,"Your ex broke up with you because you were having difficulty getting a job?
So a real partner would actually support you in finding a job.

The other situation, like this person was interested but they live with their parents or something?
I totally get that if you didn't really have a connection ( just tell them that ) but if you're basing it on what they have to offer in terms of material, that isn't a bad thing ( most people are like that ) but it doesn't seem ENFJ. 

Context is key."
Drugs,fcnkopf,t3_ehzld5,1577813412.0,"Tbf. I wouldn't trust an American to make decisions for itself.

Trump 2020 guys yeeeehhaaaaa"
