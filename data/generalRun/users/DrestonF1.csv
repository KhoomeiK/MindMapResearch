Athleanx,fe9pckb,t1_fdpbsx9,1578940295.0,"Ok whoa let me chime in here and try to offer some perspective.  

It absolutely boggles my mind that people think there is only one answer to personal fitness.  I'm not sure if salad is having  a bad day or what or just inexperienced.  It doesn't matter and I don't care when he comes back with all his stats and PRs.  All that means absolutely zero to me.  The secret to fitness is that there is no secret.  EVERYBODY IS DIFFERENT.  Such is the human body.  

We have no idea where you are, raphael, in your fitness journey.  What is your athletic background, your experience, your current state, your goals?  It is obtuse for anyone to think that you must do A, B then C and do not deviate from this plan because that's what worked for them.  Any trainer worth their salt will identify YOUR needs and YOUR goals within YOUR abilities, desires and dedication.  This is what you must do for yourself.

This is true not only in fitness but in all aspects of life.  Anybody who is dead set on stating that their way is the ONLY way, frankly isn't worth listening to.  Could you imagine Lebron, Kobe, Arnold, Bruce Lee, Muhammad Ali, Bill Gates, Gandhi any of these guys saying MY WAY IS THE ONLY WAY.  Of course not.  They learn from others, continuously adapt and strive for better every day.  

So can MaxShred build size on YOU?  Hell if I know because we don't know anything about you.  It most certainly could.  Is your idea of ""size"" the same as mine or salad's or the next guy in the gym?  Of course not.  If you would compare the size-gaining ability of MaxShred vs MaxSize then obviously you want MaxSize as the program is geared towards those goals.  Makes sense.  But will quite literally any other program on the planet help you get in shape?  If your current activity state is zero, then yes.  Hell, Zumba classes would tone you up.  Doesn't mean it will interest you and keep you engaged for the rest of your life.  

Find what works for you that you'll enjoy.  If you don't enjoy it, you won't keep at it and you'll be in the same place for 2021's New Years Resolution.  I hope this helps a bit."

e: Ok yeah the default answer Jeff would be on the differences would be ""I've spent the last 2 years developing core4abs with the latest scientific..."" etc.  I hear that and appreciate it.  Meanwhile, what most of pay for is not only the format but the accountability.  Even if it's just accountability of sticking to the program's calendar.

We all ""love"" the movies to some degree because it gives life to the SW Universe but as far as cinematic adventures go they are handled pretty poorly.

This was in reference to a conversation taking place on how some people take 5 years to gain black belt and others 10 or longer.  The point is, it doesn't matter.  Consistency is the only thing that matters.  This applies to all sports/hobbies/general life qualities.

To just pop in and say, ""Hey I want to get in shape"" tells us nothing.  I know you've answered some of these already but think about it.  The effort and quality of your information given will directly result in the effort and quality of the responses received."
Athleanx,fe9pckb,t1_fdpbsx9,1578940295.0,"Ok whoa let me chime in here and try to offer some perspective.  

It absolutely boggles my mind that people think there is only one answer to personal fitness.  I'm not sure if salad is having  a bad day or what or just inexperienced.  It doesn't matter and I don't care when he comes back with all his stats and PRs.  All that means absolutely zero to me.  The secret to fitness is that there is no secret.  EVERYBODY IS DIFFERENT.  Such is the human body.  

We have no idea where you are, raphael, in your fitness journey.  What is your athletic background, your experience, your current state, your goals?  It is obtuse for anyone to think that you must do A, B then C and do not deviate from this plan because that's what worked for them.  Any trainer worth their salt will identify YOUR needs and YOUR goals within YOUR abilities, desires and dedication.  This is what you must do for yourself.

This is true not only in fitness but in all aspects of life.  Anybody who is dead set on stating that their way is the ONLY way, frankly isn't worth listening to.  Could you imagine Lebron, Kobe, Arnold, Bruce Lee, Muhammad Ali, Bill Gates, Gandhi any of these guys saying MY WAY IS THE ONLY WAY.  Of course not.  They learn from others, continuously adapt and strive for better every day.  

So can MaxShred build size on YOU?  Hell if I know because we don't know anything about you.  It most certainly could.  Is your idea of ""size"" the same as mine or salad's or the next guy in the gym?  Of course not.  If you would compare the size-gaining ability of MaxShred vs MaxSize then obviously you want MaxSize as the program is geared towards those goals.  Makes sense.  But will quite literally any other program on the planet help you get in shape?  If your current activity state is zero, then yes.  Hell, Zumba classes would tone you up.  Doesn't mean it will interest you and keep you engaged for the rest of your life.  

Find what works for you that you'll enjoy.  If you don't enjoy it, you won't keep at it and you'll be in the same place for 2021's New Years Resolution.  I hope this helps a bit."

e: Ok yeah the default answer Jeff would be on the differences would be ""I've spent the last 2 years developing core4abs with the latest scientific..."" etc.  I hear that and appreciate it.  Meanwhile, what most of pay for is not only the format but the accountability.  Even if it's just accountability of sticking to the program's calendar.  I just reviewed the Xtinction program and I'll do that starting today.  core4abs will always be there later, but we also have the 6 pack shuffle addon to consider, which I believe we all have."

The Telluride is amazing, nobody cares about LeMans results when it comes to purchasing (coming from a 15 year veteran of watching every minute of 24HLM every year) and Honda/Nissan need to re-evaluate their up-brand goals - especially Nissan.

""The only difference between a white and a black belt is that the black belt never quit.""  

This was in reference to a conversation taking place on how some people take 5 years to gain black belt and others 10 or longer.  The point is, it doesn't matter.  Consistency is the only thing that matters.  This applies to all sports/hobbies/general life qualities.
