vandwellers,ffngufi,t3_euatbt,1580065792.0,"The FAQ refers to dogs, but the basic problem with pets in the van (keeping them cool) is the same whether you have a hamster or a rhinoceros:

Q: How do you keep your pet warm/cool in the van?

A: Keeping the van cool in summer is THE single most difficult thing in all of VanDwelling -- and it's required if you will be bringing a pet.

Forget all the crap you'll see on YouTube -- things like swamp coolers and ice fans do not work. The ONLY way to reliably cool the interior of a van below ambient temp is an air conditioner, and they use a lot of power. That means you'll need either shore power, or a generator, or a VERY large solar panel system (and those are very expensive).

Also, keep in mind that having a pet in the van means a big hit to your ""stealth"", since everyone everywhere will see it or hear it. It will attract a lot of attention to you and your van.

Also, people know that leaving a pet in a car is dangerous, so most states allow (Good Samaritan Law) people to break the window to ""rescue"" the pet -- and the law relieves them of liability for damages. So you may very well come back to your van to find your window broken out, your dog gone, and a notice from the police that they've impounded your pet and are taking it to the SPCA. You can also face large fines for ""animal cruelty"".

You may only be running in the grocery store for a few minutes, even with the engine idling so the dash air conditioning can run, and people could still panic and ""rescue"" your pet. Any time your pet is out of your sight, he will be in danger of being ""rescued"" by the well-intentioned public.

Keeping a pet in a vehicle is not as easy as just cracking the windows and making sure there's a bowl of water. It takes a lot of planning, a lot of sacrifice, and a lot of money."

Next, decide how many hours per day you need to run each item, and multiply this by the number of amps it uses, and add all this up for everything you want to run. That will tell you how many ""amp-hours"" of electricity you will be drawing each day from your battery bank. If you will be using lead-acid AGM batteries, then double this number--that gives you the minimum battery capacity in amp-hours that you will need in your battery bank. (If you will be using lithium batteries, then don't double this figure--lithium batteries have almost twice as much usable energy as lead-acids.) Next, you need to calculate how much solar panel capacity you will need to keep your battery bank charged. Take the total capacity in amp-hours you need for your battery bank, and double it. That is the minimum size solar panel array, in watts, that you will need to reliably charge your battery bank. To roughly estimate your cost, figure $1 for each watt of solar panel capacity (though this price is dropping and you can sometime find a better deal), $2 for each amp-hour of battery capacity (if you will be using lithium batteries, this figure jumps to $5 per amp-hour, since lithiums cost more than lead-acids), and add $300 or so for the cost of an inverter, controller, and wiring.

If it's seriously life-threateningly cold, you need a heater. Electricity is very inefficient for producing heat and requires a LOT of power, so electric heaters are generally out of the question (unless you have constant access to shore power). So most people use propane camping heaters. The Mr Buddy is good.

Keys are virtually impossible. Orlando is doable if you know what you are doing--same with Miami.

Tampa Bay is very unfriendly to homeless, and they consider vandwellers to be just more ""homeless"".

EDIT: I should perhaps point out that I am a traveler, so I am only in any particular city for three or four weeks, long enough to see all the local sites, before I move on to the next city. So that makes it a lot easier for me than it would be for someone who lived there permanently. I can be a lot more lax with my parking rotation, since I'm only there for a short time and there's less chance of me being noticed to begin with."

Yes, that is precisely what is happening.

When I first started van-traveling 4.5 years ago, I generally had the place to myself, maybe one or two other vans there. Never had difficulties.

Now, it's not at all unusual to find at least a dozen vans and/or half-broken-down RVs in the lot. In many areas the local homeless people have moved in and taken over, and since there is a high correlation between ""homeless"" and ""drug/alcohol problems"" and/or ""mental illness"", they tend to cause the sort of difficulties that Walmart and/or the city government won't tolerate--which eventually leads to everyone being kicked out and overnighting being banned."
vandwellers,ffcsuar,t1_ffcrlmi,1579806554.0,"As always, the tourist areas get most of the people. And the more people one has in any given area, the more likely some of them will be shitheads. And the more shitheads we have, the more likely that they will do stupid things which lead to trouble--which leads to more restrictions on the rest of us.

As time2van already said, it's not the way-out empty areas that cause all the difficulties.

>  You guys love to stay near huge cities it sounds like, which is not vandwelling, that’s just being too poor to have an apartment in the city you like. 

I can't speak for anyone else, but I urban camp almost exclusively because the places I want to see (museums, zoos, historical sites) are in the city. I work as an editor for a small book publishing company and could afford an apartment tomorrow in any city I like. I prefer to travel. It's a big country and I want to see all of it. 70-odd cities in 34 states over the past 4.5 years. So far. No plans to stop."
vandwellers,ffcrq6n,t1_ffcjs2q,1579805893.0,"Yep, it's a numbers thing. One or two vans overnighting in the lot won't attract any attention at all--nobody will likely even notice them.

At the Ft Myers Walmart, I was there when the ""incident"" happened: some dipshit pulled in with his van and sat outside in his jammies with a cooler of beer till the coppers showed up. I left. A couple days later security was kicking out all the vans.

At OKC, the Walmart was listed on all the sites as ""okay to park"", but they had just gotten a new manager a couple days before and she had changed the policy. So they were kicking out all the vans and allowing all the RVs to stay."
