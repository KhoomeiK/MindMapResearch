Every time I used to see my grandfather he would start telling me the horrible stories, each time he cried. I was seeing him everyday when I came from kindergarten at the age of four.

My grandmother always told me about the value of an Agora (a cent in Israeli currency), so I’ll never disrespect anything, no matter how insignificant.

My other grandma needs to know everything is alright all the time. She can’t throw old bread because who knows when you’ll need it.

My parents are survivors kids. It’s wildly known about the psychological problems of second gen children.

Basically we do not trust anyone but our family. We save money for a darker day and can’t be impartial to the German language/accent. We live a good life now, but the past echoes still."

“...When Adam the first man saw that the day was progressively diminishing, as the days become shorter from the autumnal equinox until the winter solstice, he did not yet know that this is a normal phenomenon, and therefore he said: Woe is me; perhaps because I sinned the world is becoming dark around me and will ultimately return to the primordial state of chaos and disorder. And this is the death that was sentenced upon me from Heaven, as it is written: “And to dust shall you return” (Genesis 3:19)...“"
