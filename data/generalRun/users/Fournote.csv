* Your other kids ""don't understand?"" Please, they understand perfectly. They've been giving you advice this whole time and you never took it.

* You argue that it's immoral to throw number 6 out, but if you don't, you'll be stuck with one horrible child and you'll lose the other five forever. Which will you choose?

I wanted so much to believe that there was magic and mysterious mystical things in the world.

My parents then broke the news to me about Santa. It was devastating. At first I thought they were attacking my beliefs because they were too grown up to ""see"" all the magic in the world that kids see, like in the movies I watched.

AskReddit,fdktvq5,t3_elwq84,1578511056.0,Detective Pikachu. I remember seeing the trailer and thinking that it was insulting. Like they could actually create a good live-action Pokemon film and they were instead going with a stupid live-action cartoon adaptation like they did with Smurfs or Scooby Doo. Damn I was wrong. It's one of my favorite movies now.

I'm typically a mild-mannered nice guy, but as soon as I feel like they're being fucked with by someone, I turn into a complete psychopath. I often hurl extremely hurtful insults that are WAY below the belt because I want them to feel that pain inside. Nobody messes with my family."

The time difference between when Scott became Santa and when he started losing his powers was around 10 years. None of the elves knew what was going on until they found ""The Mrs. Clause"" hidden on the card, so they didn't know about it either. So yeah, no other Santa in at least 1,200 years (remember how old Judy is) has lasted more than a decade."

I was in marching band and we had this band director that was known for giving out detention for the most ridiculous things. There were times when so many students had detention that they'd have to sit out in the hallway outside the detention hall. Anyway, one Friday night after performing at a football game, I was super tired and just forgot my backpack in my locker at the band hall. The following Monday, both the director and I walked into the band hall at the same time. He saw me reach into my locker and grab my backpack. He asked if I left it there all weekend. I told him I did, not thinking anything of it, and he replied with ""okay, see you in detention tomorrow."""

AskReddit,fdkqtgx,t3_elssvy,1578509230.0,"In all the G and PG-rated movies for kids, you never see the baby come out. You just see the mom scream, hear the baby cry, and it's all clean and wrapped in a blanket. So as a kid, I thought babies came out that way, all clean and already in a blanket, so like the blanket was inside the womb with the baby. I remember thinking how convenient it was because you didn't have to buy a blanket when the baby was first born."
