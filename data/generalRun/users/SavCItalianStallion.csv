I don't intend to be divisive, but the rest of Canada is attempting to build a pipeline at BC's expense. If something goes wrong with this pipeline--an oil spill, perhaps--British Columbians will be the ones paying the price. People will likely be forced off of their hard earned land in order for some stretches of this pipeline to be built. Furthermore, it will allow for an increase in oil production capacity, speeding up the rate of global warming. For these reasons, I maintain that the pipeline is unjust."

TopMindsOfReddit,feakcoo,t1_fe93rjn,1578949839.0,">Now, the youth of today is massively outnumbered by an increasingly older and older average population - so those boomers have never relinquished control, they’ve kept it since they were in their 20s and 30s and still possess it today, and they use their numerical advantage to rob today’s young people of their future.

To be fair, they vote at much higher rates than younger people... If every young person were to rise up and vote, things would look a lot different today."

homeschool,fdmj9cy,t3_em0hf4,1578551920.0,"On the first point, you would have to find someone to supervise them--I don't think you should leave young children unattended eight hours of the day. Unless your job is the type where you can bring your kids along to work. I've known homeschooled kids who would do homework at their parent's workplace. Mind you, the parents were not working desk jobs or the like.

On the second point, I would say that the biggest advantage is the freedom (particularly when the kids are younger). This is just my opinion, but I think putting kids in public school at a young age hinders their independent spirit. If you homeschool your kids, they will be able to spend less time on the curriculum than kids in school, giving them plenty of time to explore and learn on their own. You'll have to put in some effort to help them socialize with peers, but ultimately the tradeoff for the freedom is worth it."

Libertarian,fditd8p,t1_fdhw22k,1578450600.0,"Full disclosure, I'm not a libertarian leftie but a liberal (I'm only here because this post made the front page). The US dollar was created by a democratic government, which in my opinion gives the public the right to set taxes and such however it sees fit.

If I have an idea and choose to express it, the government shouldn't be allowed to censor me as my idea is my property, and my idea exists independently of the state. Censorship is an impingement on my freedom.

If I earn a thousand dollars, the government should be allowed to tax that money at the will of the public, since it was the public which established the currency in the first place. Taxation is not an impingement on my freedom.

This is why I can support progressive taxation yet oppose eminent domain. Currency is dependent on the existence of a state, hence the state can tax it as the public sees fit. Property is independent of the state, and it is unjust for a government--even a democratic one--to take an individual's private property, as it impede's an individual's right to pursue happiness (as the places we live ideally bring us happiness and security).

While I could be wrong, hopefully my argument is at least coherent."
