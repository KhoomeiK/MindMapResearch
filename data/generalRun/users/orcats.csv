That's a fact, all that's different is how the individual deals with it ""do I shout at the contractors or do I have an angry wank?"" 

Fun fact: people who come from nothing but become wealthy tend to become more irate when confronted with issues, it's like the fact they now have money means they're insulated from normal day shit like waiting in queues or getting a ticket. Born rich people seem to be more accustomed to  the fact that money doesnt solves everything. Interestly enough when you get in into the wealthy class (you know, those who make rich people look poor) shit goes sour - I guess they have so many valleys and servants they're not accustomed to dealing with every day shit.
