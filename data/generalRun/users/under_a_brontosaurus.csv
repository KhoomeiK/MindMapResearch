""It’s not just “sadness,” the way one feels sad at a film or a funeral. It’s more of a plummeting quality. Or the way, you know, the way that light gets in winter just before dusk, or the way she is with me.
All right, at the height of lovemaking, you know, the very height, when she’s starting to climax, and she’s really responding to you now, you know, her eyes widening in that way that’s both, you know, surprise and recognition, which not a woman alive could fake or feign if you really look intently at her, really see her. And I don’t know, this moment has this piercing sadness to it, of the loss of her in her eyes. And as her eyes, you know, widen to their widest point and as she begins to climax and arch her back, they close. You know, shut, the eyes do. And I can tell that she’s closed her eyes to shut me out. You know, I become like an intruder. And behind those closed lids, you know, her eyes are now rolled all the way around and staring intently inward into some void where l, who sent them, can’t follow."""

NintendoSwitch,ffx17qk,t1_ffwr4i8,1580315558.0,"Pick up and play ie you don't need to learn a lot to play the game and sessions are short, don't take a lot to get into.  Pretty clearly Nintendos current policy and MP games are meant to be played in hour long+ sessions that take a lot of learning.

You can argue all you want about this example or that, but that just aren't into metroid and it follows their strategy to disregard the series.  Never sold, too complicated, too hard, too time consuming.  If a new gamer can't figure a game out immediately I don't think Nintendo is interested, with the exception of jrpgs which are like grandfathered in."
NintendoSwitch,ffvi5qz,t1_ffu6kpu,1580264674.0,"Okay so besides jrpgs, which is a genre people are already comfortable with, Nintendo has released nothing but super casual games on switch.  Which metroid prime is not.

So it's not a big stretch to conclude they're not interested in an American fps single player shooter game that never sold well to begin with, which would cost a lot of money to make.

Every sign points to this conclusion.  They've released a title logo and some info about huge problems with the game so far.

Like I said, I wouldn't be surprised if it is released in the far future and bears little resemblance to the previous three MP games.

Sry if you can't bear this opinion."

NintendoSwitch,ffq0ew6,t1_ffpc5cg,1580113618.0,"Another scenario is that Nintendo doesn't believe in the metroid prime games, either to meet sales or broaden their reach.  MP isn't exactly a pickup and play type game.  Pretty much a requirement at this point for Nintendo.  They'll no doubt release them again one day, but it doesn't fit this generation."

unpopularopinion,ff7mypt,t1_ff7mgbr,1579653407.0,"All that is also correct.  I think what I took as inaccurate is that the crusaders themselves were whipped up into a frenzy about what was going on in Jerusalem which seems to be not true at the time.  Yes the Muslim world was spreading.  Yes the pope wanted to do something about it.  His popularity and power was very low at the time and he thought it would help him regain some power.

It's debatable whether or not the crusaders really gave a damn about Muslims at all.  Many seemed to be more interested in conquering cities along the way and becoming dictators of those provinces and reaping the benefits.  The lesser among them just trying to gain status and some wealth, as France at the time was backwoods compared to Eastern Europe."
unpopularopinion,ff7hp2q,t1_ff76ijz,1579649798.0,"I studied the first crusade a bit.  This is inaccurate.  They were started for the *perceived* murder and destruction of the Christian world specifically Jerusalem, when in fact the Islamic people were more tolerant of Christians in Jerusalem than Christians were tolerant of Islamic peoples.

Perception trumps fact when talkling about 1096 though.  No one in France and Italy knew what was really going on until they got there (and filled the streets of Jerusalem with blood...  Tossing babies against stone walls.)

The people that kicked it off didn't even really think it would be such a hit.  It was more like Woodstock or something.  Everyone just started arming and joining bands and started tricking into the middle East."

She was pulled over at 2AM.  The cop was enraged, she said he looked hammered. He ran up to her window and was screaming to put it down while shoving his gun in her face.  Then he ran back to his car and sped off.  It is not how you should treat a innocent citizen.  My hunch he was thinking about raping her or at least getting off on scaring her, since he was so enraged.

The racist part was easy...  the sheriff told him to not come back to his county because he was a ""n**** lover"".

When he got out of jail for 30 days, they drove him out of Meade county pulled him over AGAIN at the border to Louisville and told him that.  Granted that isn't Louisville police, but it was the next county over..
