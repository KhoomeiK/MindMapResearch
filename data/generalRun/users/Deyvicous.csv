Maybe that’s not the only reason we eat meat, but it’s got to be the biggest one.... yes vegans can survive, but there are certainly issues that a lack of meat brings.  I don’t think a vegan that gets proteins and nutrients from non meat sources is as healthy as if it was meat.

AskReddit,feymoo5,t1_feu445e,1579447658.0,"You have to realize that if ghosts exist, we assume they obey the laws of physics.... which typically means particles.  Especially if it’s interacting with normal matter.  If you can see a ghost, that would mean light is hitting it and getting scattered.  Or if it can move objects, it is interacting through particle interactions.  The way our particle physics reactions work (Feynman diagrams) would be to say this ghost particle gets hit by a photon, and then the photon and the ghost particle get scattered.  However, particle interactions can be “spun” around, as in we should be able to smash photons together and produce these particles.  Or since it interacts with matter, we can smash protons together and expect to see these particles being produced.

Let’s say the ghost particles have super high energy, so we haven’t been able to find them in our experiments.  It’s always a possibility, but we also would be able to infer things like how it would interact with normal matter, the spin of the particles, their charge, etc.  People have been looking, but nothing has been found so far, which puts a lot of doubt on the existence of “ghost” particles.  There are theories that predict a ton of particles we haven’t found, so maybe one of them could be this ghost particle.  I would assume people have looked into this before, but perhaps not.

Lastly, it’s not that science and our knowledge is complete, but we know a lot more than the average person thinks.  There have been hundreds of thousands of experiments, thousands of theorists trying to work these things out, and thousands of crack pots trying to prove ghosts using science.

Eating meat does not equal animal abuse.  Getting rid of animal abuse does not get rid of slaughterhouses.

Also, I don’t think any physicists value beauty in a theory over its accuracy.  Experiments certainly seem necessary to guide our equations.  As for philosophy though, the whole point is to go outside of the realm of experiments and still try to rigorously prove things.  It’s more like placing a constraint on a system to figure out something.  Maybe physicists don’t research time travel at all because it’s just impractical and unphysical.  Philosophers can still work everything out theoretically and use logic to draw conclusions.  It’s not the same as physics, but it’s testing compatibility with logic and philosophy.  It helps physics, but it’s philosophy of science, not science itself.  I don’t think any theoretical physicists really do that.  Any theories that aren’t testable now aren’t taken as seriously, but they can still be testable in the future."

If you eat bad normally, then how is lifting going to hurt if you use the same diet?  It’s always going to be beneficial no matter your diet.  Would a better diet help?  Sure, but it’s more about your body fat levels and overall health.  What you eat is actually insanely important for your gut microbiome, which is being shown to have an effect on your mood, wellbeing, immune system, joint issues, digestion issues, mental health problems (like anxiety, depression), behavior, and more.  Eating well is very important, but in terms of lifting?  It’s just related to your personal goals.  You will still gain muscle.  Is it the best way? Probably not, but it will happen.  You will see cardiovascular benefits regardless.  You don’t need to diet while working out, as long as you get enough protein fat and carbs.  Is it the best option? No, but better than not exercising to keep a diet."

Yes, people are circumcised.

science,fdh2i43,t1_fdgv5n8,1578413968.0,"Ironically, these are the reasons why many Americans are Republicans.  Yes education is the real issue, but hear me out.  You have Democrats constantly pushing for this “climate agenda”.  Ok, sure, seems legit.  But then we have to take into account that large corporations, farms, etc, have a different set of rules.  These industries are allowed to dump toxic waste, release a shit ton of emissions, and profit heavily in the process.  Meanwhile your average family farmer has huge restrictions on all of those things.  So it comes down to the fact that normal people are heavily discriminated by these laws, and corporations are allowed to decimate the environment.

We have politicians that enforce strict rules for citizens, but every large corporation can ignore those rules.  No wonder everyone thinks the agenda is made up.  The education issue comes into play since people aren’t aware of the effect companies have had in ruining parts of the environment.  Another large issue is the politicians.  Democrats are opposed if they try to put regulations on corporations, but they end up fucking normal people over while the real bad guys are allowed to do whatever they want.  Democrats are not the good guys we say they are.  Maybe some of them, but the environmental problems are not due to the collective pollution of citizens.  It’s the fault of corporations, and we need politicians to regulate these industries.  As long as we have both Republicans and Democrats jacking off, we will never solve the problem.  And one group just starts hating the other group, despite none of them doing anything that doesn’t benefit themselves.  All the politicians are rich and involved in the businesses.  

We need people to realize the climate is drastically being altered for the worse, and to realize none of the political parties are caring.  Yes there were more regulations during Obama that have been removed, but it’s all just a distraction from the fact the environment was still being defiled heavily by corporations...."

Physics,fde10kd,t3_ekerj7,1578328745.0,"Minimum number of empirical observations? For every branch of physics?  It’s going to need a lot of data.  The location of stars in the galaxy doesn’t tell you much about the way it’s formed, or the nuclear dynamics of the star itself, or how a gas moves on earth.  Every problem in physics needs it’s own evidence, more or less.

We would love to derive everything from first principles (or maybe rather philosophers would), but it’s way too difficult.  In math, you can obey all the rules of logic and come up with something “abstract” but maybe not “physical”.   If you do that in physics, you get everything wrong.  How many different ways do you think we could describe modern physics mathematically?  I wouldn’t say infinite, but the possibilities seem endless.  Many theories already have different interpretations, like quantum mechanics or Newtonian (forces vs curved space).  Sometimes these interpretations use the same math, and sometimes they don’t.  There can be so many different ways to formulate modern physics, but we haven’t been able to find something that describes everything together while still being accurate.  

TL;dr - we want to describe things from first principles, but any crackhead can come up with a new theory that doesn’t match observations.  There has been so much experimental data throughout history (the last 300-400 years to be specific), that I’m not sure there’s a way around the path we have taken.  Maybe if we knew about QED and QM experiments, we could rederive all Newtonian, electrodynamics, atomic, stat mech, etc, but it’s not really the same thing as first principles.

Also keep in mind, I can give you any physics equations, and it’s up to you to use it.  Newton’s laws can tell you about rockets, rotation of the earth, throwing a ball, etc.  The equations don’t say anything about these objects or scenarios.  It’s very much all empirical.  The equations can give you perfect results, but it can also give you unphysical results.  Would physics from first principles still give you unphysical results?  These are philosophical questions, but it is important for now that we are guided by data to push us towards an equation that can be derived from first principles."
