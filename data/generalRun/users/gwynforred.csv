bipolar,ff59tkt,t3_ericpf,1579584593.0,I'm the same way. My center is a mess but after years of working hard and taking my meds they're starting to recognize me. I want to leave but I don't want to lose my health insurance and I don't want to start over from the bottom again.
movies,ff2awmp,t1_ff2aqao,1579499098.0,"From my time in China a large portion of the population is still pissed about Japan's actions in World Was II, and complains about them vocally. There's another population of people (mostly younger people), who are really interested in Japanese pop culture, but that's mostly anime/manga/J-pop, and I don't know how many of them would be familiar with Japanese actors."

BravoTopChef,feu7xif,t1_fesl06j,1579383988.0,"No, Floyd Cardoz won that season. Hugh didn't make it to the finale. He got eliminated in the science fair challenge that he seemed to think was stupid. This was after him being eliminated for awful and enormous scallops the first episode then being brought back.

I miss Masters, that was a good show."
BravoTopChef,fepomk8,t3_eqa0qv,1579326221.0,I think we're all forgetting he was the first one eliminated on his season of Top Chef Masters. He got brought back after someone else had to drop out so he was in a lot of the rest of the season but he didn't even make it to the finale.
90DayFiance,felqbtd,t1_felpyy3,1579228354.0,"I don't think they've talked about it on the show but according to the sub the reason Angela is raising her grandkids is because her other daughter their mother is in jail for pedophilia.

callcentres,feivv1s,t1_feif4qw,1579148620.0,"It's not actually infested. One agent who has bed bugs accidentally brought in a bug on their clothes and someone saw so they are spraying as a prevention. I already take steps to prevent my home getting infested, but I hadn't heard of this earth so thank you for educating me. Sadly with call centers, particularly with bed bugs being as prevalent in my city as they are, bed bugs are a constant worry."
callcentres,feh3dow,t1_feg779l,1579108310.0,"That's awful; I'm glad you're not there anymore. My company really isn't usually this bad, I think there was a miscommunication with the exterminators and management. It's the sup who was there's fault for letting it happen. I want to see if there's a way I can prevent it from happening again."

asktransgender,fecxfpl,t3_eoeg2o,1578988522.0,"I know a cis comedian who jokes on stage that she has a dick. She says she likes the ""mystery"" of people not knowing if she's cis or trans. She'll do bits about girls sucking her cock, for example.

She slept with a guy comedian once then later he sent her a text ""did you used to have a dick?!?!"" She thought it was hysterical.

My trans femme friend was so confused and disappointed when she found out the truth..."
movies,fecvlbg,t1_fecv0h2,1578986362.0,"Maybe some older trans people don't want representation but all the younger trans people I know want trans representation. Not necessarily going into talking about transition, but just, here's this person who happens to be trans living their life and doing interesting stuff that doesn't necessarily have anything to do with them being trans."
movies,fecs0p7,t1_fecrfz6,1578982405.0,"This movie you're talking about may or may not be the greatest depiction itself. Most movies about trans people are by non-trans people reflecting on how ""awful"" and ""depressing"" being trans must be. Sort of how 20 years ago movies like ""Philadelphia"" were the only things out there depicting gay people, and here they are dying of AIDS and played by straight people."
movies,fecruqn,t1_fecms00,1578982231.0,"Not enough trans people are creating movies, just lots of cis people who ""think"" they know what the trans experience is like. Sort of like how ""Green Book"" is white people's take on racism."

bipolar,fdu1orx,t3_en0oej,1578725939.0,"I'm pretty sure I'm not in a manic phase right now (I get occasional hypomania but it's pretty low grade). But I just bought a fitbit and it says my heart rate is constantly really elevated. I think it's just all the anxiety. 

I may be slightly hypomanic lately. Possibly. I can't tell if I'm just enjoying stuff I'm doing more or what."
bipolar,fdtzx96,t3_en0ac8,1578725030.0,"I thought it was just years of working at a call center. I deal with pharmacists and sometimes have to tell people I'm not going to help them get their patients their meds due to policy, as much as I might want to help. I found I tend to take it personally when I'm dealing with someone's psychiatric medicine, but today a pharmacist was pissed I wasn't helping more to get someone their cancer meds (because policy restricted what I could do), and I was just kind of like ""eh I'm sure you'll figure something out."" (The person did get their meds in the end.) I get lots of pharmacists yelling at me and I've stopped caring most of the time. If it's really a dire situation there's always the option of the person going to a hospital or the pharmacy comping the meds and billing later, anyway."

bipolar,fdpvp8u,t3_emcq9h,1578642440.0,"Weird how Geodon is so low on the list. It works great for me, now that I've adjusted to it and the sedating effects have stopped. I know it doesn't work for everyone though. I have probably a misery milder case of bipolar -2 though and a bunch of other stuff on top of it so I'm kind of a weird mix so I wouldn't be surprised if what works for me is wildly different than for other people."
AndroidGaming,fdojlya,t3_emaaho,1578606467.0,"I'm currently hooked on Card Crawl. It's a paid game but it's on Play Pass. No ads or in game purchases. It's a dungeon crawl card game, games last 3 minutes, so I can play a hand or two on break from work. I like the graphics and it satisfies the part of me that really likes board games."
AndroidGaming,fdoabmy,t3_em9ap0,1578601609.0,I just downloaded the game. I'm still figuring it out but I started laughing with the part where I have to get rid of the birds sitting on the tower. Good job.
BravoTopChef,fdnl8sz,t3_elmxac,1578588146.0,Can you save us from having to watch the show and tell us what she's up to on the show? Is the show any good?
movies,fdmfbug,t3_em2sym,1578548015.0,Still haven't seen Terminator 2. 5 years ago I finally bothered to watch the first one and just never felt motivated to see the second one. So many people have gotten upset at me for it.

RPDR_UK,fcc4j9p,t1_fcc2hi7,1577594327.0,I'm not seeing where it's being insinuated that everyone who's used the word fishy is transphobic. I think the people who are getting defensive on The Vivienne's behalf are assuming that's the case but I haven't seen people on the anti-fishy side actually say that. But feel free to provide examples proving me wrong.
RPDR_UK,fcc1gsb,t1_fcbu0kc,1577593339.0,"I'm personally less concerned with the usage of any particular word and more interested in the intent behind it. I think it's a good thing to get into a dialogue about the words we use, and not come down on anyone for using different terminology than others. I understand why that word upsets many, AMD think it's fair to express that. 

I don't think the Vivienne's reaction was all that great to being called out. If someone tells you they're upset, it's worth while to listen to them. You don't necessary need to change your ways, but it's worth hearing out why a group of people who you'd like to be your fans have an issue with it. 

I think the it's a problem that we idolize celebrities so much it doesn't allow for them to be flawed individuals. We're all growing as people, everyone should be working to better themself, and no one is perfect.  The Vivienne is work in progress, just like everyone else. 

But sometimes growing as a person involves opening up yourself to take into consideration other points of view, and she's clearly not doing that here. And that's disappointing."
RPDR_UK,fcbtodj,t1_fcbsec3,1577590851.0,"No one person speaks for the entirety of trans people. Lots of trans people have a problem with it, some don't. Some people that aren't trans have a problem with fishy. It's referring to the smell of vaginas that are off on their ph balance, so many view it as an extremely negative thing to say."
verizon,fc6tapu,t3_egijle,1577488939.0,You can switch the Sim card through the website or by calling/chatting into customer service. It's supposed to automatically switch to the new sim but in your case it didn't so it needs to be manually done. Also make sure you're in an area with good cell coverage and you're not roaming.
callcentres,fc5nhgc,t1_fc55c02,1577462092.0,"Absolutely. I once worked for a client that was a skin cream company that made us work on a federal holiday because they thought we would be busy, but no one knew we were open so we just sat around watching Minions with almost an hour between each call. Then the next day we were slammed and everyone complained ""well I would have called yesterday if you were open""."
popheads,fc4ndlj,t1_fc3m0g4,1577421861.0,"Lots of times abused women go back to their abusers, for a myriad of reasons. There should be more awareness of this instead of thinking it's an indication it didn't happen."
callcentres,fc4khwk,t3_efib9t,1577419326.0,"I had to work on Christmas this year because I'm currently working for a pharmacy benefits manager and people still need their meds on Christmas. Lots of calls about people who went home for Christmas and forgot their meds at home. Completely understandable. It still sucked being there. They could have gotten by with only half as many agents as what they had.

Most people were voluntary but they needed me as a senior agent but then I didn't have access to the system I needed for senior calls so I couldn't even do what they wanted for me."
bipolar,fc3iaas,t1_fc36mae,1577390405.0,"FMLA is useful if you qualify but we don't know if OP is American, and they have to have been with their current job for a year first as well. 

For other Americans that haven't been with their job for 12 months ADA rules still apply. If they bring in documentation from their doctor they can get extra accommodations, such as extra breaks. 

I have 20 minutes extra break a day (for stomach issues), and I have a co-worker who has extra breaks for PTSD. She's also allowed to clock off for two hours a month if she has a flashback.

The risk with all of this is telling your current workplace your mental situation, but for any competently run place, it will make you harder to fire in general because they would be opening themselves up for a lawsuit. If you did end up getting fired it may be really hard to actually sue because it's hard to prove they fired you due to your disability status, but places that are run properly should be following the rules in order to protect themselves anyway."
