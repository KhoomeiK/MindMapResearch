Had a bunch of offers there a couple of years back but they were paying nowhere near what I was making in my country or would be making in the US, as in like 50% less, same job same level of course. Given the cost of living is just marginally less than NYC - or my country which is around the same level (lower rent, higher everything else) - I ended up passing and instead stayed put"
expat,ff6a8dj,t1_ff69pas,1579622751.0,"Yeah I get that, but in private industry, it weirdly counts for a lot (I don't necessarily agree that it should). There's probably few industries that pay above market - big pharma, some sectors in finance, tech, maybe consulting. Same here though, doesn't mean I agree this is appropriate, but admittedly you get comfy and it's difficult to move away once you're at a certain level.

expat,ff5t6tb,t1_ff5mad4,1579609319.0,"Despite being from a very standard four-season country, I hate the cold and weather is a huge consideration. I think from most angles I would prefer NYC - but weather, beaches and general access to outdoors create a certain pull towards LA - also see my comment above on being a slightly paradox person. I love being outdoors, but am not so much the green juice-meditation type - though I'm quite open-minded and willing to try anything that broadens my horizons.

Salary-wise I'm around that amount, a bit lower and some of it in stock (could probably make a case for a slight cash increase), so I think I'd have a good life in either place and one that is similar to what I have now - also in a very expensive country. I don't care much about material things, let alone luxury goods, but I do love experiences and travel. Much of the financial situation depends on a deeper discussion about the tax situation."
expat,ff5sup7,t1_ff5kb3g,1579608946.0,"I've actually spent two months in San Diego once, albeit a long time ago. I didn't consider it up until now, but can see your point re this being very California.

I do admit space and apartment/house size are a consideration. I own an apartment where I live in Europe and it's quite large, there's no way I'd get that in NYC. I don't need a house, but would probably get more for my money in LA - however then I'd also need a car of course, so it probably would balance out. Need to look at all this for SD as well.

As a person I'm a bit of a paradox. I would describe myself as very corporate and intellectual by day, but a outdoorsy surfing free-spirit by night. I really swing between extremes. Which is probably why I'm so unsure. I can totally seeing myself leading the stressful busy NYC life, but also totally dig the more chilled beachy vibe LA can offer. 

From the perspective of a social life, I'm wondering if the sprawl of LA would make it more difficult, but that's probably a very simplistic view. I also acknowledge that there's some superficial elements in LA which don't bother me now but I wonder if they might? I'm probably overthinking that though. There's always two sides to any coin I guess."

HumansBeingBros,fdunw4y,t3_en011z,1578736004.0,"Many years ago when I was 22, I had a part time job while goung to grad school. I'm saying part time, but it was 30 hours a week on top of school. It was at a consulting company, so tons of mobey in the firm. I made an ok amount but obviously not much - enough to make a living, but no real luxuries, which of course at that age was fine.

My boss did some coaching on the side and one day I proofread a document/article for him that he had written on brain and behavior. He made a reference to a particular book and I thought it was fascinating. When I gave him back the doc I told him so. This was around 6.30pm. The next morning, I come to the office and find a gift on my desk, complete with a personal note. He had gone to the bookstore after 7 the night before to buy me that book, simply because I mentioned in passing how interesting I thought the topic was. We're talking about a senior partner here who more or less worked around the clock and was travelling all the time.

I had been invited many times to 250$ lunches and stuff - obviously an insane luxury for a 22-year old student of middle-class background - and even generous birthday gifts from the office were the norm. But somehow getting that book was the most thoughtful gesture from any boss I ever had. A little often goes a very long way and it takes very little to be a decent human being."
