Takeru Satoh returning after so long was a best-kept surprise, he is a top actor and with multiple high-profile roles whoever thought of him returning until his scene showed up.

KamenRider,fe6mmlz,t3_enwq2s,1578896108.0,"Remember the time Shirakura tweeted about having no western fanbase only to be replied back with force, he acknowledged us later and did mention in reply how the failure of KR Dragon Knight and Masked Rider may have soured them from having any adaption and he wants the franchise to be exported like most animes are (officially subbed). This includes the animated adaption as while it sound good on paper and there is potential gold, Toei decision is the key factor as if they are impressed then it is okay otherwise I don't think they want to invest in animated series yet. 

Also here are my points for adapting the new series if there is an intention of doing so:

1. If the plan to adapt an old KR season, do the current PR season route or what Thomasjujube on Youtube is doing. Certain series must be omitted to make the better.
2. If the animated series is a thing then redo both Dragon knight and Masked Rider, and add changes to the series to make them better than the original. Or like SD with Showa riders as well.
3. BE HONEST IN WHAT DEMOGRAPHIC IS TARGETED FOR THE SERIES!

Amazon Prime is likely a choice as they did stream the KR Amazon series their so any other series can be found there"
