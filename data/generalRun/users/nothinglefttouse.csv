Honest to God.  He is SO bizarre but I shouldn't be surprised, he's the same asshole that wears hospital bracelets to remember his stay.

What in the actual FUCK is wrong with him?  I don't want a souvenir from a horrific tragedy if I'm going to donate to a cause.  Better my donated money be spent on helping the people who are suffering than to send me a koala bear???!!!

Can you imagine if, after 9/11, there were an organization accepting donations and in return sending a replica of the Twin Towers, or after the Route 91 shooting in Vegas people donated and were sent ""Welcome to Fabulous Las Vegas"" signs?!?!

A dog is a lifetime commitment and, barring any unforeseen circumstances (like a dog that is dangerous/bites) it's a lifetime commitment.  I can't stand when people get a puppy so cavalierly; they're not disposable!  They get attached to their families (and to their litter mate because you were a moron and got TWO!)  I hope these two beautiful pups find a good home, soon, and aren't just dumped at a shelter."

Fucking pisses me off, they had no business getting TWO dogs to begin with, trying to train one puppy is a monumental feat in and of its own.  So now, they're big untrained dogs who jump and bite and don't know their own strength, they're likely bonded to one another and she's going to get rid of them.  

Assholes.  They got the puppies shortly before she got pregnant.  I can't remember if she said this was a planned pregnancy. If it was and they STILL got two puppies, they're even shittier human beings that I imagined."
