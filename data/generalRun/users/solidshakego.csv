SWG legends has the biggest population

SWGemu has the second biggest 

SWGemu Basilisk has the third largest and is before CU

Read up on this version. It takes more time to level, you have 3 different health bars. Players have to heal you. But it’s the most in depth Star Wars sandbox imo. A really great experience. After the combat update the game doesn’t get “easier”. It just has more questing than straight grinding. But you can still be the weird characters like an entertainer. 

Either server you pick and what version. The fame is fantastic, and we should all be thankful people work hard to keep these online and updated all for free."

Good news though, when you all move out of the house, we can already tell you’re going the be the most successful and responsible. And a clean house also leads to much better relationships.
