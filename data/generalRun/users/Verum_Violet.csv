HobbyDrama,ffbdkm8,t1_ffbbrhb,1579760797.0,"I honestly wonder about whether Western audiences would have ever encountered anything outside of the ""norm"" back when the internet was still relatively young... only certain shows were worth subbing/dubbing considering the amount of work that went in for the potential return back in the day. If people hadn't heard of it, or it wasn't considered something that would be popular with audiences outside of Japan, there probably wasn't much point doing a sub for the love without any advertising or streaming revenue as an amateur, and most of the big companies wouldn't translate an anime unless it was a likely classic.

illnessfakers,ff008t1,t1_fezikso,1579463741.0,"I may be able to partially answer this. 

We have one of these patients who always baffled me until I started reading the sub. I was given all of her records as I had to go through them to check if what they planned for her (elective) procedure was appropriate. The referral letter chain was.... depressingly illuminating. You can see the pattern in many of these cases after the patient has died or their records have been released for other reasons (finally called out or tragedies like Gypsy Rose Blanchard).

It seemed as though our patient, though they had legitimate health concerns, had an issue that could be (and from what I could tell, had been) be managed appropriately with standard care from a couple of our in house specialists that are familiar with the patient's medical history and proficient in treating her conditions. But the patient kept complaining of mystery symptoms or exacerbations of their illness that didn't tend to be backed up by tests or by the patient's functioning. Thus starts the rounds and rounds of tests. 

Usually if the tests show nothing and the patient's subjective symptoms don't abate, they'll end up being referred to (or the patient themselves will research and contact) someone really high up in the field, Professor X - who is the chair of X at some massive institution who becomes the patient's ""champion"". They are from an area the patient isn't, so it's this big deal to go see them out of state. Because they don't see the patient every day, maybe only once a year or two due to their schedule, all they hear is that the patient is having horrible symptoms that are affecting their QOL and no one can work out why or provide any relief or support. Prof. X thinks this is a problem endemic to the medical community as a whole and promises she's in good hands now. Pats themselves on the back for being the last caring and competent physician in the country, then sends her off for another year with a letter.

This specialist refers them to a bunch of specialists in the patient's home state, who end up seeing the patient more often and start to twig that a lot of what the patient claims is BS. The problem is that by now, the patient has this letter from their hot shot endo/gastro/ID ""champion"" describing them as a forthright and charming young lady who unfortunately has been suffering from all these symptoms, and no one wants to tell them that they're wrong about their new project. If they do, they just get cut from the team and the patient gets sent elsewhere, possibly to someone more accommodating, and the team sees the risks of patient ending up with some yes-man asshole who will give them whatever they want and not monitor them properly. They also don't want to dismiss the patient out of hand when they have complaints and a legit condition. So the tests continue endlessly, the patient begins to demand relief regardless of test results. If they don't, they go to big Professor X and complain that they are suffering and aren't being taken seriously, and their home team collectively facepalms and tries to figure out the best way of keeping the patient happy without killing them.

You can't just not treat someone and not refer, it's a nightmare for liability purposes and it's poor care to ditch a patient that is sick, even if you think they're exaggerating or even inducing their own symptoms. Referral carries a risk of invasive and unnecessary treatment from a less scrupulous practitioner, so the team aims for the most conservative procedures the patient will allow. Psych referrals are all well and good, but it's difficult to get patients treated for factitious disorder when they are actually sick and may or may not be playing up symptoms - if they end up dying from some weird sequelae of their original physical diagnosis while being primarily treated for factitious disorder or malingering, that's gonna look pretty terrible. 

I think it just becomes this slippery slope when you have a patient charming and manipulative enough to get powerful medical professionals on side. They say ""I feel better on TPN, that's what's helped me so I want a central line and TPN whenever I feel like it."" If you say no, here comes Prof X with a new letter saying that there's no harm in trying it as the poor girl certainly hasn't improved with the treatments provided up until now, she wouldn't have asked if she wasn't desperate etc etc because they can't fathom that their once yearly case study is putting one over them and doesn't see them often enough to work it out. There is a very defined hierarchy in medicine, as well as an underlying fear that if they're telling the truth this time, and the doctor misses something, they've failed their patient and their ass is now on the line."

HobbyDrama,fejfjzi,t1_feddtzn,1579171779.0,"Apologies, I didn't explain the concept very well and even here the video does a much better job of it, but it's less to do with the female character's naivete and more to do with where it places the male protagonist at the centre of her existence because of it.

Yes, the female character is somehow, very intelligent and wise, but has only just been introduced to the world around them - they possess textbook knowledge or the ability to learn; but in terms of ""human"" emotions, social skills or behaviour, they are for some reason completely naive and ""innocent"". The fact that they lack these skills (and despite being able to quickly learn or already be proficient in say, combat or tech) and have a very childlike manner suggests purity and virginity - well, defines purity and virginity, because they've just been created. 

So yeah, they are said to be the wisest and most intelligent beings on the planet, but are portrayed with the pure and wide-eyed wonder of the world we associate with children. The male protagonist tends to be fairly average in most ways (i.e. not a supernatural, omniscient being or even an expert necessarily) but serves as a sort of ""guide"" to the world and how to interact with it, which creates a power imbalance in what inevitably becomes a romantic relationship. They're attracted to that whimsical, childlike innocence and carefree nature that comes with not understanding the norms and acceptable social behaviours of the society they live in. 

Being the only man in their lives, and their teacher and protector, they create the image of the man the character should be with as they've never known anything else under the pretext of ""learning"" about love and/or sex. They also, conveniently, suggest that they are fit to be the purveyors of this information despite having no special experience or skills themselves, but the female character wouldn't know otherwise - insert lots of variously cringy scenes from a myriad of pop culture depicting beautiful but naive ""native""/time travelling/alien women who's lack of understanding of modern, human society makes them vulnerable and/or innocent which makes them special - aka pure and virginal, unlike those jaded modern women that have stuffed them around in the past."

A lot of people seemed to think the following books were great, but it's definitely more divided than the reception to the first. Someone being asked to investigate their client's own murder? Because, y'know, it's the future, so there are so many more opportunities for an interesting murder plot and it makes for a fantastic premise - it sounds like after that was resolved there was a lack of direction aside from the killer atmosphere. I really should just read the next ones and judge for myself, but the murder investigation aspect was what attracted me in the first place... so it definitely works as a hook if it's the kinda thing you're into, and a lot of folks are very into it.

Anime wise, I became bored as hell watching Death Note after the cat and mouse aspect was over and just felt like either Light or L should have died rather than the weird nothing that happened after.

Just because there is a common theme with a lot of military marriages doesn't mean it applies to every fucking person who ever married someone in the military. The sub is here to pay tribute to the worst of the dependa-offendas. I'm sure there are plenty of relatively sane, rational human beings in the military who have married relatively sane, rational civilians. Marriages inside and outside of the military, regardless of age, fail often and (often spectacularly). People get married cause they love someone, who may or may not be a service member. Yeah, statistically it's more likely if you marry young but its not like 100% of marriages under 30 end in divorce. 

The stuff on this sub is hilarious (and often cringy) but I've never thought to apply the stereotype to every military wife. I know plenty of people who's marriages have failed for a number of reasons. I'm not here to rag on other posters, I just think people demanding that personnel salute their bumper stickers and expecting discounts for doing the ""hardest job in the military"" is funny. No need to get personal, or allow yourself to become so jaded that it undermines the perception that many individuals won't fit into that category.

Like others in the thread have said, the flexibility of the steel is an indication of quality and Toledo steel was famed for this, so it's highly unlikely this was anything other than a decorative piece for ""surprise and delight"" demonstrative purposes."

AmItheAsshole,fdgmesi,t1_fde1kua,1578402195.0,"I kinda agree, but this is an unusual situation - obviously stressful and otherwise once off situations can put strain on a relationship, and I can't see anything that suggests that anything more sinister is all that's happening here. I honestly think he just misses his fiancee and that can be hard, especially if every now and then the party ""left behind"" has a situation arise that they have to deal with on their own. It's very common for long periods of distance to cause friction in otherwise fine relationships, it happens all the time. How you pull through in the end is what matters most, even if it's tough in the short term.

I don't think it's a death knell for your relationship OP, and I hope you don't place too much weight on people's opinions to the contrary. It is hard to be away from the person you love for long periods or feel that they're putting work or study before you, even if you know how important it is and that it means a lot to them - and it does seem like he knows how important it is to you and acknowledges it. He's finding it hard to cope with the stress of being apart. So try to understand that he will feel hurt and a bit lonely, but eventually he does have to try and understand that it's time you need to achieve your goals.

To be honest, no it's not great that you're fighting about it all the time. I'm sure it doesn't help with the stress. But it might be more of a factor that you're both young and he may not realise yet how important it is to secure your future now, because people at that age often feels like there's plenty of time.  I don't think it's necessarily a red flag. Red flags in LDRs usually being either of you mistrusting the other, accusing each other of cheating or not caring, verbal or emotional abuse. It sounds more like a normal couple navigating a situation that would be difficult for many older couples in relationships far more long term and secure than your own. You need to see things from each other's perspective, and if things don't improve after your time apart - which I absolutely believe you should take, and not feel bad about - then I would consider ending the relationship. There's no obvious red flags here (from what you've written at least - it's difficult to assess without knowing what's been said and whether what's been said in the heat of the moment has headed into deeply hurtful territory).

The big test - for your relationship and your studies - will be how you grow as a team after this is all said and done. If you can calmly explain why it's important to you to have this time, for your future in your career and your future as a couple, for your happiness as an individual, your aspirations and your combined financial security as a family - and get through it and be stronger for it, then you're doing ok. 

If it seems like he resents the fact you spent time away for your studies and can't understand the benefits to both of you, short term pain for long term gain, then it may be worth assessing whether the relationship is right for you. If he considers it selfish in any way (when it is incredibly important that both of you are happy, secure in your decisions and pursuing the path that's best for you), then yeah, start looking elsewhere. But people can be less than rational when they are separated from their loved ones and it's important that you each be empathetic to each other's situations, and not risk future prospects that will benefit both of you in the end for the sake of short term happiness."

I would have expected, for instance, maybe something about why you don't feel that she needs to feel that way, or examples of situations where she has been upset about the attention paid to you by her friends and family or something, but it's like you think it's just inevitable with how great you are that you couldn't possibly attend. It doesn't sound like she's done or said anything to suggest that she would care either way if you turned up or not.

And the totally unnecessary part about how you'll be staying in that night because you can never go out with your partner so he won't be recognised? No one cares what your plans would be instead; it's meant to be about your sister's wedding. No one asked.

Even the title of the post is arrogant af. Why would anyone pay more attention to you on her wedding day? You're just taking it for granted that they will and therefore you believe you should stay home, otherwise all the guests would just spend the night fawning over you and your incredibly well known partner. This is highly unlikely. Make your decision based on whether you want to be there with your sister on her wedding day, not whether you think the friends and family who are coming along to celebrate that would be more interested in your appearance or life story than the marriage of someone they care about.

The title of this should probably be ""WIBTA for not going to my sister's wedding so I don't have to subject anyone to my insufferable narcissistic tendencies?"".

AmItheAsshole,fdfdlyu,t1_fdekyon,1578359212.0,"I am seeing so many posts like these and it's making me furious, because the fact that parents are supporting further education in the US now, rather than the government assisting as a social service is producing a generation of adults financially reliant on their parents far longer than is and should be necessary. 

Plenty of shitty parents like this are leveraging the financial control they have over their kids to ensure that they can never fully feel free to take their own paths in life and make their own decisions. Your parents don't like your boyfriend? You're gay and your parents are homophobic? You want to be an artist and your parents want you to be a doctor? You want to get a tattoo or piercing? Sure, when college didn't cost far more than it does now and it was possible to pay off your loans or pay upfront by working while studying, you could do all those things as an adult and if your parents didn't like it, well they could get used to the idea, or not, but either way those decisions were yours. Now you've got adult men and women who have to follow mommy and daddy's rules well into their 20s or the rug gets pulled from under them.

I'm not saying that it isn't a kind thing to do to pay for your kid's education in America, but you cannot act this way towards an adult. It's not the kid's fault that it's a go to college or be independent, ""pick one"" situation, it's the convergence of a number of different societal factors that they have no control over. Being financially dependent on your parents during the time in your life where you are finding your way and working out who you are and what you want to be isn't a situation that the vast majority of people WANT to be in. Many parents are abusing the fact that their kids have been born into a society that forces you to make a choice between your future prospects and relying on parents or other family for support. 

Many parents are reacting to these kinds of posts with ""well if the kid doesn't like it they're free to not take their parent's money and date who they like, get that tattoo, pursue this career"" etc. No, that's not the case and it shouldn't be the case. Yes they can make the decision to go to community college or work for another however many years and then go to college later, or take huge loans, but it's going to leave them a step behind from the get-go and their parents know this, which is why they take advantage of it. 

The other response is ""well they're an adult, so they should be able to support themselves and they're choosing not to"". Also not true - you are not treating them as adults, you're treating them as children. You can't pick and choose when it suits you between whether you consider them adults who are responsible for their own decisions, or children who need to ask their parents for permission to make choices about their future. If you consider them an adult, then treat them like an adult and let them make their own choices, even if you think it's a mistake, and don't hold the money over their heads due to a shitty economic situation that's out of their control. 

What these parents are doing is ensuring that their adult offspring will remain children forever and never have the opportunity to grow into mature, confident people who are capable of making their own decisions. It would be nice if there was some consideration of the fact that students currently in college in the US are overwhelmingly part of a generation who has drawn one of the worst possible hands when it comes to the ability to be financially independent. There are plenty of concrete, specific statistics that support this view. It isn't right to take advantage of the situation as a method of behavioural control. 

If you are incapable of allowing your kids to make independent decisions while supporting them financially for the sake of their education, then don't offer to pay. Education should be a right in civilised society - it does not do the community as a whole a service by restricting access to higher education, it contributes to poverty and a widening class divide, increases unemployment and illiteracy and flatlines upward mobility. Either offer to pay for college as an unconditional gift if you can afford it, given the near impossibility of managing this situation without family support (I can already see the responses of ""well I did it"", again, these are outliers backed by statistical evidence, so your anecdotes are irrelevant), or don't offer at all and leave them at the mercy of society. 

Controlling your adult children with money because they were born into a society that doesn't care about you unless you can afford it is a universally shitty thing to do. At least if you let them flounder without any support, hey maybe they won't get an education and will resent you, but at least they don't need to seek your approval to get a fucking tattoo at 25, you petty assholes."
YourJokeButWorse,fdchov0,t1_fd5vazm,1578275158.0,"Eh, being lazy isn't something to feel pity over. Everyone has a choice. I was the same and just slacked off because I could in high school, while people as smart or smarter than me still worked their asses off. We got the same entry scores at the end of high school, but spoiler alert on who did a helluva lot better at uni, and most likely their career in general (where you need to be able to focus and see a task through to completion even if it's ""boring""). 

Being smart doesn't preclude being studious, those guys could have coasted through as well. Instead, they spent the time that they didn't need to use learning the basics to develop an excellent work ethic and ended up being very successful, well rounded people. I however ended up ""just average"" at uni and passed, but it didn't do me any favours in the long run. By the time university or college rolls around, developing that kind of work ethic without the support you had at school is incredibly difficult.

Feel sorry for people who struggle with the basics despite working really hard, or people that have aspirations for their future they can never achieve because of where they grew up, or not being able to afford a decent education - not for people who don't put the work in and end up doing way better anyway.

There are literally billions of people who don't give a shit about the vast majority of US based artists for the most part, and K-pop entries on this list are perfectly acceptable especially given the reach they've achieved beyond Korea.

When I was in Japan in '07 music shows really only featured Japanese artists on their top hits shows, this year it was like 70-80% Korean bands. For a relatively insular country, that's massive. I was in Mongolia and China for a few days a couple of years ago and it was nonstop K-pop on the music channels. I'm from Australia and 20 yrs ago no one listened or knew anything about Asian music here really (aside from people pretty deep into the fandoms, and also usually into anime, JRPGs and/or other Asia influenced media) and now most people would have at least heard of K-pop in passing and there are countdowns and top hits shows on mainstream radio and TV. 

It seems commonplace now, but imagine in 10 years there are a bunch of bands from say, Russia or Turkey that become huge in the US, with dedicated fandoms, radio shows that feature Turkish pop on the reg, scandals or dramas within the T-pop community being published all over the internet in English language articles.
