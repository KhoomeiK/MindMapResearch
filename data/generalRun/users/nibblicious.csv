I made this, super easy, super tasty, it was a hit with the entire household (I was only one doing W30).

Recommend making a double batch even your first time.

It's pretty thick, almost more of a ""spread"" than a ""sauce"", great for your burger, but also can use as a dip, like with fries, etc. It's so flavorful, a little goes a long way.

I did half the salt, and added the below  to a double batch (based on other ketchup recipes)

* 1/8 tsp paprika, smoked
* 1/8 tsp mustard powder
* 1 whole clove
* 1/4 large sweet onion, diced.

&#x200B;

EDIT: **TRUST ME, JUST MAKE IT!!!**  After trying this, standard brands (Heinz, etc) just taste like ""sugar-tomato"", while this tastes like **a real condiment, worthy of your food.**  Don't get me wrong, I'm down for standard ketchup, however, this is almost another level of food.  **And sauces make W30 so much better.**"
