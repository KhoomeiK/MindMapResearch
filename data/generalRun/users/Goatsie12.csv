Population especially didn’t affect those three considering that all three of them made most of their money from government contracts. Normal people don’t buy oil, steel, and railroads. Governments and other corporations do. Population does not affect the big polluters in the slightest.

Less laborers and consumers aren’t gonna stop them when they’ve been doing it for 200+ years back when they had a smaller work force. Governments and other corporations will still make contracts with the mining companies, logging companies, the oil industry, gas industry, steel, you name it.
