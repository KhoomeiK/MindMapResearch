AmItheAsshole,ff9ci10,t1_ff81hi4,1579709887.0,"This reminds me of a wedding of a friend. It was both her and her soon to be new husband’s second wedding. They were also living together. She had a bridal shower with the theme “gas and grocery gift cards” (I’ll argue that is not a theme - “hula night” is a theme) and then put an insert in the wedding invitation stating that they didn’t need any gifts and would instead like gas and grocery gift cards.

IsItBullshit,feyeicp,t3_eqp2y8,1579444396.0,"I will say yes and no. I have a thyroid condition. I have lost large amounts of weight and maintained the loss for years. Then, my thyroid will get out of whack and I start packing on pounds even though I’m eating well and exercising. When I finally get my thyroid under control again, I’m obese and now face a huge, uphill battle to lose large amounts of weight again. This has been a cycle for 20 years. Right now, I need to lose about 60 lbs... again."

todayilearned,fc4o7i5,t1_fc4ezbp,1577422607.0,Depends on how severe it is. I have an acquaintance whose son has this. He’s a year old now. They won’t know about whether he can hold his poop until he’s potty trained.
