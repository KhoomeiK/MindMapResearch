BasicBulletJournals,fef0s1n,t1_feeuqax,1579045491.0,I tried that 'Year in Pixels' mood tracker last year and other separate trackers and I ended up not filling them out.

bulletjournal,feetbr6,t1_feemnph,1579040767.0,37k steps is a rarity. I ran a half marathon that day. That's why i was both happy and tired on the 12th hahaha
bulletjournal,feet4s8,t1_feekl5y,1579040649.0,"I've been tracking my sleep ever since I got a smart watch and I noticed that if I could just get at least 4.5 hours of sleep, I'm prettt active during the day (the coffee habit helps too haha).

bulletjournal,feepw5n,t1_fee841i,1579038715.0,I made a lot of trackers in my 2019 bujo and I failed to keep it updated. Probably because they were scattered across my journal. I decided to consolidate them into a monthly tracker and I'm really glad about this layout.
bulletjournal,feep7jf,t1_fee1rfx,1579038324.0,I actuallt went to bed at around 10 last night and I just woke up to a lot of replies to this post. I really need to sleep more. That's one of my goals this year.

Some titles of my to-read this year are: Oathbringer by Brandon Sanderson, Ninth House by Leigh Bardugo, and The Restaurant at the End of the Universe. I'll try to read at least 30 books in 2020. I scaled down from 52 last year."

> Are you using it for accountability for reading?  

Kinda. I always have a yearly reading goal. Having a log helps me keep up with my target."
books,fctlr2r,t1_fcswt4e,1577948034.0,Have you tried reading along with an audiobook? Listening to Stephen Fry narrating Hitchhiker's Guide to The Galaxy while reading the book  was really enjoyable.
books,fctll32,t1_fcss4ob,1577947834.0,That's what I do to prevent burnout. I don't read books of the same genre in succession.
books,fctlhlx,t1_fctau08,1577947718.0,The 1st Sanderson book I read was The Way of Kings. Started it with no expectations whatsoever and I ended up being a fan of his works. 1000+ plus pages seem daunting but I enjoyed TWoK so much I finished it in less than a week. I held off reading Oathbringer until the 4th book is nearing its release. It seems that Oathbringer will be my first book to read in 2020 :)
books,fctkvrj,t1_fcsr19s,1577946994.0, This happened to me last year. Went for 52 because I was able to to achieve it in 2018. I ended up finishing 40. But what I noticed is that I remember more details of the books I've read in 2019 than in 2018.

television,fbwzj23,t1_fbwlzqi,1577163894.0,I first noticed it was a different timeline when Renfri mentioned that Calanthe won her first battle. The previous scene showed Queen Calanthe mentioned during a banquet that she won her first battle when she just Ciri's age.
