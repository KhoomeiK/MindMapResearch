relationship_advice,feb2idg,t3_eo8m1p,1578954866.0,"You should just message her and say “thank you for the opportunity to be a part of your special day, but the financial strain of being a bridesmaid is too much for me. So I’m going to have to turn down this role in your wedding. If you do not want me to attend after this, I fully understand. Have an amazing day”. And leave it at that."
AmItheAsshole,feazkof,t3_eo6j73,1578953896.0,"YTA just because you haven’t talked to your daughter about this. I totally understand that you are feeling rejected. Whether a child is a biological child or an adopted child, to raise her for 19 years, then her to refer to her biological mother as “my mother” or “my mom”, can be a bitter pill to swallow. This is your title, you are the one who earned it by raising her. But you know you can’t reject her now. She’s most likely as confused as you are with the contact after all these years. But you have to realise that this woman is most likely just wanting to know that her child has had a good life. To refuse this poor woman that, is really horrible on your part."

You need to stand firm and move as soon as you possibly can. If you give in, you will find that one year off turns into two, then three. Then before you know it your in your mid 20’s, still hoping to go to college."

relationship_advice,fdz7ld5,t3_ene5n6,1578787485.0,"What this piece of shit done was rape you. Simple as that. You asked him to stop, because you were hurting. Rather than respect your wishes, he slapped you into submission, until you gave up resisting, and finished raping you. Then he says that because he was drunk, you actually raped him. Does that sound like the actions of a loving partner? You need to go to the police and report him. He needs to be punished for what he did."

Unless what they are asking, are their made up “neighbourhood rules”, and not actually enforceable laws, then you should just laugh in their faces and tell them to get the fuck off your property."

ChoosingBeggars,fdsi993,t3_emwux8,1578703256.0,"Honestly, I’d just tell this guy I’m not paying for him. He can cough up his own money for being a dick. If anyone else has anything to say, they can do the same. Paying 8k for people you barely know, and then someone has the neck to ask you to pay more. Then gives you the option of which seats to buy too. Doesn’t matter how much you make, that sort of greed needs to be addressed in front of the whole group."

She made millions of pounds and squandered it all. Has multiple kids with different men, and talks shit about them all being deadbeats.
