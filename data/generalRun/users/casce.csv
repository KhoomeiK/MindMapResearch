What the girl didn’t know was that the man wasn’t a random stranger but an actor whose job was to make her life hell by behaving super awkwardly around her family.

The show was called „Mein großer, dicker, peinlicher Verlobter“ and it obviously also only worked once.

Edit: I just saw that the German show was just an adaption of the American show „My Big Fat Obnoxious Fiance“."

If we force companies to use a certain standard these innovations will slow down significantly. Why should anyone spend money on innovating when everyone has to use the same standard anyway so even if you get the industry to change it to your innovation, everyone will profit off you spending money.

This is actually one the instances where competition driving innovations really works. Requiring everyone to ship an adapter for a standard that allows charging is good enough in my opinion."
