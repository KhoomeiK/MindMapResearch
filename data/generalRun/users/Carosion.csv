>“well when the RNC gets together and decides to start denying me insurance claiming being queer is a preexisting condition then yeah they’re obviously that malicious”

The RNC is basically NeoCons. They are not particularly representative of general opinion on the right. Paleocons and libertarians seem to be more prevalent, even if they aren't as well represented in the RNC.

Paleocons are pretty savage to the trans as they label them as degenerate. 

Libertarians usually are fine with doing whatever you want. So you can probably highlight this section of the republican party, to help. 

In terms of the ""insurance claims stuff"" (which might also be related to the military ban on trans people), the important thing you need to focus on here is efficacy of treatments. 

""Bottom surgeries,"" which is a gruesome but easily understandable catch call term for these types of procedures, don't seem to have any impact on the suicide rate. Which is astonishingly high among trans people. Effectively it's like me asking you to give me something to eat, but I demand that it must be wax. I'm not saying that bottom surgeries never work or that they don't ever get the desired result, but the data doesn't seem to support this. You can also soften the blow here by explaining out when more evidence comes out that the opinions of people might change. 

There is also a significant amount of trans women who later realize they are actually just gay men, but it's already too late for them to get their desired life back.

Another thing going off what I was just talking about is the tricky and nuance and low sample size of the trans community. 

Another pretty obvious point to bring up is the idea of media bubbles. This is something this person will surely understand. All sides have media bubbles that pick and frame the stories that promote their world view. So a lot of people might not even be exposed to counter evidence, therefore their motives could very easily be ignorance not hate.

If you give me more details on what type of trans person we are talking about I can help you.

Where do they stand on Non-binary or which side of the ""truescum"" (Transmedicalist) vs ""transtrender"" (pro Nonbinary) debate are they on. Also don't use those terms to flippantly because they are insults thrown by trans people over this divide. (Easy way to tell is if they go by non-binary pronouns of any kind usually they/them).

What part of the transition is this person in (if at all maybe they are done or haven't really started yet). Are they doing hormones, puberty blockers, getting boob jobs, the bottom surgery I mentioned earlier, facial reconstruction or other plastic surgeries.

Also (absolutely do not accuse them of this) there are some people that have other types of mental illnesses/situations where they will adopt being a ""trans person"" usually nonbinary, and are not in fact a trans person at all but are existing in that space significantly enough that it either gives them attention, identity, community, etc. (which is something these individuals are greatly lacking like so many other groups of people on earth). So you should maybe try to bring up the idea of a social contagion where people can change themselves for the worse to fit in with groups, which in it of itself is bad on both sides. (weakening the trans movement's legitimacy from the left, and spreading what is viewed as a harmful condition from the right)."

askaconservative,ffegxd1,t1_ffe2r6c,1579847566.0,"So that's a misrepresentation of what the rollback actually does. It's supposed to just let these people pollute their own land (assuming it's isolated or confined).

The problem that arises is that the bill acidently expands that to groundwater, which 3/5 of the US appears to be covered in, and that's just the major ones. It's also unlikely that anyone owns all the land to any particular aquifer and therefore you're likely poisoning the well of your neighbor. 

I think it's important to use solid accurate arguments, rather than the blanket statements you put because even a basic reading of the news around the bill makes this comment look dumb.

It seems the aquifers and the ground water is what is truly being targeted here, and therefore that's the argument you need to hammer on."
askaconservative,ffegmyl,t1_ffd4eeu,1579847250.0,"Wait even in the first article you cited they specifically mention how that bill removes protections for underground water which they admit wasn't supposed to be included. Usually ground water isn't ""isolated."" It seems even by the article you posted, the deregulation is going to fuck up and allow people to fuck over ground water.

I know not all aquifers are unconfined but usually they do spread further than just the individual property, and that can often be other people's well water. Just doing a quick google search on the topic it seems most of the US map is covered by a major aquifer that's been mapped by the US government. Just doing an eyeball guess, I say it appear about 3/5ths of the US is covered by these major aquifers.

>Additionally, groundwater would not be federally protected, an exclusion Wheeler has said that was never supposed to be included.

5th paragraph last sentence.

It also mentions a deregulation about methane, and it weirdly then described the regulation as being a duplicate (so not necessary) but at the same time the article says that it would allow more release of methane (a gas 25x more potent than CO2). Then they give the answer that ""the oil companies actually want to reduce their methaine out put to save their money.""

I'm not sure if that's true or not, but I'm not super confident in trusting the word of oil companies.

I figured you'd just say that and not address any of the arguments I presented in my earlier post about why it's a good argument or how it directly hits on paradigms that are prevalent to right wingers, and therefore is far more efficacious than an argument like ""immigration is good, and we see this in our increase in GDP by letting more people in to fill the jobs that no one wants to do.""

I wouldn't recommend this. You already showed that your comprehension level of information can't even deal with the 280 character max of a tweet.

We are arguing against a crypto-variant that is still beholdant to logic and non-hate based emotional paradigms in order to succeed and propagate.

Destiny,ff0le71,t1_fezu3l4,1579469953.0,"I'm concerned about your ability to comprehend ideas.

First you think Nuancebro is trying to argue something he clearly isn't.

You think he's suggesting those people are advocating for socialism. (NuanceBro make no indication of making such an argument). He clearly says the people who think X are dumb. (Prefer white commie ethno-states compared to today's neoliberalism).

I correct you and put in my take. ""I think this works because... people who are vulnerable to becoming groypers aren't all likely familiar with the extent to what Nick Believes, and are still fairly patriotic.""

IN essence I'm saying the argument is good because it pits white nationalism against patriotism. Without patriotism, white nationalism is just a weaker hate based neo-nazi position, rather than a protective fear based white nation/culture preservation position.

You then suggest you still don't understand the argument by saying ""socialism"" even though NuanceBro is specifically talking about the Soviet Union. He did not say communism or socialism. He pointed to a specific failed state, noted it was also an ethnostate, and said people who actually think that's better are stupid. 

In conclusion, calling an argument stupid and short sighted when you have no idea what you're talking about makes you look bad. Furthermore it's weird you can't recognize that; pointing to a failed white ethnostate, pointing out how the race homogeneity didn't really work out for them, and calling out the thought leader's insane position around the Soviet Union; is the most direct and efficacious way to combat that problem. It's literally arguing with right wingers with their paradigms and structures."
Destiny,fezmzeh,t1_fexehzk,1579459173.0,"Honestly I think you missed the point. 

He's trying to discredit the ethno state thing by mixing the communism stuff.

So First you are changing a question into a command. If you're a person in authority over them (as teacher are) this question is more congruent with the domineering role.

Second I think it's more direct and avoid metal hiccups. In order for me to get to questions I have I need to go through that question. Do I have any? Many people might re-ask the question in their head even if they had question. Maybe the question caused a weird pattern where they may have forgotten a question or detail or something because they had to go through the node (do I have a question) before just going straight to the question.

Furthermore if you presuppose the person actually doesn't have questions, it would force this person to reconsider that fact. This is particularly true if an authority figure is asking about the questions they have.

This tells me you don't even know what Yang's policy does. The plan has never been to remove or replace medicare, medicaid, or SS. The fact you are making this argument basically shows something when it comes to your understanding of Yang's UBI, The Freedom Dividend.

>Yangs plan is literally billed as a stop gap measure to help people that are going to lose their jobs to automation. This isn't an argument, that's his own words on the subject.

Ok good. Then we know where we should be starting any conversation around this specific variant of UBI.

>It doesn't replace anything

Also not true. So from my understanding it's an opt out of system. Where effectively if you need more benefits than 1k cash, then you're free to continue those. But the amount of freedom lifted off the shoulders of countless individuals if they know they have 1000$ more to work with is immeasurable. 

That 1000 for people in our system now, would help countless, in more unknown and indirect ways any of the other solutions like a federal jobs program, or classic entitlements are. 

So I see this is a better crafted social safety net that forces markets to pay attention to the new disenfranchised people. Also it can really help get around that nasty poverty trap a lot of entitlements are wound around these days."
trees,feppsqa,t1_fepotfr,1579327260.0,"1. You think poor people live on 150k a year??? That's what the entitlements you're suggesting are. Most middle class families are living on less than 13k a month. I honestly have no idea what math you are on about. Maybe a typo?

2. So your argument is that UBI doesn't work because a super small 2k a year plan doesn't keep people out of poverty, in Alaska? That's the argument we are going with here? 

3. I understand living on UBI isn't as good as having the job before. That's not the question. Andrew isn't coming offering you to live on UBI instead of your job. Your job is getting taken, and this is the best plan the government is posing to help you. You still have a stable income. That can help you saving keep you going longer, till you figure out something new. The idea of the Freedom Dividend is to empower Americans to solve their own problems.

The program doesn't solve everything but increasing the buying power of the bottom 96% of americans at the expense of some old welfare programs, and a new VAT tax. These seems a lot better than the welfare programs of today that you can literally become too wealthy to be on while making less money then they actually pay out, and avoid the obvious poverty trap mechanism.

Generally true, but wrong here. We can literally listen to statements/interviews both candidates have made on this topic during the campaign trail.

This is just a naturalistic fallacy. Saying something is the way it is doesn't make it just. We build societies to do this.

Most societies have decided to offer help to their weakest and worst off members. The degree of failure on this is usually the measurements we use to look at our societies.

This isn't even true. Immigrants are more likely to start businesses.
