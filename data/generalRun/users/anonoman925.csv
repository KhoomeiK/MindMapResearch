If there’s a huge grind sound at start, the solenoid isn’t meeting with the starter (it’s an electric motor that gears into a larger electric/ mechanical motor). Most rattling is interior because of years of heat/cold expansion. Also fans. They’re electric motor with a wheel attached. The wheel can slip here and there. Just turn up the radio. 

But learn about the parts to a car on YouTube. The electronics in a car (O2 sensors) can be out of whack but not make noise.

Look up basic care. Oil should be yellow. Get a change at hint of black. No orange. That could mean rust. Pull (yellow tip), whips, put back, pull, measure. Don’t check after running - coolant (the radiator, flat piece on the side or front) should look green. Black or orange, like oil - same reasons. 

When I think used car I think 1990, because I’m older now. If it’s 2010 or forward (especially Toyota or Honda) they’ll run forever even if you treat them like a piece of shit. 

****any noises that sound cyclical when you speed/ slow, squeal when braking get checked. Wheels and assembly is what you want to worry about most. Ask the mechanic “if the rotor are shiny”. It’s called glazing and you can lose ability to brake. Rotors should not shine. It should look clean, but dull gun metal and feel like high grit sandpaper. 

Check your lights in the dark. Back up to a wall, hit the brakes, full even spread. Fast blinker, bulb out.

It’s a fact that locking people in cages can act as a deterrent. It’s perverse, but factually accurate. 

Neither side is interested in fixing immigration.

Teachers,ffdcdvg,t1_ffdbh3r,1579817893.0,"Didn’t  “lose it”. You raised your voice in order to communicate urgency. 

The emotional attachment you have to the behavior of your students isn’t correlated to your ability, yours or their character. 

It is a condition/ symptom of our public education system. 

Consider the polite student who asks to go to the bathroom. She might be changing a tampon. And we appreciate this behavior, but totally miss the dehumanizing aspect of having to monitor a human being’s hygiene habits well beyond appropriate age and maturity. 

I train my students to give me a heads up they’re leaving, because, for some reason allowing kids to roam to take care of themselves is eclipsed by the chance they’ll take too long or screw off. 

You’re doing your best in an overtaxed system with perverse incentives. Relax in the fact that, at the end of the day, student enjoyment while you peel back the curtain of the world is a job-well-done. 

In the meantime tell the kid who’s throwing gang signs just said “he shit himself” in ASL. Because gang members don’t throw signs in school. Wannabes do."

bestof,ffd8fco,t1_ffd528b,1579815443.0,"> I MUST make two honest confessions to you, my Christian and Jewish brothers. First, I must confess that over the last few years I have been gravely disappointed with the white moderate. I have almost reached the regrettable conclusion that the Negro's great stumbling block in the stride toward freedom is not the White Citizens Councillor or the Ku Klux Klanner but the white moderate who is more devoted to order than to justice; who prefers a negative peace which is the absence of tension to a positive peace which is the presence of justice; who constantly says, ""I agree with you in the goal you seek, but I can't agree with your methods of direct action""; who paternalistically feels that he can set the timetable for another man's freedom; who lives by the myth of time; and who constantly advises the Negro to wait until a ""more convenient season."" Shallow understanding from people of good will is more frustrating than absolute misunderstanding from people of ill will. Lukewarm acceptance is much more bewildering than outright rejection

Do I have your permission to ask a 20 year expert in childhood reading for a list of books, or do you expect every struggling/ busy parent to pick 5 books off the shelf and easily assess what’s a challenge and what’s out of their grasp?"
Teachers,ffd18ve,t3_eswlrj,1579811421.0,"I can see both sides. 

Professionalism can mean keeping a sanitary distance. Take the abuse, find Buddha, but keep it clinical. Be objective. You need to show them consistency and model levelheadedness. 

On the other hand, students come to expect what they are shown. In my 15 years in different work spheres before teaching, kids would be fucking fired  for their behavior and work habits. 

A football coach cannot expect to win football games without showing absolute passion; anger, happiness, frustration, appreciation. 

An even keel emotional state in the face of adversity sets the wrong expectation for kids. If they talk to their manager the way they talk to us, they aren’t given a 15 minute break to cool off. 

Kids know how to behave. I had this thuggish kid who would make class a bit of hell. My wife and I tried a new restaurant and he was the busboy. It was yes sir, no sir...he was dressed professionally (for a busboy). 

I left him a tip and talked him up to the manager. And I’d give him a ration of shit if he acted up in class. “Don’t expect a tip next time...”"

“You have no method?”
