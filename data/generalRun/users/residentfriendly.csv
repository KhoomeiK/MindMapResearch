AskMen,fdjd8jm,t3_elknnl,1578466036.0,"I’ve never dated someone chubby until I met my ex. I was hesitant about committing to her the first two weeks due to her weight. However, my hesitation was quickly thrown out the window once I really got to know her. The focus was shifted from her being chubby to me wanting to be with the person for who she is. I ended up dating her for two years and she was the best girlfriend I’ve ever had. She sees the good in people and helps me when I have difficulties. She was caring, empathetic, confident, and beautiful.

I’m relatively fit, 6’ 200lb, 32 waist, workout consistently so one of the thing I had to overcome was people consistently telling me I can date someone better. The thing is, she’s the best person I’ve met and I was happy. But people’s comment will make you question and doubt and negs you out. You have to focus on the positive and avoid the toxic comments.

Pulling from my conversations with my ex, being overweight, regardless of man or woman, means having to overcome people’s judgement and prejudice about your weight. Having to overcome that hurt and sadness from the judgmental eyes of those around you, you become more aware of people’s feeling and you are more careful not to hurt those around you. 

so to answer your question, yes, I would absolutely date another chubby woman. As for how chubby is too chubby, there’s no answer to that except how you feel."
