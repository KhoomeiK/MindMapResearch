tattoos,feqlti6,t3_eqdujs,1579343390.0,"Depends on the artist and country what they recommend. But in general I would say keep it airy, do not wrap it at night. Cleanse it once or twice a day (so mornings and evenings would do nicely) with a non perfumed liquid soap (I prefer Neutral, but don't know where you are and if they have it over there) and then put some crème on it, you probably got it from the tattoo shop or pharmacy. Make sure it's especially for the care of tattoos, so no vaseline etc. Again, preferably without perfume. Do this until it's healed. Hope this helps and I didn't forget anything :) and hope you're happy with your new tattoo! Cheers!"
