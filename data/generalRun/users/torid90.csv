corgi,fczijej,t1_fczi1g7,1578102007.0,I think people are just used to corgis being just red/white and looking a specific way. They don’t realize all the different color pembroke and cardigan corgi’s come in.
corgi,fcz1dl1,t1_fcyq8q7,1578091737.0,I love that description
corgi,fcz1a9m,t1_fcyqc5v,1578091687.0,"Her dad is sable and has a black muzzle too, her mom is a tri color. Her sibling were all red/white and tri color, she was the only sable like her dad. I always get asked if she’s a German Shepard though. She’s AKC registered though, she’s definitely 100% sable pembroke"
corgi,fcz16lr,t1_fcyv236,1578091621.0,I get asked often if she’s a German Shepard actually
corgi,fcyoq57,t1_fcymwln,1578084024.0,"She is actually a pure bred, pretty crazy huh?!"
corgi,f4vbkjh,t1_f4uhnu5,1571839840.0,"I was super nervous, it was the breeders decision to send them home early though because mom wanted nothing to do with them anymore lol. She is super playful, she loves chasing after our kids, she hasn’t been depressed at all actually! Good luck to you"
