aww,ff85bnp,t1_ff84obf,1579666406.0,Not that much! The video probably makes her look bigger than she actually is but it's crazy to think how she could have fit inside her mum who wasn't even showing that big either. It was a fast birth too. She has a full sister from 2018 who was a lot smaller than she is! She is 25% American Shetland (think of the pony Bonnie rode in [Gone With The Wind](https://youtu.be/W6ZlwezKaqg)) so she must have been a throwback somewhere
