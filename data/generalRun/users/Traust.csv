videos,ffj42ln,t1_ffj1sem,1579989865.0,"Much of the first season of the show used a lot of stories from the movie and it's very similar in the setup and characters but with minor changes to the characters.  The movie some times feels like it's just a bunch of scenes thrown together with no organic flow as it's telling the story over several years.


I do also remember reading that the cast and extras lived on set for some time to help build a bond that could be seen in the movie and some of the fill in shots of people walking around was the film crew filming the cast just living day to day there making it seem a bit more realist.  Cannot remember where I read this and think it was in the making of book, was some time ago when I read that."
todayilearned,ffa9dkf,t1_ff9wxdb,1579730434.0,No idea why but for some reason when I read this my mind decided that Jack the Ripper was an orca and now all I want to see is a drawing of an orca dressed up as an Victorian London prowling the streets for it's next victim which is a great white shark dressed as a lady of the night.

gaming,fejfdep,t1_fej4ohw,1579171509.0,Oh god I hated that cut scene when I first played FC3 as I managed to fuck up at least twice trying to escape so had the scene replayed multiple times with no way to skip.

Is it really THAT hard to hire good game writers?"
melbourne,fejf5ut,t1_fej94ei,1579171194.0,"Looking at the site I would say it's good.  Sites where the escorts have to pay to advertise and look professional generally means the girls are legit and are more than likely wanting to be in the profession rather than being forced or just doing it for the money for drugs.

Another hint is here in Victoria escorts and brothels have to be licenced and legit escorts will provide their SWA code in the ad."
AskReddit,fej8rt0,t3_ep9up7,1579161806.0,Kassandra from Assassin's Creed Odyssey.  So I could either be fucked or fucked or hired to be on her ship.  Only two of those options I would accept.  :P
gaming,fej8khj,t1_fej2o4y,1579161540.0,"I was so disappointed in the ending of 5 and view the secret start ending as the right one.  The bad guys don't make sense either, you get captured multiple times yet not killed even after killing one or more of the siblings.

New Dawn was even more ridiculous, there's a scene where you willing leave your weapons outside, walk in and handcuff yourself to the roof cause the twins have your friend hostage.  The same twins who want to torture and kill you both, then shock horror they kill your friend and bash you up."
melbourne,fej82v0,t1_fej1g10,1579160896.0,"Asian escorts are normally around the $250 for an hour, while Australian girls are around the $500 mark.  Be careful using sites like Locanto and Skokka, while they can be good there is no vetting process and can be a lot of fake ads so you can show up and it's not the girl in the picture.  

Sites like www.privategirls.com.au/melbourne_escorts.php there is some vetting process from what I can tell and the more higher class escorts seem to advertise there.  

Remember your first time you could be nervous, I would also recommend going with an escort who will take her time and help teach you a few things.  Remember to ask her questions before booking, some girls love to help while others are just in it for the money."
AskScienceFiction,fej3ona,t3_eos4vy,1579155710.0,Working with the fact that they have remained the same age over the many years of the show we could properly say that the show is based over the course of a year and that the mean Nelson is early in the year and that the nicer Nelson is later on in the year when Bart and Nelson become friends or tolerate each other.

1) Was way too hot.  Don't visit during a heat wave in August

2) Didn't stay for long to really visit many places.  Only really saw Zagreb and Plitvice Lakes.


Cannot wait to return in nicer weather and this time stay longer."

pics,feeoxpo,t1_fecy2lc,1579038164.0,"Australian here.  After visiting Europe during August a couple of years ago I was shocked on how hot it felt.  You guys have no AC in hotels or attractions, open fridges for drinks (no doors to keep cold air in) at the stores, and no ice in drinks.  It's the small things that can make a big difference sometimes.

Will say however, your lakes and rivers are awesome to swim in.  Wouldn't dare swim in some of ours (if they had water in them) unless there was lots of people.  Our beaches are awesome (just look out for box jellyfish, sharks, rips .....), other than that completely safe.  :)"

australia,fdlu8gt,t1_fdlsljm,1578532614.0,The problem is these sort of things will not be re-shown or used in any political ads and if they do it will be buried by Murdoch and the number of LNP ads saying how great they are.

They wanted show what the feeling of being at the jousting events would of been like to those attending.  If they used lute songs and period specific music then the audience watching would of thought it boring, using We Will Rock You however gave us modern viewers that feeling.  Watching the second time around I really felt like how awesome it would of been to be there and really loved the movie."
