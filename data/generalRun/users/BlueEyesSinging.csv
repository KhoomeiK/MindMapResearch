bipolar,ffivos2,t3_etnjur,1579983830.0,My fine hair is getting thinner. I'm almost 70  and my dad and mom both had skimpy amounts to begin with.
bipolar2,ffivhde,t3_etk9cd,1579983695.0,Have you had your thyroid checked?
bipolar,ffiuwq5,t3_etkv0x,1579983327.0,"In the meantime, tracking your moods on an app such as Daylio provides data for the diagnostician
Good luck."
bipolar,ffa1f94,t3_es8lml,1579725949.0,Keep bringing it up with your mom or pcp  that you need to be screened for a diagnosis.
bipolar,ff9z936,t1_ff8kvii,1579724679.0,I just did this last night and it worked!
bipolar2,ff9ywfy,t3_es9m4p,1579724474.0,Only one in four people gain wt on LI.   I lost weight with conscious eating and daily logging of my food.  You can do it as long as you stay conscious of eating. If its too much for you ask to drop the dose or stop. You can eventually lose any potential wt gain.  I say give it a try.
depressionregimens,ff2ei62,t1_fakczr2,1579502825.0,Not common but still possible in your case. Maddening.
BipolarReddit,fewbazq,t3_eqqjrk,1579407891.0,I havent experienced anything like that before. I hope you get relief and that its not serious.

Psychiatry,few5me8,t3_eqbi4x,1579405742.0,I couldn't sleep after the 2016 election results so I asked my pdoc for something to help me sleep because sleep is so important if  BP. Fortunately I only need one-quarter of the smallest existing dose to help me sleep on some nights. We've agreed I use it only 5 days out of 7 as not to avoid dependence on it.
EatCheapAndHealthy,fetygqp,t3_eqj42e,1579381310.0,I chop a bunch of ginger finely the roll it out flat to freeze. I just break off a piece when I use it

bipolar,fea0kp2,t3_enuyjd,1578943113.0,It is a big deal and accomplishment to be proud of.
bipolar2,fe9xzfw,t3_eo085v,1578942449.0,I take both Lamictal and lithium. Adding  LI  kept my lows from being so low. It's the only med with evidence that it reduces suicidality. Get more info from your doc and see what you think.
bipolar2,fe9sozf,t1_fe97zh9,1578941137.0,"I think good docs know how to finesse and persuade patients to consider alternative meds they suspect could help us. I remember seeing my dx of BP changed on my records. That's what it took for me to take my illness more seriously. It's more intricate than my old major depr dx.  And yet, I continue to question my dx altho 3 pdocs have confirmed it. Lol."
bipolar,fe6j390,t3_enuu6l,1578892518.0,"Seasonal affective disorder is not uncommon for BP's. Light therapy is proven to help. There are light boxes under $100. 10,000 lux and larger is better than teeny ones.   Some companies may let you try it first."
bipolar2,fe6ise6,t1_fe65kje,1578892232.0,"Me too--I thought my BP II depression  just  didn't respond to antidepressants. Thank goodness a smart pdoc dx'd me and got me to start mood stabilizers by not emphasizing the phrase ""Bipolar."""
BipolarReddit,fe6i8se,t3_enu47o,1578891726.0,"I had the same response to LI as you. The first 3 days I started on it I felt immensely NORMAL and cried for joy that I hadn't felt that good in a long while. Then as the week went on,  I just felt calmer but nothing much else. The explosion of  introducing LI into my brain was so wonderful that I even asked my pdoc if we could start and stop LI so I could feel that same jolt. He said not LI but maybe another drug I could alternate days."
BipolarReddit,fe6hkvd,t3_eny426,1578891127.0,I sit outdoors for 10 minutes until I felt more mojo.
BipolarReddit,fe6h9q8,t3_enrgt9,1578890856.0,"Before dx'd, I didn't know there was any other way to live: crushing mood swings while I was  trying to fake it to fit in with my peers. My life was not going in a straight line like others' and had lots of starts and stops.  

After dx'd,  with treatment, counseling, meds, education, and support I can string together pretty even days one day to the next. I'm still discovering ALL that I am truly capable of now that I have mental health support.

More will be revealed."
bipolar2,fdt900r,t1_fdt66ix,1578713488.0,Sounds like a responsible and supportive counselor. Would you be willing to list a few of those suggested questions here?
bipolar2,fdsyzgy,t1_fdsv55e,1578709780.0,Spend more time shopping for your therapist than you do  buying an automobile. I suggest one appt with 3 different counselors. That way you are in a better position to compare and choose well. Doing it this  way is like creating your own version of Consumer Reports for   counselors. But not all of us can afford this but it is ideal.
Lithium,fdpoa8z,t3_ehelt1,1578634467.0,"I started at 150 mg. When I went up to 300 mg I felt a little too drugged. My sweet spot is around 225 mg which only comes in liquid form. It gives me the benefit of not dropping down so far into depression. I can think well at this dose.  Sure, I had a bit of nausea but Tums does the trick. I get benefit from this low dose even though my lst level just came back at -- wait for it--  0.1   We're all different."
Lithium,fdfosm5,t3_ekolbs,1578366635.0,I'm not sure.
Lithium,fdfa43r,t3_ekolbs,1578356859.0,Yes. Sounds faster than you planned.
Lithium,fdf5wgb,t1_fdf5gdw,1578354032.0,I was at ~ 300 mg. 1 unit = 60 mg so 0.2 units is 12 mg. Yes liquid at night only. I sleep like a baby.
