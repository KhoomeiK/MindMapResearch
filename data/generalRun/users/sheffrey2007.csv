Anyway, my mom loved to refurbish thrift store furniture.  There I am at 10 PM and watching the Pens score huge goal late. 

So like any 12 year old what do I do with this beautiful 4x4 coffee table with some tiled inlay (literally finished day before)? 

Jump on top of it and start rocking back and forth, left and rignt...  only in the dead center ..

Enter *slow crack sound*, like ice breaking ever so slowly on a deep lake.

Then it happens... left leg directly through tile* and panes of untempered glass.

First night I've ever heard: ""this is why we can't have nice things"". Ha. Also got 9 stitches. 

Tldr: watched hockey in family house. Watched late game. Team scores and I dance on mom's new table ( tile over glass)

With all this information, has the debate been settled? Probably not.  In 2009 the New York Times published an article that observed: “But when it comes to long distances, humans can outrun almost any animal. Because we cool by sweating rather than panting, we can stay cool at speeds and distances that would overheat other animals. On a hot day, a human could even outrun a horse in a 26.2-mile marathon.”"
