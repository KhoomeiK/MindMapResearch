Once you get to know a few local pinheads you can usually trade games and share knowledge. Pinside has some really good resources but the forum can be pretty lame when all they talk about is brand new games but the EM section is super helpful. If you get stuck you can usually ask questions there and if you provide details and check back often you will usually get help.

Good Luck!

bestof,fgrk7oo,t1_fgpzcff,1581048930.0,"I did my local caucus in Nevada in 2016. It was a great experience being in a room at the local school with my neighbors. It felt pretty local.

Problem is there were like 2 more levels and if a representative didn't show up to the next event an alternate was picked and if not enough alternates that represented that candidate show up then you get a representative that will go for the other side, effectively changing the vote of those who participated! 

What kind of sick monster raises their hand and says they will represent the interest of their neighbors and then doesn't show up? I don't know but they sure exist in large numbers!

Then people had to travel to Las Vegas (an 8 hour drive from Reno) to do it a third time where they mi- count you and  don't listen to the crowd and fuck up the procedure and just steam roll over everything effectively wasting thousands of people's time.

pinball,fgrdvuy,t1_fgqf8zr,1581044415.0,"It is hard to tell what the heck is wrong with the machine. There are probably a few hundred switches in that machine and a certain sequence that they need to operate to start the machine. When you turn on a broken pinball machine the GI lights often come on as they don't rely on so much circuitry to work. I am assuming that these are the only things working.

Without seeing pics it is hard to tell fairness of pricing as the condition is unknown. Great condition would make that price acceptable. Aso it is hard to tell what is wrong with the  machine. If it was legitimately working and playing before then it is a fair bet that it is something fairly fixable. If the dude is lying and it last worked like 20 years ago then it will be a bit more difficult. I would ask him if the score motor was running or what the machine does when trying to start a game. Watch some you tube videos of Ems and the start up sequence so you have a clue what I am talking about. 

This video is for a 4 player machine and the game you are looking at doesn't have score reels so that is different but it is really cool and shows you some of what you would be dealing with https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIzOKWA-jio

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKiwrIIpXd8 This is another video.

That machine doesn't have score reels which IMO is a good thing as they are often finicky.

If the machine was legit playing before then you would know that once it gets going that it would be relatively functional. If not then once you get it started then you may have more issues to deal with.

I mentioned getting a schematic which is a must for a broken pinball machine and because it is a Gottlieb you would need to purchase that from The Pinball Resource who also have all the parts you need. They own the rights to Gottlieb machines. This is a $30 expense right off the bat. If you need to order rubbers and a ball and other misc you will spend $100 easy without and honestly will probably never sell the machine for more than $500-$600 (unless it is really nice).

I stand by my first statement  "" As a dude who is totally down with fixing broken pinball machines I would advise you to not get this machine. It could be something simple but it also could be a huge pain in the ass. If it is your first machine I recommend getting a machine that is functioning. You will then see how things work and make a few adjustments and move on. There is little as frustrating as trying to make something work that won’t and you don’t know what to do to make it work.""
