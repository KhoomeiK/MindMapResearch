modernwarfare,fffo2ia,t1_ffew46l,1579888105.0,Nailed it. It’s painful trying to level up a gun in bigger maps only to lose gunfights consistently. I’ll grind a new weapon In shipment until I have decent attachments and then go play a different game mode.
nba,fffnm63,t1_ffe6h0f,1579887828.0,We need to make a 4-point line.
EOOD,fffn1gp,t3_etdbpn,1579887482.0,"I highly recommend reading “Atomic Habits” by James Clear. It goes into how baby steps towards a goal are actually more likely to lead to long-term habits than lofty, Herculean efforts. It sounds like you’re on the the right track (or stairs)! Keep it up buddy"
modernwarfare,ffclivc,t1_ffc5yxs,1579802012.0,Aim for the chest or head.
torontoraptors,ff6tri7,t1_ff5vzlh,1579634711.0,Exactly. Being underestimated is an advantage
modernwarfare,ff6rgvq,t1_ff6p64d,1579633339.0,"I saw a comment from a Dev in another thread a few weeks back that said the additional load outs actually caused problems with the gameplay. As far as I know, it was something they planned to integrate earlier but ran into an unfortunate road block with it."
nba,ff6qd4s,t1_ff55klv,1579632686.0,I love the pause where he must have squinted really hard. “Pretty move byyy...(fuck it) Iguodala!”
Meditation,ff4q21j,t3_ergtrv,1579569699.0,"I don't know man, you tell us. I barely meditate lmao. 

What do you think it is about meditation that gives you confidence?"
nba,fes5lqr,t1_fepi997,1579361654.0,Keep sipping that Haterade
Mindfulness,fervqxa,t1_fert2tm,1579358860.0,"Ahh I see what you’re asking. I think we should trust ourselves within the scope of our own experienced reality. It just makes day to day life easier if we’re not constantly questioning ourselves lol. But we should also be open to new information from others because everyone has their own unique life experience. 

Oh really, I hadn’t heard that. Lol yeah that guy books up super fast. I’m still saving up for my next piece before I book another spot."
Mindfulness,fers5ni,t1_ferpp6a,1579357754.0,"In the case of the drunk guy, you notice the boozey smell, slurred speech, and his unbalanced walking. Those are sensory details (smelling, hearing, and seeing) which could be classified as discernment. Then you compile that evidence in your brain, reference it with other times you’ve noticed these things and draw the conclusion that this man is drunk."
Mindfulness,ferotx8,t1_fernzmb,1579356626.0,I think so. Discernment deals with recognizing what something  is. Judgement goes one step further to draw a conclusion about that thing.
Mindfulness,ferntg8,t1_ferml21,1579356253.0,"Using words like “best” or “worst” sounds like judgement because it’s a subjective opinion. Discernment would be more objective, like recognizing that Franz is a traditional tattoo artist and not a black/grey realism artist for example."
Mindfulness,ferltgy,t3_eqgjc6,1579355581.0,Can you elaborate?
