FigureSkating,ff7vhwf,t3_es1pln,1579659335.0,"I think Wifa is a brand active in Europe? Because me and a lot of friends had them when we were younger. The selling of Wifa stopped completely here... (Belgium) They are certainly not the best brand, but they’re okay for beginners. Eventually everyone I knew who had them got recommended another brand after a while. So if you could choose, I’d go for another brand."
bulletjournal,ff5vmq1,t1_ff5twrm,1579611788.0,hahaha yeah I should try that
bulletjournal,ff5tj0b,t1_ff5t9sm,1579609683.0,"I already have another one, but I was doubting it because it's sooo cheap. In the end I didn't buy it, because I had already spent money on far too many other things in the shop. I guess that's just a part of going to the Flying Tiger. (especially since I work there as a student haha, I'm just giving back what they pay me)"

FigureSkating,fexzs76,t1_fex7tav,1579438909.0,"Thanks, that's really helpful!"
FigureSkating,fers8vj,t1_fepiyoh,1579357788.0,"I know how I have to do it, but I just learned it, so that's why I'm looking for extra tips. Especially since I should be able to do it in three weeks. We'll have a competition then and that's why our coach can't focus too much on practicing on the death spiral right now. There's still an alternative in case this didn't work out."
FigureSkating,ferrg8c,t1_fep53h5,1579357500.0,That's a good tip indeed! Thanks.
