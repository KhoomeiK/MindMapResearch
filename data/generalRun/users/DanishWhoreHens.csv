The increased level of cortisol produced by the near constant stress of an emotionally abusive caretaker causes permanent damage to developing brains.

Children are still, in practice if not declaration, seen as property. James Dobson of Focus On The Family recommends using a paddle to hit children and along with Michael and Debi Pearl, whose book ‚ÄúTo Train Up A Child‚Äù has led to several child deaths, advocate breaking a child‚Äôs spirit. Dobson even proudly relates a story of beating his dog until he was exhausted as an example of how to discipline children. 

As a survivor of severe abuse I‚Äôd like to see ‚Äúparent‚Äôs rights‚Äù completely removed from our courts."

AskReddit,fe0f5vc,t3_enk40j,1578812351.0,I knew all along. Frankly I‚Äôm just grateful I‚Äôm not actually related to the asshole or his dangerous and bugshit crazy family. Small favors I guess.
exmormon,fe0emr6,t3_enk4p6,1578811993.0,"I‚Äôve always thought that the sanctity of the confession is a bullshit cop out anyway, both from a legal standpoint and a moral one. Morally, whispering your ‚Äúsin‚Äù to someone who can‚Äôt say anything to the authorities but grants you forgiveness anyway doesn‚Äôt even qualify as a gray area and it‚Äôs a joke to call it repentance. And legally, it‚Äôs just one more unnecessary and harmful concession to religion like tax exemption. It just allows child abusers and rapists to completely avoid any consequences for hurting someone who is powerless and then wipes whatever conscience they have clean. 

As for Miss ‚ÄúWe wouldn‚Äôt have repented if we thought there could be consequences ‚Äú, If there were any justice they would toss this bitch out like the garbage she is, remove their kids permanently since we know where both of their priorities really are, and award the amount she thinks she‚Äôs owed to the victim."
legaladvice,fdh06gb,t3_el74sv,1578412499.0,"You said the officer left a message for your mom to call him back but have you verified that there is an officer by that name, with that number, employed by your PD? Just like some unscrupulous people will write phony letters from real or imaginary attorneys in an effort to scare people into doing what the letter writer wants, people will also call/answer phones claiming to be someone they are not in an effort to scare/convince someone of something false. If you haven‚Äôt verified the officer‚Äôs info yet I would do so."
TalesFromTheSquadCar,fdddwhg,t1_fdcv4zk,1578307705.0,"In my case the notification was sent to the current registered owner of record (me) using the address of the previous owner (the one who actually had the accident ). And of course, then they entered my name as suspended under his address. I had to provide proof I was living in a different state at the time."
TalesFromTheSquadCar,fdddloq,t1_fdcv4zk,1578307264.0,"Well, in my case it was supposedly the suspension of my license over failure to show the state proof of insurance following an accident I was never in, the notification of requirement of which I never received because the address on the ‚Äúlicense‚Äù I never had was for somewhere I had never lived. All of which confirmed for me that they were suspending an actual license per se and not just the privilege alone. I‚Äôm well aware that driving is a privilege in every state but in this case it was obvious from the initial traffic stop that someone had really screwed up and it wasn‚Äôt me."
cats,fddcy99,t1_fd8d6fo,1578306295.0,"I went deep because I didn‚Äôt want to rude and ask you why you get your shorts in such a knot over putting a shirt on a cat when ACTUAL abuse is sanctioned and legal and, I don‚Äôt know, so much more worthy of being bothered about. But hey, if you don‚Äôt see the connection or the irony then I can‚Äôt spell it out much plainer."
