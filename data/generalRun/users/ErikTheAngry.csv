It would, however, be hypocritical of me to call out the politicians who run my nation without calling out the politicians of other nations.  I am not complicit in any acts of oppression, I will not condone them, and I cannot accept them.  I have nothing but my voice, for what little that may mean to those nations, but I will use it."

One muslim dying to Chinese efforts is objectively less bad than a million dying in the middle east to conflicts created by (for example) the US.  But one muslim dying to Chinese efforts is still unacceptable, just the same as the other million.  One does not lessen the other, although the topic is the same they are different events.

Censorship is alive and well, however information does escape the great firewall, even if it is short-lived.  Because of this, we know for example that Chinese ""re-education camps"" are in fact interment facilities.  We know they are literally committing genocide in Xinjang.  We know that they are augmenting the HKPF with chinese soldiers, and that they are murdering protesters on a whim, only to declare it a clear suicide when they throw the dead body into an ocean or off a building.

Or if more ""official"" sources are desired, the UN HRC has condemned a lot of it themselves.

The conventional argument is that one's metabolic energy consumption is lower while they're asleep, yet the BMR increases on account of the body's activities while sleeping (increased healing, etc).  We aren't active, but our bodies definitely are.

I'd argue that the time excessive calories are consumed is moot.  Excessive calories will result in fat regardless of when they're consumed, non-excessive calories will not.

If there's more to it than that, fire away.  But the weight gain argument is BS insofar as sleep is concerned.  I certainly can't argue with the sleep aspect though being someone who averages 4-5 hours a night during the week, I'd die inside if I lost that many hours of my day to sleep, physically healthy or otherwise."

I watched downrange as she shot a couple more, and sure enough, she was shooting the shit out of the barriers at the top.

Snow is nice.  Until it's blown onto roads.  Snow blown on roads turns into ice on roads... tires hit it and melt it.  Then more blows on, and it just layers on until you have the wonderfully polished set of tire tracks.  Eventually it covers the usable parts of the road as people drive around the tracks of ice.

Snow on mountains is fun, deep snow in fields is fun.  Snow basically anywhere but on roads and paths is fun.  Some will say it's too cold, me, I say it's fine.  It's like sand, except instead of being gritty, it just makes you damp (which can definitely suck if you're out all day yet).

Working in snow sucks balls.  Had a job as a yardman at a lumber yard in my youth, and fuck that shit.  Once those boots get water in them (about an hour into your shift on an average day), they are damn near frozen for the rest of your shift.  Might have something to do with the -30c though so maybe we can't blame snow completely.

That said, I get some pretty fucking wicked drifting when the roads are icy.  I make it a point to gun it when I'm turning at an empty intersection and see how far I can get it to drift while not completely losing control."

SoH of course lack the charge defense though, so that's definitely a huge thing.  I use them like hammerers, presently, though I'm definitely going to try an alternative suggestion of swapping the LSG and SoH, then spreading out the PG a bit to absorb the charge first.

Is it because of the expert charge defense that you use them on your front?

I personally enjoy the LSG for their ranged damage, the shield and the spear make for a nice ranged unit that can't get charged by cav (unless I screw up lol).

I've played dwarf a lot, so I'm definitely familiar with the usage of guns, and I agree that guide is fantastic.  As a dwarf I always turn the army into a mechanical arrow (penetrates deep and then opens up).  Ironbreakers on the melee edge, guns all pointing out to the sides... inspired by the anti-cav diamond in the guide you mention - then once the enemy has no more units to flank with, the guns swing out to the sides and work their way towards the tip of the arrow having perfect firing lines on enemy infantry in the melee.  Army moves slow as balls, but that's dwarfs for you.  Murders absolutely everything the AI can throw at me."

<honorific and name>,

The situation in Hong Kong is dire and in urgent need of direct international attention.  As you are my representative, I urge you to speak to our government on my behalf.

The Chinese Communist Party (CCP), have engaged in reliably documented acts of genocide.  They have on many occasions violated even the most basic of human rights - rights that our nation claims to value and hold as universal, given our declared support for the UN Declaration of Human Rights.

This very day as many before it, they engage in the active oppression of the people of Hong Kong.  They do so in contravention of a treaty they signed when Hong Kong was ceded to their control, even going so far as to declare the legally binding treaty ""a historical document of no importance"".

Given their actions, and the context within which they were made, the Chinese Communist Party fits our nation's definition of a terrorist organization.  Pursuant to Canadian law, the CCP's assets should be seized and liquidated.  All trade with CCP controlled China should be unilaterally and immediately banned, via a trade embargo.

Furthermore, Canada should bring to table a unified embargo against CCP controlled China at the next meeting of the G7.  As a united front with similar social, economic, and human rights positions, the G7 stands in a unique position to enforce a change in CCP policies.

This is a matter of the utmost urgency.  The CCP will not stop with genocide in Xinjang, they will not stop with Hong Kong.  Just like they did not stop with Tibet.  I do see a direct threat to our nation.  A threat to our way of life, a threat to our ideals, and a threat to our very sovereignty if they remain un-checked.  Not today, not tomorrow, but eventually.  The CCP's international policy has always been ""the long game"", and they are playing it right now with the rest of the world.

Thank you for your time, and your consideration.  This is absolutely a matter which I will consider when next we hold elections.
<name, address>."
