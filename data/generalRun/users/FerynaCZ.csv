In all other gamemodes you usually have to upgrade your units to get better results.

Somebody else would fight Champions first and then get better results in Gate.

Of course pros will take the advantage of the kill - but pub players? Only if the rest of the team does not understand the fight became 4v5 and still think they will win.

I am not saying this is correct strategy (I followed u/d2cookie when i was tryharding, I would like to ask what he thinks of the current meta), but I still see situations in my matches where not ignoring the occasional deaths (because of somebody fucking up) has led to more severe consequences. 

I will probably digress, but my logic: Towers are worth everything, and if you commit to a fight where it is a 50-50 chance to win it (by heroes staying alive) is more advantageous for the team which has an opportunity to take the tower. Even though the chance is literally 50-50 (if I cannot determine by items which side has advantage)."
