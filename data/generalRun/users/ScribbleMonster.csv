SelfAwarewolves,ffis7p7,t3_etr9me,1579981398.0,"I get what both parties are saying. Unfortunately, the only ""pre-triage"" is money. At the hospital, whomever is in the roughest shape gets care fastest. But outside the hospital, it's pay-to-play. Willing to spend thousands, EMTs at your side while running through red lights. Can't afford it, grab some gauze and sit in traffic."
MedicalGore,ffe8swc,t1_ffe5sf4,1579839837.0,"From [Wikipedia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Echinococcus):
>The egg hatches in the digestive system of the intermediate host, producing a planula larva. It penetrates the intestinal wall and is carried by bloodstream to liver, lung, brain, or another organ. It settles there and turns into a bladder-like structure called hydatid cyst. From the inner lining of its wall, protoscoleces (i.e. scoleces with invaginated tissue layers) bud and protrude into the fluid filling the cyst."

If the bulb looks healthy, it's probably a broken connection.!<"
