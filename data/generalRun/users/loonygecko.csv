Would one potentially get digestive upset from too dense SA like happens with sugar alcohols or would it just pass along harmlessly since it's a fat instead of a sugar?  Maybe it would actually help the gut bacteria balance instead?  Or would it upset the gallbladder trying to deal with it.  Interesting questions!  I might not even be a good test case since I have always been exceptionally good at digesting however much animal fat I want with no side effects so I may be extra good at it genetically.

Insulin pushes fat cells towards storage mode.  This ROS diet thing is tackling a different end of the equation by trying to crank up ROS production which hopefully has a similar effect and at least some of the time will over ride insulin (or that is the plan).  How well ROS over rides insulin may depend on genetics and how high your insulin is.  Low carb is IMO still a great option, but now with better understanding of the dangers of pufa, I think the pufa is maybe why some lowcarbers sometimes develop problems after they are on it for a long while.

What i see a lot of in these studies is that fat or some sort of fat gets correlated with some other change which is then correlated with another change, which is hypothesized to be related to yet another change, which is correlated with some negative outcome like say plaque build up. And the conclusion is that fat is likely bad.  But the whole thing is a house of cards daisy chain of assumptions and if any one of them is even slightly inaccurate, which one of them likely is, then the entire premise is blown.  Most of the studies do not even separate the fat by types, most rat studies are done using crisco, and then all the fats are lumped together as to assumed cause and effect being all the same.  And then as you mentioned here, there are often biased logic leaps, like finding something for coconut oil and then somehow making a logic leap that this must also apply to 'animal fats' without citing any evidence.  

I find it hard to put much stock any kind of conclusion like that.  I think we need to look at specific types of fat that we think are healthy compared to say all cause mortality.  Because something that increases chance of heart attack by 1/2 of a percent might also decrease chance of cancer by 10 percent, you have to look at the larger picture to have any decent chance to judge likely best course of action.  If they were to say that such and such increases chance of heart attack by 1/2 percent so it's for sure bad, and neglect to address or mention cancer and other health outcomes, for instance, that is in many cases not going to lead to accurate advice."

Many first world countries have open range that is good for running cattle but not good for any other caloric production, I am talking about my country and similar countries.  

For third world countries, there are added issues of people just needing to do whatever they can to survive and eat and for many of them, passing up opportunity could be the difference between surviving or dying so that would need to be solved before any discussion of more global or idealistic goals could get traction anyway.  It's a waste of trying to wag fingers and talk idealism to someone who is barely on the edge of survival, they are going to do whatever it takes to put food in their belly first.

todayilearned,fektams,t1_fekojrp,1579207154.0,"Actually it's pretty common to deforest to make pasture for cows,they can eat pasture directly, feeding on grain is unhealthful for cows and most of their life is spent on pasture.  Corn is fed at the end to fatten them but it also makes them ill.  Ideally we would go back to letting them pasture full time, grain feeding is not their natural food source.  

Rainforests are cut down for all manner of things including pasture, coffee, coco beans, etc but most grain is used locally, most of cow food in rainforests comes from pasture eating, not sure if they do as much corn stuffing over there, they tend to do things in a more natural way. USA cows pasture in the USA and eat USA corn, we make plenty of our own corn, no need to import that.  Beef does not do super well on soy, that goes mostly to chickens.  I also would not suggest you vegans eat  lot of soy either, that much pufa and exogenous estrogens are questionable for any creature.  Soybean is not naturally edible and few creatures are meant to tolerate large amounts.  

And obviously being a tiny percentage of the population, vegans would have lesser impact, the issue has to be compared on a per capita basis if vegans want to convert others to veganism though.  As it is, cows raised on crap land pasture as often happens in the USA is an efficient use of resources since that land and those shrubs are not good for any other food production types so those calories if lost could not be replaced by any means other than making new croplands on good soil,  using more chemicals, etc.  The main issue with beef production in the USA right now is the corn finishing which is not necessary and not healthy for cows.  IMO that should be changed.  But the corn industry does love that new source of customers so it's a hard battle.  Also keep in mind the USA is an exporter in both cattle production and corn production so the USA does to contribute much in those industries when it comes to rainforest destruction, we take care of those foods sources at home.  However we import most coffee and chocolate so with those two, the USA does contribute a lot to rainforest destruction.  Yes rainforests are cut down for cattle production but those cattle are destined for local consumption, you'd have to talk to locals over there if you wanted to dial that back."
todayilearned,fekrl3y,t1_fekqcnx,1579206149.0,"Corn is what cows are typically finished on and the USA is a net exporter of corn so it didn't come for rainforests.   Also about a third of local production goes to ethanol.  The corn industry is a powerful political force, getting rid of cows would not stop them sadly.  But as I said previously, cows need not be finished on corn, that's just a recent development to squeeze a few more dollars out of beef production.  It would be quite sustainable if we let cows finish on pasture like in the old days.  THat would take care of having to produce grain for them.  COws naturally are grazers, the excessive grain is bad for them and also makes antibiotic use go way up since grain makes the cows sick.  

Ideally we would let cows stay in the pasture, and export all that extra corn.  But then the price of corn goes down and the corn industry does not like that sadly.  THe issue is actually complicated, when you try to fight the beef industry, other industries like corn is also going to fight you since they have a pony in the race.

Also a lot of chemicals are added to cut down on weeds and make the plants grow faster, whereas with the cattle, the ranges looks about the same cattle or no cattle.

Cutting back consumption here is not likely to do much.  

But if you want to get on the subject of cutting down rainforests, other imported crops we get like coffee and chocolate are often guilty as the cause of cutting down rainforests too and we DO import a lot of those.

They eat the shrubs until they are big and then later corn finished or not depending on the farm.   But the 80% of their initial growth is very efficient land use since that land is useless for much else other than shrubs and desert.  As long as cattle numbers are limited, and they are by law, then damage to shrubs is low enough to not cause damage, you can drive through these areas and not notice any difference from other areas.  So in this case, transforming plant based to meat is highly efficient, the land and plants are pretty much useless for any other use, you either let the cows graze or you lose those caloric food sources since nothing else is viable in those locations.  They just limit cattle numbers to prevent overgrazing such that the practice has been very sustainable for generations."
todayilearned,feki0cl,t1_fek4o8n,1579200453.0,"It really depends on the location, some places get a lot of rain or there are natural rivers or the plants are just drought tolerant.  Many ares of the desert southwest are just crap land that no one wants and the dirt is too low quality for agriculture so having cows graze there is an efficient use of land.  They eat the drought tolerant wild plants that most other animals can't eat."

SaturatedFat,fekg0f6,t1_fek3vjn,1579199263.0,"IME, it's easier to lose weight if you have a lot of weight to lose.  Yeah you will eat more than an average person but you will also need more to fuel that bigger body and you only need to eat at a deficit for your current weight to lose weight, you don't need to eat the calories of a skinny person.  In fact, they say it is healthier to lose weight more slowly.  Ideally this diet will allow that, weight slowly lost due to naturally feeling full instead of having to fight against hunger cravings and putting the body through excess strain against what it needs to stay healthy.  Amount of food you'd desire would also slowly dial back in response to your changing needs.  IMO the right diet means that we naturally crave what is healthy for us instead of having to constantly fight cravings.  Low carb is IMO so far the closest that has been found but it's hard to never eat carb again and personally I found that just a small amount of sugar turned out to be like crack cocaine that easily threw my cravings back into high gear so I sort of lived in fear of touching carbs."

Your body might not want the same amount each day either."

Haha did that a few nights ago, decided to cheat with a few noodles and a Asian food buffet.  WHat I am really noticing on this diet, I am 16 days in now, is that my taste buds are really online now and the after taste on those Chinese noodles was really bad.  Suddenly I can very much taste the rancid oils in foods now.  I have had those noodles before and they tasted good but now they taste a bit rancid."

Plus more of what you do eat goes to energy instead of storage, so a combo of two simple concepts, not magic at all.  Sounds like you are fully on board with the paleo mantra that carbs make you eat more, but the idea here with this diet is that the ROS can over rule the carbs at least enough to maintain healthy weight.  How true that is may depends on genetics a bit too, but I am seeing weight loss so I plan to ride this bus and see how far it will go.  I can always cut back on carbs later if needed."

Every time the story team would come up with a wacky idea, Larry would always chime in and say, “What if we put him in drag? That would be hilarious!” Eventually, Larry managed to get his way. When Baloo the Bear has his wacky (I Wanna Be Like You) duet with King Louie the Orangutan, we put Baloo in a coconut bra and a grass skirt. I think we finally managed to please Larry, and perhaps he was right after all. The zany duet between Louie Prima and Phil Harris is a genuine show stopper."""

Retconned,fehydrw,t1_fehv4sp,1579126355.0,"A good argument can be made that we don't have enough data for most of it to be sure if it is or is not happening, therefore assuming that it is all happening as a fact could be considered paranoid.  Yes, some of it could well be happening but probably not all and we don't know for sure either way, IMO the assumption that is for sure happening is over stating it though.

And the other issue is if this is a world where you make your own reality, then assuming the worst all the time may just bring that more into reality. I prefer to instead just try to focus more on any tidbits of bad around me that I might be able to actually help with as well as to try to focus at least as much on any good that is around me."

I have actually just been throwing the stearic right into the pan with things I cook and using it as a cooking oil.  It's amusing to watch it from powder to liquid too.  Sometimes the food sucks up a lot of it though like for onions, it seems to work as a thickener. Sometimes I add a bit of butter back into to thin it a bit again.  I put some stearic in with some bison patties last night and it worked extra well though, seemed to complement the patties.

There's a lot of really tasty sat fat food too so it's not that painful to switch over at least the majority of food to sat fat.  I even found some little mini pies made with palm oil and no seed oils that aren't too bad for the diet.  Plus some of the coconut icecream is almost pure sat fat.
