>Even though winter nights can be very cold in the deserts of Iran, temperatures rarely drop below freezing. But ice could be made even at temperatures just above freezing, thanks to a phenomenon known as night sky radiation or radiative cooling.

>Outside the ice house there were shallow pools or channels, and these were shaded with walls during the day so that they remained as cool as possible. These pools were then filled with water on clear winter nights, and how much water was poured in the pool varied depending on how cold it was. The water came from the qanat system of underground aqueducts that brought water into the desert cities.

>In the desert the sky is usually clear, and while this means that it gets very hot during the day, at night the clear sky can be used as a heat sink. A clear night sky has a very low temperature, and on clear nights surfaces facing the sky radiate heat into the sky. In this way the temperature of the water in the pool could drop below the temperature of the air, and on cold nights it would drop below 0°C, thus creating ice. The walls that provided shading during the day would also protect the water and ice from warm winds. The ice was then harvested before sunrise, and the process was repeated each night until the ice house was full."

That’s a life problem, not a sobriety problem. What you’re feeling is an essential part of the human condition. Life is full of uncertainty and no one understands our purpose or “the meaning of life”, some things are unknowable. You’re just finally not consumed by the problems of drinking so now you’re thinking about that.

Simply not being an alcoholic seems like all rainbows and unicorns when you’re in the depths of alcoholism. But then once you beat alcohol, the reality is life is still super hard and uncertain. 

I tend to feel somewhat similar. When drinking, I have one focus, one huge problem: do not let my drinking ruin everything and make me lose my job, my girlfriend, and my home. 

When sober, I start to think, I hate my job, am I really into my girlfriend in a forever kind of way or should I go play the field, should I move?
