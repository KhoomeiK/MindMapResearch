fatlogic,ffe9p4o,t1_ffe10qr,1579840579.0,I’m tall and my mom is really short. There’s a picture of us together that’s hilarious because it accidentally accentuated the difference between a 5’3” woman and a 6’ woman.
fatlogic,ffe6jsw,t1_ffdbycl,1579838035.0,"I have days I don’t track. My anniversary, Christmas, and my birthday. I don’t feel guilty but usually I’m pretty good about eating within a reasonable limit and I’m at a healthy BMI."
fatlogic,ffe6c8o,t3_et03by,1579837871.0,"My youngest overate after a wedding. He was around 7 and they had cookies and bars set out with coffee during the dance. We told him to slow down on the cookies or he’d have a stomach ache. He didn’t listen and we decided to let him live and learn. He threw up that night after he went to bed and hasn’t done it since. 

If it was a repeated behavior I’d worry."
DuggarsSnark,ffe50il,t1_ffckvy3,1579836863.0,The finger on the trigger drives me crazy. My kids even practice trigger discipline when they’re using Nerf guns. Until they’re ready to shoot the finger is off of the trigger.
DuggarsSnark,ffe4r1k,t1_ffc1w0h,1579836667.0,They might have to take orders from a woman and could be exposed to people from different religions and maybe even a gay individual or two. That would be terrible.
DuggarsSnark,ffe43cj,t1_ffe282h,1579836174.0,She sadly had miserable birthing experiences and was adamant that she was there to help us. She can be pushy at times but she wasn’t at all on that day.
DuggarsSnark,ffe1qh0,t1_ffdzcn9,1579834427.0,I had my MIL there for my oldest. She was visiting from out of state or it would have been a hard no. She sat quietly and brought my husband food.
DuggarsSnark,ff83rhu,t1_ff6v4q8,1579665205.0,My daughter loved frilly dresses and skirts when she was little. Then she’d jump in puddles and roll in dirt in them. We kept her hair short after she cut off a big chunk herself and the only way to make it even was to cut it super short. She hated having it combed and she never sat still long enough to put bows or accessories in it and ended up wanting short hair for years.
DuggarsSnark,ff83an1,t1_ff6p7hy,1579664850.0,My mom swears I loved dresses because she loved putting me in them. I didn’t like them and would come home with bloody knees from climbing trees begging for pants. And then I’d be in more trouble for climbing trees in a dress. My dad tried to reason with her a few times but wasn’t home enough to make a difference.
DuggarsSnark,feiocq8,t1_feii11e,1579143226.0,"I was an extra in a ballet. Male ballet dancers are quite something to behold in their tights, especially up close."
DuggarsSnark,feiev64,t1_fei41py,1579136887.0,"Reading other comments it sounds like this was a surprise shower thrown by a friend of theirs from when Jingle and Jerm lived in Texas. It doesn’t mean that the Duggars approve of any type of dancing, even one as beautiful and elegant as ballet."
DuggarsSnark,fehe009,t1_feh8gbb,1579114597.0,"I was browsing YouTube and found a video of a ballet company that exclusively dances to Christian music. They were talented and were wearing traditional ballet costumes that were on the conservative side. 

Some of the comments included fundies saying that it wasn’t “glorifying god” because their tutus would flare out during spins and you could see the bottom half of the leotards for split second. That brief glimpse could cause “a brother to stumble”. Other fun ones included “all dancing is a sin”. 

Never underestimate the nuttiness of people like this."
DuggarsSnark,fe8cfsk,t1_fe7nyhx,1578924769.0,Thank you. I’m glad that religion has been helping you grow. It’s interesting how it works differently for different people. My spouse is still religious and neither has a problem with what the other does or doesn’t believe.
DuggarsSnark,fe697x8,t1_fe65oel,1578884574.0,"I was still punished, but the devil excuse gave me some sympathy. It’s such a convenient excuse and is an easy way out. I became a better person when I became an atheist. I could no longer use the devil excuse and had to accept responsibility for my own mistakes."
DuggarsSnark,fe64asj,t1_fe5ki8w,1578881472.0,I got caught cheating because I was allowed to grade my own work. It was checked once after 3 years of the same system. It was okay. I cried and said it was the devil tempting me.
insanepeoplefacebook,fe2labx,t1_fe2f50n,1578839850.0,"It reminds me of a guy I worked with. His daughter was out with a friend. They showed up before her curfew and sat outside talking. She was grounded for a month because she walked in the door a few minutes late. I sometimes wondered what happened with her because I moved and lost touch. I always assumed she’d end up going crazy and rebelling, if not in high school at least in college."
fatlogic,fdyw0nl,t1_fdwrjzw,1578784145.0,I don’t bulk. I’ve got a slender build and even when muscular am fairly slender.

fatlogic,fdtbwba,t3_en29tf,1578714569.0,I went into the military right out of high school. Three kids and almost 20 years later and I can still fit into the uniforms that were issued to me at basic training.
ShitMomGroupsSay,fdq9k3w,t1_fdoe5qb,1578660279.0,"My mom swears she told me about periods but she didn’t (lots of kids and I have a few sisters so I’m willing to believe that she thought she told me). I only knew what it was because a girl at church told me. I had no clue why I would bleed out of my vagina for a week every month until 8th grade sex ed class. 

My daughter knew what it was long before puberty because I wanted to spare her and felt she deserved an understanding of her body."
justdependathings,fdnvqwo,t1_fdnoxdy,1578593827.0,We were out once and they asked for proof from me but not him. It was weird.
justdependathings,fdnnwdy,t1_fdn98q4,1578589673.0,"I love going out on Veterans Day. This past year I had the host at a restaurant look at us and put one of the veteran only menus back. It pissed my husband off more than it did me. I’m used to it at this point. 

And my own dad forget to count my years in when he was adding up our family’s combined time. He remembered my husband’s but not my own."
justdependathings,fdmq6bk,t1_fdmi1i4,1578560325.0,I had guys refuse to stand next to me in groups pictures in case their wives would get pissed off. We could be in MOPP gear and they’d worry still be concerned. This was pre social media so I imagine it’s worse now.
justdependathings,fdmq0x8,t1_fdmh3lo,1578560120.0,My husband and I were joint mil and then I got out and he stayed in. The difference in how I was treated by the dependas was night and day. No more accusations that I wanted to have sex with their husbands. Instead I got treated to vapid conversations about what they really get up to and which women were likely out cruising for married guys.
justdependathings,fdipbj4,t1_fdhn7n4,1578448013.0,I do too. We had explained to her and everyone else that was in the loop that we didn’t want any info about the deployment on social media.
justdependathings,fdha2w5,t3_el6xjk,1578418640.0,"My husband had a conversation with his first shirt because a former friend tagged him on Facebook. She disclosed his location (she only knew country), how long he’d been there, and his expected return date. All to try to pull a “my friend is serving so you can’t argue with me”."
vaxxhappened,fdgj4sr,t1_fdgcy9r,1578398923.0,I always tell people I’m off to give my kid super autism when he needs a shot and if his siblings need shots I say I’m trying to see if they’re going to catch it yet. I think I’m funny.
justdependathings,fdfctfe,t1_fdexd33,1578358672.0,I’ve seen that a lot. My mom used to get invited to a lot of the parties. She’d go sometimes but rarely bought anything. It give the women a way to feel like they’re contributing and a feeling of community.
insanepeoplefacebook,fdcuyhn,t1_fdce8ce,1578285049.0,We have a dog that weighs about 50 pounds so she’s pretty good sized. She was from an abuse/neglect situation and gets really nervous and growls around dogs that are bigger than her. She has snapped when a smaller dog jumps up on her. We are working with her but it makes me nervous about taking her in public.
antiMLM,fdb41ij,t1_fdanbjs,1578253500.0,"I was back in my pre pregnancy pants within 6 weeks all 3 times. When my youngest was 4 months old I was wearing a bikini and had a woman at the pool comment that her stomach wasn’t as flat as mine before she had kids. I was in the military and was on a 6 month time table to make weight and pass my PT test. I gained roughly 25 pounds each time, breastfed, and legitimately love exercise. It wasn’t effortless and it definitely didn’t involve a MLM but it wasn’t impossible."
DuggarsSnark,fd95wq3,t1_fd7blm1,1578228846.0,I was raised in a military family in the 80’s. It was back when hating gays was still okay. I remember my dad saying DADT would mean that gays would infiltrate the military and straight men would be targeted. To be fair my parents have done a turnaround on those beliefs as well.
DuggarsSnark,fd7b2dd,t1_fd75t18,1578201796.0,"It sounds weird, but serving in the military reversed my homophobic mindset. My parents talked about gays being evil and HIV was their punishment. I was raised to believe that they were disgusting. I enlisted before the repeal of DADT. I met a few service members who it was an open secret that they were gay. They were people that I liked and respected and it taught me a lot. I’m not proud of my former views but am pretty open about them because I want my kids to know that it’s okay to change your views if you learn that you were wrong."
insanepeoplefacebook,fd2e34q,t1_fd1pvv7,1578145889.0,I knew women who’d do a full face of makeup everyday on bivouacs or in the field. It was weird but it didn’t hurt anyone. It’s probably a soldier goofing off for a picture.
fatlogic,fcuhn2f,t1_fcueoqv,1577981178.0,My grandpa’s family immigrated was from Germany and they were all very skinny. I don’t have a blob.
justdependathings,fcti93f,t1_fcshi5w,1577944177.0,"I’ve seen almost all sides of the military. I was a brat, a service member, part of a joint military couple, and then I got out and was a spouse.

The biggest trick to my marriage working and the kids being decent humans is that I took advice given to me in basic training. One TI recommended that if we get married while serving to find someone familiar with the military. They won’t freak out as much when you have to miss holidays, special occasions, or are gone for long periods. 

If you do have a family while in encourage your spouse to have a career if possible and some hobbies or interests outside of your career. That goes for kids too. Get them involved in activities that they’ll be able to pick back up when you move. It helps the transition and gives a sense of continuity. Actively discourage your spouse from MLM schemes. 

Being the kid can suck. The good thing is that especially when they are young simple things make them feel better about it all. During my spouse’s last deployment we did a once a month movie or game night and ordered pizza. The owner of the dance studio that my daughter attends would check in with her every week to ask how she was. She’d also send home little treats for the kids. I don’t know if she realizes the impact it made."
justdependathings,fctf49s,t1_fct2kmq,1577941257.0,I hate it when people ask me if I miss my husband being in the military because “men in uniform are hot/sexy/handsome”. I usually just tell them that I don’t but he misses me being in because he’s got a thing for women in uniform. It usually shuts people up.
insanepeoplefacebook,fcte681,t1_fcsvpn7,1577940407.0,My grandma swears that if you cut an onion in half and put it in the room that a sick person is in it’ll absorb the germs in the air and no one else will get sick. Her proof that it works is that the onion will look gross the next day.
fatlogic,fct3l44,t1_fcsiqns,1577931982.0,From Christmas Eve through today I’ve let myself eat when I want and what I want. I ate because I liked things not because I was hungry. Tomorrow I go back to tracking and not eating more than I need. I enjoyed it precisely because I don’t eat like that most of the time. I imagine overeating everyday or even most days of the year would be exhausting.
fatlogic,fcp45um,t1_fcioeuf,1577849912.0,I’m 6’ and am fortunate to be at a place in my life where I can afford to order from specialty stores that carry long pants. When I was a teenager I bought pants in the men’s section and was really embarrassed about it (we lived in a rural and I grew up poor). I’m fairly slender in build but have broad shoulders so that makes fit an issue because to get things big enough in the shoulder means I’m swimming in extra fabric from the chest down.
exchristian,fcp2310,t3_ei1jl3,1577848101.0,I’m home with a fever while my husband and kids are at a friends house. Assuming I’m feeling good tomorrow we’ll have a quiet day watching movies and playing games.
exchristian,fcm3lz4,t1_fclfwbn,1577763356.0,I agree. Anytime there’s a tragedy or someone is going through a difficult time there are people in my family telling the sufferer that god is calling them home or lean on god.
exchristian,fclg30l,t1_fcl6lqb,1577746971.0,That was quite a wild ride. Who knew it was so easy to get a lonely teen to drink baby blood.
exchristian,fclexa4,t3_ehsz8n,1577746214.0,I know several parents who became hyper religious after losing a child. I have so much sympathy. I can’t imagine their grief and can understand why they’d turn to something that says it’s part of a bigger plan and gives them the thought that they’ll reunite when they die.
antiMLM,fclbz36,t1_fck74b0,1577744303.0,I just looked. It has one like from someone already on her team and no comments.
insanepeoplefacebook,fcjf0oi,t1_fciws1t,1577685242.0,I knew someone who said she smoked around her own kids but never her stepson because he had asthma. She was oddly proud of it.
iamverybadass,fcje4t1,t1_fci5dtf,1577684409.0,I served but never deployed. I used to stay seated when they asked vets to stand but one of my kids pointed out that most people don’t think of women as veterans and maybe seeing one stand at an event might help another woman who served be believed later (it’s a huge issue and I’ve met a few women who deployed and have ptsd who won’t go to the VA or ask for other assistance programs because of how they’ve been treated and not believed).
antiMLM,fcjahix,t3_ehg2he,1577681363.0,A Pure Romance hun that I know recently put out a post asking people to put money they might have received for Christmas on a dildo and lube sales kit. It was really weird and I’m not surprised that it’s a thing across other MLM Huns.
TheMaskedSinger,fc8ct3w,t1_fbs53ik,1577532020.0,"I even told my husband by the third week that I was bored with him. He had great vocals but I never felt any real emotion during his performances. He wasn’t having fun with it like the others and it showed. 

To be fair I didn’t even know who he was when he unmasked. I tried watching videos of his past performances thinking maybe the mask hampered him and I still wasn’t impressed."
ShitMomGroupsSay,fc88r8a,t1_fc6gu00,1577529418.0,"I always wrote titles in front of the names we considered. Things like Dr, President, and the standard Mr and Ms. if it didn’t sound like an adult name or seemed weird with a formal title it was tossed out. We also considered the initials to make sure they weren’t embarrassing and used the most common spellings to make their lives easier."
ShitMomGroupsSay,fc886wj,t1_fc5czxh,1577529048.0,My mom always said that I have such grownup names to such tiny babies about my kids. I pointed out that I hope they are adults much longer than they are babies or toddlers.

LuLaNo,fc85w93,t1_fc6qnuj,1577527566.0,"Our local ones have the “designer racks”. I’m not sure who decides what goes on those, but I’ve seen worn out Victoria’s Secret leggings, Columbia coats with rips, and pilling Lularoe dresses for half or more of their original retail price. On those same trips I’ve found NWT dresses from places like Banana Republic and Ann Taylor at the normal price for dresses from GW. It’s ridiculous and I’m searching for a new thrift store to frequent."
insanepeoplefacebook,fc80meq,t1_fc6ak4j,1577523690.0,"Hell, my uncle complained that Obama’s salute was too polished and perfect looking and was clearly rehearsed so it was phony and disrespectful to anyone who ever served in the military. They kept silent about absolutely nothing."

fatlogic,fc7tgv1,t3_egin25,1577518199.0,"Height can play a massive roll in someone looking skinny. I’m 6’, weigh 155 lbs, and wear a size 6. I knew someone who was shocked that my size was that big and my weight that high. She also wore a 6, but was much shorter so looked bigger. She also had a hard time comprehending that I could eat more on a daily basis than she could. She thought it was unfair that I weighed more but was her size and looked smaller."
fatlogic,fc7slcy,t3_egmtmo,1577517573.0,I can kind of get behind #4 but only because I’m the type that tends to overeat without carbs. My spouse has been avoiding them and I decided to give it a try just to make meal prep easier. It didn’t work for me but my spouse enjoys it.
