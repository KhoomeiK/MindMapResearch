StartledCats,ff6qpb5,t1_ff4o95d,1579632884.0,"Well they are sisters, I rescued them from a big litter of kitties and Fee was the only Calico, like the mom. When I went to see them, the two of them were snuggled up and I immediately loved them. They are very protective of each other, but then wrestle in the middle of the night and break things. Oy! Cats..."
