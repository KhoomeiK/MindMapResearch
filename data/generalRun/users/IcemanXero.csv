facepalm,fdds45y,t3_ekjf39,1578322547.0,"First lets recap. The gregorian calendar is not exact. So saying the decade, or century, or millennium ends or begins at any particular time is a shot in the dark at best. Second, we are talking about a group of things not how many things have passed. Agroup of ten years is a decade. While 203 decades will not have passed until 2021, ten fucking years have passed since 2010. Now fuck off with your bs 5 min google search"

facepalm,fc9blwq,t1_fbxmlwc,1577550153.0,"Yes I do actually, and it's irrelevant. What you're referring to is how many years have passed since the supposed start of the gregorian calendar. I'm referring to the technical decade amount which is 10 and is also kinda dumb since 2020 / 10 = 202 and it's the 203rd decade and doesn't change the fact it is a decade. Further more I was referring to a group of something, in this case years. Since ten years have passed, ten years have passed, and that's a decade, no matter where the counting starts. Furthermore, I don't know if you feel emboldened by googling something and taking a stand on a subject that even scientists debate but in either case, get over it or become a scientist and solve an age old question and become a Nobel Lauretae or keep trolling reddit with you google hands."
