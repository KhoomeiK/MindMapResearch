aww,fdw1gen,t3_en610b,1578754108.0,"My lab/golden/GSD mutt will get all the way under the covers, but leave her whole butt and tail out. She likes to think she’s hidden so I’ll just walk in and say, “huh, I wonder where Harley is.” And her whole butt wiggles as her tail slaps the bed. I let her stay “hidden” for a while before I pull the covers back and pretend I’m shocked. She loves it"
Wellthatsucks,fdl3bo1,t3_elum23,1578516343.0,"My old step brother once went to see if the automatic doors on the minivan could sense if someone was there, but this was before that technology was implemented. His arm made the loudest snapping sound. I feel like watching this just made me re-hear that sound"
legaladvice,fdf32pf,t1_fdeyffs,1578352187.0,I’m going to try that. But basically my mom and I have a joint account so she has access
legaladvice,fdf31df,t1_fdexcpu,1578352162.0,"1.) I was 19 when it happened and my mom never told me the process so I asked the doctor not my insurance. I now know to ask my insurance first and have done so since
2.) my insurance paid them because they lied to me. I’m not sure how it works, but basically the doctor took the billing directly to BCBS and they sent the money directly back instead of giving me a copay. I forgot the term for it but it’s when there’s a big amount that the patient can’t pay??
3.) it’s a joint account that my mom opened under my name when I was young. I can open another but I can’t transfer all my funds without my mom’s permission unless I slowly transfer a couple hundred a month"

aww,fdcgonx,t3_ekjfcu,1578274450.0,I used to have a cat named Cooper who absolutely loved his vet. Only cat I’ve ever seen to go running for the vet. He also liked belly rubs so idk maybe he was a dog stuck in a cat’s body
Weddingsunder10k,fd02y1s,t1_fd01byp,1578112856.0,"I’m considering a white sundress, or a dress I found at a bridal shop by me that’s only $140. As for the wedding itself, neither my fiancé nor I drink so we were thinking either dinner or late at night after dinner, when the sun goes down. I’ll look into borrowing chairs! I didn’t think of that."
WeightLossAdvice,fcymgp1,t1_fcylsw9,1578082742.0,"I do like swimming but it’s so cold and there’s no heated pools or indoor pools near me so I can do it until the summer. Swimming is what I usually do to relieve pain. And I’ve been on those bike machines! They’re good but most don’t fit my weight so I fall off on one side of the seat. They are fun, though. I’ll definitely get back to weight lifting, while sitting."

So the date is good for now. I’ll google the planner and organizer for sure and check that out! And I do have a Pinterest I’m just not sure how to use it lol. I’ll try to come up with a while printout of what I want and go based off that"
Weddingsunder10k,fcyhirj,t1_fcyh8ez,1578080248.0,"I have no preferences. I live in AZ. Just don’t know where weddings are usually held. I know churches are an option, just wouldn’t mind hearing other’s experiences with different types of venues"
Weddingsunder10k,fcyh4o5,t1_fcyfur2,1578080033.0,He said 50 people max and I would only invite 20 so that would work. But if there’s other options I wouldn’t mind it because I don’t get along well with my uncle’s husband

bettafish,fck22vz,t1_fcjh6b6,1577714238.0,"They might. It’s funny the most energetic and spastic fish seem to find the best friendship in the most slow paced and relaxed fish. My betta will get his zoomies, then finish it laid across the shell of a snail."
bettafish,fcj8xuz,t3_ehh324,1577680234.0,"Basically every time EscarDos goes under that plant, Bjørner will rush over and lay his fins across him and rest his head on EscarDos’s shell. It’s the cutest thing and they’ve done it for two months now but I’m not sure why. It’s every day"

Unexpected,fc39ir4,t1_fc2hw21,1577384730.0,"I had an old math teacher who was missing half of two of his fingers on his left hand. When he would count, he would say, “one, one and a half, two, three, and four.”

He lost them when working “with a big hammer” he never explained what that meant."
BPD,fbn0a30,t3_edt6bi,1576991037.0,"I denied my diagnoses for a whole year before a doctor who I was seeing briefly said, “you seem to just not know who you are.” Then it clicked and everything felt right. Like, you’re right, I don’t know who i am. I guess I do have BPD. It’s weird to think I denied such a huge part of me for so long, but it’s even weirder to think it’s a part of me"
