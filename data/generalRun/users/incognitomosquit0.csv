specializedtools,fej1m42,t1_feicke3,1579153615.0,"Ok, just cause I'm actually able to answer this question... There may be other reasons that I'm not aware of but one of the reasons why we did it is because we would order copies of police reports and those could include anything from reports, supplemental reports, booking photos, crime scene photos, call logs, etc. Most likely, the police reports would be page numbered, but the supplemental reports wouldn't be consecutively numbered and the photos or call logs definitely won't be consecutively numbered.  Let's say the defendant had multiple charges with different police agencies, well when you ordered reports from those other agencies they'll have their own set of numbers.  In Adobe I can create my own consecutive numbering system no matter the order I receive discovery, when I give that copy away, I can tell someone to refer to page 0042069 and everyone I've provided with bate stamping will know what page I'm referencing.  You might think, well why wouldn't I sort everything out by reports, then call logs, then photos... Well when your dealing with multiple departments and different time frames it's not always possible, so you just number them as you receive them.  Hope that helps"
