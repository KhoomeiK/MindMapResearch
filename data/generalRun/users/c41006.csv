RepTime,fe0axbf,t1_fe061q3,1578808173.0,To be honest I came to this sub out of curiosity. I always though primary purpose of  “replica” watches was to scam people out of their money but obviously there are a number of folks out there that buy them knowing full well that they are fake and that’s just something I’m trying to get a better understanding as to why.

RepTime,fdy5ply,t3_emu4mu,1578776389.0,"Personally I’ve always struggled to understand the point of rep (let’s be honest, fake) watches. 

I own nice watches for my own satisfaction and I couldn’t imagine looking at a rep on my wrist and actually being happy and satisfied with it knowing that it isn’t real. 

I’d rather have a real seiko than a fake Patek but that’s just me I guess."
