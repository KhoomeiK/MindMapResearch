Oh really? Wow, you have such a good vocabulary for a 7 year old. 

You don't need to know Henderson's life story to know what football club he played for before he came to Liverpool you utter cunt waffle. The fact that you thought he came through Liverpool's academy just screams ""I don't have a fucking clue what I'm talking about""

Nice little jab at Sunderland being in League One by the way, I would make a joke about your local club but I can't because I don't know who they are since you've decided to be a plastic bandwagoner who picks a really successful side like City to follow, even though they're probably 1000miles away from your home and you have no connection to the club whatsoever."

You find yourself in a narrow corridor where you can only move forward or backward with an undead archer firing at you from the other end. At the start of the corridor you pick up your first shield and if you don't equip you're going to get hit multiple times with arrows. This is a tutorial on how to block and that blocking costs stamina. 

Then you get on the ledge where you encounter two undead at once, this is the tutorial on dealing with multiple enemies which as you know is something you'll do a lot in this game. Then you're faced with a more aggressive undead with a shield and more HP, the tutorial on dealing with tougher enemies.
