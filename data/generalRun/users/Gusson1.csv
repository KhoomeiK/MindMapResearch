brasilivre,ffa3qe4,t1_ffa3con,1579727283.0,Entendo seu posicionamento. N√£o  tenho conhecimento suficiente  em infectologia para argumentar sobre cont√°gio. Esse tipo de situa√ß√£o √© bem delicado. Espero que a China trate do assunto com muito cuidado para que as pessoas possam ter sua vida de volta assim que poss√≠vel.

brasilivre,ffa1lx0,t1_ff9xuym,1579726058.0,"Com todo o respeito. Compreendo o sacrif√≠cio em prol do bem maior, acho louvavel. Mas neste caso espec√≠fico est√° fora do razo√°vel. S√£o 17 casos, e est√£o impedindo um dos direitos mais fundamentais do homem, que √© o de ir e vir. √â literalmente 0,0002% (17√∑milh√µes).

Concorda que a conten√ß√£o est√° desproporcional? √â como usar uma bazuca para matar uma barata."
brasilivre,ff9wy3c,t3_esh7s2,1579723304.0,"N√£o sei se o OP est√° sendo sarc√°stico ou n√£o. Mas acho completamente absurdo cassar o direito de ir e vir de 11 milh√µes de pessoas por conta de 17.

Totalmente desproporcional e possivelmente uma ferramenta pol√≠tica de manobra de poder."
brasil,ff5pwtg,t3_erm0ul,1579605339.0,"√â muito interessante esse contraste. A internet √© muito jovem, tem uns 25 anos no Brasil. Esses cursos online e youtube menos ainda. Ningu√©m pensava que isso poderia acontecer, na minha inf√¢ncia os professores falavam que n√£o se podia acreditar em nada que fosse da internet porque n√£o sab√≠amos quem tinha postado e se a pessoa sabia o que dizia.
Hoje o conhecimento est√° acess√≠vel facilmente para quem tem acesso a net(que n√£o √© todo mundo) e a din√¢mica das coisas mudou completamente."

raisedbynarcissists,femmbn4,t3_epz6uq,1579262400.0,Use your savings to get medical help. Cure this depression and the suicidal thoughts. No better way to spend it.
unpopularopinion,fek4d4y,t3_epl6d0,1579192348.0,"People who do this, in my opinion, have very little self-esteem, so they need constant validation from strangers in the web. Specially if they are hooked to this apps and don't have anything else meaningful happening in their lives.

So I just feel sorry for then."

That's the difference."
unpopularopinion,fef4mud,t1_fef472m,1579048070.0,"What a coincidence, I'm also from Brazil, I learned the little Esperanto i know in S√£o Paulo, started in a school, but I couldn't keep attending so I switched to online, now I mostly use Duolingo. I'm still very basic in it."
brasil,fef3h1m,t3_eotuh1,1579047290.0,Ela esta precisando de umas aulas de macroeconomia e com√©rcio internacional. Fora a defini√ß√£o de escravo. Essa afirma√ß√£o dela n√£o se sustenta.
unpopularopinion,fef346c,t3_eotw27,1579047050.0,"I think this wouldn't work. Probably family and friends won't respect this are go avenge the late one.

Also, many people would just murder others and fake the duel thing to escape prison.

Dueling is done upon horon, and most people have none of it. Just rage."
family,fef2puv,t3_eotw8o,1579046781.0,"It seems that you care about then more than they care about you.

I'm sorry OP, but I advise you to not try to ""gain"" their attention. If they choose to be absent in the important momentsof your life, respect their choice and seek people that appreciate you.

Family sometimes disappoints us, but if you have good friends, you can happy as hell and ignore your parents cold shoulders.

Wish you luck!!!"
unpopularopinion,fef1p30,t1_fef09su,1579046099.0,"I think you misunderstood me, when I said nobody spoke it, I meant to say it's a very small crowd (me included) compared to the rest of the world. Sorry for the exaggeration.

English is not the easiest to learn, I don't really like it. But in a practical manner, I believe is easier to teach the non english speaker english, than the other way around.

On a side note, the same would be applicable to Mandarin, except I've tried to learn it and found impossible.

Esperanto is a dream, I'd it worked would be great, but let's be honest, it turned to be a awesome international community to make part of, but I don't see it becoming the one language spoken by all."
unpopularopinion,feez0f2,t3_eote6p,1579044338.0,"Unfortunately, there's no universal language. Esperanto was created with this mind but never really worked, since almost nobody speaks it now. English never promised to be this type of universal language, it just became largely spoke because England dominated the world expansion for centuries and the USA is now a important international business player. but instead of creating a new one and have everybody to learn it. English is the most spoken language in the world other than maybe Mandarin. it's easier for the people who doesn't speak it to learn it then to teach other language to everybody. I learned English as my third language, and even though is my least favorite, I think if everybody learned, we could just go from there."
brasilivre,feedufq,t3_eoktvo,1579031714.0,"O que ferra √© que o cara paga o mesmo valor de imposto sobre o sal√°rio do que sal√°rio para o funcion√°rio.

Se o cara ganha mil reais, a empresa paga mil para ele e  mais mil de imposto.

Por isso √© t√£o grande a informalidade e a pejotiza√ß√£o, o cara ganha mal mas sai caro mesmo assim.

O ideal seria colocar mais dinheiro no bolso do trabalhado e menos no da Uni√£o."

niceguys,fedrdqb,t1_fedofg7,1579018251.0,"You're right, everyone is picky. Specially because the premise of this apps is to choose someone just by looking at the pic and 2 lines of info.
So, it's obvious that good looking people will be chosen way more frequently, that's the single thing you're presented with."

Ficar constantemente com medo no tr√¢nsito ser atingido por uma bala perdida de uma briga em lugar pr√≥ximo, essas coisas.

Os Brasileiros em geral n√£o tem responsabilidade o suficiente para ter uma arma."
