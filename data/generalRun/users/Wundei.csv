If you read [this](https://theintercept.com/2019/09/25/i-wrote-about-the-bidens-and-ukraine-years-ago-then-the-right-wing-spin-machine-turned-the-story-upside-down/) article from *The Intercept* and weigh it against the statement from the call transcripts above it seems to me that both Left and Right partisans have read what they wanted to hear from the events...but compounded by the fact that once it became clear how this situation would be spun the Admin tried to cover their tracks.

I don't like Biden and am glad Bernie is about to surpass him. However, testimony about how much the hold on aid hurt the Ukrainians would be a *lot* more convincing coming from Ukrainians. I'm sure the GOP Senators will vote with the party stance, just saying that the trial so far hasn't gotten me *more* certain of impeachment.

I'll be honest, at risk of *extreme* downvoting, I care less about the actual impeachment items of the trial after hearing the ""impassioned"" arguments of the opening day. Go ahead and hang me in the streets, but getting lethal aid to Ukraine would have been way more helpful a couple/few years ago rather than making a delay in sending trainers and lethal gear sound like it caused harm to *US National Security*.

[This](https://www.cfr.org/interactive/global-conflict-tracker/conflict/conflict-ukraine) website points out that NATO moved troops into the area as a show of force and seems to portray the conflict as having slowed down since 2018.

From War in the Donbass wiki; 
""On 26 March 2018 the Trilateral Contact Group on Ukraine agreed on a ""comprehensive, sustainable and unlimited ceasefire"" that was to start on 30 March 2018.[464] It collapsed on its first day.[464]

On 30 April 2018 Ukraine replaced the name ""Anti-Terrorist Operation"" (ATO) with ""Joint Forces Operation"" (JFO).[465][466][467][468][469][466][470][471]

On 30 April 2018 the United States confirmed that it had delivered Javelin anti-tank missiles to Ukraine.[472] Reportedly they will be used only in case of an all-out separatist assault.[473]""

So IMHO, the most important time to ""support our friends fighting foxholes"" would have been anytime between 2014 and the end of 2017, and according to the wiki we had already sent lethal aid prior to the lethal aid being argued about from June 2018. 

The cover-up is more damning than the delay in aid, due to the time period it occurred, is all I'm saying. Let the downvotes rain upon me."

IMO, armed citizens on the ""militia"" level are more applicable as unpaid deputies in a collapse of law enforcement rather than foreign invasion. However, during a foreign invasion scenario armed citizens would be valuable 3rd-4th string personnel. Conflict areas like Afghanistan show the potential a bunch of people with rifles can enact.

Thats why this event is such a huge mistake. Basically, its like no one spent any time verifying the target before firing...or didn't have the technology to verify.
