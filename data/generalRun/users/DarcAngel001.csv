RedDeadOnline,fede9pw,t3_eojhhw,1579009105.0,"If you like the BIG Horses you should check out the Moonshine Lvl 20 Norfolk Roadster... 2nd in size to the Shire, lots of health and 10 out of 10 for speed and 9 out of 10 for acceleration, can get you out of trouble faster than you can get into it.

But as some others have said... Get what you like, my roadster i use for collecting or when i need to get somewhere fast, and for just wandering i have my Shire B.o.B.  (Big ornery Bastard) although i will occasionally use him for racing, you can use a Shire to push other horses out of your way and the ***Butt Slide Smash*** is Devastating to others. LoL."

RedDeadOnline,fe6t8dr,t3_eo1bhe,1578904338.0,"That's one of the reasons I love this game... the community. I've had unexpected escorts help me on delivery runs, players putting 3 star Bucks on my horse and one of my favorites was during a  collector run I had a group of 4 players head my way... to show I meant no harm I started a dance emote, they all got off their horses and started dancing also.

RedDeadOnline,fddm4tc,t3_ektxls,1578317437.0,"Unless you are really hurting for money, probably not... Disconnects and other players with nothing to do are a threat... however if you need exp for trader do the local delivery with 100 goods for the money then when you get back to your camp do a long distance with just a couple of goods in the wagon and you'll get a really good amount of exp... local or long distance you can do with just a couple of goods for exp.

That was how I leveled up my trader in a few days.

PS... You can also take the wagon and run it off a smallish cliff and destroy the wagon, call your Horse and put the goods on its back if you HATE driving the carts. This can be done with anywhere between 1 and 24 goods."
