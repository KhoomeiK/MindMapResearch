dogs,fetsp0j,t1_fesq1d1,1579379608.0,"Lol I agree. My big black pupper girl is terrified of MICE and BABIES, it's adorable. She lets the cat walk up to her food bowl for a bite to eat, too."
dogs,fdrszvo,t3_emnqy7,1578689290.0,"I call my dog pickle butt. It just kind of happened.

I also call her Louis, or Lou. HER name is Pip, so I have no idea how that happened."
dogs,fcokeeq,t3_eia2x3,1577834445.0,"Forewarning, I have an epileptic dog so I tend to worry about that more than most.. but what you described sounds just like what I've seen my dog do after a very small seizure. 

It's probably not very likely, but I would definitely keep a closer eye on her to see if it continues. Epilepsy is actually pretty common in labs (mine's a black lab), and 5 is a normal age for it to start presenting."
dogs,fcoj2i0,t1_fco4uc1,1577833463.0,"Thank you, I hadn't thought of using her crate! It's really big and would definitely be a 2-person job, but that's a great option to keep tucked away for times when I'm not alone."
dogs,fcoiwhk,t1_fcoc81l,1577833339.0,"Thank you! That's a really good idea, I hadn't even thought of talking to her neurologist about it. It seems really obvious now! I appreciate your advice :) I think I will call the ER now just to ask about it."
dogs,fco1j2b,t3_ei7fk9,1577822395.0,"I had a dog who did this as a nervous habit, he would lick his paws until they were raw, for no apparent reason. He also had separation anxiety issues and was... let's just say, a little bit neurotic. He ended up on xanax lol but it really helped him."
dogs,fco0bxf,t3_ei7oav,1577821790.0,"When I brought my dog home from the shelter, she had patchy fur like that, too, and was constantly scratching certain areas. Turns out it was a type of mange and was treated by medicated baths once a week for.. a month, if I remember correctly. I hope it's the same for you, because it wasn't a big deal or indicative of any bigger health issues. Good luck, and update us!"
AskVet,fcm5onw,t1_fcm55a8,1577764893.0,"Unfortunately, multiple partial seizures in a day is pretty normal for her - she cycles through ""good"" periods and ""bad"" ones, like this. If they were grand mals, she would be in the ER for sure - but she has a neurologist and he knows about this, it's about as controlled as we can get her :("
