Life is tough sometimes, but realising that we are little specs of dust in a vast universe helps us realise how little these problems we face are, and allows us to approach them with a little less seriousness. 
Try not to take the earth so seriously and shift your focus from the negative things to the positive things in life - like nature, books, inspirational movies, music, coffee, tea, snacks, the stars. 


For this month, try to take a run for 30 mins a day, try some guided mindfulness practice like Jon Kabat Zinn's videos on YouTube, and cut sugar out of your diet as much as possible, be sure to get 7-8 hours of sleep daily. These four things: diet, exercise, mindfulness, and sleep might change things for you significantly. So just try it for a month or two. You've got nothing to lose. 

I'd like to make a recommendation to see a doctor, psychiatrist, or psychologist. There are ones you can see free of charge in clinics."
offmychest,fc2nf48,t3_efr2ky,1577368084.0,"Psychiatry is beautiful... Sometimes mental disorders need to be addressed on a physical level, and psychiatrists are qualified to identify the cause of your issues as well as which approach will be most effective for your treatment. Sometimes that's psychotherapy, sometimes it's medicinal therapy. Sometimes it's a combination. 

People have no place telling you what you should or should not be doing to take control of your mental health, unless they are qualified mental health practitioners. Next time, tell them to get qualified before offering you their opinions. 

(Note, I aspire to become a psychiatrist and I'm really glad to see it's made a difference in your life. This is the very reason I'm going into it.)

Edit: replaced ""qualified psychiatrists"" with ""qualified mental health practitioners"" to include psychologists, social workers and therapists ;)"
