Seriously, this sounds like a wonderful idea on paper - giving people the freedom to do whatever they want with the programs that they use every day. But in practice, this would do one of two things.

1. Force every user to create their own menu and control schema for every piece of software that they came across - a process which takes a very long time if well thought out and done with intention - because there wouldn't be one by default. Or...
2. Force every program to be infinitely adaptable to any navigational choice the users wanted to make. And since everything has to be accessible from everywhere regardless of where it was at the default, things have to be scattered all over the place with the capability of going even more places.

What you're gonna want to do is remove the bottom of the toaster where the crumb tray slides out for cleaning, then unscrew the bottom of the appliance so that a piece of bread can pass all the way through it. Pick a slot to use as your display device - left slot or right slot. Carefully unwind the nichrome wires from the other slot and plug them into your motherboard's PCI-e slot.

Take the ends of the power cable (you did unplug the power cable first, right? If not... do that now, assuming you aren't dead) and melt them down with the heat off your stovetop or processor, whichever is more convenient, and fashion the hot slag into a rough approximation of a DisplayPort plug. Jam it into the display out real good before it hardens to ensure good conductivity.

Finally place the toaster in front of one of the case fans on the PC to create a current of moving air and load the first loaf of bread into the slot. Depress the lever to turn the toaster on. The fan will push bread through and the image from on screen will be burned onto the bread.

An average loaf of Wonder bread contains 20 slices of bread and the game most likely runs at 60 FPS so for a one-hour play session, you will require 10,800 loaves of bread. Pricing them at Target's website, this will cost you $19,322, but you might be able to order them cheaper directly from the factory.

My friend's wife had similar issues with the school she went to when she was a kid - inaccessible spaces, a ramp that was too steep, etc. This wasn't malicious, it was just a very old building that had been built long before anyone had ever thought of powerchairs being a thing. She told me they sent her parents a letter suggesting an alternate school a little further away that was fully accessible because renovating their school was going to cost $125,000 that the district didn't have. Having renovated our own home to meet my dad's needs and watching the cost skyrocket just for a couple rooms, I have no trouble believing that. So that informs my perspective somewhat. 

But when I said as much, I asked her, ""I'm not trying to be discriminatory, and I'm not saying you don't have a right to be there as much as anyone else, but if a project costs $X and someone just *does not have that amount of money*, what are they supposed to do? They can't just generate it from nowhere even though they have a duty to be compliant. No matter how much you yell at them or threaten to sue, it won't change the fact that they can't afford to do the work."" I hadn't realized - and a lot of people probably don't - that there are programs and grants out there to cover those costs - but they have to be applied for.

However, I *also* know that Amtrak has been losing money hand over fist for years and that their service is kind of terrible because of it.

Let's take Amtrak at their word for now, that it really does cost this much to make the modifications. I understand not being willing to run the business at a loss that significant if that's the case. But if I were in customer service, I'd have offered a  compromise. The article says Amtrak suggested alternate travel arrangements but...

>All of the riders want to be on the 7 a.m. train. That is the first train in the morning. The next train, a few hours later, would mean getting in late for the conference. Going the night before would add the expense of staying in a hotel.

Getting people to their event late is not acceptable. But what about offering to pay for a night in a hotel and a per diem for food for some of the passengers, so they could take an earlier train? That would have cost Amtrak less than $500 - far less than $25,000 - as well as being an excellent showing of goodwill, and most importantly not come close to trying to slap a consumer with an exorbitant bill 1500x more expensive than what other passenger are paying, which is absolutely insulting. 

If the cost of reconfiguring the train really is that high then I can understand not wanting to incur that cost, but that's no reason not to strive to provide excellent customer service at all times. The customer is not ""always right,"" but they're always the customer.

doctorwho,fe6m8cu,t3_ensr3s,1578895678.0,"Here are my thoughts, mostly out of order.

1. If I had to guess, I would assume that this episode was written backwards. The author started with the mouthful they wanted to get into The Doctor's mouth right in the speech at the end, and then thought, ""Right, how do I get there?"" And the thing is, that's not necessarily bad. I thought it was pretty good, actually, but it would have been more poignant if the rest of the episode had felt *tense* instead of frenzied. Eliminating a couple of the extraneous plotlines - like the kid running away, the computer virus, the revenge-minded daughter, and running out of teleport power - and reducing the number of dregs to a handful that could be anywhere at any time because they stalked them like the raptors in *Jurassic Park* would have done that pretty well. Then at the end everyone feels unsettled, uneasy, and shaken, and the speech doesn't make anyone feel better, but it reminds them that there's hope.
2. The reveal partway through was actually the one that felt more heavy-handed to me. When they're moving the vending machine and asking how Earth got this way and The Doctor is almost looking into the camera to say that all the scientists were warning about this, and Yaz drops the climate change rundown. There's a blog I used to read where the author re-read the old *Goosebumps* books that they read as a kid, and said that one segment, ""exists because only there is not yet technology in place that allows RL Stine to simply come up behind the reader and hit him or her in the back of the head."" Seems the same is going on here.
3. One thing I don't mind is the effect on the timeline. In the second episode of the new series with the 9th Doctor, he referred to some of the same things. Everyone evacuating the planet? Check. A super-wealthy group of people having an influence over the planet? Check. Terraforming of the Earth mainly based on money, wealth, and power  (""I thought the continents shifted and things."" / ""They did. And the Trust shifted 'em back. But now the money's run out, nature takes its course."")? Check. So, this actually fits in pretty well with the lore we've seen. Except for the fact that for some reason the TARDIS doesn't translate Russian subway signs.
4. That little moment at the beginning about the Doctor's sour mood was only a second but hey, that was well done. I liked it! And I think I see what they're going for, too - trying to in some small way let the companions have a taste of what The Doctor is experiencing once the reveal about Gallifrey comes about. Which... is unique, actually. Rose, Martha, Donna, Amy, Rory, Clara... none of them ever had the sinking feeling of standing amongst the ruined remains of their own world when they were doing the Last of the Time Lords plot thread. Maybe this group will at least have a chance of understanding what The Doc is going through. It's interesting, but I am not sure if it's intentional or just an aftereffect of the soapbox the author wanted to stand on.

All in all I didn't love it but I at least see what they were going for. Not one I'll be rewatching often but not outright offensive. It just sort of existed and took up space. I'd say a 4 out of 10."

They were surprisingly illuminating describing the different things the candidates said and the ways they were spun. For example a candidate for mayor would say they would pass a law, and the anchors would pause and say, ""This is not within the mayor's purview. The city council passes these laws. But the mayor can issue an executive order directing the council to consider these factors.""

A research team ran an experiment by intentionally publishing a paper with a small sample size and lax testing methods in a couple journals. It was reported by the Huffington Post, Shape Magazine, and many others.

> There was one glint of hope in this tragicomedy. While the reporters just regurgitated our “findings,” many readers were thoughtful and skeptical. In the online comments, they posed questions that the reporters should have asked.

This is supposed to be, and used to be, a journalist’s job, to question and fact check what they publish before they actually publish it. The onus shouldn’t fall to the reader.

In another case that’s not of any kind of importance, but illustrates the point just as well, in mid-December you could find articles all over the Internet that, as far as I can tell, originated at IGN, all saying, “‘Star Wars Rise Of Skywalker’ is already on track to becoming one of the most popular and successful films of all time.” Well, the box office numbers are coming in and that’s turned out to have been nothing but hype. Curiously, exact phrase matches for this exact headline produce no results anymore, but you can still find screenshots in YouTube videos and on Twitter.

What I’m describing to you is a technical limitation due to the way mail servers work, and the way business interact with each other. How *exactly* is one supposed to force IBM Silverpop to stop their outbound queue and delete the messages that their server has already received and queued for delivery when they aren’t willing to do that, inconveniencing every other customer who is sending email from the same shared mail server? What step by step process should one follow? Walk me through it. 

I know what you want to accomplish and I don’t disagree that it should be easier. If every company had the tools in house to do their own e-mail marketing that would eliminate most of the issues, because the senders would retain control of the outbound mail queue. But many do not. What I’m describing is the market that exists in the real world right now and the real, technical limitations that also exist.

On more than one occasion I dealt with people who had accidentally pushed a message with a typo and wanted to recall it. The messages were enqueued for delivery across 48 hours along with all the other messages of the 3rd party’s other customers - millions and millions of emails. Basically the response was, “I’m sorry. The emails are gone and will be delivered.” The only way the message processor could have stopped them would have been to stop processing the entire outbound mail queue long enough to sort out that single customer’s messages and remove them, and they were unwilling to do so."

One, they'll flood their own mail server, and two, receiving services like Gmail, Microsoft, etc. may consider a sender dumping 100,000 messages in a second suspicious and flag them as a spammer. They have no way of knowing the mail is wanted, and they have no way of knowing its content.

So, a great many of these companies set up automated campaigns, that will deliver messages in batches of 1000 at all hours of the day and night over the course of several days. Once the sending process is started, it can't be stopped any more than you can pull an individual envelope back after you already dropped it in the mailbox. The reason a business is allowed 10 days is because you may be in the pipeline already to receive more messages that were already sent, and there is nothing they can do about it, but they certainly better not send you any more."

I kid of course, everybody is entitled to an opinion and exactly, I feel like often, people are just in here to argue. Hell, I’ll admit it, sometimes I just want to debate someone about something so I’ll go searching for opposing views on purpose just so I can have a conversation with the other person about them."

WHAT THE HELL was this conversation about?!

And hand-in-hand with this, the people who cowardly delete comments on a regular basis, especially because they're dropping -20 or below. You said a stupid thing, take your punishment! I've said a couple dumb ones but I leave them up.

Saw someone at like -15 for a bad security practice at a company where they were just a frontline helpdesk employee answering phones, and they didn't even work there anymore. Jumped in and said, ""Hey folks does this person really deserve to be downvoted into oblivion for this?"" Apparently people agreed because it had a positive score later in the day."

television,fdh68cx,t1_fdgp232,1578416259.0,"Fun fact, the books are actually the first adaptation. The story started it's life on the radio as an audio drama. It lasted 2 series  - episodes 1-6 of series 1 are basically books 1 and 2 and 1-6 of series 2 are a new story you've never read in the books (I think? Maybe book 2 is partly Series 2 as well, it's been a while), though some elements are recycled and will be familiar.

Then after Adams died, all the surviving actors returned and made books 3-5 into audio dramas as well. I think their treatment of *Life, The Universe, and Everything* was some of the best listening ever."
television,fdh5hzf,t1_fdh2glc,1578415812.0,"> It was totally consistent in its inconsistency.

It wasn't the inconsistencies that ruined it for me, because you're right - every time it gets re-adapted, it changes. I started with the books, but then when I found out it had been OTR first, I had to get my hands on a copy (not easy as I was in the US, 16, and it was 2003 at the time). I've always had a love for OTR and I love that podcasts have basically brought the artform back now. The radio show goes completely off the rails from both the books and the movie and contains a plotline I hadn't ever known about so it was a ton of fun!

So when the movie came out right when I graduated high school I was excited about it. But it was a letdown for me not because they changed the plot - restarting the Earth from when it was destroyed or introducing the POV gun, or anything like that. It was that they'd taken the Adams-ness out of the story. The major plot beats were there, sure, and the commentary on bureaucracy and the uselessness of red tape and government agencies. But the joy of Adams' writing, whether through the novels or the narration, was in the terrible things he did to the English language.

Gone were the descriptions of the Vogon fleet: ""Huge as office blocks, silent as birds, they hung in the air in exactly the same way that bricks don't."" That's technically a simile but it'd make any English teacher shake their head wondering where their life went so wrong, and yet it conjures a perfect mental image.

And most of the rest of the time, this just resulted in the set-up for a joke being there, but the punchline being absent. ""What would you say if I told you I'm not from Guilford after all, but from a small planet somewhere in the vicinity of Betelgeuse?"" Ford asks in the pub at the beginning. Arthur's bewildered reply of, ""I don't know..."" is all we get in the movie, which falls flat without the rest of the sentence, ""...why? Do you think it's the sort of thing you're likely to say?"""
