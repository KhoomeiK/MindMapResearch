That build quality is usually apparent throughout the rest of the product - cheaper buttons, more limited brightness range, lower quality pixel controllers (more dead pixels earlier in the Display’s lifecycle), cheaper display ports that fail sooner, etc.

worldnews,ffc0buf,t1_ffbccnx,1579788260.0,"That’s true, but people who don’t donate to charity due to their own financial risks don’t waddle around boasting “this is why I don’t donate to charities”, they just don’t say anything because of the social shame we ascribe to financial insecurity or lack of leisure wealth.

Anyone saying “this is why I don’t...” is implying that they *could* donate to charities, but *choose* not to because they’re some big brained 400 IQ, smarter than everyone else, and *they* **know** *that charities aren’t actually helping people* /s

Orgs like the Susan G Komondor foundation who have been shown to be untrustworthy with the donations they receive have pissed all over the good name that charities used to enjoy.  Any large retail store asking for charity donations at checkout should t be trusted because those companies make a donation commitment (they say - we’ll donate up to $20M at the end of 2020, funded by customer contributions), but they keep every dollar beyond the $20M that customers give them, and the company takes the tax write off for the donation, so it’s ultimately a revenue generating/tax averting program that these stores run.  Aside from the few bad apples and for-profit companies co-opting their customer’s altruism, nearly all real charities genuinely strive for their stated goals and are worthy of donations.  

Just like teachers and fire fighters and civil servants - no one goes to work for a charity with the goal of making lots of money (because that’s not how you make lots of personal money).  People start up and go to work for charities because they want to do great things for other people, their communities, our planet, and humanity."

No, it doesn’t.  There is absolutely nothing about special characters, numbers, upper, or lower case characters in a password that makes it harder to crack.  

First, password compromise doesn’t happen through cryptographic deconstruction.  No one brute forces passwords, it’s not even remotely efficient.  The primary vector for password compromise is phishing attacks.  

Second, if you’re the victim of the worst cyber criminal in history, AND you are using sites without max number of password fails before locking the account, even THEN the additional character types in your password don’t enhance the password’s entropy.

funny,fe4008y,t1_fe3ol6w,1578854499.0,"Door-to-door sales operations are not nearly as professional as you describe.  Most of these outfits are pyramid schemes or outright scams targeting lower income households.  D2D sales is the **least efficient sales model**, requiring the greatest number of sales people to access potential customers slower than any other sales model.  Since you need more salespeople, you have to pay your salespeople next to nothing for a base salary (or alternatively you run a pyramid scheme where there is no salary).  Since the guaranteed income is unlivable, you end up with the lowest credentialed employees.  Since these people have to physically walk door to door, the rate that they engage in conversations or direct engagements is lower than phone-based sales, email-based sales, or even mall kiosks.  So why do businesses continue to launch an army of foot soldiers out into residential neighborhoods to ring doorbells?

There are 2 very good reasons to use D2D sales models.  First, you end up reducing the auditable records associated with any transaction - nothing the salesperson has said or done is recorded in a way that could serve as evidence in a court of law (aside from ring alarms etc.).  This reduces the accountability of the salespeople and the business in general since someone who buys based on lies can’t sue.  Second, you get to leverage conman-style persuasive tactics that work in a face to face conversation that don’t work over the phone or digitally (up to and including pretending to be a student who needs money for college, using social attention to get old people to sign up for services where they think they’re signing a petition, etc.).

If someone is selling door-to-door, they’re doing so because their business model doesn’t work when there’s a digital record of what their salespeople are saying to prospective customers, or they can’t get people to agree to sign up/buy based on the quality/value of their goods or services.  

Make no mistake - political campaigning is totally different.  D2D is **the best way** to engage a voting population to increase the likelihood of votes for your candidate, so if you’re coming from a political perspective, none of the above applies.  

TL;DR - if someone is selling you something at your door, it’s not because they have to, it’s because it gives their business a worthwhile advantage in generating revenue, and none of those advantages are ethically sound."

Ready Player One, and the recent Jumani films are the only films that leverage video games as a center point of the plot that weren’t based on existing video games.  Assassin’s Creed is a good example of a “video game” movie that is based on an existing game franchise."

OSHA,fdfh2jp,t1_fdf38sh,1578361527.0,"That desk is made out of particle board or recycled beer cans, that thing isn’t designed to hold anything but lunch and a laptop.  What the above commenter is saying with regard to “continuous load” - that shelf might sustain the weight of the man and the ladder initially, but it’s not actually rated for that much weight, so the fasteners holding that rickety ass shit together will start to give way, if the person on the desk moves suddenly, it can create a shear force that will tear that desk right off the wall.  The force you exert on something when you’re not moving is equal to your mass times the acceleration of gravity, once you start moving, it’s way, way more.

TL;DR - you can physically stand on something even if it’s not safe to stand on it, and just because it holds for a minute doesn’t mean it will hold for 10 minutes."

Game developers are terrified of having their bosses “solved” by players.  It’s a huge problem in game design - instead of making bosses objectively difficult (requiring attentive movement, meaningful strategic and tactical decision making, risk-reward, responding to unpredictability, etc.) developers simply slap on a couple of invulnerability phases, transition into bullet hell mode, gear check the player for tankiness , and then return to the same sluggish, unchallenging, gear checking the player for damage phase."
