FulfillmentByAmazon,ffffotn,t3_etavs8,1579882950.0,TL;DR: Search terms are what the customer actually searches. Keywords are what you add to your listings that gets your product showing up in relavant search results. **PPC** keywords bridge the gap between the keywords used in your listing and the infinite combinations of search terms the customer might use.

I think you just answered your own question:

> I'm convinced, but I also know, that somebody who works for amazon in China is [...] charging a service fee to provide them to the Chinese sellers.

Amazon has let the wolves into the henhouse in their attempt to tap into the profits that come from enabling international sellers. Seems like they need to do a much better job of vetting and monitoring their foreign support agents because there are literally services out there selling insider access for much cheaper then you would think it would cost."

The laptop/desktop blocking is actually significantly higher than mobile, likely around 45% by now. Global ad block usage is slightly lower than the US but not by much. They also have sponsored product ad-blockers now

TL;DR: reddit's demographic probably has 50-60% ad block usage - not surprising given that reddit ads suck and they are pushing reddit coins so hard
