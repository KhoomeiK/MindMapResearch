Probably far more than most individuals could muster. People create corporations as an abstraction layer between themselves and their business. This gives a bunch of advantages, and so in my opinion it should also come with many restrictions, such as on political speech."
politics,ff43j2y,t1_ff39ttw,1579554753.0,"The way I heard it is that political spending is part of the protected free speech rights of corporate citizens. And that is why spending was deregulated. Correct me if im wrong.

Edit: I read more about this decision to refresh my memory and yes, it says that Corporations and other entities can donate unlimited money for independent expenditures after the decision. Allows the formation of Super PACs. Overall a terrible idea, but I do understand why the courts ruled that way, given that corporations previously had first amendment rights. Which in and of itself is a recipe for disaster."

> “An informed source at the Islamic Revolution Guards Corps said over 80 American troops were killed and some 200 wounded in the IRGC’s missile strikes on the US airbase of Ain al-Assad in Anbar province in western Iraq,” Mehr News reported on Wednesday.
The US said Wednesday that while damage assessments were still underway, there were no reports of US casualties from the strike. The Iraqi army, too, said Wednesday that no Iraqi soldiers were hurt in the assault, which followed the US killing on Friday of one of the IRGC’s top commanders, Quds Force chief Qassem Soleimani.
