Advice,ff098fa,t3_eqt3rf,1579466574.0,"I recently blocked a person I had been friends with since childhood (5th-6th grade). I think people change, and it's ok (if not a good idea) to reevaluate whether you want that person in your life. In my case this person had moved away from the mutual activities that we used to enjoy (video games) as have I. We didn't have a whole lot in common anymore. Then when they did some things that were detrimental to my health, without thinking of how it affected either of us, I chose to cut them out of my life, permanently (at least for now). My motto has been, no amount of good in the past justifies harm in the present. We did a lot for each other growing up, but that doesn't mean I should tolerate abuse in the now.

Advice,ff07ypj,t3_eqsdm2,1579466181.0,"I think a lot of people have echoed the same sentiments, but I understand how you feel; I felt hugely intimidated by the idea of being away from home, going to college, not having time to do the things I used to enjoy, etc when I was in my teens. But one thing built on another; each year I felt more ready for the next, and it turned out that a lot of those things that I feared would go away I found that I actually had the choice to keep or get rid of. There's some freedom that comes with moving into adulthood, and there are so many like minded individuals out there for any given activity. 

&#x200B;

Stick to what you love, be yourself, it may be difficult at times but if it makes you happy that's all that matters, I would wager there's nothing off limits for doing as an adult as long as it isn't hurting anyone. It's only the name that might change, eg scavenger hunts become geocaching, Pokemon Go, etc. etc."
