BacktotheFuture,fdgpjm1,t1_fdft869,1578404903.0,"It's a long story, and there's a few versions of exactly what happened out there. Here a few of the bigger things that happened.

He had issues on the set of the first one, with a bigger one being a disagreement about the end of the film. Crispin has spoken about that in a few interviews you can find on YouTube.

When it came to doing the sequel, Bob Gale said Crispin wanted too much money, but Crispin says that isn't true at all. If I remember correctly, he thinks it was things like arguing about the ending of the first film that led to him not being cast. On top of that- they used molds of his face from the first movie to make prosthetics for a new actor to take on his role. They stole his likeness- he sued and won. He was right to be pissed off about that. 

Crispin did work with Robert Zemeckis one more time on Beowulf, so it appears most of his anger is only towards Bob Gale at this point."

Hue,fc9tgk6,t3_ecikfy,1577557972.0,"Looks like a cool project. Something I think could take this to another level is scripted sequences.

For example, at the Battle of Yavin in the original Star Wars, the ships engines and planet are red, but until they are on screen, it doesn't change the light color. It'd be neat to have the lights change in anticipation of them coming into view.

Obviously, it'd be tedious to do a whole movie, and there are many times what is automatically done is just fine.. so maybe there would be a way to have the script written to a file (what the box is doing automatically) as you watch the movie, then you could edit the effects as you see fit.

The only thing I wonder is how you initially sync it."
