Foodforthought,ff36t8m,t1_ff3383f,1579535059.0,"Interesting that you bring this up because I came to comment on a tangential topic. Years ago, as a young, intellectually curious person, I began looking at competing flavors of theology to decide if I was raised in the right camp. Eschatology is one of the more interesting topics, and there are many interpretations. Ultimately, my search for truth led to an uncomfortable realization that there was absolutely no agreement about virtually anything among all the denominations about this purportedly God sent text we call the Bible.    
     
 Christian theology is, itself, a zone flooded with shit, enough to make you conclude as I did that there wasn't actually anything there worth looking for, after all.  And it's not flooded with shit deliberately. The protestants did it to themselves by asserting that regular people, not just priests, should have familiarity with the texts. The result is a splintering into hundreds of denominations, all at odds with one another over minor and major interpretations. Here we are, now, with the priesthood of the traditional newspapers and networks called into question, and the people are all at odds with one another to try to interpret truth from tweets and blogs and sound bites.   
    
Tl;dr:  Our political predicament is an echo of the protestant reformation."

Suppose a wife and husband have an illegal immigrant as a housekeeper, and they treat her poorly and pay her very little. The husband says, ""Look, we're not going to keep doing this. We're going to pay her well and help her get her citizenship, which means you are going to have to do more of the work around the house.""  The wife says, ""Screw this, I'm leaving you and taking the housekeeper with me."" 
   
Not a perfect analogy, but close enough. Next, the husband locks the doors of the house and refuses to let the wife leave. OK, is that the right answer? Even if it is, what's his motivation? He may be right about the housekeeper's situation but still be acting selfishly, only making a stand because he doesn't want to be left doing all the house work, himself. 
   
Someone correct me if I'm wrong, but our country took a big turn when the federal government asserted this big move in keeping the states from seceeding.  It's interesting what's going on with marijuana laws right now, and I think it's a good thing that we have the states making their way more locally. Note that the federal government isn't swooping in because it's not affecting things economically in a negative way, even though many, many people think ""drugs are bad"" is just as plain as ""slavery is bad"".

I don't have the link at hand, but I recently read an article by a group that actively catches online predators by posing as young girls. With alarming regularity, they could post something simple on instagram and start getting messages from weirdos saying they're pretty, going into graphic detail about sex, and asking for pictures. I don't necessarily want all private conversations online analyzed by software, but if I had a daughter, I would consider opting into it."

Is someone there observing to ensure that doesn't happen? Or is it intentional that you can vote for more than one candidate? Like, if you really disliked one candidate, you could vote for everyone else except them."
