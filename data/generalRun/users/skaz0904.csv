AnotherLife,ff3yfzi,t3_erifrj,1579551589.0,"I didn't think it was bad, it was entertaining enough that I binged it in a weekend. I'm glad it was renewed for a second season, and like you said, it takes time for shows to gain their momentum. It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia was mediocre until the brought Danny DeVito on in season 3.

I think the majority of hate comes from people who think it's too unrealistic and not scientifically correct. IE. ""ThEy'Re ToO yOuNg FoR a SpAcE mIsSiOn"". It's basically a space soap opera and as shallow as it is to say, the majority of the audience would rather see a younger/attractive cast having a threesome then actors who are middle-aged. 

It's a series that's made for entertainment, not realism. I think it has potential, and with the cast being so young hopefully they're able to maintain their roles for a bunch of seasons to come!"
Buffalo,ff3lrxu,t1_ff3jr1t,1579543761.0,"My brother had his wedding at Iron Workers in October 2019. It was a great venue that's freshly renovated, the food was good, and there's plenty of room if you wanted to do a photo booth and stuff like that.

The only drawback we had was the head table at the reception. Including the bride and groom, we had 12 people where the wedding party sat and it was very crammed with the chairs having to touch each other to fit. Anytime someone had to get up, you had to push your chair backwards  to get out. Hopefully your wedding party is smaller!

Other than that minor detail, it was a great venue."
Catan,ff3eifw,t1_feyan5g,1579539444.0,"If there's a resource that's not on good numbers (IE. 2, 3, 11) try to look at 2:1 ports and see if there's any resources on good numbers and double down on. If you can make it to the port, you'll be able to to use the 2:1 and hopefully trade in for the resource you're lacking.

Personal opinion, I always try to get on a good mountain number. Although it's not necessary in the beginning, its very useful for cities and development cards. I tend to worry less about brick because towards the end of the game, it's pretty useless unless you're fighting for the longest road."
Catan,ff3cmm4,t3_eqt5js,1579538489.0,"I'm more reserved with DC's, I rarely buy them unless I have good numbers for all the resources. I'm more of a building/longest road type player if the board is in my favor.

The cleanest win I ever had was when I won with pure points (no victory points, longest road, or largest army). The rolls were in my favor and I was able to keep building settlements and cities. Those are my favorite wins since you don't have to worry about someone stealing the longest road/largest army from you."
Catan,ff3c679,t3_er89qe,1579538258.0,"If the red settlement was there before the blue roads after it, then it is an illegal move and those blue roads shouldn't have been built.

If the blue roads were there first and red built the settlement after, than you can continue building on the 2 blue roads. However the red settlement breaks their road, so blue cannot combine the roads before and after the red settlement together (only really affects longest road)."

Catan,fdqrrf6,t3_emplxv,1578673477.0,"I'd say green, but brown is a contender as well. I'm going with green because they have the Ore advantage which will be helpful in the end to build cities. Their only issue is not being on a sheep element, but hopefully they build a road to the 8-4 brick/sheep and can build a settlement. But sheep has good numbers, so as long as their strategic with their trading, it's their game to lose. 

Although, I see that 8-Ore being covered by the robber the majority of the game. That can play a factor as well. This is why Catan is such a great game, anything can happen and anyone can win! Please let us know the outcome of the game!"

Catan,fcxqp2x,t3_ejfu1j,1578069162.0,"Just to clarify, did player A use his two wood that he traded for any use? Or did he use his wood port to get another wheat, just to give to player B to use for their city?

Although it could be considered a ""cheap"" shot, it did extend the game so unfortunately I do not consider it gifting. We had a similar instance regarding the longest road. Player A was going for the longest road, but player B had a chance to connect his roads to ensure the longest road. Player C was able to block player B but needed two roads to do so. Player A traded 2 roads for a sheep to player C so he cut off player B. Player B was pretty disgruntled, but we didn't consider it gifting because it was strategic for player A, which ended up getting the longest road in the end.

Whenever we have contested moments, we use democracy and vote on it. It usually ends up in a heated debate, but at the end of the day it's just a game. We only had 1 instance of a player flipping the table lol."

offmychest,fctev9b,t3_eisk44,1577941028.0,"It’s a personal view of mine, but death is something that happens to everyone. Your mom, dad, siblings, cousins, even yourself. There’s nothing you can to control it. It’s human nature. As sad as it is to hear, it’s what happens to everyone. 

My dad passed away very unexpectedly at an early age. He was healthy, worked out, and lived a good life. There was nothing anyone could’ve done to control it. When it happens, it happens. 

I suggest reading up on death to find a philosophy that makes you feel better about it. Whether it’s afterlife, reincarnation, heaven...it’s how you view what happens after our souls leave our present body."

Drag Race is popular enough that I do agree, the prize has to be bigger. But shows like Big Brother on public network only has a prize of $500,000, so I’m not surprised Drag Race is where it’s at. Dragula is very up and coming, I bet the next season will have a higher prize due to their ratings.

I feel like there is no logistics for prize money on reality shows. The fact that people who go on Naked and Afraid with no prize money baffles me.  It makes me believe half of the prize is the expose they get."

I’m not sure how the restaurant industry works, but in the education system, we’re mandated reporters if we suspect abuse. It’s tricky because we’re provided information to make a case, whereas you probably know nothing accept their first name and maybe their credit card info (if they didn’t pay in cash). 

And even if you did know that information, CPS wouldn’t be able to respond in a timely manner to help the child. Honestly; CPS is a broken system that needs to be fixed. Too many cases go unsolved for too long than they should.

I would ask your manager or someone from administration about what to do regarding a patron being assaulted. Hopefully they have a protocol, but if not, I’m not sure what you can legally do without getting yourself in trouble. It SUCKS knowing that’s how the system is right now,but you can’t jeopardize your job for it.

I’m sorry you had to witness this. I’ll never forget about a situation that happened to me in the 90’s at a Denny’s in my town. A father literally dragged his daughter by the hair out the door because he disobeyed her. As much as it sucked to watched, nobody did anything about it. It’s completely wrong, but in some cases and in some circumstances, there’s nothing people can do. 

Try not to beat yourself up over it. If they’re a regular patron, then maybe you have some stance to create a case to help the child."
