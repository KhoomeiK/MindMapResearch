And yeah, no shit people with opposing viewpoints to the protest would get forcibly removed. Especially if, as is almost always the case, they're only there to rile people up in the first place.  

A forum having a mod or having a few people who post on there more than others is not comparable, not even close, to having a leader. 

You didn't answer any of my questions about the ""bounty"" at all.

And yes, I'm aware of what the pseudo acronym stands for. However, I think you and I both know that I meant there's no enforcement of any structured beliefs. There's no commonality between members, since, as I have already pointed out, it's not an organization, and the concept of ""membership"" doesn't even make sense in this context. And there's no set of shared common goals, values, mission, beliefs, or anything else other than those two words which clearly mean different things to different people."

You realize that's like saying, ""Everyone named Davis put a bounty on him,"" right? I'm curious where exactly you think this bounty came from, how you expect anyone to think they would claim it, and where/whom would the money come from? Do you just go up to the first person you see with a bandana or poorly homemade t-shirt that says ANTIFA on it and ask him where his boss is?"
