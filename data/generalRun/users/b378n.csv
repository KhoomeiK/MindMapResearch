offmychest,fefrpga,t3_eouddd,1579063236.0,"I'm sorry that you're going through this, I can't imagine how hard it is to be at home and around your brother. I'd recommed you to seek some kind of advice or talk with a counselor in your school. Not getting out of bed and being sad might be indications that you have depression or you're very exhausted. You could also tell you parents that you haven't been feeling well recently and that maybe you should see a professional. I think it would help you to go through your emotions with a professional who can help you, because it's clear that the your brother's illness is taking a big toll on you.
Good luck and I hope it gets better."
