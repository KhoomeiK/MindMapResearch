It’s *kinda* like any sport except for the necessity for crazy balance, but I started when I was 7 (too old by the look of today’s standards lol) and the first couple years was just learning how to stand up and go forward. 
I skate alone usually so I never progressed into an amazing skater, intermediate at best, learned how to skate everything typically skated, but only casually. 
Only sprained a wrist so far, both ankles, whiplash and lockjaw from face planting. It’s the reason most skaters are so particular about keeping their ground free of debris. The smallest object can stop your board and send you flying. 
It’s obviously not for everyone, especially how it can go from 0 to 100 for fucking yourself up on concrete, something nobody likes do at all.

This was their doing, Russians doing, whoever the hell voted for or pulled strings to put this dipshit in office. 

He is the epitome of the ineffective, do nothing, president they GOP always loves to label Democratic presidents.

Imperial makes a sweet flaring/swaging tool that grips the pipe from 8 directions (there are radial plates that overlap and tighten like a camera lense) or there are swaging drill bits. 

Use a screwdriver for mechanical leverage to tighten down the wing nuts, starting on the side furthest from your pipe.

Try to keep your clamping force equal or you might turn your tube into an oval, which will cause turbulence in your line.

Keep at it, it happens before your eyes, there’s no way to really gauge the progress you make but you’ll get the muscle memory down before you know it. 

Also a drop of refrigerant oil on your swaging tool/flaring tool goes a long way.

If you were to switch to a threaded tool you could modulate the process, tightening down a half to full turn, back out a quarter turn, tighten down another half to full turn, repeat.
