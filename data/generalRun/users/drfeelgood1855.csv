running,ffbvgvd,t3_esslnd,1579784121.0,Would recommend you see a podiatrist and invest in a good pair of orthotics. I had shin splints in the past and I got a pair of custom orthotics and it resolved. Also having a good stretching routine is important.

castiron,fe3shew,t3_enpkkh,1578852458.0,Clean it up real well. That stuff should work. Then coat with vegetable oil on inside and start seasoning it. If got a grill could put it in there or could do in oven. Someone else may have better idea. Growing up we would put oil on inside and set over a fire lol.

smoking,fd848eu,t1_fd5uqpw,1578213724.0,Sorry no response earlier. This is part of learning the smoker. I typically never completely close off in and out flow to a grill. I manage more with how many lit coals I start fire with. Order pizza !
smoking,fd4v9fn,t1_fd4uw2u,1578171412.0,For chicken put it in thigh portion of meat not touching bone and cook until an internal temperature of 165.
smoking,fd4thpt,t3_ek1zni,1578170933.0,Since it’s a new smoker I would just have fun with the cook! You will learn a lot over the first few cooks. I recommend checking out forums and investing in meat thermometers. A leave in meat thermometer is great. A dual probe allows you to measure grill temp at the grates and the meat. Do a few cooks before inviting people over for BBQ.  Boston butt/pork shoulder is a good meat to practice temp management and is usually rather cheap. At the end of the day during the early learning process if it does not turn out well just order a pizza!

dogs,fcvg5jv,t1_fcvew8w,1578001397.0,I haven’t had an issue with that unless they have a UTI.  Make sure they are in appropriate sized crate. Dogs are smart and typically won’t pee or poop if they got to lay in it. It will also depend on how long you are gone for work also. Typically start with a couple hours then build up from there. You want to make your dog comfortable in its crate and not use it for punishment. Goal is to make it his special/calming place. If gone long hours may be a good idea to consider dog walker.
dogs,fcvbieg,t3_ej3mx5,1577998631.0,With rescues some have separation anxiety. Agree with making sure no UTI with vet. Recommend getting a plastic type kennel and start crate training while at work. Learned lesson with my first rescue he was a Houdini when it came to the wire kennels. It takes time so don’t be discouraged! Bell training for potty training worked well for our rescues.

fitness30plus,fcl7og0,t3_ehqoqv,1577741590.0,Sometimes this is early signs of Posterior Tibial Tendon Dysfunction which can progress over time. A lot of times functional orthotics can help support your arch which can help take some stress off. If it’s painful recommend seeing a local Podiatrist.

rimjob_steve,fcl36e3,t1_fcl242e,1577738805.0,I agree that majority of the time this is the case. Was just referring to comment that it’s always techs. Intraoperative it is not uncommon for Hand and Foot surgeons to take there on fluoroscopy images with mini c-arms. But outpatient office settings Podiatrist and Dentist take their own xrays at times. Not always though.

rimjob_steve,fcl101x,t1_fcksik8,1577737460.0,Depend on what type of Doctor you see and if it is inpatient or in outpatient clinic. Certain Specialist take their own X-rays due to the angling and set up can be specific for what they are looking for. But most of the time is a tech.
