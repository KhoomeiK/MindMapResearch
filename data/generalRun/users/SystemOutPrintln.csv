Sure they are, let's say your 64gb of ram works for say 15 years, RAMs pretty stable there's no reason it couldn't.

educationalgifs,ff6osh8,t1_ff6mz6j,1579631744.0,"So you say that PT didn't help but you felt better when working out.  If anything it seems like the PT and exercise helped strengthen the muscles around your back which led to your injury being healed as you have described.  It was simply a psychological pain that was left over which can be helped with psychotherapy.  However ignoring real pain can be very dangerous because the pain is a sensory indicator that something is wrong.  You need to repair the back first then cure any lingering pain, it seems completely disingenuous and potentially harmful to assume all back pain is psychological first.
