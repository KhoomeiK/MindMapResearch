nintendo,ffa7aht,t1_ff9talz,1579729269.0,It does not work like that.
nintendo,ffa74rs,t1_ffa4mlx,1579729180.0,Defending a greedy company for unfair business practices is dumb. This is anti-consumer and anyone defending it is wrong.
nintendo,ffa6zql,t1_ff9wq9f,1579729101.0,Or because they can. I preorder because I want to.
nintendo,ffa6t3e,t1_ff9q0wd,1579728999.0,You can literally go to any store or online store like Amazon and cancel your preorder.
nintendo,ffa6php,t1_ff9p801,1579728944.0,People can do whatever they want with their money. Idk why people think they should decide how others spend their money. Nintendo is wrong for this.
3DS,ff5hxkq,t3_erpzdn,1579593667.0,It was too difficult for me tbh. I quit after the third world because I just wasn't having fun. And I even played sorta of harder platformers like Shovel Knight but this game was just too much for me. I felt like Donkey Kong was too heavy or something and it made everything a struggle unless you had Diddy Kong who you'd inevitably lose after getting hit.
SwagBucks,fepyp3l,t1_feo33ye,1579334809.0,Brickseeking pricing and inventory isn't very accurate for the most part imo
college,feel5ui,t3_eoqaxj,1579035977.0,Try starting your trial in the middle of week 1 maybe.
Arrowverse,feabt7j,t3_eo5vp6,1578946754.0,Well Earth's seem to coincide with the year the character was introduced so Earth 77 might make sense because he was introduced in 1977
Mercari,fe3yozp,t3_enqoe4,1578854060.0,"They might have a coupon, and the coupon doesn't take any percentage off the shipping cost."
SwagBucks,fdyimf1,t3_enbp3l,1578780138.0,You're paranoid.
SonicTheHedgehog,fdsfjon,t1_fdsemx1,1578701608.0,What's fantasy zone?
SonicTheHedgehog,fdsc1qe,t3_emxxd9,1578699162.0,What does this mean?
DC_Cinematic,fdpygvw,t3_emh5ky,1578645983.0,I'm excited to hear Doja Cat and Normani tbh.
Games,fdpoocb,t3_emagrf,1578634840.0,This sub is just as bad as r/gaming.
JoeBiden,fdou5bh,t3_emgffx,1578612936.0,"Clinton isn't running nor do I think she would accept a spot as VP. She recently became the Chancellor for a university in the UK so I don't she would even be considered.

I really wanted her to win in 2016, but we know how that turned out."
Games,fdoakh0,t1_fdo7d6w,1578601729.0,That's interesting. I tried to play explorers of time a few years ago and I just found the game pretty boring.
NintendoSwitchDeals,fdntlna,t3_emcl71,1578592574.0,It's $14.99 still.
Games,fdnksvg,t1_fdniief,1578587883.0,Doesn't mean they shouldn't. Most didn't like the $59.99 price for Link's Awakening either...
Games,fdng8n7,t1_fdnd8v2,1578585151.0,Except this game is full price at $59.99 for some reason.
SonicTheHedgehog,fdjfixx,t3_elnwvg,1578468623.0,"I really don't look at movie reviews before I see them. I watch what I'm interested in and don't let others decide, lol."
SonicTheHedgehog,fdjffw1,t3_elm7gf,1578468525.0,"I grew up with Heroes, and it's honestly my favorite Sonic. Most people hate the many characters, but I think it makes the game more fresh and being able to play as everyone was just superfun for me. Idk why"
freebies,fdht5oo,t1_fdhlt1b,1578429692.0,I did ask and the lady still said no.
DCcomics,fdg87mg,t3_el129i,1578384145.0,I was literally checking when it was gonna release because I just finished the Constantine animated series.
SonicTheHedgehog,fdd5tie,t1_fdcurud,1578296074.0,"This game was my first exposure to Sonic and I thought it was the coolest thing ever when I got it as a kid, the dinosaur level and the pirate themed ones stick out to me the most for some reason. The controls are annoying today, but I have nostalgia for this game, lol. I liked the soul gauge too, it felt like a cooler version of the normal boost"
SwagBucks,fdbh20f,t3_ekist1,1578257317.0,I did two of those surveys and never got credited so I stopped doing them.
worldnews,fda6vfo,t3_ekbp5w,1578242409.0,"Everyone advocates for this, but doesn't realize the only way this occurs is by having employees in poorer countries work full schedules for much less..."
JoeBiden,fd4yje6,t3_ejzt0i,1578172410.0,"Because he has the best chance of beating Trump in swing states, and he also won't raise taxes crazy like Bernie would"
college,fczh69p,t3_ejn6w5,1578101163.0,"Teach, but you'll have to go back if you didn't get certified during your bachelor's."
college,fcwprf9,t3_ej3v82,1578032906.0,I'm excited to take Spanish conversation lol.
college,fcto3cf,t3_eiu22k,1577950988.0,"If you're planning to graduate from a German college, but planning to work in the USA, just remember that many employers don't accept or are hesitant to hire people with foreign degrees."
college,fctnt99,t3_eiun8i,1577950617.0,"I've looked into this myself, and I decided not to for a few reasons. Many programs are unpaid internships and some require that you pay just to do the internship. If you're looking for internships in that hopes that it'll lead a to job offer to work in the USA, I personally wouldn't recommend it, but if not it seems like it would be a good experience."
college,fcmek0b,t3_ehxx44,1577772391.0,"As an accounting major who took business calc, I'd only recommend taking calc 2 if you're not sure on accounting and opting for engineering. I was gonna test out of calc 1, but ended up staying in accounting. Much of the material is the same, but calc 1 goes further in detail and spends more time on topics. However, if you're in between different business majors calc for business is more than enough and only take calc 2 if you're interested."
politics,fcm08gu,t3_ehp5b1,1577760850.0,This sub should be deleted.
JoeBiden,fcj3efs,t3_ehajra,1577676280.0,"I like it! I love having the choice to decide between a public and private option, instead of having neither option."
SonicTheHedgehog,fchaoxt,t3_eh7fvf,1577648824.0,"Just give me a remake of the adventure games. 

If the next big game is going to be released in 2021 then it makes me sad to know that they only released two good games in 10 years and one wasn't even made by Sonic Team (Mania)."
Arrowverse,fccz366,t1_fcccq9o,1577604376.0,That's actually not true. He's been a very busy actor recently and he held those right leaning views when he was hired.
college,fcasxnt,t3_egwl0j,1577575981.0,"I recycle all of it. The only notes I've ever kept are Spanish notes, everything else never ends up getting up looked it and just takes up space for no reason."
Mercari,fc7gbc4,t3_egkzkx,1577506573.0,No.
Mercari,fc7ga3a,t3_egl1ma,1577506543.0,"I only mark it shipped when I put the package in the drop off box, even if it's on the weekends or past the drop off time to make sure the buyer doesn't request cancellation as I can no longer access the package."
3DS,fc4n4mi,t3_eg68xj,1577421638.0,Yoshi's Wooly World!
SonicTheHedgehog,fc431s3,t3_eg1klv,1577405323.0,I just realized Sonic doesn't have a neck.
JoeBiden,fc220ot,t3_efojxe,1577337279.0,My top pick would be Kamala Harris. Taking her out of the Senate would not matter as California is a blue state. I'd also be okay with Amy Klobuchar or Stacy Abrams.
SwagBucks,fc1v75f,t3_efoctx,1577330736.0,"I actually got suspended for using a VPN literally one time, so if you can't login to your account then you're probably suspended. If you can't login, then I recommend contacting them and apologizing kindly as well as telling them it was an accident and you will never do it again."
college,fbx0rmp,t3_eeuyvn,1577165053.0,"There's no such thing as ""the"" college experience in my opinion. Everyone has their own experience going to college, regardless of what the movies or other people have to say. Staying in dorms and partying all day might sound like the college experience to some, but for others it'd be the opposite. So I'd say start by understanding that."
