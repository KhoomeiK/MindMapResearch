destiny2,ff57sce,t1_ff4pzce,1579582735.0,"Look him up, he is one of the biggest destiny youtubers !

For gambit, I can say I'm pretty good at it and here are some of the tips I would recommend -

1. In gambit, you will need to kill blockers and get motes, you can deposit 5, 10 or 15- and while you can deposit say 8 or 11 motes,I would recommend 5, 10, 15.. The best way for a beginner to not be that terrible guy is to kill say 5 enemies, get 5 motes and bank them. The problem occurs when you have 10 motes on you and then you die.

2. Invaders - Every match, the opposition can invade, now if you are not confident in your ability OR have 5+ motes on you, either bank straight away or just hide, keep your eyes out on where and teammates are so that if and when they die, you know where to run to !

3. OK, so now you have put 100 motes and you get your prime evil. Everytime a damage phase starts, the primeevil has 3 envoys on him, kill these and a fourth spawns, kill that too and a big white circle forms standing on which will do high damage to the boss. You will need to do this cycle atleast 3-4 times and everytime you do damage to the primeevil and move to next phase- you will see ""*primeevil slayer *"" on the screen.

4. Do not and I mean DO NOT USE YOUR SUPER WHEN YOU HAVE JUST PRIMEEVIL SLAYER X1 OR 2, I see soooo many people do this and when you have only one stack of slayer, your super does no damage, wait for atleast 3 or 4 stacks when you super does a fuck ton of damage..

And that's it, look up datto, he goes into detail on these things :))"
destiny2,ff41o4z,t1_ff41eck,1579553603.0,"Yes 15 generally has the whole team running towards the bank and yeah, 2 one two punch shotty shots from 3 people is enough to kill a 15 blocker. The 10 blockers can be really annoying to deal with tho"
destiny2,ff41a3d,t1_ff414h9,1579553362.0,"Same me too, most chaps try to go for that 15 without any idea of the subtle strategies of banking motes and get one banged from a major :("
destiny2,ff410ic,t1_ff40pbb,1579553197.0,For me the most damning thing is people losing motes !
