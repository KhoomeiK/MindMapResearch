1. The universe expands far beyond what we can see (42 bil light-years), possibly infinite amounts of times. if this were true then all permitted arrangements of the matter might exist somewhere
2. Laws of physics aren't universal and different universes vary in the way the laws of physics differ as a result of the inflation caused by the big bang stopping at different times everywhere. essentially the different solutions of string theory control the environment in these different regions
3. Universes separated by time and in each, all the uncertainties allowed by quantum mechanics actually happen. Our entire universe and everything in it is constantly undergoing several fissions into daughter universes, similar to what happened when summer and Morty were uncertain and they kept spitting realities."
