AskReddit,ffh7mfu,t1_fffkkm3,1579925397.0,"My dog has a similar reaction if you gasp or suck in air really loudly. He hops up and squeaks a lot and paces, and if you keep doing it, he'll actually bark at you, which he hates doing."
AskReddit,ffh7iel,t1_fffckbu,1579925302.0,"My grandma had a cat, Teddy, who wouldn't come when you called him, but he would answer you. Wherever he was in the house, if you called ""Teddyyyy"",  you'd get a soft mrep in return."
AskReddit,ffh7c8j,t1_fffytc3,1579925158.0,These are the absolute sweetest. What a good boy.
AskReddit,ffh6uxp,t1_fffjmiq,1579924761.0,"This sounds like our pibble mix... She was dropped off in our back yard, having recently had puppies, beaten up pretty bad (covered in cigarette marks, botched ears), and clearly traumatized. She was terrified of men, loud noises, tile floors, and ceiling fans. 

But this dog was the craziest hunter I've ever seen. She snatched and killed snakes, tore apart and armadillo, caught lizards, and even pulled a raccoon out of a tree. Once Lady settled in and claimed us, it was like she'd decided nobody (no other animals at least) were allowed in our yard."
SBSK,ffgev9f,t3_et3ivu,1579904672.0,The supportiveness of Celeste's parents is so heartwarming. I know this is a snapshot of their life amd everyday probably wasn't so sunny - but the way their dad described facing hardships together almost made me cry.
namenerds,ffe22r8,t3_et13y2,1579834679.0,"It got mine, first try, top of the list. It's a popular name... Not so much that I always went by my last initial, but enough that I've always had other people in my life with my same name. 

My husband, however, has -what I thought was- a very unique name, especially the spelling, which people always get wrong due to the name's affiliation with a movie character who spelled it differently. But it got it! His name was the very bottom on the list, but it got it! I'm amazed!"
calmhands,ffds583,t3_esu7hk,1579827573.0,"Welcome, you are definitely not alone... Baby steps, for you and for your daughter... One day at a time, celebrate little victories, and spoil your hands with moisturizers and oils, sleep with socks on them, anything that makes you feel healthier. Also, my favorite fidget toy I ever found was my husband's silicone wedding band. We've since bulk ordered them off Amazon because they're so good at keeping me distracted from picking. When I don't have it, I have to sometimes literally sit on my hands until I'm distracted enough to move on from whatever I was picking. Find what works for you and dive in."
CasualConversation,ffdqveq,t3_esux4p,1579826740.0,"My husband's grandma has had some great cats with great names over the years... Pokey (short for Pokemon Poncer, named by now husband when he was ~7 years old), Snowball, Mr. Gray, Weezy, Teddy (the most vocal cat ever... If you called him, no matter where he was in the house, he'd MRAW back at you), Popsicle (goes by Pops), Wolverine, Star... I could go on..."
AskReddit,ffd6ha7,t1_ffc6o2m,1579814358.0,"Similarly, teaching. I get great ratings every semester and students seem to love the classes and connect well with both me and the material. 

But it's absolutely exhausting, a huge time sink, and I dread it so much I have nightmares for weeks leading up to the beginning of the semester. I blame it on my first year, which was a bit scaring, as I was thrown in to teaching the only subject I've ever failed, with no training whatsoever, and had the worst student issues anyone in my department (including full faculty) had ever even heard of."
orangetheory,ff9tqjz,t1_ff9gtm4,1579721075.0,"Yessss bring on all the squats. 

Core work is fun too, esp any sort of plank, but only because I've put some serious time in and things finally feel do-able and less scary than they once did."
dresdenfiles,ff917pp,t1_ff8f8iu,1579702277.0,"It's a good intro to how political high fantasy can be without overdoing it, imho. I'm rereading Brent Weeks' Lightbringer series and the politics are so deep and twisty that it makes me miss Alera's more straightforward world a bit."
namenerds,ff7zyat,t1_ff6a2j2,1579662409.0,Absolutely! If only there were enough remaining relatives alive to share it.

orangetheory,ff78av7,t1_ff787ik,1579643091.0,Ahh I definitely like the catching numbers game! It seems much better to do it at distances than times too lol
orangetheory,ff73uxg,t1_ff6qtoj,1579640587.0,"Kind of like counting... I pick a spot in the mirror (a drishti in yoga) and hold focus on it for as long as I can before checking the time again. I can't ever make it very long, but it helps distract me by challenging my mind."
namenerds,ff5yuba,t1_ff5tesm,1579614631.0,Love that!
