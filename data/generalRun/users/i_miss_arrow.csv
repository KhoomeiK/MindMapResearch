Thats one game, but they cheated for half the batters or more in that game (I couldn't record any plate appearances where the pitcher only threw fastballs, because there were no bangs, so there are probably more instances of cheating in that game than just the ones I recorded.)

Fangraphs [dug into it](https://blogs.fangraphs.com/how-much-did-the-astros-really-benefit-from-sign-stealing/) and concluded the impact was on the order of two or three wins.

I'm sure they tried in some fashion.

If nothing else they'd want the hitters to use the same methods all the time, not switch back and forth."
baseball,few5o9v,t1_few2u8t,1579405760.0,"Thats what they're saying.  But the specific sign-stealing method they used was brought over by Beltran (unless that was a lie?) and was only used at home, and we can measure the effects of the trash-can banging, which appear to be fairly low.  Not no effect, but low.  They absolutely murdered the ball on the road, where they seemingly didn't have signs.

Maybe it'll turn out they were cheating a TON even in 2014, 2015, and 2016.  But I don't see how, exactly.  What could they do on the hitting side, other than sign-stealing and roiding?  (I'm assuming they weren't roiding more than other teams, but who the fuck knows.)  And if they were sign-stealing with such effectiveness in 2014, 2015, and 2016. . . why did they start banging trash cans?  Why not keep doing the same incredibly effective thing they were already doing before and worked both at home and on the road?

I'm not saying they couldn't have been cheating much more effectively during those years.  But I AM saying I can't think of a good explanation that would explain effective cheating in 2014-2016 AND shitty can-banging in 2017, other than some sort of super-roids."

Well, yeah.

My point is that hitting off a tee is way easier.  All the statistical evidence we have suggests that the improvements from sign stealing were marginal for an individual player.  Like everybody tweaking their swing a bit, not everybody hitting off a tee.  I watched those games so I could get a data set together demonstrating the effects of sign stealing, with the thinking that it was a large effect and they weren't doing it that often.  (If they only stole signs on rare occasion, it'd be very hard to find in a large sample.)

I threw in the towel because, after 7 games, it was clear they were cheating their asses off, and it wasn't helping nearly as much as people claim.  Maybe if I'd done every home game I would have gotten enough data to pull out the effect, but whatever the effect is, it certainly isn't large enough to pick up over a smaller number of games.  

Why isn't the evidence there?  Fuck if I know.  My only speculation is that hitting is a highly fine-tuned process that relies on visual information and timing, and using audio signals to relay signs fucks with that.  Stealing signs won't help nearly as much if the act of stealing them causes the hitter to focus less."

Key quote:

>Well that certainly clouds our data. In almost every respect, the Astros performed better on the road than at home in 2017. The only aspects where they saw better results at home were when taking breaking balls and taking pitches out of the zone. They were around 20 runs better at home than on the road when they spit on a breaking ball or if the pitch was out of the zone. Considering all the data we’ve seen so far, that might be the one area where the Astros truly benefited from their sign-stealing system, and **it earned them maybe a couple of extra wins in 2017.**

That advantage might be bigger than the advantage steroids gives (as far as I know, we don't have any concrete analysis of the impact of steroids).  But its not nearly as big as people like to think."

Its not that simple.

They don't know what the pitch will be until a moment before it comes, and they have to listen for the pitch.  They have to engage a sensory mechanism that basically isn't used at all in hitting.

There is very good reason to think that the advantage of knowing the pitch is somewhat mitigated by the distraction of having to listen for the pitch.  And the good reason is that they hit better on the road during the season where we have extensive evidence of cheating at home using a method they couldn't use on the road.

The Dodgers averaged .249 overall *for the season*.  They hit about as well in the clutch as they did in general.  A fair number of teams did so.  That they started from a lower point doesn't prove the Astros got a ton of benefits in the clutch.  Most playoff teams fell off, but is that proof of playoff teams generally struggling in the clutch, or is that random variation?  

For 2016 AL playoff teams, the Red Sox, Orioles, and Blue Jays all hit about as well in clutch situations as not.  The Indians and Rangers fell off a little bit, but *none* of them fell off as badly as the Yankees did.  The 2016 NL is similar, with a few teams declining, other teams remaining about the same.  To put it simply, there isn't much evidence that teams generally play worse in the clutch.  Maybe a little bit?

The 2017 Yankees dropped some from .262, but besides the fact that those Yankees were abnormally bad in the clutch, the major difference between them and the Astros wasn't in the clutch, it was overall.  Which runs back into the 'how the fuck did the Astros hit so well on the road' problem.  Nobody is arguing the Astros didn't hit the everloving fuck out of the ball in 2017.

You're gonna need to clarify which stat you're pointing out, because we appear to be looking at different stats.  The [Twins](https://www.baseball-reference.com/teams/split.cgi?t=b&team=MIN&year=2017) and [Nationals](https://www.baseball-reference.com/teams/split.cgi?t=b&team=WSN&year=2017), just among playoff teams, hovered around the .260-270 range in most clutch stats, generally around a .020 difference.

And what do you mean other teams were close to them in overall stats?  The Rockies were the only team within .015 of batting average.  There ain't that big of a difference between .015 and .020.

If it actually were .030, I'd say you were on to something.

Maybe RISP is a big difference. . . except teams start using fancy signs with a man on second.  Having watched a lot of the games, they weren't actually stealing signs often with a man on second."

(If we eventually find out they were cheating on the road too, it would explain so many things).

The only stat from the clutch stats that specifically catches my eye is 'close and late' situations, as most teams seem to hit a lot worse than they normally do during that particular split.

Lots of people tried to downplay it as the Astros only cheated during high-stakes situations.  The problem is that we can hear the bangs on the videos.  They cheated all the time.

You know those self-check-out lines in supermarkets?  Supposedly they generally don't do a lot to improve times to get through lines.  But the experience of doing the work to check out the items is far better than just waiting for the cashier to do it.

For me, and I expect for many other people, fighting in constant battles to level up is waaaaaaay more enjoyable than sacrificing turns in a single battle to slightly improve long-term ability.  Christ thats a terrible gameplay mechanic.

Like in Final Fantasy tactics--fighting in regular battles to get stronger is astoundingly more enjoyable than weakening an enemy until it runs away then sitting there and using skills on each other to increase experience.

The type of grinding matters.  And draw grinding is absolutely awful IMO.  Even if it takes way less time, I'd rather spend more time doing an enjoyable type of grinding."
