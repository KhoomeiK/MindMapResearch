I had to explain to her what she wanted was not with in building code due to people would hit their heads on the cabling while walking around. she agreed and understood so we finished it all up. we had taken a small (500.00) deposit. she stiffed us on payment ( like 3k) citing ""i dont like how it looks"" and ""i feel emotionally damaged"" she attempted to dispute her deposit with her credit card company but being we had a contract they found in our favor. I've since ( listed in the contract ) billed her out at 10 percent late fee every 30 days till it reaches a balance of 9k, where it gets turned over to collections. I just finished hiring an agency to go after her now. I would take her to court but I dont have the time to run all the way here her business is...sadly she is the owner of a preschool and many things in her building were far out of code.
