So, in Japanese industries, salaries have went automatically up towards something like $200k/year if you graduate from a renowned university.

Professors may reach that point. But, what a research funding typically does is to increase the number of lower class research positions. Those are often postdocs with 40k/year and from that 40k they must pay healthcare and school loans etc. (crazy policy). Majority of postdocs don't get promotion. When they go out to the industry, they'll find it hard to find a company who'll give them good salaries because their friends took the industrial positions already.

It is better in countries that value PhDs. However, as far as I read in newspapers, and hear from my friends in Europe, it's rare to find such countries. 

(Computer science PhDs are doing well thanks to the AI and data science trends.)

My point is that many PhDs who walk away from academia would have won bigger salaries when the government didn't encourage PhD degrees and postdocs with its no-plan career strategy. Or it should introduce a better social security system."

I basically did a negotiation with my former boss: ""OK, you, boss, want me in your new institute. But I don't join the team without promotion."" It was only after that my boss gave me promotion to a professor. And that proposal of my promotion by him happened *right after* I forced that. If I didn't speak up, I would still be a postdoc.

It was also interesting to see how easy it was for him to promote me once he was determined to do that. Doesn't happen always, but, sometimes, higher class people have enough resources in their pocket that are spared unless it's really necessary.
