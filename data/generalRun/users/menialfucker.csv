dogswithjobs,feaklc0,t1_feafmxx,1578949906.0,"You do need documentation in my country, I do not know where the person lives so it's better to be safe than sorry with mentioning that. In my country we also have service dog Id cards in certain places. It is illegal for people to ask for documentation yes, but cops can ask if you've been told by a psychiatrist or doctor if you need one (ie. ""do you have the proper documents for a service dog"" they can't ask to see it) and if you need to go to court about any service dog mishaps you absolutely need to bring the documentation to prove it's a real service dog. I edited my comment to reflect it was in my country specifically and to check their own laws"
dogswithjobs,feaatg0,t1_fe8803f,1578946399.0,"Your brother needs a note from a psychiatrist or doctor before anything else. Even if you want to self train a dog you can get into trouble by the law if someone decides to calls the cops and they find out you have a dog that is doing public access illegally. (This is in my own country, so check the laws in yours regarding it) Also like someone else said, it might not be the best for someone who is anxious in public because it draws attention to you. Also if you get approved, buy a pure-bred dog from a certified breeder. Labradors, golden retrievers and poodles are the easiest and best service dogs. Mixed breeds are not as predictable with temperament as they grow older and shelter dogs can have trauma that prevents them from doing service work. Good luck to your little brother!"
transpositive,fe9q770,t3_eo5kjn,1578940468.0,"I'm going to lose my whole family when I come out (I won't come out until after I started HRT) but I decided personally that it's not worth spending the rest of my life miserable just to make others happy. If they leave, their love was conditional and I don't want to associate with people who care more about what's in my pants and how they feel about it than what I need to be happy and comfortable. So overall I don't care about the 'carnage' because I want to put my own quality of life about others for once. If they want to make a big deal about it that's on them. My situation is different than yours however, because I have no kids and am not married. Overall i'm not going to tell you to transition or not to transition. That is a choice you must make. It's up to you to weigh the pros and cons. i wish you luck in your decision, whatever it may be."

thedawnpatrol,fclvicz,t3_ehvrta,1577757480.0,"I don't think it's hollyleaf because I am highly doubtful that she'd banish her brother, be obsessed with keeping squirrelflight with her at all times like a needy kit or be creepy and hit on a she-cat used as a spy (bristlefrost? I forget her name tbh) It's most likely a tom. Not to mention pseudo-star tried to kill one of the thunderclan warriors with dogs which is tigerstar level of evil. (Not that it is tigerstar because he's dead dead). Interesting theory though. I wonder if there are any other code-obsessed cats we didn't think about yet"
ChoosingBeggars,fcidkz6,t1_fcfsr2e,1577660960.0,"You require a written document from a psychiatrist to own a real service dog (not a therapist, they don't count). If you try to go to a service dog program to get a dog without a document they'll immediately reject you. Even if you train the dog yourself it's still not a legal service dog without medical documents saying you require it. This might be different where you live but it's the rule in my country. I think the whole world needs stricter rules on service dogs, especially with so many fake service dogs running around :/"
ChoosingBeggars,fcic0ac,t1_fcaty37,1577660322.0,Even then emotional support animals are just glorified pets. They only have the same rights as regular animals and don't count as service dogs at all. Tbh if reported they could probably be charged with faking service dogs which can be up to a $3k fee per dog (at least where I live that's what happens)
selfhelp,fcb4i2f,t1_fca47sm,1577582241.0,"> Most important I feel that I am already in their debt for everything they have done for me. I dont want to disappoint them any further.

One thing you have to understand is that even if your parents have helped you, you do not owe them anything. You are not in their debt. It is up to them if they want to help you, and giving you life makes them obligated to take care of you until you are an adult. If they have helped you as an adult that is their choice and a nice choice to make, but it doesn't mean you have to follow rules or religions that make you miserable just to keep the people you share DNA with happy. You need to live a life you enjoy and the best way to do that is to start thinking of yourself and what you want & need more instead of what your parents will think."
