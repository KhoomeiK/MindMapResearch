I also will sometimes keep a can around the house to eat in those super lazy or busy times when i don't want to cook anything, but i don't want to eat super junky food like potato chips or cookies. (not implying that they aren't junk food. They're really salty, and for some reason (I'm assuming the salt) they make my pee smell like spaghetti-os for the next 12 hours. whats funny is they are kind of expensive for such a cheap food. like $2.50 for the big can. and i can eat two of those if i'm really hungry.   


Now IMO, the chef boyardee ravioli are the ones that do not hold up. I think they have changed their recipe or something because the sauce is really watery now, and tastes like the can."
todayilearned,fdm0uvb,t1_fdlgk4l,1578537140.0,"A double major in music and something else is a 6 or 7 year degree path. The moment you step on campus as a freshman in music you have 16 hours of music classes and 1 core class. Plus most of the music classes are like 1 credit hour, even though they meet 2 or 3 times a week. I averaged about 7 or 8 different classes a semester. It wasnt like my friends outside of music that had 3 and 4 hours of free time during the school day. I was in class nonstop with maybe an hour for lunch. Then, when class was over, I was expected to practice about 4-8 hours a day. The workload of music majors at my school was similar to that of engineering students."

Edit for your edit: an EcoBoost mustang may not be faster than german performance sedans on a spec sheet, but they will burn the tires off if you get in it too hard. They will leave everyone at a standstill from a stoplight. They will put you back in the seat a bit. 

My point is they arent just a muscle car body with a hamster wheel under the hood. It's a sporty car that's more accessible to more people (and probably more manageable for your average driver)"
