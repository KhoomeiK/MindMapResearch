As to the casual dining I'm referring to, it's more comparing 1980s/1990s quality with 2020s. I used to *love* Olive Garden and Applebee's back in the day...but they've really went downhill. Food quality, service.

boomershumor,fdlp00i,t3_elt4dc,1578529058.0,"*The conversation about the modern world/tech is a cliche by now, but that doesn't mean it's not worth talking about. My opinion on this has become more nuanced as I age. Yes, I understand what you're saying about kids and smart phones. But, playing devil's advocate, what if we substituted smart phones for gameboys or other hand-held video game devices? That generation came out okay, despite all the hand-wringing of parents.*

*What miffs me is the mounting social obligation that you NEED to have a smartphone. You only ""need"" a smartphone because everyone else has one, and you don't want to be left behind. I still believe that we as a society don't need to be ""plugged in"" every waking moment. I had this same complaint when cell phones came out: I don't need to be reachable 24/7. And honestly, aside from one or two useful apps (google GPS is great, but I could still be just fine with a stand-alone Garmin GPS), life would go on fine for most of us without having the internet in our pocket. Life has become much more intense/distracted/harried with having a pocketful of this always-on ocean of information, push notifications and all manner of distractions. And I've noticed I've become weaker with a smartphone: I'm less tolerant of silence and just having to wait for things (waiting in line, waiting to get on a bus/elevator) because I always have that dopamine squirt in my pocket if things get boring. I used to be STRONGER and more able to tolerate daily lulls before smartphones -- now a momentary lull makes me far more fidgety than before.*

*Of course a lot of this comes down to self-discipline. You don't need to check your phone constantly. You can turn off push notifications and not check your email every five seconds. But smartphones have raised the self-discipline bar very high. I've seen people who swear they won't be ruled by their new smartphone, but slowly but surely...*[This](https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/82ogd9/i_hate_the_modern_world_fuck_smart_phones_fuck/)"
