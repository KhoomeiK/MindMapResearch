One night, Iâ€™m watching a movie. Forget what. I see a cockroach on my wall, and it goes behind my TV. I grab a magazine, roll it up, and walk to the other side of the tv where the roach was, waiting for him to come out. I couldnâ€™t see him, so I got my head as close to the wall as I could. 

Next thing I know, Iâ€™m on the floor, on my ass, legs splayed out in front of me. My back is against the wall, which means my body went 90 degrees. My pocket knife which was in my back pocket, is about ten feet away from me and open. Weirdest thing, my TV was turned damn near sideways on the stand. 

I sat there for about thirty seconds trying to figure out how this happened. My mom knocked on my bedroom door and asked if Iâ€™m okay. I immediately sobered up and said â€œyeah, I was leaning back in my chair and fell but Iâ€™m goodâ€ (to this day idk if she bought it but itâ€™s never come up).
