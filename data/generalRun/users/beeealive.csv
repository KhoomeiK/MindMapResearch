DuggarsSnark,ff2brsk,t3_er6pk1,1579499951.0,This was a fascinating read!
AskReddit,fem88zo,t3_eppn2i,1579243340.0,Yeah my grandpa would come meet us at the gate when we flew into visit
Nanny,fem82rw,t3_eptm9r,1579243150.0,This is 99% chance a scam. Get away and fast!
unt,fem7hhc,t3_epvq1y,1579242518.0,Yes. Literally everywhere
Nanny,fem7d2e,t3_eppy9w,1579242389.0,"My first full time nanny job, the kids had quiet time for 1.5 hours every afternoon. Ages 3&5. Mb told me straight up that I could sleep as long as I was on the futon that is less than 10 feet from each of their doors. Even if they weren’t sleeping I was close enough to hear everything! bless that woman! She knew 11 hour days with preschoolers was exhausting, which is why she went back to work (corporate attorney) and hired nannies. Luckily by the time she hired me she had a few past nannies and knew how to treat her employees! Loved working for them. I left after 18 months for school reasons and those kids are 15 and 13 now!"
Nanny,fem75s5,t3_epms9k,1579242175.0,Yikes. If it’s that big of a project they should rent an apartment or something in the mean time
DuggarsSnark,fej520k,t1_fehnkwj,1579157197.0,"I have been on several medical missions and we have US based actual medical professionals who partner with Nicaraguan medical professionals to provide care to underserved communities. We can diagnose and treat minor illnesses and refer to our local friends to help with major issues. We do not leave anyone hanging. We met a man last year who fell into a pool of chemicals on a palm plantation and now has a condition similar to Parkinson’s from exposure. His only relief is in the form of Parkinson’s medication (and it’s only a temporary fix, he will die from this in the next 5 years). And we arranged for his pastor to buy him the medicine every month (so we have receipts and know what the money is going towards) every month until he dies. So at least he will have some physical relief. And the medication only costs $35/month"
Nanny,feg5ryh,t1_fdy96yt,1579078239.0,Honestly it wasn’t super scary because I already knew the kids but as time went on and the mom didn’t come back I was worried how I would keep them fed
TwoXChromosomes,fe0d92k,t3_enet9m,1578810575.0,I have a bcg work polo that’s actually cut for boobs. It’s awesome
Nanny,fdxcq66,t3_en7d1r,1578767475.0,"A few come to mind: once as a mother’s helper for my neighbors grandkids. They had 5F triplets, 2M and 1F. Their mom straight up disappeared. I had all five playing upstairs and she said she would make lunch downstairs. 20 minutes later I call down and she’s not there. Then I check the driveway and garage. She’s straight up gone. The minivan is gone too. I’m 11 years old. I feed the kids apples and peanut butter and crackers and just wait. I don’t know if she had a cell phone, I didn’t. I finally got a hold of my mom on their landline and my mom calls the grandparents who get a hold of the dad. Who comes home at 5pm. Mom is still gone and no one knows where she is. Dad luckily also has a minivan so he loads up me and all 5 kids to take me home (my mom was home with my sick little brother). I later learned that the mom was gone for 3 days on some drug bender. They divorced shortly after and dad got full custody.

When I was 13 I was babysitting for the neighbors. They had 2M and just told me to feed him peanut butter and jelly for dinner. Except there was no pb and I could only find hamburger buns. And while searching I broke a giant glass jar that was on top of the fridge. I luckily had shoes on and scooped up 2M and put a baby gate blocking the mess. I had no idea how to clean it up though so I called my mom and she came over and showed me. Meanwhile 2M is screaming in hunger. So I made him a jelly sandwich and heated up some leftover broccoli. Parents thought it was hilarious when they got home... nice."
Nanny,fdt96y0,t1_fdt93rg,1578713559.0,The kids were elementary age too
Nanny,fdt4f3y,t3_emzq2w,1578711778.0,"I had to do that with one family. MB literally wanted a text when we left the house, when we arrived at our destination, when we left our destination and when we arrived home. This was many many years ago and texts didn’t always go through on time and a few times she panicked bc she thought I forgot the kids at school when obviously if that had happened the school would’ve called her on the landline to her office."
unt,fd7c7v9,t3_ek6tiy,1578202240.0,Lol. If you think Denton rent is expensive...
bipolar,fd7bpe7,t1_fd4wzyg,1578202046.0,No. I tried but it was never effective. I gained 60lbs that I’m still struggling 5 years later to lose. Luckily I’ve lost about 35 of that 60
bipolar,fd468cc,t3_ejzu6z,1578164786.0,I didn’t gain any weight on abilify but I did gain A LOT of weight on Latuda
PsychWardChronicles,fcz48s2,t3_ej7f59,1578093347.0,I had good experiences all three times. Hopefully I’m done though. It’s been almost 3 years since my last admission.
AskReddit,fcnr36v,t3_ei4bkv,1577816841.0,Louise from Bobs Burgers might actually be able to save me
Nanny,fcnqaz0,t3_ehx2o0,1577816415.0,I refuse to get on trampolines. I hate them with a passion
TwoXChromosomes,fcmae00,t1_fck5ghp,1577768624.0,Yeah I use men’s deodorant now with no scent and a little perfume
Nanny,fcm9znx,t3_ehum4u,1577768285.0,Honestly that sounds nuts. I once interviewed for a family that wanted a t/th nanny for their 6M. MB had a pt job and would do all his homeschooling MWF. Then I got their for my trial/orientation and she pushed a stack of books in my lap and told me to start planning lessons.... I have zero experience with this and told her it wouldn’t work out and left at the end of the day. She called the next day when I didn’t show up and berated my voicemail for not coming to work and being unprofessional.
bipolar,fc4yoo0,t3_efy4bv,1577434227.0,I’ve been ‘stable’ for almost 3 years. Unmedicated since July but never manic or hypomanic
bipolar,fc3ayza,t3_efy4bv,1577385744.0,"I am currently unmedicated and stable (which I have no idea how that happened) and I’m working 50 hour weeks in a really stressful, fast paced field. I’m a fucking miracle right now."
antiMLM,fc39pqb,t1_fc2ahlg,1577384867.0,Oh I got one of those earlier this month
antiMLM,fc39msa,t1_fc2tncd,1577384809.0,This lady apparently. I also got a religious pamphlet earlier in the month... along with .30 cents
Nanny,fc264c3,t3_efrqlc,1577342108.0,It’s one thing if the parents have access to the camera footage. It is a gross breach of privacy and down right rude that they let other people view the footage
antiMLM,fc23t67,t1_fc23s6t,1577339275.0,I’m transitioning to management in the new year.. we’ll see how that goes
antiMLM,fc23pin,t1_fc23oao,1577339158.0,"Honestly, I had mostly great tippers and guests this season so I didn’t let it bother me"
antiMLM,fc1wxqj,t3_efpqgg,1577332255.0,Unfortunately I was not marked as safe. I got an arbonne lotion as a tip at my server job
dogs,fc1oyue,t3_efburx,1577325138.0,My dad is in charge of dog gifts. He got himself and my brother scotch. The dogs ‘got’ me a $100 gift card. And my mom got a massage
DuggarsSnark,fbx69vl,t1_fbwy2i8,1577171184.0,Yes
