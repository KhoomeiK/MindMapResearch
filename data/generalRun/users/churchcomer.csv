""fuck the parties""  
Dude, we operate in a party based system. It has two parties. Your comment is meaningless. One party is demonstrably better than the other when it comes to helping people, even if it is still corrupt and oppressive, and part of my comment was that there are people running who are trying to change this system. The idea that you have to choose a side isn't bullshit and it isn't some narrative, it is literally how reality works. If you say or do nothing when there is the option to help, you are only a contributor to the systems that are in place. The ones that are in place, no matter how much you don't like them, are oppressive. Take your immaturity elsewhere."
BlackPeopleTwitter,feedsgp,t1_feebsq6,1579031682.0,"Listen man, I am not gonna come out and duke on your chest about your political views. I would just suggest changing them. You have some naive ideas about politics and how they affect the lives of people if your above comments are genuine. Something I will say is that Emerson and Thoreau were far left politically. Emerson was also naive about how society operates, focusing on intelligence as the great operative of freedom when in fact this completely ignores history and human diversity. Thoreau espoused anarchist ideals and his work inspired prominent leftist political and social figures. Your choosing to align with the center only helps to perpetuate the status quo and oppression of those that are already oppressed. Emerson and Thoreau had some good ideas, but they are long gone and their ideas applied in a specific context that is vastly different from our own. Romanticizing or fetishizing old ""wise"" men from long ago is foolish. We may have dumbasses in government now (we do, but most of the current leaders aren't dumb, just unscrupulous), but we also have incredibly valuable and intelligent and genuine people running. Bernie is the best shot we have of having someone who espouses and manifests the current day versions of ideas that people like Thoreau and Emerson would have agreed with. Bernie is better though because he is in our context. If you stay in the center, you help the right. They are the ones that argue for policies that literally kill people, persecute people, and cast people into the throes of poverty. They have always been this way and they will continue to spread and deepen their corruption until the literal end of the world, this last point seen through their actions towards climate change. Change your views. Learn. Read as much as you can. There may be a large amount of relativity to what is ""right"" or ""correct"" politically, but there isn't if you orient those ideas around a specific set of principles. Orient yours around helping people and you will see that the center is not at all where you want to be.

Their product was only wildly successful because it was supported and powered by institutions like the internet, created from government funds. They constantly engage in unethical business practices to maximize profit. Unethical again. [They make software that aids in the killing of innocent civilians.](https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2019-google-military-contract-dilemma/) Ethical?

Your understanding of the stock market leaves out that they make money off of dividends and the value of the stock as employees and shareholders. You are conveniently leaving out how much money they make by artificially inflating their stock value, apparently (going by your comment) at their own peril (seeing as how that artificial inflation will pop at some point (but I am guessing they aren't going to bear any burden of those negative effects). The money doesn't have to be sitting in a Scrooge McDuck vault. Banks and accounts do just fine. Assets do too. Off shore accounts? Yup. Them too. Their worth and their fluid cash are so astronomically huge that their stocks don't even matter. You ever heard of a golden parachute? You ever heard of liquidity? These people have so much money that they could lose all of their non-cash assets and still be ungodly wealthy. Come on, man. wake up.

Your little hypothetical relies on taking the value and credit for many other peoples' work. This is to say nothing of the fact that that money or value going to you at that high of a rate isn't unethical itself. You getting to the point that you have a billion dollars in wealth is ridiculous. Your idea only became a reality because of a massive group of people that were willing to offer their labor. (Or unwillingly seeing as how they have no choice because they need food and shelter.) You can't not think that shit all you want. You are living in a delusion. Your hypothetical has no real world examples.

You are so sad, man. I know nothing about them? I know that they have so much money that they couldn't possibly spend it all in ten lifetimes. A hundred lifetimes. Money that came at the expense of others. It is *always* at the expense of others. You must be an idiot to say that you believe wealth inequality is a problem, but that judging those who are the literal manifestation of it aren't unethical. You *can* judge them. They are inherently unethical. Net worth isn't all that makes you a billionaire, and if you believe that, then you are so naive that it's ridiculous."
worldpolitics,fdx0nv6,t1_fdu5sjj,1578764143.0,"Okay, so let's break this down.  
1. You invent a product. - you did this with the help of countless publicly funded resources such as roads, public education, government laws that protect your patents, distribution networks that are powered by government-subsidized petrol industries, government postal services, etc. Your invention doesn't mean *you* did anything more than write some shit down. You also needed the help of others to create it unless you mastered every single part of the production/selling/distribution processes. *You* did such a small part that it is irrelevant. Taking credit for all of it is delusion.

2. Everybody wants that product. - This is pure hypothetical, but okay. Let's say you are part of creating a new and popular product. What goes into that? Marketing? Sales? Legal teams? Do you take care of every bit of that? No you don't. You are taking credit for it though.

3. I own the product. - First of all, massive oversimplification. You may own some of the rights, but without the production capacity manifested by a large group of people that go into bringing that product to reality, you are, again, taking credit for something that many people are responsible for. Second of all, only (maybe kinda), because of government enforced patents. 

4. You create a company. - Oh, wait, so now there are other people that are voluntarily (presumably, but in a capitalist society they have no choice because of needs for food and shelter, etc.) helping, but they aren't a part of the ownership even though they are apparently occupy indispensable roles? You get all of that credit? Did you do all of the things that go into creating a company? To maintain it? It's literally all you? Every role? Every job? You didn't ""create"" those jobs, people agreeing to do them (choice or no choice) created them. It is an agreement. You gonna take all the credit for that too?

5. Your company's value increases because people want your product. The value of your shares of the company skyrocket. You are a billionaire now. - Holy shit is this leap so goddamn big I almost fainted. The spaces between these are mind bogglingly huge. Your company's value increases, not only because of you, but because of your employees, who created the value. Not just you. Not even majority because of you. In fact, the more people you bring on, the less and less it is because of you. The value of your shares (okay so you are on apparently on the stock market now, something that you don't maintain and are not responsible for) skyrocket (lol. wow. okay. it's that simple in this fantasy then. all you still I take it?).

6. You are a billionaire now. - No decisions were made unethically? No cost cutting that negatively affected your workers (as has happened in literally every single example of a billionaire who made their money ""on the market?"")? No inequality between your income/wealth and that of your workers? All of them get a living wage and healthcare the same quality of yours? All of them have the ability to live as prosperous a life as you? After all, they are part of why your company's value ""skyrocketed"" and so they should get some of that value, no? What is the breakdown in how you have ethically gotten to this point seeing as how you created a ridiculous hypothetical that has no grounding in real life? You have your billions, but are there still children going hungry and homeless? You are a billionaire, and we have those now, but there are still these issues. How come you haven't solved them with your ""great ideas?"" Is it ethical that you continue to amass wealth while these issues affect people that you could presumably provide aid to at your own expense?  
[Here is the US government saying it would cost just 27% of your wealth to end chronic homelessness.](https://www.usich.gov/resources/uploads/asset_library/Ending_Chronic_Homelessness_in_2017.pdf) Why did you get to a billion dollars before maybe doing that? You think billionaires don't know about these things? Hell you could still be a multi-hundred millionaire (more money than the bottom 50% of Americans will see in their whole lives) and fix that problem for the whole country. Still ethical?  


Oh so now you only own 20%, huh? Yes, economics is zero-sum. Why the hell do you think that we talk about it that way? What percentage of Trump's tax cuts went to the rich? That's a zero-sum scenario. How much of the wealth is concentrated? [Did you know that the top 10% owns more than 80% of the wealth of the stock market?](https://www.npr.org/2017/03/01/517975766/while-trump-touts-stock-market-many-americans-left-out-of-the-conversation) They have that while others don't.

AskHistorians,fdrur1j,t1_fdqky5j,1578690091.0,"When I took Latin American history in undergrad, there was a concept my professor called the ""Incan Third."" The number 3 was very culturally important to the Inca. Roughly one third of everything that was produced in the empire went to the state to be placed in storehouses for distribution to those in need and to be saved for times of crisis. Sometimes citizens gave as much as two-thirds, but there was rarely ever a person that went without because of how the Inca administered their resources. However, they were extremely oppressive of their vassals and their entire society was pretty much based around colonization.

Dude, you are reaching for some fucking straws. The dude is a professor of sociology who teaches sociology classes on law and incarceration. Legal studies is what he calls it himself. Historian is not what that is, [and his courseload does not include any history courses](https://soci.ucalgary.ca/manageprofile/profiles/120-105432/courses). Try again.

I already addressed his work. That book is a criminological and sociological analysis of the history of the nineteenth-century Canadian carceral state. Sociologists *have* to examine history for their discipline. This does not make them historians any more than psychologists studying history makes them historians. Your argument is sloppy. Try again.

I didn't ""well ackshually"" shit. Someone called him an historian. He is a professor of sociology, not a professor of history, in a school where there is both a history and a sociology department. I made a small comment that didn't matter and at least 7 people got butthurt about it. I also think that Petersen is a fucking grifting piece of shit whose research is absolute garbage even in his own field. He absolutely shouldn't be allowed to be used as a resource in history or sociology. Your little comment referring to the idea that I might disagree with this sentiment is baseless.

I know what ""sociology"" means in a collegiate context. I also know what qualifies a person as ***an*** ""historian."" I am an historian, which you would know if you looked at my post history, you arrogant fucking dolt."

ENLIGHTENEDCENTRISM,fdopbyb,t1_fdoiosv,1578609866.0,"    Now go back and reread the title of his book you linked, and maybe ask why he specifies ""talking to non-historians"" in the title.

First of all, it's an article not a book, so how about you go fuck yourself with that one.

  
Second of all, he's literally a professor of sociology. His work includes historical research, which is normal for every sociologist. But, he is not in the history department, and he is not a history faculty member. 

He calls himself a historian in that article, but then goes on to say that he teaches legal studies. To call him a historian is a vast oversimplification. History and sociology are inherently intertwined, and it is widely known in the history community that there is a long debate about whether or not they are separate disciplines. He is a sociology professor who teaches legal studies and publishes analyses on prisons and incarceration. Historian is an actual professional title, one that he does not have. His twitter bio is not how you identify whether he is an historian or not."

It was 48 degrees outside and the line into the venue was [a quarter mile long](https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/omaha.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/1/a7/1a7d3f48-e168-11e5-8f4a-f32dd6a31625/56d87910dd6c0.image.jpg?resize=750%2C985) (that picture was taken about 200 yards from the entrance) an hour before starting time. I waited 2.5 hours to get in and was about 60ft from the door when they cutoff due to capacity. Hundreds, if not more than a thousand people waited for hours in the freezing temps to hear Bernie speak in person, only to get turned away. [Bernie heard about the massive crowd outside and decided to come out and speak to us](https://ja3ga476chj1nc6csy2j81c7-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Be_B_Nebraska.jpg), postponing his own event inside by 20 minutes. We all crowded to front of the building and they pulled out a sound system so we could hear him. It was really an amazing thing for him to do. While I was in line I spoke to dozens of people about why they were there (this was in a very conservative, midwestern state) and they mostly said that they thought he was too good to be true, but wanted to see what the fuss was about. Him coming outside convinced at least four of the people that I had stayed around that he was at least a great person who gave a damn. This isn't some amazing, dramatic story, but it is a pretty good illustration of him and his supporters (here were a ton there even though it was a conservative place), as well as how important it is for his ideas to have visibility.  
He has a crazy ability with being able to connect with people."
