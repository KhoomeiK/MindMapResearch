Just the other day, some prick cut me off as he flew across two lanes on the highway to get on the exit he wanted. He almost got rammed by a semi and he zipped in front of me only inches from my front bumper. I was fortunate enough to not have any cars behind me because I slammed on my brakes. Thinking about it still makes my blood boil. I'm getting a dash cam for my car."

The specimens I’ve seen have either been way too damaged or are incredibly overpriced. This specimen somehow had all the quality I could ask for, but was dirt-cheap (at least as compared to the vast majority of other similar specimens). Super gemmy, super glassy, and just the slightest hint of green color what my dad described as “coke bottle green”. Just an awesome little example of this material and I’m thrilled to have it in my collection!"

We also fully vet (care for any illness/injury the kitten has, vaccines, medications, ect) and spay/neuter our kittens so an adoption fee helps cover the costs. We foster between ten and twenty kittens every year and they all get loving homes with people who really care about them.

We also have a dog who is very sweet and loving (she was a mother to twelve puppies before we rescued her!) so we introduce her to our kittens to get them used to being around dogs. My worst fear is adopting out a kitten into a home with a dog that hates cats!"

Dark bluish-purple (almost black) fluorite from Cave in Rock

Pink fluorite with pyrite. This was actually a free gift specimen that I was not expecting! No label, but I think this is Moroccan due to the pyrite druze and pink zoning.

Blue fluorite from Elmwood Mine. Most of the time, you see those classic purple cubes (I have quite a few of those!), but this is my first one that has more of a blue color. The luster is also glassier than what is typically seen from this locality!

Finally, we have the specimen I have been most excited about: a colorless, glassy cube from Penfield, NY! NY fluorites are among the most optically clear in the world. Ice-like, sharp, and you can see clear through it all the way down to the matrix.

I’ll post more pictures and video of these specimens later. Just wanted to get them all on my hand for a group photo!"
