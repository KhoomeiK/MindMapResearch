MMA,ff6ly5b,t1_ff6ejhn,1579630022.0,You do squeeze with the choking hand (hence the name) but that’s what I meant by bite. Both sides are biting together like sets of teeth around the neck if that helps.
MMA,ff6bydn,t1_ff6ak70,1579623854.0,"Well you're not pulling that arm back into his neck, you're pushing your other arm into the back of his neck. The bite is once you have locked in the position (choke hand in the elbow of the cutting arm, cutting arm pressing on neck). It's like with an arm bar, the bite is once the arm is fully extended and you can feel the pressure between your arms holding your opponents arm and your hips pushing on the arm too.

I don't see how it's possible to choke them if you are pushing with your hand. There would be too much of a gap. Do you have any examples from the UFC events you're watching?

MMA,ff69l2n,t1_ff63xkp,1579622329.0,"Tbf I don't really get what you mean. 

""your arm that is behind the opponents head is supposed to be placed so that your hand can basically reach your other arm/shoulder and then you press forward with your forearm part"" This is right. Your left hand, on the choking arm in this example, should be reaching for the right tricep. Your right forearm then comes over the left hand and chops into the back of your opponent's neck to create a bite between the left inner elbow and right forearm.

""using their hand to push the opponents forward into the choke"" I'm not sure what you mean by this though? Are you saying the right hand is pushing the back of the opponent's head or something?"
