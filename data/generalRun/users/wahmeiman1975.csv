Limited to 1 coffee a day. 
Eat more veg carrots, brocolli, cauliflower, beetroot, kale etc. 
More fruit like bananas, apples and blueberries. 
I avoid orange and lemon because of citrus content aggravating my stomach. 
Limited chocolate, just the dark variety. 
Changed from white bread to seeded or granary loaf. 
More fish and white meat plus potatoes and rice. 
Actimel or yakult immune system yoghurts. 
Walnuts are also good and no alcohol whatsoever. 
Hope this helps."

I understand what you mean. 
Been going through it recently myself but a month later we have let another cute little face into our hearts. 
I know nothing will ever replace the dog you have lost but if you do decide to get another dog, look at it as honouring your lost dogs memory. 
Hope this helps."
