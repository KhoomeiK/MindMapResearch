I’m curious as to why headline thumbnail used a picture of a player busting, instead of hitting 21?"
facepalm,ffrq6vo,t3_euv47f,1580163375.0,"A man sued Pepsi by claiming he found a mouse skeleton in his can. Pepsi won the law suit by stating an entire mouse skeleton would dissolve in a Mountain Dew can in X amount of days. The can in question was older than the timeframe Pepsi gave.

The reason I bring this up is because people are already drinking poison. So a lil extra caffeine or natural sweetener won’t hurt you too much more than a regular can."

AskReddit,fdimc75,t3_eled64,1578446105.0,"It drives me insane how people recommend speaking to a therapist every time someone has to make a semi  hard decision. Someone will have a kid who is a prick or an absent parent, a recent death in the family and someone always Recommends therapy."
teenagers,fcm0stg,t3_ehsatv,1577761265.0,"The fuck is this shit?!?! Being born in 1999 doesn’t make you a 90’s kid. You grew up in the 2000’s. 88-93, maybe 94 by some standards. You’re all garbage for upvoting this.

Go ahead a downvote me, I’ve seen what makes your generation upvote."
atheism,fclxwol,t3_ehfoe4,1577759168.0,"1) while you’re correct, it was unnecessary. Jesus could snap his fingers and they all would drop dead.

2) 2nd Samuel  13 tells a tale of a man named Ambon  who raped his half sister. Their dad found out and didn’t care. So quoting the Bible isn’t a good choice.  

3) Jesus sent bears to attack children for making fun of a bald man ( 2 Kings 2:23 ). So if Jesus wants someone dead, he’s gonna kill them.

4) for S’s and G’s here’s a few more  awful things about bible im sure you haven’t read. Judges 11:30- where god allows a dude to turn his daughter into a sacrifice.
Psalm 137:8 - where Jesus says it’s cool to bash certain babies against rocks  

5) on a random side note, Christians who eat shellfish and have tattoos deserve the same treatment the church gives gay people.  Leviticus 9:10 and Leviticus 19:28"
