Some of those signs you can see until it's too late. All while dealing with impatient and distracted drivers checking cellphones. 

On top of that shit, 100% of GPS systems do not take into consideration weight limit, and truck prohibited roads. The GPS always tried to give you the ""shortest possible route"" but good luck arguing that in court. I have for years.

Cartalk,ff4iqw7,t3_erinvv,1579564589.0,"Not ideal to all or most, but what I did, I got the idea from an episode of That 70's Show, in which the main character's car was ridiculously loud because of a crappy muffler.

I then looked into it and learned that the mufflers purpose is to literally muffle the sound of the explosions coming out of the engine.

I wanted my car to sound a little more aggressive, but I didn't want to cut into or damage my muffler. So I did the next best thing and drilled a few holes in the exhaust tube that connects to the muffler, not the muffler(box) itself. Like 6 or 7 holes, and it gave it a louder sound, yet nothing crazy. AND as a bonus, now I can make those sweet pop sounds easier, as the exhaust gases don't have to pass through the ""maze"" in the muffler. They escape out of the holes  just a few inches before the muffler. 

I did this: https://youtu.be/y5gdUcHVSJI


Don't do this: https://youtu.be/y8TBE-VhRTY


They'll call it RICE or whatever but ultimately as long as you like your vehicle, everyone else can fuck off.

And if you aren't satisfied, you can always patch up the holes with stuff found at the auto parts store until you decide on an actual exhaust kit.
