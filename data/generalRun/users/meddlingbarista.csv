This ruling means that a chicken Caesar wrap it not a sandwich, but I don't think it precludes an open faced sandwich from being called one.

 I could, therefore, argue that a hoagie (an open faced, loaf based consumable in which toppings are *placed* atop it before it is folded) and a French bread pizza (an open faced, loaf based consumable in which toppings are *melted* atop it, even though it is not commonly folded) are sandwiches under this ruling, but wraps, non-french bread pizzas, and Sloppy Joes (manwich style, not New Jersey style)  are not.

I'm not sure about hamburgers and hot dogs under this ruling.

Edit: sorry, the judge said stuffed, not wrapped. A Hot Pocket, therefore, is not a sandwich.

Also, the author of this article is an idiot. He claims this precedent removes all legal distinction between a taco and a burrito, which is just absurd. The only  thing they legally have in common, according to this ruling, is neither is a sandwich.

Double edit: apparently, someone doesn't like the sandwich law hot fire I'm spitting."

But one thing I will say is that Gordon Ramsay started working for Marco Pierre White when he was 17, and not only did he learn how to cook and become a well-regarded chef in his own right, but he put up with a degree of emotional and physical abuse in that kitchen that you and I can barely fathom. He did work. He earned his Michelin stars (at one point, he hadmore than anyone who ever lived).

So, now that he's mega-rich and has a media empire, if he wants his children to have to at least participate in a Cargo Cult version of working for their money, I'm somewhat happier with than the alternative.

Seems like you're angry, too. I'm sorry if you're angry. I know how difficult anger can be, I've struggled with it. 

I'm sorry if you aren't angry and I'm mistaken. It can be easy to project thoughts and motivations onto strangers, especially when we have only text to go on. If I've done that I apologise.

The only things I can know for sure are:

That you've decided to be unkind, by your own admission, to a stranger who has already admitted their error. 

That when a third party hinted that you're being a bit extreme, you doubled down. That doesn't seem productive.

You could call out someone's hypocrisy while remaining kind, you know. And if you aren't capable of that, then it's worthwhile to ask yourself whether your opinion deserves to be shared.
