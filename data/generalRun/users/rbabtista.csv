homelab,fdk9ah0,t1_fdk85cv,1578498985.0,Thanks for the suggestion on the PIR bro! Indeed DHT22 is way more accurate. I'll probably will buy one when I start developing.

RASPBERRY_PI_PROJECTS,fc9e7j1,t1_fc8bp3k,1577551318.0,"It is well secured using that case. It has 4 screws to mount the Pi on the case. CPU temps are low I guess, never really check the number. I use a 5v fan as an exhaust on top of the Pi."
raspberry_pi,fc9dzpt,t1_fc99aac,1577551213.0,Definetely the bottleneck is in my old router. Transfer rate barely touches 7MB/s. I don't see it as a problem though. Rarely using my samba server for doing streams.

pihole,fc9d4yj,t1_fc7qk9y,1577550805.0,"So cool! Some of the terms you mentioned are first heard for me, need to learn those sometimes. Anyway, Pi4 is indeed awesome for it's performance!"
raspberry_pi,fc9clyi,t1_fc7och7,1577550574.0,I did ran it without a cooler when the case haven't arrived yet for a couple if weeks. It seems fine and running well.
raspberry_pi,fc9c7vy,t1_fc7k2oi,1577550414.0,Future project that I haven't got the time to do it yet.
raspberry_pi,fc9c47q,t1_fc7dw2s,1577550374.0,Cool! Would love to see a picture of it.
raspberry_pi,fc9c13u,t1_fc7kdry,1577550338.0,"I don't, actually since there is no important data there."
raspberry_pi,fc9bwsa,t1_fc7ns97,1577550284.0,Correct. The black brick is my laptop charger though.

pihole,fc77a3m,t1_fc74yvq,1577499432.0,It's a PIR motion detector sensor. I've been planning to use it but have no time to do it yet. The plan is to use it to detect if a person come or leave the room.
RASPBERRY_PI_PROJECTS,fc775md,t1_fc76ssr,1577499339.0,"Ahh, never tried OpenCV on a Pi before. How's the performance? You are doing a real time image processing right?

Oh, and you might also want to read about TensorFlow, see if it may help."

RASPBERRY_PI_PROJECTS,fc71x7m,t1_fc6zam4,1577495357.0,"It's a DHT-11 and PIR motion sensor :)

  
The plan is just to play with it and learning it by developing a motion detector that logs to the database each time anyone come inside my room.  But I haven't got the time to do it."
RASPBERRY_PI_PROJECTS,fc71rzj,t1_fc6ztd2,1577495246.0,"I think I'm not blocking it since the holes for router's airflow are in the sides and underneath it. If you notice, my router are a bit high from the table because I prop it with some unused Pi's acrylic case to help the heat spread.
