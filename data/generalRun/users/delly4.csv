AmItheAsshole,ff94lov,t3_es6cjd,1579704710.0,"NTA - You got her eating didn’t you? Anyway the closest living relatives of Tyrannosaurus rex are birds such as chickens and ostriches, according to research published in Science (and promptly reported in the New York Times).

She’s four years old. I presume your wife doesn’t play along with Santa Claus or the Tooth Fairy either then as it’s all lies. Lies I tell you! Lies!"

AmItheAsshole,fdetwjn,t3_ekvy1l,1578346514.0,NTA and so funny. Should have taken longer to move the car just to be difficult. It’s your drive. If you don’t fancy moving your car you don’t have to.
AmItheAsshole,fde0mae,t3_ektig5,1578328481.0,NTA. He can go by himself. Or can’t the MIL visit you guys so you’re in your own territory? It would give you the upper hand and would be less disruptive to your child.

facepalm,fcyy4yi,t3_ejgrp9,1578089656.0,I must be the only childish one that finds her name slightly amusing.
AmItheAsshole,fcx8mpk,t3_ejbcsz,1578055549.0,"NTA. I used to be really sociable and have tons of friends. Now I’ve changed and I don’t enjoy socialising at all. I just started declining invites and not contacting people. Some people just dropped off but some kept coming back. Those ones I was honest with as they were worried what they had done wrong. Some got it and said they felt the same but others I know their feelings were hurt. I feel bad for them but at least they know now. I went for a couple of years still hanging out with them even though I didn’t want to and I was just miserable. In the end it’s the best thing to do just to be honest. 

So if you think you’re friend will wonder what’s going on you should tell here. If she doesn’t understand at least you tried."

facepalm,fcjoriz,t3_eh9mbj,1577697041.0,A neighbour went round our neighbourhood telling everyone we had won the lottery and spent it on our house. It wasn’t even an amazing house and I have no idea where she got this from. Apparently she was jealous and didn’t like us because of it. For the 10 years we lived there we never spoke to her and we only found out the day we left about it as our friend asked us if it was true.
AmItheAsshole,fch05en,t3_eh84ga,1577645877.0,NTA. I wonder if your uncle would be happy knowing that your parents left you to baby sit when they had agreed to do it themselves? I wouldn’t be.
