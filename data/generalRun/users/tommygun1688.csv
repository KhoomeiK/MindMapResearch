But moving away from your post history, because that's not a fair way to win this argument...

You want a candidate who:

- would implement universal government healthcare 
- wants hugely increased gun control
- would increase taxes
- supports affirmative action over free market hiring and admissions
- wants increased social programs (like welfare)
- thinks looking into giving reparations for slavery is a good idea
- wants to increase regulations on industry
- wants increased regulations for financial markets
- has had NUMEROUS campaign employees who support RADICAL Marxism, including gulags! (See project veritas videos)

Yet you think he's the libertarian choice? That's nonsense. Your position that Bernie is the better call between the two major party candidates for libertarians is simply untenable.

I personally see eye to eye with him on many of the issues that he's wanting to address with these policies. I think they're important problems, which need to be addressed. The difference is, I think there's better ways to solve them than what he's proposing (many of which we've tried and have failed, or even exacerbated the problems).

I'd rather have neither candidate. And I personally will never tell anyone who I'm voting for (I consider myself somewhere between a libertarian and a classical liberal); maybe Bernie will prove to be more moderate than he has seemed so far, but I doubt it."

That said... I'm all about free trade, if it's actually free. The Chinese predatory trade practices meant that we usually can not compete, even when we were/are better and cheaper at manufacturing the good in question (vitamin c production is a great example of this). If the Chinese need to be brought to heel, so that we can ACTUALLY have free trade, and they will stop crushing our industry with government intervention and central economic planning, so be it.

Saunders has made his stance abundantly clear on gun control. He wants to ban ""assault weapons"" but probably can't give a coherent definition of what that means.

And he is a strong supporter of VAT. Which is, in practice an extremely regressive tax plan (as has been seen in Europe) that in actuality taxes the poor more than the rich. But I see you conveniently didn't address the tax issue I brought up.

And quoting an article from vox is no better than fox... In fact, due to vox's stance on media's most important roll being gate keeping, as opposed to just reporting the news as it comes, I'd say it's worse ( https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=VzoZf4IAfAc ).

I was a fan of Bernie in 2016, at the time I thought he seemed more genuine than any of the other candidates. But after seeing how he cracked under pressure from the DNC, after Hillary and her cronies cheated him out of the primaries, I don't think I could vote for him.
