magicTCG,fgep1qw,t1_fgeo2yx,1580705308.0,"D&T is an outlier though and many legacy decks get away with historical or odd naming conventions due to the age of the format and how decks have evolved a lot over time.  Some deck names change and some stay the same.  D&T is an example of one that has changed over time whereas various flavours of delver decks are no longer known as Canadian Thresh.

Whether the deck name changes with the times or the deck changes whilst retaining an outdated name is difficult to predict.

New decks referencing older deck names is just another example of this.  occasionally they will catch on but probably not.
