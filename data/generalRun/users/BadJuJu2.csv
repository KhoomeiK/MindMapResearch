aww,ffde280,t1_ffdcdaz,1579818925.0,"This could also be on somebody’s farm/barn. Not every barn is a state of the art structure. Most structures are built on concrete....the dogs are not in wire cages with other mothers and puppies lined up. 
It’s just a regular farm dog that had puppies. Put down your pick forks and torches for Christ sake."

books,fddrlkx,t3_ekuodw,1578322149.0,"Giving him a book like Feminism for Dummies or Fight the Patriarchy is just inviting him to take it and troll you with it. I’ve had a friend get one and he would post pictures on FB of using the book for a door stop, toilet paper, target practice, fuel for his fireplace.  
 If he  grown their is probably not much can be done now. Like politics at family gathering, it’s probably a subject best left alone...unless he troll you first...then by all means. 
Probably calm discussion about feminism  alone with him might be better. I wouldn’t  do anything that could  seen as nagging, shaming, preaching...it’s only going to reinforce his views/bias. But that would also depend on what your version of “misogyny” is. I’ve seen guys labeled that for simply forgetting to use “prounouns” Ms or other minor stuff."
