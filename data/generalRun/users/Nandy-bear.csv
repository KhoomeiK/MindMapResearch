TwoXChromosomes,ff62obi,t1_ff3mmbq,1579617608.0,"I think you should ask yourself as to why, in such a well defined situation, you'd make such a huge leap in logic and apply it to every decision. 

And there's no way in hell anyone can think the line ""Is it possible you value a man's opinion on yourself more than a woman's?"" wouldn't be taken as it is presented. You took a singular situation, a very narrow and defined situation, and then asked if I hold bias in every single decision, based on that singular thing.

But, let's assume your question was innocent, and for some reason you didn't see the incredibly insulting implications in what you were asking.

> therefore would consider another man more experienced in maleness than a woman

You're conflating opinions and expertise with simply something I find flattering. It has nothing to do with maleness, it has nothing to do with any sort of gender bias. I don't care about ""a man's opinion on a man"" (again, what's with applying singular things to broad subjects ?), I simply value this 1 thing, about 1 thing, from 1 certain group. It's very defined.

I'll be honest, I'm kinda torn. I try to believe the best in everyone, and if someone says they didn't mean it then I try to take that as truth. But cmon mate, your arguments are presented in such an accusatory manner. ""You thought this tiny one thing, so does that mean it applies to everything ?"" type questions are rarely asked innocently, and reek of pre-judgement.

EDIT: Oh shit I never actually answered the question. It's not that I value their opinion any more than anyone else, but when I was younger I used to tend bar in a gay bar and there is a subsection of the gay community who mainly concern themselves with physical attraction, and put a lot of effort into it. When you've got people like that who care about it so much saying they find you attractive, it's like holy shit that's a damn fine compliment right there. Validation from the pickiest bastards there are, that's pretty much all it is ha. Nothing about valuing their opinion, it's just complimenting, that's all."

My nan had died a few weeks before, maybe months, and they were together 70 years or so, so he was just like..nah fuck this. Anywho he goes to the doc because he's backed up, and they tell him ""holy shit, you're drinking on this medication ?! Never mind the constipation, if you keep drinking it'll kill you"".

He doubled the amount he drank.

12-18 beers/day, taking the meds, obviously in agony but to him this is a marathon and by god he can see that fucking finishing line, my Nan waiting with a medal! So he keeps on drinking. And drinking. We get a second recycling bin because even with crushing the can it gets filled up so quick. We all know what he's doing and the men (I know that sounds super sexist but it just worked out like that), me, my cousins and uncles, kept quiet, because all of us understood his situation.

So anyway he'd been doing all this drinking, fuck knows when the last time he took a dump was. And then the words came. ""Oooh fellas I can feel it this is the big one!"" before running up the stairs to take what he thought was going to be a massive dump. They were in fact his last words.

Died on the toilet! What a legend. Went out on his own terms, and considering how immature he was, I know it amused him no end that he died trying to take a wicked shit."

Why ? It's a game, it's entertainment, you find out how to best utilise it and get the most fun out of it your way. If that includes not fighting the same monster dozens, or even hundreds, of times, then let em. I don't see how them buying a part or grinding a monster 100x in a row for the part has any difference.

And there's no way in hell anyone can think the line ""Is it possible you value a man's opinion on yourself more than a woman's?"" wouldn't be taken as it is presented. You took a singular situation, a very narrow and defined situation, and then asked if I hold bias in every single decision, based on that singular thing.

But, let's assume your question was innocent, and for some reason you didn't see the incredibly insulting implications in what you were asking.

> therefore would consider another man more experienced in maleness than a woman

You're conflating opinions and expertise with simply something I find flattering. It has nothing to do with maleness, it has nothing to do with any sort of gender bias. I don't care about ""a man's opinion on a man"" (again, what's with applying singular things to broad subjects ?), I simply value this 1 thing, about 1 thing, from 1 certain group. It's very defined.

I'll be honest, I'm kinda torn. I try to believe the best in everyone, and if someone says they didn't mean it then I try to take that as truth. But cmon mate, your arguments are presented in such an accusatory manner. ""You thought this tiny one thing, so does that mean it applies to everything ?"" type questions are rarely asked innocently, and reek of pre-judgement.

EDIT: Oh shit I never actually answered the question. It's not that I value their opinion any more than anyone else, but when I was younger I used to tend bar in a gay bar and there is a subsection of the gay community who mainly concern themselves with physical attraction, and put a lot of effort into it. When you've got people like that who care about it so much saying they find you attractive, it's like holy shit that's a damn fine compliment right there. Validation from the pickiest bastards there are, that's pretty much all it is ha. Nothing about valuing their opinion, it's just complimenting, that's all."

Anywho he goes to the doc because he's backed up, and they tell him ""holy shit, you're drinking on this medication ?! Never mind the constipation, if you keep drinking it'll kill you"".

He doubled the amount he drank.

12-18 beers/day, taking the meds, obviously in agony but to him this is a marathon and by god he can see that fucking finishing line, my Nan waiting with a medal! So he keeps on drinking. And drinking. We get a second recycling bin because even with crushing the can it gets filled up so quick. We all know what he's doing and the men (I know that sounds super sexist but it just worked out like that), me, my cousins and uncles, kept quiet, because all of us understood his situation.

So anyway he'd been doing all this drinking, fuck knows when the last time he took a dump was. And then the words came. ""Oooh fellas I can feel it this is the big one!"" before running up the stairs to take what he thought was going to be a massive dump. They were in fact his last words.

Died on the toilet! What a legend. Went out on his own terms, and considering how immature he was, I know it amused him no end that he died trying to take a wicked shit."

But I'm guilty of that in SO MANY ways. The worst is open world games with side quests or stuff to do, I get paranoid about missing content so I do everything side first, then when I do the main quest I'm like 20 levels over recommended and just cakewalk through it."

>If people in this thread have issues hunting the same monster over and over for that one rare part, they should probably consider playing a different game.

Why ? It's a game, it's entertainment, you find out how to best utilise it and get the most fun out of it your way. If that includes not fighting the same monster dozens, or even hundreds, of times, then let em. I don't see how them buying a part or grinding a monster 100x in a row for the part has any difference. What if they work ? You have nfi if they spent that 8-10h playing the game and grinding the monster, or went to work, came home, and just bought the part.

There's no justification for using cheats WITH other online players, but if you wanna just get the gear after a reasonable amount of time, then eh, I got no problem with that.

Although taking end game gear into a low level hunt is just super douchey and is only done by people who want to show off - cheaters or not."

It works OK, but really basic things, like holding pans, or holding food I'm chopping, feels awkward and hurts (cramps up) after a few seconds. I miss having 2 working hands :("

And don't get me wrong, I absolutely do that myself - I'm not a big fan of using the trainer for all the parts and gems because it feels like I'm getting too much, but using the shop to buy the odd part I'm missing feels like I'm not taking too much away. Like, it's a grindy game, that's the nature of the beast, and it's not something I'm interested in getting absorbed in. But I do want to leave SOME of it open, and the trainer is just like ""lol nope here's everything"""

The chipped PSX got me into PCs (because of piracy) and I've not really had a console since.
