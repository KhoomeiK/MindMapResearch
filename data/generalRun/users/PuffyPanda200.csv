insanepeoplefacebook,ffg7lx0,t3_etcxhl,1579900191.0,"I went to university in Montana after growing up in Seattle. There were some of my friends that were home schooled and one of my parents taught at the home school resource center (a school for home school kids if their parents couldn't do the math, for example). 

In MT I met a number of students that were home schooled, more than normal but not super noticeable. The more I met these people the more I realized: the home school kids were all born again Christians. Effectively their parents had taken them out of school so they wouldn't learn about evolution and dinosaurs. The irony is that there are a ton of dinos found in MT."

The options aren't to let the animal live or hunt the animal. The options are to either have the animal die of old age and not obtain conservation funds or have the hunter kill the animal and obtain the funds. 

[This](https://www.cnn.com/2015/05/19/africa/namibia-rhino-hunt/index.html) is a good example of the system working as intended. The hunter paid 350K just for the permit not including guides, equipment, accommodation, etc."

todayilearned,ff7iw56,t3_ery2yg,1579650601.0,"There are a number of cases, especially in the US, where it is obvious that the wrong person was convicted. This case is really strange as Evans defiantly appeared guilty at the start. I am just reading the wiki so if it is wrong then I am wrong. Here is a summary starting from the ""Events leading to Evans's arrest"":

Evans contacts the Police (P) and informs them that his wife is dead after drinking something intended to induce abortion (abortion is illegal at the time). Evans claims to have disposed of her body in a sewer. 

The P search the sewer and don't find anything. Evans is re-questioned and states that Christie was performing an abortion on his wife and that she died. 

The P eventually search the house and find the wife and daughter strangled and hid in a shed. The P confront Evans and he confesses to the murders. 

After this the trail takes place. I have skipped over details and questions have been raised if the events happened the way they are described (did the P lie about what Evans said). There are probably better examples of obviously wrongful convictions."

todayilearned,fekz3ez,t1_fekwuo7,1579210594.0,"Eminent domain (ED) allows for the compulsory purchase of assets (typically property) by the FED to serve a ""public use"". Typically the public use has been infrastructure related (buying an area to build a road). 

HOWEVER, the use of ED is NOT exclusively for infrastructure projects. For example, Centralia Pennsylvania was bought bought because a fire had broken out at the mine underneath and the area was not safe for people to live in. The city of Oakland even tried to use ED to claim the Raiders football team (although this was deemed to violate the interstate commerce clause). 

Giving the land in question back to the tribes because they were granted it in a treaty appears to me to be ""public use"" as the tribe would be using the land.

What follows is based on personal experience. 

Generally the schools in the North end were good for all levels. The elementary schools in the South end were good but there were some middle schools and high schools (Rainier Beach and Cleveland especially) that were known to be bad to terrible. 

Just as a note, richer parents tend to raise better performing students (this comment is not meant to offend). The Mercer Island school district will always out perform the Seattle one just because of the demographics involved. I would make the argument that sending your kid to Franklin (a South Seattle high school that performs OK) vs sending your kid to Mercer High won't make that much of a difference for your kid specifically.
