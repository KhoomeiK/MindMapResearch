I’m just exhausted by life and seeing weaker people/things get exploited over and over again, that ive come to the conclusion that ultimately this is what happens. Just look at how modern civilisation has been sustained upon the death of billions of tortured factory farmed animals, or how we have modern technology because of slavery, exploitation and capitalism.. and we’ve arrived here, well fed and entertained, but at the expense of so many others before us."

And yeah you can feel how you like, but ultimately it’s up to the person themselves if they want to free themselves from the tyranny of existence. If it’s selfish or not is a matter of perspective."
SuicideBereavement,feppzg9,t1_fepehxe,1579327427.0,"Nope, no one ever consented to be brought into existence, so everyone has a choice on if they want to take themselves out of life. It’s selfish of you to believe people should stick around even if they have felt like shit for most their lives."

If you don’t want professional help because you think they’re doing it for profit (tbh they’re not even paid that much so its not really the case) then how are you going to move forward if you can’t accept any routes to self improvement? Are you just gonna keep complaining forever?"

Drugs,fe855he,t1_fe842oh,1578922697.0,"Honestly I’m surprised you are saying all this because it shows you in a different light to your comments which initially started this discussion. I do know that feeling and it probably has affected my mental health, but I still try to understand the world in regards to power dynamics and will always support progressive policies/ideas, even if they seem unfeasible because of changing political climate. I agree that you should focus first and foremost on the people close to you in life, but I will always call out prejudice/dodgy beliefs when I see them, because if we don’t speak out for the oppressed, one day when shit really hits the fan no one will speak for us."

Life is about balance, and socialists will always exist to balance out the inherent human greed and exploitation which permeates society. Also it’s not true that we are completely selfish animals, we have evolved to be communal over solitary/individual, and have an inbuilt sense of unfairness/injustice for this reason."

BBC’s propaganda is much more sophisticated and thus more insidious, which makes it palatable and effective. If you have ‘no idea what I’m talking about’ then maybe you should be more critical about the media you are consuming."

How you can tell is his bone structure, Charles has distinctly close-set eyes which his son has strongly inherited, all other features have high similarities (nose, mouth, hairline, jawline). If you look at Charles when he was younger, the resemblance is stronger. Only thing James Hewitt shares with Harry is skin/hair colour really, and only a fool would be tricked by that."
worldnews,fe1k0a8,t1_fdy3ql1,1578827520.0,"I’m from the UK, I witnessed how the BBC handled the election like a state propaganda machine. They were caught doctoring footage of Johnson in a favourable light, but did the opposite for Corbyn. The Labour Party were constantly called into question about antisemitism, yet I hardly heard about the Conservative Party’s issues with racism/islamophobia/homophobia aswell as antisemitism (they had a holocaust denier in their ranks). The BBC usually had unequal distribution on their talk panels, where conservative/conservative-lite people were regularly given more representation. On a more general note, they report on benign things that would distract the masses from any kind of real material change, whilst ignoring certain issues that may pose a threat to the establishment e.g. I have hardly seen any coverage of the mass French yellow vests protests all year, even though they are our European neighbours. The BBC may not practice blatant propaganda, but the subtle kind can be more insidious."

We still have a long way to go, but I’m saying if he’s been taught that word as a kid, can you blame him for using it?"
PublicFreakout,fdun5lq,t1_fdulpjp,1578735633.0,"I’m not gay so I can’t speak for that community, but as a female CSA survivor I feel abit uncomfortable that there was more mention on the fact that his actions were homosexual, than that his actions were abusive/paedophilic, 
because certain homophobic people wrongly see the two as being linked in someway. But he’s probably just so angry in the moment that he needs to let it out, which is understandable."
