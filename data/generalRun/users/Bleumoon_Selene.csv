AskReddit,ffv4ehj,t1_ffv49g5,1580255410.0,Not sure. Different recommendation I suppose. Those are the minimums of course. People have made much bigger enclosures for their hamsters.
AskReddit,ffv44cl,t3_ev67eq,1580255222.0,"That hamsters are perfectly fine with those store bought cages like Critter Trail. They are not. If your hamster tries to escape, climbs up the bars, chews on the bars, etc, then it is stressed and needs a bigger cage. Think about if you were stuck in a prison cell with a treadmill. You'd get stressed after a while. 

In the wild hamsters can roam 5-10 miles a night. Wheels help with this, but they need a large cage to explore too. About 450 square inches of floor space in US and I think around 620 square inches in the UK, but I'm not sure about that one. 

They also need a lot of bedding. At least three to six inches deep because they're burrowing animals. 

For more info, check out Munchie's Place on YouTube, Erin's Animals on YouTube, or r/hamsters."

TooAfraidToAsk,ffiadk3,t1_ffi7spy,1579969144.0,"No I haven't. I did say we are third world in some aspects, not that the nation itself actually is. 

But I'm bad at words so here's a [Rolling Stone article](https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/six-ways-america-is-like-a-third-world-country-100466/amp/) that sums it up better than I could. 

I don't mean to imply that America is at the same level as any given third world country but you have to admit for a developed nation it's citizens often get the short end of the stick when we have no universal healthcare, crime is high, wages are so low its citizens often can't afford to live on their own. 

In fact many Americans are opting out of having children and our [birth rates are dropping at record rates](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/17/us/us-birthrate-decrease.html) because we just cannot afford to give our children a good quality of life, let alone ourselves. 

We aren't officially a third world nation but it's not the top notch first world nation some people think it is. 

We have freedom of speech though, and gay marriage, so we have that going for us.

I hear over and over about boys and men basically getting their thoughts and feelings shut down because being sad is considered weakness. Society seems to teach male people that they shouldn't have feelings and their interests have to be manly or else theyre shamed. 

Destroy toxic masculinity. Teach the boys and men in your life that it's okay to cry, it's okay to fail, it's okay to like that interest, whether it's art, STEM, culinary, sports, etc.

TooAfraidToAsk,ff30oe2,t1_ff304pf,1579530525.0,"Oh. Maybe. 

Anyway, to answer your question, gender isn't really spoken about on a mass scale. That is, it's not really something people talk about unless they're with like-minded friends. 

You probably see it online a lot because it's a platform for people to express themselves without fear of repercussions. 

I think the US can be quite conservative at times and gender expression is slowly being accepted. Those of us who aren't cis (non-trans) try to make ourselves known to others online so we feel less alone.
