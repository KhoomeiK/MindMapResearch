And yes there are people who think humanity deserves to die (I'm one of them) but we're also hypocrites who obviously don't want to die.

What i wanna say r/collapse is for a good part just a pessimistic version of subreddits like this one. There is hope but there is also an expectation (r/collapse -> humanity will likely die more or less, /r/ClimateActionPlan and company -> humanity will/may survive if we get our shit together). The latter is the main difference but sadly the one ignored most of the time."

With the same time and money you can do more in renewables and storage solutions.
