* The Supreme Court. I have high confidence that Bernie will nominate the most progressive court possible. Imagine a court that will get rid of money in politics. That is the fundamental change we need.

* Bernie is not going to get any of his big picture plans passed exactly as he envisioned. There's going to be a lot of push back from Republicans and centrist democrats, and people like you and me. And that's fine with me. Aim for Universal healthcare and settle for a robust public option. Aim for free college education for all and settle for free community college for all.

* Your big power spike in lane comes at lvl 3, where you can do a w-e combo to proc your passive. You do this 2-3 times in lane and the enemy will have to back.

* One of Vel's underrated utility is his low mana requirement. I use his abilities to check bushes all the time (after I have a mana item).

* Comet is really great for early game. You can easily proc it with your W even through minions.

* I recommend taking ghost poro (secondary). Vel Koz is very vulnerable to ganks. Anything you can do to make ganks less likely is important. 

* I would never take Ignite on Velkoz. If you are fighting close enough to use ignite you're doing Velkoz wrong. I sometimes even take heal -- even if it is a double heal -- when going up against lane opponents that have powerful skill shots we have to dodge (like Xerath, MF, Jin, etc).

* I also recommend taking ingenious (secondary). Vel's weakness is that he is so squishy. But with twin shadows and zhonyas up every 30 seconds, you can ward as confidently as any tanky support.

* In some situations it is viable to build Velkoz very tanky. Sometimes the enemy will have a super fed Yi or Yasuo. To counter I build not only zhonyas, but add a frozen heart as well. The extra rotation of spells you can get off matters a lot.

Ultimately I stopped playing Velkoz support because while I almost always win lane, I cannot help other lanes as much as I'd like. Also, Vel is so tough to play against the most popular meta supports right now (Naut, Leona, Pyke) and soon-to-be meta supports like Swain. So now I'm more into 

* Xerath support: His ult allows me to help teammates almost globally.

* Heimer support: His turrets allows me to control objectives and even get drake despite a bad / absent jungler on my team."
