chelseafc,fe6okun,t3_enq23o,1578898289.0,"Firslty. When playing for Chelsea there is almost always a team mate open for a pass. He got caught in the box for that second goal looking for a pass but Villa would want you to clear by hoofing it upfield. So no one was available. 
Secondly. He's not a defensive midfielder so he's tracking back and tackling is poor. I like Drinkwater and think he would have been great in a Chelsea team managed by Frank if he had been younger. 

Anyway he just has to wrap his head around how Villa plays and I think he will come good."
football,fe6nuou,t3_enovxv,1578897447.0,Time out cards. For offences that aren't serious enough to be reds. Like a silly foul but it's a second yellow. Jorginho Vs Arsenal a few weeks ago would be a perfect example. I'm a Chelsea supporter but he should've gotten a second yellow. Ref thought the challenge itself probably wasn't worth getting sent off. But get him out the game for 10 to 15 minutes and it would've been a suitable punishment.

facepalm,fdq9js7,t1_fdq968c,1578660270.0,I say this with humour but an American advising me to carry a gun is a very American thing to do. Anything can happen to anybody anywhere. Just with a higher percentage here. So far we have been ok so I don't wanna jinx anything. But the girlfriend and I moved in together recently to a better suburb than where we each grew up. So touch wood. Anyway. Have a great day my American friend. Was awesome having this chat with you.
facepalm,fdq7x9o,t1_fdq7jmg,1578658600.0,Listen friend. I don't wish to have an online argument with some guy who I know is a good person by the way that he argues for the protection of others. I'm no believer in fairytales. I bought my sister a taser when she moved into her new place. I hate that I can't pick my girlfriend up from work everyday and she has to travel (ps I'm from South Africa so the evil we're talking about is on another level here) and maybe it's because I'm from here that I can see how hopeless the situation is. Maybe I feel the only help is the education of the youth to not be the monsters their father's are today. My point only was that the world fucking sucks and sadly we have to protect ourselves against it but wouldn't it be better if we taught future generations to not be this way? A dream maybe. But it's something we should try to achieve.
facepalm,fdq6tt9,t1_fdq6hw5,1578657369.0,I've seen stories about armed and self defence taught women still being raped. Most burglaries don't happen through an unlocked front door. Locking your front door doesnt magically prevent robbers. Knowing self defence doesn't stop men from holding guns to a woman's head and still raping her. If you think these small inconveniences to evil men will change the world then you're deluded. I don't have the solution. But yes it will be nice if evil didn't exist instead of finding ways to protect oneself from the evil that plagues this world.
facepalm,fdq0usf,t1_fdpx69c,1578649292.0,The point is not for women to take steps to prevent being raped but for men to not fucking rape them. That should be the societal objective.
