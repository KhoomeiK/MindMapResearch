Gundam,ffegzum,t1_ffdvsdk,1579847642.0,"Honestly, he's one of the few characters in the series that we actually get to see really mature a bit, IMO. 

Amuro started off a brat and eventually matured and accepted his necessity. Still stayed kinda naive and preachy though, IMO. Kinda lost himself and became defined by Char. 

Kamille started off as s best and ended as a comatose brat. Kamille is just the worst. Don't be like Kamille. 

Judau started as a strong-willed punk just trying to get by, and matured into a responsible young adult that set off to the reaches of space. And if you're a manga reader, you get to see him again twice in the Late UC era, some 45ish years later, still being a badass and all around good guy."

bestof,ffdie1c,t1_ffdhhau,1579821514.0,"So, now, because of ACAB you're saying that their loved ones deserve no sympathy either?  Just how far does that extend for you? Is it like a reverse Bacon Number kind of thing? ""You've got to have at least three degrees of separation from a cop or you can just get fucked!"" 

Saying that somebody's mother or brother or daughter doesn't deserve sympathy over a death isn't holding anyone accountable. That's just being a bastard yourself, in a different way."

Also, the Republicans have spent well over a decade institutionalizing the partisan idea that if you don't toe the party line, you're a traitor. Going against the desired outcome is basically akin to shooting yourself in the foot."
bestof,ffd9dku,t1_ffd87z1,1579815989.0,"> and I shed no tears for the ones that get hurt or killed. While i dont celebrate what happened in Dallas (my current home) a couple of years ago, i found it really hard to feel bad about it. 

This is the only part I really disagree with you on. These are still people with loved ones. Parents, siblings, husbands, wives, and children. If absolutely nothing else, it's worth shedding a tear for how losing someone affects other people. 

I completely get the compulsion to think of cops as monsters, but they are still human at the end of the day. Dehumanizing people is what they do, and we don't want to be guilty of the same, IMO."

One-off episodes and 3ish episode stories (see Dragon Ball Super's Pot-Au-Feu filler), not so much."
