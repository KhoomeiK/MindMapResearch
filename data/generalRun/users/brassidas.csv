These lions were used to this routine of when the gate is opened and the truck rolls through that they will be fed. Wild animals act aggressively around feeding time especially if they've been trained to do so via conditioning to put on a show for tourists.

He fucked up by opening the gate, I'm assuming to clear out an obstacle and when the lion charged to greet him he turned his back, ran and panicked. That lions pray drive was already excited knowing damn well he's about to be fed and the only safety precautions he took was having his admittedly less stupid employee through extra chicken as bait (as was common practice) to 'distract' the lions long enough for him to open the gate, get the truck through, and close it again."
