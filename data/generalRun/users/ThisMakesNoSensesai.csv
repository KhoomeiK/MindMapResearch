But the true self is pure love. Not the sexual love you have with your spouse. It's not the same love you have for your dog or the plant in your room, your parents or your baby. Pure love is unconditional. You love for the love itself. There is no difference in a pebble, a rat or a baby. If you live in that you are what is called enlightened. In india it is said one in 80.000.000 reaches  enlightenment.
