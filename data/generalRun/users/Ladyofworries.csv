You both have different standards and priorities of living and finding a compromise to keep both of you happy is the key to long term happiness as a couple. She won’t think to be cleaner on her own because it does not matter the way it does to you. And same you won’t get why she is like that because your mind registers mess differently. Go into that conversation aware of your differences and with the knowledge that you love each other and want the other to be happy.

rimjob_steve,ff9w46k,t1_ff9v008,1579722796.0,Sadly that always remains a possibility. And even the best people can hurt you. My husband an i have had misunderstandings that did really hurt. But in the end he always meant well and had nothin but good intentions and love in his heart. I hope you find someone like that for yourself and be someone like that for someone else. I did pick him carefully even if it may not seem that way. He was a bit of a shy one and for some reason i could just tell he was a kind person. A big part of that was how he never really seemed to be part of anything even remotely mean and how calm he always was. Sadly i know from my mothers and by proxi my own experience how someone can seem so charming and nice become a big source of both physical and mental pain. I hope you got something good like being better at detecting troublesome signs in people and that that helps you find someone you can truly trust.
