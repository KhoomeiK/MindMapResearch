even azzapp got NA challenger and he plays with 139 ms with a shitty connection frim the balkans

maybe your ISP routing is not right you can use gaming VPNs to reduce it to the lowest possible. I used exitlag for example"

leagueoflegends,ffu5c7g,t1_ffthlc2,1580234820.0,"he also got top 5 on KR also 

90 ms Challenger on a weaker region is not that impressive seeing as he can consistently get top 1 with impressive winrates on EUW  you get used to the delay in a few games tbh 

I got higher rank on NA than EU and I had 90 more MS on NA

You can get 80 (UK) -90 (NL/BE/Western Germany) ms on NA from Western Europe and its more than playable"
