I really liked Elias Skjoldborg's Ted Talk about Optimistic Nihilism ( [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmRBzc0o71A](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmRBzc0o71A) )  its only about ten min but explained it well for me in a serious but not boring way."
depression,fcjkh7y,t3_eh6aac,1577691253.0,"This reminds me of a Ted Talk by Andrew Solomon called Depression, the Secret We Share, you should give it a listen. It might be interesting for you.

Some quick quotes that hit me most

""You don't think in depression that you've put on a gray veil and are seeing the world through the haze of a bad mood. **You think that the veil has been taken away**, the veil of happiness, and that **now you're seeing truly**. It's easier to help schizophrenics who perceive that there's something foreign inside of them that needs to be exorcised, but it's difficult with depressives, because **we believe we are seeing the truth…..But the truth lies.**""

""The opposite of depression is not happiness, but vitality.""

""And it was at that point that I began to think that it was just too painful to be alive, and that t**he only reason not to kill oneself was so as not to hurt other people**. ""

""Shutting out the depression strengthens it. While you hide from it, it grows. And the people who do better are the ones who are able to tolerate the fact that they have this condition. Those who can tolerate their depression are the ones who achieve resilience.""

Everyone's depression is different, we may have some common factors, but as a whole, it is unique to each of us because no two people are exactly the same. Depression is a lie. and when it has us in its grip and as brought us down so deep that is when we don't even know it is all an illusion."

Talking with like minded people on the pc helped me. Face to face was sometimes intimidating with my anxiety, but online was less scary and for some reason I am way better at typing my thoughts then verbally saying then outloud."
depression,fca9in6,t3_egvkro,1577565168.0,"Keep trying with the therapist, I went through four before I found one that I felt comfortable with. Therapist understand that too so they dont feel bad when you goto someone else and sometimes can even recommend someone who has a different style then theirs. Therapy really does help but it takes time, its not a 2 sessions and I'm cured. Tell the the therapist why it's not working for you, they aren't mind readers, that way they can adjust their approach."
