nothingeverhappens,ffen6xv,t1_ffd81hq,1579855471.0,"When I was in 8th grade I went to a small private elitist JROTC school. I was in a 9th grade class Spanish class because I had previous learned a lot of Spanish in grade school. I was a quiet fat kid with terrible acne so obviously the 9th graders fucked with me to no end. One day before the teacher got to class a specific kid was fucking with me, and I grabbed one of those shitty high school desks and threw it at him and made some kind of comment. Nobody told on me or anything because of the culture there, and while it didn't completely stop them from bothering me they did lighten up with me a lot and sort of treated me like one of them to an extent. I'd like to believe it was because they thought I was cool but it is more likely that they decided I was crazy.

So that's my story, but also I transferred to public school for high school and like 100 kids have a story like this, so maybe it was exaggerated but I would believe it wasn't. I have made jokes that nobody in r/thatHappened remembers being a child but now I think they all lost their entire long term memory"
askscience,ffaiudl,t1_ff83m04,1579736785.0,"I know it's not what ""plastic"" means in this context but OP can use actual also use real plastic to demonstrate this. In certain plastics that you can typically find around the house, like a soda bottle, you can observe pushing in on a plastic water bottle. Pushing into the bottle with your thumb, you initially can create a dent that can be undone and return the bottle to its original shape. As you increase the pressure applied you will eventually cross a threshold where a permanent deformation is very clear."

This story is well within the realm of possibility. No one thing that she said was factually improbable, just all of it together seems improbable, so if she is not making this up then literally thousands of Redditors are ripping into her for sharing what is one of the most horrific experiences that someone can deal with. They just made her life worse. If she is making it up then she is trash, and I wish it wasn't necessary for these people who know nothing about the real world to err on the side of she is trash given how heart-wrenching this story was.

Just reading the pamphlets I would not see them as a particularly good way of evacuating cities considering they were dropped everywhere and are clearly propaganda, so if someone is saying that these pamphlets somehow made it less horrible then that is incredibly naive. 

If my government has me convinced that the enemy is evil and is threatening my way of life, and the enemy has been bombing the shit out of my homeland for years, I would scoff at a patronizing note from the enemy telling me that it's my government's fault. This feels like it is either an attempt to stir insurgency or a way to ease the consciences of the higher ups by saying ""well we told them to leave."" 

Like if the note just said ""We are bombing your city tomorrow at 5am"" that might be something I would consider, but if people actually started responded to leaflets then we could stop dropping bombs altogether. We could just drop leaflets to shut down manufacturing areas"
todayilearned,febmqru,t1_fe7vjlx,1578960502.0,"There was no understanding of the aftereffects of the bombs at the time. At the time, these bombs were just really big ordinance, otherwise no different than firebombing cities. Bombing was a necessary military strategy, and America had a big bomb. The only thing special about the A-bomb in the eyes of America was that it allowed for the complete destruction of a city without air superiority. Remove the unknown-at-the-time after effects and it was the equivalent of many bombing runs. War is terrible and is filled with murder hidden behind ideas of rules of engagement and all that, but bombing infrastructure was necessary to win. Take away the radiation and how exactly was this bomb any more barbaric than the bombing campaigns of the other combatants? I am going to stress again that nobody understood the effects of radiation at the time."

If I'm in England and some German planes started dropping leaflets about how our government is the real enemy I doubt I would take them seriously for a second.

I think that their falling out and rivalry was probably going to be surrounded by one of them scorning the other for business, just based on when Richard asks if they were friends, the way Peter says ""I thought so"" and looks away, and then the meeting in the restaurant. It is classic ""running into an ex"" conversation. I think that tying everything together under this one narrative would have made for a really good show.

So that is like unequivocally false, thus the arguments and downvotes. How do you think you store sugar then?
