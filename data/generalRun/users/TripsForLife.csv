syriancivilwar,fffpwjh,t1_fff47wy,1579889231.0,"The protestors believe that US somehow founded ISIS, so... It's always either the fault of the US, Israel or both for them. When you believe that, it's natural to draw the conclusion that US pulling out will magically fix everything, including the economy and security situation (both would probably take a hit instead). 

I wish US would leave, but that would mean giving Iran a huge gift - for that reason I don't expect the withdrawal to happen anytime soon."
