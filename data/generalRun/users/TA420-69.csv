SuicideWatch,fg17ba8,t3_ewb3hf,1580422139.0,"After reading some of your posts, I'm sorry you had to deal with that. No human should be put through such a horrible experience.

Whatever your decision is, in the end, I hope you feel some bit of happiness."
depression,ffh6rf6,t3_etlrkb,1579924679.0,Why can't you go outside? Sneak out and look for him?
SuicideWatch,ffgzoso,t3_etkrq8,1579919220.0,"Never apologize for how you feel. People do have it worse, but that doesn't mean it dismisses your feelings.

Never be afraid to share how you feel or complain. It's simply human and we all do it."
depression,ffbkxyn,t3_esqdho,1579770325.0,"I feel ya. I'm exhausted. I'm only 30. Been working for only 10 years and I just feel I can't do this anymore either. 

I feel like a slave to the system. And that most people who realize it are the ones to tend to be the most depressed. I feel like we might get somewhere if people were able to make more livable wages at these shit jobs, reduce the hours for more free time and mental health time and hire a few extra people so more are working.

At least that's how I feel it should work. But how I feel and reality are different.
Hang in there friend. We're all in this together."
depression,ff5aly0,t3_erfmu2,1579585342.0,"I've wanted to try, but sadly I'm not smart enough to really figure out where and what to get. Idk what to look for. Don't know anyone either.

Stuff seems hard to come by, but I've wanted to try a micro dose myself to see if it would help."
depression,fez2hh3,t1_fewqluq,1579453236.0,"I've considered it, but I'm skeptical about meditation. It sounds too much like voodoo magic to me but I don't quite know how or what meditation is like, so to judge would be stupid.

Think I'll just have to give it a try and see what happens."
AskReddit,fed17l5,t3_eoemhc,1578993552.0,"Morally, yes, if you're going to eventually jump into sex or even start talking about it, you might as well let her know. Who knows, maybe you'll both discover something else you like and do that instead.

The hardest part though is being truthful about it and confident. Hard to be confident and say you have a small penis. Most just laugh."
depression,fe5yb6k,t3_enrs4c,1578877650.0,"All the time. Even then though, nobody listens to anything I have to say so I just keep everything to myself.

They tell me it's unhealthy to do that, but what else can I do when nobody will listen?

Sometimes I get in a good mood though and it feels like my depression was really all just attention seeking. But then I get depressed again and fall back into the bad habits."
depression,fcllpef,t3_ehtpnj,1577750720.0,Yes! I struggle with this constantly too. I'm terrified of not being me. I've been unhappy for so long that happiness scares me.
