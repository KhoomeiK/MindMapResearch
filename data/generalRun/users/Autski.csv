MadeMeSmile,fg0mpc5,t1_ffznzbz,1580410884.0,"This is so correct! So glad you brought this up. God intentionally and *explicitly* lists loving God first and foremost. This means that any other Earthly thing should pale in comparison to our love for Him and if we love Him that we keep His commandments.   


Jesus didn't scream at non-believers over and over and over again; He offered them the opportunity to enter into a relationship with Him and be able to gain peace, hope, and purpose. Additionally, we are now able to show love unlike anything the world has seen which should compel believers to go above and beyond the status quo in loving others (poor, weak, afflicted). One way of loving someone so much is to let them know they are on a path which will not lead to ultimate satisfaction, filled with peace about why they are on this Earth. Once that has been presented, Christians are to take a firm stand and stand up for God's commandments, no matter the cost. You can love someone by letting them know that nothing on this earth they can do, have, or say will ever, ever fully satisfy them to their core. If you knew of something so unbelievably life-changing, would it be loving to not let someone else know?   


A lot of the time, Christians (who are broken humans too) prefer to yell about the negatives instead of the positives of Christianity. Jesus does this so well by informing of the consequences (which is totally rational) but also letting people know what is in store if they do follow Him. After that, the choice is in that person's hands to follow Him or not. You know the cost, and if you think you can do a better job with your life on your own, He isn't going to stop you, but He will be heart-broken to hear of it (because He knows how much better you can become and wants you freed from the hopelessness!)"
MadeMeSmile,fg0lk8b,t1_ffzrl0c,1580410235.0,"It is amazing how disagreeing with someone automatically equals hating that person. I don't like Nascar but that doesn't mean I now **hate** every fan of it. If they were telling me I *have* to like it then I am allowed to disagree and say, ""no thanks, I don't want to support it and I am not going to entertain it. I will, however, tolerate it (which does not = acceptance)"" Oftentimes, though, it will turn into an ad hominem attack."
MadeMeSmile,fg0l22h,t1_ffzuj1j,1580409950.0,"Jesus wasn't sitting there, constantly berating someone to change, screaming at them over and over and over. He would let them know once or twice, then move on if they didn't want to change. The ones He *would* scream at were those who were pretending to be followers and/or leading others astray. Anyone is welcome to continue living in the same way they have been (though it is going to lead to a lot of dissatisfaction, hopelessness, and fear in varying amounts) but if you want to live a life fulfilled He asks you to follow Him.

By all means, others can continue to live their life watching, reading, smoking, drinking, and sleeping with whomever you want, but in the end, it will always leave them feeling empty and emotionally damaged. They are never ""too far gone"" for God, though. That's the really cool part about Him and His message.

Once you join the Church, however, you are opening yourself up to be held accountable for your actions and remaining in line with what God commands. He isn't about cut/pasting the parts of the Bible you like and discarding the rest."
MadeMeSmile,fg0jdtq,t1_ffzq4by,1580408987.0,"There are a lot of things out there people think aren't a sin that actually are. Luckily, God gives us grace to move on from that so we can enjoy the peace, hope, and love He has to offer. However, this isn't a free ticket to continually sin or live in that."
MadeMeSmile,fg0j6av,t1_fg030vv,1580408869.0,"It is really hard when people say ""God is only about love, so we should love each other!"" when yes, while God is love and He *does* want us to love each other, He is actually mostly concerned with being in a relationship with you. He wants to free you from the bonds of sin (whatever that sin looks like) and want to get to know Him. The love we should have for Him should supersede any other love we have, and that includes wanting to follow lusts or personal interests which are detestable to Him. It isn't to crap on their party, it's to eliminate distractions and fully experience the love, freedom, hope, and peace He can offer in this messed up world. No Earthly relationship, no matter how great, will ever fully satisfy someone."
MadeMeSmile,fg0ioot,t1_ffzp61y,1580408589.0,"I disagree. I don't believe God wants to convert people with same-sex attraction into opposite-sex attraction. I think God wants people to love Him more than relationships and sex. I think God wants people to be freed from the spiritual and emotional bonds of sin and live a peaceful life; that sin could be anything from murder to being jealous. Yes, we are to love others as it is the second greatest commandment (which is like the first), but that love (as great as it is) should pale in comparison to how much we love God.

MadeMeSmile,fg0hww5,t1_ffzq3xa,1580408147.0,"I came here to say the same thing. If a discussion is initiated, you will most likely be misconstrued (or rebutted by bias) and detracted with words like ""hate"" and ""bigotry."" Unfortunately, putting those labels on someone as an ad hominem attack detracts from the very real discussion we should be allowed to have. Opinions, disagreements, and non-conformity are awarded to both parties in a fair conversation so we can expand our ideas instead of furthering ourselves into an a corner with echo-chamber cronies around us.  


In the U.S., we are afforded freedom of speech where we can say things like, ""I do not agree with that"" or ""I do not like that"" and then are given the chance to argue their viewpoint with civil discourse (not blinded or impeded by overt emotion). Oftentimes, people will use personal stories instead of approaching a topic with evidence, facts, statistics, and logical reasoning to encapsulate majority contexts.

UpliftingNews,ffxzpir,t1_ffxnvk9,1580335633.0,"Gotcha. To continue this humorous, interesting hypothetical:

If there were aliens that far superior to us, they would be most likely be God-tier (due to how advanced and evolved we have become); we would honestly probably be better for food for them as there isn't much else we could do to help them.  They could probably do as they please. Would I be ok with that? It doesn't really seem like I have the choice since I'm so far below them and my purpose for being here on the Earth is inconsequential to the grand scheme of things. The best I could hope for would be to provide sustenance for something else. 

These God-tier aliens would be able to grow, harvest, and slaughter us for food in a way where we honestly had no idea that it was happening. It would be over so fast, plus there wouldn't be a way we could convey it to others, then I don't know where I would stand as I would be too stupid to know the difference.

Farm animals are here to provide labor, food, and supplies. Is it ethical to put these poor oxen to work plowing the field their whole life? What about breaking horses and forcing them to be our transportation (or be in a fancy sport)? How about domesticating dogs and inbreeding the crud out of them where we now have bulldogs and pugs that live a labored life where they literally struggle second by second to breathe? What about keeping birds? What about zoos, even amazing ones like Disney's Animal Kingdom where they get top-tier medical treatment? 

I think it's just a challenge to go backwards from where we have come with hunting and gathering (which has been around for millennia), it's just now incredibly efficient.  If we begin going backwards then where do we stop? To stop killing all animals starts MASSIVE overpopulation where now all plants are in danger of being eaten up. What about killing *some* animals? Well, where do you stop with that? Hunting nowadays is a huge conservation initiative that helps all wildlife, including the one from which you are killing as it keeps the food-to-animal ratio in check."

If these superior aliens were to come along and contact us and let us know their intentions, then we would have an incredibly interesting conundrum. I don't know about an alien, but humans have heightened significance due to our abilities to reason, express emotions (much deeper emotions than happy or sad: emotions like introspection, honesty, empathy, compassion, lust, incredulity, emotional maturity, love, and a myriad of others), our continually expanding knowledge base where we can learn unbelievably complex things that animals can't even come close to understanding, ingenuity, expeditious perseverance for improvement, etc. Without getting religious (which is challenging to do if you want to define some incredibly complex phenomena), these reasons put us above the animals in many, many ways. Therefore, if an alien, who is superior, floated there way down here, then they would have to acknowledge that Humans are obviously separated from the animals and have heightened significance beyond that of a chicken or cow. Harvesting us for meat would be a waste of amazing potential in hundreds (if not thousands) of ways. They would recognize it would be better to enslave us and work us to death and keep harvesting other animals like we do. 

There is a big difference between mass killings where nothing is made of use and slaughtering to gain meat for sustenance. I feel it would be better to send these male chicks somewhere where they could live out their days, but the overpopulation would be insane."

1. While they should be treated humanely until they are slaughtered, they are not humans and don't process the same way humans do. It isn't as if we are watching human babies being eliminated. Animal life is incredibly important for sure, but it is not human life which I believe has an infinitely higher distinction.

2. It happens so unbelievably fast that the camera (not being slo-mo) can't even really capture what is happening until it is already over. Which means that these little chicks don't even realize what is happening until they are already gone. I have seen a small farmer slaughter full-sized chickens (which I helped pluck afterwards) and the time it took for him to slit it's throat and let it bleed out was an eternity next to this shredder. The chickens (20 or so) were raised in a nice little coop with an outside area that was pretty good, so they were treated really humanely until they were killed.

With a this being said, it really is making me re-think if I want to support this practice anymore. It is disgusting how much these chicks are tossed to the side purely because they are males. Granted, the ""life"" of the females until slaughter probably isn't going to be better so maybe the males are getting the better end of the deal by allowing it to be over quickly...

The older I get, the more I see crying as a tool to help us through huge moments in our life. Whether it is the loss of something or someone, or if it is the overfilled joy of the moment where we are unable to process it so it causes us to weep. Crying is an amazing tool for guys and I don't know why it is shown as a sign of weakness.  


Note: crying for women is not the same as crying for men. I have heard it described to me that for women, crying is *like* sweating: it is the body's reaction to a lot of inputs, stresses, and emotions, good and bad. For men, crying is *like* a tool in a tool box: it helps serve a function for certain situations, emotions, and processes where holding it in doesn't allow these moments to be fully experienced. Obviously, there is overlap between the two, but it's a decent way to help break it down.  


Careful, though: some people (women and men, but more commonly women) might use crying as a weapon where they tear up as a manipulation tactic to display pain when in reality they are just ""sweating"" and trying to twist it into bending another person into doing what they want.

But what I think Mr. Von Hammerstein is getting at is that putting a half-baked quote above a picture of two old people who are smiling (could be married, could be friends, could be siblings, who knows) is rally disingenuous and disconnected.
