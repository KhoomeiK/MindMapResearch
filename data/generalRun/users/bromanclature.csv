Run your feet before you run your mouths about feedback. You might as well just tell us to fuck off with how infrequently positive change occurs these days in Destiny. Sure, you’ll fix bugs quickly that allow things like killing a raid boss nearly instantaneously, or dump 90% of your effort into Eververse shit that’s 100x better than even pinnacle-level earnable garbage, but when it comes to making changes that are actually good for the game / community and show that you give a fuck about the Destiny experience, you seem to be absent entirely.

Tell those in power to get off their asses and do what’s right for once. Bungie behaves as a selfish, disconnected tyrant. For the first time since D1 vanilla, I’m not singing your praises, and push others to different games, because you simply don’t deserve the breath.

You have some of the best design and game mechanics teams out there, yet community-unfriendly stuff like this being the new norm, on top of the mighty Eververse and the absolutely lazy copy-paste design for seasonal content, completely squander their talents. Once again shit management gets in the way of greatness.
