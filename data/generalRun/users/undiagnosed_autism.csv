nba,ffh6mxk,t1_ffh6k8a,1579924575.0,But we also got blown out by Milwaukee
nba,ffh6aai,t3_etlozz,1579924290.0,"Man, the clippers confuse me. We beat the Lakers twice, blow out loss to the Grizzlies, lose to a Trae young-less worst team in the NBA, next game beats arguably the hardest team to play when at their home."

logistics,femkpzn,t3_epw8gg,1579260426.0,"As a student studying supply chain and logistics in Australia and wanting to get into a freight forwarding career. What would you recommend I do to maximise my chances of landing a job? 
What's the current job market looking like? Is there a high demand?
Given the rise of robotics and internet of things, how secure would you say your job is? Do you think there is any chance it could be replaced by AI?

Thanks :)"

nba,feg70i3,t1_feg6afe,1579079980.0,Well yeah. They are our only 2 centre's
LAClippers,fefuc59,t3_eovylx,1579065459.0,All I want is for kawhi to play 30 more seconds just so he can score and match/beat his career high. We're up by 36 though so I don't see that happening
tall,fe6dyd7,t3_envwbh,1578888086.0,A good tip to make those smaller mice more usable is to chop of the first digits of your fingers (or 2 if you got really big hands)
LAClippers,fe6dl5c,t1_fe6c44v,1578887792.0,"I agree with all, except moe and Sham. More so moe. Moe has been so good for us this year. We need to upgrade the centre position for sure. Watching Harrell get beaten up and drawing fouls is really bad. Especially once playoff time comes. We have beaten the Lakers, but  the playoffs will pose a difficult challenge for us when teams exploit our biggest weakness. If we can trade the pieces you've listed minus Sham and Moe for a solid defensive centre from a 'on the verge of a complete rebuild' team I think that would be perfect.

From the top of my head:

Whiteside, Adams, Drummond, Jordan, vucevic
(I haven't bothered to check salary cap issues but I'm assuming we couldn't afford them so rip)"
nba,fe6cbep,t1_fe6bz9c,1578886815.0,I'm just talking about the 7-0 run with had with 5 minutes to go. We still had momentum but lost it with the silly fouls and complaining
nba,fe6bokk,t3_enyibn,1578886341.0,If we kept out emotions in check towards the end we would have won that game :'(
