If it was a picture of a giraffe with a comment about the neck, would that be sexual? If it was a picture of a gorilla talking about how muscular it is, would that be sexual? If it was a picture of a gecko talking about how beautiful it's skin is, is that sexual? Hips, necks, muscles, and skin *can* be sexualized in the context of humans, but are also a basic part of anatomy, and this is a cat."

ClimateOffensive,feefy8g,t1_fedfwhk,1579032958.0,"A fair point, but at the same time dismissing The Solar Foundation for being inherently biased for researching a topic they were founded to research means we shouldn't trust *ANY* independent organization, and we all need to do our own research to confirm or deny *ANY* claim these organizations make.

NASA was created to further our scientific understanding of space. If we apply the logic also being used here, NASA must also be inherently biased for researching the topic they were created to research. We shouldn't trust the World Health Organization, because they were created to research world health, and they must be biased too.

Surely the problem with thinking this way is obvious, no?

A little bit of skepticism is fine, healthy even, but the commentors here are easily willing to discredit The Solar Foundation without doing any of their own research to confirm or deny their claims. The astroturfing against the solar industry is rather shocking to see in a subreddit dedicated to supporting the climate offensive. Renewables are the way forward."
