MechanicAdvice,ffv7yvx,t1_ffuxryk,1580257844.0,Yep. My daily driver is a 98 K1500 and the family vehicle is a 96 Suburban K1500. The only piece of shit owned is my wife’s 2012 Impala.

MechanicAdvice,ffj7ohm,t3_etw6xl,1579992446.0,Connector probably needs replaced. They weren’t really designed for continuous use or the constant insert/removal of plugs.

MechanicAdvice,febqifj,t3_eoafij,1578961610.0,Those pitman arm pullers are about worthless. The jaws are either too thin and break or too thick and won’t fit under the arm. I’ve had better luck using a 3-jaw puller.
aww,fe3nbpq,t3_enprhk,1578850924.0,That brings me back. I got my oldest daughter (now 13) one of those when she was little.
Christianity,fdpflu8,t3_em6ivs,1578627357.0,You are correct to seek help. Mental health issues are prevalent through the Bible. You can’t convince me David wasn’t bipolar or Jonah didn’t suffer from depression. Unfortunately these things are not very understood by the church.
MechanicAdvice,fdowg8w,t3_emcwz8,1578614437.0,Had a 98 Olds Aurora batt from the factory last 12 years. I attributed it to it living under the back seat and being our primary vehicle.

MechanicAdvice,fd7ihd2,t1_fd7hrht,1578205063.0,"I have a buddy who works at a local GM dealership. He gave me some of the best used car buying advice I’ve ever heard. Ignore the BS dealerships say about “inspections“. Yes they may do an over 9000 point inspection, but that doesn’t mean they fixed any of the problems they found. You rarely get to see said report either."
MechanicAdvice,fd7hj3q,t3_ek8uxr,1578204609.0,Dealership likely knew the problem. They cleared the codes only for it to re-appear for you and hoping you would pay to fix it rather than complain. Happens all the time.
