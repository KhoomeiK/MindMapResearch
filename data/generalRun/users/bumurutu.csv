Patriots,ffsyoqb,t1_ffs8n5m,1580198091.0,Don’t forget Wayne
todayilearned,ffsp773,t1_ffsoaih,1580187736.0,Makes sense. My main area of exposure is central Scottsdale (lived here the past 14 years) as well as Tempe and PV. Feel like newer builds are trending towards 2 story but the bulk of the housing in my area (Shea corridor and Green Belt) was built in the 70s and is all 1 story. North Scottsdale up past the 101 seems to have a lot more 2 story builds as it is an area that wasn’t developed until recently.
todayilearned,ffsmnnx,t1_ffsh213,1580185591.0,Southwest doesn’t have basements. Moved from MA to AZ about 22 years ago and I think I have been in 1 house with a basement in the PHX area the whole time I have lived here. Even two story houses in this area are outside the norm. I would say at least a solid 75% of houses in the PHX metro area are single story. And this is including some really nice high end houses in Scottsdale and Paradise Valley.

funny,ff75qrh,t1_ff6317h,1579641660.0,Seriously. It's like some people don't understand that people might have grown up in a different part of the same country.
todayilearned,ff4n5q6,t3_erlwes,1579567667.0,OP has brain fag syndrome
Patriots,fekv1dm,t3_epmqef,1579208178.0,"I got super lucky before the 2016 season. Visited the shop at Patriots Place in the offseason, had to choose between a Hightower and Collins jersey. Went Hightower!"
worldnews,fegpsw6,t1_fegoeru,1579099665.0,Seriously. The link directly calls out conspiracy theorists stating exactly what they are trying to insinuate.
news,fe653nd,t1_fe61cnz,1578881977.0,"This directly makes the leadership look like hypocrites given their stance on 655. They did the exact same thing they accused the US of doing on purpose and they did it mainly to their own citizens. Also, the timing being so close to the suppression of the previous protests also helps."
news,fe4ugv1,t1_fe49ee2,1578862884.0,"Ok, fine. Reagan admitted fault and publicly expressed regret days after the incident. While he did not legally apologize he did say that he considered it an apology. The US also paid 61.8 million in restitution to the families of the victims at the conclusion of the investigation.

Iran issued their “apology” in the same language, by expressing regret but never actually apologizing. Also, Iran has not said a single thing about restitution so you are making a pretty big assumption that they are going to do so."
news,fe454dh,t1_fe3uj05,1578855875.0,"Seriously dude, educate yourself before you spout bullshit"
AskReddit,fdcmdpx,t1_fd1nsdd,1578278504.0,"Don’t sweat it. I am 41, got a 5 yo, 3 yo and a 3 week old. Don’t let the late start scare you away from having a family if it’s what you want."
AskReddit,fdcleil,t1_fd2lxut,1578277802.0,Seriously. My wife is off for 3 months right now after having our third child a few weeks ago. I took around 9 days off because that’s all the PTO I had built up. I could take 6 weeks unpaid but that’s a pretty tough bullet to bite.
AskReddit,fdckd70,t1_fd2vbtf,1578277062.0,Honestly it’s because too many people abuse sick time and call out far too often. If you are sick every month then you need to see a damn doctor.
AskReddit,fdck9a0,t1_fd29ckx,1578276985.0,True. I specifically tell my team that I don’t care about the details so don’t bother telling me. As long as being late or missing work aren’t a habit that becomes a problem I really don’t care. You get PTO for a reason.
AskReddit,fdchytj,t1_fd9gt5a,1578275357.0,They are pretty tough. Look so delicate though. Just had my third on December 17th and even with having two already it still took me a few days to stop treating him like he is made of glass.
AskReddit,fdchukc,t1_fd3esdx,1578275272.0,Fuck em. It’s your child. I have straight told people to not touch my baby in public multiple times. Sometimes people don’t understand boundaries.

nfl,fd6k9vx,t1_fd6jtpk,1578192300.0,"Yeah, we. can stop Henry 3 times for negative yardage in a row /s"
nfl,fd6is80,t1_fd6inxe,1578191673.0,Pats did. Need a stop here.
nfl,fd6iow2,t1_fd6ig4u,1578191632.0,In all fairness our run game is dominating between the 20’s. Short yardage is garbage though.
nfl,fd6hsmh,t1_fd6hkhw,1578191231.0,In all fairness it’s against the #1 pass defense
nfl,fd6hlhi,t1_fd6hf2b,1578191139.0,Great play by the safety just prevented a TD. Def not an overthrow
nfl,fd6gyc3,t1_fd6gtub,1578190855.0,Same here. Didn’t do much for me in the championship game though.
nfl,fd6fwgy,t1_fd6fs4h,1578190377.0,"Yeesh, bad look for you my dude"
nfl,fd6f4i4,t1_fd6ezsa,1578190032.0,Fuck the Eagles
nfl,fd6e8sd,t1_fd6e0rh,1578189636.0,Give it time. We haven’t looked this good on offense in 8 weeks.
todayilearned,fd6aunw,t1_fd5rr0x,1578188161.0,My son did something similar while on a walk. Tried to take him behind a bush and before he even bent down he uncorked a man sized turd that thudded off the wall.
Patriots,fd5osif,t3_ek056b,1578179784.0,Red Zone D will be huge. TEN has something like an 80% TD rate in the RZ. That is not sustainable so we need to regress it to the mean today.
todayilearned,fd50w2w,t1_fd34hkh,1578173082.0,There are some great wineries in Washington.

Archero,fcv72v3,t3_ej0hmw,1577995997.0,So get Giant then Dwarf. Problem solved /s
Archero,fcv6ijk,t1_fcuouoj,1577995663.0,I go with chapter 9 for battlepass or chapter 12 for gold/drops. I just hate chapter 10 because of that spinning scythe mage boss.
Archero,fcun5br,t3_eiy4uz,1577984562.0,"I usually farm this level also, good mix of speed and gold. I use Brightspear though. Seems like we have around the same attack and health."
Archero,fcu4pko,t1_fcu4ir6,1577972492.0,Have fun with the scythe mage boss on 10 =(
Archero,fcu4dbk,t1_fctwwpr,1577972253.0,"Yes, your pets can headshot"
Archero,fct8q1f,t3_eimak0,1577935869.0,"I had good RNG for maybe a handful of runs for the month and a half it took me to beat Chapter 13. It’s amazing how shy multi shot, double shot and ricochet are on that chapter. I get all 3 like 2/3 of the time when farming 9 or 12."
Patriots,fcqfpen,t3_eicmct,1577885136.0,"I was at that AZ game. Was pissed at the time because it was the first time since ‘04 that the Pats came to Arizona and we didn’t get to see Brady because of that Deflategate BS suspension (aside from SB49 of course). 

Still had a blast and it was a great game.

Ah well, guess I will have to catch him when he comes back in 2024."

Archero,fcoars5,t1_fcoapa5,1577827684.0,"It's what got me over the hump on 13 as well. I was super close before the patch, got the boss down to like 25% 3 times. Then the patch hit and I was through it the same day."
Archero,fco8q25,t1_fcnwy1s,1577826280.0,The only actual mob that needed a nerf....
Archero,fco8ov7,t1_fcnz6tt,1577826257.0,Works for you also with Brightspear though :)
nfl,fco3q7m,t3_ei4c4e,1577823500.0,"Honestly, good. Give him more time to develop and don’t just write him off that quickly. He has been bad, but that doesn’t mean he can’t be a good QB in this league. He has shown flashes of potential. The NFL is way to reactionary and win now in my book. Don’t give up on players with potential just because they don’t succeed right away."
Archero,fco33io,t1_fcnrhh6,1577823159.0,Yeah double archers are way more manageable now that my gear level is higher. They were a massive pain during my first clear of chapter 11 though.
arizona,fcny2ez,t1_fcmctcu,1577820671.0,I get in to work at 6 so am usually in my car by 5:30. Was 39 degrees on Monday morning.
todayilearned,fcnsoxh,t1_fcn81v3,1577817678.0,Went out like a champ trying to save people from the Vesuvius eruption.
Archero,fcnpdco,t1_fcnbab7,1577815904.0,"Tentacle boss, plant boss (the one that throws the exploding bombs in Flying Bullets) and double Archers. Those are the worst."
Archero,fcnp8la,t1_fcn9rt1,1577815826.0,Would be nice if you went with no pets and the pet abilities would not appear as an option. If that was the case I would go no pets.
Archero,fcn323n,t1_fcld3m0,1577801885.0,This. The boss in this video and the plant guy that spawns the exploding balls are the worst for this level.
Archero,fcn2y7c,t1_fcl5otb,1577801800.0,"Of course they didn't nerf the tentacles. The bees were annoying and kind of required you to have ricochet to defeat as they would pretty often spawn very close to you, but they were manageable. The ball on the worm boss was not an obstacle at all really. Those damn tentacles are what ended my run in Chapter 13 pretty much every time until I finally beat it a week ago."
Archero,fcn2e3l,t1_fclia2b,1577801339.0,With Up Close you better get multi shot and ricochet or you are pretty much screwed
TheMandalorianTV,fcl1exy,t1_fcjy27v,1577737718.0,Agreed on both. Guardians of the Galaxy is a close 3rd though. I really enjoyed that one.
