That point is different for each viewer. Some people are fine with incredibly absurd movies/characters/decisions. Some are not."

One of the things authors seem awful at is writing children. People tend to portray them as adults, with similar reasoning, morality, intelligence, wisdom, inhibitions, internal monologue, and emotional control. It’s not true at all.

As much as I don’t like Crichton, I think Lex from Jurassic Park (the book version) was a decent portrayal of a child. She was a little bratty, emotional, mostly unaware of the gravity of any situation, antagonistic at inappropriate times, playful at inappropriate times, etc. She had little inhibitions of her actions or ability to contextualize what she was doing with the world around her. 

She just did whatever came to mind without really pondering over it. That’s a child, to me."

Years ago, Michigan (along with other states) tried to make the accident reimbursement process quicker/cheaper by having people avoid the cost/time of going through a legal process that could result in them not having the money in time to pay for medical bills.

So they put in place a system where the accident victims could only get compensated by their own insurance companies, regardless of who was at fault. They could not get anything from the offending individual nor their insurance. Suing for negligence is only allowed in the case of severe injury/death.

So, a stolen car should still be covered by the victim's own insurance if they had comprehensive (i.e. theft/vandalism/weather/etc) insurance."

gifs,fcycxcj,t1_fcx7gfq,1578078244.0,"In the end, I think the reason why sources disagree is because of what this [paleoanthropologist described in his blog](http://johnhawks.net/weblog/topics/phylogeny/taxonomy/humans-arent-apes-2012.html), which is that ""apes"" is not an internationally-recognized taxonomic term - it's an English word - and thus has the flexibility to exclude some subspecies.

As confirmation, Webster's defines 'apes' as:

> a: any of various large tailless semi-erect primates of Africa and southeastern Asia (such as the chimpanzee, gorilla, orangutan, or gibbon)
>
> — called also anthropoid, anthropoid ape
>
> — compare GREAT APE
> 
> b: MONKEY
> especially : one of the larger tailless or short-tailed Old World forms —not used technically

Neither really includes humans. I think the mix of common and scientific wording is where the confusion is coming from."

videos,fcveagu,t1_fcv6v3n,1578000293.0,"In the US most corporate jobs start with something like 10 days off (2 weeks), no sick leave...give or take. Maybe you can work up to 3 weeks after many years, but it’s rare to get more than that unless you’re military or senior government. With government (and some progressive jobs) you can often pad your time off by working extra hours.

Some jobs you get far less than 10 days, though.

Also, most other countries aren’t very accessible to us, geographically. We have to allot an extra day or two for travel overseas plus $600-1300 per ticket. Traveling from the US sucks. Luckily there’s a lot to see domestically."
boardgames,fc6lup5,t1_fc5w7lr,1577483636.0,"Yeah...but I’ve been to a few bars where they have a handful of old, ratty games in the corner like checkers, monopoly, and uno and not much more. I wouldn’t call them a board game cafe. If your only criteria is food and a shared game collection I think the bar is a little low. But like you said...it’s definitely a grey area.

I’m often frustrated by showing up somewhere and finding out that boardgames are more an afterthought than a centerpiece."
