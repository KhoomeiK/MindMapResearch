science,ffb2zsc,t1_ffaviy1,1579750485.0,"Went through a seriously tough divorce, my ex made my life more of a living hell than he did when we were married. A while after I left I starting noticing a few silver strands in my dark curly locks. I plucked them not caring if they grew back but because my hair is so dark they were easily seen. But now, 3 years later, I have seen grey in the same areas on my head but only at the tips of the hair while the rest is dark again. Really am hoping it's turning back."
