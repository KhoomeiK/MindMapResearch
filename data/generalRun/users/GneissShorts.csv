I’m on my phone trying to pull up something to sho my mom to make her laugh and the guy asks something along the lines of “what would happen if your phone got taken away?”
I replied along the lines of “I’m 25. She can’t take my phone because it’s my property.”

I also got a pillowcase and a lunchbox, all Slytherin items! Yet to use the pillowcase but I plan on putting it on the next time I wash my sheets. I plan on using the lunch box on my next outing somewhere wether it just be to my aunt’s house or out in the wilderness.

I also did Imgur secret Santa and got Star Wars ship blueprint art prints, a Legend of Zelda journal, and a ball track toy for my cats who love it so far! I need to order a replacement ball though as apparently it’s supposed to light up, but the cats also don’t seem to care about that lol.

I do hope the Imgur user I bought for enjoys his space memorabilia I got him (piece of heat tile from a space shuttle, gold foil off of the Apollo 11.) had to do a little research on customs as apparently it’s not exactly legal to send space stuff to Denmark, so I wasn’t sure if the same rules applied to the UK (the answer is no, send all the aerospace pieces you want!)
