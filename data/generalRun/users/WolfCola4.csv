JUSTNOMIL,femo83k,t1_femf04c,1579264472.0,"Oh yeah I remember when I first heard people using that in American TV - I wasn't that young either so I was super confused! I thought ""wow, watershed is usually super strict, how did this slip through?!"". So yeah I'd probably double take if I heard a British person saying it, but if I had the context that they were from the US or Canada I'd be able to put it together (after a moment's confusion)"
JUSTNOMIL,femcyhz,t1_fem86v5,1579249169.0,"I find it fascinating how words can be such a taboo in some places and totally powerless in others. When I go to my hometown I hear 'cunt' maybe 50 times a day, nearly always harmless. ""Ahhhh you daft cunt, I've missed you!"" It's super weird upon reflection"

worldnews,fef01v2,t1_feex6d1,1579045014.0,"So the plan is... Reconquer the empire from sovereign nations? Set up deals where we trade our nonexistent exports for valuable goods? The UK's economy is now dependant largely on the service sector, and the only reason we manage to sell those services is the strong links we have with EU nations. Everything we export is available cheaper elsewhere, and now thanks to brexit we're all tied up in regulatory hell too. Anyone who believes we're going to storm the world again is insane. And frankly, I hate the notion of imperial Britain back on the rise. We were a bunch of assholes for centuries, and Europe has been very patient with us by and large. Why can't we just be a cooperative member of the group instead of throwing a hissy fit and demanding we be in charge every time a decision is made?"

Like they have nothing to prove maybe, or they've already gotten all their rage out (forgive the pun) on the stage. Safest and most fun gigs I've attended are metal gigs, and everyone is so friendly!

For the record, really enjoyed this cover too"
