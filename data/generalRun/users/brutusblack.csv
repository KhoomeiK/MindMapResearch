SuicideWatch,ffimnps,t1_ffimi1r,1579977532.0,Yes that’s right
SuicideWatch,ffimdet,t1_ffil69r,1579977334.0,"I had a great time in Australia, I was a little lonely but I managed. The night after I got back a lot of my friends all met me at the pub and showed their support towards me and that felt good to know they cared but it still doesn’t stop me from thinking that the past 11.5 years meant nothing to my ex and that is destroying me.

I’ve been persuaded to see someone on Monday to talk about it but I truly don’t know if I’ll make it until then"
SuicideWatch,ffim37w,t1_ffil00f,1579977140.0,I worked and saved as much as possible to allow me to move to Australia. I was doing well over there until this Monday when it all fell apart
BreakUps,ffc2b8j,t1_ffabexg,1579789764.0,Thank you
BreakUps,ff910i0,t1_ff78v9o,1579702123.0,I hope you’re ok mate. Apparently things get better with time? I wish you all the best
BreakUps,ff907h2,t1_ff5qm5i,1579701491.0,"Haha I hope that’s true. I blocked her, her family and her friends from my social media a long time ago in the hopes I’d never find out about her personal life. Unfortunately that wasn’t the case"
BreakUps,ff904u6,t1_ff5kuwp,1579701433.0,"I know you’re right, it’s definitely the best we can do. Unfortunately it’s also the hardest ."
BreakUps,ff90323,t1_ff5na7x,1579701394.0,"I’ve got to be honest I can’t see how I could possibly enjoy this time. I feel so unbelievably low to the point where I’m contemplating ending it all.

I did a lot of growing up when we split up, I took control of my finances, threw myself into the gym and got into really good shape, saved s hell of a lot of money but it all seems like it’s been for nothing. 

Thanks for the reply I really appreciate it"
BreakUps,ff8zpxp,t1_ff5kqxi,1579701103.0,"Thank you, I really appreciate it"
BreakUps,ff8zol7,t1_ff6xrg0,1579701074.0,"Thanks for the helpful words there mate, exactly what I needed and very well thought out"
BreakUps,ff2u80m,t3_eramh5,1579524356.0,"I made the mistake of leaving my ex because I didn’t want children. Now I think about her everyday and the life I left behind. 

This quote applies directly to me, unfortunately."
WatchPeopleDieInside,ff0927q,t1_ff040fz,1579466509.0,"I think he’s referring to the fact she doesn’t seem to have any reaction at the end, the title is just ckickbait"
crossfit,feyik5p,t1_feybgia,1579445925.0,"What’s that, I can’t find it mate"
crossfit,feyiert,t1_fey8wwh,1579445903.0,I’m flying out and my luggage is already to the max so unfortunately I can’t bring any DBs or KBs with me
crossfit,feyi0xp,t1_fey7afp,1579445851.0,"A weighted vest is a really good idea actually, they’re a bit pricey I think but I’ll see if I can get a cheap one before I leave."
BreakUps,fegnuui,t1_fegne5q,1579098283.0,"No she was fully aware and understood my reasons, it still didn’t make it any easier for her though I guess. 
Saying goodbye to the person you love so much is the worst feeling imaginable."
BreakUps,fefp454,t1_fedy7wb,1579061301.0,I had nothing but the best intentions for her. I never wanted children and thought it was unfair to deprive her of that
BreakUps,fediqtt,t1_feb8r9h,1579012569.0,"I am the same age and pretty much exactly the same thing happened to me except I was that guy who tried to get my partner back when she was trying to move on. 
It took a while for it to really sink in that I could never love anyone as much as her and for me to realise I didn’t want anybody else. 

She said to me and that I’d destroyed a part of her she can never get back, that I broke her heart and she could never forgive me. 
The worst thing was that I never wanted to hurt her, all I wanted was for her to live the life she deserved and I couldn’t give her that.

It took me 3 months to realise that having children wouldn’t be that bad because she would be there with me and we would be a team, but by that time it was too late and she seemingly can’t bear to talk to me anymore. My heart is broken, this happened nearly a year ago now and I think about her every day. 

I caused the woman I loved more than anything in this world so much pain and I have to live with that every day of my life."
Humanoidencounters,fdhq1kv,t1_fdgqo56,1578427902.0,"I love the whole fringe thing as well but to say this is reminiscent of Keel or Vallee is a massive overstatement to say the very least. They literally have nothing but a few coincidences that derive from a strange email they received last year. The biggest of which was when one of them said he saw a tin can in his mind and when they went to the cave in question there was a tin can. 
What they fail to note however is that he also mentioned at least 50-100 other random words that never materialised when he was in his little ‘trance’...throw enough shit and at least some will stick, right? 
To say this is love action Skinwalker Ranch is, in my opinion, being WAY too kind. Nothing really happens. They could have made a 2 hour long documentary out of all the material they have but instead they have 8-10 hour long videos that they monetise with boring drawn out scenes of them doing nothing at all exciting with boring music playing over it in an attempt to make the viewer feel ‘freaked out’.
I really don’t understand why it’s received the hype that it has."
Humanoidencounters,fdgbtqp,t1_fdga8wt,1578389100.0,"I absolutely agree. Towards the end of the second series I stopped watching because everything was a SYNCHRONICITY!
“Oh my god there’s a brown car driving down the road you do know what this means guys...Terry rhymes with berry and when berry’s go off they go brown...synchronicity!”

It’s like no guys stop bending over backwards to shoehorn in coincidences. I tried hard to get into it I really did, but after maybe 5 hours of watching it I came to the conclusion that these guys really have nothing extraordinary at all. If they did the world would have seen it by now."
AbsoluteUnits,fd9607l,t1_fd9435k,1578228909.0,"Yes I am. I’m lucky though, I have wifi here in my cave so I can bicker with people in the internet like you"
AbsoluteUnits,fd92lm4,t1_fd91k2t,1578227465.0,"Ah will I now...you’re assuming I don’t because of half a sentence in a Reddit thread, you joker.
Like it or not the conversation is awkward as hell and should have been had off camera. To make it seem even worse US strongman Brian Shaw is interviewed next with his wife who is incredibly supportive of him - a guy who for arguments sake trains EXACTLY THE SAME...yet there is no awkward telling off or cringy small talk. 
I never said it’s cringy to respect your wife so please don’t put words in my mouth. Tbh I highly doubt you’ve even seen the documentary I’m referring to so I’m going to assume you’re talking out of your arse. 
And stop trying to be such a do-gooder on the internet, it’s ridiculous."
AbsoluteUnits,fd922qy,t1_fd8n3qt,1578227154.0,"No I didn’t miss it at all. That has nothing to do with his wife telling him what to do and him acting cringy af.
In the following scenes Brian Shaws and his wife are interviewed and there’s no awkwardness at all. The cringy conversation should have been had off camera.

I’ve got absolutely nothing against Eddie Hall but if you watch the scene I’m referring to you’ll see what I mean (starts at 16:59)

AbsoluteUnits,fd8gmpr,t1_fd8as1y,1578218117.0,"There’s a documentary on Netflix where he’s next to his wife and she says he’s not going to compete anymore to which he says he might do m, just bit strongman and then she starts to cry. It’s soooo cringy to see how under the thumb he is."
AbsoluteUnits,fd8fzes,t1_fd818no,1578217988.0,"What’s your problem here? It’s well known that he broke the world record for heaviest deadlift under strongman rules in 2016. He’s pretty famous in both the US and the UK.

What are you trying to achieve by nay saying and being facetious?"
crossfit,fc83591,t1_fc7zusj,1577525694.0,"What a fantastic story, thanks for sharing man. I’m glad you got your health back on track after you fell ill. It must have been incredibly tough for you dealing with that as well as the end of your relationship, props to you for fighting and coming through it.
If it only took you months after that then I’m hoping it won’t be too long for me to get back some level of fitness.

Unfortunately I don’t have a community behind me as I left my old box when I moved to Australia. It’s ok though because I actually really love training so motivation isn’t necessarily a problem for me when I have a routine."
crossfit,fc2a575,t1_fbxmdkf,1577348068.0,"It’s good to hear you got your drinking in check dude and that you’re back on track! I think the hardest thing will be lifting considerably lower but I’ll come to terms with it.

Thanks for the reply mate"
