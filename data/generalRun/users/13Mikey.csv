Knowing that you don't have to be on the same page as somebody else to agree with them is a refreshing idea. Much more than ""agree to disagree"" which just leaves both people thinking the other is a stubborn hopeless case."
facepalm,ff9xrto,t1_ff9syhq,1579723807.0,"There's a book that ended up being life changing for me that addresses things like this. It's called Liminal thinking and addresses how two people can have realities that are very different from each other and yet are both still true.

I always like to tell the story of when my wife and I were in the car looking for a specific business. She told me that it was up ahead on the road and I couldn't see it. She insisted that it was there and I just couldn't see it. Eventually, we had driven far enough that the bridge the blocked my vision (I'm 6'2"") no longer did and I could see what she did (at 5'3"").

Two completely different realities (it was *not* there for me, it was there for her) and we were both right.

A friend brought up the concept of tying your identity to things and how it can cause you to defend things that you (probably) know are wrong because if they're wrong, that part of you is wrong. 

I've been very careful about what to hitch my wagon to as a result. And it's liberating to have that freedom.

Hypothetical example is if you're in a ten team league and there is an undisputed top tier of 14 players (again, this is hypothetical so bear with me).

You'd want to draft in the 7-10 spot in round one so you could get two of those undisputed top 14 players. 

Example this year is that you might have been able to get something like Dalvin Cook & Mike Thomas if you picked 10 & 11 and that would be better than someone who took someone like LeVeon Bell at #6 and then a second tier WR at number 15.

I've tended to bounce from hobby to hobby, some lasting months and some years but cooking is by far the most rewarding hobby I've had and I don't know that there are many that could be more rewarding.

I always tell people I'm classically trained by the Food Network to get a giggle but it's actually true. I used to watch Rachel Ray every night after work just because it was on and interesting to me. 

One day I was like ""You know, maybe I could actually do one of these 30 minute meal things."" I had just started dating my (now wife) girlfriend a few months earlier and decided to surprise her with a stuffed french bread pizza. Damn thing took me 90 minutes but to be fair, nobody had me prepped ahead of time. 

Fast forward 16 years or so and thanks to people like Rachel Ray, Kenji, Bobby Flay, Emeril, Tony Bourdain, Aaron Franklin, Aarón Sánchez, and countless others I feel like I'm a pretty damn good cook. 

I only wish I had gotten into it sooner (I just turned 45) but I know I have a lot of good meals ahead of me.

As I drank the bottle down I changed the ratio to more and more scotch until it was essentially scotch on the rocks with a splash of soda. 

A while after that I just ended up putting a splash of water in because my club soda always went flat before I could go through bottle.

Part of me wants to roll the dice and see if anybody better slides to me at that pick but I really loved Golladay this year and think a full year with a healthy Stafford could turn him into a fringe WR1.
