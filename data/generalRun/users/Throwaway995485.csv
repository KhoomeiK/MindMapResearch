AskReddit,ff8jk43,t3_es909o,1579681471.0,"Today I drove 1000k up the east coast of Australia and back again. I am in my hyped up can't fkn sleep high mode right now.  
I saw the places in NSW and QLD that were burned before xmas and they were beautiful.  
All the grass is back and the trees are covered in new growth.  
Because the fires were so intense the whole tree was burnt rather than the usual  6'-8' at the base. Normal fires just burn the undergrowth and leave the tops unscathed..these fires toasted everything. A few weeks ago when I went by they all looked like they would be lost but the last fortnight they have all come back.  
It is strange to see. The trees are completely covered in what looks like green fur. I will stop and take some pix next week.  
There was also a giant storm that chased me 600k up the highway last night...sat on top of me for hours. Was bloody awful.  
And all they had on the radio was Greta and Donny and the sports rort corruption that is current news down here.  
I am looking forward to going to bed. I might have to take a couple of phernergans to fuck me up and stop the itch from 26 hours in a fucking truck.  
Edit : I also have a suspicion that a snake has gotten into my place while I was away. There are noises that aren't right coming from the kitchen but I will get some denial time in before I face that shit."

I am pretty old and I am not sure if there is a cure for horrible memories or you just learn to live with them.
