AskWomen,ff30t3q,t3_eqxs0f,1579530633.0,"My mom has passed away but her and I were incredibly close. Growing up I was always told it's better to the truth and she reinforced that by doing exactly what she said she would do. ""If you tell me the truth you'll be in a lot less trouble than if you lie and I find out."" She would keep her word on that and even if it was little stuff early on I learned it really was smarter to just be honest if I did something I shouldn't have done or said something I shouldn't have said (I have a younger brother so most of this was me being mean to him growing up tbh) but this also translated into deeper things. I always felt like I could be honest with my mom even when I knew she would be so disappointed I still knew I could call her. 
When I was 14 I went to a halloween party and drank a bit and told her about it and she was like, you know I'm disappointed because you know better, but I'm glad you told me and I hope you always know that if this ever happened and you needed me, I would always come pick you up."" But of course she'd reiterate that she expected me to not do it again, but I wasn't terrified of telling her because she would respect that I was honest and sometimes I think she felt like having the courage to be honest was more important than punishment for what I had done wrong and I don't know that all parents would agree on that but I've turned out to be a very honest, forward person and I'm really proud of that aspect of my personality and I also really value the truth and appreciate her so much for always being a person I could talk to, truly about anything, from my beginning to her end.

And now I'm sad from writing this, but I think it's worth sharing.

college,fen8tgy,t1_femw151,1579279480.0,"Yeah I definitely think it's an irrational anxiety situation. I try to go to bed roughly around the same time, maybe just an hour later on other nights and I set an alarm on non school days so I dont over sleep and ideally wouldn't have a hard time falling asleep later lol but that clearly isn't happening, but I do think I need to take time and get my mind off school by reading or watching something, thank you for your input?"
college,fen5b2i,t1_femwify,1579277294.0,"I definitely need to start spending more time away from screens before bed time but last semester it was never an issue so I'm thinking it's got to be more jitters/anxiety, I just don't get why it's so bad all of a sudden. I definitely would rather work on some of the questions you mentioned because placebo or not l, I do hate the idea of taking stuff to sleep but man, this is just not gonna work haha.

AmItheAsshole,fdvwi44,t1_fdtybdx,1578752452.0,I usually have no issue saying no but this was just a more sensitive issue since it was in regards to one of the most important days for her as well as mine so I just was more apprehensive. In most other cases I'm quite honest and upfront about my thoughts/feelings.
AmItheAsshole,fdt7dek,t1_fdt55q2,1578712885.0,"I agree, and mine and my husband's was super chill and we figured it all out super easily, no hassle and my SIL is trying to force a lot of things because quite frankly, they're irresponsible and low on funds but want to get married anyway and while I wouldn't say she's going nuts over the wedding, she is definitely going way outside her means of living for it which I cannot comprehend.  My best friend got married in the woods with 1 witness and the officiant and had a small reception after with family/friends, it really doesn't have to be what so many people make it."
AmItheAsshole,fdt41aj,t1_fdt1s43,1578711633.0,If I genuinely trusted her to take care of them and return them I might be more willing to but I just don't think she will and I feel like she'll make it weird to get them back.

I'm a very blunt person usually but since this is in regards to her important day as well I wanted to see if I was being overly petty and shouldn't bother but I kind of was already planning to just say no. 

I should've said no from the start but here we are lol"

Super unloyal to our relationship and then it would become an argument where I got emotionally/physically hurt then I'd fight back, piss him off extra and then it would get really extreme and then he'd feel bad for hurting me and then try to self harm and then I'd try to stop him but put myself back in danger. It was just an awful, vicious cycle. Then I'd finally decide I want to leave and it was, oh I need you, I'm sorry, aaaand repeat till one day I was finally done."

AskReddit,fcxhbot,t1_fcx1q2z,1578062931.0,"My ex was extremely abusive and also I firmly believe had/has mental issues and we were in a clearly toxic relationship and whenever we would end up in a verbal and physical fight, a lot of times he would sort of snap out of it and like suddenly feel really sorry for what was happening  and then get really depressed about it and suicidal over what he had done to me and there were multiple times he would take a gun to his head or a knife to the wrist and I would fight him to get it away from him and it's the most terrifying feeling to try and fight a serious weapon out of an unstable person's hands. You're just wondering if you're going to die in the process of trying to help this person and in my case, the one who did so much to hurt you but it's just not that simple to not do anything. 

Sorry you had to go through that, even though the situation is different, it's still very scary and can definitely be a memory that haunts you."
college,fcv3r92,t3_eitwz9,1577994034.0,"I've totally been feeling the same way and similar situation too. As dumb as it sounds, I literally have a little list in my phone notes of self care things I can/should do when I need a break to decompress and let out some stress. Even little things like, stop and go do a face mask (I know that's more feminine but everyone should do a facemask now and then lol), or like go walk around the park for a little bit, like when is the last time I saw the sun whenever I get deep in school work. Last semester I got really burnt out very fast from working 2 jobs and taking a full class load so this semester I'm trying really hard to prep for that stress better. I did drop one of my jobs which will help a lot but my classes are getting harder now that, similar to you, I'm out of all the filler classes. (Environmental Sci: Biodiveristy, Conservation & Nat.

television,fcjzsgj,t1_fcjdkuj,1577711992.0,"Yeah I guess so lmao. I swear I don't do this often! 
That's funny how people just have such different ways of watching the same things. I usually only would watch a few at a time but on true days off I love just getting to go deep into a show/movie series."
television,fcjbbyu,t1_fcjavc3,1577682030.0,"The way I worded that made it sound like that, my bad. I started it one day and watched like 8 episodes and then watched 10 the next day lol. Which is still kind of insane but I have very little time before tur next semester starts and I won't be able to watch anything so I just fully committed haha.
I forget stuff very easily when too much time passes between episodes so for a storyline like this one I'm very glad I watched it so back to back for the first watch but I'd really like rewatch to digest it all better. Ugh it's just so damn good!"
television,fcjaaal,t3_e13b14,1577681207.0,"This post caused my husband to watch it but because I was kind of focused on school work and not sure if it would really be good I had put off watching it, but he was straight up glued to the TV to watch it. So the other day I started finally, and was done at 2am the next day. I couldn't stop watching! I loved the OA and still do but this definitely took the place as my favorite show I've ever seen and I'm so glad I watched it! 

The actors were so good and they really did well with the voice over to have it in English. It was weird for the first couple minutes for me but man, you just get so into the story it's so unnoticeable so quickly. I seriously can't get over how incredibly thought out, well acted, and just down right interesting this show is."
