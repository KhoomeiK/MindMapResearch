Weighted is what you are looking for, but not all weighted systems are created equal. For example, I have a cheaper Casio 88 weighted, and a higher end Casio Privia 88. The Privia has weighted keys with hammer action. Both the same brand, both weighted, both drastically different. Weighted with hammer action is what you probably are looking for - often these actually have mechanical hammer action components. But the way they are marketed varies by brand. Long story short, you get what you pay for. Expect the feel you are looking for to be around a grand and up. Anything with mechanical leverage will be the ones that mimic the feel best."

WeAreTheMusicMakers,ffm9pzi,t1_ffm981m,1580050973.0,"In ableton you need to tell it what device to use (that’s the asio driver) and then tell it what output on the device to use. Most interfaces have multiple outputs, so ableton would need to know where to send the audio. In most cases you will always want to send this to main outs or 1/2 out depending on how it is named on the device. And yes - the controller thing was correct, and you want to plug speakers/headphones into the interface."
WeAreTheMusicMakers,ffm8i5j,t1_ffm7v0e,1580050330.0,"2 and 3 are the same thing. In your software, choose the asio driver for your connected interface. Done. No additional steps :) edit - except specifying your output ports in your software. So for example “1/2 out” depending on your device.  

Midi isn’t audio - it’s just a data signal for HOW to play music, for example note, velocity, sustain, etc. none of that is an audio stream. It’s literally just data. That’s why midi files are incredibly small. So your midi device is transmitting that performance data. Your software receives that and runs it through your virtual instrument, which uses that data to create an audio stream from samples, derived from what your midi performance data told it to sound like (very non technical definition but hopefully that clarifies). That audio stream is then passed out to your audio interface and plays out the outputs of the interface. Does that make sense?"
WeAreTheMusicMakers,ffm6o60,t1_ffm5wmu,1580049399.0,"So asio is a type of audio driver - there are multiple, as you have seen (MMC for example). Not all devices support asio, but all professional interfaces do. Asio is the best standard for low latency/high bit rate performance, thats why it is preferable for audio. Every device you will buy will have a driver from the manufacturer you install for ASIO. Use that. 

Asio4all is an open source generic toolkit for solving some common problems people face with asio devices. That largest one being that to use more than one interface at once (for example, two interfaces with 2 inputs each for 4 total). It’s kind of a hack. It does do what’s it is supposed to do, bu you’re also making hardware devices work in a way they were not intended. So point being unless you have a need to be solved by asio4all, there is no reason to use it. And even if you did have that need, it’s hacky at best, introduces a little more latency (since it’s a software solution) and is prone to audio dropouts when using multiple devices because they have independent buffers. 

Long story short - get one device that meets your I/O needs. Use the stock driver. Make music happily. :)"
WeAreTheMusicMakers,ffm4sew,t1_ffm4asz,1580048543.0,"Yea exactly - they’re both usb devices but for different purposes. The midi controller connects to usb but shows up as a device to send/receive midi messages, therefore it has zero to do with the audio chain. This is recognized in your software as a midi data I/O device. Plug In your audio interface into USB and it shows up as an audio device. That gets connected to your software as the audio input/output device. They share the same bus on the PC (assuming you have them on the same USB host on the motherboard) but since midi data is so light there are zero issues for overloading the bus. One other note - that usb interface can either be just for your music app or it can be the system device too. Generally you should dedicate the interface to your audio app for best performance as there is one and only one audio stream feeding the device. Leave the computer set to your internal sound card. This also means no other audio from the computer will play out your interface. Which is a good thing to do when performing obviously. For the same reason one would typically set the operating system to not play alert sounds on a performance computer. 

Hope that helps!

EDIT - one other note. Always try the default asio drivers from the manufacturer first before asio4all. The primary benefit of asio4all is using more than one asio device at the same time (multiple interfaces) and as a result it usually is slightly less performance friendly than the stock manufacturer drivers."
WeAreTheMusicMakers,ffm42ix,t3_eu5roh,1580048046.0,"The latency is a result of the buffer on the audio side - the midi controller will do nothing to change this. You absolutely need an asio interface to reduce latency, because the solution to latency is always hardware in the middle to optimize around the buffer to get latency as low as possible. The lower the better but anything under 128 samples or so should feel a lot more playable.  Really solid interfaces can be had under 100 bucks. If money is a concern look used. The presonus audio box has exceptionally low latency for a $100 device."

WeAreTheMusicMakers,fezn42b,t1_fezlpi9,1579459220.0,"I have an NT1 and it’s a good general purpose mic that can be massaged in post as needed. But the color is very curved to me, harsh highs, lots of proximity effect for lows. Honestly you can’t appreciate what a difference a mic makes until you play with them. One thing to consider: you have some extra cash. Find a few mics that sound good to you on YouTube. Buy a few reasonable priced ones on eBay.  Sell the ones you don’t like for roughly the same price you bought them. It’s a great way to test in the comfort of your own home with little risk/minimal loss. Truth is a variety of mics is critical anyway, especially for recording others but even for yourself. Different tracks have different tonality and that can really help. I have in addition to the 47 for vocals a number of mics and they all sound very different for a source. Most of those were eBay :) variety is super helpful. Recording is just as much a creative process as writing and performing.  

So recommendations - for a tube mic you can get a used Rode NTK for 300-400. Not a bad place to start as they are also super modifiable. I replaced the capsule in mine with a C12 clone and put a Telefunken tube in it and it’s like a dream for basically the same price as new. But even as a stock mic, it’s a nice tonal difference. Worth considering. For a preamp, a used Avalon can be had at a reasonable price, maybe 650. I personally prefer a 73 on myself so that’s my main pre. My friend has a much softer feminine voice and he’s Avalon all the way. It’s up to your tonality needs. But Those two together is about 1k used and would be a massive upgrade. But there are some many options and it really matters what your sound is, and what is best for that sound. I can’t stress enough to watch reviews and listen to comparisons to understand the gear, then buy something that sounds like what you want to hear. 


Also I almost forgot.  What about headphones? Having a great set of closed cups for recording (like Sony MDR’s) and a good set of opens for mixing (HD 650s for example, there are many between 180 and 350ish) are important for having options in the studio."
WeAreTheMusicMakers,fezl3vz,t3_eqz72n,1579458486.0,"Are you happy with the NT1 for vocals? Are you male or female? That can make a big difference in the right mic for vocals, and you may yield the best gain there. You may want to look into varying up your mic options - for example, a tube mic or even a ribbon. Watch videos and find a tone that matches both your voice and the style you are going for. Also, an outboard preamp can go a long way. This would then just line in to your interface. 

What are your needs? Are you looking for one or two big upgrades or to spread that money around a few lesser things? As an example, I recently ponied up for a bunch of warm audio gear - a wa47 tube mic, a wa73 pre, and a 76 compressor (more for instrument usage than vocals) and am considering a 2A compressor for vocals. You’d be amazed what a good chain of hardware outboard gear will do to your tone being close right out of the box. Granted - that’s an expensive list. But any one of those categories is in your price range and would be a level up (mic/pre/compressor). Also, don’t rule out used or refurbished. Something to think about. 

Also a side note on compressors - they are almost always better when stacked and staged, so having a subtle hardware comp of a few dB on just about any source on the way in can add some good base color before you move on to plugins and groups with compressors and a master compressor. It all adds up."
WeAreTheMusicMakers,fezg3ly,t3_eqzbtr,1579456961.0,"Everyone has a different process. It was notebooks for me for years, but my handwriting got so bad I ditched that years ago :) I now use IA writer for my phone, nice no nonsense editor. Ties into Dropbox. Then, when working with my co-writer who is three states away online, I cherry pick the good ones into google drive and we get on video conference and co-write/edit the doc together while working on melodies. Point being, everyone’s process is about whatever makes the creative process as painless as possible for each step. Don’t let technology get in the way, use what works and just let it flow.

WeAreTheMusicMakers,feo6ma1,t3_epwe37,1579295856.0,"I recently bought a key lab mkii 61 and I love it. Key response is fantastic, tons of controls, and if you use arturia software (which it comes with a bunch of if you don’t currently) you don’t have to map anything for those. For other instruments you can map just about everything except transport controls, and the transport controls can be put into MMC mode through the software editor anyway, along with a ton of other tweaks. 

Having said all of that, it depends on your needs. The one I have is not weighted action or full scale, but that’s fine because I have another 88 weighted keyboard for when I need that in my studio, so I was okay with that..The key lab is my main controller in my desk and works perfectly for that, and will probably be the core of my live rig. Expensive for a midi controller? Absolutely. But it’s a great piece of gear. Zero regrets from me."
WeAreTheMusicMakers,feo4yvx,t3_eq3i07,1579295171.0,"What iamthegoodest said about sub Hz filtering is smart - high pass everything below fundamentals that might have some mud down there unexpectedly. The other thing to look at is at the mastering step use a multi band compressor on the chain, so you can further control the frequency range more explicitly and make it tighter. Attack is more important in higher frequencies so you clamp the lower quite a bit and with a multi band comp not destroy your entire spectrum. 

I’m sure there are more/better options but those are Both worth investigating and have done wonders for me with similar issues."

You can use VST instruments and effects in real time with routing, and save them as preset “songs” that can then be arranged into a set list. So, you can preset a song with all the instrumentation settings ready to go, and you can set one or more midi controllers or audio inputs to route through them. That, plus sample playback and triggering (which can fill in the structure and base track that you play live over), with a few midi controllers, pads, live instruments - you wind up with lots of possibilities. I’m currently disassembling produced tracks myself that I’m figuring out how to perform live as a 2 person show, and this is definitely the hub of whatever we wind up with."
