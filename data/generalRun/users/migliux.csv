 Maybe it has something to do with the smell of the owner, since we have a very strong bond with our pup.

However, he knows that it's not his bed and he's not really allowed to sleep there, so whenever I get back, he does that ""I know I can't sleep here, but could we make an exception this time?"" look. And for him to leave, one simple command is enough. 

Funny thing is that if he has to leave, he shows his disappointment in an audible way - grumbling and sighing."
