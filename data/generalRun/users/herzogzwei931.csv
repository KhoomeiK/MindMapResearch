OakIsland,ff5va0i,t3_ertyvt,1579611455.0,"Earlier in the one of the first seasons, the crew would get together at a bar and you could see Dave Blankenship drinking a brown liquid. Then at the end of the episode, he would say â€œItâ€™s Crown Timeâ€. Thus the Crown Royal joke was borne. So basically everyone thinks Dave is a drunk and drinks crown. Now it has become so popular, that Crown Royal actually has commercials during the show."

Every time we play, you can see how closely it actually follows the events of the war. A lot of â€œWhat if they did this during the warâ€ ? How could Germany and Japan actually win the war?â€ It is fun on a number of levels."
HumansBeingBros,feybogd,t3_eqtmun,1579443363.0,"Sorry to disappoint everyone, but when a few bitter people in the town saw this video, they posted shit on the local Facebook page, he was forced to donate every thing to charity. 

â€œAfter the boots were donated to Coelho, some people on social media criticized the school and the students for an alleged â€œethics violationâ€.

I had to explain to my kids that some people in life have such empty lives, devoid of emotion, and most likely miserable little cunts, that shit like this happens. 

I also told them that these miserable people were probably abused as kids. 

My kids responded â€œGood! They deserve it!â€"

Great story, BB59 was going to the scrap yard, but there was a penny campaign by the kids in Fall River to raise the money to buy Big Mamey. I think it was $50k or something back in the 50â€™s. That many pennies could probably sink a DD"
WorldOfWarships,fdokz9f,t3_emfm53,1578607255.0,"I hate CV too. I have not played in years because it was so boring. But I heard that T4 had tons of 6 and even 8 CV matches. So I got a Langley and started playing just to troll. But I actually started liking the new programs: unlimited planes and impossible to shoot down. In one match with 8 cvs playing, one person said â€œAll I do is go in circles the whole game and avoid planes. But then I was in a 6 cv game and the opposing team just huddled together like a pack of sheep and slowly cut down the whole map. Good strategy. Personally after seeing this, it reminded me that this is probably more accurate to historical warfare in WWII. by the way it is very difficult to get anywhere near top in damage with a cv"
