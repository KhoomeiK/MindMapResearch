KingCrimson,fdcxf55,t3_ekhq0p,1578287148.0,It's nostalgic to me because the first time I heard it was on the show Kenny Vs Spenny. It's a show about 2 friends that have ridiculous competitions and the loser gets a humiliation chosen by the winner. They did one challenge of who could wear a dead octopus on their head the longest and one of them doses the other with lsd without him knowing. At one point while he's tripping they play a bastardized version of the song. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQ2NcAabXFM
