absolutelynotmeirl,ffrxsqp,t3_euolls,1580168326.0,"Actually that is depression. Depression is a state of mind and a perspective. But your perspective and state of mind can be influenced with the hormones going in your head. If your reward system is fucked up and you don’t feel gratification from anything, you’re depressed.

Look, don’t gatekeep depression. But don’t say you’re severely depressed just cuz you’ve had a bad day every here and then. A large part of depression isn’t just “super sad”. You feel nothing, you’ve got no energy to do anything, to wake up, to brush your teeth, to feed yourself, to go outside, to catch up with friends. Like your body is heavy and it takes a lot to do those things. Before you realize it’s just in your head. Thing is though, the way you see the world is indistinguishable between perception and reality. It’s not ever just “yea bro my mom threw away my weed, I’m depressed as fuck I’m really gonna go kill myself if she doesn’t give me money to replace it”. 


BUT I can understand that this meme is supposed to show an optimistic perspective. The way it should’ve been made is writing “if you ever feel down in the dumps, it helps to look around and see what you’re happy to have, find the things that bring a smile to your face”. As opposed to gatekeeping depression"

LifeProTips,fffzf1w,t1_ffbr9h1,1579895144.0,"Lmao you guys are funny. I don’t even actively care about these things because it’s pretty obvious when anything’s on your screen, the person saying it has an ulterior motive, which is usually to get more attention. If some news outlet is talking about pretty objective things like Australia being on fire and the prime minister not doing anything about it, like yeah that’s shitty. But the moment someone starts putting words into someone else’s mouth, or introduces some problem about “a manager at a local Starbucks said x and people are pissed” I don’t care. If it’s political I especially don’t care because that shit is a convicted web of events and he said she said shit. If you’re getting riled up it’s because someone wants you to be.

I think it’s fine to have an opinion but it’s not fine to be more defensive about it than you are informed. If someone told me that the prime minister had a reason not to be in AUS which was because of him having lung cancer so he can’t be around fumes, then I’m not gonna be adamant about claiming him to be a dick.

If someone talks about bitcoin and wether it’s good or bad, I’m not gonna have a strong stance at all."
