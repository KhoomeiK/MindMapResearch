I hope that all the engineers who originally discussed the butterknife can finally answer my question about this ice cream scoop with the ""antifreeze"" liquid sealed in it. 

Any engineers: What is in the handle, and how can it work to soften the ice cream if it is not directly in contact with the ice cream?

Not trained, he just does it. My hubby had diabetic neuropathy, so he could never tell what was going on down there. When the dog would hit on his feet, it was time for antibiotics. If we ignored the warning, my husband's leg would get hot, swollen, and red from waiting too long. The dog will also let you know if you have toe fungus or infection in other parts of the body. Sometimes, people will come over just to get checked."

aww,feis2vn,t1_feh2uhk,1579145774.0,"No cat, but this is actually how I clean the yard after a storm. My girl dog LOVES all the dead branches that fall down in the wind. She brings them in through the dog door (the big ones make for some pretty hilarious times). Then, she climbs into her bed and breaks them into tiny little pieces. I just come by with the broom and dustpan afterward. This happens constantly, and by the time I make it out there on the weekend to pick up the debris, it's all gone! 

(She also brings in any rock she can find, I have a giant bucket full in my dining room. Tried returning them to the yard, but learned that they just end up coming back in.)"
90DayFiance,feiq2w3,t1_feh18lm,1579144390.0,"I'm afraid this will sound silly compared to ""real"" trauma, such as that suffered  Tania, Syngin, and many of the posters here, and because of this I haven't told anyone about it (well, I did, but they think I am joking), but I was traumatized by that stupid false ballistic missile alert that we had in Hawaii last year. 

Sounds dumb doesn't it? Traumatized by a false alarm? 

Believe me, I try to poo-poo it just as much as any objective observer would, but honestly, I can't believe how deeply it affected me. There have been several television shows that have taken plot points from this real-life event, and when I stumble on them, I just break down as all the feelings of the alert come flooding back. 

When we got the alert, I closed up every window in my house (I am alone btw), and then I closed all interior doors so that I could be at the most central point of my house, I filled my bathtub with water to be ready, and left a good-bye voicemail to my son. Then, all I could do was sit and wait. If anyone is unfamiliar, it took the government more than 20 minutes to issue a false alarm alert. When it was over, I immediately ordered a gas mask, extra canisters, and potassium iodide pills. 

If I can be affected so greatly by something that small, I can't even imagine what Syngin, (and Tania too) are wrestling with, and, yes, Tania should have been waaay more receptive to what Syngin was saying.

Uh-oh, just writing this has opened the door ..."

Of course, any evolution is gonna be better than the basic, but compared to others on that level, it'll be a junky one. I always thought that if I just power up the heck out of my basic Pokemon, then I'll have an equally powered evolution, but no.

gaming,fefrymk,t1_fefqbio,1579063440.0,"Happens to me all the time, like I want to evolve a nice little Machop with a high HP and a nice ability like Cross Chop, and then he'll evolve into a Machoke with less than half the HP and an attack like Brick Break. 

I used to try to evolve the best of my basic Pokemon, but once I noticed that happening, I checked the boards, and other people confirmed that just because your basic Pokemon is strong doesn't mean that your evolution will be. So now, I hang onto my most powerful basic, and evolve the second strongest, hoping to get lucky with the evolution.

Barring an out-of-whack metabolism, losing weight is such a simple formula: take in less calories than you expend, period.
