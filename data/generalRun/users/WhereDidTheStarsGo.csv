EatCheapAndHealthy,ff9of6w,t1_ff9n6s2,1579717255.0," Thank you for linking Jeff Nippard's video on this. People really think lifters eat too much protein and it's annoying, we don't!"
EatCheapAndHealthy,ff9o994,t3_esb3f5,1579717146.0,"Hey man! I'm into the fitness as well. It is difficult to hit your protein on a bulk without meat but here is some alternatives:

Egg whites:  They're cheap, contain over 100g of protein per carton, literally buy them in bulk at a Costco and drink that baby every day.

Whey Isolate: Yes this is diary, get yourself a whey isolate protein shake.

Soya: Soya has more protein per 100g than chicken! Excellent source of protein.

Nuts

Beans.

1g per lb of lean bodyweight is a good protein intake for muscle growth. Don't listen to people telling you that 140g of protein a day is too much-  they probably don't have an idea what it's like trying to force your body to build muscle naturally. (Of course normal recommendations are going to be much lower, but that's for ""normal"" people, we don't want to stay ""normal"")"

Athleanx,ff49pe7,t1_ff42pww,1579558602.0,"You'd definitely be able to use it as a daily routine. It's got strength training 2-3 times a week and Athlean Burst training 2 times a week (excellent conditioning, SO MUCH BETTER than boring, ineffective cardio)
It also has a challenge at the end of each week on your rest days, that are not only fun and challenging- but make you realise the progress you're making.

In all honesty, it's a splendid program. I think the best way to do it is to use weights with it. But nevertheless, the program is genius."

Fitness,ff3u606,t1_ff3sfki,1579548922.0,"Yep, get you a green resistance band and head over to a proper chinup bar and preform the exercise with the resistance band. I would HIGHLY suggest preforming pause reps, so once you get to the top of the movement, hold the contracted position for a brief second before letting yourself back down.

The resistance band will help enough and it is a slightly different movement pattern than the assisted pull up machines.

Bonus: increase your rest times between pull up sets, it's okay to rest 90s-3mins."

Big Tip: use some sort of padding (underwear, a cloth, small towel)  on your elbows when doing the rear delt exercise- I did mine on a hard wooden floor and it hampered my reps because of how sore it was rubbing against the floor."

The tribesmen tell the men to go off and find 10 of 1 type of fruit and bring it back to the village if they want to be set free. So the men set of, and not before long, the first man returns with 10 apples.

The tribesmen tell him they'll set him free if he puts all 10 fruit up his ass- However if he makes a sound, they will kill him.
The man is about to insert the second one before screaming out and the tribesmen kill him.

The second man comes back with 10 grapes. Again the tribesman tell him they'll set him free if he puts all 10 fruit up his ass without making a sound.
The second man is about to insert the 10th grape when he suddenly bursts out with uncontrollable laughter- and the tribesmen kill him.

In heavan the first man asks the second man, ""why did you suddenly laugh? You were SO close!""

I miss the guy I use to be.  I don't know if I've made the right decision by coming to a foreign country. I have no friends, and I haven't been in a relationship for over a year. I miss the ambitious, high-status, inspirational guy that J use to be in my home city. Now I'm a nobody, and I'm not taking it the right way. I need to start finding my passions again and topple my goals, and teach the new people around me why they should respect me.
The loneliness is the hardest part, where I was from I had THE best circle. Full of intelligent people achieving things- that use to motivate me to crush my goals as well and achieve things in my life.
Those people are gone now. And I feel myself slowly slipping away.

This is also the first moment in my life that I ever felt like I needed a girlfriend- typically it was visa versa.
