bipolar,fcdvhm0,t1_fccbxg9,1577614272.0,"Lmao I like the stims tho. They make me not eat, get hella work done, and I donâ€™t feel a need for socialization"
bipolar,fcbxqxc,t1_fcbmes5,1577592150.0,"Bc I donâ€™t have cycling moods and never really have like I only get really low for maybe a week at most but very rarely and Iâ€™d say that itâ€™s normal and healthy. I had a period of acute stress bc a close friend of mine had some bad stuff happen to her and I knew abt the situation and couldnâ€™t help (you can pm me for more info) but the manic episode was definitely induced by the Zoloft and Iâ€™d never experienced any mania before. It was real bad tho, I was stealing, sleeping around, I ran away from home and did hella other shit but I feel like the bipolar symptoms were very isolated"
bipolar,fcb2voq,t1_fcayk4m,1577581593.0,Do you think Iâ€™m addicted to it tho? Iâ€™ve been off of it for 4 years now and I donâ€™t have physical withdrawal symptoms

bipolar,fcax6wz,t3_egy6rd,1577578387.0,Is there another reason as to why the SSRIâ€™s brought on mania if I donâ€™t have BPD type 1
bipolar,fcawpb6,t1_fcavz4a,1577578109.0,Yea Iâ€™ve been refusing mood stabilizers and I feel normal. And itâ€™s 2 psychiatrists and 1 psychologist. I just want my adderal highkey. If I can live normally without meds then why bother. Iâ€™ve heard they make your lows more tollerable and the same w/ your highs but my highs feel normal idk
