You don't ""promote"" projections. You describe them mathematically and you put them out there to be used when appropriate. No one promoted UTM projections but are now NATO and oil industry standard because they are an incredibly elegant solution and for their high utility.

Arno peters was also a liar. He claimed this instantiation was the only equal area map and that it is distance factual. Both of those things are obviously false. Stretching must occur in high latitudes for all cylindrical maps, this is something that even without any training in map reading should be immediately obvious.

There are many other cylindrical equal area projecions for example Hobo dyers, Trystan Edwards, Lambert (the one with standard parallel at 0).

All of them are hideous and terribly distort shape. 

The even-numbered Eckert projections are equal area and far more elegant.

If you don't have to show the entire globe and for example only the USA or only Europe, then Albers conical and Lambert conical are incredibly elegant and of course area-preserving."

I'm not sure you make that distinction at all -your choice of words **""part of their core identity""** seems to suggest you think masculinity is something ingrained and perhaps genetic?

Once you make that distinction it becomes quite clear that it can, in fact, be lost, so their position is not absurd. And to make things worse, you don't think it can be lost, but their peers and coworkers might and that really matters. Once they see a man behave in a way that is unbecoming then their reality will change in very material ways. This is very true in some circles and can manifest in relatively harmless ways (don't invite him to beers he is a sulk and a gossip) or in very serious ways like losing out on a promotion (don't promote him, he has no gravitas and cannot command a room)."
