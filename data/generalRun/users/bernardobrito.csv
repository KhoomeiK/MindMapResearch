Sometimes a Courtyard is located in a busy area with tons of food options. For example, in Downtown Miami, i prefer the JW Marriott Marquis. But if I end up at the Courtyard around the corner, it's fine. Because I walk two blocks to the Whole Foods.

I would call the clients and propose JV's or partnership agreements or freelance/support work for the firms they did hire.  


They saw something in you, and must have respected your work to agree in the first place.   


Keep yourself as a flexible, attractive option for them.  


Secondly, target a lower-tier client  than you were initially seeking.  Many groups/firms/candidates can't afford a white-shoe or K Street firm. Be the lower-cost option.  


Metaphorically speaking, if you are not the MBB or Big 4, admit it to yourself and  be the Cornerstone, Infosys or Proudfoot.
