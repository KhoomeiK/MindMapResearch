AskReddit,ffd3tb0,t1_ffc8csb,1579812875.0,"Similar with copywriting. “Just wordsmith it for me!”

“EVERY ONE OF YOU CLIENTS HAS THIS AS A BRIEF AND I GENUINELY DON’T KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN”

“Like you did last time! I loved that one. But just for a bit of a change, some different wordsmithing this time!”

AskReddit,ffd3ck7,t1_ffc3rbi,1579812610.0,"I used to love writing, and I think it was because I’m good at it. Not for any real passion. Went into it for work, sidled into editing work, and haven’t looked back since. 

If I’m asked to write anything for work, I die quietly inside. Give me something to improve? I’m there."
blogsnark,ff9tcxk,t1_ff8pxoj,1579720831.0,"That line made me so repulsed, and I didn’t think it was possible to be more disgusted by that man. Ah yes, Thomas, you definitely miss your daughter because you love her! It’s nothing to do with money, status, and how you plan to profit off that AT ALL."
blogsnark,ff8f2ii,t1_ff4vc0m,1579675728.0,Doesn’t Instagram get iffy if you start mass unfollowing/making people unfollow you? I’m somewhat impressed by this dedication.

Even my Google recs are all rehashing the story and I’m like “please give me some new shenanigans and a fabulous Maxima hat”"
blogsnark,ff8cwrd,t1_ff3texi,1579673332.0,"There aren’t many things of Kate’s I see and immediately want (not because of how they look, but because I know I will look like the village’s saddest potato in them). This, however, had me immediately doing grabby hands in the direction of Needle and Thread because it is red and sparkly and did I mention red and sparkly and... 

Look it’s just all my dress happiness in one hit. And if I looked like the village potato, at least I’d be a sparkly one."

AskWomen,ff3x7zn,t3_eqxs0f,1579550830.0,"This is coming from someone who absolutely loathed her mother during teenage years — now, I’m trying to get promises out of her that she doesn’t plan on ever dying because I can’t imagine life without her.

Anyway. I think what helped with us was that the minute I left home, she let go. She’s still there for advice, but I don’t have her parenting me these days. We kind of moved from mother daughter to friends."

Dad: “um you’ve been having way too much sugar and that’s probably it”

Two weeks after cutting back on sugar: face is happy again. Cleanser not the culprit."

Or Harriet. Bless Harriet, you’re the Garamond when I don’t feel like sticking to my beloved."
