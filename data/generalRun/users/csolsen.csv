bulletjournal,ffh610r,t1_ffh5kzq,1579924086.0,That’s a really good idea! Thank you so much!
bulletjournal,ffh3hdn,t3_etiff4,1579922094.0,"Your bullet journal doesn’t (and shouldn’t, in my humble opinion) have to be consistent. Mine was ugly and simple and beautifully my own when I first started, and learning through time was how I developed my favorite spreads and became more artistic! My bullet journal looks like a different notebook from when I first began. Feel free to be as creative or not as you want, and don’t feel pressure from anyone to make it look a certain way. 

P.S. I hope this wasn’t too repetitive with what everyone else said lol"
bulletjournal,ff1n3xj,t3_er4jzw,1579481929.0,This is absolutely stunning!
bulletjournal,fez2rd0,t1_feyvwpz,1579453326.0,"The inspo from r/stardewvalley and this subreddit was super helpful! I went simple in mine because I was intimidated by the fonts, but I’d love to see another take on it!"

bulletjournal,feynkj6,t3_eqwh9z,1579448015.0,It feels like that sometimes when you lean back from your sub-par artsy spread and your colour-covered hand is shaking and your back pain is indescribable.
bulletjournal,fevwo2j,t1_fevscuc,1579402390.0,Mine too!
bulletjournal,fevm1iw,t1_fevktgd,1579398944.0,Thank you!
bulletjournal,feu6oo6,t3_eqjafk,1579383650.0,Try to avoid overlap and avoid lifting your marker off of the paper to make sure nothing dries before you’re done.
bulletjournal,feu6htd,t3_eqjkue,1579383582.0,"I don’t know if you are artistically inclined, but you could do sketches of your ideas to make your spread more visually appealing! You could also colour in the drawing once you finish it, if you want."
bulletjournal,feu61l6,t3_eqkl5h,1579383425.0,"Writing down tasks and leaving a space to check them off drives me to be productive because I find it super satisfying to check off tasks. You could use this and write down three things you need to accomplish today, what could make tomorrow you a little bit less stressed, etc."
bulletjournal,fepff80,t3_eqb7sr,1579319148.0,"If you want, a traditional month-by-month habit tracker might be helpful, and there’s tons of inspo all over Reddit. For a more general overview, a year at a glance to track moods or progress in an area might be a fun way to use your bujo!"
writers,fep2v43,t3_eq9quq,1579310902.0,"The first step to writing good work is caring, and it seems like you have that down! If you’ve done thorough research, I think that you should write what you would have liked to read as a person in your intended age group and clear it with other people to make sure that what your writing is constructive and helpful (which I’m sure it will be). Asking the people of Reddit for help with every stage of the writing process is amazing, and something that I’m looking forward to, too! I hope this wasn’t too vague, and happy writing!

P.S. Your premise sounds so cool!"
bulletjournal,felr2nk,t3_eptk4n,1579228865.0,"I don’t know if this counts, but I use Crayola SuperTips (sorry for not linking) as highlighters because some of them are light enough to have text visible under them, and the packs are generally cheap and versatile with tons of colours. I recently bought mildliners and they are really good, but but SuperTips do have good colour dupes for them."

bulletjournal,fcus564,t1_fcuko5j,1577987406.0,"I've used [Muji pens](https://www.amazon.com/Muji-Clear-Ballpoint-0-5mm-colors/dp/B00TTFPSXG?ref_=ast_bbp_dp) (0.5) for the past year and a half and they work really well for me! They come in a ton of different colors and are inexpensive, especially when you consider that refills are available! My only problem with them is that they can be a little bit scratchy on non-Muji paper, but they are vibrant and have lasted for a while. For a normal black pen I use the classic [Pilot G-2 07](https://www.amazon.com/Pilot-Retractable-Rollerball-Refillable-BL-G2-7/dp/B00MELNLL8/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?keywords=pilot+g-2+07&qid=1577987387&s=office-products&sr=1-1-spons&psc=1&spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUFPR1RMR1IyRDRGWkgmZW5jcnlwdGVkSWQ9QTEwMTUzODYyUkZJV1EzTElLUzhVJmVuY3J5cHRlZEFkSWQ9QTAxMzI4MTkzNEw5QVo3TElaVjRQJndpZGdldE5hbWU9c3BfYXRmJmFjdGlvbj1jbGlja1JlZGlyZWN0JmRvTm90TG9nQ2xpY2s9dHJ1ZQ==), which I have no complaints about! I've never experienced any bleeding with these pens, but I've also never used a Moleskin notebook."
bulletjournal,fcuqtms,t1_fcty0bz,1577986636.0,"If you want recommendations for markers, [Crayola SuperTips](https://www.amazon.com/Crayola-Washable-Markers-Favorite-Toddlers/dp/B07MSBF4HS?th=1) are easy to find (at least in the US), have tons of great color options, and haven't bled in any of the cheap notebooks I've used. They do leave somewhat noticeable lines when shading large areas, but they are very versatile (usable for basic calligraphy!) I would stay away from Copic markers, because those bleed a lot and can be super expensive (at least in my experience)."
