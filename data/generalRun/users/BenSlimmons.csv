We’ve watched AB *BURN LITERALLY EVERY BRIDGE* he had and go from the most talented 2-3 WR in the league to a guy that has backed himself into a really shitty corner of his *own making*. 

We don’t need some random fucking former linemen telling us that we need to be more empathetic to a guy that had an amazing life, millions upon millions of dollars, and the opportunity to make so many more. AB has no one else to blame but himself for literally every. single. thing. that’s gone wrong for him in the last few years.

And at no point has he seemed genuinely contrite or like he even recognizes his own flaws, privileges, or fuckups. Instead he makes it seem like coaches, teammates, and organizations that *loved* him look they’re unfairly targeting him for what reason exactly? Idk..."
