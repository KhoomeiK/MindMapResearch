todayilearned,ffsx4p1,t1_ffsjscn,1580196092.0,"Fun Fact: Kodak recently brought back two of their previously discontinued films, their only 3200 ISO B&W film, and their slide film Ektachrome. In fact, they had killed off slide film production entirely, but had such a backlash from the photography community, amateurs and professionals both, that they realized there still was enough demand and brought it back. Film's not dead yet!"
