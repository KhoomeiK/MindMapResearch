Do what you have to do even when inside your crying...... It's painful but no one judges you v-v"
depression,fewbb9t,t3_eqpqzk,1579407894.0,"It really depends on who you are and what is causing your depression whether things like exercise or getting a girlfriend will help, not to say that it is doing nothing for you but I believe you have to find the issue before you can solve it and that's the issue with depression it's an umbrella term that encompasses all the reasons we may feel emotionally deflated."
depression,fewakh5,t3_eqnbva,1579407594.0,I understand your point but some people gain an odd form of validation from that and whether they have depression or not is another topic entirely but as someone whose depressed more time than im not I understand getting annoyed at them but you have to try and understand how everyone perceives the world around them differently.
depression,fes3mdq,t1_fer9hnt,1579361030.0,I agree you can handle it better but sometimes someone's version of 'better' is the ability to hide it more thus making them less likely to be called out on it. Not to say that it can't encompass some good things too such as knowing what to do when having a panic attack etc. I don't mean to shut anyone down but to make them aware of the implications for others too so that if they meet someone who's going through something different they won't feel like they can't help
depression,feog17t,t1_feofeae,1579299606.0,No problem I just hope everyone here can find happiness in their day to day lives :)

depression,feoem8d,t3_eq6miu,1579299091.0,"Firstly; you should of gone to college in my opinion, why? not because it's necessary but you would have met them people that you wanted to co-exist with and had a chance to meet a female more organically. Allowing for a more fluid relationship than any created on tinder etc. which usually rely on looks somewhat also go to the gym, i understand it makes you self conscious but no one makes fun of a fat guy in the gym because that'd be retarded.

I understand the feeling of being burnt out, but there isn't any rest for the wicked as they say. I think this year you should get a job etc. until you can start college it doesn't even have to be a hard or full time job.

When college starts try being the person you aspire to be more than who you are.

Now I know what you're thinking ""ugh I'll lose weight next week"" or whatever the fuck but trust me sign up today, after a few weeks of doing something it becomes the norm and it stops being the pain in the ass you see it as today. I believe in you man, there is a point and the point is YOU the most important person in YOUR life isn't happy thus you must fight your weaknesses to be happy."
depression,feocyfz,t3_eq6o6w,1579298389.0,"Hanging yourself is a bad way to go firstly, it's incredibly painful. Aside from that don't hang yourself please go see a therapist, find out what's wrong with your current life and look for a solution just please don't kill yourself."
depression,feocc4y,t3_eq3l25,1579298168.0,I like to face it with a thoughtline such as this; If that didn't happen the me right now who regrets that wouldn't exist therefore i am in fact regretting the me who has come to become more empathetic through going through more and gained the ability to help more people with their regrets and depression ALSO as a side note i won't make that mistake again and can tell others not to such as my children or my friends who will spread it around lessening the chance of such an occurrence happening.
depression,feobxvn,t3_eq0vtt,1579297925.0,"I understand how you feel but I have some suggestions first do a fake laugh when the joke first comes up to fool everyone else socially. Second go see if you have ADHD or any for of Autism. Third if you have insomnia try and take pills for it, insomnia can make it hard to focus and make jokes become shty. Fourth there isn't a fourth i just enjoyed you reading my writing :D Goodluck"
depression,feoblb5,t3_eq3ydn,1579297741.0,"I turned 19 quite recently and when I became 18 i remember feeling the same, I spent most the day crying in bed because my family had forgotten me and called my grandad over, which obviously added to the depressive mood I was in but looking back it's just another year buddy.

I understand how it feels like a never ending cycle of shittery but because of that we can go on for years, but then why bother? well in the years since i decided to kill myself i have researched myself to find out why and how i can fix the issue, thus i propose you do the same. The quickest way to do this is with a therapist but if you're like me then you don't want anyone to know and you want to die quick and painlessly without any foreshadowing.

Anyway look for the best outcome and the issue and see if you can do it, if not then you can commit suicide, but please try your best and Good Luck."
depression,feoadmx,t3_eq1cjo,1579297275.0,"My life has also been like that to a large degree but don't commit suicide. Why? Because it can get better, not that it will BUT it can. I don't know how to explain this in a way you would be able to see it through my eyes but right now you are at a stage in life where you have no control and that means yeah, people will fuck you over but that doesn't mean that right now is everything.

I'm looking at you as I would look back at me and my only advice is Don't Give Up as soon as that spark is gone it doesn't come back and you might feel like you've already gave up but trust me you haven't. You're still searching and that's good really good, be proud of that because most people in your situation would just completely and utterly destroy themselves.

I only ask you live to see the day you do fall in love with someone who understands you and doesn't care if your a little ugly. That's not to say accept being ugly and forget to brush your teeth, get fat etc. I'm saying try your fucking hardest from the get go learn about everything you like, do weights, eat healthy, brush your teeth and have such a good lucking smile so when you amass a ton of money your grin will tell every single fucker you ever met.

""Fuck You""

So good luck, i believe in you buddy. don't give up."
depression,feo6bht,t1_feo64pp,1579295727.0,"On another note if you see a person as a possible romantic partner don't show weakness until you are genuinely comfortable with them, this will make it less likely that you will get in a relationship with someone who tries to guilt trip and use you BUT that's not to say don't test the waters, if they ask about your past just tell them that you don't want to go into it."
depression,feo64pp,t1_fencgjt,1579295624.0,"Leave that woman.

Now if you are being metaphorical then this doesn't apply to you BUT that's not to say it won't apply to anyone. 

If you keep falling in love with someone who can easily break your heart and doesn't care about you please leave them, they are most likely using you and I understand how emotionally taxing that can be but trust me if you find someone who actually care then you'll be much happier."
depression,feo59ml,t1_femm78u,1579295332.0,"I agree to an extent but that's not to say that we as humans can become depressed due to different reasons, so it may leave him to some extent due to it, it may not leave you.

I suggest working out what is making you depressed then coming to terms with it or countering it, the quickest and safest bet is a councillor though."
depression,feo4yve,t1_femvyx9,1579295171.0,"Moonverse I disagree with the usage of 'stronger' because from my experience each time it punches me I just fall deeper and become more apathetic, which I think is more common than becoming 'stronger' in a positive manner. If I was going to take a more psychological approach though i would say that each time it knocks you down it reaffirms whatever makes you feel depressed making it harder for anything or anyone to intervene with the cycle... so instead of keeping the depression there and waiting for it to go away I suggest people go see a therapist or counsellor."
depression,feo44fy,t1_femfvoj,1579294887.0,"I think he/she means that they have got a glimpse of happiness through loving another. Although I disagree with your point as well, personally I have an attachment to my depression and at times appreciate having it with thoughts like ""If I wasn't depressed I'd be naive like everyone else"" which is a thoughtline that came from people around me wanting to be Youtubers etc. and earning large sums which was and is highly unlikely, thus when i went through counselling I largely rejected the change as well as the possibility of change since I have been like this for a long time."
depression,feo31w8,t1_femdtve,1579294484.0,"Leave the relationship then. I suffer from anxiety and depression thus objectively I think you should leave the person but I know you'll probably not do this, how about you explain how you feel whether that ends the relationship or not should be a development based on this. 

On a side note depending on the cause of the anxiety try and work through it, if you don't know the reason find it and as soon as you acknowledge it you can begin to address it in whatever way will make you feel comfortable."
depression,feo2owt,t3_eps4y5,1579294275.0,"There's a pyramid in psychology that suggests that having loving relations is more important to us than our own ego, so even with depression finding love will make you feel happier ALTHOUGH this will not cure a lack of confidence in oneself it can support you whilst you find it.

So I think find love but make sure the love isn't just beneficial to one party as many relationships become when it includes someone with a lack of an ego. Hope this helps."
