But if I found a car like that for a few grand, I would have to take some sort of loan out for it, I don't think my dad has a few grand lying around. I could take a personal loan maybe? for say 3K, and get a cheap car, thats where my head is at right now."

I've looked around a bit on Craigslist for a cheap car thats 3K or under, and found a few, I just don't know if my dad would be willing to co-sign on a small loan like that too."

Fyi i didn't bring up the FF a320 since i dont have it. Originally i was going to get that cuz the UI and tablet looked more immersive than the toliss but i heard its more resource heavy than the toliss and i dont have the best system.

But overall i bet the FF a320 is just as good."
Xplane,fc1fdnj,t3_efmy6m,1577317111.0,"What kind of things are you looking for? 

If you want a new jet that's a simpler transition i would look into the 757/767. They are different than the 73, a lot of the ""flow"" will be easy to figure out. Button layouts, fmc, etc aren't exactly the same as the 73, but the overall ""layout"" is a simple transition while being a totally different jet. You could load up for the first time and say ""i can figure this out"" The 75 and 76 have almost identical cockpit layouts so once you've learned one you pretty much know the other.

After spending a lot of time and videos learning the 737, I was able to figure out the 75 and 76 on my own in a few flights.

Same thing with the ixeg 737-300. If your comfy with the zibo the ixeg will be alot the same. Just older technology. Its got a great immersion factor and is a good retro but not much new to learn.

If your looking for new systems, layouts and all of that, the Toliss a319 is a great addon. Everything is different and its a good mixup when you want a break from typical Boeing systems and the bss sounds and hd cockpit textures make it really solid.

The rotate md80/88 is also a very good addon. Kinda same with totally different systems and cockpit layout and its a good mix of older systems but functionality with the fmc make it a good balance between old and new.


If your looking for something more realistic to today's day and want an easy ""step up"" look into the 75/76. 

Same with the toliss just more things to learn.

Then vice versa if you want some nostalgia and easy step look into ixeg. And if you want steeper learning look into the rotate md. 

Only reason i say nostalgia is because not many carriers fly the 733 or md80s fly anymore and if your into realistic flights, then you wont find as many as the 319 or 75/76.

Thats just my personal opinion on them. Hopefully you get some more insight. Check out some youtube videos too. Some flights, some tutorials so you can see what kind of systems and flows they have.

Good luck and keep us updated on what you decide!"
