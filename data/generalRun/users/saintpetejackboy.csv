OurPresident,fg4u8ob,t3_ewwg0n,1580511219.0,"Even a quick glance at the amount of members of the Biden subreddit versus this one reveals a glaring discrepancy in the polling numbers being reported.  


You can say ""Well, old people do not use reddit and the internet, and those are the ones called for the polls, so there is the logic"", but that means that, in reality, when a vote actually came, even if 90% of us fell off the map, Sanders would be EVEN with Biden or slightly ahead. Polls are reporting this WITHOUT this fact accounted for.  I am clearly under the impression that this whole process is a sham.  


Watch Biden win the nomination and Trump defeat him in the election, to truly make the MAGA feel like they ""beat"" Obama in some way. It is absurd. I am throwing my full support, as of now, behind Bernie Sanders, because I believe he has a chance. Maybe he could pick Yang as a VP or something (balance out the old with the new), but, either way, we need to take our leader, Sanders, and make it clear that we are going to support him and get Trump out. Removing Trump from office is more important than your favorite Democratic candidate ""winning"". If Trump is elected again, we ALL lose."

There are only 2376 cans on an entire pallet. So this would be 5-ish pallets worth of cans... which definitely does not appear to be what is pictured in the image, so likely a joke + staged."

NeckbeardNests,ffz1lif,t1_ffz0yiy,1580361020.0," With approximately a half-ounce of **aluminum** per can, or 32 **cans** per **pound**, that makes each one worth about 1.7 cents. Although there are some people making a living collecting **cans** in the streets, it isn't a good living.    


However, you are correct - it is a good little sum, but imagine the work involved and the transportation, alone. It would be multiple trips and require a lot of labor and supplies, especially garbage sacks. It probably also smells awful and the hassle involved might STILL be worth it (\*small team, few vehicles, split it $500 between numerous people and knock it out real fast as a day job, or likely much less than that, after supplies, transportation, materials, etc.;) - also keep in mind you likely are only going to want to go do this (as quickly as possible) some time while scrap yards are open - so it makes it a 9-5 window of operation regardless, imagine not being able to transport enough (\*only a small vehicle and one individual and it taking numerous trips).

  
Here is another tidbit, however, it doesn't appear to maybe be that numerous of cans. It may be an exaggeration and not an actual figure. Not really trying to count jelly beans in the jar, but judging on that image, that is unlikely to be 12,000 cans - look where the floor is, versus where the window starts - it appears from the perspective to be ""up to the window"", but also is just laid about on the ground.  


I am also surprised at the surroundings being so clean (this isn't just some room somebody was using as a dumpster, seemingly) - so maybe it was staged - further hinted to by the EXACT number of cans being listed... 12,000 cans would be a total of  375 POUNDS of cans - empty cans at that."

Retconned,fe6c3hu,t3_envf6c,1578886649.0,"I am going to comment that, some of this is not really that crazy, but here is my opinion on the matter. Some data HAS  changed, because we have done much more advanced imaging with incredible equipment in recent years. Our understanding of the entire formation down there has steadily increased and our definitions of what certain words mean has also shifted a bit to remove ambiguity and explain not just the earth we see today, but previous versions of it that have undergone massive amounts of change.  


Breaking away from Godwana is still something that exists about the continent, at least.   


It is interesting that you pose two different views: is the continent about to spring back up revealing some land mass that may be a future paradise, the way the earth is warming? Or is the continent being removed from our collective understanding of reality for some reason?  


The second part is the rabbit hole I would like you to go down. The civilized history of that part of the world is shrouded in various rumors and all kinds of civilizations (they would have to have not been human, or had very advanced technology), even aliens, are hypothesized to exist under that ice that we may, in theory, discover. There are also reports of an ""anomaly"" beneath the ice there.  


Seven countries have laid claim to parts of Antactica. Military activity is forbidden by the world there, as is mining resources.  


But if you were doing that, who would know? Who would stop you? Do you think the super rich (and/or super intelligent) people have not already discovered every single facet about how much the stuff there is worth, and who to go about laying claim to it or profiteering from it? There are bases all over the area which are often dual-use and nobody can argue there is militarization going on there... so why not other stuff banned in the treaty? Including ""excavations"" that may really be mining operations and tons of other stuff.  


Want a piece of Mars? Rocks from there are easily located in antarctica due to some strange happenings. What if we have misidentified the rocks as being from Mars, but they were actually the other planet predicted by Bode's Law, the planet which had a collision with our own - or maybe even remnant pieces of it eventually hitting us again during the early stages of development. I mean perhaps the rocks are from Mars, which even then is still amazing - and worth a lot of money. For instance, some Mars meteorites that were found suggest it was very wet at one point - or perhaps as I am saying, we don't know the difference between a piece of Mars and a piece of Mercury (or any other planet), and just have to assume which planet it may belong to with very educated guesses.  


"" It wasn't until 1820 when human technology and navigation was sophisticated enough to allow anyone to sail far enough south to even see Antarctica for the first time. There are a number of poorly substantiated claims of setting foot upon the Antarctic mainland from 1820, though 1899 ""  


This is a land mass that is less than 200 years old to humans in general. Unless it can be proven humans once lived there in some capacity and our understanding of history and evolution get turned upside down.   


Large ships are no longer allowed to visit, cutting tourism immensely. There is hardly anybody on the continent at all, even during the summer, including all the bases - around 20k tourists a year and around 4k residents during summer and less during winter. Most people only stay during summer (which is several months).  


Only 11 humans, that we know of, have been born there. Temperatures have risen by as much as 2C in just the last 50 years. If global warming accelerates, the land could be valuable for inhabitants. A land owned by essentially... every single country. It is accepted that no civilization could have lived there, with our current understanding (as the area has been covered in ice longer than we could have lived there, as a civilized species).   


My theory here is that we are being conditioned not to think of the area while they cut tourism and ratchet up military and other operations there. One thing military has is money, an unlimited supply - enough to overcome the hardships of the continent, especially if there are lucrative side-projects (such as collecting space rocks, mining minerals illegally or whatever else).  


If the elite are not already taking advantage of this, they will - sooner more likely than later. That is why we don't even see it on a map and people do not know the strange history we have had with the continent or that any people even live there (even if only temporary), so how hard could it be to have us forget about? Remove it from all the images, paint it out to be a terrible place (remember Iceland / Greenland scam humans already pulled? Well, this might be more of a long-con version of the same scam).  


It will be interesting to see what happens when the treaty comes up again - especially as, by that time, we may see another 2C rise in some areas, or more, is climate change is exponential or runs out of control.  


If we can't establish livable colonies on antarctica, there is no reason to think that we can do it in space, on the moon or on Mars as a civilization. Perhaps it is our failure to conquer such a beast that drives us to collectively ignore it as a species.   


So: We have a giant land mass that technically belongs to all of us, where the only REAL barrier towards us being able to colonize it is that we'd have to solve our energy problems (which we can and have done, thanks to solar power and such), then we have to have a lot of resources that seem to spring about as if by magic from such a terrible climate - or are so dense in calories and nutrition that it is worth it to ship them there (currently, this may change, if the temperatures change). Humans would also have to make a conscious decision to inhabit such an area en masse for whatever reason. It would be a good trial area, a training grounds, for how we operate in space - in regards to resources AND politics and other facets of existence. I am sure the technology exists now to build massive domed paradises down there - the only real barrier is money, how much money those projects would cost, coupled with how long they would take."

Here is a good take:  


United States business men in suits used to be in China telling sweatshop workers what to do. Now many of them live closer to ""Second World"" conditions (or even better), while, these days, Chinese business men in suits are telling sweatshop workers in Africa what to do.

facepalm,fcrytzg,t1_fcrvnaw,1577908570.0,"I mean, there literally are those three exact states even for a boolean, because it can be 0, 1, or undefined, which is also a state. You can even introduce a fourth state in some languages, possibly, by not only checking if the variable exists/is defined as a type of state, but also by checking to see if it is set to a non-boolean value.

Not all languages are just going to let you use undefined or non-existent or improperly defined variables. 

For examples of a language which has the best lulz, in PHP, you can call a statement if the variable does not exist, and then define it if you like, or just use that as your third ""state"", and only process the Boolean logic if it has been defined. Since PHP doesn't have strict variable definitions, you could also introduce scenarios where the 0 / 1 (two states), with the third state (undefined), is accompanied by a fourth logic fork for when the variable IS defined, but has a value like 'a' or '3', allowing unlimited number of possible scenarios.

In my experience, I have rarely needed that many logical states for something that really only should be true or false."
