""However, when you move to studies looking at their effectiveness in the general population, the data is less compelling - it's quite a challenge to keep a mask on for prolonged periods of time,"" Prof Ball added.

So the masks absolutely work, people just often don't use them correctly.

BTW ""surgical masks"" are NOT the same as n95 masks (""respirators""). Surgical masks don't do anything to protect yourself against airborne anything."

""When it comes to preventing infection from their surroundings, health care workers wear N95 respirators, which fit much more tightly, says Schaffner. These respirators haven't been tested for effectiveness when worn by the general public, so there's no evidence to support a general recommendation, he says.""

""The CDC does recommend that healthcare providers wear N95 respirators, face masks that filter at least 95% of airborne particles, if they treat a patient infected with the novel coronavirus.""

And stop talking out of your ass."
