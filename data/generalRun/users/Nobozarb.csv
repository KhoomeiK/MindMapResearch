Svenska,fgutxq8,t3_f0hhk9,1581129367.0,Do they have this expression in English? I've certainly never heard it.
ABoringDystopia,fgtird5,t1_fgrj798,1581104956.0,"I mean that doesn't seem that bad to me necessarily. By itself the military reaching out to game developers to help them make games more realistic is a pretty cool idea, although I would not be at all surprised if they did have some ulterior motives in doing so."
ABoringDystopia,fgti2dv,t1_fgr5fxk,1581104771.0,The US is literally using mercenaries to fight their wars. I don't know what to make of that.

therewasanattempt,fgre62j,t1_fgqt2rm,1581044613.0,"I'm pretty sure everyone agrees there are two genders. It's just that there are then reasonable people who recognize the existence of a few more genders, and then there are bigots who feel attacked by people not conforming to conservative social norms and refuse to recognize the existence of anything that doesn't fit in their worldview.

Now, in the case of NASA, they aren't explicitly falling into either of these camps. First, notice how they use the terms *biologically* male/female; all they are concerned about is how the body is physically built, not what gender they are considered to be as a part of society. When looking at gender this way, apart from a very few exceptions, there are only two genders. Second, notice how they never say anything about there being *only* two genders. They say they have tested male bodies, and now they have tested female bodies. Their recognition of males and females does not imply that they do not recognize any other genders."
facepalm,fgrc005,t1_fgr959k,1581043114.0,They shouldn't want to have sex with you. Not necessarily because you are unattractive or anything; just because teachers having sex with students is messed up.
facepalm,fgrbv62,t1_fgqu4f0,1581043023.0,"Look, honestly, stop downplaying these cases of sexual assault (sometimes rape; I'm not sure in this case though) by saying that teenage boys want it. That is just messed up on top of being blatantly incorrect. I'm a teenage boy and I cannot imagine having sex with any of my teachers and would find any of my peers who said they wanted to disgusting."

onejob,fg7xbnm,t1_fg7hg1c,1580603862.0,"For the vast majority of history before the Industrial Revolution the rest of the world was leagues ahead of Europe. The Mongols had the largest land empire of all time. The Islam Empire stretched from Spain to India and Northern Africa, and invented the astrolabe, algebra, glass, and soap (among [many, many other things](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_inventions_in_the_medieval_Islamic_world?wprov=sfti1)). Mali created the wealthiest man to ever live. China invented the printing press, the compass, and a system of writing that has survived thousands of years into the modern day. Europe was the one just existing during all of this. They existed as a bunch of feudal states and struggled with plagues that they couldn't prevent against because unlike the rest of the Old World they had no access to soap.

Europe just got lucky with their natural resources that enabled them to go through the Industrial Revolution before anyone else, but even after that, their colonies over the rest of the world still played a major role in the world."

ChoosingBeggars,ffsc2jf,t1_ffqgskj,1580178149.0,I'm not sure if it would be phishing specifically if you're not impersonating the bank or anything but it would definitely be some type of illegal social engineering.
HistoryMemes,ffq7bu9,t1_ffq1i8d,1580124323.0,"They are being put into makeshift cages and such and being denied proper hygiene. Their conditions are worse than our jails, which is saying something. Now, I will also remind you that Trump's administration is [denying asylum to asylum seekers](https://www.wnct.com/local-news-2/trump-administration-setting-up-asylum-seekers-for-failure-lawsuit-alleges/), which means that they can't just get asylum to come in. And it's not like they are trying to get into the US for the fun of it. They are desperate enough to risk their lives to try cross the border into the US where they likely know they will be receiving extremely little pay if they avoid getting caught. This is not a case of putting immigrants in jail. This is a case of refusing to help desperate people and forcing them to try to enter illegally before then separating them from their children and holding them in cells for months to years. Honestly it would be better to just throw them out onto the streets.


EDIT: I'll concede that Trump didn't start this. He did augment the problem by denying asylum seekers, but he didn't start it."

What I find strange is when he tells her about how he slaughtered the Sand People like animals and making sure to clarify that he killed every last one of them and she somehow isn't turned off by *that*."
AskReddit,ffetush,t1_ffe4o05,1579865263.0,"If it's too heavy a burden to put on one person, don't try to put it on yourself. If there is anyone who cares about you at all they would much rather have you talk to them. I would want any of my friends who were suicidal to talk to me about it."

I don't really know what to say to help you, but if there is anyone who cares about you- or anyone you care about- just try talking with them about all your problems. Sometimes just doing that helps."
saltierthancrait,ffbqeae,t3_esh7fw,1579778481.0,"Vader literally murdered a room full of children and destroyed the Jedi Temple filled with his former friends and force choked his wife and tried to kill his best friend. If that doesn't make someone irredeemable, I don't think killing your own father does either. Sorry. I hate the sequels for their stories, and maybe the story would have been more interesting had Kylo not been redeemed, but I don't hate them for that choice."

saltierthancrait,ff2y84q,t1_ff1wlkm,1579528423.0,When was the last time you spoke to a woman? The reason people stay with abusers is almost always because the abuser manages to convince them that they don't deserve any better and/or no one else would accept them.
saltierthancrait,ff2y29r,t1_ff1s5zv,1579528277.0,I always found it weird because Jabba is a Hutt so why would he be attracted to a human woman? It would have made much more sense if Jabba were a human or if he was trying to sell her to a human.
linuxmasterrace,few05l2,t1_fer82jx,1579403592.0,I've never understood this joke about Vim being difficult to exit. I've always just used :wqa or :qa or :q depending on my situation and it works perfectly fine. Is there some part of it that exits a different way or something?
onejob,feoh5fb,t1_feo7hpx,1579300025.0,I don't even think this is being ignorant and stupid. I'm guessing they just needed to put this somewhere on the bus and realized there was empty space on the back so stuck it there.
saltierthancrait,feofij1,t1_fenqp8k,1579299485.0,Honestly that sounds like an EU type move considering the EU also has people blocking lightsabers with their bare hands.

CivVI,felqe3h,t1_felq1m4,1579228397.0,In your cities you can produce nuclear and thermonuclear devices and once you have those you can launch them from anywhere.
CivVI,felpto6,t1_fefylgy,1579228004.0,You can use military engineers to construct missile silos which can launch them or you can create nuclear submarines which can launch them. I think you can also do something with planes to launch them but honestly I've used air units like once in this game to shoot down a couple rebel units so I don't know how.
AskReddit,fekziyr,t1_fejc8yk,1579210855.0,That's what I did. I couldn't figure out where to put it so I just kind of put it somewhere inside the case where it fit and it works perfectly.

AskReddit,febq84u,t1_feawwh7,1578961519.0,"Can confirm. My school has metal detectors when you come in, your backpacks have to be searched, literally bringing scissors into school will get them confiscated, four security guards armed with tasers, doors with alarms that go off if the alarm is not first disabled, ID badges that are to be worn at all times, a system wherein you scan your ID badge at a computer when leaving to go to the bathroom or whatever which allows staff to see who is out of the rooms at what times, not being allowed to leave the room for the entirety of the school day, etc. Oddly the school doesn't have a strict dress code at all (beyond ""don't be naked, don't offend people"" type rules), which is interesting because of all their other rules."
