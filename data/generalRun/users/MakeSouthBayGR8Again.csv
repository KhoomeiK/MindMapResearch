LosAngeles,ffituih,t1_ffiprnt,1579982574.0,"Government don’t build houses.  They did set Prop 13 rates though.

My plan: give incentives(subsidies) to people who have owned their homes for 25+ years.  This will create greater market supply and lower prices.  Seniors can move to Arizona, Idaho, Wyoming where it’s more likely to their liking.  Younger families can raise their kids in areas of greater economic and educational opportunities."

LosAngeles,ffgvo53,t1_ffgm2d4,1579916234.0,"Ending prop 13 will level out the generational playing field.  Boomers will want to sell because now they’ll HAVE TO pay the fair value of their property.  Not the Prop 13 value 40 years ago. 

Supply will go up and cost will go down."
