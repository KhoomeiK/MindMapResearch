""Too bad you don't do all of the good I do. It's a shame you can't put that little extra in like some staff do"". That is total nonsense. This is a job, we are not volunteers, we are not saints, we need time for our own mental health and some people's batteries are smaller than others. In a normal work environment, The expectations are clear and if you do more great! you're a go getter! But in teaching people just assume we all want to do more 100% of the time and have the energy for that. I don't. I work with kids with special needs all day and passive aggressive co-teachers. I have just enough in my battery to help my kids then get home and cook. If the school wants more from me, they can pay me more and add it into my contract. We all do good. It's hard to be a teacher. We shouldn't be lambasting staff that leaves at their contracted end time. That's their right and none of my business."

 In my area of IL HS TAs start around $15. In 5 yrs that will be the state minimum wage. Unless something changes, Teacher's Aides will be making as much as the kids they teach who work at McDonalds which is why my Aide coworkers are already coming up with exit strategies. Why should you preforme an emotionally draining, white collar job when you can get paid just as much to fold clothes or work in a bank. You don't teach because youre a saint who is willing to forgo compensation for the love of the kids. This is a job. A hard job. When I worked retail it was hard, but it's nothing compared to working with teens and I work in Special Ed. so add in that variable. There is going to be a huge brain drain/competency drain in support staff in 5 years in IL If nothing changes. You want staff that's trained and specialized to work with kids, a job that most people don't want to do. Then you have to incentivize it. Everyone thinks they can work 7 hrs a day surround by kids.

Just as students may not leave. ""Hey it's public right?"", or come in any clothing they like, or the multitude of rules schools put in place to keep order and safety paramount. Public does not mean no one owns this space, the govt owns that space, almost all govt land and facilities require rules for you to enjoy them/their services. Schools absolutely do as well, which is why when you read your student handbook at the beginning of the year they will lay out their media and recording polices. Just as you have the right to not be recorded, so do the adults."

They weren't blanket statements. I don't think you know what that means or are using it incorrectly. These are not blanket statements.   

Genetics are ...real.    
Behaviors can be tied to genetics.   
Breeding leads to behavioral selections.   
   
Also we do put humans down that kill other humans. Just for the record. Since you seem hell bent on comparing humanity to animals (anthropomorphism).  We lock up felons and those who behaviors we deem uncivilized or unsafe. But we're more evolved than dogs, so if anything you're proving my point."

Genetics. If behavior couldnt be genetically groomed, we wouldn't have dog breeds with certain behaviors at all. All dogs would be blank slates for behavior, but that's not true. It's also one of the motivations to breed to begin with, to groom those behaviors to our liking. Just as addiction, IQ, and attention span disorders are all linked to genetic traits in humans and all affect behavior. It would be very illogical to think you couldn't breed behaviors when all evidence supports it. It's almost as if people tie their own emotions to their dogs sometimes in spit of scientific findings and statistics and then spread misinformation."

The Small: Had horrible cramps and menstrual pain in my teens and twenties (30's now). Assumed it was the norm and nobody talked about it so I sucked it up and did the same.       

Had horrible heavy periods.     

   

The last rupture lead to exploritory surgery (only current diagnose for Endo, which in my opinion is not good enough)   

Surgery photos looked like I had tons of black tar inside of me. Bingo, it's Endo.     



.    

How do I cope- I am on birth control with no end in sight and do not have a formal period (no sugar pills) but have minimal bleeding often. When I have cramp pain (which I still get) 90% of the time I just suck it up still out of habit. 10% I show it because it's too burdensome to pretend. I take strong anti-inflamatorys because in my experience traditional pain killers did not do much for the pain, but give me a shot of Toradol and baby...I am good to go dancing.       



I waited way too long to get diagnosed because I grew up in the 80s and 90s when the internet was young and assumed I was normal, what I felt was normal and so no big deal. In hindsight there were obvious symptoms and my mother should have known (she was a nurse who also had Endo, they think there is a genetic link now).  Now I never wait to see a Dr. unless I know they can no nothing."
