IllegalLifeProTips,fcvuxxm,t1_fcvudwo,1578010676.0,"Prop 47 is to alleviate incarceration load.  It affects sentencing, not enforcement.  If you steal $50 or $100K, you’re a thief.  Get caught, and your employer will consider you a thief, fuck if they care what Prop 47 classifies it as."

IllegalLifeProTips,fcv7obe,t3_eiw9js,1577996356.0,Lawyer here.  Prop 47 still classifies shoplifting as a misdemeanor.  Misdos aren’t “free passes”.  They’re crimes.  So no - you won’t be “good”.

unpopularopinion,fc7vwa9,t1_fc7v3j3,1577520016.0,"Security cameras are at a point now where we could identify people and license plates with enough accuracy to track them down (it’ll never be perfect).  With a federal crime being committed agencies like the FBI could step in to help local law enforcement.  Yes, I realize that’s a gross expansion of government but I feel this is a bipartisan issue where voters wouldn’t mind supporting expanded investigatory and enforcement powers."
