Now, weed is without doubt one of the better drugs to abuse, but, and I talk from experience, it is easy to let the smoking and acquisition of weed rule your life rather than dealing with your problems. I'm through that stage of my life, although I wish I had stopped when I was warning decent money so I had more in my savings.

What I'm trying to say is that this rigid narrative of weed been perfectly okay in all circumstances is disingenuous. If it is being abused by someone with any mental health issues it can be damaging, even if not physically. It isn't always the case, and I'd never argue it was, but denying anything negative is no productive to the discourse, and is little more than the other side of the ""war on drugs"" coin."

Channel 4 and the BBC have also released some of the best sitcoms/comedies over the last decade. The BBC used to have *Steward Lee's Comedy Vehicle*; arguably one of the best, and smartest stand-up based TV series to have aired on TV. Channel 4 has series like *Friday Night Dinner* - ITV may have had something, but the only thing I can think of is Benidorm, which I personally find a bit trite. Sky have only started catching up in the last 5 years, and I'd argue that a lot of that came from thier deal with HBO.
