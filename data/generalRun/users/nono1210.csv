Why are you so invested in him? Did he ever give you any sense of intimacy? Or how did you guys even get together? I don't want to ask in a judgmental way, I just feel like the answer to moving on is probably somewhere in the answers to these questions."

Also, what economic class do the white people in your area belong to? That may be a factor in the crime aspect of it. If they are poor, just know that statistically people tend to attack their own (goes for every race). I don't think that self-segregation is positive and mostly it's just a defense mechanism based on pure distrust, but it's  usually more complex than ""black people just hate white people."""

On the note of ""BPD is my fault"": you're responsible for your actions, but that doesn't mean your disorder is your fault. You didn't actively choose to have a disorder and most likely it is a result of childhood trauma as are most people's cases."

This may be either the BPD or the trauma talking, but please consider that the world isn't this black and white (black & white thinking is a symptom of both disorders). BPDs are people who are suffering and have difficulty regulating emotion. People with cPTSD are NOT, I repeat, NOOOOTTT people who should be pitied. Pity doesn't do anything and only victimizes people. Both people with BPD and cPTSD deserve help."

JustNoSO,ff96dgo,t3_es55rk,1579705909.0,"She's stuck in a victim mentality state. Only bad things happen to her and she just happens to be a victim of life. It happens a lot to all of us, but when we're requiring others to pity us it's because we're trying to manipulate them. When you get people to pity you, it's so that you don't have to do the work to ""get better,"" the responsibility is handed off to another person. 

In this scenario, your wife doesn't want to fix her own life, so she is putting the entirety of her emotions, depression, job loss, responsibilities, etc, on your shoulders. It has become your responsibility to fix it and if you don't... well then you're the bad guy. You're the bad guy for not making *her* happy. And she's creating an environment where the only thing that will grow is resentment between the both of you. On her end it's because she's requiring you fix her life for her and go through the rough parts of life for her while she just bums around. On your end it's that you are doing all the tough shit life puts you through and then you're picking up other people's responsibilities and life lessons too. 

It's alright to ask for help, but that's not what she's doing. It's not your job to make her happy or make her feel fulfilled, that's her responsibility because that's HER life. She is manipulating you and draining you of energy.  She may not be doing it consciously, but she's definitely manipulating you. 

My advice: Try to talk with her that you need to be a team. Right now you don't feel you are one unit working towards the same goals and you need to know what page she is on. Tell her you are willing to help her only if she puts in the work, i.e.: you will help her find a job after she updates her resume and researches some roles, so you'll help her prepare for interviews. It's a give and take. But most importantly, let her know that *you cannot help her unless she helps herself.* If she's still not budging, I'd suggest you consider whether the relationship is worth this much effort, emotional pain, and stress. Is this a hurdle or is this the new norm?"

therapy,fenmczk,t3_eq4hqc,1579287771.0,"To me it sounds like your therapist is simply a) letting you know about a policy (that most therapy offices have)  b) wondering if you are avoiding something in therapy/prioritizing someone else over yourself, and c) trying to help you NOT lose money by cancelling last minute.

Think of it this way-- therapy is the only time in the day that is *exclusively* about you. You don't do it as a hobby, you do it because you want to improve yourself and become a better person that values themselves. She may be thinking that you are not respecting your own boundaries--- as in, you can still see your sister but it shouldn't come at the expense of your therapy. It may be possible to do both and you don't have to choose-- be a good sister AND be good to yourself. 

&#x200B;

As for the dating thing, have you not dated in years or what is the background on that? I think your last sentence is extremely defensive. Someone wanting to help you is not the same as saying you are incapable. 

Either way, you don't have to do or agree with everything your therapist says. My therapist told me to go to HR about something at work and from the moment she said it, I knew I wasn't going to do it. Next session I told her I didn't do it because I have my reasons/I don't want HR involved. It was just my therapist's attempt to offer a solution on something she may not necessarily know that much about and it was fine."

If it was because you thought people would judge you, you are putting too much weight on your own feelings of shame. You need to release that shame (because you did nothing wrong, you were a kid) and stand up for those other girls so that they aren't wondering years later why so many adults stood by as this man took advantage of them as young kids.

Youniqueamua,feh80h1,t1_feh4nhw,1579111051.0,"Acne is unfortunately much more complex than that. It's not about loving yourself or not, it's a medical disease that usually people have little to no control over. After a while that will tear at your self worth and self esteem because your face is what you present yourself to the world with. Many times it's preferable to look bad with make up versus looking bad with acne. 

For someone who is fixated on their acne, make up is like a comfort blanket. Taking it off is more likely to cause anxiety and more self hatred than keeping it on. It doesn't matter how much everyone loves you, it's a personal experience and that person needs to come out of that comfort zone on their own."

AmItheAsshole,feepioy,t1_feeogar,1579038502.0,"The fact that you're blaming everyone else over all of this does not come off as actually being apologetic or understanding of why she's upset.

You can't blame people online for YOU posting your personal issues online specifically asking for judgement. I get that you can't wrap your head around why someone would pay that much money for a dress, but you don't need to wrap your head around it because this time it's not your decision.

But if you feel therapy isn't giving you any new realizations about the way you behave, view the world, engage with those around you, then either you a) have a bad therapist, b) are not clicking with your therapist and not approaching any goals.

JustNoSO,fcqz0qh,t1_fcqp42t,1577894336.0,"Hey, sounds like you had some emotionally manipulative parents (I have the same experiences) and that shit fucks you up a lot as a child. I think your husband’s behavior triggered you and all the anxiety you feel right now is due to emotional manipulation. It’s a way of making you feel like you are not enough and that you are responsible for making him happy. I struggle with the same issue (and then redirecting anger back towards me and asking questions about whether it’s me). 

I am not saying your husband is abusive or manipulative (not on purpose if anything), but that is a very unhealthy way of living with others. He’s placing his happiness on your shoulders and if you don’t make him happy then it’s on you rather than on him. 

Therapy has helped me plenty with these issues of feeling the need to make others’ happiness my responsibility (due to similar upbringing as you described). I’d advise to directly ask your husband (not in a loving way or anything, just serious) “X there is clearly something wrong. You can deny it, but we all experienced your shift in emotion and behavior. I don’t know what’s wrong and won’t be able to help you feel better if you don’t communicate what’s wrong. And I’m starting to notice this is a pattern that is unfair for me— you have expectations of what you want from the night and it’s up to me to fulfill them for you. That’s not my responsibility. I can help if you communicate with me what the issue is.” 

And keep track of how many times he does this— if it’s a pattern, it’s going to get exhausting for you and your kids and you’ll be repeating the same childhood and punishing your children with the same dynamic. One day holidays will no longer be about the children but about both parents having some weird passive aggressive thing and holidays will be a drag for everyone involved."
