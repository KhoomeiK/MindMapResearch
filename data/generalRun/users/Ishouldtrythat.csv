Divorce,ffr77c6,t3_eulxff,1580151948.0,"I left this comment on a similar thread, hopefully it can help you as well. 

I was recently blindsided by my wife asking for a divorce as well. Here are some things I've learned that I hope can help you too.

* It's ok to be angry about the situation you're in. It makes sense to feel depressed, lonely, and scared.
* When you have those feelings it's important to acknowledge the validity of them, but it's also important to acknowledge they aren't forever feelings.
* Own your personal growth and make it a priority. You have an opportunity to redefine your life in a way that makes sense for you. I've rediscovered a love of reading and cycling, two things that fell to the wayside when life got busy with kids, pets, homes, ect.
* A really hard one for me was acknowledging all the hurt that I'd experienced in our relationship. I was always my wife's biggest cheerleader so it was difficult to verbalize the ways in which I'd been negatively affected by some of her behavior. Recognizing the bad parts allowed me to view divorce as a positive change in my life instead of this horrible thing that was happening to me.
* Find some activities to enjoy and then go fucking enjoy them. You deserve to be happy, make sure you focus on finding that happiness in something so you aren't consumed when the depression kicks in, as it inevitably will.
* Date if you're up for it. It's amazing what a date with a cute woman will do to your mood.
* Exercise consistently. It's a great way to give yourself some contemplative time and it's truly good for your mental health. I've had countless breakthroughs while out on a run or riding my bike.
* Socialize socialize socialize. Reconnect with old friends, go to bar trivia with co-workers, spend time with your parents. Being around other people in a fun setting will help you not fixate on what you're losing.
I feel like this turned into a rambling mess but hopefully you can take something away from it. All the best as you figure this fucked up situation out. Feel free to shoot me a message if you need someone to talk with."

Divorce,ffaoij7,t1_ffanwch,1579740785.0,How old are you? I’m in my mid 30s and am loving experiencing dating again :)
Divorce,ffakf0x,t1_ffajx7w,1579737939.0,"Dating has reminded me that I'm a lovable, valuable person. I think ""don't date until it's finalized"" is great advice, but I didn't follow it and I've really enjoyed dating. I think if there's a chance at reconciliation you shouldn't date, but once you and your ex have decided it's over dating should be fair game."

This thought used to really fuck me up, because I was so focused on what I'd lost in this whole process. Now I get excited thinking about how I can change my life to better suit me. Not me and my family, but just me."
Divorce,ff9zuuj,t1_ff95dm0,1579725032.0,Such a good feeling. I'm glad you're experiencing happiness again.

Divorce,ff6t4l0,t1_ff6su0i,1579634338.0,Anybody? That’s a bold statement. Why are you trying to control what’s comfortable and right for people other than yourself?
Divorce,ff6pvwu,t3_erqcx6,1579632399.0,"Haven't fallen in love yet, but I've absolutely experienced that giddy, butterflies in the stomach, high school crush feeling. 

My advice is this. Focus really fucking hard on yourself, you'll have some self-realizations that will help you understand why your marriage failed and what you truly want in a new partner/partners. Then stick to those things, don't make compromises, find your person that fits what you want. You'll find love again, but first learn to love yourself so you can make sure whoever is next can love you as well."
Divorce,ff6oh2t,t3_erxf0r,1579631550.0,"Whats with all the posts like this shitting on ex-partners for moving on? Just live your life, stop fixating on your ex's actions. Who are we to say it's unhealthy for the ex to get engaged so soon? Who are we to say ""good luck to that marriage"" or similar things? I get the desire to shit on your ex, but give them space to be a person as well, stop trying to pin point which actions of theirs are considered good or ok and which ones are considered bad or unacceptable. Live your lives friends, don't let other people determine your path."
