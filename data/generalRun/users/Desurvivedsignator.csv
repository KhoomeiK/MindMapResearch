television,ff1brt2,t1_ff18egn,1579477245.0,"There are third options for an upper chamber of parliament like your Senate beyond every state gets the same ans every citizen gets the same leverage. 

Look for example at the German Bundesrat. It represents the interests I'd thread Bundesländer, similar to the American states. Depending on the population size, each Bundesland/state government gets between 3 and 6 votes in there. This way, Bavaria (California) has more weight than Mecklenburg-Western Pommerania, but cannot completely overrule it."

In short: When taking a leak with a really full bladder, the release can cause the blood pressure to drop and thus cause fainting.  Happens mostly to young men."
