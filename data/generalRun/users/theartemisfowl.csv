NoStupidQuestions,fffq7x6,t3_et6mos,1579889427.0,"You have problems with run-on sentences. You can't equate your typical conversations with friends to written language, especially since we speak informally in real life. The problem with today's education is that they don't seem to adequately teach proper grammar in an applicable use case. ""These are commas. Here is a trick to use them: think of a pause during speech and place one"". Such is not true at all.

You should understand how clauses work and how a sentence can be broken up by their function. Your run-on sentence includes so many independent sentences that could easily be punctuated with periods to make multiple clear sentences. Instead you have mashed them together and rationalized this formation by the use of incorrectly used commas.

Instead, consider each main idea that you want to convey. Try punctuating with periods first and see if these sentences can be combined through clever uses of appositives, subordinate clauses, prepositions, etc. Currently, you have mixed too many action verbs in a single sentence, with no clear noun to properly stay consistent in your message."
NoStupidQuestions,fffpz33,t1_ffetdle,1579889275.0,"These are subordinate clauses. Think of it this way: if you can ""remove *when my friends look at my writing"",* does the sentence still function by itself? If so, then this can be surrounded by commas and used as a subordinate clause."

no one can tell you what set pay to expect. your location matters, your experience matters, your job requirements matter. if you're not making what you need, consider looking elsewhere-- at the end of the day, it's your life and career to decide upon, not ours. you can wait a full year, or start applying now to compare what's out there.

glassdoor your salary expectations, but do a little more homework to make sure you are reasonable. seeking a different industry means you start over (experience-wise), but maybe it's worth the long term 

older engineers typically warn new engineers that the engineer life isn't quite the party that they think it is. but some do get lucky and really enjoy it. others find it mundane and monotonous. just try your best or consider a new path. surprisingly i've met a few individuals who have left engineering altogether-- it was just simply not what they wanted to live out for the rest of their lives"
