shrimptank,ffedo8n,t1_ffea84u,1579844193.0,"They are adhered to their pleopods, so can't voluntarily ""drop"" them.  (I've seen a misconception that they were held intentionally before, that's not the case.  The mother can't do anything to rid herself of them.  Only if the mucus that adheres them didn't exist or failed somehow.)  They are stuck to her.  If she dies, they remain stuck to her (demonstrating it doesn't involve her intent or stress).  There are plenty here far more experienced than me, but I've never seen any drop 'em, although I have had to scrape them off unfortunate deaths to happily hatch.  

So while it's never good to count your chickens before they hatch (heh), I'd put money on shrimplets in your future (and even if she dropped the eggs, they'd likely still hatch regardless)."
shrimptank,ffe9xx7,t3_esygdg,1579840788.0,"Why/how would she drop them?  I've never had a berried female's adhesion fail her.  Losing eggs is rather rare (you might hear about it more here as folks talk about unusual things commonly here obviously).  

But the eggs are adhered to her pleopods, not easily removed (for those of us who have had to physically remove them, we know how hard it is).  

But if for any reason she were to lose the eggs, they'd still hatch in proper time.

My shrimp fluctuated from low 60s to mid 70s as the room temp did, cooler at night obviously.  Just as they wood in natural pools in the wild.  

When ordering shrimp, they often come in cold if shipped during winter and heater packs run out.  In summer they often come in hot.  But either way they end up matching the tank per drip acclimating."

shrimptank,ffe8xd8,t3_et512r,1579839939.0,"Breath!  :-)  

It's OK.  Ellobiopsidae is actually a protist, not fungus, although their reproduction is via a spore, per Wikipedia, ""The half not attached to the host becomes the gonomere and the half attached to the host is named the trophomere. As the gonomere and trophomere partitioning continues to partition, the spore begins to form in the gonomere and it takes on a granulated texture. The pre-spores are released from the reproductive body and form spores for dispersal to the next host.""  

In other words, it would have had to have been at the exact right moment and happened to develop/release in those two minutes, instead of all the time it was handled prior to that.  

So odds are, no worries.  :-)  I presume you've already euthanized the doomed one?  Also should get credit from wherever you got it too."

The other idea would be to remove your shrimp entirely to clean dechlorinated water, do a 100% water change, then reintroduce them to the tank.  I'd still get activated charcoal for what is rinsed from surfaces in the tank.  

PS edit:  I'd not alter the pH in the tank with shrimp in there, would harm them--remember the scale is logarithmic, a change of ""one"" is 10x the alkalinity."

Here there are local papers or websites with classified ads from private parties.  I'd check any of them there for tanks being sold and contact them asking if they have dechlorinator to offer in this emergency.  

Failing the above, I'd look for local clubs of fishtank/aquarium hobbyests who might be able to offer some.

shrimptank,ffdrlpy,t3_esrxaw,1579827211.0,"First, make *sure* you are using the same measurement scale as the ranges.  More commonly it seems degrees of GH/KH are shown for healthy shrimp ranges, but ppm (parts per million) might be measured by test strips or the like (degrees by drop tests).  17.86 is the multiplier to convert between the two.  

I'd do it gradually, but realize it does take days for them to adapt, and likely weeks fully.  I'd mix what I want as the optimal values that are easy to create from your water and distilled, then do a third water change (50% is a LOT, shrimp like consistency).  Obviously this would only reduce the overall mineral content a fraction (again, shrimp like consistency) but move it in the right direction.  Next water change it would change even less, and less, but keep getting healthier without shocking them too much hopefully."
shrimptank,ffdqp7d,t3_esuhi0,1579826632.0,"If you can't get Prime, you're looking for a product that detoxifies ammonia and nitrites.  In pet shops, typically dechlorinator includes that ability.  

Currently your tank is toxic.  If a store is open tonight which carries such, you'd want to get it and dose it daily until you can get filtration running.

My neighbor had his driveway repaved, only to have water *pour* through a wall and flood his finished basement afterward.  The different company that repaved it to fix it said it was the incorrect mix.  

It's entirely possible the grading of the driveway, the mix, or the junction with the foundation at the house might all be remedied.  I might be inclined to clean that junction with Muriatic acid (hydrochloric acid) and then caulk the seam (presuming it's small enough and no weeds growing out)."

So actually...  

The nocturnal ones curl up against a high tree branch during the day, with the algae on their fur, they look no different than the bark, without moving, incredibly hard to see, especially backlit against a bright sky.  

Since they don't have to come down to defecate but once a week, and dead ones still hang (unlike us who use muscles to grip, they're claws are naturally hooked, they use muscles to release) so even if you do see what you think is one and have a way to kill it, its meat would likely be unreachable.

Showerthoughts,ff9m3nk,t1_ff990sq,1579715864.0,"Huh?  Silicon Graphics and Amigas had modern GUIs, mouse and window operating systems that were actually multitasking (and had multiple processors) at the time, plus were less expensive than comparable IBM and clones.  

Plus the Amiga had base 4096 colors instead of two.  And later 8, then later VGA graphics gave windows boxes 256.  

Also the Amiga functioned in NTSC (America) or PAL (Europe) television broadcast signals.  

The hard part for 3D was rendering a single frame back in the 80s would take overnight.  Thankfully when I was creating 3D animations in the 90s we could render several seconds overnight.  

By this time Windows as an operating system had come along, and Macs had moved from two colors to also support more.  

The primary low cost software for 3D was Lightwave on the Amiga, which was ported to Windows in the 90s as Commodore (the company that made Amigas) went under.  

So to answer your question, you'd turn on the machine, you'd have all the icons of your software on the Workbench (what Windows calls the ""Desktop""), you'd run Lightwave and Art Department Pro (conversion/compositing software, think Photoshop), and drawing software like Deluxepaint all at once, and changes you'd make to textures in one could reflect immediately in the others (or you could have Lightwave rendering while working on the next piece).  

It was a big step backwards moving to Windows and more of a task switching environment instead of true multitasking.  Windows still lacks some great features the Amiga OS had.  And now it has jumped the shark and become an advertising platform instead of an operating system.  

That said, at the time the Intel processors were moving ahead of the Motorola processors in mathematical speed.  RISC architecture was coming along.  3D graphics cards with real time rendering were appearing.  The whole scene changed.  

But the work process of using an orthographical view to model things, lighting, making key frames/motion capture, compositing, rendering, all are similar processes today (and you see such jobs listed with teams of artists in credits)."
