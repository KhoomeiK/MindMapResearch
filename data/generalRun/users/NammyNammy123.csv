You can see the top deck lists  [here](https://www.mtgtop8.com/archetype?a=867&meta=193&f=PI). I'd personally play a deck like [this](https://www.mtgtop8.com/event?e=24219&d=369010&f=PI). Leyline of anticipation is a great way to get free devotion and be able to play the entire deck at instant speed."
canada,feftpzd,t3_eosehm,1579064911.0,I legit went to a Timmies the other day and they were out of donuts and timbits... Like isn't that the point of Tim Hortons?!
PioneerMTG,fealz92,t3_eo9qza,1578950218.0,"A good place to start is to look at what the meta for pioneer looks like atm. mtggoldfish.com and mtgtop8.com will give you an idea on what people are playing with competitive decks to boot. For example, Lotus storm is trending atm and looks relatively complex: https://www.mtggoldfish.com/archetype/pioneer-ral-lotus-storm-139194#paper"
ModernMagic,fe3kenc,t3_enm40h,1578850100.0,"If you're going to play a more ""fair"" deck I'd run some more discard spells. You should run 4 Inquisition and at least 2-4 [[Thoughtseize]]"
PioneerMTG,fdqc1zz,t1_fdq62kd,1578662578.0,Thanks for the feedback. Swiftspear is definitely a card that was thrown in only because it's a good 1 drop. I'll do some testing with Soul-Scar Mage for sure. I've done some testing with Gideon Blackblade + Heart of Kiran and I've found that I had to increase the land count to consistently cast Gideon on turn 3. Not necessarily a bad thing but I really wanted to keep the curve low to be as aggressive as possible.
PioneerMTG,fdqbb5n,t1_fdpy9qk,1578661920.0,"[[Boros Charm]] in the main is my board wipe protection at the moment, gives all my permanents indestructible."
PioneerMTG,fdpsctx,t1_fdppr2d,1578638609.0,"Nope, it should be wild slash lol."
ModernMagic,fdll6b3,t3_em0nvz,1578526507.0,[[Lotus Bloom]] would help you combo on turn 4 more consistently. Both your combo pieces cost 3 so lotus bloom seems like a great fit. Other then that [[Serum Visions]] will help you get to your combo faster. I'd play at least 2-4 serum visions as it's the best draw spell in modern other than Ancient Stirrings.
wholesomememes,fdl2p06,t1_fdkcbjj,1578516040.0,"Beyond Creation is a tech death metal band that I'm a big fan of. Black Crown Initiate (specifically their album Song of the Cripple Bull) is also very good. A few more to list off (not specifically related to Ne Obliviscaris): The Faceless, Born of Osiris, Jinjer, Rivers of Nihil, Shadow of Intent, and Slice the Cake's Odyssey of the West is one of my top 5 favourite albums of all time."
wholesomememes,fdk42y5,t1_fdjvpu0,1578495561.0,Lucky! There's sooo many good Prog metal bands from Australia! Twelve foot ninja is great.
wholesomememes,fdjvlmd,t1_fdjncht,1578488957.0,Be'lakor is my jam. If you're looking for something similar Ne Obliviscaris is also very good.
PioneerMTG,fd7lmiw,t3_ek7dnu,1578206380.0,If you're looking for some spice take a look at [[Reckless Fireweaver]].
PioneerMTG,fcif985,t1_fci9dv5,1577661651.0,"Ooh, Tetsuko is really nice, I'll include that in the list for sure."
magicTCG,fcaqxcp,t3_egt13c,1577574836.0,"I'd recommend checking out a different LGS especially if you're in a big city with lots of options. I regularly play at a ""competitive"" LGS and the people that play there are 98% of the time good people with decent social skills. Paper magic is my favourite form of playing magic. Online magic is fun, but I find that it's more rewarding to chat with people about how the game went/what I can improve on in future matches."
PioneerMTG,fc77y08,t1_fc66jkx,1577499926.0,"I like it, it acts like copies 5-8 of risen reef. I have lots of play testing ahead so I'll see if I can fit it in somehow. Maybe a 4 of in the sideboard against a heavy removal / mid-range matchup"
PioneerMTG,fc5iw1k,t1_fc5hsj0,1577458829.0,Retreat definitely looks like a good fit for the deck. Getting it out on turn 2/3 results in a lot of scrying.
PioneerMTG,fc5ctce,t1_fc5c8ji,1577453593.0,"Wow, I never would have thought of that, thanks! I'll try to make room in the list."
PioneerMTG,fbxqdub,t3_eexm2b,1577197566.0,After some goldfishing I'm finding -4 Island +4 [[Arboreal Grazer]] helps a lot with consistency and allows you to combo faster with turn 1 Arboreal Grazer
