facepalm,fejp1ff,t1_fejejkc,1579182113.0,"Actually imperial makes sense if you understand why it was made.  Imperial uses a base 12 system.  The reason is because 12 is divisible by 2 3 4 and 6 while 10 is divisible by only 2 and 5.  Doubling the number of divisors makes it easier to give smaller amounts of that item.  This was designed before accurate scales and tools, it had to be easy for the common person to take one standard container and divide it easily.  

[Here is a video by Numberphile that helps explain it a bit, it's more about base 12 itself.](https://youtu.be/U6xJfP7-HCc)

Edit: I should add that it also uses base 16.  16 is divisible by 2 4 and 8.  Giving an additional divisor.  My argument is not that it is intuitive, it is that there was a reason why it was designed the way it was and that it made sense for the time.  I work in both imperial and metric for my job and work my calculations almost exclusively I'm metric and then convert because the conversations are much simpler in metric."

But let's take for example the water cooled PC video, that Linus and Alex did, that was released today.  That video was 30 minutes long.  That gives them 120 hours of work to produce that video.  It took them 3 days to build the PC (based on the video), assuming they spent 8 hours per day for 3 days with 2 on screen talents and 1 camera man, that totals 72 hours of work to film the entire video.  That leaves 48 hours to edit and to research the project.  Does editing really take that long for a video like that?"

A place like 7 11 or McDonald's should be able to cut that number by 30 to 50 percent based on volume and bulk shipping.  So one 5 gallon box of syrup replaces 120+ 2L soda bottles, which in turn cuts the shipping weight by a factor of 6."

>I wish I had sources but I'm on mobile. But I have looked into this before. 

>They were originally invented in China sometime around the 9h century. Over the years they spread across Asia, into the Middle East, and then into Europe. They underwent many design changes, and functions. But essentially remained your typical playing card. 

>A theory for the widespread use of the cards has to do with military. They were easy for soldiers to carry around and provided hours and hours of entertainment. They would essentially travel the world with these soldiers and get traded and introduced into cultures these soldiers encountered. Their universal appeal is the cause for the widespread adaptation of them.
