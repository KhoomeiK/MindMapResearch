AskReddit,ffip349,t3_etovcn,1579979196.0,"hmm lets see. WW3 scare, trump, break up, STD, plague, parents divorce, discovering multiple of my siblings are suicidal. hmmmm.

i suppose i wouldn’t be surprised if i got cancer, liver failure, lose my job, or a loved one dies.

it’s been a great year so far boys. totally looking forward to the future."
SuicideWatch,ffioqfo,t3_etqi0p,1579978953.0,"honestly, don’t. the painful methods of suicide often fail and leave you with permanent damage. like overdosing on medication, usually just leads to organ failure which will leave you alive and miserable. that is a terrible way to live and a terrible way to die.

it isn’t worth experimenting. i’m not afraid of dying, but im afraid of the permanent damage of a botched suicide."
SuicideWatch,ffioi2i,t3_etrvgs,1579978794.0,"i know how you feel. i never had any highschool or even early college girlfriends even though they all said i was nice and attractive.

also tinder is terrible.

eventually, i found a girl that said yes. i learned my biggest issue was my social skills. when i was about 19-20 i would choke if i tried to talk to a stranger, and was so quiet nobody ever noticed me at parties.

eventually i got over it, it took a lot of pushing despite my lack of courage. i also eventually found out i was OCD, got meds for that and that helped a lot with my social issues.

I’m still with that girl. though we have had major ups and downs and broke up a couple times. but i now at least have the confidence to talk to other girls if we ever break up for good.

I’m 25 now btw. keep pushing and dont give up, maybe get your friends who get girls in clubs to coach you or something."
SuicideWatch,ffi8jbm,t3_etk2kd,1579967850.0,"Unfortunately this isn’t the best sub to seek help. Most people here are at rock bottom and are unable to help each other. and some are down right rude.

I think a lot of people don’t know what to say, so they don’t comment. they don’t want to make things worse for you and are not sure what advice to give since they themselves are also lost.

but you aren’t alone. many of my posts also got zero attention. it feels shitty. suffering like we do and them making a post with zero attention just feels shitty."
CrappyDesign,ffi6944,t3_etonux,1579966197.0,all i see is a toilet
politics,ffgpn4c,t3_etevnr,1579911869.0,i too am a fan of rock climbing.
SuicideWatch,fffrici,t3_et9s17,1579890222.0,hello. are these ups and downs related to events? or are your emotions just all over the place?
SuicideWatch,ffffh2g,t1_fffe4b8,1579882817.0,"excellent. i wish you the best.

also just a note about medication, sometimes it takes trial and error before you find one that truly works for you. so if you get medication and it doesn’t help, let your psychiatrist know and he/she will have other options to try."
SuicideWatch,fffcfg2,t1_fff0mzu,1579880892.0,"don’t be afraid to see a psychiatrist. you aren’t seeking attention you are just seeing a doctor about an illness. it is the same as if you went to a doctor for flu symptoms.

it can feel awkward at first, talking to a stranger about your feelings. but they will not judge you, they will welcome you.

i spent many years too proud to see a professional and it was one of the biggest mistakes i ever made. there is no shame in seeking professional help."
SuicideWatch,ffeigwu,t3_et60ln,1579849337.0,"i can relate. especially people who have never experienced depression, they have no idea how their actions impact someone who does suffer. they dont understand what it means to suffer.

and you are right. by nature human beings are selfish. there are some people who are exceptions, but they are usually not the majority.

but even if your peers are unable to relate to you and your feelings, that does not mean you are broken or abnormal or flawed. you yourself are a human being, and your feelings are real, true, rational. regardless of what any random unexperienced person thinks of you. you are real, and your feelings are real.

if you want to discuss things further i am always available to talk in threads or i dms. maybe we can share experiences and discuss life. i wish you the best."
SuicideWatch,ffei7m2,t3_et638g,1579849035.0,"i wish the best for you and your sibling. and im sorry that your families religion and culture does not accept depression as a normal/natural occurrence in peoples lives.

if it is at all comforting, there are societies and regions of people that would be accepting of your feelings. you are not alone.

most everyone on this sub is suffering to some extent. the best we can do is try to help each other.

im always available if you want to dm me and discuss more. again i wish you both the best. you are not possessed by a demon, you are just human. and that is ok."
SuicideWatch,ffei0dm,t3_et63j2,1579848797.0,"whatever your fetish or kink is, there is a logical explanation for it, and it is not your fault.

most sexual appetites are accepted in culture these days. everyone is a pervert.

if you want to talk more, you can always dm me. and as someone who was suffered depression from religion due to natural sexual thoughts, maybe i can relate."
