But then my grandma (mom’s mom) stated “Thank God it wasn’t Mary.” Mary is my moms 2nd oldest sister, who was the favored child of all my grandmas other children. 

Also, when grandpa finally did die a year later, and we were all upset at his funeral, grandma made a point to come and tell me and all my cousins that it was Okay, we didn’t need to be sad, she never loved him anyway. 

Grandma would brag to people about how she was leaving all her grandchildren all this money when she died and she hoped they knew that they better not fall out of her “good graces” or she’d “write them out of the will” or whatever. I was so sick of this cold-hearted woman but whatever, I did nothing to distance myself nor make myself look like a kiss-ass.

A few years ago a local family was out walking a recreational trail when they came across someone having a mental break, who opened fire on them. This person killed the husband and 11 year old daughter, and another bystander, and also put the mom in the hospital for a month with gunshot wounds.  Two other children in the family witnessed it but survived. 

A different family, they put their three boys to bed for the night and in the middle of the night, the husband heard his wife take a strange gasping breath, and then couldn’t wake her. She passed. 

The wife from the first family ended up meeting the husband from the second family, and they eventually married to merge their families together. 

Apparently it’s been said it’s gods plan to brutally murder an 11 year old girl and her father, and also take away the mother of 3 young boys, so these two could hook up. Both families are very religious, so I guess they agree and are cool with it?"
