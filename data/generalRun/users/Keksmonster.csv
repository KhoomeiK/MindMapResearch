What I mean is that most people would agree that Simmons has the potential to be an all time great and adding more range to his arsenal would help push him to the next level.

He is a very good player already who does what he does very well that has a big hole in his skill set that he is seemingly unwilling to improve on.

Of course we don't see much of the behind the scenes and I'm sure he does work on his shooting in practice but even with his teams backing he still doesn't shoot 3s in the game.

Nobody expects him to be a 40% shooter right away but he has to start somewhere and even if he shoots 25% from 3 it would give his trainers something to analyze and improve on.

That's not what I said at all. I said that Astralsi doesn't set Device up as much as Vitality sets up Zywoo because Astralis has so much frag power and the best IGL in the game.
