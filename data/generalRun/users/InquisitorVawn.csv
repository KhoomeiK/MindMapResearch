I did see a way of cooking ground meat on Bon Appetit the other day actually - form it into meatballs first, brown the outside and just let them cook through before breaking them down again. You get brown on some meat but the rest doesn't overcook. I'm thinking I'll try that next time."

Do not, I repeat *do not* send hundreds and thousands or even dozens or tens of pages of information to them. They will disregard them at best, and at worst it may hurt your visa chances.

In terms of evidence proving you've been regularly in contact (if you're not living together) the maximum number of pages they recommend sending is 15. You don't need to send all of your communication over the entirety of your relationship, just snapshots from regular intervals that show you do regularly communicate and that you support each other. 

In terms of how to get the information to them, depending on where you're applying from I believe you can choose to upload online or print them out and mail them, but the problem is that the online uploader doesn't work the best, so most people recommend printing them out and posting them in because then you know they're going and aren't just lost on the internet."

Coles and Woolies in Elizabeth both have markedly lower quality fruit and veg than Coles and Woolies in places like St Peters or other Eastern suburbs, as well as a smaller range of fruit and veg. There are a couple of farmer's markets around but one is at Parafield Airport and hard to get to on public transport, and the other is at the Old Spot that only has a couple of buses that run past it from the 'beff.

I used to live in Elizabeth North. I was ""lucky"" enough to work in the city and have easy access to the central markets (and a job that could afford me to shop there), and access to a car to get to other places where I could get decent fruit and veg, but I knew a lot of people who couldn't."

immigration,fdym5to,t3_ekdqcb,1578781274.0,"To start with - head to /r/ukvisa as you've already been advised.

As someone who's currently going through the fiance visa> spouse visa> indefinite leave to remain route, if you intend to get married anyway, you will most likely find it may be cheaper to get married in the states, then bring her back over here directly on a spouse visa.

To go via the fiance visa route, first you have to pay for and get the fiance visa before she comes to the UK. Then you've got six months for her to get to the UK, get married and get onto the next step which is the spouse visa. She will have to apply for the spouse visa twice - once to come off her fiance visa, once at the 2.5 year point after that, then she will need to apply for indefinite leave to remain. Each application costs a couple of thousand pounds (at the moment, nobody knows what will happen to the costs after Brexit right now).

To get married on the fiance visa in the UK she has to have been living here for at least 7 days before notice of intention to get married can be lodged with your local council. Notice of intention to get married must be lodged at least a month before the intended wedding date, but if your details are referred to the home office for review, it could take them up to 70 days to get back to you with approval to get married. Which can make planning a wedding a little bit tricky when juggling timeframes.

Comparing to that, most of the US/UK couples we've seen in the ukvisa sub have pointed out it's much easier to get married in many states of the US, and there's no requirement to apply for a fiance visa to do so. So you can go over for a short visit, get married and then she can apply to join you directly on a spouse visa. This avoids the need to apply for and pay for a fiance visa entirely. The other benefit of this is that with a spouse visa, she could apply and start looking for work immediately. She cannot work on a fiance visa at all. Not even self-employed/online/distance work. Whereas if she's on a spouse visa, there's no such restriction.

In terms of your finances, I'm not too sure about how it goes with someone who's on student loans and grants, as my fiance/husband earns more than the required amount to support my visa application. However they are very strict on that front, so if you don't meet the income requirements, and you don't have savings of around £65,000 then it may not be feasible for you. Once again, check on the ukvisa sub."
