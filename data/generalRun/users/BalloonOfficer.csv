unpopularopinion,ffccqx8,t1_ffcai0y,1579796639.0,"Sadly this is not how it works anymore, there's so many people that it's not even an issue. Look how many countries are killing their own, and how much corruption there is in poor countries where population is starving. They still have people left over and over those they govern. I hope one day we reach your vision where the government see they are people just like us and we are one community looking to strive together. Or in the worse case at least grasp that if the people have a better life theirs will too be better, even if it's disproportionate, more than if they harm their people."
