Answering my own question: The Fire Phone was discontinued in 2015.

Edit: The answer."
space,ffion5a,t1_ffht72e,1579978891.0,Other life forms don't need to infect a host to do harm. See Australia and the imported species.
google,ffhotr7,t3_etgqkb,1579945935.0,My first smartphone was an HTC Desire. I think 2.2.2 was the highest update it received.

Reading the title I was wondering what kind of pudding/paste this could be. But it's just cola."

The chances of something living coming from Mars may be million to one.

But the probability that people will panic gives reasons for concern. Some media spin, some TV show, or movie is enough and it gets either annoying or worse."

space,ffgil00,t1_ffg9lt5,1579907057.0,"Media spin, religion, etc. is something that got discussed a lot and I'm expecting nothing new. It's either worse than fiction or very boring.

The practical consequences I see and are maybe a bit too extreme/shocking: Nobody and nothing is ever allowed to return. Total quarantine of Mars for all people who go there.

No equipment allowed near our atmosphere. No equipment allowed to be near anything that would come near our atmosphere.

This would change SpaceX's plans dramatically."

One would need find every organism and understand all of them completely. And even then there would still be some risk.

Australia is a bit fucked up but still survived all human mistakes and imported animals/plants. But this is just luck. Not really predictable.

Edit: I would expect users in this subreddit to explain the downvotes or to arguing instead of downvoting."

Doesn't have to be. Radiation, low oxygen level, temperature, this could all limit the life form on Mars. Rapid reproduction could be a means to its survival and now the limiting factors are gone on Earth."
