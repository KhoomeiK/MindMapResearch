NWSL,ff9ehjd,t3_es7z6e,1579711272.0,"Canada has problems developing talent, that's all there is to it.  I have ranted before about the development pathway, how narrow it is and how shallow.  If you are an 11 year old who hit puberty at 8 then Canada will find you, but if you're a normal kid you're done by 13 because there is no place for you to keep playing at a high level against kids physically similar to you.  It gets worse as you get a bit older.  Again, if you're Jordyn Huitema or one of the other early bloomers you get in to the Whitecaps Rex or...  where else do you get elite training between 11 and 16 years if you aren't rich enough to pay?

So by age 13 we have already weeded out a massive number of talented or potentially talented players just because we don't have an infrustructure, a pyramid to support that critical mass of players.  Then when a player hits 18, well, if they aren't already in the National Program they aren't getting a scholarship in the US nor an offer in Europe.  Canada finds a few gems in the US like Janine Beckie, a Canadian born player developed in the US but not good enough for the American side.  Beyond that, where is Canada finding players that develop later?   The US has the NCAA and Europe has academies and a pyramid of play that rewards late blooming players.

We can moan about Heiner-Moller, player selection, or whether this player is better than that player, but the fact is Canada has such a shallow pool that it doesn't matter.  An incremental increase in talent at one position isn't going to win. 

As for Sinclair, well, where would Canada be if we didn't have her?  And where are we now that she is declining?  Sinclair as a striker is over.  Huitema is just learning the craft, and Beckie is showing she is much better suited as wing back at Manchester City.  The cupboard is bare.

So yes, be nervous because I think there are some dark days ahead for Canada.  The Europeans are making massive strides, the US is still 10 times bigger and has much more cash to splash around, and Canada still can't field a decent development program."

Yeah, it is.  Marissa Shen is alive today if people like you didn't demand we help people who didn't need our help.  We can help refugees without importing them to Canada.  We can financially support them in Turkey, where most of them were already living.  We don't need to risk the lives of Canadians so you can feel better about yourself.  Many may be as innocent as Canadians but they aren't Canadians.  Canadians shouldn't have to die so you can boost your self-esteem."

If you want to have a view of the issue that's closer to the truth, you need to look at the actual data. 

A single instance that showed clearly that these ""refugees"" were not fleeing any war or persecution.  The majority of those ""refugees"" were fleeing Turkey, where they had jobs and lived in apartments, not camps.  The majority of ""refugees"" Canada took in also lived in safe locations, not camps, and had jobs and built lives.  The only reason to move on was that Canada, or Germany if you like, had better welfare.  Those are facts.  The ""anecdote"" of the Kurdi family bears them out.  

Research in to the migrants flooding Europe through North Africa shows clearly these are not teen girls fleeing war.  They are young men looking for better economic opportunities.  Teen girls tug heart strings much more effectively than 28 year old rapists who murder little girls, and that's why Ibrahim Ali won't be in any vignettes about the plight of refugees.

> I think the good that comes out of helping these people far outweighs the harm that a small minority of people commit.

Because small units are more cohesive than larger ones.  A family definitely acts differently than larger communities.  It's almost as if there was a change in the risk/reward calculations when we stopped living day to day in a hunter/gatherer-gonna-starve-this-winter society.

>And now under capitalism, ‘human nature’ means behaving as the capitalist class does; engaging in selfish competition.

Yup, because if someone has proven their ability to provide jobs and pay well above that of a communal hunter/gatherer group then it makes sense to follow them.  Success is a hell of a motivator.

And now you go off the rails.  If you mean benefits the people in charge more than the guy who punches a clock, then yes it does.  If you mean only benefits the guy in charge I can assume you have no idea what short, brutal lives hunter gatherers lived and your comparison to a factory worker is impaired by that.
