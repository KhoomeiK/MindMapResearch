But others have the right to a safe and legal abortion, so let them make that choice. That's what ""Pro-Choice"" is, and a lot of people forget that, that you have the choice. 

Also, it basically goes against our forefathers wishes by joining church and state. Your religion isnt that of everyone else's, if they even have it. Because not everyone is religious. But voting to have women be treated like cattle by restricting their options sounds very much like oppression.

funny,ff7r2t9,t1_ff72o3t,1579656298.0,Dunno why the downvotes. Excellent pun.
TwoXChromosomes,ff7i8q9,t1_ff6nxjb,1579650163.0,"Dunno why the downvotes.. legitimate questions should be answered legitimately so it can help clear up any confusion. 

To answer your first question: Yes, parents should have a say in their child's medical issues, especially things concerning surgery and extensive medical complications that would inhibit the child from making a sound medical decision. Anesthesia renders the person unable, therefore the parent steps in. Medical complications, like chemo, or even cystic fibrosis, because children dont fully grasp consequence of action. In the case of birth control, a 14 or 15 year is executing sound judgement and competence because they realize they are sexually active and dont want to get pregnant. If the parents can't understand their child is a sexual being, the parents are showing poor judgement by having zero respect, or even acknowledging their kid is a person too. Its ignorance like that which make girls afraid to talk to their parents and apparently the parent would rather her get pregnant just to chastise her and send her packing. Which could be avoided with precautions. Which is cheaper? 800 a year or thousands over 18 to 21 years, maybe longer. 

Tl;dr: pill is cheaper than pregnancy. Dont want your daughter having sex, just stitch her vag shut and pretend your kid cant have sex because they arent a real person, rather your property. 

2nd question: argument for parental involvement? Personally I feel an FYI should suffice, and really, it's not the parents that have to bear the burden of her pregnancy when so often the parents choose to kick them out anyway. Its condemning women who want to have sex in general, because god forbid a woman be anything other than what the man wants her to be in life? It shouldn't be the teenager's problem that the parents are delusional, disrespectful, and controlling to the point of abuse. Any complications that arise can easily be discussed with a doctor. It just makes it easier on her if the parents are on board rather than fighting it. You can only live in denial so long. 

Question 3: what legal argument? Guns are people's property, are you insinuating the teen is property? Or are you asking that parents should bear the responsibility of raising her child because they forced her to have the baby? I mean, this reminds me of the immigration argument: ""Why don't you house an illegal immigrant if you're so okay with illegals crossing the border."" People who force pregnancy should house the baby if they want them to have babies so bad. And until a politician legally adopts a womans baby they force her to have, they can go jump off a bridge for all I care, because those legislations go back to her being treated as property by others. 

Question 4: how can it all be about her body? Forcing a girl to birth a baby and provide no assistance, especially if she gets kicked out, puts that baby at risk of dying. A baby she didnt even want to begin with. So now not only did you force her to birth, but your forcing the baby's death. So ""pro life"" arguments of giving babies chances is moot when you so willingly allowed it to die anyway. 

Tldr: the state can save more money by allowing sexually active teens to gain birth control versus setting up aid and assistance and housing, and forcing her to be property because of one thing she did that has now ruined her life. Imagine failing that math test in 2nd grade so now the only job you get is picking shit up on the side of the road, you slacker."
TwoXChromosomes,ff7f8oc,t1_ff6d8wh,1579648180.0,"I'll explain why you're being downvoted I guess..

2nd trimester is from (usually) week 13 to week 28. The earliest and i mean the average earliest a baby can be viable outside the womb is 28 weeks. Which at 28 weeks, abortion is no longer legal. 

Now, sometimes, and I'm not saying it happens a lot, but women sometimes dont find out until week 13, at that point, it's to late. So, now you're setting up a woman to get an unsafe, back alley abortion for a thing that isnt even viable.

Also, inb4 ""religion,"" that won't change my views because there is supposed to be a separation of church and state. Also also, your religious ideologies end where another person's body begins. Also also also, before the preachy ""I advocate for the unborn, until I see someone adopt the baby they forced a woman to have, you can just stop before you start that nonsense."

The fact that priests go years to decades of doing this sick and warped shit speaks for itself that what I say holds true. Background checks may catch the odd one out.

Now, what does that mean for us in the democratic party? It means that if the 2020 election is rigged, and trump wins, it will take another 4 fucking years to ""prove"" that and we are stuck. 

If it is NOT rigged, and he wins.. well, sucks for us. 

If it is NOT rigged and someone else wins, Mitch will bring up the election interference issue and will use 4 years of trump sitting in office to determine it was not rigged. 

If it is rigged and someone else still wins, Mitch will have proof immediately to show how it was rigged and slander our party's name. 

The only way to prevent this disaster from continuing is a bold face assassination of the president and/or Mitch McConnell. I'm not saying I would or that I even condone it, but unless either is abruptly removed from office, democrats ain't winning shit.
