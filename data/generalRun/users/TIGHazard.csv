David Cronenberg's film of J G Ballard's controversial 1973 novel had already aroused comment in the press before it was submitted to the BBFC. **Its screening at the 1996 Cannes Film Festival had provoked the Evening Standard's film critic, the late Alexander Walker, to describe the film as 'beyond the bounds of depravity'**. On the day of its UK premiere at the London Film Festival (where it was shown without a BBFC certificate but with the special permission of Westminster Council) **the front page of the Daily Mail demanded 'Ban This Car Crash Sex Film'.** This was to mark the beginning of an intensive and orchestrated campaign against the film by the Daily Mail and Evening Standard.

He concluded that, in itself, the film would have no such effect**. **The film was also screened to a group of eleven disabled people, because it had also been suggested that the film's portrayal of some of its disabled or injured characters engaged in sexual activity could be offensive.** Although the invited **group did not generally enjoy the film, they concluded that its depiction of disabled people as being able to be both sexually attractive and active, (despite rather than because of their injuries), was generally a positive thing.**

With the combined weight of legal and psychological advice, the opinions of disabled viewers, and the unanimous view of the BBFC examiners that the film was neither harmful nor dangerous for adult audiences, Crash was classified at 18 uncut on 18 March 1997. Predictably, the BBFC's careful and considered decision was not welcomed by the Daily Mail or Evening Standard with a campaign against the BBFC's decision became increasingly vicious between the time of the film's classification and its release, **resorting to publishing the photographs and personal details of the BBFC's examiners and ridiculing them as unrepresentative 'liberals' who had refused to ban an offensive and dangerous film.**

The inquest concluded that the crash was caused by the driver of the car committing suicide by parking the vehicle on the crossing.

Seven people were killed in the crash: the car's driver, the driver of the train, and five of its passengers. About 200 people were on board at the time of the incident (official estimates are around 180–200). About half of these were injured, 12 of them seriously.

And then CBS picked him for the late late show after using that clip I linked as a demo reel.

(Also a lot of the segments on the late late show are also filmed for a league of their own except the editing is completely different, as they often have the other people on that show with him but they are edited out of the late late show version of the clip, so I imagine there's some sort of co-production agreement that saves CBS some money which may also be why they picked him)"
