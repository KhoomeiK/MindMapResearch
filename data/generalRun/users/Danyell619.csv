ADHD,ffwjib8,t3_evduc2,1580303042.0,"You have every right and it's actually really normal to be mad right now.  You have had a hard life with very little answers.  I'm in such a similar boat.  Diagnosed at 6, ignored for the next 30 years.  I struggled, got in trouble, never had good friends.  Now I struggle with anxiety and depression.  I may not have had all that if my parents had taken my diagnosis seriously.  But I think they just didn't know what to do about it while super poor in the 80s.  So I got coffee not Ritalin. 

Well there are a few upsides if you want the silver lining.  (And no I'm not going to wax poetic about hyperfocus and creativity) by waiting this long you know a lot of coping techniques.  You have somehow managed to get this far.  Your not in jail or dead (just a guess) right now.  You are probably an expert at showing up either ten minutes early or twenty minutes late.  You can most likely get things done at the 12th hour and do them WELL.  You have learned how to live the best you can without meds and therapy.  Feel proud, that's no small accomplishment.  

Back to your parents. At least they gave you a pretty good range of reactions.  From ""your gonna be a drug addict"" to ""eh, not a big deal/doesn't exist"" But there is also the ever popular ""everyone must be ADHD because I lose my keys sometimes."" So just be ready for that if you decide to tell anyone.  Very rarely will you get the appropriate reaction.  ""Wow, that must have been difficult, how are you doing now?""

I had a lot of anger and guilt to process about my parents.  A whole lot of normal ""what ifs"". But I also know that deep down they wanted the best for me and a combination of bad information and circumstances I didn't get the best for me.  But now it's in my hands.  I can do what's right for me.  I can know better for my kids (with the genetic component it's likely).  I can start NOW at 37.  And I have decided that maybe I don't forgive my parents 100% that I don't hate them for it, but I also feel like they could have been more understanding.  They could have told me and prepared me.  Even if they didn't treat me.  So, now I am just showing them what I could have been all along.  I'm proving that I was always smart just not able.  That I didn't have to be ""the screw up kid"" or ""the problem child."" In the long run they made it hard on both of us.  And now they can see what could have been, for both of us.  I know they feel bad because my life has been so improved with medication and it's SO OBVIOUS.  But I don't really rub it in or hold it back.  I just let them live with their choices.  

Side note: ever feel like you want to be a better person and just have never understood why you couldn't get there?  Well now you know AND can be much more proactive about it.  I had given up on myself at about your age.  Figured I wasn't smart, everyone had just been wrong or I fooled them.  Didn't realize I could help myself in a lot of ways.  Even of you decide not to medicate just knowing and having realistic expectations can end a lot of suffering for yourself.  Congratulations, Don't focus on the what could have been.. focus on the what can now be."

JustNoTalk,ffqxjre,t3_eun38r,1580145895.0,"My MIL posted her yearly passive aggressive woe is me im missing my granddaughters birthday post on Facebook.  She is bat shit nuts on Facebook so I go there regularly to keep tabs and documentation jik.  I keep wanting to fire back that she chose to step away from US.  But I do not ever ever want NC broken.  It was just a giant relief when she chose religion over us.  Took the pressure off of us to do it first.  She has tried to reach our daughter around us through some social apps, but the dumb ass bitch either didn't know we make sure we can see EVERYTHING she does on social media and over apps or didn't think we would.  Yeah right, she's 11, we have very serious technology rules and we keep a close eye on what she does.  In fact we have intercepted every communication MIL has tried.  It's been 5 years and I LOVE the silence.  I love that I'm not constantly worried about what her creepy husband is doing, I love not having political and religious debates because she won't stop till she says something offensive to set my husband off. I love having her crazy at an observable distance but not even close to my children.  I love the energy I don't waste on her!  Oh and I have TWO kids, but the youngest never got old enough before NC to adore her grandmother and feed the Nbeast so she doesn't exist in MILs world.  Only the kids who old enough to give HER attention are useful.  She only tolerates babies as a way to get herself familiarized so they don't ignore her when they get old enough to be bought with gifts.  She is a horrible woman and I don't really wish anyone harm, but I do kinda hope some of her more questionable decisions come back to haunt her one day (she is part of community that rejects not just vaccination but any doctor, as a fundamentalist Jew for Jesus she places her health in God's hands.

femalefashionadvice,ffqqo81,t1_ffqpvqn,1580141400.0,Thank you!  There is a wig store in town so I was going to go and look so I can at least get an idea of price ranges.
femalefashionadvice,ffqm9bp,t3_euoe01,1580138361.0," I'm going to try here before I make my own thread because I'm not 100% sure this is even the right place to ask but:

How do I buy a decent wig?  I have a mohawk that I really love, but might be kind of outlandish for my husband's new professional look and ambitions.

Before you say anything this is completely my idea, this is about me feeling awkward in fancy places with a mohawk.  My husband has stressed over and over he doesn't want me to change for his ambitions, and I DO love my mohawk.  But I want to be able to go nice places with him and feel comfortable.  I don't feel so bad rocking it to girl scouts or the PTA, but a fancy charity dinner, or meeting some important people and he is going into something where image is *very* important.  So this is about my comfort not his image, before anyone wants to roast him.  Sorry of I'm defensive, I had to defend my 'hawk a lot to family, and they give my husband hell over ""letting"" me do it.... It has never nor would he want it to be, his choice. 

So, all I can think of is to get one in my natural color.  How much should I spend for something that can be styled and look ok?  I know you can cut and style a good one.  I guess I prefer this option so it looks natural.  How will I know if it's going to look ok before that?  Do I take it to my normal stylist? How do I buy one that fits my smallish head? Most adult women hats are too big for me.  Can I wash it?  How?  Is there maybe just a good wig related resource?  Sorry this got long."

My daughter LOVES pokemon and was always a little sad she had to ask for a ""boys toy"" Not like a huge deal but she would ask a lot of questions about it being ok to play with pokemon, if she shouldn't and all in all it just confused her that toys needed to be for boys or girls. I didn't raise her to put genders into boxes, so she didn't understand how a penis made you like pokemon more.  Both my kids get to make their own choices for stuff.  My youngest loves jewelery and hair bows and dresses.  She also loves Ninja turtles and rocket ships and marching through mud...in her dresses.  She generally wants both toys.

I mean supportive parenting is one thing, but sending your kid off to a religious compound for a religion your not familiar with is a bit too lenient.
