If an advanced enough group came across the detailed plans of the robobrains and someone within made the connection, they may be able to use that form of machine linking technology to manufacture a great many types of prosthetics for any part of the body.

It is not an important distinction to make because especially in America where segregation was extremely recent and refers specifically to racial segregation, everyone in the conversation knew exactly what we were talking about, and you just wanted to butt in to point out something totally unnecessary and in many ways completely unrelated. 

When discussing how segregation as a stance is re-emerging in places like universities, you can rest assured knowing they are talking about enforced race related segregation. 

All I’m asking you to do is use a little common sense. The topic needed no specification. Only you were the person who thought it did. The rest of us have no problem identifying the vast difference in scale between freely associating and forced racial segregation. 

Just move on."
ThatsInsane,ff7hd3i,t1_ff7ctcw,1579649578.0,"Lemme say I know I was talking pretty extreme, but it’s Because they enjoy it. I hunt, and even though that means I occasionally take the life of an animal, I also hold immense value and respect in the lives of animals and it is a big deal to me mentally, emotionally and spiritually. You don’t take it lightly. 

There are people in the world who find joy and laughter in the terror and suffering of innocent life. People who enjoy being responsible for death and cruelty. 

If someone is like that, if someone can find a form of happiness while watching an innocent creature in shear terror and agony, I wish the absolute worst fate imaginable onto that someone. 

There are some things a person will do out of survival, some to protect, and some out of revenge. These men are totally separate from the man who kills or causes suffering out of enjoyment. 

Tl;dr, I think anyone who enjoys watching defenseless animals in suffering has no humanity and i also believe they do not respect life enough to warrant be allowing to live one. 

Granted, this is coming from someone who just advocated the extreme torture of one of these people, but once a crime crosses a certain line I believe punishments should shift to “eye for an eye” justice. 

Example, if you are convicted of abducting and torturing someone, you in turn would be imprisoned and tortured in a way that delivered an identical amount of suffering. 

The problem comes when trying to figure out who would deliver these punishments as asking someone to do that would be unethical, however I stand by the fact that the culprits are still as deserving of those punishements. 

Humans are stupid and they will always make horrible choices. The way I see it, put it in the context of prices at the market. 

The price for raping someone for an hour? You yourself are violently raped, possibly to death, for several hours. 

You knew that would be the punishment long before you did it, so there is absolutely no excuse in trying to get a lighter sentence. 

I understand instituting something like this would be drastically different than how it is written and very likely would not function as I am imagining, however I stand by the fact that regardless of possibility of being instituted the punishments still fit."

You are referring to segregation as along the lines of how only native Americans are allowed to own eagle feathers or own casinos in certain areas. That is not the topic of discussion here in any sense. 

We are talking about segregation as it has been expressed recently in our own history, as was so painfully obvious. You, are not. 

There is no situation in which segregated schools and diners and government buildings and military units as we know them would be good. 

Let me make this clear.  We are not talking about clicks. We are not talking about clubs. We are not talking about social groups.

There’s also one that’s technically inaccessible in the ocean outside far harbor but you can see it if you are looking in the right spot. 

Looking up or youtubing “Fallout 4 secondary locations- vertibird” will make it easier to find them all of you wanted to.

This would have been his method. Search the place it was being held before transport. If it wasn’t there, begin checking along the routes it would have been on if it was being delivered. If it’s not anywhere there, then he would have started trying to investigate who had looted there before through collecting information and bribing, and he would use that to see if anyone who had been there before had picked it up.

Iron is a step down from steel. It is simply not as strong. There is a reason humanity progressed from the Iron Age. There are plenty of iron mills, but only one steel mill (that we know of)

That means whoever controls the Steel Mill has access to stronger metals than any other faction can currently mass produce.

I thought I remembered hearing this in game, but I can’t remember where and this doesn’t have a citation yet in the wiki, so it really doesn’t mean much I suppose."
falloutlore,fcwx6hq,t3_ej9qg3,1578041435.0,"Being that slang evolved for its name, I think it’s safe to say that it exists as a legend if nothing else. 

We don’t have very much information on who knows about it, but atleast 3 people have gotten in and survived for sure, and countless more, possibly hundreds or even thousands of wastelanders have found there way there and gotten lobotomized. 

Since it hasn’t been approached by an organized force, it reasons that it probably isn’t well known outside of local communities. That said, it is clearly talked about either in reality or as a legend enough to develop the slang of “Big Empty”."
falloutlore,fcwwsl6,t1_fcwuvwc,1578040954.0,"That’s not correct. The brotherhood found the steel mill in the city and were aware of it and other useful or rare technology. The Brotherhood chose not to take The Pitt as a whole because they thought life was not sustainable there, or atleast that it was too hostile or toxic to sustain operations. They knew they were passing up valuable technology, but it was because they weren’t aware that they could stay there long enough to utilize or salvage it. 

Remember the brotherhood went through in one night, and it wasn’t because they had trouble killing the inhabitants, they decimated the population. 

In short, the steel mill was operational as it was noted as the only one of its kind in operation, and the Brotherhood passed it up because for one reason or another, they did not think continued operations there were possible. In reality though, they probably could have stayed long enough to do atleast minimal research or reverse engineering or what have you before pulling out while still remaining safe.  In my personal opinion I would guess they thought the city was too toxic and were worried about the Trog Contagion. *the way the quote is worded though they also may have been dealing with resistance once they started pulling out, although most recollections of the event make it out like it was an overwhelming Brotherhood victory with 0 casualties. 

Dude, Banana, this is what I’m talking about though. You are always making up shit to suit your own opinions. Read Ashurs Diary. It’s all right there. 

Ishmael Asher- 

“Commander had us torch the place and take what we could. The Pitt had useful technology, but it was suicide to stay here.”

“This was the only working steel mill we'd ever seen.”

“We thought nothing could live in The Pitt.”

“The scavengers saw me as a god, so along with my Brotherhood know-how, it was easy to set up the basics.”

It’s all there online, read the whole transcripts for even more context. 
I agree about the manufacturing part though."

Advice,fcw4i7s,t1_fcw3sgt,1578016958.0,"Have you also realized your partner will not want to have sex with you 100% of the time?

Especially after a year or two, you will not be having sex everyday, I almost guarantee it. Even if you are still having sex often, your partner will not be in the mood every time you are horny, nor would it make sense for them to be. 

It’s not like a man who watches porn is choosing porn over his partner. It’s simple really. One party want to have sex, the other doesn’t. Than means you usually don’t have sex. If the first party still wants to, they masturbate. They might use porn to do so. It’s not a big deal."

I genuinely want to know why you always double down when anyone suggests anything remotely different than exactly what you say. It’s okay to say ‘yea I could see where you’re coming from, there may be evidence for that’

Also, I was not aware there was a statement on that validity of the various parts of wild wasteland. After all,  AFAIK the aliens existence and appearances alongside MZ are canon even if they are silly, so to not have the ones appearing in Wild Wasteland be would be odd. 

Idk, I’ve always liked them being apart of the games and ever since MZ it is fun that they have a bit of an identity."
falloutlore,fccxer8,t1_fc502m0,1577603800.0,"I don’t think that is necessarily true. I think they will just make an excuse as to why the vaults are numbered completely randomly in some parts of the country. 

Plus, there have been several vaults that weren’t numbered for one reason or another. They will probably end up padding the game with some of these non-numbered vaults of various purposes to help assuming they make that many more games."
falloutlore,fccuh8x,t3_eh17c1,1577602778.0,"We actually don’t have evidence that the BOS are doing any real manufacturing at all.
In my personal opinion I like to imagine they have some sort of manufacturing capabilities, but as far as the lore goes all we know is that they scavenge and repair. I’m pretty certain atleast. There are a few lines of dialogue that people argue over but there isn’t any definitive proof as far as I know. 

So to answer your question, it is unknown if they have factories at all. They have acquired a large portion of those things from salvage or taking them from other factions."

All you wanna do is be right. You don’t debate, you don’t converse, you don’t even truly argue. I don’t know man, it’s like you are so sure of yourself that you think you’re the only one with the knowledge or something. I don’t need to tell you I’m not the only person who has told you this. 

You said at one point you see yourself as “tearing apart” comments, because it is efficient or whatever. Do what you have to do, but know that I dislike receiving a comment from you not because I dislike alternate theories or fact correction, but I dislike comments from you because after responding to them I have to continue to deal with that kind of mindset and thought process. 

In other words, the way in which you choose to communicate with others is not enjoyable, and in my own opinion it makes you come off very arrogant. Not trying to say I’m perfect here, but damn man I feel like I atleast try not to be unnecessarily rude to the people who love the same game I do."
falloutlore,fc3yrtu,t1_fc3mqgc,1577402113.0,"Operation Anchorage was actually a simulation made from wildly inaccurate data. It can be found out in game that the simulation of Anchorage is nothing like the actual battle. Battles and combat were completely customized to make the U.S. military seem even tougher as well as their fights more heroic. It was exaggerated and customized. 

There’s basically no information from within the simulation that can be counted on with any degree of certainty as far as information about real life is concerned. It might as well have been a dream for the most part. 

Also being an Alaskan I can tell you that it looked nothing like Alaska in any way. They are never able to perfectly recreate an area In game, but usually there are specific landmarks or other features to make the area feel like what it is supposed to be. 

Operation Anchorage however was just a completely randomized landscape that really doesn’t have anything in common with Alaska or Anchorage. Not to bag on OA here, but it really wasn’t representative of Alaska at all."
falloutlore,fc150i1,t3_efkt36,1577308439.0,"As someone else stated, in the Pitt there is a baby immune to the troglodyte degenerative contagion (TDC). “According to Dr. Sandra Kundanika, it is the result of intensively concentrated ambient radiation exposure combined with the unique industrial toxins and pollutants in the region that surrounds what was once Pittsburgh.”

If this disease is caused by intense radiation alongside unique pollutants, if the baby is immune to TDC then it would have to be immune to both parts of what makes up the disease. It would make sense that the baby would have to be immune both to the pollutants, as well as the radiation. 

Going off of that logic, if The Pitt successfully creates a cure for TDC, it could be a possible to use it for or adapt it to ghoulification. 

That is assuming a cure gets created, that it works, and that someone has the idea to try to use it on ghouls. Even then it may just not work, but in my mind there are enough similarities between troglodytes and ghouls to make it worth looking into."
