Idk if it was going to make more money but the quality was definitely not going to be as great with out his involvement. Funny you mentioned Pitt.

Like who? Marvel actors can’t carry a movie outside marvel as you can see with RDJ Doolittle’s flop. The Rock was never going to do a great job in the transition between a coward to a badass the way Cruise did. The only people i can think of is maybe Leo or will Smith?? but they don’t do their own stunts (by their own admission) so the camera work was going to be inferior. Also Cruise and Mcquarrie made a lot of changes from the manga that made the movie better. Tom was not keen on Rita being a manic pixie chick and wearing a pink armor like the manga."
