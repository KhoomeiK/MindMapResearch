Only during the end of season 3/beginning of season 4 does she improve her life. That's when she dumps roy, confesses her feelings for jim, tells karen very directly how she feels, and puts in motion her joining art school.

Very quickly, when she experiences her first minor failure (art school) she gets stung and never gets over it again. She goes back to being stagnant Pam, which we assume was her situation for her entire life. 

So, it is no surprise that she is incredibly resistant to change when Jim has his existential crisis and wants a career change. Even though she admired his ambitions, and encouraged him to build his career when they were just friends (or were dating), by the time he actually starts doing so she is out of the habit of embracing change.
