DebateReligion,fg0tbfy,t1_fg0t45g,1580414607.0,"why would you feel the need to do that? To harmonize biblical statements with modern morals? it feels it's like when you watch a baby trying to force a square object into a round hole. God's moral should be god's moral, if you try to fit it to current time morals is kinda like implying God is wrong. He didn't feel the need to update his message since the gospels, why should you do the job he hasn't done?  **Christianity shouldn't try to be progressive,** as long as they keep using as a reference a book that has been written from 4000 to 2000 years ago it makes no sense. **christianity should be consistent**, if the book hasn't changed in the last 2000 years so they shouldn't, it makes no sense that one thing is a sin in year 200 cause the culture at the time sees it as a sin and it's totally ok with god in year 2000 cause the culture at this time sees it as ok.

and if you can actually read the bible in different ways in order to adapt it to current morals and times, through times, through cultures, it's kinda like admitting the book is so open to interpretations it's useless.

i mean don't get me wrong, **personally if you ask me I prefer by far progressive christians as persons**, they're usually more open on things that matter to me and more open minded, i just don't think they're christians, i think they're probably good people who believe they're christians and call themselves christians, but **they're as christian as a modern chinese today is a communist** if you get what i mean."

religion,ffzxhms,t1_ffzwygx,1580395411.0,"**there's absolutely no chance to fix it cause on average people are too stupid. it's as simple as that.**

This scam is like 5000 years old and is still working, go check archeologicals accounts and you'll see religious leaders were doing all sorts of meddling since ancient egyptians times, in every cultures, egypt, babylonian, greek, chinese, indian, anyone, because that's human's nature.  

Unfortunately religion is a taboo argument, they're wolves dressed as sheeps and any critique to religious leaders can be easily dismissed as an attack toward religions as a whole. Even Jesus himself was sentenced to death in the gospels cause he was attacking jewish leaders of the time. Therefore if in the u.s. you critique's evangelical's leader for being corrupted they'll easily be able to convince all christians in the u.s. that you're attacking christians as a whole, christians rights and christians believes and they'll attack you back and see you as their enemy even if ultimately what you wanna do is help them from evil snake oil sellers.

and a small proof of that is you'll see how people will downvote this quickly.

Cause as i said the average men is too stupid, uneducated and used to reason by tribal logics to see the thruth, people don't care about thruth they like conforting lies and hate with a passion anyone bursting their lies.

Only chance you have, realistically, to fix it, is that some religious leaders become so rogue, so corrupted, so power thirsty that they screw up so badly in the name of their religion that people at that point ask for special laws to prevent anything similar to happen again but if that moment doesn't come, forget about it, they're in the driving seat and won't let anyone else drive."
Scotland,ffzwsh1,t3_ew2fal,1580394917.0,if brexit has proven anything repeat an empty slogan devoided of any substance but catchy long enough and they'll buy it.  50% of english people are a lost cause so who cares.
Scotland,ffzwix5,t1_ffzv9jt,1580394724.0,"westminster is between a rock and a hard stone.

Support indyref2 and you risk scotland to leave and the uk to fall apart and you'll get the blame. Just like the brexit referendum ( and just like brexit if that happens they'll be able to spin it and tell the english finally the scottish burden is gone and it's a good day for england, and they'll buy it ).

Don't support indyref2 and you'll just encourage more scottish people to ask for indipendence, you're postponing the problem and making it bigger than it is now.

I guess Westminster's official policy is just to ignore Scotland completely as long as possible wich is precisely why Scotland must push hard for it, Scotland's actions must make scotland's voice unignorable, it's the only way to do it."
Scotland,ffzw5pg,t3_ew5bs0,1580394460.0,i think if anything serious has to come from this it should be this year as long as scotland still have one foot inside the EU. if the uk manages to respect their own goal of leaving by the end of 2020 ( wich i doubt to be possible ) it will be much easier to push scotland's will now than in a year.
religion,ffzvmv5,t1_ffzuknh,1580394082.0,"problem is the political weight some religions have compared to others.

christians are so politically connected that in some states they can make the absurd become possible like teaching creationism as science or forcing non christian people to recite prayers at school or in public offices.

the moment a muslim group in the united states manages to force public workers to recite the 5 prayers or students to study the kuran as a science book is the moment you see people taking out their rifles in the street.

the u.s. has historically a problem with white christian extremists that they always failed to recognize.

religion should completely stay out of politics, if religious people don't want certain rights for themselves cause it upset their gods they should be free to renounce them. Don't want gay right, if you're gay don't marry. don't like abortion, if you're christian don't do it. But stop arassing people and forcing your god down their throat or expect to be called out for that, as it should be"

\- people are infective for two weeks with no symptoms, meaning they'll move on with thair daily life, go to work, supermarket, visit friends and spread it.

\- china cities are under quarantine but so many people left them already and had two weeks each to spread the virus.

\- other countries too were late in taking actions to minimize its spreading, you keep hearing about people coming back from china and not getting checked unless they come back already with a fever.
