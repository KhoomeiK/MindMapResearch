The ops are constantly telling everyone to hurry up and they have xx seconds left to get seated if they want a duel. The ride unfortunately isn't designed to guarantee a duel every cycle (like WCR) because they can't just shut down the green lift hill every time the blue side is lagging. The green chain does slow down to allow the blue to catch up, but it can't just stop because it would cause undue stress on the lift motor. Blame the dumbass GP for no duels, not Six Flags. When I was last on TC in December, the train was held up for 3 minutes while some dumb woman was having a standoff with the ride op because she wouldn't leave her precious Coach bag unattended in the bins for fear of it being stolen. She wouldn't get out of the train and refused to not ride.  She insisted on holding onto it. Even her husband was yelling at her to just go put it away. The other train was stacked on the final brake run for a full minute before we finally were dispatched."

I know the food delivery apps have revolutionized eating out. Before if you wanted Chili's, you had to get in your car and slog down there yourself. Now it comes to you and you don't even have to talk to anyone. And normally tips are given to delivery drivers like with pizza places. It's all a bit of a gray area. It certainly isn't wrong to ever tip, but it shouldn't be expected when it isn't a traditionally tipped position, so when those people in those positions get pissed because they aren't being tipped is where I have an issue."

This is why you always quarantine your livestock before adding anything to your display tank. Also, some stupid or ignorant fish stores would sell these because they are so beautiful. There are plenty of non lethal octopii that can be kept as a pet, but they are extremely intelligent and usually find a way to escape your tank, no matter how secure you think it is."

Originally there were only 13 cameras monitoring the ride, but after the upgrade there isn't an inch of the ride that isn't in view of a camera."
