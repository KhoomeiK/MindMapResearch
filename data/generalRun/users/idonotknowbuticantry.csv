TooAfraidToAsk,ffijnz8,t1_ffhd5uk,1579975467.0,"I wouldn’t call it ethnocentric by any meaning of the word. As a kid in school I was always told that we’re “the melting pot of the world” and “a nation of immigrants”. Mind you this was a nearly all white evangelical Christian school in the Deep South. 

But patriotic, elitist, and some sense that we’re responsible for the well-being of other nations, yes that is very much part of our culture."

worldnews,fdqwr82,t1_fdpyxv7,1578675985.0,Ok well yes that would be an example of hypocrisy if reddit only allowed liberals to threaten the death of conservatives.
worldnews,fdqv5wa,t1_fdqtrpj,1578675303.0,Man I appreciate you trying but he wasn’t worth all that effort. He’s in so deep one reddit comment isn’t going to change him very much.
worldnews,fdpy1h0,t1_fdpwxqp,1578645406.0,"I see your point, you’re right we live in a mostly Christian country where politicians make decisions based on the Bible. And yes a lot of anti Islamism is quite prejudiced to Muslims and the ethnicity most of them are. 

But that doesn’t mean we cannot hold all religions accountable for their falsehoods and danger as they deserve it. And Islam is quite dangerous, not only in countries where millions are literally oppressed by being forced to follow the whims of religious scholars that obviously do not read the basic human rights that are not in the Quran but also in western countries where these same scholars, scriptures, and ideas are being fed into fanatical people that can vote, or worse attempt to carry out their religious practices regardless. 

I think that the western world is becoming more secular and Christianity has lost its grip on political power over the centuries in nearly every country. There’s still a good way to go but we’ve come a long way compared to the Islamic world. And I don’t think we should give up on secularizing society from any religion, anywhere."
worldnews,fdpwep0,t1_fdpv3yz,1578643304.0,"I also dislike the hypocrisy that comes with choosing what to ban and what not to ban. Sometimes it’s easy, obviously ban child porn, but other times the area is quite gray and it can be difficult tk determine how dangerous particular content is and how far you want to stretch freedom of speech. I don’t believe in complete freedom of speech for everyone on every platform. I can’t break into a congressional session and advertise my new mixtape. I can’t hold a kkk meeting in a public school. 

There are rules for every platform and that platform has the right to defend what can be discussed. And you should be able voice your opinions in some shape or form without damaging some form of platform or causing harm. I believe that is very possible, but I just want to point out that it’s hard to draw the line sometimes, although I agree many extremist groups (on both sides) are drawing their lines pretty fucking close to their ideology bubble."

AvPD,fdpupox,t3_emgcay,1578641258.0,"Take it slow. Baby steps, slowly increasing the exposure each time. Go one place one day, make it an easy familiar place and interact with people as least as possible. Take a break for a few days, try again. At some point begin increasing the difficulty (saying hi to the cashier, asking where an item is, eventually plan small talk, try a bigger, busier store, etc.) 

I’ve been slowly getting out of my comfort zone and shopping in less familiar places, I started with my local pharmacy but options were limited and expensive but it was also empty and quiet as fuck so it was easy. It’s taken months but now I go to the local grocery store frequently, I plan on trying the even bigger grocery store and maybe someday Walmart perhaps although that definitely won’t be common. 

But yeah going to get my own haircut, buying things from convenience stores around town, hell even talking more to my coworkers has made me much less isolated and anxious. Granted this all took me fucking years but I’m much better now then the nervous wreck before. By the way meditation and therapy helped me a lot too. Maybe try CBT or reading up on Stoicism. I’ve heard excellent results from the former and the latter was very useful."

But my loved ones? Those I truly care about. And if that’s a child I want to love and take care of then of course, but if the mother does not want to make the sacrifice to her body and wellbeing for making the damn baby then I can find one who will and not force the creation of life onto someone."
worldnews,fdpoyu1,t1_fdpf37o,1578635124.0,"I agree that American Christians have a ridiculous victim complex but the left (in America) are absolutely not as fair to ridiculing Christians as they are to Muslims. In our unending quest for tolerance and anti bigotry we have defended a horrific ideology that promotes killing homosexuals and apostates. We believe Muslims when they say that they have “a religion of peace” and we ridicule Christianity but don’t touch Islam without seeing the irony in our behavior. 

Christianity is a nonsensical, backwards system of belief that would do the world a favor by dying out but Islam is ten times worse."
