TooAfraidToAsk,ff9d9c8,t3_es9ifn,1579710457.0,"So his upbringing probably is a reason he was like that but to put it as bluntly as possible:

Your ex is a twat. You do not spend four months dating someone you are unattracted to, you just don't. He comes of as very immature and that he doesn't know what he really wants/can't or won't commit.

If it wasn't this it would have been some other problem that would have cropped up, you're better off."
TooAfraidToAsk,ff9crvj,t3_esdoxc,1579710093.0,"I think that's going to depend on the person, some struggle and some don't and those that do struggle do so for different reasons.

I slept through a lot of my classes and still passed for example so for myself it wasn't anything special that I graduated because it wasn't an accomplishment to me, for those that busted their asses it probably was.

I felt more accomplished with myself the first time I benched 225 then from anything I did for all of high school."
