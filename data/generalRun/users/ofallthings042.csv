husky,ff76vw5,t3_es16xu,1579642297.0,"I actually have the same combo, GSD and Siberian husky, it's a whirlwind but it's an amazing duo.
Together they produce what my wife and I refer to as tumbleweeds. I just vacuumed yesterday, but right now I can see several piles of fur. Expect lots of fur. Especially when they play inside during a blowout, it just flys off of them.
As for training, my husky hasn't actually been THAT bad, just a lot more stubborn with tricks. He loves working commands for pulling and making turns, but hates laying down or giving his paw. Lately treats and toys both get him too excited to train, but just giving him some affection seems to work like a charm."

Blacksmith,feewct6,t3_eot0eo,1579042631.0,"I started for $12, the amount I paid for my cross peen hammer. Built an in ground stone forge, repurposed a vacuum, found while dumpster diving, for a blower, power with wood and charcoal, live near a rail line and found a section of rail along with some plates and spikes. I don't use it much, but it wasn't $700."

The only non cliche thing that was ever helpful to me was to try and turn anger into sadness. It's much healthier to cry while eating pizza and gallons of ice cream than it is to punch a hole in the wall every day or holding it all in. Good luck, stay strong, and remember to cry."

husky,fd9ayaf,t3_ekce3b,1578230927.0,"Huskies are a very demanding breed. They require hours of play every day to keep them from being bored and destructive, they're also likely to run at the first chance they get, which means they need a secure area to get those hours of play. With training you can limit the instinct to run away, but it takes time and dedication to train such a stubborn breed to do anything. They're also incredibly social, so no you won't get much ""me time"". My GSD sleeps on the floor by choice, but I can't do anything to stop my husky from sharing my pillow while we spoon.  Huskies are also notorious for peeing inside even when housebroken, the only way to truly prevent it is to take them outside often, but the way I tell if my dogs are actually needing to go out or just wanting to play by feeling the lower area of their stomachs to check for a full bladder. 

They are adorable, but in all honesty it sounds like a husky is too demanding for your lifestyle."
