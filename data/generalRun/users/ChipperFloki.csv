SWlegion,ffseewd,t3_eux1r2,1580179698.0,"100% agree with the comment below, that’s the best part of the game: you choose them, you build them and paint them how ever you want. Every one of us, beginners and master painters still has that little kid in us who gets excited just imagining leading a real version of our armies in the SW galaxy.  Your painting looks good, and you’re learning, your bases are on point mate. Good on ya, can’t wait to see more, especially as a fellow Imp."
