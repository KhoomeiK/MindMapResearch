ShitPoliticsSays,feep95r,t3_eoqggn,1579038349.0,"Come on, let's face the facts. The truth is, there is just no ""spark"" anymore. For example, up until the 90s and early 00s, a new movie coming to the theaters was still a big event. A blockbuster, anyway. Now, you can download any movie fairly quickly, and most of the movies are spoiled on social media within seconds of the premiere. Not so long ago, teenagers actually had to go out and meet up somewhere if they wanted to hang out. Well, they could talk over the phone, sure. But you know, the bills. Now there are (in addition to basic smartphones and email) Facebook, Instagram, Twitter WhatsApp, Skype...

Hey, I'm not really complaining. Heck, I couldn't do it without my phones and laptop, I probably spend more time online than I should have. But those are just some gadgets, and I don't even use social media other than Reddit. I still prefer reading a book or watching a documentary to reading a Wikipedia article, and I enjoy watching movies in theater or on TV much more than on my laptop. The world today (developed western world, ironically enough) just offers too much, too fast. Small joys of life are slowly being reduced to little more than automatic, it-figures processes like breathing (hyperbole obviously).

It doesn't help that many teens these days have used smartphones from an early age, thus getting used to that instant fun and temporary dopamine rush early on. That can't be good for your emotional development, or attention span.

But still, that's just the fuse. Combine that with the fact that those frustrated and impressionable teens are easily influenced (read: manipulated) by fear mongering media, making them anxious and depressed; and they easily buy into the PC culture, making them socially awkward, if not introverts; that mainstream media and popular culture keep telling them that they are either inherently privileged/flawed/evil or oppressed somehow, depending on their skin color/religion/social status etc. (see white privilege, toxic masculinity etc); yahoos that keep trying to somehow tie Trump's America to one of the most horrifying times in human history (Nazi Germany), while simultaneously saying that the world will soon end due to climate change anyway; and no wonder we ended up... here.

Heck, almost *everything* has been dumbed down. 10-15 years ago, National Geographic was putting out interesting and thought-provoking articles about endangered animals and ancient tribes/civilizations. Now they're putting out articles about pets. And global warming. And articles about how mass Muslim immigration is great for Europe. Journalism has gone to shit since Internet got big; they only care about the clicks, not the content. Not the truth. A click is still a click and people are easily fooled. Even non-political movies these days mostly suck: bland, cliche characters trying too hard to be cool/edgy/deep, forced-often vulgar/""topical"" humor, constant rehash of ""seen it before"". So many things are just so fake and immature these days, if that makes sense... it's difficult to explain, but I know it's the truth.

Today's teenagers have plenty of good reasons to be miserable. But neither of those reasons are what they are actually obsessing about. That's the saddest part.

Children-teenagers-are shaped by the world they live in; its culture, values, morals, society. Think about that.

> Regarded as a centrist New Democrat, Obama signed many landmark bills into law during his first two years in office. The main reforms that were passed include the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (commonly referred to as the ""Affordable Care Act"" or ""Obamacare""), the Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, and the Don't Ask, Don't Tell Repeal Act of 2010. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 and Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010 served as economic stimulus amidst the Great Recession. After a lengthy debate over the national debt limit, he signed the Budget Control and the American Taxpayer Relief Acts. In foreign policy, he increased U.S. troop levels in Afghanistan, reduced nuclear weapons with the United States–Russia New START treaty, and ended military involvement in the Iraq War. He ordered military involvement in Libya, contributing to the overthrow of Muammar Gaddafi. He also ordered the military operations that resulted in the deaths of Osama bin Laden and suspected Yemeni Al-Qaeda operative Anwar al-Awlaki.

> After winning re-election by defeating Republican opponent Mitt Romney, Obama was sworn in for a second term in 2013. During this term, he promoted inclusiveness for LGBT Americans. His administration filed briefs that urged the Supreme Court to strike down same-sex marriage bans as unconstitutional (United States v. Windsor and Obergefell v. Hodges); same-sex marriage was fully legalized in 2015 after the Court ruled that a same-sex marriage ban was unconstitutional in Obergefell. He advocated for gun control in response to the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, indicating support for a ban on assault weapons, and issued wide-ranging executive actions concerning global warming and immigration. In foreign policy, he ordered military intervention in Iraq in response to gains made by ISIL after the 2011 withdrawal from Iraq, continued the process of ending U.S. combat operations in Afghanistan in 2016, promoted discussions that led to the 2015 Paris Agreement on global climate change, initiated sanctions against Russia following the invasion in Ukraine and again after Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections, brokered a nuclear deal with Iran, and normalized U.S. relations with Cuba. Obama nominated three justices to the Supreme Court: Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan were confirmed as justices, while Merrick Garland faced unprecedented partisan obstruction and was ultimately not confirmed. During his term in office, America's soft power and reputation abroad significantly improved.

> Obama's presidency has generally been regarded favorably, and evaluations of his presidency among historians, political scientists, and the general public place him among the upper tier of American presidents. Obama left office and retired in January 2017 and currently resides in Washington, D.C. A December 2018 Gallup poll found Obama to be the most admired man in America for an unprecedented 11th consecutive year, although Dwight D. Eisenhower was selected most admired in twelve non-consecutive years."

Heck, it is probably better than most of the big-budget, social-issue movies that Hollywood puts out these days. I've seen Lauren Ambrose (Leah) in several different projects, watched interviews with her; there is no hate or bitterness to her, a sheer opposite to the guys that dedicated their lives to that podcast, or even most of the A-list celebrities these days.

But they just can't help themselves.
