You can also train the dog to recognize and interrupt nightmares. Generally the best way is to pretend, as accurately as possible. Recording yourself in your sleep is helpful. Try to mimic whatever sounds or movements you make when you're having a nightmare.

It's not completely proven scientifically, but there is evidence to suggest a dog may be able to smell cortisol in your saliva and recognize it that way. Results have been encouraging but not entirely consistent, so you probably don't want to put all your eggs in this basket. *But*...you may find it easier and more effective to train nightmare tasks if your dog sleeps in bed with you, specifically near your head."

The most difficult part was honestly figuring out what the hell I was doing that he could cue to. My first service dog offered it, it never occurred to me to train it, so with her it just took a bit of shaping. But with this dog, I knew I needed it and had to figure out how to start from scratch. It took some observation from my husband and a process of elimination to determine what symptoms were consistent and then how fake it accurately to replicate for training.

With the rigid handle... do what works for you. If people think you're visually impaired, so be it. The problematic person in this equation is not you for trying to find the best way to live with your disability. The problem is the person who jumps to conclusions about your disability based on their own ableism when it's frankly none of their business in the first place. It doesn't affect them and they aren't entitled to know your medical history unless they are actually your doctor, and that would be simple to correct."
service_dogs,ffcaooj,t3_esurly,1579795344.0,"I don't have this specific task in my needs, so I can't speak from personal experience as to issues with it. But it's a thing plenty of dogs are trained to do, without having to go through fully involved guide training. I would guess from experience though, that if your dog is walking ahead of you through crowds, you're going to run into a lot of situations where the general public impedes the task. You may be more vulnerable to things like drive by petting and even people blocking your dog's path because they don't realize or don't care the dog is tasking. You may want to start brainstorming ways to handle that, while keeping in mind your dog should never be aggressive or reasonably perceived as aggressive.  


My boy has a guide work task, very, very light guide work. If I get disoriented, he steers me to the side of the path and then stops me from walking before I hurt myself or something. It can be a bit tricky to associate guide work with symptoms if you need your dog to act independently, but it probably won't be difficult (as far as task training goes) if you can use a voice or hand signal to have the dog do it on command.   


If your dog is bearing weight, including pulling on a leash with any sort of force, it counts as mobility and it's best to get a properly sized, healthy dog (OFAs). If you just sort of need your dog to lead the way and you can follow without the dog needing to use physical strength, any dog should be physically capable of it."

If you're in the US, most housing providers are under the Fair Housing Act.

1. There's no licensing involved, just a doctor's note
2. Your health insurance doesn't care one way or the other
3. The landlord may still be able to refuse, but only if accommodating the dog would cause undue hardship

Think of the person you love most in all the world. Someone you trust and you think is a wonderful person, someone you know would never hurt you. Someone you honestly believe does not have an evil bone in their body.  


Now imagine I've told you that person, by name, is a sexual predator. Sounds ridiculous, right? I mean, you probably want to take the claim seriously, but really you just don't believe it. It becomes stuff like, ""they've never done anything like that before"" or ""u/Karaethon22 is a stranger, what the hell can they know?"" or ""I know they are fond of children but they'd never hurt a kid, not ever"" or ""it sounds like it's getting blown out of proportion"" or even ""lol no way.""  


The human brain has instincts like any animal does. Since we are social animals, some of our instincts are to trust people. Parents, family, friends, siblings. Our brains *fundamentally* believe that people in those roles are automatically trustworthy. When we're presented with evidence to the contrary, our brains are not equipped for the truth, and will twist the logic to fit the narrative. In order to truly take accusations seriously, people have to completely overhaul their own brains, their worldviews, their definitions of friends and family. That's difficult, to say the least, and most people simply are not ready. So they don't, and they just let their brain twist the logic to fit the narrative.  


Victims experience this too, the most obvious example being love and loyalty toward their abuser, because their brain is fundamentally convinced the person is trustworthy."
MensLib,ff42ziy,t1_ff3uc9o,1579554418.0,"I don't think it's a 1:1 cause/effect, but I do think homophobia has a significant portion of its roots in misogyny. Not all of them by any stretch; they are their own issues. But there's definitely a good bit of ""gay is bad because it's 'like women.'""

Some of that is sexual (the man being the ""recipient"" of sex), and some of it is cultural (traditionally feminine presentation is degrading to men). I think the most telling thing is how lesbians are often subjected to a completely different version of homophobia than gay men. Lesbians are sometimes treated like they exist to fulfill male fantasies. Occasionally people even act like lesbians are doing it to attract men (???). Or sometimes it's a ""phase"" where she's a tomboy or whatever, which is kind of ...humored?... by some people, like lesbians are little kids who want to be boys when they grow up (something that ties into transphobia as well).

Of course, lesbians also have to deal with the hateful type of homophobia that is directed at gay men. ""Sinning,"" ""unnatural,"" etc, but the misogynistic patronizing comes into it a bit more obviously sometimes, when men are more likely to experience the in-your-face variety."

AskReddit,feywnjy,t1_fexw3u1,1579451456.0,"It's probably both.

There are two kinds of addiction. Chemical and behavioral. Chemical addiction occurs with habit forming substances, and behavioral addiction occurs with things the addict enjoys and/or uses as a coping mechanism. The thing is, they are *not* mutually exclusive, and most chemical addictions are also behavioral. Behavioral addiction is the one that is more difficult to break.

Chemical addiction can be broken relatively quickly and easily. You just have to go through appropriate detox care to get it out of your system. Withdrawal usually sucks and can even be dangerous depending on the substance, but once you get through to the other side you're totally free.

Behavioral addiction is harder because you still just want to do it after you're clean. It takes willpower and determination and is a lifelong battle. People who relapse into drugs or alcohol after years of sobriety have kicked the chemical addiction long ago, but are still struggling with the behavioral aspect."

They still deserve appropriate medical care for their personal circumstances and they have a right to receive it. Mental and emotional trauma are very much the same (in fact, PTSD is medically classified as a brain *injury*, interestingly enough). You deserve to be in the metaphorical waiting room and you deserve care.

service_dogs,fenkpl2,t3_epy07e,1579286759.0,"Your dog legally changes from a SDiT to SD with task training that is consistent and reliable under any circumstances, but it's also a bit of a grey area. The public access rights are separate from the definition of a service animal, so in order to be legally covered in  non-pet friendly environments, they need the task training and enough public access training to be calm, unobtrusive, under control, and not post a threat to health or safety. If that sounds a bit vague, it's because it is. It's really subjective, but you'll ultimately need to comply with all of [this](https://www.ada.gov/regs2010/service_animal_qa.html).

In the US, your rights while in training are based on [state law](https://www.animallaw.info/topic/table-state-assistance-animal-laws). You may be covered or you may not be. If you are, the state can impose whatever restrictions they like about how your dog must be marked, as long as the dog is still in training. Once fully trained, they are under the ADA and exempt from gear requirements. But some states do require SDiT to be clearly marked. In Canada there is no federal law of any kind regarding service animals and it varies from province to province. I'm far from an expert on Canadian law, but I think most provinces require a public access test and some kind of identification. I think there are cards issued to service animals in some provinces and in others you need to carry a doctor's note.

Stopping people from distracting your dog is a losing battle. There is nothing you can do or say or make the dog wear to get people to leave you alone. Visible patches that say things like ""do not pet"" are helpful on occasion, but most of the time they're ignored. It's better than nothing in my opinion, so I recommend getting some, but don't count on it to actually work. Mostly you need to focus on the dog's training to control the situation. And yeah, it's a catch 22 when your dog is still learning to ignore things. They have to ignore it in order to learn how to ignore it, and everyone who distracts them undoes a bit of their training. So it's best to work your way up gradually, starting with things that are barely a distraction at all. A focus command is extremely helpful. I use ""look."" You can use a targeted hand signal to look in a specific place, or teach them to make and hold eye contact with you, by giving the command and holding a treat where you want them to look (for eye contact, always in front of your eyes, and gradually phase out the hand signal). With a good, solid, focus command you can teach the dog to actively ignore people who pay attention to them, and reward them for looking away.

ptsd,fekes7d,t3_epl9by,1579198534.0,"It's hard to support someone with PTSD. God knows I feel like a burden to my husband.

But the thing is they have to try if the relationship is to have any chance of success. Mistakes happen, boundaries get crossed, triggers forgotten, at the best of times. But a supportive person wants to do better. They want to learn your triggers and know what to avoid and what helps. They make an effort. They ask for clarification. They apologize when they know they messed up. Doesn't sound like that describes your boyfriend.

And regardless, he should never be deliberately saying things that he intends to hurt you. That is emotional abuse. From the sound of it, based on your post and other comments, this isn't the only emotionally abusive trait he has. If you were to pick up a textbook about abuse tactics and flip to the part that defines gaslighting, I can almost guarantee you would see ""you make it sound like I hit you"" word for word. Please protect yourself. And I notice you made a point of saying he's your child's father, so just in case...Please don't fall into the trap of ""staying for the kid."" It's normal to think that having their parents together is best for the child, but the parents have to be happy for that to be true. Even without abuse issues, staying together despite being unhappy usually does more harm than good.

With abuse factored in, whether he's directly abusing your child or just you, your son is in an abusive relationship. Spousal abuse is legitimately recognized as a form of child abuse all on its own. The reason is that children are sponges. Even if his relationship with his dad is sunshine and rainbows (unlikely as that is), he is still forming unhealthy impressions of domestic life at best.

askwomenadvice,fek2ktb,t3_epgd55,1579191266.0,"Sexual assault victim weighing in here.  


This was sexual assault. You're not taking anything away from me or anyone else because your experience wasn't ""bad enough."" Because it *was* bad enough. The fact that it's still bothering you several years later is enough to indicate that. The first time he did the groping thing, that's actually pretty creepy as far as how over the top it was for initiating a sexual relationship, but might have been forgivable if he had accepted that you weren't okay with it. The second time he did it, knowing that you hadn't appreciated the first time, was a deliberate violation of consent. And then getting you drunk to have sex with you when he knew you didn't want to that is rape. And then *again* the next morning?  


Look I know what it's like to feel like you're responsible for being sexually assaulted. Consent is *confusing* in the situation--not to the perpetrator, that's usually pretty clear--but to the victim. It is a natural defense mechanism in response to trauma. Our brains want to know the situation is under control and that we know how to prevent it from happening again. And unfortunately the consequence of that is that we victim blame ourselves. Stuff like ""I didn't stop him"" or ""I should have yelled more"" or ""I pretended I was half asleep because I didn't know what to do."" The other thing is that we minimize our own traumas, again as a defense mechanism for the brain to convince itself it can stay safe in the future. It is normal to feel like other people have it worse, or your experience wasn't that bad, and it doesn't matter what your experience actually was. Almost *everyone* who is struggling with trauma feels this way. In truth it doesn't even matter. What I or anyone else experienced with sexual violence means absolutely nothing in relation to whether your experiences are harming you. What happened to me, what I'm dealing with over it, none of it changes what happened to you or how it's affecting you. You're struggling, you deserve care for it. Period.  


Pretending to be asleep is a freeze response, by the way. Most people know about fight or flight, but there are actually four. Fight, flight, freeze, and fawn. A good example of a freeze response in nature are animals that play dead to deter predators. In humans it takes more complex forms, but is basically just not acting out of fear that you'll make it worse. You are not responsible for being raped (yes, raped, sex without consent is just rape) because you were protecting yourself the best way you knew how. You don't even really get to make those decisions; your subconscious does it for you, which is why people are often wrong when they think what they would do in a certain situation but do something completely different when it actually happens. It isn't your fault. At all."

Besides, if her response is that she doesn't want to clean the carpet, how much does it matter that she's hurt? *That's* her primary concern? If it truly is, she doesn't care about you at all and doesn't deserve for you to suffer so she doesn't have to.

There's a circle around problems, and a series of rings further and further out. If you're on one of the rings, it's okay to vent to others on your ring or further out rings, but not rings closer in. Let's say you have a coworker whose spouse died. You had met the deceased a few times and were starting to become friends. It is *okay* to be grieving and struggle with their death, but it would be inappropriate to seek support from your coworker, who is struggling much more with it.

The key word is justified. Self esteem issues are always justified in the mind of the person who is experiencing it, but may or may not be justified to other people. Ultimately we need to recognize that justification is detrimental to the issue. When we justify something like this we say ""yes, your insecurity has a legitimate cause"" which ends up making the insecurity worse, because that's agreeing with the same narrative the person is dealing with internally. We need to approach it from the direction of perspective and *validation*, which is similar to justification, but not the same thing. Validation is acceptance that an experience is real (in this case, insecurity), but the focus is on the feeling, not determining legitimacy.

That's definitely true, but in fact mental illness can spark substance abuse, substance abuse can spark mental illness, and they feed on each other so both get worse.

Addiction is actually most closely related to PTSD, to an extent that 50% of people hospitalized for one or the other have *both.* Just for perspective, people who are traumatized have about a 10% chance of developing PTSD. For all people with substance abuse issues, that number jumps to 50%. PTSD qualifying events can even be a direct result of substance abuse, such as an accidental overdose.

The recovery processes for PTSD and substance abuse are almost completely identical, minus a handful of specific details. But since the patient is either already dealing with both sides or very much at risk of developing the other one, you can basically treat it simultaneously for the best effect.

So to answer the question, it's always what the dog actually does, not why they do it. Alert tasks are kind of self contained. So if you say medical alert, you've just described the exact task: anticipating and warning of an impending issue, which is why saying alert when the dog actually does response is bad. It's a lie. With response tasks, you have to a bit more descriptive because response is more of an umbrella term. Like, if your dog is trained to respond with pressure therapy, you say pressure therapy. Another common one is if a dog is trained to remove the handler from a stressful area, the handler can say guide work."

But if you just need help at home, task training a dog to respond to panic attacks is relatively easy with a basic understanding of dog training. Depending where you live, that may also be enough to give you legal protection within your home (again stressing that public access rights are different). Basically you want to choose a behavior. Cuddling, licking, pawing, doing a funny dance, whatever makes you feel better. Teach the dog to do it on command, probably either voice or hand signal. When the dog is consistently obedient, fake your symptoms whenever you ask for it. Eventually the dog learns to associate the behavior with your symptoms instead of needing a command."

dogswithjobs,fe9ch2x,t1_fe8qeix,1578936369.0,"With service animals, they have to be trained to do work or perform tasks to mitigate the handler's disability. In most situations you can pretty much lump all of that under ""tasks,"" but in truth there are legal distinctions that are sometimes critical, so sometimes handlers come off as a bit pedantic about these things. It's not as pedantic as it sounds, because from our position, language can be the difference between normal life and being denied access.

There are three broad categories of tasks. Work, which is something the dog does on command (example: retrieval). Alerts, which is when a dog monitors symptoms and gives the handler warning of an upcoming medical event (example: seizure alert several minutes before the seizure). And response, when the dog takes action to mitigate a medical event that is already taking place (example: grounding through panic attacks). In order for a task to be considered an alert, the dog has to know and communicate something the handler doesn't know. If the handler knows already but needs help, it's a response. Businesses can ask what tasks the dog is trained to perform. If you say your dog is medical alert when they actually do medical response, you have technically failed to answer the question and if the discrepancy is discovered, it can potentially result in the business removing your service animal. It's not likely, and could usually be resolved by correcting the misunderstanding, but it could still potentially create an unnecessary conflict.

You need to focus on two things to get started. Selecting a prospect and planning training. 

In order to minimize your wash chances, write out a curriculum. It's better to not be strict with timelines and such, but have a list of things you need to teach. Tasks, obedience, and socialization. Make sure to have a list before you get the dog. And remember it's more of a checklist than a script. You'll need to adapt to your dog's individual needs and maturity throughout training, but you can get a general game plan prepared in advance.

Selecting a prospect is also a major decision that drastically affects your wash rate. Play it as safe as possible. For first time handlers, I feel if your individual needs allow, stick with the fab 4. If the size is wrong or something, research other breeds thoroughly and make objective decisions based on need, not desire. But if the fab 4 can work for you, don't mess around with it, just use one of them. Your best chance is through a breeder who specializes in service lines. Make sure your puppy has been temperament tested. If at all possible, you should hire a behaviorist to test the dog independently. Good breeders who are familiar with SDs will usually be able to help with temperament testing if you can't get an independent opinion, but the results of a temperament test are inherently biased if the dog is familiar with the person testing them.

I'd try a correction and be careful with your body language. This is one of the areas where dogs interpret our signals completely differently. The human instinct is often to try pushing the dog away, but they see that as playful wrestling. You want to immediately disengage. Don't push back, just drop your arm to your side and stand very still. If you're walking, stop as suddenly as you can. If he continues to jump or bite, turn your back to him or back away one step. All your movements should be as stiff and abrupt as you can manage. This communicates in dog language that you are not having fun and don't want to play with him.

ptsd,fd5qkw2,t3_ek1zbw,1578180370.0,"Depends whether you're looking for an emotional support animal or a service animal. Most people don't realize there's a difference, or are misinformed about what the difference is.

An emotional support animal is a pet. Depending where you live, an ESA may be allowed in your home regardless of pet policies and/or be allowed in the cabin for commercial flights with a doctor's note. That's it. They aren't protected in public access situations like stores or restaurants, and they require no specific training whatsoever. They can be any species in most situations.

A service animal is a dog (or miniature horse, in the US) that is trained to mitigate their handler's disability. With PTSD animals, some examples of tasks would be alerting to people approaching from behind, anticipating and grounding through flashbacks, and nightmare interruption, to name a few. There are tons of potential tasks (thousands really), just depends what you need. Service animals are protected in public settings, although the specifics depend on relevant laws in the area.

If you're looking for an ESA, ask them for a cuddly dog and get one you bond with. Training doesn't matter beyond ensuring good behavior within your home. So you might ask if they have housebroken dogs or things like that that concern you about doing yourself.

If you're looking for a service dog, please visit r/service_dogs for information about choosing a prospect. Public access requires the dog to have the right temperament for the job and most dogs aren't suitable. Especially at shelters. It can work (my service dog is from a shelter) but I strongly recommend a breeder. Finding my boy in a shelter meant meeting approximately 500 dogs and temperament testing 12 promising dogs, 10 of which failed the test. If you go through a breeder, especially one who breeds service lines, you have a better chance of finding a dog with the right temperament and no baggage. Shelter dogs have usually seen some shit, and trauma messes dogs up too. A traumatized dog is unlikely to successfully complete training to be a service animal, or may need to retire suddenly if they're traumatized later on."

For one thing, there's this low-level fear all the time, whether it's walking through the house trusting that no one has left anything on the floor to trip over/moved the furniture even slightly, or random conflicts with strangers that you can't tell whether they're a real threat or just being loud. It takes longer to do things, and your loved ones have to learn to basically narrate your life, like telling you when the server at a restaurant has just set a drink next to your hand.

And then there's the way people treat you. It's often condescending or offensive, most commonly people talking over you like you're a toddler or a pet. Like the people who would ask my mom what my step dad needed rather than just asking him. Like ""does he need a straw"" or ""would he like someone to carry that for him."" And sometimes you'd get people who were downright crappy and took advantage of his blindness to try and steal from him, like telling him the bill he was handing them was smaller than it actually was.

ptsd,fcw6gm3,t3_ej1lub,1578018246.0,"Service animal laws vary depending where you live. In the US, it's under the Americans With Disabilities Act (ADA). I don't know as much about service animal laws elsewhere, but I'm reasonably well informed about US laws and know bits and pieces about some other countries' take on it if you have questions. Or you could check out r/service_dogs or r/servicedogs. Both subs' mods are pretty good at keeping information strictly accurate.  


Assuming you're in the US, the [ADA](https://www.ada.gov/regs2010/service_animal_qa.html) allows a disabled individual to be accompanied by a service dog or miniature horse trained to perform at least one task that mitigates the handler's disability. You mentioned some things your dogs do, like self harm interruption? That counts, but it does have to be trained. If it's something they do naturally, it doesn't count until it's been shaped. Shaping a natural response is a form of task training where you teach the dog to be consistent and reliable under any circumstances. If your dogs are task trained, that is enough to qualify them as service animals, but in practice, access rights are still contingent on the dog's behavior. So in addition to task training, you have to train the animal in public access so that they are not disruptive and will not pose a direct health or safety threat to the general public. Since you mentioned one of your dogs maintains a boundary for you, I want to warn you that protection trained dogs are disqualified by the Department of Justice. The definition of ""protection trained"" is kind of case by case, but in general it means that the dog cannot display obvious aggression and any history of trained bite work disqualifies them for life. So for maintaining your boundaries, it would have to be a 100% aggression-free barrier, such as walking around you in circles or standing between you and the other person, and there's still a lot that depends on your dog's specific behavior. I really recommend calling the Department of Justice about your specific situation.  


For bringing a service dog to [work](https://askjan.org/topics/servanim.cfm), it's still under the ADA, but a different title, so the rules are a bit different. Essentially your dog must be trained in adequate public access for your work setting, and can't cause the business undue hardship. Undue hardship is extremely subjective, but it would be stuff like safety concerns, exorbitant costs the business would have to pay to accommodate you (although a reasonable amount of money doesn't count), fundamental alteration that prevents the business from operating from the dog's mere existence, or something that would prevent you or your coworkers from doing your jobs. Assuming the dog is adequately trained, won't be in the way or in dangerous areas, and isn't compromising something fundamental to the business (for example a sterile environment in a hospital or a restaurant kitchen where even a well behaved dog is a risk), the employer can't legally refuse. But it's *extremely* subjective and it's probably wise to discuss specifics of your work environment with a lawyer or disability advocate."

None of that excuses cheating. There are much healthier ways to deal. Therapy or opening the relationship mutually could work if the husband is willing to work on it. If he isn't, then the problem goes beyond sex into whether both parties care about the other's happiness, and could potentially lead to divorce.

AnimalsBeingDerps,fcr8z2e,t1_fcptdt1,1577898506.0,"I really do think it's resource guarding, so in that case....It sounds counter intuitive at first, but the best way is to let the dog have the thing. But in a sort of round about way. The root cause is anxiety that they will lose access to something that they really want or need, so you have to approach it from the direction of reassuring them it's freely available. Trying to use discipline/negative reinforcement often makes them even more protective because it's telling them that you can and will take it away from them. So you let the dog feel they have their toy (or food or attention, also things they resource guard) and then redirect them so they give it up on their own. It's best to use a high value reward. What constitutes ""high value"" is subjective and varies from dog to dog, just whatever they like a lot. So a toy they like better than this one, or their favorite food, etc. Get their attention, have them voluntarily leave their guarded resource behind for the other one. And then when they've had their treat, give the first one back. Repeat basically forever. You cannot do it too many times, and this is a slow process of giving your dog more overall confidence. When not actively training, you should arrange things so that the dog feels no need to resource guard in the first place, so that it's always controlled. So don't give their food or toy unless you're willing and able to either leave them alone (and prevent other people/pets from bothering them) or use the opportunity to train."

Worst is the fear of dogs, as backwards as that sounds. But public situations are stressful for dogs and they need to be properly desensitized to them. Otherwise they might *seem* fine, but are actually running on a much lower stress tolerance than normal and are faster to display aggression. What that means for me is that most of the time I encounter someone else with a dog in public, their dog tries to attack mine. My service dog has been bitten twice this year alone, and we've avoided physical contact in three or four near attacks in the same time frame. But those matter too, especially given that he's actually been bitten before. He's having more and more trouble getting over his fear of dogs the more it happens, and it could potentially end his career. He's actually been off work since November because of a really close call around Halloween. I think he's almost ready to be back in public, but I've had to  go without medical assistance in the meantime, and might have to start over if it happens again. And it goes without saying that I and/or my service dog both could be seriously injured or even killed in a dog attack.  


Also the instant topic to talk about is a mixed bag. It's definitely given me more confidence talking to strangers, but now I have a completely different set of anxiety, because someone is going to stop me and want to chit chat every three seconds. Literally everything takes ten times longer with my service dog, unless I can avoid talking to people, but everyone wants to talk about my dog, and most of them will act like I'm the rude one if I don't stop what I'm doing and give them 30 seconds of my time.
