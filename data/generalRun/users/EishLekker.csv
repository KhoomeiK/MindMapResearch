nextfuckinglevel,ffkusnm,t1_ffktcr2,1580029296.0,In what country is the police not allowed to approach a suspicious acting person and ask him to explain his behavior?
ProgrammerHumor,ffkk684,t3_ettdp1,1580024121.0,"I once managed to sneak a code snippet like this into a base boolean util function that was called from all over the place:

    if (TEST_ENVIRONMENT && TODAY_IS_APRIL_FIRST && BEFORE_11_PM) {
        if (RANDOM < 0.01 || (RANDOM < 0.1 && AFTER_10_PM)) {
            return RANDOM_BOOLEAN;
        }
    }

So, the code returned a random boolean value instead of the expected value. But only in the test environment, and only on the morning on april first, and only \~1% of the time. But after 10 in the morning that increased to \~10% of the time, only to stop completely at 11 a'clock.

I don't remember all the details, but I remember my coworkers almost pulling their hair out trying to figure out why the deploy to the test environment suddenly resulted in some intermittent test errors. And then when a build was successful, the site started behaving strangely, with weird errors in random places.

I committed this code change as part of a big and legitimate refactoring several weeks before april first, making it almost impossible to find without knowing where to look. And who would think to look in a simple and reliable util method which has been working since the beginning of the project?

In order not to waste my coworkers time too much, and not to give them PTSD, I eventually volunteered to lead the troubleshooting effort. This was about 10:55 or so. At 11 I had made the problem magically go away."

ProgrammerHumor,fetgqi4,t1_fet5ilw,1579375257.0,">Do they seem to handle it fine, or are you just being endlessly marketed to and have become okay with it? 

They handle it fine. I just now browsed through a few different programming related sub reddits, and I didn't notice a single comment that seemed to be marketing. If you are so convinced that so many programming related forums have this problem, then maybe you could mention a few of them and give some concrete examples?

>The problem is that the answer may not be the best, because it's serving in the self-interest of the answerer. If you don't care about this, we can agree to disagree. 

I trust that the people reading the answers use some common sense when they try to judge if a specific answer/suggestion is right/valuable for them. And if some answer is obvious spam, then it can be flagged as such and handled appropriately. It seems that you view the SO users as fragile people who can't handle the opinions of other people, and who can't use their own judgement when deciding if an answer is valuable or not. If that is the case, then we most definitely might need to agree to disagree.

>it's by far the best resource for programmers, and many people use it multiple times a day

This can very well change in the future. You can't possible have missed that many people think SO is unfriendly and pedantic, right? And all the jokes about SO also is an interesting indication that it might not be as good of a site as some might think.

And for me personally, I am using it much less than before, and I have noticed a similar trend among coworkers and system developer friends.

>It's just not what the site is for. It's not about fear, it's just not the point of the site.

But this is what we are discussing. **Why** do you think it is good that it is not the point of the site to include/allow discussions?

Me personally think that SO could improve significantly, and making it a much more interesting and useful site, if it became less strict about discussions, opinions and external resources."
ProgrammerHumor,fet3e59,t1_fesys6o,1579371423.0,">Well, asking for a third-party resource invites spam more than asking a specific programming question because third-party resources, like books, libraries, or learning resources are often products that are for sale. So, if you ask: Where can I learn more about image processing? People can legitimately answer ""I learned from this site which has a 2 week trial.""

I still fail to see the big problem with that. Most forums seem to be able to handle that just fine.

>In other words, if someone asks ""what's the best site for learning Python?"", what could the summary be? 

A description of the site, a quick review how it works, what is good and what is bad, price information etc. Maybe accompanied with more links, containing reviews/discussions about that specific site.

>It can only be a link, and it's just not that useful of an answer in the long term.

1. Define ""long term""
2. Why is this ""long term"" so important? What is the real harm done if some answers contains dead links?
3. Isn't this view of the web (""all external links might die, and they might die very very soon!"") terribly pessimistic and negative?

>The goal of the site is to have Q&As that are useful for many, not just to help an individual self-study more effectively.

Why not allow both? What is the harm, really? You seem awfully afraid of so many things (external resources/links, content that might die, discussions...).

Any kind of forum invites spam. There are ways to handle it. And you never explained why the line should be drawn here, specifically.

>and once those links die... the answer is not useful. 

If the links can be summarized in a reasonable way (depending on context), then that should of course be expected. But most of the web can handle the possible future link death just fine, and ignoring content just because it **might** die some day in the future is just absurd."

Her expectations are irrelevant here. Only her actions. And if I interpreted the situation correctly, she actually did tell the hairdresser early on that she wants to avoid water in her face.
