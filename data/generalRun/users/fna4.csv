worldnews,ff7n81o,t1_ff79325,1579653588.0,Remember when one of r/the_donald’s big criticisms of Hillary was that she wouldn’t stand up to Saudi Arabia? They’ve been strangely silent about that lately.
todayilearned,ff4ltzp,t1_ff2qv5h,1579566733.0,"We can “both sides” everything, but this isn’t true. Look at which side of the aisle almost all hostility to any pro labor regulation or union organizing originates from..."

JusticeServed,ff2fnej,t3_er7e96,1579504120.0,"Not a real judge, not a real court. But, yeah."
ChoosingBeggars,ff2ffqj,t1_ff29uyv,1579503874.0,"You don’t have to stop them to report them... With that amount, that’s felony theft in most states. The police would certainly view security footage, interview employees, etc., and make an arrest."
trashy,fetr5vj,t1_feramu8,1579378703.0,I don’t know why this is getting downvoted. Most people in county jail are there awaiting trial.
trashy,fefmwew,t1_fefhz5i,1579059791.0,Yup.

PublicFreakout,fe5jb2l,t1_fe3uyre,1578870140.0,I just hope this doesn’t get used to push a narrative where we need to “liberate” Iran like we liberated Iraq...
LawSchool,fdx8ycb,t3_enang0,1578766435.0,"This is so tiring. People don’t want to work for judges they’re not ideologically aligned with, shocking. But I guess if it can get a few clicks from the “millennials are snowflakes” crowd, it must be fit to print..."
trashy,fdpa01c,t1_fdp8iwy,1578623472.0,Hard to take anyone that uses “pussy pass” as part of their vocabulary seriously.
WhitePeopleTwitter,fdk4ynr,t1_fdk1lry,1578496164.0,"Netenyahu wants war with Iran to distract from his scandals at home. Israel’s right wing has been fairly vocal about wanting confrontation with Iran. When I say Israel I mean the government, not people."
WhitePeopleTwitter,fdje7cx,t3_elmmy2,1578467108.0,"Don’t forget about Saudi Arabia, Israel, and the UAE. They’ve been trying to goad us into fighting Iran for them for a couple of decades now..."

MurderedByWords,fdd083g,t1_fdd00ji,1578289717.0,"It’s not about disliking people. It’s about how reddit oversimplifies things and reduces them to “Hollywood=bad!” “Keanu and Terry Crews=good!”. As this whole Terry Crews China debacle has shown, real life is more nuanced and complicated than whatever the prevailing narrative is on this website."
MurderedByWords,fdczufs,t1_fdczgsz,1578289344.0,So have other people in that room...

Columbus,fcofn4e,t1_fcodfel,1577831080.0,"You know there have been far more attacks by right wing extremists than refugees, right? Or does that not get posted on r/the_donald?"
Columbus,fcoffr9,t3_ei89ni,1577830939.0,"My hometown of Akron has greatly benefited from refugees. North Hill was pretty much a dead neighborhood before they settled here, now storefronts are getting filled and houses fixed up. Many of these refugees work two or three jobs, pay their taxes and are putting formerly vacant properties back on the property tax rolls. Our cities outside of Columbus have been hemorrhaging population for decades, this isn’t a bad thing."
trashy,fclcct7,t1_fcjrcfm,1577744547.0,"Just say no and move on. Asking is First Amendment protected speech, if they persist or do something illegal, then it becomes a law enforcement issue."

MurderedByWords,fcjl4s2,t3_egx0ro,1577692086.0,“No one will ever love you enough to pay you to sell fake miracle cures to right wing boomers.”  Isn’t really a murder by words.
TopMindsOfReddit,fcjif2q,t3_ehg003,1577688795.0,"Let me guess, in the his “hierarchy” being white, male, and right wing puts you on top? That’s the thing with a lot of these alt right incels, they’re so bad at life that they long for a time where being born white and male automatically put you ahead of women and minorities."

MurderedByWords,fcjb36e,t3_ehfcoe,1577681835.0,They should post that pic to r/the_donald and scroll through the comments. (Assuming this isn’t a Russian bot.)

Damnthatsinteresting,fc4w4sw,t1_fc4mq7v,1577430865.0,Anything that contradicts your ignorant little worldview is propaganda?
cigars,fc4vuyl,t1_fc4kwg3,1577430527.0,"Didn’t realize he was smoking the Cuban, so I retract my statement. That being said, I would not call the General produced non Cuban Sancho Panza cigars “total shit”. While ethical considerations regarding intellectual property and trademarks can be debated, the General Sancho Panza line is a solid line of value cigars."
coaxedintoasnafu,fc3dtah,t1_fc35pue,1577387584.0,"A lot of mainstream economists reject trickle down economics as an abject failure. Selectively citing statistics to confirm preformed prejudices without putting them into context is not “science” no matter how much the far right is obsessed with it. There is debate within the scientific community about genetics and IQ and regarding IQ tests being a reliable measure of intelligence. Acknowledging that debate, while hurting far right fee fees, is not the same as rejecting science. 

If you really care about science, wouldn’t president “I don’t understand wind” and his party rejecting climate change and embracing creationism offend you more than the aforementioned issues? You don’t care about science, you care about putting a semi legitimate veneer on far right bigotry."
