adderall,ff55x1i,t1_ff4yq0h,1579581140.0,I'd love to but unfortunately my insurance doesn't cover it.
Coffee,ff2krnq,t1_ff2jgt1,1579510709.0,Yeah.  I just buy gallon jugs of distilled water and you can buy a 15 pack of third wave on Amazon or your local roaster.
Coffee,ff1z87f,t1_ff1x4u3,1579489622.0,"This.  

Distilled plus third wave is the absolute best for home brew"
adderall,ff1bfyx,t3_eq9rfj,1579477145.0,"Here's my suggestion for 2-20mg IR.  Break them in half and take 10mg every 3-5/4 hours.  Much smoother, no peak, no crash"
GetStudying,ff1awfr,t1_ff0zncx,1579476928.0,Thank you I appreciate that
GetStudying,ff0va1v,t1_ff0md4u,1579472626.0,That came off rude I am sorry for that.  Rough day today.
GetStudying,ff0kgw5,t1_ff048wk,1579469721.0,It was a joke.  DELETED
GetStudying,fezos5s,t3_eqyp3l,1579459782.0,Adderall.
Reformed,fepbv7z,t3_eqa0b6,1579316727.0,"Logos outside of the desktop environment is not good.  At all.  The web app is tolerable I will say that.  But all the mobile apps I've tried, Android phone/tablet/Chromebook, lack severely.

I'm not even saying that they lack just because there are less features.  The web app and mobile apps are just buggy."
depression,feovot8,t3_eq6oqo,1579306417.0,"Yeah I have that feeling at least 5 nights a week.  I was doing good for a while too, was not dredding the next day so much.  But lately it's come back"
adderall,feobqr9,t1_fenyt1a,1579297808.0,That's definitely a possibility.  I've got a really good team of doctors that I'm working with now so I can definitely bring it up to them!
adderall,femvm2h,t1_femuoco,1579270786.0,Started this last night and will continue to do this.  Thanks!
adderall,femvlfi,t1_femumdp,1579270774.0,I think you are right!
Reformed,femn3qg,t3_epzkcj,1579263295.0,"When my wife and I were first dating, she was adamantly against reformed Theology.  I began to slowly work through them with her, point her towards resources, and made a list of all the false teaching Arminians she should stay away from!!!  Kidding of course.

But seriously.  She grew in her knowledge of Christ and has embraced reformed theology and has even helped other women grow in their knowledge also.

So yes.  To answer the original question."
adderall,femmpzs,t1_felzp82,1579262862.0,Great observation. Thank you!!
adderall,femmp9v,t1_fem4zt9,1579262841.0,3-4 months now
adderall,felzyz3,t1_felz2tx,1579235398.0,Thank you!  I was not aware of that.
theology,felkovn,t3_eppuko,1579224486.0,"I mean this in the nicest way possible: there's a podcast for everything.  If you have a desire to do a podcast, do it and do it better than anyone else.  Don't try to find that one podcast that nobody is doing but instead come up with an idea that you are passionate about and run with it."
adderall,felft84,t1_felfgmf,1579221162.0,"My biggest, I think, is that last statement you made.  I think about it all the time"
adderall,feldqw0,t1_felcmec,1579219785.0,I'm not quite at that point because I just went through a detox phase of one antidepressant and just started a new one today.  So I'd like to give this a few weeks before I make my final call.
adderall,feldl50,t1_feldbdd,1579219677.0,"No I was reading about that before I started taking it and I make sure that I avoid those things.  I also take Tums on occasion to ensure I'm good.  I also read that taking coQ10 and magnesium helps with absorption so I take those also.  And vitamin C to help with side effects.

I've taken it with food/without food.  I've even tried taking my morning dose and then having some caffeine a little later to try to get it to kick in and that also has proven ineffective."
adderall,felcyqx,t1_felckfq,1579219259.0,"That's what I thought also, and I expected there to be a grace period where it would be strange."
adderall,felch34,t1_felcarz,1579218933.0,I'm about 3 months in
adderall,felcgfs,t1_fela420,1579218922.0,I'm glad you understand where I'm coming from.  Because I feel like I'm crazy sometimes!
adderall,fel3xkx,t3_epcolq,1579213530.0,"I'll be honest.  For me it seriously feels like it changes day by day.  Some days this combo seems to work - other days I notice no improvement at all.  

I'm currently on 30mg IR and 30mg XR.  I take the IR when I wake up (530am), normally just a half.  Then around 1pm I take my XR.  Then when I'm home around 5 I will usually take the other half of my IR.

When I go back to the doctor the end of this month I will probably go back on 2-30mg IR per day and take a half at a time, 4 times a day"
depression,fel3kh2,t3_enh309,1579213305.0,"So I take antidepressants and Adderall.  The Adderall is not my antidepressant.  I can't even imagine my doctor saying to me ""take this Adderall it will help your mood."" 

I've been on 6 different combos of Adderall since I started and not once have I noticed a day of mood improvement."
depression,fecexjd,t3_eo8lps,1578972294.0,"....you use the term ""actually"" to describe your mood to your wife.  ""Actually I DO feel ok today."""
adderall,fe9spia,t3_enhl54,1578941141.0,"I have noticed there are times that I take my afternoon dose and around the 1 hour mark I crash and have to power through it.

As far as the euphoria, not everyone experiences it and to be honest if you DO experience it, it's only going to happen for the first few times you take it.  After that, if you are on the right side, you shouldn't really ""feel"" anything."
adderall,fe9s84i,t3_eo6fmt,1578940986.0,"Current setup: 30mg IR in the morning (530am) and 30mg XR around 1ish.

What I will probably change to: Split the IR in half and take a half when I first wake up, the XR around 1, and then the other half of my IR around 4.

My day is pretty long so I'm trying to figure out the best combo."
depression,fe9m295,t1_fe9jwub,1578939346.0,"Thank you I appreciate the post.  It seems as though my detox phase is over and tomorrow I should begin my new meds.  I did a med test to find out what will work for me because Pristiq, Wellbutrin, and Lexapro (all max doses and various combos) have not worked for me.  Results should be back already and my doctor is speaking with me tomorrow about it."
depression,fe2bbps,t1_fdvw9cy,1578836479.0,Typed up a post and deleted it.  But you just explained exactly what I was trying to communicate.
adderall,fdt4rn4,t3_emt5mt,1578711908.0,"Here's my journey.  I'm 37 and was diagnosed finally 4 months ago.

Started with 1-15xr.  Nothing.
Then went to 2-15xr.  Nothing.
Then went to 2-30mgIR.  Too many gaps in my day where the med was completely gone.
Then went to 2-30mg XR.  Better.  But morning does seemed to be super ineffective.
Currently on 1-30IR and 1-30xr.  

What I'm doing now is to split the IR and take half when I wake up at 530 for work and then I take one around 10.  I take my afternoon around 2.

To be honest, I had three days this week where I took just the IRs.  I split them up and took 4 halves throughout the day.  That is the best setup and I will probably change to that."
ElgatoGaming,fdnltun,t1_fdlo29q,1578588489.0,That article is very old.  But thanks!
productivity,fddw8mi,t1_fddjgrc,1578325506.0,Ok sounds good.  If you are comfortable with sharing the one you have with your information I'd take that.  If not I understand and I will make one from scratch.  Thank you!!!
productivity,fdd5lco,t1_fdd5k5o,1578295791.0,I believe so.  I know I can embed a PDF.  I am just wondering how it will look when I convert it over to Notion.
productivity,fdcwkqn,t1_fd9vrpi,1578286414.0,Would you mind sharing this excel template?
productivity,fcy4xdl,t3_ejg4lr,1578074852.0,This is BEAUTIFUL.  I'd love to export this into Notion
NotionSo,fcy46kd,t1_fcx22ln,1578074457.0,I have a note 10+
productivity,fbdqopc,t1_faobj4k,1576769131.0,"I'd love to learn more about this, sounds like something that would help me greatly."
