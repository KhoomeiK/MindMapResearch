It is only through being that organized and having the details that well worked out in advance that you can pull off the subtle foreshadowing and overall cohesion that he has managed.

While his prose is not the most beautiful thing I've ever read, he more than makes up for that with his everything else.  I completely agree that once he pulls this series off, he will have accomplished the most impressive feat in at least  all of Urban Fantasy, and maybe Fantasy overall.  This is Cantebury Tales level badassery- If Chaucer had lived long enough to finish.

And he pulled this off, all the while writing TWO OTHER BESTSELLING SERIES!!!  Butcher is, to quote Hunter S Thompson, ""A high powered mutant of some kind, never even considered for mass production.  Too weird to live, and too rare to die."""

dresdenfiles,ffg2ge7,t1_fffbef8,1579897015.0,">I'm not wrong. Harry said the beat was getting higher pitched with each passing moment, and that meant it was coming closer.

Well, actually.....

If a steady beat has remained the same pitch begins to change, it is  because, a) someone is purposefully modulating it- Unlikely in this case, or B) it has started to move.

If you and the beat are static relative to one another, then the Relative  acceleration is 0.  No Doppler Effect.

As soon as the beat generating object begins to move in any direction, the Relative Acceleration between you is no longer 0.  So if the acceleration is sufficient in magnitude you will get a perceptible Doppler Effect.

If the sound generating object began moving away, it would sound lower. If it was moving towards you, it would sound as though it were getting higher.

So, when Harry thinks:

>""Traffic hissed by in an automotive river on the highway.  Sirens sounded in the distance, ambulance rather than patrol car.  Somewhere within a two-hundred mile radius one of those enormous, thumping bass stereos pounded out a **steady beat almost too low to hear**.

followed by:

>""That heavy bass stereo kept rumbling through the October night.  I paused for a second, focusing on the sound.  **It was changing, getting a little bit higher pitched with each beat**.  I recognized what that meant, and panic slammed through my head for a second.  Doppler effect.  The source of the rumbling bass was coming towards us.

He is 100% correct.  The relative acceleration between he and a formerly static sound generating object changed.  And as he experienced that change as an increase in pitch, the car is moving towards him.

So yeah, he was correct in his description, and you were technically wrong.

Edit:

Also, ""cruising speed?""  In a parking lot?  When you are speeding towards someone you want to murder?  No such thing.  You are accelerating til you get to them and slam on the brakes."
dresdenfiles,ffg01hz,t1_ffdq668,1579895530.0,"And of course he is going to accelerate.  He wants to murder Harry to death.

Liver Spots is almost certainly tasked by Grevane with being a second line of defense in case Butters happens to slip out.  So, he is probably parked someplace that he can see both Butters' truck and the door.

Then he sees Harry, the guy he wants to murder most in all the world walk out.  Even if Cassius is sort of cruising around the parking lot, (which would draw a lot of attention and not make much sense), he is certainly going to speed up as he heads towards Harry.  So even if Cassius happened to be driving around, and happened to be heading directly towards Harry, his pace would still increase- causing the Doppler effect.

So yeah, I am struggling with the confusion everyone seems to be having."

dresdenfiles,ffd8juh,t1_ffd6ei4,1579815515.0,"I mention this in my comment too, but there is a solid chance that Cassius was stopped  when Harry first heard the beat, and then accelerated towards him bent on murder upon seeing he and Butters approach Butters' truck."
dresdenfiles,ffd87rh,t3_esz2ec,1579815322.0,"I think maybe the explanation Harry gives does fit though.

Harry hears the thump of the bass as soon as they get out of the Forensic Institute.  It is only once they get to Butters' destroyed truck that the pitch starts to go up.

So, Cassius was chilling in the car with the beat playing for Grevane's zombies, and simultaneously watching Butters' truck in case Harry and Butters get by Grevane.

He sees Harry and Buttters, and guns the engine accelerating towards them.

Accelerating towards Harry **from a full stop** would make the sound of the bass seem to increase in pitch.  Particularly if it some big old piece of overpowered iron that goes from 0-60 in not much.  If Cassius had headed away, the pitch would have seemed to get lower."

From everything we know, if Harry lost the Gem, he wouldn't be able to do the Way mojo any more.  That is a significant difference relevant to OP's question, I think.

Additionally, if you look at Lea's exact words, you can make an argument that Maggie Sr's ""skill"" in predicting ways is separate from her knowledge of where they are now. I'm not sure Harry gets that skill except by practice and experience.

We know from Luccio's experience in Dead Beat that when a person shifts bodies, they can't necessarily do all of the things they used to be able to.  Some of that is strength, and some of it seems to be that certain bodies have certain predilections magically speaking.

So, if Luccio lost some of her abilities in a body swap that was accompanied by her consciousness, how much more would be lost in simply trying to transfer knowledge bereft of the intellect that organized it?

I am fairly sure a baller of a wizard could encode all the information about magic she had  in a construct like Bob, or a gem like Maggie Sr. did for Harry.   In both of the scenarios, you have a consciousness acting as sort of a go between- almost like a PDF reader to decode the information.  But I think that the transferred Magical information would only be accessible by query as in those scenarios; not as integrated knowledge.

Harry's gem seems closer to the intellectus that Demonreach offers Harry, only containing knowledge limited to the Ways, and narrated by his mom.

I disagree with this.

When she gives Dresden options for how the duel will be fought, Ivy offers armed combat as one of the options.  Even threatening someone with a weapon is using that weapon, and armed combat was expressly not selected as the way the duel would proceed.

If your interpretation was accurate, Ortega wouldn't even have to hide the gun.  He could pull it out and aim it at Harry as much as he wants, so long as he doesn't fire it.

Ivy also gives specific instructions as to how the duel is to be fought.  She specifies where folks should stand, how they should interact with the Mordite, and what constitutes a win.  Those instructions are the express limitations of the duel in my opinion.  Anything even remotely construed as an aggressive act outside of those strictures would violate the rules and result in instadeath I think.  Assuming that act was perceived by Ivy or Kincaid."
dresdenfiles,felgdcl,t3_epr6om,1579221540.0,"Ivy didn't know who cheated first.

She asked Kincaid who violated the sanctity of the duel, and Kincaid didn't know.  It looked bad for Harry, because Ortega got shot first so far as anyone could see.  But since Dresden was winning at the time, Ivy assumed he would have little reason to cheat.  She also didn't see Ortega pull his arm out of his skin suit and grab the gun. So in the absence of clear evidence of treachery by either side its a wash as far as Ivy is concerned. 

Now, if Ortega ever wrote down anywhere that he was the one who cheated first, Ivy would know.  And then she would squish him.

Lea and Harry discus that it was clear that HWWB was trying to shape Harry into an enforcer for Dumorne.  Probably Dumorne picked him due to his birthday and the Starborn elements associated with it, just as he did Elaine.

So, if Justin used an Outsider to try to steer Harry towards magical violence as Lea says in Ghost Story, why would HWWB allow himself to be used that way?  As you mention, all the Outsiders work together, so it must have been that Harry, as a bad ass Magical Law breaking enforcer for Justin furthers the cause of the Outsiders.  So, either Justin was working for Team Outside, or corrupting Harry would have helped Team Outside irrespective of what Justin planned.  We don't have enough info to say which I don't think.

When that doesn't work, Team Outside makes a few more efforts in that direction.

It seems that you've had conversations, and he's aware of your distaste for the word, but please recognize that he will probably slip up and do it again, because in his mind it's a compliment.

I am not sure if this is your intent, but it sounds like you are telling her to change the way she reacts to a word someone is using to describe her, rather than expecting the person using that word to change his vernacular.  

That is the advice women have gotten forever about how to deal with being made uncomfortable by men, and I think it is a bad idea.  It's a bad idea in its own right, because it leaves her trying to adjust her emotions to preserve her boyfriend's convenience.  It also sets a bad precedent, because it shows that she is willing to tolerate what makes her uncomfortable to avoid rocking the boat. 

We are responsible for the care and feeding of our own boundaries, male or female, and it is a bad idea to let people make us feel small.  Whatever their intentions.

OP, I think taking Murphy's perspective on this is awesome.  As much as Murphy is physically small, she doesn't let anyone make her feel that way emotionally.  She is strong, powerful, and kick ass.  Good on ya."
AmItheAsshole,fdoou8o,t1_fdooc1x,1578609569.0,"Well, maybe.  But if there is a responsible adult in that family system, then they ought to frame it as a lesson for the kid about how not to act in public.  I hope that is what happened.

Failing that though, OP's right to use the library > Bratty kid/Inept mom's right to be annoying there.  And OP tried to be decent about it.  

Still a firm NTA IMHO."
AmItheAsshole,fdoohnj,t1_fdonlth,1578609357.0,"If, as OP did, I make an honest effort to calmly get someone to leave me alone, and they don't, then I am entitled to gradually escalate my response until they do.  That absolutely doesn't make me an asshole.

If at first contact from a kid at the library I yell and tell the child to get away from me, then yeah, I'm an asshole. 

But after repeated pro social attempts to be left alone, I don't then think I am an asshole if I react in a direct, or even a verbally aggressive fashion.  What makes you an asshole during interaction 1 and what makes you an asshole 15 minutes later at interaction 4 or 5 are two quite different things in my estimation."
AmItheAsshole,fdoiri8,t1_fdohehw,1578605978.0,"I can't picture a world where a child is standing in front of me annoying me and I can't make that situation go away on my own.  I don't need official help.  I wouldn't even need to raise my voice.  I'm also possessed of a certain stimulus value that tends to make people listen to me the first time.  That's a privilege not everyone has.

I want to point out that I am not being sarcastic here, or trying to draw you into an argument.  I legitimately think that establishing for folks, particularly children, that ignoring social norms has uncomfortable social consequences is really valuable.  Natural consequences are a thing, and I firmly believe that this kid needed some.

The kid has learned that it is not ok to annoy strangers at the library.  The kid has learned that it is ok for women to assert their boundaries, even if he or she (meaning the kid) really wants to connect and relate.  In short, the kid learns that other humans have agency and a right to decide what they want to or don't want to tolerate.  That is the bedrock to a lot of important and more advanced lessons. 

As for your question, what if the kid didn't leave: Well, the only way i can see that going down is if Mom gets involved, and comes over and starts yelling at OP or something.  I would argue that if that is where the situation is going, then getting library personnel involved only changes the focus of Mom's (in that case utterly dysfunctional), ire onto some library clerk making minimum wage.  Because let's face it, it isn't gonna be the administrator with the MA in library science that comes out to deal with the groundlings.  So yeah, I would argue that is OP's to deal with.  If it escalates beyond that, then take appropriate measures, whatever those are dependent on the situation.  I am not going to let my concern about someone else's hysterics limit my boundary maintenance though. 

So, as that is the case, I am quite comfortable setting my own boundries.  As should OP be.  If a few more folks did this, maybe mom and kid would take a lesson from it."

There is not need for this.  People sometimes need perspective from un-involved folks in high stakes emotional situations, even when the facts of the matter are clear to see.  

Don't be a jerk."
