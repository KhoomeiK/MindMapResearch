Type out what you want to say and sit on it. Or better yet, get to a point while texting where you share secrets and just blurt it all out, don’t think twice about it.

Do you see him after the 10 days is up? Maybe tell him after the 10 days is up. That way, IF you do get rejected, you don’t get a daily reminder of it. But even if you do see him after, you should be proud that you made a move and it just didn’t work out. Prepare for the worst, hope for the best.
