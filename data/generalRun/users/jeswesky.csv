aww,fgswwa2,t1_fgswid8,1581094342.0,"I love mals, but my [lab/pit](https://imgur.com/gallery/fmRWLnn) guy is enough work for this point in my life.  2 mile walk before I leave for work and 1.5 - 2 hours at the dog park after work, and another 2-3 mile walk before bed.  Thankfully, he is perfectly content to chill at home while I'm at work, as long as he gets enough attention/activity once I'm home.  He is quite literally my entire focus outside of work right now though.  Hoping it calms down a bit as he gets older and is neutered, he is only 19 months right now."

The President actually questioned if free coffee should still be a thing since it would cost more now.

Mine has gotten a hold of chocolate a couple times (he's a counter surfer on occasion) and the first time I called my vet to see if I needed to do anything.  It was probably the equivalent of a snack sized bag of m&m's and she said just to watch him for vomiting and lethargy and bring him in if that happened.  He was about 50 pounds at the time and no issues."
fosterdogs,ffxj0y6,t1_ffwb4t2,1580326120.0,"You need to get in touch with an actual rescue organization.  I see you posted this in multiple subs, and in one of those comments you said there weren't any rescues in your area because you live in the country a bit.  Many rescues have resources well outside of their immediate area.  Reach out to a vet in your area, a vet school, a pet store, or a shelter.  They will help put you into contact with a rescue group that operates in your area or that has contacts in your area.  

Unless you have experience and funds for dealing with puppies, especially ones that may have medical issues, you should be going through a rescue group.  You say they have worms, but unless you mean intestinal worms which show up in poop you really would have no way of knowing that.  They will need to be screened for heartworms, which are the real problem ones.  

I commend that you want to help these puppies, and a rescue group would probably love that you want to foster!  They will make sure your home is a good and safe environment for the puppies, however.  Feel free to reach out with a more specific location (at least the state) if you want assistance in finding a rescue group."

badwomensanatomy,ff6lasj,t1_ff6hr25,1579629624.0,Victoria's Secret is horrible at sizing.  Especially anything above the normal sizes they carry.  If they tell you that you are a cup size they don't carry they can't make a sale.

bestoflegaladvice,fe9wcio,t1_fe9iarc,1578942025.0,Depends on if they are trying to break threw clothing or not and how tough your skin is. I’ve known a couple people that have ended up with bloody ankles at the dog park from chihuahuas.
bestoflegaladvice,fe9vpdq,t1_fe92iki,1578941825.0,My boy is about 70 pounds and has developed a fun little method of waking me at night if he needs to go out. He normally just whines or bumps my hand to tell me to go out but if that doesn’t wake me he slaps me across the face with his paw. Thankfully no bruises or scars from that yet!
bestoflegaladvice,fe9uuvu,t1_fe94sc6,1578941674.0,"That is actually the case with many large breed dogs, especially once they do the bite and shake. 

I was bit by a poodle/doodle type dog over the summer at the dog park. It wanted to hump my dog and my dog didn’t want to be humped so he ran off and was chilling by me. The other dog got pissed and ran over trying to bite him but got my hand instead. Thankfully my dog let out a growl I’ve never heard before or since and the other dog let go immediately. If it would have had time to do the shake it would have resulted in quite a bit of damage.  It was a major bite with a lot of blood so I did end up at the ER that day. Unfortunately the owners left immediately and I wasn’t able to get any info so public health recommended the rabies series."

It snowed and we were the first ones there on Saturday, so when they popped up it was pretty obvious.    He had a blast running around chasing them, but got really sad when he tried to bat at them and ended up killing them.  I had to chuck a few over the fence so he wouldn't try to eat them."
