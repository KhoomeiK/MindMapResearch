anhedonia,ffg0sb2,t1_fffvqfc,1579895984.0,"I have had a concussion.  I was about 7 or 8 and hit head to head with another kid while we were running back in forth in different directions in a gym.  He was an older kid.  I passed out (can't remember for how long exactly) maybe 10-20 minutes.  I have a lump on my head that I think was caused by that but I can't be sure.  Anyway, I think that may have something (if not a lot) to do with my memory loss."
anhedonia,fffu8qy,t1_ffftump,1579891912.0,Thanks for the reply.  I haven't tried methylphenidate but it's something I'm interested in.  I just started pramipexole yesterday and there are some studies that say it can help with anhedonia.  But you have to take a small dose and slowly increase it over 5 weeks before getting up to a dose that might do anything so it will be a while before I know if it helps.
anhedonia,ffflvu6,t1_fffle2i,1579886775.0,"Thanks, I'll look into it."
anhedonia,fffkkyj,t1_fffk0xw,1579885978.0,"I can watch a movie or TV show and often I can't remember the names of the characters even before it's over let alone afterwards.  Sometimes I try to force myself to focus on the names or I will ask another person who's watching it with me what a particular character's name is.  I think that has been annoying to them some of the time, not sure.  I've also tried writing down the names of people I meet in real life to help but I might not ever look at the lists again or still forget their names when I see them out in public or whatever.  This condition is somewhat debilitating as it causes me to have social anxiety and to avoid social situations and interpersonal contact.  Like, if I see someone I know, I might walk in another direction to avoid the interaction."
StackAdvice,ffa2ndk,t1_ff9rj6e,1579726659.0,"Yes, I've been taking the Lion's Mane and NAC which seem to help me have fewer ruminating negative thoughts which uplifts me somewhat.  But, really, so far I can't say they've alleviated my anhedonia.  I don't have any interest in anything except trying to research into what may help alleviate this anhedonia.  There's so much information and more than a few conflicting reports that, at the moment, I feel overwhelmed by it all.  If I could have feelings I'd say I'm desperate.  But, really I'm mostly despondent if anything which isn't really much like an emotion.  It's like an anti-emotion."
StackAdvice,ff9nkui,t1_ff9j8m4,1579716741.0,"So far, it seems that Lion's Mane and NAC make a little bit of a difference."
anhedonia,ff9ndjs,t1_ff9jwnm,1579716621.0,I haven't tried Kratom or Tianeptine.  I've seen a lot of people talk about getting hooked on Kratom but I am still thinking about it if other things don't work.  Tianeptine is not available in the U.S. but it looks like it might be good for anhedonia.
anhedonia,ff9mv1v,t1_ff9i9oz,1579716315.0,"Thanks.  I'm taking lamictal, just started about 3 weeks ago and just went up from 25mg to 50mg a week ago.  I've read that you have to take 100mg for an effective dose.  I'm not sure if it's helping with anything yet or not.  Did you mean pramipexole?  I see my doctor tomorrow and she said she would start me on that then.  I've read good things about it and anhedonia so I'm hopeful that it may help."
StackAdvice,ff9ib7c,t3_eryw6i,1579713621.0,"I have had lifelong anhedonia.  Within the last two months I learned of the importance of dopamine in the brain's reward system and I have been trying to sort out the question of what will help.  I haven't reached any conclusions but you can look at my research here.  I think it might help you figure something out and I'd love any feedback.  I also made a post in r/anhedonia about this.

anhedonia,ff9gsxd,t1_ff9byxg,1579712700.0,"My anhedonia is complete anhedonia at this point.  When I was younger I could enjoy listening to music but I didn't enjoy anything else.  I never experienced happiness in anything that other people seem to: birthday parties, Christmas, the beach, graduations, going out with friends, relationships, parades, carnivals, festivals, concerts.  I would always be standing there thinking: ""What's wrong with me?  Why do I feel nothing?""  I had to fake enjoyment during these times because I didn't want to look weird or whatever.  I used to tell myself that I wasn't happy or able to enjoy anything because I had some stressor that I was dealing with, usually schoolwork at first then, later on, actual occupational work. I've come to realize that this wasn't the case and that, in fact, whatever has caused me to not enjoy normally fun events/moments has to do with my brain.  I have always lacked pleasure and I have always been emotionally blunted.  This started when I very young, like maybe 4 years old.  Also, I've had trichotillomania since about the age of 4.  I believe the pathophysiology of anhedonia and trichotillomania, in my case, are related.  Essentially, some disregulation of my brain's chemistry and the way it functions.  Oh, and I experienced severe migraine headaches for most of my life: starting when I was about 12 and peaking in my 30s.  I still get them but only about once every few months now.  I think the cause of the migraines is likely related in all of this as well.  I didn't know about the importance of dopamine in all of this until about the last two months.  My experimentation with the supplements on my list has, thus far, allowed me a few days where my negative ruminating seems to have been reduced but, as of yet, I'm not sure exactly which supplements have been providing the benefit.  I suspect Lion's Mane has helped and NAC, but I couldn't swear by it at this point.  I've only been trying these things in the last 4-5 weeks and I take some one day and others the next.  It's possible that there has been a synergistic effect from many of them at this point.  I'm trying to sort it out and pinpoint which ones seem to produce the best effects.  In my document, if there is a question mark after the supplement on the list at the top of the document it means I haven't yet tried that supplement and am still trying to decide whether to get some to try.  As you can imagine, I've already spent a good deal amount of money in a short time just on the supplements I'm currently trying out so, naturally, I'm hesitant to buy new ones at this point."
anhedonia,ff95h1b,t1_ff8pthd,1579705300.0,I've tried that in the past but the consequences always caught up with me.  In a perfect world where they were legal and available I'm almost certain I could put together a regimen that would allow me to live an enjoyable life.  If only.
anhedonia,ff74sz7,t3_eqp082,1579641129.0,I've had anhedonia my whole life.  No medication has ever helped or supplements.  Weed used to help some but it's not something I have access to any more.
anhedonia,ff74mml,t3_erycxp,1579641027.0,I know how you feel.  Nothing gets my interest any more.  About the only thing I can bring myself to do is listen to Terence McKenna on YouTube and read reddit.  It doesn't seem like much of a life anymore.
depression,ff1ua4h,t3_eqy6qi,1579486333.0,Your Dopamine (reward) System gets crushed between the planks and the mud and you lose the ability to feel pleasure and the desire to seek it.  SSRIs are poison.
depression,fezg8gw,t1_fexaf8t,1579457009.0,Sounds like you have anhedonia.  Might want to check out the r/anhedonia and r/Anhedonia_Recovery subs.
anhedonia,fezfj4x,t3_eqy8oz,1579456831.0,I have anhedonia.  Never experienced pleasure in anything really except music when I was growing up but I don't listen to music anymore.  I have no interest in anything.  I've always been uncomfortable around people.  I don't know what to say and have a hard time following conversations.  I can't figure out why people talk about most of the things they do.  Everything just seems uninteresting.  I also have a constant headache.
depression,feupzfh,t3_eqjb2e,1579388908.0,It sounds like you have anhedonia.  I have it also.  It's terrible.  No interest in anything.  There's an anhedonia subreddit you might want to look through.
anhedonia,fer4mlr,t1_feptfpp,1579349726.0,"I don't know if people who developed anhedonia because of meds (or something else) can expect that it might go away.  I'd like to think that's possible just as I'd like to think that it is possible for someone (like me) with lifelong anhedonia that it might go away with the right response to it.  But, at 46, after trying a lot of things I'm not too optimistic about this."
anhedonia,feofj2b,t1_feobw11,1579299495.0,"Here's an interesting article: 

 ""The STAR\*D trial, which was funded by the NIMH, provides evidence of  how, in our modern SSRI era, depression runs a very chronic course. Once  [Ed Pigott and others](http://www.madinamerica.com/madinamerica.com/Whitakerblog/AB2C14EA-2955-45ED-B5D3-F2FE28F3BD61.html)  carefully parsed the STAR\*D data, it became known that only 108 of the  4041 patients who entered the trial remitted, and then stayed well and  in the trial during the yearlong follow-up. All of the other patients  either failed to remit, relapsed, or dropped out.""

anhedonia,feobw11,t3_eoezhe,1579297895.0,"Yep, me too.  There's definitely something not right about SSRI's.  I've seen a lot of other people giving similar reports and there are some studies in the last few years that seem to indicate the medical community is coming to this understanding also."
anhedonia,feobl8o,t3_eq5x1w,1579297740.0,Me too.  I smoke out of habit but never get anything out of it.  I used to but not any more.  I ask myself every day why I'm still trying.  I guess I'm just hoping to get something out of it every time.  It's strange.
Anhedonia_Recovery,fenk2i7,t3_eq4fe4,1579286377.0,"I  know this is a wild guess and may be off for reasons someone else may  know of.  However, if this probiotic can, as the study suggests, effect  the gut biome in a way that can ultimately lead to removing whatever it  is that is damaging to dopamine and if dopamine is involved in the  reward pathways in the brain then might this probiotic be (in theory)  helpful to those of us who suffer from anhedonia which, apparently, is  thought be (if only in part) a result of dysregulation of or some  deficiency in the dopamine pathways in the pleasure centers of our  brains?  Wondering if anyone has any thoughts on this."
anhedonia,fend2ku,t1_fenbj3m,1579282095.0,"A ""lifelong anhedonia"" sub might be useful."
anhedonia,fencz91,t1_fenceqz,1579282039.0,"Exactly, it's like there's some natural skill that people have that I'm missing.  I've tried to watch sports so that I could talk about the game the next day or whatever and I can't even remember what happened in the game.  Sometimes I can't even remember who won.  Also, I've always had trouble learning and remembering names of co-workers, classmates, etc.  Even when the circumstances would seem to indicated that remembering their names should be second nature or come automatically.  It has always made me really nervous."
anhedonia,fenby9z,t1_fenall0,1579281408.0,"Thank you for your message.  Weed has helped me a little bit but I don't have access to it now, unfortunately.  I've had ADHD also.  I was never able to participate in conversations.  I never understood them really.  I can't figure out why people talk about the things they do.  Most people seem content with random chit-chat.  I've always struggled to follow conversations because of the ADHD I suspect.  So, all interpersonal situations have been weird for me.  Like I'm in a cloud that I can barely see through or ""act"" through.  I've had to force myself in those situations and always looked for an excuse to leave the situations.  I used to stay home alone and organize my stuff, like obsessively.  I felt that my head was disordered because my personal space was disordered.  I have that up about 7 years ago when I was around 39 years old.  I realized that was just an ineffective coping mechanism.  My doctor is supposed to start me on Pramipexole next week.  There are a few studies (not man) that seem to indicate that it might be helpful.  Fingers Crossed."
anhedonia,fen857l,t3_eps0jj,1579279064.0,Me too.  Listening to music was about the only thing I consistently liked to do and I'm a point where I don't listen to any.  I've had anhedonia my whole life with music being about the only thing that used to consistently get my attention.  It's weird.
