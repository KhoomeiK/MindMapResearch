Arkansas,ffr0lgh,t3_euofa8,1580147823.0,">“It is noteworthy that the State of Arkansas is being recognized again for excellence in providing digital government content,” said Governor Hutchinson. “Since my first day in office in 2015, I’ve made computer science education a top priority of my administration. To help bolster this initiative, our state took the lead by demonstrating technological advancement in the delivery of services to our constituents. These awards are further proof that Arkansas is on the right path in the 21st century digital age.”

While this is nice, computer science has little to do with digital design, which is what these awards are for. The awards cover the content that is on the websites, not the technology behind the websites.

> The W³ Awards celebrates digital excellence by honoring outstanding websites, web marketing, video, mobile sites and apps, and social content created by some of the best interactive agencies, designers and creators worldwide. The W³ Awards received over 5,000 entries from advertising agencies, PR firms, interactive agencies, in-house creative professionals, web designers, graphic designers and web enthusiasts. With nearly 3,000 entries from across the U.S. and around the world, the Davey Awards honors the finest creative work from the best small shops, firms and companies worldwide."

$41,0000 with standard deduction of $24,000 = $17,000 <---- This is our taxable income for the year

$17,000 x 10% for joint filing tax rate = $1700 <----- This is our taxes paid for the year
