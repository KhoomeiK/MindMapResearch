dogs,ffbau61,t1_ffaidp1,1579757845.0,"That was over a decade ago. She's almost at the end. I cherish everyday with her. 
She spent most of her life living with no fences on a lake. Free fed because her weight was stable at a great weight for her. The vet said she could use a few more pounds. When I told her she free fed and knew how to let me know the bowl was empty. She just exercised the calories off. We're both showing and putting on a few. But we're happy"
dogs,ffaha63,t3_esiihy,1579735714.0,"I was in the hospital for 3 month when my dog was just over a year old. She was with my neighbor whose dog was her best friend and their other dogs. They did everything, including taking her across to my house for feedings. She still refused to eat for 3 weeks. Adding wet food, treats, nothing worked. 
She didn't eat more than what she needed to survive the rest of the time I was away. 
When I was finally released, her spine, ribs and hips were all prominent. 
It took me months to get her back to a healthy weight. A week or two shouldn't be troublesome. I would message the owner and ask for advice and keep them informed if possible"

dogs,fexxx34,t3_eqsz63,1579438115.0,"I used one extensively when we were on 100+acres. Never shocked her. To her it was a beep collar. The only command it portrayed was come. Got an expensive one with 3 mile range. 
Trained first on lead, then longer distance. But she was excellent on recall before I used it."

dogs,fed3lva,t3_eoivvr,1578997121.0,"Your anxiety is known to him. You bring anxious is fueling it in him. You need to find an answer quickly or it'll become a self fulfilling prophecy. 
I see it in owners when fireworks are coming soon. My girl wants to look because it's cool and she's enjoyed it. Her first time she was nervous. I didn't coddle her. I have her her spot to sit and watch, distracted her when the novelty made her nervous and put her back in her spot. Then we played when it was over. She knows playtime will come after. Same with gunfire and even a potato gun. She's even taken to retrieving the potatoes, but only after getting the release to fetch word. 
It's all in your handling of the situation."

dogs,fe1r7rl,t3_en8fej,1578829940.0,"Before I got my dog I chastised and told off one breeder whose contract was similar. My girl is always getting compliments on how well behaved and what a good girl she is.
I had the time and energy and knowledge to train her impeccably myself. I remained in contact for 5+years with her breeder and he commented occasionally how she did everything right like she just knew. She did. I taught her. 
I would find another breeder. 
Just my opinion."
