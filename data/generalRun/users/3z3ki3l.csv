Uh. You're not an atheist if you believe in a higher or supernatural power. Those are inherently exclusive.

>Some atheists are also atheist and satanist but we just keep it to ourselves.

I don't think so. I think some satanists like to say they're atheists. Either because they need some semblance of reason for their beliefs beyond their pointless hatred of a christian god, or because they just don't understand what atheism is.

&#x200B;

>I just wanted to come here for support and advice.

You're getting advice from people who don't believe in any god or force beyond reality. We're going to tell you the realistic way to deal with it if you feel her beliefs are fictitious; **don't make trouble with family when you don't need to.** But if you're a satanist then you have a lot more common ground with your grandma to discuss.
