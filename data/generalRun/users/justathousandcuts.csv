shoppingaddiction,fegi7e1,t3_eozd6c,1579093560.0,"cooking maybe? once you really learn the basics and get comfortable with cooking it's really enjoyable. I find it so relaxing to just put on a disney movie (or one you've seen a bunch of time)  in the background and cook to relax... 

i also highly recommend cleaning as you go too because it sucks 10x more to do it after you're done cooking."
MUAontheCheap,fedifzi,t3_eogook,1579012349.0,This is such a great deal. I just wish it was paired with the original cc
BeautyBoxes,fe5ix2m,t3_enig78,1578870056.0,i checked around the 1st and it came out to $15. i held off on purchasing and tried again a week later and the $5 applied automatically for me. this was on their direct site too.

BeautyBoxes,fdm98h9,t1_fdm8osj,1578542972.0,"Weird. When I checked out I remember they promptly displayed the caudalie new member gift as what would be in my box. 

I know a few days ago I tried checking out and it showed as $15 before I hit confirm. That’s why I thought for some reason this new year they decided to forgo the $5 off new promo"
BeautyBoxes,fdkpf48,t1_fdkk26f,1578508400.0,I just checked out. There’s no promo code or anything. The system should recognize if you are a subscriber or not and the promo just automatically gets applied to it.
MUAontheCheap,fdkbk3g,t1_fdkbi36,1578500401.0,There is no promo code. Just check out and the system will know if you have a current subscription with them or not.
PanPorn,fdj1iie,t1_fdj15wj,1578456041.0,Thanks for the rec but I like the spf/color correcting aspect of this particular product! I have some redness but not enough that can’t be covered up by light concealing but I like the idea of a multi step product that I can just slap on and go.

BeautyBoxes,fddm143,t3_ekojs3,1578317335.0,You can do it online. I don’t understand the perpetuating hate for allure. It was so easy for me. I just went into my account and logged in and clicked cancel.

MUAontheCheap,fdcilrf,t1_fdchhwe,1578275812.0,Personally I am hesitant to support a brand that heavily and predatorily markets and sells diet/detox teas to vulnerable people.
BeautyBoxes,fdciblz,t1_fdci5op,1578275613.0,Ah ok gotcha. Wasn’t sure if you thought they were coming with the lucky bag promo so just wanted to clarify it. I thought that until I realized you’re getting the same value of what you’re paying so for me it’s kinda pointless if I get stuck with something I know I don’t like. I’d rather just pick my own items haha
BeautyBoxes,fdc8sx2,t1_fdbhidl,1578269349.0,Just an FYI they’re going to be travel sizes. So if you’re purchasing for the aesthetic it’s not the FS packaging

syndey calling her her mini me isn't really an indicator of anything. I've called other girls (as well as others) my mini me if they just share the same personality traits, interests as me. Nothing to do with race."

thebachelor,fd23pmw,t1_fcztgp1,1578141201.0,no... i think you were wrong in this situation dude. and judging by your downvotes I think others and I agree. you should probably really take your own advice.. your attempt at self righteousness failed and you really look like the asshole here.

Your sad attempt to be self righteous with your bizzare lover thread fail and isn't fooling anyone judging by the downvotes you got and the mods removing your comments. And then to follow them into a different sub and thread is really quite sad. Why can't YOU admit you were wrong and just give up when clearly no one is agreeing with you. YOU were the one that got all your comments removed and locked. Mods locked your post up because it was disgusting.  Give it up. You're pathetic."
AsianBeauty,fcx8g1p,t3_ejax9w,1578055357.0,"i have oily af skin and my skin loves it. I use it as a toner and apply the rest of my routine afterwards and it sinks in nicely and sits well under sunscreen and makeup.   
I don't think this product works really well by itself or to replace moisturizer. my skin loves it for the hydration and i find it works best if you have it work with other products"
BeautyBoxes,fcx7rcd,t3_eja7tn,1578054633.0,allure by far is my favorite. they have a lot of skincare as well but honestly I just like to know what im getting so if I don't like it I have the option to opt out. I don't like how other boxes play roulette with you and are shady and bait and switch you. also allure sends out a good amount of full size products for how little you pay and a lot of their stuff is well known brand so that's what I love about them.

Makeup,fcuo2bb,t3_ej0qo3,1577985087.0,i find it helps to cut them into thirds. that way you don't have to worry about the inner corners or outside popping off. it should also help you place the lashes closer to the real lash line since they are more manageable now

\^\^    
also, as you mentioned in another comment, their UX isn't poorly designed. links to policies are always down at the very bottom or off to the side if there is a side bar. It took me less than 15 seconds to find, most of it was just waiting for the page to load, and then clicked on customer service and saw a very transparent policy on everything you need to know about doing business with them."
AsianBeauty,fcs22jn,t1_fcs1buq,1577910259.0,"Generally look for faq, return/ shipping/ customer service pages. Not every merchant organizes their pages the same but it’s always somewhere there. It really took me less than 30 seconds to find and read through. Especially if it’s an online merchant I want to know the return window so I know how long I have to try it before returning if there are issues. They can’t fit everything on the product page. It’s just part of being diligent as a consumer and taking a few seconds to inform yourself on their policies and making an informed decision on whether or not this merchant is for you. They are within their rights to offer only store credit. But I don’t think it’s necessary to be presumptuous and frame it like you got scammed or they were trying to trick you. But now you know for next time! 🤗"
AsianBeauty,fcry37b,t1_fcrxrzt,1577908200.0,"Really? Lmao. It’s really not that hard. Every merchant has a faq, shipping and return policy page. It’s really not that hard to find. Usually it’s on the bottom of the webpage. Pretty quite standard.

Since you can’t be bothered to go look yourself, it’s under their customer service section. Hardly sneaky.

AsianBeauty,fcrxu1l,t1_fcrx19r,1577908104.0,"If you’re old enough to shop online you should at least check out their shipping/return policy before placing an order. Complaining about not getting your money back is ridiculous when their return policy is on their website. Not every merchants offer full refunds. That’s nothing new or bizarre. But to PSA about it like they tried to screw you or something if it’s already on their website is really unnecessary. It’s really not that hard. 

And thanks for being presumptuous but I’m a girl. Thanks. 😊"
AsianBeauty,fcrufen,t3_eikky0,1577906754.0,"Or just read their return policy like a responsible consumer before placing an order. 🤷🏻‍♀️

Yes go ahead and downvote me. But honestly as a consumer you can’t feign ignorance when their policy is written in their FAQ/customer service page. Hardly sneaky or scammy. Just do your due diligence and at least check out that info. It’s really not that hard. Took me less than 30 seconds to find and read."

traderjoes,fco0c2x,t3_ei7lau,1577821793.0,"im not terrible knowlegable about wines but just keep exploring and find what you like. typically anything between $8-25 is a good range to go to. Not too cheap, not expensive either.

I also was told from a wine expert to look for some more established wineries/brands for more ""bang for your buck"". A lot of the new wineries are still paying off start up costs which of course gets passed off to the consumer."

traderjoes,fcj5h5d,t3_ehfcji,1577677752.0,"Trader Joe’s always ends up being more expensive for me. Maybe each individual item isn’t expensive compared to regular supermarkets but I find I buy a lot of snacks, frozen foods and specialty treats that I normally wouldn’t buy at my grocery store. Usually I just stick to produce and a thing or two of processed items, but for traders I end up going the complete opposite route."
