AdviceAnimals,ffesb34,t1_ffcomps,1579863136.0," Well that's because we are ignoring other variables. It's over simplifying to completely different things so they can seem compatible. In the real world an organ transfer is not always successful and for vital organs usually only gives a decade (again varies but I'm averaging) of a somewhat livable life. In the trolley situation those other 5 will be able to live their lives to the fullest. 

There's also the fact that the trolley incident would be a freak accident and a choice you'd have to make in a split second so simple math makes sense too use, because you don't have time to fully investigate the situation. Organ transfer is not even close to that.

Nope, it is illegal for collections to charge you more than the cost of the bill. This is why medical bills have now started to go the 'resale' market, in which people buy medical debt for pennies on the dollar and try to get the owners of the debt to pay.

It's also worth noting that depending on your state, your debt can only stay for so long. You can not keep a debt for say... 30 years. Unless it's a government debt (taxes, child support, etc). Companies can not squeeze you for decades.

Consumers absolutely have some power in these areas. Credit will be tanked but credit is losing it's value at an increasingly high rate. The money you save on loans for having a 750 credit score compared to a 600 credit score is stupidly small."

The strong still rule over the weak, except now the weak might be able to scare off a strong person every now and then by pretending to be Joker. The weak still can't beat up the strong just because they wear a mask, and moreover everyone is learning that 99% of Jokers are fakes. In all reality, if Joker was going to attack you, you wouldn't get away anyway, so everyone at Welston is just going to fight the fake Joker's and the system will go back to 'base' where the strong can do what they want and people weaker than them will listen.

It's also worth noting that the school does still have rules that are enforced by the principle and staff. Literally everyone John has done hasn't changed the system much, and definitely not for the worse. Fake Jokers can't do anything. A fake Joker attacking Sera would have attacked her anyway, because she felt she was stronger than her. Any weaker person that dressed as Fake Joker and tried to 'fight' a stronger person, is just trying to scare the stronger person, which is limited to small period of effective time for reasons I already stated. 

Now, will the author think of all this with the on going story? I fucking doubt it, a lot slips by and I wouldn't say the actions of some people are realistic, but as for where the story is right now, John's actions have no real affect on the school. All the high rankers like to pretend that everything is crazy now, but shit is the same as ever.

Source for this? I've seen absolutely nothing near those numbers. The closest documented number was 90% of Massachusetts Bay Indians dying to a small pox epidemic. 

There's another statistic (with little evidence) thrown around that 'Old World' diseases killed from 90-95% of East Coast Native Americans. This was a multitude of diseases, not just small pox.

In terms of places with recorded history, Europeans had ~30% death rate for small pox in adults (80% in children). Hard to say if Europeans had really built up an immunity or not, especially since small pox did spread over the east coast Indians over decades, arguably a century."

unOrdinary,fe6m0bk,t1_fe6kvbm,1578895439.0,">First, on the surface it may not appear to be might, but in our world, cunning is as good as a superpower. How else would you explain people like Hitler and Stalin coming to power? Were they the smartest? No. Were they the most ruthless and most cunning? Yes. We can agree to disagree on this point.

They were charismatic and very smart. They also had luck and timing. Might requires very little luck or timing to be at the top. More over, might is singular. There are many things that can lead you to the top of whatever profession you choose, but no 1 thing that can lead you to the top of any profession. That is not a might is right situation, since more than 1 thing can lead you to the top.

>Second, that's a republic. We live in a republic. Republic is literally the definition of rich rule. Every elected official can be lobbied which is a fancy term for bribed or bought. The Roman Republic which our Republic is based on was literally a fuck the poor construct. This lasted for centuries until the 60s BC when it was then divided amongst the three most powerful with the Senate being there on paper. Then when Crassus died in 56 BC, Pompey and Caesar fought and lead to the mightiest of the three surviving and although he did not rule Rome, his grand nephew, also the most cunning of his own period, became emperor. Only reason we have not seen such happen is because no single person or group of people are powerful enough. You can say this is because checks and balances exist, but I say the Romans thought that as well, and eventually it all came undone. In my opinion, cunning and ruthlessness are basically superpowers.

While your history lesson is fun, it's exactly that, history. We are at worst considered a democratic republic. However, since definition evolve over time and become more broad, we absolutely fall into a representative democracy. Just because we can fall under the definition of a republic doesn't somehow mean we couldn't also be a democracy. Our government is far too complicated to try and classify us as one or the other, and they were smart to do so because we want the best functioning government, not the best definition of a certain type of government. [Article that explains the situation more in depth.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/volokh-conspiracy/wp/2015/05/13/is-the-united-states-of-america-a-republic-or-a-democracy/)

Also, a republic is not the definition of rich rule. It's entirely decided by how the republic is built. 

While you're free to your opinion, both cunning and ruthlessness can be beaten, depending on what the final goal is. No one is topping their particular field of science with cunning and ruthlessness because you need to be smart and creative to make large progression. Two of the smartest scientist known (Newton and Einstein) were neither cunning nor ruthless."

Everything in the Unordinary universe is ruled by ability strength.

Second, democracy is not majority ruled. That's the whole point of the Senate, which is 2 senators per state, regardless of population. Bills have to pass both the House (majority influenced) and the Senate (not majority influenced) to be passed, and even then the President has the veto (also not majority).

In the first 3 seasons you might have some scenes that looked like filler for a few episodes but then would be shown to have an effect later on in the season."

I will say, season 4 was not nearly as good as the previous seasons. It was full of basically filler, with very little even having to do with the main plot. Shoot, you could argue that there was nothing done with the main plot across the whole season."

People really don't eat that fast like this thread is acting, and I'd say most outings are still close to an hour long, much longer if drinking gets involved."
