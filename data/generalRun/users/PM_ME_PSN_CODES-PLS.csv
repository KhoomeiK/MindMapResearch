Futurology,fcpc0zo,t1_fco0awl,1577857737.0,">I was comparing the cost of ships to rail, and I think that the costs would be similar if they were using the same fuel source.

They would be, assuming you calculate cost per mile.

However transport by ship is cheapest overall by distance covered. Hence they pollute more than any other form of transportation.

Mostly because the international waters cover most transit distance.

The problem being that bunker fuel is cheaper than normal Diesel fuel. 

You can't cover the oceans by railroad, and transport by air is too expensive. The reason we as consumers get cheap shit from overseas is by transport overseas. 

The sad reality is, that we as consumers will not choose the expensive local produce over cheap oversea import. 

Untill we can produce locally and more importantly: advertise products cheaper from local manufacturers, we will continue to use imported products.

We need a local market of cheaper supply to meet our local consumer demand for change to happen. Which requires government intervention as weird as it may sound.

And before someone digs into my post history, i do support that thought even though I work in the oil industry.

This test has been around for a while and they haven't found an actual biomarker for Fibromyalgia yet.

The test essentially helps rule out other diseases, but doesn't see the difference between a healthy individual without pain or a person diagnosed with Fibromyalgia.

Fibromyalgia cannot be diagnosed without process of elimination of other diseases such as Rheumatoid Arthritis, Lupus etc. Similar to how IBS is diagnosed. The poster above you claiming to be in the top 10 percentile probably misunderstood the meaning of the percentages. They can't test how bad your fibromyalgia is in percentile, because pain can not be measured and is subjective to the person being tested.

Chemokines and Cytokenes are not markers for Fibromyalgia. High amounts of these cells have been linked to people with Fibromyalgia but there is no evidence that they affect/cause each other.

So while i too was very excited about the test, it wasn't so promising anymore after a bit of research :( guess we'll have to wait around a bit longer.
