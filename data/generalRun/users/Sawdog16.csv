I feel like I am extremely weak when it comes to dealing with withdrawals, but I was able to taper from 25gpd in November to 0gpd a few days ago almost painlessly. I’m not saying that to brag, I just want you to know that it can be done, and you can do it!!! 

Just take it one day at a time, try each day to do a little better than the day before.  If you have setbacks, don’t dwell on them. If you continue to try to do better every day, the victories will outweigh the setbacks. 

I’m not even sure any of this is helpful, but hang in there.  

It will get better. You will get better!"
