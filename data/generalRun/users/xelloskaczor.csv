worldnews,fe3aq4x,t1_fdzuchj,1578847598.0,"Well, let me tell you few things. 

First of all, world is not either black or white in most of the cases. Its either mix of those, or greys, depending on your view. Noone is ever completely one thing. 

Sure. PiS has social programs. Thats completely true. Their big flagship program is called 500+. Its basically free 500 PLN (i think 120$? but its actually much more than 120 bucks would be in america coz of economy stuff noone cares about) for every child u have. Per month. That's the very general way to put it. It also guarantees that sum to some of the old people and disabled too.

You could think, man. What a left wing move. Take the money from the rich by taxing them and redistribute the ""wealth"" to the poor. They need it! Is what liberal might say. Liberal would be correct, at least to some degree i dont want to argue the politics here, if thats how it worked. But its not. PiS straight up does not have the money to sustain this program and their answer to how to get it is to PRINT MORE OF IT. 

Their interest lie only in the illusion of giving people help, while completely disregarding long, or even medium term consequences. Its a device, like many other politics of theirs, to essentially blackmail people in order to get reelected. Im not going to bother explaining basic problems of just printing more money, i am however going to say that this strategy worked, and 4-5 months after their reelection for next 4 years in government, they already are talking about dropping the whole policy anyways. 

Just giving shit to people is not what liberals do, it's what morons do. Because once inflation fucks everyone, its the poor people that will suffer the most again. Its not a leftwing policy, its a gangster policy. 

At the same time its an extremely conservative party. To the pathological degree. They hate european union, they hate immigrants, they are verifiably misogynistic, nationalist, xenophobic, authoritarian, racist and on surface extremely religious. 

Now some might say that's purely conservative, and you can be left wing conservative. It's probably not wrong way to look at it. And btw i dont mean it in twitter SJW way. I mean it as PiS politics are on record last year saying that people in africa must be black because of their dirty shit water, or that women cant possibly be allowed to ever have an abortion because its a crime to let a child die without being christened. Mother should understand that and give her life for her childs happiness afterlife. That last one, thats our ruling party's leader words btw. 

However PiS is ALSO anti free media, anti free speech, anti democracy in general, they dont seem to have much of an interest in actually controlling the market in any real compacity, they aim to lower taxes, and the taxes they raise affect mostly poor people which is why they are forced out of their silly social policies to begin with. 

What im saying here is that they are power hungry decietful conservatives and everything they do ""for the people"" is actually designed to sustain their seats in the government. It's not left wing, its not right wing either, it's asshole wing. But things they actually cause to happen, and they do it on purpouse regardless if they give a shit or not, lean the country towards the right wing of things."

Difference is that on many planets that much tech is common. Which raises the question wouldnt those planets also have genius scientists and martial arts experts to even more easily become supervillains and heroes? Both Marvel and DC say yes thats what happens but since avengers universe didnt adress it yet, it seems not to be the case.

Also please dont label anyone who is for socialist programs a communist. They are ex communist but poland was never truly behind communism ideology. People who ruled under that system were just opportunistic assholes that would thrive under any system, russia just happened to force on us this one. Them being ex communist has nothing to do with their politics. It just has to do with them being evil and greedy people. The reason PiS or Law and Justice if you prefer is doing it has nothing to do with ideology. Their social programs exist purely and only to get them reelected. They literally hold poor people hostage, saying see all those benefits, those will go away if you dont reelect us. 

Before last election in fall 2019 they made big point to remind people of that, and yet again they won.

As well as has pretty strongly worded passages in their holy book about not letting any jews live.
