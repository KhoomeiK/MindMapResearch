offmychest,fe6vq3r,t1_fe6g99l,1578906240.0,Love this! Thanks for reminding me to do the same and all the best to you reneefongg
offmychest,fe6k64s,t1_fe638y4,1578893566.0,"Your ""friends"" sound horrendous. They did not care about you. I'm glad you distanced yourself. Sounds like you were their *supply* urgh Some cliques get stupid and very nasty just to prove a point. Nothing wrong with you, altogether just the wrong combination of people. I'm hopeful their clique will self-destruct because that is nasty dark ages bullshit behaviour no one needs"
offmychest,fe6jlu9,t1_fe65i4b,1578893019.0,I'm sorry you have experienced such things. Every one has their tipping point.

offmychest,fcoqv8c,t3_ehzwpe,1577839127.0,"I can also relate. My ex was emotionally verbally financially abusive and a cheating meth head. Sometime into the ""relationship"" I started to see glimpses of what he was really like, but I was very naive and vulnerable, I don't have the capacity to truly understand manipulative people like him. 
Well, I fell pregnant and he caused me a huge amount of headache, and pain. He caused me to have a full-fledged break. Bad bad stuff.
I must've been 5-6 months pregnant with our son, and he would start these nonsensical fights with me.
One day he threatened to hang himself Infront of me. It was not like me, but I called his bluff in a pretty cold way. Nothing happened. He sulked for a while. Think he came inside later, snotted, but doing the ""make up"" talk. 
He used to yell and scream at me so bad I would vomit. He did everything he could to drive me to madness. I vomitted in my pregnancy because of him being horrible, Gaslighting etc.
Fast forward a few years and I am incredibly thankful that we split and he could get back to his deranged gameplaying elsewhere. I'm a single mum, my boy is so lovely. I feel so sad for my son that the pregnancy was torture for us both and I believe it has left scars on him too. It's not fair to my baby is what makes me angry.
His father left, whatever, piece of shit, glad it's over. He has no contact - he chose that. We're cool with it. Honestly, a child doesn't need a parent when the sperm donor is completely incapable of love. Literally.

Thanks so much for sharing OP. Very important message to get out there, and I'm very proud of you for doing so x"
