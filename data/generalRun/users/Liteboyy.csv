Smite,ffhbctn,t3_etl2y4,1579928727.0,"At that point in the game, it’s all up to decision making, team comp, and RTS. 

Me personally, I like to get emperors early on in my build to allow diving or defending and enhance/stop a snowball. Usually when pros get it, it’s like 5/6th item and they’re sieging or defending. Outside of that it’s not like we really *need* more items that mess with PvE aspects. 

But I would like to see abilities that affect objectives. For example in LoL, there’s a support that can basically freeze *anything* for a couple seconds and they are completely immune to everything. That includes freezing towers. 

Another champ has an ultimate that when it’s placed (picture isis ult) nothing in it can die and I mean nothing. There was an insane comeback at 2016 MSI where they used that ult to prevent the FG equivalent from dying, to then steal it and win the game. 

Another champ can put up a temporary tower in the place of where a tower *was* but no longer is there. Of course it’s weaker than a real tower. 

Would love to see stuff like that in smite."

DnD,ffe5cui,t1_ffe58da,1579837119.0,Yeah I’m planning on creating 8 different arms and have him roll a D8 to see what arm he gets from Azuth. Was also considering a pro/con to each arm.
DMAcademy,ffe55vr,t1_ffe4t1k,1579836974.0,"I was thinking of a pro and con sort of Situation for the arm, like if it’s made of iron it would be a more damaging unarmored strike, but disadvantage on anything dextrous etc. 

The rest of the party members will also be receiving an equivalent experience, I only stated he was my best friend to emphasize more on the safety of him losing a limb, as he trusts me and we aren’t strangers to each other. As a DM I tend to give out magic items a little more frequently than others."
DnD,ffe4thn,t1_ffe4bai,1579836717.0,"Oh no, almost right after the loss of limb he would be regaining a new one. I landed on Azuth the God of Wizards, appearing before him and in exchange for his devotion, give him a new arm."

DnD,ffdxfln,t1_ffdpphd,1579831325.0,"Not sure if you’re familiar with Hoard of the Dragon Queen, but at the end of the first Episode, an enemy challenges the party and dares someone to step up for a 1v1. Instead of daring I was thinking of him calling out x player, and then during the fight taking his arm. 

That would end episode 1 and the following episodes plot is for them to go to that enemy’s base. They will encounter that same enemy who mutilated him again. 

Is the end of chapter 1 too early? Should I wait for them to go to the enemy hideout and *then* have him lose the arm??"

Smite,ff40jm0,t1_ff3xwt7,1579552903.0,"If winning isn’t an incentive then enlighten me as to why people play ranked?? Outside of the very obvious people set out to ruin someone else’s fun, people play ranked for a more serious environment because they want to *win*. If you need an “incentive” to try and win outside of climbing ranked and promoting, you’re either a toxic person to begin with, or strictly playing for fun and in that case are more suited to casual modes."
Smite,ff3vynw,t1_ff3ur7o,1579550043.0,Winning and promoting higher in ranked is the incentive. If that isn’t enough then a few gems isn’t changing anything. While it isn’t gambling it still doesn’t make a whole lot of sense. “Put in gems and only get rewards for winning” really means ‘okay well the game isn’t going how I want and nothing changes if we lose so I’ll just be toxic cuz I’m upset.’
Smite,ff3ufv9,t3_erhjks,1579549093.0,"Putting into the pot and then not losing anything, in no way fixes toxicity. It only creates “incentive” to win which is already there. Making absolutely no incentive to not be toxic because they lose nothing when losing the game. Nice effort but I’m not seeing how this fixes or improves anything other than gambling gems."
Smite,ff3rb8n,t1_ff3ojsz,1579547165.0,"Yeah because he has little to no CC. He has a slow and a partial “blind” if you will. So it’s hard to get in, lock down, and then get out after killing. So he excels more from Solo where he can build tankier and just get on the backline and stay there."
Smite,ff3mq6t,t3_ergyp5,1579544355.0,"He was prevalent as a solo laner because his sustain matched King Arthur’s along with high base damage. Try not to teleport to a clone as initiation unless the kill is guaranteed. The ideal scenario is blink in and save teleport to chase them when they dash/leap or to get out for survival. 

His passive comes into play like how you want it to, during his ult. Your ult is for chasing or matching sustain. Wait for multiple spawns I see lots of sets trigger happy with the one but it’s just overall more beneficial to wait for 2+ clones to send, usually."

Smite,fewicz3,t1_few2fkp,1579411131.0,One thing you’re not mentioning is the bans are blind and can be dupes. In LoL each side bans 5 gods at once and *then* they go through ordered picks. It’s not uncommon to see 2 aphelios or yasuo bans etc. which I would not like to see in smite. Our P/B phase is actually more strategic than LoL’s when it comes to ranked.
