Both civilians and military are totally dependant on GPS and satellite communications (can't fly high tech planes anymore without it!). 

As soon as warfare targets those satellites, an awful lot of problems are going to arise for a lot of people, and you'll notice that comes under 'military activities within space' so the treaty doesn't protect anyone. The benefit it no one's worked out how to get around the problems it'd raise for their own countries too yet so its a dormant threat rather than an active one."
MaliciousCompliance,ffbe2xa,t3_eskio3,1579761370.0,"Pre 9/11, in a non-American airport, my dad was an early instigator of RFIDs and was flying to a city for a conference with our defence force. He had with him a bag of (bright blue) tagged sample weapons. Carry on. The security folk pulled him aside, opened his bag and asked ""what are these?"" to which he replied ""grenades!“

They let him on the flight"

memes,fefrocr,t1_feaka5i,1579063212.0,"Yes, we do need it that much. The defence estates are barely holding together and most of our capabilities were built pre-ww2. Without the investment, we were getting seriously close to not being able to fulfil outputs. And the Nzdf is not primarily a fighting force. Its training, capabilities and mission are focused on maintaining NZs EEZ, HADR and Pacific assistance.

Source? Work for them and live in a crumbling (but okay!) barrack block because governments scrape away defence budget to satisfy public impressions like this and there's almost zero spare money for estate maintenance"

Before the quake I used to run hella early before school and I stopped for a few months. The day I restarted, I'd just reached the top of my hill and paused completely out of breath. It was a little before 6am so almost pitch black, I could just make out the dark tips of the trees around me.

If I hadn't been staring at the trees I wouldnt have seen it, but all at once every bird in the area took flight in total silence. It was like the trees themselves had just lifted away. I knew what was going to happen but it was still terrifying in that predawn quiet when the earth groaned underneath me and the biggest shake we'd had in a while hit. It was some dantes peak type shit and I sprinted home and spent the rest of the morning in my parents bed. Never ran in the mornings again"
