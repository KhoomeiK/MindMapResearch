I realize as we grow older, we have less and less time to see each other as we are busy with jobs and other important business. I remember when we were still all small kiddos and now there’s only a few cousins left to reach their 20s. We had our ups and downs this past year but we all managed to pull through and get together at the last second. We’ve all lost members but also gained new additions to the family. Nothing lasts forever so enjoy every moment of it! Happy Holidays and have a great a new year!"
