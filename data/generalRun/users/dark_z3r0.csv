houkai3rd,fecqyb5,t1_fecnbn2,1578981334.0,">Those are not the same characters, there is at least 50.000 years between them, you could call it reincarnation but not ressurection, they are not back, they are a completly different entity.

Except Yae Rin, and, Kevin Kaslana, and probably the whole Grey Serpent network, then there's the case of Fu Hua and the legend of the Phoenix. And I also said, clones, genetically shared bodies, ETC. so I think I got the reincarnated part covered.

Anyway, the whole point is that it's not outside the theme of Honkai Impact. And it's not exactly bad writing considering that other more prominent series uses similar plot devices, like Dune, The Dark Tower, etc.

>Clones sure, go for it, because that point is no longer himeko, just like that welt clone was not him and theresa while is a clone of kallen is not her.

It's funny since the game is currently exploring this very concept...again. They did it first with K-423, and now they did it with Yae Kasumi. And with the help of some magic/technology, they transferred Sirin's consciousness to K-423 and planned to do the same to Kasumi.

Welt Young is not exactly a clone but a fragment of Welt Joyce's ego. 

If you played Theresa's origin story, you'd know that Otto commented that Theresa is the closest he's got to reviving Kallen and that she might have hold Kallen's soul. Again, commenting on the general theme of Honkai about death and resurrection.

>They take over but do not kill the human personality, if that was the case kiana would not become herself as she did.

If you read the manga, there's a pseudo-herrscher that Theresa faced. The storytelling went into detail how the honkai will attacks the human's insecurities and weaknesses, slowly corrupting and weakening their will, and then totally taking over.

Kiana was almost lost, buried deep within the K-423 body. She was then brought back because Himeko used a Honkai suppression drug on her, and that chance, along with Fu Hua's help, allowed her to fight back the honkai will within.

There are also other instances where the host literally dies. Yae Rin from the previous era died first before turning in the Herrscher of Corruption.

However, I meant ""killing the human consciousness"" in a more metaphorical statement, as the host giving in to the honkai will gives up all of their memories, emotions, personality, and literally all mental faculties, might as well be considered death."

houkai3rd,fecj9o6,t1_fecgocm,1578975261.0,"Generally speaking, it's not a ""whole can of worms for the plot"", because as I stated in this post, the plot is literally riddled with resurrected characters, clones, genetically shared bodies, etc, and they're not venturing to new territory.

Specifically speaking, there's still a lot of mystery surrounding Fu Hua's Fenghuan down Divine Key, with the only bit of info about it that is that her consciousness is alive in K-423 Kiana while her body was last seen to be held by Otto at Shamash gun point . The real Kiana is also in Otto's hands. 

Herrscher take over is also detailed in the lore and one of its requirements is to totally kill the human consciousness of the body it's taking over. Himeko could come back with no recollection of anyone, like what happened to Wendy, which is again follows what has been established and is using a method in writing called a ""Chekhov's gun"".

In any case, all of this does not introduce any new elements or even stray away far from the general theme of the series."

houkai3rd,fec8otq,t1_febyjz2,1578968603.0,"The lore is full of supposedly long dead people coming back to life/resurrected. 

TLDR: Himeko is the Herrscher of Destruction and she or a form of her will return one way or another.

SPOILERS AHEAD! I don't fucking know how to spoiler tag on mobile

LAST FUCKING WARNING

Dr. Mei from the previous era

Yae Sakura as a Fire Moth from the previous era

Yae Rin as the Herrscher of Corruption from the previous era

And most relevant in this discussion's context is the HIMEKO Herrscher of Destruction, also from the previous era.

HI3 is also rife with friends turning into enemies either due to the corruption of the Herrscher or the Schicksal/Anti Entrophy feud

Black Nucleus Bronya

Wendy Herrscher of the Wind

Fu Hua as Otto's spy

Rita as another spy

And again, Himeko being corrupted by Xuan Yan sword

Also, there's supposed to be 14 Herrschers in all and we are only at around 4-5 right now

Welt - Herrscher of Reason (not sure about the name)

Mei - Herrscher of Lightning

Wendy - Herrscher of the Wind

Kiana - Herrscher of the Void

Hellmaru - Herrscher of Corruption, or at least the Honkai will without a vessel

HoR Bronya doesn't count because she's just using Welt's core, Gem of Logic (forgot the name)

Himeko is also wearing a Divine Key, the Key of Blankness, in the form of the Vermillion Knight armor, embedded with the Flame gem. The VK armor supposedly absorbs whatever Honkai energy is nearby. It turned into a flame affinity armor because of the gem, though the armor can be of whatever the embedded gem's affinity is.

Himeko has the Flame Gem. And I doubt the lore will just write off something as important as the Herrscher cores.

What I'm saying is the lore and the precedence is there and everything is setup for the Queen's blazing return.

HIMEKO is coming back as the Flame wielder, Herrscher of Destruction and Kiana has to face her again."
