depression,fekpcrq,t1_fekolfk,1579204827.0,"Hmmm, I wasn’t talking about you but if I’m not mistaken another commenter said “Jesus doesn’t exist fuck off with your pretentious bullshit”.
Which he very well may not be, but it just seemed petty to attack that part of their comment.

That being said I definitely understand why you felt they were being somewhat manipulative and pretentious. 

Furthermore I shouldn’t have responded to that response and instead should have put it on the original comment since yours didn’t have to do with what I was saying.

Also happy birthday btw"
