In my current group (not browser based, but also not a game) one team has started using a protocol based on HTTP/2 to get some of these benefits. It isn't just stateless any more.

NoStupidQuestions,ffh0jbb,t1_ffgy6rc,1579919857.0,"But there's nothing about any of that that requires a game to be stopped and restarted. You're right that there's no way to avoid a glitch, if the data connection gets closed, but these are fast networks. The glitch ought to be in the hundreds of milliseconds. The problem is that it's hard (not all that hard, but not trivial) to write a program that can sense that a channel has closed and open a new channel to continue communicating with a server. It requires the application to maintain its own idea of a session that's channel-independent.

What I'm saying is that if you pay me to write a game that can manage this application-level session management, I can do it. But it will cost more than writing a game that relies on the operating system's normal communication channels, because it's more complicated. There's no technical reason the whole game has to restart, it's a business decision.

Edit: if you're interested in the details, look into how gRPC uses HTTP/2 to create channels and utilize multiple connections. It's quite fascinating if you're in the business, more so if you haven't paid attention to developments over the last few years.

With a game, you've already paid the money to buy it. They don't lose anything if you have to restart, as long as it's not so annoying that you tell your friends not to buy the game.

You can cause an indignant response by combining the wrong foods (e.g. dipping a pickle in ketchup), for eating the right food at the wrong time (roast beef and potatoes for breakfast), eating at the wrong time (lunch at 2pm instead of 12pm), skipping a meal, eating an extra meal, fasting, cutting a primary food (e.g. meat, or wheat) out of your diet, and so on. In all these cases, you'll find people will typically comment on it, and some will become visibly angry with you.

I think it's because people see it and can easily envision themselves doing it, and it gives them a visceral response that they can't ignore. A person who is used to eating three meals a day, for example, sees you skip dinner and thinks you're engaging in some kind of self-harm.

Do the division of labor as a team. In an ideal relationship, both people will give readily and without resentment because they love each other and want to do it, and both will feel like they're getting more than they're giving. Dividing up chores is easy then. But to get to that point is going to take more than one conversation. Depending on how the guy was raised, how he sees his role and habits, and how sensitive he is to your needs, you may never get to that point.

Edit: The above may sound insensitive. I got piled on yesterday in another similar post that involved men and women and dishwashing. But I can tell you from experience that men generally do well with ownership, and don't do well being told what to do or noticing things that other people think need to be done. If you can't get to the place where your boyfriend is willingly doing more than you expect, then you should aim for splitting the chores in a way that you both think is fair and you never have to ""ask"" or ""tell"" him to do anything. If you're asking or telling, you become a household manager, not a girlfriend, and you should kick him out."

1. enter the store
2. look at the overhead menu with many options and variations
3. someone behind you asks if you're in line. You sort of are, because there's no where else to be, but you can say ""no"" and try to put yourself in a location that allows you to continue reading the menu and figure out what you want
4. get in line and approach the counter
5. the person behind the counter asks what you want
6. Advice: DO NOT ask for the meatball sandwich. It tastes good but is guaranteed to make a huge mess and make you worry about who is watching you make a mess while you eat it.
7. you read the name of the sandwich off the menu, e.g. ""Cold Cut Combo"". Choose 6-inch or 12-inch.
8. the person behind the counter will ask you a question. You can tell it's a question, but  due to their accent, it's unclear what they're asking. After some back and forth you understand they are asking what kind of bread you want.
9. You don't know what your choices are, because they're too small to read. Just say ""wheat"". They're all made of wheat anyway.
10. They may or may not ask you whether you want it toasted. They may or may not ask it intelligibly.
11. They'll ask you what kind of cheese you want. Study the menu, or ask them questions while the line behind you gets longer, or .... just say ""cheddar"". If you ask for provolone, you do pronounce the ""E"" on the end, but be prepared for the person behind the counter to not know that or for someone else in line to whisper ""I think it's pronounced provo-loan"" to their friend.
12. Now the person will want to know which toppings you want. There's a wide array of cut vegetables and salad dressings. Take your time, the people behind you in line can't go anywhere. They'll just murmur louder.
13. Paying is easy. Just hand over a $20 bill and take your change, and carry your sandwich away.

I recommend Jimmy John's, where you basically say the name of the sandwich you want and they hand it to you about 20 seconds later. Paying is similarly easy. Or go to McDonald's and say ""I want a Big Mac, just the sandwich, not the meal."" There's not much ambiguity there."

You say ""homophobic"" but what I said applies equally to heterosexual activity and intravenous drug use. Do you remember when it was thought that prostitution was contributing equally to the spread of HIV? My logic applies identically to them. But in the end, the CDC claims [men who have sex with men](https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/group/msm/index.html) made up 70% of new cases in 2017, even though they make up a tiny portion of the society.

I don't blame disease on the people who contract it, unless they knowingly engage in risky behaviors. Then they can't escape all blame. But let's place blame squarely where it belongs: on those who SPREAD it. It's the same logic as frowning at the person who shows up in the office with the flu. The worker may be doing what is in his own immediate interest, but putting the health of many at risk. I blame that person. The difference with HIV is that the disease is lifelong, hugely expensive, and leads to greater harms than the flu. There are still many people in the US who can't afford treatment, as well as outside the US. I don't think borders change the ethics.

Risk-taking behaviors are indeed a part of every person's life. That doesn't change anything about this discussion. A person who puts their own life at risk (a smoker, say) has to suffer the consequences.
