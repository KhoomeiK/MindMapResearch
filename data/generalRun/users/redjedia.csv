The fact that she got him clean by putting her foot down should be looked at as a sign of kindness and nothing else.

darksouls,ff5y15v,t3_eru87w,1579613953.0,"I’d heard of the oeuvre of games that this series had spawned since the original “Dark Souls” came out, but I kept hearing about its penchant for difficulty preceding it ever since that point, and that definitely put me off for eight years. It was through finding out the backstory of the game from a Discord friend and [Jim Sterling’s video on its inherent political themes (thar be spoilers here)](https://youtu.be/2HNQ7ysT4MA) that I first became interested in it. So I bought the remaster while I was in the middle of “Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel.” But even so, what convinced me to give it a go immediately before starting up “Borderlands 3” (and finding I couldn’t run it optimally) was a combo of [this WatchMojo video of starter tips](https://youtu.be/GuWvD_7PdEY) and [this other Jim Sterling video talking about how the series approaches difficulty in its fights.](https://youtu.be/SXUzbcNM6K0) My hype intensified for starting up the game with those videos in mind, and I started playing it.

AskReddit,feu5h15,t1_feu1hhq,1579383329.0,"Okay, that’s my recommendation for you; now let me get into why I think your question is presumptuous at best and stifling of creativity at worst.  
Humans are not an especially original species. Everything they create as people has been done before in Ancient Greek plays, poems, myths, etc. And those Greek writers and religious leaders merely wrote stories about their inherent desires and wants, as well as the ability to explain away things that they had no explanation for at the time. Being creative is not about being completely brilliant and doing something that nobody else has done in the entire history of the world; it’s making what you yourself are doing interesting enough to stand out from your peers. An easy way to do that is to look at where there’s a gap in the market, big, medium or small, and fill that gap with something good.  
The reason why I picked “Knives Out” is because it knew that there was market for whodunnits that wasn’t being satiated by the current movie studios, the biggest of which are seeing the money that Marvel’s making and just doing what they’re doing, but worse, and without any attention paid to anything else. And “Knives Out” isn’t alone: “Crazy Rich Asians” became a success because it was catering to the audience that had been starved for romantic comedies since before they died out because of the bombs of “The Ugly Truth” and pretty much any of the last three movies that Garry Marshall directed. (Not trying to defend those movies, BTW; they sucked, but not because they were romcoms. And I mean no ill will towards Marshall, but to put it bluntly, he’d lost his mojo long before his passing.) And they’re currently working on a sequel, to boot.  
So instead of asking us which movies impressed us with their true originality and new ideas, maybe ask us which movies we’ve seen off the beaten path that people looking for something different may not have heard of. There is no movie with something truly original in it; there’s only movies that give us something interesting within."
AskReddit,feu1hhq,t3_eqfgfg,1579382153.0,"One movie that I really enjoyed and thought was very well executed was “Knives Out.” To go into why I like it so much would give away much that is best left unspoiled, but basically, it’s a modern whodunnit that elected to update tropes rather than break away from them (though it does do some of that, too)."

darksouls,feiq1cu,t3_ep5845,1579144360.0,"I think that Blighttown is over-hated, at the very least. With the remaster’s framerate, it’s tough but very fair, just as long as you keep your Spider Shield raised and your supply of Blooming Purple Moss Clumps... stocked. (Equipping the Rusted Iron Ring and the Poisonbite Ring also helps.) It definitely takes concentration to make it through, but it’s not unfair in that regard, IMO.  
On another note, though I haven’t gotten to Sif yet, I think that Quelaag is a boss that might have gotten the same rep as the former if the reason for her being a boss weren’t squirreled so deeply into the lore. She was just trying to protect her sister, and after just eight Humanity given to her in my current playthrough so far, I understand why, even setting aside their being siblings."

And anything that doesn’t fall into that brand would be MC Hammer or Vanilla Ice’s discography. But if you were to ask me personally, I’d point you in the direction of Public Enemy’s “Fight the Power” and “Bring the Noise” (if he likes metal, the remix of the latter with Anthrax might be okay), or Paris’s “The Devil Made Me Do It.”"

TrueOffMyChest,fee5lei,t1_fee3flf,1579026868.0,"“Friends” has a great episode in demonstrating everything wrong with parental favoritism as a joke, truthfully. In the episode, Jack Gellar tells his favored child, Ross, that he left his less favored child Monica’s childhood mementos (drawings, essays, et al) in the garage during a rainstorm and they got soaked, yet showed favor to Ross’s equivalent stuff. That’s strike one of three.  
Then the two of them attempt to hide what Jack did from Monica because they’re afraid of confirming the correct reality that he favors Ross. That’s strike two! And then they do in the most pitiful way possible: By hiding it under her childhood blanket. Strike three! You’re out!  
Then Monica comes in and finds it out because they did a terrible job of hiding it from her. Then, after all that, along with everything else that has taken place across the entire series up to this point, Jack gives her his Porsche that he’s taken pride in for the entire series. The reaction to this occurs in three forms.  
First, Monica instantly forgives him for everything he’d done throughout the series because of that one nice thing (not just in that episode, but throughout the whole series, which is harder to justify given how continuity does *supposedly* matter in “Friends”). Second, Ross becomes outraged because *he wanted the Porsche!* (Dude, I like you the most out of everyone else on the cast, but fuck off wit dat sheet!)  
Third is my reaction, where I find that that’s not enough to let Jack off the hook. You could maybe say that the Porsche makes up for the lost mementos (though I’d have to squint *really* hard for me personally to think so), but if you’ve actually watched the show, you’ll know that that’s barely even a start. Plus, Jack hasn’t changed, nor has his wife and Ross and Monica’s mother (strangely absent from this episode, I think); he’s still gonna favor Ross going forward, Monica is gonna feel left out again once the novelty of driving the Porsche wears off, and Ross is still going to be excessively coddled by his parents going forward. And this is before we get to the fact that this “resolution” basically says that you *can* put a price on love, regardless of what your parents say, and regardless of what you may tell your kids. Jack, not sorry to say, but you’re still out, and none of the strikes have been reversed, you idiotic and exceptionally tall infant!
Wow, that felt good. Carry on!"
