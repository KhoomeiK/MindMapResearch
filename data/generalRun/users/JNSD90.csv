AmItheAsshole,ff2bav9,t1_ff1vt68,1579499480.0,"Amen to this. Clearly issues have gotten to this point through years and years of the parents lack of empathy and understanding also their lack of work to get the kid to a point where this wouldn’t of happened in the first place. 

Firstly, for me as a father who has a daughter and is divorced with limited time, I was called a Disneyland dad for a while, that was one of about 100 attacks I received due to an ex-wife that was more focused I attacking me than looking inward at herself and thinking “how is all this hate and resentment affecting our daughter?” So an initial throwaway line at the start saying he’s a Disneyland dad speaks volumes. Are you trying to somehow deflect responsibility and shun the fact that if he’s such an asshole then it’s clearly actually your fault as the “responsible, caring parent” and you’ve actually failed in you part of the deal. 

I think YTA. 

Be a better parent. Talk to your kid. Who cares about sex and where it’s done. As long as everyone consenting no one has died. Get some perspective. 

Kicking out a kid “because they’re so disrespectful” speaks volumes about your lack of ability as a parent."

JoeRogan,fekvlmb,t1_fek1mr4,1579208512.0,"Yeah that’s probably it. But it’s literally the most fascinating thing about him. He would have an incredible perspective on how to be the best version of himself that the world would love to see I’m sure. 

I do however get the sense that he’s so “confident” and “self assured” these days that he doesn’t want to touch that “weak loser” version of himself. 

Which in and of itself actually says a lot about him that’s he’s not confident, self-aware or kind enough to see that his failures and being able to talk about them are his greatest strength."
JoeRogan,fejgybg,t3_ep7xf8,1579173759.0,"I was authentically disappointed by this interview. Seemed to be wafer thin and scratching the surface. How about going deep in his drugs, alcohol, recovery and the road back from prison. I mean fuck me, the guy could of ended up never acting again and dead. Yet he somehow had one of the biggest Hollywood comebacks in history. 

He’s sober, top of the A-Listers, interesting but yeah, let’s talk about cars, Iron Man, and a whole lot of other basically boring shit. The chat about martial arts was relatively satisfying but God what a let down. 

I do have a feeling however that it might be a no fly zone for RDJ. Maybe he was like “talking about my dark past is a no go zone”"

IronmanTriathlon,feeo5qx,t1_fedf17k,1579037714.0,"Yeah, I’m normally the same. I never ran and last year decided to run a marathon (Melbourne) with 8 weeks training. Did it in 4hrs but blew up at the end. 

Sounds like you’ve been watching Nick Bare. 

Good luck. Please come back and let us know how you went regardless of success, failure or other as it would be great to know. I did the same with my marathon. Had lots of people telling me I was screwed. Same with my half marathon Spartan (people saying it was like a full marathon) I killed that and found it pretty easy. 

Only advice I have for nutrition is start experimenting NOW on what to take while running your long runs and riding. Look at how many gels you will need for the run. See what solid foods you can have on the bike. Get your morning meal dialled."

I’m genuinely curious as it would take massive balls to have zero experience and firstly pay the entry fee but secondarily think your body will give you a green light on this one. 

I’m about to do my first 70.3 in late feb but have worked very hard to prepare and have a strong athletic background. I’m still too scared to sign up for the full in May as I want to see how I go with the half. Maybe I’m just weak..."
Biohackers,fed5ivx,t3_eo7063,1578999904.0,"I was keto for over a year. Love my meat and have listened intently to Jordan Peterson, Mark Bell and the others on the carnivore diet, but man, even I don’t believe it. I think I have a pretty balanced opinion after all these years. Been mildly obsessed with health and well-being and followed both carnivores and vegans. 

I’m going more and more towards living food and less meat. If it feels good (and is legal) do it. But eating only meat just feels pretty awful and I simply do not believe in the long run, it’ll be the answer. 

But like the rest of us, what do I know?"
davidgoggins,febjs92,t3_eo6sms,1578959570.0,"Be the person you kid will look up to eventually. No matter what happens through divorce, kids grow up, ex-partners can only have control for a limited (in the scheme of life) time. 

I’ve been going through something similar for five years, nowhere near as bad but limited time with my kid. I’ve committed to being the best father I can be and man I can be. If you’re a man of integrity, with high personal standards, nothing will keep your kid from you in the years to come. 

I ran my first marathon last year (not a runner) did a half marathon Spartan and am doing half Ironman Feb 23 in Geelong. Planning full Ironman in May. Will keep running, keep meditating and do things that hopefully inspire my kid and also my family and friends. 

It’s just what you do with those years that will define you. Never give up trying on your kid. Never give up on yourself. Much love from afar on your journey."
Entrepreneur,febi63h,t1_fe7xi8o,1578959079.0,"Great story, but admittedly I don’t have questions about your business, only your family. Your mum couldn’t support you, so you couch surfed... why couldn’t you stay at your mums even if she couldn’t financially support you? Did she rent out your room? Also, what about your dad after you helped his business to “take off”? 

As a dad, I’m very curious how and why your parents couldn’t support you. Admittedly it may have been a large contributing factor to your success but just have been very difficult at the time."

Many years ago I asked my cousin (literally world renowned orthopaedic surgeon who specialises in hip and knee replacements, and has worked on world class olympians and others) if he would bother taking Glucosamine as I was having doubts. He said, “if I were to err on the side of caution given the research, I would and I do take it”.

So I kept taking it.

AskMen,fdlpodx,t1_fdi6hh7,1578529519.0,"Incorrect. Do you think men in their 70’s and 80’s give two flying fucks about that? 

As you age, for the majority of the human race get perspective about legacy, impact and what you gave back (in the sense of family, children or community, among other things) and this eclipses all other issues. 

Of course, there are plenty of narcissists who end up living generally meaningless lives and may even go to their grave wishing “I had a bigger cock and was taller”.

Entrepreneur,fdljb1f,t3_elyqf5,1578525273.0,"I’ve been thinking about this a fair bit lately. I’m pretty experienced in business and life (not that that means shit anymore) but I was thinking is it because I’m getting older (44M) or because it’s authentically damaging to follow so many toxic positivity influencers? I recently did a pretty big purge of my social following as I agree. Looking at hyper positive people all day every day almost has the opposite effect. 

There’s room for them, but too much is awful and detrimental to mental health. You’ll never live up to most of them (not to be cynical, but data would prove me right). I ever stopped following any celebrities like The Rock who I loved, but just couldn’t stand the daily “I’m so grateful” “I have the best fans” yada yada yada. 

I still follow some great people, but they’re way more real to me. Rich Roll & Tom Bilyeu, still follow
Tim Ferris and a couple of select others. They beat different drums"

She’s an adult, albeit a young one, but the rules still apply. The caveat is she has to know the rules first, or you’re all not playing the same game. 

Catch up with her and really listen to her, then tell her how you feel, and what your rules are. Also tell her, no matter what happens, you’ll never give up and you’ll always be her dad.
