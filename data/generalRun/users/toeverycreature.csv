BabyBumps,ffdbchs,t3_eszgcp,1579817214.0,"Just to help lessen the disappointment, there really isn't anything like a baby to see at 7 weeks. Usually just a sack and a fetal pole. It looks like a small circle inside a big circle (uterus). Unless someone explains what is what you probably wouldn't be able to decipher it. Also where I am its standard not to use audible doppler levels (so you can hear the heartbeat) until after 12 weeks as it uses a much higher power level and while US is generally considered safe they will always used the least level of invasiveness as possible. I din't hear my babies heartbeat till 12 weeks. 

I realize you are disappointed and you could ring around and try to find a place that will let you see and hear but you might find that for scans that early the protocol in your area is the same everywhere."
beyondthebump,ffdaljd,t3_estz7y,1579816722.0,"Ive been on baby bumps for all my pregnancies and to be fair ive gotten more negaitve and horrible stuff on beyond the bump that baby bumps but I figure that on open subs you are going to have negative people regardless and the mods are volunteers so cant be watching every thread. You cant really judge a sub by a couple of threads

Ive been given crap for not having the baby in the same room as me at home (I had terrible PPD and couldn't sleep with the baby beside me. My midwife, my GP and the well child nurse all told me to put her in her own room but according to reddit I deserve to have my baby die of SIDS

I was down voted  for stating that the no sex before 6 weeks is not a universal rule and different countries judge your medical readiness in different ways. I was cleared at 4.5 weeks after my second because I met all of the medical requirements set by my counry'sOB/GYN guidelines (stitches healed, no  bleeding for a week, no pain. bunch of other stuff). But nope, my country's medical system is stupid and i deserve to die from an infection for encouraging mums to have sex before 6 weeks.

I mentioned on a car seat thread that we forward faced our 2 year old because she had such bad motion sickness rear facing should would choke on her vomit in her sleep. Our GP said the risk of her aspirating it and getting severe pneumonia was way higher than a head on crash severe enough that being forward facing could be harmful. But apparently Im a bad mum for not always riding in the back with her (and hiring someone else to drive???) or just not being content to never travel in a car with her till she was 4. 

Ive had some negativity on babybumps too so its not exclusive to one sub. I will also say Ive had some really really good encouragement on babybumps and beyondthebump too. I choose to stay for the positive and just ignore the negative.

If you want a really safe sub find your birth month sub and wait till they go private. That gets rid of the random trolls and its usually a way nicer place."
BabyBumps,ffd4bcf,t3_esz0sh,1579813152.0,"It depends why you are pumping. I can't imagine trying to pump enough for a full day's feed with a manual pump. And I imagine it would take a while and be very tiring.
Electric pumps aren't uncomfortable. Tbh breastfeeding is way more uncomfortable. especially at the start  the key is to get a correct fitting flange (the one that comes with the pump may be the wrong size) and setting the pump to the level necessary to express milk. Putting it in the highest setting isn't more efficient it just makes it uncomfortable. I found electric pumping with my Medela quite relaxing and not uncomfortable at all."
beyondthebump,ffbeo7z,t1_ffbaoii,1579762043.0,"Sorry. I see so many hyped up panic posts in FB I forget redditors are generally saner in what they post. I'm super freaked about my kids around water. I didn't even do a paddling pool this summer, only the sprinkler and plastic slide. My country has a high number of drowning too. Doesn't help I'm on an island with tons of rivers, lakes and easy access. Little kids just seem so drawn to water and it only takes a few cm to drown."

My second came so fast I barely got to the hospital in time so not time for any kind of pain relief.

beyondthebump,ffb69jr,t1_ffanmje,1579752916.0,"I meant post not title but didn't realise because of how it shows on my mobile. And loving the down votes for correcting a misunderstanding of statistics. As a former EMT I know way too many kids drown but my point was it isn't the number 1 cause of death, just the top category within a much larger category which also needs to be way lower."
beyondthebump,ffahmhl,t3_es7igx,1579735939.0,"So I think if you look at the data it's not as many kids drowning as you think. The leading cause of death for children that age group is unintentional injury. Of all the different type of injury the top one is drowning. If you look at over all causes of death the same number of kids die from drowning as do from congenital abnormalities (around 400).
This is still not great but its not as dramatic as your title suggests."

BabyBumps,ff9vz5y,t3_es5lg5,1579722709.0,"There is nothing that will actually get labour going except your body deciding it's time or getting induced with drugs to make your body think its time. You can try all the old wives tales, eat dates and pineapple, have sex, go walking, eat spicy food etc but if your body isn't ready and baby doesn't want to come it's just makes the last few weeks  exhausting and stressful.
I did everything I could to encourage my first. I still went way over and got an induction. With my second I figured screw it I'm going to eat pie and watch Netflix instead of trying to make labour happen. That baby arrived on his due date. Obviously my experience is anecdotal but my point is just relax, if eating dates and walking one foot off the curb helps you feel better then go for it but if its adding to the stress give it a pass because its probably not going to help anyway."
BabyBumps,ff9vfu5,t3_es7ocp,1579722358.0,It depends on your baby. My first was so unsettled and I had low supply so was on a 3 hourly pumping schedule and it left me exhausted and with no time to do anything. I needed help with general house hold stuff and someone to hold my fussy baby so I could sleep. My second baby was so easy and chill that I had to turn down offeres of help becaise there was nothing for people to do when they got to my place.
BabyBumps,ff9v3z2,t3_es9igc,1579722129.0,"With our first we didn't. With our second we told our almost two year old but since she couldn't pronounce the letter L people had no idea of the name. This time we wanted to share the name with our daughter who is now 4 and son who is 2 so they could talk to the baby. We figured our oldest would tell everyone anyway so just told people if they asked. Turns out my 4 year old has told no one and if people ask she says it's a suprise. Lol so we probably could have kept it quiet.
It's really up to you. If you have super opinionated family who might be rude and pushy about your chosen name it might be best not to share."
BabyBumps,ff9uof8,t3_esbb96,1579721789.0,"It really doesn't bother me when I'm pregnant. I'm someone who was very obese as a teen and early adult and then worked hard to lose the weight and develop healthy habits. So weight gain and getting a belly is mentally hard for me but I also know that's my issue to deal with. When people comment on my bump I know it's a comment on my pregnancy. When people say I look ready to pop ill laugh because I feel ready to pop and honestly I think the same thing when I look in the mirror. If I run across someone I haven't seen in a while I'll bring up I'm pregnant (despite it being very obvious at 8months) because I've seen people look awkward clearly wanting to congratulate me but not wanting to offend.

Now I draw the line at people touching my belly without asking but bump comment are totally welcome."
BabyBumps,ff9ua88,t3_esbc6l,1579721478.0,"Hospitals in New Zealand haven't had nurseries since the 80s. However at least at the hospital where I had my first two the ward midwives will take your baby to the ward station and keep an eye on them for you if you want sleep. My first was super unsettled and I was exhausted after a three day long induction. I think the midwives spent more time holding my baby than me. My second was super chill so I didn't need anyone to take him for me. 
So not having a nursery can work but only if there are still systems in place to let the mum rest"
BabyBumps,ff8e4i9,t3_es12oj,1579674653.0,Kiwi here too. Congrats on the beautiful baby. My second labour was a lot like yours. My midwife didn't think I was that far along as I'd only been in labour for an hour total and my previous labour was 16 hours. I also went through transition in the car and had a head showing when I got to the hospital. I'm planning to go in super early this time round.
BabyBumps,ff5cvg9,t3_ern8mm,1579587655.0,"So for my last baby we barely got to the hospital and I had the baby on the floor of thr birthing room because his head came out before I could walk to the bed.

  They passed baby through my legs to me then helped me up to the bed sitting on a bluey (disposable absorbant blue patic backed pad). Baby was on my chest and they gave me a blanket to cover him to keep him warm. They cut the cord once I was in the bed. Baby latched almost from the start so I lay on the bed with him nursing and cuddling while they helped deliver the placenta and sewed me up. 

They did the first and second apgar score while I was holding him. After an hour or so they asked if I was OK with them doing the newborn check. While they did that I moved to sitting on a chair and gave him some more cuddles before handing him to dad. 

At about the two hour mark I went to the ensuite to have a quick water shower to get the worst of the blood, sweat and goo off (they recomend not using soap if you shower soon after as the baby is comforted by natural mum smell and soap smell may upset them). When I was done showering I put on a maternity pad but kept sitting on the bluey on the bed because you can leak a lot that first day."

BabyBumps,ff2gadf,t1_ff0rnh2,1579504875.0,Agree with this. My oldest hated the stroller once she could walk and totally refused to ride in it after 18months. My 2 year old loves the stroller and gets upset when we don't put him in it. I imagine we still has at least a year of using it regularly.
BabyBumps,ff2fov2,t3_er56cj,1579504170.0,Nothing. I ate at lunch and baby had her feed against my stomach so there is currently no room for any more food today. I'm sure baby will move during the night and I'll wake at 2am to raid the fridge
BabyBumps,ff2fe7y,t3_er96c3,1579503827.0,I was induced because I went 2 weeks overdue with my first. It was a terrible experience but I am glad I didn't wait any longer because when they examined my placenta they could tell it had started to fail. My baby looked like a wrinkly elephant because she had been losing baby fat due to my placenta giving up. I'm willing to go to 41 weeks and that's it. I know people who have waited and the baby was fine and came when it was ready but I don't think I'd ever have peace about waiting.

ketonz,ff1h75x,t3_er3lii,1579479168.0,"Don't buy the keto junk food. Its over priced and  not worth it. Use your carb allowance on veges like broccoli, cauli and anything else that fits your macros. If you aren't using up carbs on just like non keto snacks you can eat an awful lot of veges and if you use vege markets its quite cheap. I eat stirfries or steamed veges several times a week. 

If you have space grow some vegetables yourself. Courgettes are super easy to grow and make a great filler. I make zoodles from them and add them grated to my pizza bases.

You can make keto friendly sauces with cheap ingredients. I make a satay sauce for stirfries with peanut butter and coconut cream and some herbs and spices. Way cheaper than the lowest carb premade option. I season with a lot of herbs and spices rather than sauces too. 

Check out local places for cheap trays of eggs. Eggs are high in protein and filling. I  eat so many eggs. If you have space and time keep a couple of hens for personal egg supply. We are considering this considering how many eggs we go through.

Don't feel like you have to use coconut oil. I did for a while but its so expensive so I just use regular oil for cooking. Still got the same keto benefits. 

If you like keto bread find a keto bread recipe and make your own buying ingredients from bin inn. The bake street stuff is good but 10 bucks a loaf is just way out of my price range. I usually just to 30 sec microwave bread and toast it  when our family does burgers or BLTs since its super cheap and quick to make. I don't have the patience to make my own proper loaf. 

Get cheap meat from pak n save. You don't have to be eating prime steak. You can do keto with cheap mince and chicken drums. 

Don't try to make the keto meals you find on US based websites. What is cheap for them is not for us. Think about what you ate pre keto and just re jig it to make it keto. 

I eat keto but my husband and kids dont. I just modify the meals I make for them so Im not making completely separate stuff. Our grocery bill is the same. 

If you want a diet that is keto but looks like a standard diet with keto bread, cakes, deserts, and low carb substitutes for everything then you are going to spend a lot of money to do it. But if you are willing to change the way you eat and go for a more meat dairy and vege diet it can be just as inexpensive as a carb based diet."
fitpregnancy,ff0wdqx,t3_er0oti,1579472899.0,I feel your pain. I did a PB half marathon before I got pregnant. I tried to keep running by Hyperemesis through till 26 weeks killed that notion. Then a bunch of other pregnancy related things relegated me to walking only. My husband had just gotten into running before I got pregnant and he just signed up for a half marathon when I will be 6 weeks PP. Im super happy for him but also super bummed because I would love to run it with him but know I wont be able to. And when he comes home from his long training runs I feel so envious because I miss my long runs.
AmItheAsshole,ff0t9po,t1_fey94gy,1579472041.0,"It can be helpful at a normal weight. I switched from regular food CICO to keto because I had such horrible GI issues especially when I ran. Keto seems to stop me having endless diarrhea and stomach cramps. When I got to a normal weight I just at at maintenance calories. I even ran half marathons and set some pretty nice PBs. I have no negative issues on it. And despite what people think about the diet I still eat fruit and veges, don't buy special ""keto"" food and have a balanced diet as far as macro nutrients are concerned. People who just use the diet to lose weight and then go back to regular eating usually gain a lot of weight back unless they keep tracking their calories till they adjust to a carb based diet again. Its more of a lifestyle choice like vegetarianism. Its not a magic weight loss diet. I never recomend keto to people  since it takes a lot of effort to follow and if you arent getting any physical benefits its hard to stick to. I just tell people to download MFP and dont eat more than it sets on the app. If people specially request advice of keto style eating Ill help them but will also tell them if weight loss is the goal then any form of CICO (keto, paleo, vegetarian, vegan, whole food, regular food) will work and to choose based on what fits their lifestule and what they realistically believe they can maintain forever, not what they think will give them the fastest results."

Use good passwords, change them regularly and use two factor authentication and no one will be hacking in. Also if security is lax enough people  can hack into your baby monitor they can also hack into anything on your network like a laptop. Which means they can remote access your Web cam and anything else on your computer (like banking and credit card information) .
The solution isn't to make people afraid of WiFi cameras because of the few people that got hacked due to poor security. The solution is to educate yourself and set up a secure network.

BabyBumps,fep66vo,t3_eq2wpd,1579313025.0,"Warning, passionate rant ahead because in my EMT days I pulled one too many dead people from cars because of incorrect use of seat belts. 

Do not use these. Seat belts are designed and tested for your specific make and model of car. Anything that adjusts fit makes the seat belt unsafe. When I was an EMT (too pregnant to keep it up now) we discussed these and they are a good way to increase your risk of airbag injury (airbags are designed for use with a correctly used seat belt). Also they move the way that force is distributed in a crash. Sash belts distribute the force across your entire body. The lap part keep you in your seat but the sash takes most of the forward force. If you see people who have been in front inpact crashes they usually have a sesrbelt bruise running diagonally across thier chest where the sash was but minimal on their hips where the lap part should be. These pregnancy belts redistribute the force to supossedly keep the baby safe.  If you wear a seat lap belt low and tight with the sash going across your chest there isn't enough belt to direct the force all on your baby. These accessories will damage your legs and if the impact is great enough could direct enough force to break your femur. If you think labour is bad I guarantee you that bilateral femur fractures are worse.

No one would ever buy a car seat that is not safety tested and does not meet the standards just becaise its advertised as being more comfortable for your child so the same goes for adult vehicle restraints.

I'm 8 months pregnant so I get that pregnancy is uncomfortable. I'd love a comfortable  pregnancy safe belt but until one is name, tested and approved by intestinal standards to be safe ill be uncomfortable."

If Nipt says that baby is fine it usually is but if it reports a problem it will not be 99% accurate.  Type 1 errors are less likely with Nipt than with the NT and blood screen but they are still common enough that a positive screen requires an amnio to confirm.

But probably the biggest reason for me is that where I am almost all doulas are super crunchy, anti vaxx, woo science believers who really push for home births.

Was prepped for a c section but gave the ok to try forceps which worked but then had a retained placenta and because of thr delivery I had a bruised nerve in my perinium which caused excruciating pain for two days.


My next I went into labour at 1am on my due date. I was going to try for drug free but it got painful fast and I didn't think I could do that level of pain for 16, hours like with my first  so told my midwife I wanted to head in for an epidural. Little did I know I was actually entering transition . The dive was unpleasant but a block from the hospital a had an contraction accompanied with a reflective push. I couldn't have not pushed if I tried and I could feel baby's head descending. We made it to the hospital but not a bed. I was hands and knees on the floor. Pushing felt so good. It wiped away the pain of the contractions. I felt in control and excited that baby was coming soon. Two more pushes and he was out. And I felt great. 1 minor tear but otherwise awesome. He latched right away and I was up and having a shower and sitting in a chair with him really as soon as I was stiched up.

pregnant,fdltz58,t3_em1pvd,1578532441.0,"I'm in New Zealand. We currently get 24 weeks paid parental leave. This can be taken by the mum or dad but not both at the same time (which I personally think sucks as it would be great to have both able to be home for the first few weeks). The payment is matched to your weekly income up to 580 dollars. If you work an ok job this usually isn't near your full income but its paid from taxes so no complaints from me. Your employer can top you up to your full amount but it's up to them. If you have been employed for a year your employer  must keep your job avaliable to you for up to 52 weeks. Also the government provides everyone with 60 dollars a week regardless of income. This is ED the Best Start grant and enables everyone to buy nappies and formula/pumping/breastfeeding stuff, other ba y stuff and clothes so every child has the essentials. Once your child is 1 you can keep getting the grant if your income is low enough till your child is three.

From age 3 children get 20 hours a week of funded preschool/childcare, some places (no where near me though) will offer this from age 2.
Childcare generally costs about 5.50 to 6.50 an hour bust most places have a weekly cap. So my kids centre is 6.50 an hour per kid but once you reach 230 dollars a child per week there is no more cost for extra hours. Given minimum wage here is 18.90 an hour childcare for one child is just under a third of your weekly income if you are a minimum wage worker. However if your income is that low the you get subsidised rates of about 2 dollars and hour. So working takes some budgeting but it's doable."

BabyBumps,fcs7bz6,t1_fcrwzyu,1577912454.0,"2kg of water is easily lost. When I run in summer when not pregnant my before and after run weight can fluctuate by 1kg through sweat alone. When I have some slack eating days then go back to low carb I'll lose 2kg plus and its water. Its because of how your body deals with excess sugar and salt, it retains water to keep your sodium levels balanced and every molecule of sugar in your body is bound to a few molecules of water. So you cut of the supply of excess sugar and salt, your body uses what it's go and you pee out a lot of water.

It does depend on your size. A 50kg woman won't retain as much water as a 100kg one. Bigger people can lose a lot of water weight just by changing how they eat, smaller people lose less because they have less in thier body."

TW -  I used to be an EMT and have been to several unsuccessful SIDS resuscitations. The difference between those who were using monitors and those that werent was how warm the body was when we got there. Despite efforts it is extremely rare to revive a true cause of SIDS. I know that's super morbid but the thing with SIDS is there is currently nothing that is known to detect or prevent it aside from following the safe home safe sleep guidelines. The monitors may prevent deaths from SUDI (sudden unexplained death of an infant) attributed to suffocation but again following safe sleep guidlines is cheaper and more effective.

I'm a third time mum who has had lots of issues with PPD/PPA. I was sorely tempted to get a monitor but my midwife and the hospital paediatrician were helpful in pushing fear and anxiety aside and letting logic prevail.

In choosing a midwife it can be daunting because there are so many to choose from and very little info on each on the website. Best bet is to ask anyone you know who recently had a baby for recommendations. If you want to keep thinks on the down low from people you know make a new FB account and join your local fb mums group and ask for recommendations there. 

Also if you are seeing a midwife and feel you aren't clicking with them you have the right to change midwives. A good midwife will tell you this but some don't so people feel they are stuck once they go to the first appointment.
