TeenageSuicideWatch,fffny2m,t1_fffjk6w,1579888030.0,"I know the local language, I'm just not fluent. I make mistakes while speaking, and it's a blow to my confidence every time someone laughs at it. No one wants to be friends with the kid who gets laughed at haha.

About Germany, the top colleges only do their courses in German. This means I'd have to spend an year before going there trying to pass the A level examinations before I'll be given admission, plus the distance is really way too much. 

I don't know what to do. I just don't."
TeenageSuicideWatch,fffd9wm,t1_fffciaq,1579881423.0,"This was the best college i could get. It was either this or Germany. Germany is thrice the distance away, and I don't have the first clue about German. So yeah, that's why."

facepalm,fel2zq5,t3_epktir,1579212946.0,"As a person who just got into college this Autumn, this is way too true. It's unfair how we're set off to fend for ourselves, pressured with debt and expectations of performance, all the while not being able to complain about a thing because that would be wrong on our part.

I understand that we have to make something out of ourselves, and do the best we can at whatever we may want to do. However, there is a limit, and we don't know where it is for any individual until it's totally crossed and we're past the point of no return.

I, along with thousands of others, would agree that for our entire childhood we aren't able to do anything we like and it's hard to explore options, but when we cross a certain legal age barrier and finish our last year of schooling we're supposed to know exactly what we want, be the best at it and earn enough money quick enough to pay of our student loans.

Something needs to change, for the sake of every kid who yearns to be something, who enjoys learning, who would love to go into a field that he loves. 

For every kid that has a dream: Something. Needs. To. Change."
