13ReasonsWhy,fdnb1zi,t1_f1ll80e,1578581906.0,"ah i was rewatching from s1 to watch s3 and immediately noticed that scene was gone. It was the most well-filmed scene of suicide in movies i saw so far

i especially liked how they showed the loneliness of dying like that really well. i experienced it once. so lonely, that was the last thought before the lights went out. the silence, the panic you feel, and so alone at the end

aaaaaand the edited version is bs"

depression,fctbqtf,t3_eiqkvo,1577938333.0,"2010 is the year that marks the 'before me' and 'after me'. Emotional bullying completely destroyed me when I was just beginning to fix undiagonsed selective mutism and social phobia by myself - in a more vulnerable state than when i was completely withdrawn.


 I was testing the waters and unfortunately i stepped on lava


I wish i could go back to the beginning of 2010 w all my memories/skills I now have, even if I have to attend high school again. I would be able to stand up for myself at least.


I feel i was born about a decade earlier than i should have"

A similar thing happened to me except it ended badly. It wasn't even a job, it was school which *I paid* to attend. Had a breakdown due to a combination of existing conditions, unintentional withdrawals and bad events. People who I considered lab mates 'voted' that I leave. I was having a breakdown and they did just that, *right on the spot*.



I should've taken a break when I started feeling bad, but I couldn't. I once went home around lunch and came back late afternoon, and older coworkers seemed unhappy about it so I didn't really have a choice"
depression,fcjv5gb,t3_eh9up7,1577706277.0,"I wish there was some social app for sad and lonely ppl to find each other, just to talk or whatever they want. I see all these people on the internet, but I am the one outcast in real life. For all my life, I've been an outcast and I can't find anyone. The problem with existing apps are there are so many fake accounts. Or even dangerous. Someone should come up with a way to verify each user while maintaining privacy"
