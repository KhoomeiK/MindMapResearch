I realize how bad tobacco is. I realize how a happy me in 10 years will regret wasting his health. Hell, I've known that for a long time.  


But even baby steps are hard for me. It's so hard making myself go do something I'm not very good at yet, with people I don't really like or respect.

My positioning is also bad once I get into a fight, as I just kinda forget to think about what my squad & the enemy one is doing once I start shooting. My movement is alright, I slide, jump, crouch, more than most. But I don't think about taking the high ground (like getting on top of a vehicle while chasing someone around it), and sometimes I'll get stuck a few times trying to climb a cliff. I remember watching this guy demolish a dozen players in Skulltown - just running the roofs, landing in a nook and healing, creating a distraction - like watching a masterclass. So far ahead of me. Game sense is kinda alright, I listen a lot, like to look around a lot, but I just want to get into fights xD, so I get third-partied a lot.   


Like, I know the theory, I kinda know what I'm doing wrong, but putting that knowledge in application, I just don't. It's k though, I've never been very good at games. I'm just here for fun :)"
