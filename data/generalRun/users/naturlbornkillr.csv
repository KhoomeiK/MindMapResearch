depression,fe629mp,t1_fe61uxh,1578880168.0,will it ever go away?
depression,fe628rs,t1_fe618xe,1578880151.0,"that’s 100% true, he would always say that his actions were justified because of his situation, so it will probably take me a few to start seeing it from a different perspective i just have to be patient, thank you :)"
depression,fd5qhl9,t1_fd5j1qn,1578180340.0,"i’ve recently taken up going back to the gym again and trust me it is so so helpful for your mentality. even after the first day you walk out feeling a wholeee lot better, in my opinion focusing on your diet and your physique not too the extreme but just the right amount is the best distraction, and at the same time, your mentality is getting stronger and you don’t even realize it, get out of that head!!"
depression,fd5exve,t3_ek2mx1,1578176948.0,"my parents have always said the same thing to me, even though my mother takes a million different meds for adhd, depression and bipolar lol, but do not let that get to you. because even though people are struggling somewhere else supposedly “worse than you” (in your fathers words), it doesn’t matter, you are struggling right here right now, you are your own person with your own battles. and your parents suggesting that and telling you to just “move on” is going to make you slowly crawl within yourself and bottle everything up. the only way one can progress is by taking care of themselves first. your depression is extremely validated, because you feel it. so what i would suggest is to pick up some hobbies and stay busy! sometimes your brain is your worst enemy, so distracting yourself with arts n crafts or going to the gym or anything like that will help you understand your self worth. i’m sorry your parents are being inconsiderate like that, but stay strong and take care of yourself!"
depression,fd5cb2u,t3_ek04s9,1578176193.0,"i feel that way, i am always expecting the worse so when something good happens i handle it well and don’t get over excited, and when something bad happens i still can keep my stability. i don’t see it as a defense mechanism or a lack of happiness, but when all your life you can’t seem to catch a break, i feel more secure handling things this way vs putting a halt on my life because i can’t handle it. but that doesn’t mean you should be pessimistic about everything or anything like that, it means that when something good happens you can enjoy it for awhile, and relax for a little bit. it’s like a dose of relief and it helps put you back in that mindset of knowing you are strong. life will always be moving with or without you, and being able to understand that and control your behaviors and your mentality is honestly in my opinion a super awesome skill set."
depression,fd5ag0n,t3_ek33cd,1578175706.0,"yes i have!!! wellbutrin has stimulating properties, but at the same time it lowers seizure thresholds. don’t be scared you aren’t gonna have a seizure!! but i believe the reason your doc is telling you to take vitamin b is because it strengthens that threshold, as well as magnesium. do not drink any caffeine until you can get off that medication, i hated it so much. i got twitches so bad, that my hands were shaking incredibly, i couldn’t stand because my legs were shaking too much, and i got extremely sensitive to light that i was too afraid to open my eyes, i eventually had to call an ambulance. everything was fine i wasn’t close to having a seizure, but the twitching got too intense. some medications don’t affect people well, and with your changing brain chemistry, this one doesn’t affect you well either. get an emergency appointment as soon as possible! i would suggest fluvoxamine if you haven’t already tried it, as well as Abilify if you want mood regulated, best meds of my life! take vitamin b, magnesium and drink lots of water!"
depression,fd4fhme,t3_ejw74l,1578167066.0,"im 19 too and that thought of “how much more of this can i take?” is constantly hanging over me. high school was an extremely rough period of my life as well, and i do also bask in those memories, it feels like i can’t catch a break. but we’re still developing haha, we still have teenage angst we still have many battles to fight against ourselves.  but i suggest that you live for the future not the past, because once you have a goal in your head on where you wanna go and who you wanna be, those will be the memories you can’t wish to start creating. every night i imagine my future family and i always have this distinct picture in my head of my husband, happy, picking up my baby, laughing, and the sun shining through the windows. and that’s what keeps me going, to know that one day i’m gonna be the mother i never had to make my child’s life as beautiful as possible. 

and i know this sounds cliche but....college!! find a career that’s suitable for you, i’m going into mortuary science, it’s cheap it’s quick and once you’re in it pays a lot, and there’s many careers out there that require little work and little money, but they’re fun and exciting. keep yourself as busy as possible during this period of your life, even if it’s little things like focusing on your diet at home, going to the gym, doing arts n crafts, just find things that you like to do to keep yourself out of your head. a busy schedule makes me feel like i got something going for myself and that i’m not as worthless as i seem. and i’m very sorry you are going through this, as someone in your shoes i wouldn’t wish it upon my worst enemy. but we’re still living the...hardest... years of our life, and it seems never ending but last year you were eighteen, and that probably seems like it was just yesterday, so you are still moving with life and surviving! don’t give up, you owe that much to yourself, you deserve a break and you’re gonna get one when the timing is just right! be strong <3"
