TumblrInAction,ffa4ouu,t3_es9gtx,1579727824.0,I'm willing to bet men having a way to have closeness and bonding that isn't a relationship with a woman takes a lot of power away from certain people.
tifu,ff7byw3,t1_ff78nhb,1579645962.0,Story's ludicrous.
saltierthancrait,fet9qa5,t3_eqg0lw,1579373061.0,"To be perfectly honest, though, what we see the New Republic do in the sequels vindicates my long-held disagreement with the New Republic becoming *yet another* Galactic hegemon. I for one was looking forward to seeing the fractured, divided galaxy and the multitude of interstellar superpowers presiding over various regions of the Galaxy. Maybe Death Star technology proliferates (and thus, the threat of the enemy showing up and destroying your planet out of nowhere should tensions escalate) and various systems either usurp or make deals with their moffs, and they forge independent regimes and empires of their own, under the belief that the Republic/Empire was a bad idea. It would also make sense too, since we had WWI aesthetic in the prequels and WWII aesthetic in the OT, we could have Cold War and Vietnam with some modern stuff in the sequels.

But no. Rehash because everything has to look like the classics man!"

acecombat,felmnrw,t1_felje0m,1579225829.0,It's built on a 12 year old engine that's had a bunch of bullcrap grafted onto it over the years and is in serious need of a rewrite. Not to mention they fail to add newer features such as flares to the older aircraft.
MensRights,feitz94,t1_fch6t2v,1579147158.0,"Hell, even the more attainable Adonis physiques? Those are bodybuilders, actors, and models *specifically paid as their day job to work and diet their asses off to look like that*. No way a 3-day-a-week gym visiting average man will bulk that well, especially that quickly."
MensRights,feh87qu,t3_eoqk2r,1579111166.0,"There's two different threads here. The ""traditional values"" one, which I oppose; and the ""be encouraging"" one, which I agree with. Our author paints it as a good thing that women are free to be non-traditional (and it is a good thing), but is then all ""We should expect men to all stick to their assigned roles and traditions"". This is the same sexist, hypocritical bullcrap I'd expect out of a radical feminist lecture."

AskReddit,fed3sge,t1_fe5l2nd,1578997385.0,"That's the expectation that all men are always wanting it and therefore always consenting. They can't be raped, by this ""logic"". This also explains why a woman who's turned down by a man takes it so personally, because if a man always wants it, then it means there must be something *wrong* with her in order to make him refuse. It's disgusting. It's deplorable. It's absolutely fucked up."
