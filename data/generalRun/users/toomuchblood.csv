mbti,fcyjcl2,t3_ejbl33,1578081025.0,"INFJ. Daily smoker, but only at night because I find it impedes my ability to like, ""do things"" I guess? If I wake and bake I just go right back to sleep and there goes my day. Use it mostly to unwind, but in my past it's been used as a way to avoid my problems or feelings. For the longest time it was my favorite way to enjoy food and sex. I'm currently primarily using it for mood stability because I'm no longer on medication. Probably the reason why my meds stopped working after a while, so there's that. Considering decreasing my use to none until I find employment. But no one's biting, so."

CPTSD,fcpbbzw,t3_eiby7o,1577857018.0,"**Trigger Warning: Discussion of Suicidal Ideation/Planning**. I've had a crappy last six months and today wasn't so bad but I'm still not doing so great because I had planned to kill myself tonight. But now I'm second guessing it because of a glimmer of hope that maybe 2020 might not suck: got approved for state health insurance, I'm still super unemployed and negative in my bank accounts, still living with my abusive family, but my dogs are asleep right next to me and my ex is talking to me again, even though we'll never be lovers I know we can still be friends, and that kind of means I don't want to put the noose on just yet...but also I still do? I know this isn't r/suicidewatch but I know a huge part of my mental illness is cptsd so I'll throw a TW up top I guess I just wanted to say yeah, maybe it's not completely absent of good, but maybe? just maybe? it won't suck next year?"
