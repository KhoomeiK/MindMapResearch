BernieSanders,fflqx1f,t3_eu1owy,1580042982.0,"Good this is brought to attention, and it also points out an idiotic system where you have to jump through so many hoops just to cast a vote.

De nederzettingen in en rond oss zijn gedateerd tot 2000bc. Het grote keltische praalgraf is gedeeltelijk gerestaureerd/nagebouwd met dwarsdoorsnede waarbij je kan zien dat er twee graven op elkaar zijn gebouwd. Het bovenste (700 bc) was van ws een man, dat bevatte het beroemde gouden kromzwaard (te bezichtigen in Leiden). Het andere veel oudere graf zou de resten van een vrouw bevatten.
