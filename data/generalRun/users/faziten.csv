ITCareerQuestions,ffbq0ga,t3_eskeub,1579777952.0,"Sounds like a medium to small business. Maybe a grown family company. I've dealt with those, just chill and use it to learn how to deal with being the shotcaller. The people washing out mean your tasks will be trivial and probably even if you are the head IT, you dont have the last word. Probably only requested when things burst in fire and critical parts dont work. (A.k.a. they probably have an excel that they use as database since year 2000, the server is a clone with chinese psu and the gateway is a home router that sometimes doesnt work for some reason). Your job will probably be to mantain the status quo without spending too much. Think of it as being payed to be an internal consultor/emergency IT guy that fixes things that shouldnt be there/ used like that in the first place. I dealt with this kind of situation and decided to not care and work as I searched for something better. Ask what they want out of you, and if its reasonable keep it until you find something better. You wont be flexing your brain with this one, but still you will have to learn how to deal with stressful situations.
If you can't or dont want this kind of environment dont accept it. Washout is real."

ITCareerQuestions,ff4hens,t3_erdsh1,1579563671.0,"Well you do seem more sure about who you are and what you want. So I'm glad in a way that you actually did something about yourself. Now its time to hold on. There will be a lot of half assed rises and promises thrown at you. 

I only suggest you set your priorities straight. If you stay underpayed until you find something better don't do anything beyond your job description. If you accept a rise you acknowledge it to be fair for your extra work, something last time you said you didnt want to do. Ask yourself, how much is the work you are doing worth? How much is the work you signed for worth?"

ITCareerQuestions,femjsev,t3_eps0jh,1579259169.0,"1) First job in IT, just do your best. Dont stop taking courses, learning more is key.
You cant solve everything. Dont over do it. 
Learn from your mistakes, but more importantly learn from others. Ask around everything until you nail your job.
 
2) Start looking for other jobs once you have at least 6 months experience. IT is a slow climb with a lot of sidegrades. You dont want to burn your will to work in a bad environment (if things go wrong). 

3) Be proactive, just dont fix things that aint broken yet. You see a future issue, lay low and start trying to figure how to solve it. 

4) try to talk in different levels. You may deal with tech people and normal people. Try to be clear and reduce the tech vocabulary to a minimum. Being understood is far more important than playing it cool/iknoweverything guy.

5) deal with being an IT. Everyone will have an issue with their thingy that want you to fix. Do one favor and you may do a thousand more. Your top priority is to do what you are payed for. Secondly what your manager or boss may ask out of you, and lastly whatever you want to help with. Keep that order tight or you will be taking a look on that nice old lady fridge that does a weird sound while your phone is on fire.

6) Have fun. For me IT work is fun, hence not a work anymore. Try to find yourself in a spot where you are payed to do what you like. Just dont be so obvious about it.  Haha. Congrats on your first IT job and hope its a good one."

They are taking advantage of your half minded resolution, and please dont take this wrong, but you sound like you have no idea who you are and how you came up to this very moment. Its on you, it always was. That said, if job market is empty, and you ran out of money, just work. Imho, you are not understanding where you stand, i'd start there. Clear your mind. Evaluate pro-cons, take a desition, commit. If it backfires, bite the bullet. 
It wont be easy, but it never is."
