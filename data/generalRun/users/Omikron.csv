nextfuckinglevel,ffdi3js,t1_ffcfgg7,1579821335.0,Well you're wrong about chess even. I hate to break it to you but some people are fucking stupid. There's an iq bell curve and plenty of people are on the left hand side... Far on the left hand side. Stop kidding yourself.
interestingasfuck,ffdh5cr,t3_esvdwv,1579820759.0,I mean your first one is still  million times better than I could ever do
nextfuckinglevel,ffcgzvr,t1_ffc5f9e,1579799262.0,"I don't agree, I guess I look at talent as a combination of physical attributes and hard work etc. I'm not a talented singer just because I work hard and I'm not a talented basketball player either. What are you judging talent against then? I may be the absolute best basketball player I could ever be but so what if I couldn't even make a scrub college team? Just because I worked hard doesn't mean I'm talented."
QuotesPorn,ffc3af8,t3_esqqth,1579790477.0,So is anarchy the only true freedom then? This seems like kind of a myopic quote.
RelayForReddit,ffc36ua,t3_esfy9l,1579790404.0,100% agree. It's terrible especially in bad light.

nextfuckinglevel,ffc2e2q,t1_ffbri9s,1579789821.0,Improvement is fine and absolutely possible... But telling people that anyone with enough training can be one of the three tenors is fucking stupid and not remotely true.
nextfuckinglevel,ffc2aei,t1_ffbrd55,1579789747.0,No I said some talent is natural born just like physical traits. Singers vocal chords for example. No amount of hard work is going to make me sound like Pavarotti.
television,ffbt4ei,t1_ffbpp8k,1579781777.0,Yeah that's definitely false.

nextfuckinglevel,ffbrmqw,t1_ffbpyvf,1579780051.0,How can you possibly think the same thing that applies to physical ability doesn't apply to brains? There's a bell curve for a reason and 50 percent of the world is on the left side of it. Stop pretending that every single person on earth is born exactly equal. It's a stupid argument.
nextfuckinglevel,ffbrg28,t1_ffbjjhb,1579779823.0,Prove to me that interest isn't genetics? Maybe some people are simply incapable of focusing on one thing for countless hours.

nextfuckinglevel,ffbr94k,t1_ffbqp6m,1579779585.0,Yeah all these people saying hardwork is all need are fucking crazy.
nextfuckinglevel,ffbr7uc,t1_ffbp0iu,1579779542.0,Omg of course you are. Genetic composition is talent. I could train for countless hours and I'd never be LeBron James. Natural ability is a huge part of success.

TrueAskReddit,ff5tfh6,t3_ers5hv,1579609577.0,Life is basically a complex decision tree. When you're young simple decisions like where to go. To college and what to study carry enormous weight and have monumental impacts on your future life. As you get older your decisions slowly have less and less impact as your life becomes more set and there are less paths left on the tree.
