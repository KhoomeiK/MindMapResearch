P.S. I agree, fuck Trump"

aww,fgusuyb,t1_fgu63ud,1581128652.0,This is who immediately came to mind.  The first time I read about him I bawled like a baby because his level of devotion is what I want to achieve.

xxfitness,fgrgrls,t1_fgrfvym,1581046423.0,"Thank you!  I’ll give you an example of my squat ratchets this week - 

The protocol was 3 X 3-2-1 starting at 85% of 3RM (281).  After each mini-set, increase (ratchet up) by 5lbs (interval weight).  Once you’ve completed one full set of 3-2-1, decrease (ratchet down) by 5lbs (interval weight) to start next set and increase by 5lbs between each mini-set.  My full ratchet this week was as follows:

3 at 239, 2 at 244, 1 at 249

3 at 244, 2 at 249, 1 at 254

3 at 249, 2 at 254, 1 at 259

Earlier in the cycle, the ratchets were 5-4-3, at lower percentages.   You can change the interval weight, but you should keep it consistent across all ratchet sets.  For instance my deadlift interval weight this cycle is 7lbs.  Maybe next cycle I’ll try 10lbs.  I can’t speak highly enough of this programming.  

Good luck!!"
xxfitness,fgrfkru,t3_eztmal,1581045592.0,"I follow a percentage-based ratchet program after following Juggernaut for years and plateauing.  If you’re serious about strength gains, I’ve found ratchets to have the most impact.  As long as my back and CNS hold up I’m hoping for a 1RM PR to conclude this cycle in 6ish weeks.  Last cycle, I PRed my deadlift and shoulder press with this ratchet-based program."
behindthebastards,fgreubi,t1_fgrced6,1581045083.0,Rational and kind.  You will find a fit as long as you stay true to yourself.  Thank you for your grace.  Good night.
xxfitness,fgrb4rz,t3_f03fti,1581042532.0,"My guess is, unfortunately, a lack of consistency.  I have been going to the gym consistently for almost 15 years and about every six weeks something hits me hard.  For instance, a long set of BW squats (50 or so unbroken) will kill me, if I haven’t been consistently doing long sets.  

You also seem quad-dominant.  Try to settle back a bit more and focus on your hamstrings and other big movers.  Lunges, loaded and unloaded, get me in the tushy every time, regardless of the number.  

Additionally, your adductors may need some work.  Oftentimes, problems originate further upstream from the site of discomfort.  

If you could fit in another day, it may be helpful."
behindthebastards,fgr9ard,t1_fgqkmoq,1581041284.0,"You’re right and I am sorry.  I was a mean asshole and I apologize.   I was put off by your post for completely irrational reasons.   I deleted the comment.  

I hope you continue to enjoy the podcast.  I started from the beginning and am almost caught up to present time.  It makes my commutes much more enjoyable."

PlantedTank,fgknhlf,t3_eyhu3q,1580869551.0,"I chose my Fluval Flex 9 for some specific reasons:
1. Space.  I designed and built my house in a specific manner.  With all of the bookshelves lining the walls there is very little space to put a tank.
2. Equipment is hidden and wires can easily be hidden (I’m very picky about this.  I don’t want to see how my tank filters and I don’t want to see where your wall-mounted TV is plugged in)
3.  I am very dedicated to my pets and given that I have six cats, four dogs, a bunch of chickens, stray cats, and opossums to take care of I wanted something easy to take care of.  When I was a teenager my father and I had a 180 gallon reef tank; it was a lot of work and the internet barely existed so it was hard to get a lot of info."
Aquariums,fgkime5,t1_fgjf7x3,1580866421.0,"Yes, 9 gallons.  In hindsight I wished I’d gotten the 15 gallon Fluval Flex.  Next tank will be the FF 15.  I don’t have much space for a tank and I am quite particular about seeing the equipment."

Technically it’s done cycling so I’m just adding maintenance ammonia in the mornings.  This is my first tank as an adult and I’m very excited."
