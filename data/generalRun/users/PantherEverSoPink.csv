You know, that'sa good idea with the breakfast club to get him to settle into the school day. Have you considered taking to the special needs teacher at school about his anxiety and fidgiting? Not because he's necessarily ""special needs"" but because they could support him with ways to manage the fidgits and giggles etc (I mean, who didn't fidgit and fickle as a child, but there you go this is the world we live in now) and of his anxiety interferes with his learning then he might have an additional need that they could help with while he's young - additional need as in just needing a bit of help is what I mean, rather than like something that has a diagnosis or a label attached to it. They might be able to help with that maybe? And would he do better with another teacher perhaps? Just throwing thoughts out there, you know your child of course.

Yeah, and isolation room or not, you can't just expell a child like that, it's not allowed. If you're not happy with what the head comes up with, governors and local authority next in my opinion. But it'll hopefully blow over.

I can have a Google and find the Dept for Education documentation of the rules etc if needed, if you want to let us know how it goes tomorrow. Night."
UKParenting,ff735qs,t3_es01xb,1579640189.0,"That all sounds horrible.

Erm, it sounds like the school has done a few things wrong, if it has gone from isolation room to exclusion, all for some low level misbehaviour. I'm assuming they're a normal state school (""Academy"" doesn't mean anything special in this respect).

Is it possible the teacher is just trying to scare him? Because you can't be expected to take him to a new school as of tomorrow. Maybe call the teacher's bluff and stay at home tomorrow having a lovely mother and son day, let things settle down and have some time to yourselves?

Firstly, they can't permanently exclude a child without doing a number of other things first. If schools could do that they would kick out every naughty child.

There should have been meetings about your son's behaviour and some shorter fixed term exclusions if that didn't work, but exclusions have to be for something proper - swearing at a teacher, hitting another child, bringing illegal items on site etc. It's possible he could be disrupting the whole class by being silly but even then you should be called to a meeting, not getting exclusions.

And the new school won't be expecting you, as you know, you have up apply to a school and be accepted, you can't just walk in. This is what makes me think the teacher is making this up.

Talk to the head by all means, try to keep your cool when you do. Even better, maybe write a letter. Just set everything down and while you are aware that your son's behaviour can sometimes be seen as disruptive and you would welcome support with him, you do not think a permanent exclusion would be in the interest of him or the school. Also contact the governors. There should be something on the website, or just phone the school and ask for the email address for the chair of governors.

But the more I think about it, the more I think he can't have been excluded just like that. These things have to go to the governors and you have 15 working days to appeal. Maybe await the phone call and ask for an explanation as to what's actually happened.

Good luck, I hope things get better soon x"

If you were in London as a child of course you were less worried about the world at large than now as an adult. We're all more terrified now than we were when we were five, or even twenty five. It's one of the shit things about getting older.

The IRA committed several major acts of terrorism on the UK mainland, for example blowing a chunk out of a major shopping centre on Mother's Day weekend, and trying to murder the prime minister at least once. I'm not sure what you would count as acts of war as opposed to acts of terrorism but civilians were definitely targeted, for example by bombs in train stations.

I mean if we're going to get into nomenclature, every terrorist is a freedom fighter to someone else in the world. You don't think the IRA were terrorists, well ok, whatever.

UKParenting,fdigc6n,t3_eldidy,1578442272.0,"Looks like chicken pox to me. My son's started flat then looked like the picture, then without 12 hours were big.

PoxClin is good for itching, personally I found calamine to be messy and don't think it helped much. Oat baths (porridge in a muslin bag, let her play in the bath as long as she's happy. Only Calpol, no Neurofen/ibuprofen.

Think about who's going to stay home to take care of her and let the relevant workplaces know that your child has chicken pox, you're looking at around two weeks of poorly iirc.

You can gently explain, even to a very young child, that they shouldn't scratch and offer alternatives like scratching a toy instead or very gently brushing your hands in the area to try and relieve it.

It might ""only""be chicken pox but keep an eye on her. In rare cases it can turn serious, and you should always monitor a child with fever. My son's pox was nasty, he was covered and we were in and out of the doctors, just to make sure he was ok. They didn't mind, especially when they saw how bad it was. If you think she needs the doctor take her even for peace of mind.

Get some Peppa pig recorded and prepare to spend a lot of time at a beside. Hope that helps, good luck!"
Frugal,fdic7x4,t1_fdhxlv3,1578439629.0,"It's not even about fashion though. Like, when I had a factory job, I wore trainers, they were a bit grubby but it didn't matter, because I was packing in a warehouse. When customer facing, I can't imagine that trainers - however clean - would be considered smart. It's not about fashion, it's about..... Like how can you let someone wear trainers but be picky about them being clean? It's like saying ""cut off shorts are fine but not if they're faded"". I'm just confused."

unitedkingdom,fddz5kl,t1_fddxupc,1578327496.0,"I know, I wasn't making myself clear. He may have found it easier to lure men than perhaps women, because it's drilled into us (women) that we should always be wary of being attacked - heck it's almost made out to be a woman's fault sometimes for not keeping herself safe. But it's not drilled into young men in then same way, no one would have thought 'wait, is he safe' if they saw their mate leaving a club with this guy. Perhaps we need to teach young people about personal safety in a different way."
unitedkingdom,fddun41,t1_fddqtx1,1578324393.0,"This is probably not a popular opinion. But women have it drummed into them from a young age that they have to be very careful who they accept drinks from, who they go home with etc etc. Men, not so much. People in their late teens/early twenties aren't the most sensible in the world either. And this guy is small and doesn't ""look"" like what some of us think a rapist looks like. With those factors combined, it was maybe easier for this guy to find victims than it should have been.

It's not their fault this happened. But I'm hoping this case will act as a warning about personal safety to young people for years to come, just because you're a guy, just because the other guy looks harmless, just because it's been a fun night so far, doesn't mean you can do unsafe things.

LegalAdviceUK,fdb1m40,t1_fd9vvjt,1578252668.0,"Well.....not legal advice, but steal his phone, delete the videos and then stand over him holding a rolling pin and threaten to call the police unless he deletes it from the cloud while you watch. Tell your mum, threaten to tell his employer, and get a lock for your door. Find some cash and get him a psychologist. That's all common sense, but you're on a legal advice sub so I'm guessing you want to take some kind of legal action and need advice on that.....?

Also, this might not be your call to make, the crime is arguably more against your girlfriend than you, so if she wants the police involved her opinion should probably count."

CasualConversation,fd5jcyl,t3_ejze2e,1578178234.0,"I'm trying to think of the alternative word that you could have used. I will happily substitute ""chair"" for ""chairman"" and ""humankind"" for ""mankind""etc, but there's a conversation to be had - it's not directly sexist as such but always referring to things relating to humans as ""man"" this or that gears language in a certain way and when we consider the impact that language has on individual thought and wider culture, it's something worth thinking about.

But your teacher should have (gasp) used this as an opportunity to teach, perhaps making a correction and talking to you about it, not marking you down. See if you can swallow your pride a little (not that you're really in the wrong) and see if you can bring yourself to ask the teacher for a deeper explanation and if there's an alternative to the phrase ""man hours"" then great, we can all learn from that. ""Working hours"" maybe, but that means something else. ""People hours"" would sound silly. But they're the English teacher, they'll know better than me."
