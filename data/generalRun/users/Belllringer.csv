I posted a second of this before but,omg,the outcome! I tried to order the new coconuts set on release, weeks prior to Christmas. I got the item in my basket and it would not process the sale. I emailed colourpop and took a photo of it in my basket and explained! They would not honor their error ( saying it’s” sold out but keep your eyes open)and sell me one which is the first sign. 
Thats horrid customer service since I buy item from them and I had the photo and emailed them around midnight when it dropped.

Christmas arrived and I was away and received a text message saying the order was on it’s way to be delivered. I called CP and explained I did not order it and got no receipt or submitted a purchase since the attempt nor home to receive it. At this point, I couldn’t afford it and had given all info and reported the incident to them.
I sent a family member over to grab it on delivery notification.I live in the city on a main road so many times the post can’t get into the building and leave stuff at the door on the sidewalk. We all grab stuff&7& for e/o. 
I called CP and said nothing was received nor ordered yet I WAS CHARGED. Without my consent. They were uninterested. So finally, many months(3+)7 told me to go to the post and file a missing item report and  they would look into it. This seems completely crazy to me. I don’t feel I should have to go do this & I never charged anything! I did pay with ppal and put in a dispute but did not get my money back and I do not understand and ppl is impossible to deal with as well.
I am so exhausted and frustrated I just had to be heard. I detest them and I was a loyal customer! I saw someone reply(before my post was taken down for posting in the wrong spot-sorry)that the order obv went through and I had intended to buy it a month earlier so it was on me, I reply too much time had passed. If I wanted an item a month(+)ago that doesn’t mean if it appears I want it after the fact. My intention in calling with the screenshot was to purchase the item and I was clearly was told no. I rightfully figured case closed.
I just need to be heard"
