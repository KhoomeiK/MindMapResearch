relationships,ffe8lid,t3_et4i1z,1579839670.0,"Sweetie, I am so sorry & can't imagine what this would do to my head in your position. Let me ask you this. Does she love YOU or the lifestyle & freedom you afford her? She's treating her husband/best friend like crap & doesn't seem aware that she is doing & saying hurtful & confusing things. She wants what she wants, but doesn't seem to care about your wants. Or feelings. Plus the whole ""she can't imagine her life without you"" is such a mixed message.  It almost sounds like she's pushing you to file for divorce. I don't know what state you're in but could there be a legal benefit to her if you were to you file? Hello, she's having affairs, says she's no longer in love with you (or is it just sex with you? I'm having bad memory day) so does she want a divorce, or does she just want to continue this free ride with you as a roommate? Or is she close to getting her degree & doesn't need you much longer? 

You need to take a step back and ask yourself some tough questions. Talk to a counselor ALONE before even considering couples counseling. You need to decide what YOU want."
depression,ffdyv8l,t1_ffdqe6x,1579832354.0,Thank you! I enjoyed reading this. You have an effortless-seeming flow to your writing. Now I'm got that pee-streaming visual in my head and a quirky smile on my lips. Cheers!

Glad you're journaling the emotional stuff, but definitely add what you are eating now and when! You'd be amazed at what unexpected patterns you might notice. Plus, with brain fog, I've honestly had to look back in my journal at times to remember, ""oh yeah, that's an easy food, how did I forget that?!?"" Especially before grocery shopping when my mind blanks or nothing sounds good or easy. 

Good luck! I wish you continued success and much less frustration!"
