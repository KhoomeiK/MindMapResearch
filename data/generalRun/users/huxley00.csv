AskMen,ffh6685,t1_fffutr6,1579924202.0,I think the filler is the best part of the show. I love goddam monster of the week stuff. Even with the x files the filler random episodes were always the best.
AskMen,ffh5xp2,t1_fffgdtm,1579924013.0,Wasn’t the governor season later down the road? I thought that was possibly the best season of all.
Testosterone,ffgad8v,t1_ffga904,1579901893.0,"Reminds me of working out, everyone has different things that work and we're all looking for some magic person to come tell us what works best for us, so we can just do it and get the results.

All this fun trial and error, I think that is one thing most people hate about TRT, all the wondering."
Testosterone,ffg9cub,t1_ffg9208,1579901269.0,"Maybe I will try ditching the AI altogether as well.

We also live a social life as my partner has a marketing business. This often involves drinks, which is also supposed to be a mess for E2, I'm sure that doesn't help."
Testosterone,ffg8v6i,t1_ffg8is8,1579900967.0,"24mg every morning, swap injection sites between IM and sub-q.

Yep, I still like it, nice to have energy and interest in sex. I was a shell before.

That being said, I liked how I looked more physically before TRT. I was more lean (less strong by far, but I liked my lean/cut look with some muscle). 

Its nice being strong but I also realize it's mostly just guys who care about it and I generally just care about what girls think. Being fit but thin and tall is what I was before and if I could drop TRT while feeling good, I probably would."
Testosterone,ffg84im,t1_ffg7uv5,1579900513.0,"> Everyone is different though.

I think that's the hard part, we are all quite different and I often find I tend to be an outlier to most as it comes to response to a lot of things.

My E2 tends to be in the mid 20s. As I was saying, when I drop to 140mg, problem solves itself and I look much better but my pep goes down, morning wood goes down and performance in gym becomes much worse.

I've cycled off and on my AI as well, usually based completely on how I'm feeling. I do not use the AI when I go lower dose though.

Hard to know what to do..."
Testosterone,ffg7gj9,t1_ffg71kz,1579900098.0,"Sure, I'll take a look. I did use some BPC when I had a tendon injury and had great results. Always looking for new things to make the ol' body feel better and look better."
Testosterone,ffg7e9y,t1_ffg7699,1579900059.0,"Yep, I do an AI regularly, all my levels look good.

I do inject everyday and do a total of about 180mg/week.

If I go down to 140mg/week, bloating is mostly gone, but I don't feel as good, so it's hard to decide which is worse."
Testosterone,ffg7082,t1_fffqrte,1579899817.0,"Could absolutely be true but the timing does seem to be highly coincidental. 

I think the little bloating is honestly what impacts my looks the most."
Testosterone,ffg5kbc,t1_ffg4flv,1579898928.0,"I haven't, it seems like HGH tends to lead to great recovery and youth, but your head seems to start growing as well? Lot of guys like Joe Rogan use it and their noggins have grown to insane sizes.

I have not done anything with peptides, any resources you've used?"

If you work in IT, you never work in the nice area, as you're basically akin to janitorial supplies to a business.

For instance, my company built a new building. We have no sales team as its not in our business model.

They put Marketing, Customer Service and other random departments in the new building with all the windows.

Guess where IT goes? Old building from 1950 with hardly any windows.

Don't get your hopes up kid."

aww,fffinnm,t1_fffibwa,1579884785.0,I get what you're saying.
aww,fffgk24,t1_fffemhv,1579883486.0,"Yep! I would say they have a lot of similarities to sloths. Fairly docile, slow moving and spend most of their time in the trees. They also consume foods that no other animals do, so their food line is fairly safe.

Oh yeah, it's super cute. They're adorable creatures.

> Next time you comment on r/aww remember that this is for cute things that make people's days feel a little bit better when they scroll here and, while knowledge is appreciated, talking down to people isn't. Everyone's just trying to put a smile on their face and not call each other dumb.

I definitely see what you're saying...so you're basically saying if it's wrong or false info, just go along with it because the point of the sub is to feel good and not to necessarily be accurate, essentially?"
Testosterone,fffe08s,t3_et941t,1579881886.0,"Absolutely, I looked incredibly youthful at 35, uncannily so.

I'm 38 now and on TRT for 3 years. Face has a tad more bloat, hair is a tad drier and I just notice I don't look as good as I used to."
stopdrinking,fffdads,t3_etbdxe,1579881432.0,"I actually found my depression was more tied to low testosterone (apathy, tired all the time, no meaning to anything).

sysadmin,fff8nx0,t3_esuvzu,1579878465.0,"When I turned 32, this is what I started doing on my vacations.

1. Delete my mail app from my phone.

2. Send all calls straight to voicemail and never return them.

What have been the repercussions for me? Nothing at all except a more enjoyable vacation.

Not to mention you're obviously the key person they need and seem completely indisposable at this point (and should leave and get paid more anyway)."
AskMenOver30,fff6ls7,t3_et6jse,1579877027.0,"Pretty easily, but mainly because we chose to not have kids. 

Also, I try to never say no to anything no matter if I want to do it or not.

A friend wants to get a drink after work? I don't really want to, but I say yes anyway and end up enjoying it.

Saying no to things because you're tired is a surefire way to 'no' your way out of all your interpersonal relationship and wonder why no one calls anymore."
AskMenOver30,fff6h26,t3_esxzf4,1579876932.0,"Just ask people questions and stop having opinions on things, that solves almost all issues.

i.e.

Someone is talking about Iraq and Trump, they ask you what you think, you just repeat it back to them and ask what they think.

People like talking about themselves. For many people, it's their favorite thing.

Same tip also works on first/second dates really well."
AskMenOver30,fff5wgs,t1_fff5n9g,1579876516.0,"Let me check that list here...alrighty, I think we got an ad hominem here fellas."
AskMenOver30,fff4vd9,t1_fff3zfm,1579875755.0,"> So, you can't defend that your using strawman arguments, and instead have switched to ad hominem. So you really have no actual evidence, just a really weird notion of what people who are into astrology are like.

No surprise that you spout out freshman debate terms like you know what they mean or how to use them. Let me just give you a quick link so you can look up ones that you think support your argument.

Not to mention there is no personal attack here, so try to stop sounding clever like you know what 'ad hominem' even means in context.

> Same could be said of a calendar of daily aphorisms, inspirational quotes, or fortune cookies. Silly ways to rethink your life or situation.

Wrong. There are not structured belief systems around fortune cookies, inspirational quotes or daily aphorisms. I'm sure you can probably find a logical fallacy that fits your argument here, probably something along the lines of a false equivalency. 

> You want me to provide evidence that proves a negative? Yes, we both know there is no evidence that tracks every single person and their decision making. But there might be evidence showing people using astrology that have negatively impacted their lives. And yet you don't have any....

Sure, I can provide you one with even the most simple of searches. Here is a youtube channel from an astrologist on chart reading and applying it to your life with 300k subscribers. 
https://www.youtube.com/user/ALLAREONE2012

Just waiting for your argument where you say 300k people subscribing to a channel about using astrology in your life somehow doesn't mean they actually do. *eyeroll*

> So given you don't have evidence, what makes you so sure you're right about this and I'm a ""brainwashed zealot1"".

1) in this case, brainwashed zealot means someone who doesn't believe in astrology, but thinks its a silly thing that's fun to think about, while basing no real decisions on what it says.

You're not a brainwashed zealot, just supporting brainwashed zealotry as a safe and harmless practice. What's also weird is that you claim to not believe in astrology, now you say you do believe in astrology and it's fun to think about, even if you're not sure you really believe in it.

How can anything you say be trusted when you're already going against things you said previously? Use that handy link to find out what type of argument fallacy applies when someone lies to make their current position seem stronger, later."

television,fff2v37,t3_eolibb,1579874213.0,"I tell everyone they may hate the show but I love it. If you don't know the source material, my guess is it's not going to be good for those people, unless they really like fantasy worlds."
AskMenOver30,fff1zhz,t1_ffez6w8,1579873511.0,"Lmao, the guy supporting Astrology is spouting out words like “strawman”, the irony is almost too much to handle. The whole argument for Astrology is around supporting a strawman argument around the reality of space magic.

The idea doesn’t have to be inherently stated to be intuited. Astrology provides a reason for why you feel the way you do. That alone gives validation to not changing the way you feel because it validates the way you feel. If you know terms like “strawman” I’m sure you can fathom what a self fulfilling prophecy is.

So you’re saying that people don’t live their life and make actions based on astrological information? That’s literally what following astrology is dude. I think I’d love to see your citation where people aren’t doing exactly this...but we both know it doesn’t exist."
