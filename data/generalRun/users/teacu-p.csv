fatlogic,fcu1bvn,t1_fctyxc6,1577969212.0,"sure, but that’s why specific accounts and pages are made targeted at each of these audiences. there are ED recovery pages posting things like this and (healthy) weight loss pages posting wildly different things - it’s all about the context & intention. this subreddit (often unintentionally, yet still harmfully) takes these posts out of context to make positive messages sometimes look bad from a specific perspective. context is very important :)

also - pages that post these kind of things for those in recovery are actually super important and should be listened to (for those in recovery)!! often, since it’s costly to see professionals every week or two, many will rely on positive messages and reminders like this one to maintain their progress. it’s half the reason I myself haven’t lost all hope at times; logging onto instagram floods me with posts like this and make it impossible to ignore these affirmations."
fatlogic,fctkw7i,t1_fctj87y,1577947008.0,agree. & lots of this subreddit is super great for someone with an eating disorder and is very clearly aimed at that audience and is being taken out of context by being posted here
