books,ffpr3oi,t1_ffpr0up,1580102730.0,"I just went back to the actual post [with data](https://news.gallup.com/poll/284009/library-visits-outpaced-trips-movies-2019.aspx) and it's not actually as dramatic as 2x but still! For a sub that loves reading, no one actually read past the title! 62% of respondents visited the library vs 73% visited the movies."
books,ffppqpe,t1_ffox4bw,1580101466.0,"It's also incorrect that more people visit libraries than movie theaters. 1.3 billion library visits is greater than 1.2 billion movie tickets, sure. But the data shows that the average person visits the library 10.5 times, as compared to 5.3 movie visits. 1.3bil/10.5<1.2bil/5.3. ~~Twice as many people visit the movies as the library.~~ Libraries are valuable resources and we love them, but I don't understand how everyone is ignoring this.

Edit: It's not 2x (that oversimplifies the stats), but more people do visit the movies. Data is in the link at the bottom of [this page](https://news.gallup.com/poll/284009/library-visits-outpaced-trips-movies-2019.aspx)"
books,ffpo8hi,t1_ffnplz0,1580100149.0,"Edit: Actually, scroll down and click the link at the bottom of [this page with the actual data](https://news.gallup.com/poll/284009/library-visits-outpaced-trips-movies-2019.aspx). 38% of people did not visit the library, while 27% of people did not visit the movie theater. More people visited the movie theater. 

The title is misleading. More people did not visit the library than the movie theater.

1.3 billion visits to the library, with an average number of visits per person of ~10.

1.2 billion movie tickets sold, with an average of ~5 movie visits per person.

Correct me if I'm wrong but wouldnt this mean that more people visit the movies, but people who visit the library visit more frequently."
dogs,ffgdjk2,t1_fffqp4d,1579903843.0,"I also live in a city and I see it daily. It's only been a major problem once. A dog ran up to mine while she was sniffing something. Owner insisted he was friendly. Dog then sniffs whatever my dog was sniffing, became protective of whatever it was, bit my dog in the face, and then stood snarling and lunging at us once I picked mine up. The owner did nothing. My dog is a 50lb pit mix and this one was a probably 20lb terrier/chihuahua thing, so the damage was superficial. But now my very friendly dog hides behind me when she sees dogs that look like that one."
IAmA,ff2kwhn,t1_ff23dud,1579510900.0,"This is also anecdotal, but my grandmother donated a kidney to my uncle when she was 50. She had recurrent kidney problems until she died (of cancer) in her early 70s. She had some pretty strict dietary/medication restrictions, similar to what OP mentioned in another comment. She had no follow-up medical care past the first few months after donation. She told me that she didn't regret the decision to donate because her son's life was at stake, but that if she'd felt she had a choice, she would not have donated. This was decades ago, so modern medicine has probably improved since."

She also once ate a 2 lb bag of twizzlers. She has a sensitive stomach/food allergies so I was expecting the worst, but all it did was turn her poop red. No allergens in twizzlers, I guess."
EatCheapAndHealthy,fev1u8y,t3_eql4ei,1579392165.0,"If you're a spice-lover, try soondubu! It's one of my favorite meals. I don't have a recipe off the top of my head and I usually end up altering them anyway. I've never been a big fan of firm tofu. It just tastes so... dusty. But silken tofu doesn't have as strong a flavor, I love the texture, and it's great in soups.

My favorite way to eat firm tofu is with spicy peanut sauce and noodles. The sauce I make is usually a mix of peanut butter, shoyu, rice vinegar, sesame oil, maple syrup or sugar, and chili oil, but I've seen a lot of variations. Pan fry the tofu in little cubes until brown on all sides, add on top of spaghetti or other noodles, pour sauce over."

PublicFreakout,feeomes,t1_feentlc,1579037983.0,It happened in 1984. The dad didn't serve any jail time and has since passed away. [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_Plauche)
Dogtraining,fdyfbe3,t3_enddio,1578779128.0,"Is there a way you can keep them separated for a while to give him a chance to adjust? Maybe a baby gate in a doorway so they can still see each other, but they can't end up in situations where your new one is feeling threatened enough to snap?

My older dog has always loved playing with other dogs/puppies, but when we brought home a puppy, she was freaked out. She never got aggressive because she's a huge wimp, but she was definitely *off* for a couple weeks. Being in a new home with a new (to him) puppy has to be stressful for your new guy.

In the end, if it doesn't work out, it's okay to bring him back to the shelter. He may need to be in a home without other dogs or cats (him attacking a cat shows a history of aggression). If your home isn't a safe/comfortable environment for him, or for your puppy while he's there, then it's best that he has a chance to find one that is."
