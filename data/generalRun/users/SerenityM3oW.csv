bodyweightfitness,ferevwt,t3_eq7gau,1579353082.0,It's normal but don't don't have to do nothing either while you are recovering.   Do some yoga to stretch out those sore muscles.  It's a great overall compliment to weight training.  Do some lower body exercises which you didn't do..and when your legs hurt you won't be paying as much attention to your upper body and abs. :).  Happy training!

PetTheDamnDog,feo2qae,t1_feo00um,1579294297.0,My Boston Terriers have no issues breathing or with the heat.  They also don't snore at all.   Their snouts are longer.   The AKC standard for the dogs is gross but there are plenty of breeders who breed for health and the longer snouts.   Most of the Boston's I see around as pets have the longer snout.    Even a variety of pug is being bred for health rather than the visual standard.   They are called retro mops and they are cute as hell.

bodyweightfitness,femyln5,t1_felrevy,1579272934.0,I really don't think a visible vein in the arm would be a good indicator of overall body fat since most people don't have fat evenly distributed.   Usually they hold it in the mid section/ hips/thighs.   Where did that idea come from?

Their life span is average 12-15years and there are retro mops that are making a resurgence. They are pugs bred to have a longer snout and fewer health issues.
