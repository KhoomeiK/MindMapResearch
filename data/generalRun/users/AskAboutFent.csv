That has absolutely nothing to do with the government. It's entirely on the ultra-wealthy.

You have to have bought into all the capitalist propaganda that capitalism is the only way and unchecked capitalism is best.

Except it's not. Because in a capitalist society, it makes sense for businesses to underpay workers because everybody needs a job so they can eat.

If the population is **required** to have a job then businesses get the chance to pay their workers less.

Sure, their workers probably can't even afford the product they are making, but there are enough people doing ok that can so it works out for them.

TooAfraidToAsk,fdym8al,t1_fdykxls,1578781281.0,"Planning an event out makes sense. Planning a CONVERSATION as simple as going to the store is NOT an event. There is no reason to be so panicked about something so mundane. That leads me to believe its attached to anxiety. 

And driving isnt mundane. You're going down the road fast enough to instantly kill anybody you hit and jerking the wheel will almost certainly end with you in an accident. 

A conversation about returning something to the store is mundane."
TooAfraidToAsk,fdydtk2,t1_fdwox3s,1578778667.0,"Why is everyone saying this is normal? I've never once done it and I dont know anybody who does. It seems to be tied to an anxiety disorder as simply talking to somebody shouldnt instil that kind of fear to the point where you have to rehearse. 

Its not a performance. 

This is most definitely not normal. 

A lot of people do it, yes, but that doesnt make it ""normal"""
