cats,ffdyl9r,t3_et3mcn,1579832155.0,Actually dry food isn’t good for them. They’re not naturally inclined to drink a lot of water - they get most of their hydration from their food - so dry food is a strain on their kidneys. It’s also typically very carb-heavy which is not easy for their bodies to metabolize and can lead to excess weight gain. Kitties are obligate carnivores.

orangetheory,ffaeb35,t1_ffa78zl,1579733612.0,So glad I’m not alone in my love for pop jacks! Everyone else at my studio gripes about them. Give me pop jacks and BOSU burpees all day.
