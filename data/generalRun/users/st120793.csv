Ah man, that sucks :( What has helped you to go on or has helped on some level to deal with it?

Don't feel obliged to reply :p"
depression,fde86r0,t1_fde7we6,1578333303.0,Yeah it's the same reason I haven't sought help myself :). How long have you been dealing with depression?
depression,fde7oeh,t3_ekxewk,1578332982.0,Yeah I think I feel you - it's difficult to give an articulate answer as to why you feel depressed which makes it harder to overcome or atleast deal with in some way. I think this is a big reason why professional therapy is sometimes recommended - it gives you a better chance to understand your depression. I haven't done it myself but maybe this is something you can consider if you haven't done so already?
depression,fde64s7,t3_eksxke,1578332018.0,Thoughts are with you - hope it all works out :)
depression,fcvwvw1,t3_eizsdo,1578011936.0,"You just gotta have faith that things will get better. I know you'll probably find that difficult to believe at this moment in your life but just try and keep going my friend. One thing that has been helping me recently is cutting down on self-hate and just shitty thoughts in general. 

Try and find something that you actually enjoy doing - anything that numbs you a little and makes you less depressed. Maybe watch some documentaries on wildlife - animals have a way of making things seem less gloomy and meaningless.

I know how bleak life can appear at times so I'm not really sure what to say but I hope things get better for you, whoever and wherever you are!"
introvert,fcvvdah,t3_ej3y9k,1578010951.0,Thanks for posting this - it seems like very good advice (sorry that you had to learn it the hard way).
