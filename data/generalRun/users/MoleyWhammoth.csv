I've also been trying to wrap my head around a way to get cannabis/hemp into beer and cider... I've done some experiments with different kinds of tincture, with some success and one glaring drawback. Wanna swap notes?"

canadients,fdxyqhv,t1_fdxbbo6,1578774243.0,"You are correct that I neglected to include compassionate pricing. However, I also neglected to include GST, PST, or the Excise Tax. 

(from [https://emeraldhealth.ca/en/for-patients/compassionate-pricing](https://emeraldhealth.ca/en/for-patients/compassionate-pricing) ) - ""Our compassionate pricing program offers 30% off the price of dried marijuana and 20% off the price of our cannabis oil products.""

So let's break it down:

 BC PST is 7%, GST is 5%,  and the Cannabis excise tax is 10%. Altogether, that is a 22% taxation rate.

Compassionate pricing on oils is 20% off.

Additionally, VCBC prices as stated are final sales price after tax. There is no further markup. 

20% discount < 22% tax markup. So, that $51.22 figure is actually slightly low.

You didn't answer my question as to your preference - would you rather go 4 days in heavy pain just to go one day without? This is the outcome of your own argument."

canadients,fdsbutb,t1_fds0qrf,1578699032.0,">Regulations did not remove access for anyone. Buy edible oil directly from an LP

The cost of the medicine IS the barrier.

one brownie (\~500mg THC) is $10 from VCBC. 

An equivalent dose of LP indica cannabis oil (I chose Emerald Health Therapeutics for the sake of argument. Feel free to substitute your own example) would be 20.49 ml, at a cost of $51.22. 

$75/bottle. 30ml per bottle. 24.4 mg THC/ml. 

500mg / 24.4 mg/ml = 20.49ml. 

$75 \* ( 20.49/30 ml ) = $51.22 per dose. 

So, I would have to go without medicine for four days, just to have it for one day.

How would you feel about going the next four heavy pain days without meds?"

&#x200B;

To answer your incorrect statemennts - all VCBC products are definitely tested. Almost of all of their products (with the exclusion of bud) have labels declaring the tested potency. But don't take my word for it... from VCBC's website: [https://vcbc.live/pamphlets/](https://vcbc.live/pamphlets/)

What good is regulation, rugles, if the regulation removes access to the medicine by those that need it? 

Regulations don't treat my chronic pain. 500mg edibles do. But those regulations of yours would force me to eat 50 10mg brownies to achieve that dose. 

When was the last time you ate 50 brownies in one sitting?"
