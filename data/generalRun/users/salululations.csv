Women secually assault men at roughly the same rate men sexually assault women.

'rape' as a crime statistics usually requires penetration to take place,so of course women who sexually assault men are less likely to *penetrate* their victims than men who sexually assault women are."

The default is *what exists by default*

That includes people of various races, genders, sexes and sexualities.

There is no alteration going on to make someone queer, they are queer by default.

Default doesn't imply something is self sustaining, capable of reproduction or anything else like that.
That is an unfounded value judgement you are making."

That chapter begins with Jesus specifically being asked about a man divorcing his wife.
So of course in a heterosexual marriage God has made the man and wife to be joined together.

Just as in a homosexual marriage God has made both men or both women to be together."

God is evil.
To follow the philosophy and rules of an evil individual is to be, yourself, evil.

It is on that basis that I reject Christianity and Christians, on the basis of following an evil diety who has done evil acts and commands his followers to do evil.

A Christian that doesn't believe in the Christian god,isn't really a Christian.
If someone chooses to identify with a label, we can assume they meet, or believe they meet, the requirements of that label.
Surely the minimum possible requirement to be a Christian is to believe in and worship the Christian god?"

Of course Christians font sacrifice their own children's as the Bible does not command them to.
Abraham was commanded to, and then prevented from following through. That implies god is against sacrificing children, as no one else was commanded to so so, and no one followed through and found favour with god"
