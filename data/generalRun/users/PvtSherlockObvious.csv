People like to talk about how the reason self-proclaimed ""conservative humor"" fails is because it's punching down, but I don't think that's it.  There are plenty of times where punching down can still be funny.  Tons of popular humor revolves around ""look at these morons""-type jokes.  Just look at almost any sitcom and see how many jokes involve one of the main characters doing/saying something utterly stupid.

Instead, the problem with ""conservative humor"" is the same as the problem with ""Christian rock"":  When you put the ideology and message as being more important than the medium, the medium is going to suffer.  Those attempts at making a ""conservative Daily Show"" a while back were doomed to failure from the very premise, because they'd decided that being sufficiently conservative was more important than being funny.  At worst it's hateful, but even at its best, it's just kind of lame and unfunny.

> I think the take-away here is though companies say they want open communication, they really don’t. You either like your job and the work and are happy with settling, or you quit 😞

Like I said, not every company is like this.  Your boss was more interested in maintaining their own little fiefdom and power structure than in actually benefiting the company.  Maybe that will come back to bite them, maybe it won't, but this kind of bad judgment will definitely limit their own growth potential."
NoStupidQuestions,fehnvqh,t1_fehmhiq,1579120345.0,"You didn't waste it, you gained knowledge, experience, and positioned yourself well to find work elsewhere.  As for just quitting, don't fall into that trap.  As it stands, your reason for leaving the last company was perfect:  You wanted to go where you felt you could do the most good for the company, and your boss fired you for it.  That reflects badly on them, not on you.

For now, apply for unemployment, definitely appeal if it gets denied (they often deny initial applications as a matter of course, then give appeals actual consideration), and start looking for a company that actually offers upward mobility.  Don't let this make you gun-shy, either, not every company/boss pulls shit like this, and you don't want to work for the ones that do."
NoStupidQuestions,fehmz7c,t3_ep7mfb,1579119824.0,"Yes.  Simply put, your boss was an idiot.

The potential to move up the ranks is a huge incentive to work for one specific company over another, as well as incentive to work harder in hopes of getting the promotion they're after.  Make no mistake, people *will* work jobs that pay a little less or require longer hours if that job also offers the potential for advancement.  Behavior like this means that you only have employees who can't get jobs elsewhere, they'll jump ship if they get a better offer since there's no potential for improvement, and if you somehow still wind up with a good employee who's willing to work for you anyway, you're wasting the optimal use of that potential.

A good management team knows what their people are good at and will push them to excel, because it benefits them too.  I got my current job partly because my boss at the time thought I had potential and pushed me for it when an opening came up, and both of my current bosses regularly send me emails about jobs within the company they think I'd be interested in and encouraging me to apply.  I know it sucks to lose your job like this, but at least now you can find someplace that actually fosters potential and initiative."

If you have the funds, though, I highly recommend investing in a meat thermometer.  Different types of meat are ""done"" at different interior temperatures.  You can always research the desired internal temps for a given ""doneness,"" and experiment to see how you prefer it.

In general, though, cooking meat isn't *that* different from cooking vegetables.
