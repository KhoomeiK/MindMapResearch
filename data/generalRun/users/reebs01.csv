TrueCrimePodcasts,ffqxsov,t3_eums0j,1580146053.0,"I'm listening to The Officer's Wife, which is about a young couple with two children who decided on divorce.  The husband was a cop and one night he claims that his wife shot herself in the head in their closet.  Lots of interviews with family and friends look into the validity of the husband's claims.  Quite good!"

AnimalsBeingMoms,ffd847r,t1_ffckdej,1579815266.0,"Definitely!  These pups are learning when to back off their mom, but also any dog who might growl or bark at them.  It will keep them safe in the future and is key to learning how to operate with dogs (or cats or...) that aren't their mom or siblings.  This doggie is a great mom!"

I'm on the front end, so I specifically looked for sweeping workouts, but [this one I found](https://empoweredperformance.ca/curling-fitness-tip-my-4-favourite-exercises-for-powerful-sweeping/) would likely work well for any position."

AskOldPeople,fer80wl,t3_eqcb4d,1579350957.0,Yes but I’m in my early 40s. My younger brother died several years ago from a pulmonary embolism.

AppleWatch,feluoo6,t1_felnyx2,1579231383.0,"Me too! When I got my first watch as a kid I had broken my left arm so put it on my right.  I can’t put on a watch with my right hand at all, 30 years later."
HumansBeingBros,fekdbsy,t3_epfjdd,1579197662.0,"I just wanted to reach out and let you know that I'm thinking of you.  My dad died in a plane crash when he was 56 and, although that was about 15 years ago, I still remember how I felt the days and weeks after it happened.

He was cremated and his oldest friend, who is a woodworker, made the box for his ashes.  It was very meaningful for our family and I know his friend was thankful of the opportunity to do it.

Hang in there."

goldenretrievers,fdreta0,t3_emrujn,1578683580.0,"My family had a golden named Beau when I was in high school and university - he was the best!  He ended up with a tumor under a front leg at about nine years old.  We lived in a city that had the province's veterinary college and so had amazing experts, and he had the leg amputated and lived quite a while longer.  The surgeon told us that cats and dogs are three-legged animals that just come with a spare. :)

Anyway, I hope your Beau has a long, healthy, happy life.  He looks so soft - I just want to give him a hug!"
goldenretrievers,fdre9pm,t1_fdrd7sd,1578683263.0,"We started walking with our pup when we got her at about nine/ten weeks old.  I think the guidance about being fully vaccinated applies to interactions with other dogs who could pass something on, and playing in standing water like puddles at dog parks, where viruses and bacteria from other dogs could be lurking.

It was important to us that she start to understand leash walking fairly soon after we got her, but we started in our backyard and did very short stints at first.  And man, when we hit the fully vaccinated point, it was amazing - she was so ready to play with other dogs and it was a great way for her to run off some of the puppy energy.

But, as with everything, see what your vet says."
