Also this is stupid:
>My husband and I are good parents, have a stable income, and live in a big house in a nice neighbourhood.

None of that makes you a good parent, sorry."
AmItheAsshole,febu5qn,t1_fe8niix,1578962692.0,"NAH. I have also worked in retail for years. Once the transaction is completed there's nothing that can be done. If an item is marked at the wrong price and it's the stores fault then it's the stores fault and if they care about their customers then they should honour that price.
If before the transaction had taken place the employee was like ""apologies it's been mislabeled it's actually $300"" then that's totally fine, but not once the money has changed hands and the customer has left the store."

AmItheAsshole,fdppktl,t3_emfzof,1578635734.0,"NTA and I'm sadly surprised by the number of ""YTA's"" here. You are under no obligation to have any relationship with any person for any reason. I don't think it's fair for anyone to want you to just flip how you feel about someone. Also the ""but he's genuinely sorry"" argument is bullshit. He was also genuinely an asshole.

OP I feel and understand you on many levels, but know this - people do change. Not often enough, but they can. Sometimes it's worth indulging that, just a little bit."

Who gives a shit if someone's 10-20 minutes late.
She should have messaged you saying she was late, it was poor that she only told you once you had messaged her. 

Idk, seems like a waste to throw away everything cos someone was 10-20 mins late.

Like what if she was late cos she was spending extra time to look ""good"" for you? ? Or if there was an accident on the way etc etc? (Yes I still understand and agree that she should've told you she was running late the first chance she got).

No-one's perfect, being late to one thing is a small thing to throw away a potential relationship (especially if you liked her).

Edit: Changed YTA to ESH."

Maybe their enjoyment for the board games isn't as high as yours. When I get blasted, the last thing I want to do is play a board game, especially an ""adult"" one (like Settlers of Catan etc), as it requires a lot of thought processes whereas sitting and watching a movie doesn't, and that's part of why I do it."
