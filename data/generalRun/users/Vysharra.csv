A word of warning: watch your ingredients. My foundation is oil based (I have dry skin and dryness actually causes most of my breakouts but I still balked at the beginning because until recently oil = bad) and that needs consideration. My foundation *must* be set with a powder or I look both greasy and it will melt. I put it tons everywhere (shake some powder onto the back of my hand, fold poof over index finger and pat into powder then apply with pressure until you’re just covered in it) after I’m happy with my foundation and concealer (I actually stopped using concealer and just spot on full coverage with a small foundation brush under a sponged-on medium coverage), heaviest where I sweaty/get oily like my hairline or around my nose, and then kabuki off the excess. Ben Nye is the holy grail of setting powders, whatever foundation you choose *do* get some Ben Nye setting powder. Translucent works for everyone other than very dark skin, but there are browns/bronzes/yellows/pinks to help match your skin the best.

I also had to stop using most water-based products that interacted with my foundation. My water-based moisturizer/sunscreen has to dry *completely* before I apply. My primer is water *and* oil based so it has an emulsifier ingredient that helps but if I apply too much, my makeup just won’t take. And I do use a water-based ‘setting spray’ but it’s to moisturize all the layers of powder when I wear lots of countour/blushes/highlights on a fancy face. And more than one spritz makes me look greasy.

Also, tools. I prefer a beauty blender (squeezed out super super good) because it allows me to build up my coverage but it takes a lot of time. A stipple brush works best if you’re going right to full coverage, but a flat foundation brush will give you what I call ‘Barbie skin’ because you are so covered you’re flat and plastic looking. If you’re good with building shape back up with light countouring and blush before going into the more intense, obvious colors, then it can look really amazing (cosplayers use this type of make up for this exact reason)."

I went pro. I have the *perfect* color right out of the tin, it stays all day without falling or causing flakes and the setting powder is perfect at its job without being oily or causing flashback. I can get an entire years’ worth of foundation, a small setting powder (it actually takes several years to use one up), some poofs for the powder and a name brand beauty bender for the same price as **one bottle** of KVD foundation. Not everyone likes full coverage (though it can do medium with the right tool), the fact you might have to change primers, or having to order samples until you find your match, but it has been SO worth it to me.

As for the latter, I have adhd-levels of aversion to criticism and fear of failure. I solved it by doing three things: finding some of the best fic in my fandom and going “this, this is the da Vinci of my otp and no matter how bad mine is, it doesn’t matter because it’s never going to be *this* good and yet will still be a million times better than the unwritten stuff”, setting comments to ‘only with an account/must be approved’ on ao3, and posting only once I’m in that sweet spot of idgaf after a few drinks and sending a link to a friend I know who would leave me nice feedback.

Will you have medical power of attorney to deal with the chance of his mental faculties failing from the disease or the pain meds? What about full power of attorney to use his assets for hospice or other medical expenses like a private room?) is really fucking hard. Say nothing of what happens when they’re actually gone.

He needs a living will (what will happen to his assets as he is dying), a real will (what will become of his assets after his death, be sure to acknowledge his family by leaving them $1 each so they can’t contest and tie it up in court), and an end-of-life Plan with whatever legal documents and medical timeline the doctor can give you (does he want a DNR? Does he want a limit on how long he can be intubated if not? Does he want minimal pain relief or maximum? Whom does he want to make decisions once he’s no longer able? Does he want to die at home or in a hospice? Will you have help at any point? Will you be legally allowed to visit him if he’s in the ICU and does he want you to ban his family? Planning a death, even before the burial, is like a birth and wedding rolled in one without the built-in legal protections given to spouses/next of kin, plus he needs to start choosing his ‘path’ now, while he has as much energy and mental health as possible.)

If he’s staying with you until the end (or nearly so if he opts for hospice), then you need to read read read about being a caregiver for the dying in these circumstances.

They do abortions all the time (calling them ‘reductions’). They destroy more embryos each year than the number ‘lost’ in elective abortions.

You’re inconsistent. You’re already beginning the next step to take away more abilities for women to control their own bodies. First elective abortions. Next Plan B. What will come after that? No IUDs since women still ovulate and can’t support a zygote if it forms? Or maybe only with her husband’s permission after they’ve had a few kids?

Your morality is manufactured to sway votes and you don’t even know it (unless you’re staunchly Evangelical, then I apologize for assuming). You are outraged over clumps of cells but allow real, living, breathing children to starve or languish in an underfunded, over-burdened foster system. You don’t care about the ravages of birth that come with ‘adoption is always an option’, nor the affects on their career or families caused by the realities of pregnancy.

Your stance isn’t the only one, even within the prolife community. Your morals are not everyone’s morals. And abortions will *always* happen if you pay attention to history/other cultures. You want babies, you want *life*? Then you want comprehensive sex education and easy access to family planning tools. Otherwise you’ll have daughters/sisters/mothers dying from sepsis in bloody motel rooms after being butchered in desperation and too many lives interrupted (and possibly never continued) by unplanned, unwanted pregnancies.

Second: ‘my right to choose’ means that *all* the resources of family planning was accessible to her. Not her husband or the government, just her. She could have been talking about birth control (which was illegal to get without your husband’s permission in recent history).

It’s the ‘prolife’ crowd that insists that ‘the right to choose’ only means abortion when it encompasses the entire range of family planning options (including safe sex education and easy access to birth control, which reduces the instances of abortion... weird how those things have been attacked by the same crowd who supposedly want nothing but to ‘save babies’)."

It must be *dead* to be removed from a woman’s uterus regardless of circumstance. 

Do we euthanize gunshot victims who are bleeding out? Do we actively end the lives of terminal patients? Do we smother the brain dead in their hospital beds?

No. We wait for them to die because otherwise it is defined as murder.

As for the extremists on the pro-choice side: they are educated. Late term abortions are exceedingly rare because so few doctors are qualified to perform them (thanks in part to the series of violent murders and bombings perpetrated by ‘prolife’ individuals). It is extremely expensive, as well as time intensive (a multi-day procedure since it is, in effect, induced preterm labor) and reserved for those in the most dire circumstances.

Physical and genetic anomalies which will cause extreme suffering and eventual death for a child (sometimes days, sometime years) as well as the suffering the family will go through as a result can sometimes only be found as the fetus grows to certain stages. These are *wanted* children who become a terrible tragedy and the parents sacrifice a great deal to decide to spare a life that would know only pain. Your jab at ‘infantcide’ is related to this situation as well. There were a handful of instances where parents in similar situations who didn’t, or couldn’t, seek out a late term abortion were ending the child’s suffering a few minutes or hours earlier. Just as these ‘moderates’ you describe should support, like before Roe v Wade, mental health was considered grounds for an abortion if it was extreme enough, a dying child was relieved of their pain and then their parents could hold them without bringing more pain into their exceptionally short lives.

If you’re interested in learning more, please check out resources on The Southern Strategy. Politics regarding abortion was minor until the Evengelical vote became needed. Then it was twisted in a very specific way to hide rascism in plain sight in many more people (single issue voters are very valuable according to this strategy) because the majority of women seeking out abortions were poor (so non-whites primarily pre-Roe v Wade). The Rs have used reproductive rights as a whipping crop on these groups for so long, few remember the origin. It’s a fascinating journey to take. Ireland is an interesting look in recent history regarding *gains* in reproductive rights as opposed to the losses in the US (that Act you mentioned? Yeah, it was specifically passed to erode reproductive rights by granting personhood to fetuses as a stepping stone to overturn the rights granted in Roe v Wade. It was not somemystical artifact of a nation giving into their own deep concerns for getting justice for fetuses)."

One side wants everyone to decide for themselves how they will live their lives. The other wants to hurt and maim in the name of moral superiority. This discussion doesn’t exist because there is no middle ground. We settled with Roe v Wade. We allowed reproductive rights to be couched in the terms of a physician’s ethics and privacy with a patient. We even allowed ‘viability’ to be defined weeks earlier than any surviving birth, even decades later. But it’s not enough because Republicans need single issue voters.

It’s why Planned Parenthood provides education, STI screening, health exams and birth control (all for men and women) primarily. They’ll even confirm a pregnancy before giving you a list of OBs to go see for your prenatal stuff if you’re keeping it (as well as lists of resources if you’re low income).

People want to focus on abortion, but it’s only one small part of having the (amazing! crazy! wonderful!) control over your own fertility. Those who are fighting access to abortions are fighting this concept as a whole, not just this one thing.

To clarify, sex education and easy access to birth control reduces abortion rates. These resources have been attacked in concert with access to abortion. Ergo, reducing the need for safe abortions is not the goal.

Further supporting my claim, fertility clinics do ‘reductions’ as a very common procedure. When multiple embryos are implanted during IVF (to increase the likelihood of successfully creating a pregnancy, sometime ‘too many’ can stick. A selective abortion then takes place to reduce the number of developing embryos to the desired amount. No protests take place at fertility clinics that perform these procedures. No protests take place when frozen embryos are destroyed because of various reasons, which has been estimated to exceed all the embryos ‘lost’ in elective abortions each year.

‘Abortion’ is a rallying cry, but the intention is clear: this is about the ability to control fertility. They are just working backwards from the most galvanizing part. Plan B prevents abortions, but pharmacists refuse to hand it over on ‘moral’ grounds because opposing the ‘right to choose’ is about opposing the right to control your own body, not just abortion."

Diaphragms were illegal, if you even knew about them or where to get one. When they weren’t, they were very expensive and hard to find. The first clinics set up to provide them (rather than having a connection through the right doctor) happened less than a hundred years ago.

Hormonal birth control was created less than seventy years ago. It was illegal to provide it to anyone but a married woman who had her husband’s express permission (he had to be there) and considered amoral if they didn’t have children together yet. Then it was just married women. Then it was very slowly given to single women by progressive doctors under the guise of treating other health conditions. Then Planned Parenthood happened and a single girl/woman could get sex education and a range of birth control options without the pretense.

And whoa, we even have Plan B over the counter now. How amazing is that?!

But look back: We’ve had the right to prevent pregnancy for less time than we’ve had the vote. We’re *literally* back to keeping girls (and boys) in the dark about their own bodies and the mechanics of conception. There are places where geography and economics and delay tactics created by vile legislation has made safe, sterile abortions de facto *impossible*.

‘Back alley’ abortion’s were going on all this time. There were groups of women, normal women with brave and kind hearts, who risked arrest and jail sentences to give (relatively) safe abortions and bring birth control into states that didn’t allow it in the 60s.

Suicide is, inherently, a selfish act (of desperation, of pain relief, of escape, etc) and leaving some emotionally wrought manifesto about her mental state to explain it to you was never a consideration.

Someone who never talks about themselves? They don’t have anything positive to say. Never allowing herself to feel sad (everyone should have sad days if they’re expressing themselves honestly)? She’s overwhelmed by the emotion, perhaps by the intensity, perhaps by a lack of healthy emotional development.

If you take anything away from this, I hope it is two things: 1) suicides happen in clusters, yes even in innocent little school children who you believe don’t understand death in the age of information and 2) that perhaps with some guidance, this girl might have been able to express her suffering (impulsive? Where did she learn how to kill herself? Her perfectly nice family watching graphic horror shows?)

Their arms were routinely halfway down their thighs (which isn’t inherently wrong) but then their lower legs would be nearly half their height. They weren’t quite as spindly as the manga, but the anime did retain some of the OG ‘flavor’ of overly long and thin limbs.

The anime also showed a distinct school of thought for fabric. Minimal fold lines and shading, static form unless it was a action scene, with a lot of selective anti-gravity in places (skirts proofing like they had petticoats on even as students). 

The same goes for the hair. I like that part of the above image but in the 8 OG anime posters I’m looking at right now, not one has the hair compressed, even when one of the scouts is leaning back. Usagi’s hair is pretty much like Mickey’s ears.

No one in history was like a Rohhirm, but if you take the cues from horse craziness from the Mongols and the weaponry/tack from European militaries, you were basically listening to General Patton give a rousing speech to ten thousand angry Sherman tanks hopped up on NoS.

Chargers, one of the kinds of horses that would be ridden into battle, were often deadlier than their riders. The had to have both the strength to handle an armored rider as well as the stamina not to collapse over hours of battle. They also had to have the temperament to be trained. That was just breeding. Then they had to undergo *years* of having their natural instincts overridden (they’re prey animals that can’t see shit right in front of them but almost everything else around them so they have to both ignore their surroundings *and* memorize them so they can bite and trample the shit out of the foot soldiers trying to hack his face off) to stomp, kick, and bite all while taking direction from their rider. Oh, and not running off the first time something screams, hurts them, or gets under their feet.

We only have the Lipizzaners left to give us clues since battle horses (and their trainers) have died out. They’re glorified pets these days, but all that jumping and feats of athleticism and control hark back to days of what a *real* Mounted Warrior/Rohhirm would have been able to do on his horse. Rohhirm were described as living closer to them, like the Mongols, incorporating both the warrior culture and connection to your horses (you would have had several, one to get you to the battle quickly, one to carry your supplies/armor, and your battle horse who could have done both but would have been exhausted if he had), but considering his background in warfare (where horses were still hugely important but waning) and how valuable they were at the time, I don’t think Tolkien would have needed to know to much about the Steppe horse cultures to imagine mounted cavalry who were downright religious about their bloodthirsty warrior horses."
