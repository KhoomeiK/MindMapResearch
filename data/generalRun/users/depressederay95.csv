depression,fdpcfy9,t1_fdpby19,1578625135.0,why be scared? accepting the way everything is will give you peace and you don't even care about death. what is even death? nothing to be anxious about
depression,fdpa2ly,t3_emc07f,1578623521.0,"I take psychedelics and not even they are helping. Just temporary. Like any other drug.

Like any other activity you do. There is nothing you can really do against it

Depression kills you slowly and if you have accepted that you don't even care anymore. 

It's normal for me to feel this way, my whole life long. We all severely clinical depressed know that our own death will happen by killing ourselves, for ~80% I guess

Just accept that and slowly rot away. Running away will not fix you, NOTHING will"

DPH,fcw69c6,t3_eiw5ja,1578018113.0,"DPH is the worst drug you can do to yourself. If you love yourself just a tiny bit or if you don't even do that then think about your relationships which can be ruined quickly because you become dumb, foggy and lazy. Plus it's the stupidest, most horrible ""high"" you can have. DPH sucks ass.

Just take some Acid...."
Drugs,fcv54ph,t1_fcuy2yi,1577994846.0,"I've been diagnosed with ADD and was prescribed various stimulants including Vyvanse, Dexedrine, Desoxyn and Ritalin which was the worst one for me personally, I don't know why but I am not the kind of type who likes amphetamines because they induce anxiety and ""frozen mood"", hard to describe. Everyone is different though. When it works for you, why not take it? Since Methylphenidate is pure pharma quality you don't even need to worry about impurities like speed from the street."
Drugs,fcue00a,t3_eiwxds,1577978726.0,"Ritalin sucks ass. The euphoria/motivation lasts for 1h max and then it turns into the complete opposite. Depressed anxious angry mood, physical unpleasant side effects. It sucks. Stimulants suck ass."
Drugs,fcs2b2a,t3_eilz8j,1577910381.0,sounds like mental addiction because you are still romanticizing drugs though they caused derealization in you (frequent drug abuse CAN do this!). you can still be quite comfortable and satisfied in life when you do therapy. good luck
