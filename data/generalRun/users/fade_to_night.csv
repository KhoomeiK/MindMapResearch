Hair,fddglne,t1_fdbqvht,1578311378.0,"just know ofc that without bleaching it doesn't last long but it still can work out and be pretty enough :3   
i didn't notice any much damage from La rich actually, but i'm sure it does something :D but don't see anything much and i'm using them for 6 years already :)"
GirlGamers,fd8h4dr,t1_fd81re0,1578218324.0,:3 really nice to touch it lol
Hair,fd8gyog,t1_fd6r5uj,1578218262.0,"my natural color is [medium brown](https://prnt.sc/qjk9kf). I used to not bleach my hair before coloring my hair few years ago, but like you said it doesn't look the best or last for too long: [here an example for blue color without bleaching](https://prnt.sc/qjkbby). so nowadays every 6-8 months  i am bleaching a bit (9% for 40 min) but never the roots."
Hair,fd54c0u,t1_fd3p9yn,1578174097.0,"yes i'm using many of their colors! it's really the color that last the best on my hair :)   
can see on my Instagram some other colors of la rich, like that: [Pink](https://www.instagram.com/p/B11S3-AJL1Z/)"
Hair,fd3ocki,t1_fd3mny4,1578160245.0,I tried arctic fox few times and they were fine just didn't last for long on my hair. atm i'm mostly using la rich and it's really the best i found for my hair

Sure! That pin is simply from ebay :3"
Hair,fcyqhxt,t1_fcynfod,1578085003.0,Hmm i never bleach my roots but i do dye them with the same color i choose to dye my hair so it makes everything blend kinda nice. Have you tried to dye the roots aswell with the color?
Hair,fcyj39q,t1_fcyht4f,1578080912.0,it's just ebay :> really cheap and there are few different kinds
Hair,fcyb4i0,t1_fcy4vqe,1578077489.0,:> Thanks you!
Hair,fcyb2xh,t1_fcy3npw,1578077464.0,"hmm I think it depends on what type of hair you have. I tried many companies and i found that la rich is really staying for long on my hair. Ofc there are colors that are harder to maintain like blue. On the first 3 showers you see blue everywhere.  
i'm coloring my hair every 4-6 weeks.   


tip: when you dye your hair with blue color (which imo the hardest color to maintain)- try to mix a bit of the dye with the conditioner (or shampoo whatever u use) and apply on your hair for 5 min before you wash it. it makes  the color staying for longer :)"
