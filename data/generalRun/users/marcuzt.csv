But then again, no one has gotten rich (really rich) by working hard and saving money. Usually you need to add opportunity, exploation of labour/resources, and some priviliges to that list of prerequisites to become rich."
Treknobabble,ffeinwt,t3_et4h6j,1579849568.0,"What I really like is how they seem to manage, in the same way as old Trek, to create a critic of society today without it being to much in your face.

DaystromInstitute,ffegh32,t1_ffe3vhq,1579847070.0,"They are based on the Roman empire, so we can assume then that they follow a similar pattern. Which means that Romulans probably stayed on or close to Romulus, meanwhile they ruled a large area of space where we know they used other races for slave labour and so on to make sure Romulus stayed rich and in control.

What would happen if Carthago managed to easily burn down Rome? The empire would very quickly fall apart would be my guess."

DaystromInstitute,ffcxh9v,t1_ffcwh9b,1579809308.0,"Well, now we need a discussion about genes vs culture. I think Star Trek people are just like us genetically (but perhaps a bit stronger/smarter thanks to Genetics War and WW3 breeding). The difference lies in having less worries and less stress. It is easy to be happy if you have food on the table without needing to work 10 h a day minimum wage for it. But when Federation citizens gets pushed they are not so nice anymore, example being Equinox and similar from all the series.

What we know is that earths neighbour got burned to the ground and the longest enemy of the Federation is pissed, and to top it off the Borg is still around. Dominion war is probably also a fresh memory. I am not surprised people might be on the edge a bit."
DaystromInstitute,ffcst7v,t1_ffcnyti,1579806537.0,"> A civilian news reporter essentially saying a Romulan life in the face of a crisis is lesser than that of a Federation citizen is pretty abhorrent, even by postwar tension standards.

Are you sure about that? Read any news regarding alt-right and muslims for the past 5 years or so? I think it is very clear that it is easy to see ""Others"" (in this case Romulans) as less worthy.. We have seen it again and again in human history."

DaystromInstitute,feyqsug,t3_eqxsz7,1579449373.0,"My current headcanon is that what we saw as future timecops are really S31 with timetravel tech. So they already experimented with tech in DISCO, which gives them (if their timeline mentioned in VOY and ENT) a lot of years to develop it. It was also mentioned dueing ENT about several factions doing it and making peace.

I think it is S31 making sure the tech they need gets back to AQ in the time they need it. So they knew a timeline getting Admiral Janeway home late was needed to correct the ”current timeline” of them getting home with Borg tech."

Grupperna behöver olika saker och att säga att alla som tar sig till Sverige måste bli svenskar och bo här resten av livet är ju inte hållbart. Varför kan vi inte ställa krav på de som vill stanna och ge vård/hjälp till de aom vill lämna och låta dessa lämna?"
