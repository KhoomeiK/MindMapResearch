OverwatchUniversity,ff71va1,t1_ff6700a,1579639461.0,Sounds easy but I've played with rein/zaryas that didn't know how to play off each other ( zaryas rarely bubbled me / reigns didn't drop shield to attack when I bubbled them).
OverwatchUniversity,ff71j24,t3_errepi,1579639274.0,"Practice when to bubble you and a mate. Using it for no reason can cost you the game a few seconds later.   Sigma ult got you and the team? Bubble yourself and the most important teammate before you hit the ground. That's easy charge and u potentially saved a life. Also don't just barge in when you have full charge and leave your rein behind. He's there for a reason and I couldn't break this habit for a while.  Also this isn't that really important but say a junkrat is spamming bombs down a certain path ,use your charge and eat them up.  Again don't forget you have the ability to bubble others. I've played with bad zaryas that rarely did that"

buildapc,ff6iz9n,t1_ff62qxm,1579628215.0,I sell on eBay and ONLY sell to buyer's with good ratings/history.   Buyers with zero feedback (new account) get ignored. Also I've built a good reputation with PayPal ( when you sell a lot you get the option to recieve money instantly instead of waiting for your sold item to be delivered) so I've had 2 instances of being refunded my money when a buyer was obviously trying to scam me (claimed the item was broken or claimed they didn't authorize a purchase).  This is just my experience but I suggest taking pictures of your items with tagged dates before selling. It really helps when a PayPal case is opened.

We won't forget this. You've set a new tone for the kind of interaction we'll be having with you. It's a cold one. One where there aren't any illusions about the reality of the situation. Previous notions of ""family"" are dead. We are mere consumers to you, and that is obvious.

NoStupidQuestions,fespm9k,t1_fes9w1z,1579367685.0,Well of course.  It's either Graduate school with the best grades to become successful/salaryman or you become nothing over there.
