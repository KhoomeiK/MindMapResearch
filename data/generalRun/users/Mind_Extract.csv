ploompax,fff32a2,t1_ffey93c,1579874370.0,"Been cleaning almost daily with ISO, so long as you blow on the swabbed surface for 2 seconds there should be no alcohol residue left at all."
BeAmazed,ffdkxl8,t1_ffdkcwt,1579823066.0,"Best show ever, what's the relevance?"
WatchPeopleDieInside,ffdkszo,t1_ffclybw,1579822987.0,And the outerbag? *That's* applicable to the internet??

todayilearned,ffd3bl6,t1_ffcr9im,1579812595.0,"You know, this is actually disappointing. I honestly expected better from you. No clue why."
MadeMeSmile,ffd34ai,t1_fdw8aw9,1579812479.0,"...why? Sounds like you're assuming everyone is equally nihilistic.

Look...just tell me if I need to start buying canned goods and water by the pallet."
todayilearned,ffcqone,t1_ffbz5za,1579805240.0,"Oh Jesus, you're doubling down?!

So, what, they disagreed with you? Or is a downvote enough for you to make a personal assumption and attack?

No matter how you want to spin it, your shitty attitude is all I smell here."

startrek,ffbww09,t1_ffbbetw,1579785416.0,"He's joking about the submitted video. Everyone keeps using essentially the exact same soundbyte about how they've tailored the show to PERFECTLY appeal to both new fans, new fans, new fans, and old fans."
ProRevenge,ffbwb7a,t1_ff7xmk9,1579784901.0,Thank you!
spaceporn,ffb34x6,t1_ffarg85,1579750585.0,"How did this even happen? Did you snoop into OPs profile just in case you could be shitty about your favorite shit, or do you have a pathological hatred of OP and follow them around? Either way, *solid* existence."
