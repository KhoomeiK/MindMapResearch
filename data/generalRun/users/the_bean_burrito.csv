bourbon,fdm5jrh,t1_fdm56ym,1578540319.0,"It could have, it also could have been clear originally.  It just depends on what it is, how heavy it is, and how dissolvable it is.  I mean it could have taken years to fall out of suspension.  If you shake it up enough it would probably re-dissolve and turn clear.
