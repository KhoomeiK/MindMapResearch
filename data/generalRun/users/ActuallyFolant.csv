As in Rampage games.

Like, Genesis developers have....etc...

I'm glad it's not."

Bullshit is bullshit and taking advantage of the system is the worst kind of bullshit and is the reason the system has the reputation it does.

You'll forgive me if I don't jump to the guys defence in his ire for the DWP.

Gallows humour my arse because there are people just straight willing to do that just for handouts."

That's exactly what he said."
unitedkingdom,ff6t7uy,t1_ff61url,1579634392.0,Using it as a tactic like suggested is vile behaviour and is insulting people who are genuinely at that stage in their illness.

unitedkingdom,fem56zw,t1_felv7d1,1579240157.0,"Assuming you signed a contract with this agency, check it.

You can claim it was terminated due to your illness, they can just turn around and say your assignment ended and that'll be the ended of it as far as they are concerned.

Correct me if I'm wrong, but most agencies can terminate without notice even after 12 weeks, right?"

I guess that's true for this guy."

gaming,fcyakjo,t3_ejjm63,1578077185.0,"Card connecting right into the controller, huh?

That would mean there is online payment. Similar, if not exactly the same as what exists already with online services such as PSN, Xbox Live and Steam.

This means that card details are entered through this service, with the option to not save and to input the details with every purchase.

That'd make the extra hardware required for something like this wasteful cost. (Chip and pin, since you are inserting the card)

It would mean EA actually lose money with something like this, going completely against what you think this meme is funny for.

Not very well thought out is it?"
