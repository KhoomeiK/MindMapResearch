Pawing at the mouth can sometimes be a sign of nausea, and vomiting is not a good sign with ferrets, so if he's on the verge of vomiting, it could be trouble. It does sound pretty likely that it could be a hairball though."
ferrets,ffkgy2r,t3_eu0m5a,1580022584.0,I second the suggestions for a Ferret Nation! They are great cages overall and the vertical bars will help with the climbing.
ferrets,ffkgium,t3_eu0nj8,1580022389.0,"So sorry your little guy is ill. If he's dropping weight and/or not eating much, you could ask around at different vet offices (if your vet doesn't have any) for Carnivore Care. It's a nutritional supplement to help sickly/recovering fuzzies gain strength. It's a powder you mix with water. One of mine was very ill recently (stayed two nights at the emergency vet, needed IV fluids, etc) and he drank the Carnivore Care willingly even when very weak."

ferrets,ffhp04c,t3_etntws,1579946211.0,I don't have any insight into what's going on with her unfortunately but just wanted to send some well wishes. I hope she is able to be easily treated and makes a fast recovery. I was just at the emergency vet with one of mine earlier this week and I know how nerve-wracking it can be. Best wishes for you both.

ferrets,ffeujvb,t3_et9amj,1579866163.0,"Koda is finally home after three nights with the vets (two at the hospital and one at his primary care). I took him to the emergency vet due to weight loss, lethargy, diarrhea, and minor coordination issues. He was severely dehydrated and they put him on IV fluids. They initially thought he might have a blockage or an abdominal tumor but those were eventually ruled out. They diagnosed him with helicobactor (GI disorder) as well as coccidia (intestinal parasites). He is being treated with several medications as well as Carnivore Care. He's not out of the woods yet, but they're hoping he can maintain at-home care and continue making progress with recovery. In addition to his GI issues, they are very concerned about his kidney function. We will retest kidney function in a month. Relieved to say he has been eating and drinking on his own, and even stashed a couple of his toys."
ferrets,ffbvvgg,t3_esskdy,1579784498.0, Coughing up blood is not a good sign.  He definitely needs to be seen by a vet asap.

ferrets,ff6u5au,t3_erug15,1579634937.0,The blep from the one in the back makes it look like he's crushing her lol
ferrets,ff5bf20,t3_erqcwb,1579586139.0,Abdominal X-rays came back abnormal. They suspect either a blockage or a tumor. Waiting to hear back on the radiologist's report but the vet says surgery is likely the next step. Trying to manage my anxiety in the waiting room... positive vibes appreciated.
ferrets,ff51j4b,t3_erigqd,1579577716.0,I would suggest calling your vet and seeing what advice they can give you over the phone. They may be able to give you some info for free without having to take him in again.
creepyPMs,fembx91,t3_epn4vg,1579247804.0,I love your response lol
