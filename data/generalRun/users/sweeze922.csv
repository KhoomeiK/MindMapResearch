selfimprovement,ffh7iz6,t3_etknxm,1579925316.0,You aren’t stupid. You aren’t ugly. You deserve love as much as anyone else does. Take care of yourself. Love yourself. You are worth it.
secretsanta,ffh77rr,t3_etem3q,1579925053.0,What a fun present! So happy for you! It’s perfect!

BendyAndTheInkMachine,ffao80a,t3_esgbfe,1579740585.0,It’s coming out in April? I hadn’t heard there was a date.
Wellthatsucks,ff97gt6,t3_es9jot,1579706623.0,"Bath with lots of baking soda in it. Hurts the second you get in, but the baking soda gets rid of the pain of some of the pain of the burn."
Waiters,ff93p7i,t1_ff92dp8,1579704085.0,"I see comments like this frequently about it being hard to get a serving job. This must vary highly by area, because it is super easy to get serving jobs where I live (not like fine dining, but normal restaurants.)"
ThriftStoreHauls,ff6b374,t3_ert94m,1579623297.0,I love that. Does it have the tag with the brand?
Waiters,ff4uskl,t3_erlhyw,1579572947.0,Eleven years. I kept saying seven years for a while when customers asked how long I’d been there. Realized I never accurately updated the number.
aldi,ff29mbx,t3_er7jbv,1579497896.0,I’m eating the salt and pepper ones right now.
DecidingToBeBetter,feuz94x,t3_eqewqh,1579391438.0,"Do it! I haven’t done quite an extensive list, but I’ve started paying more attention to my appearance and self care time as a mom of two and I’m loving it. Working on a good skin care routine, painting my nails frequently and getting new makeup products. A lot of it doesn’t take much time or money, but I like that I’m taking care of myself and feeling pretty for the first time in a while. (I always wore makeup and was reasonably well groomed, but taking that little extra time and effort is so rewarding.)"

JUSTNOMIL,fep3zhn,t1_femmcab,1579311615.0,The smaller pieces of mine are literally drying in the sink right now because I took it apart and cleaned everything so I can pass it along to my best friend who is having a baby. If I had the money I’d gift that to everyone I knew who was having a baby and using/supplementing powder formula.
bartenders,fecc31p,t3_eo9e3k,1578970480.0,"The bar I work at has a very cheap martini special on Friday’s so all afternoon it’s rimming martini glasses and making lemon drops for awful tippers who complain incessantly. 
I do batch them out. But I don’t have enough martini glasses for that order. Some of y’all are getting rocks glasses."
AmItheAsshole,fec9cyz,t3_eo86ne,1578968969.0,"NTA. She wanted to watch your kid. And wanted to keep her late in the day y’all didn’t have plans. It’s be different if you would have begged her to babysit. You told her you were going to a concert, which you went to and then she wanted to keep her later the next day. She shouldn’t care what you did with that time."
JUSTNOMIL,fec5azn,t3_eo899u,1578966869.0,The bottle maker is the BOMB! Thought it was too expensive with my first kid and was lucky enough to get it gifted for the second. Totally a game changer.
selfimprovement,fe6415k,t1_fe3q6r5,1578881295.0,You convinced me. Looked it up on Amazon and it turns out I had a free Audible book so it’s downloading now. Excited to check it out.
frozendinners,fe3h5jk,t3_enj20q,1578849218.0,I love those. Because I’m unhealthy I cover the top with sour cream. And mild Taco Bell packets.

CozyPlaces,fdcxdxp,t1_fdcvptq,1578287117.0,"I’m super sad all my decorations are down. You’ve still got it going on and presents to do. I’m jealous.  (But thanks so much for being a good military spouse, has to be so hard, but looks like you are killing it. Hope it’s a perfect late Christmas.)"
CozyPlaces,fdcuc6g,t3_ekkffw,1578284544.0,So gorgeous!!! It will be an amazing Christmas. I always love late celebrations because hen you just get more of the holiday.

The amount in this seems pretty excessive."
Minecraft,fccgfaa,t1_fccg23i,1577598101.0,Totally not karma whoring! You clearly worked your ass off. Just enjoy the extra cake day up votes. You would have gotten a ton regardless.

EatCheapAndHealthy,fcawxqj,t3_egs9sl,1577578239.0,"So hard. I admit if we are having people over, I stick to a handful of the same things. Lasagna, taco bar , hot dogs and beer bath brats with lots of toppings."
NoStupidQuestions,fc1k4tz,t1_fc0sgo7,1577321163.0,"I know people who don’t do Santa because of that betrayed feeling, but my husband and my personal experience is more like yours.
