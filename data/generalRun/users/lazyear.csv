financialindependence,ffh4xhf,t3_etgc2q,1579923221.0,"What kind of scientist were you and how did you get an ""in"" into the data science field?

I'm hoping to finish up my PhD in chemical biology in about a year, and I'd like to find the best way to transition into a data scientist role. I have a very strong background in programming (10+ years of experience in C, python, etc. Had job interviews offered based on my github) and have developed some interactive data visualization web applications to aid in my own thesis work. Do you have any advice?

Fun note, I also got into bitcoin, but about 10 years ago. Bought a bunch at $5 and sold what I had when it hit an all time high of $30, then forgot about it while I was in college. Wrote and ran an automated trading bot 2 years ago that turned a nice profit"

I already experienced the low level grind for gold back when I was kid. Why would I spend 100s of hours fishing lobsters/whatever the meta is today when I could just buy a bond with money and play the game how I want to. 

Obviously there's a fine line here, but I wanted to get my account back quickly to where I used to be, and so that I could experience some of the higher level content I could never do as a kid. But spending $20 to get a 15M bank early on can help you get to stuff like Zulrah faster."

I don't think you've put much thought into what an armed rebellion against government *means*. It means that you are willing to DIE to change conditions. You are saying that things are so bad that you will lay down your one and only life to help your fellow citizens.
