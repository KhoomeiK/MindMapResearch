I would love to see sources, especially on legal firearm owners committing less crime. 

People can be armed with shotguns and bolt or lever action rifles with current rules of mag capacity and storage intact. It's just the 'pistols are fun' crowd I'm at odds with. I get that they're fun. Lots of fun stuff in the world, but for some places it's best those things are prohibited for the best outcome of society. 
My wish is that our neighbours to the South adopt similar measures so that we both benefit from the reduction in weapons that were designed to proficiently and reliably kill humans in warfare. 

No disagreement with illegally obtained weapons, crime is a symptom of poverty, disparity, injustice, and desperation. Once these are addressed, it's a decent bet that illegal firearms will drop significantly. 

I'm not in dispute of the advantages of semi-auto. I'm merely saying it is unnecessary. Yes, follow-up shots are sometimes necessary. But are they not capable of being carried out with a bolt action? Legit question, haven't hunted big game in a long time.

I'm absolutely not in favour of getting all firearms away from all citizens. Just tweaking things so that we can all hunt, but have a difficult time committing offences with handguns and other unnecessary firearms for civilian use."
