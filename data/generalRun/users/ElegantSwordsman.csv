Now that most business is streaming, rather than help you find what you want, they want you to get lost in whatever catalogue they have, just so you stay subscribed. It’s like navigating a casino. You stay because you can’t get out."

bridge,fdssy01,t3_emyb0v,1578707535.0,"Learned from a friend in college. Literally only knew the rules, rubber scoring, and basic bid concepts like high card points. We played often and roped in new people just to play casually, like you’d play hearts or something. I did know it was a game that you could get sucked into... one of my neighbors used to play every day with their other neighbors. She said I was too young to learn, but she did teach me blackjack...

On my own I went through most of the online Learn to Play Bridge program. 

A decade later, joined a social group that met every couple of months. One person there said she was taking classes and invited us to the supervised play or duplicate. 

I went to the supervised play many months later when I had a day off... discovered my rudimentary online knowledge was better than theirs, and the next week I just showed up at the weekly duplicate game and asked if I could find a partner. 

We randomly (because it was definitely all luck) took second place. The partner seemed happy about that so we exchanged numbers and played a few more times (never as successful), and after that I started bringing my gf and we now play every week or two at the local bridge club in duplicate. 

We also play occasionally with friends for social meetups a few times a year, and we occasionally encourage those friends to come play duplicate/newplicate. We actually played a Swiss teams event with two guys from the bridge group. One did not have an ACBL number, the other crossed the 5 MP total after our middling performance (which isn’t too far behind my measly total). We may be bringing another friend to a newplicate game next week, so we’ll see if she catches the bug."

Jeopardy,fdms0zd,t3_em2twt,1578562918.0,"Anyone have the stats on first to ring in after audio/video clues? 

To me, it seems like James is winning the vast majority of these, and my hypothesis is that he has a faster reaction time to when the light flashes allowing the contestants to ring in. The other two can time the cadence equally well when it’s just Alex reading, but it’s a Little more random when it’s the end of a clip and they’re just waiting to be allowed to ring in. 

The reason I bring it up is because a normal jeopardy game tends to have maybe five A/V clues in a game? But it seems like there are even more scattered throughout the GOAT board. If my hypothesis is correct, more A/V clues favor James. Thus, the current GOAT clue format is favoring James."
