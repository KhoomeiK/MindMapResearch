stopdrinking,fgeamwm,t3_exyhfx,1580695196.0,Also a fan. Been using for quite a while now. I like that it's forgiving when I screw up.
bipolar,fgbu5ht,t1_fg813df,1580666101.0,"Yep. This is the truth, especially in health care, where you'd think some acceptance would be the norm. News flash: it's completely hostile to people who suffer from major mental illnesses."

BipolarReddit,fgbsls3,t3_exomvl,1580665708.0,"Nurse and BP1 here, working the night shift has consistently and thoroughly f'd up my life like you can't imagine. It's the express route to hell: mania or depression, suicidal ideation, delusions and hallucinations, getting arrested at work, you name it. Obviously ymmv but I can't advocate against it strongly enough if you have Bipolar Disorder in any of its manifestations."

cripplingalcoholism,fgbdnda,t1_fgb276i,1580661043.0,"The ECT absolutely fucking destroyed me for years -- wiped out nursing school, killed my balance and dexterity, made me forget the entirety of my second marraige (ok, that wasn't such a bad thing.) I only advise consent if it's a life and death situation. Which it was, sadly. And may be again soon. Those're the breaks I guess. And yeah, fuck that shrink accross the board... At least he was willing to give me 40mg of Adderall and 70mg of Vyvanse a day: I lived my life like my grampa drove, all petal-to-the-metal or brakes slammed-on, no middle ground. Woo hoo!"
BipolarReddit,fgbcrh5,t1_fgb9w9s,1580660722.0,"That's... Well, not nice to hear, but kind of relieving. I've been told over and over that the kind of memory loss I experienced wasn't really possible -- side effects are mild, they said, so surely I was imaging the cognitive deficits that crippled me. Of course I remembered my second marriage, and the memory loss surely couldn't reach back into my early 30's (and that hand-eye coordination that no longer allowed me to play videogames was a figment of my imagination as well.) A little reinforcement is needed now, since I'm facing another depressive episode that will end my life if I can't find some relief. Talk about a devil's bargain, huh?"
cripplingalcoholism,fgb0ee8,t1_fgayv8n,1580657266.0,"My pdoc prescribed the 800mg after 6 months of ECT, knowing full well I was a CA. I guess I shouldn't have been surprised later when it came out that he'd murdered his ex-wife by slapping 6 fentanyl patches on her back..."
cripplingalcoholism,fgaxztg,t3_exnvat,1580656562.0,"You haven't lived until you've downed 800mg of Seroquel, chugged a six of Dogfish Head 120 minute IPA then tried to make it up two flights of stairs to bed. That's some fun times. Chairs buddy."
BipolarReddit,fg9wusi,t1_fg8maan,1580644056.0,"That is, sadly, a valid concern. My first round of ECT in 2012-13 was over 40 bilateral sessions, and the entirety of nursing school (2010-11) was completely wiped from my brain. It took me several years to regain my skills, coordination and cognitive integrity to return to work in late 2015. I said for years that I'd never consent to it again, but recent re-exposure to serious and dire depression has forced me to rethink that stance. I'm going to try to hop on the Ketamine express, but if that's not feasable I'll go back under the 'trodes and deal with the consequences."
BipolarReddit,fg85lop,t3_exg1cy,1580610135.0,"Struggling. I'm technically homeless, but another BP friend is giving me a place to stay. I'm too wildly unstable to hold down a job in nursing right now. Going back to ECT looks better and better every day."

cats,fg6780a,t3_ex0akg,1580557180.0,"Long term care (nursing home) nurse here. Those animatronic stuffed cats are a god-send with dementia patients. While they don't fool cognitively-intact observers for more than a second or two, the random purrs, meows and movements are entirely convincing to the residents, and fill them with feelings of love and satisfaction. The live cats we have, while wonderful, won't stick around for the hands-and-lips-on-contact that the demented need. The realistic baby dolls are the only other thing that work nearly as well, and then usually only with women who have children and grandchildren. The men respond to the cats. My heart goes out to you and your husband. I hope the facility he's in is one of the better ones. Please take care of yourself while you support him -- ideally with a real cat or two of your own."

bipolar2,fg40v6c,t1_fg3yjv2,1580493806.0,Absolutely. I was on 800 whopping mg of it for years to combat both hypomania and depression. It's an extremely effective drug if you can tolerate the side effects.
bipolar2,fg3uc6x,t3_ewogfg,1580489843.0,PRN Seroquel is the most effective way to arrest a manic or mixed state for me (disclosure: my diagnosis got changed to BP1 a month ago.) Maybe ask your doc about that?
BipolarReddit,fg3p1kz,t3_ewnfis,1580486589.0,"My ex, BP1, would take my Viagra and insisted it increased sensitivity. Be aware it was largish doses, though... 50-100mg."

BipolarReddit,ffzhbp7,t1_ffzclk4,1580379133.0,"My depressive last decade corresponds with my nursing career... In fact, my shrink thinks I need to abandon it (and move!) Maybe timing too? I turned 50 last year, and my 40's were just a total fucking shit-show. I'm lucky (?) that nearly everyone in my orbit is also bipolar, so at least I receive some empathy... But my ex-fiance went manic a few months back and now is a prostitute living on the streets, addicted to crack. So there's that."

BipolarReddit,ffnwg7b,t1_ffnu6mp,1580071624.0,"The consensus among those who were around me at that time is that it helped. I wouldn't know -- I was so severely cognitively compromised I can't tell. My memory was destroyed (nursing school and my career erased from my brain) and I suffered from poor coordination and continued cognitive impairment from then on. Now I'm starting to show signs of early-onset dementia. So no, it wasn't worth it to me."

As a male partner on the other side of the story (manic wife became sugar baby, then eventural out-and-out crack whore) I'd like to reiterate how dangerous it is to stay with someone who cavorts with prositutes or is one. I'll avoid TMI and just say that I got the STI testing when I found out, and now I have several uncurable diseases. My sex life is over for as long as I live. Please folks, take care of yourselves.

The naltrexone is a useful little opiate antagonist that'll help you knock out cravings and reduce rewards if you do actually drink. Sounds like the psych unit found reason to suspect you could have a depressive disorder, totally common in alcoholics. As a nurse, Bipolar patient and recovering alcoholic I strongly advise you to give the meds a try, especially the nal. It can literally be a lifesaver w almost no side effects."
