Campaigns for parliament elections on Feb 8th have kicked off!

- Drug gangs decided to get their manifesto out first by killing and cutting up the body (on video) of a 17 year old. While people were still wondering if they were watching a Narcos episode, elsewhere a man was beaten up and set on fire. Irish people are not accustomed to this kind of violence so all went to their drug dealer for some medication.

https://www.rte.ie/news/crime/2020/0117/1108136-mulready-woods-drogheda/

- Tim Cook from Apple showed up to remind everyone that it doesn't matter who wins the election just so long as they remember who is really in charge. Tim was given a special award for allowing Irish prime ministers to say ""Ireland is the tech capital of europe"" for 30 years.  (all your tech is sh't apparently).

https://www.irishtimes.com/business/technology/apple-played-key-role-in-making-ireland-tech-capital-of-europe-1.4145311

- The current ruling party (Fine Gael) decided it was unfair that all the other parties had already made themselves completely unelectable. So they decided to commemerate the stormtroopers who fought *against* the rebellion in the Irish War of Independence. Hoping that showing a complete lack of knowledge of history (the stormtroopers were very much on the dark side) would release them from the burden of doing government stuff.

Yes FF crashed the economy like a bunch of monkeys. But correct me if I'm wrong, I don't remember FG pointing out the coming crash.

Then FG followed the FF recovery plan verbatim once they came into power. Bondholders were looked after. They had options to do something different. Also the 'successful' economy you speak of is to return it to just short of the way it was in 2007.

A lot of the EU,US stuff you talk about is good, but again what separates the parties? For the question, 'should we try and accommodate multinationals by any means necessary for the sake of jobs', both would answer yes.

northernireland,fekcy34,t1_fegt4mp,1579197439.0,">Of course I know, but people in the ''south'' wont accept anything less than the tri color.

Southerners have no particular attachment to the flag. When they decide to be ultra nationalists the flag becomes green-white-yellow anyway.

Some people will complain if you change anything, but it's green-white-orange is supposed to represent catholics and protestants coming together. If the 'orange' part of society don't feel that then it loses its usefulness. As it's already a 'compromise' flag then a different 'compromise' flag is not such a big step.

The only backlash might be if someone wants to replace it with some other nationalistic symbol.

Personally I think we should take that new NZ fern flag. It was awesome and would be something to laugh about."

todayilearned,fek8jab,t1_fejtlrw,1579194836.0,">It's time Irish people did the same* tbh...

Probably not obvious from outside but this had largely happened by the 2000s. 'Blaming the english for everything' had become a joke and several high profile events that were unthinkable a generation ago (Queen's visit, british anthem at croke park) were hugely welcomed.

However brexit and the rise of english nationalism has caused a reciprocal rise in Ireland. Especially Tory ministers are prone to having big mouths while being poorly educated on history. It's probably regressed to a 1990s pre good friday agreement level of dislike now. But I'm sure bojo will roll out a piccanninny equivalent phrase for irish people and send it back to the 1980s."

Compare the forewarned soviets and their preparations at the battle of kursk.

Even if the movie is an exaggeration, it's only compensating for Alan Turing's suicide while circle jerk movies about bouncing bombs were being made."

And isn't the growing power of the Taoiseach and their inner circle (not just here but other countries too) going against the ethos of having a parliament?

Am I supposed to say person A will make a better Taoiseach therefore I'll vote for person B who happens to be of the same party? Seems borked.

RTE should support how it's supposed to work, not how the previous governments decided how it would work."

I feel like the most succesful companies I know are the ones that are the best advocates for their own customers. It's not necessarily saying yes, but it is listening a lot better. If this company ever intended to move to non-english countries then having a motivated beta customer would be ideal."
MapPorn,fedocnp,t1_fed8588,1579016347.0,"It's not just the famine, but more the mismanagement factors that caused the famine. Ireland's a good example of how long it can take to undo the effects of colonialism (as in generations).

It's not like freedom comes and suddenly there is a functioning country. Social and economic capital takes a long time to develop. Most of the land remains in the hands of colonials who are used to a rentier economy. If you try to do land redistribution then the international markets will often shut you out. Also getting a strong judiciary that's enough to stand up to even elected leaders (hard to maintain too as we see lately).

Ireland was very fortunate though to get out before the second wave of cold war imperialism and then to be part of an open stable market like the EU.

Nation building is hard. In Europe we tend to forget how many generations it took to build the democracies we have."

- if only the red is visible, you could probably get away with a lot less framing if you can attach it to the wall.

- i personally find a jigsaw difficult to use accurately. Woodworking is like lego if you get the pieces cut accurately and square, and like play-doh if you don't. Is there a woodworking workshop you can get access to? A couple of hours with a mitre-saw would be a joy cutting a bunch of same length pieces compared to a jigsaw."

You're basically looking at museum island. Once you line up Nikolai-Kirche as the big church on the right (a little up from the spree writing) and Marienkirche as the church on the top left it should be easy to see on a modern map.

The big square building in the middle is the palace/schloss that is being restored (best seen from a foot path on the south bank of the southern river branch)."
