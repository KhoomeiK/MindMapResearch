LightNovels,ff9mam6,t3_esdytp,1579715977.0,"I remember seven years ago, about 2015 when the most popular litrpg light novel at the time was legendary moonlight sculptor. Unfortunately, the author only writes in Korean and there are very few dedicated websites in translating his work. Back then we slugged through google translator version of the latest chapters just so you can continue learning about Weed's antics.

The point is it is up to the reader how much he/she can tolerate in terms of imperfection from a newb writer.  I mean no one is putting a gun in our head to read something that you find intolerable. I hope you find a light novel that can reach your standard. Good luck!"

litrpg,fek4cfx,t3_epk1aj,1579192336.0,"I don't like Kong since time immemorial mainly because of the whole father of LitRPG thing, but concluding he is lazy because he only writes 800 pages in a year is kinda absurd.

You don't know what he invested in the book in the first place. Maybe his original draft was a million pages long.  Then there is research. Then editing, adding or subtracting plot lines from your beta readers or editor,  then redraft.

All I know as a noob writer is that actual writing is only like 30-40 percent of the actual work done in publishing a book.

Just to give you a better perspective, READY PLAYER ONE barely has 400 pages. Does that make Ernest Cline a lazy bum? Two of my favorite books, life reset and Occultist, have an average of 500 pages for each book.

I cannot give an opinion on kong's book itself because I didn't bother to get it in the first place."
litrpg,fek1xqq,t3_epfllj,1579190869.0,"To answer your original question, no I am not bothered by the lack of translation. The story/novel was obviously originally in a different language. The fact that someone has kindly translated it for me is good enough. If the translator updated the system notification then it is icing in the cake. It is all up to me to either accept or not the quality of the translator's work.

That being, I also do not agree with your ""point."" Because I am not bothered by the lack of translation,I am not interested in the numbers, therefore I am not really interested in LitRPG? That is not a point of fact, it is simply an opinion. 

First of all, I do not agree with your definition of LitRPG. I do not care what graph or forum or some blogger you want to choose as your source of the definition of the genre. Since the genre is still very young, I do not consider anyone as an expert in the genre. No one is.

So the only one that matters in my LitRPG preferences is myself. I don't care what others call the book I am reading. Whether it is gamelit, progressive, LitRTS, or whatever people want to label it. If it has stats or system, then its LitRPG to me. And I love LitRPG."
