If you are a top rate earner it’s worth it, but (depending on how many expenses you can legitimately deduct) it may not be worth it for 20% income tax rate payers."

Apart from virgin the majority of isps use the same BT vdsl/adsl connection which has massive variation depending on where you live in the country. Even a house a few doors down the road can have massively varying speed that has nothing to do with the isp."

BritishSuccess,ffjbadw,t3_eswih1,1579994691.0,"I believe this whole story apart from when the BTP got on.

You said you were running for a train. If you are that late and departure is imminent there is no way enough time for your argument to escalate enough that the BTP get called and respond before the train has already pulled away.

So here’s what really happened:

You got on, asked the guy for the seat, he told you to fuck off.   You meekly walked away and whilst standing in the aisle on your way home concocted the revenge fantasy of 4 BTP officers giving the guy justice and posted it on reddit to make yourself feel better."
BritishSuccess,ffjavn4,t1_ffdaso1,1579994452.0,"What normally happens is people passive aggressively sit in the aisle seat, put their bag on the window seat, get a laptop out and put headphones in and look super busy.
They are counting on British people not wanting to interrupt them so they can keep their double seat. 

It probably works well on a train where there are plenty of seats still left.

I’ve never once seen it work on a busy train thigh and it just annoys the fuck out of the next commuter"

IAmA,fexfwwl,t1_fewufiz,1579430329.0,"Dealer invoice is what the dealer theoretically paid for the car, but there are so many other  kickbacks and discounts that appear off-invoice that it makes the invoice price virtually meaningless and mainly used as a sales tool to make the buyer feel they are getting a good deal.

Super simplified example: 
dealer buys a car with a $10k invoice price.
If he buys 10 cars from the same place he gets a rebate of 30% of the total spend, but paid via a totally different piece of paperwork.

So he can now show you the invoice price of 10k, even though he only really paid $7k"

In fact if she tried to restrict me to only ever playing tennis with her, then she would be considered a bit of an asshole for being so controlling."
