funny,fezd6nv,t3_eqrcsa,1579456111.0,I was shovelling in front of my house yesterday. Luckily my door isn't blocked like other people but my front porch is. The snow is soft enough to break when u stomp it but hard enough that it won't break if you try jumping into it. Lol. Tried that. Failed miserably.
funny,feys68n,t1_feyr8om,1579449937.0,"As of right now, some people have dug themselves out, some can't because of their situation. They are waiting for external help which no one knows when it will arrive. Roads are a mess, everywhere is closed. There's literally nothing  outside except snow clearing vehicles. But the snow does not seem to reduce at all. It's gonna snow again tonight. So yeah, GG.  But thank God for wifi ,right?"
