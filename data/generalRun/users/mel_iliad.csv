dogs,feqbx0p,t3_eq9ac8,1579339970.0,I used the advice of other cocker owners on the forum and alot of the measures were common sense once I thought about it....like keeping the inside of the ear flaps shaved clean and the ears should be looked at once or twice a week if your dog has problems.  But I didn't even know dogs could have this problem because you cannot know what you don't know.  I bought an ear harness that is a small contraption that keeps the ears pulled back from the head and doesn't hurt or annoy the dog.  Turns out that ear troubles are very common in all dogs which was a surprise to me.  I also find it interesting that a few of the long time cocker owners have also said that chronic problems can be a sign of an underlying problems.  I also contacted my dog's breeder and she said that the only ear care she ever does is to wipe her dog's  ears out once a week with a moistened with water cloth and she keeps her show dogs in long coat.  But....my girl likes to water retreive in the summer.....just like any Lab so I am hyper-vigilant.

But don't discount preventative measures that can be taken once it is cleared up. When my (then) puppy began digging at her ears that is where we went straight off to figure out what was going on.  The medication and ear cleaning demonstration that I got from him was what cleared up the trouble.  I then used the advice from the forum to prevent future problems. My point shoud have been that your dog might not have to live with chronic ear infections but you need to know what is going on and get the right stuff to treat it.  The forums helped me inform myself about ways to prevent it from happening again.  I learned something about bacterial infections that I didn't know, vetstudent.  You can bet I am going to table that topic for discussion at my dog's next well check just to better inform myself."

I called my dog to me and got ready to leave because many working line GS dogs are NOT good with other dogs.  However, the dog was very neutral and did not look at the smaller dogs like they were game or a meal.  So the  GS just had a good time sniffing and checking out the park while the Beagle, now he was all about the smells and ignored the other dogs, keeping his nose on the ground....he had things to do.  So the bigger dogs started crowding the Beagle, who didnt like the social pressure and started to bay greivously...obviously annoyed.  At the sound, the GS  threw his head up, looked around and ran right over, into the middle of the rude dogs who were crowding the Beagle as if to say, ""Ok, who made my Beagle squwak?""

dogs,fep1dm2,t3_eq9ac8,1579309960.0,"well there are actually two kinds of ear infections that a dog can have in the ear that I know of.  The first is a yeast infection and that you can certainly do something about at home....the second is a bacterial infection and that may require a vet.    First off, you need to figure out which it is.  If it is a yeast infection you can go to the forums of My Cocker Spaniel dot com.  

I know what I am talking about because I have an English Cocker spaniel and she developed a yeast infection when she was quite a young puppy.  The vet assured me balefully  that I would be dealing with ear infections her entire life because she was a cocker.  I just said, ""Oh no, we arent going to do that.""  When I got home, I got on the internet and started to dig aruond.  I found that forum and took some of their suggestions and put them into practice.  When it  appeared to have cleared up, we went back to the vet and I had to insist that he retest her ears to be absolutely sure that the problem was taken care of.  I then asked the vet what the yeast counts per slide (left and right ear were so if this happened  again, I would know how severe the infection was because I now knew what normal counts looked like.  Now, twice a year, I have her ears tested just to make sure the problem isn't starting again.  

So anyway, you need to figure out what kind f infection your fur baby has and you need to inform yourself about spaniel ears and come up with a plan for management.  My girl has never had another yeast infection and never had a bacterial infection at all.    If you absolutely cannot afford a vet to find out whether bacterial or yeast, then there are signs you can look for to tell the difference.  You also need to learn how to clean your dogs ears."

There are probably all sorts of good videos on the internet to show you how to accomplis this.

If they say yes, I start in with basic obedience theory and explain how things look from the dog's point of view.  If you are trying to train an animal you kind of have to get how to communicate to them in a way that they can actually ""get"" what you are asking, I think.  It is, at its heart, inter-species communication.

You could teach her to turn (whirl in place to the right) and spin (whirl in place to the left).  Teach her the poisition game (lie down, sit, stand, whirl left or right).  then increase the distance using a touch pad (after you transition to actual touch pads from the feed pans.  You can teach her to back up, and then teach her to back only one step at a time.  You can teach her to run with you and move her off of you with an ""away"" command and then calling her back to your side with a hand signal.  You cn teach her to crawl.  Oh and the weave command....you can refine that to stationary movement (dog moves in a figure eight pattern and when you  walk, continues by weaving your legs and then when you walk backwards, the dog moves backwards, weaving your legs by backing up too and when you stop, continues to back through your legs in a figure 8 pattern around your legs.

She has a stuffed lamb that is bigger than she is and she will wrestle with it, mock growling, rolling on her back with it and just beating the mess out of the thing.  She also has a walrus that serves the same purpose.  The small stuffies don't last long with her, she chews them up, squeaker end first."
dogs,fd8pegh,t3_ek9j6y,1578221372.0,"It gets me still after  months:  I recently had to euthanize my 17 year old Beagle and I miss her still.  Every time I come across her stuff, I feel pangs of sadness.  I thougt I  was handling it pretty well until I was at my daughter/s when I saw a picture the two of them hanging in her hall and then I teared up.  One of my dear friends had a pastel portrait done of my old girl as a gift to me at Christmas and I bawled my eyes out when I opened it.  Now you need to know that I am not a cry at the drop of a hat, overly emotional sort of girl.  I am pretty reserved for the most part but utterly devoted to my people and animals."
dogs,fd5zzwr,t3_ek3sar,1578183649.0,"I like all dogs, size and stature not withstanding.   I have alway had medium sized dogs (I dont consider a dog large until they are at least 80 lbs.),  But I am getting older and smaller is easier managed so I got a small dog (30 lbs)....but I miss having a medium sized dog but I like the smaller size so maybe I'll just get another, larger dog.  You can never have too many....lol!!!  Really small dogs are very cool but have too many health problems.

I never really knew anyone who personally who had a really small dog until I met my best friend, Patricia, who had a Silky Terrier.  This little guy was smart as a whip and knew and understood more spoken words than any dog I have ever met."
dogs,fd5tlya,t3_ek4d7f,1578181366.0,"Nah, mine eats it at least once a month in the cold season.  She likes it well enough that she actively ""shops"" for it.  She looks through my purse, my guests' purses, my pockets, my nightstand and my sister's shelves to get it,"
dogs,fcywp8t,t3_ejjx3p,1578088739.0,"with my dog, we did the obedience thing.  I had her well trained in the house and the yard and at the dog park (outside the fence only).  When she would start to react, I would ask for behaviors and since I 1) Had a strong reinforcement history with these behaviors and 2) had steak or liver treats, she would obey.   I had to work at first to get her attention, but eventually, it became a habit."

dogs,fcrunq1,t3_eiiiul,1577906842.0,"i think contactng a rescue adoption organization or two and starting that process is the best route to go.  In the meantime, I would do some things to mentally stimulate the dog as your time and mental space and pocketbook allows."
dogs,fcrsnsq,t3_eikupv,1577906090.0,"I brought my high strung, high drive english cocker spaniel home from being spayed....(she started to scream on the drive home ), they told me to crate her and keep her calm....which I did, she continued to whirl and scream and promptly dug the cone which wasnt applied correctly right off over her head...screaming  the whole time.  I was in an absolute state of panic.  She acted like this for 3 days following the surgery.  A girlfriend of mine who is a vet tech and a dog person told me to check the receipt for ketamine and sure enough, it was there.   Do some research.  I love this vet but this practice will never put my dog under anesthesia agaain."
dogs,fcrq86s,t3_eikupv,1577905159.0,"look on vet receipt to see if they used ketamine as aneasthesia component.  If not, it could be PTSD or pain.  A remarkable number of vets don't seem to think that dogs need folllow up pain medication."
dogs,fcqhq34,t3_ei1yw2,1577886201.0,"I believe that genetics provide breed tendencies and temperament...they may not fall true in every case but I believe in playing the odds.  It is easier to train a dog that has a propensity for a particular activity.  That is genetics.  If you have a pitbull or bull dog mix that can herd sheep successfully on any level then you have a VERY skilled trainer.  Once I knew a woman who trained her herding dog to pick up a hot dog and hold it in the mouth until she broke it into pieces and gave it to her.  This dog could do her entire heeling routine without breaking the skin of tht hotdog, She only used positive methds to train her dogs.  Again...awesome trainer!!  I saw another trainer walk in with a 10 lb wirehaired mixed breed at her heels.  He looked neither right nor left and was off lead....he stayed right with her."
dogs,fcq47q1,t1_fcn4j8e,1577878357.0,"I havent read any of these studies (but intend to) but have always had the urge to slap people who crow to me that it ""is all in how you raise them"" and they proceed to take their canine weapon in a dog suit to the animal park where an attack happens. Simple observation could have told any casual observer who knows anything at all about dogs, that this is a canine who is dog aggressive justby observing his body language.  Bad treatment as a youngster could exacerbate the problem to be sure but it is not going to change the inherent temperament, or drive of the dog.  Knowledgeable and careful treatment when he is young may ameliorate the problem to some (the result will vary from dog to dog) but I would guess that part of that is prudent management on the part of the people that the dog lives with."
dogs,f7vx05e,t3_dxsok3,1574027846.0,"My dog simply loves the game of hide and seek, which we have played since she was quite young. She will play hide and seek all by herself by hiding her toys in her favorite hiding places and then ""finding"" them....over and over again!!"
