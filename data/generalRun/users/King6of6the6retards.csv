From merriam-webster:

>a thick sauce of meat and chilies.

or:

>Most historians agree that the earliest written description of chili came from J.C. Clopper, who lived near Houston. While his description never mentions the word chili this is what he wrote of his visit to San Antonio in 1828:  ""When they [poor families of San Antonio] have to lay for their meat in the market, a very little is made to suffice for the family; it is generally cut into a kind of hash with nearly as many peppers as there are pieces of meat--this is all stewed together.”"

Its pedantic, sure, but you put bacon in a grilled cheese it becomes a melt. Same thing going on here."
