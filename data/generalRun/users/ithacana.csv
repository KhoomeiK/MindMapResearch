phoenix,fezypdz,t1_few73jj,1579463361.0,"Agreed... although, the current airline layout of PHX (and that of the airport for the foreseeable future) doesn't really require the vast majority of travelers to move between terminals. 99% of connecting flights in PHX are on American and Southwest, and both of those airlines occupy only the massive Terminal 4 (which, by the way, you can walk easily between the north and south sides post-security, not a lot of people realize that). Except for frequent fliers like me, who would be willing to use T4 lounges when on Delta or Alaska flights out of T3, there's not much practical reason for post-security transfers between terminals. 

The real long-term plan for Sky Harbor (which you can find on the airport's website) actually does include a connector building between terminals 3 and 4, which would have gates of it's own, and the very long term plan (when terminal 4 reaches end-of-life) is to build an entirely new ""West Terminal"" over between T3 and the Rental Car center. They are building out the infrastructure for a station at that location in the Sky Train for that now, so that someday a terminal can be built around it."
phoenix,fezsary,t1_few7rne,1579461007.0,">It certainly not by charging exorbitant fees on tourists/ travelers into and out of their cities.

Well, for airport-specific transportation infrastructure, it usually is paid by tourists and travelers, actually. Other people-mover train systems, like the JFK Air Train, charge people $7 to ride when connecting to the local transportation system. That's a charge entirely put on travelers. And here in Phoenix, we have fees on hotels and car rentals, which go to pay for things like the Convention Center and downtown sports arenas... which are overwhelmingly used by travelers and tourists.

>I do not vote for bus services, because tourists and commuters flock to rail and eschew buses in all major cities.

You're right that tourists don't use buses, but that's because bus services aren't *for* tourists. Bus systems are meant to be a fallback, basic form of transportation in cities for people who can't drive, for whatever reason (financial or disability). They are a critical public service for locals, like libraries and schools."
phoenix,fezrda7,t1_few7ztx,1579460677.0,"Well, okay, if you want to put it into percentage terms, yes, going from $2.66 currently to $4.00 on February 1 is technically a ~50% increased fee. And that fee goes up in future years, eventually being just fixed to inflation.

But it's pretty misleading to describe the fee in percentages, because that implies that your entire ride is going to cost 50% more. You seem to be confused by this too:

>How about we double your gas price to pay for the increase?

Um, no. That's not how fixed fees work. They are charged regardless of the overall cost of the trip. They aren't a percentage-based tax. A $15 ride from downtown (where I live) to PHX goes up $1.34, and a $45 ride from east Mesa goes up 1.34, and a $150 ride from Tucson goes up 1.34. That's a pretty modest increase, if you ask me. It's $1.34 more at pickup and $4.00 more at drop off (which had no fee before, despite using the exact same infrastructure). Taxis, by the way, have lower fees, because the *city bans taxis from passing those fees on to customers*, and in return guarantees them certain rates for downtown area trips. They also get charged much higher franchise fees to operate at the airport.

And if you ask the airport themselves (who asked for these fee increases), they say it's revenue to help pay for maintenance, improvement, and development of the entire ground transportation system at the airport, including the SkyTrain, which is part of a decades-long strategy to ensure the airport does NOT become congested with traffic the way other urban, space limited airports like LAX have."
phoenix,fezoxi9,t1_fewxd0b,1579459833.0,"LAX will tell you that traffic congestion absolutely increased with the advent of Uber and Lyft. Because before, most visitors (who don't have local family and friends picking them up) got on buses that took them to rental car areas. Or they got into well-organized taxi queues. Uber and Lyft appeared and suddenly nearly every single passenger was trying to match with an individual car, not in any kind of queue. 

Separately, you're right about increased flights too... And that's why LAX fucked up by not building a people-mover system when they had the time, space, and chance to in previous years. They are building one now, at 2020 prices, with an already at-capacity airport. 

PHX built their SkyTrain (which these Uber and Lyft fees are going in part to finance), which some people seem to think was a ""waste"" (it isn't, it's actually running at full estimated utilization), but it means that PHX is well-prepared to prevent the same kinds of curb congestion in the future that LAX has experienced already."
phoenix,fezo0xn,t1_fezf6rw,1579459523.0,"They have landing *fees* - a charge directly related to the costs of providing the service related to the fee (landing a plane on a runway, talking to traffic controllers, parking at a gate, benefitting from security). A *tax* is a general, compulsory charge on everyone that doesn't necessarily have to be related to a quid pro quo (for example, paying property taxes that go into the government budget, and are eventually redistributed to schools, whether you have kids that attend or not).

I'm saying, by the logic of people objecting to increasing fees on Ubers (which are third party vehicles conveying passengers into the terminal building... just like the aircraft are), then the airport would have no right to raise or change landing fees, ever, if you want to think that Prop 126 (ban on increased service taxes) applies to fees. It would also mean that the airport can't ever raise rents or charge any new fees to business tenants like restaurants, or to any other third-party business that takes advantage of the publicly-owned airport. 

Prop 126 was never intended to prevent airports from controlling their own usage fees. And the fee charged to Uber and Lyft is not a ""tax"", despite what Uber and Lyft would like to call it. A tax would be a charge on *all* Uber and Lyft, and taxi, and shared ride services, everywhere in the city, county, or state, regardless of destination, and would go directly into the government budget. That is not at all what the airport pickup and drop-off fees are for.

We can have a separate debate, if you want, about whether the fee increase is reasonable and worthwhile, or not. The airport says it is, and the Phoenix city council agreed. If we think we know better than the airport on how they need to spend their money... okay, but we (including Uber and Lyft) better make a well-reasoned argument, not just ""waaaaahhhh... it's a tax and I don't like it""."

AmItheAsshole,feuqvpe,t1_feumchv,1579389078.0,"Well, as I said above, part of the problem is how people understand the concept of ""rewards"" for lost things. The original concept doesn't actually come from people paying for others who ""randomly find"" the lost thing. 

The real reason the concept exists in society is to incentivize someone who *already knows something* about a missing person or item - even if that's the thief themselves - to come forward, because you're now paying them more than staying silent is worth to them. 

For some reason, people falsely believe advertising a ""reward"" for something like a pet - which can ""lose itself"" through no fault of anyone, is a useful economic incentive. It isn't. You really shouldn't offer rewards for lost animals at all, unless you're under the impression it has been stolen - because it doesn't actually increase the (already slim) chances the animal will return. The owners are mistaken in thinking a $500 reward is going to cause a lost cat to come home any sooner, if it wasn't stolen. 

That false incentive is *exactly* why so many people on here - regardless of whether you feel there is *technically* a debt owed - would not feel comfortable accepting money for finding the cat. Because most of us inherently recognize we're not actually responding to a reward incentive, but rather just the incentive of good human nature to return a lost animal to it's owner.

As critical as I've been of both parties in this situation, it's likely that if the posters were hung up without any reward at all, and everything happened the same way, the OP still would have returned the cat.

I’m not saying the OP didn’t have a *right* to ask for the reward money. I’m saying that it’s *supremely petty*, especially for people who describe themselves as “affluent” and openly say that the money doesn’t matter.

There are plenty of cultural interactions we all engage in that create minor debts that we all technically owe each other, but which we build interpersonal goodwill by simply forgiving without reciprocation. Helping people carry their groceries, helping a friend move, buying someone a round of drinks, returning a lost object.

But on the other hand, most Americans would also politely refuse a cash reward from a neighbor if they just casually found a lost pet. I would do that too. I can’t imagine being petty enough to proactively ask for a reward I didn’t really do anything to earn, and then go online and complain about it later."

But I also *can’t imagine* being petty enough to ask a neighbor for the reward if I just randomly found the animal. That’s being mildly asshole, to be honest. I would always return a neighbor’s pet if I found it, and I would never think of asking them to pay me for that. If they tried to pay me, I’d refuse. As a pet owner myself, it’s rewarding enough to know I had saved an animal and returned it to it’s family. 

There are things in the world worth a lot more than a minor amount of (undeserved) money, like being kind to your neighbors. It’s not like the OP incurred $500 in costs, went $500 out of their way, or we’re going to keep the cat if they didn’t get paid."
AmItheAsshole,feu7oj0,t1_fesdvx2,1579383894.0,"Eh, the point of rewards like this is often to entice a person who actually *stole* something to return it “no questions asked”. The idea being, you’re advertising your willingness to ignore a crime and pay off someone to simply return the thing which you value a lot more than they do. 

When it’s a reward for information about a wanted person, the money is meant as an incentive for someone *who may already know something*, not really for someone to go looking and seek the reward. 

Problem is, people don’t understand that, and think a high “reward” for a lost pet will make it more likely that the pet will return. Obviously, the pet doesn’t know that and isn’t incentivized by it to return. And when a random stranger finds the pet, it’s probably just being a good citizen to return the lost pet if you can. 

It’s not like you did $500 worth of work, or incur $500 in costs to being the cat back. 

So, I guess, go ahead and ask for the money - the owners were dumb to post such a large reward. But it’s also kind of petty to demand the reward money... you didn’t really do anything to deserve it."

Ironically, the way this airport is financed is highly *conservative*. We could have a state-owned airport that just pulls money straight out of the state budget, paid by everyone in the state whether they use it or not. Instead, we have an airport that is financed by user fees - the “pay for it only if you use it” mode advocated by Republicans who want to privatize schools and roads and other public services.

Showerthoughts,fepum9w,t1_fepnalt,1579331887.0,"There’s a common misunderstanding of terms.

People often confuse “PTO” and “Vacation / Sick” accrual when comparing jobs. But they usually mean different things, representing different accounting methods. Some people who have only ever worked under one system may not realize there’s another system, and think the terms mean the same thing.

It’s not a universal rule, but generally companies that use the term “PTO” are referring to “single bucket” systems, where you have a single “bucket” of earned hours that can be used to take time off for any reason - sick, vacation, personal time etc. It all comes out of the same total hours earned. 

Other companies, like mine, have “two bucket” systems where “vacation” time is accrued and accounted for separately than “sick” time. We get a standard 15 days of vacation, and 10 days of “sick” time. But the sick time doesn’t roll over year to year, and the vacation time does. You can also take vacation time if you run out of sick time, but not the other way around. We do *not* call it “PTO”, because although both are forms of “paid time off”, they are not interchangeable. 

So if someone said to me, “you get only 15 days of vacation? I get 20 days of PTO!”... I would point out that I am never expected to use a vacation day when I’m sick, and I can save them up. If you add my 10 sick days into the mix, I have the equivalent of 25 “PTO” days."

Seriously, “wait until marriage” is some of the worst advice in the world. For the sake of both partners, people should ABSOLUTELY have sex before getting married.

Here in Phoenix, Google Fiber was supposed to roll out a few years ago, and Cox hurried to roll out Gigablast fiber with no data caps. Then when Google decided to cancel, Cox got comfortable with their monopoly again, and rolled out data caps to everyone."
phoenix,fcnhax7,t1_fcng2oi,1577811697.0,"Yes. There is very little vacant “Class A” office space in downtown Phoenix. Older buildings that aren’t fully renovated or updated aren’t “Class A” and immediately get written off by larger corporations and employers seeking premier office space - like finance firms, tech companies, multinationals, law firms and accounting, etc."
LifeProTips,fcmpdp4,t1_fcl26ew,1577785619.0,"Sometimes. But uninsured people usually won’t be charged the $200, simply because the hospital knows they won’t see it - the hospital will instead either try to get the person into Medicaid, some other program, or charge a much lower cash rate.

The $200 price isn’t there because they hope specific people will pay it in cash (although some extremely wealthy foreign people who travel to the US for treatments might do so). It’s set high to give lots of room for insurance companies to bid lower negotiated rates. 

In other words, if the hospital sets a sticker price of $20 (their actual cost), they might get insurance company A and B paying that, and C (an especially large and powerful insurer, like Medicare) asking for a discount to $10. And they lose money, because the biggest insurer is paying less than cost. 

But if they set it at $200, they can get A to pay $40, B to pay $25, and C to pay $20. And all three get to tell their patients they “saved them 80-90%”. And the hospital gets paid, on average, higher than cost. 

The sticker prices exist simply as a ridiculous starting point for negotiation between all the players in the system, not as any kind of realistic measure of actual cost."
