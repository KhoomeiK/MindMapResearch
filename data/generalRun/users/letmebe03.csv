CongratsLikeImFive,fepg67a,t3_eqbbn2,1579319675.0,This is gorgeous!! You are super talented.
AMA,fees1pm,t1_fee0egk,1579039987.0,That actually sounds amazing!
AMA,fedzf5l,t3_eooee2,1579023119.0,You sound like my fiancé. What are some of your favorite gluten-free foods?
raisedbynarcissists,fe9vtz3,t3_eo5kk8,1578941865.0,"Impose an 8pm curfew to ""protect my virginity"" until I turned 21 and she found out I was no longer a virgin. 

Also fun to note that I was juggling 3 jobs while enrolled in college full-time, managing a 4.0 the whole way."
raisedbynarcissists,fe9uoae,t3_eo8a8e,1578941618.0,"Yep - you are among folks who share this struggle. I believe I've posted about this before, actually, and I've seen many posts about a weird type of childhood amnesia for kids who were raised by narcissists. 

I have the same problem as you to this day. I'm 26 years old, have been working since I was 19, and still expect the worst when it comes to interactions with my boss, or anyone with authority. You get this horrible pit in your stomach, expecting to be fired or yelled at during each meeting."
bulletjournal,fdu89aw,t3_emta68,1578729303.0,"This is awesome. Plus, you've got an excellent taste in music!"
cats,fdn7um4,t1_fdmj95u,1578579652.0,"You probably won't believe this, but it took our leaving the house for a few days and leaving them to their own devices lol. I'm serious - Cici couldn't stand to look at Ash for probably a month or longer after we rescued her. At that point, I had a work trip and had to leave them alone for a few days. When I came back, so help me - they were best friends. I'm not even kidding. 

Best of luck to you - and congrats on your kitten!"
bulletjournal,fdg0edi,t3_el4du1,1578375513.0,This...is beyond cool. I love Persona 5 and bullet journaling! I absolutely need this in my bujo!!
bulletjournal,fd7oshb,t3_ek8iyi,1578207758.0,"Messy? Ugly? This is gorgeous! I love the bright pops of color. And I'm so happy to hear you're ready to get back to bullet journaling. :) I'm primarily using my bujo for mental health purposes, and it's honestly already helped me so much."
bulletjournal,fd7kf2l,t1_fd7g4q5,1578205875.0,Thank you!
bulletjournal,fd7eeoo,t3_ek6akc,1578203171.0,I cannot stress to you how much I LOVE this!
relationship_advice,fcy6y5z,t1_fcj4kjp,1578075696.0,"OUCH. There's dumping him, but calling his mother? That's a whole other level. I love it."
cats,fcxyq0q,t1_fcx34v8,1578072357.0,"LOL. It's one of my fiancé's socks, and he wears a size 14 shoe. I tried to convince him to buy a special pair of pink socks, but he was less than thrilled over that suggestion... :)"
cats,fcxyign,t1_fcxd515,1578072252.0,Thank you!
cats,fcxygmf,t1_fcx8dwv,1578072223.0,"Awww! Kittens in socks should be a thing. They're so cute! I hope your girl has made a full recovery and is a happy, healthy kitty. :)"
raisedbynarcissists,fcwvz74,t3_ej74zs,1578039928.0,"My nmom used the same scare tactics. However, she was also all over the place. She'd passive aggressively suggest that I just go on and move in with my boyfriend since I visited him so often. So, I did, at 22, which sparked quite the reaction out of her. 

She went silent on me for a long while and then demanded that I come immediately to get the rest of my things...as if this woman was in a life-or-death, dire situation over space. 

My room has remained untouched to this day."
raisedbynarcissists,fcwvspb,t1_fcwv8eg,1578039704.0,"You're absolutely right. It's just hard to accept it, you know? Out of curiosity, do you ever find yourself strangely missing him? Feel free not to answer that; it's a very personal question. 

I find myself missing my nmom at times, but her abuse was emotional, so I'm still trying to accept that it even happened. I'm all over the place right now."
raisedbynarcissists,fcwvp7w,t1_fcwol17,1578039582.0,"This is very, VERY true."
bujo,fctm3mp,t1_fcpziq3,1577948456.0,"This is excellent advice. I think I'd do well with not spending toward the specific goal of treating myself to coffee, like a cheat day lol. Thank you!"
raisedbynarcissists,fcnj1ti,t3_ei4bbp,1577812655.0,"Yes. It's the strangest feeling. I'm processing everything that happened to me as a child and young adult, and in many ways, I'm grieving the loss of someone who is very much alive and well. I'm grieving someone who, turns out, never really existed."
bujo,fcmh4mi,t1_fcmgbxg,1577775056.0,"Something that's helped me tremendously with saving has been to have my work send part of my paycheck directly to my savings. I don't even see that money until I log onto my online savings account. It somehow helps me mentally not to see that extra chunk of change on my paystub, as it goes directly to my savings via direct deposit. 

Thank you for your kind words, and I wish you luck in your savings endeavor as well! It's so much better to look at your savings as another bill. I've ultimately reached the point where I have forgotten that my savings account even exists. (Unfortunately I remembered around Christmas time though, ugh lol). Good luck!"
bujo,fcmf9va,t1_fcmd0cy,1577773109.0,"Oh wow, thank you! I'm pretty new to the bujo world, so that means a lot to me! Happy (no) spending!"
bujo,fcmbp5j,t1_fcmb570,1577769762.0,"Definitely not time out of the house - I'm actually quite the home body. Also, I live kind of in the middle of nowhere, so no places to walk to. You essentially have to go up and down two hills to get to a secondary road that eventually leads to a main road lol. 

I think I just need to get more dedicated to making my own coffee at home. (And also maybe more time out doing free activities.)

Thank you for commenting and trying to help out!"
bujo,fcma45h,t1_fcm6nzq,1577768390.0,"So this is embarrassing...I actually work from home and have not only an espresso maker that also automatically makes cappuccinos and lattes, but I've also got a ton of syrups and a regular coffee maker. I'm just reckless with my money and prefer going out for coffee lol. Hopefully this helps me fight the urge!"
