Women’s hygiene products are not hemorrhage control devices. They aren’t designed to pack wounds which are dumping pints of blood, they aren’t visible under xrays, and they aren’t packaged well enough to get jostled around in a CLS bag for months. Hemostatic gauze, pressure dressings, TQs, and chest seals exist for a reason. here’s an example: on the left is a tampon pulled apart. On the right is a single package of hemostatic gauze.
I know some of us “grew up” in an environment where misinformed leadership told us tampons could seal bullet wounds but jesus, let’s let that myth die
