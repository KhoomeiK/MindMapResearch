worldnews,ffqdtp7,t1_ffq99gp,1580131568.0,I never assumed or implied that all countries have embassies in all countries. I also never said anything about having a right to demand it.
worldnews,ffq6zmm,t1_ffq6l2b,1580123845.0,"I can understand your view. Back to our previous subject, I just think its odd to say an embassy should be taken out. Wouldn't you want that to be only American thing left there? Assuming that peace is the end goal."
worldnews,ffq6iyd,t1_ffq2niq,1580123162.0,You said that to someone else that is why I never saw it. Do you just not like Americans in general?

worldnews,ffq0nh3,t1_ffq0cgw,1580113968.0,I never said they don't play a role at all did I? I said they sure as hell aren't military bases or military command centers.
worldnews,ffpyre0,t1_ffpw9iy,1580111333.0,They aren't though. We use literal command centers for that. I don't understand why we would illegally hide a military base as a embassy that cant even defend itself. When you can literally use a real military base and put whatever you want there.
worldnews,ffpw3yr,t1_ffpvm7q,1580108001.0,Why would they need a fake shitty military base? They have you know real ones...

Yes them invading Poland was because of geo politics its a bad move to let someone next to you eat a whole pie when you can get a slice Although my response was to your second ""paragraph"" if you can call it that. You know the one where you claim russia would of done nothing. You are wrong buddy the soviets would not of supplied hitler until he took over europe that would just being screwing themselves over.

I don't even know why you are saying fuck off. Did I at some point get hostile with you or does your reading comprehension stop you from understanding what I wrote? Are you going to down vote this comment also because you don't agree with what is essentially common sense?"

I was talking about how when you mention anything about more vetting people just call you racist and completely ignore your argument. I know this because I live in california and its happened to me multiple times."
worldnews,ffau0ya,t1_ffa0c2j,1579744472.0,"That is flat out just not true. Geopolitics would literally demand a response from the Soviets. If they did nothing at all eventually a strong european country would have no direction to go except east. Hence why you have so many wars throughout history between ""friends"" in the world of geopolitics if you make move A I have to make move B."

I was saying the lotto hate on reddit amuses me. They dont even have a different opinion from me they have a fictional insane opinion that people play the lottery because they think they have a good chance. No one who plays thinks they are going to win
todayilearned,feiq75k,t1_feim7zc,1579144472.0,"I see people on reddit hate on lotto players all the time. I don't play but people in my family do and its just for fun. There is no end of neck beard kids on reddit claiming ""If people play the lotto they are by definition bad with money and will forever be poor and everyone who does it is retarded. Why dont they invest in blah blah blah"" funny considering those same kids are paying their WoW subscription every month and is that a waste? People dont understand for some people its just a hobby and not some get rich quick scheme. Granted its poor people who mostly play but I mean what else are they gonna spend their small amount of disposable income on another happy meal and get fat or a ticket for fun?"
news,feihhng,t1_fehbj2l,1579138645.0,The reason people argue that quote specifically is that its pretty obvious he wasn't talking about literally grabbing them by the pussy. He was going on and on about how awesome he thought it was to be rich and a celebrity. Lets be honest here every famous person ever knows exactly what he was saying. If you are famous and rich a lot of people want to sleep with you when they would not normally.

Literally looking at some of them right now and the picture has a arrow pointing at the ground that says soviet anti air and all you can see is blurry ground. It doesn't even look like anything is there.

worldnews,fdz0uor,t1_fdyrn7h,1578785528.0,"It got down voted because it is Reddit and there are mobs of foaming at the mouth liberals on here. Someone on here the other day was calling for people to ruin family holidays with ""facts about Trump your republican family members cant refute"". So all I said was ""tell me some of these irrefutable facts"". I literally got down voted to hell and told by three people I was obviously a idiot and a troll if I don't know. I swear they are at the point if you ask how is he racist? They reply WE ALL AGREE HE IS YOU RETARD then all laugh because they ""know"" they are correct."
news,fdphsez,t1_fdnmwjr,1578628986.0,"The problem is you can have a fact that two political parties see differently. 

Im pro gun but as an example. 

Fact - Less guns = Less gun murders.
See a liberal would think this is a fact. A conservative may think this is a lie.

Fact - More guns = More self defense less murders.
A conservative would think this is fact. A liberal would think its a lie.

Politics is so subjective and most of it is untested. A lot of politicians literally are just saying hey this plan that's never been attempted here under these circumstances WILL WORK! How can you say if its a lie or not?"
todayilearned,fdp4vf6,t1_fdnpdyl,1578620046.0,"One time a friend of mine had his mom telling him that he would go to hell for drinking. So I went to trusty google and googled bible verses about alchohol. Never found one that said never drink although there were a bunch that basically said just don't become a drunk. The one I mainly remember says ""Drink and be merry for god already approves of what you do"" or something like that. After showing her a bunch she said ok nevermind and would let him drink from then on lol."
news,fdmca0e,t1_fdly8k9,1578545360.0,I know you guys are jokingly taking two extreme points. But do you really think guns being illegal would stop criminals in the USA being that there would be so many here already? I get the argument if your country already didn't have millions and you could regulate how many get in. We have 327 million people and almost 400 million guns in the US I don't understand how you would even start. Even if you could get 95% of all guns off the street that still leaves 20 million guns.

But they are justified in killing americans for us leaving a treaty? Jeeze I know everyone hates Trump but you have to do some real intense mental gymnastics.

Literally one of the hardest things I have done in my life. Which is why I laugh when people say weed isn't addictive. I understand they are saying its not like nicotine but anything can be addictive to the right person. The point I was making in that post though was I would not be impaired infact I smoked so much me sober was probably worse.
todayilearned,fdm0naq,t1_fdkvwyy,1578536999.0,Honestly if you only smoke a gram of wax a week you aren't what id consider a heavy smoker. At my heaviest I smoked a 1/8th of flower a day. I didn't even get high at all anymore it functioned more like cigarettes do for normal people. I personally do not like wax because I like harsh hits and its not the same. My brother loves it though and at his heaviest was sometimes going through 2 grams a day. Needless to say he didn't get high anymore either. We both would fiend for weed really bad but didn't get high anymore.

All you do is insult me instead of actually give me some facts. This is why Democrats lost. They would all rather call the most liberal republican president every a racist nazi. Then when you ask why you all never have a reason you just say ""well me and all my friends think he is"""

How exactly am I a hypocrite the section of my comment you posted says nothing hypocritical at all.

I gave you a chance to address real issues. I certainly did but you still refuse to and just throw out insults. I never said Obama is more corrupt than Trump another thing you are just pulling out of thin air. But again I see that you just refuse to take anything normally and instead have to blow it up to world ending proportions like most liberals.

Can you actually prove anything I said was wrong? Or do you only want to address the university because its the only non made up thing you have said so far?"

Lol wait so this link says a ""LEST WE FORGET THE HORRORS: A CATALOG OF TRUMP’S WORST CRUELTIES, COLLUSIONS, CORRUPTIONS, AND CRIMES"". Just reading the first 10 shows how insane you people are. Number 1 saying he didn't think Obama went to the school he says he did.....OMG WHAT A NAZI. Number 2-5 all birther comments lol...OMG WHAT A NAZI. Before you say its racist remember people asked Ted Cruz to prove he was from the US also. Number 6 the Mexico is sending rapists comments...OMG WHAT A NAZI. Again something you guys try to claim was about all mexicans and racist. Which it was literally only talking about illegals who be definition are all criminals coming here. Number 8 Mexico wont fund the wall... Lol I still don't understand are you guys being willfully ignorant about this? Its been clear and he has stated multiple times that it would either be tariffs or flat out buying that much less product from Mexico. The point was never to make them dig in their pockets. Its funny according to people like you trump is mentally retarded but you guys cant even understand his pretty simple statements. Number 9 Trump talking shit to a single person he doesn't like and you guys try to conflate it to sexism against all women lol...OMG WHAT A MISOGYNISTIC NAZI! Number 10 and probably the one that shows you are being the most disingenuous a supporter of his doing something... Do we now hold politicians accountable for everything a random retarded supporter does? By that logic are all liberals horrible because one was splitting open republicans faces at a protest with a bike lock?  

Its funny you think this proves your but everything I see so far is basically a flat out lie by purposely misinterpreting it. After that a good part of the list is sexual harassment allegations all of which the accusers dropped. Honestly considering how willing Democrats are to lie about trump and this list proves it. I wouldn't believe any of them by default unless they could prove.

Time and time again you guys take things that are non issues and try to say they are a huge problem and its laughable. Same with people saying trump did the airstrike to distract from impeachment. When its very obvious he doesn't have to distract from it. All this impeachment shows is Democrats are partisan, out for blood and flat out just impeached someone for nothing. I honestly think he needs to highlight the impeachment, every single Republican I know had their views cemented by the Democrat lies and will be voting for trump even if they didn't before.

todayilearned,fcs68dp,t1_fcr4719,1577912010.0,Funny you say that considering sexism was the reason this woman was a sniper. It was pretty much soviet opinion at the time that women made good snipers because they were naturally sneaky and deceitful.
