Now if they don't exercise their dog, give them something to stimulate them while they're gone or they keep them locked in a cage all day... that's cruel.

Dog's are perfectly capable of being alone. But it's our responsibility to make sure they can be. Such as preparing them to be alone by building up the amount of time they're left alone by starting small... don't get a dog and then immediately leave them alone all day every day.

aww,fdzkpaq,t3_enfcat,1578791149.0,What a beautiful dog
dogs,fdy0ucp,t3_en9rmp,1578774884.0,"idk positive reinforcement would be the ideal way to go but it won't work for all dogs.

Training our dog was more balanced while mostly focusing on positive reinforcement. Our trainer actually recommended we use a prong collar/e-collar and after using them and lots and lots of hard work (seriously it was a lot she was dog reactive and crazy) we're actually able to walk her without either one and she's able to be calm when meeting other dogs. 

It's really about finding what is best for each dog and putting in the effort. That's the biggest thing I've learned through training."
aww,fdthdfa,t1_fdt5em9,1578716783.0,oh my god she is so fucking cute!
aww,fdtgfeb,t1_fdtblt5,1578716399.0,"I can definitely see your point that sometimes there's a medical need for it...

but I'm sure that most of the time it's for the aesthetic. Which is a shame tbh. I can't imagine putting my dog under anesthesia unless I absolutely had to."
aww,fdtfjqs,t1_fdt2u6w,1578716036.0,Wow! How creative!
dogs,fdtf8k8,t3_en2ejh,1578715911.0,Aww she love's you.

Well done"
dogs,fdtc0l5,t3_en286p,1578714616.0,"Oh my god she's stunning! Just an absolute ray of sunshine. 

I'm the same way lmao. I love when people comment about how cute she is but it hits different when they comment about how well behaved she is (all though that might be because her and I both worked hard for that)"
doggos,fdtbiiy,t3_en1xp0,1578714425.0,He looks like he'd be great for cuddling!

Because god forbid you don't trash a breed any chance you get."
dogs,fdt7ctq,t3_en13cx,1578712879.0,"I'm so sorry you had to make that decision. You did the right thing. Not only was she suffering but you were as well. You did seemingly everything you could. I know it hurts right now but you did the best thing for her.

I'm so sorry you and her had to go through this... but I hope it brings you peace to know that she's not suffering anymore. Get well soon."
dogs,fdt5deq,t3_en1g2r,1578712128.0,"Could he be allergic to something in his food? 

All though him being fine for a week on the new food might suggest otherwise... Sorry, that's the only thing I could think of.

Would it be possible for you to get a second opinion from another vet?"

aww,fdsjk8c,t1_fdseiw8,1578703954.0,"I think if he wasn't he'd at least turn his head away. So either he's fine or he's enjoying it.

I wouldn't be surprised if he's a total ham and loving it lmao"

aww,fdsiy3o,t1_fdry7ax,1578703640.0,"that sounds exactly like my dog.

Pitbull,fdnt1z2,t1_fdnde99,1578592261.0,"Yea it would be nice!

We used to have two howlers (though one stopped after the other one passed) and we used to have howling parties. It would be so fun to have one with my current girl 😍"

mostly because there are theories that the bird was taped to the fence."
Pitbull,fdmg2dq,t3_em4gwd,1578548700.0,My girl is talkative when she wants something. Mostly barking and play growls/whines but no howling! I've been trying to get her to do it but i've accepted that she probably never will lmao

dogs,fdibf82,t3_eliy5c,1578439181.0,"No. A lot of dogs are happy being the only dog.

some dogs need to be the only dog and some are just not happy having the owners split attention between another dog."

he got returned and moved from home to home until we brought him home. The bond between him, my other dog and us was instant. They really have a way of choosing their owners!"

AmItheAsshole,fdg1oeu,t1_fdfsgb4,1578376760.0,"He let her think there was a chance she was getting stalked again instead of immediately coming clean. I think that's what makes him TA.

it was probably a genuine mistake but the fact that he let her be freaked out for so long is fucked up."
aww,fdg12bw,t3_el6ov7,1578376152.0,i love when dogs cross their paws like that!
