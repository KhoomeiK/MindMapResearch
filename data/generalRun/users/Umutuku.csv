AskReddit,ffl1rbr,t1_ffjt9qn,1580033181.0,"The advice I always give people for dealing with that is to do some public speaking at some point and just start spouting out obnoxious shit to see just how much you can get away with before someone freaks out or leaves. Say awkward shit to work up a good lather of cringe in the seats. Curse up a storm. Just stare at individual people for a while.

You'd be surprised at what people won't do in the social contract of attending a speaking event (unless they came there to freak out in the first place). You'll start to realize that you are making the situation happen to the audience rather than the audience creating the situation for you. They have to sit there and listen to whatever you have to say or they'll be the ones who have to get up and talk back/leave and shift the glaring eyes of Sauron from you to them. [While you're up there, they're yours.](https://imgur.com/gallery/ZO1uaGn)

Once you're more comfortable realizing that you're leading a crowd of people down a path you want them to travel instead of just being stuck in front of them you've got to think about the speaking itself.

There are a billion and one guides out there on how to give a good speech/presentation and what someone thinks works or doesn't, but all you'll ever need to do at least okay is to have a solid understanding of the subject matter and a real desire to help everyone else understand what's important about it. ""This is what's up. This is why it's so important that I care about it. This is why it's important to you."" It's all just a regular conversation, but with more ears and everyone actually listens to you. What do you do when you're chilling with some friends in the coffee shop and you feel like going off on a political opinion? Channel that shit. What did you do when you were little and wanted to convince your parents that something needed to be purchased? Channel that shit.

Don't worry about having a script or memorizing lines. In fact, I'd suggest trying to use different words and phrasing every single time you practice giving a speech (if it's something important enough to even bother running through beforehand), and then see if you can go the entire speech without re-using them (except for the actual topic jargon, key statistics, etc.). Just decide what the main points are that you want people to know and say shit that matters to you until they know them. You'll never have trouble remembering what to say if you were never trying to say something specific anyway.

Try to stick to speaking about things that you're knowledgeable and passionate about. Otherwise, fake it and or go through those billion and one guides I mentioned earlier until you craft something no one is willing to pay enough to hear.

TL;DR: Step 1 is not giving a fuck. Step 2 is giving a fuck, but about a very narrow bit of information. Step 3 is beating giving a fuck about that bit of information into a bunch of people who can't run away."

What, if anything, are you willing to die for in real life? Would you be willing to die in a teleportation system for that/them?

Or even maintain what they have.

We have centurylink at our shop (as they are literally the only landline available in town), and the service is complete and utter dogshit.

We'll have no calls for an hour and then people coming in to complain that they've been trying to get through for 45 minutes and only get noise on their end with no ring through on ours. Many of them have said they have centurylink too and get the same problems just trying to call their local friends.

A lot of times we'll pick up the phone and can barely hear them because there's a ton of interference and feedback so we have to tell them to hang up, wait a few seconds, and try calling back. Some of them don't so we lose business (not counting the ones that couldn't even get it to ring in the first place). It can sound like trying to communicate through a long chain of walkie talkies in an empty warehouse, dial-up screeching, and interference from radio stations or similar transmissions with any or all happening at the same time. Sometimes it just feeds what we're saying straight back to our end.

We have to constantly monitor the phone on speaker because about half the times we hang it up we don't get back to a dial tone. We'll have times where we'll keep hanging up and won't be able to get a dial tone for 20 minutes or more.

We've been giving the thumbsitters in their tech support the list of known affected numbers that they keep demanding to progress for probably about a year now and they've done nothing (they can't learn anything from comparing hundreds of numbers and times with their system logs). Changing the phones has done nothing. They've sent people out to look at it and shrug uselessly. They refuse to admit that anything in their system could be malfunctioning or in need of repair/replacement.

The whole operation must either be managed by lead-paint-chip-eating boomers that were trained 30 years ago and are trying to look busy without learning a single god damn thing their entire careers, or their heroin-addict grandkids showing up for that nepotism money.

If you have the option, do not use centurylink. They WILL cost you income."
