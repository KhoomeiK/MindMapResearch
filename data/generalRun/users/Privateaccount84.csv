Now, if it was more severe than what you said than it could very well be clinical depression. That said, it isn't gatekeeping to say that there are different levels of depression, and that many people misunderstand that that moody period in their early teenage years isn't the same thing as diagnosed, clinical depression. This isn't like being a fan of something and me saying ""you aren't a real fan unless..."".

coolguides,feh56sg,t1_feglr2i,1579109375.0,"I always wanted to make one that is horror themed. You start with your leg chained to the floor and have to find the key in a room that's got a corpse or two on some medical exam tables, some vials of shit, and lab equipment. 

First thing you have to do is actually pick the lock on your leg to free yourself. Then you can look around the room for clues to get out of the door that has three locks on it (one a number pad, one requiring a key, and a third that requires a key card).

To get the key you'd have to look through a stack of notes from the serial killer who captured you, which mentions the last prisoner died unexpectedly when he choked on something. Reaching down the throat (it would be a synthetic body, you can buy them online), you would have to physically pull the key out to save yourself. Presumably, the last victim had found it somewhere else, heard someone coming, and attempted to hide it in his mouth only to unfortunately choke to death on it.

The code for the door would be found on an old computer, in a folder called ""family memories"". There would be happy family pictures of a man, his wife, and daughter. Then there would be pictures of a funeral service for the daughter who died in some accident (along with copies of notes from people wishing them the best), and copies of divorce papers from his wife. The code to the door would be his daughters birthday (which would be time stamped on a photo of her birthday party, combined with the date on her tombstone). 

And finally, the key cards location would have been hinted at in the notes as ""being somewhere around the work table"" where there are all sorts of nasty, gruesome things to look over. Photos of previous victims, body parts in jars, mystery stains... with the card being at the bottom of an open jar with what looks like a preserved fetus in it, dropped in by mistake by the killer."
Advice,fegamqe,t1_feg6brd,1579085130.0,"I appreciate you taking the time to comment, although I feel I should tell you that if you depression only lasted a year and was cured through music, it definitely wasn't clinical. A bit of a dip in mood during puberty is pretty normal, and that is certainly what my parents originally thought it was when it was happening to me. 

A lot of people see clinical depression as just being sad, which although that is a part of it, it also involve things like feeling tired all the time, less energy in general, anxiety,  suicidal thoughts, inability to enjoy things you once did. 

For example, if I were unmediated I would sleep about 18 hours a day, maybe eat one meal a day, wouldn't bathe, and likely not move very much while awake. Even now I'm pretty atrophied from lack of movement, and this is me doing fairly well."
