AskNPD,ff9xiwv,t1_ff872ho,1579723660.0,"There are a number of things that can make people feel cold and distant. 

Even I do not know what he could be, and he could very well be NPD.

I do find that NPD thrive on fear and demands for approval, and are reactive, but in this day and age, it is hard to find someone who does not react in that way. 

The best thing that we can do is go with the journalistic approach of the 5 Ws: Why, Who, Where, What, and hoW.

Example:

""I feel tired""
""Why so you feel tired?""
""Because it was a stressful day at work and we had a lot to do""
""What was it that made you feel stressed out?""
""I don't know. Probably Jim. He seems to always come at the last minute to give me an assignment.""


It is but an example, and it is not perfect, but it can help.

It is in no way something that won't backfire if it happens.  

:)"
AskNPD,ff81pqc,t1_ff7yebi,1579663689.0,"I do believe that r/narcissisticabuse would be more suited for your needs.

I can understand that you are in need of support and answers, but r/AskNPD 's community can try to help you understand their perception on your issue, but I would like you to keep in mind that this may not be what is going on inside him, and that, regardless of what they tell you here, it has to be taken with this in mind."
AskNPD,ff77ts7,t3_erylm0,1579642822.0,"This is one thing that I feel needs to be clarified before answerring you. 

Would you be so kind to tell me if he has been diagnosed by a clinical therapist?

I think that this will also help others answer you in the best possible manner. :)"

I love you too, Kiwizoom. <3"
cats,ff3ktw2,t1_ff3keew,1579543182.0,"Every cat hate it at first. 

Mine did not either, but I thought that this was a better alternative to potentially hurting the bloodflow on your cat's legs. 

And I really mean potentially, as I don't know if it does."
cats,ff1wip8,t1_ff1a9nw,1579487780.0,"You could also get them an elizabethian collar rather than a onesie, or is this not something the vet recommended for your cat?"
learntodraw,ff1wa9g,t3_eqxwrb,1579487624.0,"I suggest that you look at Ctrl+paint.
The website has a free video library that explains the concept behind blending in photoshop.

Blending is not hard (I know, everyone says it) but it depends of what you want to do.

Technically, in your place, I would first try to blend using the website in the proposed way first, then move on to creating the basic shapes and to blend them all using different lights positions."

Neat."

learntodraw,ff1u6uq,t3_er3ov7,1579486274.0,"It is impossible to remember everything there is in nature, so a ref is definitely useful to bridge that gap.

Now, it is not good or bad to use reference, but there exist limiting ways to use reference, such as copying it straight up as you see it.

If it is the same lighting as your artwork, then fair dues, but you can use parts of a ref to make other things, and if you know the direction of the light in your piece is different than the ref, then all you need is the geometry of the form to be used adequately to shape that light correctly. 

Now this is how to make the best out of a ref for me. :)"

ArtistLounge,ff099wl,t1_fezhw0i,1579466589.0,That is a good way of looking at imposter syndrome and the fear of rejection.
ArtistLounge,ff08qyi,t3_eqy1pp,1579466389.0,"I know where you come from, and I can certainly see why you would feel scared of failure. 

You may think of yourself and your art, separately, but along the same waveline, as not being good enough, and needing improvement.

You may feel that your art is not up to par to what you see from other people, and it makes you think that this gap level will never be met. 

You may feel scared that the community gives you too many critiques, or even fear negativity, but here is the thing that nobody tells you:

When you started to walk, you fell. You cried. You stood up and tried again, and people were there for you.

When you learned to ride a bike, you started with 4 wheels, then 3, and then two, but each step of the way, you had people to tell you where you did right, and where you did need improvement.

If you do feel this way, and you start on and off, there may be the need for some organization and habits in your life. 

Make your bed
Clean your house
Do your dishes
Open a sketchbook and start drawing.

You should not care if you are not good yet, because you can improve, but you can't improve just on your own, just like walking and biking were not just your effort.

You need to post it, and you need to remove the feeling of having your art be too personal for you, so you can objectively see it for what it is: a crystalization of a moment of your life. A photo of a thing you like, but not an extention of yourself. 

The first critique may be harsh, and you may want to run away. 

Who knows? Maybe you are way too critical on yourself and you do amazing stuff, but artists run after progression through doing, not perfection.

Because perfection does not exist. 

I hope that it helps."

He looks more like a Jim to me. ;)"
ArtistLounge,fet3nam,t1_fet0xbo,1579371506.0,"Then you may want to ask yourself about the use of that group, what its goal would be outside of you, and what would be the gain that a user (not you) would gain from it.

I can see how it could sound egotistic to want to have a group, but if, say, you make that group because you believe that you can help a community of artists help themselves grow, outside of your own art, but rather through it, then it could be a good goal to make a group for.

Mind you, this is but an idea. You are free to think of it differently, but you may want to think about it if you have not yet done it.

A group for the sake of having a group is another thing that you will have to manage some of your time towards too. 

You may want to think of that as well, if it is worth spending the time outside of creating artwork to moderate it. 

I used to be a moderator for a few fb groups. A lot of what I knew then may not be the case anymore now, but a lot of people just come to groups to spam dodgy links rather than to discuss your art. 

A lot of people do not see the dodgy links because they are removed quick, or the group has a thorough filtering process that helps them with ""selecting"" good members. 

This is a lot of work, and it also involves mediating when arguments get out of hand. 

I just want to give you broad strokes as to what that could represent. 

A lot of people find groups without an active moderator or admin to be like a plant that you never water. It slowly withers and dies without lasting as long as it could have to bloom and bear fruits. 

Whatever you chose, I hope that I gave you a good representation of what it can mean for you to make one."
ArtistLounge,fesos9a,t3_eqhty8,1579367510.0,"I think that you should do one page for yourself, and not a group, at least to post your art, or snippets of your art. 

People need to find you somehow. ;)"
