ptsd,ffqo39g,t3_euozmh,1580139646.0,I'd like to scream this from the roof. It breaks my heart every time some teenager comes to this sub and says their trauma isn't valid.
TooAfraidToAsk,ffqnf6s,t3_eup1ia,1580139180.0,I'm allergic to pot. Marijuana. Weed. Call it what you want to. It makes me sick. I've been rejected because of it. I've been ridiculed for it. I've told people it makes me sick and they'll still smoke it right next to me.
dogswithjobs,ffp51zz,t1_ffogln4,1580086384.0,Since when are you an expert on service dogs and their training? My SD was originally trained for hearing and mobility but when I developed PTSD after being assaulted Luna learned how to deal with me very quickly. I added psych work to her tasks because she was the only being in existence who could reason with me at the darkest point in my life. Psych work doesn't make a dog an ESA.
service_dogs,ffnhzd1,t3_eub27m,1580066187.0,The handlers think they're establishing dominance over the dog. They aren't. If you can record the behavior please do. Show it to the organization the dogs came from and animal control.
Bad_Cop_No_Donut,ffmgl9x,t3_eu884q,1580054359.0,Really late and driving home from work a cop taligated me without his lights on. I had no idea it was a pig. My only regret is that I didn't break check him.
RATS,ffmg4g1,t3_eu88f4,1580054226.0,"A bagel. It's equal parts treat, toy, and hiding space. Funny to watch too."
cats,ffmfxse,t3_eu88xl,1580054141.0,Shave him and have the vet check him for infection. He might have trouble with his anal glands.
ptsd,ffm9tqq,t1_ffm989w,1580051040.0,I'll take that as a compliment.
ptsd,ffjx7w6,t3_eu13kl,1580009437.0,"Hiding Furby in my store manager's desk drawer and teaching it to say ""guess how long I've been here"" when he opens the drawer would be funny too."
ptsd,ffjwyco,t1_ffjwrmp,1580009226.0,"I am Duck, the demon of chaos. I could yell that at my register. The keyboard wouldn't be functional after that. I'm told they can be but I've never been able to figure it out."
ptsd,ffjwlgs,t1_ffjwhyk,1580008937.0,Two of three would find it funny. I work in a thrift store. I'm full of ideas to cause chaos.
ptsd,ffjvz92,t3_eu13kl,1580008454.0,I throw paper airplanes at work. I'll stand at my register and get a customer a discount coupon I can get one stuck in my coworker's hair. I'm still tempted to set droids loose in the store and let them wander around by themselves. I've been told not to but I might anyway. I still want to turn the managers keyboard into a chia pet. Standing at my register kissing a rat would be fun too. Maybe dance around the store and sing it a love song. I'm still working on some of these.
cats,ffjvhyc,t3_etzlg5,1580008086.0,One cat enjoyed sitting on my pregnant belly. She'd wait for me to sit on the couch and look down like she was on top of the world.

datingoverthirty,ff5z1l7,t1_ff5ywef,1579614796.0,I've had better luck with OkCupid than the others. For twenty dollars a month you get to message people and see more of their profiles.
cats,ff5ypav,t3_erut09,1579614515.0,Because the moment we give them a nudge they act like we're breaking their hearts. Cats have humans very well trained.
datingoverthirty,ff5ylor,t3_erutey,1579614434.0,Try a different app. Not all of the guys on them are going to be creeps.  In my experience it doesn't matter how attractive a woman is. She's going to weed out the jerks. Have you looked at meetup.com and seen what events there are for singles in your area?
cats,ff5y3y6,t3_eruivn,1579614019.0,Take the cat in the middle of the night without telling her.
cats,ff5x1ck,t3_eruja2,1579613087.0,Half of a Benadryl tablet in his wet food at night. It will make him tired. Talk to the vet about a sedative for him. Is he neutered?
cats,ff4e2yt,t3_erlcqk,1579561419.0,"Kitty is always watching. You're being weighed, measured, and found wanting. Kitty is disappointed by your life choices."
WTF,ff0xsng,t3_er3dq8,1579473363.0,I'd say burn it but it's probably capable of starting a fire all by itself.
TooAfraidToAsk,fey0afr,t3_eqvcj8,1579438991.0,I wasn't trying to fix a bad marriage but I was dumb enough to think my ex would change after the baby was born. He did change. He did more drugs and became violent.
cats,fexzgqw,t3_eqvglf,1579438766.0,Everyone was doing it. We all thought it was so cool.
WTF,fexwmw2,t3_eqsxr1,1579437681.0,Am I the only one who would yell hail Satan at that woman?

YarnAddicts,fepptkz,t3_eqceb0,1579327282.0,Is the doggy a cavalier King Charles spaniel? I've never met one I didn't take an instant liking to and they're so cute they can get away with murder.
AnimalsBeingDerps,fepplqs,t3_eqcfk0,1579327089.0,Personal space is overrated. At least it is to cats.

TooAfraidToAsk,feopigm,t3_eq86oa,1579303531.0,You can shave it off. Just be sure to use a mirror. Use a razor that has at least four blades and good old fashioned Barbasol foamy shaving cream. After shaving while you're still damp use a liberal amount of Vaseline. This will cut down on razor burn. Stay away from women's razors. They won't give the close shave mens razors will. I'm a woman who's been shaving down there for longer than you've been living. I'm willing to answer your questions.
RATS,feoovl1,t1_feoorft,1579303278.0,It's an awesome name.

IdiotsInCars,fem8496,t3_epwgdx,1579243196.0,Many years ago I had a traffic cop tell me to go the wrong way down a one way street. When he saw what he had done he stopped traffic to let me make a U turn. I still think it was his fault.
knitting,fem7vj9,t3_epwjex,1579242931.0,It's pretty. I've been working on lace fingerless gloves for six months and I think I finally got the hang of it.

AskReddit,fem4nu4,t3_epvmrl,1579239631.0,"It can be argued that I'm homeless but I don't see it that way. I have a roof over my head, clothes on my back, and food in my tummy. The roof might be a Chevy Suburban but I've had less in life. I was left homeless when I tried to escape domestic violence. I've had to rebuild my life with nothing, for nothing, in a place where I have nothing, and with newly acquired disabilities. Next month I start the process of buying a house. I've succeeded and made a comeback but I don't wish homelessness on my worst enemy. I started out homeless in Boston and I fed the rats in the park because it scared people away from me. Scaring everyone let me sleep safely at night."

survivorsofabuse,felper2,t3_ept41f,1579227713.0,"Honesty isn't mean. Coming out and telling your dad you don't owe him anything and want nothing to do with him isn't mean. Again, honesty isn't mean. Have you done any research on PTSD? What you describe in your post is classic symptoms. Even if you can't see a therapist researching on your own can do you a world of good."
dogswithjobs,feloftv,t3_ept7hv,1579227047.0,I love her sweet face.
husky,felo9ak,t3_ept9o2,1579226924.0,"It's unfortunate but like the vet said, wait and see. Depending how bad the break is it might heal on it's own but don't be surprised if it has to be amputated. Worst case scenario the tail is cut off she'll recover surprisingly fast. I had a cat lose one back leg and most of his tail. He recovered before his humans did. It really surprised me how quickly an animal gets back on their feet after losing a limb."

abusiverelationships,felmsx4,t3_eptdky,1579225927.0,Even when the relationship was bad ending it still hurts on some level. I had to leave my abuser if I wanted to live but part of me still misses the good times we had.
cats,felmlrx,t3_eptdou,1579225792.0,It's fine if she licks the site. It's also perfectly normal. Imagine waking up and finding a bald spot when you didn't have one before. She'll get over it in time.
TooAfraidToAsk,felmerh,t3_epte64,1579225658.0,"Yes. Sleep deprivation can do serious damage to your brain. If you weren't sleep deprived you most likely wouldn't be forgetful. When I'm tired enough you'd think I'm drunk. Again, perfectly normal and figure out why you aren't sleeping like you should."
StarWars,felm696,t3_epten6,1579225493.0,I want this in a knitting pattern.
datingoverthirty,feks111,t3_epojr6,1579206407.0,I would have cancelled too. Everyone else has already said it and I agree. If he's lying about his age he's lying about other things too.

KidsAreFuckingStupid,feiq3it,t3_epd73z,1579144402.0,This enrages me to no end. Dogs and kids aren't taught to respect each other and a kid gets bitten. The child has paid in blood and the dog has most likely paid with it's life. Why? Because one parent had to be lazy and/or stupid? This didn't need to happen.
RATS,feiptlr,t3_epd7yl,1579144216.0,Rats don't have a gag reflex. I'm don't think there's anything you could have done to help him.
RATS,feilg86,t3_epbdz4,1579141285.0,I love the bald rat. My first reaction to the hairless ones is always to stuff them in my shirt and knit them sweaters.
RATS,feil9hg,t3_ep9915,1579141159.0,I remember your post about losing Dabbles. How's Dibbles doing on his own?
RATS,feil2rr,t3_ep8766,1579141030.0,If this was a YouTube channel I'd watch it. It's adorable. Does the cat like the rat or does the cat think the rat is a snack?
