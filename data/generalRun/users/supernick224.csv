This is also fucked to tell people because it will induce self hate for egotistical actions, which fucked me over and gave me a really bad trip on psychedelics. Your ego is permanent and infinite, you must gradually teach your ego how to behave truly in situations where your ego behaves poorly.  That is how you make do with your ego. Keep your ego, love it, and make it your best friend. 

Ego death is not ego death, it’s ego dissolution"

I used to get really introspective when I was high but its without the awareness effect that acid gives."

LSD,fd6tse0,t1_fd3hfhb,1578195613.0,"yeah I mean realistically its about being able to withstand the effects at the end of the day, it might cause some people to have bad trips because it makes the acid even stronger IMO and plus when u get high its hard to think straight so it can be very distorting for some people"

GetMotivated,fco5s6k,t1_fcmrins,1577824618.0,"Okay. You get a job at Goldman Sachs, bottom of the line internship. They work you like hell, treat you like an intern, and mainly give respect to the higher ups. Does that mean you should pussy out and find a different job where the people are nice to you? This post is telling people to surround themselves with comfort. Which is misleading to inexperienced people that haven’t even started to get out of their lazy shell.

I think it’s fair to say you should only worry about comfort once you’ve made it far into whatever, then you can decide “Yeah this isn’t right for me”."
GetMotivated,fcn6yax,t1_fcmkyd3,1577804880.0,"Look into thought suppression or a book called radical acceptance by Tara Brach. 
It seems you ""suppress"" certain thoughts, concluded by you wanting to get rid of the ""I'm not good enough thoughts""."
GetMotivated,fcmjfqv,t1_fcmiowg,1577777737.0,"And maybe perhaps, because you were still suicidal, you didn't make enough effort into seeing why you were suicidal. I'm making an assumption here, but perhaps you tried very hard to suppress the suicidal thoughts. Now thoughts are not actions. Im not saying allow yourself to feel suicidal and then go do it, perhaps trying to let go of the suicidal feelings will work."

You're wounds weren't fully healed if you were still suicidal. 
We're you suicidal every moment of the day for 7 years, or would it pop up in your head and FEEL like you've been suicidal the entire time? The mind plays so many tricks on you. It's your best friend but can also be your worst enemy. I still believe that anyone can tame the beast inside them(but of course, not everyone will do so, they spend their lives running away). Consciousness is your platform, will-power is your tool."

GetMotivated,fcmhvwm,t1_fcmcff6,1577775903.0,"Consider the possibility that taking anti-depressants wasn't the best route for you. Sure, live life with a crutch that will never heal your wound, or try walking without the crutch for at least a year, and watch that wound heal. Ur choice."
GetMotivated,fcmhlyy,t1_fcmdezz,1577775590.0,"Okay. You're bringing up physical pain and not once did I mention that physical pain is something you should suck up and not take meds for. Its completely different than mental pain. 

Clinical/Chronic depression is not the same thing. I want you to name one clinically depressed person that can say ""I am strong enough to get through this on my own"". You can't because they are likely no longer depressed, they've wired their own willpower. Their mind no longer controls them. You tell yourself you can't focus and you can't go out, and you believe it! Instead of entering the unknown and trying to focus, or trying to go out with friends, you lie to yourself because you are overattatched to your emotions. You entitle yourself to behave a certain way because of something bad that happened to you 5 years ago! 

Yes. Diving into the unknown will be a true bitch at first. You have so much time in your life. Why spend it focusing on what you already know and what you can do with what you already know. Why not try learning something new, or doing something outside of your comfort zone? It takes time. The mind makes time seem way scarier than it actually is. Understanding that and becoming aware of it, which also takes TIME, is the balanced cure to depression.

What happens when you stop taking anti-depressants? You get depressed again. Why? Because you're suppressing all of the pain that your brain will never get to naturally process and grow from. Anti-depressants are harmful in the long term. Your brain needs pain to adapt and build mental strength.
It doesn't take a special someone to get out of their mental lock and overcome this. People have done it, and it turns out those people are REALLY successful in life. They get depressed every now and then sure, but they've learned how to handle and manage it SOBER without drugs and can do it extremely efficiently once they've done it enough. Can you tell me whats better for you, learning how to handle and endure stress without drugs, or suppressing the stress without having to handle it WITH drugs.

Let me know."

GetMotivated,fclivk6,t1_fcla4u1,1577748828.0,You need a hefty dose of awareness my guy. Not Prozac. Not the gym. Force yourself to dig into why you think this way. Every. Statement. You. Just. Made. Add “Why?” to it. Keep fucking digging. Learn to enjoy the suffering or it will only get worse.
GetMotivated,fclip4u,t1_fcla4u1,1577748708.0,"Dude. Just fucking take acid and ull know what I’m saying. U don’t need to take acid, acids just like a shortcut I guess. I’m telling you, it’s all of these built up reasons in your head on why depression sucks, AGAIN, mentally locked up. Have you ever stepped out of your box and thought, hey, maybe I’m wrong about depression. Maybe I’ve believed in my own ways of thinking too much. Because YOU know the best way of handling depression, that’s why you still suffer from it? Come on man, open ur mind a lil bit. Just entertain the thought that depression actually helps you grow and is a learning experience."
GetMotivated,fcl8o6a,t1_fcl7glq,1577742207.0,"It’s you perceiving that I think you shouldn’t be allowed to feel pain, infact I believe quite the opposite. Everyone should allow pain, accept it as a part of their life. I agree completely with your view on physical disability. No sense in NOT helping those people. However, debilitating depression stems from habitual “running away”. Depression is debilitating for everyone at first. You didn’t get up out of bed and tell the world how motivated you were the first time you experienced depression, likely as a kid. My point is that everyone goes through depression at some point in their life. Anyone, ANYONE, you don’t have to be smart, strong, can withstand depression. It’s your mind playing tricks on you(because time is only consciously perceived) that YOU NEED to feel better. So you put yourself in a rut going around looking for help, only to see that it keeps coming back because you look for external support rather than looking within yourself and getting introspective because you’re AFRAID. Not saying it’s bad to be afraid! Chill out and don’t get offended. It just takes TIME, REALIZATION, COMMITMENT, DEPTH INTO THE UNKNOWN.

The answer is right next to you. You are staring at it. It’s the door of your bedroom. Get out of it, stop letting your mind control you. If you realisticly couldn’t get up out of your bed then you are basically physically disabled. Which you aren’t if you have depression, you are simply mentally locked up. It is 100% a choice and 100% how you perceive."

GetMotivated,fckxoia,t1_fcjr990,1577735415.0,"Not saying it shouldn’t be recognized. Pain is how you’ve internally defined pain, no one else knows your definition of pain and how you react to it, and neither do you know how I react to pain. I am simply saying that pain is something that can be managed. So your on this reddit to get motivated and do better in life, but you reject the whole message this is about. Growth is all from facing pain and treating it like it doesn’t control you. It can be small pain, big pain, you name it. 

6 months of mental trauma here. The only thing that got me to feel better was by simplifying the experience and learning how to manage the pain. No I didn’t run to anti-depressants or drug out like a lot of people do, I faced the pain up front and said fuck you, you don’t control me."

LSD,fc7lo4x,t1_fc7kemc,1577511483.0,"What was complicated for me on my end was that I lost a sense of truth on my first bad trip. My friends got me off of my trip with Xanax and I didn't really get to process what was going on. When I was sober, I still had a lack of understanding for my sober self. I lost a grip of reality. I didn't do anything to figure out what was going on. I thought that taking more psychedelics would fix me. It just made a deeper scar. Now I've been through months of therapy and personal writing, and I definitely do see the scar as a learning experience now. It's allowed me to learn mindfulness and acceptance which is a huge plus."

Honestly,  I have a hard time finding clear topics about psychedelic crisis (I call it crisis although I don't view it much of a crisis now as I did before) to help me understand whats going on. It's been my own practical thinking thats been getting me through this day by day. There has to be some community out there for psychedelic crisis, right?"
