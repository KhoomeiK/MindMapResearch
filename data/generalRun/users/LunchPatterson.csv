news,ffoctnk,t1_ffnwiw1,1580076361.0,"I did say ""gun nut"", and not, responsible, rational, normal person owning gun. They are two very different things. It's like me saying meat head weight lifter. That refers to the roided out idiots that act like gorillas. Not the normal people that lift weights and stay fit. Heck even the roided out guys that still act normal and are educated aren't meat heads. It's the same thing."

news,ffn1m1k,t1_ffmlenv,1580061055.0,"The odd thing is most of the gun nuts are also thin blue line boot lickers, that say the police can do no wrong. Yet, don't trust that the police will keep anyone safe. This stuff is basically a religion full of contradictions."

Aquariums,ff7tt1t,t3_es4xo4,1579658194.0,This tank might be a master class on what not to do to a tank. I've learned a ton. Any other things I should watch out for. I'ts been going 10 days now.
AnthemTheGame,ff7sk0t,t1_ff6ocfn,1579657326.0,Pull your Colossus shield out and ram stuff! Best part of the game!
AnthemTheGame,ff2kwir,t1_ff1u90f,1579510901.0,It's loads of fun when it works. It just shoots all over the place. It feels really unreliable.
AnthemTheGame,ff1tzy1,t3_eqx96s,1579486151.0,I've tried to like venom storm so much! I have fun with it. I just feel so weak even using the legendary one I got. Even my MW voltaic some just feels so much more reliable.
AnthemTheGame,fdqzg9m,t1_fdpuoxj,1578677362.0,"How am I supposed to do GM3 with only masterworks. So far every time I've done a stronghold I've soloed 3/4 of it, until one other person maybe shows up. I'll check out the crystal thing. That must be a new mechanic. That still doesn't change the face I've played 105 hours and not a single legendary has dropped, lol. Also, the game never told me I was getting crystals that I could turn I to legendaries. How would I just ""know"" that?"
AnthemTheGame,fdpwygi,t1_fdpujq5,1578643988.0,"I mean there aren't a lot of options on how to play, lol Freeplay, or doing the same strongholds over and over on GM1 and 2. Not sure how I misunderstand how to play. I'd do GM3, but again not a single legendary has dropped. That's great the rng system has worked for you. It hasn't worked for everyone. I'd love to know what I need to do differently. What am I missing, seriously."
AnthemTheGame,fdpmctx,t1_fdpfrqt,1578632704.0,"How is my actual playtime a lie? I love what the game could be. I really wish it worked. I had a blast the first 50 hours, then I just kept playing figuring eventually I would get some luck. It never happened. I feel thatf having 2 javlins kitted out in 2 hours might just be the lie here. I've played 5 hours on the new stuff, still not a single legendary."
AnthemTheGame,fdp6ro5,t1_fdp6mu9,1578621317.0,I tried as hard as I could to enjoy this game. The idea is the perfect game for me. It just doesn't work. Maybe someone else will copy it and do it right.
AnthemTheGame,fdp6k01,t1_fdp59if,1578621178.0,I came back for a bit. It is still the same. 105 hours and still not a single legendary.
personalfinance,fdnualk,t1_fdn6orj,1578592972.0,"How do you avoid finacing a vehicle, if you don't have money to outright buy one?  It costs more money to be poor. If I'm 10 seconds late on a payment I get fees, possibly a credit hit. What about my risk of having a leased vehicle, and then getting laid off? I can't just say no thanks to the lease anymore. I can't even have a bank account anymore because I got sick, and didn't want to die. I can't even fight it since I don't have money for legal representation. I can't continue school because my car got stollen, and I had to drop out, Leaving me with a big debt, since grants no longer covered tuition. Now my transcripts are hostage. 

Why do companies have more rights than people? Why is someone able to get rich off ruining people's lives, and to do it completely legally? On the other hand I work hard to change this silly number. Even though I'm no different than when the number was bad. I just looked up the tricks to play on the system to make the number go up. I make that number way better, yet no one has to follow the rules that I have a better number. So why don't they now have to give me a better rate now? Why can they trap me with a borderline unethical interest rate, yet when I fix things they don't have to change with it? You said intrest rates are driven by risk. I made my silly number say I'm less of a risk, why doesn't it go down then? Sorry for the rant this system is just built in favor of those who has more money. It is quite literally impossible to fight a whole system and get out of that hole. If I had the interest one of these companies makes in an hour I could finish school and get ahead, and put more money into the system, but instead they think trapping me is going to get something. You can't get blood from a stone. I'd love to pay all of this, but they've made it impossible."
AnthemTheGame,fdmocbr,t1_fdkc4bl,1578557884.0,"Played the game originally for 100 hours, never got a single lego. Everyone said drops were better. Came back and played for 4 more hours, still not a single lego."
personalfinance,fdmo1mo,t1_fdldq12,1578557508.0,"I see. I might be screwed then it has a KBB value of 9.3-10.4, and I still owe 13k on it. Why is it legal that I'm paying 20% more for a car and trapped, just because I wasn't born rich. You don't have money, or family, so lets charge you more money for things. Oh, good sir you have money? Please let us give you more money just for having it."

ConanExiles,fcohyfa,t3_eh4073,1577832663.0,"This has upgraded to not using any weapon at all today. This is silly. How is there $50 worth of DLC in this game, and base things don't work?"
gifs,fchx58a,t1_fcf95nf,1577655167.0,"Any high schooler could handle most any job with a few weeks of training, probably including yours and mine. The same amount of time it takes to be good at doing food service. There are a few things like programming, and such that require a lot of knowledge, but the same thing applies. Give me a programming book, and I'll eventually get something made that sort of works. Same thing with a food service person. Put someone in there that has never cooked, and they will eventually give you something that resembles food.   


The disconnect here is that most people learn to cook on their own in at least some manner. Tell those people they have to cook for 1000 people in 2 hours, and it isn't going to go well. It is still a skill."
