RationalPsychonaut,fff0rl1,t1_ffeswge,1579872496.0,"Tolerance I find, is basically reset to 0 if you wait 2 weeks. Each trip is different, but I do now know what to expect.

Yeah! I actually usually trip on a free day or a weekend, when I know I won't have anything to do. The first 6 hours of an acid trip are the most disorienting part for me, and then the next 6 hours I feel like. While I'm obviously still high, and would never drive a car, I can go around walk to places, and have conversations."
RationalPsychonaut,ffeahs8,t1_ffeaadc,1579841268.0,"Oh yeah!! I bet. Have never tried adderall, but I would, to see how it was. I 100% imagine it'd be good for a big block."
RationalPsychonaut,ffe9wme,t1_ffe98ya,1579840757.0,"Yeah!! Please do be careful though!! I have had a few mis-steps with doses that were a little too high before, out of curiosity, not with LSD but with mushrooms. So I totally agree! They are the closest thing to magic but handle with care! And good luck with your own writing!!! :) Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas by Hunter S. Thompson actually was what pushed me to finally try LSD hahaha, but I definitely don't do the crazy shit they do, but damn am I ever glad I read that book."
RationalPsychonaut,ffdxpof,t1_ffdx809,1579831526.0,"Around 380ug is my average dose. Going slightly lower or higher depending on what I feel like.

I don't write while on it, too abstract, and it doesn't come out very well. I'd also just rather not look at a white computer screen page since I usually write on keyboard.

I would say... my inner dialogue is very full? Hard to describe. A lot of thoughts all at once during some parts of the trip, and a very clear mind other times. I feel at times completely detached from who I am, and it's a freeing experiences that ends when the trip does with a strong ""afterglow"" for the next week or two."

RationalPsychonaut,ffdx4px,t1_ffduplb,1579831111.0,Yeah! I do think the ego has it's place! I guess... taming it is a better way of saying it? I'm sure we wouldn't be able to function without it.

RationalPsychonaut,fe654n7,t3_enwlr3,1578881994.0,"Agreed on the therapist/psychologist thing!!

Maybe you could look into philosophy? Reading things from descartes like his Meditations are actually really helpful where it comes to understanding psychedelic experience. There are many other philosophers too.

I think you're only half right about the playing with fire part.

If dosed correctly in proper setting, and with no predisposition, psychedelics can be done safely every time."

NonBinary,fdjanz1,t1_fdisgf2,1578463439.0,HELL YES.
RationalPsychonaut,fdg28oz,t3_el0szt,1578377326.0,"One of his latest videos is about him taking LSD, Nitrous, and DMT. And details having a terrible experience but also a really interesting one.

It's REALLY irresponsible. I think it really normalizes the mixing of drugs which is... unpredictable at best. 

Idk. Every time I watch his videos I find he is more pathetic each time. He had a recent video where his longterm partner basically detailed how absent and bad he was on video the whole time while he cut her off occasionally, and then just explained it all off in another video.

Seems to me like a general leech on the psychedelic community posing as harm reduction, when really he normalizes harmful behaviour through high dose multiple drug mixes, all while as many have pointed out talking all sorts of shit about weird pseudo-spiritual-scientific nonsense that sounds more like a guy having a strange breakdown on screen more than having any true message.

Idk.

Sorry. Just get annoyed cos he's popular and he really is a first look into psychedelics for many, and yet his only friendly tip is to test your drugs, while spewing a lot of other harmful nonsense."

writing,fc6ychb,t3_egcf6a,1577492665.0,"Be more specific.

Well, what is a moment? What is a character *doing* instead of a moment, substitute with, ""he took a drag of his cigarette."" Cliche but just an example :)

Seems to me like you're trying to stop the scene from being static and action-less?

Be more specific with character action and you become less abstract with *moments, beats, and seconds*

Sorry to hear about your family. Fuck 'em. There are scared people in this world, and if they're unwilling to acknowledge who you really are, they'll live forever lying to themselves, and that's fucking ok, because you can't change them.

Seems you're in a dark place, especially if you're turning to dph...

It seems like you're young, you like King Gizzard and the Lizard Wizard, which is a good band, and I don't know you, but I'm sure you're better than the self-hate you project onto the replies you've been posting here.

Please, stop taking dph. It's really a drug of self-harm, and you might enjoy its ability to let you forget about your problems, but it won't kill you and you'll only have more problems in the end.

Don't die. You're young. Things can still change. I had a friend, age 20, had seizures from a condition he had growing up. One day he just had a seizure, fell bad and died. I'm just saying. You don't want to die, life just sucks, but life can change. And in death there is nothing but static emptiness. At least have a good go at it and enjoy a life that is really not so serious."
