The Japanese were already defeated and ready to surrender.… in being the first to use it, we…adopted an ethical standard common to the barbarians of the Dark Ages. I was not taught to make war in that fashion, and wars cannot be won by destroying women and children.”
> 
> The commanding general of the US Army Air Forces, Henry “Hap” Arnold, gave a strong indication of his views in a public statement only eleven days after Hiroshima was attacked. Asked on August 17 by a New York Times reporter whether the atomic bomb caused Japan to surrender, Arnold said that “the Japanese position was hopeless even before the first atomic bomb fell, because the Japanese had lost control of their own air.”
> 
> Fleet Adm. Chester Nimitz, Commander in Chief of the Pacific Fleet, stated in a public address at the Washington Monument two months after the bombings that “the atomic bomb played no decisive part, from a purely military standpoint, in the defeat of Japan…” Adm. William “Bull” Halsey Jr., Commander of the US Third Fleet, stated publicly in 1946 that “the first atomic bomb was an unnecessary experiment…. It was a mistake to ever drop it…. [the scientists] had this toy and they wanted to try it out, so they dropped it…”
> 
> Gen. Dwight Eisenhower, for his part, stated in his memoirs that when notified by Secretary of War Henry Stimson of the decision to use atomic weapons, he “voiced to him my grave misgivings, first on the basis of my belief that Japan was already defeated and that dropping the bomb was completely unnecessary, and secondly because I thought that our country should avoid shocking world opinion by the use of a weapon whose employment was, I thought, no longer mandatory as a measure to save American lives…” He later publicly declared “…it wasn’t necessary to hit them with that awful thing.” Even the famous “hawk” Maj. Gen. Curtis LeMay, head of the Twenty-First Bomber Command, went public the month after the bombing, telling the press that “the atomic bomb had nothing to do with the end of the war at all.”

Of course they could have all just been trying to revise their own history and distance themselves from the act, but my speculation is that the bomb was more about sending a message to the Russians than anything to do with Japan."

Is it in the same family? Yes. No one's arguing that.

As someone who is a scientist who studies cobras, I am telling you, specifically, in science, no one calls king cobras cobras. If you want to be ""specific"" like you said, then you shouldn't either. They're not the same thing.

If you're saying ""cobra family"" you're referring to the taxonomic grouping of Elapidae, which includes things from burrowing snakes to whip snakes to mambas.

So your reasoning for calling a King Cobra a cobra is because random people ""call the bitey ones cobras?"" Let's get kraits and asps in there, then, too.

Also, calling someone a human or an ape? It's not one or the other, that's not how taxonomy works. They're both. A King Cobra is a snake and a member of the cobra family. But that's not what you said. You said a king cobra is a cobra, which is not true unless you're okay with calling all members of the cobra family cobras, which means you'd call bolas, taipans, and other snakes cobras, too. Which you said you don't.
