CapitalismVSocialism,fdge0on,t1_fdgcitk,1578392322.0,"You must be from another country, I've never heard an electrical box called a cabinet. I was referring to cupboards, the cabinets in a kitchen or bathroom. They're usually custom, and often require shimming to make the tops level. The job is not standard enough for a robot to do. Same as a mechanic for internal combustion cars. Electric cars, maybe, but combustion engines are complex enough it takes a decent amount of creativity to solve most problems. Also, when installing wood or imitation wood flooring, the one of the most important things is to *not* make a pattern. Wood floors look best when the pieces are randomized, so I doubt a robot could ever do that effectively. I actually thin tile could be easier a robot to do. Just have a CNC type machine in the room, with a suction cup on a telescoping arm, and write in the tile size and patterns, along as you precut the pieces for it, and stack them in the right order, but that would require doing so much math and measuring, it wouldn't be worth it. You'd also have to figure out how to make the robot spread the mortar, but not too much, because it would dry out before the tile got to it. 

Maybe if we create a true, general ai, and have humanoid robots, with at least as much strength and mobility as us, we could have them repair stuff, but that's just asking for a robot uprising."
