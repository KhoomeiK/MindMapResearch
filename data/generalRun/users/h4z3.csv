Concrete,ffb6ptm,t1_ffb2f0y,1579753270.0,"It's usually the one with the highest safety factor. Also, I'm pretty sure Eurocode doesn't take into account for bar diameter for its environmental requirement, only for bonding. Instead of trying to be a smartass maybe you should point to the information you use to decide the detailing for concrete cover."
Concrete,ffb1a32,t1_ffb04s0,1579749305.0,"Diameter doesn't influence cover on reinforced concrete in contact with the ground, it's fixed and depends on local conditions, it may however be taken into account for other reinforced concrete elements.

You can check ""Table 20.6.1.3.1—Specified concrete cover for cast-in-place non prestressed concrete members"" from the ACI:318 for more info."

I know of people that gets paid rent of the house they live in (and own) under the pretense that they use it as shared office space, from the company they own (and supposedly work at), dunno how tf does it work, but the accountant says it does."

Concrete,ffaz2ug,t1_ffaxqlr,1579747817.0,"That's actually the best and worst anwer, lmao. Best because that's the safest place for the steel inside the concrete, and worst because it's not working properly as it should. Steel reinforcement have 2 functions on reinforced concrete, it gives tensile strength where is needed and keeps it from cracking, and right in the center is not doing neither of those at its maximum efficiency.

For concrete in contact with the earth the recommended cover is 50-70 mm depending on the presence of sulfates and other nasty stuff. If it's slab on grade 50 mm should suffice."
