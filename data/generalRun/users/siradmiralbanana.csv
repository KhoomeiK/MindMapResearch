Anticonsumption,ff9k9jk,t1_ff9cajq,1579714784.0,"That's true. You can keep aluminum in the cycle for forever. The problem is many industrial processes are now switching to aluminum for economic models (like auto manufacturers), so the demand for aluminum is on the rise. We will thus need to accommodate by manufacturing more aluminum. In an ideal world, we would already have enough and can recycle it, but this is not the case. Switching all drinking beverages to be in aluminum cans will greatly increase aluminum demand, and it's not clear what this would mean for the environment."
Anticonsumption,ff9jzu8,t1_ff9dlx5,1579714627.0,I'm not suggesting that. I'm suggesting aluminum and glass aren't the solution to all our waste problems.

insanepeoplefacebook,fctm3kj,t1_fctkuj5,1577948454.0,"Pythagoras, a very famous mathematician, hypothesized all numbers were rational. A rational number can be written as a fraction (in proper terms, a ratio of two integers), such as 1/3 and 0.5. Numbers like the square root of 2 and Pi are not rational, so you can't write them as fractions. While this may not be groundbreaking to you, this was a rather difficult thing for ancient mathematicians to conceptualize given how most of their proofs were geometric (algebra-based proofs for irrational numbers are very simple to follow, and it doesn't make them stupid for not figuring them out, they just did not have those tools). Urban legends in math have cropped up about the first people to prove existence of irrational numbers, such as the one the head of the thread posted. Whether or not they are true, I can't say (they don't tend to be true), but they're indicative of the earth-shattering discovery of irrational numbers and how similar proofs completely changed how we do math for the rest of history."
