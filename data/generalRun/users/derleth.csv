> So what you're saying is california doesnt have that close in age gap and an 18 year old dude can end up in prison if he has sex with 17 year old?

Not prison, but it is a crime, given this quote from the article I linked to:

> In some jurisdictions (such as California and Michigan), if two minors have sex with each other, they are both guilty of engaging in unlawful sex with the other person.[15][16][17]

... which cites to [this part of the California code](https://codes.findlaw.com/ca/penal-code/pen-sect-261-5.html):

> (a) Unlawful sexual intercourse is an act of sexual intercourse accomplished with a person who is not the spouse of the perpetrator, if the person is a minor.  For the purposes of this section, a “minor” is a person under the age of 18 years and an “adult” is a person who is at least 18 years of age.

> (b) Any person who engages in an act of unlawful sexual intercourse with a minor who is not more than three years older or three years younger than the perpetrator, is guilty of a misdemeanor.

> (c) Any person who engages in an act of unlawful sexual intercourse with a minor who is more than three years younger than the perpetrator is guilty of either a misdemeanor or a felony, and shall be punished by imprisonment in a county jail not exceeding one year, or by imprisonment pursuant to subdivision (h) of Section 1170 .

> (d) Any person 21 years of age or older who engages in an act of unlawful sexual intercourse with a minor who is under 16 years of age is guilty of either a misdemeanor or a felony, and shall be punished by imprisonment in a county jail not exceeding one year, or by imprisonment pursuant to subdivision (h) of Section 1170 for two, three, or four years.

So in California, an 18-year-old who had sex with a 16-year-old would be guilty of a misdemeanor. Weirdly, a 17-year-old who had sex with a 16-year-old would be guilty of the *same* misdemeanor, and so would the 16-year-old, because they both fucked someone below California's AoC."

1. It's 18 in California. Most TV shows are made in California, and most writers know California law, and assume it's the same everywhere in the country.
2. A lot of people are confused about age of consent and close-in-age exceptions. If the AoC is 16 in a state, a 16-year-old can have sex with a 30-year-old legally. If the AoC is 18 but there's a close-in-age exception, a 16-year-old can likely have sex with an 18-year-old without the 18-year-old going to prison.

> “The question was not, ‘Should you eat human flesh?’ but, ‘What sort of flesh should you eat?’ ” says Sugg. The answer, at first, was Egyptian mummy, which was crumbled into tinctures to stanch internal bleeding. But other parts of the body soon followed. Skull was one common ingredient, taken in powdered form to cure head ailments. Thomas Willis, a 17th-century pioneer of brain science, brewed a drink for apoplexy, or bleeding, that mingled powdered human skull and chocolate. And King Charles II of England sipped “The King’s Drops,” his personal tincture, containing human skull in alcohol. Even the toupee of moss that grew over a buried skull, called Usnea, became a prized additive, its powder believed to cure nosebleeds and possibly epilepsy. Human fat was used to treat the outside of the body. German doctors, for instance, prescribed bandages soaked in it for wounds, and rubbing fat into the skin was considered a remedy for gout.

> Blood was procured as fresh as possible, while it was still thought to contain the vitality of the body. This requirement made it challenging to acquire. The 16th century German-Swiss physician Paracelsus believed blood was good for drinking, and one of his followers even suggested taking blood from a living body. While that doesn’t seem to have been common practice, the poor, who couldn’t always afford the processed compounds sold in apothecaries, could gain the benefits of cannibal medicine by standing by at executions, paying a small amount for a cup of the still-warm blood of the condemned. “The executioner was considered a big healer in Germanic countries,” says Sugg. “He was a social leper with almost magical powers.” For those who preferred their blood cooked, a 1679 recipe from a Franciscan apothecary describes how to make it into marmalade.

No less a person than Voltaire made the famous quote that the Holy Roman Empire is neither Holy, nor Roman, nor an Empire: By Voltaire's time, it was religiously split (Protestant north, Catholic south, like modern Germany), it had never been ""Roman"" in that it was not a legitimate heir to the Western Roman Empire, in addition to being decidedly German, and it was a confederation of little fiefdoms as opposed to a centralized imperial state.

Also Voltaire was kind of the Dawkins of his own time, always looking to get a knife into the ossified religious authority of his era, and few institutions outside of the Papacy itself were as absurd and ossified as the HRE. He also spread the myth that Galileo was imprisoned for his scientific work challenging geocentrism, which is still a good way to get in a few barbs at the Pope.

How the worm turns. These days, I think the current consensus is to emphasize the continuity between the Western and Eastern Roman Empires and say that Charlemagne was the one off doing his own thing in the Carolinian Renaissance. It also seems that de-emphasizing the ""European Dark Ages"" narrative is part of the modern consensus, and that's easier if you say that the Roman Empire shifted focus in the late Fifth Century instead of ceasing to exist in a shower of blood and guts.

(Personally, I think the current pendulum is over a bit too far with the whole ""There Were No Dark Ages"" bit. Western Europe *did* suffer a shock circa 500 CE, and the fact it didn't End Civilization Forever doesn't mean it wasn't a shock. But that's just my own chuntering.)"

> â€œThe question was not, â€˜Should you eat human flesh?â€™ but, â€˜What sort of flesh should you eat?â€™ â€ says Sugg. The answer, at first, was Egyptian mummy, which was crumbled into tinctures to stanch internal bleeding. But other parts of the body soon followed. Skull was one common ingredient, taken in powdered form to cure head ailments. Thomas Willis, a 17th-century pioneer of brain science, brewed a drink for apoplexy, or bleeding, that mingled powdered human skull and chocolate. And King Charles II of England sipped â€œThe Kingâ€™s Drops,â€ his personal tincture, containing human skull in alcohol. Even the toupee of moss that grew over a buried skull, called Usnea, became a prized additive, its powder believed to cure nosebleeds and possibly epilepsy. Human fat was used to treat the outside of the body. German doctors, for instance, prescribed bandages soaked in it for wounds, and rubbing fat into the skin was considered a remedy for gout.

> Blood was procured as fresh as possible, while it was still thought to contain the vitality of the body. This requirement made it challenging to acquire. The 16th century German-Swiss physician Paracelsus believed blood was good for drinking, and one of his followers even suggested taking blood from a living body. While that doesnâ€™t seem to have been common practice, the poor, who couldnâ€™t always afford the processed compounds sold in apothecaries, could gain the benefits of cannibal medicine by standing by at executions, paying a small amount for a cup of the still-warm blood of the condemned. â€œThe executioner was considered a big healer in Germanic countries,â€ says Sugg. â€œHe was a social leper with almost magical powers.â€ For those who preferred their blood cooked, a 1679 recipe from a Franciscan apothecary describes how to make it into marmalade.

No less a person than Voltaire made the famous quote that the Holy Roman Empire is neither Holy, nor Roman, nor an Empire: By Voltaire's time, it was religiously split (Protestant north, Catholic south, like modern Germany), it had never been ""Roman"" in that it was not a legitimate heir to the Western Roman Empire, in addition to being decidedly German, and it was a confederation of little fiefdoms as opposed to a centralized imperial state.

(Personally, I think the current pendulum is over a bit too far with the whole ""There Were No Dark Ages"" bit. Western Europe *did* suffer a shock circa 500 CE, and the fact it didn't End Civilization Forever doesn't mean it wasn't a shock. But that's just my own chuntering.)"

[Interesting story](https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2006/08/security_is_a_t.html):

> Back in the 1980s, Yosemite National Park was having a serious problem with bears: They would wander into campgrounds and break into the garbage bins. This put both bears and people at risk. So the Park Service started installing armored garbage cans that were tricky to open -- you had to swing a latch, align two bits of handle, that sort of thing. But it turns out it's actually quite tricky to get the design of these cans just right. Make it too complex and people can't get them open to put away their garbage in the first place. Said one park ranger, ""There is considerable overlap between the intelligence of the smartest bears and the dumbest tourists."""
religiousfruitcake,fe8ke1j,t1_fe3vtwl,1578927139.0,"For example, imagine three people all married to each other, Alice, Bob, and Charlie. Alice and Bob come to hate each other, so Alice divorces Bob... who is still married to Charlie. Charlie has a horrible accident. Alice wants desperately to prevent Bob from seeing Charlie, and, as Charlie's wife, she has certain rights in these matters... but as Charlie's husband, Bob has rights, too, so who wins?

Changing things like that would change what marriage *is*, taking it from a union of two co-equal adults to being a union of multiple co-equal adults, and going from two to as many as you please is a hard problem.

(Side note: What *also* changed the definition of marriage was the demise of [coverture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coverture), a legal doctrine whereby, upon marriage, a woman's legal rights and obligations were subsumed by those of her husband. In a marriage system with coverture, the husband and wife became one legal person, that person being the husband. Same-sex marriage is impossible in that system: A man can't marry a man, because there must be *one* legal person, and a woman can't marry a woman, because there must *be* a legal person. It's surprising the slow end of coverture isn't talked about more, given how much it changed.)"

Foodforthought,fe1c7u4,t1_fe0dw8l,1578824905.0,"The word ""Cult"" has so many definitions it's hard to avoid mixing them up. [Devotion to a saint can be a cult, for example, as can any fandom the speaker regards as obsessive.](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/cult) The current common usage of the word, outside of academia where scholars talk about a specific region's ""cult of Aphrodite"" or similar, is a group which aims to control the thoughts and behaviors of its members using mind control techniques. Scientology, for example, or the People's Temple cult which mostly committed suicide in Jonestown.

So just saying ""Cult"" is either meaningless or a deliberate attempt to confuse."
