i'd like to be able to export everything (and if possible as detailed as possible)

what i really want:

HR 24/7 (can i export that data? in which intervalls?)

sleep tracking (don't care much about REM/deep/whatever phases since it's probably not really accurate anyway, but knowing when i fall asleep and when i wake up is important to me. i would also love to already have HR data and maybe even movement attached to the sleep tracking, does the garmin software deliver that data?)

ski tracking - would be awesome to just ""start"" it, go skiing for a day and stop it, would want to know speed/how long ive been actually skiing and of course gps data and HR data of the whole day

ice skating - speed/time and HR data to it

i'm going to assume that walking/hiking/running is working anyway. i'd also love if i could write my own apps for the watch and access all its sensors if there is anything not working quite right for me - but i think that's possible with all connect IQ watches from garmin?

battery life should obviously be as high as possible, at least 3-4 days of ""normal"" use. it's fine if i have to charge it after going skiing the whole day for example.

design doesn't really matter as long as it's not a huge watch.

i'd also love any additional sensors - oxygen, respiration, whatever, but it's no necessity.

price should be max 300, but it should be more in the 150-200 range if possible. i took a look at the garmin forerunner 45, 235 and vivoactive 3/4 and it seems they all could do everything i need?"

people really go wrong on both ways nowadays. some people write their password in plain text on reddit and wonder why they get ""hacked"", other people are completely paranoid about everything and think nothing is safe whatsoever, which is just as wrong and definitely doesn't help in educating the general population on what to do since people without any knowledge at all already start to tell me it doesn't matter what they do anyway since nothing is safe so why bother with security.

you can check compiled libraries (every single good library i've ever used provides sha which can be checked, and basically all of them are completely open source, so you can check everything), and you can check the code - especially for the relatively small tools used for poe it is not really a problem.

alternatively, if you really can't read the code itself, you can always just check what data the programs sends and receives over the internet. most of those tools shouldn't need to communicate with anything other than what they're supposed to (i.e. tradeapi etc.).

sure, be careful, but don't be paranoid either. simply don't use scripts 1 hour after their initial release (most of the time they're not worth it anyway initially) unless you know what you're doing.

IF you want to teach them anything about working in groups you have to have more feedback than that. the assignment should be ""work out a plan on how you present this, who does what and when"", after that have a discussion about the plan, then execute that plan (which would be mainly alone, which it also is in the real world) and after they should write about what went right/wrong and other stuff from their perspective.

pathofexile,fcnzhul,t1_fcn1793,1577821380.0,"if the most efficient way to gain currency is for example back a few leagues pure spider forest farming with high IIQ for headhunter cards, it won't help you in any way whatsoever in SSF if you already have a headhunter, a second one won't help you ""push ladder"" either. that's the point. chaos/hour is meaningless in ssf, since you can't do the standard trade league methods of gaining currency.

gaining the right items and/or the right currency will always be vastly different depending on your build. in trade leagues there will always be 1 way to gain currency that beats all others since every drop you get can be converted into currency. if there is a imbalance where 1 item (div card, breachstone, boss drop, whatever) is much more worth than it takes to farm, you'll farm it even if you don't need it, since you can sell that and buy what you need and that will be much more efficient than going after the thing you need itself. in SSF you have to think for yourself what you need and how you get it.

if you have a build that could be vastly improved by a delve craft, delving is the best thing for you to do. in trade leagues it's probably still better to do other things with higher chaos/hour than delving, sell what you get and buy delving mats instead of delving yourself. you simply can't do that in ssf.

and i already said, sure, xp/h is obviously important - but chaos/h isn't at all.

i don't know how it is nowadays, but generally if you want to push the ladder in trade leagues you farm as much currency as you can and trade for things like harbinger maps or pure breachstones or whatever the newest best xp/h is - that doesn't work in SSF either. it's a whole new and much more dynamic way of playing the game, it isn't nearly as ""solved"" as trade leagues are. that's my point."

politics,fbv07kc,t1_fbuxkqq,1577123240.0,"and that's exactly what i mean. i *want* politicians to discuss and debate and fight over what they're doing. just because republicans do not give a single shit about anything at all as long as it benefits them and just do every single thing the fuhrer says doesn't mean democrats have to do the same thing.

sure, in this specific case there was a shitton of lobbying going on instead of people actually wanting to improve the ACA even within the democratic party, but still. there is just absolutely no way this whole thing works if there is only 2 opinions on each topic, of course there should be *massive* debate on important things even within the parties. 

as i said - this makes shit hard. but shit *is* hard and *should be* hard."
