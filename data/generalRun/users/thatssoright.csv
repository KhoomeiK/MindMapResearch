So does attitudes like yours. Your experience and results aren't universal. Even in your own telling you don't seem to grasp how fortunate you were when you decided to get help that things worked out for you. Not everyone gets someone who is in a place to help when they seek treatment, let alone someone who happens to be married to a social worker. Maybe you walk into that AA meeting the next day, or an hour earlier/later and that person isn't there and no one is around to help and you slide back into a hole of alcoholism. Maybe you go to a different shelter and you get someone who wants to help, but not someone who is married to a social worker. Now you don't have the added incentive to make those meetings. It's just another task on top of everything that seems insurmountable, and people like you just telling you that you need to try harder. 

I am not taking away from what you did. Good for you for overcoming alcoholism and being homeless. But please don't act like you did it all on your own and that it was only accomplished because of your own perseverance and hard work. You were very fortunate and very lucky in your circumstances when you decided to try and turn it around. Not everyone has that kind of luck when they try.

Even without CTE as a concern, you are seeing the game change in the last couple of years. Kicks are being minimized and I wouldn't be surprised to see all but field goals disappear entirely. That is being done in the name of safety. QB's are being ever more protected. You can complain that it cheapens the game, but it's been a steady march.

Have you actually MET any homeless people? Everything in your diatribe sounds like a Rush Limbaugh/FoxNews talking point about this one guy they found somewhere that once said he loved being homeless and then that gets applied to all homeless people. 

Let me clear this up for you. When someone becomes homeless, 99.9999999% of the time it's not because they think it will be totally awesome to just sleep on the streets and have to beg for food and money. Once a person becomes homeless, it is insanely hard for them to break out of that. Yes, it happens, but not often and not without a lot of help. The sheer stigma that gets placed on someone who is homeless is enough to wreck someone's life. You can't pull yourself up by your bootstraps out of being homeless. It takes lots of outside support that a lot of them just don't have. Offering some mental/drug/job training and counselling is meaningless if they have no way of traveling there on a regular basis and have no fixed place where they can even sleep without fear of the elements or others that might randomly attack or steal from them. 

> We make it too easy to continue to be homeless in Denver.

Uh huh. That's a big disagreement there, but the solution isn't to punish them more than they already are. Just in case you don't understand it, with very few exceptions......no one WANTS to be homeless on the streets. That just isn't a thing.  But hey, if you ever fall on hard times and end up out on the streets, just remember that you chose that shit and it's on you to get out of it.

I am not making excuses. I find it disturbing that you not only don't know and don't care, but you are completely dismissive of the fact that they may not be staying quiet because of their careers. Maybe, just maybe the fact that people like you still blame women in part or in whole for being assaulted, harassed and raped either for it happening or because they just didn't do enough to stop it or whatever is why they don't say a fucking word. Maybe because they know that if it comes out that people....just like you are doing.....will do everything you can to not only assign some blame to them but make them feel like shit for being raped. Maybe they feel that they are to blame and the level of shame keeps them quiet. 

Spend some time with vitcims of sexual assault and maybe you will have a bit more understanding instead of standing on your high horse assigning blame to women whose only crime was to get harassed or raped. I don't know how many times it needs to be said: IT IS NOT THE VICTIMS FAULT WHEN HER ASSAILANT RAPES SOMEONE ELSE. Jennifer Lawrence, or Jane Smith being raped by Harvey Weinstein does not make them culpable when he rapes the next person that comes along.

You live in a fantasy world where people with power get reported and the actions are instantaneous. How long was Joe Paterno and the rest of Penn State aware of Jerry Sandusky raping little boys?

When you have someone that has a sense of shame and loathing that they keep quiet because they feel that they will be blamed not only for what happened to them, but for what may or may not have happened to anyone else. That is a correct assumption when it comes to assholes like you. You are 100% blaming the victims in these circumstances. 

If someone gets the shit beat out of them by a local gang leader who then tells them that if they tell anyone they will kill them, do you blame that person for every bad act that gang leader does from then on out? I am guessing you would. 

Sexual assault survivors are no different. Harvey Weinstein puts young impressionable actresses in a situation where they feel they have no choice but to go along with what he says. Your opinion that they can walk away is irrelevant. He tells them if they want X, they need to do Y. And if they don't, they will never get X and if they tell anyone he will say that they came onto him because he knows that people like you will be more than willing to believe that a young actress was willing to prostitute herself out and not only will no one believe her, but they will blame her. So she goes along with it. Tells herself that it's only this one time. Then he tells her that he will ruin her if she ever says anything to anyone.

Weinstein is objectively 100% the bad guy and the ONLY bad guy in this situation. Yet you are turning around and saying ""well, he is scum but she is a whore who deserved it""."

You keep buying so much stuff on that card to ""prove"" that it's yours in the event you get divorced years later.

He spent the next 3 hours signing anything and everything and being mostly gracious. This was after he spent the day golfing on a hot day. So I can't fault him there. The other time was just bumping into him randomly somewhere and saying hi and he said hi back. 

Even with those, I have heard enough stories from people to know that he is a shitty tipper when he eats at a restaurant, he generally hates being bothered and has no problem being rude to people. 

I did run into Shannon Sharpe at a gym years and years ago. The place he kept in Colorado wasn't far from the gym my brother and I worked at.

My sister got divorced in a state that didn't do community property. When her and her ex got married, a friend of his parents gave them an original painting they had done as a wedding present. I have no idea who this person is, but their paintings are apparently fairly well known and sell anywhere from $5k to $15k. Her ex (and his parents who paid for his lawyer) tried to make the argument that since it was THEIR friend my sister had no rights to that painting and it should be awarded to him. The judge disagreed and told them to either come to an agreement or it needed to be sold. Now, my sister didn't honestly care about or even like the painting in question and wasn't going to fight him taking it.

Compare two methods. Jerry goes with his gut on most everything. Garrett sticks around for 9 years of complete mediocrity before being let go. When it comes time to hire someone new, Jerry again goes with his gut and he hires McCarthy without really interviewing anyone else. 

Elway hires Vance Joseph because of a gut feeling. That shit didn't work out and he fires him after 2 seasons. During the coaching search several candidates were interviewed and the process was a bit more thorough because Elway admitted that his process and decision making in hiring Joseph was flawed. 

Now, that isn't to say that Elway is better than Jones and making those decisions (there are arguments either way, I just used Elway as an example because I was more familiar with that whole process). Just that Jerry isn't the kind of guy to learn from his mistakes, primarily because he probably doesn't think he makes many mistakes. Will McCarthy work out? maybe. I think he will make the Cowboys way more consistent for the division than Garrett did. A lot will depend on Rivera and what he is able to do in Washington, but I think it's a step up."
