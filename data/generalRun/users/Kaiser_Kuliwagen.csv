atheism,fft5fxk,t1_ffs35vl,1580208093.0,"Funny you should cite Genesis. Seeing as Genesis 3:5 is ""For God knows that when you eat from it your eyes will be opened, and you will be like God, *knowing good and evil* ""

Before they ate the fruit, they did not know good and evil. Eve cannot have known what the implications were. 

And what about the next verse? I mean let's take things into full context.

""And the woman saw that the fruit of the tree was good as food and pleasing to the eye."" Genesis 3:6

Question. God created everything, yeah? 

So why did your God create the fruit to look like that? If I was an all powerful deity, I'd make it spikey. Or made from glass soaked in acid. Sounds like he made it delicious because God *wanted* them to eat it.

God set it up. And seeing as he is all knowing, he knew it would play out as it did.

On to slavery. And seeing as you like to cite your holy book, what does Leviticus 25:44 say?

""Buy your slaves from the heathens who surround you."" Sounds like a pretty good endorsement of slavery to me. God is literally saying you can go buy slaves.

Theres even whole sets of rules of slave ownership in the bible. Want me to cite them?

Theres not even a passage *hinting* that slavery is a little wrong. Even Jesus says ""Slaves, obey your masters. Even the wicked ones."" Ephesians 6:5

Where in the bible does it say ""Dont own other humans as property""?

Oh, that's right. **Nowhere.**

atheism,ffqdp8j,t1_ffqb6em,1580131456.0,"Let's go through this step by step.

>How does a male and female evolve at the same rate...

Because individuals dont evolve. You get variation within a goegraphic community. 

>and procreate through every generational iteration without dying off?

What? Organisms form, reproduce, and die off all the time. Subsequent generations may have slight variations and over time these small changes accumulate. The organisms that are better suited to their environment thrive and reproduce more and again over time, the advantageous trait becomes the norm.

So now you understand how evolution works basically. 

>Then multiply that by all living organisms.

Ok. And you get a probability of One. Because we know it happened. You and every other life form on this planet is proof of that.

>The mathematical probability blah blah? Thank you for conceding the probability is out of this world, but it is not blah blah. We’re talking about the chances you are right versus the chances Creationism is right.

Ooh. Is this the argument from big numbers? 

The odds of a particular protein synthesizing is high, but not improbably high. Especially when you realise that they form from less complex amnio acid chains. And unless you know a thing or two about polymerisation of base pairs, it's a wasted conversation.

Go look at talkorigins.com. They do a better job explaining this. Because they are people that have studied this all their lives.

> It takes far less probability that a Creator exists.

And just how did you work that out? Seeing as there is zero evidence for a creator. How did you quantify God?

I could just as soon claim that pixies were helped by the leprechaun that lives behind the moon and farted the world into being and *it's just as probable as your claim.*

God and magic has the same explanatory power. **None.**

But Science can look back and see how life formed. By looking at actual tangible proof we can find out facts. Evolution is a fact. There is not a single shread of evidence for any magic sky people.

It's an oblate spheroid. Not ovoid. It's a small difference but I've been arguing with flat-earthers. 

And the zygote in this case *is* a human zygote, the simple fact is **It doesnt change the argument.**

Just ask them the hypothetical if it's ok to attach yourself to their body without their consent in order to maintain your life.

The argument for abortion is simply about that. Bodily autonomy and consent.

Women have to consent to be pregnant. 

You can bring rape into it, because if a woman is raped, then she has not given consent. But that gives the pro lifers an out by saying abortion is ok **only** in rape cases.

So even if a woman consents to sex, that's not consenting to becoming pregnant. Abortion is what it is. I agree with you. If it's not right for you, then dont get one. Everyone deserves to have the choice.

If these pro life morons want to argue that the hallowed human fetus has the right to use another persons body, then ask them why, as a human yourself, why you dont have the right to hook yourself up to someone to use their liver? Should you be allowed to demand someones kidney? After all, you were unborn once too. Are they stripping that right away from you just because you were born?

Not even a legal court can force a person to give up body parts to save  even their own children. But these people want it that way.

So, why do they want to give a zygote **extra** rights over another person? They want to control women. (You can argue that is a slippery slope to slavery, but that tends to spin the argument off on tangents.)

I agree with you that these fuckers definitely are scared of a woman being independent. Sexually or otherwise. That's why they want control.

atheism,fexukqb,t1_fev9hk8,1579436449.0,"Hey Friend. Thanks for the reply. Definitely some food for thought in here. It's good to hear someone explain why they believe. And I think you didnt ramble. These concepts are hard to define for ourselves. Let alone communicate them easily.

I've got a few things I agree with, someone dont, and some questions.

As for belief in god, I'd argue that it is actually binary. You are either a believer, or you are not. Regardless of if you have a rational reason or proof of god, the binary still stands. 

There are many things in life that are a spectrum of greys instead of a black and white, but something either exists, or does not. You either have belief in something, or you lack that belief.

I have one question about your God belief. If something transcends understanding of existance, then how do you understand it to exist? 

I know that I dont have to have to have absolute knowledge of a car to be able to drive, but I can investigate a car. I can pop the hood and at least look at the engine to know that it takes a fuel to make it go. 

What Im asking is, if you have no way to investigate something that is fully transcendent, then how can you know anything about it?

I really want to stress, I know these questions really have no full answer. And if you have this feeling of knowing God that defies rational thinking, then cool. Its irrational, but alot of what people do is pretty damn irrational. 

As for faith, it sounds like your faith is definitely not build on fear. I'm glad it's not. Belief based on fear rings a little too much like Stockholm syndrome for my liking. It sounds like it's a subjective feeling you have experienced. I just want to know why this faith is placed in a god? We can have free will and help others from a purely secular humanitarian stance. No gods needed. Of course that also means that we cant point a finger to a devil or demon for the evil that humans can create too. It's a little sobering to know we are ultimately responsible for ourselves. But its rational. It's a step towards knowing that we have to take control our own destiny. 

You say god doesnt do anything to save people. So if it doesnt intervene at all... what use is a God? If you say that God created the universe, then ok. I just say that I dont know. Because we cant investigate before the Planck time. 

Ultimately, If this god is real and is benevolent, then surely he would appreciate that we cant know if he exists. And hopefully wont hold it against me. If he is there to judge us at the end of life, then fine. I'll be judged. I used the brain he created and didnt believe irrational things in this rational universe.

You are comfortable in saying ""I dont know"". I'm the same. Only I open that liberating feeling to admitting when I cant know something to a God concept too. This would change if evidence comes up.

So what if God is a vengeful god that will punish me for all eternity for not believing without evidence? Then I will be tortured. I'll have no way to defend against a being that has ultimate power. 

But I will know that I'm a more moral entity than that God. 

I'd say that we have evolved to help each other. Instead of created. There is too much in the body that would be a really silly design that would make me question a creator. 

But in terms of our bodies. We have mirror neurons. We have interconnected societies. He have empathy. Helping each other is natural. A survival tactic adapted from millions of years. And from that helping and empathy, we can understand that hurting others is bad. And morals come from that basis. Again, no need for a god.

I'll admit too, that I'm not an expert in this at all. And honestly, I'd love if there was some God that would be benevolent and kind to us. And an eternal afterlife? I'd freaking love that. I dont want to not exist. Existing is the most fun I've ever had.

I think the best we can do is just take this life as it comes. I think you explained yourself pretty well. Better than I could back when I was a believer. 
 
Either way, we will all find out some day. And for what it's worth, I'd like to be wrong. But I'll live each day as if I'm right. Anything after the end is a bonus then. It sounds like you already cracked that particular problem. But I guess homelessness and drugs either break a man, or make him. And I'm glad you got yourself out. Even happier to see you give that credit to yourself.

I hope I havent landed too much heavy questions on you all at once. Honestly I'm not trying to change your belief, I'm trying to find a way to some truth."

I wanted to touch on this point. You set up a bit of an all or nothing scenario. There is a third option. I dont accept that we dont understand anything. 

Human knowledge and understanding has come so far in the last thousand years. And exponentially so in the last hundred years or so. We dont understand absolutely everything, but we do know a fair bit. Enough to know that people can exist together and celebrate our differences.

What we should do is try to do the best we can based on the best evidence available. And when new information comes to light, we should reevaluate and do better. We might be small. But we can move mountains. We can land probes on comets. We can go back to the moon! We can even help others and lift them up and expect nothing in return.

And while not one bit of that needs a god, I'd be long in the ground before I tell someone they have to give up a non harmful belief.

Yeah, I've cut your argument short because it really doesnt matter. And no-one should have to read that much idiot speak more than once.

You say there is no evidence in the fossil record?

Have you looked at whale biology lately? The evolutionary path of whales is very well documented in the fossil record showing incremental changes over time. Not to mention their genetic makeup has been decoded and links can be seen to other close species of animals.

Genetics is the study of Gene's passed down from one generation to another. Evolution is the changes in gene frequency over time.

>Sexual reproduction isn’t the same thing either.

Sexual reproduction is gene recombination. And it is one of the ways gene frequency changes from one generation to another. Its linked.

People are really good at genetic engineering. What do you think agriculture is? We did similar adjustments to dogs. Making them more docile and companionable. Humans changed bananas to the nice fruit we have today. Just because we didnt do it in a lab doesnt mean that people havent been tinkering with the natural order of things for centuries. Dogs prove that.
