Just choose between one color light, or unlimited colors, you can program the bulb to be red, green, blue, whatever.  But, you have to keep your light switch on for the bulb to work and follow timer routines etc.  An alternative is to put whatever light bulb you want in the fixture, and replace the switch with a smart switch.  The downside is that you can't play colors with the bulbs."
smarthome,ffgsies,t3_eth5qm,1579913931.0,"The Echo Plus advertises that it works as a hub, but I found some limitations.  For my son who's just starting out we determined that the Google Assistant/hub is more universal and it's easier to just buy things that are Google compatible.

I ended up getting a Samsung SmartThings hub since I had already committed to the Echo/Alexa universe.  So my lock, my switches, my plugs and light bulbs are all run through my SmartThings hub, then I enabled the SmartThings skill in Alexa.  So now I can use Alexa to voice command everything that is in my SmartThings Hub universe.

Now, one thing I learned the hard way: It's better to get things like bulbs, switches, etc. all the same brand.  For every device you install, it needs an app to run it.  Then you tell SmartThings to run the device (some exceptions, like my lock which is installed right in SmartThings).  You're better off getting as much of one brand as possible so there's fewer apps you have to run to get everything to play nice with each other.  So I wish I had gotten all one brand instead of Phillips Hue bulbs, TopGreener switches, GE switches (different applications), etc.  So my smat home is something of a mish-mash.

Also, since you're Echo/Alexa based, try to get items through Amazon that are Alexa compatible.  For instance, I wanted a video doorbell and a smart thermostat.  I was better off getting Ring doorbell and Ecobee thermostat.

My son on Google Assistant is better off getting Nest stuff.

Note: Since OP already has an Echo Plus, I really recommend the [Ecobee thermostat.](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B06W2LQY6L/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o05_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)  It is a thermostat that is also an Echo/Alexa unit.  Works really well.

But I was in a situation where I was at 3 weeks, I was traveling and was going to be on TV, and I wouldn't be able to get my hair cut  again until I was 5-6 weeks out.  So I called the guy that I've been going to for 20 years.  It's been 3 weeks, just clean me up so  I look good for my TV appearances.  Just a little trim.  ""Too busy, sorry, but my best stylist can see you tonight.""  Okay.  I'm in a jam and I have to trust him, and therefore trust his best stylist.

I explained the situation. I'm at 3 weeks, just clean me up.  She  took the clippers and scalped me up the back.  Later my regular guy said he saw it and was mortified.  No turning back now, I can't replace it.  She knew she did a shitty job, so she tried to cover it by leaving my hair soaking wet and promised it'd look good after it dried (after I left).

I called my regular guy and he tried to fix it, but as he explained, anything he did would be cutting even more off.  I basically had to live with it.  My press coverage just had me with a crew-cut because that's all we could do.  

It's just hair, no one cares, it grew back, the press was good for my business, but as a details-oriented person, it was a pretty damn big detail at the time.

So, I didn't say anything in the moment (wish I had embarrassed her in front of the whole shop), but the owner knew that his ""best stylist"" screwed me up bad.  It cost her.  Eventually she moved to another salon.

The third was new construction in a subdivision that came with a sprinkler system and sodded new.  I had a couple of problem spots (I learned how to move/replace/add sprinkler heads) and after 10 years had some weed problems, but it was so much better than what I had.  Basically did the Scott's 1-2-3-4 program and dropped some ironite and some lime each year.  Cut it myself and it was all good.

My current home is new construction, now one  year old.   The deal was, they'd sod the front and hydroseed the back.  Sadly, cheaply, they laid down unclean fill (clay, rocks, construction debris) and in the front they put sod on top of it.  This fall I was able to keep the sod alive, but I could just lift it up off the base eight months later.  The only real problem I had on the sod side was crabgrass growing in the seams of the sod, I used a lawn weed puller to yank that crap up.

The back yard has been a nightmare.  The hydroseed took, then died, and my backyard was nothing but crabgrass and sedgeweed.  I'm still fighting with the builder over the stones and crap ""topsoil"" they laid.  In a *realistic* world, I'd be satisfied with them laying a couple inches of real topsoil and hydroseeding again, since I had a sprinkler system installed before they laid the lawn.

But in an *ideal* world, I'd lay down some good topsoil, put down some good locally-grown sod (we have a great sod farm nearby, and they'll lay it).  Soooo much easlier than  trying to coax seed to grow.  But, just for my backyard  (quarter-acre lot) it'd cost about $2000 just for the sod, and I'm guessing another $1000 to put down the topsoil base.    So the fight goes on with the builders.

This was the first thing I noticed.  The shadows, or lack of them, also makes it look like the shoes are not contacting the rail.  It looks a bit like he's floating.

Greatest Vocal Performance:  For the harmonies: If I Fell.  For the rock: Twist and Shout.  One take at the end of a marathon session and he gave it his all and created a classic.

Best Guitar:  The End.  Lots of other leads are arguable as to who's playing.  I think the intro to Day Tripper was John, and that was groundbreaking, so maybe I'll go with that.

Best Piano:  Imagine.  Not the most difficult, but iconic.

Underrated Song: Beautiful Boy.  Sappy, Double Fantasy is overrated because of the timing of release and assassination, but this song can bring me to tears.

Overrated song: Love Me Do.  Yes, it was their big breakout, but compared to what came soon after, it's kinda dull.

Funniest: Norwegian Wood.  Had a bad date and he burns the house down.  Shouldn't have made him sleep in the bathtub, hon.

Happiest Song: She Loves You.  Yeah, yeah yeah!  Just unbridled joy.

Saddest:  A collaboration, but She's Leaving  Home.  It's a total bummer.
