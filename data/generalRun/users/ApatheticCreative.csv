patientgamers,fethwi2,t3_eqj99i,1579375610.0,"We had kind of an older, lower end computer when I was growing up.  I couldn't get Doom to run, but I had Wolfenstein 3d, and I recall getting some piece of shareware to run beautifully that absolutely blew me away.  It was an FPS in the vein of Wolfenstein 3d, and it had some kind of mining colony sort of theme, and I remember there were people hanging from the walls, and you could shoot them.  Basically the whole game had faded from my memory, and all that remained was the feeling I had when I discovered our poor little 486sx could run such an impressive 3d game.

Something made me think of that game into my 30's, and I set off on a quest to figure out what it was.  Some Google-fu and a few tries that just weren't it and I landed on [Depth Dwellers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vSeLXmi9ZoM).  The title screen and the music instantly triggered that old memory for me.  I had found it.  Excited, I fired it up on my restored Pentium 233mmx and got stuck in.

Aaaand it sucks.  It's a weird, kind of awful, generic sort of PC fps that were a dime a dozen in an era where everyone was trying to capitalize on the success of Doom.  In hindsight, if I had never gone looking for it all these years later, that old good feeling would remain.  Instead it was replaced by a ""Wow, I was naive and sort of stupid."" kind of feeling.

There are some other games that are good games, but I find I don't really have the patience for anymore.  Back in the day, I wouldn't get a lot of new games, so when I did get one I would make it count.  Also there weren't a lot of other distractions to take me out of the game.  It's harder to really get absorbed into a game when I have email, text messages, Youtube, Reddit, and a thousand other things constantly vying for my attention.  We're not allowed to be bored anymore, and I think boredom was exactly the ticket that allowed us to enjoy certain games on a level that we just don't these days.  Sometimes I have to just have a weekend where I shut off the router, turn off and put away my phone, kill the TV, and sit in front of my mid-90s gaming PC and allow myself to become bored.  Baldur's Gate is an easier sell when I don't have a thousand other distractions promising more immediate satisfaction for my now short attention span.  It's therapeutic in a way."

So even if you're skipping breakfast, it's still absolutely possible to eat enough to slow or halt weight loss, or even cause weight gain in the other 8 hours of the day.

I would recommend calorie counting, even though you're already doing 16:8.  [Calculate your TDEE](https://tdeecalculator.net/) (Total Daily Calorie Expenditure), and be honest about your activity level.  I just pick sedentary no matter how much I think I exercise.  I work in an office, so I sit a lot.  This will also give you your BMR (Base Metabolic Rate), which is how much you burn just by existing, minus any exercise.  As long as your overall daily consumption is less than your TDEE, you will continue to lose weight.

Piracy,fdxtqqo,t1_fdvs8n4,1578772825.0,"Eh, I think there's a bit of a balance required here.  As Gabe Newell once said, ""Piracy is almost always a service problem and not a pricing problem.""

When he said this, he was talking about offering a better service than the pirates, without implementing intrusive always-online DRM and other underhanded techniques.  However I think this also means pirates can offer a ""better"" service even if you, the storefront, are doing everything right.

Piracy often means navigating among some less-than-scrupulous sites, and you're at risk of downloading a fake, or even a virus infected fake. Even some of the most well-known and popular places to pirate have been accused of sneaking bitcoin miners into their releases.  Still, pirates gonna pirate, and people have become pretty adept at navigating these seas.  It is easier and faster, however, to just jump on Steam or GOG and get your game legitimately. (As long as you have the money, but if you didn't you wouldn't be buying it anyway.)  They offer a better service, and as long as this is true piracy won't hurt sales.

However it's possible for some group to create a better, faster, more convenient pirate website that arguably offers a better service than the legit ways of buying.  Nintendo recognizes these, and tries to put a stop to them.  They want to put a damper on ""casual piracy"", where downloading their IP is as easy as jumping on a friendly, well coded site that's easy to navigate and happily downloading away through fast servers.  You can't stop piracy, but you can make it just a bit more difficult, therefore making your own legitimate service more convenient and easier."

BecomingTheIceman,fc8yeuf,t3_egfn8q,1577544095.0,"I think like lots of things, you are stressing certain systems.  Like the stress of exercise will enhance your strength and speed, but immediately after exercise you feel sort of weak and slow, especially if you've been sedentary.  Your muscles may even hurt due to delayed onset muscle soreness, or DOMS.  If you were trying to convince someone on the benefits of exercise, they might say ""Man, I tried that.  It made me so weak and tired and my arms hurt for days.  Exercise is bad for you.""

We live such comfortable lives these days, and it's natural for us to want to avoid discomfort.  But the lack of stressors on our bodies have largely made us soft.  Stressing out bodies intentionally and under controlled circumstances will trigger a built in response to grow stronger.  Exposure to cold will allow you to eventually develop a resistance to it.  Stressing your muscles with strength training will eventually increase your strength.  Controlled hyperventilation causing controlled hypoxia will strengthen systems designed to deliver oxygen to your cells.

Like all things, control and caution is key.  Extreme hypoxia can kill brain cells and cause all kinds of problems, but under control and moderation with a nice recovery, it's like exercise.  Over-exercise too can cause injury.  You can tear muscles.  So just like you wouldn't try and bench a weight that's too heavy for you, don't overdo your breath work and it will be beneficial."
