No one has control over who they're attracted to and they can't really explain why. I couldn't logic my way back into wanting to have sex with them. I can't explain why some things are sexy to me and other things aren't. Wanting to have sex is illogical at the basic level, it doesn't make sense to try to explain attraction. I can't tell you why I'm attracted to women, I can't even begin to put it into words. What am I supposed to do if I'm no longer attracted to them after that? Hate myself for my inadequacy?

DnD,fejwd9m,t1_fejlwmj,1579187370.0,"Absolutely. And that's where I think combat as war shines because it places an emphasis on the enemy thinking with purpose. If it makes sense for them to murder go for it. If it's a crazy deranged madman who likes to see people bleed, maybe he wants to cut an ear off for a trophy and run away. My point was that attacking players on the ground seems more like an out of universe solution to a mechanics problem of not wanting your players to meta game death saving throws. Everyone trying to murder each other senselessly sounds like a universe of murder hobos to me. Even mercenaries might be put off on the idea of just slitting people's throats unnecessarily. I try not to make my fights let's bash each other until one of us is dead. Murder is a drastic measure for a lot of encounters. If you angered a group of street thugs for example, why should they fight to the death or try to kill you? They'd beat you to a pulp and they're not doing you any favors, but I would assume they'd probably just want to send a message and take your stuff, because murderers aren't usually accepted back into society even a bloodthirsty society. But if there's an in universe explanation for stabbing people on the ground go for it. I still think a combat veteran would try to incapacitate a group before going for the kill on each of them, because when they're doing their cost evaluations at the second you're talking about, it doesn't make much sense to waste a turn cleaning up the guy on the ground when the wizard next to him is about to glass you. Some groups are really cavalier about murder in D&D, and in reality even hardened criminals struggle to just kill people. When you look at real life combat a lot of soldiers would hesitate to just shoot someone on the ground (unless they are a seasoned vet like you said). But I think we agree for the most part in that some situations call for cleaning up kills and some don't. I think it adds more to the narrative when they run into real murderers. It makes them scarier. If everything is willing to sacrifice its life to kill your PCs I feel like it takes away from the gravitas of the big bad. Most people won't fight to the death unless their back is to the wall. Sun Tzu says to always give your enemy a way out because if he is cornered and has nothing to lose he will fight with everything he has."

Replace hunting with anything. People fall out of love for all kinds of reasons. Maybe I don't want to date people who like the ocean, or who really like dogs, or who are into the outdoors. At the very basic level are we not just choosing who we date based on facets of their identity? Why is this choice off limits for what is attractive or unattractive for me? If I think librarians are really sexy, and you look like a librarian, and let me believe you're a librarian, and then you tell me you aren't a librarian but you have all the trappings of a librarian, and I'm not attracted to you anymore, and the part of my brain that wants to have sex with librarians isn't into it anymore, that's fine. Why does my brain think librarians are sexy? Who knows. I can't math out my sexual preferences. It gets pretty Freudian when you're trying to evaluate why you want to fuck some people and not others."
videos,fejbwne,t1_fej6i36,1579166253.0,"The deal breaker is sexual attraction and the mental element that plays into wanting to have sex. Is it fatphobic to not be attracted to fat people? Sexual preference doesn't have to be phobia. It's really hard to explain why you want to have sex with certain people and not others. If you were to say why won't you date people who look like xyz my answer would be it just doesn't do it for me. I don't like women who dress certain ways. It's not a phobia, I'm just not attracted to that. Sometimes even opinions can ruin attraction. It's a complicated business. Ever had a crush say something and all the sudden you're not interested anymore? It's seriously complicated. I don't think you can boil it down to phobia. I can't explain why I'm into the sexual preferences I have more than anyone else can."

I understand it's noble but would you go to jail right now for the rest of your life if it meant (maybe) catching someone involved? We let the government throw the book at hackers. No one stands up for ethical hackers / data activists when they need help, I don't see why they would do us a favor."
apexlegends,fef0xhb,t1_feer0ze,1579045589.0,That works too. I've just found it to be rather underwhelming with the surplus of gold stuff these days.  And it doesn't really factor in to gameplay much. How inventive can you be with her ult compared to other champs? Not very. I think a new ult would give her a higher skill ceiling and make her feel more viable.
science,feexrsk,t1_feecc14,1579043534.0,"Plenty of companies will still fire you for smoking, even in legal states. That's a huge barrier to an honest collection of this kind of data. I don't care what other people think, so social stigma is irrelevant to me, but I wouldn't report smoking for that reason. I would seperate a fear of reporting because of how your family/friends will view you and a fear of reporting because of your job imo. This helps fuel the stigma because intelligent professionals would never let on that they smoke, so people think they don't exist."
apexlegends,feeqkhu,t1_feekixv,1579039105.0,They should rework her ult. Everything else is fine imo. Call it like Guardian Angel and let her pick up a downed ally from distance to be back by her side with half shields / health. Have a little soul leaving the body animation and they're back to wherever she is. Give it like a 100-200m cap. Could alternatively let her call in dropships as an ult with banners.

It's criminally underesearched because it's illegal federally, and so just because a study about it doesn't exist doesn't necessarily disprove anything when it comes to THC. There's so much fake science in relation to weed because it's so hard to get funding to research it and there's restrictions on how it's done.

""Marijuana remains fully illegal at the federal level, and strict federal access policies tie the hands of researchers like UC’s Angela Bryan and Kent Hutchison, who aren’t allowed to bring the drug on campus or be present when it’s consumed. The only way they can study Boulder’s plentiful potheads, they’ve discovered, is by parking their “Cannavan” outside a home while its residents use the drug inside. They then ask them to come outside to the van for tests of how its active ingredients, called cannabinoids, have affected them.""

It's really hard to get funding to research something that according to the government 'has no medical application'. Same thing has plagued THC research for so long, and still does."

Rather than having him have a direct shop, an Amazon referral link would be fine. Don't a lot of reviewers have paid links? Tons of reviewers I watch even do sponsored content, and I don't distrust their reviews.

ElegooMars,fbl27ez,t3_edqsrf,1576957577.0,"What's your exposure time? I find that the reason my prints fails largely revolves around dialing in my settings for the resin I'm using. Also, I find that I have more luck if I angle the print. When you have a large flat print area like that, if it doesn't cure properly it can start to sag, and then that weight can throw off the other side. I was recently having trouble with a lot of failed prints with the elgoo translucent red, but after I upped my exposure time and tweaked a few of the other settings I had much more success. My failed prints looked similar to yours."
