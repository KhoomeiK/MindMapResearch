AskReddit,fdk7s8k,t1_fdk5trm,1578498027.0,"This is an excellent point, great observation. I would like to throw out a counter argument though; you don’t have to assume that FTL travel is actual high speed movement. For example, if you pinch space and slowly walk (OK, fly at 10,000 KPH) across then you will travel at FTL speed but your velocity will always remain low. Now you just have to make an argument on why pinching space doesn’t require a lot of energy. 

Another take on this that I saw was that FTL was enabled by wormholes. To get the energy for the hole they tapped into a super nova that was currently exploding. That meant that the worm hole was only available for a short period of time (and that the velocity of travel was relatively low)."

Whiskyporn,fd63txn,t1_fd5rgly,1578185153.0,"I think the shot is great. I wish that it included her face, but understand why it doesn’t. 

My favorite whiskyporn shots are classy photos of women with whisky. This is a great example. She likes Laphroaig and she is topless. It is sexy (not sexual) and honors whisky. That is awesome.

I also appreciate the suggestion that she is bottomless but that is left to the imagination. I like it because it honors the sexy suggestion but does not push into sexually.

8/10:  Minus 1 because it’s not my wife and minus another 1 due to the missing face.  Great photo. Tell her that she looks great.

There are no exceptions and I will walk out of my way to make it happen. 2) if my credit card is out of my wallet then my wallet is in my hand. 3) shoes have their spot. 4) each pocket has its designated item(s) and I check all pockets before leaving the house. 5) Parking stubs go either on this spot in the center console or in my pocket.
