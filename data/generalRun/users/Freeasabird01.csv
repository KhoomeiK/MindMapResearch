No matter what side you say youíre coming up on, a large percentage of people are instinctually going to move aside without regard to what side you called out.

trailrunning,fffdrfr,t3_etbxg4,1579881729.0,"Good for roads is subjective. Being a good shoe for trails means it has soft aggressive knobby tread. The same tread will wear easily and quickly on roads. Likewise, many trail runner shoes (and the ones I prefer) have a shank in them to protect your arch should you step on a sharp rock. That same shank will make the shoe heavier and less comfortable on the road.


So if I were you I would just find a good trail runner shoe that fits well and has the features you want and only use it for the trails. In the long run this is more financially cost effective anyway because trying to have a do-all shoe will only wear out that one shoe prematurely."

Frugal,ffcsigt,t1_ffcpcve,1579806360.0,"Same boat here. I bought a new Tacoma 2 years ago, expecting to drive about 12k per year and have it for a minimum of 10 years. I don‚Äôt have a daily need for a truck, but do need one probably 6-12 times per year. At the cost of rental it was worth the convenience just to buy one to have myself. 


Now I‚Äôm driving more like 22k miles per year. The cost of gas is much higher. I did the math, and to sell my truck and replace it with a used late model car that gets 40+mpg, that has 30-50k miles on it, and then rent a truck when I need one, would save me in the long term about $50/month. 


Then I have to consider if that‚Äôs worth it to me to go through the effort of renting a vehicle every month or two. I feel stuck, like I wish there was a better solution. 


A third option was to buy a second vehicle, like a 10+ year old Prius and keep the truck, but that would take 4 years to make a return."

The most generous explanation I can give is that you got a different gloss level. Contractors frequently use flat because it‚Äôs easy to cover fixes without having to repaint a whole wall.

fatlogic,ffc50mo,t1_ffbowvs,1579791676.0,"To add to this, there are some theories around weight loss, specifically progression. There‚Äôs this concept that fat cells aren‚Äôt added or lost, they just empty and go into ‚Äústorage‚Äù when you lose weight. But that process is energy intensive, so the cell fills with water in the short term until your body is reasonably sure it‚Äôs not going to need to just fill it back up with fat a day later. So even though you‚Äôve lost the fat, you haven‚Äôt lost the weight because the space was replaced by water. And this is why for some people it takes weeks or even months of consistent habits to see weight loss on the scale."

My wife, who is clinically obese always complains that I can eat anything I want and don‚Äôt gain weight. Or that I can lose weight so easily when I try. Well that‚Äôs because when I drink alcohol I have a beer, maybe two. And that‚Äôs only a few times a week. When she drinks she has three or four or five glasses of wine, and that‚Äôs almost every night. I eat smaller portions so I can still enjoy the junk food dessert. I don‚Äôt drink soda or sweet tea.

personalfinance,ffbvfh8,t3_espt97,1579784084.0,"This is a comparable situation to what my wife did. She went back to school in her early 30s to become an RN, and then again in her late 30s to become an NP. We now have 100k in student loan debt from those two. We will be paying a small mortgage for the next 12-15 years. Without kids, we could easily overcome the financial strain that extra payment causes. But having kids as we do, it really is a burden to our current living. 

We‚Äôre now in our early 40s, with kids, making 200k+ combined, and have effectively no discretionary income for fun or vacations. At least not for a couple more years until other debts are paid. 

So what I‚Äôm getting at is, if you two are planning to have children soon, consider the additional costs involved with that, specifically but not limited to daycare."

But, engines also have a certain volume of air that needs to pass through the engine in order to perform a certain way. When air gets cold it gets denser. This means that to have the same volume of air going through the engine, you need more of it, which means more oxygen particles, which means more fuel to balance the ratio. This is why hotrodders like cold air intakes - they make the engine use more fuel which gives more power. The downside is cold air uses more fuel."
