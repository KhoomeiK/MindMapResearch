Epilepsy,fdzr9qx,t3_eng51v,1578793960.0,youre not nuts. theres a million different changes in the brain that can cause your threshold to be raised
Nirvana,fdzfovm,t3_endt6g,1578789767.0,"try listening to different styles of music that you would never think youd enjoy. theres plenty of indie bands influenced by nirvana, my favorite being courtney barnett. i stopped playing guitar for an entire 6 months to indulge in some other hobbies i wanted to get better at or try. when i started playing again it felt like i was walking on sunshine. maybe this is just your subconscious telling you to try something new. dont overthink it. the best thing you could do is probably to pass on your knowledge and love for the band to other people. p.s people need reassurance sometimes, youre not stupid. you wouldn't be aware if you were stupid"
