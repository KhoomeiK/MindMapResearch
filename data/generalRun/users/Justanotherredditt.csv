bodyweightfitness,fexz59k,t1_fexyuod,1579438625.0,"All good man, although it would make logical sense that if you were to fix your form on deadlifts (which is generally the issue with lower back pain when doing them), then you could successfully build up the muscle surrounding the injury and ""fix"" it. I had double shoulder surgery and since starting to lift weights my shoulders have never felt better."

exjew,fds2uwh,t1_fds2nfm,1578693541.0,"My favorite part of it is their flawed logic of “well it’s a Jewish country, so we need to follow the rules of the religion”, and then in the same sentence claiming Israel is the only democracy in the ME. Lol"

Basically every religious person in the group has been posting about how this is the downfall of Israel, how god is upset with us, how the last round of rocket attacks is because of the Shabbat bus service (lmfao). Your basic crazy shit. But it’s been going on for two months now"

There's always ways to do compound lifts. I work out on my front porch with very, very minimal equipment but I found ways online how to do alternative compound lifts"
