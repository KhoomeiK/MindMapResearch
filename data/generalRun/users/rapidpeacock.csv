Browns,ffdc0pl,t3_essv3r,1579817658.0,You know what I like doing after moving? It is to move again! It’s great for kids and spouses and your own sanity. Joe has three kids and ripping them away from friends and an environment they just got used it really a great idea for kids. Wives love moving especially when you tell her it’s for sunny cleveland. For a team whose owner is known as a thief and makes changes at the drop of a hat. You’re right getting a pay huge raise and coaching another year for a SB contending team would be a bad move for his career. Especially since next year with another top ten Def you would have your pick of jobs and even possible head coaching opportunities. The right move is to coach for a team whose def was below average with holes for an owner who could fire you in a year even if you do a good job. A job where now you have to submit your game plan to the owner for approval. That’s the smart play. Money and title are the only thing that matters when choosing a new job. Fit doesn’t matter. Ownership doesn’t matter. Situation doesn’t matter. Coworkers don’t matter. Family doesn’t matter! Only your personal job title matters!!!

Browns,ffcbw2h,t1_ffbwwt8,1579796104.0,I disagree. It is not a silly rumor. why would the niners want to allow losing a coach they value? They can match money or make it close enough to make him interested in staying. It happened to McDaniels. Also if Woods values stability I would stay the hell away from the browns. He maybe searching for a new job in a year. See our last DC. Where as in SF he’s probably safe for the next 4 years. But if he doesn’t mind uprooting his family after a year or two he could get two paychecks in  as soon as a year! One by the browns and one by his new team.

entitledparents,ff44bn0,t3_erihpv,1579555240.0,She will never learn if you let her off the hook. Demand payment for your “pain and suffering and any damage they may have caused”. Also demand a signed notarized letter from her your cousin admitting to the theft and apologizing for the attempted theft. Make it all languages you speak and write with. Make them also sign a letter they will stay away from the house and stop begging for money from your grandparents. If she does that tell them you will drop the charges. There has to be consequences or she will pull this with others or with you again.

There is a track record of fuck ups stemming directly from ownership. 5 coaches in 8 years. I didn’t think that was possible. The last person who talks to him sways his decision. That is not a stable owner. So yeah hiring a coach that can’t tell a playbook apart seems to be a problem. Do I like we are going a more analytical route, yes. Did I prefer a head coach that has previous NFL head coaching experience, yes. In Sashi we trust. We are Browns fans. We are legion. We are always disappointed."
