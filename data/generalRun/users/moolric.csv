“A not-quite epic science fiction adventure about a down-on-his luck galactic pilot caught in a cross-galaxy struggle for survival! Space travel just isn't what it used to be. With the invention of Quantum Teleportation, space heroes aren't needed anymore. When one particularly unlucky ex-adventurer masquerades as famous pilot and hate figure Jacques McKeown, he's sucked into an ever-deepening corporate and political intrigue. Between space pirates, adorable deadly creatures, and a missing fortune in royalties, saving the universe was never this difficult!”

It’s funny, with very good characterisation and very descriptive of how the environments. The metaphors have a Douglas Adams feel, but the story is more frenetic.

> Natural grey wet clay usually comes from humus (organic), some iron (magnetite ) presents grey, and sometimes high msgnesium turns grey (rare). Orange at bisq is always iron. Purple brown at glaze leads me to believe you have a cross over bed: both iron disulfide and magnetite iron sources. Iron disulfide goes brown when fired above cone 3. Magnetite in combination with titanium will go purple. The combination of two colors makes me believe there is two different iron sources. 

So magnetite and titanium. I have a clay that he theorises has magnetite in it too, so I might add some titanium to it and see what happens."
