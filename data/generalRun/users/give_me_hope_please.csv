offmychest,fcpx65h,t1_fcpwlnc,1577874066.0,I had that for 5 years. I did that 3 times for five years and had urge to masturbate to underage girls. And I did that for a year as well with just kids picture from Google. I suddenly stopped it from last week. I was disgusted by myself. If you want to know more see my post in confession. Now when ever I just control my urge It just grows and end up in my pedophile addiction. Buy for now I actually stopped it for a week. I just hope it wouldn't happen again and I would just masturbate to normal stuff. I hope you can change as well. Don't give up dude.
offmychest,fcpw7h9,t1_fcpvg0j,1577873470.0,For you its weed. For me its just worries and disappointments. I wanted to do make the new year better one. But I cant give up masturbating because doing that makes me think worse stuff or do worse stuff. I hope i could change that. You hold yourself dude. Don't ruin your life with weed. Have yourself at control  :)

offmychest,fc5fdqf,t1_fc5afyb,1577455986.0,"Thanks for actually reading this. I thought nobody would. By the way. I never have any sexual thoughts or to touch a child under 18. It never crosses my mind because when i am outside my house I just concentrate on my routine and other thought would not cross my mind. Even if it did it never lasts long as I distracted with my work. So, it never happens. It only happens when i am aroused and I came across a underage girl picture.

I am actually working on figuring out what is the actual problem here. Because i feel like a different person when i am aroused and i see a underage girl's picture. I don't even know where to look for help. If you have any helpful websites i can look at or books which can help to understand me better I would appreciate it to share with me. Thank you."
offmychest,fbdxdag,t1_fbdwkxi,1576773457.0,"Yeah, i am also aware of the boundaries in this stuff. That's why i am very careful around any girls that i would not provoke some disturbing thoughts. Thanks for your thoughts :)"
