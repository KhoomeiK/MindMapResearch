Justrolledintotheshop,ff0mkhk,t1_ff0c0de,1579470260.0,"It was amazing in regards to torque, and if you were careful with the clutch, and had enough road, you could go all the way up to 4th gear without touching the gas pedal once. Going up to 5th or 6th at idle was harder.

The problem was in slipping the clutch, the range was so narrow on my Jetta TDI, that you had maybe 1/4 inch of play - if even that - to balance the clutch. If you were off, and gave it too much throttle, it would leap forward. Too little, and you would get that brief ""RPM Blip"" that you get as soon as the clutch engages, where you can see the tachometer roll back slightly before rolling forwards. If at any point the needle dropped below 700 - and by using a ScanGauge II I could see that the instant it hit 699 RPM - it was instant shutdown. For an engine that idles at 800, it is a pretty narrow window.

Even after driving it for 3.5 years (before trading in for dieselgate) I stalled it monthly. It was the computer doing the shutdown, the injectors just stopped supplying fuel as soon as that threshold was passed. You have about 101 RPM below idle to play with, then POW. Stalled."
Justrolledintotheshop,ff0bp54,t1_ff0b3bu,1579467329.0,"Thanks! And you are absolutely right. I am an early adopter, and this is still new tech. 

There are free chargers at my workplace, and I own a house with a 240v EVSE. I don’t think I would recommend an EV to someone without a house yet, as that would potentially be a major PITA. I have gone up to 2 months though, with only charging my car at the free work chargers, just to see If I could, but it is easier to just plug it in when I get home and forget about range anxiety."

It is so clearly the way forward, once you try it, you can’t imagine going back. When driving another vehicle now, the idea of shifting gears, even in an automatic— I can feel it as a jarring motion. The electric is just so smooth and torquey. 

Only thing I dislike about me EV is that the total range is about 90 miles. Perfect for 99% of my driving, and stupidly cheap to drive as well."
Justrolledintotheshop,fezb80w,t1_feyc8is,1579455609.0,"Good god, I used to have a VW TDI before Diesel Gate. Manual transmission 46-64 MPG (diesel cheating) and that thing was the most stall prone care I ever drove. 

You wanted to generally keep it between 1000-2000 RPM. But if you dropped the RPM below 700 even for a split second, The fuel injectors immediately stopped supplying diesel and the car would stall. I even stalled it on the highway in 6th gear, coming down a gradual hill, my rpms dropped below 700, and I didn’t notice until I popped it out of gear to put it in 5th, suddenly 0 rpm. At least you could bump-start it (because to restart it is key all the way off, key all the way on dangerous while moving an potentially locking the wheel). 

Drove manual all my life. That stalling on that car was brutal. 

After dieselgate, moved to electric. Not going back*

I find that it works better if you cover all sides of the pot with non-stick spray, add half a stick of butter to the bottom, then add the onions. Add kosher salt across the top to help in reducing them. 

Then, take the Dutch Oven, cover it, and add it to a 400 degree oven. Cook 1 hour.

After the hour is up, take the pot out, stir the onions, and use the onions to scrape any fond that may appear on the sides (not much at this stage).

Return dutch oven to the 400 F oven with the lid ajar to let moisture escape, for another 1-1 1/2 hours. Taking out to stir every half hour.

Onions will now be very reduced

Bring to stovetop, and heat, without stirring. WATCH CAREFULLY. This is where you have to be a master of fond! 

Deglaze with 1/4 of water. The fond should be deep chocolate, don't allow it to burn.

Do this THREE times. Building up a fond each time.

Finally, for the fourth deglazing, use the sherry.

This will produce a deep chocolate brown onions and soup with an amazing depth of flavour.

This soup is all about fond control. Get this wrong, and it will taste burned. Get it right, and it has an incredible deep flavour."

Also, skip the kosher salt cleaning and buy yourself an inexpensive cast iron chainmail scrubber. Throw the scrubber in the dishwasher after each cleaning. 

Finally, as per the fanatics over on /r/castiron season your pan with Crisco. It takes longer to do, but produces the longest durable finish. (High omega oils will produce a beautiful black finish... for about 2-3 months, then flake off in large paint-peeling chunks)."
