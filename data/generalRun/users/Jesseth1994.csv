anhedonia,fehn6wt,t1_fegtjay,1579119947.0,I'm talking with my doctor about TMS!! Could you share a bit about your experience if you don't mind? At what session did you notice improvements? And in what form did these improvement manifest itself? Feeling emotions again? Food that actually gives that good feeling again?
