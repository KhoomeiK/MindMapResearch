AskReddit,ffg130q,t1_ffcfbl4,1579896165.0,"Most inner-city public railways like here in Dallas we have Dallas Area Rapid Transit (DART), which is essentially an above-ground subway train that spiders out through the metroplex to offer cheap and convenient public transit.

Pretty sure DART is too negligent to bother checking tickets. I paid $9 for a day pass last weekend for me and my son. I could have legitimately skipped it and just hopped on and nobody would have known the difference.

And except for the stop nearest my house being the last stop on the rail in my part of DFW, you could probably ride it for most, if not all, of the day and go unnoticed (assuming you were in a car that wasn't attached to the conductor)."

AskReddit,fffyb2m,t3_esse9d,1579894457.0,"Background: I've struggled with my weight since I was a teenager. My hormones worked crazy fast at growing me up. In the 7th grade, I could almost pass for a 17 year old. I was tall and I had filled out early. I was relentlessly teased, ridiculed, and bullied about being fat (which I was actually not). At any rate, I started to eat my feelings (self-fulfilling prophecies much?) and did start gaining weight. Before I had my weight loss surgery, I weighed 365 lbs. I also suffer heavily from Body Dysmorphia and BPD. I have never thought of myself as pretty or beautiful.

Story: A short time after my son was born, I went shopping with my ex husband (we were still married at the time) to buy some clothes at Lane Bryant. I was probably around 300 lbs at this time. I just remember looking at a top, and the voice of a woman caught my attention. She said, ""Excuse me, sir."" She was in a motorized scooter, so my husband made to move himself and our stroller out of the way, thinking he was blocking her path and even apologized for being in her way. I turned to witness the exchange, and this caricature of a wild-haired older woman wearing red-rimmed glasses was reaching up to touch my husband's elbow. She smiled up at him and said, ""I just want you to know that your wife is absolutely beautiful. You're very lucky!"" She turned and leveled a smile at me and I walked over to stoop and give her a hug to thank her. We exchanged pleasantries and she turned and went about her day after wishing us a nice day.

&#x200B;

That woman, for no reason whatsoever, felt the need to point out something I was more or less ignorant of. And she didn't say it to me, she told my husband. I dunno, it just always really stuck with me."

Especially in the ""purer"" breeds that tend to suffer from health issues such as joint pain, hip dysplasia, and even underdeveloped tendons in some cases.

Don't just sit by and watch your life happen to you, actively participate in your future: join clubs, get into theater, apply for scholarships, chase the thing you want most in life and never look back.

And that no one's opinion of me matters except for my own. Don't let them bully you and keep you down. And no person will ever be able to validate you. That is something you have to learn to do for yourself.

Lastly, I would tell her that she is worthy of love and affection no matter how many people leave her life. Their reasons for leaving have nothing to do with you, and that's their problem to deal with, not yours. Be strong, never lose hope, and always keep love in your heart."
