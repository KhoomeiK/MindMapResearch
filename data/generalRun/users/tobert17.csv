Having two documents with the exact same title, in the exact same place, such that while totally distinct are indistinguishable until close inspection seems par for the course for this place of employment.

AskReddit,ff6vkuo,t3_erstu3,1579635777.0,"My partner has an ex who would sleep in the basement, nude. Apparently they were cooking one day and went to the garage to get something and on the way back was confronted by said ex, woken to an odd sound in the garage, nude and waving a decorative katana they had grabbed off the wall. Their response was something along the lines of ""dammit Carl! Put some pants on!""

comics,fey5cxi,t3_eqsrcp,1579441023.0,"I know hands are troublesome in comics, but even in real life I've found showing three like that awkward and weird. This is the first time I've seen it drawn and it looks even weirder.

It's why I always use thumb - pointer - index or pinky - ring - index to show three. Much less awkward feeling. Never go ring - index - pointer. It always feels like you're forcibly holding your pinky down, in the comic he's not even doing that. It's really trippy."

AdviceAnimals,fey3bet,t3_eqs5cu,1579440229.0,"My work is notoriously bad at getting people uniforms, especially if you are an odd shape. I refer to everyone who doesnt have the full uniform as ""the kid"". There are a few people who have been there years before me without their full uniform, there are people decades older than me that I've called kid.

Combine this with a fairly standard shape (I got my full uniform really quickly) and some of my coworkers think I have been there for much longer than I really have. It's a seniority based environment, so I'm okay with the tonnes of added respect I get from the proper old timers who otherwise wouldn't even give me the time of day."
