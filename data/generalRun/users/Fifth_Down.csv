The Big Ten, Pac-12, Northeast independents (Syracuse) and Ivy League all had basically the same incident happen to one of their schools. It even spilled over into basketball with the WAC.

The SWC, ACC, & SEC didn't have this ""second generation racism"" problem. Because they were still dealing with the immediate aftermath of outright segregation ""first generation racism.""

The Big Eight was the only major conference that wasn't recently segregated and didn't have a major case of friction between black players and their coach.

First generation racism: Jackie Robinson. You can have 1 or 2  black players and they can be treated like shit. Because they have to take and and be grateful we are just letting them play.

Second generation racism: The Black-14. Players said: ""we aren't going to take the mistreatment anymore. We aren't lucky to be here, we earned our place. It's time to move on from having 1-2 black players to a full team.""

The 1st generation is celebrated and noted for their success. The 2nd generation is not only not widely known, they never got justice. Most of them lost their scholarships and were kicked off the team. Their athletic careers were ruined.

I wanted to make a post highlighting this. The 2nd generation IMO is just as important as the 1st generation. The 1st generation broke the barrier. The 2nd generation worked to establish the standard the black players could no longer be discriminated against after they made the team. And both are critical to have a true desegregated team.

Gymnastics,fghqq1q,t1_fghfsmm,1580791224.0,"> is there an overall culture problem at the elite level compared to similar sports

All sports have this problem to some extent, but I'm gonna disagree with /u/pja314. I think it's far worse with the Olympic sports, and then a few sports within the Olympic movement are even worse relative to the regular Olympic sports because these sports:

1) Receive significantly less media coverage creating less oversight

2) The national team format means a select few coaches have dictatorial powers. The NFL is 32 teams keeping those 32 coaches in check. In USAG, it is one team, one goal, and only one coach/hierarchy with no one else to keep their power contained.

3) Gymnastics uses child athletes which are significantly more vulnerable to abuse. You can't push around an adult athlete in the way you can push around a child athlete. That's before you even get into the issue of sexual assault.

> Are athletes picked for team USA not training together so they can a) protect each other and b) other coaches hold each other responsible?

The USA has a club model because capitalism/private interests. These are business that produce an Olympian here or there to encourage 2,000 parents to sign their kid up to that club. A secondary problem is the young ages. In this sport the athletes need to be in school. So having them live in a dorm away from their parents in Colorado Springs as they turn 16 is not an ideal situation.

The USA model is considered ""semi-centralized"" where they use a hybrid of kids training at home, but then once a month they all hold camp at one location. It's generally considered the best of both worlds taking the benefits of the club model and the Colorado Springs model.

> And what does it take to simply wipe out whatever body is governing this and simply start fresh?

100% impossible.

Unlike the NFL, you can't just replace it with a rival league. The NFL, NCAA, and high school are all independent of each other. They all have their own ""rules"" of the game and are the authority on football matters for just that specific group (college, pro, high school). The NFL can disappear tomorrow and the NCAA will be fine.

USAG is the authority on gymnastics from the Olympic level to the pee-wee level. To take out the Olympic program means to take out the pee-wee program with it. The financial considerations are critical. You can't hold a gymnastics competition without insurance coverage, and you can't get insurance coverage without an organization like USAG acting as a ""standard"" so in the event that a kid gets hurt, event organizers can say ""we did everything right."" Under the logic: ""We followed the rules created by USAG which is the same organization that deals with the Olympics. If their rule didn't protect that kid from getting hurt, no rule will.""

Even if you accomplish all the above, you are still screwed. An organization like USAG depends on high, medium, and low level administrators scattered all over the country serving in various roles. These administrators are 100% responsible for the culture problem. You can't fix the sport without removing them, and yet you can't have an organization like USAG without them. To get rid of them would be like getting rid of every airline pilot in the country and then suddenly be surprised that you can't find a qualified pilot.

The only feasible scenario is USAG gets replaced with an organization that is 100% identical and has all the same problems. Same scumbags, different name."

It's a tough number to wrap my head around because when you are at an age where most are either near, or about to graduate college, at what point does the innocence of youth stop being an excuse? I'd give a lot of leeway considering these athletes are very sheltered, grew up in a bubble, and may be a little bit behind in their social development.

American WAG is starting to feel that way. Hearing what they had to endure revels just how tough and incredible they really were. Jordyn the gymnast was amazing in how she persevered.

And yet this fringe candidate was voted in quicker than just about anyone. It would be impressive for an Olympic AA Champion to get voted in that quickly. And yet ASac of all people does?

My tinfoil hat thinks there is some kind of sinister element at play. They knew that they had to get ASac in the HOF now because they wouldn't be able to do it later. The success of Americans in the 2008, 2012, and 2016 quads were going to ""harden"" the standards for American inductees in the same way it is hardened for Soviet inductees (Mukhina, Omelichik, Omelianchik, Filatova*, Mostepanova, Bicherova, Petrik, Muratova, Gutsu).

3) The NCAA has a sort of unwritten gentleman's agreement. The big schools get to control how the football championship works, the small schools retain control over how the basketball championship works.

4) March Madness funds the NCAA, these conference tie ins are critical to funding the small schools and everyone is represented because everyone needs a paycheck.

5) It's something that came about as a result of the evolution of the NCAAT. In its early days, it was nearly identical to a system that feels like it was written for football.

Adding to the complexity, it's hard to criticize two people who clearly love each other, have made it work, etc. Commentating negatively on the marriage of others is such a taboo subject and is often seen as out of bounds.
