civic,fdm1op7,t3_elw1mn,1578537700.0,"There's a lot to consider here but I'll try to clear up as much as I can.   


Do either of these cars still have a warranty and if they do will you be able to get warranty on them if you take it to a dealer?  Since honda changed how the a/c system works (refrigerant type) there's a fair # of them with a cooling problem. not only that but there could be a number of things you can get written off as warranty.   


Have all the necessary recalls/updates been performed? might seem minor but that's time you gotta take out of your schedule to do so maybe you can negotiate that to cut down the cost a bit?   


Can you take either of the cars to a shop to get it fully inspected? look for one that does free inspections and let them know why you're doing it. most of the time they'll go in-depth and check for things outside the norm if you let them know what's up.  

&#x200B;

Are you planning on changing cars anytime soon? you said 4-5 years or 120k km+ but either of those cars will last you over a decade if you take care of them. If you wanna get one car and run it till there's nothing left that in-depth one thing but if after 5 years you're gonna change it then it comes down to preference. 

&#x200B;

looks: this is so subjective Idk where to start. Personally I like the look of the '17 si but I hate the electronic e brake and how the shifter looks but those can be changed with some work. the '14 si to me feels like a little brother to the 8th gen si's but, again, preference.   


Feel: personally? I hate the 1.5L engine's Honda has been shoving into their newer cars. They just don't have the same kick. I've said it before but I'd much rather get the 2.0 civic sport in manual than a 1.5L turbo'd si. I say stick with the '14 si if you want a bigger kick or jump when hitting the gas. + with the savings in price difference, you could add a few performance mods to make it feel better or faster.   


whichever you get take it to a trusted mechanic and get the oil changed, check the brakes, tires, filters, fluids, etc and maybe do a throttle body cleaning too just for kicks.   


p.s Idk how your financial situation is but if this is money be damned then just go for what you think looks cooler and what you think you'll enjoy driving more.

I really can't see that even being attempted nowadays without people straight up rioting or another civil war happening cause of various issues. 
Best course of action would probably be educate as many people as possible, get as many as possible to vote and vote on everything and then maybe after a decade or two of that we can attempt to seriously rewrite our foundations and institutions.
