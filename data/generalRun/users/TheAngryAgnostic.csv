Art,fgu3eqc,t3_f0bl51,1581112848.0,I want it on my wall.
todayilearned,fgqovpt,t1_fgo5o7m,1581028402.0,So... are you correcting me by using the same word I used?
todayilearned,fgqhctj,t1_fgo2s6m,1581024203.0,"It's called hydration. I'm a fucking red seal carpenter lol I build forms literally all day every day. I understand the argument. I made an offhand reddit comment about something I (thought i) remembered from school, and now everyone is trying to teach me the basics of concrete. I get it. We use 35mpa concrete for our footings, which is pretty fucking hard. We can order it all the way up to 60mpa I believe for special circumstances, it's just really expensive to do so."
todayilearned,fgowwr8,t1_fgo8itm,1580990181.0,I'll see if I can find where I read it after work. I'm talking specifically about the concrete they poured underwater. It was brought up in the concrete section of my carpentry schooling.
todayilearned,fgo2jkf,t1_fgnzlwu,1580958276.0,"Well, they also cast concrete underwater. The concrete they poured cannot be topped by modern means. That being said, that may have something to do with it having been curing for the last 2000 years."
rareinsults,fgnu00g,t3_ezg3r3,1580952872.0,...that's definitely Tyler.
mildlyinteresting,fglj7v2,t3_ez1etx,1580900506.0,Huh. My dad has literally the exact same one.
JusticeServed,fgjyoxy,t1_fgjphje,1580853992.0,"Yeah... you can go fuck yourself, inbred, racist swine that you are."
BlackPeopleTwitter,fgj3myt,t1_fghhv1p,1580836362.0,"Not really. I built some of the highest end office spaces in Toronto, all out of exotic hardwoods. Right now I work for a big concrete firm, putting up highrise buildings, and yeah it kinda sucks, but I clear $1200/week after tax... so that makes it a little easier."
BlackPeopleTwitter,fgib0k7,t1_fghfd3o,1580814819.0,That's funny. I made 100k last year.
nextfuckinglevel,fgh3zb5,t1_fggsze9,1580776144.0,"Been there. Rather unpleasant. Got to keep them both though, so I've got that going for me."

BlackPeopleTwitter,fgh3413,t1_fggdj2y,1580775554.0,Carpenters. Any skilled trade really.
nextfuckinglevel,fgcd7nh,t1_fgcbnxu,1580671516.0,"Yeah, but that's what I'm talking about. I'm a carpenter, I work for a big concrete firm, putting up buildings. I've done some countertops and stuff, but the forming and finishing of this kind of stuff, going from one plane and curving into another, I find really cool."
nextfuckinglevel,fgawt5d,t1_fg9euri,1580656266.0,"I'd disagree, just in that the construction of it is a little bit baffling, it would be hard as hell to form that for concrete."
funny,fg6ghs3,t3_ex468t,1580567311.0,"This is in Richmond Hill ON, a couple km away from my parents house. There's a small airport right there, Buttonville, but clearly this guy missed his approach."
toronto,fg10e0e,t1_fg0t734,1580418499.0,"Well, that got sad fast."
