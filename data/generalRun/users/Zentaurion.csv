""Free your willy..."" Don states emphatically. ""Reach in deep and unleash your Big Dick Energy upon a salivating universe that's just begging for it...""

Don gets up to start gesturing with his arms as he speaks.

""The internet is a glittering lure. But on the rare occasion the public can be engaged on a level beyond flash, if they have a sentimental bond with the product. Two words: incest porn.""

Everyone looks a bit ruffled by this but they stay rapt with attention.

""My first job, after everything became all e-this and e-that, I had to work with this old pervert, a dork called Teddy. He brought in his porn from home. Cutouts from old magazines, pages sticking together and half faded with age. I realised the most important thing about fapping is new. No one wants to fap to Grandma. Not that there's anything wrong with that sort of thing. We can certainly cater to mature tastes too..."" A few in the audience settle back in after looking like they were about to leave.

""But New... Creates an itch. You simply put your product in there as a kind of calamine lotion. But I also realised there could be a deeper level of engagement. Fappening. It’s delicate, but potent.""

Don clicks the next slide up. It shows an old man looking like he's dead or passed out, sitting on an old antique looking chair with trash piled up around him.

""Teddy told me that he'd kill anyone who tried to take his dirty jizz rags away from him. He never even realised when I had switched out his faded old porn with cutouts of home furnishings, plants, gardening tools. He couldn't even tell he'd been whacking off to hoes rather than hos. “Nostalgia” literally means “the pain from an old wound”. It’s a twinge in your peepee far more powerful than muscle memory alone. Fapping isn’t a spaceship, it’s a time machine. So open up a tab and buckle in, and let's set sail to fap right into the future.""

different_sob_story,fe9hbn3,t1_fe9199c,1578937589.0,"The way I see it, it's not to take the OC and make a mean-spirited joke at their expense, but also it's a bit dry when you stop at just giving it a different story. ""The joke"" should be in the ridiculousness of the story we give it, so it sounds almost plausible as the kind of titles that people make up for max karma points.

Or maybe it's just the ""reality is disappointing compared to what the OP sees in their own post"" argument. There's often the complaint of stuff on /r/pics where everyone's saying ""This isn't Facebook!"" and it's because we don't see the photo the way the OP saw it because they viewed it subjectively while everyone else is viewing it objectively. So I sometimes like to go for a title where it looks like OP is just living in their own world and trying to share something that doesn't make any sense to onlookers."

FanTheories,fe21pu7,t3_en824m,1578833532.0,"I totally agree with your point about The Last Jedi. Up until recently I've been one of the people with a passionate hatred for Rian Johnson as if he killed my father and did something horrible to childhood.

Then I watched Knives Out and remembered that this is the guy who made Looper and other things. ie, he's a very talented filmmaker and I'm looking forward to seeing the things he does next.

I can now at least respect what he was trying to do with The Last Jedi, and appreciate it for what it was. And kind of the same for Game of Thrones... I hate it for all the corners they cut along the way, the shittiness of seasons 5 to 7 and most of 8. There was so much nonsense that might have looked good and exciting on paper that made no sense on screen (Gendry running all the way to the Wall, characters such as Euron becoming stupidly inconsistent, etc). 

But I think the problem was they were trying to adapt what George RR Martin wrote, which became increasingly harder to adapt for a TV show, without having to cut corners. And I think the consensus view is that the way the show wrapped up overall is actually consistent with what GRRM has in mind for the books. But he gets to take his time fleshing out every story thread and backstory for every single character, haha, to give more satisfying depth to his work.

The unspoken thing about the show is that it was getting increasingly more expensive with each season, with everyone involved demanding more pay, so much like the ending, there was a difficult decision to be made about how much they could compromise on without it affecting ratings, and getting the balance right to end on a high. But think about how much Lena Headey was getting paid by the end (not to say she's any less than a fookin legend who's worth ten times her weight in the Iron Price), and think about how much Robert Downey Jr was getting paid by Avengers Endgame. The fact is, we tend to overlook that there is a real world price for our fantasy entertainment. And sometimes the producers just can't afford it with what they have to work with.
