JUSTNOMIL,fgkh8xf,t3_eyw6ao,1580865517.0,"Well played! 

Words of advice: The most important person who has your back knows what MIL did/ is like and that’s what matters most. Take the win and don’t play into MIL poor tactics or act like her by bragging and boasting about the footage you got, especially on the book of faces.  Take the high road and let her self destruct. 

And if it comes down to it and SO decides he wants to say something, trust me hearing from her own son about the footage he saw of his mom’s unbecoming behavior will have more of an impact than if you were to tell her yourself/ shame her on book of faces. Maybe not as satisfying, LOL, but again just putting you in a much brighter light in your SO’s eyes over nasty MIL. 

Checkmate!"

youngandtherestless,fg307mi,t3_ewgc2f,1580464109.0,"I’m glad but definitely hope to see improvements with the storylines so all of us viewers can truly stay engaged for the next four years and beyond. Really want this show to do well and stay on the air and would hate for the amazingly talented cast members to get bored or wonder if it’s time to jump ship. 

Does anyone know what the protocol is for submitting storylines/ideas to either the network or writers? Might be fun for viewers to create and or aid in some of the storylines to get creative juices flowing!

Congrats to the cast for another 4 years of Y&R!"
aww,fg1g74q,t3_ew99wm,1580426523.0,"“That Dad” being the type that’s super smitten by having a really cute kid that he’s got to brag and take lots of pictures to show off what he’s so happy to have brought into this world. Despite knowing that he’s probably the main person who cares the most with this reveal and knows he is boasting, he’s a proud parent and isn’t ashamed for it. 

People, let the man be giddy over having an adorable girl ... yes it’s bragging but it’s also super awesome to see parents who care.

OP, I got your back! Happy Birthday to your beautiful little princess! I’m a proud parent too!"

I’m sorry people can’t see they are making what should be yours and your fiancé’s day all about them.  Hope you and your fiancé can see this and reconnect, being unified and stronger than ever. 

A reality check might be in order with the FILs. No need for threats, just be honest with how stressful this has become and how much it hurts to have folks get so upset on what’s supposed to be focused on you and your fiancé’s desire to celebrate your love with those you care about and WANT to celebrate with. Let them know you want to have love and support around and not the drama so you and fiancé don’t have to consider eloping. Hope eyes will be opened. Wishing you all the best of luck!"

TrueOffMyChest,fft8bb6,t3_euyfhs,1580211967.0,"Seriously, kudos to you for taking on the job and helping people in some of their darkest hours. I would have a hard time not getting emotional and attached so I think you’re pretty darn amazing! 

I know it’s not much, but stay focused on the good you do bring and what you can control. You may not be able to keep someone from getting hurt or going into a mental state of shock, but you can try to give them the best care possible until more help can arrive.  Your calm, reassuring voice in a storm of chaos is priceless. Apart of your job or not, you’re an angel. Thank you for all that you do!"
TrueOffMyChest,fft6ppe,t3_eutdfu,1580209929.0,"Like others have said, each of us like what we like, and want to see the things we do like, to do well. We get excited when our favorite artists, actors etc. win things, and it would be natural that people get sad or upset when their favorite people don’t.  Some take it more seriously than others and that’s ok too, so long as it’s healthy and not hurting others. 

I also think people can make connections and feel passionate in several other ways that doesn’t necessarily require you to have know or be directly involved with someone or something.  You could be passionate for what the person or thing represents (yeah more women getting recognition, yes finally we have more Asian actors being honored, ), or have empathy for someone who may have similarities or experienced things as you have (you worked your butt off at work but didn’t get a promotion or award, like Ariana, etc.).

For example, I have been really taken back by the loss of Kobe Bryant and his daughter.  I have no ties to him whatsoever but his passing has been completely devastating to me and I have definitely shed a lot of tears since learning of his passing. As crazy as it sounds to cry over someone I didn’t know, it’s all because I can relate to who he was as a person and feel empathy.  I don’t want anyone to die, especially so young. Kobe and I are close in age and the thought of myself dying this soon in my life as he did makes me realize how even more I want to love and spend time with my family.  I feel sad that his wife and kids won’t have more time with him. I’m also a parent and the idea of ever losing one of my children makes me feel absolutely heart broken ... I honestly don’t know if I would recover from something like that and hope that his wife can be strong for their remaining daughters. Like Kobe has, I too volunteer and help in my community and to not be there would make me feel sad for those who rely on me to help out. I worry who will operate and carry on Kobe’s legacy and if his basketball camps and schools will still be available in the future. As a fan, I watched him grow up on tv and cheered him on with my own friends and family, as we made gatherings and memories in watching him score 81 points on the Raptors  and his final 60 points on his last ever game. I really admired his work ethic and his drive.  So yes, while he had nothing to do with me whatsoever,  I have become emotional in his passing because I can relate to and sympathize with him as a person. We shared commonalities and I have admired his values as a hard worker and parent. Sometimes connections come in different forms and can be really strong."
KobeBryant24,fft2qyb,t3_euo3j3,1580203940.0,"I’m right there with you. Watching all the past tributes and interviews has been bittersweet because the memories bring smiles but they also bring back the shock of how quickly it’s all happened and how so freaking young he was. I feel so sad over the loss of what all he could have been or brought to the world.  Same with his daughter. My heart aches for all those that were lost in that helicopter too ... it just, for a lack of better words, SUCKS. 

My brain hasn’t caught up. I see him on tv and think  “Hey, it was just a bad dream! See! He’s talking to Jimmy Kimmel right now!” I can’t help but breakdown as soon as the reality hits that no, it wasn’t really him, but the past him. He’s really just .... GONE. 

For my own sake of sanity I’ve literally had to turn off the tv several times just to get a break, to be able to breathe and let my poor eyes rest. If those of you out there are struggling too, know it’s ok to turn it off or to focus on something else for a little while. Take care of yourself. Kobe would understand. You’re not less of a fan for it. 

And although I’m sad right now, I have no doubt that he would want all of us as his fans and even the non fans (who hopefully at least respect him for his work ethic and dedication to fatherhood), to persevere and bring our best to our own “court” of life.  When I’m done grieving, I’ll honor him in my own way. I’ll make sure I continue to love the heck out of my kids and husband knowing that time isn’t our right but a gift. I’ll continue to be kind to others and reach out even more.  When I help out in my community, people are going to know it’s not because I want to make a good impression but because I want to help and because I care. Honor him in your own way and know you’re not alone."
nextfuckinglevel,fft0125,t3_euwugc,1580199898.0,I think the folks in r/KobeBryant24 would like this
MazdaCX9,ffsvx9a,t1_ffsjxb9,1580194616.0,"It was a little over 43k. Got a slight discount for being a previous Mazda owner (had to prove by submitting previous registration info), and dealership we went to knew we had contacted other dealerships and said they would beat them.  Had to prove via email."

My serious side: Kudos to the military group and their flawless discipline and performance!"
MazdaCX9,ffs7g1h,t3_eur73l,1580175002.0,"Just got my 2020 CX-9 Grand Touring AWD this past December and have been extremely happy with it so far. Was considering a Honda Pilot and a 2020 Toyota Highlander but ultimately got every feature I wanted without Toyota’s crazy and overpriced trim levels, and the less than stellar performance and boxy/outdated exterior & interior of the Pilot. Super happy with my decision!

Hands down what sold me:
- the high safety ratings (we have kids)
- ranked highly in the overall low maintenance category (we looked into many other brands like Volvo, Acura, Lexus, Kia, VW, too but these brands tend to be expensive overall for lifetime maintenance and parts)
- the test drive: has amazing get up and go and lots of bells and whistle that help you feel truly safe in the car, SO fun to drive!
- previous Mazda owner (replaced ours because of a car accident ... none of us were hurt either and it was very serious!)
- 2020 has Apple CarPlay and I love how integrated and hands free it truly is
- Legroom in the 3rd row is actually decent. Had my teenager in the back who is 5’ 5” and hubby who is 6’ and they fit comfortably when the middle seats were pulled up a bit. A little tight on headroom for husband but he will be sitting mostly in the front and middle seats. Good enough legroom in the 3rd row for smaller road trips of 2-3 hours and under, probably ok for longer road trips with smaller kids but keep in mind there are no vents back there. 
- Decent cargo space and versatility in arranging /folding down the seats to gain more cargo space, seats are easy to fold down. Button to fold down seats easily on the Grand Touring model. 

Some FYI’s:

- We have the black leather interior. The interior is pretty dark, especially at night. I’m considering finding some aftermarket options to light it up a bit more. Mazda’s options are a little too expensive in my opinion without much light output. Wish that the sunroof had been panoramic like in the 2020 Highlander to help more with this.

- We got the bench seat for the middle row instead of captain’s chairs and I’m really happy with the choice. Still looks really nice in the Grand Touring trim too. The bench is a nice choice if you have a 3rd person to seat but don’t necessarily want to always have to fold out the 3rd row. 

Kids really like the bench seat too. We had captain’s chairs in our previous Mazda but the kids were always falling out of them when sleeping on longer road trips. Fold down middle partition has USB hookups, cup holders, and a bit of storage for devices. Kids also LOVE that the bench seat is heated too (only front seats are heated and vented on grand touring). If you choose the captains chairs for the middle row they are also heated on the Grand Touring model.

ALL THAT SAID: 

Lots of great YouTube videos out there (we watched HOURS and HOURS of them) that gave lots of great info too. Not a lot of good ones on the 2020 models yet as it’s still pretty new so consider watching the 2019. Some reviews from a couple of our YouTube favorite channels:
