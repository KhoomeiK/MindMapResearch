Trying to explain how to use email was sheer torture (‘but who picks up all these messages and delivers them?’). My brother bought her a cell phone but didn’t bother to program it for her so she mailed it to me to ‘fix it’.  Eventually I printed, laminated and taped her password and all the phone numbers to the back of her phone. We mailed that phone back and forth for a month before she felt comfortable using it. God I miss her."

AskReddit,femrr7q,t1_femk9rw,1579267729.0,"Confused here. Seems that you’re saying the meat industry is unethical for killing the animal for human consumption, is that right? 

Yet massive farms use production processes that yield maximum crops while destroying the naturally occurring enzymes and bacteria which depletes the soil for future use as well as contributing to toxic chemical run off into our streams, rivers, and lakes that make up the water supply for humans and other life forms. Do you consider that to be unethical as well?"
