What do you think about road blocks? *
What are your thoughts on Hezbollah? *
What are your thoughts on Hezbollah's weapons? *

My answers would be (respectively):
.I support road blocks only infront of government buildings/ politician's houses.
.I don't support them either way but they have the right to be a political party.
.The weapons came about for valid reasons (mainly to free the south of Lebanon from Israeli invasion when the government didn't do anything), and there should be an agreement between Hezbollah and the (new independent) government whereby they gradually give up there weapons OR where they become an official part of the Lebanese army.

The last one is a mouthful. That's why an ""other"" option would have been good.
