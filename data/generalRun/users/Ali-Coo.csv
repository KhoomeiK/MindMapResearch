That being said I spent half my life doing that boring job and I hated every minute of it.  It’s not easy to do but there are jobs out there that are not boring that don’t need a college education and allows you a certain comfort in life.
Being as your still in HS go to a counselor and express your fears and maybe they can hook you up with an apprenticeship program that will give you a skill and a decent job.  A job that you won’t hate and doesn’t suck the life out of you."

But your arguments for listening to this guy is well nefarious at best. This is what Amazon says about the author.

About the Author
Bruce Cannon Gibney is the author of A Generation of Sociopaths: How the Baby Boomers Betrayed America. A venture capitalist and writer, Gibney began as an attorney specializing in securities litigation and financial regulation. He was an early investor in PayPal, and later joined Founders Fund and co-founded Carmenta Management. He and his colleagues have funded Facebook, Spotify, Palantir Technologies, SpaceX, Lyft, AirBnB, Coupang, and DeepMind.

Ok this is my read on this guy, first he was a lawyer specializing in thwarting the rules and regulations.  Then decided like the billionaire bunch to get into venture capitalism.  Boy what a knowledgeable and unbiased individual.  
I would say if this author is a baby boomer then he is the reason boomers get bashed.

Look I get it.  It’s easy to blame the generation before your own.  And each generation does some pretty stupid shit.  But to blame one generation over another is just wrong and stupid.    Boomers didn’t really come into power until the 90’s and I can tell you things were pretty shitty in the decades before.
As a boomer who did not follow the crowd there are some things about my generation I can be proud of and a lot that’s disgraceful.  
I would say it’s different institutions that have destroyed us and not a generation.  
When you have a corrupt media, and a corrupt political system, things are going to go bad."

I always tried for a government job as most give you the option to pull your retirement before completing five years.  So I’d work two, three years then quit take what little money I had and travel on the cheap. I did this four or five times.
Then I found the lazy mans job, which allowed me lots of free time and a good salary.  What? What? Ok it’s Process Serving.  You get paid by the serve plus miles and the hardest part of the job is ringing a door knob."
