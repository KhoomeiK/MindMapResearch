Like I said the issue is with conglomerates, and the power they wield purely for their own self-interests.  They're the ones who've pushed planned obsolesce to the extreme, and IMO a big reason why customers are making worse, less informed purchasing decisions (ie they no longer trust the brand/value of American companies).  


Also making a product cheaper isn't inherently moral theft (ie the opposite is true with pharmaceutical companies).  Also this example doesn't affect the environment, I think it's a separate topic all together how eastern Asia (Africa too) is a shithole when it comes to pollution and waste management."

Can you give just a single real world example of a 'Doohickey' that's manufactured locally vs overseas that supports your claims?  The issue I believe you're alluding to is that conglomerates are purely driven by profit nowadays, and will happily exploit the uneducated or oppressed if it means they'll make some extra $$.  (ie Nike's infamous sweatshops)  Everything you buy is directly proportionate to how much people are willing to work for (simple supply & demand)- in places with lower costs of living the prices will go down.

All that being said I dislike Bezos, and think he's an awful human being.  Amazon's model is also just a complete ripoff- they charge $1 + 25% of every product people sell on their site.  Eventually there'll be an open-source digital trading platform, but until then we're stuck w Amazon unfortunately."

Lets not forget it was the gov who pushed the food pyramid, and is generally wrong about 50% of the time (politicians generally aren't the brightest nor are they motivated by truth or real results either- they just want to maintain their job/public perception).  All these 'Sin' taxes do are widen the divide between poor and rich- the poor are forced to find loopholes/alternatives and the wealthy can do whatever the fuck they want (though they generally commit 'Sins' significantly less often).


Why does the BBC (a gov media org) let alcohol companies even advertise (or any unhealthy drink/food products- ie Coke for that matter)?  Perception is far more impactful than price (and it doesn't have the same socio-economic ramifications either).


All that aside the specifics of this case are extremely disturbing; all the soda companies did were swap out sugar for aspartame (ie splenda, the carcinogenic chemical used in most diet drinks in the US)- their sales actually increased...  For those that don't know aspartame is drastically worse for you than sugar (like I said its carcinogenic, leads to more weight gain than sugar (basically the whole reason for this tax), destroys your gut fauna, alzheimers, etc).  The UK gov has accomplished exactly what they wanted- they changed public perception enough to consider this a win (so they can get reelected), all while making people more unhealthy- thus more dependent on them."

I hate people who rag on about the sugar tax, it's so fucking stupid; politicians get up on their high horse and implement a tax that will affect the poor disproportionately without even addressing the core issue.  If you truly cared, they'd help change public perception around fast-food/sugar and healthy eating, but no you still push crap like the food pyramid (the BBC takes advertising dollars from Coke & McDonalds... do you really expect them to tell the truth?).  Get your house in order before you tell me what to do, especially if its the British gov (which has done literally fuck all since the Brexit referendum, other than swap out PM's from the same party 3 times).

1.  [All of the 'facts' these reporters are using originate from this article from 2017](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/03/13/donald-trumps-worst-deal)


2.  The claim is that Trump purposely got involved and profited off a corrupt business deal in Azerbaijan.


3. The crux of their accusations are that 'It’s a problem if you’re making a profit off of someone else’s corrupt conduct.'  This is 100% true, the issue is it's extremely difficult to prove this foreknowledge in court- but let's look at their facts.

4. The Trump Org was contracted to license their name, and help improve the interior of a poorly planned/designed hotel in Azerbaijan.  The specifics of the contract are not public- though a local lawyer claims to have the details.


5. The 'proof' of corruption are Wikileaks cables where in the intel report a comment was added that accused Ziya Mammedov (the transport minister) of corruption (without any substantial proof- I'd still bet its true though).  Funny thing is these cables were sent directly to the state dept (and CIA + others) in 2009 and released by WL a couple years later.

6.  You can't claim Assange/WL is a terrorist organisation who publishes propaganda, and then in your next story use it as factual evidence when it fits your narrative.


7.  Nothing will ever come of this, it's a hit piece pure and simple- this will never see a courtroom.  That being said it falls into the grey area at worst IMO, as I think its unlikely that they were aware of these obscure cables published by Wikileaks.


I came across something very shocking when doing research on this though- I think I found Obama's puppet master.  Obama and a sr Republican senator named Lugar visited Ukraine, Russia and Azerbaijan (among other eastern european countries) to 'inspect weapons facilities' back in 2006.  Here are a few points, as this article is absolute gold (and has been scrubbed from the internet)- http://archive.is/lZ08x


1. Richard Lugar was an old (corrupt) RINO senator who had a failed run at president, but supported Obama's run and mentored him on this 'anti-corruption' trip he went on every year!

2.   The inflation rates are weird in Azerbaijan- especially when you match up the dates to their trip (and other world events/leaders): https://imgur.com/a/6XKgMp4

3. Fucking unbelievable quote: 'In Kiev, they visited a pathogen laboratory, an **unsecured** nondescript downtown building, where the senators were shown a storage unit resembling a mini-refrigerator that contained vast rows of test tubes. Some tubes held anthrax; others, the plague.'  How the fuck could a lab like that be unsecured???!!  

4. Russia tried to search their plane, to which Obama & Lugar refused creating a minor diplomatic incident.  I have no clue why they were in Perm, Russia (middle of fucking nowhere in Siberia).  Lugar was quoted as saying: ""it makes you wonder who really is running the country"" in response to this incident which is an odd thing to say all things considered.

5. Quote: 'Most important, though, may have been the timing of the senators' visit to Ukraine and Azerbaijan. Russia had chosen that moment to escalate a dispute with Ukraine over national gas by cutting off the pipeline that supplies Russian gas to Ukraine and Germany, threatening the economy of much of Western Europe. Meanwhile Azerbaijan's economy was set to go on steroids with the completion of its own gas pipeline to the West. The trip focused Obama's attention on the tight link between energy resources and national security'
  During their trip, Russia cut oil off to Ukraine/Germany and opened a brand new pipeline from Azerbaijan to eastern Europe.  Reminds me of the Syrian proxy war caused by competing pipelines.

Haha, sounds like you need to get a prescription for it then :P

In all seriousness though, I know it used to be sold in pharmacies (as a cure to ADHD among other things), but its not really still prescribed in the US is it? (obv amphetamines are, but not meth specifically- right?)"

Are you seriously claiming that doctors were unaware of ADHD in 2003?  I can understand that argument for the 1960's before proper research was conducted/published, but I think its hard to argue in this millennia.  It's also a completely subjective diagnosis, so that doesn't help either- https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2993524/"

ADHD is also way over-diagnosed, 43% increase since 2003 is absolutely crazy (If you compare it to ~50 years ago I'd bet it's 1000x increase).  I'm not saying ADHD doesn't exist, only the current methodology used to diagnose is inherently flawed and gives way too many false positives based on completely subjective assessments.

If you're the expert, why has there been a 43% increase in ADHD since 2003 (to 2011)?  It couldn't be pharmaceutical companies are pushing it, and just trying to make a profit (like with opioids); that would be unethical, right?"

Adderall is a terrible drug that bears a chemical resemblance to meth- please don't give it to your kid (the alternatives are all basically as bad).  Nutrition is key, while I doubt his activity is explainable by a lack of metals, I'd be willing to bet that its more likely a symptom of overeating (particularly processed sugars & carbs).  I'd highly recommend researching intermittent fasting, its a simple thing to try that might produce some significant results (it's cured my 'ADHD').
