DungeonsAndDragons,ffadraa,t1_ffa3tfg,1579733179.0,"A few years ago a lady posted a story about how in the early 2000's in the south, she was getting a divorce. in the process she was talking to her lawyer and they were going over accusations of her ex that she went out partying and was of poor morals or something. She told her lawyer that she only went out one night a week and it was to play D&D.

Her lawyer was a god fearing church goer who had only ever heard of D&D from the satanic panic. her immediate response to hearing that her client was in a D&D group was, ""Oh my God, you haven't hurt anyone yet have you?""

It took the lady the rest of the session to explain that people who play D&D do not do human sacrifices and speak to the devil. She even had to bring in recorded sessions of her friends and her playing before the lawyer was comfortable moving on."
DungeonsAndDragons,ff9ngiu,t1_ff9ixmz,1579716671.0,I like that story of the lady who told her divorce lawyer that she played D&D and the lawyer thought she and her group were performing human sacrifices.

AskReddit,femv169,t3_epxprc,1579270354.0,I think the whole bit about the ethical treatment of elves could have been a way in. I mean obviously the hufflepuffs have a secret connection to the kitchens for midnight snacks from their common room.
WhiskeyTribe,femp81g,t1_felsrus,1579265453.0,"Do you store them in a cabinet that doesn't let light in, or does it have a window and/or are they out in the open? If you take your time drinking those whiskeys leaving them in the box may be a good call to protect them from light, and will keep them tasting great for a long time."

ElizabethWarren,fehgeie,t1_feg5zox,1579115999.0,now they are trying to get #neverwarren to trend so they can say there is a big fight between supporters. I've really disliked the shadiness of CNN's editorial lately.

It was the 40th submitted Water Displacement and anti corrosion chemical for use on the Atlas platform. the inventors found out that some military guys were using it as a quick spray lubricant on different things and went on to market it as a household item as well."

illinois,fedc1f2,t3_eok1lb,1579007156.0,"I'm really interested to see what the overall effects of the reinvestment into the poorest, and hardest hit communities will be. with legalization taking out low level criminal enterprise introduction, and hopefully more access to economic relief and opportunity in these communities, will crime rates drop?

if crime rates fall, will the savings on enforcement and prosecution, offset the cost of the program?"
politics,feadgwu,t1_feacs2j,1578947311.0,I was going to say I can see how this whole part of the conversation would be taken out of context. a frank conversation about the difficulties she will face for her gender and the kinds of attacks that trump would levy against her.
