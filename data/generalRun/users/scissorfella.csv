HistoryPorn,fghshyf,t1_fghbtuj,1580792590.0,I got a biopsy on my scalp once. About 5mm diameter (pretty big in my mind and super gross to think about).

atheism,fghp46i,t3_eyc8et,1580790055.0,"I think it's important for people to feel like they have that support. Whether it be from a community feeling or the feeling that god has their back.

My dad is a great example. He is in his mid sixties and grew up in a home where they didn't communicate effectively about problems and resolutions. He studied law and I only ever saw him approach problems from that perspective.

Since I've gotten a little older, I've noticed that his does have an empathetic side, but it's mainly from what he learned in his experience with the church. When my mum left him, I moved in to look after him a bit. I heard his nightmares and saw him being more emotional. He finally got some counselling and gained more skills in talking about feelings.

He is a highly educated man who sees a counsellor and has a loving family around him. But his chosen social interaction is through the church. I think having a belief in god really made a difference for him after the trauma of mum leaving. I'm really glad that, at least in his case, he's still around because of his beliefs."
Eyebleach,fghmsva,t1_fghda5a,1580788425.0,"Just in case anyone is considering adopting a kitten this young, you should make sure there is no way the mother can't care for it for longer (i.e. mother is really sick or not around).

Kittens need to stay with their mother and siblings to develop properly. Adopting a kitten too young will directly impact your relationship with them. They may beg for food and not be satiated, not learn how to play properly, not use a litter box correctly or not be able to sleep in a healthy cycle.  Cats are incredibly sensitive to stress. 

That being said, if you're near a nest of kittens and the mother learns to trust you, you pick up those tiny critters and cuddle the shit out of them."

My worst flares were always worse than the prep anyway, cause of the pain. But prepping for an MRI of small intestine was the WORST.

If you eat what they tell you in the days leading up to it, it helps (less fibre ideally) but I've also not stuck to that advice and been okay.

languagelearning,ffhf1pa,t3_etmpgy,1579932541.0,"I'm learning Dutch and my speaking is very close to fluent. I have to admit my spelling is still questionable and my grammar has mistakes but I'm getting there.

I started a sort of lazy learning three years ago when I met my partner, just a word here or there and playing games with her in slow, broken Dutch.  Then I amped it up a lot about eighteen months ago when we migrated. 

The hardest part is those weeks where your brain is doing a Big Reboot and somehow all my Dutch feels ages behind. I have trouble understanding and talking. Then, after a few days, I realise it's back to normal and even better than before.

I have a musical ear and love imitating people, so I use little phrases from the region I'm in that make me sound more like a local. I go to the library for conversation groups sometimes and get compliments on that, which is nice.

I spoke English first, then learned German in school and I think that helped. Also, since we moved, I really pushed myself to learn as best I could. I got a job in a Dutch chocolate shop, I read a little Dutch every day, watch some nice tv or movies or listen to podcasts in Dutch. Even if the bulk of my media is in English, I consume a little bit in Dutch every day.

While I'm not perfect and if I wrote a document without spellcheck, I'd be concerned, I think my Dutch is doing well now. It took about three years to get to this level (b2 speaking and reading, B1 listening and writing). But I had a lot of advantages that not everyone has.

Good luck on your learning endeavour and I'm sorry for the long message!"

relationship_advice,fe6ok0s,t3_enmw2v,1578898261.0,"Late to the game here. OP, I dated a girl a few years ago who wouldn't let me sleep. It sounds ridiculous now. I was working long hours across a few jobs and living with my girlfriend who was unemployed. She had a lot of spare time and some serious mental health issues. That meant that every night of my seven day work week, she would want to spend time together (understandably) but doing passive things like watching TV. When I started to fall asleep, she would wake me and say, ""I get lonely when you're asleep."" It made me sad for her. I knew she was depressed and angry. I wanted to help. So for a while there (according to my old health journals from gym), I was sleeping between 3-5 hours a night.

First of all, that's not enough sleep. To make good decisions and understand that someone's behaviour isn't normal, you need more.

Secondly, I did not have the resources to help her. I'm a waiter, not a mental health specialist. The best I could do was force her to go for walks to the nearby dog park or come for a run.

Thirdly, I realise now that I let it go on too long. I thought she was the one. I didn't realise that a healthy relationship means outsourcing when you're struggling. You can't rely solely on your partner, because sometimes they have shit going on too. Call a mate, get counselling, whatever. But I didn't know that so i spent a long time being unhappy without realising completely. In the end she dumped me, though she stuck around for a while because she still needed me. When I tried to pull away because I was still hurting, she abused me emotionally and threatened self harm. She lashed out by going on benders and not contacting anyone. She finally moved back in with her mum and when I told her I needed some space before I could see her as friends, she had one big final fit and left me to pick up the pieces.

I'm in a functional relationship now. I'm happy. We talk. When there is a problem, we discuss and when there is a fight, we give each other space. I sleep enough, I'm a whole new person for it. I can work out better, think better and learn better.

I have bad dreams about that ex sometimes and it has coloured that whole period of time for me because I didn't realise how negative the whole situation was.

Life is hard enough. Do yourself a kindness and take care of yourself first. Best advice I ever heard (and sorry for sounding like a prattling hippy) was ""fill your cup first so you can let it overflow for others""."
