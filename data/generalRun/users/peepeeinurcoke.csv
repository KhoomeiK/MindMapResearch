BlackPeopleTwitter,fes3xqn,t3_eqfcpz,1579361136.0,Caleb bought into the narrative that a college degree was a solid path to success. Caleb is now slinging coffee and dropping fun facts on customers while his student loan debt steadily grows well out of his control.
AskReddit,fe373m8,t1_fe1c02e,1578846557.0,Same story for me. Dad lived alone went down the stairs. Head split open on a door hinge he crawled around and up the walls as he bleed out.  I went home after the neighbor found him and called a cleanup crew.  They wanted outrageous money to clean the floors walls ect.  I spent about 300 bucks in peroxide and bleach and another 300 bucks in scotch.  I stayed wasted drunk for 3 days cleaning that up.
cursedcomments,fda0l53,t3_ekcbck,1578240342.0,I never could understand the downright heartless act of these military wives sending these pictures and videos.  I guess the only consolation is you dodge a bullet deployed and you dodge a bullet at home.

TrueOffMyChest,fd9vbtt,t3_ekad1u,1578238453.0,I have worked an known many Iranians that fled Iran in the 70's and 80's.  That takeover destroyed a thriving economy and culture and relegated the people to a life of religious micro-managed shit.
teenagers,fd9uc4j,t3_ekae2y,1578238144.0,Australia and California should worry more about forest management then preserving wildlife habitats. Indonesia flooding? Flooding has occured all the time since the dawn of time. Iran is a shit hole since they deposed the Shah in 1977 and they got more coming to them if they keep jacking around. Your dog I can sympathize with but it was old. You have a long life ahead and life is not fair.

LateStageCapitalism,fcrtqoy,t1_fcrrz8s,1577906500.0,No I get it.  Reddit is entertaining in its irony. I was not trying to be critical of the post. Sorry if it came off like that.

houston,fcnohjm,t3_ei5we8,1577815393.0,"You need to go sit in an autozone parking lot and read the owners manual to fix half that crap yourself for about 20.00.  The tie rod ends ok take it to an alignment shop and get an estimate.  Power steering Flush? Is the fluid level low? Read the manual then top it off if necessary and save yourself 140.00 buy skipping an up sell flush. Battery service? Buy a box of baking soda and watch a youtube video on how to clean the terminals. Saved 40 bones. AC compressor and full service nope. Take it anyplace other than the stealership.  Cooling system? again watch a youtube video. That system flush will cost you 35.00 in new coolant and thirty mins with a garden hose. Belt change is critical but with simple hand tools and the owners manual you can do it for about 35.00.  Hood shocks are about right on price but you never look in the hood so why do you need them? Worst case use a broom handle and prop it up. 
mount and balance tires? Not unless its vibrating or you can feel a problem.  If so the alignment shop will tell you you need that and might do it for free as part of the service. Here is a hint. You can buy a new set of tires for the 500.00 they want with free mount and balance."
houston,fcnm27i,t3_ei55td,1577814077.0,It's the most technically advanced car in the world! too bad there is no established parts supply chain or effective dealer service.
houston,fcnjtl7,t1_fcmw1c0,1577813024.0,Why go to the added expense and frustration? If it were me I'd just say screw it and throw my hands up. When these shit heels get to be too problematic it's time to pack it in to keep ones sanity.
Libertarian,fcn9qgy,t1_fcn3z0p,1577806866.0,In many south american countries where they have been outlawed there are cottage shops that manufacture firearms and sell them illegally.  Guns are simple tools and anybody with a small amount of mechanic ability and common sense can simply manufacture crude and effective examples from scrap metal.
