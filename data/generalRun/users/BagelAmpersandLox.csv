They force you to breath on minimal settings (minimals is harder than regular breathing because of the reduced diameter of the breathing tube). Sometimes they even disconnect the breathing tube from the machine and attach wall oxygen to it. If you are capable of doing this for a couple hours without serious signs of fatigue, they hook you back up to the vent for a while to let you rest and then pull the tube. 

There are also numerous setting that force the patient to be responsible for increasingly more work-of-breathing. Some ventilators can even use an algorithm to assess the patients WOB compared to before and either help them more or less. An analysis can then be run on that info to determine whether the patients inspiratory muscles are getting stronger. It’s pretty cool stuff."

Drugs for life threatening diseases are allowed to be marketed while still in Stage II clinical trials. If there is a drug intended to treat a rapidly growing type of highly lethal cancer, then yes, they will allow it to go to market earlier. The worst that will happen is it will kill someone who was going to die soon anyways.

Drugs for serious diseases are allowed to be marketing while still in Stage III clinical trials. This is for the same reasons as above, however to a lesser extent.

We’ve reached a point where many of the non-imminently-life-threatening diseases have tried and true drugs available to treat them. You can only come out with so many beta blockers and statins, especially considering, when used as directed, these drugs are very safe. 

Therefore, as drug development progresses, the number of drugs being developed that are used to treat serious or life threatening diseases, and therefore qualify for early marketing, will increase.

The statistics in that article are definitely not because of an an “evil big pharma” phenomenon. Don’t get me wrong, big pharma is evil, and the profit they make is disgusting, but there are just so many more factors in this instance."

Also, no.

The reason is because the dude had an inaccurate thermometer and that standard has been wrong all along. 

Believing what you read on “medicinenet.com” is a half-step above citing Buzzfeed.

Dr. Julie Parsonnet is an attention whore who clearly has no credibility. Population health has been DECREASING. Nearly 10% of US adults have type II diabetes. 30 MILLION ADULT AMERICANS HAVE A DISEASE THAT CAN RESULT IN KIDNEY FAILURE AND AMPUTATION. 40% OF THE POPULATION OF THE UNITED STATES IS OBESE. 

While we may no longer be dying from vaccine-preventable diseases or diseases caused by poor hygiene and sanitation, death by chronic disease is at an all time high. 

Anybody who believes these are metrics of improved health is grossly misinformed. Unfortunately, that seems to be the standard these days.

For real tho: don’t pigeonhole yourself into something immediately. Get a good pre-med-type education (read: get good grades) in undergrad and during that time shadow as many health care professionals as you can.

They crushed like 6 bottles of wine between the two of them while Palpatine was rehearsing his acceptance speech for being elected Chancellor and Plagueis was like “Na man I’m done I’m wasted” and palpatine was like “lemme recite it from the beginning oooone more time” and Plagueis was like “ok fine” and palpatine was like “but also have some more wine” and then dude passed out and palpatine force lightninged his ass.
