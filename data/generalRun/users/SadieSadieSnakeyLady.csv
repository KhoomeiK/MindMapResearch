But she's only been doing that 2 years and this has always been an issue. I had to put down my 15 years old cat this week, very suddenly and it was devastating. She came with me to the vet. Stayed in the car while my mother and I said our goodbyes to him and played Pokemon go the whole way home. Not once did I get any kind of comfort. That sealed it for me. I was going to wait until the end of March, but I'm doing it this week. This is the week I get out because I'm literally dying."
