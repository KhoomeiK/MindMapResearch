hearthstone,ffnsqfl,t3_etzz5g,1580070290.0,Poison/deathtouch has been a thing in several card games. You beat it with divine shield/first strike. It's balanced and should absolutely be in the game.
ChoosingBeggars,ffnh7uc,t1_ffncky2,1580065935.0,"This is a pretty specific scenario. Latin is a dead language. (I only had 3 other people in my Latin 1 class, and they took it for an easy credit.) Even with the names scribbled out, it’d be easy to believe this is the aunt. People have identifying writing/typing traits. I also imagine her nephew/niece isn’t the only relative she’s treated this way.

*If anyone has an opportunity to take a Latin class, do it. It’s a dead language, but it’s the root of all Romance languages. It will help you understand other languages more easily."

I'm inclined to agree with you. Our sweet pit caused a little girl to require stitches after she bit her leg while chasing after her bicycle tires. She definitely wasn't trying to hurt the girl. She just got too excited.

\*She was an alligator pit. Their bites are pretty vicious.\*\*I'm referring to her in the past tense because she's passed.

\*This is for the downvoters. I know this is late, but I know she wasn't going for the kid. She loved kids, especially babies. Bicycles just riled her up in a ""I gotta chase that and grab it"" sense, and she didn't understand the separation between the two. We would have trained her better had she not already been old by the time we literally rescued her from a kennel inside an abandoned home.

\*\*The girl is doing just fine now, and that sweet dog lived a full life instead of rotting in a shit-filled  kennel."

Seeing as you never saw the figure, you can't say you know it happened. Your friend saying it had a knife makes it sound like she was just fucking with you because you were already spooked. The wind could easily just be a draft in the sun room that you never noticed because you weren't sitting on the floor when a solid gust hit the outside of the house."
