Austin,ffrqr0k,t1_ffrnrs3,1580163729.0,"Your second side note reminds me of a fun anecdote. One of the most influential advertising professionals of all time, David Ogilvy, fucking **hated** billboards. He didn't think they were that effective as ads and considered them to be just an eyesore in general. A quote from him about it:  
> I have a passion for landscape, and I have never seen one improved by a billboard. Where every prospect pleases, man is at his vilest when he erects a billboard. When I retire from Madison Avenue, I am going to start a secret society of masked vigilantes who will travel around the world on silent motorbikes, chopping down posters at the dark of the moon. How many juries will convict us when we are caught in these acts of beneficent citizenship?"
