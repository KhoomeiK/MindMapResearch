The issue is when someone says ""x years anno domini"" is they are quite literally wrong. Why would you want people to be wrong?

I realized then that disassociatives and disassociative doses of psychedelics were not that fun for me. I have heard ketamine is a much kinder dissassociative, but I have not felt the need to try it.

I then went on a nice walk through my state's capital building to look at the art and architecture after I felt better."

>Why doesn't the present-imperfect work here? 

this is a cheating sentence, but is accepted as correct in everyday english. no one knows how contractions properly work, and sometimes ""doesn't"" can be used in places where ""does not"" would be split across the sentence.

the most correct would be
