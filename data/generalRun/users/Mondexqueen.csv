PublicFreakout,ffpqtaj,t1_ffoxljl,1580102459.0,That’s what I was thinking too..she’s definitely possessed and just hearing “Jesus” made her angrier and angrier.. and that screaming at the end sounded demonic..
PublicFreakout,ffpq53m,t1_ffpn60o,1580101834.0,Every time I hear that song I cry.. I can only imagine how beautiful you all sounded on the bus together.
PublicFreakout,ffppoys,t1_ffpnjg4,1580101421.0,Lol.. I thought he was giving her one..every time he said “Jesus” she would snarl the n-word. — then that demonic scream at the end was creepy..crazy bitch—
offmychest,ffp9m2s,t3_eucov4,1580089596.0,"I was waiting to see when things were going to start to take a bad turn but It didn’t. So that saying “Two’s a Company but Three’s a Crowd” isn’t always true. I’m glad everything worked out. I was totally expecting a negative story because that’s what we’re used to, I guess. But I’m glad you posted this, everyone got along and possibly you guys grown closer and not some affair happened, because I’ll admit I was really expecting it. That’s really wonderful that you opened up your home to a friend and a Soldier. I’m sure he felt awkward having to sleep on his friend’s couch. Anyone, well most would feel out of place or a nuisance. But it sounds like you three had a great time. Good for you, glad it worked out. We need to read more positive stories like this. The world is dark enough. Thanks for sharing."
vanderpumprules,ffp47gb,t1_ffne5cp,1580085819.0,I absolutely cannot stand Sandoval after last week’s episode. He definitely let that 5% ownership get to his head. He must have mentioned he was an owner 52 times last episode. Then when he talked shit about Schwartz and Katie keeping the furniture in their new house did it for me. What a douche.

OldSchoolCool,ffmszn3,t1_ffmez2l,1580058599.0,"I appreciate you taking the time to read about my grandmother. It definitely would sound like a good movie. It’s a big misconception that all Germans believed in Hitler’s ideology, definitely not the truth. A lot of Germans were put through Hell too. I didn’t even add that my grandma and her grandma were visited by a few Nazi soldiers looking for food, so they saw my grandmother’s beloved pet rabbit, they grabbed it out of its cage and slit its throat right in front of her while she’s begging them not to, her grandmother tried to stop them but they just slapped her to the ground. My grandma was so upset but glad her grandfather was not there because he would have been shot, he HATED Nazis. After that those assholes didn’t even take the rabbit, just left it. So sad. — thank you again for taking time to read and comment."
FloribamaShore,ffmi1ip,t1_ffloely,1580054980.0,Lol..it’s a mystery for sure.

OldSchoolCool,ffkhq5o,t1_ffk1e79,1580022948.0,"Thank you.. My grandma had a crazy life, she’s 83 and is in early stages of Dementia so my daughter has been recording her stories. One day we would like to put everything together, I wish I would have asked her questions many years ago while she remembered things but I know most of her WWII experiences were bad and hard to talk about. While she was staying with her maternal grandparents during the war and her mother was never around because she was helping Jews escape, so my grandmother’s grandparents took care of her and one day a bunch of Nazis pulled up at their house and separated her from her grandparents and she was placed in a Concentration Camp, I’m not sure her exact age but she was in a nasty holding type cell with other children, it was freezing and the fucking Nazis would feed them once a day, throwing stale bread at them to eat, well my grandma took in a little boy that was in there and watched over him, she said she took her food and saved it for him. She was in there awhile probably a few months. Well, one day she noticed a few Nazi cars drove up and they got her out and she said she wasn’t leaving without the boy, she literally held onto him and cried but obviously he couldn’t go. She still cries to this day about him. She was reunited with her grandparents and she barely recognized them, they were so so skinny and of course my grandmother wasn’t eating much because she snuck her food for the boy while the Nazi fucks weren’t looking. Because they couldn’t share food. Many years later she found out her father sent for them to be picked up, I’m sure some of those Nazi fucks were “dealt with”. She was a SS Colonel’s daughter. She believes that neighbors ratted them out for helping Jews escape. And that’s why they were thrown in there. She has scars on her hands from Nazi nuns while in school, her grandfather actually went to the school, to confront the nuns which was like a huge “no no” but those nuns never laid another hand on her. She believes because of who her father was. She remembers playing in the street with her best friend that was Jewish and she had to wear the Star of David. Well my grandma wanted one too, so she pinned it on her dress and all she remembers was looking up and seeing her grandfather running up as fast as he could to her and when he finally reached her he was screaming at her “take that off, you cannot wear that”! And she said she never saw her grandfather in such a panic, he was almost in tears. And she just told him that she wanted one too because her friend had one. My grandma has a damaged ear drum from hitting the ceiling while a bomb dropped, she said her grandfather jumped on her while she was on a mattress to protect her when the bomb’s after effect ( I don’t know the correct terminology)  but like the aftershock, he used his body as a shield but she did bust her eardrum. She said that the Americans were bombing in the morning and the British were bombing at night. —- she was given chocolate by an American soldier although she was told never to accept candy from an American it’s poisoned. She said that soldier even broke off a piece and ate it because he was aware of the rumors. When she left Germany and married the American ( Army helicopter pilot) which the CIA questioned her before coming to the U.S because of her father. Thank you for reading all this if you did. There is way more interesting stories about her and you’re not the only person that recommended I should write a book about her, especially before her Dementia worsens. Thank you for listening."
TheRanch,ffjwim3,t1_ffgb1cg,1580008875.0,Same..we just finished it today and I’m definitely going to miss Sam Elliot.. “what happened did your Chevy mouth off to a Ford”.. hahaha!
