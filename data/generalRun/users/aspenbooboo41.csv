dogs,ff9uaw7,t3_es88yi,1579721493.0,"Your feelings and concerns do not seem ridiculous or dramatic, but rather thoughtful, responsible, and caring.  

I was in the same exact position with my last dog.  I really did want to get another dog, and as my dog got older friends and family would try to encourage me ""you should get another dog so you aren't alone when Shasta goes"" (they meant well).  However,  she had been with me, and only me, from 4 months old, and although never aggressive or anything, she never really did care too much for other dogs beyond a sniff hello and goodbye.   I just knew in my heart that it would not be fair to my girl to make her spend the last few years of her life having to change and/or adapt to another dog's presence and deal with losing my  sole and complete attention.   It would've been different if she were a younger dog, and may have enjoyed the companionship, but I knew that wouldn't be the case.  I don't regret my decision and I know I did right by my girl by not getting another dog.

I applaud your desire to rescue a dog and support that decision wholeheartedly.  However it may be something to consider in this situation that you would most likely be introducing a dog of largely uncertain background and experiences into the mix with your ""only child"", and who knows how that would turn out."

This is the best advice.   You never know what someone is going through, there may be a legit reason someone is not smiling or perhaps even frowning.    If everyone just minded their own business about everything we all would be a little better off.  I never offer my unsolicited advice, criticisms, or opinions ...it's just rude."
fatlogic,ff97lo9,t3_ergk3j,1579706710.0,"As a person that has been a size 2 or 4 my entire life up until recently, I can guarantee you that it is bullshit that ""skinny"" sized clothes are always easier to find.  I am now a 6 and can ALWAYS find pants in that size, whereas finding a size 2 or 4  was always much, much less likely.  I am speaking from a good 30 years of experience.  Small sizes go faster because the stores buy less of them, period.  Unless you're talking about size 0, which I agree pretty much never sells out."
fatlogic,ff96rjc,t1_ff5p76k,1579706168.0,"I get that one a lot and I've never understood because it's always at the most random times, by random strangers, for no justifiable reason.  Just the other day I was at the self-checkout scanning my groceries, not smiling or frowning, just using my normal ""concentrating on scanning my groceries"" face.   Some guy in the lane next to mine, which I was facing, turns around and leans over my machine and says ""You should smile"".  WTF?   Who the shit has a grin on their face when they are scanning their groceries?  And, who the shit gives you the right to tell me what I do with my own face?!"

I wouldn't do that to even a small dog that didn't know me and/or see me coming.  I mean, why the hell would you even want to hit an animal unless it was attacking you?

dogs,fehfxlc,t3_ep5jpm,1579115724.0,"Please trust the instinct you had when you made the appointment.  Have you re-read your post?  Even if you have, please read it again.  I think you'll see.  I do not mean this to sound harsh, but what you describe does not sound like a happy dog.  It is the absolute hardest thing to do, to say goodbye to your friend, but sometimes it is the greatest gift of love you can give them.

Today is the 1 year anniversary of my last goodbye with my girl Shasta, and honestly I've been brought to tears by your situation.  I had a lot of the same experiences with Shasta that you are having with Emily.  Then on this day last year, in the morning, she out of the blue had a siezure.  I thought she was dying, because it was that severe and she peed all over the place during it, but she didn't.   Combined with all the other issues, that was the moment knew it was time.  She just wasn't happy anymore and I could see it in her eyes and in everything she didn't/couldn't do anymore.  I couldn't let this dog that was my best friend ever and gave so much to me just linger on and being unhappy/uncomfortable.  

OF COURSE, to this day, I question whether it was too soon.  Heck, I still feel that way about my dog of 20 years ago.   But honestly I think that's normal, and I do absolutely know in my heart that I did the right thing for my both of my dogs no matter how much it hurt me.

I am so sorry you are going through this and I wish I could give you a big hug."

Your argument has nothing to do with either of my comments, nor does it have to do with ""my line of thinking"".  My line of thinking, and what I stated, was simply that people do not have to have 6 children.  That means ALL people.  Not just the smart ones, not just the rich ones, not just the dumb ones or the poor ones.  NOONE needs that many kids.  How my statement equates in your mind as something to do with ""propping up the weak"" I have no clue.  Your ""line of thinking"", from the tone of your comments about poor people and ""the weak"", is really not something I want to understand.  No offense, just not my style."
