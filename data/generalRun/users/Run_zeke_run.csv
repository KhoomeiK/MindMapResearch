You have to pay only cash and have to have paperwork on you showing a diagnosis from another Dr for an approved issue. Then you pay the state another couple hundred and wait a couple months for your card.

StPetersburgFL,fc8kksg,t1_fc7iwqv,1577536862.0,"Hmmm, so you're against asking for something for free if you don't frequent that place?  

Well judging by your post history you're a hypocrite. You've posted in all of these subs specifically looking for free advice and have never posted there again (some of this advice you would pay good money from a contractor or other expert for): 

List of subreddits posted once, asking for free contracting/construction, technology, and legal advice:

drone, premiere, video editing, location sound, cameras, cinematography, film makers, monitors, small business (really hope the guy got his unemployment you tried to fuck him out of), DIY, android questions, video surveillance, microbiology, Bitcoin, amateur radio, sql, Nikon, Photoshop

all of these posts are questions you have that you want answered for free that would save you money. 

Don't want to pay a contractor for filling in a new concrete floor? ask Reddit, don't want to pay a lawyer to get your cheap ass out of paying unemployment? ask Reddit. Trying to rig drones so they can spray pesticides in your constantly relocating food processing operation? ask Reddit. 

all of these, and more, would cost you more than a free birthday song and piece of cake. Bye Felicia."
