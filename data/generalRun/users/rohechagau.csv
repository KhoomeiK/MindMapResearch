FE_Exam,ff6x7n9,t3_erxwoc,1579636744.0,"I pretty much skipped structures  - especially anything regarding concrete.  I didn't want to study it but would happily study anything else.  I did the practice problems from the exam but that was about it.  When it came time for the exam, I took minimal time to skip all the structures problems, preferring to spend my time where I had a good chance.  I ended up feeling confident in 1/3rd questions, like I had a shot on another 1/3 and randomly guessed for the rest. I passed. 

It worked for me but I did study everything else.  I'd imagine you can get a fair amount of statistics.  I never took it in school but there were only a few question styles on the exam.  Try to know enough to know what the wrong answer is and narrow down your answers"
Hypermobility,ff3h9w4,t1_ff257ve,1579541003.0,I try to do core regularly but I'll add step it up this month. Thanks
Hypermobility,ff3h7u0,t1_ff2ca9t,1579540967.0,"Thanks. I tend to do non weighted squats on a bosu for stabilization and use the leg press for more controlled strength.  Hopefully paired up that'll work.  

I'll look into what I can find. I'm thinking just compression socks for my ankle or a sleeve for my knee would help with the proprioception aspect"
FE_Exam,fdnklu6,t1_fdn7ju3,1578587768.0,"I think a combo of both.  I never took a prob/statistics course but after a few hours studying I never missed a practice session.  I think that's what this strategy is about.  Maximize your time.  Instead of driving yourself crazy spending weeks on that one topic you could just never get, play to your strengths and the exam.  You should vs able to get econ, ethics and probability near 100 within a week. If there is a topic that just the thought of it makes you shudder and never want to study (for me structures) , look through the practice problems and on the exam itself save that section for last when you are the most worn out and stressed for time."
fatlogic,fdfrf9e,t1_fdfo3tn,1578368378.0,"I can't speak for everyone. I have never been overweight but before I met my bf he lost over 100 pounds. When I met him he was training for a marathon that he completed later that year. I had just moved and lost a lot of motivation but we now signed up for a half together. 

We'll still go out and eat a large meal and grab ice cream and whatever but also have each other for motivation. I have somebody to cheer me on on the good days and support me on the not so great days."
fatlogic,fczfeh2,t1_fcxai1b,1578100045.0,Plenty of us go haha. It is always worth it though when it's such an easy solution. Makes life just a bit better to get the small things taken care of
fatlogic,fcx9v5a,t1_fcx50ob,1578056775.0,"I'm actually on a medication for eczema that is weight based. I was reading the package and above a certain weight, dose is 50% higher."
Hypermobility,fcnz2ok,t3_ehwcjv,1577821180.0,"7 by age 22. Only 4 were hypermobility related.  Both my knees and my left shoulder twice.  It sucks but if you can get a good surgeon, quality of life can really improve.  I went from my shoulder dislocating practically daily to no dislocations for 2 years.  I can sleep without tieing my arm down and that's wonderful.

Follow through with physical therapy forever though.  I still do exercises for everything.  When I was on crutches always still moved around as much as possible and would go to the gym for arms.  After shoulder surgery stationary bikes were my go to"
illnessfakers,fc1weqm,t1_fc1uo2f,1577331782.0,All I know is I was always a silent follower and then accidentally responded to one of her polls. Think it was on how much you love her watch. That's all.  Blocked within 12 hours.
