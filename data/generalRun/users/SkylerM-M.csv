college,ffj25ej,t1_ffj209l,1579988494.0,I understand that a lot of novels contain biblical references and I'm prepared to handle those appropriately and maturely. I can even cite them from the King James Bible but she was being extra.

whole30,ffh8aj0,t3_etkxtt,1579925962.0,Drink some water with salt added for the electrolyte boost you might be used to from Gatorade. It'll help replenish you and make you feel a little less sluggish.
college,fff0a5y,t1_ffesv8j,1579872077.0,"How did you get such a good schedule to allow that? I'm in my final semester and this is the first time that I've been able to have all of my classes on just two days to give me the rest of the week to work. On top of that, my job is only open Monday-Friday."
whole30,fec3drg,t1_febsycf,1578966061.0,I totally second this. I love listening to a podcast or audiobook and just zoning out for a walk. I also play Pokemon Go which helps me walk more. That may not be your speed but find something (preferably that also doesn't involve shopping) that does make you happy. Maybe watch an old favourite movie or read a good book?
college,fec1thm,t3_eo5gcl,1578965405.0,"My sixth semester was actually the semester that changed me. That would be the end of junior year(?) it's the end of what we call third year. I learned how to learn, finally. And really became a student of my own right. I wanted to learn, to go to class, and to make connections with my professors. I think it's something you have to a ant, but I also think it comes with time."

TrentUniversity,fdoxk65,t3_em2a8t,1578615168.0,"If you're looking at Trent, they're pretty flexible about switching programs so you could always switch into that."

Staples,fdij0kr,t3_elgamu,1578443999.0,"There's no minimum, but if you've got a solid availability having less than one shift is alarming. At my store the less good associates that were close to being fired often got no shifts several week in a row."
college,fc3sz4m,t3_eg19jf,1577397845.0,"Treat it like a vacation. I'm honest with myself, if I don't know it by the start of the exam period, I probably won't be able to teach it to myself by the end. There's always time for practice and solidifying concepts, but I only let that take up a couple of hours a week. I work hard all semester and usually am able to pull off pretty good grades with little effort studying during the exam period because I am on top of things for the entire semester."
