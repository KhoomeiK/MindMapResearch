thisismylifenow,fesbxcz,t1_fes76j1,1579363667.0,"When I was 19 I had a -4.5 or so. My doctors did think it would level out earlier. Having kids might have impacted it some... who knows. I am the most sight deficient person in my immediate family by quite a lot. Too much reading in near darkness, perhaps."
thisismylifenow,fepcae2,t1_feozghh,1579317009.0,Holy cow I just tried this. GENIUS!!! Thank you random internet stranger!
thisismylifenow,fepc7g8,t1_feounwx,1579316956.0,To give you some perspective I have to hold my phone 4-5 inches from my face without corrected vision.  I can’t even see the big E on the eye chart at eye-test distances. Like... nothing. I have a -6.5 prescription in both eyes and am just glad it finally stopped getting worse in my mid-30’s
FreckledFoxSnarkClub,fe6e24z,t1_fdzc3cv,1578888168.0,You would be surprised what people 1) don’t know how to do and 2) have no clue how to find out for themselves. I bet there are actual followers who find his content riveting and helpful.  My mother in law texted me once asking how to bake a potato. I was so grateful that the interaction was virtual because I would not have been able to keep a straight face. Like... how have you lived this many years and don’t know how to do this or GOOGLE that nonsense.
FreckledFoxSnarkClub,fe6dzam,t1_fe00f7x,1578888106.0,Remedial Richard. I am so happy the alliteration works out.
FreckledFoxSnarkClub,fe6dnn0,t1_fdzvddf,1578887847.0,It’s like it starts off very on brand for him and then just becomes stranger and stranger. I was laughing out loud by the time I saw the eagle. Where’s the wolf???
FreckledFoxSnarkClub,fe6dhm5,t1_fe4kgqt,1578887714.0,Omg this one is a classic.
FreckledFoxSnarkClub,fe6cwwd,t1_fe6914d,1578887264.0,Dude is the least self aware person I have ever observed. I don’t think he could troll even if he wanted to. He really just thinks everything about himself is the most amazing ever. Honestly I am surprised he hasn’t taken a picture of his own shit in a toilet and posted a proud instagram detailing his amazing diet and pooping habits.
FreckledFoxSnarkClub,fe6cp1i,t3_ekum49,1578887098.0,"His new bio is what cringe is made of:
“Father, Husband, Optimist.” Plus other faux-spirational phrases and that stupid faith over fear hash tag. The icing on the cake? The emoji selection: motorcycle, headphones, chess pawn piece, Chinese takeout container, and eagle. I have so many questions!!!"
FreckledFoxSnarkClub,fe6c8jc,t1_fe67pzl,1578886754.0,Maybe hummus?
FreckledFoxSnarkClub,fe6c0nk,t1_fdruohl,1578886591.0,It still boggles my mind that he is an actual living human.
FreckledFoxSnarkClub,fe6by5n,t1_fdqfgto,1578886539.0,One of my all time favorite freckled Fox typos.
FreckledFoxSnarkClub,fe5sms7,t1_fe5ngso,1578874056.0,I can just imagine it... “I guess this is my life now”
