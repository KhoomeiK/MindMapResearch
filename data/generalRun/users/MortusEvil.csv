Off the top of my head, I have:

-	ADHD
-	Autism Spectrum Disorder
-	OCD
-	Anxiety

""Ableism"" against me would be to assume I was incapable of basic tasks because I might sperg out, or completely lose attention, because these assumptions would require believing that I am only my disabilities, and that I don't take any medications or never had treatments. ""Ableism"" against me would be to judge and discriminate against me **based on my disabilities.**

3.	 Yaniv not being allowed in a gynaecologist's office, the fact that dysphoria is required to be transgender, the presumption of innocence of men, the fact that racism is not ""power + prejudice"" and that it's possible to be racist against white people, etc.
4.	 Speak/be offended on behalf of minorities and positively discriminate against minorities by having lower standards for things like universities and the bar exam, instead of removing inequalities by accounting for economic differences
