TheExpanse,fh0oua1,t1_fgw1iiq,1581206059.0,"I read the books for the first time a while back and Avasarala's language was pretty strong, then watched the show, and then to refresh my mind, read the books again. My girlfriend is finally watching it with me and enjoying it, but when it comes to Avasarala, she found her intriguing in season one, and when she started dropping f bombs in season 2, that's when it became almost adoration. It was such a nice subtle ramp up to full Avasarala."

 I think the best thing I've heard that makes it worthwhile is that while our furry friend is only with us for a short part of our lives, you're their entire life. You were her one constant."

politics,fgtftp0,t1_fgspjwl,1581103942.0,"In Canada it's law that a employer must give time to allow for voting.    
    
>> Are all employers required to give time off work to vote?  
  
>>Yes, the law applies to all employers. However, for employers in the transportation industry, the obligation to provide three consecutive hours off to vote does not apply if these four conditions are met:  
  
>>the employer is a company that transports goods or passengers by land, air or water;  
  
>>the employee is employed outside his or her polling division;  
  
>>the employee is employed in the operation of a means of transportation; and. 
   
>>the time off cannot be allowed without interfering with the transportation service. 

This also requires an employer to pay the hours missed while voting. So in Canada, unless as indicated in the additional sections listed, it's really hard to make an excuse why you can't vote."
