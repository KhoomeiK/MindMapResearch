This was only a first date, but I expected to give her a *real* sloppy joe afterwards. She licked the grease off the bottom of her lip and picked up a fry. Her slender fingers made me want to lick salt off them. I couldn’t resist the temptation to dress her up in a sexy cow suit and take her to the slaughterhouse. I wanted to tenderize that pussy harder than a well- done steak. I began sweating profusely. She made eye contact with me and the perspiration persisted. I began to tell her unspeakable things about what I would do to her. A waitress seemed to be lurking nearby. I decided now would be the right time to take my date home. Before we left, I leaned in for a kiss. I could taste the beef from her mouth and savoured every second. I let out a seductive moan. The waitress came to our table and said “Sir, this is a Wendy’s”.”"
