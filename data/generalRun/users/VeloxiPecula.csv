AskReddit,fdg41ru,t3_el7j8r,1578379201.0,"Oh I actually have a story for this one. So a few years back, a tree in my backyard fell down. No crazy wind, it had rained the night before, but was clear at the point of timber. It's spring, and I immediately worry about squirrel babies because there are a ton in my backyard and I enjoy feeding them every so often.

Anyways, I ho out to the tree and actually start to hear squeaking. Lo and behold, there's a little baby squirrel on the ground, just inches from a major break in the wood. I pick it up, but I still hear squeaking. A second one was caught underneath a branch. It was too heavy to move, so I scooped out some of the dirt around it and dug it out.

My parents were frantic, not particularly wanting to become squirrel foster parents. I, on the other hand, was ready to take these two little fuzzballs in as my own kids. I was wearing a pull-over hoodie, so I kept them warm and safe in the front pocket. We even went to the store and picked up some kitten milk. 

Hours later, I'm watching TV while cuddling these lil twins, when I notice a squirrel outside. Now, they know we give them food, but they dont ever come up to the back door because of our dog. This mama squirrel came up and put her paw on the sliding glass door and I instantly knew. 

She ran up a tree when the door opened, but I went outside and sat down next to said tree. At this point the babies were very clingy so I actually had some trouble pulling them out of my front pocket while she ran back down the tree and began her approach. I put one baby on the ground between us, and she picked it up, then ran up the tree. Not half a minute later, she was back for the second one. I held it out for her and she took it, then disappeared up the tree without a trace.

Shit was pretty damn cool. ""Human scent scares the parents away"" is bullcrap. For squirrels, at least."

One thing to remember is that there will ALWAYS be more dogs in need of foster homes, and you're not particularly snatching one dog from someone else. It just means that they'll get to find another dog that fits them. The way I see it, if you think this pup would be happy and loved in your home, and you have all of the means of keeping it active and healthy (which it seems you do), take them out of the foster system altogether and make room for the next pup in need. :)"
