modernwarfare,fgf71dw,t1_fgf3vgt,1580727917.0,I think you've misunderstood: the problem with this meme template is the fact that in the film Peter Parker sees things clearlier *without* his glasses.
offmychest,fgf6why,t3_exs7t2,1580727713.0,"This is a chance for an interesting debate.

Let's start by saying that I'd never debase anybody regardless of my opinion on their occupation, simply as a matter of civility, but I do have a different opinion on sex workers or, more specifically, on the provision of sexual acts by itself. Moreover, by ""sex worker"", I mean the providers of explicit sexual acts, so not strippers, for instance.

I was taught that *all jobs are dignified* as long as they're legitimate. However, people should always strive for the better and elevate themselves from their current social position. They do this through study and work. An Italian saying I love goes like ""even the factory worker wants his son to be a doctor"" because it expresses the drive behind society's progress. This point of view of mine explains my firs critic on sex work:

* sex work takes no skill.

Sure, a sex worker can be better or worse at its job, but the bare minimum to partake in this occupation is provided by nature, not by training or education. Even the worst sex worker would still find customers. This discourages the pursuit of a less convenient way of life, which goes against my point of view I've stated above.

Intimacy should be treasured. Sex is an extremely powerful psychological and biological glue, which is vital to any healthy romantic relationship. By having a sexual intercourse you're revealing and conceding your most intimate self to you partner. It is perhaps the most valuable token of commitment you can give. This other point of view of mine explains my second critic on sex work:

* sex work depreciates sex.

Life is a delicate balance between need and satisfaction. By having an easy access to such a prized goal you're undermining the ""difficult"" access (courtship) which helps to ennoble the sexual act. In the long term, this opens up a number of senarios, in one of which stable couple life is less and less valued, thus disrupting the core unit of society. I must admit this is more of a case for males than females. Supply generates demand too, not just the other way around.

In the end, however, I'd like to note that I'm absolutely pro-legalization of sex workers. An another Italian saying calls the sex work ""the world's oldest profession"", i.e. it can't be countered. Often laws are created in order to legalize an already established and accepted situation and in this case everybody would benefit from it: we'd be able to take prostitution away from organized crime and regulate it, protecting both the workers and the customers.

This doesn't mean I'd look at a sex worker the same way I look at a doctor or a trash man. Every other profession would still be a noth higher in my book. I wouldn't scorn a sex worker but niether would I praise it.

Finally, it's interesting to see the different takes on the world we have, OP. You're fighting for the absolute indivdual right of self-determination, while I can't decouple the individual from its function in the society.

I have long term  girlfriend with whom I share a healthy sexual life, a stable and respectable job and nothing to worry about at the moment - porn didn't damage me in any way.

Your problems with porn stem from this:

>I try not to do it because I know that this is morally dubious

It is absolutely fucking not. You're not doing anything wrong by masturbating. If anything, you're doing yourself a favour: you're getting to know your body (I'm assuming you're in your twenties at max), relieving stress and exploring your sexual preferences/limits (to some extent). It's a natural practice! Restraining your sexual needs is what will damage you, not masturbation.

However, you can overindulge into it, especially when you have too much free time. Hell, we boys tend to fiddle with our dicks out of boredom! It's only half a step before that evolves into a wank. I remember certain summer days from when I was a teen: no school, nobody home, nothing to do -> wank marathon! To the point of busing the fifth nut with a flaccid dick lol  so my advice is to engage in some activities which is good by itself, not only for keeping your hand out of your pants.

Still have goosebumps.

As it appears clear, I prefer Black mostly for aesthetic reasons. The mature theme, dark, decaying setting and sense of despair fit the TM universe so well.
