Hungarians weren’t ever Anti Habsburg, they were anti-Germanization. They merely wanted equal representation since they formed basically half of Austria."

todayilearned,ff5ccn9,t1_ff5c3tc,1579587097.0,"Yet they don’t identify as Russian? My grandparents don’t speak Ukrainian and came from Donetsk and were born from a mixed Russian family, yet they consider themselves Ukrainian and loyal only to Ukraine. If they considered themselves to be Russians and mixed with Russians and speaking Russian and loyal to Russia, then they wouldn’t identify themselves as Ukrainian on a referendum. Plain and simple. Those who identify as Russian did so, and they are in the (large) minority."
todayilearned,ff5bwae,t1_ff5box6,1579586625.0,"While it might be, it still proves the point, it’s not like the Ukrainian East is just predominantly Russian, it is more Ukrainian than Russian yet you are trying to justify the Russian invasion by telling me that 10 million Russians live across Ukraine? That’s like saying Hungary was in the right for taking of Transylvania in WW2 because of the large Hungarian pocket in the middle of Romania. It doesn’t make sense, and invasion (Especially when Russia promised to never mess with our sovereignty when we gave up our nukes) is definitely not the answer."
todayilearned,ff5big4,t1_ff5bb5u,1579586233.0,"Material support my ass, your telling me moving in more Regular troops in then there were actual separatists is “Material Support”.

A good half of Ukrainians in Kiyv will answer you in English (Though heavily accented) if you ask something in English.

And that’s my point, I don’t care about local crazy bastards, I care about the country that wants to call us “Brothers” when they are supporting the crazy bastards in our country that are killing people and creating an endless stalemate that could have been ended if not for Russian intervention. The Russians have never been in Donetsk nor Luhansk until Soviet times, before that the Ukrainian steppelands people had expanded to even the entire Azov coast in the days of the Russian Empire. Russians moving in is the product of cultural and famine induced genocide."
todayilearned,ff5a45c,t1_ff59tvj,1579584867.0,"Well then they can head back to Russia, the days of the Soviet Union are over, they can head back to their motherland since they’ve never had any sort of claim over Ukrainian lands, especially when they have committed vast atrocities against us including genocides and cultural suppression."

Our economy both GDP per capita and overall GDP has been rising greatly since the start of our conflicts in 2014, and clearly you don’t have an ounce of understanding our politics nor our President when Zelensky has clearly laid out his plans saying that his goal for his presidency is continuing Ukraine’s economic recovery and establishing greater relations with other nations, which he has done fantastically with all his foreign visits to other nations that has driven many to help us. Our corruption is being uncovered and a lot has been done such to help since the start. 

Also are you joking me, everyone already knows what happened to MH17, literally the first thing that came out when the flight was shot down was Russian soldiers celebrating until they realized their blunder. Plus the missile system that shot down the plane (Which was 37,000 feet overhead) could only be Russian sourced, and might I add that literal radio chatter logs were found of Russians discussing the plane crash."

And Crimea was never Russian nor a part of Russia, if you want to give it back to the Tatar’s, I’m fine with that but this is Russia explicitly going back on their promise to guarantee Ukraine’s territorial sovereignty and taking things that only hold some old connection with no regard to treaties."

The Republicans were destined to lose, for as even before the nationalists started the coup, the Communists and socialists had tried their own open rebellion with almost great success two years earlier, showing that the Republicans were losing support from both the left and right segments of the country. Franco was not fascist, in fact the model he followed was that of their neighbour Portugal, which was led by Salazar who himself was a dictator who opposed both far right and left elements. End of point, I’ve never argued in favor of any of the actions Franco had made after the war, but he was definitely not a fascist."
HistoryMemes,fd9ik7v,t1_fd9i576,1578233886.0,"The government lost all legitimacy when it continued to betray and destroy the ethnic and conservative elements of Spain. The abolishment of the Monarchy, the systematic purge of the clergy, and the use of violent means to end worker strikes in Basque all lead to this civil war. The Military would not have succeeded if they did not maintain popular support, and they did. Very much in the same way I could switch this to your side of thinking on the Republican Government, which had used the anarchists and even the light Republicans and eliminated them so that only the socialists and communist principles remained."

That’s right the Falangists, in fact one of the main opponents of Franco after the civil war was the leader of the Falangists, because instead heading for the Falangists goal of greater ambitions, Franco instead chose to put a greater emphasis on Catholic unity. You can’t argue Franco was a fascist when he was the one who put down the more fascist like components of his government."
HistoryMemes,fd9gxec,t1_fd98rpg,1578233153.0,"Franco was never a fascist, and even Hitler had admitted that Franco was not a fascist. Nationalist Spain was held up by Conservatives, Monarchists, Falangists, and general Anti-Republican sentiment. The Republic had abolished the monarchy, led a systematic purge of the clergy, and had even put down ethnic worker strikes like the one in Basque with great massacres and military presence. The Republican Government was a ticking time bomb, and even if it had won the war it would consume itself again with its factionalism."
HistoryMemes,fd9fyy1,t1_fd91gmo,1578232838.0,"Except they lost almost all of their popular support the second they abolished the Monarchy and began a systematic purge of the clergy, including massacres against Basque workers.
