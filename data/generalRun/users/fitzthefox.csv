SuicideWatch,fe6oyg1,t3_eny2i3,1578898738.0,"Hey- I don't know if we have at all similar concepts of the divine, but any God worth revering already accepts you. Never stopped accepting you. Original sin is bullshit- you were born worthy of divine love and nothing you do in life can change that. I know, intimately, the feeling that there is no way out of the complete fucking dumpster fire that your life has become- hell, I'm scrolling through this sub because I feel that way right this second- but alongside all that, you are still an expression of the divine and you are still worthy of grace."
SuicideWatch,fe6oic9,t3_enq58n,1578898206.0,"Echoing what others are saying- molly and booze is a combination that will have seriously fucked with your ability to consent. Molly lowers your inhibitions really hard, especially around sex and touch and feelings. I have done a \*lot\* of psychedelic drugs over a lot of years, and still, with molly (and acid) specifically, I was vulnerable to emotional manipulation and control from an (now-ex) partner. 

You tried to assert your boundaries under duress and while super intoxicated- that is brave and hard, and I'm really fucking sorry this person didn't listen. Does your girlfriend know about the circumstances at play here? The coercion, the pressuring, the ignoring of your ""no?"" If my partner told me that story, I would understand. 

Even leaving the intoxication aside- I have absolutely done exactly this thing, protested and said no before going along with things- even taking active part in things- because, when it's clear that the other person isn't listening to you, it's just much, much easier to just let it happen. In some ways, those interactions stuck with me more than some of my more intense sexual trauma incidents, specifically because, well... I participated. I acquiesced. That gets into your psyche in a really fucked up way.

It's still assault. It is still 100% on the other person's head, for not listening to you. For crossing your boundaries and disregarding your personhood.

I can't promise that anyone's feelings will change in any particular direction- but give her all the information and a little time, and she might come to understand a bit better what your situation is. In the meantime, do you live somewhere where there is good, healthy queer community? If you can find people who understand consent, and who might even understand that sexuality is fluid (i.e. your passing curiosity about fucking a dude does not mean you're not gay), that could be really supportive.

You are not a terrible person. I'm sorry this happened to you. Sending you strength and love."
SuicideWatch,fe6nd4o,t1_fe6e0yk,1578896910.0,"Thank you for this comment. I'm having a really, really shit night. The thing that has always stopped me just barely short of attempting suicide, through 31 years of being suicidal, has been exactly this- passing on my pain to my loved ones, my mother and father especially. They're in their 70s and I need to be reminded that doing this would blight their old age in a way that would be inexcusable. 

I'm so sorry that your son lost his fight. I'm sorry that you have to carry his pain too. I know nothing eases that, but I hope that knowing your words helped me adds to your pile of good things."

MadOver30,fa328ib,t3_e7art8,1575789571.0,"Oh god yes this. Being depressed as a 16 year old or a 21 year old is... somewhat expected adolescent upheaval? You're told ""it'll even out"" ""it gets better!"" ""you'll settle into yourself."" Pursuing therapy, self-work, medication all feels so much more potentially productive.

Well, I'm 31 and I don't think I have a self to settle into. I'm still in the same trenches fighting the same demons, except that they've aged along with me, and their arguments are more nuanced, sharper, more insidious than they were when I was a kid. I'm so fucking tired."
