MMA,ffjvbxd,t3_etxy8w,1580007957.0,People are worried that guys having custom gear will make the sport look less professional yet these terrible production quality streams are cool?
MMA,ffjv0hz,t1_ffjsukr,1580007709.0,Boo
MMA,ffjst0k,t3_etxy8w,1580005981.0,Does Reyes have a chance or is this another Smith situation where Jones neat everyone so now anyone can get a title shot?
MMA,ffjrw09,t3_etxy8w,1580005278.0,Bisping just called out all of Reddit
MMA,ffjokp0,t1_ffjod1u,1580003066.0,Darko didn't do anything in the second round lol
MMA,ffjoihc,t1_ffjodqs,1580003024.0,This is a good one haha
MMA,ffjo5ei,t1_ffjo2fh,1580002779.0,It wasn't that close dude
MMA,ffjmpna,t1_ffjmhef,1580001809.0,It's also two different comparisons a gold medalist is so specific and a BJJ black belt is a broad statement
MMA,ffjml1y,t1_ffjmhxp,1580001722.0,No one holds the belt forever at heavyweight lol
MMA,ffjgnpt,t1_ffjgffg,1579997842.0,Accurate
MMA,ffjgjnd,t1_ffjezvk,1579997777.0,I'm not a trained fighter. Yeah he has a good chin but his stand up was terrible and for a BJJ black belt he wasn't impressive
MMA,ffjefrw,t1_ffje8q5,1579996531.0,He was tired as fuck and montez was hitting hard
MMA,ffjednv,t1_ffjebjh,1579996495.0,He is Garbage though
MMA,ffjea6w,t1_ffje89u,1579996439.0,He is exhausted lol
MMA,ffje0fj,t1_ffjdwbo,1579996279.0,Little bit of both montel is exhausted
MMA,ffjds39,t1_ffjdnyt,1579996149.0,He is tough and montel is exhausted
MMA,ffjdqgs,t1_ffjdofo,1579996122.0,He is exhausted lol
MMA,ffjc0n0,t1_ffjbgve,1579995123.0,I always wonder how big the gap is. Like how much training would a guy need to beat a UFC female fighter. Like how when the Williams sisters challenged the male tennis players and some rank 120 dude destroyed them.
MMA,ffjbli1,t1_ffjbemu,1579994877.0,You're an idiot man
MMA,ffj8btr,t1_ffj86vf,1579992863.0,Woodcutting all night baby
todayilearned,ffizkxg,t3_etre48,1579986630.0,You can get a field goal in basketball?
MMA,ffigc7u,t1_ffhq2uk,1579973205.0,There is also different levels of broken bones. There is a guy that goes on Joe Rogan and always brags about how he did this crazy stuff with broken legs but they were stress fractures from running. I've had those in races and it hurts like a bitch but it doesn't cripple you.
MMA,ffig2ll,t1_ffhpk6w,1579973022.0,Yeah it probably felt broken to him at the moment
MMA,ffifboe,t1_ffi570d,1579972510.0,I wouldn't be surprised if it's like 50% maybe 70% at most. There is reason why cycling records haven't even been close broken from the steroids era. After they cracked down on Lance they had to drop down to the rank 47 dude and give him the win
MMA,ffie5f5,t1_ffibyj4,1579971712.0,Umm steroids are rampant at the highschool and even middle school wrestling in some places. It was so easy to get steroids in college and I was just at the school gym not even on the teams. Plus this wasn't even a top college
MMA,ffido5y,t1_ffid6qy,1579971392.0,It would probably work out in the long run honestly. There would be a huge controversy initially get a shit load of views. Probably piss khabib off and make him sign the contract eventually
MMA,ffidk98,t1_ffibmyn,1579971320.0,It wouldn't matter in the long run
MMA,ffidiie,t1_ffia8fh,1579971289.0,He could turn it down but then Dana could go alright strip the belt and put cowboy Conor rematch for the belt. Leading khabib to accept just so he doesn't get stripped
MMA,ffid5bw,t1_ffi4quj,1579971041.0,Yeah prelims
JoeRogan,fficrne,t3_etftgz,1579970784.0,These guys have no clue what casual fans want to see. The actual people that make those 2 million ppv buys happen. There is Conor vs khabib 2 posts all over social media. They don't care Conor got stomped. You also can 100% make someone famous UFC is just terrible at it
JoeRogan,ffhfzfd,t1_ffhbmbl,1579933629.0,Think if Tony takes it to 5 rounds he might be able to pull a submission. Sorta like the Silva and sonnen fight the fist time. I give khabib about an 80-90% chance of winning though
JoeRogan,ffhfuoj,t1_ffgyi46,1579933475.0,They should really stop pulling shit up if we can't see it. It feels like 40% of the podcast is them watching or talking about something they looked up.
netflix,ffha7ru,t3_et8kxu,1579927663.0,The part 3 is what I feared the show would turn into. It's trying to do too much since they keep one upping themselves. Also feels like it's a brand new writer that never saw the first 2 parts.
todayilearned,ffha1jr,t1_ffh5uwv,1579927505.0,They have ways of dealing with and recycling the waste. The whole what do we do with the waste thing hasn't been a real problem in like 20 years
technology,ffh6e99,t1_fffcqk9,1579924380.0,It's not hard to block all those things
technology,ffh6ckf,t1_fffestw,1579924343.0,The weird part is it's cheaper and sometimes easier to set up your security system without using nest and other shit like that
technology,ffh67oo,t1_fffblv9,1579924233.0,And people want America to burn and ban all their guns
Games,ffh5qej,t1_ffgybbi,1579923851.0,They were also getting AAA exclusives before then.
Games,ffh5ohq,t1_ffh5hg4,1579923808.0,No shit but people are saying there is no way they will switch to next gen. I'm just saying it's possible
movies,ffh5l2h,t1_ffg8lkj,1579923734.0,It's not lol
movies,ffh5i4t,t1_ffgwf2a,1579923671.0,Yeah the limit was like 12 until the 300 promotion thing. I remember being so hyped by that lol then they eventually let you have however many you wanted
todayilearned,ffh4egg,t1_ffh3dxf,1579922810.0,That's not even true anymore lol
todayilearned,ffh46d6,t1_ffgsabr,1579922635.0,Yeah our battery technology hasn't advanced much since like 2002
Games,ffgvec2,t1_ffgtmja,1579916036.0,Lots a great games came out within the first year of PS4 and Xbox one.
Games,ffgtxxt,t1_ffgqmca,1579914980.0,I mean eventually you have to make the cut off for next gen. You can't have everyone making ports for both gens.
Games,ffgsxlj,t1_ffgezuk,1579914244.0,I mean at some point though you gotta make launch games. Otherwise every game that comes out on launch would also come out on the previous console.
Games,ffgsmej,t1_fffh6in,1579914013.0,Damn SpongeBob meme
Games,ffgs8r7,t1_fffltaa,1579913739.0,Yeah there is a reason they spend millions on tax guys
JoeRogan,ffgjryb,t1_ffgccuf,1579907847.0,Plus it's really not that difficult
fakehistoryporn,ffgjn3v,t1_ffff6vn,1579907758.0,You'll never get denied healthcare in America
ufc,ffgjiki,t1_fffogux,1579907676.0,Basically lol
MMA,fffct26,t1_fff6ior,1579881128.0,Nah dude people just wanted to believe cowboy had a chance so hard. Cowboy is the it's still real to me damnit of mma
MMA,fffclnw,t1_fff400f,1579881000.0,Because Conor also beats all of those guys easily too. Cowboy is good but he was never top tier good. Just good enough toro stay in the top 10 and sometimes stumble into top 5 only to get his ass kicked
MMA,fffc6p8,t1_fff5fej,1579880740.0,Yeah cowboy is definitely overated. He is good but he isn't top level good. There is a reason he is always brought up as goat gatekeeper
MMA,fffc2g5,t1_ffepm3h,1579880666.0,There was plenty of Conor is washed up he is rich and doesn't have it anymore talk. There was also a lot of people that act like Conor has no ground game and figured cowboy could just take him down and sub him. There was plenty of cowboy has a chance talk
MMA,fffbvyf,t1_fff75o8,1579880552.0,The prelims were great though and there was some slick grappling
MMA,fffbsvk,t1_ffen6rv,1579880498.0,Like .91% chance
thefighterandthekid,fffaraq,t1_fff4qo1,1579879829.0,Yea it looks like he just got older and fatter. Plus in this instance one picture his mouth is pursed and the other picture his mouth is gapping with loose lips
ufc,fffahjc,t1_fff86ox,1579879660.0,I never said Conor specifically but in general no one has had a rematch yet. It would be like if gsp never got a rematch against Matt serra. Although that wasn't the same as khabib and Conor.
ufc,fffa9h0,t1_fff8guj,1579879515.0,Not a huge one but it's one of the khabib what ifs. No one has got a rematch. Granted no one has come close to beating him so it probably wouldn't change much. There is a big difference from forming a camp against someone on what you think they will do and gaming off knowing what they did to you
paag,fff79w9,t3_et7l1i,1579877503.0,There is something about booty stretch marks that get me going
ufc,fff72wg,t1_fff6gbp,1579877369.0,I mean khabib has never had a rematch either. So we don't know how someone will match up against after dealing with it
ufc,fff6vwu,t1_fff36q7,1579877230.0,Yeah then everyone on here acts like any wrestler would roll through Conor. He lost to one of the best grapplers to ever do and Conor had a while camp just for that guy. I think Conor's ground game is pretty good
fakehistoryporn,fff6d41,t1_ffergiw,1579876853.0,It's nothing like this in America lol
fakehistoryporn,fff6bnx,t1_fff3c0n,1579876823.0,Wouldn't not paying medical debt mess up your credit and make it hard to buy stuff like a house in the future. Kinda cripples you if you pay it or not
fakehistoryporn,fff68vm,t1_fff2oki,1579876767.0,Usually when people talk about a guy they know now a days it's something they read in the internet
fakehistoryporn,fff64wo,t1_fff58gz,1579876686.0,I always wonder this because if you can't afford healthcare there is usually some kind of assistance you can get for free or heavily discounted. I make enough money to not qualify for my aid but I don't have insurance at the moment because I would have to really tighten down on my budget to afford a decent plan.
IAmA,ffezm3w,t1_ffevvz7,1579871472.0,I doubt that thought crosses their mind
freefolk,ffdcmpl,t1_ffdbwjx,1579818049.0,I hate internet backlash lol
freefolk,ffdc9ct,t1_ffd6lwy,1579817814.0,If I was their friends I would definitely make fun of them but I feel like once you get to that level everyone just kisses everyone's ass all the time so they don't burn any future opportunities
2007scape,ffcvoib,t1_ffchfy1,1579808229.0,Ehh tbh if better graphics pops up in votes I'm always voting yes
MMA,ffcjk9i,t1_ffbcvrc,1579800825.0,Yeah so he is undefeated
MMA,ffcjj10,t1_ffbg5xa,1579800805.0,Probably not but we will never know
MMA,ffcjelg,t1_ffblfjm,1579800729.0,Ahhh shit how did I forget my boy. I'm ashamed
MMA,ffcjccj,t1_ffbvy5y,1579800693.0,Definitely one of my favorite fights of all time
worldnews,ffci65a,t1_ffcgjof,1579799982.0,I mean climate change doesn't start the fires. People used the climate change narrative for the fires in California the past couple years. All the major fires in California were started by humans being dumb and a major reason they got big was terrible forest management or wind. Climate change is definitely a factor but there a lots of reasons for these fires
worldnews,ffchtwa,t1_ffcecab,1579799773.0,I'm not saying china started the fires but here in California another wildfire hotspot of the world we have a problem with fires getting started by asian hunters. They shoot squirrels and then burn all their hair off in a hole. Sometimes that starts wildfires
worldnews,ffch5an,t1_ffcb2wi,1579799355.0,Same in California basically the only other place in the world abalone live
MMA,ffb7tir,t1_ffb1iur,1579754300.0,Yeah is he paid firefighter or volunteer. It's weird I can't see a department having part time dudes unless it's a small ass town or volunteer
MMA,ffb7mhg,t1_ffawkfh,1579754088.0,It was like the Rhonda Nunes promo lol
MMA,ffb7bst,t1_ffawzbq,1579753782.0,Yeah but I just don't really care man.
MMA,ffb73dq,t1_ffb3rax,1579753565.0,No shit but it was a disqualification he wasn't defeated
MMA,ffb702z,t1_ffb4qj8,1579753490.0,Yes but it lets him train more on timing drills and distance management. Allow him to not be as tired when he does those drills so he can out more focus into them. Then puts him in a better headspace during the fight to pull that off.
MMA,ffb1yrl,t1_ffayn3i,1579749768.0,More confidence while on them allows you to focus more. They allow you to train harder and longer in the gym allowing improved fight iq
JoeRogan,ffb1vy1,t1_ffb0r6v,1579749715.0,He runs a clothing company and has a life outside of jre. The podcast is pretty big for one guy to run it. Idk how this is a hard concept
MMA,ffaxbk0,t1_ffait1t,1579746655.0,Yeah Jones some has a good pedigree because his brother are amazing football players yet also not athletic enough to beat Reyes somehow
MMA,ffax8cb,t1_ffav86p,1579746597.0,This comment made me laugh
MMA,ffax6p6,t1_ffavkcp,1579746567.0,Ehh you can argue peds improve all those things but it still doesn't make it an even playing field imo Jones is just better than everyone he has fought even if they were also on roids or not
MMA,ffawxxw,t1_ffasiio,1579746406.0,Ehh he has a DQ not a loss if you you wanna look at it that way. Which is how I look at it and the UFC
MMA,ffawv35,t1_ffam8t0,1579746353.0,On the roids and off the roids no one has beat him?
MMA,ffawtt0,t1_ffan3vd,1579746330.0,Yeah I have it at a DQ not technically a loss in my books. Him and khabib undefeated
JoeRogan,ffapje9,t1_ffam9cr,1579741470.0,I highly doubt it. With how much money the podcast makes and how busy they both are I doubt it's only Jaimie doing the crunching
JoeRogan,ffaikvh,t1_ff9yvjl,1579736592.0,Yeah the sensitivity angle is just to make a hook. It's all assumptions and everyone who gets it done later in life say it's the same.
JoeRogan,ffahzra,t1_ffa0ldn,1579736187.0,Jre is definitely not all Jaimie lol guests usually bring up his staff all the time just Joe never really talks about it
gaming,ffahro8,t1_ff9y0u8,1579736035.0,"Yeah the hardest part of that boss for me was when he uses your aeon against you, confused one of your characters or something like that and since I grinded all their ultimate weapons and everything I was just getting one shotted"
gaming,ffahiq0,t1_ffaecjm,1579735870.0,I just have no patience. Get to a spot that requires grinding or too much back tracking fuck that
gaming,ffahcw3,t1_ff9o2rf,1579735764.0,"Oh God my first playthrough I was not prepared, didn't have the right status weapons or armour and didn't have enough of the items to play the zombie limbo required. Plus I was hard saved right before and didn't have any other saves. Probably tried the fights 50 times before giving up and restarting the game and finally beating it like 8 years later or whenever the remastered edition came out"
AskReddit,ffa2gka,t3_esc8vq,1579726553.0,Basically tell myself eventually you'll get into running and to not stop running because the yo yo of getting into and out of shape is terrible. Also to not be so jealous of everyone and it all works out alright
