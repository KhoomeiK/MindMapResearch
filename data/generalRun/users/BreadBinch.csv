hermitcrabs,ff23plj,t3_er6dsi,1579492959.0,Absolutely gorgeous! They'll have so much fun in this terrarium ! I used to change mine around a lot too trying to make it comfortable and have lots of play room as well. It's an amazing feeling when you get it where you want it :) so congratulations!!
hermitcrabs,ff23j1k,t3_eqzhtc,1579492817.0,"I think this is a fantastic set up! Super cool and looks comfortable. One reason you may not hear that I know is my crabs seem to hide when humidity is too low, so you could check that perhaps. There are many other reasons as well but I think in your case letting them get used to the new environment and add a bit more substrate could really help them out if they want to dig or need to molt :)"
