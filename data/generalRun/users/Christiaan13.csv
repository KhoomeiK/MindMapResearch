selfimprovement,fec4e11,t3_eoaepy,1578966484.0,All good important points. This has worked for me. I actually refer to myself as version 2.0 on its way to 3.0. Thanks for your good work here.
datingoverthirty,fdrrrh7,t3_emtuxh,1578688777.0,"My philosophy has been to do anything and everything you can to be physically and mentally healthy with yourself first and foremost. Relationships may or may not come and go, but remember you cannot control other people, what you can control is your own self care. 
Having said that, I think even when we are in a very good place being alone, as humans there will still be an innate desire to be intimate with others at some points in time, which is ok too, just keeping in mind you should be happy with yourself as a priority.  People can be happy or miserable alone, people can be happy or miserable in relationships with all spectrums in between. Please don't let societal ideologies make you think you should be in a relationship."

I've been doing the hard work on myself for 2 years since becoming single and I've never felt more joy, tranquility, and freedom in my life at 48 y.o. Now I struggle with the idea dating again because of my current life satisfaction. But I would be in denial in I didn't feel that innate pull."
