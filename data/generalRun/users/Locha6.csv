politics,ffh4qtr,t3_etg2fo,1579923078.0,"Even Republicans are finally seeing how childish and dumb Trump’s defense really is. Matt Gaetz, who was invited by Trump to the World Series, said Trump’s defense “looked like something done by eighth graders, no scratch that, eighth graders actually know how to use PowerPoint and iPads.” It’s pretty bad when your buddies are calling you dumber than an eighth grader...."

They could just get rid of him and then who’d be putting who’s head on pikes? The fact they take this all lying down just shows how spineless they all really are. No real man or woman would allow another to completely destroy their morals. They are all door mats. Way to go GOP, you’ve elected a bunch of pussies who couldn’t stand up to trump if they were strapped to a board and stuck in the ground."

If anyone knows which clip I’m referring to and can find it that’d be awesome."
technews,ffh0p4b,t3_etbadh,1579919979.0,Is this not considered a conspiracy to defraud the United States? Our country needs to be way harsher on corporations that knowingly break the law or refuse to do what they’ve been ordered to do by federal judges. Any attempt to defraud the US is grounds for a conspiracy charge.

You can’t employ DNC heads like Debbie Wasserman-Schultz who was hand in hand with Hilary’s campaign, and did everything in her power to stop Bernie from winning the nomination. Bernie supporters felt snubbed the last time and it’s partly why Hilary lost. How could she expect to swing the Bernie supporters to her side when emails proved the DNC only wanted Hilary and the nomination process was a scam. Nominate Biden and expect four more years of Trump. Biden will find a way to lose ... he seems to be trying harder to lose each and every day."

You see the mechanic happening a lot if you do run plays over and over in practice. The player will get tackled but seem to be trying to get back up. It’s because he’s actually sitting or laying on top of a defender and not actually down yet. Usually another defender jumps in to finish the tackle.

NCAAFBseries,fe60zkh,t1_fe2rcje,1578879355.0,"Set your big hits and strip ball to conservative. If you see them lining up with all WRs on one side leaving the other side of the field open, change coverage to base align and key up run right or left (whichever side is the open field) or key up run mid on first or short yardage downs. Showing blitz brings players closer to the line of scrimmage so they can’t chunk out 3-4 yards each run. Maybe run 4-3 defense. I play on Heisman as Iowa and typically have #1 run defense. I have trouble defending the passes over the middle. Versatile teams are very hard to stop so if you start keying up the run every play they’ll have wide open receivers downfield so you gotta use it selectively. Mainly blitz more, use run keys when you think you know for sure it’s a run. Play as a DT or DE and work that stick! One other thing is once you start stopping the run they’ll hit you with the screen. Playing as a DE can help you crush this play. You’ll notice the O-line not try to stop you, you can recognize that it’s screen and run straight after the RB and crush him for a loss."
