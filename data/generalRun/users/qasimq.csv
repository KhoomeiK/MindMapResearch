nextfuckinglevel,ff60jk5,t1_ff4g4hl,1579616004.0,The edit in this post might be the most Canadian thing I have seen. I needed this niceness in the morning. Thanks : )
millionairemakers,ferpoht,t3_eq81a8,1579356943.0,Hello
aww,fejwe0u,t1_fejvh0w,1579187383.0,"There you are  : ) 

Your posts serve as a nice pick me up."
chaoticgood,feaueus,t1_feasag4,1578952247.0,"Seriously ?! 

Damn. Honestly I dont know how I would react to something like that. Then again I don't smoke so yea ..."
iamatotalpieceofshit,fdn8awr,t1_fdmkmym,1578579982.0,"Thanks for posting that. This video makes me sad beyond belief. 

This poor man is obviously fell on hard times. Maybe the one solace he has in his existence is this little companion. What kind of a heartless person would want to deprive another human of this ?"
aww,fdn7zzq,t1_fdn1ba6,1578579762.0,But I just want to lightly hug it !!!!!
aww,fdh3045,t1_fdgy6tm,1578414278.0,": ( 

Yea. I know. But this island is south of Melbourne and (I think) away from the fires. I just hate to think of all the destruction wrought by the wild fires in that beautiful country."
PublicFreakout,fdgumnc,t1_fdehn0m,1578408736.0,"Ostriches look evil as fuck ! 

But the animal that scared the bejesus out of me is an Emu. Saw one in a wild life preserve behind the fence. The guide told us it is ok to feed kangaroos and Wallabies in the preserve by hand but stay the fuck away from the Emu's."
aww,fdgtbvf,t1_fdgsnc1,1578407798.0,"Same here. 

On a related note, I had the pleasure of watching the penguin parade at Philips island in Australia. These guys are absolutely adorable as they make their way out of the water and back to their nests. If anyone gets a chance I HIGHLY recommend seeing it."
ABoringDystopia,fddzn20,t1_fdcpsu0,1578327823.0,"It's not that bad. It is just weird in its own way. 

Not all NY'ers are ass holes. I am sorry if you have had a bad experience."
ABoringDystopia,fddzcci,t1_fdd2wg3,1578327624.0,"I agree with your sentiment. However, I also have a hard time believing that everyone on that platform was convincing this guy out of a motivation of being at work on time. 

I live in NYC and I know what my motivation would be talking to this person. I would want to genuinely help some one like that. And I sure as hell know there are people like and / or better than me in this city. 

Not everyone in NY is an asshole."
ABoringDystopia,fddyxa8,t1_fddp8en,1578327342.0,"Same here. 

However, that conversation is not out of the realm of possibility. To me it sounds like a very likely thing that would happen in our wonderfully bizarre city."
funny,fddxwru,t1_fddehvh,1578326651.0,"He kept on saying ""I don't care .. it's the last time"" 

FUCK NO Ricky !! You better get your ass back and do this every year. That was great !"
WatchPeopleDieInside,fddrybm,t1_fdcpod7,1578322422.0,This !!
iamatotalpieceofshit,fd5exau,t1_fd4ke9l,1578176942.0,"Thanks for posting this my good man. 
My heart literally sunk seeing this video. It is good to know that a relatively happy ending came out of it."
AskReddit,fd3zu6n,t1_fd2g3qh,1578163075.0,"I agree on Melbourne. I visited and loved the city. Won't move there though. 

I live in NYC. And I have a weird relationship with it. I never wanted to move here but circumstances led me here and stayed. It's been 15 years. I love this city and I hate it too. The worst thing about it is that no matter where else I go, I can not see myself moving there. 

Even though NYC us exhausting, expensive and smells like garbage dipped in urine. I can not bring myself to leave here."
Futurology,fd3yixv,t1_fd3xmgt,1578162768.0,"I can't find a single thing in here that I would disagree with. 

The Canadian example you give should be the model for assessment for potential leaders. Further more I would argue that once elected there should be a score board maintained (independently). People (especially politicians) should be held accountable. 

Honestly, part of me despairs for the future but at the same time I feel there is hope for us yet."
Futurology,fd3wxhh,t1_fd3gp79,1578162309.0,"I agree with your assessment. 

However, I do question what do we mean by a democracy in the modern age. Question being, in the age of mis information and easily swayed opinions (because people are lazy to do research) counter to facts, do we really have true democracy anywhere ? 

I accept that it is the responsibility of the voters to educate themselves. However, it is becoming increasingly difficult to get un biased information."
aww,fd3u3lc,t1_fd3dzt4,1578161675.0,Beautiful !!!!
PublicFreakout,fcz77k1,t1_fcybeol,1578095067.0,"Nah ! its an ok place. I like it here. 

However, like most places, we have our share of idiots. They like to think just because they live some place it makes them important or tough."
PublicFreakout,fcuue3s,t1_fcsahp4,1577988704.0,"I agree with both points. Also the addition of ""Surprise Motha-fucka"" was a nice touch !"
BlackPeopleTwitter,fcus1wz,t1_fcu8sly,1577987350.0,"I read that and instantly wished my name was Garret. 
Just sounds like a cool name"
MurderedByWords,fbv1jdd,t1_fbu6a3t,1577123875.0,"Well it is not surprising that this is fake. However, I am glad for having read ""Utter fungus of a person"" in the post. That is my new go to insult. It is scientifically insulting and I like that combo !"
