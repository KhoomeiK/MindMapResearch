I suspect the concept floated here, that more men get custody than people realize is a regional thing, and not representative of the majority of the US.

We built our house 6 years ago.  I got to hand pick my stove - went with a Whirlpool 5 burner, gas, with full grates (Not the round ones that sit over each burner - these are cast iron and fully cover the top of the stove, side to side, front to back, and are in two pieces).

My dear husband, who was also our contractor... ignored me and everyone else who told him to allow a little more wiggle room for things like the refrigerator cavity, how close he was having the wooden blinds cut for the windows... and the stove cavity.

He gave the granite people XYZ for measurements - leaving less than an 1/8 of an inch on either side of the stove - which we already had, and had measured, and were keeping in storage.

He did not account for the granite people  NOT making the cuts at the absolute perfect length/measurements he gave them.  

Which is why I'd argued and argued with him to give more wiggle room on either side than what he did, but Nooooo... Mr. Perfection here didn't listen.

It... fits... but it is wedged in so tight IDK if we'll ever be able to pull it back out.  Not only that... but it's not level... and we can't pull it out to adjust the levelers... AND  AND!  It caused it to warp a little, so the oven doesn't perfectly close.  I mean, it does... and it maintains temp, but it leaks out heat at the left top of the oven door.

I can't tell you how much this irks me.  It's not noticeable until I'm baking something for a long period of time, like a turkey or a ham... or making omelettes or pancakes.  Then I just look at my husband and scowl.

So let this be a lesson to you!  If you're building a house, and you think you can get away with zero variance for things like the length of the blinds cut to fit your windows, or areas where an appliance has to go... be prepared for... problems.  Give yourself a little wiggle room, just in case."
whatisthisthing,feozscq,t1_fenkvnf,1579308956.0,Claiming it 'is without a doubt Cherokee' is beyond irresponsible.  It's patently wrong.  Might as well say it's obviously Egyptian hieroglyphs or Early Irish Ogham.
whatisthisthing,feozld1,t1_feopqev,1579308832.0,"It's sad to say I had to explain to someone who is Choctaw, and saw a picture of the Chief shaking hands with a man (who was beaming a smile) in Ireland... that the fact the man was wearing a war bonnet was not meant in offence or in appropriation.  

There's A. The gift the Choctaws sent to Ireland, and B. The mystique of the American Old West - it is unique, and a lot of people naturally romanticize it.

It's sad that some folks are so quick to take offense these days.

PS - I'm Choctaw, Cherokee, Irish, German, and Scot... with a dab of English (Quakers)."
whatisthisthing,feng47a,t3_eq1m63,1579283946.0,"For those proclaiming it's Cherokee, there were no Cherokee in Utah, esp NE Utah.  The Cherokee and cousin Nation, the Choctaw, are from the US SE... Florida, Mississippi and the Trail of Tears came no where near Utah. It went from Florida, through Mississippi, and ended in Oklahoma. 

Sauce: I am of Mississippi Choctaw/Cherokee heritage, and I am from Oklahoma.

More than likely, this is Navajo, Ute, or possibly even Pueblo, but it is NOT Cherokee. None of the written symbols are [Cherokee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cherokee_syllabary) or even close."
whatisthisthing,fenfoip,t1_fenarzk,1579283684.0,"If it's Cherokee, they were a long long way from home. Cherokee and their cousin nation, the Choctaw are from Florida and Mississippi. Trail of Tears ended in Oklahoma."
whatisthisthing,fenfhh1,t1_fen5yf7,1579283564.0,"Without a doubt you are wildly wrong... off by thousands of miles and many a tribe. Cherokee were never in Utah. Choctaw and Cherokee were from the southern US. Trail of Tears began in Florida and Mississippi and ended in Oklahoma.

This is more than likely Navajo."

dune,fen46lh,t3_epr632,1579276583.0,"For those interested, the key to reading this is to go about it with the mindset that the 'authors' of the entries are people (Scholars?) from the Dune Universe and some things are matters that they can only speculate on due to either being closely guarded secrets or having happened in ancient history, so no reliable account exits.  When you put it in that context, rather than expecting a cut and dry encyclopedia like you'd buy and read for a D&D universe, it becomes an amazing read."
