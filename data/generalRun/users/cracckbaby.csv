college,fepaa0m,t3_eq317l,1579315661.0,"I don't think you sound entitled at all, i'd be upset too. Did you tell your school about all the aid you were getting ahead of time? My school reduces my aid (usually the state aid) due to the excess scholarships I receive, so instead of having to pay anything back I just get a reduced refund. The thing is I have to tell them the exact amount im receiving or like in your case, I would have to pay back whatever amount I get over my COA, and probably lose aid for next year for failing to report it. Honestly this sounds like lazyness from your school for not noticing the aid was more than your COA last semester. But, I don't think theres anything you can do other than try to talk to the schools financial people.  Im not for sure if this is what happened, merely speculation from what you explained. Next year be sure to report every single piece of aid you receive to your school even if you think they already know. Good luck!"

If its from leftover scholarship/grant money, its your money congrats!

Do as you please but be responsible ;)"
college,fdp56yk,t3_emgdue,1578620261.0,"Yea, Ive been through this as well. They will allow you to accept the local but reduce your fed aid (if you lose your scholarship you can get your aid back next year its not gone forever). Buttt if you are being directly paid some of this money, it doesn't count towards your ESE. Thats just your money. If it all goes to the school your only getting your 13000, refund will be around 4000 from what I can tell. I got directly paid 6000 from a local scholarship and i reported to my school but it didn't count towards my ESE so I got that and another 5000 in refund. Another scholarship gave me like 5000 and I accepted it but the school reduced by grants because it went way over my ESE. SO I'll be getting 11000 this year when I could be getting 16000 if they hadn't reduced. Talk to someone  at fin aid because I was offered to use that money for a laptop or something ""school related"" I just couldn't keep that extra 5000 in my pocket. Also even if you can't get that full amount, be grateful because we're pretty lucky to be getting this much aid at all. :)"

college,fc6tlh8,t3_eggvl5,1577489159.0,"Hello! Marine Bio major here. UH Manoa was my dream school in HS, but I could'nt afford it. Not gonna lie to you, Hawaii is going to be expensive. If you have really high act/sat and good gpa you  might get assistance or a scholarship (but probably not its usually reserved for hawaii residents) . But hey, if you're not worried about the money go for it, Hawaii is a really good place to study marine biology, probably the best. If you're looking for something cheaper though check out Florida schools, they are a lot more willing to give money, especially the small private ones. Plenty of amazing opportunities in internships and student research as we have plenty of whales, dolphins and sharks in the Atlantic. Good luck!"

You worked through it, even though it was difficult, and even though you had more obstacles than your peers. Dude, that shows true strength, don't let anyone tell you otherwise. You don't need their praise, just know you've done amazing things for yourself that they'll never do. Congrats."
