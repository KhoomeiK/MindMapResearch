B. I don't know what you're talking about with the disinfecting thing.

Aluminum recycling uses far less than glass or plastic.

MemeEconomy,ff7r0bd,t1_ff6lpap,1579656247.0,"Co-ops do have a high rate of failure (though i don't know how that rate compares to failure rate of comparable businesses), but when they do work, they work amazing. A lot of the struggles come from mismanagement (because when they're just starting out, they need competent management, but it's hard to find competent management that can navigate the beginning stages of a co-op... mostly due to poor start-up capital because of low membership)

But one good example of co-ops that have a high rate of success is real-estate and housing. People pool together their funds to have greater purchasing power to afford better and cheaper housing than they would otherwise. A common example is a co-op apartment building, whereby the building itself is owned by the tenants. The residents typically don't technically ""own"" their dwellings, but they are able to treat it like they do (as long as they follow the Constitution that they set up and regularly vote on)

As for other business-type co-ops, there are plenty of other great examples of successful ones that are beneficial for both customers and employees, grocery stores are common. Retail is common, the outdoors store REI is a good one.

As for the rest of your comment, now you're just debating the merits of socialism, which isn't what I've been trying to do here and would like to avoid.

And people seem stuck on the Soviet models, but that's just the high-profile one. 

See terms, administrative command economy (soviet type, goes against most of the scholarly thoughts), planned economy (more the co-op kind), market vs. non-market socialism,  anarchism, democratic socialism, and syndicalism. 

A quote from Wikipedia about syndicalism for a taste:

>Syndicalism is a social movement that operates through industrial trade unions and rejects state socialism and the use of establishment politics to establish or promote socialism. They reject using state power to construct a socialist society, favouring strategies such as the general strike. Syndicalists advocate a socialist economy based on federated unions or syndicates of workers who own and manage the means of production."

MemeEconomy,ff6kfdf,t1_ff5mktv,1579629097.0,"You have a few common misconceptions about it. 

So take a co-op for instance. A co-op is a business that is owned by members, people buy shares (one share per person) in a business and collectively they own the business. Each individual has equal voting rights of that business, and they generally elect people to put in charge of certain things so every action doesn't have to be voted on. They contribute to the businesses with their labor (they also have paid labor to supplement the ""volunteer"" labor) and can receive dividends when there's an excess of profits. Employee owned businesses are similar.

Now take that, and in socialism, that's how everything works. (Not all socialism involves business ownership being that way, but most do.)

So the main thing you're missing is that it's not government that controls things from the top down, its people and society that controls things from the bottom up. Which can also be done by way of a socialist government put in place by the people... That government would also be run like a co-op."

So i guess i can see some small similarities... Mostly just in tone (how it's a really slow but gradually build up, with the whole movie steeping in a sense of dread/sorrow) but I'd just chalk that up to directorial style. 

The only two plot similarities i can see are the tragedy at the beginning, which sets the tone. And the cult angle.

But even the cults themselves are very different imo. One was a religious/cultural cult. The other was a pagan-esque witchcraft cult. I think the implications are entirely different there, the midsommer cult was just a run of the mill crazy people living in the forest cult, motivate by blind faith and societal oressure... While the Hereditary one wasnt really religious, more witchcraft... The reason for their beliefs weren't blind faith, they were motivate by literal eternal life, because it actually worked.

The way they unfolded was different too, the hereditary one was more of a twist at the end kind of thing. While it was the whole focus of midsommer.

Idk, if you're right and it really is more similar than i interpreted, i say cut the director some slack...

Bonus reality breaking story ~~(trying to keep it short, but i had a few to drink so i might get wordy)~~ i fucked up, it's really long... Got too creative in my writing:

When i was an early teenager, my parents took my sister and i to Mexico. We stayed in akumal/tankah Bay area before it got so commercialized (so I've heard). We took a 2 day trip to holbox, to charter some local guides to swim with whale sharks (one of the coolest things I've ever experienced)...

Anyways, to get to the ""ferry"" to holbox (which was just a local guy with an outboard motorboat) from where we were, the route goes through some pretty rural/remote country. Lots of dirt roads.

On one of these dirt roads, there was a house. Really, the house was more of a shack. In front of the house, under a tree, was a pack of 10-15 dogs. The dogs were all of varying sizes and breeding... A very diverse bunch. The dogs were gathered around a cut log sitting upright............. Sitting on that log, with a chain secured to a collar around its neck, was a monkey. 

When we got directly in front of the house, the monkey stood up. The monkey pointed at our car. At that moment, without hesitation, all of the dogs began barking at us and chasing us down the road. Pursuit lasted a few hundred feet before they gave up and walked back home. Their mission successful, they carried out their orders.

So that was pretty fucking metal.

My sister was the only other person in the car to see Commander Monkey. My mom was stressing out over a map, and my dad was swerving around holes in the dirt road... Likely regretting not getting insurance on the already aging rental chevy malibu. (And knowing his Nextel cellphone definitely wasn't going to get reception in the event of a flat tire)

For a few years, I'd occasionally bring it up to my sister, and we'd contemplate how strange that was... But as we got older, she denies it. She rationalizes and says it was just our young minds being creative in a boring car ride.
