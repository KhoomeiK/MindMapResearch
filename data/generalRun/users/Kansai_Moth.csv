They can do stuff PCs can't. They can break rules. They can ignore restrictions.  They act on Initiative 20 and Initiative 10.   

PCs are very powerful. Threaten them in a way they are not used to being threatened. Have the BBEG steal a memory of theirs. Tell them their locket has a picture of someone they never met. Their private journal references things that never happened. There's no mechanic behind losing the knowledge of having a sister. It fucks with people. Hell, just leave a pile of clothes in their campsite with a sword and have the BBEG tell them he removed Cormander the Paladin from Time because Cormander was the one who would slay him. 

Here's a good one from Matt Colville: I Knew You'd Do That. Have the players describe, but not act out, their first turn and then have the BBEG go first armed with this metaknowledge. If the Barbarian crits on his first attack then the BBEG moves out of his range on the first turn.

Wis Save. 

A target that fails its saving throw is unaware it has been affected by this spell. 

A target affected by *Horror Hunger* begins to crave disgusting foods and shuns wholesome ones. Within the first hour, regular food becomes unappealing to them. Must succeed a Con saving throw to eat normal food and not become sick.

After 4 hours, edible food is revolting and causes sickness; while rotting carcasses, maggots, entrails, and slime all become appetizing delicacies- attempting to eat normal food causes 1d6 Psychic damage and provides no sustenance. 

After 24 hours the target has truly embraced their depravity, and they know that will only be nourished by cannibalism. Every day that they do not feed on the bodies of the dead humanoids, their maximum health is reduced by 1d6. 

After 1 month, the target will only be satisfied by the truly obscene: self cannibalism. The target begins trying to sever and eat its own limbs unless restrained, and will viciously fight anyone who attempts to stop them.

Ultimately she moved to a different, smaller place in my neighborhood and i haven't seen her since. 

One time at the gym this guy (probably mentally handicapped) kept following me around and wanting to arm wrestle and wouldn't take no for an answer even after I told the staff. Then he grabbed my arm and wouldnt let go right in front of the check in desk and I almost, almost hit him because that is literally assault. I shouted at him to let go and shouted at the staff to do something but the staff girl just pretended nothing was happening. I had my company call the gym's manager and file a formal complaint.
