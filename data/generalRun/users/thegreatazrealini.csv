justdependathings,fglxpjh,t3_ez9zds,1580913488.0,"To start, you should’ve blanked out her face before attempting to post (I’m guessing the mods removed the image). Second, I hope you seriously reevaluate yourself and what you just did before you continue a serious relationship with this woman. Regardless of whether you were joking or serious, putting your girl’s face on the internet and complaining about how she got fat after you left is cruel."
insanepeoplefacebook,fgjkigk,t3_eyv74b,1580845924.0,"Some of these are correct and some of these are ish? Like how people who are terminally ill have to work or how diabetics don’t have access to life saving medication. Even how single parents and homeless vets don’t stand a chance in this society. 

But the part about losing a whole generation? I think people need to understand that older generations will always bitch and complain about the newer ones. I’m sure there were older people who complained about the generation that fought in WWII."
justdependathings,fgjdxeh,t3_eyn804,1580842018.0,"The time is 2256. CSC Smitty has been on. One of his sailors was found dosing the galley pizza with cocaine so he wouldn’t be the only one who pops on the ship wide piss test. Another one of his sailors is going to mast tomorrow morning for his third DUI. His phone rings, and he recognizes the number CSR Ryan, who is fresh out of RTC. He picks it up, and it’s actually the wife of his new shipmate, who calls about people, “making mean comments on her Facebook page.” 

CSC Smitty suddenly wants to retire."
AmItheAsshole,fgj8k4g,t3_eys642,1580839093.0,"ESH - Her living space is not only a hazard to herself, but to those who live around her. This includes her neighbors and her dog. Your friend very likely has other ongoing health issues she may or may not know about just from living in these conditions for as long as she has.

Can I admit you handled this like an ass? Yes, yes you did. But, as the same time, the job she enlisted you to do is more than just cleaning up a months worth of trash living. No one should enter her apartment without a hazmat suit or a mask and gloves at the least. I can’t put enough emphasis on just how hazardous this is (someone already listed the reasons why). 

My recommendation? Move her and the pooch out IMMEDIATELY. The best thing you can do is get her out into better conditions, and schedule a health and wellness check up with her PCM (if possible) as soon as possible. She needs to get a referral to a psychologist and/or therapist so she can get back on her feet. 

Secondly, I’m not sure how cleaning her apartment is going to work out. It’s very likely that the carpet and flooring are completely ruined and need to be ripped out. Even if you got it professionally cleaned, it still may never be totally clean as the floor boards could be rotted and covered in mold.  

The landlord will likely get involved if he hasn’t already; I can’t imagine that she hasn’t gotten any complaints about the smell. Worst case scenario: she gets evicted anyways. Best? She loses her security deposit and/or gets a hefty fine. 

I say give it a month at the latest before calling authorities. There’s a lot to unpack here. If she asks for help? Great. If she doesn’t, that’s on her. And if it’s still the same as when you left it? Call the authorities. She’ll hate you for it, but it’ll be better for her health and her dogs health."

insanepeoplefacebook,fgil8yg,t1_fgikocb,1580824861.0,"Honestly this ^

I hate how the mom just brags about shaving her daughters head like it’s good parenting. If I remember correctly, the mom actually had cps called on her for posting these pics. I don’t remember what came of it rho"
insanepeoplefacebook,fgil2ds,t3_eypt2c,1580824722.0,This is pretty old. I remember seeing this when I was in high school. Still awful tho.
AmItheAsshole,fgiil5c,t3_eypw6n,1580822731.0,"NAH - ultimately isn’t your business to intervene; that’s a conversation for your brother and his gf to have. Now you can tell him that you have concerns about their relationship and you’re afraid that this girl is taking advantage of him, but don’t take it any further by demanding he tell GF to get her life together or that they should break up."
insanepeoplefacebook,fggiie7,t1_fgg4czw,1580762576.0,"Again, why does that make the statement in the post above okay to say? We have a saying in the military called ‘perception is reality’. It doesn’t matter what you intended doesn’t matter as much as what actually happened. If you break someone’s arm on accident, it doesn’t matter if that’s not what you meant to do: you still broke their arm and you still have to face the consequences of breaking someone’s arm. Same with your comment. 

Did you intend to make a shitty statement endorsing racism? No, but that’s still what happened. You have to own up to that instead of arguing with everyone that’s pointing out how bad your comment actually is."
