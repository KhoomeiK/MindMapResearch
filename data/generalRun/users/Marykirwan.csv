depression,feng03p,t1_fenc4zr,1579283879.0,I have three pets. I think it might be a wall but I don't feel I have any control over it. I try really hard to make and keep friends. I force myself to keep talking even if I don't feel like it. But it's hard sometimes.

SSRIs,fcmy0jz,t3_ehvyua,1577797152.0,The best advice I can give is to taper as slowly as possible. Like take months to come off it. I came down a bit every week or so and then I got bad withdrawals (like anger and feeling extreme fatigue.) This is your brain and depending on how long you've been on lexapro your brain is used to having it. Go slow.
AvPD,fcarh0x,t3_egdzq8,1577575175.0,Oh yes :3 my brain just turns off. And I come off so serious.
