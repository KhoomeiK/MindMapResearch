pokemongo,fen3z73,t3_epygvf,1579276454.0,I didn't pay for the event last time but if they donated a portion to a charity like this I totally would.
Parenting,fen3stg,t1_femjet9,1579276343.0,Same. And when I was little I thought the phrase was bleshhhooo so it makes me laugh !
FunnyandSad,fee050f,t3_eol16e,1579023561.0,Sadly there is one about losing a parent or loved one to an overdose as well. Sad fucked up world...but at least someone is trying to help kids work through the emotions.

dogs,feavpub,t3_eo5ud3,1578952656.0,"We live in a city with leash laws, and this happens here too (Ohio). People are just irresponsible pet owners. They think their dog shouldn't be bound by a leash and it's infuriating, also the not picking up poo. 
But yeah you got your answers. Keep calling about them, if there are laws they will get fined and hopefully stop. 
The older generation around me however just keeps doing it."
