A “normal” Hgb level for an adult is 13-15ish.  (Variability based on labs)

This is for chronic (slow) blood loss and is very different than acute (hemorrhage) blood loss. 

In my experience, people who are anemic become symptomatic from it around 5-6, at least that’s the level that people spontaneously show up to ER saying something is wrong.

Depending on your other health problems, I’ve see people show up and live with levels down to around 3, but they are not well.  By that point their heart rate is high, they’re lethargic and short of breath.  Blood pressure is at least soft if not super low.

These are from chronic blood loss, such as iron deficiency.  But in America, the iron deficiency is a symptom and not usually the main problem.  They’re losing blood some how, causing them to use up their iron.  This can be from a myriad of issues, most common in my experience is bleeding from periods, or in the profoundly low, some sort of cancer or blood problem (like leukemia or bone marrow suppression from chemo).  

It is definitely life threatening below 5.

Of note, in the hospital, the usual number we will keep your blood level at is 7 with certain exceptions.  Active bleeding, unstable, and cardiac patients may be kept higher.  Studies done years ago demonstrated that people kept above a level of 9 had WORSE outcomes than those who were just transfused to 7.  These studies are often applied to all patients erroneously, as the studies were done in stable medical icu patients. 

This info is for adults. I am not a pediatric Hospitalist or hematologist who would know more.  And this is anecdotal as I don’t want to look it all up.   There may be people here who can give more specific answers

Also, as a general guideline for ALMOST all organ systems, you can lose about 2/3 of the system until it becomes a major problem.  This is a very rough guideline but gives a general idea for how much wiggle room the body gives. 

You can done 66% of a healthy liver
You can easily donate a healthy kidney and be fine with one.
You’re heart ejection fraction can drop down to 25% or so before it starts becoming a major issue
You can have a whole lung removed if your other is good.
I don’t know about Brain.
And as a bald man, you can lose half your hair before it becomes noticeable.

todayilearned,fg4lsu6,t1_fg4j994,1580505942.0,"Medically “necessary”.   The necessity of appendectomy for appendicitis is debateable but remains the standard of care in America but there are circumstances in which we don’t, it’s complex and a grey area. 

Elective appendix resection is rare.  But happens in some situations.  Like a tumor.   Or right lower quadrant pain and nobody can figure out why 

In Europe appendicitis is more frequently treated with abx is my understanding.

This guy is doing a really bad job tying these.  I would correct his technique if he were a student.  The knot was loose.  It’s called an air knot. If I tied this way in surgery, whatever I just tied together would leak. 

Thing surgical knots definitely takes practice but this is the way people who are not surgeons sew.  I very rarely do instrument ties like this because I can’t tie under tension very well.  One handed ties allow you to hold under tension.

movies,ffxxef7,t1_ffx4j98,1580334296.0,"Some dudes below you touch on it but here’s how it works.

You come up with a company.  Let’s say you think renting a cubical to people in a posh office space is something that people would want.  (Wework).  You have no idea if it will actually make money.
You sell that idea to investors.  Hell you can say whatever you want. “I think this idea will generate a trillion dollars and here’s why” 
You convince investors to put in 100 million dollars or some crap.
You start the company, taking massive losses.  Despite that, you take it public.  The public hears what you say and believes you.  They buy the stock thinking it’s going to go up big time, just like you said because you wouldn’t lie and surely YOUVE some the math. 
After 3 month lock out, you dump all your shares on the market, make 10 million overnight.  Also you collect your huge salary.  
Then the other shoe drops.  Mandatory financial data shows that this is not sustainable.  You’re hemorrhaging YOUR INVESTORS MONEY, not yours.   You’ve already made all your money by dumping.   Now the company goes tits up.  Stock holders have lost everything they invested.  Your investors lost everything unless they dumped all
Their stock on the public also.  Which they prob did.  

Board all takes their golden parachute.  Everybody made millions.  Joe averages 401k goes down by .1% and he never notices.  

we works ceo got 1.7 BILLION for a company that hemorrhages money."
