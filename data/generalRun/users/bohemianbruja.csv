a few times ive been on the other side and seen a girl cornered. I approach the girl loudly ""omg girl!!! I havent seen you in so long!!"" and hug them while whispering ""this guy seems weird are you okay?"" then loudly again ""my dads here too! hell be so happy to see you!"" only once was the girl not needing help but she hugged me back, said thanks and carried on with the convo. we got this"
offmychest,fe4lpnr,t1_fe1yt27,1578860591.0,"im sorry you've been exposed to this disgusting behavior at all, let alone so early in life. I dont know how brazen you, but these type of fuckers are cowards. if you find yourself in a similar situation again, wait until someone is nearby (employee or shopper, youd be surprised how many strangers will jump to protect you) and verbally draw attention to the situation. ""hey! you've been following me for 6 aisles and you're not shopping at all! I'm notifying an employee that it looks like you may be trying to harm me!"" I've said something similar and they have always panicked, and (especially when I was a teen) adults nearby would become involved. it's a scary idea, but calls attention to the situation in a way they cannot avoid.

I'm torn that the world maintains its disgust and cruelty, but I am so fucking proud of you for being aware. please understand these fucks are sick in the head and theres nothing you did that drew that sicko to you. wear your skirts, don your makeup, strut around in heels because none of that is a problem. they are and I'm glad u let target know because he will try his shit again and because of you that location is a safer place."
