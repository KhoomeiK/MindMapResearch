Mildlynomil,ff2ml7i,t3_eraxop,1579513448.0,"I have an 11 year old boy, we lost his father when he was 2. We lived with my mom off and on over the years, but I’m not posting about that. There’s too many similar stories to what you are experiencing so I definitely can relate. Thankfully I finally am in a stable home, an hour away from my mom. She did many of the same things yours did and still does. 

Last year I married a man who was already a grandpa. His daughter already had a toddler and she had a baby in August. Unfortunately my stepdaughter has to work a lot to stay financially afloat. I started watching her kids in November when the baby was 3 months old. I see a lot of milestones first and I know it bothers my stepdaughter, but right now she has no choice but to work a lot. I sometimes have the kids 70 hours a week because their dad refuses to come get them after work during the week so the kids are with me for 3 hours after he gets off work until their mom picks them up. 

I captured some “firsts” on video and straightaway sent them to Mom. But if it happens on a Thursday or Friday, sometimes I just let it go, hoping mommy will see it on the weekend when she’s home and she usually does. Then when they get dropped off on Monday morning, I get to see the excitement in a very proud Mommy’s eyes, telling me what the baby did over the weekend. This first happened by accident. One day the baby just up and grabbed the bottle from my hands without warning and started feeding herself. I forgot to tell her mom because it was such a hectic day otherwise. Monday morning came and I got to witness the proud mommy moment, excited how her little baby grabbed the bottle and started feeding herself! It felt wrong to take away the excitement by saying, oh... she did that on Friday, so I didn’t mention it. I don’t want to be the first to discover these things, I want her mommy to be the first but unfortunately that isn’t always possible. 

Your mom is sucking the joy of these happy moments from you and it sucks. She shouldn’t claim credit for the discovery, she should just be happy with you!!"
WatchPeopleDieInside,ff2l7sa,t1_ff2bd9t,1579511360.0,"I tried this exact method with my cat and my exes cat when I moved in with them. After switching rooms and separation, it never worked and I got sick of going through all of that. Chester was just a complete asshole cat to my Cletus, no matter what I tried. They were amicable over time. It took 8 months until they could be in a room together, mostly without issue, but Chester would go into attack mode for no reason out of no where. 

Time would tell that not only was Chester a jerk, but my ex was too. We moved out and I vowed never to put Cletus through getting another cat again. Cletus is more of a dog person anyway. His two best friends in life have been a German Shepard and our current  Black lab."
