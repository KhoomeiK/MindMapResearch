TheSilphRoad,fffnkcr,t1_fffclda,1579887797.0,Woooo! I am indeed happy for you and your family!
TheSilphRoad,fff8y1o,t1_fff72e9,1579878654.0,"That’s a bummer. It really wasn’t advertised well, I didn’t know until someone tagged me late last night."
TheSilphRoad,fff70h7,t1_fff4t1t,1579877321.0,You can’t.
TheSilphRoad,fff6zba,t1_fff66k2,1579877297.0,If you would have done it right at 8:00 you probably would have easily gotten all the tickets you need.

GoFest was unimaginable, and if this Safari zone is half of why GoFest was, I’ll be thrilled."
TheSilphRoad,fff4mzb,t1_fff3w1s,1579875583.0,I didn’t know what time they went on sale until someone tagged me in our local chat last night. Otherwise I would have had no idea tickets were on sale.
TheSilphRoad,fff4hze,t3_etai7p,1579875482.0,"I got tickets at 8:01, two tickets early access east entrance on Saturday. The process was extremely smooth and I only had to try the one time. I even backed out and had to look up my friend’s player name, and still had no problems getting back in."
TheSilphRoad,fff4b0u,t3_etape9,1579875332.0,Why is this tagged as swag?
TheSilphRoad,fff46dt,t3_etauuh,1579875236.0,"Got mine! Super easy, got them on the first try, and it went very smoothly."
TheSilphRoad,ffedgrs,t1_ffc9r2c,1579843992.0,"I expect an announcement in the next month or two, since it’ll be June or July most likely. I’m hoping for June again, the weather was so nice."

TheSilphRoad,ffed50j,t1_ffbo95b,1579843684.0,"Most likely there will be boosted shiny rates. I went to GoFest last year, and the shiny rates for all available shinies were absolutely ridiculous."
TheSilphRoad,ffed28r,t1_ffd1aoq,1579843612.0,Maybe 5 minutes? Based on previous events.

PokemonLetsGo,ffb943x,t1_f8bhqki,1579755696.0,I mean. The Pokémon is still in the game. You just don’t get credit for that walk of eternity.

plantclinic,ff88fdf,t1_ff6wqmz,1579669012.0,"I did this with a jade plant I rescued from work! Rehabbed it, made many props, and returned it healthy when I quit. Left all my coworkers with props, and kept a couple nice big props for myself."
plantclinic,ff8825i,t1_ff7dfgb,1579668689.0,I killed my pothos by forgetting it outside in the frost. Twice. (It survived the first time).
ketorecipes,ff4qe9a,t1_ff48bqj,1579569934.0,"There is *no way* this is actually low carb. Not with whole wheat flour as the first ingredient, and a bunch of carby stuff later."

TheSilphArena,ff4ommy,t1_ff479hx,1579568705.0,TOS violation is TOS violation. The photo in the post doesn’t single out spoofing.

I no longer put any stickers with much value on a Nalgene, since I haven’t had any bottle last more than a year."

dogswithjobs,ff3nwul,t1_ff3l95k,1579545085.0,Is it not possible to check if there are birds before hauling the dog up there? Or do you just do it anyway and take it as a good way to keep up training?
ketodessert,fewsa6w,t1_fewa575,1579418731.0,It says 1 cup *super* fine almond flour. Not sugar.

RealLifeShinies,femz19h,t1_femyhoc,1579273229.0,"I’m 100% aware where it comes from. But this isn’t for shiny Pokémon. It’s for other shiny things.

Like I said though, I don’t care. It’s better than showing me yet another ashy grey ladybeetle and claiming it’s a shiny ladybug."
RealLifeShinies,femwb6f,t3_eq09hc,1579271298.0,"That’s not quite what this sub is for, but hey, I’ll take it. It’s better than more pictures of normal colored animals. 

Is this something they do intentionally with the figures? Because that’s pretty cool. My guess is it’s accidental since its shell isn’t shiny."

pokemongo,fem6k82,t1_felzk0z,1579241541.0,I found one downtown in my very small town last spring. It means more to me than all of my GoFest unowns.
