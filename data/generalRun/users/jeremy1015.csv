DSPD,ffex9jo,t1_ffertv6,1579869206.0,"I’m traveling right now and am on my phone so I don’t feel like I can do your reply the full justice it deserves. 

I only found out I had DSPD a year ago. Been dealing with sleep issues and being sleep deprived my entire life. 

By the time I found out I already owned my own company and am the CTO. 

I have a seventeen year old kid and two more to boot so I’ve been living as close to a normal sleep schedule as I can. It’s always been a struggle. My wife does most of the getting kids up for school. Some nights I’m still awake at 6:30 AM so I do it then crash out. 

I managed in my earlier days by finding a job where I could come in at 10:30 AM without it being difficult. 

That meant that I usually scraped by on four to six hours a night and then did “makeup crashing” to get sleep sometimes. 

Sorry I can’t provide a blueprint for how to fully work around it. But software engineering jobs vary widely and are often more flexible than most. Eventually you can find one with more forgiving hours and/or some work from home flexibility. 

I wouldn’t disclose it during an interview but you can certainly ask them what their working hours are like."

It may not be fully clear from the image because of the dark color of the slate tile (I'm replacing it with sterile), but at the end of the hallways is a nice open area (check right where the traps end) that lets people stroll right into my courtyard, where there's (from Rimatomics) an obelisk and (from Vanilla Furniture Expanded) two EMP guns, three charge rail cannons, about 12 or so charge turrets, and all of my actual colonists set up with walls between them so missed shots often hit walls instead of people.

Mostly the only things that make it that far are centipedes and raiders who are on the verge of breaking. Only the centipedes usually get any shots off and the EMP cannons keep them juggled enough to minimize the damage.

RimWorld,fer0us1,t1_feqvfqc,1579348330.0,"No problem - this was mostly posted for people who use the mod to laugh at my luck.

Rimatomics is a very complicated mid to endgame mod that lets you harness nuclear power. Building everything is a time and resource consuming process (but super worth it, all your power needs are eventually permanently solved).

Unlike most things in Rimworld, you have to build the parts out in sequence after doing research at a special table and using a practice reactor to learn how to manage power. So, because I knew it would take awhile, I started digging out rooms big enough for final endgame state reactors and turbines and whatnot. The yellow and purple planning areas are where I eventually built plutonium processors and a spent fuel cooling pool.

As I was digging that last area out, literally as I went to build the final wall, I suddenly got an ""area revealed"" event, with an open to the air area JUST big enough to build a gigantic air-cooling tower (the big thing on the far left). Those have to be built in an unroofed, outdoor area, and as you can see I'm burrowed deep into a mountain.

There's also a targeting system for advanced weaponry called TACS that also has to be built outdoors, there's just enough room in the surprise area that I was able to build that as well.

So basically instead of having my nuclear power cooling system outside where theoretically raiders or mechanoids breaking through could get to it, or where a mechanoid ship might land nearby, I was able to build these critical infrastructure pieces completely away from any threat that might ever occur because ships won't land on constructed stuff and surrounding it on all sides is overhead mountain.

It's very lucky and has kind of turned this base into my permanent, work on it for twenty years kind of a thing."

I’ve missed one Ravens game since the franchise debuted. One thing I’d add about Ray is that he also just had amazing instincts about where the ball was going. And in 2000 he had Adams and Siragusa absolutely swallowing up the middle. 

But Lamar is more than just speed. Those pistol plays might just lead to a lot of Ingram running right into Ray only without the ball in his hands.

To make it worse, because we sat Lamar in week 17, it feels like it’s been just forever since we saw our team in action. Are they as good as we remember. 

The second thing is the fear of near success. When you get very close to a goal, the consequences of failure tend to magnify.

I'll never forget that because it was the first game I took my oldest daughter to. She was nine years old and she had been watching the games with me on TV for the last couple of years.

We were sitting down on the lower deck and she never stopped believing the Ravens would win. People nearby were actually getting pissed off at her as she just kept cheerfully chirping away about how the Ravens were going to win with us down 24-3 nearing halftime.

After halftime she started saying to me ""What do we need to do to win?"" and I'd do my best politely to explain to her how we'd need to get a touchdown, and she'd say ""Then that's what's gonna happen"" and then it would happen. She started pointing at the people around her and saying ""See? See? They're gonna win!""

The moment everyone began to believe was with a minute and a half left in the third quarter. When Ray Rice punched it in to bring us within four points, everyone was cheering like a maniac. My kid was all of a sudden getting high fives from people who ten minutes earlier were giving her death glares and wondering why children were allowed in the Bank.

Then after the ensuing kickoff she yelled ""Dad! What do we need to do?"" And I said ""I dunno, get an interception?"" and she yelled ""WE'RE GONNA GET AN INTERCEPTION"" and sure as shit they picked off Kolb's first pass on the drive. Our section went completely apoplectic. I'm pretty sure at that point my nine year old daughter could have screamed ""BLOOD FOR THE BLOOD GOD"" and there would have been human sacrifice in the stands with no questions asked. People were reaching across three rows of seats to high five her.

After we won the game on a field goal as time expired, complete strangers gave her hugs as they left the stadium. It's still one of the most surreal experiences of my life.

She's about to turn 18, she hasn't missed a game with me since then, and even now she'll turn to me and say ""Dad, what do we have to do win?"" with a huge smile on her face when shit gets real.

Harbaugh went all in on designing his offense from the ground up to accommodate his unique talent. The Ravens offense defies virtually every trend in the book to focus on maximizing our results with the talent we have. From playcalling to run/pass balance to unique formations designed to force defenses into leaving someone open (or a run lane open), we do things differently from everyone else - and that requires courage. Consider how this wasn't done with Vick, where most of his runs were scrambles, not designed. If a similar approach had been taken with Vick, Lamar might not have broken the record this season.

Additionally, and despite announcers hammering on this, I think people undervalue just how important the analytics thing is. Harbs reliance on analytics has changed the way our offense operates and our team performs. It's not just getting additional points by taking smart gambles on fourth downs. Chuck Clark led the Ravens in tackles this offseason, but with the lowest total either in a very long time or in Ravens history. The reason is because the defense was on the field for fewer plays than ever before. Keeping the offense on the field for extended stretches allows our blitz-happy cover-corner-dependent defense to operate with less exhaustion, which is critical in that it relies on speed."
