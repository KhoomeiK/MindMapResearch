Music,ffdwnz1,t1_ffdv3b3,1579830777.0,"Yes, and it's true that Sgt Pepper's was the first true ""concept album"" and for sure had a larger overall influence on music. It was a lot more daring and unique for the time. The best thing Sgt Pepper's has going for it is A Day In the Life, which takes the whole album up a few notches and to me, truly cements the whole thing as their opus (my favourite is actually the White Album but since it's so all over the place I still think Sgt P is their crowning achievement). 

MMT refined the whole concept, brought to life the trippiness of Sgt P and made it the focus of the whole album. It worked wonderfully. To me, they are very different albums but remain sisters, representing the whole acid tone of the Beatles in 1966-67.

It's hard for me to pick a favourite, they're all spectacular. If I have to, it's probably Blue Jay Way or Baby You're a Rich Man. How about you?"
Music,ffdtzu5,t1_ffdtcsz,1579828885.0,"Just picked up a copy of MMT on vinyl yesterday and I agree. It's a *true* sequel to Sgt Peppers, and together they make up the ""acid"" era of the Beatles for me. I fucking love MMT.

Rubber Soul and onward was such an incredible lineup of music. Crazy how much happened in that short time."

Astrobiology,ff3ghlu,t3_ereeet,1579540550.0,"Astrobiology programs are rare (the only one I know of is at McMaster university in Canada) so you'll be starting with general biology or astronomy. Personally I'd recommend taking a biology degree and shifting in your senior years to study subjects that relate to your strongest interests in astrobiology. That could be microbiology, evolution, or for astrobotany you'll want to take plant physiology courses. Once you're there, talk to faculty members who might be interested in doing a reading course and/or thesis project where you can do more personal research on the subject"

I think they know they couldn't take the US (and the gang) in a full-on war, so they fired a dozen missiles at a couple military bases and essentially missed, killing no soldiers (as far as we know). Then they threaten to destroy Dubai and Haifa if the US strikes back to make the US more hesitant to escalate. That way, they don't look like pushovers to their own citizens without having to resort to a large-scale conflict."
