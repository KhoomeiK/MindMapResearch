Edit: I totaly support the argument that we will save the world...with 100 years more time for sure. We gotta make that transition in 10 years or even less and this is what most people in charge don't seem to fucking understand. The last argument of the article kinda shows how we think today: Nothing can harm us, getting wealthier and wealthier is the way to gp and ignorance is bliss! Just like the romans thought before they collapsed.

Edit 2: The world needs creative people (the left) to change the world and conservatives (the right) to keep it running. Conservatives are now keeping a as good as broken system running and break it more and more. The right and the left should talk more.."

Maybe nukes become attractive on their own at one point (they are not today because you can not survive, no matter if you strike first or get striked first). Did you hear about the two asteroid heading our way? One got detected, they found out it could very likely crash and since then, nothing. Even the data doesn't get released for the first time regarding an newly discovered asteroid. I can imagine they don't want to hit the world with 'climate change is gonna kill us all' on the first page and on the second page it says '1,2km large asteroid hits earth in 2027'. tbh I still have hope when can turn this shit around but if a huge rock is heading our way id most certainly loose the last drop of hope..."
