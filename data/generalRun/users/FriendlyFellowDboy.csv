We've been raising since childhood to have pride in our nation. With that said, everyone has different reasons for thinking there place is the ""best"" and the truth is, it's all going to be personally biased lol. There is no greatest place on the earth and I think most Americans are very aware of that, but it doesn't stop us from being proud of where we grew up and what we are a part of. Nothing is ever going to be good at all times specially when you have so many people with so many different ideas in power. Idk if the world realizes that most Americans under 35 absolutely hate Donald Trump and would love for nothing more than to see him out of office.. Either way. The point is, to me it's like being proud of my Italian heritigage from my family's roots, but I'm also proud to be American because despite all the shit and nastiness in the world today.. I've lived and extremely peaceful life, and met a lot of kind people and I'm super greatful I've never once had to goto sleep afraid like some do all over the world.. I'm super greatful I've never once had to go hungry cause there's always been plenty to go around here.. I'm super greatful I've never been cold cause I didn't have a roof over my head. Idk what it's like anywhere else in the world, but I'm greatful for the things I do have.. and to me a part of that, is my country.

Yet when the good man, when he falls on hard times he gets.. maybe 200 bucks a month in food for 3 months, at least in my state... the dealer/addict gets free treatment, in patient, or out they decide. Free housing in a sober house, 100 cash from the state for w.e they want to buy a month, and 3 nice meals cooked and prepared for you buy the sober house daily.. you can stay there indefinitely, and I've known old men who have used it for a retirement program.. then you have the good guy again.. he can goto a shelter, if they have enough beds they will let him in but he can't come there til 9pm and has to be out at 7am. Sometimes they serve them plain grits in the morning and a cold sandwich of cheese and meat at night..

Anyway, it didn't take long to trigger addiction in my brain, both my parents were addict/alcoholics it like I was born for it.. after that, I thought about opiates all the time even when i didn't have them or anyway to get them. I kept thinking if I had an unlimited supply I would be happy.. around 23, I basically made that happen with heroin after a stint selling it to people I had been using with. I found out pretty quick, you eventually stop getting, high so much as you're just maintaining not to be sick. So now you're stuck with this disgusting i.v drug addiction and it only makes you feel good for 10 minutes max.. could keep doing it all day, but the veins in my arms were already gone and closing. It could take up to 30min to find a usable vein.. I'm rambling. 

When, I finally cleaned up. My family decided to just keep me in a sober house, away from a job and anyway to get cash money. They weren't wrong.. but this is what happened.. I don't have super nice things, but I've found enough side jobs to get the t.v and game system of choice, to rebuild my computer and put in a new cpu and graphics card. I'm able to workout when I want to during the day.. and not have to worry about eating fast food cause I only have 30min to prepare and eat.. I was able to build a relationship after.. 8 years of being single? I don't count the girls who slept me with because I would get them high for free. I didn't have anyone close or a friend I trusted lol.. my ""best friend"" roommate.. tried to steal from me all the time. He was addict, I expected it. Continuing on.. when I would meet with friends who were working 40-70hrs a week, and still only able to afford a room in a house.. which is the same set up I got for free from the state in a sober house.. they didn't have time, or felt like they did.. to workout, and eat better and try to focus on there health and well being like I've been able too.. It's not fair, and even I see that.. It's sad but not working in a factory or fast food joint.. has made me find worth in myself, not in my job or the money I earn.. but how I treat myself and others, how I respect the world around me.. and not everyone gets time to reflect and work on them parts of themselves constantly like I've been able to.. the past two years, I've been in an apartment with a roommate. My family still supports the idea of me not working even when I'm the one to bring up how bad I feel for not contibuting.. thank God for them.. they always tell me, everyday I'm not using im getting stronger and they couldn't be happier.. idk I've been really lucky, not even close to everyone gets the love and support I have.. sorry if this makes anyone feel bad, that's just been my take on not having a job for years now.

But my point being, is that.. my friends the ones who put in the most hours and think about money and where they will be in the future the most.. seem to be the most depressed and lack the free time they need to find a way out for themselves.. everything is focused on getting to work and getting home for enough sleep to be alright at work the next day.. a ex homeless addict should not be finding more joy to life, simply because I don't have to work for these things at the moment.. there's something very wrong with how our system is set up."

It wasn't a plane, it was barely over the top of the trees, with no lights and a perfect shape of a black rectangle against the sky.. and it moved, slowly. It wasn't fast at all.

It's funny to have the whole oral sex, vaginal sex, done thing brought up... cause that is most guys.. but almost every ex of mine.. got off in a different way. One through sex, one through digital stimulation, one through oral stimulation.. one could only get off if I rubbed above the clothes cause things were to sensitive without.. my point is, most guys are simple when it comes to sex, we want the same thing almost.. but girls, can be so drastically different. One ex couldn't stand the thought of oral sex, giving or receiving. I didn't know that until about month 9, when she finally opened up about it.. That's when I learned, most girls don't just openly talk about what they want, or how they want it. You either have to ask, or just figure it out somehow.. I think being more assertive can go a long way, or just sitting down and talking about what you want or how you want it.. I've never had issues with stuff like this in my sex life because I've always had the belief that being open and talking about things like that makes it better for everyone.. I get off knowing my partner has gotten off, or is getting off. I think there's plenty of guys like that out there, sex can be such an ego driven thing.. That's just my perspective though, and everyone's is different."

One of arguments being, that it's not actually that dangerous.. and no it's not. But that's like arguing you shouldn't wear a seat belt since the majority of the time you got out driving nothing happens.. not exactly to that extreme, but it's the same concept in principal. 

Another thing that is failed to be brought up. Is let's say. I do go barefoot today, just because this post really hit me in the heart or something. I don't have calluses like someone who has been doing it all there life would. A sharp rock that wouldn't affect them, would probably piece my foot and now we have the possibility of infection.. which also makes me think.. 

If your constantly barefoot than any little cut could become a deathsentace if it gets infected without proper treatment.. 

Either way. I don't think either one is right, or wrong necessarily but it's all just going to end up being biased, almost too biased to ever get to the actual truth of the matter."
