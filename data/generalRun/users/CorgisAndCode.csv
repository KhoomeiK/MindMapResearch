Vaping,fe2hcoy,t3_enhjsi,1578838382.0,I still love my old Sig 150! That thing's been dropped so many times and just keeps on kickin'! Great mod to have in a collection.
corgi,fdrkiry,t3_emupou,1578685765.0,"Aw, what a sweetie. Glad he is happy and recovering well!"
JUSTNOMIL,fdqxjzz,t3_emt4c9,1578676214.0,"Sending lots of strength and positivity your way. The hardest part is making a decision and acting on it. It's some scary shit, but you'll gain such a sense of self confidence and independence in the long run. You've got this!"
JUSTNOMIL,fdqpvrx,t1_fdqjl99,1578672320.0,"This was my first thought too! 30 days is awfully short notice if the landlord is selling a property. It almost seems more like an eviction of some sort, rather than the landlord simply deciding to sell the property. I bet OP isn't getting the whole story on this situation.    

MIL is a typical narcissist. Out for only what's best for her, doesn't want want to even attempt to do any research on finding other places to live because God forbid she have to do the slightest amount of work! Your friend lives in your apartment? Who cares? Screw his feelings and well being - as long as MIL gets her way it's all gravy. OP and his wife lose the income from the rental property, no biggie - MIL is happy to have her ass wiped and a free place handed to her without having to lift a finger. I *loathe* these types of people!    

Glad you took the reigns and had your wife back you up OP. The only way to shut these people down is to not feed their narc ways!"
marriageadvice,fdqgkhi,t3_emlssg,1578666130.0,"OP should post this to r/DeadBedrooms. There are a lot of folks there that will understand and sympathize with your situation, and be able to offer their advice."

marriageadvice,fdgidue,t3_el9n2p,1578398071.0," I encourage you to research the topic of MEMs (mother enmeshed men). Dr. Kenneth Adams is a great source of information on this behavior, and ways to try to overcome it. He's written several books including ""When He's Married to His Mom"".  He also has a YouTube channel (Dr. Ken Adams), and [website](https://www.overcomingenmeshment.com/) dedicated to overcoming enmeshment.    

Another YouTube source is the channel The Narcissistic Resistance. If you look through his playlists, he has several sections of videos about ""son-husbands"" (where the mother treats her son as a surrogate husband), and other types of mother son codependency. This channel was started by a man who has dealt with 2 narcissistic parents and started his channel as a way to help others dealing with these types of situations. Subscribers will send him their stories, and he'll respond with VERY straightforward suggestions. Not everyone will like his style, but I find it extremely eye opening.

tippytaps,fd4u5g4,t1_fd30vmu,1578171142.0,I was hearing the music in my head and wishing it was there too! Too cute!
femalehairadvice,fd4aqsn,t3_ejzotk,1578165865.0,"I have fine hair also, so I know the struggle. I really like the ""lob"" (long bob) styles. I find that keeping it around shoulder length takes some of the weight off. Avoid too many layers, as they will sometimes make very fine hair appear even finer/thinner.   

Dry shampoo is your best friend! I use it as a styling tool. If you work it in well at the roots and then just a bit throughout, it really gives the hair a lot more volume without weight or stickiness of other products. I also like a sea salt volumizing spray. You don't need a whole lot of it. I use the Not Your Mother's brand for both of these. Not too expensive, and can be found at any Target, Wal-Mart etc.   

If you want to try out some highlights, I always find that they add volume too. Just make sure to go to a good stylist. If you're not looking for too drastic of a change, you can start with ""babylights"", or a regular partial highlight.   

Hope this helps. Any questions, just ask!"
corgi,fcza60j,t3_ejkvn1,1578096785.0,Sending lots of love and healing energy!
relationship_advice,fcsnvrn,t1_fcsl7so,1577920685.0,"That was my first thought also. The friend is obviously gaslighting OP. The fact that he was so dramatic and then tries to turn it around and make HER feel bad just screams bullshit.    

OP go with your gut. He was absolutely in your house. Don't fall for the gaslighting game. Glad you got your keys back!"
bodymods,fcajnl9,t3_egs713,1577570472.0,"It really sucks this day and age that people are still closed minded about body mods (amongst other things). I myself am all for them. Some of the smartest, and kindest people I know have ""alternative"" styles. I know it can be difficult, but ultimately be happy with yourself. Those who mind don't matter, and those who matter don't mind!"
relationship_advice,fc9autp,t3_egq7od,1577549815.0,"Can you pinpoint what has made you feel this disgust toward yourself? It seems that you are a very respectful and supportive partner. Is it the fact that he had been violated in the past, and you relate that with him feeling obligated to please you? Maybe you're associating the two and that's causing you these uncomfortable feelings.    

Since you've discussed it before and made it clear that you'd never want him to feel obligation, and you're clearly not forcing anything, I think you are most likely associating it with his past. As long as you've talked about it and he's okay with everything, you can give yourself permission to have sexual desires with him. From my perspective it's the fact that you genuinely care for him, and would never want him to feel pressured or 'obligated' to do anything sexually that he wouldn't be comfortable with. He does seem to genuinely want you and is trying to initiate with you. That is perfectly okay, and you should allow yourself to be desired! As long as it's what he wants (as he's the one initiating it), and you're feeling the same way, then go for it. If he's truly wanting to engage sexually with you, and if you're worried that he's just doing it out of obligation, if you turn him down when he's initiating that may make him think you don't want to be with him sexually. I guess what I'm trying to say is if he clearly wants you, and you want him too, try not to associate it with his past experience. You're in no way forcing yourself on him. Go with the flow and both enjoy yourselves.    

You can always talk to him about it, just to clarify you're both on the same page. It never hurts to communicate, but it seems like the two of you are doing fairly well in that area. Did I make any sense? Hope this helps a bit!"

AskWomen,fc93lqp,t3_egppyw,1577546477.0,"Building and enjoying my dream home, travelling with my husband and friends, working in a gorgeous garden and landscaped yard, practicing my craft, hiking and adventures with my dogs, spending time with my friends, giving back to the community through something like animal rescue/rehabilitation and other causes.. the list goes on and on.    

Children do not define being a woman or having a  rich, beautiful life!!!"
relationship_advice,fc8ymns,t3_egqob1,1577544198.0,"Please stop blaming only yourself and putting all of this on you!! A relationship takes two equal parties, and tons of communication.    

I can feel your sadness as you describe giving up lifting and gaining weight. Please realize that lifting was something special to you, something you enjoyed and truly loved, and also helped keep you in great shape. Because of your PARTNER'S insecurities, you gave it up. While I can understand him possibly feeling threatened by certain things, he should've never asked you to quit something that was so important and beneficial for you. He should have left his ego at the door, gotten vulnerable with you and discussed his concerns and insecurities. He made the choice not to communicate, and essentially made you choose him and his delicate feelings (which he didn't share with you) over lifting. It's incredibly selfish and unfair.    

Of course relationships change and evolve over time. Our physical bodies may change also. Please hold your partner accountable for not communicating with you. Ok, so you gained some weight. If it was an issue for him, he could have gently told you that. Or even suggested that you go back to lifting to build both your self esteem and body back up. We're always responsible for ourselves first, I just want you to realize you aren't the only one at fault here. There seems to be a major lack of communication between the two of you.    

As for the intimacy issues. There are different stances on it. Some consider sex and intimacy a major component of long term relationships, and others just aren't as concerned with it. It's hard to determine your partner's exact stance on this, again because he doesn't directly communicate it with you. He may very well be ok with having more of a tightly bonded friendship and no intimacy with you. Then again, he could just be full of shit and afraid to tell you his real feelings. The only way to the truth of this is through clear, concise communication.    

Only you know what is best for you. If you're the type that seeks sex and intimacy throughout the whole course of your relationship, and he does not, then you have a big decision to make. You may be incompatible that way. You'll never be able to figure that out though without talking to each other candidly about it.    

All in all, ok you may have changed physically and may have some personal goals to work on, but he is also accountable for showing up in your relationship and sharing his feelings and personal needs with you. He's chosen not to do that all this time, and then drops a huge bomb on you. It takes two to tango.    

Know your worth, please stop placing blame on only yourself. Get back to doing the things you love and raising your self esteem. If you both feel that the relationship is salvageable, work on communication. I can guarantee that once you start seeing your worth again, things will become much more clear! Best wishes to you."
