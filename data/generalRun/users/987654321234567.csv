I'd recommend reading the actual descriptions in the article to see which might work for you. They're just above the Conclusion.

When you've decided which you'd like to try (maybe all of them?), brew the tea as strong as you can afford. You can mix them all together. Obviously keep the fish oil separate. There's an element of taste to it, like cooking -- some will go better together and others separate. 

Good luck. Sorry for your pain. Let me know how it goes."
WitchesVsPatriarchy,ffmwzeb,t3_eu7kqd,1580059747.0,"A few years back I started a herb medicine book, buying 20 herbs that were reported multiple times to have medicinal qualities. They had to have a specific ailment listed no less than 5 times, from independent sources. So, for instance, if 5 websites each separately said herb-x helped with headaches, I'd log it. Then whenever I or a friend or family member had  had any mild ailment, I'd brew it for them. The interesting thing was that a lot of the plants had multiple benefits logged, and often they'd overlap, in which case I'd mix them together. And I'd make strong brews. Like a handful of material brewed for 15 minutes or so, till the drink was strong. 

Well, I tested them out on my friends and family about 10 times and they worked every time. Going to keep adding to the list throughout my life. 

Not to mention up until last century was the British Pharmacopia (Medicine Encyclopedia) majority plant substances. Sure beats having a cup of tea from something growing in your back yard than a chemical pill which gives you side effects instead of added benefits."
