It is becoming increasingly common to see these ghoulish types on TV. Networks have cottoned on to the fact that people like her generate interest, albeit negative interest, but that doesn't matter to a TV network. They now only care about their advertisers and she and her ilk provide bait that lures viewers in, that is why she suffers no ill consequence for her inner and outer hideousness.

She is clearly devoid of empathy, and don't we all know what that is indicative of? Psychopathy, sociopathy or narcissism.

She is making people do one of two things in response to herself, you either like her (in which case, seek professional help) or you loathe her. Such a polarising character is good for tv ratings and tv ratings lure advertisers.
