That's a tough sell for a defamation claim. Public figures have to show actual malice (as it's legally defined). Likely, Clinton's comments fall under qualified privilege. ~~Additionally, there does not seem to be an exact statement saying ""Gabbard is a Russian asset"", which is rather different than a ""favorite of the Russians"".~~

There is a statement saying just that as u/therewillbeclay pointed out, but even still it's very shaky legal ground to stand on. If she wins, it will set a dramatic precedent.

worldnews,fejwy9q,t1_fejhblc,1579187748.0,"You're partially right. The Whiskey, Fries, and Anti-rent rebellions ended without armed conflict. They *were* armed rebellions, but there were no casualties. 

However, the Taos Revolt was both armed and had a militarized dispute. There were around 300 total casualties and it took place 14 year prior to the onset of the civil war. 

By insisting that the civil war was the *only* armed uprising and conflict, you're whitewashing the rebellion of hispanic and native Americans. You can argue that this was just part of the larger Mexican-American war, but that ignores the fact that the area had already come under US rule and US officials (making it a revolt, not a battle). Additionally, slave rebellions were revolts against the government. Slavery was legalized and protected by the US Government, not just the southern states. By ignoring these, it implies that the only revolt that matters is the one participated in by the white population.

And I would agree that the first  time white Americans en masse rose up (violently) was  to keep people of color enslaved and that is a sobering and loathsome reality.

Since the civil war, there were about a dozen other uprisings as well, but none en masse. Additionally, several of those *were* by white Americans fighting for white supremacy or, at least, aligned with white supremacy."
