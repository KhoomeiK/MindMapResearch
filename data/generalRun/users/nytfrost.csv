xxfitness,ff6cpar,t3_erwtjo,1579624326.0,2.5 mph if my goal is to work out for a long time and 3 to 3.5 mph if I want to push myself. At slower speeds I can go for an hour or more but at the faster speeds I get worn out quickly. I am out of shape though. Walking is my favorite exercise and I love running too but my doctor said running is the worst possible thing for my disc degeneration so that's not an option for me.
bipolar,fcx7rzj,t1_fcwkkl2,1578054652.0,Latuda 20 mg. Never thought I could afford it but between health insurance and their savings card is it 15 a month.
bipolar,fcx7p09,t1_fcwepwn,1578054566.0,"I started getting depressed around 8. As soon as I started to understand life and death I became suicidal. At 15 I was going to kill myself but stopped and told my principal the next day and got myself baker acted to get help. They kept putting me on antidepressants that didn't help because I needed antipsychotics until I was in my mid 20s so I went through school, college, my dad's suicide, a divorce, and working through all of it while severely depressed. I finally got on Risperdal that helped a lot but gave me hyperprolactinemia. Switched to a few more things then got on Latuda and it is perfect for me even at 20mg, the lowest dosage. I have probably tried about 20 meds over the years. I haven't found anything for anxiety but I have been using other methods to help with that. I went through trauma therapy to deal with my childhood and my dad's suicide. Now I am happy almost every day. When I'm not happy it is usually because I took something else that messed with my neurotransmitters like an antibiotic called Cipro or for some reason omega 3 supplements make me depressed too. I got a bachelor's in psychology and that has helped a lot."
bipolar,fcvuol8,t3_ej5vdj,1578010509.0,"I was having bleeding under my skin at 40 mg. I went back down to 20 mg and have been stable with no side effects for over a year. I have always needed 9 hours of sleep personally. 
If you felt stable at 20 mg I would see if your side effect goes away at that level. 
Sometimes side effects go away months after you have been on something also, as your body gets used to it."
GetMotivated,fcgvm5p,t3_eh6gex,1577644366.0,20 years severely depressed and suicidal with bipolar. Kept fighting and trying meds for 15 years. Got a degree in psychology. Found the right med a couple of years ago. Strange how different everything seems. I'm actually happy almost every day for a couple of years now. Healthy coping mechanisms. I can make good decisions and can focus on things like reading books again.  I can be around someone that is emotional without becoming emotional in response. Life is completely changed.
DaveRamsey,fc8nycs,t3_egouyk,1577538770.0,I use mint for budgeting but the best thing I've done for managing my money is creating a calendar in excel that shows everytime I get paid or pay a bill for the next year. Each month is linked so I update this month and every other month updates automatically. I used the one month any year template in excel and copied and pasted the month then made edits. I'm a data analyst so excel is my life but I think it is valuable to see how my savings at the end of the year go up or down based on the current spending.
