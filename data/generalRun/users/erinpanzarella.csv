awakened,ff77nxs,t3_erzpq2,1579642731.0,"I’ve gone through this mindset before but I’ve realized that there’s lessons on why I feel so miserable in a 9-5 job. It’s not the job- it’s me. I’ve jumped from place to place and only I remained. It’s the whole ""before enlightenment, chop wood, carry water. after enlightenment, chop wood, carry water,” situation. I struggled really hard immediately after i had my “awakening” or big AHA moments to exist in daily life. I went into debt. I quit my job. I alienated a lot of people. And then I saw how my ego is what actually drove me to do all of those things, not my spirit or awakening. 

No outside circumstance can take away from or create inner peace. I find myself definitely wanting to transition out of this career and apply myself in different ways instead of crunching numbers, but my day to day isn’t soul crushing anymore, its teaching me a lot of lessons and ways to navigate this human experience. And I can’t start a business without some funds ... this “shitty 9-5” has transformed into my way to create my dreams come to fruition. 

It’s all perspective. I hope you find peace in whatever you choose. Just be careful"
selfimprovement,fenz6r9,t1_fenxbh6,1579292979.0,Yep!! :)
selfimprovement,fen19xl,t1_fen0yqs,1579274727.0,"It’s a daily journey for sure. The confidence thing is still a struggle at times. But we’re always worthy- no matter what - of love and respect and a good life. It’s really about recognizing all the limited beliefs we’ve established over the years that told us otherwise. They are just stories. It’s not always easy to get out of those stories but it’s so worth it and so important! It took a while, and I still work on it everyday. 

Sending you lots of love on your journey. You should be proud of how far you have come!!"
selfimprovement,fen0z6o,t1_femyifx,1579274535.0,Yes so true! Glad it resonated with you :) thanks for reading
DecidingToBeBetter,felplg2,t1_felonha,1579227843.0,"I do know what real problems are. However I also live a life that is better than so many, and I recognize that. My dad died last year - that was a “real” problem. Losing a 2nd dad that’s been in my life since I was 5 years old which was 5 days after my 1st dads anniversary of his death and 6 days before my 28th birthday. It’s been a very difficult time. But life continues and as time passes - silly little things start to agitate you once again. 

Just showing examples of when the chatter gets so loud and I get overwhelmingly stressed about unimportant things, which I felt others could relate to.  Anxious thoughts about things that aren’t important isn’t something that I’m alone in. But that noise can get deafening regardless of how insignificant it actually is. And I do need to lighten up about it :)."

Also, I definitely gained a little bit of weight during my first few weeks quitting but I’m a little over a month in and my appetite and eating habits are back to what they were before and my weight evened back out. 

Enjoy that dessert!! I definitely did :)"
stopvaping,fdosg2x,t3_emblf6,1578611855.0,Yes I had a lot of phlegm up until a month after. It’s finally better thankfully! I quit Nov 24th. Hang in there!
AskReddit,fdlhtke,t3_elssvy,1578524327.0,That “from the get-go” was “from the gecko” ... damn geico commercials
selfimprovement,fdlckyq,t1_fdlc52a,1578521137.0,Yes for sure. I believe thoughts fall under “what we do” but I’m glad you mentioned that because it’s not very clear in my post. I used to think thoughts weren’t controllable in a sense but through inner work and exercises / taking action thoughts have definitely shifted. I feel the two go hand in hand because I know my thoughts wouldn’t have changed had I just sat there and thought about them... does that make sense lol?
AskReddit,fcjdrds,t3_ehg5ac,1577684077.0,"I was 16 and it was around the time my friend got his license so we all went for a drive. My parents were freaking out about my friends driving so they requested I tell them whenever that was the plan, but knowing they wouldn’t let me I decided not to tell them since it was only a 5 minute drive to pick up our friend and then go right back home. 

I called shotgun which was crazy rare since my best friend ALWAYS got it. I was super stoked. We got in the car and about a minute in I realized my seat belt wasn’t on and had some sort of eerie feeling and started to be extra alert in the situation. Maybe it was paranoia about not telling my parents but it was a really weird / somethings going to happen kind of vibe. Two minutes later my friend was looking where to make a right turn and wasn’t looking straight while he blew a red light and t-boned this other young girl’s car. I had screamed “STOP” since i was the only one paying attention and he jammed on the breaks and hit the other car on a slight angle instead on right on her drivers side. 

Everyone ended up being fine minus minor bruising since all the air bags went off. I really couldn’t believe we all walked away without a scratch. Both cars were totaled. I think about it every time I get into a car 12 years later and always put on my seatbelt / make sure everyone else in the car puts theirs on since had I not put it on that night I could’ve gone straight through the windshield given the impact."
DecidingToBeBetter,fac0jk8,t3_e8co2s,1575931666.0,"Just did this too!! Haven’t smoked cigarettes for a few years and quit JUUL a little over two weeks ago cold turkey. Had pneumonia in October and think it could be related to vaping even though the doctors didn’t seem concerned. Even after all the medications I still had this chest cough that seems to be getting better now. 

You got this!! I barely feel like doing it anymore. I just have been constantly hungry haha so have been chewing lots of gum and crunching on sunflower seeds during the work day. 

Proud of you!!"
