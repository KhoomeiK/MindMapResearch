1. Don't know
2. Don't care

There's not a lot you can do about the ""Don't care"" folks - just write them off as lost causes.

But I'm willing to bet that the vast majority are blissfully unaware that they aren't doing well. Nor do they know that there are some easy things they could do to improve. For them, the answer is to give them knowledge. First, they need to know how to self-evaluate, via things like DPS meters. Second, they need to know how to make good changes.

What does knowledge about ""good changes"" consist of? Well, they need to be told that BiS gear lists exist in the first place, and then be pointed to an appropriate one for their class. They need to be told which specs are and are not raid viable for their class (e.g. no fire mages in Molten Core), and then be pointed to a guide on how to spec for PvE damage and set up a rotation (e.g. Icy Veins). They may not know about the excellent strategy videos on YouTube. Find a good channel and assign the whole raid homework to watch the relevant ones.

Once your extremely naive players have been told they can do better and pointed to good resources, they will probably take it from there without a whole lot more prodding from you."

Modifications I make:

* When stepping forward from Down Dog, I plant my foot fairly far to the outside to avoid whapping my boob with my knee.
* Before twists, I lift my torso up a little more than other people so I can swing my lower boob over my leg.
* If I'm asked to lie face down on the floor with my arms by my sides, I find it is much more comfortable to instead do ""goal post arms"" on the floor, with my elbows out and hands flat, even with my head.
* When they say ""Place one hand on your belly and one on your heart"", I just put both hands on my belly. Because otherwise I'm just straight up grabbing my left boob, and that feels weird in a public yoga class!
