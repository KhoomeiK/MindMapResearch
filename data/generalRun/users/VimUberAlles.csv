ForeverAlone,ffbgou4,t3_es92r8,1579764495.0,"I disagree. It's already a path with no happy endings. There comes a point where nothing matters anyway. We will already have worse quality of life, we will already live shorter lives, and the idea we might become happy is laughable after a certain point. I say embrace anything you can even if all you have left is horrible negative emotions, at least it's something to pass the time with."
TrueOffMyChest,ffaqu6n,t3_esif98,1579742344.0,Yeah that's how I feel every year. All year. Until the next year. It'll be over in a few years for me thankfully
SuicideWatch,ff3mo99,t1_ff3hggh,1579544321.0,So youre complaining about someone not taking unwanted advice then?
ForeverAlone,ff35dvv,t3_er7vyb,1579534081.0,"The vast majority of it is charisma. Most people have some natural charisma that can at least attract some other people. 

This is why you can find people living with their parents who have no job but can pull multiple girls. This is what most of the generic advice is really about, its supposed to help your charisma, but for people like us, we just dont have any and trying to multiple anything with 0 results in 0. This is also why it seems like most people who get out are younger. Being a late bloomer is a thing but in my mind theres a cutoff point."
SuicideWatch,ff34t0c,t1_ff2rlyd,1579533682.0,Clearly he isnt looking for help? Do you think everyone who posts about commiting suicide is secretly looking for help?
SuicideWatch,ff341i8,t1_ff33ggg,1579533132.0,"28 here, i disagree."
ForeverAlone,ff2og81,t3_eqjjhl,1579516332.0,Peace out man
ForeverAlone,ff2od3q,t3_eqmmn4,1579516201.0,Yeah I stopped celebrating my birthday when I was 18 because it was essentially pointless. Happy birthday though.
ForeverAlone,ff2obdn,t1_ff2o687,1579516128.0,Well they can happen. An ME i know who worked for tesla is doing a sheet metal fab startup. But yeah SW definitely has the majority
ForeverAlone,ff2o866,t3_eqnces,1579515995.0,"Lying about it is the smart way to go unless you want people to put you in a box. I also lie about PTO, better they think you have a life than not"
ForeverAlone,ff2o2fu,t1_ff2o1iu,1579515753.0,"Okay yeah well, like I said. Still very much a dice roll."
ForeverAlone,ff2o0xm,t1_fexpk6q,1579515690.0,"The reality is that you can get hired, but what i have seen, at least in sw, is that you get put in the no social skills box. It means less opportunities in general, but not tjat you'll get fired."
ForeverAlone,ff2ny51,t1_few7neq,1579515569.0,"The vast majority of cs will still end up as software engineers. Now im only about 5 years into career, but I know enough other eng types to say that software is about the same, the only difference is that there is a lot of startup opportunity. Startups can have less toxic culture and be more meritocratic, but thats a dice roll. Big business is still all who you know even as software."
SuicideWatch,ff2ng8d,t3_eraoax,1579514792.0,Make sure you do your research if you are going to go through with it. There are websites out there that can give you some details on avoiding that nightmare scenario.
SuicideWatch,ff2n6im,t1_ff2lddb,1579514371.0,It really doesn't
AskReddit,felc7bf,t3_epj100,1579218757.0,"Age of Decadence. A very well written crpg. Its one of those games where you have to plan out your build and some people wont like that, but the post apocalyptic roman aesthetic is really damn good and the way you can actually avoid all combat in that game if you try hard enough is very cool to me."
ForeverAlone,feke3wa,t3_ep8ru6,1579198134.0,"Welcome to the life friendo. Hopefully you find a way out but until then, you have a place here."
ForeverAlone,fekdvf3,t3_epl1qa,1579197989.0,Happy Birthday man. Hey at least you can make it that far. Im out at 30 personally. I can barely make it now honestly
ForeverAlone,fekdql1,t1_fehkkn6,1579197908.0,After 25 you are probably fucked anyways the stats say. So yeah it's actually accurate
TrueOffMyChest,fed6q79,t1_fed5k7l,1579001520.0,"Lol truly I'm amazed at your inability to see how this looks. Yes it must be a mental illness. You clearly have the power to diagnose me with something that a psychologist did not. Amazing. 

So how long do i have to try before im allowed to give up in your dictatorship? 50 years? 100 years? How much failure until you would permit me to make that choice in your world? Guess what, there isnt always help for everyone. There isn't always purpose for every life. Therapy and psychology are not magic, they cannot save everyone. This viewpoint very clearly comes from someone who hasn't actually seen what sticking around for 50 years failing constantly is like. I have."
TrueOffMyChest,fed50gq,t1_fed3zck,1578999175.0,"Feel free to ignore this.

The core failure here is that you have no right to tell anyone else when they can give up. Your life is not theirs. You view of value is forged by your own experiences. You don't own anyone else and you you complaining people are weak because their idea of life and value is different is absolutely wrong. If they want to give up and live as a shell, that is their choice. Most people understand this, and when they get to that level, you telling them to have a stiff upper lip is already meaningless."
TrueOffMyChest,fed3r1o,t1_fed363z,1578997328.0,"I mean I'll admit im weak, im going to kill myself when I turn 30 next year. But let me be clear, it not because I dont acknowledge that i could put in lots of effort and make changes. Its Because i dont have the will and i dont see that itd worth it. There are people who dont achieve this until their 40s or even later. I, and those like me are saying the slight possibility isn't worth the suffering or the effort. Especially when you can go to foreveralone and see people who tried and still failed in the end. Yes some people succeed but the large majority of those people are younger. Look you can go read the pinned post on fa to get a better understanding of this mindset if you want it, but it all comes down to determining how long people are willing to struggle. Its about priorities.

And this is just me. I think most people realize it's on them to change and those who don't are those who can't see the value. This post is meaningless to that mindset."
TrueOffMyChest,fed2y1r,t1_fed2ou3,1578996140.0,"I agree, that fact that you havent read enough posts to see the responses where people say this exact thing over and over again and yet still make this claim does speak volumes."
TrueOffMyChest,fed2po7,t1_fed2ft8,1578995796.0,"The advice is fine on its own. Your complaint that people posting on here with the woe is me attitude is the issue. Again, that is the entire point, it's to complain. This is what you will find a lot of here, that's the nature of getting things off of your chest. There's going to be complaining. You are literally complaining about massively pointless shit right now.

You then responded with the massively flawed idea that people who give up must be content and that the complaining is pointless, which please refer to my other responses on why that makes no sense."
TrueOffMyChest,fed2cdo,t1_fed1wnm,1578995237.0,"Where do you want these. In the original post? In the responses? Either way that still isnt the fucking point. The concept of getting things off of your chest isnt always about looking for the solution. Its just about putting g shit out there.

As a point, I've seen thus same idea put into responses on here multiple times. Its not like youve come in and revolutionized this sub with this concept of dealing with your own problems."
TrueOffMyChest,fed27ea,t1_fed1tpe,1578995031.0,"The point is your initial premise is flawed. The idea of contentment stemming from surrender doesnt make sense. 

Why do i keep posting? That depends on the post. When i post here, I'm getting the feelings i have onto, well in this case its pixels. I dont see whats so complicated about that. Do you not understand the concept of getting feelings out there? When I post on Foreveralone, i do so to connect with people who have similar experiences to me. 

What made me act defensive is that in response to me criticizing your ideas, you went through my post history and attempted to use that as a way to fight back as opposed to defending your original concept."
TrueOffMyChest,fed1l02,t1_fed1iht,1578994093.0,"If you think the point of a subreddit for getting things off of your chest is exclusively looking for help, then you have clearly missed the point of this entire thing."
TrueOffMyChest,fed1e1s,t1_fed15lj,1578993809.0,"Yeah well since you read a few posts and thus are now an expert on my life let me tell you something kid, I did try to put some effort into my life and I learned that it wasn't worth it. If you think I didnt try hard enough why dont you go read the posts by u/IsaacValeAintReal, that guy seems to have put in a lot of effort to change over years and guess what? Shit doesn't always work out with hard work.

People don't exist in a vacuum, they can look up cases of people like them and see that it doesnt always work out. Maybe the effort isn't worth the minor possibility of success in the first place."
TrueOffMyChest,fed0y8v,t1_fed0rhb,1578993179.0,"So your opinion is that people who have given up are content because of that? 

I think this take is what we call a big ""yikes"".

Youre on an offmychest subreddit, people are going to complain about shit because that's the whole point. You can accept shit and give up but not be happy about it like my god.

Edit: yes, you ended that post with ""Its <current year>"", as though the fucking number on the calendar means jack shit"
TrueOffMyChest,fed0n8h,t3_eoit8a,1578992745.0,"So you are saying people aren't allowed to acknowledge that they have given up then? That they don't have the will to put in the effort?

Also nice <current year> meme lol"
TrueOffMyChest,fcgddjd,t3_eh74bq,1577638869.0,Well yeah. Isnt this the whole premise of that one Jordan Peele movie? The one with the hypnotism (can't remember the name).
ForeverAlone,fc9i4jt,t3_egpcmu,1577553012.0,"I'm good at lying, which helps since it hides that I'm not good at anything else."
ForeverAlone,fbdszhh,t1_fbd5rs3,1576770636.0,No I said there's no point. Again you say changing might make it easier but I have life experience that tells me even in that state I failed. So why change if it likely wont help
