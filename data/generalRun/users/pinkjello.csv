Parenting,ff63erv,t1_ff5znhp,1579618146.0,"Thanks for the perspective. It’s useful to hear. I’m leaning towards giving my kids an allowance so they can learn budgeting, and practice having an income their entire lives instead of just relying on windfalls from birthdays/Christmas. Maybe I’ll enforce a savings percentage... and in fact, I just had this thought: maybe I’ll increase their “allowance” by the amount that I contribute to their 529s. They’ll be forced to invest that money in their 529s, so they can watch it grow."
Parenting,ff5yxuj,t1_ff5qjcg,1579614711.0,"My parents did a terrible job of teaching me about money. I plan to read some books with suggestions before my toddlers are 4-5 or so, just so I can give them good habits. But 70% saving of each time you get money as a child seems super high to me. Despite not having a college fund, my dad did help me out with tuition a few times (like 3 semesters worth), and I did graduate college with only $2k in debt (this was back in 2004, though, and it was a very cheap school. I have no illusions about my own kids being able to do this when the time comes.)

I also need to figure out how I feel about a child saving for their own college education. I have 529s set up for my kids, and I instinctively hate the notion that they should fork over any of their money as children to this fund. They don’t even have incomes. It seems cruel, to be honest. I have a very good income. They have nothing. Education is something you need... I had the kids, I want to pay to educate them (through college), and then they can find their way as adults. 

I want to teach them about saving and investing and living within their means. But 70%? For financial contributions that are very severe to them as children but minuscule for me as an adult with a paycheck? Damn. I dunno, still figuring it out."

Parenting,ff584ef,t1_ff46bay,1579583032.0,"If you were saving 70%, when did you get to spend your savings? Or did they just accumulate endlessly and were to be spent on investments or true financial emergencies (which minors probably should never have)? I’m genuinely curious. 

Because I do believe in saving as an adult, or saving as a child to get something big that you want. But it always seemed completely pointless to me when I was younger to set aside a large portion of the infrequent cash I rarely came into. I understood that as an adult, I would likely have a paycheck, and getting money wouldn’t be a few times a year thing. But to designate money to savings when I didn’t have something in mind that I wanted to buy seemed silly to me. 

What did you as a child do with your savings?"

AskWomenOver30,felu4y5,t3_epsvv9,1579230995.0,"I’m the larger breadwinner in my family. I came from a “traditional” family, I guess, except my parents divorced when I was young. At the time, my dad made a good living, and my mom didn’t work. She never did end up making a lot of money. I was actually taught by my dad to grow up and be a “good lady.” As in, cook and keep house. He didn’t even want me to go to college. He was a bit of a male chauvinist. 

So of course, I went to college and became a software engineer. I still am an engineer and a manager now (unfortunately. I don’t love managing, but I do love money, so I agreed to it.) I make about twice what my husband makes. And my salary just keeps going up. My husband can’t really find another job... he’s tried. He’s doing something unrelated to his degree that he’s not passionate about. But it pays pretty well, compared to the rest of the country. I actually coached him and mock interviewed him and helped him get this job. It’s not my field, but I’m really good at interviews. I’m better at interviews than I am at working, actually. He’s got a great work ethic, but he’s hit the earning ceiling for that position. I doubt he’ll rise higher because he doesn’t enjoy the work. It is what it is. 

I really don’t care. I’m good at making money, and he’s good at doing the majority of the cooking. He also works remotely a lot more than I do, so he can handle our two toddlers for a bit while I unwind right after work some days. (Not for long, though, I want to see my kids before bedtime.) We just split things according to our strengths, and we don’t even really discuss it first. It just happens naturally. 

I never reference our earning disparity at all. We each bring different things to the table. Society values what I do. I got lucky. He works harder than I do (I’m pretty lazy, actually), but being a software engineer just pays more. We share finances, and whenever he worries about spending too much on something he wants/needs, I always remind him that WE make plenty of money, so get it. Sometimes I think he feels guilty about making so much less than I do. But the way I see it, if he weren’t around helping and supporting me and our kids, I wouldn’t be able to throw myself into my job the way that I do. I would probably be making less. And even if I wouldn’t be, fuck it, he’s my life partner. 

My husband and I are a team. Yeah, I’d personally love it if my teammate made more money, lol, because I do enjoy money... BUT we are extremely comfortable, and he makes a better living than a sizable portion of the country.

I think it’s really important not to do or say anything that might make your partner resent your being the higher earner. Because that doesn’t help anyone. 

I acknowledge that my zen attitude might be way harder to achieve if I didn’t earn as much as I do. It’s harder to have a good attitude if you’re struggling to make ends meet, and I do know that. 

I guess it just comes down to respect. Respect what your partner brings to the table, even if what they bring is not as much money as you do. Money isn’t everything.

Tl;dr Earning more hasn’t changed anything about our relationship, as far as I can tell. And that has been very deliberate on my end."

My point is that I spend so much of my over $200k just buying back time in my life. But you have people who are actually wealthy and buying real luxuries ... whereas I’m literally buying the time to spend with my young children. And we haven’t even taken into account buying time to maintain my relationship with my husband by getting a babysitter once a week for a date night.

Also, your calculations don’t include saving for retirement or my kids’ college educations so they don’t start their adult lives off in debt. Oh, I’d also like to put some funds away for emergencies like my entire hvac needing to be replaced, which actually just happened.

Also, cool mortgage rate, bro. That probably means you had enough to put 20% down on a 750k house. I mean, so did I, but how did you save up that much money? Didn’t it take years even earning over 200k? I know it did for me.

You‘d get me onboard with your marginal tax rate increase if necessities like childcare were pretax or I didn’t have to pre-allocate at the beginning of the year how much I expect to spend out of pocket on medical care, which is super fun to calculate when I have a child with a heart condition, so I know the floor but am just guessing at the ceiling cost of that.

Like, why are we talking about taxing people who are working hard to live their lives and be good parents, and not first only talking about actually taxing businesses and the ultra wealthy?

I would argue that almost everyone needs to make more. I’m just saying we should do that by taxing the ultra wealthy. 200k isn’t even remotely wealthy.

200k for a family of four is still fighting for table scraps compared to the actual high earners. AND if you make 200k because your partner and you work 40 hours a week, it’s even more ridiculous. The people who need serious taxing are those just sitting there earning residual income at cap gains rates without even needing a day job. I work 40 hours a week, so does my husband.

Wow. What adult or child would find this funny?

But other times, our son would immediately whine when it started. My husband would keep going and then he would look bewildered when it progressed to crying. 

My advice is don’t wait until your kid is crying or being sullen before backing off. Be empathetic and in tune with their mood. If they’re not feeling something, and it doesn’t NEED to be done, then back off. My husband finally got the hint when I told him, “[son] doesn’t want to do that right now.

Hence the appeal of boarding early so you don’t have to wait for your bag after the plane lands. It’s a minor inconvenience in the worst case scenario, but compelling enough to prompt some to want to board early."

I agree I’d get suspicious if she’s always doing stuff like this — getting really upset whenever she doesn’t get what she wants and then dropping it immediately when she does. But I don’t think we have enough information here to say that this is a big pattern for her. Also, have you never experienced someone legitimately crying in front of you who is okay a minute later? It’s almost like crying is therapeutic for them and doesn’t need to be some hour long ordeal.

I didn’t downvote you, I’m just questioning your conclusion here in good faith."

And in the past, before I learned to outwardly express empathy, it led to an awkward, emotional gulf between other women and me. It doesn’t help that my mom is the type of person who will put on a display of performative wailing at times. I’ve always wanted to distance myself from that. I’m in my 30s and have lifelong friends who have never seen me cry... I’ve also been through profound trauma and extreme low points in my life where I wanted to die. I cried a little at the worst points, but through the majority of it, nope, nothing. It honestly felt like it would’ve been therapeutic to cry. But at the same time, I hate losing control of myself, and sad crying is almost 100% that, so overall, I mainly feel lucky that it’s not what I feel the urge to do. (Oddly enough, I can tear up easily when happy while watching a movie or something.)"
explainlikeimfive,fcjr95l,t1_fcj9258,1577700622.0,"Um, I’ve definitely never been accused of having too soft of a heart. 

And you can fuck off with “the word problematic needs to die.” I’m a software engineer. I’ve used that word since high school to describe issues that may be problematic due to faulty design or logic. My association with the word is not social justice. 

I DO have a very cynical mind and am trying to evaluate this issue on its merits instead of my knee jerk instinctive reaction that obviously trans men have genetic advantages over women. I’m being cynical of my own biases in an attempt to understand the issue, so it’s ironic, condescending, and incorrect for you to suggest that perhaps I might learn something if I were more cynical.... usually cynicism (towards anything except your own gut reactions) tends to make people more closed minded and less likely to learn, not the reverse."

As for putting pre-pubescent children through hormone therapy, I’ve heard it described as mortifying for a child to go through puberty when they feel they’re the wrong gender. But that’s also not something you can truly reverse. I agree it’s complicated. I definitely don’t have the answers there."

However, I’ve read that when you take all the hormones that they do, their built-in advantage disappears. I have no idea if this is true or not. 

I feel for them because I don’t know where it’s appropriate for them to compete (other than in a class of their own, but that’s probably problematic, etc.) But purely for curiosity’s sake, I do wonder how level the playing field is. 

Also, I thought some trans men participated in women’s sports because they weren’t allowed to participate in men’s. I know I read of at least one incidence of that. Maybe it was the only one, though."

I’ve changed my stance. I now feel for people whose instinct is to cry.

When you say “statistically, it’s true,” you’re making an assertion that studies have been done. And they haven’t, to your knowledge.
