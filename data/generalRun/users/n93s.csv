TooAfraidToAsk,fffxg6z,t1_fffxet1,1579893923.0,TLDR; Australia is cooked.
TooAfraidToAsk,fffxet1,t3_etf0nq,1579893899.0,"Remember the fires in the Amazon everyone was worried about last year? They were roughly 900,000 hectares. Pretty large area. Well over here in Australia, according the bbc news since the start of July 2019 we’ve had 10 million hectares burnt. Now a lot of this is just bush land, BUT there have also been entire towns just burnt to the ground, people have been caught in the fires and died, people have been out trying to protect other people’s houses and died, peoples homes and livelihoods have been destroyed. In regards to the wildlife, estimates of a BILLION (spelt with a b, not m) killed animals are coming out. This is tragic and absolutely horrific for the ecosystem where the fires have been. Not only are the animals being killed by fires, but any surviving ones have lost their food and water supply and will most likely die from starvation as well. If you’re a farmer, and you rely on animals to survive, you entire income for a couple of years has just gone up in smoke. These fires are on an unprecedented scale, that’s never been seen in anyone’s life before. Due to a combination of heavy fuel loads on the ground, and dryer weather with little rain, it’s cause a near unstoppable force. Earlier (either late December or early January) the rural fire service deputy commissioner (the second in command for bush fire control) said that these fires are not able to be stopped and will only go out when it rains heavily enough. We’ve still got February and March to go, both hot dry months. So basically Australia is cooked."

A tub rack and fold out rtt would be ideal I think. If you got a tonneau that fitted nicely around the rack legs you’d get a near weather proof seal.  Sure you’ll have to spend a bit but you’ll end up much more comfortable every night you’re away"
