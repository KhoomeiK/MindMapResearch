Catswhoyell,ffv78wx,t1_ffv4slf,1580257350.0,He is trying his very best to yell! But his 17yo voice does not work as well as it used to!
Catswhoyell,ffuw503,t3_evcu53,1580250465.0,Adding that Timmy looks like he does because he's 17 and has kidney disease. This does not stop him from kicking our butts.
Rammstein,ffag3on,t3_eshde8,1579734938.0,Thanks for this post! I'm not currently in LIFAD and I'm going to be flying across the country (to my hometown) to see them for the first time in Minneapolis. I'm chomping at the bit and getting anxious! But it'll be okay. Thanks again.
dogs,fefro45,t1_fefpibs,1579063207.0,It's so true! I was lucky enough to have two as a kid and a dad who knew what they required. My experience with them and now at a shelter is that for every perfect GSD - our boy Caesar - there's one that's a bit bonkers - our girl Lacey. They were super bonded. She would run herself skinny in circles some days. Caesar looked after her and started to play with her at seemingly random times but as I got older I realized it was to get her to stop. They're part of the reason I got interested in behavior and now I'm getting my degree in it!
dogs,fef9rvw,t1_fef30wm,1579051534.0,"It's such a hassle but can absolutely be worth it! This girl is gonna be an awesome family member once she learns how to behave. My chin still hurts from Sunday's wallop but she was totally unfazed! Shes a wuss sometimes - didn't want to take her postsurgery pain meds even will pill pockets so I had to pill her and she yelled like I was yanking on her tail, the goober. I love her bunches!"
dogs,fedyq9y,t1_fedwcse,1579022709.0,"Same! As a student with a job, our 11-year old lazy girl is exactly right for our house. Your pups sound just like her!"
dogs,fedyc9w,t1_fedxszk,1579022476.0,"For some dogs, sure! But he wasn't planning on doing that. He was starting a new job that wasn't that flexible and too far away to come home on lunch break. This pup needs training and time - she was a stray that was found tied up in a mcdonalds parking lot with a box of her toys. We suspect that she was too much for whoever had her. She's one of those dogs that just doesn't know what to do with all of her energy and she'll need more of an outlet than he could give."
Rammstein,feduclv,t3_eomf78,1579020072.0,"Oh sure, after I moved from Minnesota to Oregon. Would be worth the flight to see family as well as hit the concert!"
dogs,fedtzam,t3_eomrod,1579019849.0,"We have a 1-year old GSD mix at our shelter right now. She acts enough like a puppy to qualify. She's hyper and needs a lot of training - she clocked me in the jaw with her skull on sunday and it still hurts, she's mouthy, jumps up, etc but we're working with her. The guy who wanted to adopt her had never owned a dog before, was starting a new job, and planned to take her on a 3-mile run in the morning and leave her at home while he went to work for 9 hours.

We managed to talk him out of it, thank goodness."
VetTech,fc7806x,t1_fc77nc8,1577499972.0,I'm so sorry :/ that's terrible. We have to consider money but that doesn't mean we don't do the best for the animals in our care. It sucks not being able to fix things - it's so frustrating. I'm sorry again.
