todayilearned,ffskcsm,t1_ffsb1w6,1580183848.0,"Radon levels fluctuate somewhat seasonally anyway. So yes, if you’re around that level you can spend the money on another test or just put it toward a mitigation system ($800-1000 in my area; we don’t mitigate - conflict of interest) and be done. 

As someone who measures residential radon, I’m less concerned about the homes that hover around 3-5 pCi/L than the ones at 10, 20 or more. Those really get your attention. I’ve measured as high as 47. But mitigation works, even on high levels. Simple and effective. 

And true professionals never use “store bought” kits. At least I don’t."
todayilearned,ffshpas,t1_ffsd5uf,1580181964.0,Not really. I wouldn’t trust them within two points either way. It’d give you a ballpark I guess.
todayilearned,ffs55x2,t1_ffs3woq,1580173399.0,That is exactly what I charge for most homes.
todayilearned,ffrr13p,t1_ffroh3l,1580163908.0,Home test kits are good for a general idea but can be off by a couple of points. That can lead to a false level of comfort if it tests at 3.0 (below 4.0 action level) when it really might be 5.0. If it’s close either way it’s best to have a professional test done.
todayilearned,ffrqtm4,t1_ffrnkcs,1580163776.0,"False. Radon comes out of the ground which is why you test the lowest living space (basement or above the crawlspace/slab. Any structure that comes into contact with the ground can have radon. It has a half life of 3 1/2 days so it doesn’t accumulate. After that it turns into radon by-products or progeny.

KitchenConfidential,ffg5f0i,t3_etfen3,1579898838.0,Cool. So do I knock 3% off of the server's tip? Or do I just have to keep paying more and more since the owners don't pay for it? Not sure how this works.
fuckHOA,ffflyvh,t1_fff9u1n,1579886827.0,"This is the correct answer. I do FSBO's and pay a Realtor $500 to help with the paperwork. Same outcome, more money in my pocket."

jayhawks,ffdm6h5,t1_ffdbeq3,1579823835.0,Yep. If one team is going to play until the buzzer then the other team can too. Careful what you wish for. The block was not an inappropriate reaction to the steal. Everything after though...

jayhawks,ff9wp3g,t1_ff8uyaf,1579723152.0,"True but Kansas is clearly not without fault here. Yes, that was a bullshit move by K-State in the last seconds of a game where they're down by 21 points on an opponent's court. But this is Kansas. We're supposed to be better than that. And De Sousa of all people should be going out of his way to keep his nose clean after being suspended for a year and winning his appeal to come back a year sooner. Best second chance he'll ever get. And he fucking blew it. I doubt he'll suit up again as a Jayhawk. Yeah, K-State sucks but Kansas is supposed to act like we've been there before. The whole thing is embarrassing and unnecessary."

aww,ff31wqh,t1_ff318la,1579531515.0,"The point is that sheep dogs were bred to herd sheep and centuries of that behavior has become instinct to them. So when they're not around sheep they will still ""herd"" children. They weren't bred to herd children, but it's now an instinct to herd anything. You can apply this to characteristics of other breeds, generally speaking, which I think is what u/throughthepark was trying to get across. But each animal is different and their behavior is mostly a result of their environment and training."
