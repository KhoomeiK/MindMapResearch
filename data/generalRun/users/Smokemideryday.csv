Jokes,fffshgs,t1_ffeywr4,1579890826.0,"I wouldn't say that, while I wholeheartedly believe you aren't a racist, there are bad people of every kind, including police. They get a bad rep because some police do bad things, like that LA police officer caught on bodycam fondling a dead woman. The real issue that causes most people to dislike police is the fact that most of the time when we hear stories like that, the police officer is hardly reprimanded if at all. It's a systematic issue that, while you yourself aren't a problem, but the problem is much bigger than you. I know plenty of good cops, I also know a girl who left the police station crying because they didn't believe she was really raped and grilled her for it."

Operator skins have caused quite an uproar in the community due to exploits which made it hard to spot certain operators in certain spots. The SG and AUG are back to their original price with a price drop of 200 to both sides cheaper rifles (Famas:2050 Galil:1800). Along side this change they got a decrease to their spray randomness values, making using their spray patterns significantly more effictive, however the patterns didn't change. Aside from that I don't know exactly at what point you stopped playing and what's changed since then, but nothing gamebreaking. If I'm forgetting anything in the last 6 months, I'm sure someone will be quick to correct me."

Cock and ball torture (CBT) is a sexual activity involving application of pain or constriction to the male genitals. This may involve directly painful activities, such as wax play, genital spanking, squeezing, ball-busting, genital flogging, urethral play, tickle torture, erotic electrostimulation or even kicking.[1] The recipient of such activities may receive direct physical pleasure via masochism, or emotional pleasure through erotic humiliation, or knowledge that the play is pleasing to a sadistic dominant. Many of these practices carry significant health risks."
