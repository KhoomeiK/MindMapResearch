tennis,fgnlid2,t1_fglfanu,1580947420.0,"And three semis: Wimbledon 2003, AO 2007, and AO 2009, plus a QF. I think Andy wins Wimbledon 2003 against philipousis in the final. 2009 AO Nadal would wreck Andy. Gonzales in the final at AO 2007 is a tossup. Andy is the better champion overall, but Gonzo was on fire, so he might have taken it."

TooAfraidToAsk,ffrdo64,t1_ffqlkh6,1580155945.0,"Selection bias. Almost all media is created by people who are writers, drama, theater, artists in general. People who are more likely to think an office job is the worst thing in the world. People who think everyone wants to move to Hollywood to be a writer/actor/whatever.

I just thought it was a self contained miniseries with a beginning and end. I would have been totally ok with it ending the way it did, with Will coughing up that weird slug thing, and the vision of the weird monster thing outside. Sometimes you don't need a conclusion, it's ok to just leave people hanging."

Yes you are. Or maybe just naive, inexperienced, whatever. You are freaking out because someone tried to give you a handy. Your balls will be fine (have you really never jerked off with oil before? If you’ve only ever used lotion you need to try oil, it’ll change your life). It’s really not a big deal, except for the shakedown at the end. Relax and move on with your life, yeesh."

It’s not an ideal situation for a dog right now, my lifestyle is too hectic, but she’s a rescue and I kind of got suckered in so this is it is for now. I never wanted a house and yard, but the idea of opening the back door and letting her run in the backyard, instead of putting on boots and a coat and walking down the stairs with a poop bag...that’s like the height of luxury..."

I remember very clearly when I was a kid, you used to walk around and see frost on dog shit. We would dare each other to pick it up, and some kid always would, then he would throw it on the ground or at someone, and we would laugh as it exploded into shards of frosty icey dog doo. Gross I know but we were kids, and cold weather was a huge novelty for us.
