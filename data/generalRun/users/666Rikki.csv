cats,fdnnlvo,t1_fdnao68,1578589524.0,"Good point, but the post says to be concerned only when the cat is doing this and awake. The OP's cat is sleeping so I don't think it applies."
cats,fdnn85j,t3_em8ob9,1578589307.0,"Yes! My grandma's cat sleeps like this all the time and I have been wondering what the heck?? How is that possibly comfortable when she can hardly breathe? :'D 

It's fun to know my grandma's cat is not the only nerdy one!"
FromKittenToCat,fdnixgq,t3_em2czy,1578586771.0,Wow he turned into a fuzz ball! I have a similar kitten with silver undercoat! I am super excited to see how he turns out when he grows up!
Asphalt8,fdk0n8s,t1_fdhhqm6,1578493105.0,It's just weird we are getting the coins back though. It's as if the ultimate cars were given to us for free??
Dogtraining,fdgqr5w,t3_el2nc6,1578405866.0,"Have the same toy and it has lasted a long time, my dog actually really enjoys this toy and the way it squeaks! Dogs can tear anything up if you don't supervise them and don't teach them good puppy manners with toys. I mean sure, toys are for chewing and playing, but they shouldn't be destroyed during the play-time. I find it's important to teach a dog some toy-playing etiquette. I always supervise my big dog and make sure she will squeak the toy gently and bring it to me when we play fetch. Any indication of destruction towards the toy and I take it away until she is calm again."

cats,fcaedsi,t1_fca35hy,1577567806.0,I will make sure to post more as he continues to grow up! :)

cats,fc6sed1,t1_fc6jpoj,1577488283.0,I have no idea actually! I was wondering that myself. I adopted him from the local shelter so not sure what breed he might have in him!
