The only situation where aphelios can 1v1 a zed like this is one where the zed goes in recklessly without considering the amount of chakrums aphelios has, and frankly you deserve to lose if you go in on a aphelios with 20 stacks. Would be like going in on a illaoi just after she's ulted at full hp."
leagueoflegends,fgfbb1b,t1_fgf9942,1580733213.0,"They REALLY can compare. The really obvious comparison is the Darius one. Stack hemorrhage to 5 and you'll get huge damage. Except with aphelios, it's situational how you can stack your chakrums since you might not have the right weapons at the time, or they can simply disengage for 5 seconds to let your chakrums dissappear. You're foolish to go in on aphelios like this with so many chakrums"
leagueoflegends,fgfb33l,t1_fgf41a9,1580732987.0,"...except he did, he had severum and chakrum at start, used up the severum to get the other chakrums with the ability, which traded in severum for calibrum.

leagueoflegends,fgfaatv,t1_fgf9y9d,1580732133.0,"Correct, the gravitum is the only weapon which won't grant more chakrums on hit. Infernum and severum will grant the most, depending on situation"

BetterEveryLoop,fg65lvo,t1_fg5yky7,1580554838.0,"Actually the mentality that let Hitler rise to power was that the Jewish people were almost universally distrusted and not liked throughout Europe at the time, which led to his hate for them and his acts being tolerated for as long as they were."

leagueoflegends,ffj803m,t1_ffiw4kr,1579992663.0,"I just want to point out that as someone who has been climbing by playing a lot of aphelios and twitch, nocturne is IMO currently aphelios's biggest counter pick. He's given me the most trouble out of anyone I've played against easily, mainly because aphelios literally has no way of getting away from him once he jumps on you, assuming he doesn't straight oneshot you. You can try and root him with the gravitum, but he can spell shield it, you can't run because of his q trail making him fast. Tbh if nocturne does decently in early game he presents a major problem for aphelios late game. 

I actually specifically ask for tank supports with cc such as thresh, blitz, Leona, nautilus when I play aphelios because of nocturne or strong rengar's, who are a lesser problem but still a serious issue."

NoStupidQuestions,feuu2tt,t1_fesuiz6,1579389913.0,"No I wouldn't say it is. While yes, there is a well known phenomenon where people who are in fact not intelligent believe themselves to be very intelligent, I think it's easy to tell the difference between someone like that and someone who is truly intelligent. 

Take me for example. At first glance I might not seem too smart, I'm M,21 and work in a local shop in the middle of a rural town in England on the tills, and have for the past 2 years. People may assume I'm dumb because of this. What they don't know however is how I came to be there.

2 years before I started working in that shop I was doing an apprenticeship with a international company and I guarantee you will have some of their products in your house. It was an applied science apprenticeship and was rather contested. In fact I was told by my supervisor he had heard from my manager that 120+- people applied for the one spot that I got. 

So what happened? I started falling asleep in the Lab and at my desk. And in meetings. A lot. I did great work so my manager did everything she could to avoid disciplinary procedures, but at the end of the day, I worked with very strong acids, and mechanical equipment. And clearly that is not a good combination. 

Nearly 2 years after I started and 2 months before I was due to finish my apprenticeship, I was displaced from my placement. Luckily I was able to finish the apprenticeship at my dad's company, with a distinction*. 

By this point it was the start of summer 2017. I got a suggestion from a close friend at the time that it could be Narcolepsy, as it sounded like it had similar symptoms. I mulled it over and it occurred to me she was right, so I talked to my parents about it, however it had apparently already crossed their mind, but they didn't want to mention it as it is a life changing disorder. 

At the end of the day though, it was important to know. Despite my GP disagreeing with me that it could be Narcolepsy, I went to talk to a specialist he referred me to. She then booked me the test. It was indeed Narcolepsy, rather severe as it comes. 

Hence why I work as a cashier. I've been sorting out medication for the multiple symptoms of narcolepsy, I cannot drive due to it, so the shop being 10 minutes from my house is convenient as hell for me. I must say also, being a scientific guy, and not a social butterfly, working as a cashier has HIGHLY increased my ability to socialise. 

I intend to move on from my position within a few years, hopefully into a position which would let be get back into the lab work field, as I very much enjoyed my apprenticeships first placement."

leagueoflegends,fectq7a,t1_fecoxqg,1578984250.0,"Pretty sure just about every champion in the game has a point where they cease to have a weakness. It's a perfectly fine way to have a champion balanced, assuming they also have low points"
leagueoflegends,fecoo75,t1_fecmxx6,1578979287.0,"except he doesn't always have chakram, and even with it he needs the severum/infernum to even have a chance of doing that. So if he's doing that to you, it was a bad time to engage. He absolutely has high and low points you can exploit"
AskReddit,fece02f,t1_fecde5r,1578971664.0,I would have thought the only way you could be prosecuted for not disclosing is if you specify a dark room then use a strap on if you have a vagina or similar.

DestinyLore,fecbkxf,t3_eobquf,1578970204.0,"I don't think anyone's actually answered what you're after yet so I'll try to do that. 

Being that Mara went into the Distributory during the start of the Collapse, only decades actually passed outside the distributory by the time they came back out and settled within the reef. They then had their schism where a splinter group of awoken decided to go to earth. I expect zavala was one of these, judging by the crashed ship. This leaves a solid time period between when zavala could have died and when the last city was fully built."
leagueoflegends,feb5w19,t1_fea42o4,1578955743.0,"To be honest, I actually disagree with the chakram point. Simply because it's situational to get that huge damage. The only ways to get significant numbers of chakrams are by q'ing a big minion wave or group with infernum, or to q with the severum. If you happen to have the other two guns at the time, you're shit out of luck in the fight. 

Turret needs to have that capability, otherwise it would 100% be useless. 

Granted infernum ult was overtuned and has now been fixed 

The good thing about his ultimate is it was extremely adaptable to situation. You have either a heal, a 99% slow, a damage boost, a powerful aoe burst and a mark for the sniper."
leagueoflegends,fea3c9j,t1_fea2stp,1578943914.0,"Granted the secondary weapon is communicated badly

That's why there are free champs every week, so you can try out new champions when they become available and get to understand them."
leagueoflegends,fea2fil,t1_fea1l0b,1578943696.0,"Except they're not random times, you can control when you have each weapon and effect available, and imo it's a necessary skill for a good aphelios to be able to macro that. 

Visually I think it's just that he's only just came out that people find it hard to tell what weapons he has etc, I personally have no problem being able to tell what the opposing aphelios has. 

Frankly if you don't know what the champion can do, that's your own mistake, in not looking it up. It's honestly not that hard to get your head around. Took me maybe 2 games of playing him."
leagueoflegends,fea1dcl,t1_fea11sw,1578943318.0,"Tbh when it comes to designs I like aphelios', it's very unique, and twitch is one of the older champions in league, so it kinda makes sense he's not the best design."
leagueoflegends,fea0xwo,t1_fea0pvh,1578943214.0,"I've found Twitch is a very safe pick at the moment in lane, and once he hits 3 items he can pretty much 1v5 if he's positioned right."
leagueoflegends,fea0bdr,t1_fe8vyf7,1578943077.0,"Yeah caits a bit of a pain in laning with him, but after she becomes a bit of a joke because he does so much more damage later with the crescendum.

leagueoflegends,fe8uyfj,t1_fe8snaz,1578931186.0,"I'm level 5 on him, if you've not used the q you're playing him wrong, it gives 5 stacks on his crescendum, and the ult is good for a quick health boost when necessary"
