Second, this is a small minority of states, and I personally disagree with the practice. [Most states, however, don't allow abortions past either 20 weeks or viability](https://www.businessinsider.com/latest-point-in-pregnancy-you-can-get-abortion-in-50-states-2019-5)"

You mean except for the child that doesn't get born into a family that doesn't want it, or the parents that might not be able to afford the kid?

>because if we're looking at our birth replacement rates for Social Security and Medicare, it isn't going to be us.

The abortion rate is around 15%, and research has shown that this doesn't go down if you ban or discourage it. No, the best way to lower abortion rate is to lower the rate of unwanted pregnancies by making contraception either very cheap or free, and giving kids comprehensive sex ed from a young age."

Now, if we say that someone has died when their brain stops working, why isn't the opposite true? That human life only starts whenever there's a working brain? After all, the brain is what makes us humans alive and, well, human.

This is the fundamental difference between abortions and anti vaxxers. Anti vaxxers risk the lives of not only their own kids, but of every unvaccinated (for any legitimate reason) and some of the vaccinated kids around them (vaccines aren't 100% effective). Meanwhile, an abortion removes a fetus, that can only barely be classified as a living human, doesn't provide a risk for the people around them. It's a personal choice for the parents to make, and only theirs"

Except that the photo was taken from Lunar orbit, not from the surface itself. From orbit, it's quite easy to take a photo of earth in a rising position.

>Not to mention, it is proclaimed that the earth is 1/3 to 1/4 the size of the moon. So the size is off again.

What? Earth is around 4 times larger than the moon, not the other way around. And it looks about right compared to moon pictures to me.

>if you can see the shadows on the moon from earth, then why can you not get a clear shot of the contents and it just look like a blue ball with no land on it?

Actually, if you look closely you *can* see land, more near the bottom of the earth there's some sort of desert? There's also some green land off to the left of it."
