dogs,ffurl3f,t1_ffun8x2,1580248009.0,"I agree. Though, when redirecting a displacement behavior and reward, Tigs did start doing the behavior and then looking at me to see if I saw him stop on his own and start doing it again. I may have inadvertently turned a displacement into an intentional action for me to tell him to leave it or get a food scatter. (He nibbles on the couch/bed, when Mars wants to play and he doesn't or when I tell him to leave the cats alone.)

I come more from the psychology background more than animal science. I'm more inclined to say certain emotional responses aren't really going to be reenforced, but nervous habits may. I won't be afraid of spiders more because I got an ice cream, but if biting my nails gave me ice cream, I may do it just to get some."

My step daughter wants to train for a living and her final project is getting a dog familiar with training to jump through a hoop and bow. That's *still* a huge project and is expected to take two months, at least.

You need to start smaller. Click and treat when he gives you attention, that's where you should start. You're best training him to go to place where he lays on a bed without the rest if it's such a short time frame. Even that's a stretch, two weeks of 30 minutes is not a lot of time."

Don't be afraid to move on from a command though, even if it's basic. It's not a failure if a dog struggles with a basic thing and you skip it, especially something like paw, but I definitely understand. Tigs won't lay down, which is highly embarrassing. I wasted so much time trying to get him to do it. He still won't, it's been a year of trying. If he does he gets up the second he can, so a down stay is never going to happen. We've moved on. He can't lay down but he can turn off the lights.

Mars: training clicked and he realized doing things means reward, so he keeps doing them to solicit treats seeing we tried free shaping instead of a lure. He keeps repeating the last things he learned without realizing rewards only come for the cue. Unfortunately, my step daughter taught him speak and stand last, so he sits at my feet, stares at me, and barks, then stands placing his paws on my shoulder and stares at me intensely face to face. Lord help me. At least he's motivated enough he listens consistently now.

My dogs didn't deserve the situation that lead them to me, but it's the world that exists. I don't deserve to have had a financial emergency that made me have to stretch $50 three months, unable to afford an emergency, but it happens. This persons dog didn't deserve to be a street dog who would die without a companion, so what if that person is poor, it beats the prior life. 

If it's not helpful and potentially makes the situation worse, why say it? Everyone is doing they best they can in an imperfect world where things happen that shouldn't. We know they're living creatures, if we didn't we wouldn't love them and root for them. I know you don't mean to be rude, you're motivated by love too. If there wasn't an abundance of dogs that need help, half of us wouldn't have them because those who could afford it would be the only ones with them, but seeing they exist, better in a poor persons home than none at all."

If I was in the same position this second, I'd be in the same boat as them. Heck, if I personally was the one ill, I'd try waiting it out because I flat don't have the means to afford an emergency right now. Next month is another story, but right now I can't. It's not about lack of care, it's recognizing that even the cost to consult isn't an option. My animals eat before I do. I haven't been that broke in a long time, but it's been that way in the past. 

This is how many people live. Sometimes you can love an animal and flat be unable to do anything. This isn't a movie where everything is okay in the end and everyone can access unlimited resources. If you can't access resources, you just flat can't. It's not a moral problem, it's a poverty problem."
news,ffo7foz,t1_ffnuowh,1580074889.0,"I can understand why people are inclined to say they deserve it at times. I interact with a lot of people in generational poverty who suffer from some effects of very poor choices as a way to ""pay it forward"" and give people a chance to do something better. It's hard seeing people in a spiral who refuse to do anything to improve their circumstances. If somebody who doesn't understand that this can happen with the circumstances, they're going to judge them as reason that the services shouldn't exist at all. I've met and tried to help some people who are the literal characature of a poor person from talk radio. It's infuriating sometimes, especially when you do for them and then it comes back to haunt you. 

I definitely understand the housing. My fiance has quite a record, much of it is because he struggles with PTSD involving law enforcement stemming from childhood interactions with them. I had to save immense amount of money to ensure that my fiance could live with me without risking us being evicted when they discover he does. He struggles getting work that pays decently. 

I do agree people deserve to have consequences, but those consequences should end and be reasonable. What good does it to do keep people out of reasonable employment and housing because of something they did that they've served time for. Such things should be a right, not a thing only those who are moral and/or haven't gotten caught deserve."

I think it's the idea that if you're poor, it's suddenly your fault. You did something to cause your own failure. You're unethical if you don't work hard. If you're mentally ill, you just need to think yourself out of it. If you are unable to go on the never ending quest of self-improvement because you're on never ending burn out from working 40 hours, you're just immoral and don't deserve to leach off somebody else to eat. 

People have this woven into their ideology, that somehow if you're not successful that you've done something wrong.

reactivedogs,ffltia4,t3_eu3vcl,1580043923.0,"While I see nothing wrong with it, perhaps a good idea is to get a long recall leash.

Same if he doesn't do it. I've trained an implied ""sit"" with a specific annoyed facial expression using praise and heavy treats. 

Arousal: Have you tried time outs/enforced naps? It seems arousal is a problem but arousal isn't just caused by excess energy, but also being over tired. If your dog is still young, you may need to enforce naps to ensure the excited fellow is sleeping enough. I tell Tigs to go to kennel (or sofa) to sleep if his behavior gets elevated. I've had to cut back my heavy activity if the boys start acting up. Tigs starts chasing cats and Mars starts forgetting all his manners when a nap is missed. 

Roommate: tether him and don't allow the behavior to be rehersed. Good things happen when he doesn't jump. 

My dog Mars isn't quite as bad as yours, but he surely has his weeks. It's only been countered by food scatters, sniff mats, and learning something new every other day. He's rarely tired unless I enforce naps, but he's very toy motivated. I have to carry a stick for him to redirect his energy to so he doesn't jump on me and try to grab my jacket, pants, etc after he poops. 

Also, have you gone to the vet to rule out something medical? Or talked to them about medication seeing this is affecting his quality of life along with yours. Being in that state of arousal can't be fun so it is worth considering.

It's the exact opposite of what the disciplinarian approach would do. She'll sneak, and teenagers these days know you can't physically make them do anything they don't want to do and lack the sense to know long-term risk even if they can repeat to you the consequences. 

The bright side, you had over a decade to ensure she has self-respect to pick the good ones and the confidence to refuse the gaze of the people who will do her wrong.

They get a mark and treats to expected behavior until their reliability is 100%. I phase the marker and treat out slowly to random intravals and I mix it with other commands so treats aren't expected every time. But, I also use about half the daily food they get so they're not getting stuffed with treats, but are just getting their meal.

With the not listening, you need to use a marker every time to inform them they're doing what you're wanting. Stubborn dogs do exist, but more often than not they don't actually know what you're asking if they're not responsive. It isn't instant. Tigs and Mars both take weeks to months until they fully get new things down in all circumstances, even when they understand it fully in one or two settings. I still struggle with both of them in high stress settings, but it's normal and they're getting there. Mars is about 65% in crowds, Tigs is about 35%. Tigs has bad anxiety, so he's less reliable after a point.

It sounds like normal puppy behavior with the leash. Mars does this sometimes after he takes a good poo, but I drop the leash and ignore him so he can't play tug with the leash or play with me. Once he calms down to the point he sits, I give him a stick. With the barking, click and reward between barks when she's quiet for 3 seconds. With the dog, if you see the dog first just turn around and walk the other way before reactions happen, click and reward. I've seen some people just hand their dog treats when they see another dog even if they are reacting slightly because you're not going to reenforce an emotional response outside of their control.

It is a real danger of the rising culture war and people are cemented in their beliefs to the point that middle ground are harder to find.
