I was traveling for work and one of the sales guys at the office I was visiting started up a conversation. I was talking about how expensive real estate is in my area and somehow that was enough of a segue for him to ask if I had any kids. I said no. He asked if I was planning on having any (?!?!), to which I replied ""Nope, don't want any!""

At least he didn't tell me I would change my mind. Instead he asked how old I was and when I answered he said ""Such a typical millennial."" I reminded him that I'm currently traveling for work and that is a frequent occurrence, and my husband works at a hospital with crazy hours. How exactly do kids fit into that life? He then went on to wax poetic about how raising children was the best investment of his life and it's so rewarding seeing them as adults now.

Next thing I know a $50 charge for a ""leggings crate"" showed up on my credit card. I went back to the website to see if there was any fine print about the VIP membership including a leggings crate... Nothing! I checked my email, absolutely nothing from the legging company saying ""thank you for your leggings crate order."" It was just a complete mystery!

I made several attempts to contact the website but no one ever replied to my emails and they didn't have a phone number listed. So I did a chargeback and it worked just fine!

I took a few shortcuts - the falafel was made with a mix from Trader Joe's and cooked in my air fryer, and the chicken was pan seared and chopped up instead of grilled on skewers like traditional kebabs.

After we were done eating, I dumped all of the leftovers (minus the falafel, that was all gone) into one container. Today I scooped that delicious filling into some pitas for my husband to take to work for lunch. I also added some roasted garlic hummus and spinach as well. I get that the extra work makes it slightly more of a hassle than just grabbing a container out of the fridge, but I was worried that if I assembled the pitas in advance they would get soggy and fall apart.

Pull your head out of the sand dude, there have been closeted gay men, many of whom married women and had children, throughout history and still to this day.

I watched my dad die from cancer when I was in high school, I was bullied, and I survived an abusive relationship to name a few. I also solve difficult problems for a living.

niceguys,fde6ujd,t1_fde61rf,1578332467.0,"I'm quite capable of critical thinking and I shouldn't have to write several paragraphs to explain why the way you are behaving in this thread is completely unacceptable. It seems like you're projecting; maybe women have rejected you and that's why you feel the need to stand up for this random guy who cleary went the wrong way about approaching someone in an online dating site.

Dating is a mating ritual, and you're either successful or unsuccessful. Getting butt hurt about it and challenging a bunch of randos online to fight you, friendly match or not, isn't going to change that. And from what I've seen your personality is almost certainly not going to help you get laid."

So if they slip and say something hurtful and then show remorse then yeah, you forgive them. But if you're talking to a stranger and the first thing they say is an insult, there's absolutely no reason to give them a second chance.

niceguys,fddup4c,t1_fddgep5,1578324431.0,"People are responsible for learning how to properly behave in society. This might not have been the most egregious of insults but calling a woman ""useless"" certainly isn't a great opener if you're trying to date her.

Unfortunately online dating is pretty cutthroat. When I was on OkCupid I had so many guys messaging me (and I'm not ugly but by no means a 10) that it was too overwhelming to respond to all of them. So if this was the first message I got from someone I would quickly move on to the next.

I don't understand why you seem so concerned about this. Actions have consequences, and if you make a mistake with a complete stranger they aren't under any obligation to forgive you or give you a second chance."

I ended up smoking almost a pack a day that summer because it was the only break from the monotony!

About a decade later I'm still eating cheese and drinking milk and living with the consequences. I do buy the lactose free milk but even that still makes me gassy.

Funny thing is some of my coworkers travel more than I do... I thought I would look to them for ideas on how to pack light, but it turns out they're all platinum whatever status on all the airlines and bring A TON of luggage (for free) everywhere they go.  On our last trip I greeted one of them when she got to the hotel... she opened her trunk and had 2 large suitcases and we were only there for 3 days! I think they're away from home so much that they just like having all of their stuff with them.

I get it though. I get REALLY bored when I travel on business so I bring anything I think might keep me entertained. Otherwise I end up getting sloshed at the hotel bar and showing up to my meetings hung over."

Like I said, it's all based on a lot of assumptions... But there are people like that in this world and they do tend to make things slightly more difficult for those with serious service dog needs. But accusing someone of that based on one question/comment is a lot."
