niceguys,ffcgluk,t1_ffc22gc,1579799021.0,No clue. Guys sounds like he doesn't know anything about cars.
LetsNotMeet,ffcanm0,t1_ffbdr6k,1579795325.0,Thank you. I think I handled it alright. Especially considering my parents had never talked about how to handle a situation where I felt threatened while driving.
LetsNotMeet,ffcagvz,t1_ffbnzs0,1579795209.0,Yeppers
LetsNotMeet,ffcae4g,t1_ffc0vdb,1579795162.0,Thanks!
LetsNotMeet,ffc9y0k,t1_ffbq7ej,1579794882.0,Yeah Pahrump is it's own kind of weird.
LetsNotMeet,ffc9r68,t1_ffbd8x5,1579794761.0,"While that advice would be good in most situations that would not have been the best option.

Again this was over 20 years ago and the nearest actual police station was 90 minutes away. I would have had to stop for gas that night to get there."
LetsNotMeet,ffb19i1,t1_ffavp71,1579749295.0,Correct Pahrump. I went thru middle and high school there.
LetsNotMeet,ffb0s47,t1_ffahiza,1579748966.0,"I didn't want them to know where I lived. My stepdad was still building the house and most of the doors didn't lock. 

Also, the gas station was at the point I left them in my dust still 5 minutes away with several turns in between. There was at least a chance the employee inside could hear me or I could run inside and yell for them if the guys showed up."
LetsNotMeet,ffb0fb5,t1_ffar89h,1579748724.0,"No, you're right I didn't want them to know where I lived. It was less of a risk to get out and use the pay phone where at least the employee might hear me scream. 

One HUGE reason is my stepdad was still building the house... The doors didn't all lock."
LetsNotMeet,ffb03pe,t1_ffakrah,1579748507.0,No they made it very clear they wanted to fuck. It has been a long time so I don't remember exactly what they said but they were very clear.
IDontWorkHereLady,feyu2jm,t1_fewn28k,1579450521.0,That was obvious
niceguys,few9mzy,t3_eqrm0e,1579407216.0,How is this 'Nice Guy' material?
niceguys,few96ec,t1_few0hkx,1579407019.0,This backstory helps but your original post was merely confusing.
niceguys,few8jpm,t3_eqpxp7,1579406907.0,"Without some context the title and the message make no sense.

I can guess that she's asking for help from you but his post means nothing."
IDontWorkHereLady,few7all,t3_eqrd9a,1579406359.0,"Yes, this pleases me. The innocent interaction with the misunderstanding. Wholesome. Thank you."
niceguys,few5g1i,t3_eqqaok,1579405678.0,This just shows what he expects regarding gender roles. Hard pass for me.
entitledparents,few23zw,t3_eqqngb,1579404415.0,"So, I remember going to a restaurant where (8 yr old me) was confused at the restroom signs. I ended up going into the men's room. As I walked out the 20-25 year old man I passed did a double take on the signs and stood there questioning himself which door to enter."
IDontWorkHereLady,fevx8o4,t1_fevrdn7,1579402639.0,Trying to be pervy?
DnD,feusts2,t3_eq6ks0,1579389601.0,It's f'ing adorable.
creepyPMs,fetqsu6,t3_eqib8o,1579378523.0,Am I looking in the mirror? How else can I change before my very eyes? Not going to be able to see the transformation for long if I'm turning into a planet.
entitledparents,fetjjqh,t1_feppjpm,1579376088.0,I grow my hair out and donate it to a charity that makes wigs for cancer patients. I would be furious if someone cut my hair without my consent. It takes a lot of time and patience to grow it out healthy enough to donate.
niceguys,fetio57,t1_fespuhf,1579375827.0,I prefer the /s to the capital lower case combo. For me that writing is like someone trying to force their humor into my eyeballs.
niceguys,fdqyj17,t3_emqvkl,1578676806.0,Hmm that bio kinda begs to swipe right and immediately unmatch just to meet with him.
niceguys,fdppfvp,t1_fdozx8c,1578635598.0,"Ugh, the original mention of 'milky teeth' made me think of a teething baby biting into a boob. No thanks. Though baby teeth aren't any better."
JustNoSO,fdpjejk,t3_emdj7n,1578630240.0,"First this is not judgement it is a statement that I will clarify. Lust is not love.

Clarification: you may love him in a way but he has definitely showed that he only lusted after you 

He doesn't want anything to do with you, ok, set up a support network for yourself. Consider getting a ged if your support network is lacking, look into scholarships if you have the support to further your education, and if you're not ready and someone in your family can't care for the child there are plenty of people who want to adopt."
creepyPMs,fdpg19k,t3_emgtrj,1578627671.0,Oh gawd this made me laugh.
LetsNotMeet,fdpbg8r,t1_fdm6pho,1578624452.0,"A couple from when I lived in LV, one beforehand when I lived in Pahrump, and I think 3 since I joined the military. I haven't been back in 7 years. A lot had changed, (mainly expansion) from the time of my story but there were still lots of sketchy areas last time I visited.

I'm going back to LV in a few weeks. Not sure what I'll find while I explore my old haunts."
LetsNotMeet,fdpan0z,t1_fdnr5zf,1578623902.0,"I've never regretted listening to my intuition. I've 90 percent of the time regretted it when I didn't listen to it.

I wish I could say that she did get the support and help she needed but unfortunately that was not the case. Her mother ended up victim shaming her and blaming her for what happened. I ended up being her only support which was not good and her brother used it to deepen his manipulation (that's a whole different can of worms I'm still processing since I survived/left).

I will post more stories as I think of them and am up for posting."
JustNoSO,fdlqf2k,t1_fdllugl,1578530021.0,This. A lawyer versed in family law could tell you if he has any rights where you live. You just dated so without a paternity test he doesn't really have any grounds to be part of the baby or your lives. If that is the route you choose to go down it means no child support. You can get a restraining order but you need to document all the harassment and get a paper trail going for one.
entitledparents,fdlo035,t3_elylbz,1578528376.0,I would have picked the kid up walked over to your grandparents handed the kid off to their parents and told them to fuck off.
JustNoSO,fdfyeb0,t1_fdfvdge,1578373703.0,Oh yes this. Even if you're on a green card you have options. He's an abusive ass trying to control you. Do you really want to spend your life cow-towing to his bullshit?
niceguys,fd7he41,t1_fd6mw36,1578204545.0,But in their mind if they insult you they will blow their chance at f'king you.
entitledparents,fcwfodm,t3_eiycqg,1578024419.0,Just a scam.
niceguys,fcwfgw9,t3_eiyh6m,1578024270.0,Rather be single forever then deal with your entitled aggressive bullshit
creepyPMs,fcaqtf7,t3_egn09h,1577574769.0,Had this person stolen someone else's information trying to get other people to destroy their life?
creepyPMs,fcaq4ax,t3_egosxy,1577574353.0,"Sorry, but of course it's a scam. No reputable company would send a letter in that font and that format."
niceguys,fcan16s,t1_fc9ui25,1577572497.0,"Aww, you say tentacles like it's a bad thing."
entitledparents,fc6te4j,t1_fc5nx0f,1577489009.0,Don't worry in the Christian nativity it's in a barn. Or stable depending on interpretation.
creepyPMs,fc5jb1o,t1_fc5cwre,1577459151.0,I mean just what I said. There was another post exactly like this only in English. At this point it would have been posted a couple weeks ago.
JustNoSO,fc5ixbv,t1_fc56l7d,1577458857.0,Really well written advise. I hope OP listens to you since this was basically the same thing I was going to say.
entitledparents,fbidiut,t3_edi99b,1576897891.0,"Eh, sorry but this seems like less of entitled parents and more of your grandpa and Braxton didn't have good communication regarding the job and times.

If it's not that please elaborate."
