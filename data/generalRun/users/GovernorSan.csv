Even if OP had not worn their court case, OP wouldn't have had long-lasting consequences to their life from being fired.  That new owner's life, however, was destroyed, lost their business and their marriage, and likely damaged their relationship with their parent, the previous owner.  That's nuclear."

Nothing ever really changes for the characters, they don't age, Fry and Leela continue to be on again, off again, everyone still works for the Planet Express delivery company.  Everyone always says they should let the characters change a little, age, grow, just to refresh the series a bit, but nothing ever changes.  Eventually you tire of it, and stop watching, even going so far as to get annoyed when you see it occupying a time slot that a newer, better show could have been."

AskReddit,fdgm33a,t1_fdfyvvt,1578401899.0,"I was a NeverTrumper during the last presidential election as well, voted 3rd party for someone that was much closer to my policy preferences and that at least seemed closer to my moral preferences, but I'll admit I got pretty nervous that Hillary was gonna win.  Since then Trump has done a pretty good job as president, even though he has some personality issues that aren't the best.  


Unfortunately, very few of our politicians seem to be truly morally upright people, they all have some kind of corruption, fault, or failing.  It's almost always a choice of the lesser of two evils, especially since no 3rd party seems to have the financial resources to advertise their candidates nationwide."

AskReddit,fdf1wf3,t1_fde961v,1578351428.0,"Was looking for this.  It started off so well, but that's because it was based off of George R.R. Martin's Song of Ice and Fire series, truly epic books, basically our generation's Lord of the Rings, except with graphic sex and violence.  The last 2 or 3 seasons they had gone beyond the last book and the author has still failed to produce the last 2 books in that series, so the tv series lost the epic writing source and the show writers just resorted to some rather cliche writing.  The last season they just kinda slapped an ending together."

monkeyspaw,fczv4bl,t3_ejf14x,1578109131.0,"Granted, but your one shared consciousness isn't always able to distinguish the source of the various bits of sensory info provided by your clone bodies to administer an appropriate response to the correct body.  For example, one of your clones sees a bee flying at them, so you try to swat at it, but a different clone that's talking to your boss is the one that starts swinging their hands around.  Or one clone is trying to have a phone conversation, but another clone sotting in a movie theater is the one trying to reply, without a phone in their hands.  The more clones you make, the less your consciousness is capable of distinguishing between them, and the more confused and erratic your clones behavior will seem."
AskReddit,fczu0vn,t1_fcz3irc,1578108598.0,"Not always the case.  My sister once ate an entire box of grape-flavored tylenol when she was too little to know better.  My mom rushed her to a nearby hospital, told the lady at the desk what happened, and the lady told her to have a seat, while the lady then went back to flirting with the security guard.  My mom snapped to her senses and left with my sister to another hospital, where they practically jumped over the counter to rush her into treatment.  They also pretty much interrogated my mom and my sister to make sure my mom hadn't tried to poison her and then changed her mind, but that is standard procedure in these situations.


As she was driving away from the first hospital, my mom called them and explained exactly why she was leaving, and that her giant truck driver husband was on his way to the first hospital and they would have to explain to him why she left.  The person on the phone at least seemed to give a crap, because they tried to get my mom to return and even sent people out to the parking lot to intercept her, but she was already gone by then.  


So you can't always trust that the reception staff are going to treat your emergency with the proper urgency.  This may have been an extreme case, but it did happen.


My sister is okay, btw."
