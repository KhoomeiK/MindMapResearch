But much like cheating on someone. You made that choice so regretting it after is pointless.

And others shouldn't empathise with you either.

You chose to snort that one line to many.

You chose to stick that needle in your arm once too many times.

You chose to down that extra shot.

You chose to get take out rather than cook a healthier meal.

You chose it and it messed you up. And now you expect the world or your circle to crowed around and help you or leave you to your addiction.

Addiction doesn't occur by accident.

Drugs, smoking and alcohol have chemicals that if the brain is exposed to too often and too much can lead to the brain becoming dependent. I.E addiction.

Food addiction is making up an excuse to make fat people feel like their current condition is not inherently their fault.

Atlas class titans so your tones, monarchs and Ions. Had 2 strafe as standard and turbo gave em faster cooldown and a 3rd strafe. Titans in general had more chassis hp enough thhat an Atlass could very well outlast the likes of a Scorch or legion especially with a regenerating external shield which couldn't be damaged by small arms like primary and secondary weapons. Only explosives, ordinance, anti titan weapons and titan weapons.

But these goliaths also didn't have electric smoke as standard that's a titan kit. And rodeos were full time not just hop on and offs. After ripping off a part of the titan exterior and exposing its core one can use a primary or secondary to very quickly whittle the chassis hp down to nothing.

Spitfire used to have a heavy impact mod which increased dmg vs titans thus made it a super powerful weapon against ogres with their giant hp pools.
