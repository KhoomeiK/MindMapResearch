Hip fx, femur fracture, have had EMTs attend cause the medic didn’t wanna deal with it, so those patients got to suffer through the pain. People get excited or something when they get new medications that they give them at the slightest sign they can, not considering that not every condition needs immediate, aggressive treatment.
