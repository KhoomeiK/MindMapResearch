At a bare minimum you should be educating yourself and voting. Voting is a right and a responsibility. Find subs for your city, province, and country.

Politics can be intimidating and overwhelming when you start and maybe voting is enough but if you get involved you can create amazing change.

 A friend asked me to get conversion therapy banned a few years ago. We're now on the verge of seeing a national ban. And that legislation will be used by other nations for bans. This has the possibility of protecting tens of thousands of lives across the globe.

Nightlife depends on what kind of person you are. There's multiple dance clubs and one strip club. Pubs everywhere (that tend to have good food). Our music scene is awesome. Slice and Owl have live music most nights- local and national acts- and a really great community of people supporting it. 

The uni is lovely. It's a great campus and has a radio station you can get involved in and even host a show- CKXU. One of the best parts of my time here! 

The wind sucks and it regularly smells like cow shit here. The city does a piss poor job at plowing. It gets really, really cold.

I identify as she/her (female sex assigned at birth) even though I'm not committed to a gender. Gender is a social construct that happens to not really matter in my life. 

I identify as queer because my attraction to someone has nothing to do with their sex or gender. While my current partner is a cis, straight male I'm just as likely to date a woman, non binary, or trans person."
