stopdrinking,ffgjukn,t3_etgpir,1579907895.0,"Well then you got socked with the double loss and between grieving for the partner of alcohol you also lost your other partner.

I got divorced and felt similar feelings of just a large part of my life missing. But it was a dysfunctional, unhealthy, and dependant/co-dependant relationship. Took awhile but recognizing it can't work out with these toxic things in place helped. Likewise alcohol can't be in that mix.

Million healthy fish in the sea and when we take in the appreciation of the good out there the loss of placeholders don't really matter as much."
stopdrinking,ffgj1h0,t3_eth4kf,1579907364.0,"I used it on my last go for 60 days and it really reduced cravings. As you noticed the nausea to small degree also reduced my hunger. I am not sure if some of the side effect is simply alcohol lieing to me wanting me back. I know when I quit chewing tobacco with Chantix I got kind of mean but then again anyone who quit tobacco gets testy lol. Went 840+ days last time.

The flu got me thru these 4 days but I do have a Rx for naltrexone plus some anti-anxiety meds that I plan on starting. Does Chantix help for tobacco? Oh ya. Naltrexone for alcohol? I think so too. Certainly it is one component of a overall health program but it is a darn nice support to start."

stopdrinking,ffezj4e,t3_et9tk3,1579871395.0,"Just my experiences, focusing on lack of sleep is like fighting anxiety or depression. Sometimes noting it and letting the mind think of other things even if you don't sleep helps. I do a meditation sort of exercise, focus on breathing, think of how heavy I am on the bed, think of sunshine hitting and warming my face.

I do try and get in a good walk for daylight and exercise, wash your sheets so they are super comfy, avoid tv/computer/blue lights before bed time. Know that you inevitably will sleep again just as you always have."

interestingasfuck,ffayrtq,t1_ffauian,1579747614.0,I respect the skill just can't appreciate the art. Like the Andy Warhol Campbell's soup can.

news,ff7989r,t1_ff6uj41,1579643685.0,Thank you posting the background on that. Flint was well on it's way to a new water supply when Detroit did that. Like a vindictive spouse - they set the ball rolling. Now if the water treatment folks in Flint took one class in water treatment they would have immediately softened/hardened the water to not change the PH flowing thru all those pipes. Blows my mind I mean don't they normally test and adjust water reservoirs for PH/hardness etc.? Things like rainfall or changes in supply I thought were constantly monitored. I mean they had one job to do and they didn't.
