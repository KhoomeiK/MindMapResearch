Economics,ff48fpc,t1_ff3u31r,1579557805.0,"Sure. Wages are ""sticky"" once you're onboard. You get increases as you go, but everything after you are hired is based on the money they paid you when you started.

After a while, your market value may increase for various reasons. But you don't collect that value unless you reenter the marketplace. 

The most common reason for your increased value is that you are better at your job now. You have experience that you didn't have coming in and you have learned new skills. Another reason could be external conditions, with workers more scarce. When that happens, employers have to compete to get staff, so they sweeten the offers.

It is not unusual to see newly hired employees get more money than those who were there before. I've seen it. I used to get a budget for increases and bonus that I was supposed to spread around based on performance and existing salary. There were percentages that were supposed to be used. I would do some creative things with those numbers to let those paid less catch up with their peers, but it takes time.

When someone looks for another position, no one with skills should take less than 10% more than they are getting currently. That is, if you can afford to be patient. If you are out of work already, your bargaining position is weak."
