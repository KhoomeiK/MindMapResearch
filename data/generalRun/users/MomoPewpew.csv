Rainbow6,fffy0zc,t3_etdsxr,1579894281.0,"Friendly reminder that pick rates and win deltas are not their only criteria for whether they should nerf an operator. As they discussed in the dev stream a couple of months ago they also look at player frustration (which is why they're thinking of nerfing Lesion but not Valkyrie) and their impact on pro league (which is why Maestro is getting a nerf even though he's close to 0% win delta and not absurdly popular).

I'm already seeing a bunch of comments here saying how the devs decisions make no sense when you look at this data. Try to keep in mind that this data is not the only thing that they consider."

1. Obviously Castle, considering all the castle rework suggestions that this sub gets. Amazing gadget if you know how you're supposed to use it. How strong his gadget is doesn't quite justify how awful the UMP is though. He would be a lot less situational if he had something like an MPX/Aug3 or even an ACOG.

2. Mute. His intel denial and anti-roamhunter utility is just amazing. On top of that he has a nitro cel and the same kit as Smoke.

3. Alibi. Everybody tries to use their alibis to trick people, but that's simply not the way that you use her gadget. Place your gadgets in a way that assumes that the enemy knows that they're fake, because they will. Sites that are vulnerable to window vaults are specifically very strong for her, such as gym/master on club house. Just put one at every window and now people can't vault in without either getting pinged or using an explosive. This gives you all the intel you need to safely hold garage/servers or something without worrying about your anchors getting rushed and losing their gunfights without you knowing."
worldbuilding,fesk4mn,t3_eqf4ru,1579366059.0,"I'd say that a post-apocalyptic era is any era where people have found ways to make due with what they have until the point that they have re-established something that can be described as a civilization.

How much this is in years or even days, centuries or millennia will vary greatly depending on what type of calamity it is and how long it takes to rebuild a civilization. It can even vary from region to region. It's possible for a world to be experiencing apocalypse, post-apocalypse and civilization all at the same time in different regions.

In your case I'd aim for something close to 700-800 years. This is the time when the only people who are still alive from before the calamity are a small handful of elves. This creates a time span where most people who are currently alive will have heard second- or third-hand accounts from the old world. Though most of these will have come from elves.

The age of elves kind of messes with this. If it were a human setting then I'd say go for 80-100 years, but then you can have plenty of elves who were around for the calamity."

AskReddit,fendsyt,t3_eq1wzh,1579282537.0,"Elimination of desire.

No matter what you have in life, your ""want"" can never be satisfied. The only way to be 100% happy is to want nothing.

Which sounds super boring to me, I'd rather have the life that I have now. I have a fulfilling passion, ideals that are worth realizing and a job with good conditions that pays for a lifestyle that is better than the grand majority of people in human history had. I have it good.

Sure, financial independence would allow me to focus on my arts for 7 days a week instead of the current 4 days a week, but that is such a minute gain in happiness that I don't even see the point in desiring it.

An interviewer once asked composer, buddhist and mycologist John Cage what his favorite mushrooms are. His answer was ""I like the ones I have. If I like the ones I don't have then I'm not as happy"".

I guess what I'm trying to say is: Thinking about what you're missing can only make you less happy. If you want to be happier then think about the things that you have and the things that you can realistically strive for."

I've been a musician for 12 years, pianist for 3, and studied theory and composition for 6.

I don't have much of a result yet, just small exercises, but the effort of studying it is already so gratifying. I would recommend that anybody who's interested in it just starts doing it. The best time to plant a tree is 20 years ago, and the second best time is today.

But know that it is a lifetime commitment. Mastering music is going to require you to play an instrument 2*15 minutes every single day for a period of 20 years at the very least. And this is on top of any theory studies, exercises and music studies you need to be doing. But the bright side is that that is really all it takes. You don't have to be the ""chosen one"", you just have to put in the time and effort."

AskReddit,fdn9rlr,t1_fdn3px8,1578581030.0,"This is a very interesting topic.

In a certain sense, yes. If by agency we understand ""the power to influence the world exactly according to the rules as written and the outcome of the dice"", then disregarding the outcome of the dice or changing your NPC's statblock to serve the narrative of the story is taking away the agency of your players.

Perhaps a better way of phrasing it is ""never let your players know that their agency was taken away"". Let them try anything they want to try, and make them feel like success is always possible.

Sometimes the narrative of the cooperative storytelling experience comes before the agency of the player. For their own good, so long as the illusion of reality is not broken."
