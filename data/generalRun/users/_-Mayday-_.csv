whatsthisplant,ffilh8c,t1_ffiky8p,1579976717.0,I have been misting it because the directions said to keep it moist and the seeds are not deep.
whatsthisplant,ffe39ya,t1_ff4m8b9,1579835569.0,"It was a new kind of heartbreak. I wish I had saved some of the seeds, I put them all in :("

todayilearned,ffdtb5p,t1_ffbp4p0,1579828398.0,It was the right amount of sugar and by the time I woke up it was the perfect temperature where it feels amazing when you drink it.
todayilearned,ffb04pj,t1_ffay7z7,1579748526.0,An ex of mine will always have part of my heart for the simple reason that he would make me a cup of coffee in the morning and set it on the nightstand so that the smell woke me up. He also made it perfect every time.
whatsthisplant,ffag4mo,t1_ff5tqeo,1579734955.0,I planted a dollar bill. 99 cents in the hole.
whatsthisplant,ff49w8y,t1_ff452bf,1579558720.0,Dang it. I was so excited when I saw signs of life.
whatsthisplant,ff49qz3,t1_ff49chm,1579558628.0,"Thank you for the infor. I doubt it was sterile potting soil; It was an impulse buy from a big box store that came with the put, dirt and seed packet."
Apartment_Gardening,fepatzb,t3_eq6o83,1579316034.0,"Hi there, I started with the grocery store basil, mint and rosemary and went from there. I have about 20 plants now, mostly succulents, couple of orchids, a gardenia, and anthurium. 

** However my cat is not curious at all and doesn't climb on anything except the sofa and the bed; she doesn't even glance at any of my plants. I got her as a 2 year old and introduced plants soon after bringing her home if that makes any difference.

youseeingthisshit,feluohw,t1_fek2ywk,1579231379.0,Are we sure that's a female... it looks like there is a dangly bit between the hind legs. Not that I was staring or anything.
flowers,fd9h28v,t3_ekce1w,1578233229.0,"Wow! 
How long did it take you! you have me wanting to make my own snowdrops now."
BlackPeopleTwitter,fd9eriw,t1_fd99fw0,1578232413.0,"Just don't discount the power of propaganda. And the fact that young adults barely out of their teens aren't the best at making decisions to begin with. You are looking at it from the point of view of a 30 year old with experience and already knowing that you came out the other end, when you are staring at it fresh out of high school it is a different experience."
BlackPeopleTwitter,fd9866l,t1_fd8rq17,1578229763.0,"Some things have changed because of social media, it seems like people are more aware of what is really going on and how we are manipulated. However, when I joined as a naive 17 year old, we were bombarded with ads portraying the military as an opportunity to make something of yourself and as a way to get a sense of purpose. At that time I didn't have the tools or the experience to pause and see the big picture politically and socially. 
When you consider that they target low income areas where getting out seems impossible you might see how this is an attractive option. I dont know if I would have figured out how to break the poverty cycle had I not joined but I really doubt it. I have struggled a lot even with the experience I gained and education (I mention experience because it's difficult to find jobs with just a degree and a lot of employers favor veterans)"
AskReddit,fczas5y,t1_fcykfet,1578097154.0,Maybe we can swap because mine is to be more patient. Actually any level of patience at all would be an improvement.
AskReddit,fczabp2,t1_fcysyij,1578096881.0,The look on his face says a lot too.
