Nope.  The connectors looked the same, but were just different enough that we had to buy two sets of everything."

All these clocks started drifting apart until we had a gap of about 12 minutes.  People started asking which clock they should be using and the nonanswer we got was a magnificent piece of literature that did not answer the question and also let us know there would be disciplinary actions for not clocking in and out on time.

Only after people starting howling to senior management and HR about write ups (there was absolutely no consistency in which clock supervisors were using when checking what time you logged in) did they synchronize the clocks and rescinded all the write ups."

It also makes the cat far less interested in what I'm doing I noticed.

AskReddit,fcp6x9s,t1_fbf3j8s,1577852486.0,"At a previous place I lived, the landlord had the water heater replaced for the apartment upstairs.  When he got the bill it was for some absurd amount, so he asked for an itemized bill, which the plumber refused to supply, so the landlord said he wasn't paying until he got an itemized bill explaining all the charges.  

I wasn't aware of the dispute between the two of them, but I was aware there was a plumbing issue with the apartment upstairs.  I had gotten home from work one morning and was smoking on the back steps when the plumber shows up and waves a work order at me, saying he was here to fix the water heater.  Sure, fine, let him into the basement, I go inside and go to sleep.

I wake up later that afternoon to find we had no hot water.  The plumber had apparently repossessed the water heater and disconnected us in the process.  Thankfully I could shower at work, but it really sucked not having hot water for a couple of days.  

Complaints were filed with the licensing board, but I'm not sure what ever came of it."

One time in the middle of the game I got a phone call, set the box down, and promptly forgot about her.  About an hour later I remember and was surprised the box was still closed up.  I opened it and she was sound asleep.  I guess she figured if the game was over she was going to take a nap."
