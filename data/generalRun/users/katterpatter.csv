If you can, I think it would be valuable to talk with a counselor about everything that's going on with you, your marriage, and your life. Regardless of your decision, you deserve to lead a life where you feel like you can pursue your dreams."

WomensHealth,fdjs6gk,t3_elqanm,1578485546.0,"I've taken off work a couple of times for really bad cramps! Usually the first day of my cycle is the worst and, especially if it coincides with a work day, can make my life absolutely miserable. I did struggle with guilt the first time with taking leave for my period, but honestly it's so worth it to be able to be home and to take care of yourself. Even if you feel better by noon, it's still an opportunity to recenter yourself and take it easy as your body does it's thing.

It sounds like you might struggle with some anxiety (as evidenced by feeling guilty about not being at work/letting your students down). I hope you can realize that you deserve all the time, space, and resources you want to take care of yourself!"
weightlossdiets,fd5s17r,t3_ejvtkz,1578180841.0,"I've been using [Daily Harvest](https://www.daily-harvest.com), although they're not specifically a weight-loss-focused meal delivery service. Their harvest bowls are surprisingly filling, and the smoothies are pretty good, too. I like the emphasis on superfoods, and that they try to source as many of their ingredients from organic suppliers as possible.

I'm thinking about trying out other options, though, namely [Veestro's weight loss plan](https://www.veestro.com/products/weight-loss-plan), [Fresh N' Lean](https://www.freshnlean.com), and/or [Diet-to-Go](https://diettogo.com). You're right about all the online reviews - it can be confusing!

Good luck!"

truechildfree,fcyy82t,t3_ejht2t,1578089713.0,"Oh yeah, for sure - I've been called ""maternal"" a few times, and (during college, especially?) had friends and family say how I'd be such a kind and patient mother. I was always a little annoyed and confused by those comments.

I don't think folks have wrapped their heads around the idea that someone can take care of kids (I was a nanny and babysitter for years), smile at babies, and generally be friendly and chill with kids WITHOUT wanting to parent. It's either you hate kids or have kids, which is pretty extreme and wildly off base for so many intentionally childfree folks."
abortion,fcyx239,t3_ejkyqj,1578088966.0,"No one at the clinic should give you flak for being there without your husband. When I worked in a clinic, I saw all kinds of folks - people came by themselves, with best friends, with SOs - whoever they trusted and felt comfortable with. It's up to you who you want to involve and to what degree 

Your husband does not have legal ""rights"" to the fetus. No one - not your husband, not anyone - can legally compel you to stay pregnant against your will. You have a constitutional right to manage your body and fertility as you see fit.

I'm so sorry you're feeling alone, scared, and stressed. Are you able to talk with a counselor of therapist sometime soon? I think it could be really helpful for you and provide some relief.

Beyond your immediate situation, I'm concerned that [you might be in an unhealthy marriage](https://www.webmd.com/sex-relationships/features/unhealthy-marriage-signs-and-finding-help). Please, please take care of yourself, stay safe, maintain communication with your friends, and see if you can connect with a marriage and family therapist. Since your husband is very religious, he might be more amenable to couples counseling within a Catholic context? If not, you could still benefit from going to see a professional on your own.

Good luck. Please don't hesitate to keep us updated or ask any other questions."
abortion,fcuzfjr,t3_ej0ogc,1577991570.0,"[Plan C](https://plancpills.org) is a reputable source of information on medication abortion, as is [Women on Web](https://www.womenonweb.org). The Kaiser Family Foundation also has [a thorough rundown](https://www.kff.org/womens-health-policy/fact-sheet/medication-abortion/) on the topic.

Medication abortions are very safe, with a complication rate that's smaller than that of Viagra. 

Good luck, and take care of yourself!"

MadeMeSmile,fcom5fy,t1_fcoh22a,1577835702.0,"When you pursue a doctoral degree, one of the very last things you do is orally present your work/research to a committee (sometimes publically, as a lecture; sometimes privately, where it's just you and the committee). It's kind of like a terrifying, final, oral exam where you ""defend"" your accomplishment(s). After you present, the committee deliberates on whether you've sufficiently demonstrated expertise on the topic and if you pass (hence why most PhD candidates are nervous wrecks before and during the experience).

Depending on the field/topic, people will take their dissertation material and develop it further into a book ([like this one](https://www.dukeupress.edu/Women-on-the-Verge/), for example)."

WeightLossAdvice,fchgwp2,t3_eh8rbr,1577650344.0,"Nice job on the 55 pound loss! To break through your plateau and lose the last 15 pounds, I would recommend weightlifting, tracking your calories (as noted previously, you'll want to double-check that you're creating a daily calorie deficit), and doing a fitness audit. Tony Weaver, the author of Operation Melt, wrote that you need to get a clear understanding of your health behaviors before you can troubleshoot anything.

So ask yourself things like, am I getting enough sleep? Managing my stress? Eating enough fiber, protein, etc? Incorporating enough variety in my workouts? Drinking enough water? (If you have the time and funds, a personal trainer can also help you figure out why you're in a plateau and how to break through.) Once you know your behaviors, you can start improving them.

One last thing to consider is that your body might like the weight it's at right now. (As in, your current weight might be your set point weight.) If that's the case AND you're at a healthy BMI with no weight-related complications (like type two diabetes, metabolic syndrome, or high blood pressure), then maybe you can let yourself stay at that weight. You could still work on changing your shape through fitness (again, strength training would be great for this), but not rely on weight as your metric for success anymore.

Good luck!"
WeightLossAdvice,fcglr5m,t3_eh5x9r,1577641473.0,"According to [this article](https://vitals.lifehacker.com/how-to-minimize-loose-skin-during-weight-loss-1696145766), you'll want to prioritize strength training, lose weight at a reasonable pace, and make sure you're eating enough protein. 

I'd also suggest staying hydrated, and making sure you're taking care of your skin, in general. (Wear sunscreen, exfoliate every so often, don't pick at it, etc.) It's an organ, after all, and so can always benefit from a little extra TLC."

WeightLossAdvice,fc6vi0s,t3_eghgn6,1577490563.0,"The ONEdersuit (by Just Curves) is my favorite workout outfit for stomach jiggle. I'm so bummed that I can't find it anywhere anymore, and I'm deathly afraid of the single one I have falling apart! It was from a Kickstarter a few years ago where the designer created a partial bodysuit with light compression around the abdomen. It has straps over the shoulders (almost like overalls), so there is zero chance of anything sliding off your behind or exposing your stomach!

Other than the ONEdersuit, my only thoughts are to wear high-waisted leggings and/or unitards. That, and consider sticking to low and moderate impact activities until you're less self-conscious about jiggling.

Good luck! You got this."

WeightLossAdvice,fc3tdos,t3_eg0o1w,1577398140.0,"Make sure you're getting enough rest, that you're well hydrated - and don't keep any junk in the house. Consider regular journaling to help root out anything that's driving emotional (over)eating. The Gabriel Method, by Jon Gabriel, might be a useful book to read. (He emphasizes visualizations, meditations, and changing your self-talk to lose weight/achieve your health goals.)

If you feel like your cravings are impossible to manage AND you are clinically obese, you could ask your primary care doctor about appetite-suppressing medication. You will need to be careful with these, though, since many of them can have rough side effects."
selfimprovement,fc3gopk,t1_fc3bg0j,1577389403.0,"Hey! Yeah, of course. Full disclosure - my mom is a therapist, so pretty much from the beginning I was raised with the idea that therapy is something helpful and useful (for everyone!). She's always been candid about what she does and how she does it, so thankfully I never felt confused or concerned about what therapy is like. I was also in therapy earlier in life, so I was already familiar with the general process.

But getting to your question - I decided to commit to therapy almost three years ago when I was in a really bad place (underemployed, regular binge eating, awful self-hatred, self-harming thoughts, etc). I felt like I was getting beat up by depression and anxiety on a daily basis, and I just desperately felt that something needed to change.

When looking for a therapist, it was important for me to find someone who specializes in disordered eating. Through Google, I found a therapist near me who not only specializes in disordered eating but who also teaches and practices DBT. I started out seeing her once a week, and last year also attended group therapy. Now, almost three years later (and lots of crying during sessions), I'm in such a better place. 

Good luck, and be brave! It can take a few tries to find a good therapist and develop a trusting relationship with them, but it's worth it. Please let me know if you have more/other questions; I'm always happy to talk. :)"
selfimprovement,fc2l27w,t3_efuj6e,1577365485.0,"I hear you. A turning point for me was when I started using the self-compassion workbook, by Tim Desmond. I also try to journal (once a day is my goal), and sing in a choir (which is a regular reminder to myself that I can offer something beautiful to my community). That, and regularly going to therapy! Two specific therapeutic models have a lot to offer on this issue of self-esteem/self-perception - dialectical behavioral therapy (DBT), and acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT). Both DBT and ACT paradigms have been incredibly useful to me when it comes to untangling the relationships between my thoughts, beliefs, and behaviors. (Specifically on ACT, weight and body image, the book The Weight Escape has been really interesting; I just started it and like it so far!) Be brave; you got this!"

Some of the things that help me to not binge in the evening are making sure I eat my biggest meal at breakfast or lunch (which can be hard!), drinking lots of water, regularly going to therapy, and having something to do after work OTHER than watch TV or be on my phone. For in-the-moment strategies (like, where I'm two seconds away from grabbing my keys and clearing out the nearest convenience store), I try to remember to take a fiber supplement like psyillium husk (which you have to drink with a ton of water - if you have the loose powder - so it fills you up), maybe grab my journal or find some other way to distract myself.
