Right now they are all mighty little men acting up to prove how manly/alpha they are. Which just shows the childishness. Convince her she is better than what's on display. He might be okay after he does some growing up, but not now. Some of them are just Eddie Haskell's doing just the same. Maybe convince her dating is fine but she's too young to be serious. She has goals!!!! But you have to have her think it is her decision to dump him. Or maybe he's not that bad, and would appreciate having an interested adult in his life (you).

relationship_advice,fes8454,t3_eqfcej,1579362389.0,Kinda whimsical and oddly funny but not practical. Once he's dead he won't care anymore. So placate the living him that does care and just agree.

It's really frustrating bc there's nothing you can do but move on but you feel stuck emotionally- which makes it worse. Really, it just takes time. I wish there was a magic switch to turn it off but there isn't. The only thing I can think of is how maybe to prevent running into the same thing again and that is to find another who also loves deeply. How?... maybe it's finding a person who has gaps between their relationships and doesn't just hop from one to the next... bc that seems like loving being in a new/fun part of a relationship instead of loving the person you are in a relationship with... but then again, people, the strangest, most unpredictable species, capable of horrible things, but also the most wonderful. So that leaves you with learning to have faith in yourself that you will always be okay regardless of what you tangle with, and hope for the best. Easier said than done, but it's one way to look at it. Sorry, I know how awful this is. ðŸ˜¢"
