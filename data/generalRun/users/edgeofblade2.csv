If the stationed freighter is destroyed, the ship escapes back to your fleet as it was assumed to be sortied during the destruction, bringing a crew member to explain what happened.

Also, I’m being advertised phallic vegetables in the ad panel. Why?"

NoMansSkyTheGame,ffi4ze0,t1_ffi2a4b,1579965225.0,"To be honest, I’ve never seen a module at a freighter crash site. I’ve just heard they should be there. And getting them from frigate expositions is very rare. In the time it tools me to find 1 from expositions, found about 15 just casually raiding."

Just don't shoot the smaller cargo ships."

NoMansSkyTheGame,fffkbm5,t1_ffffulp,1579885816.0,I respect your opinion. Some parts fire more reliably than others. The first half of the third season hits some doldrums. And the style of humor is a bit aggressive and won’t age well in a few years.
