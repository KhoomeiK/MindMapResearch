It wasn't easy but it was the best decision I ever made, for me and my son, who we share 50/50 custody of, but that I get more often because she can't handle her own shit.

I was always skeeved out by the unreliability of torque sticks. Years ago, I had a boss buy a bunch for our shop and I did my own little test. The package says to calibrate your gun to the stick by comparing its applied torque to a nut you've torqued with a proper torque wrench. In doing so I found that the applied torque of the stick would vary depending on things like shop air pressure; which impact gun I used; how many ""duggas"" I applied after the nut stopped turning, and so-on. I never felt comfortable with them enough to send my grandma out in her car after using them, so I never used them on customer cars. I always used a regular 1/2 torque wrench. I have also used the preset type linked above. With those, you could just zip all the wheels on with your electric impact then once the car is on the ground, check them all with the preset wrench. We hung one on each hoist where the lowering levers are and made it policy that whomever lowered  the car checked all the lugnuts. It worked for us."

Every car has a radiator and some new model year vehicles will use a radiator design from the previous generation, and some do not. This affects the availability of factory parts and whether or not aftermarket companies have been able to produce stock yet. It is what it is. 

As for the body shop telling you to find your own parts, then to come get your unrepaired car, that's between you, your insurance, and the body shop. I've never heard of an insurance company refusing to repair a vehicle because parts were temporarily scarce, unless it was some rare or vintage model.
