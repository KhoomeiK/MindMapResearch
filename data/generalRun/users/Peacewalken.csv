Cisco outsources much of their tech support and it's a nightmare. 8 hour phone calls where I can understand a third of what they say"

AmItheAsshole,fegmbxb,t3_eodral,1579097117.0,"YTA. Nothing ""transcends"" relationship status. Who are you to deserve him to pay for you to go on vacation? You sound like a spoiled brat for going and complaining to your friends about it too. Nobody gets something for nothing"

aww,fdz4q5g,t1_fdyd4w4,1578786711.0,Exactly this. This boy is getting fucked from the start. It's not like the parents are malicious but it's a dumb decision. Who names their kid after Jennifer Aniston?  A boy? Just the last name? Someone liked friends a little too much

worldnews,fdy5rt9,t1_fdy5ic2,1578776411.0,Just seems to me like by saying that you minimize what china has done and continues to do. We are in no way close to that level of human rights denial. The fact we can even have this conversation without being whisked away to the gulag supports that

worldnews,fdxjfl9,t1_fdvs8jo,1578769258.0,Its fascist for sure but let's not undermine the shit that's going on in China. China isnt the only country to suppress its media. But the organ harvesting and denial of human rights is waaaaaaay worse

relationship_advice,fc6olo8,t1_fc66pah,1577485566.0,"Oh fuck off with your ""moral high ground"" hes not a robot hes got feelings too. The mom fucked up. This is all on her. Nobody should be forced into raising a living reminder of infidelity. Sure, the kid didnt do anything, but you have no obligation to stay with an entrapment child. Not raising the girl doesnt make him cold hearted anymore than you raising your daughter makes you a good father. Dont pat yourself on the back too hard, *superdad*"
relationship_advice,fc6o3g7,t1_fc6ahag,1577485208.0,Oh no no no. Her father abandoned her *from birth* Her moms boyfriend left her mother

If you raise it long enough the courts dont care who the biodad is. Your stuck with child support helping paying for a cheaters lifestyle. The ex can rot and she brought the kid down with her. The kid is the real victim but the person at fault isnt OP, its the mom, then the biodad"
relationship_advice,fc6nhk6,t1_fc6ih2u,1577484778.0,"Lmao it's not his fault his ex is a liar. Why should he take on the financial and emotional burden of not just raising ANOTHER MANS CHILD but trying to ""co-parent"" her with the woman who broke his heart? Why shouldn't the other man step up and take care of HIS biological child?"
