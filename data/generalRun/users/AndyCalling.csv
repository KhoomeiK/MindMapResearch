After the min term, if you don't get another contact, you can leave with notice of (I think, unless things have changed) a month. Many people find themselves in such rolling contracts. If the landlord wants you to sign another contact though, it's sign or leave.

Of course, paying for the child is the responsibility of their parents but as soon as any difficulty arises in getting the money through from the father, and it often does, it will be difficult for her to resist asking you for a little help. With children, such helpfulness will snowball very quickly as it is emotionally far easier to hit you up than to harass the father. When you help, that then allows the father to back off further. If the mother has any financial stutter at any point you could even find yourself covering some of her side of the child support too. It is very hard, at that point, to take a step back. Be very cautious unless you are planning to adopt and take on responsibility for a child. It is a huge commitment and should be made consciously.

HousingUK,ff3nesy,t1_ff32mj7,1579544780.0,"No. It would be assumed to be a standard shorthold period, so renews annually. Even with no written contract you would be assumed to have a standard shorthold in most cases (except i.e. when lodging or in a holiday let)."
HousingUK,ff3mtgy,t3_erdixg,1579544410.0,"OK, so first I'm going to assume you don't mean lease and instead you mean tenancy agreement. Leasehold is a very different thing.

So if you have no agreement in writing then you are held to have a shorthold tenancy in law (assuming the landlord doesn't live in the building and that it isn't a holiday let property). That would last a year. That should be the same if there's no end date on the agreement.

The big issue is that she signed a joint tenancy. This is bad, and should be avoided unless you're doing so with your partner. The tenancy hasn't ended when she left, the rest still live there.

So, the agreement lasts a year from the date the first person on the agreement moved in. Note that in law no written shorthold contact can give you less rights than a standard shorthold contact, only more rights. At worst, she has to pay for the rest of that year unless she gets someone else to move in.

There is a problem though. In a joint tenancy everyone is liable for all the rent. So, if someone does a runner and the landlord can't get the money from them they can bill the remaining tenants. So potentially if many people left from the house and disappeared, she could find the amount she has to pay goes up quite a lot even though she's moved out if the landlord knows where to find her. Also, say someone else moves out and can't be traced easily, and then she finds a person to cover her by moving in, so the landlord then says fine but I'll take that new tenant to cover the runner's rent so you need to find another before I let you go. That can happen too. Get someone else in there ASAP and in future ALWAYS get separate tenancy agreements.

Of course, if she does a runner and can't be traced easily her pals will have to pick up the cost. A nasty thing to do, but it is a thing so I mention it."

Ok, so if you don't have a written contract then legally (assuming the landlord doesn't also live in the property) you have a standard shorthold tenancy contract. You should be able to download this, probably from Gov.UK. Insert your rent figure. I guess they will want to see it is signed? If not, you're golden. If they do, you need to come up with an excuse to get the landlord to sign it. So, off the top of my head, perhaps you're negotiating repayments for a loan or credit cards or some such? You need to prove your accommodation costs. Or perhaps you're applying for funding for a college course? Something like that.

UPDATE: Double pants. Just realised you're lodging. Check what the standard contract is for that, hopefully there is one. If not, ask your landlord for a contract with an excuse such as I mentioned earlier. It just needs to be a letter stating what you get, what you pay and when you pay it with a start date for the contract.

At least the state keeps out of the decision, but I'm not 100% convinced of the ethics of telling someone we accept is old enough to marry that they can't decide for themselves. I don't understand these limited age range rules for consent some countries have for i.e. 16/17 year olds though for sure. If a person isn't mature enough to consent then the age of the potential partner doesn't change that. If they are old enough to consent then it's not really the state's place to start telling them who they should choose, to my mind. Very ethically dubious. It's much like the way we used to have 21 as the age of consent for same sex relationships, which effectively said to people between 16 and 20 who were old enough to have sex that the state would be taking a hand in deciding who with. That makes me uncomfortable."

I mean, I don't know what God thinks he's up to but if we're working to a Christian calendar then I suppose we have to work with the stuff people were jotting down sort of nearer the time but not very near, but good enough for a religion if you squint a bit kind of thing. That seems to be considered good enough for calendars too.

When people chat face to face it's no more disturbing to others than talking hands free to your phone. Really, unless you're in a place where face to face chatting isn't allowed then this should not be an issue. OK so playing music to the world isn't good form but that's getting better 'these days' not worse. Back in the 80s you'd have some chump with his Brixton Master Blaster stereo held on his shoulder. Even people with Walkmans had terrible open backed headphones that were as loud for someone next to them as they were for the owner.

Remember you'll be needing both their employer contributions and your own payments put into an acceptable workplace pension scheme before this fight is over. A cheque now is not going to be much use when you're old.

Note that the employer was likely committing tax fraud as part of all this. You may want to discuss this with the tax man as well."

bestoflegaladvice,fdz73qp,t1_fdz594e,1578787318.0,"Oh. That is unexpected. I would have imagined there was some linguistic form of distinction used as the difference between criminal and civil law is not small, so misunderstanding is crucial to avoid. I don't know about the rest of the EU, but in Britain it is usual practice to distinguish in the manner I have indicated.

As you mentioned, to be polite I will also add that I am not a lawyer, but I am a national level trade union official and my day job also involves significant legislative experience. So, I have an educated interest in this stuff and am used to representing people.

bestoflegaladvice,fdxkubn,t1_fdxief3,1578769910.0,"Oh, so there is a criminal law somewhere in US law that affects this even when not selling? Interesting (and not clear in the links I've seen in other posts here). Thanks for educating me. Now you mention it, I think I may have seen this notice on a DVD I bought for Dad imported (legally and lawfully) from the US (High Noon collector's ed.). I never read it, but I think I remember an FBI logo popping up as it was a surprise.

In the UK we had similar stuff, but no mention of crime though they used the term 'copyright theft' to make it sound criminal (there may have been some mention of crime in the ones that focussed on buying hooky videos in markets etc.). Here, unless I am much mistaken, it only becomes criminal when you start trying to sell the stuff. The announcements were from FACT (Federation Against Copyright Theft) rather than from the police, this was a group set up by big publishers to sue significant infringers I think."
bestoflegaladvice,fdxigf4,t1_fdxgxp3,1578769005.0,"In the context of law, to do something illegal is to commit a criminal offence (so the police can arrest you and you might get fined or even imprisoned). To do something unlawful is to commit a civil offence (so you might get sued). This is why you can be doing nothing illegal and still find yourself getting sued in court.

It is obviously a very important distinction to make though. Doing something unlawful does not make you a criminal as it is not a crime to do this. Doing something illegal does, as it is a crime."
