bipolar,ff2a9vp,t1_fezii0p,1579498496.0,"I had been hallucinating for a few days but the final straw was hearing a voice at one point for two hours and it was the most annoying guy just saying “WINKLER WINKLER WINKLER” non stop. I don’t know why but it made me super agitated and violent. I went on a violent rampage centered around truman show-like delusion. Clawing at the floors and raving unintelligibly about religious conspiracies was my coming down method.

I was lucky enough to avoid a hospital visit but spent the last two days of it screaming into a pillow and sobbing uncontrollably for hours when I got to the last two days of it.  I felt like I was unable to speak? At all? Which was new for me. I couldn’t get out of bed and I would just stare at the wall all day until I fell asleep again. All I knew was that I felt great sorrow. That’s all I could feel.

A boat and a farm and floating down a river sounds like a great time. At the expense of your fellow patients, I’m glad you found a release that got you through what seems to have been an extremely tough time. Keep taking care of yourself and sending positivity your way. May you have a smooth and Hospital free 2020."

bipolar,ff1y30c,t1_ff1w6ws,1579488818.0,You must be fun at parties.
bipolar,ff1w3ha,t1_ff1vfsz,1579487499.0,"Yes! because I find this so fun and edgy! Gee wiz I don’t know what I would do without your omnipotent insight. Thank you, sensei."
bipolar,ff1eqlj,t1_fezd2yb,1579478268.0,"This is actually an internal conflict I deal with a lot. I’m unmedicated, so a lot of time was spent understanding that even though I have an illness, I still have to maintain control and I am still responsible for my actions. And I do feel mostly “in-control” (as much as I can in my current headspace) but it’s like a period of fog? Like during the week, month, however long my episodes last, it seems like the stupid shit I did, didn’t actually occur. Kind of like being in purgatory or in a drug haze.

But this makes entire sense to me and actually gave me a lot to think about. Sending healing energy to you."
bipolar,ff1e7xw,t1_feysioq,1579478067.0,"I used various liner pens, copic marker, and a white gel pen! I just got into copic marker but it’s quickly become a go-to medium for me"
bipolar,ff1e08s,t1_fewsn34,1579477978.0,Of course! I’m glad you could identify with this
bipolarart,fewnbdw,t3_eqq0wp,1579415581.0,This is amazing
schizophrenia,fetnas2,t3_eqeq3q,1579377139.0,"90% of my visual hallucinations include a white bunny, a white fox, or a white frog. The fox comes up at startling times, so that one can cause me to panic briefly, but visual hallucinations generally happen when I’m in a positive mindset and they are usually pleasant.

Auditory hallucinations on the other hand....
I mostly hear a lot of people yelling at me but sometimes I hear this one guy who likes to shout the same nonsense words over and that can be very annoying. Sometimes I hear people whispering and that can make me paranoid."

bipolar,fetirmg,t3_eqf2cc,1579375860.0,Have been having this worse than ever. Can’t get out of bed anymore. Sending you positive intentions and wish you well.
abusiverelationships,fenvjf3,t3_eq50fp,1579291556.0,"I understand this feeling completely. The final straw was once when he attacked me and I tried to call the police. His mom told me not to “ruin his life by having him arrested” that’s when I realized it was his fault he was in the position he was in. It is not your fault, job, or burden, that a defective and sneaky person weaseled their way into your kind heart. NOT YOUR FAULT."
bipolarart,fehfwzf,t1_feh55s0,1579115714.0,"This made me laugh audibly.

Thanks. Sending posi vibes."
