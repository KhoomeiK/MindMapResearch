It doesnt bother me because I havent really put on weight elsewhere so it's not something I'm self conscious about. When someone says ""you're huge"" I know they are talking about baby/bump, and not me in general. Also I feel huge (despite baby and bump actually measuring right on track). However if I was conscious of my weight gain (too much or too little) I can understand being put off by the comments."

Worth trying to empty one breast fully, then start with the opposite next feed."
BabyBumps,ff1pjzm,t1_ff1oqlo,1579483321.0,"This is what I thought. But regardless of marketing didn't it turn out that the RnP was also linked to deaths whilst baby was awake, being used in a similar fashion to a standard bouncer or swing?

I totally understand the need to have a place to put baby down (awake), whilst you get things done. And I get that an activity gym/mat isnt as soothing as a bouncer/rocker."
BabyBumps,ff1ovgm,t3_er33oc,1579482897.0,"So you're looking at at least 15 months even for an early walker.

Either make up a pitcher daily, store in the fridge, and pour bottles as needed. Or pre-portion the water into bottles (these can be kept at room temp), they you just have to add the formula and shake. Both take very little time.

If however baby will only take warm formula, then a machine will be the quickest way to a bottle."

BabyBumps,feuom52,t3_eqhk6z,1579388525.0,"At 25 I probably had some of the same concerns, if to a slightly lesser degree. I knew I wanted to have a family but I focused on all the physical changes and risks. Clear indication I was NOT ready which is funny because when I was 19/20 I always thought I would be married and at least pregnant by 25.

I didnt meet my husband until I was  25, and when we started planning our future we broadly planned to start a family when I was around 32. There were things I wanted to do first, and I still wasnt ready (still focusing on the physical changes and risks). But then I hit .... 28 in think, and I realized I didnt want to wait until 32, we cut down the list of things we wanted to do before kids and started trying at 30 instead. The things that bothered me before didnt have the same weight as they did before.

We grow up, we change, we are never who we thought we would be.

I will say in your case where you are more extreme in your thoughts and behaviors, therapy will probably be very helpful before you start trying for a family and during pregnancy."

Also we put gender neutral stuff on the registry but noone ended up buying clothes, likely because gender neutral stuff is boring haha.

Sure you can pump, but it is time consuming, and not as efficient as breast feeding. Many mothers find it stressfull and demoralizing when they are spending so much time pumping at work, and not producing enough to keep up with demand.

My mom told me when we were little we would often just be in diapers (and her friends kids too), if we were a little chilly put a short sleeve onesie/bodysuit over. She said it was less washing to do haha."
BabyBumps,fdne72l,t3_em2327,1578583902.0,"High waisted underwear and nursing gowns. I got a few from amazon, brand ekaouer (?) That are super soft."
BabyBumps,fdndt4j,t1_fdl54ye,1578583665.0,Rob Bird isnt great either.
BabyBumps,fdndofd,t3_elxan2,1578583585.0,"My husband just let boss know the due date and put on the calendar about 1 week before and 3 weeks after that he may be out. Once I go into labor they will put the actual pto request in.

Same with women, we dont know the date, we let our boss/HR know the due date, and then update them as things go along."
babywearing,fdn6id3,t1_fdmagsf,1578578633.0,"Beco Gemini looks like a great option! Has the different positions, cool option and looks a lot less bulky than the lille (and less expensive than the ergo!)."
babywearing,fdlo6q8,t1_fdl9wma,1578528505.0,That's a good point thanks!
babywearing,fdlo5te,t1_fdljkwn,1578528488.0,"Something like the fly tai looks great,  crossover would be ideal. Not a fan of a ring sling or more traditional wrap."
BabyBumps,fdl3viy,t3_elw9o6,1578516602.0,"Yep! 35 weeks with a super active baby using me for kickboxing practice. Often I'm like ""please just give me a break"", and then theres a day that they are less active and I get worried that something is wrong and start asking them to go back to their squirmy self.

Luckily mine has created some sort of routine that I can work with, make sure I have a couple of hours relaxing in the morning afternoon and evening, so they can get it all out of their system, then they are pretty chill after 11pm (for the most part) so I can get some sleep."
beyondthebump,fdl0pdd,t3_elvpg0,1578514994.0,"This is what I try to help my sister with. Babys dont like change or new/different things, they dont know what to expect. They never went out with my nephew because the first time they tried it he was fussy (grocery store, restaurants etc). Keep doing it until it isnt new/different anymore, and they know it's not so terrible."
babywearing,fdky4qx,t1_fdkndpt,1578513559.0,"I just hate that we would have to have 2 ktan, that wouldnt be used for very long at all. Glad to hear good things about the Lille in GA!"
babywearing,fdky1me,t1_fdkme7u,1578513508.0,"Unfortunately my husband is not comfortable with used items, but thanks for the info."
babywearing,fdkxm9q,t1_fdkogf7,1578513257.0,"I'm aware they arent comparable. Originally we were going to get a ktan and then something more structured when they got bigger. On the ktan site husband and I would be same size, so we could share, but in practice that's not the case. So instead of getting 2 ktan ($60 each) and then a soft structured later, we decided to look at a soft structured we can use from birth.

I had looked at the adapt as I'm less bothered about the forward facing and I like the hip facing (the embrace doesnt do hip) similar to the 360 and the lillebaby. Currently the adapt is $100 on amazon and the lille complete air is $85. I'm willing to buy both and see what feels better and return the other."
babywearing,fdkj8br,t1_fdkixz9,1578504867.0,I'm leaning towards the lille complete but I guess you dont know until you try it.
babywearing,fdki9r2,t1_fdkdr46,1578504388.0,I will take a look at those thanks!
