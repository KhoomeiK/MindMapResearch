Similarly, my godparents are just my aunt and uncle from each side of the family. I guess I find it a bit odd that your brother’s godparents wouldn’t have included you since I assume they’re close to your parents. Your uncle probably doesn’t even think about the fact that he’s your godfather, but he doesn’t sound like a bad person.
