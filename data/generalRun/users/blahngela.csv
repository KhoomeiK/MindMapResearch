relationship_advice,fem6aog,t1_fem5w44,1579241271.0,"Tbh: I’m still healing and it’s kind of like a one step forward, two steps back situation I’ve got going on. 
I MISS coming home to someone and having a partner I could rely on. I MISS having someone else to focus on. But those are ideals of a relationship and when I remember that, I realize that being single is the lesser of two evils over being genuinely unhappy. 
Therapy has helped immensely [to be clear, the break up didn’t initiate treatment]. As well as giving myself the liberty to do as I please, do who I please, just for me. Being in grad school requires an extent of selfishness and in my case, the break up became an opportunity to lean into that without reluctance of how I’ll make others feel."
relationship_advice,fem5loa,t3_epw9fa,1579240568.0,"My experience wasn’t exactly the same but daily similar: partner of four years and I broke up and needed time to figure out what would happen with the lease. We tried to co-habitats for the first week or so, and I couldn’t deal with it. Despite the politeness and all, things didn’t feel right and it was keeping me up at night. So I decided to couch surf at friends’ places. 

I ended up asking him to couch surf at the tail end because I’m also juggling grad school, an internship, and a job. Of all things, I needed to be stable and at home. 

TL;DR: it makes sense that you want your space and should strategize options to make that happen."

needadvice,fcxvdyz,t3_ejglnc,1578071029.0,"As a therapist-in-training, you’re already headed in a healthy direction by being this self-award and introspective. 

It’d be good for you to find a licensed psychologist/therapist to work through the grief and exposure to difficult experiences in your childhood. It’s possible that you’ve managed to cope for so long but things are coming to surface. Rather than letting things overtake you, this is a time in your life to take the power back. 

Best of luck to you!"

Nephew: why is that funny? 

Me: the commercial is pointing out that people get to go on more vacations and do more stuff when they don’t have kids to worry about.

My brother: coughs and gives me a dirty look given that I’m visiting them on my vacation and it can’t be the other way around because of his parenting responsibilities. 

Nephew: ohhhh so don’t have kids if I wanna go on vacations? 

Me: I mean... yea..."

CasualConversation,fctpnx6,t3_eipy4z,1577953119.0,"It’s great that you’re taking time away from social media to get back to yourself and bring things to center. 

I stopped using all social media (FB, Snapchat, IG, LinkedIn) as of three months ago and I honestly don’t feel like I’m missing out on anything AND feel less stressed by external drama from friends, social issues, and politics.

I’ll also add that I don’t consider reddit social media like the others because it’s not nearly as performative or curated — at least in the way I use it. Here I don’t have to pretend about anything or be concerned about the quality of posts in exchange for upvotes. I just engage for the sake of it."
AmItheAsshole,fctfy7q,t1_fct8t9n,1577942011.0,I paid for it so we can have time away from the negi vibes at the house. My older nephew isn’t willing to take off work [even at 16 years old] so my younger nephew [12] will be hanging out at the apartment as of tomorrow.

AmItheAsshole,fcsx7vc,t1_fcswuep,1577927395.0,"Kind of hard to do that without coming off insulting. For example: I booked us a stay at an apartment hotel and he’s just holed up in his room on the phone with a woman he’s trying to pursue. I get it, he’s going through a break up, he’s trying to get some action... but geeeez I haven’t seen him all year."
AmItheAsshole,fcsx2b6,t1_fcswu3r,1577927284.0,"He’s a recovering alcoholic... so that’s not quite an option.

Misery loves company and my point is that I’m not here to be miserable with him."
AmItheAsshole,fcsww5d,t1_fcswq5w,1577927164.0,Right... so the main idea was to pack up his RV and live out of it like a couple of bachelors. But the batteries are dead and he doesn’t wanna replace them. So I booked us an apartment hotel in the city since his home is way out in Wimberley [over an hour away from civilization].

socialwork,fciv89o,t3_ehdreb,1577670621.0,I’ve come across a lot of fellow MSWs who are in the field because they have something to prove in helping others but don’t exactly do it because it comes from the heart. They make questionable decisions and don’t have the “gut”. I often wonder about their long term success and further the impact of their ego on the wellbeing of clients.

socialskills,fci9s9u,t3_eh8h4l,1577659498.0,"Okay... this hit home for me because I was feeling the same when I was 22. I even attempted suicide. 
I’m 27 now and I’m genuinely grateful that what I did to try to end my life didn’t work. It was a lesson I really needed. I can’t speak to what is making you feel so low and hopeless, but I certainly hope that my story provides some sort of solace. At 22, so many things were going wrong for me and I wondered the same: am I better off dead? The answer: no, I’m better off alive. 

I got the help I needed to embark on a journey of healing and learning to live with severe depression, generalized anxiety, and chronic PTSD. I’ve surrounded myself with supportive individuals who bring value and joy to my life. I’ve leaned into my passion for helping others, music, cooking, film, and painting. I’ve taken thorough inventory of what serves me well and what doesn’t and from there have straight up cut out the excess and kept it pushing. 

At 22, after an involuntary hold at a psych hospital and treatment with a psych team, I was headstrong about not making it to see 27. I can say now that I knew so little then. The world and life have so much to offer, but we have to be willing to make it out of the weeds to get to see it. 

Sending along much love and posi vibes."
