Advice,ffr0z3w,t3_eurbk2,1580148064.0,"please ignore the rude comments. they’re really uncalled for. 

i understand how you feel, i’ve had the same thoughts when i was younger. 

i know you have good intentions but your suicide will only hurt your family. it’ll be absolutely heartbreaking for any mum to experience their child’s death. it’ll cost her more too, she’ll have to pay for the funeral (which is surprisingly expensive). 

it’s understandable that your mum is stressed about money but it’s very unfair for her to vent about it around you and your siblings because there’s not much you can do to help her when you’re still young. i assume she’s not aware of the pressure it puts on you to want to help out. 

please don’t do anything drastic. she loves you and doesn’t want to see you hurt."
