Dck because it was easily my favorite disso, and yes, I've tried MXE many times. I enjoy it for its potency, headspace, and very unique holes that provide a slightly manic essence to your life. I mean this in the sense of everything seems connected, you feel important and like you are capable of anything. In large doses it's so dissociative that it can be hard to remember which reality you're in as you start to experience the plausibility of existence between parallel realities.


ALD52. Well if I'm to be completely honest, LSD has been one of the most profoundly beneficial drugs I've taken. It can provide a solid meditation friendly headspace in therapeutic doses, I'm comfortable in public on it, virtually impossible to overdose. (I've taken more than 100tabs before) I of course dont encourage megadosing to anyone. I must also bring its potential when microdosing to attention. As someone who has been diagnosed w add, having been off adderall nearly 4 years now, I have found that when microdosing it can provide just as much focus with more of a creative boost without addictive properties or a terrible come down. I could probably go on about this one but I digress.


Diclazepam simply for the fact that it is a long acting benzodiazepine that isnt dangerously potent in the submilligram(uq) range. I also find it to be the most functional benzodiazepine aside from ClonazePAM.


This brings me to 4mmc, 4-Methylmethcathinone, Mephedrone, MEOW, bliss, the extremely euphoric and short acting cathinone of your pre-ban dreams. I suppose that really depends on what you want from a stim. But as I stated above I can satisfy all aspects of my add with ALD52 in micro doses. So this one sits in my completely recreational category while still remaining functional. I mean this in a sense of it's over all 90minute (at best) peak coupled with an overall 2 hour experience. Very quick, smooth comedown capable of leading you right to bed. I consider this to be the business mans stimulant as one could get off work, get blowed for 4 hours, come down and go to bed at a decent hour. Given the fact that the comedown is so smooth you typically dont feel like shit the next day.

In spirit of your well thought out answer I shall also explain my reasons.

I'd fight Darkness. My hunch is that I could get her pretty hot and bothered by just mentioning the idea. Personally I find that side of her as a decent turn on so it's a win for both of us. Wouldn't be the first time I had to choke a chick.

I'd then proceed to fvck Aqua. Let's face it, shes pretty gorgeous and has a gifted body. Another huge pro is I'm really into squirting and I can picture a fountain of purification.

This brings me to marrying Megumin. I could not fight her as I would be exploded. Fucking speaks for itself and I'd have nightmares if I killed her. Having married her I can look forward to eventually having a sexual relationship with best girl and live happily ever after since I killed Kazuma."
