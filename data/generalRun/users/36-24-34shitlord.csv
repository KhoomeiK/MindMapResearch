Make broth out of Better than Bullion Chicken paste. He thinks it's too weak as normal so does 1.5x the recommended paste to the amount of water on the directions. e.g 1 part paste to 1 part water = 1.5 paste to 1 water

He really likes chicken, it's a bit much for me but uses the ~5lb container of boneless, skinless, chicken breast from walmart which is about $2/lb

Two pounds carrot

One onion, chopped in half

Some onion powder. 

We both like the taste of onion but hate the texture. We pull it out once it's done cooking.

Cook for like 3 hours. We end up going through 2-3 bags of noodles with this much soup."
fatlogic,fdixbah,t1_fdityhq,1578453157.0,Do some pushup sor some crunches at home. No mirrors and body weight fitness is a thing.
fatlogic,fdifh3g,t1_fdi76en,1578441714.0,"OMG YOU PLAY IT TOO?

I did Despacito extreme, Sorry extreme, and then some moderate songs."
fatlogic,fdhwr6m,t1_fdheekn,1578431548.0,It's got nowhere for my height weight but does adjust for song intensity so *shrug*
fatlogic,fdhwozs,t1_fdhhlmk,1578431517.0,It only tracks active time which is nice.
fatlogic,fdhay6j,t3_elcpmx,1578419120.0,Was playing Just Dance last night and for 38 minutes of dancing it said 193 calories burned. Does that seem whack to anyone else?
fatlogic,fde2ty5,t1_fd4np7e,1578329925.0,"I had someone tell me that the other day. I told them it was their own fault for buying expensive, out of season, quite frankly bland and nasty blueberries in January. 

Although through some witchcraft and fuckery I did score 1lb of delicious strawberries for $2 last week. I don't know what caused this but I want it to happen again!"
fatlogic,fde1v1h,t3_ekfumk,1578329297.0,"I think I put on some weight during the holidays (not sure, pants are a teensy bit snug)

Being on a diet is simply eating a Reese's peanut butter cup mini (38 calories) instead of 1/2 cup of Breyer's Chocolate Truffle Ice cream for 170.

STILL EATING SWEETS. JUST LESS."
fatlogic,fde1ks7,t3_ekk3u2,1578329111.0,This person is 2.5 of me. YOU ARE CARRYING A WHOLE OTHER PERSON. YOU ARE BEYOND FAT.
fatlogic,fddys66,t1_fddn8nt,1578327247.0,It's because you guys are oblivious. And women cheat with our big sunglasses.
fatlogic,fddm1q3,t1_fdd49fi,1578317352.0,Don't worry as a woman I discretely ogled my fair share of guys. And got excited when I was there at the same time as then.
fatlogic,fcyexyh,t1_fcxmk73,1578079024.0,"I became incapable of participating on the internet for a few months because I was having waves of anxiety every time someone else said they were struggling and broke.

Been there, done that, but for some reason it broke me. I wasn't going to tell people to shut up, I needed to work on me. So I took a couple of months off the internet.

The world is not a bubble, we need the resilience to handle it."
fatlogic,fcydxs5,t3_eeme20,1578078614.0,"So for some reason, despite probably hitting my goal in October, January 3 is the year I posted my ""weight loss victory"" post on Facebook. 

I posted that victory five years ago. It has been 5 years that I kept 50 lbs off. Go me! Now if only the confidence automatically came with it."
fatlogic,esen54e,t3_c7020x,1561904238.0,"I have a very large friend (m, 6'2"" 400 lb) who is broaching the idea of weight loss. He wants to jump straight in to one of those hard core workout plans and extreme diets. Does anyone have some good resources I can give him? I'd point him here but I want to go REALLY slowly..."
