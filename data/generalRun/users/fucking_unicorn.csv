SandersForPresident,ffhfbu7,t3_etg3bz,1579932867.0,"This is great! Even the backlash is great!!! There is no such thing as bad publicity. Eventually, people can’t even remember why they were mad, they just remember your name."
Futurology,ffhe02u,t1_ffg5laa,1579931407.0,"Over here we have drivers who will pull in behind a line of waiting cars even though there is no room for them and block the intersection so cross traffic can’t move. Some do this on purpose and other times, people illegally change lanes in an intersection causing this to happen to the poor schmuck behind them who would have otherwise had plenty of room. Then there are uber and lyft drivers occupying side lanes forcing all the traffic into the left turn lane where naturally someone is waiting to turn left, but can’t because some other fucker is blocking the intersection."

oakland,ffgypf4,t3_eteul4,1579918483.0,Yeah I got rid of my car soon after moving here. Won’t get another u til I have secure parking again. We’ve had two uhaul trucks stolen and a catalytic converter stolen so far.
Crystals,ffgrcj8,t1_ffgqq9k,1579913094.0,I mean I live in Nor Cal and we have humid and dry micro climates so.... depends. Also on your homes humidity like if you have ac or live where there are drastic temp changes between day/night etc

holdmyfeedingtube,ffgbka8,t3_etai39,1579902624.0,"My friend photographs horses and grew up with them. One day I was on site with her watching and one ran past her and gave her a side kick as it passed. It sent her flying back about 5-6ft and I went with her to the hospital after to support her while she was examined. She had a monster sized bruise just above her hip, but no internal bleeding or broken bones. She was lucky cuz they can kill with a blow like that. She just walked away with lots of bruising and soreness."

freelance,ffe45rt,t1_ffcg674,1579836224.0,Yeah asking “how did you find me” once lead me to learn I was on the front page of google. I damn near spit my coffee out during the call cuz I never did any paid advertising with google or anything.
Psychonaut,ffe3qnp,t1_ffcl0h0,1579835913.0,"No I’m not pretty smart tho. Lolz. My whole life I’ve been an “A” student, a high achiever, an honor roll student, the one my family would always go to for answers and now, I run a business. Heck these “achievements” really don’t even mean anything. My life got so much easier when I realized I dont have to be an answer dispenser or solve everyone’s problems or even be smart to live a life I’m happy with. Being smart isn’t even synonymous with success, happiness or wealth. Load off my chest! :)"

freelance,ffccv4y,t3_esuvga,1579796713.0,"A dead giveaway for me is when they ask if I offer the service on my website and yelp account. The only place they should be finding my contact info. One of my main questions is “how did you find me?”. If they say referral or friend, my follow up is who as I tend to form strong professional relationships with all my clients. If they can’t or won’t tell me who, I just start ignoring and deleting their emails. I’m already working ten hour days and don’t have time for their shit."

smallbusiness,ffcb3pv,t3_estht4,1579795609.0,"Attempt 1: $4-5k
Attempt 2: $17k
Attempt 3: $21k (3 years strong!) First year taxes put my balance back down to $7k, but I decided to stick it out this time and am doing great!

Edit: the initial money came from saving up from my full time job. Each attempt meant working my small business full time and each failure meant letting go of most of my clients and going bAck to a full time job. In 2017 I kept up with freelance after moving and took a low paying part time job. This seems to have been a turning point and I got my new “cash cow”. Things were tight but I stuck it out. I’ve been doing better now with each year and am in the process of raising my rates again (which so far, clients are happy to pay, and finding help to outsource to)."

AdviceAnimals,ff8czl6,t1_ff88b9o,1579673414.0,"It is. I pay $450:mo for just myself, a healthy 30-something. I still will have copays and a 5.5k deductible. When I have a child, will probably just pay to insure the kid and hope for the best for myself. Probably will invest in life insurance instead of health insurance for myself because it would be the better choice for my family."
politics,ff7jmn5,t1_ff7ctds,1579651102.0,"I own stock and it’s crazy how the numbers have ballooned. That’s awesome for me. I’m also aware that this is not the case for most of the U.S. and being a young adult, I would be totally happy to see those numbers grow more slowly (sustainably) if it meant a better life for everyone else. I still vote democrat because of humble origins and empathy for those less fortunate. The support system dems advocate for allowed me to survive my childhood and to pursue a good job later in life and as a member of society, I very much am ok with giving back through taxes, donations, charities etc. just this year I am finally in a place where I can afford health insurance premiums. I’m not doing great, lots of people are doing way better than me, but I live within my means with housemates and am better off than most. Would call myself Lower middle class I guess. I’m a few thousand above the poverty line in my area. If I wasn’t married, my income alone would qualify me for programs. Kinda got screwed by getting married but it’s ok...love my husband."

You’re also not supposed to heat an empty non-stick pan because it can release the chemical into the air where it can then enter the blood stream through our lungs. PF pollutants are forever in the environment and we’re dumped in mass quantities and more and more unregulated chemicals are dumped every day. (Companies can feign ignorance). It’s fucking horrible. DuPont has a history of hiding known medical issues caused by their Teflon line after other companies stopped producing the chemicals due to birth defects, and organ changes. When will companies be held accountable? (Hint: get used to cancer)."

I put together a routine with a song and practiced for about two months until I looked and felt great doing it. There’s no specific timeline. There is always someone who will be better. I have some performance background from fire performing so I was comfortable with it. I made some mistakes but everyone still applauded. Main advice: smile, point your toes and have fun!"
