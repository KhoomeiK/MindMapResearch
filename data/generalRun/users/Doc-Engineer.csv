If you're burning 500 more calories a day resting just for having the excess muscle, and lugging that extra weight around requires even more calories, and you keep eating the same amount as before you gained the mass, what happens then? You lose weight. Sure, it may be slower than running marathons (even though you can do that too), the point is you are still losing weight from nothing more than sitting around with added muscle.

Obviously 200 calories for ""standing out of bed"" is a blatant exaggeration to show you how stupid 200 extra calories per 10kg of muscle actually sounds. It's nonsensical. The added weight of the muscle alone would cover more than that 200 calories just from hauling it around all day. And that's not including the energy actually burned by the new 10kg of muscle.

Obesity is a multifactorial syndrome in which a deficit in resting metabolic rate has been shown to play a significant role.Consequently, people with lower resting muscle metabolism might in fact be at higher risk for sustaining positive energybalance and therefore gaining weight. Several factors might influence the variation in muscle energy expenditure, such as
thyroid hormone (perhaps even within ""normal"" ranges), muscle fiber types, muscle tone, sympathetic innervation, and/or catecholamines levels. Recently, in support of the present finding, Wade et al. presented data emphasizing the relationship between muscle fiber types and body compositionand suggested that muscle fiber type might be an etiological factor for obesity. Also, Astrup et al. reported that skeletal
muscle was the site of part of the facultative thermogenesis in
response to carbohydrate feeding via #2-adrenergic receptor
stimulation by epinephrine. Emorine et al. also proposed
in their report of the ""molecular characterization of the
human f33-adrenergic receptor"" that muscle oxygen uptake can be mediated by the norepinephrine released from the sympathetic innervation via P3-receptors. Taken together, these results suggest that skeletal muscle is a potential site for the variability of metabolic rate observed between people.""

Gonna guess you didn't look at that study. These researchers disagree with your sentiment in its entirety, in that muscles have a set energy expenditure across all individuals, and that it's this low. What you are referring to is the resting metabolic rate, and it's not an accurate count of metabolism in regards to fat loss because generally nobody spends all day resting. Your heart is a muscle, a tiny one at that (comparitively), and yet it uses up 15-20% of our resting metabolic rate. This is because the muscle is constantly working. Walking down the sidewalk with 10 extra kilograms will absolutely expend more overall energy than walking without the extra weight. Sure, gaining 10kg and sitting your ass on the couch 24/7 ain't gonna melt the fat off, but to say a 10kg increase won't even increase your energy expenditure by 200 calories I'm sure you know is preposterous. And you never mentioned if that was 200 calories off your daily total, or expended per hour, or per minute. Shit, it would take the extra 200 calories just to pull that 10kg out of bed in the morning."

Steroids both increase metabolism, and increase protein synthesis, which results in an even greater energy expenditure by the body (ie higher metabolism). This is probably why low-T can lead to problems with obesity in the long run (or the opposite problem if the person does cut calories down to their expenditure rates and end up underweight from lack of muscle or fat mass).

What you're stating is just bro science (""I expect an extremely strong guy...""). And it's wrong bro science. Just because you're recovered enough to lift again, or even lift the same amount again, that doesn't mean your cells have fully repaired. A good example of this is bodybuilding routines.
