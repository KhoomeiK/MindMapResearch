YangForPresidentHQ,ffhk28a,t1_ffejii7,1579938863.0,"There have been a lot of head to head polls over time, and in different places (National, NH, etc).   Some higher, some lower.    Politifact did a ‘lie’ article several months ago after some lower results came out after the 10% result.   But since then, more 10% or 10%+ results have come out over time.    

This phenomenon is part of the reason for the “lies, damned lies, and statistics” saying.   You can prove almost anything depending on how you cherry pick the statistics you put forward.   

On the other hand, it’s pretty fair when you take all the head to head results over time that Yang sticks to his ‘10%’ message.    After all, he has had 14% results among all adults several times before, and 40% amongst college students several times.    I think 10% is an honest number."
YangForPresidentHQ,ffffcqa,t3_et96gb,1579882743.0,"And another thing.   Through the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) no Australian pays more than AU$40 a month for a prescription medicine.    The government subsidises the rest of the cost for more expensive medicines.   If you are poor enough to qualify for a Health Care Card then prescription medicine drops to AU$4 a month.   

Generally consumer goods cost more in Australia than the US, partly because of our overall higher taxes.   But birth control pills, insulin, asthma medication - never more than $40 a month each.   Asthma puffers are actually closer to $14.   AFAIK If you earn under $24k/year a month’s supply of insulin is $4.   

Make no mistake, the cost of living in Australia is pricy compared to the US.   But from my perspective the US attitude to not paying each other’s medication costs is actually evil.   We are supposed to reign in being judgmental in the International Yang Gang but this is a massive cultural divide.    Not even Yang is envisaging capping drug prices at $40/month for US citizens.

PS, because of PPP an AU$15 minimum wage actually translates to a US$10.47 minimum wage.    I’m too tired to do the PPP math on AU$40."
YangForPresidentHQ,fffdc37,t1_fff4imn,1579881462.0,"There seems to be some confusion because different Americans seem to have different definitions of what ‘single payer’ and ‘public option’ mean.

Australian Medicare is paid for by taxes.   There are no premiums, but there are usually co-pays if you earn over $24k/year.   (People earning under that are entitled to a Health Care Card which gets you medical discounts).    Everyone of all ages is covered by Medicare at all times.

This seems to be what a lot of Americans, especially Bernie supporters understand as ‘single payer’.

Then Australia also allows Private Health Insurance.   (For the purposes of simplicity I’m not going to go into the carrot and stick system that the government went into when the private health industry went into a death spiral because so many Australians dropped private health insurance in favour of just relying on Medicare.  Because of the carrot and stick system, most Australians who can afford $300 a month for an individual’s private health insurance take it out.).    Private Health Insurance of course has premiums, and you also pay taxes to fund Medicare even if you have insurance.

This seems to break a lot of Bernie supporters brains.   They seem to think a viable single payer system isn’t even possible without the banning of private healthcare.   They are worried that a health system with both public aspects and private aspects will result in socialising all the costs associated with the sickest members of society, and leave the healthy members funneling profits into the private system.   To be fair to them, the world is FULL of examples of privatised profits and socialised costs.    This is a very fair concern.

What actually happened in Australia is all the young healthy people relied on Medicare, and only the very sick/elderly people kept private insurance because they wanted the more exotic treatments (and eyeglasses/dental) covered by insurance.

Anyway, to many Americans, the phrase ‘public option’ is associated with a very specific model where the government offers government-owned health insurance that has monthly premiums.    This style of ‘public option’ is supposed to have premiums that are cheaper than private premiums because the government doesn’t require a profit.

The Australian and Yang models don’t fit this understanding of ‘public option’, because the public choice - Medicare - doesn’t have premiums.    On the other hand, Yang keeps using the phrase ‘public option’ to describe something that doesn’t have premiums to people who think ‘public option’ is something that automatically comes with premiums.   Hence the confusion.

PS:  if you have private health insurance in Australia, you can still access Medicare and public hospitals any time you want to."

However in the 80s while preparing forward to going to Uni, I did become fascinated by DNA and the possibilities of genetic engineering.  I read outside my science classes on genetics.   I loosely followed advances during adulthood, and read a little on telomeres, senescence and resveratrol, and on the tangled sphere of sugars that DNA is wrapped around, which is now suspected to do more than just provide scaffolding.   

I don’t know if I could have followed any of the biological discussion if I hadn’t done that.   As it was they used a few words I didn’t know, but I think I followed most of it from context.   

The relationship of telomeres to senescence is *huge*.   It explains how people die of old age, and what a ‘natural’ death for a human or animal is.   Basically, every cell has a number of times it’s allowed to repair itself, and when it uses all those repair numbers up, the cell simply dies, or at least stops contributing to running your body.    When enough of your cells die like this, then the organ they are a part of works less well (you get frail) and eventually that organ fails.   When that organ is your heart, you die.   The process is not necessarily accompanied by pain.  You can get painful complications from things like constipation if your digestive system slowly fails before your heart.

pics,fe0avrr,t1_fdzyw9c,1578808133.0,The animals are all dead in the black bits.   No point carrotting them.   We did lose the majority of temperate rainforest left on mainland Australia. :(.  I’m really distraught about it.

YangForPresidentHQ,fdsap99,t1_fdre91e,1578698258.0,"In both Sanders and yang's plans, everyone would be qualified to be covered by an improved and expanded Medicare that is paid for by taxes.  There would be no monthly premiums on Medicare.    

In Yang's plan, private health insurance wouldn't be banned.   If you want to pay extra to have a private health plan, go right ahead.

In Sanders plan,  private insurance would be banned, except for for cosmetic procedures not covered by Medicare."
YangForPresidentHQ,fdsa1fz,t1_fds2f8h,1578697810.0,Yes totally.     Join the slack channel for support and heaps of information.     You'll be given an anonymous phone number and you can make the calls straight from your phone.   You'll want your computer open at the same time for management of your calls and a little data gathering for the campaign.
YangForPresidentHQ,fds8x6g,t3_emwr0u,1578697041.0,"Bi/Pan polyamorous.   It's not the focus of my support for Yang, but the amount of people I knew who were thrown out of their families as teenagers or young twenties for being gay or non conforming was sickening and horrendous.   A freedom dividend wouldn't have caught every single one of those teenagers (some were younger than others) but it would have been there for at least half of them when they were first made homeless by their parents.   

It doesn't make up for the emotional pain, but the practical help would have made a world of difference.   

Just as gay marriage is a legitimacy maker, driving homophobia more underground and making it more safe to be gay, less likely to be beaten up for it,   Adding LGBT+ to the protected classes against discrimination is going to help.    

Will people still be fired for being gay?  Yes they will.   But having to pretend that's not why you are firing them, further drives homophobia underground.   The social and cultural message will be clear:   It's not ok to be homophobic (even if you secretly are)."

YangForPresidentHQ,fdp4214,t1_fdp0ch4,1578619502.0,Freedom dividend is probably the biggest thing to lower abortions ever
YangForPresidentHQ,fdp3b36,t1_fdo4agw,1578618992.0,"She was more likely gathering stats on Yang vs Bernie support in your voter district if she’s a paid staffer.   Your house is also likely to receive Bernie canvassers if Yang drops out.   

I’m sorry you have felt harassed and targeted by your home being photographed.   The thing is, political yard signs are such a powerful tool to show other people that the candidate has a lot of committed support, because a yard sign is a public declaration of alignment instead of a secret vote."
YangForPresidentHQ,fdp1i3c,t3_emclrf,1578617766.0,Need today’s target in the thread title pretty please.
politics,fdne40x,t1_fdnchzt,1578583851.0,"You are missing that personal data now sells for hundreds of dollars per person per transaction, it's that valuable.   If  someone is sick, their data is worth thousands of dollars per transaction.   The personal data industry is now bigger than the oil industry.   There's no question we should be given royalties, and the genuine right to withhold data if we want to not be politically manipulated."
politics,fdndlzw,t1_fdnb0ys,1578583542.0,Carter is the precedent.   He wouldn't have been president under current DNC rules.
tifu,fdly22s,t1_fdlgtu8,1578535228.0,"Humans are very social creatures.   Making the same joke, spending the same meme around, is a process of participating in an ‘in-group’.   This gives the in-group a little dopamine boost each, improving mood.   Which is a great relief in these depressing times.   

Of higher order interest, in-groups fight with each other way less than with out-groups.   The way to get to world peace is when everyone in the world is in the same in-group, and everyone has reliable access to modestly comfortable survival resources."
YangForPresidentHQ,fdljzfx,t3_ellp7u,1578525734.0,We could allow Yang curious questions in Activism Mode.
YangForPresidentHQ,fdljs47,t1_fdjkxgw,1578525603.0,The solution is to still have upvote buttons that allow programs to filter content upwards in their playlists/page listing... but not to *display* up and downvote counts to the public or the person who made the post.
YangForPresidentHQ,fdlidmh,t3_elwt3c,1578524678.0,"His book has his citations for each claim in it next to the claim.   There are a *lot* of statistics and graphs in the book, which is what you need when trying to find what is actually happening.  Because any one statistic on its own can be very misleading, like the headline 'unemployment' rate."
