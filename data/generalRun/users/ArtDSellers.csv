telescopes,fffgp4f,t1_ffffntl,1579883574.0,"I started with an awful little 60mm refractor way back in the day.  But, it was great for looking at Jupiter and the moon.  I had a great time with it, and I definitely learned."
telescopes,fff904k,t3_etbimw,1579878691.0,"Venus is kind of a tough target.  It's really bright, which tends to lead to chromatic abberation (the rainbow colors) in inexpensive refractors.  And, it never really gets all that high in the sky, so you're always looking through a lot of atmosphere, which makes the view unsteady.  And, there's not much to see.  It's just a featureless, white disc (or portion thereof, depending on the phase).  I've never had good luck with Venus - it's always frustrating.  I usually just look at Venus and appreciate its beauty without magnification.

On the broader question, your scope is a modest one, and you should temper your expectations.  70mm is a pretty small aperture, so you're going to limited to bright objects (the moon, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, M42, and some brighter clusters).  Beyond that, you're just not gonna be getting enough light.  There still are plenty of beautiful things you'll be able to see, but you just need to understand the limitations of your scope and work within them.  Don't expect to look at faint galaxies or nebulae - it's not gonna happen.  Expecting otherwise will just frustrate you, and the scope will end up collecting dust in the closet.

Enjoy what this scope can show you (which actually is plenty), and use it to gain appreciation of the night sky and a working knowledge of how to use a scope.  After you have those things, you can think about moving to a more capable scope that will allow you to apply that knowledge to open up more of the sky."
travel,fff87zy,t3_etb77p,1579878157.0,"Don't try to cram too much into this week.  You'll spend half your time packing, unpacking, checking in, checking out, and moving between cities, all at the expense of seeing less of the places you're trying to see.  Better to see and appreciate more of a few places than to catch a fleeting glimpse of more places.

I didn't care for Montreux.  Stop for lunch, see Freddie and Chateau Chillon, and move on.  My advice is to maximize your time in Lauterbrunnen.  Montreux is absolutely not worth taking time away from Lauterbrunnen.  I've been to a lot of places, and there are very, very few that compare to Lauterbrunnen.  Two nights isn't even close to enough.  I'd even steal time from Paris to get more time there.  Lauterbrunnen really is something special.

If this were me, I'd do the whole time in Lauterbrunnen.  But, if Paris is a priority (and I imagine it is), then I'd split between there and Lauterbrunnen, with four in one and three in the other."
stopdrinking,fff7dwl,t3_etbae5,1579877581.0,"You can.  You've already taken that all-important first step in realizing that you have a problem and that you need to fix that problem to get your life on track.  In all that you do, starting now, keep your eye on the prize, and break the task up into attainable goals.  Your immediate concern right now is not getting a great job and making money and having a family and staying sober forever and and and...  Your goal is to not drink today.  All that other stuff is predicated on that.  You are not going to drink today.  And you can do that - it's one day.  Just keep your head up and your body busy (clean your room, clean the bathroom, take care of some random bullshit you've been putting off...), and all of a sudden it'll be tonight, and you'll be tired, and you'll go to bed.  You may not sleep well, but you will not be drunk.  You will not be hungover tomorrow, so you'll already have a head start on tomorrow's goal, which is to not drink tomorrow.

You are not going to drink today.  That's the goal.  Right now, everything else is secondary.  Get through today.  You have all day tomorrow to worry about tomorrow.  You will not drink today."
