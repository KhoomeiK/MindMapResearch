And seeing other trans people won't make you develop gender dysphoria duh. But I don't have gender dysphoria, so I can't really describe how it feels to have one."
malaysia,ffeps3s,t3_dvpc6e,1579859362.0,"Wow, they just gonna brush off that ""faktor genetik"" one like it is the least important one, wow. Like bruh, if you like girls, you gonna like girls, being friends with gay people won't make you gay. WOW. SO ALL OF MY FRIENDS ARE STRAIGHT PEOPLE  (or at least as much as they want to admit) AND WHY AM I NOT STRAIGHT? CAN ANYONE EXPLAIN THIS?"
