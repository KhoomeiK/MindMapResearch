politics,ffdwa9u,t1_ffdmach,1579830509.0,"Appreciate the question.

First off I'll forever be grateful for Bernie. He is the reason we are having the conversations we are having today. He has dragged the Dems away from the neoliberal hawks and forced them to talk about the issues that matter to those on the left - M4A, climate change, free college. While not necessarily the first to talk on these things, he has been the most consistent and strongest voice for literally decades. He has repeatedly been on the right side of history.

That being said, his consistency is a weakness. While I support basically his entire platform, I know there are those who do not, and it can be the case that he turns them off with his consistent speeches about the same issues. I would argue that the reason he keeps talking about those issues is because they are just that damn important, and not enough people are talking about them, but still there are those who get tired of that. He has very strong support amongst those who like him, but he is also strongly divisive for those who do not.

His age is a concern, as is his health. He has already had a heart attack, and will be the oldest president sworn in, into a job that is notoriously gruelling. I feel confident he has the energy and vision to do the job, I am forced to wonder about his body's ability to keep up. And I think he will find it more difficult than he makes out to garner support within the Democratic party itself. He has been an outsider for decades and they are wary of his support. They know he could command a sizable chunk of the population to stay away from the election - he wouldn't, but they are still wary of this. There are Dem insiders who blame him for not dropping out sooner against Hillary, and who blame his supporters (however wrongly) for refusing to vote for her in the general. While I expect them to support him overtly, there's more than one of the Dem establishment who dislike his opposition to Hillary and Biden.

I'm for Warren because she addresses some of those issues - she is younger, she is just as energetic, and shows no sign of flagging or illness. She is also a strong second choice for most of the field - if your candidate drops out, she is likely to see a bounce. As the field tightens she will pick up supporters. She was once a republican, and comes from a Republican stronghold, and from a working class background. She can speak to those elements of society - who better to convince a Republican to change over than someone who was once one herself? She is articulate and explains her many, many ideas well, and her action plan for dealing with corruption is simply second to none, and in far lore detail than any other candidate I've seen. As someone who sees the corruption in Washington, with lobbyists and regulatory capture as the stumbling block for basically anything we would care to attempt, this is strongly appealing to me. 

At the end of the day though it is a close choice. I will be extremely happy to see either in the White House, and both would do a great job, better than any of the rest of the Dem field, and certainly better than anything the GOP has put forward for the past few decades."

The incumbent president, Donald Trump, is clear about where he is guiding the Republican Party — white nativism at home and America First unilateralism abroad, brazen corruption, escalating culture wars, a judiciary stacked with ideologues and the veneration of a mythological past where the hierarchy in American society was defined and unchallenged.

>On the Democratic side, an essential debate is underway between two visions that may define the future of the party and perhaps the nation. Some in the party view President Trump as an aberration and believe that a return to a more sensible America is possible. Then there are those who believe that President Trump was the product of political and economic systems so rotten that they must be replaced. 
[Watch the endorsement process on “The Weekly,” streaming on Hulu.]

>The Democratic primary contest is often portrayed as a tussle between moderates and progressives. To some extent that’s true. But when we spent significant time with the leading candidates, the similarity of their platforms on fundamental issues became striking.

	

>Nearly any of them would be the most progressive president in decades on issues like health care, the economy and government’s allocations of resources. Where they differ most significantly is not the what but the how, in whether they believe the country’s institutions and norms are up to the challenge of the moment.

>Many Democratic voters are concerned first and foremost about who can beat Mr. Trump. But with a crowded field and with traditional polling in tatters, that calculation calls for a hefty dose of humility about anyone’s ability to foretell what voters want.

>Choosing who should face off against Mr. Trump also means acknowledging that Americans are being confronted with three models for how to govern this country, not two. Democrats must decide which of their two models would be most compelling for the American people and best suited for repairing the Republic.

>The party’s large and raucous field has made having that clean debate more difficult. With all the focus on personal characteristics — age and race and experience — and a handful of the most contentious issues, voters haven’t benefited from a clarifying choice about the party’s message in the election and the approach to governing beyond it.

>It was a privilege for us on the editorial board to spend more than a dozen hours talking to candidates, asking them any question that came to mind. Yet that exercise is impossible for most Americans, and we were left wanting for a more focused conversation for the public. Now is the time to narrow the race.

>The history of the editorial board would suggest that we would side squarely with the candidate with a more traditional approach to pushing the nation forward, within the realities of a constitutional framework and a multiparty country. But the events of the past few years have shaken the confidence of even the most committed institutionalists. We are not veering away from the values we espouse, but we are rattled by the weakness of the institutions that we trusted to undergird those values.

>There are legitimate questions about whether our democratic system is fundamentally broken. Our elections are getting less free and fair, Congress and the courts are increasingly partisan, foreign nations are flooding society with misinformation, a deluge of money flows through our politics. And the economic mobility that made the American dream possible is vanishing.

>Both the radical and the realist models warrant serious consideration. If there were ever a time to be open to new ideas, it is now. If there were ever a time to seek stability, now is it.
That’s why we’re endorsing the most effective advocates for each approach. They are Elizabeth Warren and Amy Klobuchar."
