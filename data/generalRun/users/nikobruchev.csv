They also had a decent amount of funding. The CHP ran something like 51 candidates- that's *almost* more than all remaining fringe parties (not counting the PPC) combined. That shows a base of supporters wider than a number of other fringe parties.

* Personnel Selection Officer

I'm not too interested in a combat officer role, but I guess there's also a question on if the roles I'm interested in aren't available in one service branch, would it be worth it to take a role I'm not *as interested* in to be in a service branch I'm interested in?"

This really should be a thing. I vaguely recall hearing of some organization or shelter that would accept mail for individuals but not were if that's true or still happening.

However, it doesn't 100% solve the problem, since PO Boxes aren't always accepted. I don't think you can use a PO Box for banking for example."

This is 100% why I'm trying to actually finish a whole series before trying to publish. It will make sure I avoid making continuity errors, and I won't be over promising anything. I'd hate to claim I'm writing a trilogy only to finish the 2nd book and find that I've finished the story already. Or try to force out a third book just to call it a trilogy.

Of course, I'm also not planning on writing an 8 book series, or like some authors have done, 20+ books in a series. I may choose to keep creating stores in a world, but I doubt I'd ever write connected storylines over that many separate books."

Accounting,fc680nw,t1_fc670u8,1577474391.0,"Oh yeah they were 100% cheap asses. It was a fight just to get new office chairs (I had to scavenge and re-attach parts to my office chair a few times). Had to buy my own ergonomic mousepad and keyboard wrist support. Pretty sure they really laid me off because they didn't want to have to give me a pay raise once CFE results get released. No incentive for community involvement or attracting new clients - I restarted the local Chamber that had been dead for several years and I was actually told I couldn't go to the meetings!

That's really disappointing that you're not getting many good applicants. I know this sub and most schools focus a lot on working at B4 and getting the audit experience, and even after people are focused on ""prestige"" a lot. Have you tried going to some networking events or career fairs in the nearby urban centres? That's what I'd do before hiring a headhunter, but I've also been lucky in that my nonprofits where I've been involved in the hiring process have typically gotten large volumes of really good applicants in recent years without paying for job advertisements or recruiters. I hope you find some quality staff soon! You sound like a good boss."
Accounting,fc672y4,t1_fc65eef,1577473768.0,"Yes, this as well! I've been in my town for 3 years, I kept my doctor in my old city an hour and a half away because it's an average 3 week wait for regular doctor appointments in my town whereas I can drive into the city and have a walk-in appointment. Which means instead of clogging up the local ER if I'm in that range between ""stay home sick"" (<10% sick) and ""fuck I'm dying"" (>80% sick or severely injured), I just drive to my doctors. Couldn't do that if I relied on the local doctors. I mean, at least I'm lucky in that at least there's a local hospital if there is an emergency. 

But yes, a huge lack of variety and access to services. Only one place in town to buy printer ink, only one place in town to buy dress clothes (need a new pair of dress shoes? Be prepared to pay $120 for something you can buy in the city for $60-80). Local court is only open the first Wednesday of the month, and that's really only for criminal and family court. Anything else, gotta drive the hour and a half to either the nearest civil court, or to the queen's bench."
Accounting,fc666ib,t1_fc62ltt,1577473175.0,"As someone who recently left a small rural firm, I'm curious. How are you searching for candidates/posting vacancies? How does your pay compare to positions/COL locally and in the nearest urban centres?  


My former employer only posts one ad for every vacancy, in the local print newspaper (that doesn't even post the job ads on their website). No online ads at all, not even on Kijiji or our local equivalent. They don't have a website in any form. Their ""starting"" salary is lower than in the nearest urban centre **and** wage growth is a fraction of what other comparable positions see. Meanwhile, the COL difference between my town and the nearest large urban centre is actually non-existent. Rental rates are almost exactly the same, and real estate prices are only slightly lower on average (and are often higher than suburban new-builds for that urban centre)."
Accounting,fc65892,t1_fc63id8,1577472557.0,"1. Didn't say I was starting my career in a rural area. I'm actually a mid-career professional *technically speaking* as I'm on my 2nd career. I started in payroll before getting my degree and working towards the CPA. Just because I'm young doesn't mean I'm starting my career or was starting my career at the time frame I mentioned in my original comment.
2. The OP **specifically asks**;  *""Those In accounting who worked In big cities* ***who now work In small towns or more rural areas*** *what Is It like.""* (emphasis mine). So first, they didn't specify smaller cities, they said small towns or more rural areas, and second, their post didn't specify work background so arbitrarily limiting/narrowing work experience to determine the usefulness of my post is itself not very useful.

That being said, **yes moving to a small town or rural area as a pre-retirement move, especially if you've secured a suitable end-career position, is a good idea**. However, that is literally only one scenario. For almost anyone else, I personally and vehemently believe that moving to a small town or rural area for work at any other point is a very dangerous career move unless it's an ownership opportunity (family business or purchasing) or there are some guaranteed protections in place, like a strong employment contract, and you've fully investigated the corporate culture/work environment. Again, yes my comment is anecdotal but *that's what OP specifically asked for*."

Accounting,fc5wdfk,t1_fc5vhvc,1577467300.0,"I'm talking real small - this is a thread about small towns and rural areas, not cities. Town has a population of 5k, total regional population of maybe 13k. It's an independent local audit firm, the only list it's on is the list of approved training offices. There's only 2 firms in the region, and the other one is even smaller and can't do reviews or audits.

When you start talking about small cities and ""top 10 firms"", the difference is really negligible compared to larger cities except for number of firms and total number of job opportunities. In my opinion. Especially because a ""top ten"" firm means fuck all if they have no name recognition 2 hours away because they only have one office in your state or whatever."

I made this mistake and its biting me in the ass now. There are no accounting jobs in the region (literally only a dozen organizations large enough to have their own accounting staff, 2 of which are local government), and because I worked for a small firm, there is no name recognition at all. If you ever try to apply for jobs elsewhere, be prepared to be ignored or passed over by candidates with less experience than you with big4 or regional firms on their resume. 

Yes, COL may be lower depending on location but it means fuck all if you need to drive 1.5-2 hours one way to try to interview or attend networking events on a job hunt. 

Small firms in rural areas are also the most likely to have the worst pay, worst benefits, more arbitrary ""the partner wants it done this way"" (even if its technically against the rules), and just as poor work/life balance as bigger firms in the city. At least in my own personal opinion. I was paid $20k below market rate at my rural firm, which made it hard to live in my ""theoretically low COL"" but actually just as expensive area."
