Jessicamshannon,ffgudjz,t1_ffgtjk2,1579915298.0,Every American has a right to stand trial. What you just said indicates that you don't think every American *should* get that right. Do you realize how that sounds?
Jessicamshannon,ffgu7q2,t1_ffgsykq,1579915178.0,"A cops' job is to apprehend a criminal so they can be brought to trial. You know, that thing that **every American** is guaranteed?

Don't make excuses. This was an extrajudicial killing."
Jessicamshannon,fffzz2q,t1_fffxtkb,1579895489.0,Was him assuming the murder victim's parents were thieves not enough? That's a pretty blatant racist statement.
Jessicamshannon,fffzlkd,t1_fffj3nq,1579895256.0,So you're just a racist.

AskReddit,ffcsv11,t3_esr647,1579806566.0,"I've been told that I should become a therapist by multiple people because there's something about me that makes a lot of people let their guard down around me. I've even had someone confess to a murder they did decades ago! I also have some familiarity with abnormal psychology from educating myself about my own issues too.

The thing is, those same issues, as well as my personality, make it so I *can't* do that job effectively. I can't compartmentalize so I'd be having breakdowns too often.

I plan on becoming a mortician."

pics,fex1axg,t3_eqqq00,1579422694.0,"Being from the Midwest and now living in Southern California, I generally don't miss winter. However, this pic makes me remember beautiful, clear nights when there's snow on the ground and everyone else is asleep, and how quiet and peaceful it is. I can hear the crunch of snow under my feet as I look at this picture.

Thanks for sharing, OP."
