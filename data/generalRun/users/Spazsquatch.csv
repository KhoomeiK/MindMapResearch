Those migrations will will affect the countries where people migrate to, and the political will that could be spent on “the bigger picture” you envision will be lost enacting “solutions” to that “crisis”."

The thing is, it can be. It’s hard to get decent returns on billions, buying the system has proven to be a great return on investment. For the billionaires it’s a simple choice, but the externalities are never considered."

I actually like the sort of work involved in plumbing, never made a trade of it, but I’ve completely plumbed a couple of homes as a teenager and tackled it in my own homes. Obviously I’m no fan of dealing with human waste, but I could imagine myself in a situation where I would volunteer in an area that might put me on the front line of some less-than-ideal situations. So in my head I can believe that it’s at least possible that work would get done.

But that statement is objectively false, new immigrants are the most law abiding residents. 

It doesn’t even pass a simple smell test. People who are motivated to go through the effort to immigrate are almost certainly going to be the best. The lazy don’t take that kind of initiative to improve their lives."
Socialism_101,fdkz4ly,t1_fdii3w6,1578514151.0,"There are likely areas that would need some level of intervention to fill, but I don’t think financial motivation is the only option. Soldiers are generally poorly compensated for work that is potentially much worse than any sewer you’ll ever find. Obviously many are motivated by a lack of other options, but many claim, and I have no reason to doubt, are motivated by a love of country and a desire to give back. There’s no reason to think that wouldn’t sentiment wouldn’t exist even if their basic needs were met.

Just in general, volunteer forces exist and many people claim they would volunteer more often if they had the time. Most people want to do something of value with their lives.

As for the optimal allocation of goods, we have a system with surplus food and housing and a housing and food are still problems. The current system does a poor job of resource allocation. I don’t know if it can be improved, but the bar isn’t high."

Maybe it can be used as some vague proxy for success in the absence of a better metric, but Bezos and Buffet are not working for money, they are motivated by something else. Money has become irrelevant to them yet they keep doing the thing that got them there.

I’ve seen some studies indicating a dollar amount that is the ceiling for financially driven motivation, and while it was higher than the median it wasn’t obscenely high. $80k comes to mind but I wouldn’t stand by that."

Use an online calculator to get a rough estimate based on your height, sex and activity level. 

Count the calories of everything you eat for a week, targeting the calorie amount the calculator indicates. Use something like MyFitnessPal to log everything... which includes a calculator.Don’t guess on amount, measure. It’s a pain (for a while).

...however, a war will not send the markets into a tailspin. It will likely have a negative impact in some areas but it will almost certainly have a positive impact in others. Put $100 in today’s market and you’ll have $200 in 2030, war or not.

worldpolitics,fctfe0b,t1_fcslnc1,1577941503.0,"Your opinion is wrong. 

Casinos house games that are entirely based on chance and the house has a slight advantage. If you play a diverse selection of casino games for 10 years, you’ll lose your money.

A stock exchange let’s you buy partial shares in companies which are usually trying to make a profit, a portion of that profit belongs to the holder of each share.  If you buy a diverse collection of stocks in 10 years you’ll double your money.

You can gamble in the stock market, but you can not invest in a casino (short of buying shares of a casino), that’s the difference between a casino and the stock market."
