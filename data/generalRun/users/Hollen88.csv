Have since it dropped, and you fucks poisoned the well. Anyone wanting to play the game and stops into reddit? Yeah, probably won't play. Then you bitch about player base. They release a new map. possible new players see the excitement! Then the bitching starts about the map, and poof goes some new blood. They fix the map, and added snipers all over like everyone wanted! Yet, still more bitching about how they don't listen to us. 

They can't fucking win. If I were them, I'd tell the lot of you to fuck off. Oh no a modern complex game has bugs! Just like ALL OTHER GAMES! oh no a wave of hackers! Just like ALL OTHER GAMES. oh no they will temporarily remove a map everyone bitched about! Garbage garbage garbage! They are greedy! They add a fuck ton of free content, UNLIKE MOST OTHER GAMES!

Fuck, I'm annoyed, and really tired. I'll take these down votes knowing that you entitled fucks deserve them more than I do. If anything ruins or kills this game, it's the players who are never happy with anything. The ones who spent $20 on a game and yet can't ever seem to find anything nice to say about it. Even after hundreds or thousands of hours they got out of something that would get you a few minutes of entertainment in most another circumstance. 

So get defensive. Keep acting like you always have. Call me a shill. Call me naive. Try and tell me I'm the reason we don't get quality games. Idgaf. I know I wouldn't want to serve any of you in any compactly, and would hate to see how you treat customer service workers."

The Bible condones slavery. It's that simple. The small fraction of Christianity that tried to get rid of slavery won't fix what's said in the Bible. God is more worried about working on Sunday, than people owning people. That tells me that people fully authored the Bible. It was in their best interest to keep slavery. Same with murder, theft, controlling their kids, and having a day to remind everyone to obey what they wrote down. (Sunday)"

MensRights,fdndhzj,t1_fdn65go,1578583472.0,"Maybe not the same punishment, but this lie can totally destroy someone. Rape takes a part of someone that they can never get back. Feeling safe, feeling in control, trust in people, trust in the justice system, mental health problems, virginity, and so on. It does horrible lasting damage.

You can say a lot of the same for victims of false accusations. There will be a significant amount of people who will always wonder if the person actually rapped someone. Job loss, mental health disorders, loss of friends and family, peoples trust in you, their own trust in the justice system, kicked out of school, etc. It has real tangible destructive effects on men who go through it. A lot of time with zero recourse, even with a confession. Some women have done it multiple times.

We all want rape to be a thing of the past but it never will be. No normal person is OK with rape. We all have an instinct to protect women. It's time we start to give a shit about men too. We are intelligent and don't need to be controlled by instinct, yet here we are."

Why do criminals expect that kind of respect from people. It's so fucking dumb. I'm not saying I'm going to turn my friends in for everything, but if they really fuck up, I'll turn their asses in.

I have a few thousand home sample size to make that claim. That being said, that's not every house hold. 

However, the fact still remains that most men work their asses off already, and we do tend to have less time on earth.

They release a new map. possible new players see the excitement! Then the bitching starts about the map, and poof goes some new blood. They fix the map, and added snipers all over like everyone wanted! Yet, still more bitching about how they don't listen to us. 

They can't fucking win. If I were them, I'd tell the lot of you to fuck off. Oh no a modern complex game has bugs! Just like ALL OTHER GAMES! oh no a wave of hackers! Just like ALL OTHER GAMES. oh no they will temporarily remove a map everyone bitched about! Garbage garbage garbage! They are greedy! They add a fuck ton of free content, UNLIKE MOST OTHER GAMES!

Fuck, I'm annoyed, and really tired. I'll take these down votes knowing that you entitled fucks deserve them more than I do. If anything ruins or kills this game, it's the players who are never happy with anything. The ones who spent $20 on a game and yet can't ever seem to find anything nice to say about it. Even after hundreds or thousands of hours they got out of something that would get you a few minutes of entertainment in most another circumstance. 

So get defensive. Keep acting like you always have. Call me a shill. Call me naive. Try and tell me I'm the reason we don't get quality games. Idgaf. I know I wouldn't want to serve any of you in any compactly, and would hate to see how you treat customer service workers."

The Bible condones slavery. It's that simple. The small fraction of Christianity that tried to get rid of slavery won't fix what's said in the Bible. God is more worried about working on Sunday, than people owning people. That tells me that people fully authored the Bible. It was in their best interest to keep slavery. Same with murder, theft, controlling their kids, and having a day to remind everyone to obey what they wrote down. (Sunday)"

MensRights,fdndhzj,t1_fdn65go,1578583472.0,"Maybe not the same punishment, but this lie can totally destroy someone. Rape takes a part of someone that they can never get back. Feeling safe, feeling in control, trust in people, trust in the justice system, mental health problems, virginity, and so on. It does horrible lasting damage.

You can say a lot of the same for victims of false accusations. There will be a significant amount of people who will always wonder if the person actually rapped someone. Job loss, mental health disorders, loss of friends and family, peoples trust in you, their own trust in the justice system, kicked out of school, etc. It has real tangible destructive effects on men who go through it. A lot of time with zero recourse, even with a confession. Some women have done it multiple times.

We all want rape to be a thing of the past but it never will be. No normal person is OK with rape. We all have an instinct to protect women. It's time we start to give a shit about men too. We are intelligent and don't need to be controlled by instinct, yet here we are."
