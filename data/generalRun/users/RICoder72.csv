kravmaga,ff9ky49,t3_es8ifc,1579715187.0,What's with all the low brow trolling on this sub lately?  This question has been asked and answered 5 times in the past week on this very sub.
kravmaga,ff4h7kw,t1_ff44h69,1579563533.0,"I saw your other post on this sub too, and was going to respond there, but I'll just do it here.

If you're talking raw pugilism in a ring, and you put an MMA guy against a Krav guy, I'd probably put money on the MMA guy.  Frankly, if it were a black belt level BJJ guy against a Krav guy I might even take the BJJ guy.  But that's not what Krav is.

We train (many if not most of us) for the unknowns of an aggressive attack.  This is real-world-I-just-got-jumped-someone-is-trying-to-hurt-or-kill-me.  You just dont know what you're going to encounter in any engagement.  You dont know what is going to happen, if they are trained, if they are armed, if they are high.  This isnt sport, or trying to be the toughest guy on the block.  If someone walks up and open hand smacks you across the face and jams a gun in your face, ground game isnt gonna help very much."

kravmaga,feokvt3,t3_eq0hgy,1579301516.0,"I'm glad to see so many people talking about de-escalation.  That is probably the best practical use of Krav Maga you can get.

My experience, and I tell it often when doing intro classes or short self defense seminars, is de-escalation as well.

I was at a rest stop with my three small children and wife.  One of my children had a minor emergency so I pulled into the first spot near the building on an angle (taking two spots).  We could argue whether that makes me an a-hole, but it was brief and it was better than my truck and trailer taking up the lane behind me.  As I was gathering the kids, I heard someone screech into a parking spot nearby followed by someone yelling.  I turned around and there was a guy approaching me, pointing and cursing me out for taking two spots.  I did what I was supposed to do - I put my hands up, slid my foot back a bit and said I didnt want any trouble.  I then instructed my wife to get the kids in the car.
The guy kept approaching and I saw another person yelling and approaching me from my left...multiple attackers.  It turned out to be his wife.  I scanned there car and they had an infant seat in the back.
My head ran through a million scenarios in a half second, all violent.  I kept telling the guy and his wife not to approach and that I was sorry and didnt want trouble.  He got close to my bubble before he backed off and made some snide comment.  I got in the car with my family and drove off.

Every fiber in my monkey brain wanted to disassemble the guy.  Even after I was driving off I had this odd sense, almost like regret for not engaging with him.  My instinct, when I felt my family threatened pushed me towards that in an almost uncontrollable way, and I'd be lying if I said my ego didnt feel a tiny bit bruised apologizing to this guy for a parking spot I took to take care of my kids.  But my training took over, and I de-escalated and my kids, wife and myself were uninjured.  That's the goal.

I dont know how crazy his wife was, or he was, or if either of them had a gun or knife, or if his nutty uncle was in the trunk waiting to jump out.  I dont know if they were trained.  I dont know that I wouldnt have knocked him down and his head would have smacked the concrete killing him.  Any of those scenarios would have been tragic, and they would have been tragic in front of my kids.  Even if it had gone text book correctly my kids would have witnessed that violence.

I also remind myself that he didnt know if I was crazy, had a gun or knife, was trained.  Yet he risked that with a small child in his back seat.  He risked that because he had to park 20 feet further away.  That's foolish.

Krav Maga isnt about trying to be the toughest kid on the block, winning a combat sport cage match, or proving how tough you are.  We use our brains first."
kravmaga,fe4f6ey,t1_fe46ms9,1578858647.0,"I understand where you're going with all this now, at least a little better than was presented in this and the post from a few days ago.  You're correct on some levels and this is a conversation that should be being addressed among all practitioners and instructors, at least in my opinion.  But, it does need to be had in a constructive way, and it does need to take everything into account.

There's a principle in fights that no fight will ever follow your expectations or some prescribed series of actions.  If the opponent is trained or not trained is irrelevant, they are going to do what they are going to do and you cannot control that precisely.  This is why I avoid technique-training (step A leads to step B leads to step C), and focus on knowing what to do in familiar positions.  The only real control you can exert on the pace of the engagement is that instant where you force them into an involuntary reaction - that's the ideal space to be in, at least IMO.

There's another issue which is that you should definitely be practicing as if your opponent is trained and skilled.  However you do have to actually LEARN first.  If I just toss you into a sparring situation with a black belt from day one, you're not going to learn much if anything.  Ideally you want to learn the specifics of what you're doing through drills, and then practice it in simulation or sparring against someone who is at a higher level of proficiency than you.  Hopefully that higher level person can sort of dial in their resistance to a place just above where you are to force you to improve.  There's skill in that on both sides.

Look, like I said, I train people that have zero experience, people that were/are boxers, people that do BJJ too and I even have one guy who is proficient in Escrima.  I'm all about the cross training thing.  I personally think wrestling is a great compliment to Krav Maga.

With all that said, for practical application on the street, I think the fundamentals of Krav Maga are solid.  I think going to the ground is a bad idea in a street fight, no matter how good you are, so I don't teach to drive the engagement to the ground and submit someone.  I think avoiding conflict by either being aware enough of your surroundings to not be in it in the first place or by deescalating it is superior to engaging in a fight (for exactly the reason that you don't know how trained the other person is, or if they have a knife, or if they have a gun, or how crazy they are, or if they have friends).  If that is unavoidable, then I think the best course of action is to engage with everything you have driving to a point where the attacker is neutralized as a threat - not by exchanging kicks and punches until someone hits the ground, but by driving to a position where you can control their movements and smash something vital.

This isn't a sport.  There aren't any points to be won.  Trading blows with someone is gambling - don't gamble."
kravmaga,fe3sfgo,t1_fe2rrdp,1578852439.0,"With all due respect, if you take Krav Maga and this is reflective of how you're being taught you should find a new school.

I'll agree with you that training as if your opponent is untrained, and only training that way, is sub optimal.  However, you seem to be under a misconception that all self defense (Krav included) works on compliant training partners.  I'm sure some do.  That's not how I was taught, that's not how I teach.

It seems to me you have this impression that MMA is just ""better"".  If that's the case you should pursue it."
kravmaga,fe0h9yf,t3_enhrjm,1578813420.0,"I'm not sure this is even a practical question, in fact I think this is the old ""my system is the best system and your system sucks"" argument in different window dressing.  I don't see how it is particularly useful unless we are going to really dissect it.

The first and most important thing is that there is no way you can say you'll win 100% of engagements 100% of the time.  If you're fighting an untrained attacker, you're likely to win.  If you're fighting a trained attacker, you're not as likely to win.  That goes for any system, not just MMA.

Secondly, what specifically is it about MMA that you believe will make them ""better"" in a fight against a KM practitioner?  Is it the grappling and manipulation of BJJ (I'd say that's a strong one)?  Is it that they train constantly so they are in a high state of fitness to fight (I'd say that's a strong one too)?  The kickboxing / muay thai part probably less so.  If that's the case you have to consider time advantage...which leads me to:

If you're going to spend 5+ days a week at the gym and training to fight, do MMA if that's your thing.  Maybe though, you could take the extra time and take BJJ, or Escrima, or Muay Thai.  Maybe you could take what you've learned and bring it back to your KM school and integrate it into your program.  Take the useful and let go of the stuff that isn't useful.  You don't need to abandon KM because it is weak in one area, that's sort of the beauty of KM.

In the end, I think most importantly, it is about practical application.  What are you really trying to learn and teach?  At my school we teach more than just fighting, we teach situational awareness, practical threat assessments and things of that nature - the stuff self defense is made of.  The goal of KM outside a military setting is about engaging, disabling and escaping a threat, it's not about who can beat up whom in a cage match.  Fairly regularly we have Kenpo, Muay Thai, Escrima, BJJ and other practitioners come in and do clinics so we can expand our skillset.  If we ever got to a place where we felt like KM was complete or the end-all-be-all of martial arts it just wouldn't be KM anymore.

TL;DR: If you're taking KM for self-defense and want to get serious about it, cross train and incorporate what you learn into your KM.  If you're taking KM because you want to the best fighter around, maybe MMA is the way to go."
kravmaga,fdl1pwe,t3_elwry2,1578515527.0,"47 y/o.  
Definitely stretch.  Definitely get some cardio in during the off days.  Definitely ""warm up"" prior to class.  
I find eating properly before class boosts my energy level as well.  
If you don't stretch and warm up, you're going to get injured and recovery when you're older takes a hell of a lot longer."
kravmaga,fdieibe,t1_fdi1ldz,1578441091.0,Another vote for kali/escrima.  It is a good complement to KM - especially if you consider improvised weapons.
kravmaga,fdfw8vc,t3_el685y,1578371900.0,"It is possible to learn the basics, but not in a way that can or will really help you in a real life situation.

bestof,fdcutxt,t1_fdcnfxb,1578284947.0,"I dont want to be in the unenviable position of having to defend Trump, but I'll give you a bit...
The very first item in the list is a stretch by even the most generous of interpretations.  The emoluments clause is pretty loose in terms of execution and frankly if you're going to go after Trump for that you have to accept that pretty much every member of congress on both sides is more directly guilty.
A considerable number of the sources are not exactly what one might call reputable, so theres a problem there too.
The last item isnt really an item.  He was under no obligation to testify.  He chose not to.  It is bad form.  It isnt a crime.
As bad as ""whatabout"" is, keep in mind that the obstruction he was impeached for wasnt nearly as extensive as the obstruction Clinton was impeached for.  Clinton had witness tampering in there too.  So it is sort of hard to make a good faith argument about the horrors of that without being equally disgusted with Clinton.
I'd add a final word, which is that exhaustive lists like this are typically more about tactic than content.  The OP seems to be tossing a bunch of spaghetti at the wall.  That leaves the person you are arguing with in the position where they must refute all of the argument - which is a disadvantageous position as the OP had all the time in the world to do their research.  Further if you made the argument this way, even if some of the points were proved invalid you could simply say ""but what about the rest of them"", and the other person would have to stipulate to at least a few.  The net result is that all the spaghetti sticks, even if some of it is not good.
You're unlikely to find yourself in a nuanced debate on Trump as everyone has pretty much chosen a side, donned their team jersey, and pre-judged what is right and wrong without regard to the details."
bestof,fdctykt,t1_fdclw5h,1578284238.0,"What bit is my feelings?  I didnt even comment on whether I think the OP is correct.  My comment was purely that this sub has become a typical reddit ""I hate Trump more"" circle jerk.
One can easily formulate an argument as to why Trump is unfit for the presidency.  Yet, the OP links some rando who used shady and unreliable sources to make a list of arguments that is more focused on having a bunch of things in it rather than quality things in it.

Accuracy is like relative ""closeness"" to a thing.  It is accurate, for example to say that yellow is a color.
Precision is the degree of exactness to a thing.  Is is more precise to say that yellow is a bright color, and even more precise to say that it is a bright color near green on the light spectrum.
It is accurate to say that pi is 3.14.  The more numbers you add the more precise it is."
