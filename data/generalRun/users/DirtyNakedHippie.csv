AskReddit,feuugdt,t3_eqies2,1579390042.0,"One morning a few years ago, I woke up a couple hours early to go pee.  Did that and went back to sleep.

2-3 hours later I wake up normally, and have to pee again.  

I stand in front of the toilet and...there's a fresh turd at the bottom of the bowl.  I live alone, except for a cat.  It was not mine, and it certainly wasn't the cat's.  I'm not saying I just didn't remember taking a dump; I'm saying I checked and it didn't come out of me.  There was no toilet paper in the bowl, and my sphincter region was clean.

I immediately checked both doors and every damn spot a person could possibly hide in the apartment.

By a couple hours later, I'd convinced myself it had been some sort of bizarre waking dream.  But the same thing happened again about a week later, only I'd been awake and in my office only a few feet away, the entire time in between toilet visits.

Logically, it had to have been a plumbing issue, but I'm still not 100% certain that I didn't have a ghost pooper."
