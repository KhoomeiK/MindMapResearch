Wildlife,ffm612b,t1_ffk2xvm,1580049173.0,"The difference is wolves are a native species that actually have an important role to play in the ecosystems they inhabit.  Those professionals (like Leopold himself) later realized the error in their earlier thinking and changed their views on wolves.  

In Australia, New Zealand, Germany along with some other Eastern European countries, lethal control of feral and free roaming cats is widely practiced.  Provincial and state wildlife agencies here in North America also have a quietly practiced policy of encouraging trappers not to report feral and free roaming cats that they capture.  The practice is very much ongoing and while crazy cat activists will still decry many organized culling efforts, I wouldn’t ever say that it’s impossible.  The other good thing too is that with the expansion of urban/suburban coyote populations, we’re getting some free assistance in controlling feral and free-roaming cats.  I say all this as a former cat owner who had to put down his beloved indoor cat just a few months ago."
conservation,ffj64db,t1_ffj3wkj,1579991357.0,"I’m glad we share similar thoughts than. Large carnivore management is very difficult I agree.

Regarding extirpation, I thought you meant species where state sanctioned actions were being taken to actively extirpate a species within its borders.  That’s my bad for not being clearer.  

The issue with wolf delisting is quite complex and there are bad actors in both the pro-wolf and anti-wolf lobbies.  The pro-wolf litigious groups latch onto the wolf issue because it’s great for fundraising, yet will never concede to any management plans that a state would propose.  Likewise the anti-wolf people that spout such bullshit as “smoke a pack a day” aren’t helping their cause at all at getting wolves delisted.  The hunting wouldn’t be indiscriminate however, it would be managed like every other game animal.  But the wolf issue is probably a topic best left for another time."
conservation,ffj0s7p,t1_ffiw23o,1579987504.0,"I'm not sure why you shared the ADN article.  It highlighted that overall the harvest isn't a problem so long as it's sustainable and that polar bear experts widely support the hunt by the Inuit.  Even the recent [status report](http://pbsg.npolar.no/export/sites/pbsg/en/docs/2019-StatusReport.pdf) by the IUCN Polar Bear Specialist Group indicates that overall harvest rates are sustainable and if they are deemed unsustainable quotas and harvest rates are decreased.  If there is an increase in killing of bears for human protection, than the quotas are allocated accordingly by the regulatory bodies and Inuit hunters.  And that specialist group directly advises the regulatory bodies that allocate quotas to Inuit hunters.

Regarding your other articles, there's a substantial difference between a hunter accidentally shooting a lone wolf and mistaking it for a coyote, than an actual concerted effort by a state wildlife agency to extirpate a species as your initial comment stated.  That simply will not happen.  Wolves will never be able to recolonize all parts of their former range like Iowa.  Human-wolf conflict and lack of suitable habitat will keep them out. Grey wolves if they are delisted will simply return to state management like black bears, bobcats, coyotes and other predator species.  None of which there are active measures to extirpate them."
conservation,ffirwj1,t1_ffipnq5,1579981176.0,"There are no citations for the claims that polar bear hunting will drive the species to extinction in this article. It's a click bait article designed to provoke an emotional reaction from the lay public who do not understand the complexities of polar bear management, nor the importance of these hunts to the Inuit. The link I provided discusses how these quotas are set, which is done so using a mix of western science and traditional ecological knowledge provided by Inuit hunters. The particular excerpt that was shared provides the counterargument to the article. The Inuit in Canada have a constitutionally protected right to hunt in Canada so they will continue to hunt polar bears regardless if ""trophy hunting"" is banned. And thanks to their deep knowledge of the Arctic landscape, they will be the first to raise the alarm if their hunting is unsustainable as it's a critical part of their livelihoods.

Can you provide a citation for any state actually extirpating large predators in the 21st century through unsustainable hunting mortality? In the past sure, but it's a very slippery slope to say that state or federal governments will purposely drive species to extinction/extirpation in the modern day."

During my undergraduate degree (wildlife biology) when we had our mandatory trapper education training, the trapper who did the training talked at length about the issue with dogs getting caught in snares (as it was a local issue).  Essentially a dog that knows not to pull/strain when it feels pressure on it's collar or leash will be perfectly fine in a snare.  He had caught dogs before (not dogs that were out for a walk with their owners, but those that were allowed to roam at large which is illegal) and the ones that were fine were the ones that clearly had proper leash training as they were waiting calmly to be released and had not fought the snare or panicked. When coyotes, foxes or other furbearers are caught with snares, they tend to run and panic when in the snare which triggers the locking mechanism which if properly set, dispatches the animal quickly."
nature,ff7nhe8,t3_es3459,1579653770.0,"There's nothing inherently wrong with hunting coyotes from a population perspective as hunting mortality is compensatory and it helps ensure that a healthy fear of humans exists within the population.

But I agree with other posters that these contests in particular put a black eye on the hunting community and it's not something we should be promoting within our ranks lest we want people to turn against hunting altogether.

As we speak, countless insular species are threatened with extinction due to the impacts of invasives.  We can either sit on our hands and allow them to cause extinctions or sit on our hands because we didn't have the stomach to do what needed to be done.  [This](https://dlnr.hawaii.gov/blog/2020/01/07/nr20-004/?fbclid=IwAR20lWaTtRn57lXNK5ookWgp_OugN8QZ-9QvFaGG411MizY1txeO-Z-SgQo) was a news release from just two days ago highlighting the impact of invasives on threatened island species and the need for control and eradication.  I am dissuading no facts, or providing inaccurate information.  Invasive species are a real threat to ecosystems across the world.  It's as real as climate change.     

You have to realize that wildlife conservation is driven by what's referred to as the land ethic that "" A thing is right when it tends to preserve the integrity, stability, and beauty of the biotic community. It is wrong when it tends otherwise"".  Animal rights philosophy has no use in practical wildlife conservation.  Furthermore, you're misunderstanding of the central ""theme"" of conservation is lacking.  Conservation understands that humans are part of the ecosystems we inhabit, for better or worse, and seeks to see us to limit our negative impacts (of which introducing invasive species is one), restore functioning ecosystems, and utilize resources sustainably.

Most invasive species were historical introductions, particularly in insular systems like Australia.  In this example, camels were introduced for work purposes, than liberated when they were of no use.  We didn't begin to understand the impacts of invasive species until the 1950s.  We can't change history, but we can change the future and work to right the wrongs of the past.  If you seriously want to have a conversation about whether or not humans are an invasive species or not, than I don't know what to tell you.  We're technically invasive everywhere except our native Africa.  If you want to eradicate humans or oust people off their lands, than please be my guest.  But the conservation movement has long had a dark history of outing people (particularly indigenous peoples) off their lands for conservation purposes that we've only recently begun to right the wrongs of.  The indigenous peoples who called for this camel cull have been in Australia for 30,000 years.  I don't think they would appreciate me saying that they should be removed from the landscape."

Yes lethal management of overabundant populations is managing a symptom, but the alternative for some populations may be extirpation.  Take the case study of mountain caribou in BC.  Habitat alteration is the primary factor in how other ungulates like whitetails and moose entered caribou range which subsequently brought in wolves and other predators that preyed on the vulnerable predator population.  You can either wait until the habitat is restored which may take centuries, or you eliminate the largest mortality source and prevent that population from being lost for good.s
