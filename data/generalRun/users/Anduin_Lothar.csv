OldSchoolCool,ffuuwuh,t1_ffujuur,1580249803.0,Ashbringer as well. Their music isn't political but they are a leftist band from minnesota.
2meirl4meirl,ffq4q7v,t3_etznam,1580120377.0,Me at the last 2 parties I was I invited to (and those friends dont ask me to go out anymore and rarely talk to me)
EscapefromTarkov,ffj47xj,t3_etwmmw,1579989974.0,Did you make it out with all the loot?
EscapefromTarkov,ffj4070,t3_etwq9m,1579989817.0,I like your sweater
titanfall,ffdbvq6,t1_ffdbqkd,1579817569.0,Yeah I agree with that.
titanfall,ffdbifn,t1_ffc6ijo,1579817325.0,"iirc Black Ops 2 had a system similar to that but it still allowed achievements. You could choose your loadout, including grenades, gadgets, and attachments at the start, from an array of weapons from the past and future."
2meirl4meirl,ffd3se8,t3_ess0qp,1579812860.0,who even has that many people to reach out to?
EscapefromTarkov,ffcx3er,t1_ffcrg1f,1579809079.0,Mayo + propital is an easier and cheaper way of getting it done
EscapefromTarkov,ff9s4ao,t1_ff9nwv8,1579719995.0,Kiver with faceshield is my go to 'middle ground' helmet when I dont wanna be totally cheap or totally expensive with my loadout.
HumansAreMetal,ff8bkof,t3_es2r80,1579671958.0,/r/titlegore is gonna have a field day with this one.

Here is what they look like with metro shift. I normally use Gambit Celadon and they look the same type of fit to me tbh."

DestinyTheGame,ff70sfc,t1_ff6z869,1579638838.0,The only reason now to do the puzzle is for the lore pages and emblem.
DestinyTheGame,ff6i9t3,t1_ff6i54a,1579627783.0,"I'm not entirely sure. On this character I did all of the quests to save Saint, so maybe those are prerequisites?"

How shiny was their future rad steam engine?"
EscapefromTarkov,ff3phhz,t3_er9upk,1579546050.0,Simply running offline maps with friends would be neat imo. It would be helpful for teaching and practicing group play.
EscapefromTarkov,ff3nctb,t3_er8h4o,1579544746.0,"1917 is probably now in my top 5 after seeing it a few days ago. I'll be seeing it for a second time soon with family members who haven't seen it yet.

That being said it personally didn't make me think of Tarkov while I was watching it, but looking back on it, it certainly does capture the frantic, intense, and sometimes lonely moments of a game like tarkov well."
EscapefromTarkov,ff3mm8y,t1_ff2swar,1579544287.0,"In what ways at all did it copy Dunkirk? There were similar themes, and while comparable it by no means felt like a copy."
EscapefromTarkov,ff3mdkh,t1_ff2p5mm,1579544136.0,"I 100% agree. I found it very comparable to Dunkirk, but I found it more emotional, existential, and written with a more personal story that made me more invested. I absolutely love both movies, but I would personally put 1917 above Dunkirk."
EscapefromTarkov,ff3l662,t1_ff3fre0,1579543389.0,"Yes, it does. I've been using it on my hunters for the last week or so."
EscapefromTarkov,ff3l4o0,t1_ff39xj1,1579543364.0,It is true. It's my favorite sidemount to run on the Hunter since it doesn't cover part of my screen like the others do by jutting out so much.

EscapefromTarkov,ff0ycjh,t3_eqtda4,1579473459.0,"For point 11 you should probably mention that Car kits, IFAKs, Salewas, and the grizzly kit (which also acts as a splint) act both as a bandage and hp heal."
