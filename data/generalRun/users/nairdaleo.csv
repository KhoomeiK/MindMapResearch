This is why the government needs to make smart decisions that makes sense instead of just relying on the table. They either overlooked the fact that young drivers were going to be shafted or they saw it and thought like you, that we'd just have to live with it. 

It's ludicrous because of the points made: that a vehicle a young driver would have is statistically worth a lot less than the vehicle of a seasoned driver, and thus the responsibility of ICBC to that driver's damaged goods is inherently less. I had a car worth 4000 CAD and my insurance is 6000 CAD/yr? Why would I bother?

It's ludicrous too to damage done to other parties by the young driver because they either won't pay and drive, or won't drive and get the necessary experience to get better. Notice How I'm intentionally excluding those who will pay and drive, because they are not an issue here, they never were. 

If the whole purpose of the ICBC graduated-whatever-driving program is to create better drivers that cost less to insure, then having a chunk of them drive uninsured or not drive at all is completely counteractive. 

So yeah, just as how the old subsidize the young's education, so too with driving, the young require a subsidy. 

Let me ask you: do you want better drivers on the road? Because charging them 6000/yr for the privilege is not going to achieve that."

Go to some spreadsheet software and do the following:

1. Pick some categories that make sense for you, here's some useful suggestions:
   1. Residence
   2. Services
   3. Groceries
   4. Restaurants
   5. Entertainment
   6. Transportation
   7. Income
   8. Other
2. Put ALL movements into an easy-to ready tabular form such as:

|*Date*|*Amount*|*Type*|*Comment*|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|1 Feb 2020|$1000|Income|Current savings|
|1 Feb 2020|\-$1000|Residence|Rent|
|1 Feb 2020|\-$6|Restaurants|Lunch at work|
|2 Feb 2020|\-$30|Restaurants|Date night|
|2 Feb 2020|\-$100|Groceries||
|2 Feb 2020|$2700|Income|Salary|

Etc etc, you get the point. 

On another sheet, you'll analyze this data.

I've taken the liberty of making [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1E1y8zYbitLWoL_-c6Dk2nOgukUTtNQUmfcOmJMDw43o/edit?usp=sharing) for you, but you cannot modify it. Download it or duplicate it into your own account so your expenses are only visible to you.

Once you see what your money is doing, you can make a budget:

$2700 / mo

Look at the makeup of your expenses:

1. Residence = 1000
2. Services = 50
3. Groceries = 250
4. Restaurants = 200
5. Entertainment = 50
6. Transportation = 700
7. Other = 50

Budget total: 2300 / mo. Current leftover: $400/mo. At this rate, It'll take about 4 years to pay off that easy financial loan.

Not great if you want to pay off that loan before it accumulates. Perhaps for the next 18 months or so, you need to tighten your belt to come up with an extra $600:

1. Residence = 1000 (cannot change rent)
2. Services = 30 (cancelled 2 services... e.g., can't afford prime and spotify at the moment)
3. Groceries = 200 (stopped buying those expensive drinks)
4. Restaurants = 40 (bring lunch to work, eat out only twice per month, and cheaply)
5. Entertainment = 10 (go out only once or twice)
6. Transportation = 700 (still need gas and a car)
7. Other = 10 (being more frugal, only spend where necessary)

New budget total: 1990. Current leftover: $710/mo. At this rate, it will take 18 months to pay off that easy financial loan.

And well, as other people have suggested, you can tighten your belt even further by removing the car from the equation, that's an easy +$500/mo to your accounting, with which you can pay off that loan in around 9 months.

**The important part** is knowing what your money is doing so you know how to manipulate it: where are you spending too much and what you can live without, at least temporarily.

Remember that once that loan is gone, you can go back to a higher level of comfort, but as you said: you made a mistake, and well, now you have to pay for it. It's not too late, you can definitely fix it, but you will have to suffer the consequences of this mistake."

2. A robot is just as good as its sensors, and no sensor is infallible. Even with redundancy they still need constant babysitting. 

3. AI destroying stuff is just an exaggeration; the takeaway from the exaggerated example is that there are unwanted and unknown consequences to letting AI guide the decision making process. Say you’ve made absolutely certain it won’t wipe out a country, so AI instead sends 7 Trillion twinkies to Uganda. To us that’s unacceptable and stupid, but to the code that was perfectly reasonable (high caloric content, slow expiration). AI is just not smart enough for that yet. 

We really don’t let computers yet make important decisions, even Amazon and Google, who possess some of the most impressively trained AI out there still have people in director roles and have their AIs encapsulated into providing *suggestions* but **never** with executive power. 

The only company out there who’s letting robots take the wheel literally is Tesla, and sure, the results are impressive but:

1. There’s a lot of people out there who still want to be the captain of their own vehicle. 

2. Even with its impressive array of modern, expensive sensors, [Tesla cars still crash](https://www.autopilotreview.com/tesla-autopilot-accidents-causes/) without an attentive person at the wheel. 

3. [Because of its](https://youtu.be/9mcT_j0hX3U) [impressively complex](https://youtu.be/fKyUqZDYwrU) [array of code and sensors](https://youtu.be/UCZ56T16wvc) [it is really](https://youtu.be/q3mh-Iq_Dew) [hard to make](https://youtu.be/OdPE2WRSTw0) [it predictable](https://youtu.be/GxhNAN80c5s). And those are all examples from the biggest and boldest AI on the planet. 

Even the most tried and true version of autopilot, the one used by commercial airlines, still needs two trained professional babysitting it.

So yeah, humans are making better executive decisions than robots do all the time. That there’s war and famine just shows you how difficult governing really is, and if we humans still fuck it up, you can’t expect anything we’ve built to perform any better, specially not an AI that can be fooled so easily as what we currently have.

Oh and by the way, any robot can be hacked if there’s enough incentive to do so. And “incentive” for a lot of people can be “I’m bored. I want to destroy something”. Don’t believe me? Head over to 4chan."

Toner needs to be affixed to paper with high temperature, high temperatures mean some shit goes through a chemical reaction that also gets in the air. 

Probably not a big deal though, I’d imagine you’d need to have that printer working 24/7 right where you sleep for it to be of any consequence. That being said, there’s likely zero effects to air quality from an inkjet, which does indeed make them marginally better for air quality."

Think of the plague in Europe, although about half of the population died and it had a mortality rate of like 100% (at the time, even today it’s about 66%) the other 50% took some manner of precautions and never caught it. 

Think of SARS, the other corona virus that scared the world: 8100 cases, 9% mortality rate across 17 countries, one of which was China. That’s at least a billion and a half people in the epicentre of exposure, but they took precautions and only 8100 got infected. 

So no, it’s not better to just get it."
