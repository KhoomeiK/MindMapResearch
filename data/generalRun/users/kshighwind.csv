cursedcomments,ff3gxjy,t1_ff34woh,1579540799.0,I know this is a funny urban legend and I'm not dragging it but I'd actually like to know if you're aware of any reliable sources about the crab/lobster release legend? The urban legend about the Chihuahua stolen off the porch makes the rounds too but there's much more information on that.
AskVet,ff3g18f,t1_ff33wgw,1579540295.0,"I agree, there's no more time for debating a course of action. You know your cat best but as a general guideline, if a cat is still eating and seeking affection (for immobile cats verbal greeting, cheek rubbing when pet) then it still has a life to live.
If finances are an issue, consider starting a GoFundMe ASAP and sharing with friends, family, and local rescue groups. The sooner you start it the more funds you'll have available to make a decision. You always have the option of refunding donors if you don't end up needing the money, and sharing a crisis fund with rescue/adoption/pet groups is also a great way to find people who may have experienced something similar, or may have a specific veterinarian to recommend."
curledfeetsies,feny36p,t3_eq3hkc,1579292556.0,"Damn...Losing your baby's babies is tough.  Remember that kittens have a very high infant mortality rate due to a high rate of congenital heart and brain defects - things that you and mom could never have known about or done anything to fix or even prevent.
Please keep a close eye on mom for any signs of prolonged lethargy, pain, trouble urinating, or infection. Make sure that when her babies are nursing, they're actually getting milk, and make sure mom is eating more food than normal.

Please keep a close eye on mom for any signs of prolonged lethargy, pain, trouble urinating, or infection. If you need help finding low or no cost spaying in your area please let me know. Now that she's had kittens she will be more prone to uterine or cervical cancer and it's much easier to avoid that before it starts than to treat it.

Are you doing okay? Do you have someone you can talk to? A lot of us grow up with the impression that our pets or their litters are not valid reasons for grief, but that's an impression created on us by people who care so little for any life other than their own that they barely qualify as human."
