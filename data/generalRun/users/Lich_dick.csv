MetalMemes,feedyoy,t1_fee87bg,1579031783.0,"In doom my favourites are Krux and Warning.

I'd say from traditional I really enjoy king diamond, cirith ungol and candle (although this leans more towards power metal I think)

And last but not least in death metal my favourite bands are bolt thrower, coffin dust, and deceased... (Mainly their last album)

I hope this kinda sketches an idea of what im looking for"

Ive gone through all the old school stuff in each genre. But trying to find good new bands that dont just rip-off older stuff is pretty hard to do. And just picking a few at random from the archives isn't the most efficient way of going about it."

MetalMemes,fe4ov5b,t1_fe3jozt,1578861492.0,With pirate metal i get your reasoning. But with viking metal you'd need to tell me its melodic death metal with viking themes. Or else id be thinking that you would mean viking metal (the genre)
thrashmetal,fe4o2s1,t3_enssah,1578861232.0,"Im a teen aswell, but here is my take on it. Back in the day it used be the direct step up from heavyness from traditional heavy metal. It was the hottest and evilest sounding thing out there. Nowadays i would consider alot of thrash to not even be on the extreme side of metal. Thrash has kinda become stale. And not alot of people want to hear new bands playing the same stuff the old bands played but worse.

It is slowly becoming a more niche genre as the main spotlight is moved away. But innovation and good refreshing music can still be found in thrash. Its just not as easy to find as it used to be"

So really get what you are saying"
depression,fdgie1c,t3_el8rwc,1578398078.0,"Im depressed because of stuff that happened when I was a child. Physical abuse, parental neglect, divorce, loved one commiting suicide, loved one dying from a disease. Hearing a loved one get raped. During the span of a month.

Combine that with lonliness from having switched schools this year.

I cant really accurately say why these things fucked me and what needs to happen to fix it. I think that the the probability of these things having an effect on me is pretty high. I just cant pinpoint in what way."

depression,fdgfam0,t3_el7pcw,1578394126.0,"I agree with that sentiment. My dreams are never fun though and are almost always very stressfull. But they usually end in a very soothing way.

 For example today I had a dream where I was at work and my boss was ordering me around and constantly yelling at me. And in this dream I would be so tired that I could barely work. Every single bone in my body ached and my stress was through the roof. Untill in this dream I suddenly collapsed, on the ground unable to move anymore. And everyone was really worried calling an ambulance etc. But I was finally able to get some peace and quiet and didnt feel the pain anymore. Just pure serenity."

Sure metal as a genre is more on the heavy side of the spectrum. But there are different music genres that are even ""heavier"" than metal but are clearly not metal."
