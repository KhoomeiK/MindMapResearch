Sorry I'm not familiar with the hunting scene, but from what I've read searching Google and from quite a few users in this sub, I gathered that he was a pro who was rather well regarded in the scene. 

I give him a pass because while there's bullshit, it's probably under the 25% mark, which is good in this field! I just want the content man, but I accept that eventually I will probably end up in your camp as he inevitably fails to produce anything of note! His little snide remarks on Dr. Meldrum are fucking silly to the point of being pathetic as well. OK you're a firm believer in them being more than flesh and blood but they still leave footprints and you really really can't understate Meldrums importance in that regard. He's an idiot for that. But some of my favourite artists have made shit music and films, and we all have our flaws..... It is what it is!!

Look at it this way, is there anybody more qualified to dip their toes in the water? If he was any more of a woodsman he'd be a wild animal. For sure he's a little aloof and arrogant but he's had his own encounters, is a top hunting guide, and spends more time in the bush than anyone else.
