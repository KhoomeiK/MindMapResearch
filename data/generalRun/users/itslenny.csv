webdev,felv5v3,t1_felrips,1579231724.0,"You seem to think this is some kinda pissing contest. Not sure why. Experience is just to know when it's time to move to the next tech, when the thing you've invested in is dying, I used to teach so your reaction reminded me of my students. If you don't like being uncomfortable, learning new tech constantly and learning things that will inevitably become outdated / useless this isn't a great field.

webdev,felpa16,t1_fellwpe,1579227621.0,"I wasn't mocking you.

AskReddit,fdylnko,t1_fdwpk8m,1578781151.0,"Yeah, I remember when Uber launched it was only black cars (limo) service and they were more expensive than cabs, it was a luxury service mostly used to impress your date when your ""personal"" driver pulled up. Then it became really wide spread. 

THEN, Lyft came out which allowed regular people to drive and ""ride share"" was born. Uber responded with UberX which is the same thing."
