Lenovo,ffxavtu,t3_evqd6s,1580321382.0,Samsung EVO 970 mate. Great product.
pcmasterrace,ffwn5pm,t3_evkwm0,1580306053.0,Is there a link for amazon
survivinginfidelity,ffv8smm,t1_ffux5n0,1580258397.0,"You are not a failure by any means . Like most parents. I am sure you taught your daughter the difference between right and wrong. She did this to herself , and she must redeem herself without any help from anyone. Just let her know you are there for her and that is all. As someone else has said. Your SIL will most probably never be the same person he was as they explained it very clearly. Good luck to you. This is not your fault."
survivinginfidelity,ffv7y1w,t1_ffuf6eb,1580257828.0,"Wow, you are good."
survivinginfidelity,ffv7nqk,t1_ffuedw4,1580257632.0,Well said. Cheaters think it's okay to cheat. As you said. Somewhere they came to believe that this was okay behavior. These people are flawed. There is a short circuit in their wiring. These people need help  and need to work hard to turn their life around. No one should ever feel sorry for cheaters. Cause they knew what they were doing was wrong. Many of these people have low self esteem/worth. They succumb to the short lived dopamine rush. Usually their are many red flags with these people that many of you should not ignore. If you think your SO would never cheat on you. Then it's probably happened already.
survivinginfidelity,ffv65gy,t1_ffuxdur,1580256602.0,"Please be careful. Cheaters will lie and deny. Straight to your face over and over, and not blink an eye."
survivinginfidelity,ffv5tqc,t1_ffuqyf7,1580256376.0,There are drugs and other bad influences out there in many cities and towns around the world including many in the US. As I have mentioned before. Everyone has a choice and decision to go down that road. Some people are wired that way. The others don't care and wish they were dead. These people had opportunities to take the right path and they chose not to. Some realized their mistakes and got better and turned their lives around. We can't blame ourselves for their poor decisions. We cannot be enablers for these people. You make sure your daughter works hard to earn your trust back. Good luck to you.
survivinginfidelity,ffv4ij7,t1_ffuq2du,1580255485.0,"Remember they made the choices and decisions. Not you. They must face the consequences of their actions and behavior. You mom, did nothing wrong."

OP don't do anything rash. You have your kids to think about. Yes, things all look crazy now and you are feeling hurt. But you will survive this. It does get better and you will start another chapter in your life without your cheating wife. You will probably find a gf eventually. Let that anger settle and you shall find the peace in yourself."

Until it just got to sad and depressing. It's been about 2 yrs now. I was near the cemetery a couple months ago visiting friends. Which is about an hour from me. I just couldn't do it. It's just to traumatic for me at least. But to each there own. You do what is best for you. After all this I have decided that I want to be cremated and my ashes spread out over the ocean that I have always loved.
