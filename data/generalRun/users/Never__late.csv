He liked to run up and down my hallways listening to his own insanely loud Bengal ""WwryOOOhhhhhHHH?!"" noises bounce of the walls. He could open my pantry door and scale 6 shelves to find his stupid cat meatstick treats and eat the whole bag. He was there through 3 cities, 3 jobs, another degree - every second of every fucking day. We used to joke that he knew which of my friends were legit by whether this cat liked them or avoided them - guess which friends are still around and legit, and which arent? Cats, man...
