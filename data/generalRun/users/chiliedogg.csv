If you can buy a house for cash or get a 30-yr loan with 4% interest, get the loan every time. Put that cash into the market where it'll get an average return of about 7%. Use the interest on the market returns to pay the mortgage and you'll have a house and way more cash in the end. 

Is the same reason that the US national debt isn't a big problem. The interest on the national debt is lower than inflation, so defecit spending is actually cheaper than just paying cash."

explainlikeimfive,fedsc2h,t1_fedql80,1579018843.0,"I've never noticed it just looking through the scope, so it may be an artifact of being out of focus, the longer exposure, wobble, or something else. At that zoom Leven the moon is moving pretty quickly across the field of view, so I'm kinda rushed to get the moon in view, start the 10-second timer to reduce the shake from hitting the shutter (phone is mounted using a Phone Skope), and capture the image.

I think a remote switch and a tripod designed for that kind of weight (I'm using a tripod for my old handicam with a 5lb optic, phone, and mounting bracket) would help a lot.

I'm actively looking for a good tripod in the $300 range. It's infuriating to use my scope right now. It was a gift from Vortex for selling a bunch of their stuff, otherwise I wouldn't have bought this kind of optic without proper mounting."

It's a $2000 MSRP spotting scope made with spectacular glass and an 85mm objective, but glass can only do so much.

But it could have been in better focus. It's just hard to focus when the image is so shaky from the tripod. Just touching the focus wheel makes you lose the target at that zoom level."
