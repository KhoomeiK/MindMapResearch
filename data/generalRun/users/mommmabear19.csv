Marriage,fdzqetz,t1_fdznr4h,1578793395.0,I still get super self conscious after a shower. I just in general self conscious with high anxiety. Like I said I have a hard time getting out of my own head. Peraonally for me Marijuana has been the only thing that had helped!
Pets,fdw7e0a,t1_fdw6j2t,1578755874.0,Good! Just keep things calm for a few days. But also no flea and tick meds until you find out when his last dosing was. Because they will also really mess them up!
Marriage,fdw74pu,t3_en285x,1578755778.0,I am so glad you posted this. Because I myself go through this everytime... I have a hard time getting out of my own head... to be able to just lay there and enjoy it. I thought it was just me. Before our kid days I just used to smoke some weed and that helped immensely. So if you are in a place it is legal I definitely suggest it!
Pets,fdw4na1,t3_en73cb,1578755002.0,By any chance you didn't give him flea and tick medication? This happened to my parents dog when they got him... they didn't know his previous owner gave him a dosage already and they put a serestro (I know I probably butchered that name) collar on him and he shook like crazy! If so I suggest getting him to a vet..
Parenting,fdvxjon,t3_en73o3,1578752864.0,"I love this so much! 

But no lie  I was also kind of  hoping this was going to turn into ""and now that boy and I have been married for x years!"""
