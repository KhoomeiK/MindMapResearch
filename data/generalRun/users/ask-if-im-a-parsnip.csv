I can't help but feel that you are missing an important aspect of what it means to suffer from migraines-- modern medicine can do very little to help. Neurologists don't even know what causes them, nor why the prophylactics they prescribe happen to work. I didn't get a daith piercing because I'm an alternative medicine embracing hippie, I got one because I'm out of options. I've tried every triptan and preventative on the market including Botox. I will do the weirdest, dumbest shit imaginable to my body just for the vague chance that it might, maybe, in some way, help. 

By what mechanism would a daith piercing cause migraines to worsen in the long run? You just posted a wall of text about how they don't have any effect on migraines. It would be helpful if you clarified your position.

My $40 placebo does not detract from legitimate migraine research, so you will have to discuss your passion for continuing research with someone who can actually do something about it. Though in light of the growing Replication Crisis, I can't help but wonder whether even the most lauded migraine treatments are just really, really fancy placebos. It's a frightening thought, but it could be a true one. Maybe Bohr was right-- the world really is a lot weirder and less solid than it first appears.

Also, you are overstating the possible complications of a daith piercing. It's the same as any other ear piercing. In any case, I'm happy to let both my ears rot off at the slightest chance that my condition may improve."
