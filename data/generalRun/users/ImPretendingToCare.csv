sports,ffez6bh,t1_ffetvjd,1579871064.0,"This is the most underrated statement of life. You can like people for somethings but to try to like them for every single thing is ignorant. Everyone says they look at the cup half full but they really dont.

In relationships with people nothing is perfect. Once you learn to accept that you'll live such a peaceful life."

AskMen,ffepctv,t3_et62cc,1579858720.0,"Its not wrong to splurge on something nicer than average. We literally only have 1 life and itd be better to die knowing you drove nice cars than a camry your whole life.

I think the argument opposed is that you may have jumped on it wayyyy too soon  New job.. new pay.. etc. You should be patient and inteligently making decisions.

If you get a raise or a new better paying job its best to give it a few months to see how much youre really making and how comfortable you feel with this new money monthly.

Its always said if you want a nice car you better be able to afford it twice to have it, rather than just scraping your monthly funds to make it happen.

Dont move too quick.. Move intelligently."

medical,ffcwa13,t3_eswa3p,1579808592.0,"Calm down and breathe. Drink a lot of water. And see a Doctor as soon as possible.

I know its all too common to just say 'See a doctor'  but even the slightest possibility of a concussion is something that needs to be checked as fast as possible. Doctors are the only ones with that technology. 

Like a bite from a snake you dont know. Chances are youll be fine but unlike other ""just suck it up injuries"" its something you cant risk not being sure and MUST get checked out."
