Thinking that they’d engage in any discussion with anything resembling “good faith” is pointless. Downvote and move on; if the events leading up to where we are now haven’t convinced them that maybe they’re backing the wrong horse, some random internet commenter won’t be the one to tip the scales."
Damnthatsinteresting,ff8dbcw,t1_ff8a9o7,1579673760.0,"Takes a lot of balls to talk shit about someone’s post history when a brief glance at yours informs us that despite only being on here for like a day you’ve still done basically nothing but snarkily reply to people, and not even in a way that’s entertaining to read. Are you doing this as some kind of weird validation thing, or are you just a generally angry person looking to blow off steam? Either way I’m sorry dude."

iamverybadass,ff75zrf,t1_ff6wv0j,1579641800.0,If you’re not familiar with Jacob Wohl (the dude in the pic) I highly recommend you read up on him. He’s absolutely a douchey misogynistic racist but honestly those monikers don’t even get into the top 5 of terrible things he is. (He’s the guy who tried to convince everyone that Robert Mueller had an open sexual assault investigation against him; that lasted for about three days before he admitted that it was just a straight up lie.)
ENLIGHTENEDCENTRISM,ff6tnal,t1_ff6rodw,1579634643.0,"That’s the thing: you’re not *wrong*, but you came in and made a statement that requires a bit of expansion in order to be taken seriously, but just ignored all of the necessary nuance. Yes, Fox News and CNN are both bad. CNN is bad because it’s neoliberal sensationalism that pursues the same basic ends that most conservatives want but with a little bit of social justice sprinkled in here and there for optics. Fox News is literally state propaganda that publishes blatant lies and gets away with it because they’re technically “not a news outlet” even though they 100% are. So when you’ve got “eyeroll-inducing liberal fuckery” and “literal lies being reported on what is one step removed from regime-sponsored television” and you just say “both suck”, you’re not gonna get any brownie points."
ENLIGHTENEDCENTRISM,ff6t5tb,t1_ff6p7f2,1579634358.0,"Thinking back to my days in high school (I was a sophomore when my school saw the brunt of the changes), we definitely had an attitude of “fuck Michelle” about the whole thing. Take away a high schooler’s Vanilla Coke and Flamin’ Hot Cheetos and White Monster and they’re gonna get pretty fighty lol. We agreed that it was a *good* decision, and I went to a pretty liberal high school so we all liked most of the administration’s policies, but you’d occasionally hear “Man FUCK Michelle” from somewhere in the cafeteria, normally from someone who missed the dessert bar. Maybe this was a ploy to up his approval rating in the “15 year old Call of Duty chud” demo?"
instantkarma,ff661rq,t3_eruokd,1579619995.0,"I remember reading an article about this incident.

Games,ff3lprp,t1_ff37bvb,1579543725.0,"Blacklist got a lot of shit after the revealed that they were replacing Michael Ironside but honestly it’s a great game. Awesome level design; very satisfying gameplay whether you’re going Panther, Ghost, or Assault; your team is actually really fun to get to know; and the story is actually pretty good. The whole plane home base thing I felt was kinda tacked on (no idea why so many games decided they had to do the whole Mass Effect Normandy thing), and hearing Sam’s new voice actor talk to his grown daughter was really weird considering the dude sounds like he’s in his early 30s, but genuinely a very fun game, I enjoyed my time with it. It’s backwards compatible on the One I’m pretty sure."
todayilearned,ff2jcyb,t3_er6hp8,1579508761.0,"Goddamn it’s so sad to me how much HIV used to be  a source of such profound shame. I mean it’s not exactly “fun” to have it nowadays, but the idea that this condition that affected mainly the most vulnerable members of our society was not just ignored by but *actively laughed at* by world governments at the time, particularly the US, is just sickening beyond belief. Nowadays the idea of shunning or openly disparaging a person with HIV would piss off pretty much everyone except the most fucked up of people. I guess it goes to show that a society really *can* change for the better in certain circumstances."
IdiotsInCars,ff27i48,t1_ff20x3y,1579496032.0,Handguns should be illegal everywhere for people who witness a frustrating yet ultimately minor scenario and say “The only thing that would make this situation more palatable for me is if I had a gun.”
ENLIGHTENEDCENTRISM,ff1zphw,t1_ff1yjrn,1579489971.0,"Well I don’t definitely “know” anything because polls generally don’t ask this kind of question (I.e. “If your preferred candidate doesn’t win, will you vote at all yes or no?”), and even when they do ask those kinds of questions, it’s reasonable to assume that even a huge number of people who answer “yes” will stay home. The reason that I feel confident in that inference is based on the demographics of Bernie’s base. He has mobilized a HUGE cohort of people who, up until now, have had zero involvement or interest in politics. That’s where all of his money’s going- not ad-buys or promotional stunts á la “Beer with Bernie!” or whatever, but building a network of canvassers who go into neighborhoods and try to talk to people who have never voted before, or haven’t voted in 25 years or what have you. First time voters represent an enormous chunk of Bernie’s base. Couple that with the fact that another decently-sized chunk of Bernie’s supporters believe that this election is the last chance that we have of effecting actual change, and that he’s our ONLY chance of averting disaster. Not that Trump and all the other candidates are the same, but that the other Dem candidates don’t go far enough to be effective in averting apocalypse. 

So, you’ve got one sizable chunk of people who have entered the political process after years of total apathy because they’re so goddamn excited about this *one* candidate. If he’s out, why bother staying in? The whole reason the got so fired up in the first place is out of the race, might as well go home. Sure, *some* will stay, but I don’t think it’s a stretch to assume that a huge group of people who assemble to see one person at a venue will disperse and return home when they realize that that person won’t actually be at the venue. On TOP of that, you’ve got another sizable chunk who don’t believe that anybody other than Bernie can effectively avert disaster- if Bernie’s not in the race, what’s the point of voting for Biden? We’re all gonna end up just as dead as if Trump were still in office so why bother burning the calories to go to the voting booth? 

Whether or not one agrees with the actions of these groups is completely immaterial. What matters is that, from this perspective (which I believe to be a pretty decent one), Dems stand to lose the most votes by not nominating Bernie. Therefore, if *all* they care about is beating Trump, they *have* to nominate Bernie."
ENLIGHTENEDCENTRISM,ff1uwgk,t1_ff18ifc,1579486725.0,"In theory, no, authoritarianism is not exclusive to the right. But can you name one single even relatively popular leftist politician currently in office who is equally as authoritarian as the entirety of the conservative bloc in either Australia or the US?"
ENLIGHTENEDCENTRISM,ff1una8,t3_er18o4,1579486568.0,"Literally all these neolibs pretend to care about is beating Trump. They don’t consider that “One of the most important issues”; they say it is THE ONLY issue. Well, okay. Bernie Sanders has, by far, the largest number of people who will become completely uninterested with the process and just refuse to vote if he loses the nomination. They won’t go to Trump but they *will* stay home on Election Day, in margins far larger than Buttigeg, Biden, Warren, any of them. If getting Trump out of office is THE ONLY issue that these people care about then they HAVE to vote for Bernie. 

But, of course, getting Trump out isn’t the only issue. Because neolibs prefer fascism to socialism 99 times out of 100."
HistoryMemes,ff0wkf2,t3_eqxzze,1579472964.0,I love how insulting literally any other country in this sub inspires comments sections filled with memes and jokes but the second that one America-critical post makes it out of New and suddenly everyone in the comments section is all “Well if you think about it every single person in the world is inherently evil so critiquing anyone for anything is pointless.”
blursedimages,ff0uqrw,t1_ff0strd,1579472439.0,"The part of the body that receives the radiation doesn’t really matter all that much. Radiation affects DNA, and DNA is universal: the DNA that’s in your head is the same DNA that’s in your chest and it works the same way. 0.1 mSv of X-ray isn’t gonna cause any major damage whether it’s the head or the chest that receives the dose."
BlackPeopleTwitter,ff0sasv,t1_ff04oto,1579471809.0,"Ballet is seen by most of the older generation as being “effeminate” and there’s a cultural aversion towards male participation because it’ll either “turn the kid gay” or make people THINK that the kid is gay. Honestly I feel like a lot of this stems from a really really old conception of homosexuality as a behavior as opposed to an identity. Back in the old days, the thinking went “Oh Daniel here likes hunting, Jonathan likes chess, Robert likes men.” Because it was seen as a *behavior*, it was something that could be discouraged and subdued. Don’t like the kid being gay? Don’t let them engage in “gay behavior”. The identity will die in the absence of correlated activity. It’s dogshit reasoning that breaks down in the face of any scrutiny but it’s a very real mindset with a lot of Boomers."
blursedimages,ff0cuwe,t1_ff019sf,1579467657.0,"Eh, one chest X-ray won’t cause any seriously lasting damage. X-rays are ionizing radiation which can cause long-term damage and be lethal in high concentrations, but the scenario that would have had to happen in this photo wouldn’t cause a tumor right off the bat. A standard chest x-ray delivers about 0.1 mSv of radiation, which is about 10% of the maximum yearly standard public dose above background. The free radical formation, DNA-protein cross linkages, etc. caused by this exposure would probably be fixed by enzymes in the body like superoxide dismutase with no negative downstream effects; however, radiation is scary, and should be avoided just in case. Doing this is definitely stupid but it’s not a one-way trip to tumor town unless you’re doing it like weekly."
AskReddit,ff05kvm,t1_feyjkzv,1579465415.0,"Eh, depends on the market. My parents purchased their home in 2003 for $285k. It obviously tanked after ‘08 and ruined their plans to move, but they put another $250k into renovations a couple years back and recently got it appraised for $1.2m. Real estate is weird and 2008 proved that you can’t rely on it as a stable investment, but I think that barring nation-wide recession there will always be markets where it’s possible to make money on it."
Games,fezy0ah,t1_fezul7e,1579463131.0,"I see what you’re saying, and it’s an interesting question: “Can a game make you feel guilty for something that it forced you to do?” I think that yes, it can. It wasn’t just making you feel guilty for playing the game the way it forced you to play; it was making you feel guilty for playing military shooters at all. That was the overarching point: when you play a military shooter, you are the bad guy. You’re coming into a place you don’t understand based on orders that don’t tell the whole truth pursuing an end that doesn’t actually benefit anyone, all while innocent civilians get killed in the process. The only way to “be a good guy” while playing those games is by turning off the console and walking away, which was a crazy deep message to send packaged in a AAA military shooter at the height of the Call of Duty era. The game took a seriously dark turn afterwords- the gameplay didn’t change, true, but the whole atmosphere got steadily more and more oppressive, until you’re essentially just fighting through hell in the last level. Walker’s mind unraveled and his descent into madness was mirrored in tiny details in the gameplay- reload animations became longer and Walker got more vocally frustrated when he fucked up, his kill announcements became more animalistic until they were just incoherent screams, and the kill animations became almost disgusting. 

The game fucks with you with the White Phosphorus scene, because it didn’t actually give you a choice. The game wouldn’t advance if you didn’t pull the trigger. But the point is that the first time through, in 2012, *no one thought about it*. And the game punished you for it. But when there is a choice later in the game (slaughter the civilians in the gorge or just shoot over their heads to disperse them), it’s only after loading you down with so much misery and anger and confusion and thrusting the choice upon you in a split-second, high-stress situation that a *huge* number of players took the slaughter option. It’s not presented as an option per se- the only way you’d think it *was* an option is if you had either played the game before, or were thinking clearly enough to know that you had a choice (remember that refrain that Lugo said throughout the game: “There’s *always* a choice”), which would have required amazing mental fortitude considering how unrelentingly fucked up the preceding few hours of gameplay had been. 

No Russian was a “drop in, be a bad guy, drop out consequence free” level that was put in for shock value and nothing else. Spec Ops was a chronicle of one man’s descent into madness, and the player’s exhaustion at experiencing it. Honestly I think one’s enjoyment of the experience is predicated on that person’s opinion of metatextuality, because that’s really all that game is."
Games,fezmf6k,t1_fezfql8,1579458982.0,"It was really only all that groundbreaking when it first game out. That game fucked with the meta SUPER hard and deserved the praise it got for doing so. 2012 was the era of thoughtless, jingoist, Michael Bay-ified shoot-em-ups. The amount of “oh I’m in a plane, time for the overhead turret section” moments in games at that time was obscenely high. When you played Spec Ops for the first time at launch, you didn’t even think about it because of how inundated the market was with scenes like that. The idea that you were doing something “wrong” just didn’t cross your mind because it was never something you had to think about. 

And then the game makes you think about it. Shoves the horror in your face and says “Look at what you did you fucking monster.” There’s no way to avoid it in the game so if you look at it purely from the lens of that one game it can come off as a bit cheap, but if you look at it as an indictment of the industry as a whole at the time (which Spec Ops most definitely was) it becomes far more powerful. Playing the game now doesn’t have the same impact because of how much the industry has changed story-wise in the last eight years. But fucking hell was it powerful back in the day."
