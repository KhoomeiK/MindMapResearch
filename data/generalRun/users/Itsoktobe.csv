My thinking is, if we take out a 30-year loan which allows overpayment/being paid off early, our mortgage payment (not including tax, PMI, home ins) would be less than we're currently paying for rent (so easily covered), and we could make extra payments whenever possible to gain equity more quickly.

This is an absurd view that I would encourage you to delve further into. You don't deserve to have an unsatisfying sex life due to his insecurities about his sexual performance. He's not a woman, and he may not understand what it is about sex toys that we enjoy. But he still has an obligation to you, as your sexual partner, to care about your pleasure. If he truly wants to ""do a good job,"" he should be willing to use *all* tools at his disposal. If he's lying about that, and doesn't want to engage with the sex toys, fine. But he doesn't have the right to ban them from your bedroom. This is clearly a deeper issue related to his feelings of inadequacy, and I understand wanting to be understanding toward that. But all you're really doing by going along with him is encouraging this idea that when he feels insecure, he's allowed to control you. Not a good place to be."

I'm sorry you were subjected to that. If it makes you feel any better, it's not actually a heartbeat at this point. Forcing or ""encouraging"" a woman to listen to a embryo's ""heartbeat"" is nothing more than an anti-choice guilt tactic, if you ask me. 

Here's an excerpt from an article explaining what I mean: 


But what exactly do we mean when we talk about a ""fetal heartbeat"" at six weeks of pregnancy? Although some people might picture a heart-shaped organ beating inside a fetus, this is not the case.

Rather, at six weeks of pregnancy, an ultrasound can detect ""a little flutter in the area that will become the future heart of the baby,"" said Dr. Saima Aftab, medical director of the Fetal Care Center at Nicklaus Children's Hospital in Miami. This flutter happens because the group of cells that will become the future ""pacemaker"" of the heart gain the capacity to fire electrical signals, she said. [Are You Pregnant? 12 Early Signs of Pregnancy]

But the heart is far from fully formed at this stage, and the ""beat"" isn't audible; if doctors put a stethoscope up to a woman's belly this early on in her pregnancy, they would not hear a heartbeat, Aftab told Live Science. (What's more, it isn't until the eighth week of pregnancy that the baby is called a fetus; prior to that, it's still considered an embryo, according to the Cleveland Clinic.)

That's not true, and a good example of why it's a bad comparison to draw. You don't just walk into a doctor's office and ""pick out"" whatever services you want, then get them.

For a government to do so? Yes. I think you're arguing my point.. the gov't provides poor people with food stamps, which are directly transferable for food items. This program is paid for with taxes that virtually everyone contributes to. A single-payer health plan would be paid for in the same way, yet would benefit everyone. Poor people may benefit the most, as they are the most chronically un- and under-insured demographic, but everyone would enjoy cheaper prescriptions and free or affordable care. 


Perhaps a better comparison to draw is with education. Public schools are paid for by a combination of local, state, and federal taxes. Every child is guaranteed an education at one of these schools. If your family is especially wealthy, you may go to a private school, where you might receive a higher quality education. Similarly, under Medicare for all, everyone will receive healthcare. The wealthy who choose to do so will most likely still be able to purchase more comprehensive insurance plans, but the private insurers will no longer hold the bulk of the bargaining power.
