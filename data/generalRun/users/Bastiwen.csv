When I was a kid the pediatrician I went to was an incredibly kind woman. Also when I go to the doctor and see kids there, usually the assistants and the doctor are nice to them.

There are a few bad apples but also a lot of nice doctors, you should try to switch."

AskReddit,fevbidk,t3_eqies2,1579395405.0,"This happened to me a lot while at school. Sometlmes without even being tired I would close my eyes without even noticing. I wouldn't notice because it was just as if my eyes were opened, I could hear everything and see what was happening. I would only notice after a few seconds and open my eyes again. It was like I instantly fell asleep and started dreaming what was happening in class."
LivestreamFail,fesszya,t1_fesn2tp,1579368725.0,"Yeah I know, I'm not criticizing that, I'm just saying that it often sounds (to me) more believable in the original version. To me Goku is a childish, sweet and innocent young adult so his japanese high pitched voice matches perfectly to me, and it's not even the first version of his voice I heard, the first one was the French version which is also a deeper voice like the english version. They are good voice actors, I'm just more used to the original voice and I think it suits the character a bit better."

Here are the names in French :

Couvre-tête de ravageur,   
Veste subversive,   
Garde-poignets d'Exar Kun,  
Gants de Satele Shan,   
Ceinture d'explorateur des badlands,  
Pantalon d'observateur étranger,   
Crampons de ver de chair (extérieur),   
Sabre laser de technographe insoumis

and here is a rough translation of every item :

Juggernaut head piece,   
Subversive jacket,   
Exar Kun's wrist guard,   
Satele Shan's gloves,   
Badlands explorer's belt,   
Foreign observer's pants,   
Fleshworm crampon (exterior),   
Unruly technographe's lightsaber

Hope that helps a bit, the jacket is actually cheaper if you buy the whole set it's from than the jacket alone. The most expensive item was the black + black paint which cost me 50mio credits (I am now nearly ruined but it was worth it :P)

Chinese tourists run, they don't care about lines, shout, are disrespectful, touch everything and takes photos even when they are told not to. On the other hand, Japanese tourists are well mannered, calm, respectful, curious but in a good way, and really nice. 

One time I was in the city of Bern and a group of Japanese tourists asked me if I could take their picture, they were so nice about it so I gladly did it. Another time it was Chinese tourists who asked me, they kinda jumped on me, gave me the camera and told me ""you take photo"", no ""please"", nothing."
