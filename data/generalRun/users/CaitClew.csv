I would burst into tears when engaging in certain sex acts that were triggering but having a loving partner whom I trusted really helped me get over it. I actually enjoy some stuff I never thought I would be able to stomach. Be patient and know that your love can help heal some of that pain. Best of luck!"

AskReddit,fekzye6,t3_epj100,1579211110.0,It’s an oldie but Spongebob: Battle for Bikini Bottom on the Ps2 is actually so fun! There are tough spots that I still really struggle with in my twenties. I don’t think it gets enough credit.

When I talk shit about them it’s funny, if someone outside of the family does it, it instantly makes me defensive and irritated. I will make fun of Bakersfield but when someone from LA does it, I get defensive. It’s silly but true."
