You think people get free healthcare so they can get rich? Think again. Not thinking is just typical republican behaviour. How do you 'em labels now?"
facepalm,felhyit,t1_felcrfa,1579222605.0,"Let's take it to the extreme.

Lets say everybody dont have to pay taxes, just give donations with the same amount as their taxes, but they get to choose what/who to donate to.

This will be bad, no?"
facepalm,feldcdl,t3_epnlj6,1579219514.0,"People just debating about the terms and definition of socialism. Basically under the current system we already have some form of it, distribution of wealth.

You pay taxes and the government distribute it (spend it) .

However people don't like when the government spend it on something they don't agree or even don't themselves. This is true on both sides.

Some don't like food stamp for the poor. Because they are lazy people. Some don't like spending on military because why gives money to military contractor and promotes war. Some don't like tax cuts for the rich because they don't need it.

Some think government is incapable of spending money efficiently. Some think private sector is too greedy."

That's not a great idea either."
