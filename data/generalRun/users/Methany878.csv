Generally, the fact that this effect is unique on Flash, at least given the cost involved, is the problem. Unfortunately, there are quite a few cards on the banlist that could be used fairly, but are still banned. [[Tinker]], for example, could be a lot of fun, yet (imo) totally deserves to be on the list.

I'm sorry if this one ends up impacting you. I've been hit by the ban hammer a few times and it's not fun :(

Honestly, for me, the worst part is that they ban some of those cards and leave others in. At this point, I'm afraid of acquiring any new cards because you never know how long it'll even be in the format. Given that, some cards on that list are just baffling..."

If this ever changes, great, but it definitely won't have been the guy's book tours or blog posts or short stories or whatever else he's been doing in the meantime that lead me to buy part three.

It's probably obvious from my replies that I'm a guy. I have some (not so) mild issues with physical contact, except with less than a handful of people.

When I was in highschool (middle school in the US, I'd guess), there was a phase when I was constantly being hugged, slapped on the backside, etc by girls. Guess it was the age combined with my reactions, but I wasn't just being an awkward teenager (though that probably didn't help). Establishing boundaries took a long time and a lot of strength, and at least I was usually in a safe environment and knew those people, at least vaguely.
