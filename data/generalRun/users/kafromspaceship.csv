I'll die someday, and everything that I cared will be pointless as soon as I cease to breath. So I have to live in the present."

In seriousness now, those people aren't idiots. They just want to belong to a movement that makes them looks smarter than scientists. I don't think we will win. We failed with them when we treated them like low iq people (same as the flat earth). Now they will grab their believes as most do with religion. In reality, I don't know what to do. But calling them idiots won't work. Mostly, because they don't it out of   evilness. They do believe they are doing the correct thing. Like we do."
Stress,fdqt055,t3_emrf3k,1578674238.0,"It's easy to tell you to stand for yourself when I'm not on your shoes. I would advise you not to care much. Like, the cat is completely normal, treat it as normal. The weird one is your mother. She is the one that makes you feel unconfortable in your own house. If she asks about the cat, don't give too much information. If you feel like telling that it's yours, tell her, otherwise, say you are watching it for a friend. Abusive mothers really makes we kind of freak out."
EDAnonymous,fdpm37k,t3_emjdkb,1578632472.0,"It's ok to be jealous. ED is a mental health, we can't control it using motivation alone. There's no motivation in the world that would make you or anyone with this condition control it, or we would already be out of problems, right? So, it's ok. But see, it's not your fault having ED. You can have some responsibility over it, but never guilt. We live in a world that obsess over thin bodies, so much that people die trying to achieve this ideal. At the same time, we are wired, as humans, to crave for fat and sugar. There are some people who crave it less (the lucky bastards), but overall, we crave it. To make things worse, it's easier and in some places cheaper to get unhealthy food full of sugar and fat than healthy foods. It's the disaster combo. So, no, you are not a piggy, you are a human being whose brain go in ""I have to store all this sugar"". You don't need to punish yourself even more, doing fasts that harms your body. You already punish your mind. I think that you must know everything already. 
If it's possible, look for help. Therapy helped me a lot with compulsive eating. But don't try to use the fasts to harm you. Actually, it's a good way to help you when you get better from the ED. Food (even the unhealthy one, in moderation) is not enemy, it's friend. And life is much more than our weight. I really like the r/antidiet and the r/EatingIntuively when I'm feeling bad about myself and my weight.
I hope you get better!"

demons,fdasxak,t3_ekgu3w,1578249696.0,"Oh satan. First you should stop spamming all the occult e non occult subs with the same question. Second: it can't be done through magick. Magick is the art to improve probabilities. You can do magick to help you transition better, to make your family understand, but not to become a girl. For that you need counseling, doctors who will prescribe hormones and maybe, if you feel that you need to, a surgery. Right now you need to find a therapist to help you to start transitioning. Don't believe anyone who says otherwise. They'll fool you."

ADHD,fcznrhh,t3_ejp4sp,1578105264.0,"My current psychology doesn't agree with the ADHD diagnosis (even though my psychiatrist thinks I have it). It was a sensible issue for me. While I can live without meds, my daily life greatly improved after medication. I came to a conclusion that even if she is right, that I don't have ADHD, I still have a lot of symptoms that are similar. It can be due to depression, anxiety, fibromyalgia and trauma, but I am improving using ADHD medication and tips that I found everywhere. I must have a problem with dopamine. Either way, I don't care anymore about it. I hope I can get better enough to not need meds anymore, and become neuro typical."
