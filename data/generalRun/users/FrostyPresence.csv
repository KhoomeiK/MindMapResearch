Really as long as your a good person and do even the smallest acts of kindness and compassion and enjoy just today. You will find happiness. It's from within. Not from things.

Depressed. Getting hopeless.Motrin and Tylenol everyday, heat/ ice. Permanent contracture. Went to PT X3/ wk for 3 months. Screaming in agony in the beginning. Pulled and twisted on me. Bike, weights, floor exercises etc. Did the home exercises 2X a day faithfully. Got stronger each week. Got discharged in 3 months. When I started I was walking a 45 minute mile and it kicked my ass. Fast forward I am pain and medication free. A rare day now  I'm reminded with some stiffness, but it's gone by the next day. I walk 2 -3 miles after work daily or 10k bike and weights at the gym. I walk a 19 minute mile now and hike 4 miles on the weekends. I still have some limited ROM with my stride and flexibility. But I'm definitely ok with it. PT saved my life!! There is no quick fix.

stopdrinking,fcazioc,t3_egutsv,1577579698.0,"Mine as well when my husband killed himself in May. Not drowning my grief allowed me to grieve healthy. I have a tremendous amount of gratitude for everything in my life. The smallest or most obvious. I did not want my children to follow his legacy, so it was important to be a strong role model . I doubled down on healthy habits. I was already exercising daily, eating well. I began meditating everyday which has changed my brain. Highly recommend!! I have joined a bunch of Meetup groups and do a lot of activities, mostly outdoor, hiking, festivals etc. I was pretty antisocial prior. I have made good friends and reconnected with the others I let slide. I started hobbies. I have never been so peaceful and together in my life. I  know I wouldn't be at this point with alcohol. Every weekend is like a mini vacation."
stopdrinking,fcaw0be,t3_egndfq,1577577711.0,Alcohol would not make anything better. Good for you! Stay sober and stay focused!! You got this!! A new opportunity awaits you. Stay positive🙋💕✌

SuicideBereavement,fc2ugm1,t3_efqo7g,1577374367.0,"You're also shifting the blame/ responsibility to yourself, when I really is the person's. In the end they took their life. Same exact thing I feel with my husband. But really, he could have done it many other times and if not the last time, he would've done it another. We really can't stop someone. We don't need to take the blame either. They chose this. We shouldn't make ourselves feel guilty for something we didn't do. There are no answers. In the end, we just have to learn and grow."
SuicideBereavement,fc2u104,t1_fc2523w,1577374020.0,Exactly this.

Frugal,fc0ldgo,t1_fc0kwr4,1577293680.0,👌Okie dokie.
Frugal,fc0kmtx,t1_fc0kdf5,1577293080.0,Your missing the entire point. Not going to explain it a third time. ✌
Frugal,fc0je3n,t1_fc0iwrw,1577292144.0,Of course you wouldn't. Try to enjoy your day anyway.

Frugal,fc0by17,t3_efebp0,1577286361.0,It's kinda sad people can't even enjoy the day without having to scheme what or how to save. Next time try keeping some Christmas spirit. It's free and good for your soul. Not even my holiday lol.
Wellthatsucks,fc0bs0l,t3_efc7mp,1577286206.0,Just donated. Lost my husband to suicide in May. Not formally diagnosed but highly likely. Merry Christmas!
Frugal,fc0ao9r,t3_efebp0,1577285161.0,With the Dollar store these days we really don't have to jump through hoops to save like we use to. Don't make yourself crazy over a quarter. Life is short. Be frugal but live it.
Frugal,fc0agmr,t1_fc07h0q,1577284951.0,Not anymore
