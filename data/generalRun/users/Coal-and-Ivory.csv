 It had something of a psychological effect on me. Stuff I used to take for granted felt kind of hollow and fake with the sensory disconnect, especially where contact with my partner was concerned. Our sense of touch is more central to the human experience that I ever realized. It took effort on my part to move past it, getting over the depression about it, learning to use other parts of my hand to feel things.

I remember being able to sympathize with a mercenary character from Deus Ex who mentions his military hand prosthetics don't have feeling, and his frustration with that made returning to civilian life hard and hurt his marriage."
occult,ffebokr,t1_ffe8kd5,1579842328.0,"It's not uncommon for old school curses to have a way of turning them built in. Usually it's with anything directional, think ""Evil eye"" adjacent. Usually you can reflect the curse in question back on the caster by saying their name and turning the fetish or charm toward their home. Magick loves it's ironic consequences. 

That's a very interesting question. I do agree, deciding to embrace magick makes you a beacon of sorts for things, spirits, creatures, and other magick. I'm not wholly sold on the ""we give curses their power over us"" idea, but if I knew everything about magick I wouldn't need to work my day job now would I. Magick can be a science if you let it, so let's hypothesize.

 Maybe ""set and forget"" curses like this one are like magical autoimmune diseases. You're ""infected"" with the belief that you're cursed, and your own magical intent, now corrupted against you, begins harming you, but it's hard to ""choose"" not to believe, so we have to turn to ritual to lift the curse. I suppose with practice you could learn to ignore that line of thinking, shrug off more trivial things. Might account for differing sensitivity too, a casual believer might see a run of bad luck, meanwhile a deep practitioner might well become physically ill. Let's not pretend the venn diagrams for magick users and intrusive anxiety sufferers don't overlap pretty far.

Meanwhile a non-magickal person (well, non-practicing person, everyone is at least a little magic) might require the caster actively maintain the curse, or seek the help of an entity to maintain it for them, or harm the target directly. They don't have magical intent to corrupt. Susceptibility to curses might be the price we pay for choosing this life.

That said, there is certainly a case for curses which take effect before the source is found, plenty of folk turn up on these subs looking for an explanation for weird happenings before they remember or find the source. But if theres anything else magick loves to do, its contradict itself.

A fundamental rule of magick, at least as I know it, its that there are no rules, if it makes sense, it might be magick, if it doesnt make sense, its definitely magick."
occult,ff9gwl5,t1_ff8abrt,1579712763.0,"How very green of you. I like it, but thats tough to do. Malicious intent leaves a certain taint on the components. You can, with a lot of effort sanitize the ""bad juju"" off of them but that's a lot of work to put in, especially with perishable things like animal parts, and if the chicken was killed specifically for the curse, meaning killed with cruel intent, you'd have an easier time chewing stones.

 Plus theres no guarantee it will solve OPs problem. A blessing and a curse both involving chicken feet arnt necessarily equal and opposite. If I were OP I would take them far from the property and bury them with herbs and fireplace ash. If bad things still begin happening, get the place blessed by whatever sort of priest is available."
occult,ff883ep,t3_es6kb9,1579668721.0,"It's hard to say without knowing where they came from. Chicken feet placed by you are a protective charm to defend your property or home, could be put up as protection by the previous owner. However, placed on another's property by someone else it's usually a curse, especially in the Southern USA. Someone may not be pleased to see you move in."

SWORDS,fehscvc,t3_engmob,1579122914.0,"Late to the party here, but I believe it's bad luck to put trust in anything without a name. A few are still waiting to earn or inspire names, but here's the current named cast in my armory.

My knives are ""Grizzly"" ( a trusty three generation hand-me-down Buck knife), ""Springheel"" (OTF knife, he's spring assisted), and ""Wander"", a big ol' Bowie who goes with me when I hike, IE. wander.

My throwing axes are ""Jack"" and ""Ripper"".  ""Jack"" is a nicely balanced carpenters hatchet, flies true and is pretty handy outside of the axe range too, a jack-of-all-trades. ""Ripper"" flies like a brick and hits the target like a... brick. Basically a sharpened sledgehammer on a hatchet handle, unwieldy and excessive, but fun.

Barring a dragon attack, I don't need to trust my swords but they get names nonetheless. For that mythical feel, and because it makes me attached to them so I don't get careless and let them rust.

The sole katana allowed in my collection is named in honor of my late cousin who passed it on to me.

My long dagger is named ""Gladiolus"", after an awesome flower-like pattern that just happened to emerge in the blade. Plus the sword pun.

Finally my beloved longsword is named ""Kivihiili"", which is Finnish for Coal. Theres a lot of personal reasons for that name. But it also has carbon stains on the grip, I was too excited to handle it, forgot to wash my hands after work. Gives her character.

The actual story was much more specific, with proper military ranks and locations. But I cant remember most of that, sorry. Anyway...

Apparently a story was going around that some newer recruit was working night watch at the checkpoint going into a remote base one night. Nobody around for miles. Suddenly, a man in an officer's uniform walked up to the gate out of nowhere and asked to be let in. Naturally the watchman thinks this is weird, since it's a really long walk from anywhere to this base, much less at night.

But the watchman radios in the name the officer gave him, like hes supposed to, and waits for confirmation that he can be allowed into the base. The whole time the officer is staring at him through the window, asking again and again to be let in, like he has urgent business to take care of on base.

Suddenly the watchman's commanding officer comes on the radio and just says ""GET THE FUCK OUT OF THERE! NOW!"" Literally telling him to abandon his post and get back to base immediately. He turns around and the man in the officer's uniform gives him a crazed look, turns, and sprints off into the dark.

Upon driving back to base, the recruit is told to turn in, and never mention this again. Naturally he immediately started asking around, (wouldn't you?) and most of the folks who had been there longer told him three things. That he should be asking about it, that the officer who had allegedly walked up to the checkpoint was dead and had been for months, and the single word: Skinwalker."
