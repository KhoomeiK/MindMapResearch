Music,ffay051,t3_esmcwa,1579747108.0,They are one of my personal faves. I recommend doing the timeline dive and listening to their stuff from beginning to end. If you already know the storylines of the band then it's pretty wild to ride along. Plus each album is a whole new experiment for them. Have fun and enjoy!
Fallout,ff9vle8,t3_esejsa,1579722461.0,"Every single time these posts pop up I ask: why do you care? Someone wants to talk, is excited, or just wants to connect. 

Maybe it's you who needs a break from the sub. Come back in a month, everything will seem fresh."

Drugs,ff85bx3,t1_ff852o5,1579666411.0,"being young and testing your limits are a part of life. but be honest with yourself on this one and understand 5 was too much. one of the first things you should learn about taking drugs is that it's about the ride, it's not about ""how much can i do!!"". once you understand that, things will be a helluva lot more fun."
Drugs,ff84waz,t1_ff84iym,1579666071.0,"first of all, you took fucking 5. second, it's a prescription. scripts are set up so you take one every few hours. third, please don't be so reckless next time. finally, you'll be fine, it does sound like psychosis, just mild. your brain will reset and relax. if it doesn't by the weekend, you may want to see a doc asap."

nitrous,fdmemxr,t3_em4sv6,1578547390.0,"Those hold 2 perfectly fine. They are designed for 1 and the cream mixture, so you're fine. The smaller pint size ones will break a seal if you try to put 2 in. 

If you're going for ultimate high, you should either use a balloon or take a few deep breaths in succession, quickly but don't hyperventilate. Then, exhale it all and load up the nos. Hold it in as long as you can and exhale as slowly as you can, no need to inhale here as you'll just be adding oxygen and diluting what you already have in your lungs. Sit back and relax.

Personally, I like to do 10-20 in a row to get beyond the wah wah's and into the super giggles and higher mental plane."
