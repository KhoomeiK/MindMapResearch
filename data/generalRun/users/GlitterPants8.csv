fatlogic,ffdas1a,t3_et03by,1579816835.0, I mean the other day my kid woke up before me and ate leftover birthday cake. Then complained about not feeling well. I explained that eating cake for breakfast was going to do that. That's why I don't let them eat that stuff in the morning. Life lesson. But letting them do it regularly would be an issue.
fatlogic,ffcst9m,t1_ffc01la,1579806538.0,Ugh. I start to get unmotivated and low key depressed when I skip to long. Sometimes I have to because I have kids and they get sick and it just sucks.
fatlogic,ffclqdp,t1_ffc58iw,1579802136.0,So clearly you stocked up on wine and got on the internet! It's the only logical thing to do.
fatlogic,ffam6hp,t3_eskcqk,1579739206.0,"I mean I was an exchange student when I was 18 and I sat in the aisle during the long flight overseas. So it's not totally unrealistic. 

People on Bart are not always the nicest people, its public transportation. You can't take a single example and apply it to everyone."
houseplants,ff9w3ye,t3_esfvpo,1579722792.0,Lovely. Now if only I could stop killing mine. Lol
fatlogic,ff75xl0,t1_ff6pbct,1579641766.0,Sounds a bit like when my blood sugar crashes. Maybe a small snack after swimming? I don't normally suggest snacks but it might help.
fatlogic,ff75f22,t3_eryxo6,1579641475.0,"I mean I partly use the sauna regularly due to some of the research on heatshock protein, but it also  feels nice. Win-win for me."
fatlogic,ff6edfp,t3_erw5oj,1579625370.0,This is the weirdest thing I've read on the internet lately.
fatlogic,ff4ulu8,t3_ermqnt,1579572819.0,"I'm going to agree that it is easier to look nice when you are thinner. I can wear a pretty shapeless dress and look nice where as when I was obese I'd just like I put zero effort in and I was wearing a mumu.
I don't think my interactions with people are very different though."
fatlogic,ff4u5rf,t1_ff4nxgs,1579572519.0,That depends on how big you are to start with. You couldn't even tell for the first 30lbs that I lost weight and most of my clothes fit about the same too.
fatlogic,ff417om,t1_ff3tbdb,1579553321.0,Well that's true. I'm probably a solid 6 but I have to buy 2-4 in most brands.
fatlogic,ff3ybog,t3_ere8ar,1579551516.0,"I'm not sure if this is supposed to be inspirational or make you feel like shit. Lol
You are just a speck. Thanks I feel better now."
fatlogic,ff3q5nd,t1_ff3jyux,1579546459.0,I can occasionally find xs but the small and medium are usually sold out. The xl+ are the ones left over here. I live in a lower obesity state though so that might be a reason.
fatlogic,feznztc,t1_fezdma6,1579459513.0,Oh I hate that. When I'm really far away and they make eye contact letting you know they are waiting for you. So you feel the urge to walk much faster than you would normally. Guys do it all the time. Just go in dude.
fatlogic,fezn5jt,t1_fezi1m7,1579459232.0,I found the xl and xs were the ones that always went on clearance. Especially at the stores I like. Now I'm an in between size and have to spend more because they just sell out instead of going on clearance.
fatlogic,fez1f4s,t1_feyotau,1579453029.0,Yea. The watermelon needs is own container. Soggy pizza is not cool.
fatlogic,fez0qjl,t1_feyrqrj,1579452840.0,The ultimate meta game!
fatlogic,feviqd0,t1_feuez4i,1579397882.0,Ugh. I feel you on the sports bra.
fatlogic,fesi4yw,t1_fescgwl,1579365364.0,"Maybe he wanted to go to a sauna and there aren't any in your area?
My gym has a sauna and a steam room and it's mostly the old dudes that use them."
fatlogic,fesesbm,t1_feru3s4,1579364455.0,I feel called out by my lack of ability to do pull ups right now.
fatlogic,feo65rd,t1_fenyojv,1579295640.0,"Did we have the same teacher?!

 It was my thin older philosophy teacher that wore the same clothes. But yes he was thin so he doesn't count."
fatlogic,fenwmza,t1_fenu1t8,1579291970.0,"Yea. I've only noticed 2 teachers. One was abnormally short. Being 5'2"" myself means it was noticeable. The other wore the exact same clothes every day. Literally every day. I'm still not sure if they were washed really often or if he had multiples of the exact same clothes. Neither of those things made me question their credibility."
knitting,fen8qft,t3_eq1lpx,1579279428.0,It's beautiful
fatlogic,fekcdos,t1_fejzl99,1579197105.0,I'm sure that's true. They just state it as if their reality is the only true one.
fatlogic,fejz1cz,t3_epk1xh,1579189074.0,I don't know. When I was a kid my friend had a huge bag of cheeto type snacks. We ate until we felt sick. I had no desire to have cheetos after that. I still don't like then really 30 years later.
fatlogic,feh1nfy,t1_fegye3z,1579107274.0,Anything is better than nothing.
fatlogic,fegzn8b,t1_fefruw6,1579106057.0,I imagine it might be worse honestly. So many things have hidden gluten where as you can usually tell if it's got dairy.
fatlogic,fegyv7j,t1_fegv6v5,1579105580.0,Pictures pop up occasionally. They get deleted pretty fast though. It's easy for people to start picking apart the pictures and usually that brings more negative comments.
fatlogic,fedqesn,t1_feddf46,1579017641.0,Hey now! I like to cook my children the same way I cook my brussel sprouts. With bacon and maple syrup. They are crispy on the outside but creamy on the inside. But your way does sound delicious.
fatlogic,fedpveq,t3_eomg76,1579017306.0,My scale apparently has had a low battery and after I changed it I have actually gained 3 lbs. Oops. I thought I was doing pretty well too. It's not the end of the world but I have had a lot of chips lately and a lack of vegetables.
plantclinic,fe9e8wo,t3_eo6kah,1578936783.0,Begonias like humidity. Do you have a humifier? It also looks dry.
fatlogic,fe9d6pq,t1_fe7afps,1578936501.0,Not being able to easily eat dairy is a blessing and a curse. It really limits a lot of food but it also sadly limits delicious food.
fatlogic,fe3vjof,t1_fe3ep8k,1578853231.0," I had the same breakfast as you! 
I don't have a plan but I'll probably not be very hungry later anyway."
fatlogic,fe3uu0u,t1_fe3etz1,1578853116.0,Yea but Free Solo was really good. Everyone should totally be able to do it.
fatlogic,fe3tyjp,t3_enq1vf,1578852842.0,Type 1 diabetes is not what people are talking about when they say you are more likely to develop diabetes. You'd think that person would understand that.
fatlogic,fe3toyp,t3_enqqdd,1578852744.0,This is one of those things I'd read. Make a face and scroll by. There is no reasonable answer to her except that she is right.
fatlogic,fdx75jj,t1_fdwiatn,1578765969.0,Rabbits are greedy bastards. I had to keep mine out of the garbage and they beg constantly.
fatlogic,fdt35qn,t1_fdt13bs,1578711311.0,I got a new one that can go in water for this reason. Lol
fatlogic,fdseuoo,t1_fdsd9nw,1578701107.0,Lol. I have a scale that syncs my weight to my phone so I don't even have to look at it while I'm barley awake and without my glasses.
fatlogic,fdrkvgc,t1_fdrgvza,1578685930.0,Mine too! I prefer them roasted myself. They get nice and crispy.
fatlogic,fdrfant,t1_fdr3ohe,1578683676.0,I'd check the battery or get a better scale.
fatlogic,fdrcvd4,t3_emu81g,1578682647.0,Can confirm. Tapeworms are my secret to being thin.
fatlogic,fdrc59w,t1_fdr9h2u,1578682432.0,Lol. Yes not to many of us in the US. But generally the ones who are are super into it. I'm crazy excited about the mini feature coming out this year.
fatlogic,fdr2w78,t1_fdo2z0j,1578678793.0,Yes. If you were a true dwarfer you'd not have to ask.
fatlogic,fdqy60p,t3_emta6s,1578676585.0,Umm no. My kids want cookies because they are delicious and filled with sugar. It has nothing to do with love or acceptance.
houseplants,fdqxze1,t3_emsrlu,1578676474.0,Yay!
fatlogic,fdmaciu,t1_fdm7kka,1578543814.0,What a smeghead
fatlogic,fdlogrm,t3_em00tr,1578528694.0,I can barely get out half the time. My kids often just want to throw the door open and get out. I park in back for a reason. They could also park in back where there are less cars and more room.
fatlogic,fdlnngq,t1_fdljbdk,1578528138.0,I'm sure they asked about it on purpose. Sensationalism is what gets clicks.
fatlogic,fdhraax,t1_fdhfwon,1578428628.0,Right? I checked my kids scooter before I tried it. I'm 120 lbs but you never know with things.
fatlogic,fdedjfk,t1_fde2v9y,1578336670.0,Well yea. Losing weight isn't going to fix any real problems. It's only going to make little differences that make it easier. I use to feel like a slug and now I feel bouncy. My life is basically the same but it seems a little easier to deal.
fatlogic,fdecnm1,t1_fde8u1j,1578336119.0,Oof. You're right. I shall submit myself to the next willing male to treat me of my hysteria.
fatlogic,fde2atw,t1_fde0lin,1578329580.0,I've been maintaining for about 6 months and I'm not really doing much beyond not falling into terrible habits again. It took me like 1.5yrs to lose weight so my habits are pretty good habits now.
fatlogic,fde1v4k,t3_ekwkpi,1578329298.0,It's strange. Before losing weight walking to the park with my kids was tiring. Now I can jog behind them as they ride their bikes. But my life totally isn't easier!
fatlogic,fdckqyb,t3_ekn7m2,1578277336.0,"That's weird. I thought I was there to help my adhd, anxiety and prevent osteoporosis. But I guess not. I'm only there for others to ogle my goodies."
fatlogic,fdckaty,t1_fdbu0d5,1578277016.0,I don't know. I think it's just really small. There's a nub.
fatlogic,fdcjbdm,t1_fdc6ni2,1578276310.0,You go to a very different gym then I do. People chat but they are there to workout mostly.
fatlogic,fcyj86j,t1_fcyfsua,1578080988.0,"I'm avoiding the gym. Even in the last few weeks it's been extra busy. I go in the morning so less people are then in general, so I don't even want to see it at night."
fatlogic,fcyitk8,t1_fcy5270,1578080761.0,You'd think they'd want us fat for when they consume us. But perhaps their jaws can't dislocate that big.
fatlogic,fcyej84,t3_ejjy31,1578078947.0,Your mine is your body. So yes.
fatlogic,fcw5ojn,t3_ej7nq4,1578017742.0,My intent with IF was to lose weight. Full stop.
SavageGarden,fcvo8bp,t1_fcvkrfc,1578006372.0,Yes. Just water. I have to mist mine to make it pitcher as well.
fatlogic,fcr9rx8,t1_fcqs49z,1577898841.0,Nope. Once you lose the weight you basically get amnesia about what it's like to be fat. Your inner boss babe goddess literally dies of starvation.
fatlogic,fcpfoja,t1_fcosmnw,1577861924.0,I'm pretty sure 3 is 2 to them. There is no 3.
fatlogic,fcolhu3,t3_eia9xq,1577835234.0,"I mean yea, today I started to feel sick and it was my bodies way of telling me that I was hungry, so I ate.
But thinking about what I'm going to eat later so I can plan is not the same. Sometimes you need to defrost things or go to the store ok?"
fatlogic,fcok0yb,t1_fcob0it,1577834174.0,"I wonder where people come up with this stuff. I was told I got 'to thin' when I was 125lbs at 5'2"". I wear a size 6 pants still. I'm not going to disappear anytime soon. Lol"
fatlogic,fcojq81,t1_fcodgzt,1577833954.0,Nah. They go stale. Especially cookies. I have cookies I need to toss because they don't taste good anymore because I didn't eat them fast enough. It's ok though because I ate my favorites first so I don't really care about what's been uneaten.
fatlogic,fcnox3b,t1_fcnh21g,1577815647.0,"Yea. I agree. I didn't really learn through reddit it was a slow information intake from research while slowly changing habits. Fasting really helped reset my hunger cues though. I lost them from taking medication in my 20s and leaning to just eat when other people were.
I considered WW but decided I was too cheap. Lol I'm glad I didn't because I bet I would have failed."
fatlogic,fckk57h,t1_fckival,1577727091.0,Aww that would make more sense. I thought maybe it was a way to say that thin people eat the same amount as fat people.
fatlogic,fckjj2x,t1_fck31z5,1577726709.0,Most people that I've seen that wear vintage thrift or buy from resellers. Or they sew their own 'new vintage' clothes. I belong to a group for a designer that only makes reproduction patterns for vintage.
fatlogic,fckiw8m,t1_fckit4u,1577726319.0,Donuts. It's a fact!
fatlogic,fcki0oq,t3_ehoffh,1577725773.0,"""people who lose weight are the same people, with the same rights and deserts."" What does that even mean?"
fatlogic,fchzhtk,t3_ehael4,1577655966.0,"If they wanted real rebuttals they could just read the research that is out there and use that information to draw their own conclusions about how healthy it is. Then give their opinion based on that. Pretty simple. You don't need other people to tell you what you think.
That's to much work though.. Plus all science is fatphobic apparently."
fatlogic,fch1ids,t1_fcbg0er,1577646342.0,I always found myself on the ground eventually anyway. It's been a long time though and maybe they are better now.
fatlogic,fch1d35,t1_fcfwe73,1577646292.0,Yea. That's been my experience. You end up on the floor at some point. Maybe they are better now and they don't deflate but I've found them disappointing in the past.
fatlogic,fca0l1u,t1_fc983pq,1577561015.0,"I mean you can go for other then physical reasons. I have adhd and when I was on medication I had to go monthly due to the laws in place around meds. I think they changed them to every 2-3 months now though. 
I also had to do a bunch of physical therapy as a kid because I have crappy ankles. I just went in for new orthotics actually as I need custom made ones."
fatlogic,fc9y6y5,t1_fc9sp6c,1577559971.0,I'm not sure sir mattresses are comfortable regardless of size.
fatlogic,fc6x6kz,t3_egin25,1577491797.0,"I mean I suppose a 6'5"" guy could technically weigh more then a 4'10"" women but that doesn't actually mean anything. So I'm not sure what they are getting at."
fatlogic,fc4ds3t,t3_eg4s63,1577413744.0,This mind set sounds exhausting. Literally everything around them in a personal attack it seems.
