offmychest,fehsve4,t3_ep2uwz,1579123201.0,"There's nothing wrong with enjoying it, and there will be a time where you can feel the same again, but slightly losing interest, and rushing for a new honeymoon phase in a new relationship, and you'll never be able to settle down and have a happy, loving family."
offmychest,fehsj08,t3_ep1ivw,1579123010.0,Did you ever make plans and invite them?
introvert,fehhr5n,t1_fehf174,1579116787.0,No way. I'll never be able to understand those type of people.
introvert,fegr15b,t3_eot04w,1579100512.0,"I agree with you and NihilistValues, you are contradicting yourself right now since it is a form of social communication.

Introverts just means you are 'recharging' when being alone, time depends I guess from person to person. I would go insane without interacting with people IRL."
introvert,fegqsji,t3_eot9rt,1579100348.0,"Why is it hard to just straight out say it and be honest? If they've lost interest, found someone else, don't want to meet and so on, is all fine and understandable and carries respect.

But ignoring, lying to others is just such a cowardly thing and brings contempt."
introvert,fegqa39,t3_eotaj5,1579099997.0,"For being correct almost every time to how people (I play a game of guessing) interact, speak or do, will end up etc, I feel nothing or like:""Yeah, I knew it."" I started feeling so happy when I am wrong and it is a pleasant surprise."

HowToHack,fe45342,t3_enr6ek,1578855863.0,To start.
offmychest,fdmwzo5,t1_fdmwodp,1578569622.0,Nope.

offmychest,fdm1tky,t1_fdlyho4,1578537790.0,"Thank you for the advice, I think you're right.  
Though my issue hasn't been with getting to talk to a girl I know.  
I have trouble starting a conversation with a girl I do not know at all, since as soon as I approach them and have some small talk and getting their phone number or something, they immediately assume I have romantic or sexual interests."
offmychest,fdm191v,t1_fdlzpxc,1578537408.0,">suz

Which part made you think I am unable or not ready to date? Or even assume I am already not in a relationship?What is indecent about me or my behavior? I am just having trouble starting a conversation with females since (probably all of them) encounters with guys they do not know have been for the sole purpose of dating or sex.

It's just comments, you have some issues."
offmychest,fdlxxed,t1_fdlvcoq,1578535138.0,"That is understandable, I do my part of telling other dudes to just fuck off when I see them obviously annoying a girl that is uninterested.
It also has something to do with the illusion of that alpha-beta bullshit.
I only ever stopped at the first ""no"" or signs that clearly show lack of interest."
offmychest,fdlrjo8,t1_fdlqvr4,1578530794.0,"Then I'd never say a single or do a single thing IRL, since I question every tinsy winsy detail about what I do and say. RIP me."
offmychest,fdlq3kr,t1_fdll3hx,1578529804.0,"The painful reality is they will always assume that if you ask her out or w/e, that you HAVE to fuck, date, initiate a romantic relationship.  
Long gone are the days where you could befriend someone this way."
offmychest,fdlppjh,t1_fdla291,1578529540.0,"Because of this reputation  about men, I am literally so afraid of approaching a girl to make some small talk and hopefully become a friend."
offmychest,fdlpd25,t3_elxt3x,1578529306.0,"I totally agree, also comes from me, a male, I have always enjoyed meeting people and getting to know them, some might have a great character or perhaps similar interests.So what happens is, I approach a girl, introduce myself and make small talk, then I ask her if she would like to hang out or something and apparently I get denied because they think I have ulterior motives, such as me having sexual or romantic interests."
offmychest,fcc8c0p,t1_fcal6cd,1577595523.0,"Just wanted to point out that is not always the case. The close friends I hang out with and I care for and love... when in a dispute, or having a conversation or something.. and we don't see eye to eye, we always turn the topic into a mush, to be seen from all sides, perspectives and such so we do understand each other.  


Of course, we don't always agree, but we understand each other. You must've been around those that don't care to understand.

If you have a problem that you'd like to share, I'll gladly listen and try my best to understand. \^\^"
offmychest,fcc7o01,t3_egye58,1577595314.0,"Family are those that are always there for you, you spend most time with and care for you, the ones you love.

You build your own family, keep that in mind. Parents love and respect has to be earned from their side, and yours.

From what I can figure out, it seems to have been one sided."
offmychest,fcak1qq,t3_egt2z1,1577570709.0,I disagree. :p
