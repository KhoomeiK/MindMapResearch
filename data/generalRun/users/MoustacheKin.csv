DnD,fc5lx19,t1_fc51j7m,1577461077.0,"There was a Tumblr post from prokopetz about the untitled goose and how it shouldn't be a giant thing but a small one. Google pulled the text from the photo. Here you go:  
  
  
If I was going to put the Horrible Goose in a D&D game, I wouldn't make it some big high-CR threat - it'd just be a regular goose that's capable of regular goose stuff, with three significant exceptions:  
  
1. It can show up anywhere, even if there's no reasonable way for it to have
gotten there.  
  
2. It seems to have limited ontological inertia. Of the players imprison it, it
vanishes from its prison when they're not looking. If they kill it, another goose shows up eventually. It'd be impossible to prove that it's always the same goose, save for the third notable trait...  
  
3. ..namely, that it doesn't show up in divinations. Like, at all. Predictions don't take it into account. Scrying on its location reveals an empty room. Spells that would detect it or read its mind act like there's no valid target present. If the cleric communes with their god and asks about it, their god has no idea what the cleric is talking about. It might take some doing to arrange for the players to become aware of this property, so don't force it - the opportunity will arise!  
  
There we go. No goofy boss monster trucks, yet it's guaranteed to drive your
players nuts - not even by harassing them, necessarily, but just by existing as
they try to figure out what it means, particularly once they learn of the third trait discussed above."

DMAcademy,fc5l1ht,t3_eg8spt,1577460443.0,"On your DM screen (even if it is paper handout dm material stuck to cardboard) make sure you write down your player's characters main stats (AC Max HP, Passive Perception, Passive Insight, main saving throws, stealth). Fold the paper so that it is draped over the top and you can read all the stats (make sure you give the paper some extra room). With this you can track initiative of your players and enemies in combat, but also you don't have to constantly ask if attacks hit."
