A vertical slit will produce greater image resolution along the horizon at the expense of vertical resolution. The animal can detect and pinpoint horizontal motion when tracking prey. A horizontal slit is better at vertical resolution for instance in grazing animals looking for good veggies to eat. Taking the Fourier transform of the shot will show what the pupil emphasizes.
