To her credit it was a black comedy which she didn't know what that was. Well I put it in expecting teen wolf or something like that and get someone getting nailed in a field. Scared the ever living shit out of me and I stopped the movie. I couldn't stop thinking about it though and now chase the scare like some people chase the dragon"

WatchPeopleDieInside,ff6e26c,t1_ff6ccmi,1579625176.0,"I've answered elsewhere in the thread but since black shirt didn't touch the ball to return it, it is orange shirts point. It's a strategy to make it bounce back on your side before your opponent can touch the ball."

WatchPeopleDieInside,ff67xqe,t1_ff5zu7p,1579621259.0,Yeah it's called adding a spin to the ball. Black shirt started it off with a spin serve and orange shirt used that to add more spin to his return. Add that with his volley return making black shirt loose track and he didn't have time to respond
WatchPeopleDieInside,ff67jao,t1_ff66isy,1579620991.0,"No, it doesn't matter who's side the two bounces for a point happen on. Since black shirt didn't touch the ball it's orange shirts point. Making the ball double back on your own side is a very viable strategy"

whowouldwin,ff3iz27,t1_ff39fqa,1579542050.0,But that's alot of assumptions. Are the planets comprised of the same materials? Are the stars of namek the same distance from it as our one is from Earth? Or are they hotter sun's but farther away?
whowouldwin,ff39910,t1_ff37zza,1579536685.0,If it has the same gravity as earth wouldn't it have the same gravitational pull? Regardless if it was bigger? And arguing the pulls of the stars without knowing their astrological path through their system and how it effects Namek is pointless. We can assume that they must be perfectly placed as to not cause any over due stress on the planet or cause deviations from its normal path as they seem to have fairly consistent weather.
whowouldwin,ff2sbto,t1_ff2gavm,1579522010.0,It may be bigger but it may be less dense? If it had more gravity wouldn't Bulma have been affected?
