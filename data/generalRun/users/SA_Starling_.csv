Both are cheaper than an alcoholic drink, but I've seen guys get mad about it because they're not trying to buy you a DRINK, they're trying to buy a lowering of your inhibitions. 

They reveal themselves one way or another. If a man thinks that buying me dinner entitles him to sex, more often than not theyve gotten upset when I said I wanted to go dutch. And not in the, 'but I asked you out, I wanted this to be my treat', kind of way, but a more belligerent, pushy, 'why wont you let me pay? You think I'm too poor to take you out? Are you one of those feminazis who cant just let men be men?' 

Theyll show you who they are quickly enough.

My husband gave me his number. Didnt ask for mine; offered me his. Put all of the power and control in my court; there was no way that I just capitulated out of fear, I had to call him of my own free will, he just gave me the means to do so. 

My best friend wont ever undress or help undress a girl the first time he sleeps with them. She takes off her clothes, he takes off his. That way he knows that she is there of her own free will; hes not pressuring her or forcing her into anything. 

Confident men will face rejection without it hurting their pride. Theyll face a woman meeting them as an equal with gratitude. Insecure men will argue and point fingers."

I also have a genetic condition that causes my heart rate to rise to dangerous levels if I; play sports, run around, stand up too quickly, etc. 

I just had myself sterilized. Voluntarily, and permanently, sterilized. 

Because my odds of bearing a living child and surviving that birth are LOW. More likely than not, I would have miscarriage after miscarriage after miscarriage, never getting anywhere near having a living child. And even if I do birth a living child, I'm more likely to stroke out or have a heart attack during the labor and delivery, leaving behind a partner or my family members who now have to raise my child without me; a burden and a responsibility that none of them signed up for. 

And, if by some miracle, I managed to birth a living child and survive the delivery myself..... their odds of having the same genetic condition as me is SO HIGH. I know what it's like to live with this. I'm very functional, all things considered, many people with my condition are much worse off. But even I am constantly reminded of what I have lost; I grieve my lost health DAILY. I used to run everywhere for the sheer JOY of it; I was fast and wild and strong and so sure of the swiftness of my feet and the knowledge that they could take me anywhere. I felt confident and capable and all of that is GONE. I cant run more than a few yards without being unable to breathe, getting lightheaded, and passing out. My body has betrayed me in the worst possible way; it failed me. And I will NEVER get it back. I am watching my body continue to fail me as I age; I'm looking at a future that may contain a wheelchair if I am very, very unlucky. 

To watch a child of mine grow up to become like me..... to watch them grow up capable and strong and healthy only for their body to fail them and them loose that strength and capability, to watch them, knowing that this genetic flaw came from me..... would be unbearable. 

If you want biological children, either find someone else, or find a goddamn surrogate. Grow the fuck up. Determine your boundaries. Determine what your breaking point is. 

But dont try to make her become something she isnt. Dont make her have to bend to your wishes. Dont push her boundaries."

First and foremost; YOU ARE NOT WEAK. You are not bad, or a pussy, or any of the other things you said about yourself during the course of this discussion. Your self talk is SERIOUSLY damaging, and you dont deserve it. Speak to yourself more gently; red flag it when you call yourself a pussy or anything like that. 

You were hurt by someone you loved and trusted. She used the fact that you are a GOOD man, a BRAVE man. It takes SERIOUS courage to stand there and let someone hit you in the face, and to NOT hit back. You could have killed her. If you hadnt been as good of a man as you are, you would have. And you were so STRONG to rebuild your life and try again after being treated so horribly!! You're doing so well for yourself. Not everybody does it. I'm not saying this lightly or to blow smoke up your ass; you're doing very well. 

In terms of the new girlfriend, I THINK that if you open up to her, she wont think less of you. If she is ANY kind of a decent person, she will be horrified that this has happened to you, and will want to do as much as she can to make sure that you feel safe, and comfortable, and secure around her. 

My husband knew my past. He knew that if we were arguing, I could not stand to be within arms reach of him. It didnt mean I didnt trust him, it meant that it wasnt something I could handle, and it was an easy concession to my comfort that he could make. 

Let her show you that she loves you. Let her show you through her actions that she is the safe place for your heart to run to. 

If you leave her now, without telling her, you'll be in this same place the next relationship you have. And the next one. And the next one. You will never be able to move forward from this stage. And you deserve to be able to move forward. You deserve to be able to trust. You deserve to be able to love openly and honestly.

There is no competition. You cannot run a race against a dead man. Honoring his memory doesnt dishonor her current partner. Her deceased fiance is in her past; her current partner has the option to be both her present and future. How is that less than? 

Everyone has a past. We are all changed from our interactions with others and our experiences. Her deceased fiance changed her in a lot of ways. You cannot, and should not, erase that. 

If OP loves her, he fell in love with her as a person who lost a partner to death. To ask her to pretend that never happened, get over it, move on, or otherwise rewrite history isnt just unhealthy, its cruel. 

You're right; she wasnt married to him, so shes not 'technically' his widow. But our society doesn't have a word for someone who has lived with their fiance for years, or been in a long term relationship but never married and then loses their partner. A marriage certificate is a piece of paper. A relationship is a life lived together.

Someone who feels like they are competing with a dead man is insecure, to start with. Do you think you're competing for your SOs love if they love their parents? Their friends? Their pets? What if they love their job, and have a satisfying career that you're not a part of? Are you so insecure that you have to be the only person in their life? They cant have anyone else? 

She will ALWAYS have grief. Those we love never truly leave us. That doesnt mean that she cant be happy with OP. That doesnt mean that she cant love again. But grief doesn't go away. Your life grows around it, from it, because of it, and more things fill your life other than the grief, but that doesnt mean it goes away. 

He gets to share a life with her. He does get her TIME moving forward. Yeah, he has to share her with her deceased fiance's family. He also, hopefully, shares her with his family, and her family, and her job, and her friends, and her hobbies. Shes not a prisoner in a basement, there for just him. Shes a full human being with what sounds like a well rounded life and lots of people who love her. That's a blessing, not a downside.

AmItheAsshole,fejjvr2,t3_ephr8m,1579177287.0,"YTA. I once had to fly with a simultaneous sinus, bladder, and kidney infection. I had no idea that I had gotten that many infections at once until I got where I landed; all I knew was I was sick as a dog trying to fly home. 

I was 18, I had gone to my biological fathers family for Christmas. It was the first time I had seen them since I was 3. I finished the trip, knew that I was sick with something, and knew that I still had to fly home that day, or else I wasnt going to be able to get home. Period. I had literally zero choices. I was very obviously sick, and no one around me had any way of knowing that I wasnt contagious, but nobody said anything unkind to me. I used hand sanitizer like a champ, I kept to myself, and I got home okay. 

I'm so grateful no one said anything unkind to me. There was nothing I could do about it and that would have made a tough situation even worse. When you're in an enclosed space with a bunch of other people, you have to help out. You grab a barf bag for the person with motion sickness. Pass a piece of  candy to the mom with a kid having a meltdown because their ears hurt. Just be kind. And wash your damn hands. A cold wont kill you."
relationship_advice,fejj7n2,t3_epfsrb,1579176558.0,"Speaking as a widow. 

She never will stop loving them. Of course there is a sadness to her. Nobody touched by that level of grief ever stops grieving or goes back to who they were before. And, yes, you are sharing her heart with another person. This isnt a break up where she moved on, this is a loss that she had to move forward from. 

None of these things mean you're not important to her. None of them means that she didnt choose you as the successor to her deceased significant other, which, trust me, comes with all kinds of guilt and a lot of thought, because there is a pressure to pick someone that you think your deceased significant other would approve of. And she picked YOU. 

If you want her to start telling her before she goes to see his family, you may want to sit her down and let her know (if you are) that you're okay with it. That you love the fact that she can go somewhere to talk to people about him, be supported, continue to share love with the people who loved him deeply and love her as the last piece of him. My mother in law calls me her daughter. She lost a son, but gained another daughter. Shes were I go to talk about him. To share that hurt and grief. Let your girlfriend know how grateful you are for her to have that family and that you support her in her relationship to them.

A lot of people have trouble with this idea of not being EVERYTHING to their significant other. Let that go. You cannot be everyone to her; she still needs friends, and family, and acquaintances, and all the other social bonds that people have both before and after they pair up. This is just another one of those bonds. 

Her grief isnt about you. But her life with you IS. You cant have ALL of the space on her timeline, but you will have ALL of the space moving forward.

For 4 years, I never once had a single thought about another person other than my husband. Then, I develop a crush on an old acquaintance that hit me up online. Hes a nice dude, I know we are sexually compatible because we discussed the possibility of hooking up years before I met my husband, and hes going through a rough patch and we talk a lot. 

I NEVER spoke to him in a way that I wouldnt talk to any of my other friends. Not once. He never knew I had a crush on him, I never suggested anything, we didnt flirt, nothing. But I still felt SO GUILTY. I love my husband SO MUCH, why was this happening? 

The more I thought about it, the more I realized that the whole reason I was having a crush on this guy was because me and my husband were going through a dead period in our sex life. I missed feeling wanted, I missed being pursued, I missed knowing someone else thought I was hot and sexy and desirable. 

I sat down and tried to imagine what my life would look like without my husband. I imagined trying to pursue something with this other guy, what my life would look like, and it wasnt what I wanted. The idea of loosing my husband left me sick at my stomach. The idea of fucking that guy left me feeling empty. And I knew a life lived without my husband wasnt what I wanted. 

So I went and talked to my husband. I was scared shitless that this would hurt his feelings, or wound his pride, or piss him off. And it was not an easy conversation! But we had the conversation, we talked about what I wanted, what I needed, I expressed the frustration and dissatisfaction that I had been trying so hard to stuff down for months.... and ya know what? Things got better. My husband and I did date nights more. We started discussing things more. Going on walks together. Cooking together. Shopping together. And that crush? Disappeared. 

I never told my husband about the crush. It was a symptom of the problem, and I told him about the problem instead, because it never went anywhere but inside my own head and no one knew about the crush but me. 

And you know what? I am so, so grateful for those last months with my husband. We hadnt gotten to 'fix' things exactly the way we wanted or planned, but we had mended something between us and were closer than we had been in a long time. It was exactly what we needed.

My husband was a liver recipient. That transplant, that donated organ, saved his life 8 months before he met me. 

We got 5 years, 6 months together. I cherish every single second of those years. 

And without that liver, I wouldnt have gotten any of them. When he died, the hospital contacted me regarding organ donation. He ended up being unable to donate, but I knew he would have wanted to because he was the most generous person I ever met. He would have wanted to give others the same gift he had been given. 

I know your sisters situation is very different. Maybe her religion would make this something she didnt want to do. But if you, knowing her, think she would want to help others, to share a gift while expecting nothing in return, or even if she was just really big on recycling.... well, I guess you have your answer. 

I'm sorry you're going through this. But I think that, even if you chose wrong, even if you give her organs for donation and die in 80 years and find out that she wouldn't have wanted that.... my therapist says the dead have perfect understanding.

AmItheAsshole,fdj8f66,t3_elm3jg,1578461416.0,"NTA, no matter what you decide to do. 

OP, you are making such a mature, rational, and reasonable decision right now! Your family members who were teen parents managed to do it, but you are being so rational in seeing that the world you are growing up in is VERY different than the one they grew up and raised their children in! 

I'm adopted. My bio dad gave up custody of me and my sister when I was 7, so that he could get out of paying child support. I never got to say goodbye, he just..... disappeared. I knew for a fact that man didnt want me or care about me enough to stay. 

But you know what? My adoptive dad did. He CHOSE me, he didnt have to, but he did anyway. He stayed. Even when I was sick and puked on his shoes, even when I broke my arm and he had to take me to the hospital, even when I was a brat and would yell and be mad at him, even when I was 17 and called him, drunk and alone, walking down some backwoods dirt road at midnight. He loved me unconditionally. 

Growing up knowing that someone chose me, that they wanted me enough to go through all of lifes hard things? That meant so much. It STILL means so much. My Papa is the one who I still turn to when I need help. Hes still the one I call when something good happens. He was the first person I thought to call when the worst day of my life happened. 

If you give your baby up for adoption, there are no guarantees that they'll have the kind of relationship with their parents that I've had with my Papa. But theres no guarantees in LIFE, either. 

You do the best you can and play the hand you're dealt. And it sounds like you're trying to deal your baby the best hand you can. 

You're doing okay, honey. It will be alright."

service_dogs,fde7vz4,t3_ekw84p,1578333113.0,"The way I handled this at my last job was to kinda play innocent/dumb. (Innocent as in guileless, like I had had no idea that they had thought he was a pet and I couldn't believe they had made such a mistake, but I really want to reassure them). 

I'd say something along the lines of, 'oh, no hes not a pet! Hes medical equipment, a service dog! Did someone tell you that he was just a pet? I'm so sorry for the misunderstanding!' 

Normally, this would then open up a dialogue with them about the differences between service dogs and normal pets, and even hit the differences with Guide dogs, Military Working dogs and Police K9s, Emotional Support Animals, and Therapy dogs. 

I dont know how comfortable your husband would be with this, but I would also tell them as much about my medical issues as I felt comfortable with. I'd tell about how bad things were before being partnered, how grateful I was to have him, run through some of the different commands that he knows and how they help me and make me so much safer. I'd draw the parallel between service dogs and wheelchairs, or oxygen tanks, to really hammer home the idea that this is a medical issue that I really need help with, not just something I do because it's, 'fun.' I'd even share some of my bad experiences with people; the time someone grabbed me and tried to guide me around because they assumed I was blind and how much it scared me, the time a woman grabbed my arm to force me to stand there and answer the questions she had about my dog and how she made me feel uncomfortable and vulnerable. Most people dont feel like it's so much fun when they hear things like that! 

I never had issues after this. Phrasing it as an honest misunderstanding and me being eager to clear up the mistake always kept people from feeling attacked or like I was trying to pull something over on them. And once I cleared it up, people didnt feel so much like I was getting something they weren't."

AmItheAsshole,fdcz3mi,t1_fdcuz3j,1578288645.0,"My husband would always try to notice the little things I did. He had a great memory, and could somehow always spot new changes in the house, like when I'd dust a fan or reorganize some out of the way spot. Hed brag about my accomplishments to his colleagues or friends, like when I repainted our entire house in under 4 months by myself. He talked about that one for weeks, just gushing about how proud he was of me and that really made me feel good. He would thank me for little stuff. One thing that he did every day was say, 'have I told you today how beautiful you are?' 

Whenever we discussed finances, he made it a point to always say that we made such and such amount, or we have this much money in the bank. He made me feel like an equal member in that. 

One time, when I was feeling really badly about the fact that I couldn't contribute financially as much, he sat down and totalled out how much he would have to pay other people to do all the things I did. Getting groceries delivered, walking the dogs, taking dogs to the vet, a maid service, a personal chef, lawn care service, repainting the house, he would total up all of those things and then show me how much it would cost him if he had to pay for it. He literally showed me what my unpaid labor was worth. He would also tell me how much his standard of living had improved since I had moved in; he would gush over my cooking, or how wonderful the house looked and smelled, how the dogs were always bathed and their nails kept trimmed, he would comment on how nice it was to not have to iron his shirts or have to run to the dry cleaners after a busy day. 

Please note, I have no idea if any of this is helpful for your case. I'm just hoping that by telling you the things that he would say and how they made me feel, it might help you extrapolate things that you might be able to tell your bf to show how much you appreciate him. And then, maybe, that can also leave a path for you to mention how much you appreciate it when he handles the little things, like washing your coffee cup, so that you dont have to carry that bit of the mental load. 

Also, please mention to him that he has my sympathy for his health issues. My husband had health issues as well, and that always hit his pride pretty hard too. Your boyfriend sounds like hes carrying a load on his shoulders and still performing admirably and doing a damn fine job."

We were a partnership, but I had a hard time dealing with the fact that I couldnt contribute financially as much as he did. Before I got sick I was a total work horse; it was one of my best qualities! To not be able to do as much really rubbed my pride the wrong way, so I constantly felt that I had to make up for not being an equal partner. 

But my husband never felt that way, he never let me talk about myself that way, and he never treated me that way. Maybe that's why I never minded doing extra for him.

When I was 16, I was contacted by a 26 year old man. He talked to me through Facebook, got my number, would call me late at night when my parents were asleep, and he knew just how to play the come here go away game. He would talk about how pretty I was, and then follow it up with how I wasnt pretty enough. Hed act like he wanted to hang out with me, and then blow me off. Hed say something sexual, then say that I was too much of a little girl and there was no way I'd be able to handle a man like him, and that I should run back to the little boys I was used to. In short, he knew exactly how to play me so that I would be wanting his approval, prove to him that I wasnt a little girl, show that I could handle him, etc. He would ask me to have a female friend drop me off at his house, so that my parents wouldnt know I were I was, and when I told him none of my female friends had a car, he tried to convince me to get my parents to drop me off at a movie theater and that he would come pick me up and take me back to his place. 

I got so unbelievably lucky; I was never stupid enough to meet up with him, he never actually managed to hurt me, but, god, honey, I think back on those conversations and I literally break out in a cold sweat. I found out later that man raped both his adoptive and biological sisters; they were 15 and 12. He had a thing for vulnerable little girls, and he was a predator of the worst kind.

That man was trying to groom me. There was no reason a 26 year old man should be saying the things he said to me, as a 16 year old girl, EVER. I'm 26 now and I wouldnt EVER talk to a 16 year old kid that way, I look at them and I just see children, because that's exactly what they are! They are by no means ready for any kind of relationship, let alone with someone so much older than them! 

I bet that you are really smart for your age; more mature than your peers. Maybe you like older guys because you feel like you're more on their level, or because they make you feel sophisticated and grown up. Theres nothing wrong with liking older men, but, honey, let me give you the advice my mama told me, and it took me YEARS to realize how right she was.

 No older man who is WORTHY OF YOU will touch you right now. Not one of them will want to have a relationship with you, and that's a GOOD thing, because it means that they see you for who and what you are, and want you to have the time and experience to grow up without them influencing or directing you. Any man who is willing to have a relationship with you while you're 17 is a jerk who doesnt give a damn about you. Period. 

My husband was 15 years older than me. But I was 20 when we met, and in a VERY different place in my life; I'd gone to college, tried to go military, found out I had a major medical issue, and figured out how to manage that health issue and work a job that could support myself. We were on equal footing when we met, and we could be PARTNERS.

In terms of the actual question you asked; a long waiting period can be a blessing in disguise. The wait time you've described is pretty par the course, I've seen longer ones, and I've seen organizations that say it will be an almost 4 year wait time who get the dog partnered with you in 3 years. 

The wait time can be a blessing because it gives you lots of time to figure out what you need help with the most; in terms of medical alert, what's the range you have the most problems in? Do you need help opening doors, or picking up dropped items, or retrieving things? How often on each one of those tasks? You've got time to figure out gear, business cards for access issues or pushy bystanders, make plans for how to handle each place you typically frequent and how it will be different now that you've got a service dog at your hip. This gives you time to discuss plans with family, colleges, friends, etc, to smooth out issues now rather than while you're also working on getting acquainted with your partner. 

It may also give you the time you would need if you decided a service dog isnt the best thing for you. (PLEASE NOTE: IM NOT SAYING A SERVICE DOG ISNT THE RIGHT ROUTE FOR YOU.) But I've known handlers who hopped right into it, got a dog less than 6 months after they made the decision (started owner training) only to realize that they weren't ready for the problems that come with a service dog, or that a service dog wont help them as much as they thought, or their life has suddenly changed in a way that makes it where a service dog wont fit in their life anymore. Then they end up having to wash the dog, and either go through the struggle of rehoming it or they now have to figure out the costs associated with having a pet.

Use the time to your fullest advantage. Plan it, figure it out, trouble shoot. Look for problems, and then solve them."

Girl, throw the whole boyfriend away. 

My husband had NEVER liked short hair on a woman. Never liked shaved sides, undercuts, or anything else that involved shaving any part of the head. He didn't really like drastically colored hair (all over pink or green or purple), and he didn't really like super curly either. 

I did ALL of those things while he was alive. I had a pixie cut for years. I did a undercut before that. I did a total blue dye job at one point. I had a perm at one point. When he died, I had the left side of my head shaved. 

Do you know what he said with all of those? 

'I've never liked such and such on a woman before, but, damn, honey, you look GREAT! Look at you, sexy hotness!' 

He LOVED anything I did with my hair, because he LOVED me. It didnt matter overmuch what I chose to do with my hair, because my hair wasnt what he loved or found attractive about me. It was ME. Period. He never told me what I could or couldnt do with my hair. Whenever I would say that I'd love to do X with my hair, but I knew he hated it and so I couldn't, he would tell me that I shouldnt decide things because of him, that if I wanted to do X with my hair then I should because he would love me no matter what I did with my hair! 

Find someone who values you more for who you are honey. What will he do if you get cancer and lose all your hair? If you shave your head in solidarity for a family member? Decide you'd rather be blond again?
