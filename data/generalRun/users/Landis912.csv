Biggest thing I've learned and realized that no matter how fucked up you get your problems are still there and sometimes worse when you sober up.

As a youth I would of course just drink to get sloshed and to ""fit in"" but didnt like it a ton. Now I'm 30 and a dad and really appreciate a quiet Sunday at home watching the game with a beer or cracking one open after work, and recently have really begun to appreciate having beer with meals, frankly it's just wonderful. I also have no issue just having one to enjoy it, maybe 2 or 3 if I want to feel a little sleepy and lay down but still feel fine when I wake up.

I guess the point is there's no right or wrong but theres a reason the stuff has been around for thousands of years and enjoyed the world over, and not just for its intoxicating properties. When I eat out I also like to enjoy a decaf coffee after because the taste just goes with everything and is the perfect capper to a meal(along with a cigarette honestly but that I abstain from as it makes you too stinky.)"

I work for a mortgage bank and as of 2017 we're required to take very specific demographic info for all applicants(down to what 'type' of hispanic or asian they are) to assure we're offering the same loan terms to everybody.
