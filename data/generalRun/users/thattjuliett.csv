BlackPeopleTwitter,ffn5qyu,t1_ffmzr1c,1580062303.0,"What worked for me was starting at just 30s, then rest and do 30s more. I'd do more reps everyday. One day I just felt like 30s was nothing and pushed it to 60s. Then I did 2 reps of 60s. Then I did 3. It gets super easy with time."
BlackPeopleTwitter,ffmq1v2,t1_ffml5rm,1580057780.0,"On the first day of planking I was dead at 30s. My body was shaking like crazy and I thought I was about to die. Every day I pushed for a few seconds more and now, two weeks later, I can easily push through 60s up to 1m30s"
WatchPeopleDieInside,ffl68e8,t1_ffk9ics,1580035428.0,"Our cat does this too. She's yell and paw and scratch at you for human food, but then you give it to her she'll sniff it and yeet it away with her paw."
loseit,ffeyu0e,t3_esxuvh,1579870749.0,Had a similar happy moment today. I wear a belt on my jeans and I had to buckle it one hole tighter today!
HolUp,ff5u9od,t1_ff4zmp3,1579610461.0,"Holy shit I'm having a meltdown right now. I thought my english was good and I've been spelling it like ""definetly"" my whole f-ing life and seeing this really messed with my brain."
fatlogic,ff29a64,t1_ff0j05e,1579497596.0,"Lol I just watched an episode where a woman put sugar, butter and peanut butter into her cereal. Who puts butter in cereal??"
fatlogic,fezp85j,t1_feyyd9t,1579459937.0,Yep that's the one
fatlogic,feytysc,t1_feyilek,1579450481.0,"Season 3 episode 1. If I remember correctly in the beginning the participants have to give the show a food diary and even the host says that judging by her food diary she should have been losing weight and not gaining, so they knew from the beginning she wasn't being honest."
fatlogic,fey9jeb,t3_eqvvrb,1579442539.0,"I watched an episode of Supersize vs superskinny not too long ago and if you haven't seen the show, they choose two people, one underweight and one overweight and they swap diets for a few days. So the two women in that ep switch foods (the obese woman's portions were quite normal) and the skinny one is like ""there's no way you got that big with only this"" and the obese woman just keeps lying that it's what she eats and so on and eventually storms off crying. 

What I'm trying to say is that overweight people lie to everyone, even to themselves about the amount they eat because they don't want to admit to themselves that they are their own problem."
loseit,fendgx3,t3_epzm6q,1579282334.0,"I'm in a similar boat, but then again not really. I'm not overweight, never have been, but I do have fat in places where I don't want it to be. I posted in this sub two weeks ago for advice and people gave me a new insight. I started training immediately (mostly just bodyweight exercises, and some barbell exercises at home) and I've been sticking to this routine for these two weeks. I know it's soon but I've already started to see some progress. My stomach looks a bit tighter and less bloated already, which could be also due to the fact that I count my calories and try to eat for maintenance, but I can actually see some definition in my upper ab area which I haven't seen in a while. I feel so much healthier, I have more energy, and I feel sooo motivated to achieve my goal and get fit! Strength training is awesome! Cardio is good for overall health and all, but strength training really makes me feel so much better."
BadMUAs,fekjrjy,t3_epiiga,1579201507.0,"To be honest, this one isn't even that bad. I'd fix the whole eye situation and add some bronzer and it would look okay."
BadMUAs,fekgvpg,t3_epgafe,1579199785.0,They overdid literally everything but gave 0 attention to those brows??
cats,feehvmh,t1_feeapnk,1579034073.0,Our cat did that not too long ago too. Just sat next to the bed and looked at us with her judgy eyes until we shooed her out of the bedroom. And then she sat in front of the closed door and waited.
memes,feeedhj,t3_eom2dg,1579032026.0,Is there a sub like r/memes but without these posts about InStAgRaM bAd ReDdIt GoOd because they're getting pretty cringy
Justfuckmyshitup,fee7kdz,t3_eok45q,1579028033.0,Oh no. My mum has this exact haircut. Oh boy.
BeautyGuruChatter,fed8kiy,t1_fed3jn2,1579003722.0,"Same here. I saw the video when I just woke up and I thought ""oh she's bi"" or something like that but I never in a million years would've thought she was transgender! She's such a beautiful woman!"
Nicegirls,feafpnx,t1_fe6fv3v,1578948156.0,"So if I wear a ton of makeup you and her are saying I should let go of my man because I'm not a ""real woman"" and give him to you?"
Nicegirls,feaa8lw,t1_fea5nzm,1578946207.0,Exactly what I was gonna say
GetMotivated,fe9ua0v,t1_fe9rkif,1578941489.0,I didn't know pregnancy and breastfeeding can result in that mich weight gain/loss! I though you gain a few kilos but I never would've thought you can lose so much.
GetMotivated,fe9psm2,t1_fe9gq7r,1578940368.0,This. Also for women the timing of the cycle is also important due to water retention during that time of the month. You can weigh around 5 pounds more!
xxfitness,fe9cyig,t1_fe99m73,1578936454.0,"I am definetly thinking of buying equipment or signing up in a gym in the future but until I stick to a routine for at least a month or two I will try to do workouts at home with minimal equipment. I am also going to buy a band (the ones that go over thighs for resistance) and I already have a pull up bar. 
So do you think, in theory, my routine should get me some results (strength-wise and visible)?"
Slovenia,fe94jep,t1_fe6wndg,1578934185.0,"Can confirm

xxfitness,fe8mgfq,t3_eo07ij,1578927924.0,"I'm not sure if anyone is going to see this but I'm gonna take my chances but I just started regularly working out a week ago and I wanted to ask if my routine would give me any results? I have very limited equipment at home, I only have a barbell and a yoga mat so I try to do as much bodyweight exercises as I can. I'm 21F 5'5 and 57kg.

I do squats, barbell squats, regular crunches, side oblique crunches, leg lifts, reverse crunches, extended reverse crunches, push ups, plank, barbell curls etc... around 20 exercises, some days I target legs, some days abs, some days if I feel especially motivated I do full body workouts ... I do at least one more rep everyday and can definetly already see a change in how many reps I can do (for example, I could barely do 5x10 squats a week ago, and I can now easily do 5x20 with no leg pain). I'm eating in maintenance or slight deficit, since I want to recomp. Is this an okay plan? What would you guys reccomend?"
