confessions,ferfh14,t1_fer0lnb,1579353301.0,Isn't it awful how lonely birthdays are.
confessions,ferfcye,t1_fer0sji,1579353256.0,The only reason I haven't done it is because I have 2 little sisters that would be devastated.
confessions,feoow3m,t1_feooi16,1579303285.0,What happens next will be the same.
confessions,feoo29s,t1_feomfgv,1579302823.0,But why?
confessions,feonz2i,t1_feonqs5,1579302771.0,I just want it to stop. Call it selfish but it won't change anything.

CasualConversation,fel28g3,t1_fel24o8,1579212476.0,I'm really uncultured when it comes to books it seems. I have no clue what those are. Lol
CasualConversation,fel1kgz,t1_fel19rg,1579212067.0,Afraid I haven't heard of it. What's the premise?
CasualConversation,fel1ifc,t1_fel1duj,1579212033.0,What's it about?
bisexual,fek7xmn,t1_fek7py8,1579194478.0,It's really jarring. Is there a way to stop it?

furry,fek28ym,t1_fek1uwq,1579191062.0,That's true. The only reason it's nsfw is nipples so I could just redraw it if need be.
bisexual,fek0shx,t3_epd06s,1579190163.0,Basically. Is there a reason why this happens so much? I have problems a lot like this with my bisexuality.
furry,fek02t4,t1_fejxhds,1579189721.0,Would a black bar count?
furry,fejm789,t1_fejke8d,1579179602.0,Could be. :p

Gunpla,feevc9l,t1_feeuuug,1579042007.0,Earthree just came in the mail so veetwo will probably stay core. I like the colors. Looks really practical.
Gunpla,feepuv2,t1_feep7t0,1579038695.0,Articulation is a bit limited but I can forgive that because it is just a grunt. I really want the tieren ground type. I think it is a PERFECT looking military mecha.
Gunpla,feenfbm,t1_feemope,1579037287.0,You really should. This guy is solid as a rock. I think it's because the leg gimmick is absent.

Gunpla,feeebfr,t1_feedk7w,1579031992.0,Core gundam is super cute to me so I may keep it as that.  Not sure yet.
Gunpla,feduqix,t1_fedu73y,1579020310.0,Mine too actually. I love the weird design. I'm getting the hg death army in the mail today. I'm super excited for that one.
Gunpla,fedu3nw,t1_fedtw6q,1579019922.0,"Isn't it? I love how chunky it is. Honestly, I'm starting to enjoy building grunts more than gundams."

furry,fde8obu,t1_fde5vah,1578333611.0,"Dunno. I intend him to be some kind of new species. I envisioned it as some kind if alien. In the earliest stages, he was a demon."
bisexual,fddy2ym,t1_fddxt7h,1578326770.0,I think it's ingrained in the human psyche at this point.
bisexual,fddvt4v,t1_fddvba9,1578325211.0,It's just how we are. Can't exactly change who we like. People never seem to change huh? I think discrimination will be eternal sadly.
bisexual,fddupvm,t1_fdduinm,1578324447.0,"That's pretty shitty of them. I thought we were all on the same side, I never knew discrimination was internal even in the lgbt community. Don't they realize they're acting like the very people who harass them?"
bisexual,fddu28j,t1_fddt3g3,1578323982.0,How come people are so apathetic to bisexuals?
bisexual,fddrlln,t1_fddqo8d,1578322149.0,Thank you so much! This is exactly what I needed. :]
