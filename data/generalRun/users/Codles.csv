dogs,fd3rvdq,t1_fd3ly7l,1578161131.0,"Yep. This worked well for our terrier. Our folks gave her a fresh of dirt in the backyard. They also fenced in and put rocks on top of the flower beds. 


Maybe, having a place to dig at home will help satisfy his dig ""urge""?"
dogs,fd3r6mm,t3_ejyiyu,1578161016.0,"Awkwardly stares at me while I sleep. When I actually wake, I can feel her eyes on me. She knows. Then she lets out the softest of whines. 


When I do finally get up, she huffs and puffs excitedly and does mini zooms. 


I love the conversations she and I have."
lookatmydog,fcwrhw0,t3_ejaxyk,1578034708.0,Compromise that works for my folks: train him to only lay on his blanket on the couch. Worked for theirab/dobbie puppy.
Eyebleach,fcwogya,t3_ej810i,1578031623.0,"Looks sweet, but I thought kennels were supposed to be the one place a dog can go to get away. Where they have safe space to remain unmolested. Not saying his kid doesn't mean well, but even the sweetest of animals need their own space."
DobermanPinscher,fcwhxl7,t3_ej8hxp,1578026083.0,Wouldn't the breeder be the person to ask? I am sure they can direct you to appropriate reading.
AskReddit,fcvlwrg,t1_fcuhivv,1578004918.0,"Thank you for what you do. I have been blessed to have amazing vets in my life. They have made such a positive impact on mine and my pets lives. 


What can someone do to make their vets' loves more bareable?

Thank you card with pet pics? Great google reviews? Reminding them how awesome they are whenever we have appts? 

Anything else?"
ADHD,fctsdv6,t3_eiqo3l,1577957020.0,"One note: growth mindset is really great to teach kids. It is linked to greater success and resilience. 


One of the ways this is accomplished is by complimenting effort instead of -seemingly ""static"" traits. E.g. instead of saying ""you're so smart"" saying "" you worked really hard! You kept trying until you got the right answer!""



My parents used to ooze ""you're so smart"" and it fucked with my mind. Thought that if I didn't immediately succeed I failed. I had to learn to practice and practice and accept failure as part of that. 


Also, make sure you and his Mom/Dad are kind to yourselves. No negative self talk. Might even help to engage in vocal, positive self-talk. ""Ah man, I forgot my keys, that's okay, everyone makes mistakes. Good thing I figured it out now instead of later"". 



Just some thoughts for you. Best of luck with your kiddo."

ADHD,fcsm7zf,t3_eins2d,1577919526.0,"Go for it. Find a respectable physician,  psychiatrist, nurse practitioner. Make sure they are willing to prescribe meds as part of a treatment plan before you see them. 


You're just going to them to help you determine if ADHD is the cause. If it isn't that's okay, too. But it doesn't hurt to get checked."
ADHD,fcslunk,t3_einute,1577919284.0,"What I wonder about is, don't neurotypicals OD on dopamine? I accidently took a double dose once and made myself sick. It's fucking unpleasant. How can they manage???"
reactivedogs,fcslm5m,t1_fcsj7vu,1577919131.0,"Oh my gosh! I am so sorry you are dealing with that! It's like dogs straight up revolt against things that are good for them. Of course, to be fair, we sometimes do that as humans, too."
Weddingsunder10k,fcslijh,t1_fcsjpmi,1577919066.0,"People have spent money in worse ways. Seriously! Good for you for taking the first step and being kind to yourself. If it's allowed, it'd be awesome to read periodic updates of how you are doing."
AskReddit,fcskbmw,t3_ein0yv,1577918296.0,"One piece. 

Whenever you engage in negative self talk: pause, take a deep breath, and force yourself to say something kind instead. 


Yes it'll feel corny, stupid, and disingenuine. 


Do it anyways. 


One day you'll catch your reflection in the mirror. You'll stop to admire your genuine smile and realize how gradual the transition was.


Yes, you'll backslide from time to time. That's ok. Give yourself permission to be leds than perfect. And start again. 


The cool thing about progress? A backslide doesn't erase previous progress. Progress isn't linear. Every backslide is a learning experience. 


It gets easier. Because of the effort you put in before. You get stronger. 


Confidence is a skill. The more you practice, the better you get. It's like a bike. Even if you stash it away in the garage, when you dust it off again you realize you never forgot ""how to""."
