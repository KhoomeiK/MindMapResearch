buffy,ffeq6qa,t3_estvpa,1579859986.0,I've literally just finished watching the whole series for the first time. This absolutely wrecked me. After all the OTT campy drama of sending your hunky dead boyfriend to hell the... silences and the awful stillness of these episodes were truly awful to watch.
offmychest,ffdp58z,t1_ffd1fux,1579825651.0,"Yep. If you see a job on Indeed, it's most likely posted elsewhere (and probably read/filtered elsewhere too), so try the company careers page. We use a service that allows us to post and monitor to multiple sites including Indeed. Indeed is a decent free tool for a company, you get a good amount of listings before they try and make a company pay for more, that's why it gets used."

AmItheAsshole,ff8vjv9,t3_es5wir,1579697537.0,"INFO. How do you KNOW your sister is lying other than her reaction to your ""gluten"" dish?

 As someone with coeliac disease, yes, it's really fucking annoying when people pretend to have a gluten sensitivity and don't, but there are a million reasons why someone may not want to eat something, and stress re: food can make you feel like absolute shit. Working out what is causing you issues can be really stressful, and it's sometimes very difficult to get a definitive answer without legitimate medical assistance. I was so ill for years without answers and I got to a stage where food issues made me panic like nobodies business.

Don't feed someone something they don't want to eat, even if you don't know the reasons. Just refuse to cook for them instead. If they're being a dick, they deserve to cool for themselves. If they do have a reason, you're not making them sick."

Iron Maiden tshirt - I've had this shirt for at least 15 years. It's really soft and worn and the printing is all cracked and lovely. I wish I hadn't cut the sleeves off, but I did. I wear it occasionally to the gym, maybe 10 times a year.

soccer,fekvxe2,t1_fejwnxp,1579208706.0,"False rape reports are going to be practically nil compared to *actual* rape cases, but of course the thing with false claims is, by nature the accuser wants something from the accused, for example money, so people will hear about it. It has to be out there for the accuser to get what they want. And they're often against high profile people so that feeds into the ""you hear about this a lot' thing. Whereas if you're a sexual assault victim, the likelihood of you not even going to the authorities is pretty damn high, so we hear less about those cases. People who make false allegations are scum."

Speaking from experience, if your partner is willing to try and listen to your honest (but kind!) feedback they'll start to feel more confident and eventually you'll get what you want. Often we really WANT to be able to do that for you but the percieved pressure of being 100% responsible for giving someone pleasure in an assertive way is terrifying for us with anxiety and confidence issues.
