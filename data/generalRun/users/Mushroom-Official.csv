CrappyDesign,fd66hj4,t1_fd3rvq2,1578186213.0,"In Europe most new cars do that when the break assist detects an emergency breaking maneuver over 60km/h. The brake lights flash and the hazard lights (turn indicators) start blinking. The brake lights stop flashing when you release brake force, but the hazard lights stay on until you turn it off, or until you return to normal driving behavior."
CrappyDesign,fd65kd2,t1_fd607uk,1578185836.0,"Don’t worry, even in Europe many people don’t know how to use it. In most of the countries it’s just for the last car in traffic, to signal the other cars. That there is a car in the fog. As a rule of thumb: when you can see the headlights of the cars behind you, they see your normal taillights and you are supposed to switch the fog light off. Because it’s blindingly bright. Additional different rules like speed limitations apply in several countries.

I would have to look it up now, but I think the fog light has 10x brightness of the standard light and the brake lights around 6-8x. But that’s also just a rule of thumb."
