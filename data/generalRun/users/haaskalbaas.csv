So, firstly, take this lesson to heart: never read a letter that is not addressed to you. Secondly, take your mother-in-law's words as being extremely subjective: as your SO's mother she is totally on his side, so remember this is not an objective view of your relationship with him. So to reply to your questions: 1) you didn't just 'see' the letter, you read it. It's entirely up to you whether you want to admit you did so or not; and 2) take the criticisms of your behaviour that you agree with to heart, and ignore the rest."
