China_Flu,ffuxatz,t1_ffuvujg,1580251114.0,"This is for SARS but it'd make sense they test the same things for 2019nCoV since they're similar.

China_Flu,ffuovxs,t1_ffuoj0b,1580246474.0,Definitely not too early for masks. A lot of places have sold out already. Perhaps it'll get better once production catches on but only time will tell
