fatlogic,fff0yus,t1_fff0oc4,1579872668.0,My best example for that will always be Bria Myles. Hips and ass curve like country backroads but her waist is tiny. Like US 4/6 tiny.

Your son has a lot of fights ahead of him. While using your words is ideal, don’t be afraid to let you son know that if they refuse to understand words, fists can work too. (I don’t mean fly off the handle. Just a three strike rule) That’s what I plan on teaching my son. You can’t always be an MLK. Sometimes you have to be a Malcolm X/Black Panther."
