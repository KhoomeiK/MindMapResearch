Games,feknsrw,t3_epmgzb,1579203906.0,"You know, it worried me at first because delays can be good or bad but it makes sense since they were talking about features they don't even know if they should add to the game and they were talking about that in September which would have been 8 months or so from the actual release date in April so I imagine this should be delay for the better."

It's like someone took NCIS, CSI, Bones, Criminal Minds, every other show like the ones listed and just fucking smashed it together with absurdity.

Edit: He said the guy's been unhireable for years, then some said it was 2 years, and I pointed it was bullshit and said he was in Kingdom Hearts 3 a year ago. Okay, I won't swear or something, I'm pointing out it's false.

Edit 2: Also you should talk about bringing up nonrelevant shit, man."

movies,fdpks4u,t1_fdpiuas,1578631360.0,"Kingdom Hearts 3 came out in January 19th. Again, no I don't but okay. The downvotes is pretty standard on Reddit. Work is still work, even if it's just a single video game.

Edit: I'm saying it's like those watchmojo videos where they say an actor is shunned by Hollywood, guy is probably taking a break, he did like 4 major movies in the last 4 years, one of which was the Emoji movie and even if it was utter fucking trash, boy is most likely set because every Facebook mom and dipshit dad took their kid to see it in existence.

Edit 2: Just don't make up your own facts, bro, that's like walking around saying Eddie Murphy is literally unhireable back in 2015. He's probably doing something else right now. Sorry if I came off like an asshole but come on."
