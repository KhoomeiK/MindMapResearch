PandR,ffwuznn,t1_ffw1ocr,1580311625.0,There’s just no way of knowing. Do you think they’re open?
scifi,ffwtrav,t1_ffwn52v,1580310804.0,"I always thought it was weird that Star Trek had a ship full of crewmen and then sent the Captain and First Officer into certain death situations. It just seems like really poor leadership. Real militaries keep the big wigs out of the actual combat.

It’s also hard to argue to logic of Star Wars when there is space magic running about the place.

I know this comment will get downvoted to the depths (to shreds you say?), but I really enjoyed StarWars and Star Trek (only watched the one with Picard who didn’t go into sketchy situations most of the time, but always sent the gallant Reichard)."

MTGLegacy,fftni3c,t1_ffthazc,1580224993.0,I thought mtg cards were less expensive in Japan than here. I always hear stories of people going over there for vacation or work and buying a bunch of cards to bring back. Maybe it’s only Japanese foils are cheaper there?
