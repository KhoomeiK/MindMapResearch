Yesterday I also received my Ned shirt I ordered December 1st. That was the fastest thing I've ever received from the site. I think it may have been because I messaged them over 5 times about my shirt because they weren't my answering questions, and when they did it was very vague. they were probably tired of me lol. the quality of the shirt really is not good... considering I paid $50 including shipping. it's rough. this whole situation is really disappointing.
