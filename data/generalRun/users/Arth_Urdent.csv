explainlikeimfive,ffu45cc,t3_euvpps,1580234098.0,"An interesting way to think about this is in terms of throughput optimized devices vs latency optimized devices.

**Latency** is how long a specific task takes from beginning to end

**Throughput** is how many of a task you can get through per time unit

Example: You have a washing machine and a tumbler that each run 1h. The latency to do one load of laundry is 2h since it will spend 1h in the washer and 1h in the tumbler. The troughput is 1load/h since you can put a new load into the washer while the previous one is in the tumbler. To increase your capacity you can add even more washers and tumblers. This increases your throughput but the latency for one load is still 2h. Reducing the latency on the other hand requires different measures. You could possibly wash a single piece of laundry quicker by hand and dry it with a hairdryer or so. This would minimize the latency of doing one piece of laundry but the throughput would be much lower.

In terms of computing devices both properties can be relevant. At the far latency optimized end of the spectrum you'd find DSPs and at the extreme throughput optimized end you have GPUs. CPUs fall somewhere in between as jack of all trades."

photography,ff845b0,t1_feyeti4,1579665496.0,"Minolta is essentially Sony now. After the Konica-Minolta merger they half-assed it for a bit and then transferred the camera business to Sony. The D7D and D5D were pretty competent cameras and were the first to have IBIS in 2004 but they didn't really release interesting lenses except for some rebadged Tamrons.

They then announced leaving the photography business and that ""some assets are transferred to Sony"". At the time the whole Minolta community was predictably upset and there was a lot of complaining about how Sony is not a ""proper camera maker"" and how everything will be just ""playstationified"". The few people pointing out that Sony makes professional broadcast and film equipment and collaborates with Zeiss were ignored in favor of drama and whining. And then Sony brought out cameras that were direct continuations of the Minolta (D)SLRs kept most of the good lenses from the Minolta line-up and added some pretty amazing Zeiss ones (such as the 135/1.8).

Fun fact: the Sony 16mm fisheye (SAL16F28) is possibly one of the oldest designs you can still buy new that isn't some ""historical reissue"" or so. The lens was mostly unchanged apart from cosmetics over the whole time the Minolta/Sony A-mount exists (1986 to now) and the optical formula is supposedly the one from the even older manual Minolta MC 16/2.8 fisheye (1969). I have a Minolta A and MC version and they certainly look and perform the same. Back then Minolta also built lenses for the Leica R system meaning the same optical formula also exists in the equivalent Fisheye Elmarit-R (1974).

Even the ""Alpha"" brand is a Minolta thing. Minolta had different branding per region. Dynax in Europe, Maxxum for NA and Alpha in Asia and Sony just ran with the Alpha brand for everything. The Sony Alpha DSLRs also clearly show their design heritage from late Minolta (D)SLRs forming a smooth link to the design of current Sony mirrorless and SLTs."

modular,felqfry,t1_fe9dwbo,1579228430.0,"I think the answer depends on how theoretical you want it to be and whether you mean that from a circuit design perspective which to me would imply that I'm also allowed to use capacitors and more opamps (which I need anyway to implement VCAs and FGs).

In either case I'd argue that one would have to break down the function generator into parts since it's not very ""fundamental"" from a circuit design perspective. A FG is essentially a slew limiter with some switching logic that is either a Schmitt trigger or some comparators and a flip flop. All of those with exception of the flipflop are basic opamp configurations. You could build almost anything else by having a function generator that separately exposes its building blocks. Some kind of even more granular Maths channel with comparators, integrator, flipflop and/or schmitt trigger exposed as separate parts but normaled to form a standard EG. With those and the variable gain from VCAs you can build almost anything:

**Triangle core VCO/LFO:** VCA + integrator + Schmitt trigger (+ optional comparator for square wave with PWM)

**Filter/LPG:** VCA + opamp in integrator configuration create a 1-pole low pass and you get steeper filters from cascading these. Another VCA can form a feedback path to add resonance. You'd get high pass elements by using a differentiator instead.

**Slew Limiter/AR envelope:** comparator + integrator (+ optionally add a VCA between to get voltage control over slew rate)

**EG:** this is where we get the parts from... we can use VCAs to add in voltage control

**S&H:** comparator + VCA + integrator. Its essentially just a slew limiter where you can set the slew rate to zero with the VCA which turns into a ""hold"". Also this wouldn't include a random source obviously.

**Any kind of ""time domain"" effects (echo, reverb, chorus etc.):** not really. Hypothetically you could implement a bucket brigade delay with an impractically long chain of S&Hs (as in thousands). And a reverb could be done with a very large amount of filters just below self resonance."
modular,felmsve,t1_fe9ixug,1579225926.0,">I'm not aware of a way to patch a mixer with a VCA and a function generator.

That kinda depends on what you consider the default implementation of a VCA? On the electronics level mixing inputs of one VCA or mixing the outputs of multiple VCAs is trivial.

If you use a SSM2164 (or equivalent) chip then you can literally just connect more signals to the input of the IC since it is a current in&out device. That gives you mixing capability at the cost of a resistor (+potentiometer for control) per input. On the output you need an inverting opamp buffer which is also a current summing device in this context so you can simply connect multiple VCA cells to the same output buffer.

Similar things apply to a LM13700 based design. Technically that is a voltage in current out device but since there is a massive voltage divider on the input of those designs (220/100k is common) the ease of implementing mixing on either the signal in or output are trivial for the same reasons as above.

Discrete gain cells in the form of variable base current long tailed pairs essentially behave similarily to the LM13700 case.

The first two (2164 & LM13700) are the by far most common implementations in modern modules.

Also just in general trying to ""recreate"" a mixer out of other building blocks is kinda pointless as it is one of the most trivial uses of an opamp and everything else will contain one or multiple opamps in practical designs. Specifically VCAs circuits will contain at least one and probably more opamps and EGs are almost guaranteed to contain more."

Even going to 1.2A I'd feel slightly uneasy to be honest.

Going slightly over the specs doesn't cause some sudden or catastrophic things to happen usually. The first thing you notice is that it might drop out of regulation meaning the regulator runs out of headroom to regulate to a constant voltage and you'll get significant ripple at mains frequencies.

Also you are exceeding the ratings of the components involved. Usually the RMS current in the transformer and the ripple current of the filter capacitors. They will probably ""work fine"" but get hotter than intended which shortens their lifetime. Eventually the regulators might also get too hot and their thermal protection might kick in.

The point is, going slightly over will ""work"" as in there probably won't be sudden catastrophic failure but you are taking an unnecessary risk and and are shortening the life of the components involved. Also it might work when you have fairly high/average mains voltage but when the mains voltage drops (different location, varying load due to time of day) the system might go haywire due excessive ripple from an undervolted regulator.

You can help along your intuition slightly by saying ""they are kinda sorta like probability distributions if you squint at them the right way"". But that doesn't mean those interpretations are a valid basis for reasoning. You have to stay within the formalism for it to stay meaningful.

If I know my scene is backlit or so I'll adjust exposure compensation for that and then spin the wheel until I'm at the desired aperture. I had to make the same amount of adjustments (two) as if I had explicitly controlled aperture and time.

A and S mode are almost equivalent to M in that the wheels control aperture or time and exposure compensation controls the other parameter for any given exposure.

SonyAlpha,fd2aian,t1_fd1yw8n,1578144282.0,"Following this discussion I got curious, I got out some of my older gear and learned the following:

1. holy crap the drive system on the modern FE lenses are smoother and quieter than my old A-mount lenses. Doesn't really matter whether I use them on my old A99 or on the different A7 cameras with the adapter. Even the 70-200 SSM is comparatively loud and jumpy. On the other hand some really ""ancient"" lenses like the 200/2.8HS that hail from the early AF era can be surprisingly quick if the AF finds a feature to grab on to. Continuous AF is abysmal though for all combinations.
2. Despite being a contrast detect AF the original A7 is surprisingly good and quick in decent lighting. It lacks all the cool features like lock-on tracking and eye AF. It also doesn't seem to do well in bad light. It will claim to have focused and then take a totally defocused image occasionally.
3. The big thing that makes the A7rII and the A7III impressive to me is the coverage of the entire frame with phase AF points. So both of them will happily focus anywhere in the frame even in fairly bad light. Maybe that only impresses me because I still compare that to the ""dark ages"" of (D)SLR just having 5-20 AF points crowded around the center of the frame.
4. A7rII and A7III mostly have the same features and capability I find (coverage, eye AF, lock on). The III does perform better but it feels very incremental to me. At least compared to the much larger steps when compared to 1. and 2.

All of the above obviously only applies to my use of these cameras. If the A7III were dramatically better at tracking F1 cars or so I wouldn't know because I never tried. So there may be big differences that just don't matter in my use cases."

For a long time I assumed that is what people said when they want to justify their purchase but couldn't find a more tangible positive. Surely between white balance, color profiles and raw editing the impact can't be that big? But then, what gets recorded in the raw data obviously depends on the properties of the Bayer filter and the properties of the lens. Just how that is related to to the final product or how much that limits or enables the range of editing is hard to quantify."

So if someone were to just take my Gerbers and start manufacturing/selling them or was printing my schematics in a book without redrawing them then any licensing would still apply, right?

videography,fcwmdhn,t1_fcwk7k2,1578029713.0,"It makes sense that the less ""information"" is in the image the higher the compression will be.

videography,fcwlja2,t1_fcuxbbp,1578028998.0,">I'm assuming you don't have EF lenses, it's unfortunate because it's the popular lens type.

That is probably where part of my confusion stems from. Maybe the assumption of these discussions is that every videographer has a bunch of EF lenses anyway?

I started out as a Minolta (A mount) user for photography which eventually turned into the Sony A mount and then it seemed natural to transition into FE mount as it was the first full frame system that could adapt my vintage lenses (Contax & Rokkors) without a crop factor and had first party adapters for A mount. And Sony obviously does well enough for my enthusiast video purposes when it comes to cameras. They do everything I could desire except maybe 10+bit (and that can only be a matter of time).

For the above reasons the Sigma FP seemed like an interesting camera to at least look into since it could potentially adapt everything but the FE lenses. But I found myself surprised by the utter indifference reviewers and online discussions seem to have towards it. Yet apparently everyone is happy to jump on the BMPCC4k ""bandwagon"" which has a sensor format that turns almost every preexisting vintage/SLR lens into a tele. You'd think that going by how much people are in love with FF and higher bit depths by themselves there would be more enthusiasm for the intersection?"
videography,fcwjqkx,t1_fcwijbl,1578027501.0,"Most video codecs (certainly the H.264 the Sony camera uses) at their core don't really have a bit rate setting but rather a quality setting determining quantization matrices, block sizes etc.. But there is always an entropy coding step at the end the compression ratio of which you only know after actually compressing. The resulting bit rate depends on the quality setting as well as the actual content. So by selecting a bit rate you are either selecting a quality that should hit that bit rate on average or you select a ""steering scheme"" that adjusts quality on the fly depending on the previous frames to stay at a certain average bit rate. The result of either method isn't an exact bit rate as you observed."

videography,fctexc2,t3_ehepd9,1577941080.0,"I'm confused why in videography people are so often discussing cameras in a vacuum independent of accessories and especially lenses. This comes up now for me as I was trying to figure out why the Sigma FP seems to be mostly ignored despite seemingly ticking a lot of boxes. Particularly it's one of the few mirrorless devices that does both 12bit recording and is full frame. But I read a bunch of discussions that seem to dismiss it for reasons like ""it's too expensive as compared to a BMPCC4K and who really needs that little extra low light you get from the full frame"". This is very surprising to me since the main reason why I would want FF is that I have a sizable lens collection from close to two decades of being a photography enthusiast. So the BMPCC4k is almost instantly out since it turns all my preexisting lenses into teles and the 6k is out due to most of these lenses not being mechanically adaptable to a EF mount. So really FF mirrorless isn't about image quality or low lights. It's about lens compatibility for me.

I guess I'm almost considering cameras as accessories to lenses instead of the other way around. But maybe that is weird and most people just own the camera de jour and are happy to shuffle around their lens collection frequently? But that would still surprise me since that messes with any bang for buck argument. Pointing out that a BMPCC4k is a great deal by itself becomes much less of an argument if I now have to buy MFT lenses or speedboosters, neither of which are cheap."
