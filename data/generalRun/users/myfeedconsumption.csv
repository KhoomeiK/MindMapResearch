This is why:

* High functioning ASD's unemployment rate is literally 90%. Neurotypical unemployment rate is 3% and other mental illnesses' general unemployment rate is only around 20\~25%. This is because of extreme discrimination by neurotypicals against autistic people. 90% unemployment is extremely brutal and pretty much guarantees an autistic person a life devoid of achievement.
* ASD life expectancy is only 35 because of the stress of trying to be normal (comparable to gay conversion therapy) and because of the suicide rate. Neurotypical life expectancy is somewhere around 80.
* ASD suicide rate is already 10x\~15x the neurotypical suicide rate, even though ASD people are only 1% of the population and non-ASD are 99%.
* 2/3 of ASD men go from birth to death without even one single romantic relationship.
* Around half of ASD men have no friends.

>Perhaps you have already stained your reputation, so that you are prevented from establishing a new one. In such cases it is wise to associate with someone whose image counteracts your own, using their good name to whitewash and elevate yours. It is hard, for example, to erase a reputation for dishonesty by yourself; but a paragon of honesty can help. When P. T. Barnum wanted to clean up a reputation for promoting vulgar entertainment, he brought the singer Jenny Lind over from Europe. She had a stellar, high-class reputation, and the American tour Barnum sponsored for her greatly enhanced his own image. Similarly the great robber barons of nineteenth-century America were long unable to rid themselves of a reputation for cruelty and mean-spirit. Only when they began collecting art, so that the names of Morgan and Frick became permanently associated with those of da Vinci and Rembrandt, were they able to soften their unpleasant image."
