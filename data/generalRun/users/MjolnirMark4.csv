One of the more scary cases I know of was a guy that was driving down the interstate, and he decided to kill some random woman who was going in to a rest stop.  He followed her in, and killed her.  But, since he decided to do this crime on a whim, he was only gotten on second degree murder.  It wasn’t classified as premeditation since had not planned on killing her, and in fact didn’t even know her."

A side effect of this is that when he clocks in to work, his work time will go faster.

Heavy Air is extremely dangerous.  During WW2, both sides experimented with adding heavy air to bombs to increase the conclusive force of the bombs.  While no where near as powerful as nuclear bombs, heavy air bombs could increase the effectiveness of a 2000 pound bomb ten fold.

The testing was haulted when it was discovered that that any leaks in the bombs would cause the plane to crash due to the sudden shift in air pressure.
