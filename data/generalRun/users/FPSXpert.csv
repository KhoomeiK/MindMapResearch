Firearms,fewzb8g,t3_eq9djn,1579421792.0,"Do better. Download Firechat and I'm Being Arrested. 
 
Firechat requires making an account beforehand. It let's you communicate short range or long range via Bluetooth and radio signal pairings. The more phones nearby the stronger the signal. Doing this has been proven to bypass censorship in authoritan hellholes like Hong Kong and China during governmental massacres. Basically these communist governments would shut down cell towers during protests and it wouldn't matter, with hundreds using the app they could still get live messaging in and out. 
 
I'm being arrested requires setup beforehand. You add contacts and a general message and enable location. One click on the app and it will send a message to contacts that you've been arrested, location, maybe audio footage, etc. Really good app for accountability. 
 
If ACLU has an app for Virginia also download it. You can record police brutality, and as soon as the phone is turned off or you hit stop recording it auto uploads the footage to ACLU servers so not a damn dirty soul can wipe the footage. 
 
Get this message out there to everyone so people know of these apps. These are tools essential to democracy and apps are harder to ban than firearms. 
 
If you have an android device, lookup how to download and install APK files. Consider loading these apk's for these apps onto a flash drive or another way to install them onto phones in person outside of internet download. There's an idea, ""freedom kits"".
