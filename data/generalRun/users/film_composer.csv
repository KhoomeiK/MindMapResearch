todayilearned,ffpoetw,t3_eucepz,1580100297.0,"Am I wrong, or didn't MJ have a relatively bad work ethic (relative to Kobe, anyway)? He had an absolute killer instinct and a ruthless competitive side, all of the natural talent in the world, and obviously a lot of work was taken to get to his point of being the undisputed best of all time, and when he was on the court, he clearly worked as hard as any human being possibly could. And it's obvious that he put in the work at the gym and never let himself go physically when he was with the Bulls. So this is all with the caveat of being relative... He would also stay up until 3am drinking and gambling the night before important games. He clearly had quite a lot of self-imposed distractions off the court. He enjoyed and exploited his fame, and that's all good. It obviously never stopped him from being the all-time greatest. It's just that saying that he had the second best work ethic behind Kobe seems pretty insulting to all of the other players that  worked a LOT harder off the court than MJ did and just didn't have the natural talent or good circumstances he had to capitalize on it.

Let's put it this way: I've never known anyone to ever work as hard at their craft as Kobe did. He was fucking OBSESSED. Jordan putting himself even close to Kobe's work ethic is really fucking insulting to Kobe, and that has less to do with Jordan and more to do with Kobe. He was on another plane of existence with how much he wanted to be the best and how hard he had to work for it. Jordan didn't work even half as hard as Kobe did—but clearly he also didn't need to."
politics,ffplru5,t1_ffpg296,1580098210.0,"I guess that, in the end, if Paul Ryan, Jeff Sessions, John Bolton, Michael Cohen, and others are excommunicated from their party for obviously false reasons of ""working for the left,"" it isn't the worst outcome for the sane world. I would be happy to have Bolton painted as some sort of leftist—it's not as though the left will actually accept any of these people as being on the side of the Democrats. Being hated by both sides seems like a pretty tough thing to recover from politically.

Jeff Flake, John Kasich, Bob Corker, and other Republicans who clearly legitimately hate Trump did the smart thing by dipping out while they could. Flake in particular read the room and sees he now has middle-ground credibility to run for president in 2024. Of course, that's it's own breed of bullshit, but at least it's a breed that makes sense. Bolton is done for. The Republicans will never want to work with him again after this, and he obviously isn't a Democrat, so he has no home anywhere."

But I do think that there have been some instances where an account will have been found after, say, the Super Bowl, to have posted a really uncanny prediction (down to the teams and the score) before the season even started. At least some of those I feel like are set up in reverse, where someone will have created hundreds of private fake accounts, mass-posted via bot the same generic set of tweets to look legitimate, and then posted different teams and scores for a prediction. When it turns out that that one of the accounts had an ""eerily accurate"" prediction of the score, they'll point it out and the Internet will eat it up, none the wiser that the same person used bots to create a ton of other accounts with other predictions that were, of course, way off track.

The Democrats would get slaughtered at the polls in November and be back to having control of literally no branch of the government.

politics,fem8my5,t1_felogzr,1579243771.0,"Whether this theory is true or not, I always have wondered why there aren't more situations like this—at least, that we know of. You would think that as a presidential-tier politician, the most effective way to help a fellow candidate win a primary election isn't by being an advocate or endorser of that candidate, but by purposefully playing the spoiler role in their favor. If Pete wanted Bernie to win, his campaign is exactly what Bernie could have hoped for: a younger, more articulate, less baggaged, Christian, centrist alternative to Biden that a lot of people could be excited about. Warren could, in theory, be playing that role to Bernie's detriment in hopes that Biden will get elected. And both Pete and Warren may be hoping that they're lined up for a VP spot if they're successful at spoiling Biden/Bernie's chances.

That's not to say that all four of them don't have sincere presidential ambitions, but the idea of secretly playing for one side of the party while pretending to be for the other seems like it surely would be effective, and probably happens more than we know about.

Taking it a step further, I wonder how often there have been Democrats going their whole careers playing the role of a Republican (and vice-versa) for the purpose of sabotaging the other party, gaining insider knowledge to share with their true party, running for elections with the intention of winning the primary but losing the general election, etc. It would take quite a bit of dedication to pull off, but I think surely it has happened."

I actually have wondered about this before. The president gets to choose his cabinet members, and apparently can fire them at will (which I wouldn't have thought would be a thing, but thanks for teaching me something new, Trump). So president Biden chooses all Republicans for his cabinet, all of whom are current Senators—specifically ones that are in states where their replacement would be either selected by a Democratic governor, or be voted on in a special election. The still-Republican-majority Senate says ""oh hell yes"" to a Republican cabinet and approves them all. Then Biden fires them all and repicks Democratic cabinet members with what's now a Democratically controlled Senate. Basically, the same series of events that led from Jeff Sessions being replaced by Doug Jones, but on a larger scale.  What stops a president from doing this? It seems like a comically childish trick-play strategy that there are clearly protections against, but I wonder what those are.
