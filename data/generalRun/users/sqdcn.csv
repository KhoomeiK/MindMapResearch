pcmasterrace,fea9ln1,t1_fe9za60,1578945987.0,"Exactly the weakness of 2080ti. So there are two use cases for GPU in machine learning: 1. you just want the most flop out of your budget, this is when people buy a bunch of 2070 instead of fewer 2080ti, and 2. your model is huge and you really want to fit it into the memory. This case is rarer and it is where you go for a real Titan with gigantic VRAM, while 2080ti's memory is too small.

My point being the ml/hpc people don't actually buy a lot of 2080ti compared to say 2070, and are probably not responsible for the price. I can't speak for rendering farms though, they may have their use cases with RTX."
pcmasterrace,fe9slj7,t1_fe9acmd,1578941106.0,"For quick prototyping on your workstation before pushing to the cluster, 2080ti is fine. Otherwise, 2080ti has terrible flops per dollar and not enough VRAM to fit in large models like Titans."
