AmItheAsshole,fgsxk6m,t1_fgsobe9,1581094731.0,"I think this changes my mind on the subject.  I was in the ""adult sleepovers are weird"" camp.  Obviously if there's some ~~pretext~~ (edit: context/reason) it's fine. Getting drunk and crashing at a buddy's house, you are flying out somewhere together and want to drive to the airport in the morning, driving to work early, etc.  It's more for practical purposes than ""let's have a sleepover just for fun.""

Back to you though - even if you had Uber, there's nothing weird about what you do and that's basically just for fun.  Whether it's because of drinking or just because people don't want to drive home at 3 am, and you all want to grab brunch.  That doesn't seem weird to me.

There are a lot of differences between your situation and the story of course.  Everything about OP's story is shady as hell.  It's different when it's just two people imo.

Before you get gastric bypass, doctors will make you lose weight.  That makes the surgery easier but it's also to prove that you can reduce the amount of food you eat.  So once you have the surgery you aren't complete f'ed when you can't control the food going in your mouth.  The catch-22 is that the doctor says ""Ok lose 50 lb and you can get surgery.  Ok, now do 75 more lb.""  If you don't... you don't get the surgery.  If you do... the doctor says ""Good job, keep doing that and losing weight, you don't need gastric bypass, lol."""

Basically, don't trigger it until you see someone close.  On the radar of course, but preferably actually see them for a second.   If they get the jump on you, don't trigger it with super low health (unless you really need that one kill).

Golden Gun for Hunters doesn't seem to give much extra resilience so give a huge berth before triggering that.
