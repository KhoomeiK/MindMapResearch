Most of the cancer patients I've met only get single ports, but mine is a double. My oncologist said he likes the doubles because nurses can adminster the chemo drugs through one side and my premeds and fluids to protect my kidneys/organs and keep me hydrated through the other side.

CasualConversation,ffhsucs,t3_etl08d,1579952131.0,"1.) Write her a real letter on actual paper saying how you feel and listing all the things you love about her and why you are thankful for her. No one writes letters anymore so it will mean something and get noticed.  
2.) Try to encourage her to focus on the future in a positive way instead of getting weighed down by her past regrets/trauma. Maybe mention fun things you want to do with her when she is done with treatment, maybe a trip or concert or cool activity. **Give her something to look forward to.** Maybe encourage her to make a detailed bucket list. If she has goals for the future it will help.  
3.) Lastly, gratitude is incredibly powerful. Bit by bit, over time, it can help heal depression and transform attitudes. Taking time every day to make a mental list of everything you are thankful for is one of the best things you can do for your mental health. When I was diagnosed with cancer (this was about 7 months ago) a friend gave me a set of what she called ""Greek worry beads"" (basically just a bunch of beads on a chain similar to catholic rosary beads, also used by some eastern religions/spiritualists to keep track of how many times they repeat their meditations/mantras). Worrying is a pointless activity, so I call them my ""blessing beads"" instead of ""worry beads"" (yeah I know how cheesy and dumb it sounds). Anyway, I used them while waiting at doctors appointments or in the car to count off all the things I'm grateful for. Those things can be big (family, friends), little (sun is out today, got a compliment on my outfit), practical (clean water to drink, roof over head), or downright goofy (watched a funny cat video that made me smile). It really does work. Not overnight. But like how a constant drip of water on a rock can smooth its surface."

They might even be doing astrophotography and taking pics of the stars or pics of the city lights. Sometimes with night time shots you have to take multiple shots with different shutter speeds and apertures and layer then in photoshop to get the exposure right on different subjects. Some professional night time city/street scape pics are actually 4 or 5 different photos layered. Photographing the brighter street lights is different setting from, stars, wet pavement, and dimmer lights.

Also, you should not be hearing about your compensation from a co-worker. The boss should tell you directly if something is unpaid. And if training is unpaid they should have told you at interview and/or before they hired you. That's not professional.

Supposedly most of the old roman statues were originally painted like this, but the paint has all worn off which is why they all just look white/natural stone. So if you'd gone to a Roman (correction: Greek) temple back in the day the statues would have all been tacky colors."

Some of these Facebook support groups are surprisingly well informed and good resources, Reddit really doesn't have anything like it (no subs at all for my type of cancer). Haven't been genetically tested myself yet. My kind of cancer is rare, like less than a fraction of 1% rare. But thankfully we caught it in time. I *only* needed three surgeries, five blood transfusions, intensive chemo, and 5 weeks of radiation. Just got the results of my most recent CT scan today and I'm clear at the moment (hooray! my cancer has high recurrence rate so I have to keep getting screened)."

Day. Of. Class. I hadn't done anything wrong. Not only that, if he had bothered to look at my records he would have seen that I was a straight A student with no disciplinary issues whatsoever. And in fact my brothers really weren't that bad, average students and not really troublemakers. I was sooo pissed for being judged unfairly. I hated him from that day on. Later in the year he tried to be friendly with me and get me to volunteer to help with stuff, I barely spoke to him. He had totally lost my respect day one and there was no getting it back."
