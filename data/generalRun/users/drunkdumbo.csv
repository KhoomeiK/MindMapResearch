What else are you growing under those lights? I am curious how large of a growing area you are handling with the \~1200W setup!"
woodworking,ffimlqu,t1_ffhy662,1579977494.0,just don't expect it *not* to be one big mess afterwords!
DIY,ffhye3s,t1_ffhx1kd,1579959194.0,I thought the water softener was disabled? Is it just off?
woodworking,ffg8kq0,t3_etc4z1,1579900790.0,Any tips for sourcing epoxy? Local brick and mortar seems really expensive but not sure if online is worth the risk for a random brand... Looks great!
gardening,ffchbs8,t1_ffc3gxw,1579799466.0,"Not sure about u/lyly1976 but I usually just add a few drops of liquid soap to a spray bottle, then spray the plants--making sure to get the underside of the leaves where the pests like to hang out.

I've had a tendency to stop treatment too early--even if it looks drastically improved or maybe you cannot even see any, keep applying for an extra week or so! (at least that's what I do now)"
sousvide,ffcfdkk,t3_esvefs,1579798268.0,"Aside from temperature fluctuations (which are usually quite substantial) you're also missing a key component of heat transfer. If you're trying this, you should at least keep your meat submerged in a water bath. Water will transfer heat into your food much more evenly and quickly than air.

Also, one of my last ovens was a very nice Viking brand. Even set at 200F, there would be fluctuations to reach temps \~245-250F. That margin of error eliminates much of the benefits to sous vide. Then you're slow cooking or reverse searing...not a bad thing, but definitely not the same effect as sous vide!"

Aquariums,ff7rhpe,t3_es3zch,1579656588.0,This is way more on my level than most of the posts around! How long has this tank been together?
Aquariums,fekk72b,t3_epmqrz,1579201766.0,"A complaint that I have is that sometimes it seems when buying plants and other materials for scapes, the stock photo is very different from the actual product delivered. The plants can be a disappointment because they never look like the sample photos--so maybe be real transparent about the items that differ from unit to unit"

Coffee,fekgtzm,t3_epn32n,1579199758.0,"Are you going off of instructions you read somewhere?

One day is not going to extract everything from a whole bean....most cold brew processes require a corse grind.

Also, I've found the temperature is very important. Did you say it is sitting on your desk?"
Coffee,fek8rqu,t3_epju67,1579194975.0,"So this is going to be a super unpopular opinion in this community, but oh well.

I had the exact same intro story--went to Italy on our honeymoon, fell in love with cappuccinos and lattes. I am usually more of a black coffee/pour-over fan.

We bought one of those SUPER cheap Mr Coffee machines that steams brews ""espresso"" and has a steam wand. After some trial and error, you can actually make some decent beverages in it. Granted, I've never owned a proper setup myself, but I have drank enough lattes /espresso to differentiate between ""crap"" and something decent. For a $35 investment, maybe you'd want to confirm that making espresso at home is something you're into? These machines get a terrible wrap, but isn't the brew going to be similar to other steam-driven processes like a moka pot?"
smoking,fehn84v,t1_fehladf,1579119967.0,"That's nice of you to even consider that--I'll seek some out one of these days.

And cool, sounds like an awesome experiment. If anything is too hot, I'll happily take them off your hands! I've been messing around with fermentation, smoking, dehydrating, and combinations of those. I grow at least a couple Carolina Reapers each year, but never eat them plain."
smoking,fehkjdf,t1_fehjnp9,1579118414.0,"I've never had them, nor do I know where to even procure them. What got you started on that variety? I'm all about hot sauces /spice blends/etc and always willing to try out a new pepper variety"
smoking,fehinuw,t1_feh6d5r,1579117322.0,"How fun. I've never cross pollinated my own. Scotch Bonnets are my usual favorite, though I also like Thai red hot varieties for cooking. Checking out the Instagram"
smoking,fehg2i2,t1_fehcw3n,1579115803.0,Oooops thanks. I'd like to think that was a mobile device oversight
smoking,feh2pb5,t1_feh2mhg,1579107901.0,PS I'm a chili growing hobbyist in MI too! Favorite pepper variety?
smoking,feh2mhg,t1_feh23c0,1579107853.0,"I really like using dry mustard in rubs.

Honestly though for fine-tuning flavors I think the wood has almost as much to do with it! I'm a huge fan of pecan...when people ask for my recipes that's usually the component they don't reproduce properly. Obviously you're mindful of it if you vary your wood based on the phase of the cook!"
sousvide,feh2f6k,t3_ep2wqp,1579107729.0,"Eh, for $70 I'm not sold this is a great 'investment'.

I grabbed a 16 quart container from the kitchen supply store with a lid for <$20 that is rated food safe up to 220F. Unless I'm missing something, from a cost perspective, I'll stick to those!"
smoking,feh1qhr,t1_feh12gn,1579107325.0,"ironically, it is the cinnamon flavor i'm not a fan of! Otherwise, the other 4 spices are great. Ribs looks delicious"

If you're curious, read up on thermal death rate: [https://wiki.ubc.ca/Course:FNH200/Lesson\_06](https://wiki.ubc.ca/Course:FNH200/Lesson_06)

Lower temps can be used as long as it has reached that temperature for a sufficient amount of time. Not sure exactly what the cut-off would be, but your original comment just sounds like hyperbole"
sousvide,fdonfhj,t1_fdnuc5p,1578608716.0,Even briefly in the fridge  buys more flexibility when searing. Also patting dry...the extra moisture is a sear-killer.

todayilearned,fcxhigz,t3_ejg39v,1578063066.0,"As a past Buick owner I find this very hard to believe. My first new car I bought myself was a 2012 Buick Verano. Even when maintaining it properly, the engine could not even make it to 85,000 miles. I was told I'd need about $6500 in repairs, and three Buick dealerships I went to were absolute nightmares. Turns out there were known issues with the car--never any recalls issued. I had to put in a quart of oil every couple of weeks because they engine ran so hot. I know they are trying to improve their branding, but I will no longer consider purchasing any Buicks. 

Rant over, but yeah, really skeptical of this report."
