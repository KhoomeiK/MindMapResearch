So the answer is of course situational. I think the standard answer is yes, start on time. Is your boss’s boss attending and is a little late? Yeah, you may want to wait. Is your boss’s boss attending and they have a meeting that starts in exactly a half hour and you have exactly a half hour of content cover? Yes, start on time; they will likely appreciate you looking out for their schedule. 

Your time is no more important than someone else’s. Starting on time says that, and delaying the meeting says that as well. IT’S CASE BY CASE."
