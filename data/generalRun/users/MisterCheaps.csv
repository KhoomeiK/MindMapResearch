pacers,ff9big0,t1_ff99bm3,1579709189.0,"That’s the difference in score between the two teams that you’re betting on. So take for example you bet on the Nuggets at -1.5. If you subtract the Nuggets final score from the Pacers score and it’s 1.5 or greater, you win the bet. (So in practice, if the Nuggets win by two or more you win.) If the Nuggets win by less than 1.5 or if the Pacers win, you’d lose the bet. The bigger the negative number, the bigger the favorite they are. If a team was at -15, you’d need them to win by 15 or more, otherwise you lose the bet."

She’s honestly the 2nd or 3rd best candidate in the race, even if I lost a lot of respect for her after the last debate. It’s that they a.) couldn’t even pick one candidate, and b.) picked Klobuchar, the most right-leaning, bland, unlikeable candidate on the stage."

not your personal google, so you can search yourself if you’re that interested to prove me wrong. However, it’s a well known and accepted fact in the United States that women tend to vote Democratic and men tend to vote Republican. There have been multiple studies and articles analyzing the gender gap in American politics. I’m sorry if that doesn’t fit your narrative, but sometimes facts can be hard."
