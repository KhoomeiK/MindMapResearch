Your "" friend"" is not a very kind person. Find better friends for yourself."

Meditation can be super helpful.

Best wishes, and good luck."
offmychest,fekn1sl,t3_epnmbv,1579203460.0,"You can do this. Do one day at a time, if it's a bad day, just do an hour at a time.

Practise slow controlled breathing when you feel anxious/hyper alert. Go through your senses to reset your brain

eg I can *see* my kettle,

I can *hear* the music on the radio,

I can *touch* the door to my flat

I can *smell* the soap in my bathroom

I can *taste* the coffee I've just made.


Exercise regulary, whether at a gym, or walking/jogging.

Get counselling. Some charities offer it for free in UK

Remind yourself of how far you've come and that you're doing better. 

Good luck, and be kind to yourself."
