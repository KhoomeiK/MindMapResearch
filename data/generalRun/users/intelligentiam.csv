AskNYC,felzykk,t1_feltzzk,1579235389.0,That’s so great. I adore that place in summer with the awnings in the back.
AskNYC,felpriz,t1_felmoul,1579227963.0,"I love threes! We go to threes every other week, I threw my best friend’s 30th birthday party there. I suggested to my GF that we do our wedding there in the summer. Do people do weddings there?"

LifeProTips,fc7svea,t3_egksoc,1577517774.0,How many people had to look up what a chevron is
AskNYC,fbdroel,t3_ech5g7,1576769785.0,"I’ve worked in advertising for 6 years, but I got my start in LA where I’m from. The environments I’ve worked in have varied, but overall I’ve had a much better time of it here in NYC than in LA. I’d never describe it as cut-throat, but people appear to me to be more driven in NYC. It’s also easier to make friends with everyone just taking the subway home pretty quickly, rather than sitting in traffic. So we oftentimes go out to a bar or a restaurant and get to know each other and no matter how late it is the subway takes you home quickly. This isn’t a very informative comment but my take is: it’ll be fine, New York is great, lots of opportunities for growth, my life improved dramatically after getting to New York. 

First couple of months might be tough - getting used to the neighborhoods, trains, new people, new life. But after that it only gets better."
