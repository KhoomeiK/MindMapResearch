unpopularopinion,fc9s0rm,t3_egtsdw,1577557343.0,"Some houses are shit because the owner or contractor tried to cut costs. Vinyl siding is not a cheap ineffective product though, it's cheap and durable and installs easily, so it saves money on installation time and maintenance, siding didn't replace brick really it more replaced clapboard and other systems that needed to be repainted and maintained more regularly. Do you really think a quarter inch difference in a 2x4 makes a huge difference in quality? If so I'm not sure you know what you're talking about. Also I don't know much about 50s brick ranchers but I do know that a lot of brick you see on houses is just a fa√ßade used to make it look more expensive."
