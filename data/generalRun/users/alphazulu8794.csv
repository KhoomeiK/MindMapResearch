reactiongifs,fdb5xbn,t1_fdaoe35,1578254155.0,"If you think this is the first military action we've taken against Iran, you really haven't been paying attention.

Last year, on top of killing several thousand Lebanese people, the also killed thousands of protesters in their country. They also shot down a US drone, and sank several merchant ships outside their jurisdiction, until the US and UK royal navy started following their ships and maintaining a presence in the area. 

They have held Americans hostage.

This General also HAS been fighting us, via terror groups, backed by..... Iran! 


We have been at a proxy war for decades. This General died meeting the Hezbollah leader, both of them orchestrated the attack on the Iraq Embassy. Intelligence Agencies have said they had reasons to believe they were planning additional attacks, and were ready to start attacking in earnest."

The leader of that group and this General were in a car, and we blew it up. Official reports from the Pentagon state that they were plotting several attacks on the US assets and people. 

We basically got Osama Bin Laden and Saddam in the same car, quick and easy. And yes, drone strikes were the way to go. Would you rather us risk American lives trying to attack them directly and potentially lose them? Or we hit a button and one terror group loses it highest leader, and a genocidal general who has been tied to several terror groups from Hamas to Hezbollah dies?"

TheRealJoke,fcol509,t1_fcofjpd,1577834977.0,"The problem is, America has land borders, with very gun happy neighbors. We also have a lot of unregistered guns. So a gun ban is impossible. Second, our history is that we rose up against tyranny with our guns. I am decently left wing, and now is the time to have the most guns for America, as the president keeps testing the waters on overstaying his term. Beyond that, in our country, the places with the harshest gun control(Chicago, Baltimore, LA, St. Louis) are the placest with the most gun violence, while highly armed places(Dallas, Knoxville, San Antonio) have low gun violence, and no mass shooting/gang violence. Because ""would be"" attackers know what awaits them if they try. They will end up like the Dallas shooter, killed before he can get a single fatality. Or the recent church shooter, killed in under 20 seconds.

Meanwhile, the recent shooting in Germany was done with a home made pistol. NYC and a college in Ohio have had mass stabbings, and had to wait on first responders. 

The comic rings some truth. If someone wants to be a terrorist, they will. Be it an IED, car bomb, Gun, knife, or van. I say give people the chance to fight back. I know how to use my handgun well.
