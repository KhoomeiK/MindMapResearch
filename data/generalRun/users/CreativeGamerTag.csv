AmItheAsshole,fd0l52c,t1_fd0ivcg,1578120396.0,"Short answer: yes. It did. 

Long answer, if you’re curious:

2016 was a Very Bad Year. My boyfriend (now husband) had a skiing accident and almost died, my brother had major surgery (open heart, replaced a valve and his whole ascending aorta), my condo flooded (and took four months of jumping through red tape and dealing with useless building managers to get repaired), my MIL was quite sick and nobody could figure out why, and then my Gran died. To top it all off, I was working for a toxic narcissist who made my life at work absolute hell.

I’d had a few depressive episodes in my life, but 2016 (and I do not say this to exaggerate) nearly killed me. 2017 started and I was miserable. But I was doing that thing people do where it’s like “boyfriend is ok, MIL is ok, condo is fixed, etc. so I need to just move on.” But I couldn’t move on. I was weepy all the time, couldn’t remember the last time I slept through the night, my productivity at home and at work was suffering horrendously...and all I did was beat myself up for it. The negative self talk was very real, and incredibly damaging.

Therapy helped me understand and accept that what I’d been through was legitimate trauma, and helped me work through it. It taught me some techniques for getting things done (five minute rule: start something, and say you’ll do it for five minutes. If, at the end of those minutes, you just can’t anymore, you can stop. But once you’ve started it’s really easy to keep going). It helped me address and work through some stuff from longer ago that I thought I’d left behind. And it helped me figure out how to manage things going forward so I didn’t become so overwhelmed by the shit life can throw at you.

I am not currently in therapy anymore, but I know it’s there and a reliable option should I ever find myself in need.

The Prozac helped immensely as well."
