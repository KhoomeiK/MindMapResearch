Instagramreality,fgjy5vo,t1_fgiwf94,1580853690.0,"Look up some of those ""beauty standards through the ages"" charts and just see how it changes. Waif to thicc, pageboy hairdos to long natural hair, lots of make up or very little makeup. I recommend getting a look that suits your body type/style/face shape and just going with it. People would be much happier that way."

insanepeoplefacebook,fg47qxv,t1_fg4746g,1580497932.0,This is also true. At the very least it is an interesting peek into the minds of lunatics without actually having to speak to one.

Something? Shatter maybe, or amplify the sound waves in some way?"
funny,fg194cb,t1_fg0xhlg,1580423024.0,"You joke, but technically everything is vibrating at some frequency, right? So of you did an experiment (like a crystal glass shattering at a certain pitch) could you actually determine the frequency of that stone? This is assuming that a crystal glass does actually shatter at a certain pitch and that isn't just something I've seen in movies."
reptiles,ffzz8gk,t1_ffzyirm,1580396616.0,"I see him every few days, but he is very fast. I don't want to hurt him trying to catch him. He sits in the sun in the moss on an orchid I have in the window. As far as the glass in that window, they're old single pane glass with no UV protection. I agree he should be outside but I don't know how to get him there"

And I know it flooded a couple times at least last summer with all the rain. The restaurant is unfortunately at ground level, which at the beach isn't really the best idea. It was a landmark, but there is a lot of competition down there now."

Is there something wrong with baking soda paste with a drop or two of food grade mint oil? It's cheap, it's effective, and you make it at home.

If we are being for real, though, I feel even worse for the ones who don't live long enough (or stress free enough) to really show out.

Some homes I go into the people want $100k worth of work, thinking it costs closer to $30k, oh and I needs to be done in 3 weeks.

The Anne Hathaway part is good romcom material, and then Meryl Streep comes along and is just in a totally different, much better movie that just seems to be happening along side a romantic comedy.

I always thought of them as like a limey cross between green beans and asparagus. When you get one fresh, scale it like a fish to get the needles off, then soak in warm water with a little white vinegar and salt in it. Rinse off, par boil, drain and Pat dry. Cook in a skillet with a little oil, onion jalapeno and tomato. And at like 60 calories a cup it's the beeeeeest."
