ChinaTime,fesal1n,t3_drxija,1579363273.0,"I know your post is a little old, and I'm not sure if you've found what you're looking for.  You were looking for a 'single red' Sea Dweller with a super dome.  I've found a double red Sea Dweller with what looks like a super dome.  Might be interested, and it's from a pretty trusted seller here michaeltravis.

Watches,feohms7,t3_eq1jpv,1579300326.0,"Such a classic look, I almost thought it was a new model.  Probably one of the sexiest dials I've seen on a Rolex and that says a lot.  Wear it in good health!"
Washington,fenjpz4,t3_eq05ex,1579286165.0,Happy to have ya! Hope you enjoyed WA!

ChinaTime,feiuxkc,t3_eog581,1579147890.0,Do you remember the dimensions?  She's looking thick!
ChinaTime,feiusou,t3_eoqx13,1579147786.0,I'd go with a JLC Reverso or a Cartier Tank.  G Shock seems too obvious but not ridiculous enough.  Maybe get him a little NATO to avoid the clasp or buckle catching on anything and coming off.
ChinaTime,feitwwo,t1_fehseon,1579147109.0,"The duality of the gen is funny.  Supreme did a 20 piece run at $50k each.  It's both for watch snobs, and a finger up to them."
ChinaTime,feitox5,t3_ep8f9h,1579146941.0,Looks pretty close to Noob Factory version. ( https://noobfactorywatches.shop/product/supreme-x-rolex-fuck-em-114060-submariner/ ).
Watches,feitbtr,t3_ep5jnp,1579146671.0,"And what a combo! I love the snowflake, but this is probably closer to a GS I'd actually pick up.  Knocked it out of the park here Sir."
