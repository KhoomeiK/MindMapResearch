dataisbeautiful,ffq8deo,t3_eufzmx,1580125709.0,"This is assuming an R0 of what, 1.5824 or something? Where the hell did you come up with that number? Coronavirus has an R0 of somewhere between 1.4 and 2.5. You're way off the mark. And this also assumes that every person who gets sick only comes into contact with other people who aren't sick yet. That is most definitely NOT the case in Wuhan right now."
apexlegends,ffq7wzu,t1_ffq0kze,1580125123.0,"Not only that, every other game just feels...slow. Fortnite is a great example of this. It takes me at least an hour or two to get back into Fortnite mode because I feel like I'm walking underwater when I come out of playing Apex."

Their black beans are fucking awesome. Black beans, onions, pico, cheese, and sour cream - take those ingredients and make any burrito you want, and you can't go wrong."

longrange,ffq77mz,t1_ffpkbdk,1580124158.0,Seriously? .300 PRC is a known quantity by now. There's absolutely nothing operationally significant about showing off a carbon fiber barreled bolt action rifle in a new and upcoming long-range cartridge. It's not like there's a laser with a built-in BDC indicator attached to it. -\_-
longrange,ffq74di,t1_ffp47vr,1580124035.0,That's because nowadays commercial is often better spec than what the military gets in bulk contracts. Why go through all that hassle when you have a slush fund and no way for GAO to trace it back to the agency? \*shrug\*
longrange,ffq71ld,t1_ffp612t,1580123925.0,"No, that's actually the more common way to do it. This is preferable because it not only lowers the profile of the weapon but allows you to carry it both in storage and on your back while keeping the bolt in place. Very ingenious solution, and I wish more chassis builders (I'm looking at you, XLR) would offer it."

Ehhhhh not exactly. MAJOR SPOILERS: >!Mashadar is different from Machin Shin which is different from Mordeth - at least in the beginning. The first is a sort of metaphysical manifestation of ""the road to hell is paved with good intentions"", the second IS in fact the Dark One's taint affecting the Ways and twisting them into a living monster that feeds on fear and evil, and the last was the combination of all the greed and hunger and anger that led to the downfall of Aridhol.!<"
