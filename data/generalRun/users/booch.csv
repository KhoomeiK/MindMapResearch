If most of the parents start work at 9am, then having the kids picked up from the bus stop at 915am means people can't get to work on time. For some people, this means they get fired. I'm not sure running the schools so that the kids wind up living on the street is in the kids best interest."

> Unfortunately, we are unable to play the expected/desired videos for your child. This is due to the lack of a 20 ft. 3.5 mm headphone cable (it went missing at the end of last year). I have asked the administration to provide my classroom with such a cable, but they told me they would be unable to do so and I should buy it myself. As such, I am asking any parents that might have such a cable lying around, extra, to reach out to me so that we can borrow it for the year. Thank you in advance.

That would let the parents know that you need such a thing, plus make it very clear the administration is unwilling to help. It may be that the administration is in the right (maybe they tried to fight the battle for the budget to replace such things) or not, but it does being the problem to the attention of the parents.

Of course, it also puts you (the teacher) on the shit list, so ... maybe not a great idea as a first year."

The answer was that C++ was used because many other projects of that type used it before. That seems like a perfectly reasonable explanation as to why they chose to use C++. It could be the wrong reason, but it's a valid, believable answer _to the question that was asked_."

But, it does. I don't understand why you don't think it's an answer. It may be an incorrect answer, but it is an answer and one that the original poster could believe is correct. If the responder thought they were wrong, then they should have replied indicating they didn't believe the person was correct. Not that their answer was not _actually_ an answer."

Incorrect. What they are saying is that it's not an answer at all

Ie, that's not a possible reason to have done it in C++. Which is obviously false. It's a reason someone can have for using C++. It may or may not be a good reason, but it _is_ a reason and _is_ the type of reason people use for things."
