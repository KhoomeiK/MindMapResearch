A marathon is to a test as a sprint is to a t20 game, they test different parts of the game. Can you stay at the crease for 10 hours, breaking only for lunch and tea? Can your body and mind and concentration hold on for that long? Can a team pull back in a 2nd innings after collapsing in the first?

I'm not a test guy, but it's so much more interesting than just ""they play for 5 days then maybe it's a draw"". In football I've had draws that feel like losses and draws than feel like wins, so too to cricket."

If a lost top isn't paired with a bottom you can use until it's time to use the loss section, that significantly reduces its powerfulness, because then it's a move 2 until you can use it. 

It's also all about context- Plagueherald has trash initiative and trash damage. Having 1 card out of a good hand size going against that doesn't make the 1 card overpowered."

I walked away and continued with my shopping, and I heard him chuckle as I walked off. When I came to pay for my stuff up front I saw him trying to walk out the doors with like fifteen Milky Ways in his hands without paying. The girl at the counter was very nice about it and professional, and was like “Sir, you need to pay for those first.” At first he kept pretending to be tired and not hear her, but eventually turned back around and brought them to the counter. When she took one of the bars and started scanning it multiple times, he stopped her and told her to scan them each individually “to prevent any electrical infetterence,” and then turned around and winked at me. I don’t even think that’s a word. After she scanned each bar and put them in a bag and started to say the price, he kept interrupting her by yawning really loudly."
