science,ffez78p,t1_ffecg0l,1579871089.0,"I don't think you can point to this as a reason for confirmation bias.  The President has lied so much that it is easy to assume that he is lying when he calls something ""fake news.""  Combine that with the fact that most of the articles he is attacking are negative about him and he especially lies to make himself look better."

hockey,ff5uoj1,t1_ff4o7uh,1579610875.0,"I think the same way you do.  If I'm at the game I'm gong to want to watch it from my seat and I'm going to want to pay attention to the game.

But to some people a hockey game is a different experience.  They like hockey, but watching hockey isn't the only reason they go to the game.  For some people, they use it as a low pressure situation to do business, like how some people will do business on a golf course.  For others it is a social event with a hockey game in the background.  You can see the ice from most of the tables in the lounge area, so just because you are up there doesn't mean you aren't watching the game live."
hockey,ff4az1m,t1_ff3h4t5,1579559401.0,"Additionally, the people who belong to those seats may be there, just not in the seats.  There is area behind the seats where there are tables.  I have gone with people who insist on spending a large portion of the game standing at the tables and eating/socializing.  They either watch the ice from the table of on a TV."
hockey,ff224rg,t1_ff0b80n,1579491747.0,"He has always gotten these chances.  He was always great a fore checking, getting in on the play, and finding the right spot at the right time.  But he would often miss the shot.  He would fire off the post or over the net.

He seemed to have recalibrated his shot this year."
penguins,few5h0b,t1_ferom40,1579405688.0,"He isn't as dynamic as he once was.  Ovi still has an incredible shot, but he doesn't make plays like he used to and doesn't play nearly as physical."

Plus you don't want whistleblowers being forced to testify because it might stop future ones from testifying."

We have 3 large dogs, so those carpets were constantly getting dirty.  I bought a rug cleaner and would run it about twice a week to keep the carpets looking decent.  I went through so much carpet cleaning solutions that were expensive and didnt work.

Finally, I just started putting a squirt of dawn in the water container.  It got my carpets looking white again."

todayilearned,fd7d4ao,t1_fd62ev2,1578202608.0,"That is because the suspensions were levied after an investigation, not before.  When suspended prior to an investigation it is usually with pay, because you don't want to fuck over a cop and his family for what might turn out to be nothing.

As much as Reddit hates cops, they are not all bad.  They often times get false or exaggerated accusations levied against them.  If they are found at fault the offending officer will often times have to pay back the pay they received on suspension.

As a personal anecdote to better explain my point.  I was a cop for a very brief time.  During that time I got suspended once for a week.  A female I arrested claimed I felt her up and sexually assaulted her when I arrested her.  The entire encounter leading up to and including the arrest took place in front of my cruiser and was caught on tape, so I was easily exonerated.  It just took a week for them to get around to investigating me.  So I got a stressful week of paid vacation."
witcher,fd5yugp,t1_fd3d6gb,1578183228.0,It does on audible as well.  I started blood and elves and was taken aback at first.  I eventually googled it and got last wish.
yesyesyesyesno,fcy3rrk,t1_fcxmxkg,1578074402.0,"They called 911.  In the event of true emergent situations, all first are notified.  If a cop is close they will attempt to get there as fast as possible and render aid until the EMTs arrive.  Since police officers are patrolling around, and ambulances are stationed somewhere, cops are almost always closer than the nearest ambulance.

During my brief time as an EMT the cops would beat us to a true emergent situation 9 out of 10 times."
videos,fctnxm8,t1_fct1ssz,1577950780.0,Those aren't jump cuts.  They are just hard cuts.
videos,fctnu98,t1_fctjzer,1577950654.0,"Just an FYI, the Taken 3 scene above is not what would be termed 'jump cuts.'  A jump cut is when two or more sequential cuts are made from the same camera angle and the shots are framed extremely similarly.  Like what a lot of Youtubers do.  For instance, Philip DeFranco will cut together four to five jump cuts to get a couple sentences out.

The Taken 3 shot is just terrible editing."
hockey,fcollmi,t1_fcng35d,1577835310.0,Huh?  Rust played on the same line.
AskReddit,fcdn9wg,t1_fcb0g6y,1577611620.0,100% this.  Sometimes all we need to hear is that the situation we are in sucks for us to feel better.  It at least acknowledges how we are feeling and validates that we are allowed to feel that way.
