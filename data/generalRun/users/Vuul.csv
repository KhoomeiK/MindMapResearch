I wish I had any meaningful advice to give you.


Your own happiness is important, I'm sorry your mother isn't accepting of your decision to transition. But this is your life, try not to let your mother stand in between you and who you want to be.

I don't know your age or financial situation, but if you are independent, focusing on your own aspirations for a while wouldn't make you a bad person.

I hope you can find the strength to get through this, you deserve to be loved for who you are."
SuicideWatch,ff83x2k,t3_es65v9,1579665325.0,"Making friends is hard, especially when you are feeling down. Whenever you open up you allow yourself to get hurt, and when you're already hurting even the idea of opening up is daunting.

You're not a burden though, you do deserve love and happiness. All of these things are things you could improve about yourself.

Life can be rough buddy, but we're never in it alone. Don't be afraid to ask for help. you wouldn't be disrupting anyone's life.

Take care of yourself."

Mourn him your own way, delay college if you have to, education is important, but your mental health even more so.

The only solace I can offer is that, for me at least, the memories that kept me up at night sobbing have turned into cherished memories that make me smile."

SuicideWatch,fdyj7oh,t3_enczik,1578780367.0,"You're not useless, we're all unique, we all have our strengths and weaknesses. Many people feel lost at sea in their 20s, try to focus on your own abilities and positive attributes.

It's tough, but you can't allow others to put too much pressure on you. This is your life, you deserve to be respected for your own personal strengths, you shouldn't have to feel like you have to live up to your siblings.

It may not mean much from a stranger, but I hope you'll find happiness soon, stay strong."

Life is rough sometimes man, and no matter how taboo it may seem, there is nothing wrong with asking for help, be it counseling, Psychology or psychiatry.

I'm rooting for you and I hope you feel better soon."
SuicideWatch,fd9gzkc,t3_ekd3q5,1578233190.0,"Maybe try telling them the truth? We all need a little help now and again, I know it's tough to talk to your loved ones about these things. and if not a loved one, maybe someone who's trained to talk about topics such as these, You are not a burden and you deserve to be happy just as much as everyone else.

If you're more independent and do your own laundry etc, maybe wear some turtlenecks for a few days. It's the time of year for it anyway.

Stay safe."

That relationship didn't last, fortunately. Couldn't Imagine a life built on that foundation.

Its awful those terrible things happened to you. You deserve to be loved and respected. I hope that, despite it all that has happened, you find happiness. That's what truly upsets those kinds of people, seeing others happy whilst they live their vapid lives built on emotional manipulation and abuse.

Fuck em."
