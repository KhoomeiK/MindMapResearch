education,ffvwby3,t3_evfxa5,1580275237.0,This is one of the worst ideas I’ve ever heard
umass,ffvvnak,t1_ffvv0tw,1580274622.0,"The major change is definitely not guaranteed. I’m assuming based on 4 classes being required as predictors, the earliest you could apply is during your second semester, and I believe the latest for comp sci is during your third. If you’re really concerned, admissions and the comp sci department definitely know more than me.

Also, as a heads up, even if you feel like your high school classes taught you the subject, go to class as much as possible (hopefully every day) and stay engaged. College levels of courses can cover different material or have a different assessment style than you are used to. Not the best move to bomb classes you need for a major change not because you couldn’t do it, but because you assumed you already knew everything and missed material."
umass,ffvsqzf,t3_evhm90,1580272186.0,"At UMass, for competitive programs like Isenberg and Comp Sci, you have to take predictor courses, do very well, and apply for the major change (not guaranteed). Reading through this site should give you an idea of the expectations and requirements: https://www.cics.umass.edu/ugrad-education/major-change-cs"
Connecticut,ffurjhq,t1_ffur677,1580247983.0,"Now we can agree on something! However, I will reiterate the point made by many people on this post... not the time to be debating the financial impact of various teams."
Connecticut,ffuqdw0,t1_ffujgel,1580247323.0,"Same article, football lost almost three times that and has no national marketing value. Uconn women and men’s basketball have helped to build significant brand recognition for the university, which increases applications and bring in money that way. (Not saying that’s WHY people go to uconn but it’s why our state is known nationally for Uconn)"
Connecticut,ffuimws,t1_ffthil4,1580242746.0,Lemme tell you it’s not the Uconn women that are losing money for that athletic department
umass,ffuifyv,t1_ffufvdv,1580242630.0,Yea they deadass told my friend during a mental breakdown that she didn’t seem distressed enough to warrant seeing someone
chanceme,ffpnufu,t3_eq4wcs,1580099826.0,UMass you should be fine. I could see a solid shot at the other schools too.
chanceme,ffpns0v,t3_eohe8t,1580099771.0,Speaking as a umass amherst econ major now I think you have a good shot. I was 1420 SAT 4.0W GPA 3.7UW and got into the business school before switching my major. I don’t know enough about the other schools to give my opinion on them.
college,ffebb4b,t1_ffdvcr6,1579841989.0,"100% agree as someone who is on considerable scholarship and also goes out quite a bit. Unless you are falling down drunk/high or do something disrespectful to them, the cops will not write you up. I can’t even think of something they COULD write you up for if you were respectful and sober (or at least refuse a breathalyzer, which you only have to do if you’re driving). They will just ask people to leave the party. The important part is balancing partying and keeping your grades up for your scholarship, which a lot of people struggle with!"
PhD,ff86cth,t3_es3rjh,1579667243.0,"In my opinion, it’s really hard to judge whether you want to do a PhD (or even what your undergraduate major should be) while you’re in high school. For me, I didn’t know I was interested in a PhD until I started interacting with graduate students (TAs) and professors. I’m a college freshman now and already changed my major from something I thought in high school that I’d want to do forever. My recommendation is to take a lot of different gen eds and electives and stay open minded no matter what! Even if you leave with a degree in the same major you had freshman year, it’s important to be a well rounded person and learn in all disciplines."
education,ff85gme,t3_es1rcs,1579666515.0,"College student here. I know it’s a cliche to be in college and complain about textbooks but the costs really are insane. But I’d rather have a physical copy than an online version. I’ll get distracted by another tab or my eyes will hurt.

The best textbook experience I had was reserving the book at my university library, checking it out for the whole semester, and taking notes with sticky notes. Didn’t pay a penny and got an awesome like new physical textbook.

Worst textbook experience was an online Econ textbook I paid like $80 for an access code to. I read it maybe 4 times and luckily didn’t need it to understand the class material. When I did read, I definitely rushed through to get the gratification of seeing the page number go up (weird, right?) and my eyes got soooo tired.

The real kicker in college is having to pay to do your homework! Like $100 for an access code per class! If you’re a heavy stem major (ie engineering) expect to buy multiple each semester (I am lucky that I am an Econ major and only have to buy them for math classes). The ultimate monopoly from textbook companies and sadly nothing professors can do about it."
Connecticut,ff1i5rs,t3_eqwpmw,1579479598.0,I haven’t seen any recent mall fights at Danbury. Last one I remember is 2013.
umass,fed0zro,t1_fe9myca,1578993240.0,My friend also took botany for gardeners and I can confirm it’s an easy class (in his experience)

wnba,fdie19k,t1_fdi46y8,1578440782.0,It is televised live on an ESPN station (usually ESPN2 or ESPNU)
PlasticSurgery,fdh9val,t3_ele4rd,1578418512.0,"Most surgeons will not perform surgery on people with body dysmorphic disorder (which it sounds like you have very severely). Even if you’d get objectively better results, you’ll never be satisfied and it’s not a healthy coping mechanism. Please consider therapy instead."
college,fdh9n25,t3_eldw5t,1578418370.0,"The good thing about math is that it can be learned. I never considered myself a “math genius” but I’m studying economics with a heavy math focus. I was a pretty average student in honors math courses throughout high school but have found videos online and campus tutoring resources to be a great support in college. If you love CS, you can do it too!"
college,fdh9cst,t3_eldlbx,1578418197.0,"No. Nothing is guaranteed. My dad went to SUNY Brockport (in the 70s, when it was by far the worst SUNY) and made more than family members that went to Georgetown or NYU. It’s all about how hard you work. Will students from more prestigious universities have to work a LITTLE less? Yes. But is it worth $100k in debt? No, at least not in my eyes."
PlasticSurgery,fde6izv,t3_ekuyo1,1578332266.0,"You should see an orthodontist or TMJ/jaw specialist, it sounds like you may need jaw surgery."
education,fdcpow1,t3_ekfks5,1578280915.0,Having rich students so others want to attend to seem rich themselves
umass,fdcph2t,t1_fdc0uo6,1578280753.0,It’s good.
mauramurray,fdcmdrg,t1_fcuisef,1578278505.0,"UMass Amherst still has it and even if it was discontinued, they’d still have records on it (though I doubt they keep them for 16 years)."
mauramurray,fdcm6ol,t1_fd2tos2,1578278366.0,"As a college student in MA from the NYC area, everyone knows to go to NH for cheaper alcohol, so I second it is strange."
umass,fcz7icw,t3_ej1klc,1578095239.0,"WGSS 201. Readings you can mostly bullshit and it’s just one long conversation with two 5-7 page essays and two short powerpoints. Most topics are political (racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia, etc.) but my professor was very open to everyone sharing their opinions, even if they disagreed with the text. Easy A from the POV of someone who didn’t do the readings lol."
umass,fcz763k,t3_ejls6r,1578095043.0,Psych is super science based in college so I think you’ll really enjoy it. It’s also common to pick up a double with biology or biochem.
chanceme,fcud59j,t3_dyoexu,1577978170.0,I go to UMass now and I would say you’ve got a really good shot.
college,fcucs8p,t3_eivprz,1577977939.0,"If you’d rather “live it up” than start your education, you should question why you’re going to college in the first place. I know sooo many people whose “gap year” turned into a lifestyle, for good reason! Some people don’t need college for their goals and you’re better off saving the money and learning a trade or something."
college,fcu748m,t1_fcu2px4,1577974145.0,"I am only a freshman but I am researching PhD programs in my field after my undergrad, so my GPA is very important as you noted. My job is with a D1 sports team in player operations so I not only need to be there on weekends but will be expected to travel for away games and tournaments starting next year. 

These are two factors that I never considered being relevant to joining a sorority. Now, I definitely see how these time commitments would interfere. Thank you so much!"
college,fctwzzt,t1_fctwtdj,1577963818.0,"Good for you? Depends on where you are. Just said my area has expensive housing.

(Also have to include utilities, trash, and, if you’re from New England like me, snow removal if you’re renting a house.)"
umass,fctwvwf,t1_fct623w,1577963662.0,"Yea the library employs a ton of students.

To be honest, just apply for everything you’re qualified for, no matter how glamorous a position or what the perks are. Any job still pays and you can use those skills to get a better one."
college,fctwn9j,t1_fcm0mcv,1577963320.0,Damn. I’m from the suburbs of New York in Connecticut but go to school in Massachusetts so it’s kind of unheard of to find anything less than $1k a month per bedroom in any of those markets lol.
college,fclzh40,t1_fcl6cgc,1577760295.0,Not really. I am a US college freshman and 1/2 of a double is about $3k a semester or $6k a year which is a better deal than renting in the area.
