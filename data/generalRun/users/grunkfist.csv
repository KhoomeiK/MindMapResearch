RPI,fegoctn,t3_eou5x2,1579098646.0,"Rigor level is about the same as Berkeley or Stevens. Graduation rate at 6years is between 87-90%. A marked difference is that the rigor level is the main reason RPI is ranked in the top ten stem universities for ROI. This means that your future salary will make it worth going here over another stem college on average. Check Forbes Top 25 STEM Colleges,  another website called Payscale ranks RPI 16th among private research universities for highest ROI. To answer your question bluntly yes it’s higher than average on rigor but in the end it pays off and is worth it if you can handle it."

internships,fdm7jyx,t3_em2o85,1578541738.0,"I’ve found many when I look locally in towns instead of shooting for Manhattan. So if you’re in Queens make your search https://www.google.com/search?q=google+software+engineer+jobs

Then click on more filters. Click on your town you live in like Bayside or Forest Hills. Then click on 5 miles and hit search. If you dont see anything then expand your search to 10 miles and then 15. One of the ways I also found internships was to search for the language instead of software engineer. There are jobs that are not exactly for soft engys per se but instead for people with atleast rudimentary knowledge of the language like python or java or that can do easy embedded control work with the android to linux software which they can basically teach a monkey to do in a week but it’s great resume experience!
Dont forget to search your local utility company like PSE&G or LI-Lighting or TimeWarner etc. as well as local schools that need tutors if you already know the language. Another search word you can try is Aerospace or DoD (Dept of Defense). And finally you can try the usjobs website https://www.usajobs.gov/
Protip is to first click the button that says Students& Recent Grads. This will get rid of thousands of jobs from your list so that you can see only your level. Good luck."

RPI,fdcrbb7,t3_ej4qd1,1578282115.0,"If you haven’t done so already you need to be doing ‘Project Euler’ problems regularly from the time you finish csci-1200 until you graduate. These are the typical types of problems I was asked. Go to glassdoor and search the company name and then click on ‘Interviews’ for a list of samples from the memories of commenters. Take those with a grain of salt. Check youtube for sample mock coding interviews for example https://youtu.be/wwIysnVmAUg
If you have the cash and you’ve practiced enough hire a mock examiner for about 60-100 bucks. I got a guy that graduated CMU masters and worked at google and was extremely informative. After my hour with him he was chill and we chatted about what it’s like there and some tips that he recommended for me personally. I wish I could remember his name but you can search around for those services online. The hiring is rolling up to April so don’t worry if you don’t get in first shot, just try again till you do.

Minecraft,fdcj20f,t3_ekkpyy,1578276126.0,"There are some errors in your calculation. According to your calculation a gold block is 19,320kg so one gold ingot would weigh 2,147kg. This is incorrect. A gold ingot weighs 12 kg. Using 12kg for an ingot, a gold block would then weigh 108kg. 8- gold blocks would then weigh 864kg. I'm curious where you got your 2,147kg figure from?

Edit: also, a golden apple recipe is with gold ingots NOT blocks. So that’s a ninth of an block. If you meant a Notch Apple, that recipe is blocks of gold but the picture and title are regular golden apples, so your calculations are way off."

RPI,fd7fay3,t1_fd4qu97,1578203572.0,"Still some info needed before answering that question. How many credits are you taking this coming semester, or are you doing Spring Arch?
If you get 18 credits in the Spring and 17 in another semester and then 16 for the rest then yeah add CS. On the other hand if you can afford to stay an additional semester, well that’s another way to add CS. Otherwise, I’d suggest sticking with either CSE or CS but not both. I wouldn’t worry too much about your major for big name companies. I passed the entrance to google and my major was never discussed. Just 3 rounds of coding and 1 behavioral. I accepted the offer of a different company though so there’s that. You really only need to be proficient in DS and Algo if you want to work in a big company like those. The 3 rounds that I did was for the google summer internship for 2020 but a full time position is from 5-7 rounds and the final one is whiteboard so you need to practice that also."
RPI,fd4osjk,t1_fd4cfzw,1578169506.0,"There is one important issue, yes. With a cse/cs degree you have space for 3 electives that must align with ONE specialization in the cs concentration. Googlesearch ‘rpi cs concentrations’.
If you’ve taken some EE courses that have taken some time away from your cse/cs plans, you may have wasted some valuable time. Check to see how many EE classes you’ve taken which will divert your planned curriculum continuation plans.
If you want to send me the classes you’ve taken so far separated by semester grade levels."

Many jobs will ask you for your transcript for two reasons.
