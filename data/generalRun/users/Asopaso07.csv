It’s just easier to say, “ohhh he is short” instead of them saying “ohhh, I’m not attracted to South Asian men”."
Somalia,ff8pduu,t1_ff89ldi,1579690267.0,"Exactly!!! Muslim or not, it’s still a crime against humanity. They are after the Armenians and Assyrians too. You have to live in Turkey to truly understand what a shit hole it is.

They have more children, teachers, journalists and politicians in prison for “thought crimes” than China who has the highest population in the world and a really bad human rights record. Says a lot!"
Somalia,ff7k09x,t3_es1guv,1579651360.0,"Erdogan is using Islam so you guys don’t notice who he really is - a white colonialist after money and power. He stole millions from the people in Turkey, lives in a huge palace, invaded Syria and killed thousands of Muslims. Has ruined the image of Islam by allowing Isis through the border and using them as proxies to invade Syria. 

He is the scum of the Earth and will destroy Somalia if you guys let him. Mark my words."
