I was, in a way, being generous by implying that maybe you couldn't know better.

Frankly, I'm sick of being shamed for shit I literally can't do anything about (don't even suggest surgery. Just don't.), I've been shamed about having small tits or stretch marks on my thighs since I was literally 13, and before that I was shamed for my clothes and hair. You can find something unappealing or not be attracted to it without shaming someone- you don't HAVE to like how 90% of women look down there, but you CANNOT shame them by calling their vagina ""ugly"", a ham sandwich, or anything else. We spend our whole lives, from the time we can walk just about, being shamed for our appearance, especially things that are perfectly natural and can't be helped without expensive cosmetic surgeries that may actually negatively affect our health, and it needs to fucking change. Which means that if you're out here calling women's vaginas ugly, YOU need to change. 

(And before you get all ""Well what about men"", yes, women who shame men for their penis length, which is less ""correctable"" than large labia, need to shut the fuck up too.)

these coagulation proteins.

There's no blood in the body of any mammal that contains ""anti clotting substances"", the only creatures that produce such a thing are mosquitoes and leeches.

One of my co-workers was trying to argue that the protesters in Hong Kong deserved to get shot because they'd resorted to violence against the police.... Who had been shooting at them, beating them, and sending them to prison for months before facing retaliation. My grandmother was saying that the Greens were bad because they ""flooded hundreds of kilometres of bush!""... Which was historically an area that seasonally flooded, and no longer flooded due to a dam being built. They were simply trying to simulate the natural way things had been there in the past.

Both of these examples are people who were spoon fed information that was deliberately skewed to create a certain opinion by their chosen source of news and neither thought anything of it or looked further into it. They're on the same level with people who think the moon landing was faked or that the government is deliberately giving people autism with vaccines; they don't stop and think ""Well, why would that happen?"", and if they do they go searching for more skewed information to reinforce their previous spoon fed opinion.

Just don't.), I've been shamed about having small tits or stretch marks on my thighs since I was literally 13, and before that I was shamed for my clothes and hair. You can find something unappealing or not be attracted to it without shaming someone- you don't HAVE to like how 90% of women look down there, but you CANNOT shame them by calling their vagina ""ugly"", a ham sandwich, or anything else. We spend our whole lives, from the time we can walk just about, being shamed for our appearance, especially things that are perfectly natural and can't be helped without expensive cosmetic surgeries that may actually negatively affect our health, and it needs to fucking change. Which means that if you're out here calling women's vaginas ugly, YOU need to change. 

(And before you get all ""Well what about men"", yes, women who shame men for their penis length, which is less ""correctable"" than large labia, need to shut the fuck up too.)

these coagulation proteins.

There's no blood in the body of any mammal that contains ""anti clotting substances"", the only creatures that produce such a thing are mosquitoes and leeches.

My shifts can be shortened, lengthened, and reorganised to meet demand. I'm not at work unless something needs doing, meaning if business is good I get lots of hours... and I get paid quite a bit by the hour. 

However, what this also means is if I'm consistently failing to meet quotas, my manager can give me less work as I'm costing more money than the work I'm doing is worth.

Male characters in games or media exist as a power fantasy for men to project themselves onto. They have agency of their own and their actions affect the world around them. They're cool, powerful, important, and often have a range of women who desire them.
