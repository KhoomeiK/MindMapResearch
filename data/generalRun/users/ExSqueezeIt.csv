macrogrowery,ffg8sro,t1_ffg3hel,1579900926.0,"This is actually a quite common missconception.   


You can grow bomb weed and even if your grow skills are not good you can grow dank smelling bud in flower if you just follow simple parameters of growing but if you don't know how to dry it properly you will lose most of your terpenes along the way and also will not remove chloroforme properly so it will have pretty bad taste cuz of those 2 factors.   


Thats the most novice mistake I ever saw, people think they just need to grow weed then wonder why it turns to shit 1 month later lol.   


I mean you are right, its a wholesome process, but I think this guy just lost a shitload of smell and potency because he doesn't know how to properly post-process the plant in correct conditions to maintain full cannabinoid and terpene profile.

That shit was privatized long time ago in most western countries and now they are just profiting on us paying for shit we already basically paid for. 

All public transit should be government owned because government used out fucking money to pay for it in the first place, then they sold it to some fucks to make some profit in the long run because they don't know how to fucking run a proper state and then whoever buys it for pennies on a dime makes eternal profit on dumb fucking dumbfucking people. 

Oh shit lol I forgot you americans actually always paid more because all your shit was privately owned. Lol, capitalism at its finest.

either way if you get more then 10% reclaim you doing something wrong probably.   
Some folsk with ultra pure extracts literally have 0 reclaim or even burned matter for that case (live resin or live rosin extracts)....

MephHeads,feuhrly,t1_fetrk65,1579386631.0,"leaves dry out first, forming a layer that keeps the bud from drying out too quickly, thus prolonging the dry time = which is what you want.   


During this time, the good bacteria in the bud (forgot the name) will metabolize the leaves matter and use it to process sugars within the plant...  


Also wet trimming you will destroy shitload of terps and trichomes just by touching the buds, leaves act as a fine layer to prevent that and once they dry out they are shitload easier to trim. You literally need to just twist the buds around and use nail sccisors to cut into the stem of the leaf because it will be clearly visible and the whole leaf structure just falls off.   


Its literally like opening a bouquet compared to wet trimming which is like... i dunno, way too fucking messy, the buds are way too squishy there is no proper bud structure yet and you will certainly either cut way too into the bud or you will do a partial job because it is wet and you cannot get it all off.   


Besides, dry trimming is tried and tested and proven to produce a much nicer smelling and tasting buds then wet trimming. Hands down.   


Only thing wet trimming MAYBE better at is bag appeal. And if you smoking weed just for looks... nah.

These are healthy individuals. They are more active then a lot of kids today lol.   


You don't need to exert yourself to be healthy. Thats some western mentality bullshit. Doing things slowly and easily with less tensions is the key to longevity.

They move with the grace of 20 year old.   
because instead of training and abusing their body they train through exercises that work within your physical limits... our western approach is to always pump it and push it... that can only go for so long.   


You just answered your own question.. the only reason he can do it is because of the gear. There is a reason why that isn't natural...   


If you value your self image of a ""tough guy"" so much you need to take gear to prove you can do it... by all means do. But you are not that without the gear.   


Thats self deception. Besides you might want to look at side effects of gear.   
Wait 10 years till a blood vessel bursts in that guys brain from too much exertion.   


People age and lose their physical capabilities. Thats natural. Taking gear and pretending like you are 20 years old is not. Yea, he looks good now but give him time. Its just forcing the same bullshit till the body says its enough I can't take any more.   


People like those are obsessed with their self image, they rarely listen to their own body. I know a lot of jacked up guys like that and they all have terrible knee problems, back pains and such. But they push through that or straight up ignore those signs because they wanna feel powerful. And how do they do that?   


By repeating the same process and trying to recreate the feeling that made them feel powerful.   


shits good while it lasts, yea, its all Universe expressing itself, I know why people are addicted to their own self image, its captivating... but thats self deception.   


If he did that without the gear, I would say that man is a character for himself. But taking steroids and doing that is maybe fascinating or looks good to you but I would seriously advise you to look at some documentaries about long term side effects of using those and pushing your body in that direction.   


Then make up your mind if you think that is such a good idea.   


Entropy is innevitable. All things fall apart. I am not saying kill yourself, but decieving yourself that you will always be able to do the same stuff is self deception at its finest.   


If you love pumping in the gym so much you are willing to take gear and burst a brain vessel in 20 years time sure thing pal. But that doesn't make you special.  Forcing can only get you so far.

Dabs,feslrul,t1_feomqjg,1579366568.0,"nah I am doing extracts now. Sure thing man, you can gear yourself and do that. 

I don't like the idea of synthetic steroids in my body no thank you, no matter how good it looks now most people using those die due to high blood pressure and other problems. Plus I bet 1000$ he has problems with his dick if he is geared up. 

Things are rarely as they seem, look man I am close to 35 and I am far more vital then most people, but I am just saying if I were smart like this 20 years ago I would feel like 20 years still. 

You don't need gear, you can try out natural Cordyceps mushroom man, it acts as natural amphetamine basically. Also increases the amount of iron in your blood stream, which in turns binds more oxygen and gives you shitload of energy. And its natural, it doesn't fuck with your blood pressure and blood vessels. 

If someone showed me dabbing 15 years ago I swear I would literally be intact almost hahaha, yea smoking is the problem but doesn't matter if its smoking or dabbing or whatever, everything takes a tool, there is always a price to pay. 

Just because he can, doesn't mean you will, maybe the dude lived a peaceful life and didn't do much shit to himself while he was younger, thats why he is so vital at that age. But its more probably the gear. I could take steroids, but that is just a band aid. 

I see people looking great on those, but I see past that, they are just insecure about their aging and want to be forever young. Its chasing images, self deception at its finest. 

If I do this and this I am living rightfully. 

In the words of wise Miyamoto Musashi... ""you must realize.. there is more then one way to the top of the mountain"". 

That means sometimes you gotta crawl, sometimes you gotta go right, sometimes you gotta go left, sometimes you gotta jump and sometimes you got to stop and wait till the way clears ahead. 

Life is a dynamic process, things change and so do we. I get it, everyone wants to be grown up when they are young and once they grow up they just wanna feel forever young again. 

Its self deception at its finest, you don't have to listen to me, by all means, be your judge, but I am telling you what I know from my personal experience. 

If your ideal self image is taking gear to convince yourself you are doing great, by all means do. But what happens when you stop taking it? Will you still be ok with yourself? 

All props to the guy, I hope I can still be that lively by then, I actually feel younger by the day the more I restrain myself from self destructive behavior of my past habbits. I don't even dab daily anymore, I did today because friend was over for a cup of coffee but the point of life is not to try to recreate that moment that made you feel alive over and over again. 

Thats just how brain works, it gets hooked on those moments then always tries to recreate and upgrade on them. Sometimes, doing less is doing more. 

I don't expect you to understand what I mean, I am having much trouble translating these concepts to english to the best of my abilities, as I said, don't make me the judge, you will see in your own time. 

Brain loves to self justify itself thats why it forces us into these patterns of habbit because its easier for our self image to associate with everyday patterns then to live every day on its own. 

Learn to quiet your mind and you will see exactly how much bullshit self image its projecting on you. Well I rambled enough... good luck to you on your journey friend.

I didn't want to go in explaining the physiological process (Even tho I am quite aware of what you have written) because people will think I am ""full of myself"" then... happens quite a lot. People think I am some type of ""mr. know it all"" just because I am trying to offer some advice that could potentially change their perspective a bit. 

Yes you are right, best thing to do after a hard workout is rest, eat and some more rest. Because the organism has been under training stress the circulation is at its highest peak of the day and the body is craving fuel... thats why food absorbs better after a workout. Because the body craves it... same with oxygen (or whatever you are inhaling)... it will get deeper then usual - thus creating that ""deeper high feeling"" most people associate with getting high after a workout. 

Its all fun and games while you are young as I said, but as you get older that feeling will turn from enjoyable to pressure to pure fucking tedious body weight. I wish I was making that up, fuck if someone told me this 10 years ago I would tell them to shut the fuck up and let me do my thing... thats why I ain't mad when people ignore or discredit my advice, I wouldn't have known better unless I made those mistakes myself. 

Thank you for your compliment man, I can express myself good in english but my problem is my mind works on like lightning fast speeds, most time I can't really catch up my own thoughts or even reverse them so I just type it as it goes, I don't even know what I am about to say 95% of the time it just comes out... thats easy in my native language but in English it becomes a problem especially in topics like these where I know I need to get my point across and I really don't have time to go over and check my grammar because I will lose the ""point"" I was trying to make ^^

I actually written party pooper but the word pooper sounds like some guy taking a shit lol xD I always laugh when pronouncing that one ^^ 

Also the reason why my english is pretty good I believe is because I like to express myself as you can see, I don't like short or plain communication, and I always like learning about meaning of new terms and words... but sometimes it gets tedious because I write shitload long paragraphs where I repeat myself multiple times in different words xD hahahah. 

All part of learning I suppose. 

But yea the point remains, I am not here trying to be all self righteous or saying you should do things my way people, I am just saying no matter how good weed makes you feel its still straineous on your system. 

Processing anything takes something away from you, thats just balance of life. 

As my grandma liked to say; ""You can do what you want, but not for as much as you want.""

Dabs,fenjcqu,t1_fenco9u,1579285938.0,"Exactly man. As I said, I used to do it heaaaaavily for 15 years. Snoop dogg doses. Literally. 

I ain't trying to preach some self righteous bullshit about how doing it clean or not is better. No no, I just want to say if you are doing things out of habbit there is no point in doing them. 

Sometimes its better to not to then to listen to your Mind just because it defines itself through our habbits. 

Smoke/dab on some days, skip on others. No day is made to be the same. Trying to live your life like its scheduled is not good my friends, I can tell you that from personal experience, no matter what you feel now YOU WILL GROW OLD as time passes and things you can do now wont be possible always. 

Things are easy when we are young because we think we know what we are doing and what is best for us, but the truth is we don't. We rarely have a fucking clue or idea. We just do what we feel is best for us. 

But that feeling will change. No one is immune to entropy. 

Thats why I am saying, if you are already doing it, be smart about it. Not every day is a day to go all in. 

Not every day at training you go 110% so why should you smoke after every training? Some days you do low intensity, some days you do hard exercises. Some days you only stretch, some days you don't. 

Life is a dynamic process, don't limit that shit just because of habbits. 
Thats my point. 

Yea I know brother and I am glad that it works for you, trust me, no one happier then me when I see people who like to develop their relationship with themselves... but time is passing, and things that work now will not work always. Thats why its important to stay flexible and adapt, and changing habbits is the hardest thing to adapt too.

I don't mind who agrees or disagrees with me, I just know how easy is to think you know whats best for you when in fact you are doing the exact opposite... social indoctrination is a real problem no one is talking about, people just assume whatever others are doing must be good for them too.

Anyways, cheers :)"
Dabs,feni3is,t1_fen93ow,1579285168.0,"For real bro, it won't hurt you to experiment. 

The only reason I am telling you this because once upon a time the world was mine and I was invincible, I would literally wake up at 5-6 AM, do my 2-3 hour easy exercises like Tai Chi and Zhan Zhuang, sometimes get high sometimes not, then smoke one immidiately after. Eat, then rest some then dancing through the day. At the evening if I am not too done or I still have some left I would do hard intensity training, some weights or just body workouts. And always smoke after. 

Sure, smoking is not dabbing but still, the point is the same. It can't be good for you in the long run. I know it feels good and we are all quick to assume that we know what we are doing, but most of the time we truly don't. 

Its easy to do that shit when you are young, but as time passes it becomes harder and harder... I have many days where I literally cry because of how stupid I was back then, thinking if I just postponed a joint or two daily my health would be much better then it currently is. 

Too bad no one showed me how to dab 15 years ago when I started, it would save me so much health and money its not even funny :( 

I know most people don't think about that stuff, I didn't when I was able, but now I see myself more and more becoming a conscious old guy and I don't want others to do mistakes I did. 

I am not trying to tell anyone how to live their lives I am just trying to point out things are not always as they seem, especially things we are doing out of habbit. 

Too many times we define ourselves as our habbits, not understanding how they actually prohibit us from experiencing freedom to the fullest, because even before the moment arrives we already know what we want to do with it. 

Yea man, its not even about quitting or doing the right things ,its just about learning about yourself on yourself. Thats why I believe habbit is death of a free spirit, because the mind starts indentifying itself with what its doing and its habbits, forming our ideas of ourselves. 

Thats why I believe many people are depressed and feel bad about themselves these days, its too much social pressure and expectation to do this and that, be it from family, school, work or whatever... last thing we should do is put more expectations and cause more tension to ourselves. 

Its a tricky line but I truly believe a man should experiment more doing things differently then indentifying himself with what he is doing the one way. 

Its not even about being sober or not sober while working out, its about realizing there is no one way to do things. 

Life is dynamic and holding onto habbits or patterns is death of a free spirit. I know Mind craves patterns but that exactly is the problem. 

You can't tell life what it is, but you can force yourself to think about it in a certain way, basically limiting yourself from infinite potential just because we have the idea we know how things are supposed to work. 

Sometimes, doing nothing is better then doing something stupid. 
Its just hard to restrain yourself from the urges deeply embedded into our nervous system. Most people are not even themselves, they are a collection of their nervous system impulses and stimuli based upon your habbits and life experiences. 

I think I went a bit off topic here but its not easy to present the concept I am trying to translate into english, even tho I know the words its hard to pin point it into a coherent mental construct. 

All in all, appreciate your time and will to listen to me man, I really hope you try and experiment doing things differently I guarantee your body will be grateful for it. 

We all just gotta learn to stop listening to our Mind and its expectations of us and just listen to our Body, it knows so much better. The problem comes differentiating between the two :S 

much luck bro! 
Never be afraid to experiment with yourself, the Universe will be proud of you."
Dabs,fen1efr,t3_epya8t,1579274809.0,"Seriously, postpone your post workout inhalation boys.   


I used to think its all good and dandy but that shit beats the purpose of the exercise.   
Give your body some time to relax afterwards and learn to relax naturally in your post workout feel good dopamine release, if you gonna go and chase highs after it do it couple of hours after workout.   


Your body will be much more grateful. Its easy when you are young and have that youthfulness, there is literally nothing holding you down.   


But as you get older you will realize how much straineous that stuff is on your being.   
All because Mind cannot relax in stillness but is just chasing that Body stimuli to make it feel alive.   


I know I rambled some but its hard translating these concepts into English.   


Not trying to be the party breaker here, but I learned it the hard way... strains and highs will come and go but you only got one body.... take care of it bros!!!  


Even tho if it means postponing that high... you will be much more grateful for it trust me.   


Again, no harm, to each his own, everyone is their own master.. I am just sharing my thoughts after 15 years of literally living like on threadmill (getting stupidly high either before or after and engaging in all types of physical activites from sport to martial arts to dancing on daily basis) and it just left me... permanently exhausted. Now I am in process of building myself up again, and its all because I couldn't separate the two.

True freedom starts once you abandon all hope and expectation.

Meanwhile everyone wasting their life on the idea of what that life is supposed to be that others told them lol.

That helplessnes you are feeling is your nerve system indicating dependence and forcing your mind to just think about it.

Quitting weed is not about quitting weed, its about learning to silence your brain so it stops forcing you to do something out of habbit, so you can learn to enjoy it moderately and responsibly.

As long as you are thinking about it, you are doing it wrong. And postponing the quitting you wanna try out won't do nothing. Rather get through the day and if its really that bad that you feel pain or some other withdrawal symptoms other then ""i feel like shit"" yea go score some.

But if its just your feeling thats bothering you, its time to learn how to function without it.  


Trust me your brain is making this 10 times more harder then it needs to be. Its because its a life long habbit thats imbedded into your nervous system, and all the feeling of when you go and try quitting are your nervous system re-arranging itself. Its ok to cry, laugh and all that other shit. You gotta learn to let those feelings FLOW through you brother, not focus on them and act every time.

cannabiscultivation,fddf7zl,t1_fdd26zd,1578309562.0,"but you want the temps cold as possible to preserve the terpens and cannabinoids.   


Do the dry trim.   


First it will prolongue the drying process as the leaves remain and withold the moisture for longer around the buds, prolonging the drying process (a good thing). Second that prolonged dry will make your buds more danker because the sugars inside will metabolize properly by the bacteria inside the weed because it will have more time to properly digest the sugars and everything else during the drying process.   


I have seen shitload of wet and dry trims and in all cases the dry trimmed buds were by far the better ones, visually and to smoke and smell/taste.   


This is because when you wet trim you will be taking shitload of trichs off the plant (that hash like goo over the hands that forms you can make hash from = could had stayed on the plant) and it just doesn't allow for proper metabolization of the sugars inside (there was a topic on this by some dude doing drying and curing for some medicinal cannabis facility with shitload of info about this bacteria inside weed... basically the whole process of drying is preserving that one bacteria so it can metabolize the weed from inside to make it not so tasty for other micro organisms like mold and other nasty bacteria that will ruin the buds to an extent by making the taste ""acidic or sour-y"").   


Dry trimming is SHITLOAD easier, the leaves are already bascially fallen off, you just cut the stems of the leave and they fall revealing the bud... no need to overdo it because trimming fresh you are bound to cut off more then leaves as its all mushy because its fresh and full of water.   


Sorry for my bad english but yea you can always do 50/50 and judge yourself but I am telling you dry trimming is shitloads better in my experience on basically all fronts. First time i tried it I was blown away, never looked back.   


Also your temps are good but start with 68-70 farnheit and 50-55% RH and lower the temps by 0.5 every 2 days or 1 every 3-4-5 depending on how tight your buds are... you want temperatures as cold as possible but avoid high RH as it will make your shit succeptible to mold.. probably know that already but never hurts to repeat :)   


hope you go with dry trimming, you will be blown away by how much more taste and fragnance the buds have."

hempflowers,fcyxvc1,t1_fcywpc0,1578089483.0,"Yea I understand but i mean but most people think of organic like some magical beneficial thing for you when like cyanide is completely organic too :D 

plants can't eat organic matter, it has to be broken down into pure elements first by micro organisms in the soil... using mineral nutrients is just cutting out the extra work because we already extracted and refined them into pure food for plants.... 

but I get the self righteous terminology behind it. I just hate it xD"

hempflowers,fcywg4d,t3_ejjhai,1578088579.0,"Thats why I laugh at people saying they want ""full organic"" when the only type of food a plant can eat is elements in their pure form lol.  It literally feeds on pure elements through diffusion, thats why it sucks up all the heavy metals. Didn't know it doesn't store them in buds tho... neat :D"
