But I'm no expert and have only built 2 pcs so far. When clicking the top link for your current build it shows the same thing you have below. I have the same video card as you. I hit 100% CPU all the time on my current i5 7500, 16gb ram pc.

Wish I took a pic, but just go there and look and enjoy yourself. Best seen from the bottom of the road by the train tracks. You can also chill out in the parking lot for woodside ferry terminal and snag a pic. They have cranes in operation on several levels. I wanted to go explore it.
