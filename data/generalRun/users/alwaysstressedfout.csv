Your fetishes are relatively soft, too. None of those are difficult to incorporate. She was the issue not you. She should have been excited to be able to make sex more fun for you not disgusted."
sex,ffc4azu,t3_esqxbv,1579791190.0,"I am pretty sure, I have the same breasts as you have- small, big puffy nipples and almost tuberous. Mine are only super sensitive prior/ during my period. 

Happy small tits!!! lol"

sex,ff1cg81,t1_ff0wns0,1579477488.0,yes yes yes!! Thats whats great about deepthroating- all the natural lube!!
sex,feqtsck,t3_eqeb48,1579345950.0,"OH GOD, YESS. FINALLY A QUESTION I HAVE AN ANSWER FOR: my fave sex toy is a glass dildo. It has little red hearts all over the 'shaft' and the 'head' is more prominently sculpted. Its straight, I havent got around to buy a curved one yet. 

Since mine does not have any curvature, putting it in fully can be uncomfortable. But it is awesome for some g-spot stimulation with the right angle. 

The hearts on it stand out just a little bit, so I dont particularly feel them. If its prominently rigged, it should definetlely be a different sensation, I assume. 

Thats all I know, so far. I have to get more in the future! 

Have fun!!"

sex,fcmhpua,t3_ehwxwb,1577775711.0,"I am pretty much in the same boat: 20F, virgin, with big labia minora. A couple years ago I couldnt imagine letting someone see my vulva, but now I am pretty comfortable with the wqy it looks and I like it too. 

That being said, if you dont feel like you would ever accept yourself, then keep doing research and start putting money aside. 

Someone already commented that you should not go through with the procedure if it is only about the aesthetic look. How uncomfortable are they on a day to day basis? Does it get inbtween working out etc... 

If it will make you happier, go ahead. But maybe dont fixate on it either, start saving up and maybe in a couple years you wont want to anymore."
offmychest,fa9x2yo,t3_e8463w,1575895328.0,"oh god, are you me? Juat a couple hoirs I was feeling so lonely, but I am also happy that I do not have to deal with people. Being a moody bitch sucks..."
