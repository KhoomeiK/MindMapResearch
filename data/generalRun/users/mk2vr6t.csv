AdviceAnimals,ffcvf3c,t1_ffc4je7,1579808071.0,"Yes, and I think if a cop is standing out in broad daylight making himself visible, in a marked car, then the deterrence will happen and people will slow down.  But my whole point is that deterrence is clearly not the driver of the setup of a speed trap when you are hiding in the bushes in an unmarked car.  At that point it's just revenue generation.  Hide and catch as many as you can."
AdviceAnimals,ffbxmdm,t1_ffbvahx,1579786053.0,"I don't doubt that's the opinion of some officers, but when they are literally hiding behind a post box or a different car or a tree, and handing out tickets for 10kmh over, I can't help but think it has absolutely nothing to do with safety and everything to do with making money.  I'm sure it's more handed down from the higher-ups, but without a ""quota"" (officially or implied) I think you'd be hard pressed to find officers willing to hide in the bushes to hand out tickets for 10kmh over to college kids on their way in to school (this used to be a regular occurrence here)."
