OverwatchUniversity,fexd9br,t3_eqpast,1579429048.0,"People try a lot harder in comp and care much more. Another thing is that time management and payload management is more important. In QP one team will often save all their ults and then blow them in Overtime to get the win but in Comp since you will switch sides and have time banks this strat doesn't exactly work. You have to make the other team fight for every inch of payload progress or every tick on 2CP maps, then do it better and faster than them."

TrollCoping,feuokfg,t1_fepdy2e,1579388507.0,"Part of why I started to send cards to strangers is I was sending a card pretty much each week to a friend. He loved tacos and I found some cool taco cards and sent him one. I was really excited and couldn't wait to hear his response. He got it and sent me his typical ""thanks for the card I liked the message"" when I talked with him for a bit he said he didn't even look at the outside of the card! He had no idea it was a taco card. I felt a little down I was making these neat cards or buying cool ones and he wasn't even looking at the outside. He would also make comments that made me feel he wasn't even reading the inside. 

I'm very sentimental and I ended up sending him a small letter writing set with stamps already applied and told him it would mean a lot to me if he would write me back someday. He never did hah, though he did include a card with a birthday present he sent me (we've been exchanging birthday and Christmas presents for a few years except this year I didn't get anything from him and I only sent him a small plush instead of my usual big box of random treats). But lesson learned, if that sort of stuff isn't someone's thing then they aren't going to do it even if you supply them with all the tools to."

GirlGamers,feumyjn,t1_fetur68,1579388052.0,"Exactly, there are nice people and mean people and people at every point in-between. I think there are a small portion of women and probably men that get anxious when they experience toxicity and the can be per-emptively rude. Or often it's more of an escalation, someone will say something that's very low level toxic and the person will respond in an even more toxic manner and often it just keeps progressing."
GirlGamers,feum7ns,t1_fesbudu,1579387881.0,"Oh no I for sure think they do as well I've just noticed it more when in say a 6-stack for Overwatch. While the guys are competitive with each other and will ask stuff like ""who has golds?"" or ""who stole my golds?"" with girls it has been more of like ""why would you think it was a good idea to ult here?"" ""you know if you can't aim you shouldn't be playing Ana""."
GirlGamers,feqbmm0,t3_eqc8r5,1579339848.0,"I think it can vary. Some people are just mean no matter what. I think other times it's just from having experienced so much toxicity not necessarily making them toxic but like you start getting just done with it and being a bitch back and then every time you go to play you wonder how long before people start being jerks so you are just on edge and take the smallest thing poorly. Then I think some are that way to go against the stereotype of ""teehee lets all just get along uwu"" and they just go way to far. And I think also a lot of women can be too competitive with each other, like it's this mentality of they have to be the best woman gamer so they look down on the other and are overly critical and mean."

patientgamers,fep1kuv,t3_eq6bqu,1579310088.0,"There are some older PlayStation games I just loved. Rule of Rose was so good yet got a ton of hate from the few people I've talked to that played it. Something about being a sickly Victorian era orphan getting terrorized while on an airship I just really enjoyed. 

Stretch Panic was also a fun one, you have like a magic scarf thing that you go and pull and stretch on whatever the objective is. I mostly remember some level with very busty mobs you had to like pop? It's been awhile but I remember playing through several times. 

I have also put in hundreds of hours and replayed several times Valkyrie Profile: Lenneth on PSP. Now and then I think of trying to get the original but I remember reading between a limited run and manufacturing errors getting a playable copy is quite pricey.

AskGames,feoygrp,t3_eq6cy2,1579308124.0,"There is plenty out there, I think though you have to figure out what you are wanting from games. Are you wanting relaxation, a place to be competitive and tryhard, a social thing to play with others or meet others, a story to get lost in, etc. For me I realized that many genres of single player games just can't hold my interest. I end up wanting either social games, single player ones that have a bit of grind, and some competitive ones for me to have something I want to advance and improve in. Once you kinda get what type of a gamer you are you'll be able to find things that are fitting and get you excited again."
GirlGamers,femb7eq,t3_ep9127,1579246886.0,Tossing in another vote of Stardew Valley it's relaxing and chill though you can go a min/max route with other challenges too. I had fun with Portal2 and L4D2.

Seemed no matter where I stuffed shoes, wrapped my feet or pre-emptively applied bandaids I always had blisters, areas rubbed raw and bleeding, and that sort of stuff but not like deformed like with foot binding. Also while very impressive this ballerina isn't having to hold this pose for long stretches of time. 
As for greater chance of arthritis say at/past retirement ageI think it can be 50/50 many dancers take amazing care of their bodies and are often much more active than their peers and healthier. Then there are ones like me :p only 31 but could probably never go back, knees and hips just ache too much albeit I was hit by a car so not like it's 100% dance related."

AskGames,fehcuso,t3_ep4p4h,1579113935.0,I used to get this pretty frequently now not as often unless I'm playing intense competitive games. I used to take some ibuprofen or aspirin before I intended to game. Also making sure I was hydrated. Sometimes I notice a feeling of pressure on my ears from my headset and gaming without wearing one seemed to help too. Also be liberal about adjusting all volume and graphics settings.
