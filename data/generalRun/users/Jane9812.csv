If she's an extrovert, it will be hard for her to intuitively understand this. So I suggest explaining to her that it's not about her specific energy, you're not rejecting her, it's just that you're introverted. 

Also, when you get home, say hello and then go take a shower, change clothes, lay down for a few minutes. That way you're not shutting her out while being in the same room as her."
