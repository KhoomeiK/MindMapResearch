Best case scenario is that she is still a medium level to modestly developed psychopath and will make some mistakes allowing you to narrowly escape enough times to preserve your own life before you have to either move out of the country into a jungle/desert/tundra with a tribe forgotten by time or get her arrested/committed for the crimes you can prove once they begin.

Here it's common sense first and there is a law as well, but it never needs to get enforced as everyone understands. In turn there are very few accidents annually and when there are it is 99% of the time a drunk driver who was a danger to anyone.
