I dont care if people have sex, but I mean this chick seriously fucking moaned like she was trying to make sure everyone knew. Making dinner and that's all you hear. Trying to sleep and that's all you hear. It was awful. And then she'd walk out smirking and make little comments about what she just did. 
I still have flashbacks from how loud she was."

I like Zoey Deutsch (I think that's her name) and I know her character is meant to be annoying but they shouldn't have shoved her character at you so much lol
Also ready or not is one of those cheesy comedy/horrors but I thought it was a lot of fun to watch so you should watch that when you get a chance."

AskReddit,fdbeahr,t1_fd092do,1578256574.0,I totally agree with this. I work night shifts and the only time I have to hang out with my boyfriend is when I get off so we naturally stay up kind of late and sleep in. Then I go to work again. I remember one morning my boss was trying to call me in to work at like 8 in the morning and when I didn't pick up she showed up at my house to bring me to work! And then she had the audacity to laugh at me because I was still sleeping at 8 am!
