As for me, what i love most about the letter from devs is the fact that they ensure us that the team behind Realm is passionate about it and wants to keep going, while that can be left to interpretation i still love when devs and companies take the moment to thank the fanbase and to ensure that they like what they do! It's like Bandai with Dragon ball Super Card Game.

ANd for the gameplay wise, well, not much to say, i just want the community to grow and maybe, eventually, my friends to come and play this amazing game; encouraging different reasons to log in and play is always nice, Hi Rez already did with Paladins removing the daily stuff, so now i can check one day just to play Paladins and actually feel like i am moving up in rewards than just log in, take reward and log off.

AS a side note, i also read about how everyone wants Bug Fixes... To be honest, i have the feeling that they bug fixed stuff these past months, at least on Nintendo Switch, several things started improving over time, certain details that were annoying to get around and so on, but most importantly, for a month now i haven't crashed once!

Also, would anyone play draft if there wasn't a reason to buy the product? Maybe.

DBS_CardGame,fficxzn,t3_ets259,1579970902.0,"First of all, and it's sad that this needs to be said over and over again: draft boxes are not booster boxes, they are designed to be played in a format called DRAFT, not to be bought and pull amazing plasets of cards. The issue with draft box 4 is the fact that their promos are WAY TO GOOD and the pull rate for them to be THAT good is concerning. That's why Piccolo, Toppo and the dual colors have prices to the roof. It's been voiced since release of it, but people have to understand first and foremost that DRAFT BOX IS TO DRAFT PLAY. I am sure Bandai will listen to us about the issues with the promos and pull rates, they have listened before, the problem will be that they could decide to just discontinue draft format if people complain so much about their pull rates and they have no feedback about the format, which is FUN by the way.

For the second part, and this one is also sad to see, why is everyone so concern about Dragon ball having Magic stuff? There was even a guy that said that he will quit the game if people keep using Magic terms, wtf?
Not everyone likes magic, it's understandable, but no one can or should deny the fact that magic the gathering is an amazing game that basically started it all. I don't mind when they do stuff like dual color or the new Planeswalker stuff, they are cool mechanics, if we look back and retrospective, DBS is a great game with unique ideas but a lot of other of its ideas are a mix up of Magic, Yugioh, Pokémon and even Vanguard. So what's the issue? You don't like Magic? Then don't play Magic, play dragon ball, see where the set goes, how the mechanic is actually implemented how the game evolves. I still see concerns about how the game is going down and stuff, from people that are stuck in set 2 ""Vegeta skill, crit, attack, pass"", it's ironic. Set 9 is not even out and you are already concern about how set 10 is going to change the game? Why don't you at least wait to be closer to set 10 release when the spoilers and theme is revealed?
If you wanna jump ship with those arguments and mentality, go ahead."

But when it came to the energy, you could argue that the energy is all Yellow even if you have a dual color, but then again, it checks both colors.

RealmRoyale,ffemloe,t3_esvmxg,1579854627.0,"Played this game for months and I still have high hopes for it... I am glad when I see people trying it out and loving it.

Little story time:

My switch downloaded fortnite last night, I deleted it to make room for stuff, but I bought a memory card several weeks ago so... Yeah, I have the space now.

I said to myself ""let's try this thing again"", I haven't played it since season 2 chapter whatever started, I got bored of the gimmick, never felt that my aiming mattered and building irrationally and one shot with shotgun annoyed me so much that I got bored of it.

My brother suggested me Realm and after a couple of games, when the class system actually felt like Something I couldn't stop.

A few weeks back I made it to masterd when it got my 50 win.

So, about fortnite, the most popular Royale game right now...
Since I play on switch, I didn't expect much anyway, it always ran poorly, but it was enjoyable and playable, except for a few patches. This time the game was... Worse, way worse, the graphics, frames and details are beyond bad right now, it isn't a big issue if you don't play competitive, but I am kinda into playing in a good level, so when the frames goes to shit, I get a bit pissed. Still, the game is enjoyable.
Many of the issues I had with it were gone, but the game keeps revolving by the fact that everything is build, edit and shot in such speed that the headshot shotgun stuff remains. The hit detection of the long and medium range weapons seems off, at least in switch, I never feel like aiming well rewards me unlike realm Royale, I build decent enough, but always ends up being the same close combat where it doesn't feel good at all shooting.
Vehicles are no more in mass, so crossing the map is annoying and sometimes lethal.
Fortnite always had an issue with connection, no other online game gave me such issues than fortnite, it just goes down and I start lagging for no reason, paladins, realm, rocket league never gave me issues.
And the cream on top, they added bots, the thing most people hate about Realm, the famous bots, they added them so you can have more pleasant games without tryhards killing you as soon as you land, if you win more you start having more humans of your skill against you, but that was just a rumor and st this point I am not even sure this is true or not... But... Fortnite bots are dumb as hell, when they shot you, they barely aim, move or build, and that's if they shot you, they usually see you and run away, so what's the point? At least realm ones have a decent aim and ib the correct circumstances they offer you some challenge, yeah, they bug out, but at least you rush to kill the since you know that they could kill you... And yes, once they are chickens, they run towards you, little issues but damn, still way better than fortnite ones.

Bounced back into realm and... This game not only runs really well and has next to no issues with connection, it has an unique charm. I know it crashes, specially on Switch, but I rather play 10 games and have a crash every once in a while than sit through dropping frame rates and certain areas with awful graphics which make it harder to kill/aim.

The class system, the different skills and plays styles that can go and vary depending on where the storm closes, if it's a closed space or an open one, a plain one or a high ground one, and so on and on... And aiming actually feels rewarding.

I like fortnite, I used to... Love it, but my interest went down a long time ago and Now that I played it again, I like it, but Realm is a special battle Royale that we took for granted and for a lot of reasons we have it in ""life support"" praying to get well and the attention it deserves. I, have hopes...

Battle Royale genre is declining, but I hope for one more push to have, at least, a large enough community so it doesn't die right away and we can enjoy it for more time."
SuicideWatch,ffelfr8,t3_et15jx,1579853044.0,"The go to a psychological therapist is the one that get to my nerves.

I know that there are a lot of people that doesn't have anyone, literally, to at least write and be left as seen on Facebook or some shit, but for fucks sake, therapists usually do the job of listening and make beyond obvious observations that most people are too lazy to do by themselves and then ask ""how does make you feel?"" so you respond and then go ""see? Now that you revealed how you feel, how does that make you feel?"" and so on.

If therapists have jobs nowadays is for the lack of reflexive minds among people.

The thing is, most of depressive and suicidal people think stuff SO MUCH and dig deep into themselves that they don't need to pay a shit ton of money to hear an asshole say condescending stuff to improve moral.

Go read philosophy and you will most likely save a lot of money on therapy...or go to a philosopher, they usually study psychology as well and shouldn't go full shit trying just to pull generic questions out of their asses but will seek a legitimate logic succession of critical and reflexive thinking to go through the issues.

The ironic thing is that Fornite's bits are awful, at least realm ones have the decency to shoot you or straight bug and go ape shit, its really, really awful to encounter such a dumb bots.

Oh, and I rather my game to run well for 10 games and crash everyone once in a while than my game running awfully 90% of the time.

It impresses me that they improved so many things but the game is actually running quick badly, frame rate is not OK at all, the graphics now look pretty bad in certain areas, and the connection is shit as usual.

I just can't believe that the game runs like this specially with their popularity and the time I didn't play I thought that there were more improvements, but no.
I mean, the game is playable and enjoyable, but for what epic is, this is becoming more and more unacceptable.

It is fun, not gonna lie, but the deck just needs too much time, you wanna go U/G and stall with the blockers, have epic hand destruction with the piccolo and the huge Dr. Uiro blockers.

The time I played against it, it started getting stressful when I had to deal with 4 blockers a turn, not to mention the guy didn't have the deck complete since it was missing the Dr. Uiro ones, the big ones that are SR if I am not wrong and just had one of each, there was one turn that he blocked 4 attacks and negated 2, and so on.
He managed to get the field up to 10 cards, it was scary.
But in the end, it is not impossible to beat it since it just needs too much time to function.

The time I played it myself in a sealed pre release, it was a lot of fun, since everyone didn't have big beefy things, I could just stall with blockers and negates while abusing the field to get rid of everything, literally. The problem always was hand size.
It was all fun and jokes until the guy got ss4 heart of plea (or whatever the name is), such a good card that destroyed me both times,i couldn't do much with the field, so I lost."

SuicideWatch,fdtz9zq,t1_fdscc3j,1578724707.0,"I got you, but I think it has a lot to do with the way you voice yourself.

For example, you can say that your favorite band is breaking up and that ""depresses you"", just as an expression with quite no investment more than genuine sadness but no actual depression.
Then you could have one of your favorite video games having a sad part that hits you or you start losing a lot so you creep into dark thoughts of being a failure starting a ""meaningless"" loss, and actually trigger (back) your depression."

I learned that the hard way.

Well I finally realized and accept that I actually have depression I started noticing how cheap and fake most people are when saying they live with depression, and as you picture it in your post, is fucking annoying.

I don't have the deepest of back stories when it comes to me, but I still struggle a lot and there have been months that I was on edge, crying every day at night wishing to come back to a better time, wishing to wake up dead, not sleeping until 5am after crying in a corner thinking what I have to do before I kill myself.

And then it comes all those assholes that say they have depression for reasons you point out, and yeah, a lot of tears could come out, but then you saw them writing shitty posts on Facebook looking for those usual likes, all being so lightly and using so much ""I'm depressed"" that you xba clearly tell that they are just attention whores. The first idiot that offers help in any way, they, specially women, send them away with a ""oh, thanks honey, you are a true friend"" or ""oh yeah, stop it with your little joke of being with me and treating me well"".

Ffs...
Sorry for the rant, I just saw those kind of posts from my contacts in FB and then I came to reddit and saw your post and I just had to voice out how much pisses me out those attention whores.

Funny how you can be so subtle with your cries for help, being so clear sharing pictures of ropes, songs about depression and so on just to be ignored... While an idiot with too much time on hands sharing memes on Facebook says ""I'm sad and depressed"" and poom, all the fakes become vocal.

Our society praises the ones that are something and not someone, whoever tells you that you can be someone is pretty much lying, since you still have to be an efficient piece in a overall practical life to at least try to be someone. You can't be someone if you are middle class or lower, you can't have that luxury.

Anyway, I watched soccer like a religious thing every Tuesday and Wednesday (Champions) and the European leagues on mid afternoon weekends, I loved so much how the game involved so much passion back in the day, most matches ended up with at least 2 goals.

After one of my favorite matches, Liverpool vs Milan in Champions final, I slowly started losing interest while the game became more and more strategic wise with 1 average goal every few matches. It became so boring that I just couldn't keep up wasting 2 hours or more in those days.

Turned out to esports were ties and those kind of slow boring matches are beyond rare since patches and updates usually make games stay fresh.
