Suicide should be modernized, where the person makes the decision, has a few weeks or months to say goodbye to family and friends, maybe a gathering to celebrate their life, and then a qualified professional gently puts them to sleep for the last time. Suicide is only seen as bad because there's no system for it. It's done via bloody mess or an overdose or other gross ways and it's kept a secret until the deed is done because it's so stigmatized, and it's only stigmatized because people are either a) indoctrinated by religion into believing that suicide is wrong or b) selfish for wanting to keep the suicidal person in their life regardless of how much pain the person is in."

Do they think that sex doesn't work unless you're 'trying' for a child?

There's no guarantee that truth will win over propaganda, or that we'll solve climate change, or that society will even hold up through it all. Personally I see death as a good thing. A sweet release from a life that was never consented to in the first place. All those animals experienced pain during the fire but they are better off now. Same with humanity, there will be pain while we die off but the final outcome is peace. If we make it to a more civilized future then cool! But I don't put my faith in it.

Probably not the pickup you're looking for but it's my honest view and it helps me cope with the failures of humanity. I still support any and all action to make things better, I just don't believe they'll work in time. Hopefully I'm wrong. No matter what happens, you gotta take care of you. Mourn a bit if you need to, keep taking breaks, donate to causes you believe in so you feel like your time working goes toward something to be proud of, talk about your feelings like you're doing now. Worrying about it all just isn't worth your happiness, you can't control it all so let it go. Focus on what is within your control.

Finally, sometimes you just need a doctor to give you happy pills. We didn't evolve for these fast paced high stress lives we're living. Antidepressants are usually prescribed for the rest of your life so maybe don't make that the first option, but don't ignore it either. I have PTSD from Afghanistan and antidepressants worked for me. I might be casually suicidal and believe humanity should voluntarily end itself but hey, fuck you if you disagree.

Nowhere in that definition does it say homophobia includes disgust at gay SEX. Stop being loose with the definition of homophobia.
