However jumping to full conclusions from a single wall of text from one perspective is not how we should be completely judging the character of somebody.   
 
That's like reading a news headline and deciding you know exactly what the article is about. 
It's ignoring the humanity and our bias. People can be a lot more complex than surface level.  
 
It's just gross to over simplify his wife as a single character type when we barely know anything about her. So any advice we give must be taken with a grain of salt. 
 
I don't know how else to explain this. I'm bad at explaining things. It's just not helpful to jump to conclusions. 
 
Even if she is a terrible person or not, I don't understand why my advice is being down voted. If she is a bad person, they still need to work on their relationship before opening it, since OP is asking if he should go through with ENM. OP is not asking if he should leave his wife. If she is a good person, it's the same result because all we know is how OP described his wife in a bad light. So a healthy communicative relationship for ENM is already not going to work if you're already expressing grief. 
 
It's the same conclusion both ways, I don't understand the confusion and disagreal here. You guys just don't believe there is any chance she's good? That doesn't change the advice. I'm not saying it's a definite either way.

I totally get what you're saying, I'm here because I am married and dating in a closed polyamorous relationship, and it is amazing. 
 
However, both my partners were not non-monogamous until I met them. So I'd advise editing your search to looking for a partner who expresses characteristics of being open and trusting and communicative. 
I'd advise defining your perfect partner based on personal traits and skills before you push the idea of marriage, kids, and multiple relationships on them. 
  
Of course there are single ENM women out there, however remember dating is a numbers game. More people you meet, the more likely you are to meet that person you just click with. Your perfect partner may be out there sure, just don't ignore everyone in front of you. Because self development can be a journey for two. Finding someone with similar mindsets or life goals allows big changes such as children and ENM to be more natural"

NoStupidQuestions,ffqxhg6,t1_ffqujqf,1580145854.0,"You're being shamed, but you're still putting on weight aren't you? 

Positivity is far more motivating than negativity.  

Being in a happy space, and loving your body actually promotes being more active. So naturally you'd leave the house more and inadvertently become healthier.   

Stress and shame actually reduces your health allowing you to gain more weight.   

Shame is counter productive.   

the only way to tackle hate and shame is to ignore it. So therefore, all this body hate towards you actually is promoting your defensive systems to kick in and ignore the negativity, thus forcing you to seek comfort which in turn passively makes you unhealthier.  

  

So not only are you getting fatter, being shamed makes you health even worse on top and makes it harder to lose the weight, if that's what you want to do.   

  

When you're happier, you make more active choices.   

Obesity is bad for your body if you want to live healthy. That's a decision you need to make on your own. Not a decision that needs to be forced upon you by society. That doesn't help.   

  

There's other ways to slice a cake. Obesity is only bad for your body. It doesn't need to be bad for your conscious. It doesn't need to be bad for your quality of life. You can have a high quality, happy, wealthy, fulfilling life while being obese."
NoStupidQuestions,ffqwa7s,t1_ffqtsjs,1580145086.0,"You speak about not wanting them to think they're healthy while they're fat. Okay, I always see people arguing against celebrating obesity, but I've never seen people actually celebrating obesity. But this is hearsay, so not much of an argument.

My counter argument is: Someone stating they're proud to be fat, and that it's alright to be overweight to other people is not promoting fat as healthy. It's body acceptance. Nobody is saying being fat is a healthier lifestyle than being fit. Nobody.  If someone is saying that, they're a small small insignificant percentage of the population. Especially if we go to other continents such as Asia where fat shaming is even more prevalent. In America, all of America, there is health sciences. Every single child is educated on health and fitness. It is also a mandatory course, even if you're homeschooled. Nobody is growing up believing that being fat is HEALTHY.

That is already covered.  So your concerns about misinformation are moot. So back to the meat of what I'm asking:

Why do you care that someone else is unhealthy?

&#x200B;

>In addition to this, the health of a society is a collective responsibility. In some places were healthcare is government funded, poor general health is a burden on everyone.

As I said, overweight citizens are contributing equality to the economy. Concern for others health self seems more of a selfish motivation, rather than caring for others wellbeing. If they're happier overweight, they're not a burden to others. In America life expectancy is at its highest, while not having socialized healthcare, and while having the highest percentage of overweight people in the world. Population is not a concern, we don't need more people alive. There's a good balance of births and deaths. I'd argue from these facts that spreading body positivity would not lower life expectancy or raise the obesity rates in America. I believe it would lower obesity rates, because people work harder when they're happier."
NoStupidQuestions,ffqttwu,t1_ffqsxni,1580143496.0,"I agree with you. However, overweight women online spreading body positivity online get death threats, and while I was in elementary school, larger kids would get physically beat up and picked on.

I was there for the forum raids before we had to constantly post ""we're not your personal army"" to every request. I was there for pools closed. And I was there for the Boxxy uprising which split the community and made me fade out.  
 
4chan was fun, but always slightly racist. I was never offended because I was so confident in my trolling I could reverse troll trolls who only relied on edgy words to trigger their victims. Calling everyone a nigger was just to get an easy rise out of people. Even I believed the rhetoric about it just being a word, and being offended meant you were giving the word power, and I ran around calling everyone newfags and blah blah blah. 
Words had no meaning, they only meant something when they got a hook, and the meaning was, ""you mad bro?"".
 
Everything was about trolling... 4chan lost its way though. Trolling doesn't matter anymore. They're dead serious with the homophobia and racism. It isn't jokes, the new generation on 4chan actually believe all that crap and its actually becoming a dangerous threat... /pol/ is as big of not now bigger than /b/ and it's a giant cess pool.

That's where I opted out of this thread the first time since I'm very strongly idealistic in my views and certainly don't understand how a ENM relationship could work codependent in the long run. I feel like nonmonogamy can be a tool to wedge some space in an overly codependent relationship and build self confidence. I whole heartedly believe two strong confident individuals together who are great on their own, and only add extra happiness when together, make a stronger team than a couple who depends on eachother for their happiness. My goal has always been interdependency.  
I have no advice for you because I cannot put myself in your shoes and evaluate a meaningful conclusion.  
 
But I'll leave with this: perhaps have a night to talk about your fears again. Talk about your ideal selves and brainstorm what would it take to become those people. Talk about what your dream relationship together would look like. 
 
I have no advice for you, so I challenge you to renew these questions with yourselves and create your own advice for the answers.  
 
In my experience, a fear or insecurity is always a little bit deeper than the surface symptoms. Solving the problem of you dating more than her seems like a bandaid and the cut underneath remains. Perhaps even a dirty bandaid that'll just make more problems"

It may not be about the numbers of dates with others. It may be able the number of dates of you two together. 
Her jealously may be a result of you having so many great fun dates with other people, but failing to take her out more and/or have an equal amount of fun/creativity when you're together.

MMORPG,ff6ojo8,t3_erwau5,1579631595.0,"I honestly believed MMOs would've survived if new games followed the GW2 model, but did it better.  
I don't understand why new MMOs still use the old garbage quest system: run to npcs, go out collect x number of items from hunting a mob, run back to npc. 
That is so boring, but you're forced to because of the exp gain. In so many games I'd rather find one leveling spot and grind it. GW2 said exploring can level you, crafting can level you, every area you run into you get automatic quests, and even automatic events with moving functions.   
In the world we live in, we use text, phones, and computers to communicate to eachother. Why am I knocking on doors and talking to ppl in video games. Send a gawd damn mail pigeon if you wanna stay immersive! Even Pokemon has cellphones.   
   
Mabinogi was the biggest MMO in the world in Korea for a small period, beating even WoW at one point, and their entire lvling system was based on using your abilities to level them up (old skool FlyFF anyone?) . So whatever you liked doing more actually resulted in progress for your character. 
 
Questing in that game was also hardcore story line driven. Because let's be honest, most quest driven players kind of just want to play an RPG but with friends online. Those uninterested in quests shouldn't be punished. Look at how successful Ragnarok online still is. People can also enjoy grinding and pvp.   
    
Imagine if ToS had a zone where everyone was max level and could make any build, then do quest challenges or pvp (not so much pvp because that game was super imbalanced, and the pve was more fun). Even for a game like path of exile, the most fun part is making your builds and playing them when it comes together. The actual clearing dungeons and stuff part isn't even fun until you have all the skills and items you needed for your vision.  
  
That GW2 spvp zone for creating and testing builds should be in all new MMOs and expanded. Let people who just want to create have fun. How many times has City of Heroes come back alive? That's mostly all because how fun making new characters in that game is.   
  
People just don't have the time anymore to commit 1000 hours into a game to find out their build is gimped or the game is shutting down next week.   
  
I would never risk a lot of my time in a game which might shutdown before I even achieve my goals. Also, PVP is super important! A competitive scene is the only way to keep an Mmorpg alive. Every single top online game in the world right now is competitive. A whole team needs to be dedicated to making PVP fair and not P2W. I don't know why that's not obvious. Even the players who don't like pvp will appriciate the game having a good system for PVP because that means more players will play!"
MMORPG,ff6m7zm,t1_ff6jfwq,1579630188.0,"Yes. This is where Tree of Savior got it right. There's so many varied builds and compositions and skill synergies in that game which made it a ton of fun to create new Toons and reskill current ones. What they got wrong was how heavy the grind was to hit cap, and the lack of content to get there. In Shadowbane takes 1-2 days to hit max level, then most of the game content is there. ToS was very promising for new mmo Era except it had zero end game content, so all that creativity behind builds was never achieved and , hidden behind tons of pay walls."

Imo his tinder profile is not that cringe. It pin-points exactly what type of partner he is looking for.  
 
The joker picture could just be a halloween photo he enjoyed, I would find this cringe as well if dressing up as it wasn't already extremely popular in American culture, even before the Joker movie.  
 
Lying about his age could just be his technical inability to edited his age on his Facebook. Dude is 40, I don't expect him to carefully navigate his Facebook settings. In IT you quickly learn most adults are too lazy to tweak website settings. At least he tells the truth in his profile. 
 
The kinky (top), gentleman, pervert thing is all under the same umbrella. He's explaining what style of BDSM he persues. Someone interested in him would want to be looking for a gentleman dom, and be accepting of a pervert fetish.  
 
Being a pervert is one of the more common bdsm fetishes out there atm. Check your local pornsite for proof. Being a pervert is taboo, so because of that it has risen in popularity. They're the people who enjoy being cucked or sniff panties or whatever. Not my style, but it is what it is.    
  
And being ENM is completely fine. People have different relationship styles, if it works for them, then that's great. It's hard to be into BDSM without being non-monogamous because the variety of kinks that you'll need several different partners for.    
  
I don't find this cringe because he's not looking to attract you guys. He has detailed exactly what type of partners he wants and there will be people who are interested in these same things as well.   
  
I understand how you all can view this as cringe because he's different and putting himself out there. But for all we know, he could be a great guy. Clearly he's on Tinder for sexual exploration. Stop judging his entire character on a single page of information.

nonmonogamy,fdqdnl6,t1_fdqbc0j,1578663907.0,">I would never ""swing"", because we're not into swapping and transactional sex.

Sorry for assuming you were a swinger since you were using swinger rules to other posts to explain your argument.  
 


>The goal of her being happy is very much conditioned on her own partner.

I disagree. That's codependancy: happiness of a relationship depending on one another, this is often cause for failure in relationships. Interdependence is built off strong individuality and individual happiness, the goal being that your partner does not create your happiness, only adds to it.  
 


>also not really addressing the ""Happy Home"" key element of my entire post 

You don't need to work on a ""happy home"" if both partners are happy people. A happy home is just a natural outcome.  
 


>You rate someone's integrity by being around them, getting to know them a bit, and watching them, reading between the lines.
  
  
This would be applicable if they were engaged in a tri-poly relationship. Clearly they were a vee relationship. Meaning her partner was in a relationship with her and not her spouce. I don't understand how you can not see how watching and judging someone is a toxic mentality to be in. Where is the positive from controlling a relationship like this? Avoiding insecurity is a bandaid, and bandaids fall off. Addressing the real issue, trust issues, would be a long term cure.   


>Don't you have any criteria to measure the trustworthiness of others? It's a very important skill to have.

If a person seems trustworthy, I trust them until they prove otherwise. Some Serial killers are the most charming people in the world, but luckily, most people aren't killers, so it's safe to trust that your wife, a grown woman who likely has vetted hundreds of men in her lifetime can come to a conclusion on who she feels safe with, and you have to just accept and trust her decision.   
 
  

>Her partner would need to prove something to me - that he's trustworthy - for me to be at peace, and she won't feel at peace if she knows I do not.

What would he need to do to prove he's trust worthy to you? Get on one knee and promise he won't hurt you? Buy you tons of gummy bears and awakwardly explain why he loves your wife at the dinner table? 
Do everything to be in your good graces, because you're the lord of this relationship, so he must make sure not to make any mistakes?   
 
  

>What I would be looking for is, as I said above - is this person stable? Do they make shit life choices? Is he a saboteur?

And you believe the wife doesn't care about these traits in seeking a ENM partner? You seem to be forgetting these are real people.   
   


>And thank you for the good engagement. While we disagree, I think our disagreement comes from a place of having different values. These are hard discussions, because unless that's recognized quickly, it becomes a virtue war where it's always Good vs Evil and the other side is always the bad one. Cheers.

I agree. I'm totally against your view of polyamory, I don't believe in chains, I believe in being as close to unconditional love as possible. If my wife left me tomorrow because she'd be happier with another, I'd be happy for her. That's the mindset I started nonmonogamy with, so I understand most people would not have the same core values as me. Therefore, on public forums I speak through the wide netted polyamory literature I've read, my favorite being, More Than Two. So most of the ideals I spread could be read within those pages. 
 
If it works for you, then it works. But for OP, I believe it is his insecurities, mistrust, and unconscious controlling nature which resulted in his failed marriage. Rather than the fault being his spouce, I believe he is the common denominator, and if he does not change his ways, this cycle will repeat itself once again."
nonmonogamy,fdq9vwd,t1_fdn8ti4,1578660598.0,"I love the way you have thoughtfully put your response together, however, very far off the mark and I'll explain why: the health of the relationship does not come before everything else. I feel you are approaching this situation as a swinger, as I am approaching it as poly. Their relationship is an open relationship leaning towards ENM / polyamory. She's having a emotional and physical relationship with another partner, not swinging, so Polyamorous traits are dominant in this situation. Therefore, the people in the relationship are more important than relationship itself.  
The goal is for her to be happy which leads to an overall happier relationship. This is built on trust and choice.   
Because this is poly leaning, he has nothing to do with the other partner. This is a vee structure because as he has shown he wanted nothing to do with her meta. I don't know what you even mean by ""the other guys intentions"". It's quite clear that his intentions are to date his wife. What else is there?  
Their rule was was they could date and make love. Boundaries are personal, you can only control aspects of your own life. The rules OP was making were overstepping his boundaries, they were making rules for their spouce and their spouces partners, that's invasive rules, nothing personal about that.   
  
A Group chat is emotionally limiting. You cannot be emotionally vulnerable to somebody you don't know. A relationship will suffer by being focused into few core aspects within a group chat. For you a swinger, that works, your relationships are about sex. For her, clearly that was not the case, this would never work.   
  
>I am also pretty sure that while you give this level of ""holier than thou"" advice on Reddit, if you met this couple face to face and had a real conversation and got to know them and didn't see them as faceless ""others"", you would have enough of a heart to admit that they should first do what's best for their relationship when engaging these forays - taking it slow, getting to know people. You would probably tell them about Kitchen Table Poly as a good means for couples to build mutual trust in their metas. But since this guy is just a ""faceless other"" on Reddit, you don't care about the health/happiness of his relationships. You just care about promoting your ideal of autonomy (which I fully support autonomy)


These are some extreme assumption about me. You have absolutely no idea how I would interact with this couple in real life. Projection 101, I believe you ought to practice what you preach and work on this ""holier than thou"" stance.   
  

>I find many Relationship Idealists are so bent on promoting values that they often forget they're talking to real people with human needs, who're in relationships that also have needs and histories. Keep your values, but remember you're not just shouting into a void, you're interacting with real people.

I agree with this.   
 


>He also needs to be aware that people with less integrity can drag down people with more integrity. However, he also needs to not dwell on this stuff - invite the other person over for dinner, see what he's made of, get a feel for him and a sense of how they interact. Become comfortable with it. Kitchen Table Poly is often the best approach for a couple, because when everyone's on one page, things can be great with everyone accepting things and having good intentions and integrity.

You've completely lost me here. What are you talking about? How do you practically in a real world situation rate someone else's integrity, and why does her partner need to prove anything to you?  
I never heard mention of them setting up ground rules that he is the primary partner and a new partner is not seen as an equal. I also never heard anything about the new partner needing to be vetted and approved by OP. 
These are all actions done by a mistrustful man."
nonmonogamy,fdq6ft7,t3_emgzz4,1578656915.0,"This is actually quite common in dating, and I'm not speaking just nonmonogamy. What is happening here is that he has you. Sounds bad, but it's that simple, for some reason some men work completely out of passion, which is one of the boons of ENM for them; they don't have to try to be all creative and have all this energy to court another partner, none of it is forced, it becomes all natural, but with you, someone they already have succeeded in creating a lasting relationship with, they don't have that automatic passion. This is that common stalemate stage you hear about in monogamous relationships when NRE stage is over and a partner complains they're never taken out anymore. This is the part of a long term relationship which takes ""work"" and surviving relationships succeed by falling in love  ""once again"". You both need to actively work hard and communicate to make it through this stage.   
   
Luckily for you, you both are ENM correct? Therefore you could happily survive through this stage by experiencing NRE with another partner. Jealousy is very frowned upon in this community, however, not all jealousy is bad, how you harness that energy could be used positively or negatively. In this case he may respond by resetting back to understanding he needs to work to keep you, and thus his actions would become natural and not forced and court you once again.   
If you watch a bunch of romance movies, think of it as the scene where the couples therapist says the couple should try dating others to fall back in love again. How silly that sounded in movies, but it actually has some successful real world applications for long term relationship situations like this. Of course you can't date someone else with the goal of causing jealousy, that would be unfair to your new partner, the mindset is to date others to experience infatuation and focus on your own happiness, which will allow you to worry less about your SO.   
   
I know I speak as if this is a ""matter of fact"", but it is not, I don't know how your partner actually thinks, and I don't know if you're already dating another partner and already been through the infatuation stage, however, I believe it's worth an attempt if your partner means a lot to you, but most of all, if your happiness means a lot to you. Being ENM allows for more flexibility in a relationship without giving up on it, so if you have not already tried this, it's worth a shot. But if you have and you saw no change in your partner, then it would be time for the hard decision to leave since your wellbeing matters. If talking and informing your partner that you feel neglected has not worked, then action must be taken."

But I guess I do find most plastic surgery done on social media done out of insecurity, and I believe it bothered me that my friend who represented being a full confident complete woman succumbed to such a frivolous thing. So it wasn't really about upholding qualities that I value, more that I was disappointed that she gave into one of her demons rather than embracing it.  

So you were very correct about this being an unconscious conflict.  Just because I chose not to do something, does not mean somebody else can't. I saw myself in her, so it was harder for me to comprehend an action I would never do.  

  

Now I understand where the emotion was coming from, I've been able to release the tension and be supportive. Because it fkn looks great, and it makes her very happy and that's all that matters."
