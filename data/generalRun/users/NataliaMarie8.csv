offmychest,ffi7di8,t1_ffi5oyy,1579967022.0,"Because I hang out with my friends' children and it's good for the few hours and fun, but I am so relieved after that is over that I don't have to keep going and taking care of that kid myself. 

Humans are more than just biologically run, that's why we have higher functioned thinking. Or else men would go around and impregnate as many women as they possibly could, and every woman would have as many babies as she could from the time she started menstruation.

But that doesn't happen, because some of us are wired to want something different than children. I don't want to offend anyone in the LGBTQ+ spectrum, who have gone through the experience, because I personally haven't. But I imagine it being similar for some of them, where at a young age they just always knew that they weren't heterosexual even though biologically that's how people reproduce. But again we have higher functioned thinking so homosexuality and other LGBTQ+ is completely real. 

I'm excited to be the aunt to my friends' children and if I do want to experience motherhood eventually, I'll go with adoption. There are so many children already alive that need a good home as it is. Plus the environment is a huge one for me, the situation is not getting any better and I do not feel it morally good to put a kid on this planet to have to deal with our mess, amongst other reasons. It's nice not feeling rushed to find a husband so I can be confined to my biological clock. Hopefully I'll find a great man and my marriage won't end in divorce because I took that time. 

And lastly as cliche as it sounds, you know yourself better than anyone else. So you can know that something is not meant for you without doing it from other experiences and or just how you feel about it."
offmychest,ffi625o,t1_ffi50xm,1579966049.0,"Apparently though a lot of people have claimed it is their job. Because they keep telling me,after I've expressed my reasons why I don't want to, that as a women I am ""obligated"" to have children."
offmychest,ffi5xiu,t1_ffi46ld,1579965948.0,"Exactly I love my lifestyle that I have and I just know I wouldn't be able to live it because I would have to dedicate my life to that kid. I can't do that, mentally the only being I can take care of and be responsible is for myself."
offmychest,ffi5q2u,t1_ffhnya5,1579965791.0,"I'm glad that you were able to make the choice. High five back at you girl, some women can know instantly at a young age that motherhood is not for them and not change their mind later on in life."
offmychest,ffi5lgw,t1_ffhpx60,1579965695.0,"Awe I'm so glad you found somebody that shares your desire. I was scared to tell potential partners my desire to not want to ever have kids. But then I recently made the realization of why would I even want to spend the time dating somebody who wants kids, because we would eventually break up over fundamental differences. So now I'm going to be straight forward about it to guys."
offmychest,ffi5bc9,t1_ffhq8nk,1579965480.0,"Not everyone is built the same, which means not every women wants to be a mom. Having a uterus does not mean you will be a good mom or that you automatically want to be a mom, and that's the category I know I fit under."
unpopularopinion,ffi4va4,t1_ffhqcv7,1579965135.0,"You can write that as your own post, I disagree completely."
unpopularopinion,ffi4tdd,t1_ffhx5br,1579965092.0,"That's what I was going for, unpopular opinion"
unpopularopinion,ffhjmx4,t3_etl69w,1579938279.0,"Anything can be toxic if taken to an extreme, definitely not disagreeing with your opinion."
unpopularopinion,ffhcj1g,t1_ffh9ed0,1579929886.0,"I've had cake at weddings, I'll eat it but it still makes me feel more ill than a piece of ice cream cake."
unpopularopinion,ffhcefz,t1_ffh7f9k,1579929758.0,It's like we all have different tastes in food or something.
unpopularopinion,ffhc42n,t1_ffhaq0g,1579929474.0,It's what I have every year for my birthday so yes it definitely counts as a cake
unpopularopinion,ffhc2cs,t1_ffhbctq,1579929428.0,I would still choose ice cream cake
unpopularopinion,ffh4rcs,t1_ffh4izt,1579923089.0,"Ice cream is just probably one of my favorite things in the world so even having a really fancy cake, won't sway my opinion too, too much."
unpopularopinion,ffh4hjw,t1_ffh4e2r,1579922879.0,Ice cream is just my favorite thing ever so it probably still wouldn't sway my opinion too much.
offmychest,ffh3qxs,t1_ffh3ia3,1579922301.0,"See that's what I'm getting at though, I know some people do change their minds. But for me it's only been growing stronger with time to not want them. I have a lot of friends who are like hell no I don't want kids now, but I probably will in the future. I've had some change their minds already.

 But I see myself differently from those friends because it's like a part of me has always known. If I do end up changing my mind about being a mother I will definitely be going down the adoption route because the environment is a huge reason I don't want to have my own kids."
offmychest,ffh2osc,t1_ffh2mhy,1579921490.0,"Thank you! I definitely will, now that I'm not afraid to speak up about what I want."
offmychest,ffh2keb,t1_ffh25id,1579921396.0,"I'll be doing IUD for now, I just did a quick google search and yeah I definitely do not have the means for that operation right now."
offmychest,ffh2ied,t1_ffh1xqw,1579921354.0,Yeah you go girl!
offmychest,ffh2hfy,t1_ffh1wtt,1579921334.0,I actually deleted all of that before 2020 started. Decided I'm not going to have any of that toxicity in this new decade.
offmychest,ffh2fpy,t1_ffh1j31,1579921296.0,"I know the fight I'm fighting, but it's important to speak out because that's how society starts changing and being more accepting of non traditional expectations. So I will speak up about it because I know there are many women who feel the same way as me."
offmychest,ffh18oz,t1_ffh169t,1579920397.0,"I won't, I'm just ranting that I'm tired of hearing the same responses over and over again when I do."
offmychest,ffh0lma,t1_ffgyuzu,1579919906.0,"Exactly children need a lot of love, attention and patience to be raised properly and I know I wouldn't be able to provide that environment. You're right, as long as your decisions aren't affecting anyone else directly in a negative way, then it shouldn't matter."
offmychest,ffh0gqa,t1_ffgyee5,1579919802.0,"Also another point well made, it affects my life not theirs if I have a child."
offmychest,ffh0eb4,t1_ffgw0cr,1579919753.0,This! But anytime babies are involved society loses their shit and suddenly it's everyone's business and no longer the woman's choice.
offmychest,ffh0aar,t1_ffh078z,1579919668.0,"That actually meant a lot, thank you."
offmychest,ffgytie,t1_ffgx1ou,1579918566.0,I definitely won't stop fighting it. I'm currently on the IUD and I made sure I was on at least the pill before I was having sex because getting pregnant scared me so much.
AskMen,ffgsk75,t1_ffg6kyj,1579913967.0,"I loved Netflix's adaptation of the books, they were pretty true to them unlike the movie that came out in the 2000s, couldn't stand that one."
AskMen,ffgrn96,t3_etcmuk,1579913309.0,Riverdale because it had such potential from the first season but just started going crazy in the second season.
MissingPersons,ffgjp9a,t3_et9xld,1579907798.0,This is so creepy I'm on Reddit while watching a different YouTube video on this exact missing girl and this pops up on my feed. I hope this mystery is solved one day.
memes,ffgi3v3,t3_etfffg,1579906745.0,Here I am having grown up with neither.
dating_advice,ffgb81x,t3_etftpk,1579902414.0,I completely agree to just let all your feelings out even though you might be rejected or come off as looking crazy. At least you find out instead of left wondering where things could have gone.
AskReddit,ffd8vra,t3_esr647,1579815707.0,"Planning things. So much effort and time, but I nail it. I just wish someone else would take the reigns for once."
AmItheAsshole,ffd8d5k,t3_esupuo,1579815407.0,NTA you can't expect people to forgive you just because you say sorry. You should just apologize when you've done something wrong and not expect and apology back because that is that right thing to do.
