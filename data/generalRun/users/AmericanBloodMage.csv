Omaha,ffqoz88,t3_euj932,1580140252.0,"You won't really have to worry about ""avoiding"" North O too much really but yes the crime is pretty bad there. It's a majority black population due to early redlining. They live in a food desert and have a hard time getting transportation as well as obtaining a good job since a lot of the good jobs are out west or downtown. So yes, crime is what they know because they, like everyone else, must survive. 

Omaha is heavily segregated with a large black population in Northern Omaha, a wealthier people/large white population in West Omaha, middle class/large latino population living in Southern Omaha and in the middle is the University which has it's own little mix of the cultures.

Bellevue is actually pretty up and coming for being a mid sized town. They have some good restaurants and a reasonable cost of living. Taxes/registration is a lot less in Bellevue seeing as they don't have the ridiculous wheel tax that is imposed in Douglas County. 

Bellevue has an amazing sushi place called Umami if you're into that. It has a great backstory.

The nightlife is around Benson which is closer to Northern Omaha but has been gentrified a lot to make it more appealing. There is also some nightlife downtown. We have started opening a lot more Ramen places but my favorite is still Ika."

This will also expose you to different people who have taken different paths and you can talk with them about different possibilities for your future."
BlackHair,feodzuc,t3_eq3jae,1579298798.0,"This happened to me. I didn't realize it until I saw the distinction of 4c hair between the damaged weak thin hair underneath. 

It will be daunting at first to cut it. What worked for me was just getting braids and wearing those for a while.

As long as you take care of your hair it will grow right back. You are doing this for the health of your hair and now you've learned never to go to that person to get a flat iron.

You won't have to do this again, from here, you can only go up. I also found getting active and taking supplements decreased shedding which allowed my hair to look thicker and grow a bit faster than the first time I grew it out.

Either way, it will look good, and knowing you can rock a shorter cut is going to boost your confidence soooo much!"
