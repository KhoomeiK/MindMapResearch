danganronpa,fegeuqd,t3_eorims,1579090345.0,"Gonna disagree on Byakuya, I'm pretty sure someone once talked about and explained how he is surprisingly strong, and he actually works out to keep his body in shape as well. But I don't think this is ever mentioned in the games, and I can't remember where it was mentioned."
furry_irl,fedbhif,t3_eobo9r,1579006644.0,What I love about fox/wolf ship is that it usually means people will also pair falco/leon and that's just a GOOD pairing uvu

rimjob_steve,fdwtni9,t1_fdvk7rl,1578762235.0,jokes on you my humor relies ENTIRELY on making an awful joke and then explaining it extensively for no reason
danganronpa,fdvvius,t1_fdvvgfr,1578751999.0,"you good fam, i just think its hilarious because he IS accurate 30% of the time, and he was right that time"
danganronpa,fdvve82,t1_fdvu8yk,1578751931.0,wasn't it Yasuhiro that said that
wholesomememes,fds5m8z,t1_fds48pe,1578694884.0,"Thanks for backing me up here, obviously he won't listen to me so having someone else is a nice change. uvu"
wholesomememes,fds3eyy,t1_fds2v31,1578693728.0,"I mean, the thing is I KNOW the underlying problems. I'm a furry because I have autism, just like many other furries. We latch onto the concept from cartoons as children, and when we grow up it sticks with us because our brains work differently and not as most people's do. It's actually pretty crazy how many of my online furry friends also have autism."
godtiersuperpowers,fds2ue0,t1_fdry266,1578693532.0,Thank you! I appreciate it. :>
wholesomememes,fds2e8l,t1_fds1hg1,1578693258.0,"I'm pretty sure there are more politicians who are actual pedophiles than furry pedophiles. Also while yes, a lot of furry content can be degenerate, it's still fantasy. Not that I support it at all, I'm not that type. I just enjoy furry content the same anyone would enjoy their favorite games or music. It's a common misconception that furries actively hurt other people. Most of the time we go out of our way to avoid even interacting with people, considering the reactions you can get like your guys'. It can be hurtful, you know! I'm a real person too. uvu

Edit: Oops, didn't realize the other guy was being sarcastic. You're good dude!"
wholesomememes,fds0e1o,t3_emtoc1,1578692380.0,"This is what being a furry is like except people think you're an awful monster sometimes, but it makes me happy so who cares?"
godtiersuperpowers,fdrxjg1,t3_emra8u,1578691277.0,"Okay, so imagine you've just finished a night out at the bar and are on your way home. You're more tipsy than you realize, but you'll be fine, right? No. You swerve and hit a pedestrian on the side of the road who you didn't even see there. You instantly stop your car and get out, in a drunken panic because whoever you hit is in extremely bad condition. They're screaming and writhing on the ground, and blood is everywhere. You think you can see bone sticking out. All of a sudden this dude just yells 'MEDIC!' and you drunkenly try to get your phone to call an ambulance. But for some fucking reason you hear a cartoonishly accented german voice call out 'INCOMING!' from behind you. You don't even get to process what the hell is happening as what looks to be a 3D model runs down the street at an alarming pace. He quickly reaches your crash site while you stare in disbelief, not having even the slightest idea what your eyes were processing. You're still drunk, so you just watch as the funny-sounding cartoon german man pulls out a machine that looks like that backpack from that ghost busting movie you saw years ago with your now ex-girlfriend. He aims the machine at the dying stranger and within seconds they are perfectly fine, jumping back onto their feet with absolutely no injuries. They're still covered in their own blood, but it doesn't phase them and they just walk away. The mysterious german man suddenly starts doing this kick dancing and russian music plays from seemingly nowhere. He slowly dances his way away, and you're left there dumbfounded. You have no fucking idea what happened and there's not even any evidence that it did besides the blood on the street and the dent in your car. 

Wrote this up because the idea was fucking hilarious to me, hope you guys enjoy."
