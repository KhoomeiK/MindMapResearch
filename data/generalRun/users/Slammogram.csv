I was born and raise in Baltimore. I lived there for 31 years.  But spent the last 6 here in So CA.  I laugh every-time I see “md style” in a restaurant.  But we did go to this place called the Blue Water grill, that does “MD style” crab cakes, and it’s actually made with blue crab and honestly, it’s not bad!  I wouldn’t say it’s the same, but not bad."

I know this because my dad died the end of March 2019.  One of my dad’s siblings was trying to weasel her way into taking belongings. But obviously all of his stuff went to my mom."
AmItheAsshole,fgj6ous,t1_fgj30ez,1580838008.0,We don’t know that.  At no point does OP say his relationship with his dad vanished when he left.
AmItheAsshole,fgj6iii,t1_fgiv6ac,1580837909.0,"I mean it kinda depends on the country and state.

I’m in the US.  My father died in March 2019.  When that happened my mom got 100% of what was his.  

In this instance it sounds like OP’s mom died first.  When that happened, doesn’t that technically mean everything that was hers goes to her spouse?

So when he died his inheritance should be split between his 3 kids?

I’m honestly asking."
AmItheAsshole,fgj64dv,t1_fgiyshj,1580837692.0,"I hate this idea on reddit that “OP isn’t responsible to kids” and to just label them kids.  Like they are a faceless entity.  THEY ARE OP’s HALF SIBLINGS!  Let’s label it right and repeat your sentence.

“OP has no responsibility to his siblings.” It sounds different that way, doesn’t it?"
AmItheAsshole,fgj5jje,t1_fgiyffc,1580837385.0,"But, didn’t OP’s mom die first?  So since she died first everything she owns goes to her spouse.  So once she died, it all goes to dad and when he dies it gets split amongst his children?  I’m honestly asking"
AmItheAsshole,fgj559d,t1_fgiu5fn,1580837170.0,And his half siblings.
AmItheAsshole,fgj4u8e,t1_fgj27bw,1580837006.0,"Right. She expected to raise her kids with a partner.  When the partner died, usually there’s a policy in place to help raise the children.  And there was.  OP took it all.  So those kids are out on their asses."
AmItheAsshole,fgj4peu,t1_fgiykhf,1580836937.0,Right just as much right as the siblings.  But he took all the money and left his half siblings nothing.

My uncle was one of those down and dirty heroin addicts, and at his worse he looked like a typical addict.  But depending on who is around them, basically enabling them, they can stay looking fairly normal.  You sometimes may not even know it.

I just meant in my joke that he looked like a scuzzball.  It’s a look I like to call Heroin Chic.  Like they aren’t an addict, but they’re trying hard to look like a really trashy person."
