PacificCrestTrail,feg936j,t1_feg4cm3,1579082945.0,No but they have rangers in random areas of the trail that will ask to see it and I think can kick you off trail if you don’t have one

PacificCrestTrail,fef7cpf,t1_fef572x,1579049908.0,And sobo conditions are a lot more unpredictable that nobo start conditions they can’t expect people to hike when its really not safe.
PacificCrestTrail,fef70cw,t1_fef572x,1579049678.0,I heard you can get permits in Washington unrelated to the pct just so you’re allowed in those areas

dogs,fdm801r,t1_fdm7tc0,1578542062.0,I try to get him interested in toys but whenever I’m in there he just wants belly rubs. I just feel bad because it feels wrong for him to be confined in a room.
dogs,fdm7cmu,t1_fdm6u6a,1578541592.0,"What can I do to not make it sad. Whenever I let him in the house to socialize he just goes back into his room. I walk him and pet him frequently, I just don’t like the idea of him sleeping all day."
