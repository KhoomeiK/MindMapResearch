WeirdWheels,ffnhax3,t1_ffmnswn,1580065969.0,"I’m guessing it’s basically two stretched chassis (limos) stuck together side-by-side. So 8 wheels total. The inboard (hidden) wheels would provide necessary support for the width. And when you have 2 axles side-by-side, you could maybe only have one axle powered and it wouldn’t push the car much? I don’t know. But even if it did, would it matter for a car that was probably never driven much above idle for very short distances? Furthermore, I’d also guess he used GM E-Bodies (Cadillac Eldorado, Oldsmobile Toronado, Buick Riviera) since they were front wheel drive. That would explain the flat floor and lack of tunnels or humps. At that point, you’d need to link up both front-axles to the steering. That would probably be the biggest mechanical linkage between the two chassis, which is pretty minimal compared to marrying up drivetrain components. You’d probably have to boost the steering pump or use one from a heavy-duty truck or tractor or something. Same with the brakes, then run a bunch of brake lines. (Or for the basic show-car status of this, maybe only one axle of the four had brakes.) Then add a bunch of bracing and body work and bada-bing bada-boom, you got a double-wide fit for the Cocaine King of the 80s."

askcarsales,fdqmgyl,t1_fdpf4sa,1578670161.0,"Back around the early 2000s when my girlfriend (now wife) and I were in college she was buying a car. I can't even remember what it was, some little Mitsubishi or something. It was used at a Subaru dealership and it was like $5k. We were like 19 or 20 at the time and I looked every bit of it - backward fitted hat, probably a Death Row or Wu-Tang t-shirt, Air Jordans - you get the picture, not the type of person you'd give the keys to an STI to. Well that's exactly what a salesman did - and it wasn't even the salesman my girlfriend was working with. I was just checking out the STI on the floor and a salesman came over and said ""Sweet car, want to drive one? I have one out on the lot you can drive."" I said ""Yeah. But just so we're straight, I have no intention of even attempting to buy it. My girlfriend is here buying a used car and I'm just drooling over this."" He scanned my driver's license and gave me the keys. I took it out, didn't beat on it or anything. I got on it a little bit when getting on the highway - that was it. I was back in like 5 minutes. At the time, it was the nicest fastest car I'd ever driven. That was a sharp contrast from the Mitsubishi dealership we were at earlier that day. I asked the salesman if they've sold many Evos and he said no because they require you to sign before you drive it. Looking back, I think he just told me that to shut me up and kill any chance of me asking to drive it, which I had no intention of. But, as mentioned, I looked like a punk, got treated like one and don't blame him. I also now realize that the salesman that let me drive the STI probably had one foot out the door or something."
