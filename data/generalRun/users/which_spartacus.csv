This is how stand-up comedy works -- the comedian spends an amount of time building up the reality for the audience before twisting it around.

I will grant that sex and gender are different concepts, which I have said multiple tiimes, I thought.

Hopefully you will grant that until fairly recently, these were assumed to be synonyms.

My point is that ""gender wasn't assigned"".

In the year 2001:

Step 1: The doctor looks at the groin of an infant.

Step 2: Doctor observes testicles.

Step 3: Doctor checks the box marked ""Male"" on the form.  The fact that the phrase ""gender"" was next to that box was a non-issue.

&#x200B;

So, in step 3, if the form had been ""Physical Sex"" instead of ""Gender"", the doctor would have checked the same thing.

In step 2, if you start at me with ""Physical characteristics are wrong!"", well, not in most cases, and that doesn't really change the ""observation"".  ""And what about intersex!""  In the 1 in 200,000 case where this happens, I'll continue to let the medical establishment handle it however it evolves to do so.

&#x200B;

And, again, other than an ""intersex"" where the doctor may look at medical interventions, there is not an ""assignment.""  Now, if you want to limit ""Assigned <fill in blank here> At Birth"" terminology strictly to medical interventions of intersex patients, I wouldn't object to that, either, because in that case it is a very descriptive phrase."

So, my point is that the phrase ""gender assigned at birth"" is used over ""sex observed at birth"" because of the difference in agency of ""assigned"" vs ""observed"". In the case of an assignment, you can assume motivations of the actor, and this adds a sympathy card for the person involved to play.

For example, if the ""hack"" that let's your system grow to 1000 users is ready tomorrow, while the ""right way"" that will let you grow to 100 million takes 2 years, you absolutely should do the 1000 one first, just to show it works, and to start proving your design."
