AskWomen,felu82c,t3_epkghy,1579231057.0,"I was a jerk. 

I met a guy who seemed cool. We went for drinks as friends with a couple other people and he said some stuff that was a little off-putting, but I let it slide as I barely knew him. A couple more hangouts and he continued to be rude and disrespectful. The worst was when my ex was around. (We had lots of mutual friends so him being around was almost inevitable if it was around that group of people. No biggie, but we’d avoid each other.) My new “friend” shoulder checked me out of nowhere so I would fall into my ex. He said thought it would be funny.

So I ghosted him, like a jerk. I should have confronted him. I wasn’t mad at him, I just didn’t want to be his friend and I didn’t know how to tell him that. 

Months later, I realized that some of my Facebook messages were hidden due to privacy settings I didn’t know about. One was from him. It said, “please, I’m begging you to talk to me!”

So the moral of the story is, have that awkward conversation to end a friendship. It will be uncomfortable. It might make someone mad. They might not like you afterwards. But things have a way of coming back to bite you in the ass if you don’t take care of them."

AskReddit,felhb38,t3_epq4h9,1579222161.0,"Now I love me some bubble tea. I’ve had all kinds. Blueberry, watermelon, coconut, taro, lychee, whatever. And then my cold, Canadian ass ordered a durian bubble tea. 

Durian, for those who haven’t heard of it, DOES NOT EXPORT WELL. Apparently when it’s fresh, it’s delightful, but I will never know. When it’s been sitting in a sea can, shipped across the ocean, it emits a smell that is nothing short of toxic waste. 

The way it was described to me was that it hasn’t gone bad, but a it emits an off-gas when it is no longer live fruit. That shit isn’t even edible. It was like bathroom cleaner without the lemon. Imagine rinsing your mouth with Clorox. 

When I’m on the other side of the world and I can pick that shit right off the tree (or vine? Cactus? I have no idea) then damnit, I’m trying the shit out of some durian. No fruit can be that awful. It’s giving fruit a bad name.

In the meantime, I’m staying the fuck away from Durian."

I much prefer waking up to light rather than sound."
AskWomen,feh4h3l,t3_eoy958,1579108954.0,"My girl friend invited me to her buddies house to chill and have some drinks. He was there too. She ended up getting drunk, calling her ex, and having him pick her up, ditching me there with people I’d just met. Normally I would have bailed, but for whatever reason, I didn’t. They seemed nice enough and I was comfortable there. We all ended up playing video games and crashing on the couches. 

He found me on Facebook after that and asked me to dinner. 

7 years later, we have a house together. The guy whose couch I slept on lives 5 minutes up the road with his wife and kid. We all get together for board games once a week. I don’t talk to the friend that bailed on me anymore, although not because of that."
