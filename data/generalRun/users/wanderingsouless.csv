bestof,fghybqq,t1_fgh2xu2,1580797804.0,"Yeah but it’s easy to forgive the sins you yourself commit, like in my moms case. It’s not their fault they abused pain pills it’s the dr or big pharma and I’m not saying they aren’t culpable but for fucks sake take a little responsibility for your actions."
AmItheAsshole,fgf61cp,t1_fgep335,1580726392.0,"I had my first baby in 5hrs, water broke baby came pretty quick after. But even this would give him time to get back. I don’t envy this decision."

I’m turning 40 this year and am far from perfect but I’ve decided I’m just going to like who I am. I don’t have the energy to try and meet those standards."
aww,fgemkvj,t3_exw8r2,1580703320.0,My grandparents did this for my me and my cousins when we were young. It was one of of the most memorable times we had. I’m so glad there are awesome grandparents still out there.

JUSTNOMIL,fg2qu99,t1_fg2hnkz,1580452272.0,Ever watched the Office? It’s all I can think about when I hear the name but I still love it and think it’s cute and by the time your baby owns it she will make it her name and all you will think when you hear it is how much you love her. Congrats!

educationalgifs,ffvszzs,t1_ffvs6ql,1580272388.0,"Yep mine said it was cosmetic, fuckers. They partial cover dentures but seeing as I’m not even 40 yet and I googled what happens when you start loosing teeth and almost cried I’m in debt so I can eat properly and not be in pain."
educationalgifs,ffvsvc4,t1_ffvgqxa,1580272282.0,That sucks! See if they will give you a Valium or something to chill you out first. And if you can try and keep the tooth. I’ve had six root canals and three implants and I would choose to keep my tooth every damn time. Also there is a high rick or bone loss and change in appearance (jaw structure) if you have missing teeth so implants are high priority especially if you are young (under 70 my dentist said). Good luck and I hope you are pain free soon.
educationalgifs,ffvs04e,t1_ffvokqr,1580271598.0,Don’t stress too much they can put a bone (synthetic) graft in if they need to pull in. Then you wait about 6 months and then you can get an implant. If you don’t get and implant within the first year or two you will experience bone loss and the possibility for an implant could go down. You might want to check into your insurance though because mine didn’t cover the implant and I had to work with the dentist and take out a credit card to pay for my dental surgeries. Most insurances have a missing tooth clause too so check into that before you have anything done. I’ve lived with various amounts of dental pain for the last few years and it is no way to live. I hope you have a quick and speedy recovery and the solution is simple.

TwoXChromosomes,ffrjtuf,t1_ffqzcqe,1580159488.0,The worst part is my doc was a female. The male dr I found later was much more sympathetic and the female dr I have now is amazing.
Dentistry,ffqkldu,t1_ffq3wb1,1580137136.0,Sounds about right. I had tooth 2 and 3 done together.
TwoXChromosomes,ffpwdqx,t1_ffpmx3f,1580108323.0,"I had a dr tell me once that Endo was caused my sex durning your period. I had four drs before one finally helped. Continuous BC didn’t work for me, a partial hysterectomy did wonders. Sometimes you can call the insurance and they can help you figure out ways around it not being covered. If it’s a medical necessity you can send it to appeals."
Dentistry,ffpj6go,t1_ffotf2f,1580096302.0,Thanks! When is your procedure? Just one implant?
Dentistry,ffjy3mz,t1_ffjig0t,1580010138.0,Healed ok but it was tougher than I thought. Right now there is an odd cool/numb sensation starting on the bridge of my nose and extending under my eye. I can only assume it’s my sinuses healing. I’ve had some dull sinus head aches but so far nothing some ibuprofen been able to take care of. Just make sure you take about two to three days to do nothing and heal. It will be worth it! Good luck!

Dentistry,ff797ez,t3_ersb7o,1579643669.0,"I always thought it was hereditary. Both of my parents grind their teeth and I grind so hard before I got my night guard I would often wake up my husband. I wear my night guard religiously and have for almost 15 years but I am still breaking teeth and currently have three implants. I am wondering if Botox is covered by my insurance in this case and if it helps with TMJ that I have from clenching and also only being able to eat on one side of my mouth for the past two years (Implants are new, no crowns yet to chew on). Acupuncture was helping but it’s expensive and I just sunk all my money into my current implants."

BeAmazed,feshnnh,t3_eqeo7o,1579365256.0,"I always look at this and thing, damn I could buy paint and tape, a tooth brush, some cotton, but what I can’t buy is that damn talent to do this. My brother received the art gene in my family."
YouShouldKnow,feircsk,t3_ep5ft8,1579145271.0,"I experienced both sides of this one n my 20’s when both of my Grandmas passed a few years apart. My parents were written out of both wills so that left my brother and I in an odd spot. My Mother’s parents wrote us into the will in place of my mom, the few years before they passed anytime someone came to visit they would have you pick something you wanted and then put your name on it or give it to you if they didn’t want it. They had clear instructions in the will that the five children (my brother and I for my mom) were to go room to room together and take turns choosing something until everything was picked. Everyone for the most part was pretty cool about it. 

The other side was my Dads mom who had been sick for years and honestly just didn’t have the energy to prepare correctly before she was put in assisted living. We had to ask permission from her oldest son to go to her house and get something to remember her with. He agreed because they had already cleared everything of value and the rest was going to be sold for an estate sale. When we got there I figured I would just get a coffee cup. It ended up that there was a lot of her cast iron and other awesome stuff still there so we loaded up before my uncle got there. The rest was just going to him in an estate sale for pennies and I use and cook with her pans almost daily. It was stressful though and I felt like a thief the whole time. 

I don’t know what my parents will end up doing but I don’t really care. They have a house full of stuff and little to no relationship with their kids or grandkids. When it’s my time I plan to give as much away ahead of time that I can. 

Wow that was pretty therapeutic. Good luck to those who have to tackle this task sooner rather than later."
depression,fect1n7,t3_eofgj0,1578983502.0,"You are alive for the hope that it will get better. And I’ve been up and I e been real real low and yes at times the only thing keeping me alive was the thought of how much it would hurt those I love. Honestly that’s all I need sometimes is to remember that as much as life sucks sometimes, it’s not completely worthless. Even my pain has a lesson and a meaning even if it is only to remind me that tomorrow can be a different day. Do what you can to help yourself, for yourself. Find someone who you can talk to or even a hotline to just air your pain. Tomorrow might not be different, but what if it is?
Oh and get some meds! I’m not sure where I would be without them."
Dentistry,fecqhq8,t1_feboanm,1578980897.0,You may want to wait and look in to some schools in the area. Sometimes they will only take you if they do the complete course. My insurance has a missing tooth clause too where they won’t cover anything if the tooth is missing. I just had two implants on Friday with a sinus lift and it was almost $7000. Just something worth covering all the bases on before you start. Good luck.
Dentistry,fecki7x,t3_eoedsr,1578976137.0,Antibiotics are pretty standard. Think of how many germs live inside your mouth! Also good on you! You got this. If you start to feel nervous tomorrow just close your eyes and do some deep breathing and before you know it you’ll be out.
Dentistry,fe6dfao,t1_fe5uhri,1578887662.0,Oh it makes me feel better to know that your gum swelled over the implant too. First implant was on my lower jaw and that one was easy but this sinus lift sucks. I hope you heal up fast too.
AmItheAsshole,fe5c7zm,t1_fe54lx0,1578867599.0,"I think you are doing exactly what you should. I am by no means an expert of deaf culture having only studied it for a few years but I can give you my completely uneducated option. He’s a kid, letting him choose his friends is important. Letting him identify himself is important, let him define who he is and how he wants to be seen is important. When he is ready he will decide to be a part of the community however he is comfortable. Now you can keep giving him opportunities and encouraging him but making him go would just make him resent you."
politics,fdtqb11,t1_fds7bn0,1578720542.0,There is a book my kids love called “The 13-Story Tree House.” The world today is like the author took the concept and wrote an adult version.

offmychest,fdm1yfe,t3_elxt3x,1578537881.0,Also the opposite is true. Just because some guys are nice to me does not mean they have the hots for me like my husband likes to say. I have many other redeeming qualities that would make someone want to be my friend. I just realized this the other day and am waiting for the next time he makes a comment to let him on this little boy of knowledge.
unpopularopinion,fdbq4sl,t3_ekdmll,1578260249.0,"One of my favorite stories of my youngest was when we were teaching him words that were ok to use in public. He was trying to remember and said, “Mom, is the word that’s ok to use ‘fuck’? I think daddy said that one was ok.” He was 8 and very sincere and I couldn’t help but laugh. I told him no, that word will get you in trouble at school."
