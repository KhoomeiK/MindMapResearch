AskReddit,ffeqet9,t1_ffeo8gv,1579860326.0,I like to think Marx aired on the side of moderation when it comes to religion. A little can do a lot to ease the pain of existence  and help make life enjoyable but start taking it all day everyday and you'll end up a raving lunatic screaming at others to give you more.
AskReddit,ffentud,t1_ffemml0,1579856415.0,That quote by Marx has always baffled me because it makes religion sound bad but if you know anything about Marx a bit of opium every once and a while was kind of his thing. Marx loved drugs and couldn't sleep whilst sober. So I've always wondered did he mean this quote to be a damning indictment of religion or that every needs a bit of religion every now and then?
LegalAdviceUK,ffenasx,t3_et7mjf,1579855631.0,"Just go to the police and don't let them fob you off onto action fraud. Action fraud is as much use as a chocolate teapot. I called the police about phone scammers who referred me to action fraud. In their own words to me ""Yeah we're not really gonna do anything about this unless we get more reports so you'll probably not hear from us again."" Meaning the hour I spent on hold on the non emergency police line and then 2 more hours on hold and getting through to report to action fraud were a complete waste of my time. Whilst on hold I had managed to not only trace the phone number of whomever had tried to scam me to their address some strip club in Lithuania but also manage to find out the owner had already been convicted of similar crimes previously. So they had possible suspect with priors for the same crime, the address that was registered to the phone number so kind of an open an shut case for them but they refused to help because they need more people to report before they would take action."
MadeMeSmile,ffcyi9i,t1_ffbvlm1,1579809897.0,"I lost my stepdad, who was more of a father to me than my biological father, just over 3 years ago. We were always tight. There was no way I wasn't his son. I miss him everyday but in a happy sad way, like when his football team loses or one of his shows finishes in a shitty way (I'm looking at you game of thrones) I get sad then I remember how pissed he'd get at the TV, the pointing and shouting and it makes my smile. As he was unapologetically himself and you could fuck off if you didn't like it. For all his faults he was a passionate man with a short fuse but he was my dad and I loved him and he loved me. I know wherever he is now he is ranting and raving about something. If he's in heaven he's arguing with someone about what's on the TV and if he is not he's arguing with whoever's punishing him that they are going to have to try harder if they want to hurt him.

The reason he was caught was every once and a while the police would take drug sniffer dogs to every pub in our town to try cut down on drug use. Obviously it never worked as there were too many people in the pubs for the dogs to actually be able to do their job successfully. However this councilor lived above his pub and so because it was still part of the building the police had to check there as well. They walk up the stairs and open the door to see him dancing in his underwear with a young lady almost passed out on the couch in her underwear. It was commonly known by the regulars that the owner run cocaine as most of us bought it from him and he would come downstairs find an intoxicated lady invite her upstairs ply her with more drink and drugs and the sleep with her.

As soon as you have feed them, pick them up and silently place them where you want them to go to the toilet. Do not let them that area until they have peed or pooped. Once they've done their business praise them and give them a small treat. Then whenever you see them looking to pee or poop pick them up and take them back there again once business is done praise and treat. If they pee or poop anywhere you don't want take them to it show them it and then carry them to where they are to do that. It took about a week for my miniature Yorkshire terriers to get it and start pooping and peeing there without guidance. Again whenever we saw they had done the correct thing by peeing and pooping where they were meant to be gave treats and praise.

When he told me this I honestly taught he was pranking me as I was super skeptical as I (30M) didn't want to get pranked by a 5 year old but he swore blind his teacher had showed them during the last summer. So as a grown up I refused to salt my watermelon in his presence and waited until he was back home with my twin sister before attempting it because if no one sees it happen did it really happen? Or at least there is no proof other than my own shame. Anyway little bugger is right lightly salt your watermelon for a sweeter tasting piece.

OnePiece,fev8779,t3_eqp0mn,1579394359.0,"I caught up and was concurrent during war of marineford. I watched weekly until the end of fishman island and then stopped watching due to life getting in the way. Then I caught up again at the end of dressrosa and watched weekly again for a few months. Now I'm in the process of catching up again. Just watched Luffy beat katakuri although it was great to see Luffy win I kinda felt that katakuri took a dive at the end and let Luffy win. I would ideally like to be concurrent again and watch weekly but unfortunately I don't have the time to watch weekly as I watch so much other crap, I blame you YouTube, but luckily there are some great YouTubers who revived my one piece love mostly Tekking 101 for one piece and Nux Taku for anime in general. So it's hard to say what will happen in the future so my advice is watch weekly if you can and want to or do a binge watching once it's complete but that could be another 10 years at the moment because not only does Luffy have to beat all the yonko, he didn't beat big mom so he will have to go back and do that at some point but he also has to find the one piece so who knows how long till all that's done.

AskReddit,feuin1q,t3_eqmuvq,1579386854.0,"This is gonna be a long one so TL:DR at the end.

The path to not caring what others think about you is difficult and takes a lot of hard work but if you do this I can guarantee you'll be a much better person for it. Also I a 30M know many people older and younger who absolutely could not do this work purely because some people are incapable of this level of honest self reflection but I've met people both younger and older than myself who have done this so age and gender have nothing to do with this, just a lot of hard work.

Firstly you need to honestly, and I mean you need to be brutally fucking honest here, understand who and what you are and not just the good bits but those deep dark secrets you know about yourself that refuse to admit even exist because how could anyone love a person who can think/feel/do those kind of things. Yeah those bits as well. This level of honest self awareness is usually more than most people can accept and refuse to acknowledge it.

After you've done this monumental task. I'd suggest writing it all down, every bad deed you've done and had done to you then you need to see you're part in it. Why did you do those bad things when you knew they were wrong? You know why even if you don't want to say it you know. You also need to see your fault in the random things that happened to you even if can't possibly imagine what your fault is there is some kickback to you and your behaviour.

I'll give an example from my list, I was emotionally abused by my father's new wife when I was a kid she told my twin sister and I that our father didn't love us any more and didn't want us to visit him because he had a new family and didn't want or need his old one. Now how could I a child have any fault in some crazy lady telling kids horrible things like that? Or saying if we told anyone these things she would kill us in our sleep. Well for years I thought she was just a cunt but looking back on it I was never nice towards her and I resented her for taking my dad away. Maybe if I was nicer she wouldn't have done what she did or maybe she would have still done it. Regardless I had to admit I had some blame there to, maybe not as much as her bit still enough I should apologise to her for being a shitty kid towards her. I did. I now feel that I've done my best to be better even if she didn't want to admit her own fault I admitted mine and can die knowing there is no hatred left in my heart towards a woman I once would have killed if I had the chance.

You need to fully accept that this is you the good, the bad and ugly, every facet of your being is you and you must love who you are for what you are because no one will ever be able to love you more than you do.

Now that you've faced your deepest darkest secrets about yourself it really doesn't matter what others think about you. You know who and what you are so when others try to guess what they think is right or wrong about you it doesn't matter because you know the truth. It's a truly humbling experience doing this work and is completely terrifying because the worst part is after you've done this work you have to find someone and tell them all of it. I chose a someone I had recently met but maybe tell a therapist as it's easier telling someone you don't know that well all the bad stuff about you at least it was for me. You're only as sick as your secrets. Now that you accepted this you can make changes to yourself to make a better you.

TL:DR accept what a piece of shit you are to become a better person"
Advice,feu5avk,t3_eqmiup,1579383268.0,"When dealing with petty people I find the best way to deal with them is to live your life as usual and pay them no attention. It drives them insane because as with any form of bullying she just wants a reaction from you so don't give one. If you answer her rumours then she has you on the hook and if you're petty or vindictive back then she'll manipulate the group against you. I've seen it happen time and time again.

My advice pay her no attention and when people mention her to you just be super supportive of her and her endeavors but never mention her yourself. People will quickly see this manipulation for what it is.

 If you need any more advice I will help as much as I can. I spent too much of my life being a manipulative wanker and now abhor it.

Nearly every other country sees driver's as having a duty not to kill pedestrians but that's not good enough for you?

I always wondered why Americans don't have as many rights as the rest of the world then I realise it's people like you that would rather other people suffer at your expense.

The joys of no dress code, working in a small business and a massive sign on the door saying no customers allowed in the office, all work must be done through phone or email.

Unfortunately life's kinda hard and if you really want to look better it takes a lot of hard work to get and maintain a good body. For the miriad of different diets I've tried and failed at the only thing that ever truly works is eating health and by that I mean fresh veggies and lean meats with a few but not too many carbs thrown in, drink only water, not juice or carbonated drink and exercise. It take time and dedication but it's worth it. I was in my early 20s when I get finally started exercising regularly. I started backyard weight training with my dad who although outta shape at the time had been a semi professional bodybuilder in his youth. He get me and him back into shape and the days when it was shitty weather and we missed a session I hated it as that tired achy feeling you get the next day after a good workout you come to enjoy and look forward to as I reminds you that you did a great job yesterday."

Last time it happened I was laying in bed questioning my whole existence when my boss rings me to ask what I'm up to and my response of ""questioning my entire existence and if this reality is also some weird dream"" left him stunned. There was complete silence for about 5 seconds before he asked if I could come into work early. I said sure and hung up.

Dreams,fdejy7a,t3_ekywvq,1578340620.0,"I find my dreams to be one of 4 categories: 

Monster  chase nightmares which are very rare.

Fantastical dreams where I can fly or have other super powers. These are my most common type of dream.

What I call inception time trap dreams which are when I go for a nap but need to be awake by a certain time. These are dreams that I wake up to check the time, still have time to sleep so go back to sleep then wake up and I'm slowly edging closer and closer to when I need to wake up then on the last dream I over sleep massively and I'm like an hour and a half late for whatever it was I needed to do. I seem to go to sleep whilst already sleeping and seem to go between different levels of dream like inception. Then I actually wake up and see it's been like 20 minutes since I went for a nap and realise I never actually woke up at all and it was all a dream. This leaves me disoriented and often have a small existential crisis where I question the validity of my reality. Not fun but happen often during my nap time. At 30 years old I nap most days as I work nights so I try for 6 hours then wake up have breakfast, do household chores then watch some TV and go back to bed for another 2 hours after I've been awake for a few hours. I find this routine improves my mood and energy levels over one solid 8 hour sleep.

And then lastly super mundane dreams of real life. For example like walking along a path to the local shops when  I see some stranger. Or sat at work in the office watching something on Netflix. These dreams cause me to suffer really bad deja Vu as I will be doing something and then remember a dream I had a week or so prior. These dreams are really rare and stand out as my dream percentages are about 2/70/27.999/0.001 respectively so such a mundane dream is unusual which makes it more memorable."

I think it's why Reddit is my favourite social media sites. Lots of subreddits are dedicated to types of stories all with similar plots but different characters like r/choosingbeggars always the same story but different characters make it interesting. The talesfrom__________ subreddits have more variety of types of stories. Or r/AITA where we people tell you their story to so we can decide if they're the protagonist or the antagonist. Stories are what connect us and what we all find interesting, whether those stories are real or fake all we want is more of them be they film or documentary or posts on here."

It then say if you want a quote before we know exactly what we're doing take one of these* then at the bottom it says *no quotes will be honoured. My tattooists are bunch of savages when it comes to their customers it's fantastic. Overheard someone ask them if they do custom jobs or just what's in the books. Customer was told they can only work from every 3rd page of the odd numbered books and every other design in even numbered book. The customer left and the tattooists and us people getting work done had a great laugh. Don't feel bad that the tattooists are losing out on work. They are award winning and are usually booked solidly for a month or two at a time so losing custom from idiots or entitled wankers doesn't bother them.
