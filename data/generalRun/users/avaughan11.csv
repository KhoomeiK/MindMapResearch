Still, he’d get sent home in someone else’s diapers from time to time because the daycare worker was too lazy to grab his out of his bag, and just used whatever was closest. It used to really piss me off. Use the diapers the parent provides, and ask for more when/if they’re needed. So, who knows, the daycare may have been using HER diapers for another kid, too, and that’s why they ran out. Regardless, this is not how you go about getting a parent to bring more diapers."

I asked for a cute layered bob when I was in junior high. Showed the stylist a picture and everything. The layers were suppose to start around the top of my earlobe and layer down to my jawline, so the hair would flip out on the bottom. It was very doable for a junior high girl. Well, instead, the stylist chopped all my hair off into a very short pixie, that was short all the way around on the sides and about 3” long on top. I looked like Elvis. I cried.

He had to quarantine the infected cattle and give them two rounds of vaccinations over a span of 30 days. The cows can be treated, but unfortunately the bulls can’t, so he had to butcher both bulls. My dad told his neighbor that he needed to have his herd tested and quarantine and treat his as well, and the neighbor refused.

iamatotalpieceofshit,ffam63z,t1_ffafxy6,1579739198.0,"It’s an antiquated tradition. From what I’ve read, basically people started tipping workers after the civil war. Business owners were allowed to pay former slaves next to nothing to work in their businesses with the expectation that the customers would give the workers a small amount of money for good service. By the early 1900’s restaurant owners had caught on that they could make greater profits by depending on their customers to tip the servers, so regardless of raise, servers were paid low wages. Laws have since been passed requiring business owners to pay a minimum wage of $2.13/hour to tipped workers, and if the worker’s tips do not add up to at least the federal minimum wage of $7.25/hr, the business owner is suppose to pay the difference to the worker on their paycheck, yet many owners don’t, and the workers can’t afford to fight them in court over it, so they get away with it. The $2.13/hour goes almost entirely to taxes. It’s not unusual for a waiter’s paycheck to be a few dollars after taxes. So, we tip to insure our waiters actually make a living. The really shitty part is, there’s undoubtedly a huge difference in what a waiter can make in tips based on their age, sex, race, and the location of the restaurant. I had a family member who was blonde, attractive, young and big breasted when she worked in a popular steakhouse. It was normal for her to rake in $500 in tips on a Friday night. A middle aged waitress working in a mom and pop cafe couldn’t dream of making that much in tips. She might bring in $100 for the night, if she’s lucky.

So, when I found out about the cousin that died (it was a work accident, so not expected) my first question to my grandmother was if anyone had notified his brother because I just knew it was going to be on Facebook pretty soon. She said she didn’t know. So I messaged him and asked him if he’d spoke to his mom that day. He hadn’t. I told him he really needed to call her because it was important. He said his parents and all of his siblings had blocked his phone number so he couldn’t if he wanted to. So, I called him, and broke the news to him. It absolutely killed me to do it, but I couldn’t let him learn his brother died on Facebook. I then offered him a place to stay at my house when he came in for the funeral. When he got here, he told me he was glad I called and told him because literally no one else in the family had bothered to tell him. People suck, and my aunt and uncle are trash people that I have absolutely no respect for anymore."

FuckYouKaren,ff5ez1g,t1_ff3nmrb,1579589989.0,"My mom’s ex-husband was addicted to prescription narcotics. He briefly worked for a local hardware store that delivered major appliances and installed them in the customer’s home. There was a general rule of thumb that you did not use the bathroom at a customer’s home. But he was doing it almost every time he’d go to someone’s house and his coworker told their boss that he found it odd. Finally a customer called and reported that after he’d left half of a bottle of narcotics went missing from their bathroom. He was fired on the spot. My dad worked with another guy who got accused of stealing some lady’s rings out of her bathroom. Turned out he never touched them, she had misplaced them, but he still almost lost his job over it and could’ve potentially gotten arrested. This is one reason a lot of companies do not allow their employees to use a customer’s bathroom. Obviously that’s not the case with your dad, though. You should suggest to your dad to take scheduled breaks when working a job. So long for lunch, so long to run up to the gas station and take a bathroom break, etc. I know that seems extreme, but you can’t get accused of stealing anything if you’re never there to begin with."

YouOnLifetime,fewszqe,t1_fev991r,1579419042.0,"Honestly, if season 1 had never happened and we just picked up at season 2, I probably wouldn’t have even found Joe all that bad considering who he took out in the second season. He held captive a crook, then let him go. He killed a mobster that tried to kill him first, and he took out a pedophile. All in all, the world was probably a better place without those people in it. Holding Delilah captive was shitty, but he did it for self preservation and had all intentions of letting her go, too, so, not really that shitty. His stalking of Love was pretty minimal this season, too. He was way worse in season one, in my opinion."

Of course, this one bitch got on her phone, stepped directly into the aisle as the wedding party made their way down the aisle, and blocked my sister from getting shots of the entire wedding party at the alter from the end of the aisle.
