politics,fgt1ox8,t3_f0dhyl,1581097193.0,"That article advocates for authoritarianism. I’m not overly exaggerating, the article’s basic thesis is “Sanders needs to use the overwhelming powers of the American Presidency to remake the state, but he needs to do so in a way that no one after him can wield those same powers.” The author even says the plainly authoritarian program (though there are no specifics about what Sanders should do once he has been appointed Vozhd of the People) is only a problem for “democratic” socialists. Democracy will be restored once the revolution is complete and politics can no longer stray outside of the structure Sanders creates. 

Then again, the author seems to have a terrible understanding of what Presidents can actually do. I mean, this line is laughable:

> Barack Obama, for instance, declined to use the presidential bully pulpit to force McConnell to seat Garland on the Supreme Court.

Of course Bernie’s been attacked. It’s a campaign. But the really vile stuff, the stuff that cuts to the quick, that we haven’t seen yet. The Republicans won’t make attacks on Bernie’s socialism from the perspective of the plausibility of his reforms or whether it impacts his electability. Oh no. Bernie Sanders wants to have the government take over your healthcare and make decisions about your health that should be between you and your doctor. He wants to set up death panels. He wants the government to take over the electric grid, so you have to pay Uncle Sam to get power. The government could shut off your power at any moment, or decide to change the power grid to help black people. I don’t know, it’s bullshit, but they’ll find a way to tie race and a federal takeover of the power grid together mark my words. Someone right now is writing a piece about how the federal government could use control of the electric grid to be more equitable to all Americans. Boom, Bernie wants to give your kilowatts to the illegals. 

I don’t think any of that’s accurate. In fact most of it is silly. But it doesn’t matter, because that’s the kind of shit we’ll start to see. The attack ads write themselves. And they’re hard to refute because Bernie really does want to dramatically increase the scope of the government, and he wants to do it by executive fiat if necessary. So you’re left to explain what the implications of that are, and if you’re explaining you’re losing. 

And none of that is even getting into the truly insane conspiracy theories we’ll see pop up because Sanders has a Jewish background. These people are fascistic degenerates. There’s going to be an undercurrent of Bernie and Soros and Jewish domination of the country and world finance buoying all the above the line attacks on Bernie’s socialism.

If I take your argument seriously, I would never implement these reforms, even if I think they’re the right thing to do. Another way to put this, when is it the right time to implement this reform?
