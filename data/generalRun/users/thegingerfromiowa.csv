Awwducational,fgrfe8y,t3_ezutm9,1581045466.0,"My dad had a pet raccoon as a kid, his name was Stanley. Stanley would steal my aunts makeup, break into the bathroom while someone was showering and try to “wash” the makeup and would get frustrated when it would all dissolve down the drain. He also loved Cookie Crisp cereal and had a special cupboard that he could get into. My dad told me he used to find Stanley sitting on his fluffy butt eating Cookie Crisp from the box."
