Always use a brightly colored life jacket with strong handles, regardless of how good a swimmer he is. You want him to be visible to other watercraft if he gets in the water and it is very hard to haul a handleless dog back into your boat. 

Cross-tie (to both sides) him in the canoe or kayak if you are by yourself and not sure whether he can be trusted. This will keep him from jumping out either side, unlike tying him at one point. On a paddle board, be aware that you will be capsizing at some point with a dog this size. Will you be able to get yourself and the dog back on the board? Do you have a friend who can kayak or canoe along and help if needed? I wouldn't do this alone with a large dog. 

Be aware that alligators and crocodiles love to eat dogs if you live somewhere that this is a possibility.

Walk her on leash while walking the bike on your other side. If/when she crosses in front of the bike GENTLY bump her with it so she understands what is possible. The key word is GENTLY here--obviously don't run her over or injure her in any way. I'm sure someone will pop in here to say how horrible this is, but it's to avoid a serious injury to the dog and/or yourself later. 

Practice on a neighborhood street with almost no traffic or in an empty parking lot, not a narrow walkway. Keep her on the side between you and the road edge, not on the traffic side.

Clip the leash to her harness and give her only a short amount of leash. If you extend your arm and lock your elbow, the correct amount of leash is the vertical line that makes a 90 degree angle between your arm and the leash. This way, if she veers too close to the wheel you can guide her away by sticking your arm out. Don't just ride around this way of course, but be ready. If she is raring to go, she will be more difficult to work with, so do a walk or jog with her first to take the edge off.

> Whereas a good bath should last for weeks. 

You may go weeks between baths, sure, but it's not because the bath was ""good"" vs bad or ""lasted."" A bath gets rid of dirt and oils, it doesn't have a lasting effect that continues on for weeks. Different dogs are going to be dirty/stinky in different amounts of time depending on the dog itself and lifestyle.

>A huge doodle that needs to be dematted and groomed and everything or a poodle maybe four hours.

You cannot demat a matted big dog in 4 hours. If this were possible, one wouldn't need to resort to shaving so often. 

Of course it's loud in a place with multiple dryers and lots of dogs. How could it possibly not be? This is hardly exclusive to big pet store grooming areas. And yes, it's very stressful for many dogs, but that's not the fault of the groomers either.

It sounds like you worked at some poorly run places, but there is not a bright line difference between a corporate poorly run place and a private place. At least there is *some* chance of oversight at a place with many people working and coming in and out. When a private groomer sucks, there is no one to fire them, since they are often the owner. 

At least at PetSmart, Petco, etc., the groomers do the actual haircuts in sight of any and everyone, so they are unlikely to abuse the dog during the process. After a highly recommended local private groomer abused my dog right in front of me, I don't think the idea that you are going to have a better experience has any merit. Some groomers are good and some are bad and what goes on behind closed doors can be horrific. Dig as deeply into your groomer's operation as you would a daycare for a newborn is all I can say."

The important thing now is to make sure the dog is okay. Bring him to the vet and while there, have them tell him what never to feed and how serious it is. Hope the dog is okay."
