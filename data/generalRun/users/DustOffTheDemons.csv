datingoverforty,fef9g4j,t1_fecx162,1579051317.0,"Um...I paid for the room. But he used a “rewards card” type thing and saved me a hundred. 

Thanks for the encouragement!!"

datingoverforty,fef6mh6,t1_fedaidq,1579049417.0,"Oh my fucking god girl! I immediately thought of Dirty John when I read this. (Podcast originally and a Netflix limited series-terrible stuff).

I’ll be rooting for you and I’m sure your kids are going to be so proud of you! 

Message me if you ever need to chat!"
datingoverforty,fef6amo,t1_fedf424,1579049196.0,Thank you! I did it!
datingoverforty,fef69iy,t1_fedg3af,1579049175.0,Decided just to make a quick break and not get into all the details. Thank you for your thoughtful reply.
datingoverforty,fef6451,t1_fedhzub,1579049073.0,Your intuition may be right my friend...thank you for your response.

datingoverforty,fef5j55,t1_fedlblu,1579048675.0,"Awe thanks! I like how you understand how things add up incrementally...so very true. 

Well done on getting your lady a present. I bet she was impressed by the gesture."
datingoverforty,fef5bb4,t1_fee64vh,1579048527.0,"Whelp, that’s a really good question."
datingoverforty,fef5955,t1_feecd0z,1579048488.0,Yes! But I come across as a “bitch” when I negotiate. I’ll work on that!
datingoverforty,fef566v,t1_feevufl,1579048432.0,Haha! Love that saying! Thank you!
datingoverforty,fecpupk,t1_fecojmt,1578980313.0,"The most unpleasant reply of which I will
take  under consideration. One has to wonder when hearing such things. Thank you for taking the time."
datingoverforty,fecntnk,t1_fecn66s,1578978603.0,"Barnacle. Three simple syllables.

Went and got myself good and drunk. I shall report back soon."
aww,fecn6xo,t3_eodytg,1578978116.0,"Um. Scuse me so much. May I be of pardon, in any way? *best doggo voice I have*"
datingoverforty,fecmyg0,t1_fecmkdv,1578977929.0,I’m a train wreck around him. Nuff said.
datingoverforty,fecl9te,t1_feck8u2,1578976699.0,"Wow. Now I did the DJ podcasts and the show on NF. That was my ex husband to a tee. (My son suggested it because of that) But I’m not really sure here. There’s been some questionable “how’d you know that?” shit for sure.

In the end though, I’m much more valuable to my employer than he is. It’s just the way it is. So, if shit goes from bad to worse?? I’ve got that going for me.."
datingoverforty,feckmwe,t1_fecjw6r,1578976230.0,"Why thank you. I will endeavor to make you proud. So tomorrow, after I do the thing I hope you all support me as well."
datingoverforty,fecke0a,t1_fecj9gt,1578976053.0,True story. Thanks for that!
datingoverforty,fecka45,t1_fecj7ep,1578975975.0,"Well yeah. Maybe. I was wondering if it was gambling. He has the propensity. 

And his farm is a financial hardship. But I don’t really know. The man’s paycheck is close to 6k per month. 

So, the lunch money thing? I don’t know? Choose a bill to pay and let your GF pick up the rest? Might be logical to some...but in a new (ish) relationship? Too uncomfortable to me.

Makes me feel like he thinks, that I think he’s just the shit and will tolerate whatever dried up crusty bone he’ll throw. Not a good feeling ma’ friend."
datingoverforty,fecj569,t1_feciw2k,1578975176.0,Yes! He “negotiated” me too. Thanks for catching that. Well done. Thank you!
datingoverforty,feciq0o,t1_fechxa1,1578974891.0,"I will not delay. As I said, there is a box. Somewhere. I’ll put his name on it. And as soon as m not feeling so lazy and Redditatized I shall go fill it. With his crappy things. He will have to retrieve it in the rain tomorrow by his self. And I will feel quite fine about that. 

A little bit of a “walk of shame”? Wouldn’t you agree?

Whatever."
datingoverforty,feci5nh,t1_fecgtwt,1578974492.0,"I mean. You’re not wrong. But what many people “get” is that there are unspoken social norms here that don’t usually need to be communicated. And IDK anything about your social norms so I can’t even imagine. But thank you very much for your input. 

Much appreciated."
facepalm,fecga86,t3_eoc5gv,1578973201.0,K
datingoverforty,fecfygq,t1_fecf2mo,1578972982.0,And are you ok now? I worried when I heard “emergency”.

datingoverforty,fecfil3,t1_feceauw,1578972685.0,"First: username checks out.

Second: I look forward to that blissful day."
datingoverforty,fecfcis,t1_fece73x,1578972574.0,"Ok. Don’t be mad. Not worth the energy. But I’m frickin right here! Be in solidarity is all. Silent protest is all. You’re a kind human and I appreciate it. 

Just a fucking note...or a card."
datingoverforty,feceww4,t1_fece4ss,1578972282.0,Yikes. The money though...eeew. I’m going to pack his shit tonight.
datingoverforty,fecd5z8,t1_fec9pto,1578971134.0,Haha! I’ll take that under consideration! My preference is avoidance  but I’ll really have to check this thing out that you suggest...I’ll save $4!
datingoverforty,feccfhs,t1_fecb22l,1578970682.0,Yep. I got it. Gonna be hard for a few minutes. But that’s all.
datingoverforty,feccbsw,t1_feca83n,1578970618.0,"Thanks kind soul. I feel that too. To be honest IDK what is 50 yards or a foot. I don’t think that way. But for the love of God...Walking fucking distance! 

Thank you. Noted. In all caps."
datingoverforty,fecbthe,t1_fec9yg4,1578970337.0,Whoop whoop! Happy early fifty! (I hear life starts at fifty!) go get ‘em champ!
datingoverforty,fecbj37,t1_fec9wtx,1578970177.0,"Interesting that you should say this. I think there is some truth there. Not exactly sure how or why? But I think you’re right. The male ego. It’s not to be fucked with. (Sorry men with kind healthy egos, I know you’re out there).

I’ve researched narcissist ad nauseam but never “toxic manipulator” but I’m hear you tell ya my arm hairs prickled when I read that. Always. Fucking. Scheming. 

My best to you and thank you for the considerate reply. Duly noted."

datingoverforty,fec9lvs,t1_fec8ar7,1578969104.0,"Thank you for your candor. Yes, I know what to do. It will be an uncomfortable conversation but one in which I can have. The truth. 

Simple...not easy."
datingoverforty,fec9clu,t1_fec7t99,1578968964.0,"YES! Thank you! My son did his laundry when he was like 10. No Thank you on the mom thing! Done. 

Good question about the attachment theory. I’ll need to revisit that. I got the audiobook...but was a “C” student. Thank you."
datingoverforty,fec84ku,t1_fec7bg4,1578968304.0,Copy that. I will not let it be so.
datingoverforty,fec81sh,t1_fec71ta,1578968264.0,Disappointed comes to mind which could escalate to anger if I keep expecting something that he clearly can not provide. Thank you.
datingoverforty,fec7uwx,t1_fec6w6k,1578968165.0,Thank you. And OMG the anxiety over this is off the charts. So you’re right...my sanity first. Thank you.
