I've spent more than that on just the wood I've used to build guitars. The price of a computer and a first gen Vive doesn't even really touch the costs of some of my other hobbies.

That's all well and good, but that's more money than I've spent on my computer, PlayStation, piano, and all of my guitars and harmonicas combined, and I suspect there are many more in my position than in yours. 

It's great that you have money and can afford some luxury items -- I expect to be making pretty good money soon and I'm salivating over a gaming laptop and some new instruments -- but when a $1000+ computer and $500+ headset is the price of admission into VR-land when most people are happy with a $600 PC or a $400 PS4 from five years ago, that seems pretty steep."

Indeed.

>But I don't think you could do that based on the stories the characters tell each other about the Reavers. If you were making a realistic movie set in the old west, and had a couple of cowboys talking about Indians, I'm confident you could find all sorts of terrible stuff that people said about them. It's like Huck Finn - it's not a racist story just because Huck uses the N-word a lot. Any realistic depiction of a boy like Huck in that time period is going to use that language.

It's not that other characters describe them in ways that are racist, it's that they are presented as ""savages,"" there are clear visual references to the plains peoples and they play the role of the plains peoples in the films the show is clearly inspired by, and *we are given no reason to doubt the story* that they became ""savage"" because they strayed too far from the ""civilized"" planets.

Because it's a pretty clear allegory.

That's all well and good, but that's more money than I've spent on my computer, PlayStation, piano, and all of my guitars and harmonicas combined, and I suspect there are many more in my position than in yours. 

It's great that you have money and can afford some luxury items -- I expect to be making pretty good money soon and I'm salivating over a gaming laptop and some new instruments -- but when a $1000+ computer and $500+ headset is the price of admission into VR-land when most people are happy with a $600 PC or a $400 PS4 from five years ago, that seems pretty steep."
