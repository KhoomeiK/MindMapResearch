She’s annoyed by what the editor puts as his first answer (we have no way of knowing what order these questions actually came in) because she’s a professional skier who has wanted to go pro since she was a child and he said she wanted to be an attorney because that’s what her dad does for a living. Score for GQ! Tension for the video! Now just cut out any bits where they smile or laugh so it looks like she’s enraged and he’s irritated and you have yourself a grade-A internet hit. 

Tons of the examples of this game have been drummed up to look like they’re going to fight or have no chemistry because people will post them on social media and draw attention to them. Like OP.

cringe,ffekk47,t1_fegqeof,1579851907.0,"I’ve never watched this show and honestly it was a lot sweeter and more wholesome than I expected. First she’s really excited and the other women are telling her how thoughtful and nice the idea is, then she hears the cork pop and the other women tell her “It’s okay, don’t cry! We don’t even know if that was yours, let’s just go check.” Then she finds out it was hers and she goes inside because she’s starting to tear up, then the guy goes after her and the woman in the room with her asks if she wants to see him and he respectfully leaves when she says she’d rather not. Like damn, all of that was pretty fucking wholesome and sane for reality tv.

The one “reality tv” moment was her getting mad at the girl who opened the bottle but once she was convinced it was an accident (or at least that the argument isn’t going anywhere, because that’s a really expensive bottle and the girl should have at least wondered why there was suddenly a bottle with 10x the value of anything else on the show) she walked away from the situation, and between her and the guy they worked it out and everyone cheered when they still got to have a moment together despite the mistake.

cringe,ffeap95,t1_fetd4ai,1579841449.0,"Disclaimer: I am not saying I agree with the lady in purple. I think her position is debatable, which is why they’re having a debate. But this clip annoyed me because it was all about her tone and her looking silly and not about the content of her argument.

The comment that the asian woman made and the crowd cheering and clapping completely drowned her out from responding to the question. She’s saying that being bigoted and including bigotry in political discourse perpetuates harm, and then the asian girl says “but having a different opinion doesn’t mean that you’re saying other people can’t do something.” She missed the point entirely and was met with thunderous applause, EVEN THOUGH the woman in purple agreed with her.

Obviously being racist doesn’t mean you’re saying people can’t be black, that’s ludicrous. Being a sexist doesn’t mean you’re saying people can’t be women. What the lady in purple is saying (and pretty badly) is that bringing hateful language into public discourse invites and rationalizes bigotry. Like when the government of Florida created a committee to make a registry of gay people, they legitimized homophobia by making it a part of mainstream politics. She is arguing that the man who she claims made the statement in question is legitimizing islamophobia by bringing it forward as a legitimate political opinion. Therefore, she believes, that while being publicly anti-Muslim is not saying that other people cannot be Muslim (like the asian woman’s question implied) but that it legitimizes “anti-Muslim” as a valid political opinion. She believes that being anti-Muslim should be like being anti-gay or anti-woman and should not be considered a valid political belief but a form of bigotry to be relegated to KKK meetings and extremist fringes.

I used to work with disabled children and some of their lowest moments were when people talked around them and didn’t treat them like they could respond or share their opinions. I’ve held a little girl while she cried because the parents at the park wouldn’t wave back to her. I’ve consoled a mother who was distraught about how strangers wouldn’t even look at her baby, how she could see them averting their gaze. I’ve seen firsthand how difficult it is to live in a world where “don’t stare” has become “don’t look, don’t ask, don’t interact.” It’s lonely when people don’t understand you. It’s heartbreaking. What this channel is doing is saying “we see you, and more importantly **we hear you**” to hundreds of people who have been invisible. That’s a wonderful thing.

Unless you’re an omniscient god who has heard of everything there are things that happen that you don’t personally know about.

Not to mention, 450 people die every year from rolling out of bed. There are a lot of people out there, a mere 200-something of them dying from any given thing is astronomically rare. 2.7 million people die in the US alone every year."

trashy,ff4z46r,t1_ff4y1cc,1579575939.0,"Like I said, I used to work with used furs, the majority of “chinchilla” furs were not chinchilla but rabbit or another type of fur that was dyed to look like chinchilla. You can’t get a chinchilla coat for $900, but the furs are designed to look like chinchilla at a glance because it’s so expensive.

It’s like snakeskin or alligator, if you see alligator boots for $50 they’re synthetic. Someone who knows what real alligator leather is like will obviously notice the difference right away, but most of the alligator boots you see aren’t real."
trashy,ff4uhmz,t1_ff4r5rk,1579572739.0,"“Literally none of this is true,” so fur isn’t expensive and it’s hard to know if you’re buying fur and the market isn’t full of artificial chinchilla made of rabbit? You even said in your own comment that fur is expensive, how can you say nothing I said is true and then agree with my first point?

Most of the chinchilla-patterned fur out there isn’t chinchilla just like most of the leopard print isn’t actual leopard. Most faux fur is cheaply made (a $40 jacket is going to have cheap faux fur on it) but very high-quality faux fur is comparable in texture and you won’t notice the difference if you aren’t touching both of them at once. I used to work in a vintage consignment boutique and have encountered plenty of four and five-figure furs, it’s more like synthetic diamonds vs natural ones than tofurkey vs turkey."
trashy,ff4jtk7,t1_ff49k1c,1579565339.0,"And not buying fur is like the easiest thing ever when it comes to the fair treatment of animals. Fur is insanely expensive, it’s really easy to identify and avoid it, and the substitutes are just as good. I have a polyester faux fur throw, it’s the softest thing on earth and it was only $150 compared to $20,000+ for real chinchilla. Not to mention most “chinchilla” out there is actually dyed rabbit fur anyway, so you could spend $1,000 and still not get the real thing.

Imagine if fake meat was indistinguishable from real meat, the real meat cost $1,000 per pound, and 99% of meat in the store was fake with scammers even passing off the fake meat as real because you can’t tell the difference. That’s what fur is like."

If I stayed with him we would be married within a year, move to the suburbs after college, and have a mostly happy but boring life. We would rarely travel, have two children, and settle into jobs that were comfortable but unambitious. We would have chicken for dinner most nights. We would talk about doing crazy things and having adventures but it would never be the right time, always “maybe next weekend.” I would never get to do a lot of things and I would always regret it, but I would always be comfortable and stable.

If I broke up with him I would be choosing the chaotic path. I would go to wild parties and travel to exotic places and have dramatic and passionate relationships. I would often be scared, lost, and unsure but in return I would have moments of unbelievable joy. I would take on challenges that would make me terrified for my future and have wild successes and bitter failures. I would often deeply regret not choosing stability and beg for a moment of peace but be unable fathom losing the incredible experiences I had.

The car jumped 19 blocks away from my apartment with no explanation. It took me 20 minutes to walk there, there’s no way I could have forgotten parking THAT far away and there would be no reason to. I had to call the police and report that I found it, and even they were confused how it ended up a full mile away from my apartment. They suggested maybe it was stolen and then left there, but there were no signs of forced entry and it locks itself automatically when you walk away from it.
