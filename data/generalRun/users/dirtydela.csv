nottheonion,ffocmww,t1_ffnjmdz,1580076296.0,Is it can’t afford or choose not to spend money on? I can afford to go to the movies but choose not to because overall the experience is unpleasant and these days you can get a big tv and good sound for relatively cheap.
iamverysmart,ffk4rnb,t1_ffiepm9,1580015831.0,"Just take 75% of the closest number divided by four and you’re close enough to estimate if it’s affordable or not. You don’t even need to find the actual amount to determine if you want to buy it or not...if you need to have it down to quarters or dimes then just use the calculator on your phone. 

That’s my take."

YangForPresidentHQ,ffh7svy,t1_ffh43oc,1579925548.0,Yeah unfortunately I didn’t have the foresight to work as hard as I should have in college and high school. But that was then and my life is different now. Now I focus on being positive in every facet as much as I can.
YangForPresidentHQ,ffgyq84,t1_ffgxgcn,1579918500.0,I had no issue getting student loans and my parents income all but excluded me from getting financial aid.
YangForPresidentHQ,ffgvrd7,t1_fffq043,1579916303.0,Unless you’re in a swing state your vote already doesn’t matter because of the EC (unless your state does by district EC votes). My state has voted red since the 70s. There’s usually approximately one county that votes blue in the whole state. I will be writing yang in if he’s not on the ballot.
YangForPresidentHQ,ffgvefv,t1_ffg0fcv,1579916038.0,I will be writing yang in if he’s not on the ballot. Doesn’t matter because red state but I’m not on that blue no matter who shit.
YangForPresidentHQ,ffgvacj,t1_ffgq3mt,1579915955.0,"Someone in the comments above was saying to look at UBI as some kind of middle ground. No one can refund time, which is by far the biggest setback for the guy in the video. He lost time with his family and time enjoying the life he has more. However i would hope that people receiving UBI would use it to pay off debt. That means people with debt will have to not use all of it for their life because it goes to debt. Meanwhile, people ghat saved for college get the whole thing forever. It’s not perfect but it’s a whole lot better than someone just wiping it all clean. That makes all of that time spent working extra and the money spent saving feel like it was worth less. 

I also think I read yang is more focused on reducing or removing interest rates on the loans. That alone will help people more than they appreciate currently. 

In the end student loan debt, to me, seems like more of a symptom than a problem. Colleges only charge as much as they do because people can pay it. They can only pay it because the loans are given to practically anyone that wants to go to school. They’re frequently government backed as well so the risk is low for student loan companies."

rareinsults,ffe9l8e,t1_ffe1kb7,1579840487.0,The girls at my work wear t shirts with cardigans or a blazer all the time. I can’t fathom being able to do that. Button down or polo shirt every day.
rareinsults,ffe9ccu,t1_ffe7vhk,1579840283.0,"I agree. The shirt doesn’t fit right in the neck or your tie is too tight if you’re choking.

Cringetopia,ffe8419,t1_ffe26vz,1579839275.0,"Gotta love yourself and be positive about yourself. A lot of shit on social media isn’t about that even if it says it is. You’re great, I’m sure, and being white and not fat doesn’t take away from that. 

My heritage is Latino but I was raised in a non Latino setting most of my life so sometimes I don’t know where I “belong” as far as race goes. I hardly speak any Spanish. So I just try to embrace my life how I was raised and just be who I’ve become through my experiences. 

I guess what I’m trying to say is be you and try to just embrace what you can. You’re all you’ve got. Don’t let people on social media get under your skin, they don’t know you. They’re just judging you based on limited aspects of you and that doesn’t make you who you are."

CasualConversation,ffb717i,t1_ffb4t6q,1579753515.0,Unpopular opinion on reddit but if you’re young and able get a second job. It’s not forever and it’s not fun but I’ve never saved more money in my life than when I was on two jobs. I made a pact with myself to not spend any of the money I made at my second job and saved up over $12k in a year from that alone plus what I saved up from my paycheck at my regular job. Not a ton in CA but where I am that’s definitely getting into house down payment range.
