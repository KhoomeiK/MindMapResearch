You need to first buy bellybands (dog diapers for male dogs basically). Look into training him to be used to wearing them so he doesn’t shred them off himself.

Your dog got recently neutered, therefore his entire groin area is very sore.

Your hard floors are slippery and require the groin muscles to work a bit harder to keep his legs and paws directly underneath him when walking on it so he doesn’t slip. This is probably uncomfortable for him and might be straining his stitches. 

Or he already has had a paw/leg slip under him and when he went to catch himself, hurt his groin area a bit and now he doesn’t want a repeat scenario.

dogs,fece1lm,t1_fea1j44,1578971691.0,"My boyfriend’s ex wife had an older chihuahua (about 7 yrs old) and his ex wife brought home an 8 week old pitbull puppy one day. They raised it with love and went to puppy classes and it was never neglected or abused in the slightest. When the pitbull puppy was about 4-5 months old, it jumped on the couch where the chihuahua was laying down, chewing on a toy. The pitbull puppy wanted the toy so she tried to take it from the chihuahua and the chihuahua growled at the pitbull puppy. The pitbull puppy’s reaction was that it bit the chihuahua right in the abdomen/stomach, tearing it wide open, and flinging it off the couch. The fall from being flung off the couch also shattered the Chihuahua’s kneecap. The chihuahua had to be rushed to the emergency vet to be sewn up and the poor thing looked like a baseball ever since. While my story is anecdotal and doesn’t apply to all pitbulls, pitbulls do not need to be abused to be dog aggressive. That is just how this particular pitbull was personality-wise and she could never be trusted around small dogs again after that incident. She also resource guarded hardcore against other dogs and was very dangerous if food or treats were brought out with other dogs nearby.

I have little dogs that big dogs seem to enjoy chasing.

So she sucks for not putting her small dog in the small dog part of the park and getting surprised when a big puppy acts like a puppy.

You however suck for not trying to get your bigger puppy off her chihuahua faster. Your dog could actually injure/maim/kill her dog very easily. You know your dog likes to take off after small dogs and nip at them so you *knew* this was going to happen. 

You should have tried to politely ask the lady before this interaction if she could take the chihuahua over to the small dogs section or if you both could spend some time trying to get both your dogs interacting positively with each other. Explain your dog is a puppy and how this would be a good chance to try training yours how to be gentle with a smaller dog under close supervision.

Either way, you need to work on your dog’s training. “Leave it” and “gentle” need to be ingrained in your pet’s brain for future interactions."

The way to get yourself off the hook for the car is by having the new owners register it in their name. Can’t do that without transferring the title and registration to them. Call the daughter and boyfriend, tell them to grab the VIN off the car and license plate # so you can get a new title and transfer it to them and make it official. I can’t imagine they’d say no to this since they obviously want the car. Go to the DMV website or DMV office in person and ask how to get a new title. Go from there. Until then, if they run any red lights or blow through toll roads without paying, you’ll be stuck with the bill, especially since you have zero proof that you sold/gave the car to them.

I have to take them to a groomer every two months to get their fur cut otherwise  their fur gets so long. Me and my boyfriend however find our own hair all over the place. I can’t tell you how much of my own long light brown hair I find when cleaning. I probably shed more than a golden retriever. Anyway, some of my friends that come over who are allergic to dogs have absolutely no negative reactions while visiting me and my boyfriend in our house for extended periods of time. I know there are no *absolute* hypoallergenic dogs but I’ll be damned if poodles don’t come super close."

Typically in breeder contracts it states if there is anything wrong with a puppy, such as a deformity or health issue that pops up as it grows, then returning the puppy and exchanging it for another one or returning the puppy for a refund is the way to make you (the buyer) whole again. 

This is because:
1. The breeder does not want their puppy to end up dumped in a shelter and

2. Does not want someone to claim something is wrong with an otherwise healthy puppy just to get a free second puppy. 

3. If there is a congenital defect, most breeders will not and should not breed the pair of dogs again because the defect will resurface in another litter.

Did you go look at the parents? Did you get a pedigree? Yorkies have very distinct fur and faces, a mutt should have been easy to identify.

In the future if you want a pure bred dog -

1. First look at the parents of the puppy.
2. Get the papers (pedigree)
3. Never pay pedigree prices for a non papered dog, it’s typically a backyard breeder trying to pass of unhealthy mutts as pure breds and the living conditions are not ideal, or it’s a scam to get your money in this case. 

You may not have a case because the breeder told you to return the puppy for a new one and you declined. That was the breeder trying to make you whole. If you sue the breeder, this will be brought up and the judge will most likely see it as you trying to get a free puppy since the breeder tried to rectify the situation."
