Eyebleach,ffp3zhp,t1_ffnp1b1,1580085673.0,I was reading this as if your 4 year old was a human child. Kinda forgot where i was (inasmuch comments on border collies) and thought no wonder your neighbors give you odd looks.

MadeMeSmile,ff53yy8,t1_ff4dtx7,1579579581.0,"I truly get PTSD with hearing ""barn cats"". After one of my sweet kids passed, my sperm donor told me how they would ""take care of the kittens from their barn cats"" (legit farm life 30s - 40s). Not going into details, it was not humane. I just realized this - thank you for reading. Time to deal with this emotion."
MadeMeSmile,ff53jz6,t1_ff4hhg7,1579579258.0,"Animals are definitely put into our lives for a reason. Don't know if anyone has ever said this before, however, this is definitely a belief of mine. I've had many felines interjected in my days, and each and everyone has played a major role in my life! A few have definitely kept me on this earth - more than any human could. Much love to you!"
