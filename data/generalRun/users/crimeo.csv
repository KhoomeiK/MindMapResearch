In some medical contexts, yes, you are called ""Dead"" if your heart stops beating for example, which you can obviously (although dangerous) come back from.

""Brain death"" can also still involve all your tissues being living yet is still professionally called death.

Also, what if your body decayed to a point where modern medicine cannot possibly revive it, and you confidently say ""Okay that means they're dead. See? Black and white"" BUT then somebody freezes the body and 100 years later, future medicine advances to where it CAN revive this body... were you wrong before about it definitely being dead? Why? It fit your definition. Did it resurrect?

Or (hint: correct answer) is ""death"" just not a sharp line in the sand in the first place?

Your complex machine shuts down in stages, over a span of time. The longer you go in that process, the lesser portion of that whole can be revived, and with GRADUALLY increasing difficulty. There is no sudden flip. Everything is a smooth, continuous, graded process at different rates in different organs, satisfying one definition but not another, blah blah.

A lot of people would say that the loss of integrity of recoverable information in your brain is death, not heart beat or oxygen or anything. And that, too, is gradual not sharp. The longer you wait, the mroe info is lost, but even late stages, you might be able to pull some rough information. So... dead? not dead? Neither is so clear."

It was hundreds of years at least and in some cases thousands, depending on the section, between the events supposedly taking place and them even being written down at all. If you admit to no supernatural force keeping the accuracy high in transmitted information, then even if God did speak to us way back when, we don't have any way to know wtf he said by now, because without supernatural protection, the meaning will have drifted miles away from what it was at the very start, through oral tradition and typos.

Since the book is the main basis for knowing how this religion works at all, that's a much more fundamental flaw than we started with....
