I have seen this. Which is why you work with more than one agency and you start having them submit you for jobs six weeks before your contract ends. You're much more likely to get into a hospital you won't hate. 

>	and that travel nurses are more likely to get stuck with the worst patient assignments when a charge nurse is doling out the room assignments for the shift. The staff employees the charge knows personally are probably gonna get the easier patients.

I have heard two nurses claim they were victims of this (on days when we were busy and ALL getting hammered by the luck of the draw) but I have never seen it happen to anyone anywhere I've worked and it's never happened to me in a year and a half as agency. 

If anything, I've seen them go harder on staff they know because they trust them to not end up making them write an incident report. 

Not saying that it's never happened anywhere, just that I have literally never, in 18 years working in healthcare, known a charge nurse who would dump the shittiest patients or heaviest loads on someone just to be spiteful to an agency nurse."

nursing,ffe8ewo,t1_ffd66n6,1579839521.0,"Oh, I know, I see it in some of my fellow agency nurses. 

I'm just saying that while someone might be qualified to take an assignment doesn't mean it's in anyone's best interests if they do. 

Some people aren't very clinically competent a year in, go chasing the filthy lucre of agency/travel money, and can't identify a-fib on a monitor. 

We had one nurse send a patient home with their leg bag hung upside down, and when it failed to drain and the patient came back with pyelonephritis, that nurse's contract got voided. 

Hospital has no investment in us mercenaries, so they don't care about cutting us loose; had it been a staff nurse, they'd put them on probation and reeducate. The agency isn't going to be super pleased so it's not like they're going to stick their necks out for the relative noob who just borked someone's kidneys with such a stupid mistake (I mean they have fucking arrows on them and the word DOWN right by the arrow, telling you which way the bag goes).

I had 3 years of nursing experience before I felt like I knew enough to go into a hospital where nobody knew me and hit the ground running after one orientation shift."

Don't beat yourself up if shit isn't clicking right away; it's a hard job and you'll be learning a fuckton those first two years. It's ok to make mistakes, and it's ok to take a minute to go in a corner and take a few deep breaths. 

It's also ok to speak up when you feel like your preceptors aren't teaching you what they should be. 

My first job was ten months of tele at a community hospital and I felt like I was getting the hang of it and took a different job at the University hospital I'd previously worked at as a tech and a scribe. Bigger, busier, real medicine, heavier patients. 

My preceptors knew I had some experience and would fuck off to do shit for their committees (shit that was supposed to be done on their time, not mine) or visit friends who had just had babies and were still on mother/baby. Or they'd be floating around doing all kinds of shit for everyone else on the unit. 

I'd get so behind on everything because I'd get called away from bedside to huddle or discharge planning meetings, and I had no idea how to juggle meds and all that other shit and charting, so meds would be late, then I'd be there for hours charting after the shift was done. 

I was a little proud so I wouldn't ask for help when I needed it, but when I'd finally finish charting, I'd ask how the hell they can manage all of it. They'd just say ""you just need to learn time management.""

Well, isn't it your job to help identify what I'm not managing well and correct it?

So I'd tell myself not to rock the boat, soon I'd be off orientation and I'd figure out my own system. I never got the chance. I was asked to resign just before I hit 90 days (and would have become a union member).

To be fair, I didn't help myself any, as I was pretty consistently 5-10 minutes late, even when the director suggested coming in 15 minutes before my shift so I could print out patient care summaries and plan my day better. So I did piss away some of the good will they might otherwise have had for me. 

TL;DR- never let fear of rocking the boat dissuade you from speaking up when you feel like you're not getting a good orientation. 

Learn from your mistakes but forgive yourself for not being born knowing everything. 

Pee when you need to. Drink lots of water. 

And breathe, goddamnit."
