""Legalise all drugs"" is only a good idea when your country is *legitimately* wrecked by them.

Widespread recognition of the systemic corruption was still (somehow) on the fringe, ""conspiracy theory"" areas of the public's collective ""everyone knows"" pool.

Memes - like the viruses they're modeled on - are made to try and penetrate as far as they can before dying. People (and AI) try new things to see if it's more pleasing to simpletons, resulting in the meme propagating further. 

In fact the whole ""text quote as a picture"" thing is an example of a meme's genetic code. They discovered long ago that big bold text inside a frame is *much* more popular and spreads much further than the exact same quote but in pure-text form."

TrueReddit,fef6zs9,t1_feecruc,1579049667.0,"There's a few things at play. 

1) There's always going to be a chance (depending on the time of day, mostly) that a percentage of them will just be casuals, browsing from /all.  
2) Just because it's TR doesn't have to mean that it's all cerebral and scientist-only POV's. In fact, the argument could be made that because such a large percentage of reddit is reactionary and juvenile (and always has been, even since before the Great Digg Migration) that it'd be weird if there *wasn't* at least some of that here.  
3) There's not actually THAT much to this particular story. The biotech involved is cool and cutting-edge, but is still fairly limited, minor-iterative-improvements and doesn't yet have genuine ""slippery-slope"" concerns attached to it by anyone taking it seriously.
