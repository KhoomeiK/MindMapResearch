CollegeRant,ffz4csj,t3_evbj30,1580363551.0,My goal is to study more meaningfully. Sometimes I'm reading or taking notes and not paying attention at all. My plan is to remain focus while studying and take more breaks when I feel like I'm not focused.
Wawa,ffvyq3z,t3_evg07q,1580277493.0,"Yeah if you're out of the system, they will send it by mail."
college,ffu8j13,t3_ev9486,1580236729.0,That not going to college so I could mature and get real world skills isn't a reflection of personal failure. I wasted so much money going to college when I wasn't ready for it.
college,ffu8cs4,t3_ev1ayw,1580236628.0,Making the Dean's list at any college is a reflection of good work ethic and motivation. Both should be celebrated regardless.
college,ffssk4o,t3_euuk2j,1580190907.0,"Your roommate is completely allowed to decide on not allowing your boyfriend over anymore. Be sympathetic dude. She said it makes her uncomfortable, accept that. Talk to an RA go change rooms. You guys aren't a good fit.

Or do long distance. It sucks but it doesn't end relationships like everyone says."
college,ffssaab,t3_eupbhw,1580190629.0,Talk to them directly. It's good to get used to confronting people respectfully now. Then get ear plugs. There's some really good ones at Walmart for cheap.
college,ffen9tm,t1_ffef6rf,1579855589.0,Yeah I was just thinking this. There are a lot of homeless students out there. Of course there are the guys who literally never learned to wash their ass but that's not always the case.
college,ffb991t,t3_esj1o8,1579755847.0,"I view this as a huge red flag. Not for being an asshole but for not offering office hours. This shows that if you need help or have a question, he's not going to care. I know you said you can't drop it but I think you should and take it again another semester with a different professor. I sense this attitude will show in the way he runs class."
college,ff8ihp1,t3_es5x8x,1579680017.0,"All the things that people worry about and overthink about socially are not things that other people notice. I would move on unless they approach you and say something. Also whenever I'm not sure how I'm being received socially, I look at their facial expressions and behavior. Ie: if they want to hang out again obviously they like you."
college,ff8ic6o,t3_es0eua,1579679814.0,"I guess you really have to weigh the pros and cons. It's really convenient to live on campus. There's always a great place to study, if you need help it's right there, and you're more aware of campus activities. However, it's expensive, cramped, and over priced. Are you willing to take out a loan for the college experience? 
I'm a transfer student, 24, and live on campus and I'm honestly miserable here. So my personal opinion would be no. It's not worth it."
college,ff8hyw8,t3_es6k37,1579679327.0,"I honestly had the same issue with a psych club. Even though you're interested, it doesn't sound like a good club. Do you have any other interests? It really sucks when the people make a club."
AskReddit,ff83c0b,t1_ff7cagv,1579664880.0,"The fucked up thing is, you're a minor you don't have a choice to just leave. Also yeah! I spent time in a hospital as a child and I really believe some hospitals are run by sociopaths. The things they do and say is just so fucked up."
AskReddit,ff2g3p3,t3_eqzdrn,1579504648.0,Look at that form!
schizophrenia,feqeuuu,t3_eq9uzc,1579341054.0,That's awesome! So proud of you and everyone in this sub!

AskReddit,fd0r5nd,t1_fd0js09,1578122644.0,"Also ""setting them loose""? Like they're animals? This person never stepped foot in a psychiatric facility."
college,fcti5tb,t3_eiqgof,1577944088.0,"So, I understand the frustration of going into a less supervised environment and then coming back home and everyone treats you the same. However, you won't be seen as an adult just because you went to college for a couple of months. It takes parents years after turning 18 to see you as an adult. Also, try to enjoy your time with your family. This dynamic of having everyone in the home lasts a minute. Before you know it, everyone will be moved out and only meeting up on a holidays.

Tldr; enjoy the people you are around right now because none of this lasts forever. Also give your family a break, them raising you happened in the blink of an eye. After a semester of college, they aren't going to suddenly treat you like an adult."
college,fcthae0,t3_eih4bb,1577943248.0,I honestly think it's pretty doable. You seem like you know how to budget your time. I think you'll be fine!
college,fcjch8y,t1_fcixtqt,1577682973.0,I honestly think he's just getting bullied being bald. This has nothing to do with age.
