Also, I don't know what the context of a Romulan Reclamation facility is. Is this new?"

With alcohol, they don't get the love and attention and presence that they love. If I had hot dogs, I actually don't know that I would have any personal space.

Okay my example would be I'm just going to have one hot dog. So I would actually just buy a single hot dog. And then I would go and buy two or three or four more hot dogs, all individually. And I would go to the same hot dog stand and feel shame and act like I hadn't been there already a bunch of times already.

TalesFromRetail,fezw0yo,t1_fezdpxk,1579462390.0,"I still think it's worth while saying that she arrived at the doors of the store at 5:59 pm. If I was reading, I would think so she's one of those.

There was a big UFC match and they were charging admission including people in the bar. It wasn't a lot of money, maybe $10. But we weren't really interested in watching the match so we laughed which was fine, we knew about when the charge was going to come into place. So we had lots of time to eat and be merry.

I felt like this was fair. Of course if you're paying that cover, that money is going to the house and doesn't compensate servers but at least people won't be camping maybe? At least if they're not interested in whatever is showing."

I know I feel angry and disappointed in a lot of activists and I'm talking about in real life, not online. Online might be an extension of one's activism but it isn't really activism in and of itself.

I've solidly burned-out as an activist twice, and as I'm sure you can relate, have the resulting mental health scars.

Bloody Sunday, or the Bogside Massacre,[1]was a massacre on 30 January 1972 in the Bogside area of Derry, Northern Ireland, when British soldiers shot 28 unarmed civilians during a protest march against internment. Fourteen people died: thirteen were killed outright, while the death of another man four months later was attributed to his injuries. Many of the victims were shot while fleeing from the soldiers and some were shot while trying to help the wounded.[2] Other protesters were injured by rubber bullets or batons, and two were run down by army vehicles.["
