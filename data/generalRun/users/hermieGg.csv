unpopularopinion,ffgtias,t3_et9oer,1579914663.0,I’m too short.
VirginiaTech,ffgezer,t3_etfrhm,1579904745.0,I advocate for the movies. I did them every week on top of the reading and video quizzes until I got an A and I finished early. But even If you just sprinkle one in every now and then u should be good. I personally think theyre easier than the twitter and interview assignments
college,ffct7kx,t1_ffcsvj5,1579806770.0,"Don’t take this the wrong way, but it’s because it doesn’t look like theres any kind of relationship to begin with. You had lab with her and that seems to be about it."
college,ffc985w,t3_essng3,1579794429.0,If it makes you feel better I’m in the same boat. My roommates alarm goes off at 5:30 and 6 am every damn day but she has not ONCE gotten up at that time. I yell at her every morning but she refuses to turn them off and I have not found a solution since I can’t sleep comfortably with ear plugs
teenagers,ffaxa12,t3_eskkmc,1579746627.0,Was gonna post an emoji for the lolz but I see all those downvotes on the emoji comments and I changed my mind
VirginiaTech,ffawr0w,t3_esk636,1579746278.0,"You do the work, you get an A. That’s it. It can be time consuming but the work is mindless"
college,ffaa6h4,t1_ffa4ag7,1579730895.0,I could be totally wrong but I don’t think they particularly care about the number of credits you’re taking. Also not really related to your above comment but online public speaking? that seems like a contradiction...
teenagers,ffa9oet,t3_esih10,1579730606.0,They look really good! Save one for me :)
unpopularopinion,ffa8qj8,t3_esf4ke,1579730076.0,I consider myself to be CF but the community does throw me off.... while I dont particularly like kids the way they refer to them as crotch goblins and hell spawn really rubs me the wrong way.  And the fact they call parents breeders is also kind of gross.
college,ffa82mo,t3_esig4s,1579729706.0,"Well its obviously better to go to class if you can manage it. But yes, you should be fine as long as you don’t make it a habit. I try to save an absence for when I’m having a really shitty day or when theres an unavoidable conflict"
obeyme,ff98v6z,t3_esd2e2,1579707526.0,These are great!!
obeyme,ff4kus9,t3_erm3xk,1579566057.0,wha!!! im jealous
AmItheAsshole,feys0vm,t3_eqx5oc,1579449870.0,YWBTA if you made plans just to not show. If they really said that they don’t care that you were upset they were late then thats all you should need to know. Maybe try to get them to understand your frustration one more time but if they still blow you off then they obviously arent great friends. Trying to purposefully antagonize them won’t make anything better nor do i think that it will change their minds.
teenagers,few9krd,t3_eqrl8w,1579407189.0,But I wear glasses and my iq is over 6000
VirginiaTech,fet06qv,t3_eqiyoh,1579370600.0,The material isn’t anything special but difficulty is very professor dependent. I would not recommend Withrow
teenagers,fesywdn,t3_eqixwj,1579370290.0,We’re no strangers to love...
AmItheAsshole,fesr9zo,t1_fesdrhr,1579368177.0,"Wow, this makes you a HUGE AH.  Even if you’ve never seen it that doesn’t mean it doesn’t make her ill. This blows my mind. As someone with IBS there are plenty of foods I avoid so I’m not in intense pain later on, but I’m obviously not going to announce that to everyone at the dinner party. And even if she doesn’t have a condition or allergy you should absolutely not be serving her something that she says makes her sick just to pull one over her. I’m appalled."
AmItheAsshole,fesqbp3,t1_fese58c,1579367909.0,Way out of line to make her sister prove her allergy/sickness. Even if she is making it up.
VirginiaTech,fesnget,t3_eqiheq,1579367099.0,"Personally, I wouldn’t take it just for a pathway since I hate public speaking and there are probably better options but if it really caught your eye it should be fine. For reference, I had to take it for my major and did end up with an A even though I don’t think I’m that good at public speaking. As long as you take your speeches seriously and practice a good amount you should be fine. But I wouldnt call it an “easy” A because I’m pretty sure everyone else in my group didn’t get one. Speeches are something like 56% of your total grade so you have to practice a lot so you don’t flub them. On the other hand, you are only in class half the time and the speeches are more or less the only homework you have. Definitely doable, but I would never take it by choice. 

Tl;dr if you like public speaking and are willing to invest time into your speeches then it should be fine. But also ew, public speaking."

My mom said the reason she gifts me another build a bear every christmas is to make up for the loss but I still get sad whenever I think about abandoning him LOL. I can only hope whoever found my bear kept it and made good use of him instead of throwing him in the trash
