AskReddit,ffln8m7,t3_eu5c9m,1580041733.0,Bi woman here: probably because they're hoping she's bi or just not giving a fuck about looking femme.
AskReddit,ffliwjl,t1_ffipzgs,1580040195.0,"I was 21 and living in a shared basement apartment with no television. I worked at Wendy's. I got called in early and was one of two adults that showed up. We never opened the dining room and I ran drive through from 10AM to 2AM. The line wrapped the building for most of the day.  I had no idea the size and scope of what happened for several years, and the first time I saw the actual footage was on YouTube. I live in Pittsburgh. It's like a time warp. Even now, when supposed 'big shit' happens... a whole lot of Pittsburghers are paying zero attention."
AskReddit,ffkmb0c,t1_fepxopp,1580025110.0,I had to listen to him scream for over an hour before Fall Out Boy in '18. It was painful. I wish I'd have known how horrible it would be so I could have entered the building later and avoided his... 'set.'
AskReddit,ffkgidj,t1_fes8jb2,1580022382.0,"I just saw them for the first time in September of '18 and already have my Hella Mega ticket in hand. I am absolutely obsessed with them and they're my favorite band, so I'll just tell you this: even when they're tired as hell, they are giving you everything they have. They were gassed and nearing the end of MANIA when I saw them. Patrick was obviously straining and Pete looked extremely anxious/ready to run away at any moment, Joe looked exhausted and Andy was, well, Andy. But they gave it everything they had. I respected the hell out of that and never questioned my decision to buy a seat at HM. Hoping they're better rested this time."
GenderCritical,fff7zru,t1_fff5boc,1579877999.0,"In my hospital, yes. We laugh it off. I'm female and have been groped and grabbed by both sexes."
GenderCritical,fff7jrk,t3_et5oxq,1579877693.0,"I've worked for two years at a hospital that exclusively treats mature adults and elderly (no L/D, no peds). We have a lot of male nurses and aides. In two years, I've had three patients refuse or express fear over a male caregiver, out of thousands. But when it happens, the guys understand. They know why. Any male who claims to not understand and defer to the patient's wishes is suspect, imo. Especially for intimate care."
AmItheAsshole,fff4z9z,t1_fff1qlq,1579875835.0,Wow.
fatlogic,ffdebks,t1_ffbp9i5,1579819079.0,"Same. So many people complimented me before my celiac was diagnosed. I was in agony and planning my own funeral. I also work in a hospital with a cancer center. I don't mention weight. As a side note, it never offended me that people mentioned mine, but it scared me... knowing that everyone knew and could see, and they thought it looked good on me."
GenderCritical,ffcei3s,t1_ffc91ey,1579797732.0,I still use the masculine version of my first name.
GenderCritical,ffbetyl,t1_ffb8nys,1579762234.0,"Same. I'm a 40 year old GNC tomcat (masculine looking bisexual woman). If I were a child today, I'd have not been tolerated, told I'm trans, and carved up. There'll be no more of me in this generation coming up-- the traditional binary is being pushed so hard."
GenderCritical,ffb2kzh,t1_ff9qh27,1579750201.0,"For breast implants before 18-- only if a girl is severely lopsided. Happened to one of cousins and she was grateful to have it fixed at 16, before her shoulders and spine became lopsided/tilted, too. Both, just for looks? Nah."
AmItheAsshole,fex05y0,t1_fet82te,1579422176.0,"I also have celiac and have just straight up told people, I can't do any more restrictions without medical necessity. I still have pain and am restricting various other ingredients (soy, corn, processed sugar, etc.) to find out what else might be bothering me. Adopting a vegan or vegetarian diet on top of this long and complicated process isn't even on the radar."
unpopularopinion,fem6pzq,t3_epry71,1579241710.0,"I have a friend who is turning 30, has a bachelor's of science, works full time, and still lives with his parents. They both have cancer or are in remission. Both are still working, but he has no interest in leaving them. He knows they aren't going to live into their 80s or 90s, and he loves them. He's uninterested in LifeScripting. I understand. I just wish everyone did."
AskWomen,fem64rz,t3_eps958,1579241105.0,"I haven't. I refuse to take on more responsibilities. I have rent, electricity, natural gas, cell phone, Netflix, and a tiny student loan payment. That's it. I could easily afford more, like internet service at my place or a nicer apartment or a vehicle. But I just keep stashing cash, for retirement and emergencies and whatever else."
AmItheAsshole,fem59o9,t1_fek26tv,1579240233.0,"Eh, careful. My mother made her threats, too. I ran off two days after graduation and went no contact until I was 27. I made her pay for scaring me (I'm female and was terrified I'd be raped or worse at such a school in the late 90s). We've reconciled, but she's still angry and I'm still holding her at arm's length. I'm 40 now and this is as good as it'll ever be, and I was a laughably calm, cowed child who just didn't do well in school or with day schedules (I now work nights at a hospital, so that's fine). Only pull this if you honestly think it's your last shot, because it could be."
vagabond,fe9jv0u,t1_fe9j1qf,1578938411.0,"I'm already gluten free and have tried eliminating: corn, soy, dairy, meat, processed sugar, caffeine, citrus, and also tried low carb and veganism. So far, I'm stumped. The GI specialist I'm seeing next month may have more ideas. I already don't take any medications and I don't drink alcohol, ever. I'm stumped and so are my GP and first GI doctor."
AskReddit,fe7m8vu,t1_fe7472q,1578916367.0,"Can confirm. I live in Pitcairn, PA. :)  It's a shithole outside Pittsburgh."
vagabond,fe7epx4,t3_enzbxn,1578913608.0,"After about seven years of couch hopping and traveling the US and Canada, I developed abdominal  pain that won't quit. I'm a US citizen and needed insurance. It's been two years and they still don't know wtf is wrong with me, other than getting diagnosed with celiac disease, which helped my stomach but has done shit for the rest of the pain and discomfort. I'm domesticated now, but not that happy. I live to work."
childfree,fe7d65b,t3_eny7ga,1578912938.0,"I write fantasy, and all my characters are CF (I've made up a lot of wild, but believable, reasons why). No publisher will touch my stuff. They want to see kids. I've been writing for almost 30 damn years. Following this topic to see if anyone has ever had any luck or if I just suck or am in the wrong genre or what."
AskReddit,fe7bgrn,t1_fe675du,1578912473.0,It's so beautiful!!
AskReddit,fe5fcs5,t1_fe4xbs7,1578868818.0,"""Here's my number, if interested in talking more"" isn't creepy. Creepy, to me, is the guy who doesn't hear from you and comes back in, tried to find you, asks coworkers about you, tries to find out where and when you lunch, tries to find your home. Lack of a response is a response. As long as we all keep that in mind, I'm good."
AskReddit,fe4436r,t1_fe2e5jo,1578855628.0,"Not for me, no. I've received a number I wasn't interested in once. I just threw it away and chalked it up to crossed signals. I have gained two good friends this way, too, and I've given out my number unasked, too. Someone has to make some kind of 'move'. It's my job to talk to people, and I figure there's no harm in a number provided there's no pressure on either side."
childfree,fe1fisa,t3_enhyrp,1578825954.0,"Agreed. I work in an adults-only hospital. No pediatrics, no labor and delivery, no obstetrics. Nada, none. People bring children in to visit. Little ones, who touch and smear and pull on things and get grime everywhere and put things they find on the floor in their mouths! Our hospital is very clean, but no hospital is ever clean enough to roll on the floors or lick the stainless! Children don't belong everywhere. PS: we also don't handle end of life care very often or for very long, most of what we do is treat and discharge (ortho, cardiac, stents, GI). It's not like it's the kid's Final Goodbye to a loved one. Leave them at home."
AmItheAsshole,fe1cqcu,t3_engdkr,1578825120.0,"NTA. Joy sounds insecure. I was insecure at that age and my bestie let me know as soon as her engagement was announced that she just wanted me to be there, as a VIP guest. No expectations, nothing, just arrive and have fun. So I did. Perhaps that would be best for Joy. You're not an a-hole. Most girls get a kick out of the finery and dressing up. For those that don't... it's not kind to even ask. (Not that you were unkind to ask! You were obviously unaware Joy has an issue.)"
unpopularopinion,fe1baeq,t1_fe0kyuz,1578824652.0,"Same. I stick my phone, which has a case for folded bills and debit card, under the strap on occasion. I would never go diving into the actual cups like I've seen some women do, but from under a strap? Meh."
AskReddit,fe0ib3u,t1_fdzu37g,1578813853.0,"Agreed. I work in a hospital and meet new people every day, by the dozens. Patients, their friends and families, new nurses/aides/techs... I'm single and always looking for friends or a date if we're having fun talking, just write your number down and hand it over. Don't ask me for mine. I'm working and I can't be rude."
childfree,fdx545a,t3_en80ex,1578765454.0,"It doesn't get better, either. I'm 40 and bisexual. Cannot locate anyone even resembling an acceptable partner."
relationship_advice,fdb3nmn,t1_fda27ep,1578253342.0,"Yes. I have reason to believe my mother did this, to keep my father away. It worked; I never saw his face and she only told me who he was once he died when I was 39. She told him she was pregnant, and his reaction was so awful she told him Something to make him stay away. It happens."
fatlogic,fd8rr66,t3_ek6vqr,1578222471.0,"If you're underweight or flirting with it (low healthy BMI), cancer will fuck up your outlook. Generally, we need a little bit of fat. A. Little. Bit. In case we get sick and eating becomes a problem (chemo, especially). Nobody needs 100 extra pounds. Ten should do ya and is well within acceptable range."
FallOutBoy,fd820hz,t1_fd69cvi,1578212978.0,Whoa!
FallOutBoy,fd81zjr,t1_fd7hdql,1578212966.0,Same. I ordered a t-shirt (black with gray lettering) with this lyric on it.
fatlogic,fd7zg11,t3_ek9vqn,1578212180.0,"I am more beautiful now. Instead of listing purple prose about plushness and moonlight and how pleasing my body is To Others,  now I have a goddamn machine. My shoulders are hard, my collarbones are out, I can feel my abs beneath the greatly reduced flab. My fierce heart isn't clogging, and my skin has never looked better. Try harder."

childfree,fd7shsd,t3_ek72gw,1578209407.0,All my eggs are contaminated with the genes for scoliosis and celiac disease. What the fuck to this.
fatlogic,fd5xupe,t1_fd4ywhw,1578182871.0,"Word. I try to eat local as much as I can. I figure, it's not doing anyone any good for me to be munching on avocados and cashews from California on the daily when I live outside Pittsburgh. Meat, dairy, and a ton of veggies are extremely local here, if you know where to look and can get access."
AskWomen,fd55dw0,t3_ejvkej,1578174332.0,"I'd only wear them while going out. I work in a hospital as a transporter, very hands on. I already don't 'notice' being groped or hugging patients and steadying them, helping them to not fall. I do dislike the rare occasion where this makes my patient uncomfortable or embarrassed. Lean on me, grab me, I don't care, it's just flesh, I just don't want them to fall!"
FallOutBoy,fd53k18,t1_fd53as2,1578173862.0,"'Sex' isn't offensive. Crashing hips, however, would raise her eyebrows. She's a weird blend of catholic upbringing with born again as an adult."
FallOutBoy,fd53337,t1_fd52owx,1578173757.0,"""Ma, Patrick is married!"" ""Well then I guess he'd know! Haha!"" Sex doesn't offend her, within a marriage."
FallOutBoy,fd52h6u,t1_fd52843,1578173627.0,"Probably. FOB is always playing in my apartment. She bops a little and knows some of the choruses, but she tends to think their songs are about love and dancing."
FallOutBoy,fd522jx,t1_fd518jp,1578173490.0,"My ma is just very sheltered and innocent about everything but weed. She did grow up in the 70s, but in a strong church. I also convinced her 'crashing hips' is a dance."
FallOutBoy,fd515f6,t1_fcz7y0a,1578173170.0,"""Ma, a one night stand to a musician is when they play one night in a city and then leave. They play in Pittsburgh and then Philly the next night. One night stand.""  ""Oh, okay! What interesting lives they must have, traveling so much!"""
AskReddit,fczqbsv,t3_eje7fc,1578106749.0,"I work in a hospital in a small group of a dozen inhouse transporters. So, not only do we have next to no shame about bodies, we also don't have the kind of boundaries you find in office jobs. My best 'this isn't what it looks like' moment had to be getting caught in the lounge (badge scan access X2, no chance of a patient seeing or wandering in) with my arm completely stuffed up the back of my coworker's scrub top, applying tattoo goo to new work. My coworker may or may not have been saying to rub it harder (it itches)."
FallOutBoy,fcy68h7,t3_eja7ge,1578075339.0,"I'm 40 and still have to sing over him in the car. ""SHE, she bakes like you, only sweeter!"" and ""this ain't a scene, it's a FOG JAMMED arms race!"" My mother is the epitome of Little Old Church Lady and thinks FOB is sweet."
childfree,fcy39ok,t3_ejetjk,1578074166.0,"I agree. I'm pretty much naturally infertile due to pcos and the resulting scarring. I feel incredibly bad for women who are at the mercy of other people to decide their futures and access options. As for aging, it's been wonderful for me. I'm 40 and a lot of things have helped: learned to eat properly, work a physical job and get a ton of exercise, finally learned to take care of my skin. I'm more attractive now than I was as a fat, broken out, weak teen. The whole idea of being an incubator by natural law... guess nature opted me out, then. Lucky me! Lucky me a thousand times and forever."
childfree,fcgee4i,t3_eh1bnu,1577639135.0,Agreed. I have celiac disease and scoliosis. Both can and should be eliminated by opt-out. I can still contribute to society and make a positive impact without spreading my shitty genes around. So many people just don't get it.
fatlogic,fc89o84,t3_egnj0f,1577530003.0,"Work in hospital, can't confirm any of this. I've cared for a 73- year-old heroin user. I've taken a 25-year-old to the morgue after a massive fat-induced heart attack. I gotta see data on this."
fatlogic,fc897qy,t3_egin25,1577529702.0,"Yes. It is entirely possible for a tight, muscular, 'skinny' person to physically weigh more pounds than a chubby, weak person of the same height. What a revelation. A pound is a pound, but if we're talking volume, absolutely. As with most FA globber, though, I don't think this is what they mean. I'm not sure *what* they mean."
unpopularopinion,fc85yhq,t3_egdsdd,1577527604.0,"I believe something is attracting men to nursing. I work in a hospital and male nurses are becoming more and more common. On one hand, it's awesome! On the other, it's very much a hospital for the elderly and many elder ladies are terrified of the male nurses (these are the same ladies who had enormous families with a male doctor attending). A few of the guys have said they prefer our hospital because we do not treat peds whatsoever."
AskWomen,fc2fhxc,t1_fc2ff0k,1577357247.0,"Because they don't want to dilate my cervix. Because it's ""too painful"" for women who haven't given birth. Despite the fact I've already had a hysteriosalpingiogram with dilation before. It's natalist bullshit."
