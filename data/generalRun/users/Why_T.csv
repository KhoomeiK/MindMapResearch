EverythingScience,fgkqg76,t1_fgjlviu,1580871334.0,It’s super easy. You just count the rings.
Whatcouldgowrong,fgifvpe,t1_fgieuux,1580820321.0,lol. Chrysler/Fiat never resolves issues. At this point i believe they are trying to make the worst product available.

3d6,fgbgh6p,t1_fgajvhk,1580661863.0,Season 9 you can choose flying tiefling or flying aasimar. However you don’t get that feature until you are level 5.

StLouis,fg7jrot,t1_fg6h2qd,1580594211.0,I don't think it was lack of business that he's closing. I talked to Steve and he said that The Urge is in the studio working on a new album and going to start touring soon after. He just doesn't have the time to run it and wants to focus on his music.
osx,fg3oq94,t1_fg3du29,1580486391.0,OP said he wants portability. An iPad is probably his best option. I use my iPad for exactly this.

technology,fg3gq6v,t1_fg281gt,1580481101.0,That requires the hacker to have physical access to your device. Unless you're a world leader or a CEO of a F500 company theres a good chance people aren't interested in obtaining your phone so they can read your text messages
technology,fg23qug,t1_fg23nne,1580437481.0,I’m specifically talking about iPhone. Which doesn’t do this because it’s a bad idea.
ElegooMars,fg237ki,t1_fg1to9y,1580437220.0,We need a solid FAQ. And a warning when people go to post that they have to read the FAQ.

technology,fg1tfk5,t1_fg1s35m,1580432938.0,Shitty apps be shitty. People who are concerned about their privacy shouldn’t download and give permissions to Shiite apps.
technology,fg1sumn,t1_fg1r68p,1580432697.0,Natively all apps have zero permissions and have to request them. No app has any permission you didn’t specifically give it. If it’s using your mic/camera/location it’s because it asked and you allowed it.
technology,fg1slsc,t1_fg1rngd,1580432590.0,"I don’t think I’ve ever had iOS crash. Only apps. So yes, swiping up from the bottom always works. 

The swap from android to iOS I’ve always heard the loss of the bottom buttons is the worst part. But iOS works well without them. 

Apple phones come with a set of headphones that use the lightning port. And the battery on the 11 is absurd. Unless you literally are on your phone intensively for 12 hours straight a day you won’t need to charge while listening to your music."
technology,fg1kr4v,t1_fg1jgaq,1580428858.0,Your iPhone is about the only thing most likely NOT spying on you. Assuming you haven’t given shitty apps permissions they shouldn’t have.

mildlyinteresting,fg1cgo7,t1_fg1c8wl,1580424669.0,It’s like DRM for car parts.
mildlyinteresting,fg1bz95,t1_fg14680,1580424439.0,"Those things are put in the vehicle to cut out 3rd party parts suppliers. 

Say you rear end someone. Normally the body shop will bill your insurance for factory parts and buy cheap knock off parts. There’s very little visual difference. Because the 3rd party can just copy it. 

However with these little inclusions they are copyrighted/trademarked (I’m not clear on the difference) so now it’s 100% obvious when you buy knock off parts. And Jeep can continue to make huge profits on parts sales."
