poetry_critics,ff6epe6,t3_errtwd,1579625576.0,"I think it’s a good idea, however my only issue with this is that it’s a bit too “tell” rather than “show”. Readers are smart and they can read between the lines. When you tell a bit too much it lacks the depth and I don’t connect with it as much. Give the reader more work to do, haha. 

I think the ideas good though!"
poetry_critics,ff6e8sy,t3_erbuu2,1579625290.0,"I think it works well from “paves the way” but before that the rhyming of heart with hear etc, doesn’t really work. 

The language also kind of loses me in the middle, perhaps it’s too abstract to know exactly what you’re trying to say. 

However, I like the technique you were going for and found it quite interesting. I think if you worked on it a bit you’d have something quite solid"
PoetsWithoutBorders,ff4fl9l,t3_eriur9,1579562430.0,"All I can say is: God I love women. I think you really captured that intimate relationship between two women. The giggles and full acceptance of every aspect of you. Your use of humour is great

PoetsWithoutBorders,fee4ot0,t1_fecw8vh,1579026331.0,"I don’t particularly think this is very good but I’m trying different things so I guess this is more conversational. 

Taken from a male POV about a lover in my head but I have loved a girl before even if I’m not the narrator this isn’t my story. 

Never done salvia either I’ve seen the YouTube videos and know I wouldn’t be able to handle thst shit 

Sitting down in the shower is a godly experience

Thank you for taking the time to read nuzzy"
PoetsWithoutBorders,fedj0uq,t3_eo1sep,1579012766.0,"Now you’ve said that oleander is poisonous it gives this a different read. What’s interesting is the beginning is very storybook- imagine children in a forest and games with wooden swords, then you have the hunter later. It appears people are using a location to do both innocent and dangerous, and the forest itself is both innocent and dangerous- like oleander you wouldn’t expect to be poison. 
I know nuz pointed out “a dawn pink wish” as one of his favourite lines, but I think the use of the word wish and promise is sitting off with me. Doesn’t read as well with the rest of the poem imo. I think i find them too infantile I’m sorry!

I find it interesting as well you used bow in the title and bough in the poem- not entirely sure why you chose to do this but it is interesting 

Can’t read the word zephyr without thinking of the RHCP song haha. 

I like the weapons amongst the foliage. Pretty can be dangerous. Juxtaposition is the shit it’s so powerful I use it a lot too. 

I’ve been really enjoying all your other work too, frog. I fuck widdit"
PoetsWithoutBorders,fedfqub,t3_enyfkw,1579010304.0,There’s some great imagery here. I get a vibe of yearning more than anything from this and obviously a deep sadness and loss. I think separating the poem into parts is a bit problematic and ruins the flow. Also because you change subject it separates them too much- like two completely separate poems.

OCPoetry,fe5ujpy,t1_fe5u72o,1578875266.0,"I understand what you’re saying I just suggested that because the stanza was lacking in substance 

It is reinstating but I think they do that with every first line. It just doesn’t seem necessary. They could take it out and it would make a difference 

As I said it was a personal preference."
OCPoetry,fe5t74c,t3_enria6,1578874404.0,Nice. I’d personally remove stanza 4 as it’s just repeating what you’ve said in other stanzas
PeopleFuckingDying,fe4h2cj,t1_fe3yfcw,1578859203.0,Maybe she just minding her own business
PoetsWithoutBorders,fe440y7,t3_enje1g,1578855610.0,"So obviously this is a very personal piece. The opening and closing are the strongest parts- particularly the closing. The line that stands out the most to me is “for the balance and sanity of this world, I wish I was never in your life” cause god knows we’ve all had that feel. 

Is it you are purity or your purity?

I think some phrasing of ideas border slightly on cliche. I think waving a fist at god has been done many times before. And for me that kind of takes away from the personal nature of the piece. But it’s my opinion, if you feel that’s how you felt then damn that’s how you felt. 

Sometimes things are devastating- that’s just how it is."
PoetsWithoutBorders,fdzqjqz,t1_fdzjw7d,1578793493.0,"A maladaptive behaviour is a behaviour that is used for coping to a situation you find difficult (a heartbreak), but not that helpful- like biting your nails which I’ve done since probably about 4 years old. 20 years. 
You don’t do something like that for that long without tearing a couple off. 

I want so bad to be mentally healthy- represented by not having to bite my nails any more. But at the same time I wanna rip them all off as a form of self harm. 

Thank you for reading and giving your perspective"

So I’ll see

Appreciate you reading :)"
PoetsWithoutBorders,fdw6due,t3_en6ll6,1578755502.0,"“Grey pepper flecked film” is so good. Conjures that image instantly. 

For me, this gives me the impression of a relationship that’s gone so sour you forgot the reason you loved them in the first place. But then when you put time into it, the memories (or the popcorn) comes to the surface. 

That was my idea from it anyway 

Well done I enjoyed it"

PoetsWithoutBorders,fds1084,t3_empus5,1578692606.0,"I like the ‘gain too. I’d leave it. Don’t think it’s too edgy or anything the disgusting imagery is great for my taste. 

I don’t vibe with the crumbs and scraps of meat line. I like everything but “for you to take” seems like you only wrote it to get a rhyme. Possibly work with thst a bit. 
The “mockery of caring” line seems a bit forced however. Those kind of cheapen the rest of the great lines you got here.

Filthy cots and stenches of rot- forever yes"
PoetsWithoutBorders,fdrcsvv,t1_fdravbq,1578682604.0,"Always appreciate you reading my work nuzzy and taking the time to write to me. I love violent imagery, don’t think I can get away form it if I tried. 

Funnily enough no romances I’ve had have been abusive (minus one but we weren’t together), but I admit I’m attracted to people that are batshit crazy. We all have our Achilles heel I guess. 

👍"
PoetsWithoutBorders,fdnxu5q,t3_embsin,1578595045.0,"Hot damn. That’s some good shit.
What do you think about getting rid of “in vain” in the fag-end of summer line? When I read it out loud without it sounded better imo. That’s my favourite line in this. 

This conjures up such miserable, rainy, English vibes for me. 

“My mind runs rumrotten and dreadblack” hell yeah. 

Love the last stanza. Concludes the poem well"
PoetsWithoutBorders,fdns8lf,t3_embzxn,1578591790.0,"You’ve got quite a strong opener there. Visuals are good. 

Loses me a bit on the next stanzas. “One gloomy day” sounds a bit cliche to me? 

“Between darknesses” is a great line. 

I think you could get rid of the “hold hands in a circle” as I feel the other visuals already create that impression. And it’s a bit “tell rather than show”. 

I’d get rid of “this is what they were passing around” as we already know that. 
Last stanza falls a bit flat for me unfortunately.  Feel you could expand on the idea a bit more. Expand on what you’re trying to say with the poem and what it means- I feel you did this in where you were stating that the poems bring them together- but then what? Hope this helped a bit"

PoetsWithoutBorders,fck1pgz,t3_ehefpy,1577713896.0,"I really relate to this. I relate to the feeling of an abusive childhood, but not abusive “enough”. I feel that a lot. 

And then the feeling that you have no choice but to act out for it. It’s all you’ve ever known is destruction, and when they stop hurting you you have to hurt yourself. 

At the end i assume you were being chased by police/ pulled over for whatever reason, and it kind of represents being in trouble with the law. But you can’t stop, this is just how it is now. Everything is already written. And you already know they will leave you, so fuck it right?

I did it because I had such a bad night last night and this is the result and I wanted to express it to other people. 

If I said any of this to people I know it would be “don’t say that. I’m gonna go tell your mom” lol. 

Yes those are about scars you already have and making more. 

That line I threw in last second because I guess I just wanted to say it? It was like I’d written this piece and then I was like “fuck it all I just wanna die”. And that’s what happened. But I agree with you and I would take it out."

It’s all well saying “do a hobby and meet someone through there” but it has never worked for me like that. Everyone that has every meant anything to be has appeared in my life suddenly. Granted it was on places like tinder so you do have to kind of be searching. Or not searching so much as being open to someone coming in. But genuinely it’s been so hard and lonely and scary. You start to feel like you’ll be alone forever. And cause we’re hsps it’s so hard for us to trust and let our guard down. 

I spent a long time crying in bed. And doing things for myself. And writing poetry or whatever outlet you can let the sad leave from. 

Then just wait. And someone will come. They always do. And it’s always when you don’t expect them to or in the form you’re not expecting."
antiwork,fc2rnlh,t3_efuvej,1577372030.0,"So here’s my story: 

Wanted to pierce my ear lobes because, yknow, self expression and all that. I repierced a hole I already had and went into work (in a cafe). Immediately was jumped on by my section coordinator: “you cant have those in. We’ve had someone before that refused to take them out and we fired them”. I said she’s not my manager and she doesn’t have that authority. They take 6 weeks to heal. It’ll be fine. 

Then saw my lovely manager. She laughed and said it wasn’t a big deal just hide in the back when inspectors come. 

Then I had multiple managers (of different departments of which this isn’t their business) take me into the back and complain to my nice manager to tell me I can’t we are them. I would explain “hey  waiting for them to heal. My manager said I could”. And they’d be like “ok I guess.” 

I then got two more piercing in my lobes. Paid £35 cause I genuinely thought it would be ok to have them heal. I was told by my manager to put bandaids on and I did every time I was in. Also note: other cafes are ok with bandaids covering new piercings. 

Unfortunately I went in one day ON MY FUCKING DAY OFF, and was seen by a commercial manager. The big guys. She complained about my ears. They had meetings and my nice manager had to call HR to try and convince them to let me keep them. They said it was unacceptable. 

So I was brought into the back and told I couldn’t do what I wanted to my own body. Was told I could take them out every shift. No way. Pain and infections. 

Took them out and it was so fucking painful. Had to get my mom to help me cause they were so tight in there. No way they would ever fall out anyway. 

So that sucks."
