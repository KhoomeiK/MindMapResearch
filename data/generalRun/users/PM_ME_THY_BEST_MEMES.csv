I have met all types of people from all over the USA:

Okay buddy. Sure thing. I have a strange feeling I'm not the one who sits on a high chair in this conversation. I wonder how much of the USA you've traveled and lived in or how diverse groups of people you have met in the USA.

I don't think I'm better than anyone. I just feel that I've seen enough of the USA and met enough groups of people to have come to a conclusion that the vast majority of USA citizens don't know much more about the history and the source of the cultures in the country other than what's taught in highschool."
agedlikemilk,ffb1v1d,t1_ffafdya,1579749698.0,"Mm I grew up in a conservative mostly white part of USA. Then I moved around in (and frequently visited) the deep South, west coast,  wild Western States, the mid-western States and the northeast. I've been here and there, and with it I honestly grew up with the propaganda of USA is the best, USA culture is awesome.

I went to Japan for the first time, and holy darn did I feel like no where in USA came even close to competing with Tokyo in terms of technical advancement, I felt like I was going into the future. But fuck, I had my USA pride, I stuck with it. I respected Japanese culture (thought I knew little of the language) and thought different world = different cultures to be expected.

Then I visited Europe. I had people I knew there who I met in USA. My friend told me about how people in her village had been there for so many generations. There's history and culture that comes from just purely living somewhere for over countless decades. I don't think USA has nearly as much culture or identity as Japan or Europe because the USA simply haven't even been existent long enough. Some things only come with time. And the thing that blew my mind is that USA has been trying to emulate Europe and it's culture for most of it's early USA history (this is obvious as most immigrants were from Europe). (For example, there are more English dialects I'm the small country of UK than the entire North America, due to the complex history and culture that developed there for over a thousand years)

I don't think people in USA really know the history. Did you know that Hawaii was ""Annexed"" by imprisoning the queen of Hawaii until she was forced to sign away her nation? Did you know that the early European settlers were only able to get by with the help of the Americans? Did you know of all the conflicting cultures of the USA exists, and has always existed, from the founding of the colonies? The colonies initially didn't even want to unite under a nation, there were those who wanted to gain independence from the Britians and then stay as separate states, going their merry way. Did you know that the wealth of the black men were intentionally destroyed by regulations that deprived the black veterans of the same benefits as white veterans after ww2? Did you know that one of the reasons bison (the all American mammal) almost went extinct due to the idea behind the phrase ""a Buffalo dead is an Indian gone""?

Do you think a given USA citizen knows any of this?

I've been around, I've met countless people from buskers to high ranked government officials. I've traveled far and wide in this country. Unfortunately, I don't think USA really values teaching the children of the country the history of what occured, but rather they teach the ideas of what USA is meant to represent; USA is like a girl/guy getting ready for a prom date, getting a dressed up to show the best side. Unfortunately, a deeper relationship only occurs after you under the deeper intricacies and the history of others / institution, including the USA.

I honestly feel betrayed and frustrated at the propaganda I have been fed my entire life in school, college, and Hollywood movies. I went significantly out of my way to learn more of USA, and even then I only fully realized the lack of history and culture USA has after I visited well established countries in Europe and Asia. With this said, I know many USA citizens don't leave the country, let alone their tiny state. There's not even an encouragement or a culture of trying to understand what little history of USA in the country, and you're telling me that you believe most USA citizen understand the deep history and origins of the tidewater/Quaker/applachian/El Notre/etc people? Unfortunately, I believe most people take the world as they see it with little or no desire of understand it deeper, and with a country like USA that does not even try to teach it's citizens of deeper history beyond the founding fathers & revolution without discussing the difference types of people & why the country has been what it was and why it is what it is now, I don't think most of USA citizens love it beyond a child loving it's parents in it's youth = love the mother for the safety and the father for providing, and this is an honest love, but it is not a love of understanding the parents as humans at a deeper and a fundamental level. Unfortunately, the culture of USA doesn't support the latter."
agedlikemilk,ffaf4s3,t1_ffabtuj,1579734260.0,"Hm.
Do you think most of US citizens know the origins of their own culture?
That's what I mean by uncultured. You can be infatuated with a crush, but you can't truly love them until you understand them. Same for the country of USA.

agedlikemilk,ff6ebjl,t1_ff5zqt5,1579625337.0,"You're not wrong. With time, culture will be more concrete in the USA. Something that is of note is, there are so many diverse cultures in the USA, very unique. Over time, whether or not the original culture was imported or not doesn't matter, the cultures will all be ""American"". My question is, will the different cultures be accepting of others?"
agedlikemilk,ff69iyw,t1_ff617mx,1579622291.0,"Yeah, it's the culture of El Norte, unique to the USA and Mexican border that even Mexicans see as different and distinct. California and Texas was literally a part of Mexico until not too long ago, populated by Catholic hierarchy commanded by the Mexican and Spanish government. Of course this culture is unique, but it is of Spanish American culture. Most of USA culture comes from the British Puritans, Virginia farm owners, southern slave owning plantation owners, and independent survivors. All influenced more or less by the European influence they come from.

It's okay to love USA, but if you don't even understand the country, where it comes from, and how the current cultures are formed, do you really know the country? I believe understanding more of the country = deeper love. Otherwise, it's just an infatuation."

todayilearned,ff2exfb,t1_ff22vm0,1579503296.0,"Most people live their life without ever wondering what life could be. People have a really difficult time trying to understand something they haven't ever experienced before. This is why there is so much divide in the USA, the divisions are so distinct that people never have the reason to leave their bubble, this is assuming people realize there is a different world out there.

Country go-getter self helpers with gun rights have only known others like themselves, they thank the US government for providing them grants for lands after ww1 and they have an innate European culture they embraced from in forms of cowboys, beer, etc. This isn't wrong, it's Noble in some ways, they respect those who show respect and want to maintain their identity and independence.

Inner city boys grow up with broken families that resulted from not having a stable home, generations of slaves was the beginning and the middle, but the late game has been constant villifying and dehumanizing/disrespecting of the entire neighborhood by it's surroundings. The kids may not have an adult to ask for help, maybe they were arrested by the cops for some BS reason. Without order, kids grow up tough and have to fend for themselves at the lowest rungs of human needs - safety. In desperation, nothing seems too far to gain respect, safety, and a sense of belonging. This is also understandable, people are surviving as best as they can .

There are also people who grew up in upper middle class. They know nothing of pain, struggles, they have been provided for their entire life. Their assumption of the worst thing possible is not having the next best thing. Their parents are too busy trying to keep up an image that has been so carefully cultivated, and for them the worst thing that can happen is being judged. Being human isn't innate, it's a choice. Judgment is all around, and they seem to fit in for the sake of fitting in and losing their identity. It's not noble, but it's understandable.

There are those who also dedicate themselves to a practice, be it religion or intellectual pursuits. These people tend to gravitate towards each other, and they may even learn of others, yet they do not fully understand what it means to feel the pains others feel. They have spent so long, so many years in the world of their studies that they ultimately end up in a different world as everyone else, everyone they talk to is from where they learned or studied. Interesting people.

I am generalizing, but I have seen all of these people and more. I personally have been a part of them, and yet never truly belonged in any. I will say, however, that I can confidently say that most people never worry or wonder how life can truly be different. Humans think they're unique, they are original, and that they are a product of themselves, but from my experience, it cannot be further from the truth. People are shaped by their culture more than they want to admit. We are what we are and hear. I am not surprised at seeing all of the issues we have in hate and division because how can we resolve issues when we can't even relate at a fundamental level to others on the other side of the country? There is a division so great, labels painted so thick that people do not see each other as humans but as ""it"". Lack of humanity is the source of all evil, and this is why we have issues.

I'm kind of ranting do my thoughts are messy. It's not impossible for people to relate to one another, but it is so difficult. How can you imagine something you haven't ever seen? On this note, Hollywood is the worst culprit imo. It makes people think they know an other group of people, yet it only shows a very shallow snapshot of labels, nothing more than skin deep, yet this is the most dangerous because it makes others believe they know all about that ""gangster black boy who probably deals drugs"",  ""that Asian boy who cares do much about family honor"", or ""that Indian man who probably gets drunk off of money from cansios"".

How can you fight for a better life when you don't even know of a different life due to your entire family being subjugated to sub-human standard of respect and quality of life for generations? Telling someone ""go and be free, you're equal to everyone else"" doesn't take into account mental health issues, lack of support group issues, no-self respect issues, lack of role model / strive for success model issues, etc. People will not really understand this, because why should they?

todayilearned,ff1heew,t1_ff11hiu,1579479261.0,"This makes sense to me. How can you fight for a better life when you don't even know of a different life due to your entire family being subjugated to sub-human standard of respect and quality of life for generations? Telling someone ""go and be free, you're equal to everyone else"" doesn't take into account mental health issues, lack of support group issues, no-self respect issues, lack of role model / strive for success model issues, etc. People will not really understand this, because why should they? It's not even like the depth of this concept is something that is brought up, nor is it seen as fondly in USA culture to discuss anything deeper than the weather."

Also, we know how the original version of the USA national anthem went because the tune was inspired by other popular songs of the time.
