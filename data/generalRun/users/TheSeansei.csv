BathBomb,ffpf6fy,t1_ffpepvn,1580093531.0,It took me many months to even try mica. I’m still in the testing/recipe-adjustment stages but I’m happy with the vibrant colour and how much better and stronger they are moulding.
BathBomb,ffpeggk,t3_euhely,1580093012.0,"I started off with food colouring when I was just making them as gifts. When I started selling, I began to use FDA-approved liquid dyes I got from Michael’s, but I have since switched to mica powders. I haven’t worked out the numbers yet to see if it’s sustainable, but since I’m not adding any water at all to the mixture now, I’m getting a MUCH better fizz out of the finished bath bomb. It’s not prematurely fizzing in the moulds or while it sits. I use 99% isopropyl alcohol in the mixture to make it mouldable and that all evaporates off in 24 hours. And of course, all of it is vegan. :)"
