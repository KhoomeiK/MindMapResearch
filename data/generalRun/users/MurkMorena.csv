Eyebleach,ff2yxsx,t1_ff2wb0u,1579529061.0,80% of what my dog tries to eat isn't food anyway. So I would say about 90% of what she tries to eat is bad lol
mildlyinteresting,fewjazp,t1_fevo05z,1579411745.0,It would have been cool to see this picture side by side with a regular picture of the clock. So that we can really see it backwards

college,fem4crk,t3_epvy9u,1579239335.0,"Your college should have their procedure specified in the student handbook somewhere. But they would most likely call your emergency contacts if you had to go to the hospital for alcohol related reasons, and those are most likely your parents.

I'm doubtful that they would call otherwise, even if you got arrested, since you're an adult and will be expected to take full responsibility for your actions."
college,fek10d8,t1_fejabs6,1579190294.0,"It's very difficult to lead a life where you avoid people to this extent. Even if you aren't concerned with making friends, you still need to connect with people for job references, get help with assignments, etc. It would be nice if we could truly survive in our society without having to rely on others like this, but it's just way too difficult."
college,fej5o59,t1_feiw739,1579157901.0,"I would like to second this, OP. I started going to counseling to combat my social anxiety, I behaved similarly to you, but even I think that he behaviors you're describing are excessive. You need to get to the bottom of what is causing you to avoid people, and address it. 

I think people who can't relate to these kinds of feelings are too quick to say things like ""join a club"" and ""just say hi to people."" Even though they all have the best intentions in mind, a counselor will give you better advice for your situation. Please see one."

college,fdfeha2,t3_ekzp2o,1578359795.0,"I would just focus on the fact that this is the last year. You get through this and you don't have to do it anymore. It will definitely suck for awhile, but a year from now you can relax knowing that you completed everything successfully."

Also just wanted to say good on you for taking everyone's advice into account and admitting that you might have made a mistake. A lot of people would have just doubled down."
wholesomememes,fcsqmtj,t1_fcspjom,1577922642.0,"You did make some changes to it, so maybe next time put something like ""Original by ____"" and ""Edit done by Aahil52""."

TrollXChromosomes,fc4ge79,t1_fc4ekh0,1577415894.0,"One of my kittens will run back and forth across me at 7 in the morning until I get up to feed him. It's the funniest thing. His roommate will just rub against my face. Sleep is impossible with them right now but hopefully that will change as they get older.

I will definitely miss these days though."
