buildapc,ffpqzpy,t1_ffep3hp,1580102626.0,"Thanks for you help, i found a nice 2070s deal so i went with that. Got the x570 but in the sense that i can use it for longer to upgrade in the future."
nvidia,ff8y2m7,t1_ff7ih2k,1579699773.0,Thanks! Think I made my mind up. Its my first build in a long time again. Gaming i used to do on a ps4 and used a macbook for more than a decade. Cos of video editing i wanted the 3900x but i think i'll go for the 3700x and use the money i save to go for nvidia instead of amd. Gut feeling just tells me cpu wise amd is great but gpu wise not yet.
nvidia,ff6easi,t3_erum1f,1579625324.0,I'm looking to upgrade and had my eye on the 5700xt nitro+ from Sapphire but post like these make me doubt it and wonder if I should go with EVGA 2070s instead

WinStupidPrizes,fcu8ijp,t1_fctevrh,1577975066.0,Sounds like a colleague of mine. Shaved his head for a $50 bet. Part of his top never grew back and he just ended up looking like a bald 50 year old while being in his twenties.
