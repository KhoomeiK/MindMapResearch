AskReddit,ffe7dzn,t3_esy81b,1579838689.0,"A Nintendo WiiU showed up on my front door atep when I was about 23. There was a loud knock on the front door, and as I got there, a man was driving away. I looked down, and there it was. For a moment I thought it was going to explode or something. It was addressed to an actress that lived near by me apparently, that had participated in a Nintendo booth at some event or some such. It was in a big Yoshi shopping bag, had mario kart 8 and a few other games, with a note that said ""dear Emilie, thanks for participating in [blah blah blah] and hanging out at our booth! Use this Twitter hashtag to let us know how you like it [and some other shit, I dont remember]""

So, i tried to do the right thing and contact said actress through her agent, and when I got no response, I called Nintendo and got as high up as I could through their CS and PR team. Girl I spoke to heard the story, was baffled, talked to her supervisor, and when she came back on the line said ""Well, I spoke, at length to my supervisor. We would never just drop a product off on someone's front door. We would ALWAYS use a certified delivery service like UPS or FedEx. Sooo, on behalf of Nintendo, enjoy your new WiiU!"" Those magic words rang in my ear for months. In a house full of gamers, and avid Nintendo fans, it was the BEST thing that could've happened. 1 in a million kind of happy accident."

I know for a fact that people have said much, MUCH worse on the reddits, and they feel no remorse and even defend their thoughts. Just take a look at the AITA sub. It's full of idiots that think they're justified in their actions (and some who are justified, but I digress). Leaving would only undo all the work you've done defending the underdogs of our chat. Undo all the work you've done banning the gross dudes that hit on the girls and DM them gross shit. I, for one, say you don't leave. But that's just me. Take a day or two, or more if you need it and take a breather. Reddit can drive a foo NUTS if you spend to much time or invest too emotionally in it. Don't leave, just don't invest so much of yourself emotionally. It makes it harder. I say that you apologized enough. You can always be sorry, that's good. It shows remorse for what you did. No need to shun yourself."

I'm glad your parents weren't abusive in that right though, it's not the same for a lot of kids I'm sure. Especially those poor pageant kids.
