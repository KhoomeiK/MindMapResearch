loseit,ffc3ver,t3_eseley,1579790892.0,"As @toxik0n said, be careful with keto. I read your responses and it sounds like a good plan! I did keto for 6 months and had to transition off due to hormone issues that may or may not have been related. (This was menstrual issues, so you wouldn't have to worry about that unless you are trans or non-binary.)

I loved keto because it kept my cravings in control. I am much better following a diet of hard lines; if I know I cannot eat something, it becomes easier to avoid it. If I get a small bite of a sweet dessert, that goes to eating the whole thing. You said you have a way to transition off of it, so I applaud you. Just be warned: you still need to count calories on keto. I didn't count and it was great for a month, I lost 15 lbs. But then I got discouraged because I didn't lose any more. I realize after the fact that even in ketosis, you still can't lose weight if you are eating over your TDEE. So maybe for the first month or so, just get used to the diet. Then if you see a stall, count your calories. You can eat all the bacon in the world, but if you eat 5000 calories over your TDEE, you will not lose weight.

That being said, congrats on the changes and keep up the good work! Your family will be so proud of you and so will you!"
fatlogic,ff7171p,t3_ervuu1,1579639079.0,"Rant: **TMI WARNING** My birth control has seriously fucked with my hormones and I believe I am suffering from iron deficiency. But this only happens every few months or so. I have in the last month started taking an iron supplement. But the last two days I have been so sick and I think I'm lacking iron again. Because of being sick, I've had to skip work and workouts, and I'm mad.

Rant 2: I've stalled on my weight loss and as much as it might have to do with the above mentioned, I also have to come to terms with the fact that I am probably eating too much. 

Rave: Working out with my friend over the weekend, I can definitely tell I'm gaining muscle and I'm so excited about that!"

fatlogic,fe2r0dh,t1_fe2a4rp,1578841927.0,"Yup. In terms of a bra (I tried bra terms so it would be more clear), my band size went down and my cup size went up. Measured my chest and that would stay the same."
fatlogic,fe1zvcd,t1_fe01djq,1578832884.0,"I have gone up and down in weight and even at my lowest after I lost 15lbs in high school, my chest size never moved. Only the band size. I'm still considering surgery once I lose the weight again."

My doctor always said to exercise but it really hit me when I worked out with a friend for the first time in ages and I felt better during and after. Congrats and keep it up!"
loseit,fdr9l6b,t3_emqm32,1578681397.0,"I'm still in the process of losing and haven't lost much at all (~10lbs). The only way I see it is when I wear clothes that I couldn't a few lbs ago. But I really wanted to say, you are super inspiring. You are only a few inches taller than me, and your starting weight is where I am now. To think that in just a year you went from 174 to 139 is giving me such hope. Congrats to you!!"

loseit,fdkjr3k,t1_fdkc1sd,1578505123.0,That's a fantastic idea! Good for your office! Having a water and a fidget toy has helped me so much in that it takes my mind off of food and keeps me more focused.

fatlogic,fdkhmpn,t1_fdkgjhs,1578504054.0,"So I game a lot and I get this problem too. Have a drink nearby at all times (water, preferably. If you need flavor, add some Mio.) If you sit but aren't using your hands, try using a fidget toy as a means to distract yourself. And if you do want to snack, make it something low calorie and make a portion of it before you sit down. Eg, if you want chips, portion them out before you sit down and don't bring the bag to you. Munch on them slowly. I like pickles, they are low calorie and very crunchy. Also sunflower seeds have given me something to chew on with taste and it takes me a while to eat a little. And coffee (if you like it) can stave off hunger!"
loseit,fdgzxhk,t1_fdgdvj0,1578412340.0,"I get the unmotivated part. My neuro-atypical brain doesn't do anything I don't want to do. So I had to cheat the system and figure out a way that worked for me. 

For you, if you think posting pics or sharing pics with people who will keep you accountable (or both), do that! I started thinking my body was disgusting. But I took some progress pics and saved them to a  personal drive. It showed me that, yes, I needed help. But it also gave me hope in that, yes, this is your body and only you can change it. It gave me that sense of control. Now that I have taken progress pics, it gives me motivation to keep going. 

Another important thing for me was rewiring my brain to not think of it as a diet. I am forming healthy habits. Do I eat ice cream? Hell yes. Do I sit and binge watch Netflix occasionally? Also yes. But I do everything in moderation. I make my portion sizes before I sit down and before I go to work. If there is a goody at work I want, I'll break off a bite or two and eat that and be satisfied.

Lastly (I'm so sorry I wrote an essay) I read somewhere that motivation is fleeting, but self-disciple is what sticks with us. I wouldn't rely on motivation. Just do small changes each day and learn to stick with that. Then once you have that down, do another change. Make it sustainable. If you go too hard all at once, you'll burn out. 

You can do it!! I believe!"
loseit,fdgyprt,t3_elcopp,1578411567.0,"A few questions for you. Did you weigh yourself before or after the workout? What time of day did you weigh in? After workout weigh-in would be higher than before your workout due to water weight. And if you've eaten that day, you need to factor that in as well. 

Assuming everything is normal (health-wise, since you've seen a doctor already, but please do work with your doctor as they are the experts), how much do you exercise on a normal day? It looks like you swim most days, do weight training many days, and also do cardio. If you are only eating 1350 kcals/day but exercising for more than an hour every single day, are you sure you aren't under-eating? I am by no means an expert, so take this with a grain of salt. Maybe up the kcals for a week or two and see how everything looks then. 

Lastly, what are your macros? I was a vegetarian for about 2 years and I had severe issues with getting enough protein in my diet."

TrollXChromosomes,fd39tsw,t3_ejsqxa,1578156138.0,My fiance and I went to Costco a few months back and he went to go grab the kitty litter (it was taller than I could reach... Short people problems). A nice older lady came up to me and asked if she could borrow him for a moment when he was done so he could get some dog food loaded up in her cart. I told her not a problem and did it myself. She smiled and thanked me and walked away and I swear I've never felt more like a badass.
