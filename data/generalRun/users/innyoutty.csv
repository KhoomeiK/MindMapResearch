Megadrive,ffdqtsj,t1_ffckoud,1579826712.0,Does the sonic 3 repro cart have a functioning save feature?
Megadrive,ff2m2hw,t3_er81um,1579512641.0,"That looks like it does absolutely nothing at all. Is there any damage on the other side?
Edit: it looks like the power port has been repaired. The solder cracks there all the time but all you need to do is re-flow it. I guess adding those wires could make it slightly more resistant to breaking again..."
PS4,feku8tn,t1_fekrgq3,1579207714.0,Yeah but you missed out on so many exclusives.
ElectricalEngineering,fej8hl8,t3_epe8wu,1579161436.0,The real danger would be the ring getting hot as fuck and burning you.
triplej,feg6l17,t1_feg5ykk,1579079376.0,Just scraped in to enough people's top 10? I have no idea.
DnB,fed06lv,t3_eoe3px,1578992106.0,I always thought bullet but now I'm looking closer it looks more like a broken off leg off a cabinet
PlaystationClassic,fec5u91,t1_fec1g21,1578967120.0,Modded 2018 device which is a re-release of a 1995(ish) device no less.
PlaystationClassic,fe6as97,t3_enwtvh,1578885685.0,Maybe you do need another cable but you definitely don't need to waste your money on a monster cable.
IAmA,fdve5jn,t1_fdv8p2n,1578746472.0,"I guess they could be calling him these names as an ""alternate Buddah"", even though they know that he is in fact Budai. Kind of as a joke which only works with local knowledge. Or maybe there is some other kind of mistake going on."
todayilearned,fdunasi,t1_fdte617,1578735708.0,I've been premium for like 5 years and I didn't get shit
Android,fdlnx0f,t1_fdl8y9s,1578528319.0,Bypassing a hotel paid tv service so I could plug my hard drive with my own movies made it a winner for me.

qBittorrent,fdb7s4s,t3_eka0j1,1578254742.0,"I've always just clicked file > exit when I want it to quit, i think it closes properly. I always thought it was intentional that the program doesn't completely close when you close the window."
ElectricalEngineering,fdb3px7,t1_fd8zqo1,1578253368.0,"But that's why the information was corrected by u/meevilbob. We were given a false lead and they corrected it, now we know the truth. Also, the link title doesn't necessarily make it correct either. Plenty of badly named links about."
ElectricalEngineering,fd8qp1p,t1_fd8ppsr,1578221975.0,"Using a mobile app doesn't give a link unless you dig for it. It would have made a lot more sense to just link a picture relating to the title of the post, not something that could easily be mistaken for it."
Android,fd1u3ht,t1_fcz9ln3,1578136836.0,"Yeah my A8 2018 has it too. Bit reluctant to get a phone without it now, it's saved me a few times."
PS4,fczenft,t3_ehj8ir,1578099491.0,Hey mate I iuitw
offbeat,fctkfi7,t1_fct5dyz,1577946478.0,Like sleeve of wizard.
punk,fct1ugz,t1_fcrs454,1577930694.0,"Yeah they get paid just enough above what they would get outside the force and they know it, so they don't wanna rock the boat."
IAmA,fcs492p,t1_fcqg76e,1577911246.0,Now I finally know why our car radio from like 20 years ago had a dx button that made the fuzz go away when you're out of town.
todayilearned,fcrtsoa,t1_fcq4uh4,1577906521.0,It's still mostly air so the energy absorption will be roughly the same as air without smoke.
todayilearned,fcpxxpm,t1_fcpuqav,1577874547.0,Because reds wavelength is longer it is also weaker (less energy) and can't penetrate the water as easily.
vinyl,fcmoj4h,t1_fcmm03d,1577784404.0,Here I am listening to music on a soundbar while my stereo is packed away. Family life man...
vinyl,fcmkkvj,t1_fckzdoe,1577779130.0,We had great stereos but shitty TV's. Now we have great TV's but shitty stereos.
ps3hacks,fcl4lp2,t1_fckuuqi,1577739690.0,"Feeler guages are a set of thin steel wafers at different thicknesses designed for setting tolerances in engine building and stuff like that. You can get them pretty cheap. Google them, they're right up the top."
xbox360,fcjobg4,t1_fcjml39,1577696404.0,"Oh ok but the issue still lies in the cpu and gpu die being so close together and essentially heating each other which makes them a little less reliable than a jasper, right?"
Games,fcjo7zu,t1_fcixbve,1577696267.0,"It's the publishers who are selling out their customers, not Epic. Some may say that some of the onus is on Epic for allowing it to happen and not giving a shit, but mostly the publishers are at fault in these cases."
xbox360,fcj6bzr,t3_ehdol9,1577678356.0,"Build quality, Jasper's had the updated gpu and cpu which use less power and therefore create less heat. The slims had the same cpu and gpu but put them on the same package so they're a bit harder to cool because they are so close to each other."
ps3hacks,fc3mkwr,t1_fc3cnvm,1577393295.0,I successfully used a set of feeler guages and a bit of heat. Tried fishing line but it wasn't working out for me.
PS4,fc00wjt,t1_fbzz32m,1577272674.0,"Yeah it was basically the smallest tv I could get with half decent quality, the small TV market is mostly just cheap trash now. We just didn't want a giant screen in our living area. We're building a family lounge soon and that will probably have something over 60 inch though."
PS4,fbzx1tk,t1_fbxwxlj,1577266285.0,"As somebody who prefers a small (43 inch) TV in my living room, small text is my first world problem."
ElectricalEngineering,fbzqkhh,t3_efcg17,1577256555.0,"You probably need a voltage sensitive relay (VSR) to isolate your backup battery from the starter battery, preventing your accessories from discharging your starter battery. When your engine is running it will automatically connect the backup battery and charge it. As for the radio, you could just run it off your backup battery and it should be fine. VSR's are a pretty common automotive item you can find easily."
triplej,fbmuhgd,t3_ednwyh,1576989020.0,"Yeah slab of water, get some and cut the whole top off lid and all. Use boiling water to melt the bottle thread away and you're left with a cap with the seal still intact. Fill with vodka and enjoy. Don't do what we did and bring too much vodka and not enough water tho, we were cleaning the mud off ourselves with vodka in the end."
