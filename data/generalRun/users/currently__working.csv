If you feel these things, and they are significant to you, then the effect is in YOU. You have to take control of your own mind and be responsible for the 'state' of the world in your own perception of it. You have to be at once present in the world to witness it, but simultaneously detached from it in order to not be reliant on it - which you are, if you everything you see affects you in this way.

But I'm not a professional anything, so take what I say with a grain of salt, because hey I'm a fucking moron probably, I'm just some random redditor, I don't have the answers.

I totally agree with you the world right now is in chaos, politically and economically, etc. But this is not really the point I was hearing from the OP's post, nor what was what I was referring to. I was saying there was no ""quantum event"" which seems to have done something \*\*because of\*\* someone woke up on the ""wrong side of the bed"" one day (yes I'm oversimplifying but you get what I mean). More like, maybe, the shitshow the world is in has an effect on our mental states and we're all a little depressed and anxious these days, and that's the norm. If you call that the shift, then okay but I don't think that's what the OP meant nor what was I referring to.
