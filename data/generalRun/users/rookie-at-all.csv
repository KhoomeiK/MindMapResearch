EDAnonymous,ff1pykj,t3_er0zx8,1579483590.0,Bartenders' books say that diet cola is better with rum. I mean THEY ARE THE PROFESSIONALS. :)
fatlogic,fevww01,t1_feve3ib,1579402483.0,"I am sitting in the waiting room at the tire store. Could the chick sitting next to me truly be this fragile? This kind of shit makes me look around and wonder about the humans around me. if a sneaker makes someone curl into the fetal position and scream in a corner I'm convinced that we are doomed as a species. Buck up buckaroo. Wait till you hear about STAIRS This is so hyperbolic and ridiculous. She sounds like a complete nut job

EDAnonymous,fecb96k,t1_fe923pz,1578970028.0,I wish I could give you a hug if u want it but cant but I honestly wish the best for you and am sending all the good vibes I can through this keyboard.
EDAnonymous,fec9pes,t1_feay8mv,1578969157.0,"I think they are every bit as disordered as we are tbh. I'm 53 and when I was growing up the average person was ""normal"" bmi. I wanted to be SMALLER than normal. Not to sound like a relic , but all this really ducks with my head. I can't imagine being a young me and dealing with all this. Ya'll are brave and strong and I'm rooting for you. If anyone needs a relatively messed up but loving ed mom feel free. I'm low but normal bmi. Have a healthy relationship with my adult daughters and husband and I will absolutely kick the fucking assof anyone who messes with someone I care about. And I worry about and care about all of you.
(Well that was weird. But wtf I haven't eaten in 2 days so grain of salt, etc)"
EDAnonymous,fea4l1z,t1_fe5uuch,1578944315.0,that is freaking hilarious.
fatlogic,fdzi8ve,t3_enfb82,1578790478.0,So you have more than two kids who need to change into bathing suits. Dressing little kids into swimsuits is like gift-wrapping jello. They offer you a contained space to wrestle the kids into swimwear that's private and enclosed.  That sounds like HEAVEN to me. I have 3 granddaughters under 5. I would have wanted to hug the staffer. JFC GROW THE HELL UP
fatlogic,fdz1vev,t1_fdz1jjp,1578785825.0,Kickass. Stupid auto-correct; I wanna cuss.
fatlogic,fdz1jjp,t1_fdxhh8w,1578785766.0,"I have a pair of KICKS leather pants from 30 years ago. They are a Gap brand size six. I finally got my formally fat ass back into them. They are TIGHT. I now wear a zero in gap jeans. I am not a size zero. I have a 22.5 bmi.
Shit be stupid. :)"
fatlogic,fdmz123,t1_fdmpsgu,1578571957.0,Bingo. It's really different.  I would really like to see data on percent of meals eaten outside of the home.
fatlogic,fdii2n0,t3_elcpmx,1578443398.0,"I had a revelation about a year ago that I wanted to feel attractive again. I sound conceited but I had always been considered  a pretty girl. Genetic Lottery, whatever (makes me no better than anyone else) but I turned 50 and felt like I was becoming invisible and I hated it. Alot. I decided to count calories and exercise to lose weight   For COMPLETELY reasons of vanity. . It worked,  I lost 35 lbs and I'm not invisible anymore. Life is easier.  I didn't do it for health or longevity,  I just wanted to be more attractive. It's the self you present to the world.   Eat and work out for the body you want and enjoy the fruitsof your labor. It's one of the few things you can do for free that increases your social capital and gives you an honest sense of accomplishment. Take the bait. Cave into society""s pressure.  If you don't want to maintain you don't have to. Do it BECAUSE  IT'S A CHALLENGE & YOU CAN.
THANK YOU FOR COMING TO MY TED TALK."
fatlogic,fcz0tc8,t3_ejil8p,1578091382.0,"Or maybe it was the mountains of coke?
(Just spit-balling here.)"
fatlogic,fcvsj0v,t1_fcujvu0,1578009125.0,"The point is that people have different eating habits. I'm smack dab where I want to be and have 2 snacks and three meals a day. Argue about the relative worth of an eating plan all you want , but you can't make blanket statements about the intelligence of snacking/not for everyone."
EDAnonymous,fcbce41,t3_egzn0b,1577585149.0,"I am so very sorry that you feel this way. I wish I could give you a hug (if you wanted it)
I for one think that you are worthy of health and strong enough to fight for your life. I believe in you"
fatlogic,fb2zazf,t1_fb1y5jl,1576460613.0,"I agree SO MUCH with what you posted. I eat for the body I want. I try not to over or under feed it, I am vain and want to look a certain way. It's my vessel that I present to the world. It's important to me INSIDE. I don't care enough about some ""social issue"" enough to not put my physical health at risk.
So THERE........?"
