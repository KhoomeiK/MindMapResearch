They say they had to work hard to love themselves, something which comes naturally to most well-adjusted people.

fatlogic,ff8hqu3,t3_es061w,1579679036.0,"Genetics does play a role in obesity, but not exactly the way the FAs think.  Genes can influence your appetite, extent of cravings, fat distribution in your body and even propensity to use food as a coping mechanism.  Environmental influences worsen this situation (eg. having a bigger appetite and having plentiful calorie dense food available at all times).

That being said, calories-in-calories-out still holds true irrespective of the genes.  Just because you may be genetically pre-disposed in some way to have a higher likelihood of being obese, it does not mean you cannot control over your weight through a proper diet and exercise if you'd like to do so.  It may, however, be more difficult than it is for some but still that's not a valid reason to say that you were meant to be fat and are healthier if so."

fatlogic,fedie2t,t1_fedfsco,1579012310.0,"> We shouldn't have to worry about calories. I'm all in favor of people losing weight without ever even being aware of what a calorie is and how to track them, as long as they can stick to their new diet.

I think we are saying the same thing, but are both being pedantic about it.  To me, what you are saying sounds a bit like that rubbish 'intuitive eating', which in the cases you have mentioned seems to have worked by chance.  Personally, I think we should worry about calories.  Well, not worry maybe but be mindful of how many we consume to avoid excesses.  Self-restriction without counting may work for some, but I would still continue to advise anyone who is serious about losing weight to use the tools at their disposal, including calorie counting apps, and not go by their intuition which can be very erroneous.  What specific diet they follow is up to them based on whatever they are able to stick to.

That being said, I have never been overweight in my life and I never counted calories till recently in order to drop a few kilograms.  I am also not ashamed to say that I started doing so for aesthetic and health reasons (now that I am over 40 years of age and also started putting a bit of flab around my stomach area)."
fatlogic,fedfmq1,t1_fedeefu,1579010214.0,"Still misleading, IMHO, because if you have 'as many meals that include it as you want' you probably will end up overeating beyond your TDEE.  But it's a good psychological ploy, not only to drum up business, but also to actually help people get over their apprehensions about dieting (viz. having to give up food they like or consume daily.)

I don't know how well a lop-sided macro composition of meals works health-wise in the long term though.  Maybe it's fine, because people I know seem to be doing fine on keto at least.  I tend to favor a more balanced diet approach with lesser quantities of everything."
fatlogic,fedcc29,t1_fed8c0l,1579007422.0,"> There's plenty of people who switch to these diets and don't moderate how much they consume and still lose weight. 

This can be tricky.  In my experience, including my own, people tend to underestimate the calories they consume and / or overestimate what they burn through exercise.  It is of course possible, once you get the hang of it, to guesstimate the amount of food you need to consume to be at deficit or maintenance without actually tracking precisely.  But with so many apps and information available to track calories and nutrients properly, most people would benefit from a more accurate count.

But I agree with you that people should follow whatever technique works for them.  If certain types of food, say proteins, make people feel fuller and help them eat at deficit or maintenance then they should stick with it."

fatlogic,fed0yjq,t1_fecq3d1,1578993190.0,"Keto seems a bit extreme to me as well, but I know several people who have been following it successfully for a while now.  So it does work for many, though I wouldn't be able to do it myself.  In the end, it's about self-control and extent of perseverance, which differs from person to person as we know.

I am a big CICO proponent myself, without following any particular 'big name' diets, because I feel it lets me eat what I want as long as I exercise some moderation, which makes it a sustainable approach for me.  I started off without paying any attention to the constituent macros, just staying within the deficit limits, and then later as I started seeing results modified my diet over time to try and get the target macro composition right. Seems to be working well.

Edit:  Happy Cake Day!"
fatlogic,fectjpz,t3_eogue0,1578984050.0,"Well, none of these will put you in a calorific deficit unless you moderate the amount you consume.

Over here (India) obesity is becoming prevalent in urban areas , even amongst children unfortunately.  Being overweight but not obese is very common though and along with that an increase in lifestyle diseases such as diabetes and cardio-vascular problems.  I am also seeing a trend where overweight / obese people are starting to say the sort of fat logic things I see here, but it's not yet prevalent thankfully.
