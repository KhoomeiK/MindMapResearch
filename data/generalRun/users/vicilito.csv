depression,fenm3t6,t3_eq4lka,1579287614.0,"Be there and let him know you care, cuz I've found that if it's bad you just feel like no one cares about you (even if it's not logical at all) so just show him you care and if he jokes or talked about being a bad person such as say you're discussing some class and he's like""I'm really bad at this or I'm just stupid"" or things like that tell him no you're not or such, cuz I've found that's sort of gets the ball rolling if u know what I mean (sorry for the ramble)

TLDR; let him know u care"
