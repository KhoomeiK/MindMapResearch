todayilearned,fgtfm68,t1_fgsjysq,1581103829.0,"When I had my son I was pretty shocked at how often people would causally advise me to give him some sort of hard liquor for things like teething and fussiness. I was young when I had him, so a lot of them felt the need to berate me for being so stupid for making him suffer without whiskey. I usually couldn't even find the words to argue I was so floored, I didn't even know half these people."

Eyebleach,fgsvsqg,t1_fgso7ho,1581093688.0,Your pup is adorable!! Tell her I said she's a very good girl and please give her all of the pets and a smooch on the cheek
todayilearned,fgmqicy,t1_fgmmofi,1580929997.0,Yeah but the trial should never have happened without him present. I'm not gonna pretend to know how their systems work or operate but it seems basically all this did was ensure he never voluntarily went to France.
todayilearned,fgmm3d6,t1_fgmb1kt,1580927364.0,I know he didn't serve any time but that's bullshit considering his daughter's killer only got a 2yr suspended sentence and lost his license to practice after being found guilty of rape and murder.
suspiciouslyspecific,fgmjkmi,t1_fgmfn5w,1580925874.0,"Dude...EVERYTHING was covered in that fucking syrup!!  Side story: I used to save all the singles I couldn't cash out at work and every few days take them to the bank. After about 2 months, I walked in to do my thing, but I was rushing and had my cash in my server book this time. The teller was ridiculously, obviously relieved when they realized the sticky stuff on all my singles was pancake syrup..they thought I was a stripper. Apparently it was something they'd been discussing so it was a lil awkward when I realized they thought I was handing them cum soaked singles...at 9am in a packed bank..good times lol."
aww,fgmivg1,t1_fgmepmo,1580925466.0,I wonder if they ever found the sea lion and what they planned on doing with it. They mention in the article the 4 who stole the lil guy were harassing both of them and the one got away. I hope his lil buddy was ok but it doesn't seem likely.
TrueCrime,fgmgug9,t1_fglyyus,1580924277.0,"Having been locked up myself, I know what you mean. You come to understand that most people don't have support, money, education, etc and were just doing their best at the time, and even when they make bad decisions, that doesn't erase the good they've done either. It doesn't really help that so many good people have to do ""bad"" things to survive and the rehabilitation offered after prison or jail is usually a joke.

  What really kills me tho is so many people I met there just really needed some kind of mental health assistance, they barely get help in jail after waiting weeks, and then are released with no mental health plan that's actually doable. Without your mind you can't accomplish much and a lot of it falls apart from there. People self-medicate for serious stuff, not to just get high and I think that's a huge part of the misunderstanding that is failing people.  To me, that was the scariest part, not the murders, that the people who needed help the most would be left to basically break down and blow in the wind until they get picked up again. Helping people would eventually be most cost effective than just jailing them but prison is big business.

I'm starting to ramble too, but I'm glad you're free, helping other people understand, and that you get to eat whatever the hell you want!!"
suspiciouslyspecific,fgmelel,t1_fgmdiqc,1580923003.0,"I think it was just at locations owned by our bosses (they're a married couple), they had 3 restaurants. They both worked there before buying their own franchise, he was a cook and she was a server, so they know how bad the stress gets. 

We would literally get so pissed we'd quit, go beat the hell out of the punching bag, tape up while smoking a cig, just in time for our manager to come out and say "" you know you're not leaving, finish your cig and close out your tables"". We were all real close but it was prob just trauma bonding lol"

suspiciouslyspecific,fgmc4ps,t3_ez8wfi,1580921751.0,"Oh man..I was at a dive bar in Philly on 10 cent wing night. For like 15mins me and this other chick are waiting for this older lady to come out of the bathroom. We both really had to go so it was like torture, there was only 1 stall. Then we hear the flush and she comes running out of the bathroom and straight out the front door. What she left behind, I don't even have words to name it, went straight up the wall stopping about 2ft from the ceiling. Totally disgusting but I'd be lying if I said I wasn't a lil impressed, I had no idea until then the power of explosive diarrhea."
suspiciouslyspecific,fgmb75x,t3_eyzcdu,1580921285.0,"You look like you'd be a night manager at IHOP. I mean that in the best way, IHOP was one of my fave places to work when I was younger. It was also the only restaurant I've ever worked in that had a full size punching bag in the basement. Def great stress relief during the sunday church crowd and the midnight boardwalk rush."

jenniferkesse,fgl1qbx,t1_fgd37f3,1580879319.0,"I used to live in a gated community kind of like her's but a little further south. My boyfriend's car was broken into 3xs and stolen twice. No one saw anything, the stuff stolen was gone but both times the car was recovered. The people living there hardly know each other, the complexes can be huge, so no one knows who belongs and who doesn't. You could be a criminal or you could live on the other end and just be up my way to stop at the office or grab mail.

The few years I lived in Orlando, we would hear gunshots literally all night, from all different directions. No cops ever came. We weren't even in a ""bad"" neighborhood.  There's a decent amount of corruption and seriously questionable activity on behalf of law enforcement. There's a huge homeless population, drug addicts/rehabs/halfway houses everywhere, human trafficking is a big problem and idk why but there's a whole bunch of sex offenders that specifically move to Orlando. I remember about a month after I moved there seeing in the news that the local sherriff basically said ""buy a gun, train and use it safely because we prob won't arrive until it's already a crime scene"" since home invasions were so frequent. 

I don't mean to make it sound all bad but the place can be really unnerving or like the wild west on it's bad days."
TrueCrime,fg7v0p8,t1_fg7j3qe,1580602147.0,"Something tells me this dude does not have enough honey bun and cup o noodles money to not get beat all the time. Idk what it is about his pic but he just looks like the kinda dude that stays running his mouth and that doesn't really go over well either. Plus you can pay all you want for protection, if the CO's don't like you, it's open season."
PedoGate,fg7527v,t3_ex9ko3,1580584181.0,"They need to keep this on his record and ensure this man seeks psychological help. In no way, shape, or form should he be excused from violating this family's home and safety just because he spent time in the military and with the marshalls. In the article it states he was unsupervised at work, and in court ""he seemed remorseful"" yet his girlfriend reported he destroyed his computer. That sounds more like hiding evidence. I just hope he doesn't hurt anyone else but usually when they get away with this stuff, they do it again only worse."
TrueCrime,fg6lavm,t1_fg57ud4,1580570962.0,"That man was probably hoping for death considering what other inmates do to chomos in prison..his life is gonna be full of beatings and rape now, only he'll be on the receiving end this time."
MadeMeCry,ffipt2z,t3_erv8qj,1579979704.0,"What a beautiful picture of a beautiful cat!! I'm so very sorry for the loss of your special buddy. From the pic, your cat looks like it had a lot of character. I hope you guys made a lot of sweet memories together and that your heart heals up so that when you remember them, it's with a smile, not teary eyes."
suggestmeabook,fehr571,t1_fehn4f8,1579122224.0,Me too!! I've prob read it a good 8xs and I've lost a few copies bc I lend them out but I'm always recommending it lol. I've been meaning to read Survivor for a while now. Most people have told me if I liked Invisible Monsters and Choke that I'd love it. Hope this reminds me to finally get on that!!
suggestmeabook,fegxm64,t1_fegk10h,1579104801.0,"Try Invisible Monsters or Choke by Chuck Palahniuk..it's close enough to Gaiman's style while also being completely unique. They both make you truly believe in things you know would never happen. Palahniuk is a little more crass but his stories are hard to pin down when explaining. He doesn't follow a linear timeline, but jumps around. Some people find it hard to follow but if that doesn't bother you, give it a try. Like Gaiman, he weaves complicated and impossible worlds that draw you in till the last page."

nextfuckinglevel,fedrgdc,t3_eoccoz,1579018297.0,"Man, I don't even know you guys but I'm proud as hell for you both!! My sister and BIL just accomplished something similar and it's so amazing to see how much more active and happier they are, it makes my heart cheese smile. Alot of people talked shit and my sister lost a few ""good"" friends because she was no longer the ""fat friend"" but I add those assholes to the weight they lost. It's def a pro, not a con!! But I also hope neither of you had to deal with that type of petty, shallowness.

This is a huge deal and I hope you guys stay healthy  and keep setting goals in life and killin em!!"

AskReddit,fedhnyt,t1_fedh887,1579011774.0,"Yeah but that's normal as far as Ive heard anyway..But these are hard, right? Idk, I don't wanna be a douche but I wouldn't know how to even handle something like that without some input from the person it's attached to. Oral I can figure out but I'd be afraid to touch it and be overly rough n wind up ruining the mood..i guess bc it's so small I'd figure it might be more delicate. Again, not tryna be a dick, just honesty asking out of ignorance on the subject."
AskReddit,fedh0h7,t1_fedg5wf,1579011287.0,I thought this would answer some of my questions (and I really do appreciate the sub link) but now I have so many more questions after seeing a dick that basically looked like an outie bellybutton/butthole above a nutsack.

For someone who had so much pull in the film industry, you'd think enough of that movie magic would have rubbed off that he'd know how to make this look more realistic. Thankfully, he still believes he's in a position to ""blind"" people with money and no one's buying this bullshit."
