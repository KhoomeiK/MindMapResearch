So too much sugar can make you fat because of the calories is true not to much sugar makes you fat because of special sugar cooties.   

-There is debate around if sugar is addictive.  Even if you lean towards yes it is not at the level of smoking, booze or heroin.

-The LD-50 of sugar is 29,700.  Yeah, its not a poison or toxic in any meaningful way.  If someone is trying to say Sugar is poison/toxic is a different way well they are wrong and trying to intentionally confuse you.

-Sugar does not cause T2D.  Once you have T2D you have to watch your sugar intake but it is not the cause of it. 

-This is true but I am willing to give a bit of slack here to those that say bad.  As many ultra-processed foods use sugar (along with Fat) to basically manipulate the taste and design it so you consume more.  

Sugar consumption is down since 2000.  This is all forms of sugar so includes everything from ebil HFCS to natural so super duper good for you (/s) honey.
