adderall,ffag103,t1_f7waboh,1579734888.0,"No offense intended, because the withdrawal you had still sounds like hell, but you’re honestly lucky it went like that. I binged for a week and had a single day of withdrawal, and in that one day came closer to killing myself than I ever have.

Maybe you had that after you quit everything, I might not know the whole story. And even if not, withdrawals are hell no matter what, hopefully you don’t take offense to this because I’m not trying to belittle your experience or anything lol."
adderall,ffafrd4,t1_f7joh59,1579734705.0,"I binged for a week (2 days studying dose adderall, 3 days high dose vyvanse and one day high dose Ritalin, spread out over a week if I’m remembering correctly) and while the withdrawals didn’t last a super long time the night after the day that I stopped I couldn’t sleep, and felt ridiculously depressed and suicidal. I already have depression, but that night and part of the next day I have never felt so bad. I had made plans for suicide before, but it was never a real plan, more of a what if. That night I made a very specific plan for how I’d kill myself, and I was 100% decided that I would do it, I planned out my notes in my head, what I’d say to everyone first, I had the end of my life literally planned down more meticulously than anything I’ve ever planned in my life. 

Then the next day I was back to normal. And that was only one week, and when I think back on it it’s one of, if not the scariest moment of my life. And it wasn’t just wanting to kill my self to get rid of the withdrawal, the withdrawal caused a depression that felt so real, it utterly convinced me that I had no future and if I didn’t kill myself nothing would get better. If it had lasted even a few days I honestly don’t know if I would be alive. 

And let me stress, I’m in a good place now but still struggle with depression, and in the past I’ve had times where I felt hopeless and seriously considered suicide. The depression caused by the withdrawal felt just as real as every other time, but so much worse. I can’t stress enough how bad it was, after only one week. I don’t think that these are unsafe drugs if they’re used correctly, but these are something I’ll never binge on again. I’m still using, but I’m keeping it infrequent, my plan is once a week at the maximum, probably less. Aside from the addiction potential, insane weight loss (I lost twelve pounds that week), and physical effects, there isn’t any worse feeling I’ve ever had than withdrawal, and mine was only for a single week, my first time doing them.

I can’t imagine what that would be like after months of abuse, especially if that was a repeating pattern, but to be fair withdrawal symptoms are different for everyone, I know not everyone gets them as bad as this, and it’s possible (if super rare) for some people to be able to binge with no withdrawals ever. But something like that scares me."
adderall,ffaem0a,t3_eoyc52,1579733852.0,"I lost ten pounds in a week on a binge once, but on the doses prescribed to you it shouldn’t be too hard to regulate your eating and exercise and not gain or lose too much. A bit is expected, but too much and I would recommend going back to your doctor and getting a lower dose, or breaking up your pills and taking less if you’re able to."
adderall,ffaeglp,t1_ff0erzj,1579733732.0,I wouldn’t say always. I got Ritalin (not a prescription to be fair) and took 120 and 215 mg my first two times and didn’t get a euphoric high.

Edit: One more thing to add, when inhaled directly from a canister the gas can cause frostbite to your lips or problems in the lungs from how cold it is. However, when blown from the can into a balloon then inhaled that risk is alleviated."
