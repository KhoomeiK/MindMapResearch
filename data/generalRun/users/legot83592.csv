NAIT,ffniz8g,t1_ffkvy1q,1580066537.0,Not necessarily but if you did go and choose classes at a later date you wouldn't have the option to have a good schedule. (IE you could have 4 hour classes at night or have a class on saturday.)
NAIT,ffjyx9k,t3_etmqe8,1580010789.0,Yeah the enrollment isn't open yet for the fall. You should get an email saying when the enrollment opens. But it should be somewhere in the first week of July. Make sure to enroll in classes the first day it's open as classes do fill up quickly.

To be honest I've lived and worked in Alberta my whole life and once I finish getting my business degree in 2 years I'll be leaving the ""republic of alberta"" since that's what the UCP thinks Alberta is."

college,fe6003g,t3_envjls,1578878725.0,I agree with OP I had to spend 100 dollars on a access code for stats. While the textbook/code bundle is 125. Luckily I got the textbook from a friend.

Cooking,fdhfnj1,t1_fdd62n4,1578421646.0,But usually with risotto you put cheese and that's what usually hold the arancini together. At least that's how it's done traditionally. Then of course you do an egg wash for the breading.
Cooking,fdeiwlc,t1_fdd6e3f,1578339989.0,"Ingredients

2 lb. russet potatoes (about 4 medium), scrubbed

6-3/4 oz. (1-1/2 cups) unbleached all-purpose flour, more for kneading and rolling

1 tsp. kosher salt

1 large egg, lightly beaten

Nutritional Information

Preparation

Put the unpeeled potatoes in a large pot. Fill the pot with enough cold water to cover the potatoes by at least 2 inches and bring to a simmer over medium-high heat. Reduce the heat to medium, partially cover the pot, and simmer the potatoes until they are completely tender and easily pierced with a skewer, 30 to 35 minutes.

Drain the potatoes, let them cool just enough that you can handle them, and then peel them. Cut them in half crosswise and pass them through a ricer into a large bowl. Let cool until almost at room temperature, at least 20 minutes.

Lightly flour a work surface. In a small bowl, mix the flour with the salt. Add the egg to the potatoes and then add the flour mixture. Mix with your hands until the flour is moistened and the dough starts to clump together; the dough will still be a bit crumbly at this point. Gather the dough together and press it against the bottom of the bowl until you have a uniform mass. Transfer it to the floured surface and wash your hands.

Knead gently until the flour is fully incorporated and the dough is soft, smooth, and a little sticky, 30 seconds to 1 minute. (Don’t overmix it, or the gnocchi will be tough; the dough should feel very delicate.) Move the dough to one side, making sure the surface underneath it is well floured. Cover it with a clean kitchen towel.

Cover two large rimmed baking sheets with parchment and sprinkle lightly with flour.

Remove any lingering bits of dough from your work surface and lightly reflour the surface. Tear off a piece of dough about the size of a large lemon and put the towel back on the rest of the dough so it doesn’t dry out.

With the palms of both hands, roll the dough piece on the floured surface into a rope about 3/4 inch in diameter.

With a sharp knife or a bench knife, cut the rope crosswise every 3/4 inch to make roughly 3/4-inch-square gnocchi. Arrange the gnocchi in a single layer on the parchment-covered baking sheets, making sure they don’t touch. Repeat until you run out of dough, reflouring the work surface as needed. When all the gnocchi have been cut and spread out on the baking sheets, sprinkle them with a little more flour.

To cook

Place gnocchi in small batches in a pot of boiling water. Once the gnocchi float to the top remove from pot. The gnocchi can be eaten like this or melt some butter in a pan to let the gnocchi get some colour


If you don't have a ricer (food mill) a cheese grater can also be used


White wine cream sauce

Ingredients

2 Tablespoons Butter

2 Tablespoons Garlic, Minced

½ cups Dry White Wine

1 cup Chicken Broth

1 cup Heavy Cream

¼ cups Asiago (optional)

Preparation

Saute butter and garlic. Add white wine, simmer and reduce by half.
Add chicken broth and heavy cream and simmer 7–8 minutes, or until it begins to thicken. (Add Asiago if used and stir until melted). Season to taste with salt and white pepper."
Cooking,fdcq0jd,t1_fdbsh0k,1578281152.0,"I've actually done risotto with cold stock and it turns out the same as if you were to heat the stock. I know it's not the traditional way but there's always different ways to do stuff.

And actually I'd recommend if you're doing risotto for the first time to use cold stock (the risotto cooks slower so it's harder to mess up)."
Cooking,fdcpqjp,t3_ekm3cd,1578280949.0,"My go dishes if I want to wow people:
1) Potato gnocchi with a white wine cream sauce
2) any type of risotto 
3) arancini ( deep fried risotto balls)
4) veal parmesan with homemade pasta

The best dish to wow people with honestly is potato gnocchi. It takes a fair amount of time but if done right will blow anyone away."
