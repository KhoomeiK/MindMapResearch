Depending on the composition of the calories (fat or carb/protein) more or less is likely to be stored as adipose tissue - going over your TDEE with just carbs (complex, simple, whatever, they all break down to simple eventually) less is likely to be converted to  fat, whereas going way over your TDEE with fats, there is a greater chance that a higher percentage will be stored (as fat)

As with Erik and others like him, it really doesn't matter how much shit you eat if it's only about 20% of how you eat over the course of a year. But you have to be consistent with the training and diet 80% of the time. Even if you put on a few KGs fat with massive overfeeds, you will lose it again pretty quickly.  The previous Christmas week I overfed for way longer, about 7 days, and went from about 72kg to 85 - not all fat, but certainly a couple kgs, the rest was water retention, glycogen etc... with in about 3-4 weeks training and back on SKD I was back at about 74."
