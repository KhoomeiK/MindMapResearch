I've been called out in snowfalls when you can't tell where the road is, very scary. Of course I've never been given shit if I was late, or when the battery failed, etc."
forwardsfromgrandma,fep1whr,t1_feocxdk,1579310293.0,"That's pretty awesome! I'll have to keep that in mind for a backup phone. I'm on-call so I need something reliable and 1 year old has a lot of life. Batteries are a big problem, it's been in the -30s celcius this week. It brings down the capacity a lot quicker, if your outside with it a lot. I just was turned off from eBay, after I spent time looking into sellers and still got ripped off. That was a long time ago now."
Unexpected,feowpql,t1_feoqi2d,1579307042.0,"There are weird mental situations with belonging, I find. People like to have  a history with something. My Grandmother came over to Canada, so I can't really say my family has deep roots here. While I exclusively believe I'm Canadian, I know the spirit at the heart of this country is with the aboriginals ancestors. 

I also think it is passed on from when our ancestors were coming over. They would group up in towns/areas, so we tend to have towns that were basically German, French, Ukrainian, etc. You tend to find more of the language there, food, dancing, etc. It's been fading away more, but most of the elders in my grandparents town knew Ukrainian still. 

It's important to remember that they came over here to make a new country (I'm Canadian). While I'd still like to visit where my ancestors were from, I'd aknowledge that the place was only connected to them. Canada is built on many cultures, and we need to accept the variety as the culture we built here and stop holding onto the past. 

Sorry for the esset, but I've asked myself this question a lot. People always talk about where their ancestors were from. It's been becoming less common, from my experiences, and mainly to inquire about recipies."

Refurbished is usually a good bet, I was looking at those for my last buy. However, just ended up waiting for black Friday/cyber Monday."
forwardsfromgrandma,fenjxmd,t1_felzqca,1579286296.0,"For sure, refurbished is a better deal. Computers are the same. I'm a bit nervous with eBay, but I've bought from people/local in the past."
forwardsfromgrandma,felx9b8,t1_feln60n,1579233245.0,"I currently do this, but it can be hard. You have to be ready to drop 300+ dollars for a decent phone. I've used cracked and barely functioning phones at times, but my work requires me to own a phone. I would probably be paying around 40 dollars (monthly) more, if I opened a new contract."
YouShouldKnow,feih8l0,t1_fei8lbs,1579138481.0,"I know. I think the biggest problem with people, is lack of empathy. Some people can't feel anything outside their personal bubble. I would feel terrible if I put someone in a terrible position. 

My god. I feel sorry for the animals that get given to these shitty owners. A guy with four pitbulls, off-leash, was heading away or to the dog park. They didn't  like this, on-leash, collie and their owner. I've never had my dog wake me up barking. My neighbors went out with bats, to try and protect the collie and owner. Ambulance and cops came by, never saw/heard anything about it after. I regret not being able to get up quicker, find my glasses, and help."
ConvenientCop,fei3661,t1_fei0wv0,1579129257.0,"Sounds about right. I saw it once, it was because cars stopped for them. If they waited after the first side, I don't think the cops were going to do anything."
YouShouldKnow,fei0d2a,t1_fef3nrn,1579127547.0,"That makes complete sense! I'm worried about my girl in my backyard. Someone had found a piece of meat with razor blades in it, tossed over their fence. We've also had items reported in parks, and people harming cats. My cats are indoor, but I worry if they got out at one point, I don't trust people. Living near a dog park, I've also seen violent dogs with terrible owners. My girl is big, but you never know."
holdmyfeedingtube,fegz3m0,t1_fegm1q1,1579105721.0,"Interesting, it would make sense since their head is the highest point. I could see the lightning hitting higher up on the person. The electricity will take the path of least resistance to the ground. Deaths usually occur, when the path is across the heart. That's why you should be carefully when grabbing with both hands, you will complete a circuit of less resistance."
YouShouldKnow,fef26rc,t1_feepak8,1579046425.0,"I almost think a shelter would be too risky, though. If you've went their in person, they have your face. I would just require an ID to donate, and tell them this reason. Dropping something in a dog park or tossing it into a yard, can be easily missed. Especially depending on the time they do it."
Whatcouldgowrong,fea4kb7,t1_fe9e0sy,1578944307.0,"Our dog is a sweetheart, but she goes in the kennel. I sometimes lock one of the cats up too, she is a little too social. For guests and unexpected, I would only do it to protect my animals. Everyone I am close to knows that I am an animal person, and my house is probably covered in fur. Some people are terrified of dogs, have some empathy (not you, obviously lol)."
Wellthatsucks,fdp5lfy,t1_fdoxpts,1578620532.0,"Got a car hit twice in the first three months of owning it. Both times, parked perfectly, no note. It was a bad time for me already, I just wanted to die at that point. These people is why we have shit communities in well off countries.

 I remember getting rear ended, and the guy pulled over with me. My car was old with a big crack in the bumper, from the previous owner. He panicked when he saw it, and I jumped in and said ""Don't worry that was already there, no more damage was done! It's fine."". It was sad, how happy he was that I didn't lie. I'm not going to take advantage of someone else, just to try and ""get ahead""."
WhatsWrongWithYourDog,fdm84dn,t1_fdlh321,1578542151.0,"Lol, I wish. My girl doesn't have good scent, but her ears will easily pickup a guest approaching. While friendly, we will close her in the kennel or outside for any sort of workers (delivery, repairs, etc). She hates not knowing what is going on, but doesn't help when my cats are still resting free."
nextfuckinglevel,fdm5krs,t1_fdlz0w0,1578540338.0,"[Yea, you seem to be right.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2016/03/09/the-story-behind-that-dad-who-saved-his-son-from-a-flying-pittsburgh-pirates-baseball-bat/). It's dangerous to judge a person on a single picture. While there are many negligent parents, I've met many who are rather strict. They would have the kid send pics/messages to their mother."
maybemaybemaybe,fdm3wfm,t1_fdlqzo0,1578539191.0,"I'm not certain why they cut the last picture. It isn't any less maybe than what we saw. I'm wondering if they think the smile at the end was just for the picture/people. Even if an event wasn't my preference, I wouldn't show it to the people putting in their hard work."
PublicFreakout,fdm1rn9,t1_fdlv804,1578537754.0,"Lol, my parents lives in a town nearby. Always travelled down to Minot to shop. They always said go north of the states started getting bombed. Minot has a military base, so they are a higher risk for attack. I didn't stay in the area. It has it's own beauty, but I've always had my heart in the trees."
IdiotsInCars,fdlyt0q,t1_fdlgywt,1578535738.0,"You seem like an honest/kind person. I give them a thumbs up, and sometimes point at my dashcam. I've seen some positive reactions, but I also don't post videos (just save them). If I think it's someone making a brainfart/mistake, I will just beep the horn to try and let them know. I've made mistakes, so I can't place hard judgement."
Whatcouldgowrong,fdcxve2,t1_fdcts4g,1578287542.0,"I've had two automatics, that I could remove the key while driving. Both Chev, and I think it was eventually a recall. I never fixed it, since I could warm it up without remote start and not leave the key in. Don't use a lanyard, lol."
WTF,fd9w86u,t1_fd8fu0f,1578238753.0,"You are a great person. I'm sorry for the situation you are in, and the effects it will leave with you. I live in Canada, and will support sending additional help as much as we can. Even for the survivors, you may have lost everything you've built up to in your lifetime. Seeing the wildlife killed is also very depressing. I'm not religious, but I pray for your safety and good weather."
IDontWorkHereLady,fd63z9c,t1_fd5vkoc,1578185208.0,"Yea, I don't think you went to far. She just had the emotional span of a child. You cost her a few extra seconds for her rudeness, and her response was a tantrum. Also, when you assume, you make an ASS out of  U and ME. I got sick of that phrase growing up, but it's suiting.

It's hard to make relationship judgments from this. The lady went pretty far, but I thought your system was good for a normal situation. I wouldn't be surprised if your partner wanted some boundries after this, but that is between you guys."
WatchPeopleDieInside,fd5qlne,t1_fd4s9n4,1578180377.0,"Agreed. Even if he's passing through, it's a stranger with a loaded gun. Locally, we've had pets killed and hunters shoot each other. Not everyone who is licensed, is an responsible gun owner. We used to go into the trees as kids, and I would've been frightened running into a stranger with a gun."
StartledCats,fc9i0ay,t1_fc9du1a,1577552961.0,"You'll see that in Canada, as well. Depends on the weather, person, and flooring. I would always assume to remove, unless instructed otherwise. If it was dry and summer, my Grandma would sometimes harrass you to leave them on. ""My floor is a mess anyway, you'll dirty your socks"" she would say, but a person could feel safe in eating off her floor."
IdiotsInCars,fbwmv42,t1_fbw377y,1577154088.0,"A lot of people in my city do that. Half of them don't want to be passed, the other half will exit (on that side) in a kilometer or mile. People here are way to scared to change lanes, they don't want to worry about it. People won't turn until the lane, they want to be in, is open."
trashy,fbwlsyq,t1_fbweirf,1577153297.0,"That must have hurt. Probably heard the, ""blood is stronger.."" too many times. For someone to be able to do something like that, in such a hard time, is just sick. I have developed too strong of bonds with items, due to OCD, in the past. To have lost someone and then lose items that connect you to them, I wouldn't be able to forgive anyone that took their side. I hope that they realize their mistakes one day, and that you can be happy/not be fretting about their thoughts on you. Take care <3"
saskatchewan,fbwhb7w,t1_fbt0d13,1577149920.0,"This makes sense. I've seen one, and it was at night. I was driving somewhere between Regina and Stoughton. Stopped in time to not hit it, but I would've wrote off the car if it were the other way."
