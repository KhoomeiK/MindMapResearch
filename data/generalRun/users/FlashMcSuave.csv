Cheating may be common in China, but people still suggest it is a bit of a dick move. Yes, I am aware mistresses are more common. But the guys who keep mistresses? 

Assholes. To plenty of Chinese too (especially the wives)."
Fallout,ffeghdn,t3_et1e1h,1579847079.0,"Marcus I would say is at least equal to Harold. The sheer charisma on the guy. He also played just as pivotal roles in the plot and was an important reminder that super mutants are *not* simply idiot cannon fodder. *Gives side eye to Fallout 4*.

Dude was charismatic, founded broken hill, participated in the war for the master but later for the wanderer. Founded the community near New Vegas. Has a heck of a resume and wields a minigun one handed."

Here he is supporting pro democracy protests and giving exactly zero fucks if it costs him mainland business.

HolUp,ffef4b7,t3_et21u9,1579845636.0,There are so many caveats to this statement.
Showerthoughts,ffeepmi,t1_ffedxow,1579845217.0,"No, Chow Yun Fat, a fellow 80s action star in Hong Kong, is a shining light of awesomeness and demonstrated the exact opposite behaviour of Jackie Chan during protests in HK. He backed the protesters and indicated that money wasn't such a big deal.

He is also adored by family and there is no suggestion he beats his kids. Nor is he homophobic or alienated from them.

And for you to suggest that everyone in China is like Jackie Chan, and that his dickhead behaviour is a cultural norm, is the issue here. Sounds like *you* think they are all a piece of shit."

He is *far* more vociferous in his support for their actions and crackdowns than other celebrities. No he doesn't *have* to do it.

As for the behaviour toward his son - you are whitewashing it. He has been a bit shit, quite often. This was all about a joint:

And yes, the daughter wants nothing to do with him. Ask yourself why - a big part of that is she is a lesbian and he is a dick about it.

Yup. Three strikes, pretty clearly a colossal asshole. Chow Yun Fat is an admirable dude. Chan is just a shitbag."
Showerthoughts,ffeaa9x,t1_ffe8dfm,1579841088.0,"I once thought that. Idolised the guy.

Later learned he beats his male kid, refuses to acknowledge his bastard daughter, had multiple affairs and regularly sides with the Communist Party to bitch about Hong Kong people having too many rights.


Can't look at his movies as fondly as I once did, knowing he is a colossal asshole."
Showerthoughts,ffea85w,t1_ffe9oh4,1579841035.0,"No, Jackie Chan really is a piece of shit. It isn't just the propaganda and pro Party stuff. The womanising, the beating his son, the refusal to acknowledge his daughter and myriad other comments speak to a profoundly shitty person.

So when the hero worship starts in, yeah, absolutely people should say ""no, he just does good stunts but is otherwise a pretty shit human being."""
