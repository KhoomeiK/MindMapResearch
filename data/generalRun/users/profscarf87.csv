bigfoot,ffm41mx,t3_eu660w,1580048026.0,"At a time when our state and national parks are being shut down and sold off, I’m pretty sure there are many species that would benefit from some protected Sasquatch preserves. And after maybe some initial shock I don’t think most people will be too impacted by the news. Wolves being reintroduced to federal lands hasn’t freaked out too many people. They will still be extremely rare so I don’t think poaching will be a huge detriment to their numbers. IMO recognizing Sasquatch will at the very least help us protect the land they live on AND remove the stigma for those who have seen one"

Our brains throw up little red flags to get us to clean up a mess or handle a situation but with household messes we all have different tolerance levels. Donâ€™t expect your roommates to just get what you see as an obvious problem because it might not be obvious to them. Talk about expectations and be willing to let some things slide because as annoyed as you get with their slobiness , thatâ€™s how they feel about your obsessiveness"

playarkmobile,fdydz77,t3_enagug,1578778687.0,"I like the iron skillet for taming yeti cave wolves.

But if youâ€™re not interested in cave wolves Iâ€™m not sure if itâ€™s worth it. The cutlass def gives some peace of mind but they donâ€™t last very long. I donâ€™t use them much but I might if I start doing dungeons. Cantilever platform is handy for building mining platforms on mountains. I also built a neat cliff base with multiple platforms, if youâ€™re into that. Eerie turret for is nice for pvp, especially if you buy some seeds for plants that produce potent dust. Frog feet are good for getting underwater before you have scuba gear, but scuba flippers are just as good. Thatâ€™s all I have.

Christianity,fdm6yrt,t3_em2ufi,1578541320.0,"I got married when I was 31, and we met when I was as 29. I felt like you for a long time. I graduated college without a girlfriend and was living and working in a place where I felt like I just didnâ€™t have a lot of options for dating, which was tough because I was shy so I didnâ€™t take chances with the girls who were possibilities. I tried to keep my eyes open and I kept praying. There were a few girls at church but I had a tough time getting connected with them (didnâ€™t know their names and only saw them during the service). I tried online dating and actually got a few dates out of it but nothing came of that. Ultimately it was a combination of online dating having a social hobby that led me to my wife. We met when we both got cast as the leads in a community theater musical production. I was about to move to a new city for school so at first I wasnâ€™t going to ask her out but then I matched with her on match.com so I decided to take a chance. Now weâ€™re married and have our first child. 
My point is that you have no reason to give up hope. I donâ€™t think God has one soulmate out there for you. I think there are many of His children out there with whom you could be compatible. Just keep an open mind and an open heart, looking for someone whom you can serve with Christlike love, and you will most likely find one as long as you are willing to put yourself out there and maybe get rejected a few times"

So you will see boys being mean to each other but thatâ€™s just how they treat their friends. Some boys might also tease you and it could be because they want to be your friend or it could be because they, like, like you like you, or it could be because they are just mean. Not all boys do this but I wouldnâ€™t want you to be caught off guard if you encounter it. If a boy makes fun of you donâ€™t think itâ€™s the end of the world. But You donâ€™t have to like it.
