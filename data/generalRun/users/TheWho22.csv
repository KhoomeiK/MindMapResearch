interestingasfuck,ffbu4uj,t1_ffbtqya,1579782818.0,"Haha well I guess it has really not broken into the popular consciousness yet since it’s not what you’d think of as a “recreational” drug. It’s basically the most powerful psychedelic known to exist. It’s capable of taking your consciousness completely outside of your body (or at least that’s how it feels) and back. And it only lasts 10-15 minutes when smoked!

It’s most popular usage has been with native Amazon tribes, who have used it in shamanic rituals for hundreds of years. Look up ayahuasca for more info on that. And Terrence McKenna if you want more info on DMT and ayahuasca in general. If LSD fascinates you then DMT is a rabbit hole you would definitely enjoy getting lost in."

OldSchoolCool,ffboayz,t1_ffbgm75,1579775466.0,"While marketing definitely has a lot of influence, I think Kiss wrote much more commercially friendly songs anyways. In the sense that they were very melodic, almost melodic. Especially the radio hits, not necessarily some of the heavier deeper cuts. They were always gonna be more popular than the New York Dolls unless they started making less punk-y music. It was good music but never would’ve sold well in the early ‘70s"
OldSchoolCool,ffbo2zz,t1_ffbkq1y,1579775129.0,"Consider this: what you think of as a “metal band” and what objectively *was* heavy metal in the 1960’s and ‘70s are two different things. Led Zeppelin, Deep Purple, Black Sabbath, and Kiss are all bands that helped *create* the genre itself. Then bands in each subsequent decade kept pushing things harder and harder.

But it does seem to me that kids have become more and more accepting of disparate interests than people that went to high school in the 20th century would have you believe.
Discussion,ffbiky0,t3_esoevz,1579766970.0,Hell no. What purpose would that serve? Would that right the wrongs they committed? Would that make the world any more of a better place? No. It’d be giving into the sadistic and hateful nature of our own personalities. There’s no place for torture in this world.

AmItheAsshole,ffbi8sf,t1_ffa3v3w,1579766517.0,"So anyone who’s ever bullied anyone else is just an asshole for the rest of their life?

Do you think they’re all just inherently evil little assholes? No, they’re often kids that are abused or mistreated in some other aspect or their life and aren’t emotionally mature enough to deal with it in a healthy way. So they lash out at others. I’m not saying it’s right, but it’s a *good* thing that OP’s sister has realized this issue within herself. That’s huge progress.

Uh, yeah it does. It doesn’t justify it, but the number one reason kids bully other kids is because they are mistreated in some other part of their life. And since they’re too immature to properly deal with that mistreatment emotionally, they lash out at others."
AmItheAsshole,ffbhq41,t1_ffb6ngf,1579765825.0,"> it does not sound like she has even accepted that she was the one who did the bullying and that regardless of her circumstances, she was at fault

You read the part where she reached out to the person she used to bully and personally apologized right? She’s now working through *why* she felt the need to bully others, and is confiding in her sibling about it."
AmItheAsshole,ffbhm5i,t1_ffbeklu,1579765679.0,"In the context of this post, yeah. His sister is working through her emotional issues, owning up to past mistakes, and confiding in her sibling about it all. And his response was just to nitpick what she said. What Op said was technically true but didn’t really need to be said at all, especially since what his sister said was quite true as well. I don’t understand why Op would decide to nitpick his sister’s realization in her emotionally vulnerable state right here? I’d be annoyed if someone did the same to me"

This is all the proof you need to know you’re addicted to something man. I know it’s fucking far from easy but I suggest doing whatever you can to not use for 14 days. Try to replace smoking with anything you can think of (other than other drugs lol.) Even if you try a couple times and still crack, just keep trying. I’ve had to do it before and no lies it’s hard as anything I’ve ever done. But these next 5-10 years are so important for your brain development. And you’re gonna stunt yourself forever if you don’t take it easy.

AmItheAsshole,ffbfcdj,t1_ffb2kva,1579762838.0,"No, they’re upset because it’s the norm in our culture for a woman to accept her new husband’s name and not change it until she is wed to a new man... which is clearly influenced by a society that has patriarchal leanings. I’m a man myself and it’s still hard for me to ignore this. It doesn’t mean OP loves her husband any less, but there’s no reason for her to remain part of this family without her husband being around anymore. She is still expected to carry the name of a family she has no ties to anymore just because she’s a woman.

However: “No one cheers for the team, they’re actually cheering for the owner.”

This is the direct quote from yours that I’m responding to, which I made clear in my first response. Just because a team is privately owned doesn’t mean you can’t support and root for it. It doesn’t mean you’re rooting only for the owner when you root for that team. It’s also not like everyone doesn’t know that the league is made up of private owners either"

Because your responses strongly suggest you don’t. “Who’s you’re team?” “My team is the Jets” that is a super normalized way of talking about who one roots for. How are you not aware of that?

You’re actually right about the capitalist bit, but that sort of just a side point anyways. Your original argument is that people don’t root for teams, they root for owners since they’re the ones operating and profiting (most) off of the team. Yet hundreds of millions of sports fans exist, and precious few of them like their team because of their owner, or even know who their owner is."
unpopularopinion,ff20zp1,t1_ff207gh,1579490900.0,"“Their team” as in “the team they root for.” You can root for an organization without giving a shit about who owns or operates it. The vast, vast majority of sports fan do. This is fact. And you’d realize it very quickly if you actually asked people why they like the teams they like. Nobody is gonna say “cause the owner is so cool!” That’s the whole point of organized anything in a capitalist system. People are always making money behind the scenes. The majority doesn’t give a shit about that. They like “their team” for unrelated reasons."
unpopularopinion,ff1zx7b,t1_ff1zf06,1579490126.0,"While that may be the objective workings of all professional sports organizations, I assure you that the fans aren’t rooting for their team based on who their owner is. They choose the team because it’s their hometown team, or their favorite player played there when they were a kid, or their dad always liked them, or whatever other arbitrary reason they want to come up with. 

It doesn’t matter if every player is expendable and the owner is literally only in it for the money. The fans are in it for the game and the competition. They don’t care if half the players on their team played for their hated rivals last year. If they’re on their team this year, they’ll be singing a different tune. 

So again: you’re right that the league is a business and the people involved treat it like one. But the fans don’t really give a shit about any of that. They like what their team represents: their little tribe they can get involved with in the sport that they are interested in. Understand?"

unpopularopinion,ff1z2kf,t1_ff1yufz,1579489508.0,"> No one cheers for a team, they’re actually cheering for the owner

Lol what? I mean I know what you’re trying to say. Yes the owners of the teams are the ones profiting most off of them. But that doesn’t mean people are watching and cheering because they want their owner to win. Most fans don’t know or give a shit who owns their team. They root for the team because they like the sense of community and competitiveness that comes with supporting a franchise over a long period of time. Or they’re just fair weather fans hopping on the winning bandwagon as OP said"
