nextfuckinglevel,ffh9xvm,t3_etdcff,1579927412.0,After the shitty things going on in the world. I needed to see this. Good doggo :)
worldnews,ffgehwz,t3_ethm6y,1579904438.0,"...but I thought ""All is well""....."
worldnews,ffgdq9j,t1_ffgdf17,1579903959.0,"I will point out though, we've already had about a years worth of tragedies in a month. Wuhan, Australia, dozens of earthquakes, volcanoes, the crazy locust swarms eating up crops in Africa, Trump and Iraq tensions...Not saying it's the apocalypse, but hot damn that's a whole mess of bullshit in a month's time."
worldnews,ffgdbuj,t1_ffgd3v6,1579903709.0,"Did I say it was? It's scary at the alarming rate the virus is spreading. Those aren't bs opinions, those are facts bud."
worldnews,ffgcw4c,t1_ffgc9qc,1579903435.0,"Yeah Sun or not, those videos are all over the net circulating. This is pretty scary stuff."
worldnews,ffg36m3,t1_ffg2b4z,1579897465.0,Yeah. What a crappy thing to do in the midst of a rapidly spreading virus outbreak.
worldnews,ffg1iap,t1_fffzz1u,1579896426.0,"Uhhhh what? Mortality rate is 3% with this virus. The problem is the rate at which it is infecting people and the ~2 week incubation period. Meaning people who are infected aren't showing signs until a little bit after. That's enough time for them to have always come into contact with several friends, family, coworkers, etc."
worldnews,ffg15f3,t1_fffzfq3,1579896207.0,"Agreed. Those people that are showing symptoms now, they've already been in contact with people and family who probably also contracted it. This is all sorts of bad."
worldnews,ffg0zvw,t1_fffzw1t,1579896113.0,Damn. That dude just faceplanted hard.
worldnews,ffg0qwl,t1_fffzhiw,1579895961.0,Yeah that is what makes this scary.
worldnews,ffg0oeg,t1_fffyq1m,1579895919.0,Yeah. That's what's scary.
worldnews,ffg0lmn,t1_fffyov9,1579895871.0,"Not really...just a random thought by a random person in the world. No more, no less. Do I believe it? No. Just random thoughts."
worldnews,fffzw64,t1_fffzoao,1579895438.0,Yeah except it's spreading a lot more rapidly...and it must be more concerning since China locked down 30 million people.
worldnews,fffz32y,t1_fffwjix,1579894938.0,This is the case with a lot of the people flying back from visiting China. They start showing symptoms way after getting infected.
worldnews,fffytho,t1_fffxb2q,1579894773.0,"I highly doubt that 26 is the true number. On a video just released from a hospital, there were 3 dead bodies just chillin on the floor while workers in hazmat suits were checking things. Think this may get a lot worse."
worldnews,fffyiuk,t1_fffydan,1579894591.0,"Hit in Nepal too. If it hits India at all yikes, that could balloon out since India is about as heavily populated as China is. Sheesh. 2020 not looking so hot."
worldnews,fffv225,t1_fffuy7o,1579892418.0,Dawg...I'm trolling.
worldnews,fffsszw,t1_fffs15f,1579891025.0,Wow! Thank you notabiologist. You sure showed me.
worldnews,fffr8bo,t1_fffqyvk,1579890049.0,"Yeah I mean, I'm not worried to the point where I'm freaking out. But this is concerning for sure."
worldnews,fffq2ap,t1_fffpuf7,1579889329.0,"So far....But shit man, only a matter of time with this thing. Check out LiveLeak. There's a video of three dead bodies just chillin on the hospital floors. No one there knows what the fuck is going on."
worldnews,fffpoi2,t1_fffpkvc,1579889092.0,NOOOOOOOOOOOOO
worldnews,fffp1r2,t1_fffoom4,1579888700.0,"Ha well slap my peepee. My bad. I read the comment and paid no attention to the user. I have no qualms with anyone. But if some twat is  going to try to give me the business online, I'm going to comment back. All i put was a theory. That was all. Just to spark some friendly debate or comments. All this was ever meant to be."
worldnews,fffoojv,t1_fffnmk7,1579888475.0,Yeah yeah yeah. I know. At most I should have changed it to Research lab. Would it appease you if I did?
worldnews,fffohfs,t1_fffoevm,1579888354.0,I mean I could ask you the same thing?
worldnews,fffoe2o,t1_fffocrd,1579888297.0,Wuhan Cuddly Bunnies wipes out humanity.
worldnews,fffocrd,t1_fffo7f8,1579888275.0,God I hope so. That'd be fucking amazing. Can people upvote that and make it a thing?
Scotland,fffni0o,t1_fffnez7,1579887760.0,Oh. Ok.
worldnews,fffnh5p,t1_fffnexc,1579887745.0,Yawnnnnnnn
worldnews,fffnekf,t1_fffn8o0,1579887702.0,Isn't any lab researching deadly viruses potentially a weapons lab? That's why I didn't call it the Wuhan Cuddly Bunnies lab.
worldnews,fffn7s9,t1_fffmlby,1579887588.0,"Yeah. I'm only saying they were doing testing of the SARS virus in that lab. And I'm not at all saying that what I said was fact. It's only a theory. Nothing more, nothing less. But if the safety measures weren't 100% in that lab, and there was a possible breach...who knows exactly what deadly viruses they were experimenting on. I mean it only takes one mistakes right? Say they edited a SARS virus and created a brand new strain of something and that strain ended up getting out because of a human error? These are possibilities that are very real. I'm not saying that I can confirm that this is what happened, but could it have. Yeah. Absolutely. Us being regular joes don't know what is or isn't and can't say one way or another with 100% certainty."
worldnews,fffmc1r,t1_fffluiz,1579887047.0,"Never said it was SARS dumbass. They were testing SARS there. Also, it's common knowledge that there was a delay in China reporting this. A monkey could Google this and know that. It's similiar to SARS in that it's also a coronavirus and affects the lungs and respitoray system similarly. But it's a fucking never before seen strain. Yes, strains mutate. Yes, this is only a theory. But any person who has an IQ higher than a carrot could say this is one hell of a coincidence. Do some homework before you blather stupidity online."
worldnews,ffflizk,t1_ffflesh,1579886559.0,May not be far off the way this is spreading.
worldnews,fffle7p,t1_fffl9dg,1579886477.0,"Ehhh. Can't rule anything out man. You know? Until I have solid proof of what's what, I remain skeptical of people in power."
worldnews,fffl4dy,t1_fffkrrx,1579886309.0,"Just like China implementing its 1 child policy....what if this was a way to curb overpopulation. Dun dun dunnnnn...

In all seriousness I really hope I'm reading too much into this and it isn't the start of something much, much worse."
worldnews,fffkxr7,t1_fffktbr,1579886197.0,Google the Wuhan biosafety lab...
worldnews,fffkrjq,t1_fffkf8j,1579886091.0,But then there's the lockdown of 30 million people in China and the rapid spreading of the virus to other countries. More and more cases are popping up. Of course the CDC and media outlets aren't reporting everything. The mass panic and hysteria would cause chaos.
Scotland,fffkm2y,t1_fffkdvo,1579885996.0,"It's the biggest lockdown ever apparently. I mean that's just it. I, as well as you, cannot be 100% certain what exactly is going on. They aren't reporting everything and the not knowing is the scary part. If this was worse, they wouldn't tell the people right? That'd cause a mass panic."
Scotland,fffkf75,t1_fffk79k,1579885879.0,"Yeah. It really is. I mean it's almost like I can see the puzzle pieces laid out on the table, I just can't make them fit yet."
worldnews,fffk8f3,t1_fffiu9h,1579885761.0,"I mean the sheer size of China and India and the amount of trash, smog and pollution is pretty bad over there. It makes sense that outbreaks would happen these places first."
worldnews,fffjzn7,t1_fffhkx7,1579885606.0,There's also another possibility. And I'm no conspiracy theorist by any means. But it seems super coincidental that there is a biological weapons lab where they were testing the SARS virus only a few miles from Wuhan...What if a contagion escaped the lab. Could explain why China was worried about reporting it immediately and waited a bit. Also explains the rapid infection rate and the need for a 30 million ppl lockdown...again just a thought but a very scary possibility....
worldnews,fffjlxa,t1_fffht1m,1579885368.0,Yeah this is way worse than they are reporting.
Scotland,fffjir7,t1_fffjgij,1579885312.0,Pretty much....
worldnews,fffj023,t1_fffix0e,1579884994.0,I wish the world and people were like that....wouldn't have any problems we have now if people looked out for each other :/
worldnews,fffiu5y,t1_fffir4e,1579884896.0,People in power caring about everyone's safety....riiight....
Scotland,fffis4p,t1_fffim9e,1579884861.0,Right and that's definitely a stretch for sure. But us being average joe's can't know the cover ups and other nefarious things going on behind the curtain. There's just no way to know 100% for sure.
worldnews,fffijum,t1_fffiesa,1579884720.0,A government being completely transparent? Riiight...
Scotland,fffic2c,t1_fffhvsa,1579884588.0,"Now I'm no conspiracy theorist by any means, but  there's apparently a biological testing lab several miles from Wuhan where they were experimenting on the SARS virus. Perhaps there was a breach and a contagion ended up escaping. There's not much known about this new strain of coronavirus and it's spreading at an alarming rate. You don't lock down 30 million people because of some tainted meat found in a fish market. This is too much of a coincidence not to consider being a possibility."
worldnews,fffhrt4,t1_fffhi9x,1579884243.0,It's scary as there are probably way more cases going unreported.
Scotland,fffhd19,t1_fffh1rk,1579883985.0,Yeah unfortunately it's only a matter of time.
worldnews,fffh7zo,t1_fffgt0c,1579883898.0,"Me too. And i'm not at all a conspiracy theorist, but preventative measures are only as good as the people that put them in place. I mean look at the Iraqi flight that got shot down. Mistakes were made and a lot of people died because of an error made by a person. It's a very possible explanation for this virus outbreak. I mean quarantining and locking down 40 million people seems pretty excessive for a virus that came from tainted meat from a wet market...Just my two cents though."
Scotland,fffgge8,t3_etbxqh,1579883422.0,"No cases yet. But give it time. Jack shit is truly known about this virus, whether it will mutate, how fast it will spread, how many people are truly infected, etc. Scary stuff."
worldnews,ffffaz0,t1_ffff3s2,1579882713.0,"Not saying they released it unpurpose, but are you a government official? No, you're a regular joe just like the rest of us and you can't say with 100% certainty that there isn't anything nefarious going on behind the scenes."
worldnews,fffcnbd,t1_fffb9c9,1579881028.0,This is getting pretty scary.
worldnews,ffez7vh,t1_ffeytbh,1579871105.0,"Yeah but 2020 isn't off to a great start...at all.
