Competitiveoverwatch,ff7djy9,t1_ff7cv5y,1579647072.0,"Honestly mostly KSF, he seemed very promising. Also I always liked McGravy. The rest of the team I don't know that much to be honest, but I'm excited to see what Western talent bring to the table. I believe Packing10 is a very good coach, so we'll see. It'll be good to see them do good against all expectations"

Competitiveoverwatch,ff73kqk,t3_ernitk,1579640426.0,"I think a lot of people underestimate Valiant's potential. I think the team experimented a lot in S2, and that now they found their style and that the communication between the players... Wait what ? Kariv got traded ? OK they are screwed"

Competitiveoverwatch,fevd57f,t1_feudvis,1579395979.0,True. Didn't think about that tbh. Still think those kinda moves are a double edge sword though
Competitiveoverwatch,feqomaa,t3_eqbs93,1579344273.0,"Everything is politic. Even overwatch in it's message. But to expect a company to be politicly active is very dangerous. It should remain passive. Look at last time blizzard was politicly active, a chinese payer was banned for some obscure reason at the first place. We really don't want that, even if it's for ""the good cause"""
environment,fegmn71,t1_fef1l3o,1579097363.0,"Nono no troll, but you refuting sourced comments of a supposedly ""New"" account, and blindly rejecting something comming from a french journal, (because 1: it's french and not english and 2: because it's traditionnal media and not YouTube or Wikipedia), is fucked up.
Also feeling brigaded by a whole sub is stupid.
And I really don't get why you feel the need to check on every user you talk to, that makes you even more biased than you already are.
Cheers"

Competitiveoverwatch,fctvunu,t1_fct5y4p,1577962174.0,"Because he dedicated himself into this game He used to love to play, even in an non-team based environnement. He hopes for a better future.
Idk why every one replies with ""money"" when he answer this very question in this interview.

MapPorn,fc2vslr,t1_fbscelv,1577375369.0,"As long as you really seem interested in discovering France and it's culture, you really should'nt have much problems. Keep your mind clear from those clichés (even if clichés are partially true). Here's a good video of a canadian in Paris: https://youtu.be/issF3gfAy7Y
It you can you should try to visit outside of Paris.
About parisians and the rest of french people, it's not unfriendliness, just chauvinism and rivalries."
