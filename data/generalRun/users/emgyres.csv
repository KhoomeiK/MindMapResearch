Card - Pin - Pin verified - If correct you can then choose your transaction - If incorrect you will be prompted to re-enter up to 2 more times. 

Most bank ATMs will retain the card if the PIN cannot be verified. 

So your story does not add up, you would not have been able to transact if the PIN was not verified.
