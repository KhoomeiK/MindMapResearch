Emotional regulation, enhanced senses, development of habits and routines that are ""space-compatible"", genetic modification to make people that are more compatible with emotional modulation and focus/attention to detail, things like that are all eminently attainable, even if not quantum leaps forward into something that's unrecognizable.  It's entirely reasonable to think between a guided maturation as a species and augmentation with technology and generalized AI that we'll surpass the ""canned monkey"" label and become a space-faring, space-colonizing species. 

Past that, there will always be an unruly mob of us normal monkeys with boots on Terra, unless we wipe ourselves out.

Voli's pretty nice because he's a strong engager/ganker/off-tank through the early/mid-game, then can easily transition over to being a peel/tank for your carries in the late game.  That's where he shines against guys like Yi that are coming for your carries - you can really disrupt with Q-E rotations and keep backline divers in the DPS zone for your carries to kite/melt.   


It's also super-fun to time your E to slap down anyone with a dash/leap, from Tristana to Lee Sin.
