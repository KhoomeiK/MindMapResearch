iamatotalpieceofshit,fg0wvdx,t1_fg0vy4h,1580416606.0,"Are you really arguing that he’s not a he? Haha you’re just as delusional and he is! Yeah I’m sure men’s prisons have nurseries so they can take care of their children, and get all free healthcare too. Like I said, delusional. Bye bye now."
TLCUnexpected,fg0vy0k,t3_ewb60h,1580416084.0,I felt like a toddler watching her spell out shit. Just say.... shit

iamatotalpieceofshit,fg0sv04,t1_fg0mf41,1580414349.0,"Yeah well when HE fucks a 1 year old, I don’t respect what it is."
iamatotalpieceofshit,fg0sfbx,t1_fg0mqdm,1580414106.0,But how is that any better? Woman prisons are far better than men prisons and now this GUY won’t have to watch his back from his karma. He got a get out of free card here. Woman prisons have fucking salons for god’s sake.

Seattle,ffyonsy,t1_ffylxfd,1580351419.0,Why do you keep assuming things about me when I’m not saying it? You are the strangest person wtf i never said anything about alcohol being legal I just pointed out it’s always stoners associating weed with children. You are exhausting. 100% done
Seattle,ffyf73t,t1_ffyeiqm,1580344976.0,"Wait do you personally know me
To make the assumption that I’m “suddenly” concerned? Pretty sure I’ve always been concerned but ok. I was once a teenager and let me tell you, growing up in Seattle I would of made a lot better choices if it wasn’t so easy getting drugs and alcohol. I’m not here to argue with someone about letting drugs be legalized, I personally think it’s the dumbest shit I’ve ever heard and morally I will always be on the right side.


And to edit this. I don’t think I’ve ever heard an alcoholic say “let’s lower the drinking age. It’s good for kids” just saying. It’s always the people smoking weed who put kids into the mix."
Seattle,ffycyzh,t1_ffyc37o,1580343467.0,You profile checks out too. Adult gamer.
Seattle,ffy6xh9,t1_ffxxp7a,1580339740.0,"Wait I’m wrong for being concerned about underage children getting drugs... but you are right by saying all drugs should be legal no matter what? Like
I said. Everyone (especially in Seattle) has lost their damn minds."
Seattle,ffxjho0,t1_ffxexjh,1580326390.0,Everyone’s lost their damn minds.
Seattle,ffxcm5m,t1_ffxc2qy,1580322401.0,Oh yeah I follow Seattle just to bully the city. You caught me.
Seattle,ffxb5uh,t1_ffx0ads,1580321546.0,Because he’s most likely selling to underage people? And it’s still.... drugs
Seattle,ffxb0ih,t3_evoaut,1580321460.0,This is the most Seattle thing I’ve ever seen
Zodiac,ffx493q,t1_ffw8yce,1580317419.0,No I’m good.
Zodiac,ffx46q1,t1_ffw0ody,1580317378.0,"this makes no sense to me? It was revealed he had a girlfriend so she still felt the need
To come on here and ask if she could go through with it? Even if he’s an Aquarius or anything else that’s 100% what happened and she got called out and now is butt hurt about it. And also are we just going to look the other way that he has a girlfriend in “astrology posts” because he’s an Aquarius? Get some morals people."
Zodiac,ffvv4km,t1_ffvbaz4,1580274163.0,"So why did you even write this for advice if you aren’t going to follow through with the advice? Sorry but you found out he has a girlfriend, then went on Reddit to ask what you should do about it. Obviously having a gf means nothing to someone like you because you wouldn’t be here asking how you should go forward with this man. Gross."
Zodiac,ffv5sa8,t3_eve9se,1580256348.0,"How is it hard? He said he had a girlfriend, stop flirting and worrying about it and move on. Simple as that."
TeenMomOGandTeenMom2,ffqvjzw,t1_ffquxbg,1580144614.0,I’m shaming her. She’s an idiot
