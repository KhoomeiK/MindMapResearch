Regarding gut bacteria, it's true different bacterial populations can influence desire. That said, it's more because whatever you eat frequently encourages certain populations to succeed and the prevalent population in turn encourages the favorable foods to be consumed. It's not reflective at all of serum deficiencies in the body. The influence is from a positive feedback loop between the diet and the populations that have been established by diet. Cravings are not due to nutritional deficiencies. It's not like the bacteria are saying, ""You're B12 deficient! Feed me B12 foods!"". It's more, ""You feed me fried chicken every day!

Most of which are older children, disabled children, or sibling sets. The demand for healthy infants is much higher than availability (which is where the foreign adoption conversation comes in), so if you want a baby and can't handle disability then adoption often isn't a tenable option. This of course doesn't even touch on discrimination against the prospective approve parents, such as gay couples, older couples, and singles. I'm very supportive of adoption and was myself adopted (as an older sibling set, even!) but I completely understand why it wouldn't fit with many prospective parents. It's a complicated topic."

Regarding chimps, even if there is something required in their tiny meat intake it certainly isn't protein. They're clearly getting their protein from plants. That said, every source I've found suggests the meat is not required, chimps (like humans) are just opportunistic. Just like the horse that eats a bird or the cow that eats a rodent. It can happen without being a requirement. Even if there is a nutritional requirement, humans have accessible supplementation.

Few non-vegetarians are eating 97% plants. It's much more reasonable to assume that high plant intake is required more than small meat supplementation, and yet the ""canines are for meat"" crowd uses their pathetic excuses for canines to justify their 20%+ meat (with 0% insects). The point of my reply was to say that regarding the protein in plants, chimps are a much more reasonable comparison, as gorilla guts can process far more difficult plants than we can.

Not really. There are tons of exceptions to this. For instance, mice and chickens have the same fetal time but chickens hatch fairly capable whereas mice are born hardly more capable than our own. Chickens live ~4X longer, too. Usually development is more correlated with expectations after birth. Chickens (and many other animals like deer and elephants) are expected to run shortly after birth. Other animals don't have to do that and their newborns are far less physically capable.

How can you say that when all you read was the abstract and a popsci report of the research article? The ""problems"" you mentioned in the other post are unfounded.

>I was around six, which I think worked out very well.

I'm glad you feel that way and I'm glad it worked out for you but in light of new data I certainly wouldn't recommend to wait that long if someone had the choice.

>5-6 is probably a good age: old enough to understand the concept, old enough to form permanent episodic memories (3-4 minimum), but not old enough that the parents have had to avoid the subject or make up a story.

I mention this in the other post, but the goal is to tell them *before* they can form long-term memory so that the ongoing discussion is seamlessly interwoven into their sense of self and identity. Of course a child may not remember being told at 3, but they'll remember having ""always known"" and that's what's beneficial. There's no ""earth shattering"" moment when you find out because it's always been known truth. Again, I'm glad it worked out for you but I wouldn't tout 6+ as a ""good age"" if earlier is possible."
aww,feesvr5,t1_feebbym,1579040495.0,"> The abstract's ""three and older"" is pretty problematic binning, if that's how it was done (edit: abstract suggests this, but there's a big difference between 4, 14, and 40, even though all are ""three and older"").

I understand your concerns, but why would you make wild assumptions about their binning based on just the abstract which is clearly not including that information? I understand you may not have access to the paper but what a weird assumption that the binning was just <3 and 3+. Of course it wasn't that. Here's an excerpt from the study:

""Results indicated that generally the earlier the age of discovery, adoptees reported (a) greater psychological health, (b) less likelihood of severe mental disorders, and (c) greater life satisfaction. For all three domains, the pattern was that those who discovered their adoptions before age 3 (essentially those who felt they had “always known” of their adoptions) reported better outcomes with a descending trend that continued through ages 3 to 5 years, ages 6 to 10 years, and ages 11 to 20 years (the group that consistently had the poorest outcomes). Those who learned of their adoptions after age 21, reported health outcomes that were slightly better than those who discovered between ages 11 and 20 years suggesting that older persons may have more coping skills to be able to deal with such news than younger people. In any case, the health outcomes for those who discovered their adoption status after age 21 were still worse than those who learned as very young children.""

No, the binning is not problematic.

I also understand that standards have changed as we collect more data and that modern standards can't (and shouldn't) change on a dime. Standards were different when you were born. That said, the ""conventional wisdom"" of waiting until the child is 6+ years old (a *really* far cry from 3) isn't based on data, either, and I'm not even sure if that's been the modern recommendation for awhile, anyway. The thought is that 6+ is an age where the child can ""understand"" adoption better but the problem is you want to tell them *before* they can comprehend it. The reason is that you want them to grow up with it as their ""normal"". If you wait until they can comprehend the difference then that's too late because they've already formed an identity based on a lie that you are now shattering. Of course, children are resilient and can cope and recover but it's not as beneficial as starting *before* they form long-term memories. Overall I appreciate your personal input based on your own experience but your criticism of the study based on just the abstract is really unfounded."

Btw, I would never word it as their birth parents didn't want them. You need to be truthful but you don't need to provide extraneous information.

For my personal adoption story, my birthmother was borderline mentally retarded and therefore unable to care for children, and my birthfather sexually and physically abusive. I always knew I was adopted but was told details more and more through the years as I could handle them. I definitely didn't get the whole story at three but the important part is to know that young is that you're adopted. Details can come later."

japanlife,fedm6rw,t1_fecykvw,1579014940.0,"I can see that logic but it's not supported by the article. The article shows that the grand majority of plastic waste is generating by packaging. They also point out:

""Primary plastic production does not directly reflect plastic waste generation (as shown in the next section), since this is also influenced by the polymer type and lifetime of the end product.""

They mention this because different plastic products have different lifetimes before disposal. Packaging has the shortest lifetime, as it's expected to be used once and immediately thrown away.

All of this together, combined with your statements, would imply that the US is generating and consuming more packaging than Japan, which is just really surprising given my personal perceptions. I'm still not sure how GDP would strongly affect such numbers. Are you suggesting that other sectors are a higher proportion in the US, and that it's such a higher proportion that it makes up the difference in plastic lifespan? Are you suggesting that the US generates much more packaging (but then also consumes ~2x as much packaging)? I'm still struggling to reconcile how GDP would translate to additional plastic waste.

vegan,febm93l,t1_feb2r07,1578960306.0,"The controversy is that the belief that soy either contains estrogen or otherwise increases estrogen levels in the body. This is primarily perpetuated by the fact that soy contains molecules called ""[phytoestrogens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phytoestrogen)"", which are named because they mimic estrogen in structure and may have some interaction with estrogen receptors. This is usually concerning to men who are afraid of estrogen affecting their testosterone: estrogen ratios or women who are concerned about cancer risk, especially breast cancer.

That said, depending on several factors the interaction can be activating *or* blocking, if there's even interaction at all. It's currently unclear the effects of phytoestrogens on the human body; however, most studies on humans either show no effect, are inconclusive, or show a weak interaction (such as soy on breast cancer prevention). Most animal studies showing an effect are using an immense amount of soy, more soy than any person would consume in a day, let alone on a regular basis. Based on current evidence, soy is just fine in a varied diet.

The final kicker, though? Many people avoiding soy are fine with dairy. Dairy (as in milk from a recently-pregnant, lactating mammal) has real, actual mammalian estrogen. These people are strongly avoiding phytoestrogens, which may or may not participate in the estrogenic system and may have wildly varying functions, but fully embracing actual mammalian estrogen. It's wild."
