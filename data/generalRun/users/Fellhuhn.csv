AndroidGaming,ffpxaqj,t3_eud9va,1580109442.0,"So my takeaway for now is: people don't mind achievements as long as they are meaningful. They also, in the case of Android, do not care where those are as there is no first party support for displaying them anyway. Got it."

TrollPatrolGame,ffhtfmn,t3_etim4d,1579953003.0,"The next update (will be released within the next 12 hours, don't know how long iOS will take as their review time fluctuates wildly) will use this approach:

- Tentacles are never lost (except through events and such)
- If you die you keep your tentacles
- If you die your quest progress gets reduced by 60% (e.g. 50 slain Ninjas will become 20 slain Ninjas)
- If you retire your quest progess stays the same (e.g. 50 slain Ninjas will stays at 50 slain Ninjas)
- The achievement ""Bad Luck"" can't be achieved anymore. Will see that I can get it removed or at least changed.
- As this means that the advanced tutorial has been changed it might take some time until the translators had the chance to adjust the texts, so those might not be accurate for now (except German and English as I do them myself)

Further adjustments to cave upgrade prices etc. will be made in the future. For now, this should work."

AndroidGaming,ffg7xtn,t1_ffg5at9,1579900398.0,"The permission can be used to check that, that at least is true. And most APIs that are that close to the phone's system are fucked up. So you need special implementations for Android and iOS (if you use something like Unity) and then there are specialties depending on the manufactorer... So it is not easy to get this right so this might be the lazy route but it is not a route a dev should take.

One thing with those permissions is that each permission has a category. And if you allowed a permission in one category they can later add other permissions in the same category without any feedback from you. So always be careful with those permissions."

Of course there might be single animations which ignore that as I forgot to include that factor there. So if you encounter an animation which takes strangely longer than others, just tell me and I will take a look at it. In the meantime I will test further with the new ""select while they are still animating"" feature. It should be released somewhen tomorrow (within the next 24 hours, timezones etc. ;) )."

Misunderstood you and though you meant that touches weren't registering at all during that period due to an error or something like another object obscuring the target etc. There is a grace period for the enemies to act (which depends on the speed set in the settings of the game) so that animations etc. can finish before you can select the next tiles.
