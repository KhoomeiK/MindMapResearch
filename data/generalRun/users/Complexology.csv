environment,ff0l5xc,t1_fewx55c,1579469869.0,"How do we decide if we should allow for the use of gas in war? How do we decide if people should vaccinate? How do we decide if there should be a death penalty? We make moral decisions on an individual level and apply them to law. Everyone should decide if we should go to space and then we should vote on those opinions. 

There should be debate of pros and cons and the ramifications should be fully considered. It is just as likely that going to space will spell the downfall of humanity when it becomes more difficult to regulate the dispersed population and war becomes possible among planets."
helpme,ff0i7bs,t3_dibfte,1579469131.0,"Hey kid. Me again... Sorry I looked at your profile and saw this after the diet thing and it sounded like you need some real help. I just wanted to say you'll get through this. Definitely you should try the diet changes I recommended and the running. I bet your sister won't start running when you do bc that hard work and takes guts lol. I struggled with depression too at your age and diet and exercise changed everything for me. You just have to decide to do it. 

As far as motivation issue you mention here. Maybe try some self help books. I'd recommend an old book by Tony Robbins called Awakening the Giant Within. It talks about how decisions can change your life and how to make lasting change. Sounds like what you need right now. Might also check out the Power of Habit. You can use the app called overdrive and your library card to get them for free (probably) or you can order them off Amazon. 

So many people have struggled with what you're struggling with. Toxic friends, toxic home, lack of motivation, video game addictions, weight, depression. They're all possible to overcome. You just have to decide to try and seek out help. Self help books are a great reseource bc there's been billions of people before you who figured it all out. You're too young to give up when there's almost certainly a solution to your problems sitting in a book somewhere.

 Plus advice from others or therapists could change everything. It's hard to get perspective when your whole life has been in the same place with the same people. You have so much growing left to do. You're not who you're going to be next year so it's not fair to that guy to bail out now. Your future self deserves a chance to have a life so stick it out and try to find a way to make things better for him. And def hold on until you're old enough to move out. You just have a few years left and everything will change for you in your personal life. Hold on and get excited for that."
Healthadvice,ff0bo0z,t3_e4meb7,1579467315.0,"Your trouble stopping likely has to do with your age. Your frontal lobe is still developing at 15 and is key in self restraint. The truth about humans is that we're all just advanced monkeys barely overcoming our basic instincts. So don't get too frustrated with yourself. You'll get better with age and practice. Just start practicing now and you'll be a pro by the time you're 20. 

That said, I'd focus on what you're eating since some foods are more ""addictive"" than others. Certain carbs, fats, and sweets actually create a chemical response in the brain like drugs do. So try eating whole foods instead. Avoid chips, pizza, pasta, sweets, juices, and processed foods (poptarts, pizza rolls, etc - anything you couldnt cook yourself). Look at sugars on food lables and avoid high sugars. Try eating more vegetables, quinoa, ferro, chicken breast, salmon, salads. Whole fruit is the best fix for a sweet tooth too. This will help your brain get better at stopping bc they're not as addictive and way better for your health. 

Try eating a spinach/kale salad before every meal. Vegetable fiber actually changes your gut biome to be healthier and can help you lose weight. It also fills you up more so you feel full with less calories. 

Download an app and track your calories and macros. Try planning with your mom on what you'll eat ahead of time so it stays in your goals. Then when eating just fix one plate of food. Don't eat family style where seconds are easy to get. This works with snacks too. Just take a small plate with food so it's harder to keep going. Humans are lazy so making something 10 seconds harder to do makes us way less likely to do it lol. 

Eating window is another easy change. A lot of people have luck with only eating during an 8 hour window. So just eat for noon to 8pm each day. Skip breakfast and start with lunch and have an early dinner. You might be hungry initially but your body quickly gets used to it in a week or so. Fasting isn't bad for you. Research is showing people focus better when fasted so breakfast isn't as important for school as people thought. Plus you age slower. 

Eating better will actually help your mental health dramatically. Running everyday will too. It will help with the weight and also make you feel much better. We evolved to need physical activity. Just a light 20 minute jog will change your life. Its hard work but it makes your brain produce so many neurotransmitters that it can actually cure depression and change your life. I'd recommend you try that small change too. 

Small changes are easiest to stick with so I'd recommend starting there. Hopefully these changes will motivate you to learn more about nutrition to take your changes to the next level. Good luck! 

Let me know if you need more tips or help. I'm a biologist so I've done a lot of research on nutrition."

Kinda like the flu except it feels different and scarier. I felt like I needed to run away from the feeling but I was so weak and nauseous that I just wanted to sleep. My head was splitting and I was so thirsty but I kept needing to pee. Maybe it was just scary bc I realized what was happening and I knew it could be fatal but also I didn't want to go to the hospital and spend thousands on a blood sugar test, IV, and maybe some insulin... I thought it would pass. I still make some insulin afterall. I just needed to wait... and sleep. That was what my brain was telling me.

science,fendho3,t1_feiwlnd,1579282346.0,"I think you need to Google how insulin and glycogen works. I'm a biologist so I know what I'm talking about. 

You eat something it's digested into blood sugar. Your body makes insulin to signal to your cells to take in the sugar and clear it from the blood. The amount of insulin made is dependent on the amount of sugar in the blood. Some is used and some is stored as glycogen in some cells. Your insulin can over produce though if you eat easy carbs which get digested quickly and dumps a bunch of sugar all at once in your blood stream. A big dump of blood sugar causes a bunch of insulin is produced which causes your blood sugar to over correct and actually become lower than before you ate a meal. It also signals for hunger so people will continue this cycle. The low blood sugar people generally experience is from eating poorly and this eating habit causes insulin resistance which results in diabetes eventually. Eating a slowly digested carb causes the blood sugar to gradually increase and the body can signal with a steady level of insulin. This is a much smaller and fatter blood sugar spike without an over correction. Your body always needs sugars though so you often converts over to producing sugar from the stored glycogen. This is why when you wake up you have what's called a fasting blood glucose. Your fasting blood glucose is much more stable. This is longer than I was planning so I'm just going to stop the explanation here and leave you to do your own research. I'd recommend Dr Peter Attia bc he does a good basics explanation."

LateStageCapitalism,fem3s4y,t1_felio5o,1579238790.0,"I mean capitalism makes it so that the research isn't even available to the public for free so pretty much nobody can care unless they are scientist at institutions that pay for access. Pretty sure people would care and even pay reasonable amounts to know when everything and everyone isn't ok. It's just that corporations have liability and money to lose if information to the contrary was freely available.

science,feivsqy,t1_feiq7vc,1579148571.0,Nope. Eating 1 meal a day and fasting the rest of the day is the healthiest. Fasting actually improves your insulin response research shows. You don't get low blood sugar while fasting unless you eat sugar or fast carbs in the morning which stimulates insulin production. Fasting gives a fasting blood sugar all day. And by eating at the same time each day your body will start to only turn on your digestion when it's time to go so you're fasting becomes more effective overtime.

This story is about a fungus which we would normally treat with antibiotics. Antibiotics have been effective in killing bacteria related to some of the biggest killers in human history like scarlet fever, meningitis, pneumonia, gonorea, tuberculosis, typhoid, strep, staff, and more importantly here infections from surgery.

If morality rates go up from surgery then things like cancer treatments, bowl obstructions, blocked arteries, broken bones, and child birth become more deadly which is what we're seeing now. Patients who are weak from injury and surgery are getting this fungus in hospitals and dying.

todayilearned,fdka31b,t3_ellgp2,1578499484.0,"I was a straight edge kid in HS. I was on my way to being valedictorian and president of numerous clubs. In order to make more room in my schedule for AP classes, I decided to take summer school PE. That was a huge mistake. Summer school PE was where all the kids in my district that failed that grade and didn't want to take actual summer school classes went.

Luckily I had a friend from middle school though, who I hadn't seen much since then, that also had the same bright idea I had. She had changed a bit since then and went really hard into anime. She had an anime haircut and changed her name to a Japanese name (even though she was very white like me). She was a bit of a target for bullying, especially in a class with the entire district's flunkies.

With minimal bullying we made it to the last day of summer school PE. On the last day though it was very very hot and we had to go outside to play kickball. The girl rolling the ball was a trouble maker and ringleader of some of the toughest girls in the class. She kept bouncing the ball as hard as she could when we were up to bat bc she thought it was funny to bully us. I rolled the ball back twice before kicking it and getting two bases. This really pissed the girl off. 

My friend had to go next and she decided to do what I did. Except she kept rolling it back like half a dozen times and eventually tried to kick and fell over. These girls ripped into her, initially bc she was rolling it back but then bc she fell. She got mad after 5 minutes or so of taunting and finally said they were all being really rude. The ringleader girl yelled ""OMG did you hear what she said. She called you the N-word!"" To the tallest girl in the class trying to get her to fight my friend. She was over 6ft tall and scary built, but luckily she was skeptical. My friend did not say the N-word. I doubt she ever said the N-word in her life and neither had I. My friend started saying she didn't and she had just said they were being mean.This apologizing just made the bullying from the crowd worse though.

The coach was no where to be found so I told her we should go back to the school before anything happened. The bullies started saying they were going to kick our ass. And they'd make us pay. They followed us in a circle just yelling threats and obscenities on the quarter mile walk back to the school. The girls started pulling my friends braids quite hard. On the second pull I got between her and them and I started cussing profusely. I strung together every cuss word I knew trying to intimidate them. Mostly a lot of ""I'm going to Fing kick your ass"" variants. I was pretty tall and trained in taekwondo by my dad so I could fight. I knew I'd still get my ass kicked with 8 girls though and I'd get in trouble if I actually managed to not get my ass kicked so I thought intimidation was my only hope. It seemed to work. The next thing I know the group of girls start screaming I cussed even though they were cussing before I did. One girl ran off to find the teacher somewhere and told her I cussed. She sent me and the ringleader to the office when she got back to the locker room. 

I was mortified but thought how could my defending my friend and myself from a mob of bullies be bad. They probably just needed me to tell them what happened. Come to find out though, the summer school  principal was from the bad school in town and knew the ringleader personally. She was trying to keep her out of trouble, which is admirable I guess since she probably needed someone to go to bat for her in life. But that was really bad for me bc all of a sudden the principal was trying to pin this whole situation on me. She refused to hear my friends accounting and was spinning what happened, not asking or listening. 

She said I started it and I was a bad kid who was just lucky to never have gotten in trouble before. It was like she was convincing herself of some alternate reality, not even based on what the other girl was saying at all. I remember thinking she was literally insane and wondering how she was in charge. At one point she said ""Looks like you might not be going to Harvard after all."" I immediately started having a panic attack bc I had worked my ass off for four years to go to an ivy league on scholarship bc my parents couldn't afford to send me.

They had to call my mom bc I was having a panic attack and luckily she saved the day by calling the school district, which caused the principal to drop the issue without writing me up. I'm pretty sure none of the other girls got in trouble either though which is when I realize how fucked up schools are. 

Principals are tyrants without oversight and not necessarily even sane people. There really should be a school justice system where you can get your disciplinary issue heard by the school board or something so there's some accountability and fairness for students."

So we were paying $200/mo for undrinkable water... even the new system water has so much copper and lead their annual report says don't drink it if you have health conditions... beware of small town water.
