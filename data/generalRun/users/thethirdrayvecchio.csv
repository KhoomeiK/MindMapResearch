Makes sense. Person I used to know wanted to 'win' no matter what they did and were super competitive. Would scramble to get themselves the best advantage possible no matter the cost. Any time they played games it was the same - they literally just could not stop themselves from cheating and lost interest when people started calling them out and they had to compete on a level playing field.

You specifically said ""every hero in watchmen was made to look like a villain"", why did you choose to call them heroes? Was it because of their actions - because they spend a lot of time beating the shit out of petty criminals or pose for pictures. Comedian is a government assassin and a rapist. Rorschach is a violent psychopath. Dr. Manhattan detonates hundreds of Vietnamese people and fails to intervene to prevent the murder of a civilian. Ozymandias murders thousands in the greater good. The most benign members - Silk Spectre and Nite Owl - fail to escape the influence of their mother and fill a gap in their lives respectively.

Lots of reasons, primarily-

**a) Being Burned Out:** It's been three years of accelerating atrocities and bullshit. It's normalised now and people are checking out for their own mental health. I know I had to.

**b) Churn:** The Republicans have played a long game that has courted racism and consolidated their base. They've essentially achieved what they wanted for years and rigged the system from stuffing right wing judges, securing a voting base, and entered a market where news moves *fast. When* they acquit - not if - Trump will commit some other atrocity and the news cycle and people watching him will follow and forget the past.

**c) Culture:** Americans are revolutionary from birth but they are not unified. The country is split along racial, class, and philosophical lines. Democrats are also more discerning than Republicans when it comes to a candidate. Look at the primaries, all the candidates are being put through a microscope and some voters are likely to choose not to vote if their preferred candidate doesn't get in. With the right, you follow orders and that's it.
