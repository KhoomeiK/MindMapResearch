My professor was sweating for a while :)

I had to demarcate against arguing from PC because PC is purely framed by political status quo; cf. people who were PC under the nazi regime, and does not make a moral argument (instead, it's all about conformity).

There is a sense in which some people have claims that are cultural, and they might not even know themselves that they are entitled to them (and suffer from it). There are other claims that are dressed up as cultural, but in truth revolve around special economical (dis)advantages. Special rights are often disadvantageous, but sometimes temporarily necessary to correct a poor trend."
