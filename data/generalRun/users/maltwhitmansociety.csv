Cooking,ffh9fgu,t3_etau58,1579926951.0,"Add salt. Nothing? Add vinegar. Too much something then? Add sugar. Still not right? Add butter. Then repeat till it seems even. Or slip some citrus in there instead of vinegar. If all else fails, batter whatever shit your cooking and deep fry it in peanut oil and then let it dry out for a minute and hope the oil burns your god damn house down."

AdviceAnimals,ffh7l0w,t3_etkech,1579925364.0,"Where I’m from, at least when I graduated, you got tax credits dollar for dollar for whatever your loan was. So, when you went to file your taxes, you got everything back that you paid in taxes until your tax credits ran out. Or, you can opt to not be taxed at all and have no tax return. I graduated 5 years ago from grad school and still have nearly 30k in tax credits. My totally debt, mostly from my undergrad, was 47k (average to high amount where I’m from). Oh, and if I stayed where I went to school for five years I got a big deduction as well. I’m no expert but Canada and it’s provinces have some shit down. Or a lot of shit."

relationship_advice,ff8xuel,t1_ff8e0g9,1579699580.0,"I found my ex wife cuddling my best friend one morning after a night of partying. I flipped out. Things ended shortly after that. I realize now, I was the one who wanted out of the marriage. Finding her with her arm around my best friend was the excuse I wanted so I could leave. It was harder for me to work in marriage than to communicate with my ex wife about what happened and what work we needed to fix it. 

This dudes got a new kid. Is a kiss worth breaking up a family? Maybe. But I think we use circumstances to get what we actually want sometimes."

You had a kid with your wife. There’s risks. Your wife needs you and so does your kid. And both are more important than your pride. 

Human the fuck up bro."

bose,ff4z5du,t3_ernzd4,1579575962.0,I liked the 700s for a moment test at the shop. But my QCiis are literally the best thing. I do grant writing for a large part of my job and they’ve increased my focus ten fold. I forget they’re on. And the noise cancelling scares me half the time.
