A guy who criticizes you or insults you is generally on a power trip and you're better off without him. Never allow anyone to abuse you emotionally, or especially physically. Different views can be a problem in a relationship but I suggest you evaluate your own feelings as time goes by. Just remember that you don't owe any guy anything, least of all your self-respect."

atheism,fc5scx3,t3_eg5c3c,1577464785.0,"I can accept that Jesus existed. Born in Nazareth to Mary and Joseph. Worked as a carpenter, or builder. Followed John the Baptist. After John was killed he began preaching himself and attracted a handful John's followers himself. He preached a personal relationship with the Hebrew god without reliance on complex law and ritual. He preached that the end of the existing world was coming, now. He caused a disturbance in Jerusalem at Passover and was executed. The world didn't end. Some of his followers drifted away. A fanatic he never knew took control of the remainder. The failed revolution in Jerusalem swept away any remnants of his Judaic sect.
 
Decades later the religion founded by Paul decided that Jesus had actually been the Hebrew god himself. Over time convoluted myths evolved to support this idea. They are nonsensical. And here we are. Most of what Jesus said is lost to us and would have had meaning only to the Judaism of his time. Most of what is attributed to him is resolutely ignored, his love for the powerless corrupted into just another religion designed to control the powerless and support the powerful."
