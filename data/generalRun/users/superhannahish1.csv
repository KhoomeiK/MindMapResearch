relationships,ffy4ijq,t3_evqu2k,1580338396.0,"OP, you are justified in your feelings and I want to offer some advice. I met my boyfriend when I was 19 and we've been together for 4 years. I am so much more responsible than him, but by working with him he has gotten so much better. While dating him he has had some major fuck ups. He failed out of school, lost a couple of jobs. For a long time he kept saying he was gonna go back to school, but it kept not happening. He used to be absolutely awful with money, cleaning, and other basic responsibilities. But I stuck with him because I \*knew\* that if the tables were turned, he would stick with me. I think a lot of his problems stemmed from fear of the future and untreated depression. It's been a long process these past few years, but my boyfriend is doing so much better. He has been in school for a year, he cleans daily without me asking, he's a lot better with money, and generally is much more responsible.

The thing is, though, that I'm young too and I felt fine with taking the time to figure out life together. You might be in a different boat and you just want someone who is on your wavelength, which is totally fine! It's okay to want something different. If you want out... then get yourself out of this relationship, you shouldn't force yourself to stick with someone that is draining you.

However, if you want to try and work through things, I would just start by laying it all out on the table. Talk through it. Tell her your concerns and see what she does with that. If she continues on the way she's living without changing, that means she doesn't care in my opinion. I have stayed with my boyfriend because when I tell him something is wrong, he doesn't throw it back in my face and blame me or make excuses, he tries to change. That is a hard quality to find in someone."
