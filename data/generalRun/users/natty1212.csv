facepalm,fguhbo0,t1_fgufugp,1581120807.0,"Herd management and the culling of animals is essential to the long-term strength and suitability of the herd. There are 2 options, pay an employee to do it, or let someone with a lot of money pay you to do it. With the second option, you not only get cash from the hunting permit for the protection and management of the animals, you also provide jobs for guides, outfitters, translators, and the service and hospitality industry. Also, a portion of the meat is usually given to locals, sometimes all of it. 


Those are your options. Pic one."
