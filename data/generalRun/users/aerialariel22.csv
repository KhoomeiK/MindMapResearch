tax,ffxxqs5,t1_ffxpy58,1580334490.0,"Thank you for your reply. I’ll cross post this to r/personalfinance. 

My boyfriend pointed out, like you did, that most people aren’t criminals or want to do something illegal to that degree. So I’m most likely fine and most scenarios will play out with my identity remaining my own. 

I did call the apartment complex, they said they can’t do much. She actually recommended that I go through the mail at my old address (LOL) until I asked her to check if there’s a current resident. Which there is, so no way am I going through their mail. I wasn’t going to do it if there wasn’t a resident either. She also mentioned nothing was turned in to them. I could call back and ask that they reach out to the new resident, but we’ll see. 

I don’t think I could walk up to their door and ask for it. I’m not that outgoing? Brave? Bold? Hopefully you get the idea that I’m not comfortable doing that. 

Yes, I do wish it to be returned to me unopened. There’s still a chance. I talked to a coworker from my prior employer and she’s said she received her W-2 within the past week. Maybe the new resident just hasn’t sent it back yet? Or it’s in the mail? If my prior employer receives it, they said they’ll email me. Here’s to hoping!! 

Thanks again :)"

If you all are supervisors (or agents) and you’re being paid $12.00 and everyone else with the same title is being paid $12.01 or higher *and* you’ve been there longer, then yes something is definitely wrong. Could be a glitch, who knows! Might be a good idea to have a copy of your most recent pay stub on your person to compare it to whatever the payroll person is submitting. 

To mention it to your manager or HR, I would go in saying either you talked with a few of your coworkers on a friendly basis or perhaps overheard one of the new hires mention their pay and you’d like them to compare yours to theirs, that it sounded quite different especially given that you all are 1, the same title and 2, you’ve been there longer. 

If they end up changing it, ask if retro pay is possible due to your lost income since the time you should have been at the higher rate. 

Also I just thought of this. Are you comparing hourly wages or bi-weekly net income? I ask this because maybe the new hires aren’t paying for health insurance or contributing to their retirement yet. Assuming you have insurance and retirement, this would make your net income look smaller than their net income even if your hourly wages are the same."

self,fdkw8u2,t3_elxda9,1578512451.0,"It may depend more on your position titles than the training you’ve done. If you’re a front desk agent working $12.00/hour and you’ve trained a bunch of front desk supervisors who work for $13.00/hour, it’s because of the title. If this is the case I’d go to your manager, point out how you’ve helped them (hell, even get a written statement from those you’ve trained), and ask for a raise or a bonus. 

If it’s opposite (you’re a supervisor at $12.00/hr and they’re agents $13.00/hr), something is wrong with payroll and it should be brought to the attention of whoever does payroll. This could be HR or someone in finance.

French,fdjt1by,t3_elrul7,1578486470.0,"Any time you see a consonant followed by an apostrophe, the apostrophe represents a vowel. Another example would be *d’eau*, or “some water”. Pulled apart it’s *de eau* but actually saying and spelling it that way is incorrect, so it’s shortened to *d’eau*.

So *je m’appelle* is *je me appelle*, which is then correctly shortened to *je m’appelle*. (The *me* part is said “muh,” opposed to the English “mee.”)

*Appeller* is a reflexive verb so you need the *me* (a type of pronoun I think?) to correctly use it. It literally translates to “I myself call,” or “I call myself.” Loosely translated of course is, “my name is.”

Edit: in another comment you asked about he/she, it, and they. For he and she, it’s, *il s’appelle Jerôme* and *elle s’appelle Sabine*. In this case the pronoun (?) is *se*.  And then *ils s’appellent Jean* and *elles s’appellent Marie*."

I can’t confirm anything (company, amount charged, last four digits of the card) without having the first name, last name, and date of stay. To give me the information in the opposite order is extremely unhelpful. To not let me talk to get the information I need to get you the receipt you need is even more unhelpful. This happens too often and that is why it’s infuriating. 

No, I don’t ask why people need receipts. Most of the time they tell me they lost it, never received it, or it’s for an expense report without me asking anything. Who am I to doubt them? I am not a fraud protection agency. If a man or woman is asking for the receipt to see what the $300 charge on their shared account with their spouse is, it is not my place to withhold that information. The charge is on their account and they want an explanation. The spouse could suspect their partner of cheating and need the receipt for information, not that they’d share that with me probably. The best “security measure” I have is to ask them to confirm the last four digits of the card charged. If they don’t get it right, I don’t send it because it isn’t the charge they’re looking for.

They’re getting charged for 70, not 50.” Etc. 

Besides, I don’t have authority/training to change 70 to 50 or anything. I have very limited access to our catering system, so I couldn’t even if I wanted to."
relationship_advice,fcx84lf,t3_ej3aq7,1578055028.0,"Before I was born my dad got an excellent job. My mom quit hers because “he’s just making more money than me, so what’s the point?” She’s never worked a day in her life after that (~30 years now). My dad has always hated that she did that. I don’t think they even like each other anymore but they’re staying married for... no idea. 

Your lady is not a team player. For a successful family, both parents should chip in as equal as possible. Declaring 100% of her income as hers *and then also* most of yours as hers (basically)... that’s bad news. Either get her to come down off her pedestal or drop her. 6 years of dating isn’t worth 50+ years of misery."

It’s taught me that I’m not cut out for customer service. I do eventually want to move up from this job. It’s a stepping stone to one less-involved with guests and clients. My boss (property controller) doesn’t ever have to talk to them. Sometimes he talks to people from other company’s Payables department... but that’s different. They all want to give you concrete details. I know because I’ve talked to them; front desk doesn’t know the difference between AP and AR lol."

Flute,fcwh0qc,t1_fcwfvaa,1578025400.0,"I agree with all of this. I’d like to ad to 2: try playing with just your head joint. It’s really fun to play with it, honestly. Rolling it in and out causes fun sliding tones. “Plug” the hole at the neck (the part that goes into the body) to get a different sound. Try a higher octave by changing your embouchure and providing more support. All of this will help you get used to the head joint without the distraction of “what note am I playing?”"

The ability to recognize when someone needs your assistance without them asking and then jumping to their aid is uncommon and invaluable. 

Also the ability to listen to your partner’s critiques about you. I felt overloaded with housework and expressed how anxious it made me about our future (we want a house, pets, and kids) and how I truly thought I’d end up caring for everything if we kept on this path. Significant other listened in the long term."

Sims4,fcm8k03,t3_ehxmz0,1577767104.0,"Typically when you enter a home it enters into the living room, or a foyer that is connected to the living room. Dining room and kitchen are usually adjacent, with the living room nearby. Therefore, living rooms tend to be closer to the road and the kitchen/dining tend to be closer to the backyard (there are of course exceptions) Family rooms are popular as well and can serve as a separate gathering space. 

Hallways can lead from foyers/living rooms to bedrooms, bathrooms, and stairs. Kitchens tend to have back doors or doors to garages. I don’t usually add garages in TS4 due to the lack of cars, though. 

Kitchens are best oriented with the sink, stove, and fridge in a triangular shape (in real life) for easy of accessibility while cooking. 

Not sure if these were the kinds of tips you were asking for, but it’s usually some things I think of when building houses."
AskReddit,fclmsi7,t1_fcl4miy,1577751466.0,"I (26F) started counting calories in April 2018 (typo, I meant 2019). Started at 170 lbs. and now I’m floating between 134 and 136 lbs, which is a good weight for my 5’7” self; I’m happy with my BMI now. I was eating/drinking a max of 1360 calories a day, and I always skipped breakfast (or had less than 100 calories for a creamer-only coffee), which I learned later is basically an intermittent fasting of sorts. 

I work a desk job 8-5, did yoga 1-4 times a month, and during my free time I don’t do much (cleaning house, video games, etc.). Very rarely would I do something physically demanding, like moving boxes when we moved apartments or walked all day because we went to the zoo. 

I don’t have much muscle (considering making it a goal to gain more in 2020), but for me exercising really wasn’t a *huge* part of dieting. 

That being said, if you follow similar steps as me and you don’t see any weight loss in 3 months, it’s not working for you and you should change something. Btw, to log my calories I used MyFitnessPal by Under Armor. Of course I’m assuming you asked your question because you’re curious about weight loss (whether for yourself or a friend/loved one), so my apologies if I have assumed wrong."
