Carpentry,fei8a95,t3_epas0x,1579132503.0,Handyman was supposed to place some wooden legs (like a stair railing) but he bailed a couple months ago and my mom is desperate to put something there. Doesnâ€™t have to be a solid wall but enough to prevent her cat from being on the edge. (Cat fell from there once!) Iâ€™m not a carpenter but I get by doing handyman stuff for her from studying YouTube videos. Iâ€™m stumped as to what to do here.

it's easy to open up the bottom case, remove the old battery and replace with a new one.

you can buy an OEM battery (ebay, amazon...) for that specific size (11"", 13"") macbook air 2012 and go on youtube or [ifixit.com](https://ifixit.com) and see how to replace it. you'll have to buy a toolkit which is also affordable on amazon or ebay."

As for the delete key, try pressing down hard on it whenever you can. If you have already tried an SMC and PRAM reset then I would suggest detaching and reattaching the keyboard connector (google how to do it, pretty easy.)"
