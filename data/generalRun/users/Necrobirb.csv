Most of the newer genres like Nu-Metal, Metalcore, Industrial Metal etc. While quite heavy are not regarded as metal by internet people.

I'm not entirely sure how I stand on the whole genre thing. It's stupid how butthurt people get when someone calls their band not metal or the other way around.
