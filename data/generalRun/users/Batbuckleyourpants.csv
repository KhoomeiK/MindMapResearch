Congress had already approved Trump's use of force in Iraq, they also designated Suleimani as an enemy of state, and a legit terrorist target since 2007.

actualconspiracies,fessv8u,t1_fes55ah,1579368680.0,"That is not obstruction, that is the same as the executive contesting the bill, a federal court would have to arbitrate if it was legal. This kind of thing happen all the time, In fact, that is what happens every time someone sue the federal government, and a district court rule against the executive branch, it happens every day...

Not that it matter, because that is not that what is listed in the impeachment charges. It has nothing to do with the impeachment...

The obstruction of congress charge was based on Trump calling on a blanket executive privilege, and 17 members of the executive branch, entirely legally, refusing to comply with congressional subpoenas without a court order because of it. That is it. That is 100% legal...

Here is how it is supposed to go..

* *Congress: ""Here is a subpoena for testimony mr president.""*
* *President: ""I call on executive privilege, that means i don't have to comply without a court order""*
* *Congress: ""Federal court, please rule if this subpoena is valid!""*
* *Federal court: ""Yes, This subpoena is legal and valid""*
* *Congress: ""This subpoena now have the power of two branches of office, hand it over Mister President""*
* *President: ""Fuck.""*

If the president THEN refuse to hand over subpoenaed testimony, THAT is a crime, that is contempt of congress.

&#x200B;

But ,what we have here is:

* Congress: ""Here is a subpoena for testimony mr president.""
* President: ""I call on executive privilege, that means i don't have to comply without a court order""
* Congress: ""You are making out job harder, that is illegal!""

That is it, the obstruction of congress article literally list 17 subpoenas where trump demanded a court order in order to hand it over, and congress had a tantrum and impeached him for doing something entirely legal. They never even bothered asking the judicial branch to enforce those subpoenas."
