Sculpture,ffjdm3e,t3_ett0s7,1579996051.0,Man this takes me back to community college. I miss those days sometimes. Nice job!
ZBrush,ffjd8t7,t1_ffjcc2h,1579995835.0,"Yeah but let's be honest, relatively speaking zbrush UVs suck pretty bad too. If he's gonna have to go third party anyway might as well just use a different package for everything. I think I was just trying to say zbrush retopology is a thing and is an option. Also I don't think there's gonna be anything inherently fun or not obnoxious about the retopology process no matter what avenue you take"
ZBrush,ffhtsji,t3_etpupz,1579953523.0,"Honestly whatever gets the job done is fair game. Personally I use Maya, but you can retopo directly inside zbrush. The issue comes when you need to do your UVs, then you're definitely gonna need to go to a third party package."

AskReddit,ff8nw8n,t1_ff8jk8f,1579688040.0,"You know this is why I liked the Witcher, too. Because of how much the magical elements and fantastical things are taken for granted. As a fan of iconic fantasy genre, I'm so sick of gritty ""realistic"" fantasy in media, where magic is a rarity and you don't see magical creatures that often so it becomes a suspenseful plot device to keep you hooked. Fuck it, I like my magic cheap and readily available, so I can take it for granted but passively enjoy."

3Dmodeling,ff2mlqn,t3_er4mxw,1579513470.0,Hey this is great. Did you create the filigree/normal details on the front and sides from scratch or did you use a texture? Looks great either way

3Dmodeling,feag8jo,t1_fe8yvhd,1578948326.0,Yeah it's pretty dumb. I've never liked how awkward manipulating the guides feels. Like anything though I think it just gets easier with time.
3Dmodeling,fe8v5c2,t1_fe7o5w4,1578931303.0,Haha you're close. I just used xgen. I ran out of time to finish texturing the whole thing so I just turned the melanin off on the hair shader to match the rest of the grayscale everything else. But yeah they're just tiny curve guides with two layers of high frequency and low frequency noise for breakup. The peach fuzz is the same thing but the hair is shorter and way thinner
Wellthatsucks,fe72103,t1_fe6kv0p,1578908993.0,Do you have any other cool stories from cooking school? I'm fascinated by the idea of all the mishaps.
ZBrush,fe6xsq1,t1_fe6v1tq,1578907471.0,"Hey, thank you! It was equal parts based on the mental image I have of my dad and this picture I found https://static.businessinsider.sg/2018/11/11/5be45eb248eb1203e8578974.png"
ZBrush,fe5w5w8,t1_fe5ufoe,1578876296.0,Thank you! For once I actually got nerdy and did research on the time period and the shoes they'd be wearing and checked out books from the library. It was pretty cool. Me and a librarian had this entire adventure together figuring out the UK racing scene in the 1930s.
ZBrush,fe5v4o8,t1_fe5jm9d,1578875643.0,"Kind of a mix of things. The jumpsuit and pockets I did in Marvelous Designer and refined the sim in Zbrush, but the rest is like a mixed bag between polymodeling in Maya and extractions in Zbrush. It's like 90% retopo'd except for the shoes lol"
3Dmodeling,fdyjbs9,t1_fdxqzrw,1578780409.0,Yeah texturing packages don't really like super high poly stuff. You also need to make a lower poly version to be able to uv it properly so you can even texture it. Technically you could auto-unwrap in zbrush and decimate that with keep UVs on to texture but that's kind of a ghetto way to do it
3Dmodeling,fdurdrt,t1_fdug9r4,1578737784.0,"Solid critique and I'll take it. I didn't wanna make the bevels too beefy, but I guess I also didn't zoom way out enough to see how well they were reading from a distance."
