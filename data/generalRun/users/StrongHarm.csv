No, but seriously; The is a horrible null hypothesis, with far too many holes.  How did this even get published?  I wonder how they can feel comfortable with their conclusions based upon flimsy test groups reading touching NPR articles.  What of the steep drop in ratings for some of the news outlets, particularly CNN?  Coincidence?  Is there a way to diagnose Trump Derangement Syndrome?  If so I think Assistant Professor Daniel J.

Your son knows your love.  You can count on it.  The little things you do mean more than you know.  One of my sons had a need for me to wake him up in the night and take his temperature.  It didn't matter if he had a tummy ache.  Every time, I would wake him up and let him know I was watching over him, and I was taking steps.  I could tell that it made him feel comfort and peace, he let me take his fear.  I'm sure there are a thousand things like this you do for your son.  He knows brother.

Respectable.  Consider the word.  If you want respect you have to earn it... that means conveying strength of character, and maybe even dressing like a real man.

Integrity.  Consider the word.  ""Strong or solid"".. the opposite of which might be ""weak or fragile"".  If your truths are relative, they're fragile.  This indicates a lack of integrity.  This can be reflected in the way a boy dresses before he gains integrity and becomes a man."

My point is that the decisions are political and not necessarily based upon which people need refuge the most.  Nothing was really going on in Somalia during the years of the biggest influx of refugees... but there was still sympathy for them due to past news coverage, and so politicians took advantage.  A total of 140,000 Somalians have been given refuge in the U.S. mostly in Ohio, Minnesota, and Washington state.  Columbus received the largest number, around 8000, by 2005.  Then 6357 in 2006, 2523 in 2008, 4189 in 2009, 4884 in 2010, 3151 in 2011, 4911 in 2012, 11608 in 2013, 9000 in 2014, and 8858 in 2015.  That's around 63,000.

The politicians tout the numbers to their constituents upon entry, but the media downplays the total number later.  If you believe the number is only 8000, try going anywhere in Columbus for the day without seeing multiple people from Somalia.  I'm fine with the number of refugees here, as long as they want to be Americans and contribute.. what I'm not fine with is the way they're chosen and the number of families in other countries being rejected in favor of more politically valuable refugees."

There was no conflict going on in Somalia (beyond the usual), while people in Syria were living in refugee camps.  The *actual* qualification for a refugee is that their community is war-torn (as in destroyed) or under direct imminent threat to be so.

Columbus,fdxjfrc,t1_fdxb7hw,1578769260.0,"You're right.  Immigrants coming to America to start a business with nothing but the shirts on their backs was how this nation became so great.  My Irish ancestors came and settled thousands of acres, married into a Cherokee tribe, and started an enormous family.  America turned empty pockets and no hope into full pockets and abundance.  There's a diary from my Irish great great grandmother that speaks of what a blessed land this is.  Another great great Grandmother who was Cherokee lived to be 106 and told me stories about how she was fearful for the direction of her people and these lands, but was then amazed by it's prosperity and positive effect on the world.  Particularly WWII.  She told me that our Cherokee people took this land from someone else called the Rain People, but we left not one of them alive, so she's grateful the world has become a kinder place.

So, yes immigration is the foundation of America.  What I don't agree with is when a politician chooses a country that's prevalent in the news and moves thousands of people at once.  They advertise in that country and offer full grants to start particular businesses.  A number of those people simply send the money back to their country of origin and later return.  They have no intention of becoming Americans.  The politician who initiated can then brag that they moved X number of people from X country, so they can garner votes.

My point is that the decisions are political and not necessarily based upon which people need refuge the most.  Nothing was really going on in Somalia during the years of the biggest influx of refugees... but there was still sympathy for them due to past news coverage, and so politicians took advantage.  A total of 140,000 Somalians have been given refuge in the U.S. mostly in Ohio, Minnesota, and Washington state.  Columbus received the largest number, around 8000, by 2005.  Then 6357 in 2006, 2523 in 2008, 4189 in 2009, 4884 in 2010, 3151 in 2011, 4911 in 2012, 11608 in 2013, 9000 in 2014, and 8858 in 2015.  That's around 63,000.

The politicians tout the numbers to their constituents upon entry, but the media downplays the total number later.  If you believe the number is only 8000, try going anywhere in Columbus for the day without seeing multiple people from Somalia.

The *actual* qualification for a refugee is that their community is war-torn (as in destroyed) or under direct imminent threat to be so.

Columbus,fdxjfrc,t1_fdxb7hw,1578769260.0,"You're right.  Immigrants coming to America to start a business with nothing but the shirts on their backs was how this nation became so great.  My Irish ancestors came and settled thousands of acres, married into a Cherokee tribe, and started an enormous family.  America turned empty pockets and no hope into full pockets and abundance.  There's a diary from my Irish great great grandmother that speaks of what a blessed land this is.  Another great great Grandmother who was Cherokee lived to be 106 and told me stories about how she was fearful for the direction of her people and these lands, but was then amazed by it's prosperity and positive effect on the world.  Particularly WWII.  She told me that our Cherokee people took this land from someone else called the Rain People, but we left not one of them alive, so she's grateful the world has become a kinder place.

So, yes immigration is the foundation of America.  What I don't agree with is when a politician chooses a country that's prevalent in the news and moves thousands of people at once.  They advertise in that country and offer full grants to start particular businesses.  A number of those people simply send the money back to their country of origin and later return.  They have no intention of becoming Americans.  The politician who initiated can then brag that they moved X number of people from X country, so they can garner votes.  Meanwhile, the traditional immigration system has to reject standard requests from people who genuinely want to become Americans and contribute based upon their own merit.  Where are the immigrants from Bosnia?  They're not in the news.  Where are the immigrants from Russia?  It's not in the news..

We came to find out that it was a solution for the lack of engineering skills in their enlisted class of sailors, who were lower class and provided inferior educations in the Communist nation.  They needed triple redundant systems in their boats because the primary and secondary system was often now working, and couldn't be fixed until they got into port and found a full engineer to complete the work.

A lot of their aircraft and helicopters have tube televisions in the cockpit.  This was a solution for problems with targeting lasers.

I can see this in my company and my wife's.  

I think you're crazy because you believe that a man who has 28 skyscrapers on prime real estate and flies a 747 as a personal jet is unsuccessful.  Of course the MSM can give you reasons why this might be, but not so long ago Oprah was having Trump on her shows as a guest expert on wealth and finance.. as were 300+ other shows.  None of that matters to you though because the MSM made you believe that Trump is a racist.  We don't put up with that in this country so our automatic reaction is to hate him.  Unless you're not simple minded and read between the lines.

You're my enemy.. and I'll tell you why.  You speak of the Constitution, which I swore to defend, with contempt.

It's to ensure other nations know that attacking us on our soil means ""You cannot invade mainland United States. There would be a rifle behind each blade of grass."" as a Japanese Admiral said during WWII.  

The only people arguing AGAINST the Constitution because of commas are your vile ilk.  The intent is obvious if you don't wear a veil of socialist contempt for your own country:

> ""A free people ought not only to be armed, but disciplined; to which end a uniform and well-digested plan is requisite; and their safety and interest require that they should promote such manufactories as tend to render them independent of others for essential, particularly military, supplies.""

> ""When any nation mistrusts its citizens with guns it is sending a clear message. It no longer trusts its citizens with guns because such a government has evil plans."" 

> ""Firearms stand next in importance to the Constitution itself.""
-- George Washington 

>""We The people are the rightful masters of both Congress and the Courts, not to overthrow the Constitition but to overthrow the men who would pervert the Constitution."" 
-- Abraham Lincoln 

>""And what country can preserve its liberties, if its rulers are not warned from time to time, that this people preserve the spirit of resistance? Let them take arms.... The tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time with the blood of patriots and tyrants.""

>""Little more can reasonably be aimed at with respect to the people at large than to have them properly armed and equipped.""

There was a shock to the DiCaprio Linear Booty Oscillation (Dboo: see '98-'02 and '04-'09 for definition) which caused what is believed to be a Unintentional Creative Youth Calculation (UPed).  In the years following '10, an inverse sample was examined, which later resulted in a drastic max value (Dmax) re-evaluation.  Upon max value rejection, Dboo linearity was restored in '17.  Furthermore, historical average derivation gives a high probability of DiCaprio Minimum Booty Age (Dmin) to be 14 at 18 in 1992.  A point of concern is that DiCaprio Mid-Life Valuation (Dmid) may cause a return to the Dmin values of '92, beginning in 2024.  If this predictive analysis proves to be true, the new DiCaprio Maximum Booty Age (Dmax) could devolve to a value of 19.
