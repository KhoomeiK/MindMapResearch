Tekken,ffbeqwy,t1_ffbebi2,1579762131.0,"A lot of julia players go on autopilot if you don't have good defense, it's very easy to exploit gaps in your defensive gameplay and doesn't really let you be aggressive. She can take control of the pace very easily if you let her in. But if you try to control how shes allowed to approach you and make her use her riskier hellsweeps and bow and arrow and mad axes, you can create big openings to punish her. So if you think julia just plays like a monkey, its because you're not respecting her enough and trying to implement your own aggressive strategy rather than countering her gameplan, if that makes sense."

She looks so choppy and uninteresting in general. She looks and feels like the basic ""this is an sfv character"" template. Lets not even talk about what they were smoking when they came up with abigail.

In SF4 bisons standing roundhouse was a thing of beauty. They took it away in sfv in favor of unga bunga meaty plus frames crush counter unga bunga. They butchered a lot of chars in sfv in this way so that they can play the oki game more effectively or so they dont have strong neutral/keepout anymore.

I personally dont want them to reinvent more characters, a lot of the reimaginings have been lame as fuck. Ken, cody, juri, bison, poison, sakura, akuma, sagat, etc. A lot of these chars lose their appeal to me when theyre not in a poking based game, and then they fuck them even further by making them ugly AF a lot of the times.

At that point yes, getting hit with anything is bad. However by allowing you to continously live at 1 hp with no consequence makes the neutral game worth less. Neutral game happens at more points than just the end of the game, yknow, and this change made it so that those pokes aren't as important at all.

>How is that any better then getting hit by a special? lol At least at that point the majority of the time you won't have even VT at that point.

What do you mean? A special? Are you talking about ultras? That's because ultras in sf4 are all unsafe and v trigger is not. V trigger also lasts for a long time for most chars, meaning you get a lot of chances to make something happen.

KBD is so good that a character with a below average moveset like zafina is arguably high tier just from having a good backdash.

132 is useless, 123 is okay but noob players overuse it when both 123 and 124 can be interrupted by dickjab om block. 2,1 and 2,1,4 are much better jab strings because the first mid is uninterruptible. Only downside is its slightly -on block unlike a 1 jab. 

ZEN/CDS 2,1 is useless, dont bother outside of combos. Actually pretty much every move out of those stances are useless other than off of an unblocked f4.

bf2,1 and bf2,1,2 are pretty good at the wall, track sidestepping on diff hits, and is delayable. I wouldnt use it much though unless you know what youre doing. The input is quite easy, just practice.

Sidestepping is hard, i wouldnt focus on it when youre low ranks. You sidestep whenever you expect a move to come out but dont want to commit to a risky hard read. For jin, if you notice your opponents like to try to press buttons after blocking a 2,1, you can sidestep the next time you do it and then get a punish. Jin also has uf2, which is a very evasive easymode sidestep attack you can use after 2,1 it you like."
