As simple as it looks, building an enclosure from scratch was surprisingly time consuming!

I wanted to keep it pure and use only cardboard for everything, so the feet and various internal supports are all made from the same box.  But I started to get lazy when I  got to the gfx card and ran out of fan grills. I DO NOT recommend messing with aluminum window screen. Tiny needles of metal everywhere. The cut edges were still shedding bits of wire ever after gluing it in.

If this was a more permanent build, I'd move the PSU farther inside to route the power cable out the back, build better supports for the gfx card and SSD, and tidy up those awful cables. But the *real* build is going to be a Nouvolo Steck - if I don't jump the gun rebuild into my desk drawer before it arrives in a month or two."
