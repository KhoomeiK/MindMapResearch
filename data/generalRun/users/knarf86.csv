My dog (mix) has a docked tail and she is very nervous around new dogs. I’m not even sure why they docked her tail in the first place, since she’s a mutt, but I would guess they were trying to pass her off as a pure bred something (not sure what though)."

politics,fdhme1f,t1_fdgsubk,1578425721.0,"Lower life expectancy doesn’t mean that the health care in America isn’t exceptional (for those who can afford it). The problem, like any, is multifaceted. In general we eat more processed food and more meat than most European countries, we walk and bike less, we work more hours/week, and we have many more obese people. Also, poor people often can’t afford preventive care.

There is also the opioid epidemic that has killed off many young people (when 20 year olds die, it really drops the average age to which people live). I understand that this problem was invented by our medical industry, but that doesn’t mean that the overall available treatment here is worse than other countries.

There are a lot of things wrong with our healthcare system, but grading it by only looking at life expectancy will not give you a full picture."

todayilearned,fdaacwf,t1_fd9z03x,1578243636.0,"Don’t worry, 2k somehow managed to make worse sports video games than EA. For the last 3 or so years, they have made NBA 2k more and more unplayable. If you want to play a player career, you either have to grind for 30+ hours or pay an extra $50 to have your player not be absolute garbage. There are also a ton of unskippable cut scenes in every mode now (also cheerleaders at half time and huddles at timeouts that you have to wait 5 to 10 seconds to skip). Who the fuck likes watching these?

At least if you want to play madden offline, you don’t have to pay extra money and you don’t have to watch stupid cutscenes."

The thing to remember is that they don’t give a fuck about you, to them you are a piece of equipment. You should look at it as a means to further your career and/or education; they will take everything that they can from you, so you should return the favor (I don’t mean maliciously or illegally, just work the system for everything it can give you)."

At the consumer end, it depends on what your electric company bills for peak and off-peak for when it makes more financial sense.

Right wing domestic terrorism includes:

- Pulse night club

- San Bernardino shooting

- Fort Hood shooting

- El Paso shooting

Those are also all of the deadliest terror attacks in recent memory. There are also a few dozen attacks/bombings at abortion clinics."
