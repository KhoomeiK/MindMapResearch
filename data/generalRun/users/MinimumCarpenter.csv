I too was curious about how pedos and rapists were treated. He said they were always housed in their own wings. All sex offenders were housed together. But, if in this case where a child was abused to death, they are housed with those that had committed the same type of violent crimes against anyone else. Whatever dorm or housing unit you were assigned, whoever ran the show would check your paperwork (mandatory). My brother said those guys that did shit like beating kids or as far as that goes, violence against senior citizens, had a hard time. His joke was that they had three choices; fuck, fight, or do laundry. He also told me that after a while if those guys kept their nose clean and otherwise were good inmates, their time was much like everyone else's.

PublicFreakout,fedr893,t3_eolvdk,1579018157.0,"I can add something to the conversation. I've never been to prison, but my younger brother had. He made four trips to the MO dept. of corrections. He had a serious drug and alcohol problem and never got a handle on sobriety. At least not for any length of time.

I too was curious about how pedos and rapists were treated. He said they were always housed in their own wings. All sex offenders were housed together. But, if in this case where a child was abused to death, they are housed with those that had committed the same type of violent crimes against anyone else. Whatever dorm or housing unit you were assigned, whoever ran the show would check your paperwork (mandatory). My brother said those guys that did shit like beating kids or as far as that goes, violence against senior citizens, had a hard time. His joke was that they had three choices; fuck, fight, or do laundry. He also told me that after a while if those guys kept their nose clean and otherwise were good inmates, their time was much like everyone else's. Well that and a mandatory 85% time served before going up for parole."
