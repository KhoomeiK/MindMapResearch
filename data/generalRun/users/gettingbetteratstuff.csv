pornfree,ffbenjq,t3_eskn98,1579762022.0,"Your post was banned from the other subreddit because it sounds like veiled fishing for engaging in sexual acts like sexual role playing playing or maybe in person, I don’t know, but there’s really no reason for you to give so many details and go on and on about who you’ve done it with, etc. you mentioned *way* too many times that you’ve appeared in porn. Also your username is suspicious. are you trying to engage with someone through some weird “addicted to porn” fantasy? Doing that here and exploiting people’s addictions that they’re trying to quit is very unethical."

pornfree,ff7hasy,t1_ff5ot0m,1579649537.0,"1) If you have a foot fetish and masturbate to foot porn, feet is porn for you. It has nothing to do with penetration. If you masturbate to Lucien Clergue’s photos, it is pornography to you. 

2) I don’t think abstinence from masturbation and porn is not driven by religion. I was never religious. I simply see the damage it’s causing me and how it’s preventing me from being the best person I can be. 

But as to your original question; it’s interesting, and I think about it a lot actually. But I don’t know. For me, the pornographic images went away after a week weeks. I still get the occasional flash or two but it’s very faint, and my reaction is not so strong. I think time and viewing lots of other images like art will keep helping. Or maybe they’re stuck with you forever."
pornfree,ff5le76,t3_ers44f,1579598561.0,"How long ago did you quit? What’s the longest you’ve gone without viewing porn? and don’t be stupid, porn is any sexual imagery that you use to get off. it doesn’t matter the content."
pornfree,feyoxj2,t1_feyg2r9,1579448504.0,"Yes! This. This is how it is. The urges come like gusts of wind, and go away just as quickly."
pornfree,fewop7r,t1_fev2gsl,1579417164.0,"My definition is similar, a form of escapism that you want to stop but feel powerless and often put off other responsibilities to do."
Stoicism,fev7873,t3_eqm7js,1579393952.0,"There’s really no way around this. It’s a natural way we all view the other person when the first feelings of attraction are there. Even if we, for example, intentionally express our flaws to the other person, they still see it as attractive (for example if you say “I’m pretty lazy” the other person might think “oh that’s nice he’s not too stressed out, he knows how to relax and enjoy life.”). The best you can do is be aware of it, smile, and appreciate that you’re creating these happy feelings (however fleeting) in the other person. Don’t try to see the negative (it’s all an act, she doesn’t see the *real* me”). She will see what she wants to see, and that’s beyond your control.

But, of course, this usually goes away after a while of being together, which i think is the underrated value of long term relationships. Having someone to criticize you of your flaws brings the flaws to the foreground when usually we have a tendency to ignore them. If you’re interested in really improving yourself, get into a long term relationship and be welcoming to your partner’s criticisms as potential areas in which you could improve."
pornfree,fept374,t3_eqcdxi,1579330332.0,"Masturbation is quite literally self pleasure and nothing more. There’s a reason we use it as a metaphor for other types of self indulgent behavior (“mental masturbation,” etc.). Do you *need* to masturbate? What benefits does it give? To relax? There are tons of other ways to relax that don’t mess with your dopamine and energy levels and have other benefits, such as reading or socializing. Even video games often carry with them a social benefit or mental benefit. Masturbation improves nothing other than your ability to masturbate more effectively. So I agree with others, just don’t masturbate. If you must, don’t use porn."
