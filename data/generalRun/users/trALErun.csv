We thought Gus was a Collie mix, but now we're leaning towards hound. We'll definitely do a DNA test eventually, but guessing is fun."
WhatsWrongWithYourDog,ffhdqu0,t1_ffh5rm6,1579931129.0,"We think he's 5, but he's a rescue from the streets of TX so we're not really sure. We just know we're super lucky to have found him. He's a New England boy, now!

Thanks for saving Sadie, she sure looks like a happy pup :)"

flashlight,ffgt6iv,t1_ffgsfr1,1579914426.0,"It's a very strange effect. My best setup so far has been a Fenix E16 with a diffuser worn around my neck and the K1 in my hand. That way I can see my immediate surroundings at all times and look far away in a smaller area if I hear a noise or just want to scan for eyes.

It came in handy a couple weeks ago when I was walking by a river in pitch black (no moon and cloudy skies). It was dead quiet, then out of nowhere I hear a massive SMACK from the river. It turned out to be a beaver that apparently didn't appreciate my company. None of my other lights have been able to reach the river through the trees at night, but the K1 lit that little guy up no problem."
flashlight,ffgs9um,t1_ffgrr8w,1579913761.0,"That's what I thought based on all other lights, but the K1 can really cut through as long as there's nothing nearby in the hot spot. I guess a dedicated thrower might be as good as it gets."

flashlight,ffgq4lh,t3_ethxbc,1579912211.0,Not even 1/4 of the w30 candela. Is there something else compelling about this light?
flashlight,ffgpu39,t1_ffgo05u,1579912006.0,"I'm afraid I don't know all the details, but I believe the SLD product is the first to consolidate the laser diode and phosphor emitter into a single unit. The main benefit I see to this is form factor - the chip can be installed in a smaller optic because it's not restricted by the size constraints for a system of parts to focus the laser light onto the phosphor. I would venture a guess that it's also more efficient, although none of this tech has proven to be particularly efficient yet overall."
EDC,ffgni8n,t1_fffsmsk,1579910365.0,"Check out the Leatherman Squirt PS4. The little pliers are so handy, along with most of the other tools. This is the one tool I try to have with me at all times, and it's pretty easy to do so with how tiny it is."
flashlight,fff2oky,t3_et9u8j,1579874070.0,"I'll take this opportunity to mention that I recently contacted SLD about their LaserLight chip, specifically regarding upcoming handheld applications. They had this to say:

politics,ffetucy,t1_ffeg9wj,1579865248.0,"I've stopped giving them that excuse. I think the simplest answer is the correct one in this case. Their primary motivations are greed and lust for power. They didn't become US senators by being satisfied with ""enough"" - they will fight tooth and nail to keep their hoard.

That, as opposed to the rare examples of honest politicians who are driven by their desire to do good. For them, the paycheck and influence of their position is likely poor compensation for the stress of not being able to help others as much as they could without the oppression of their depraved colleagues."
politics,ffesrqf,t1_ffentym,1579863792.0,"It's just politics tho amirite? /s

Unthinkable that a person could get comfortable with throwing an entire countries citizens under the bus for their own career boost. Thank FSM some of us are finally starting to smarten up to their game. It's going to take some time to tear down this machine, though..."
Bikeporn,ffesiw0,t3_et4hzs,1579863442.0,Amazing that I thought this was a Klein at first glance. They really were decades ahead of their time with those paint jobs.
OurPresident,ffer9p3,t1_ffequet,1579861593.0,"We're nowhere near the political and social environment for that to be a realistic platform for any current candidate - that's the problem. If more people were aware of and willing to deal with these major issues, we would certainly see such candidates emerge."
OurPresident,ffe9rcc,t1_ffe7k8s,1579840632.0,"Think of the theoretical extreme left candidate. Further left. No, even *further*. There you go.

*Far* left is a candidate who will temporarily sacrifice human freedoms and comforts for the betterment of the world's future. Like, ""no more cars"" type of policies. That's probably a terrible example, but you get my point. Stuff like M4A and removing college debt is babytown frolics compared to the level of change we could have with a far left candidate."
AdviceAnimals,ffe8lb5,t3_estuvx,1579839666.0,"This reminds me of an idea I had recently. Please let me know why it's terrible.

Everyone gets to vote on every ""significant"" issue (we'll work out the details of that later). If your vote aligns with a positive outcome (details TBD), the weight of your vote increases, and vis versa. Very rapidly all of the people who make the best choices for the world vastly overpower the blithering idiots who would cripple our society with their opinions. Everyone benefits. Everything is optimized. Nothing is wrong. Humanity becomes a utopian miracle race and begins conquering the universe.

So are we doing this or...?"

EDC,ffcqvcf,t3_esvokw,1579805365.0,"I'd like to know how you found vaporwave themed stuff that matches this well. Did you go out of your way to look for matching items, or did you just stumble across them over time?"
flashlight,ffcevjf,t3_esu5d0,1579797963.0,"I've been thinking about this as justification for my next flashlight. Shouldn't my wife have something to defend herself with when walking the dog or going for a run by herself? Then again, is a somewhat pointy flashlight really the best option for self defense? No, but she will actually take it with her, at least when she needs a light.

Short answer, it's better than nothing. But if you're serious about self defense there are far better options."
EDC,ffc7xvw,t1_ffc4xrs,1579793603.0,That's the one! Thanks. I'll buy this to start with and make my own if it's not quite right.
EDC,ffc3aa7,t1_ffc2yd1,1579790474.0,"Very nice looking, but a bit too fancy for my needs. <$20 seems reasonable for a lanyard."
flashlight,ffc2yty,t1_ffc2gm2,1579790243.0,"Maybe we could get a BLF starter going if there's enough interest. SST-20 front thrower, 219b side flood emitters, Anduril, 18650, integrated type-C charging, and accessory mounting attachments to attach it to anything at any angle."
flashlight,ffc1k85,t1_ffb4xou,1579789203.0,"I guess I haven't looked into any non-lithiums in quite a while. So many lights have on board charging now, I just don't see the appeal of using old battery tech."
EDC,ffc0hpv,t1_ffc0g3d,1579788388.0,No. For an *olive drab* box cutter and bottle opener.
EDC,ffc0dlc,t1_ffbwpsp,1579788298.0,Google says $180. Yikes...
flashlight,ffb1uao,t1_ffb19em,1579749684.0,"I'd want a wider beam if it didn't have the side lights. I guess it comes down to preference. My thinking is the front emitter should be dedicated for maximum throw (within reason), and the sides for max flood. I think the sides are pretty close to perfect already, but the main barely goes as far as my 10440 thrower."
flashlight,ffb1gt6,t3_es5ye0,1579749429.0,"As others have said, the K1 is a very specialized ""thrower"". That mostly limits you to looking at very far away stuff. Unless you're sure that's what you want, do some more research to see what other options might interest you. The K1 is pretty expensive anyways, so unless you really want a thrower there are much cheaper options which are still very high quality lights."
flashlight,ffazf3d,t1_ffax2jv,1579748044.0,"I think the main emitter is plenty bright. My one gripe is that it's not much of a thrower. What's the point of flood light on the side if the main emitter is already pretty floody?

Don't get me wrong, I love this light and Lumintop deserves a ton a praise for trying something so unique. I just hope there's a gen 2, as well as a larger 18650 model in the future."
flashlight,ffaw5y5,t1_ffaryr4,1579745888.0,300 lumens with a nimh? Damn.
flashlight,ffatjvh,t1_ffaose3,1579744158.0,I wasn't expecting it to be as nice as it is. It has a lot of character for such a little light. I actually enjoy that it flickers a bit - makes it seem like a magical device (if that's not too nerdy for you). Hopefully it will survive a long time as my EDC.
flashlight,ffat7fb,t1_ffalvd7,1579743927.0,"Honestly when I ordered it I thought it had performance upgrades, too. It turns out Vinh measures his outputs differently, so his reported specs tend to look inflated. I can forgive that since he didn't charge extra from MSRP (except for the cosmetic add-ons). Overall I'm super impressed and happy with his work."
flashlight,ffamqcs,t3_eskwgg,1579739577.0,"Made a few new additions to my modest collection. I used to have a specific purpose for every light I owned, but now I'm making up reasons...

The Eiger just came in today. It's my new EDC - it lives in my wallet. The other new ones are basically toys. My older lights are all workhorses for dog walking duty etc. Wonder what I'll ""need"" next?"
flashlight,ff9jxvi,t1_ff9gaa6,1579714595.0,I'm giving the benefit of the doubt that they're a relatively small company and their U.S. PR guy is doing his best. Since they are apparently misrepresenting themselves with false advertising I have a bit less sympathy...
flashlight,ff9f5ju,t1_ff9clci,1579711691.0,"Thanks for the explanation. I still wouldn't consider ""borderline linguistics"" to be an acceptable measure of nationality."
flashlight,ff94t33,t1_ff91ig1,1579704849.0,That looks really good! Reminds me a bit of the GT Micro with NW emitter. Not sure what the temp is on that one but beamshots look pretty warm.
flashlight,ff93tyk,t1_ff8wv4g,1579704180.0,Hope you get some flashlight money back from the gubmt
flashlight,ff93dsa,t3_esa6i7,1579703862.0,"I looked all over the interwebs for green K1 beamshots - no luck. I did find a beamshot of the same emitter, but I didn't save the link. It was cool to see the beam one time, but that's about all it's worth. Honestly I'd suggest a laser if you just want something colorful that goes really far."

bose,ff8x4q3,t1_ff8wszl,1579698958.0,"Lol, that's crazy. I guess basic earbuds can be pretty reliable, as long as the cords are durable. But I wouldn't expect them to be waterproof!"
