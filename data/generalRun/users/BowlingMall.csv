todayilearned,fcmcyyu,t1_fcmcq70,1577770898.0,"My point is that if it takes 100 to kill the average person then some people will be dead at 50 (and obviously others can be killed even by 1). At any rate I'm not even talking about dying, any sort of allergic attack is no fun. I have asthma and I sure as fuck wouldn't take $10,000 in order to have an asthma attack even if I knew it wasn't fatal."

movies,fcmccx2,t3_ehx758,1577770342.0,"I agree with you that people in movies are usually much more wealthy and good looking than real life. What I disagree with is the argument that this doesn't relate well. People don't WANT to watch a movie about their own boring middle class life; they want to watch a movie about what they wish their life would be. That invariably means attractive people and wealth. You just have to remember that movies are all about wish fulfillment, not reality. The same reason superhero movies do so well; because deep down most of us feel weak and wish we had the power to make the world a better place and these movies let us vicariously fulfill that wish."

2. While nepotism is a problem everywhere it's much more of a problem when we're talking about incredibly powerful industries like the media and finance than it is when we're talking about hiring someone for a low wage job."

I really like how RLM called this being, ""passive progressive"". Like you're only progressive to the point that it will make you a media darling, but not to the point that it will actually be controversial or in any way negatively affect your bottom line."

Few people here would pay sticker price for a first class seat so we clearly don't value them at that price. The question  that matters is what you personally would pay for that seat/room, not what the sticker price is.

Also there's things like status to be considered. If dude has Diamond status at Hilton and is likely to get upgraded then his value will be much higher than if he has no status."

news,fcm1j1q,t1_fcm10ha,1577761804.0,In DC there is obviously the largest Holocaust Museum. Right along with the Smithsonian. It hardly mentions anyone other than Jews. Want to know why? Because it's not actually part of the Smithsonian; it's a privately run museum owned by a Jewish advocacy group that everyone just assumes is part of the Smithsonian.
news,fcm1c88,t1_fcm08j0,1577761665.0,"That is certainly a part of it, but nepotism is also a part.

I actually do love your comment though because again it shows the disparity between what is and isn't politically correct to say. Mentioning that Jews are rich because their culture places a huge emphasis on education and work ethic is seen as perfectly acceptable. But mentioning that blacks are poor because their culture places little emphasis on education and work ethic will probably get me banned here. Both are equally true, but it's incredible how different we view this argument depending on which group it's applied to and THAT fact is something we also need to discuss."

news,fcm0qle,t1_fclzvc0,1577761219.0,"And of course just look up who owns most of those media conglomerates.

I think an even more pernicious example has to do with coverage of the Holocaust. When you ask how many people died you will generally hear, ""6 million Jews"". But actually 12 million people died in the Holocaust. It's just we never hear about the millions of ethnic Poles killed or the other groups. And the millions of Slavs/Communists killed were downright covered up to avoid letting the USSR seem sympathetic during the Cold War. Also the Holocaust was only the 3rd largest genocide and was eclipsed by the purges of Stalin and Mao, but again you hardly ever hear about those.

This isn't anything specific to Jews though; History is always written by those in power."
news,fclzwln,t1_fclzo9z,1577760611.0,You're right. I've known a lot of Indian families who are the same way too. I'm just pointing out that we give these groups a pass at being bigoted. The more important issue though isn't dating restrictions it's nepotism among these wealthy Jewish families.

Our murder rate is something like 10x that of places like Japan and Singapore. We should absolutely be proud of the progress we've made, but that doesn't change the fact that lots more progress is needed."
news,fclz79q,t1_fcly7o5,1577760096.0,I think our country absolutely needs to have a discussion about nepotism in the Jewish community. It's not anti-semitism to question the issues you have brought up. However these dipshits going around killing Jews obviously make any sort of rational discussion of this topic impossible. These Black Hebrew Israelites need to be labeled a hate group and potentially even a domestic terrorist group.
news,fclyzdu,t1_fclrezf,1577759939.0,There was a report that came out a while about the demographics of billionaires. Being Jewish made a person 200x as likely to be a billionaire. That's an absolutely staggering number in a world where even a 12% gender pay gap is seen as massive issue. Orthodoxy Jewish households have a median income over 3x that of the US median. When you consider all the animosity these days over economic inequality it's really no wonder that anti-Jewish feelings are gaining a lot more traction since Jews are seen as the ones on the top of the pyramid oppressing the rest of society.
news,fclybcl,t1_fclqwie,1577759455.0,A lot of Jews go overboard with it though. I've dated a few Jewish girls and every time it had to be in secret because their parents wouldn't approve of them dating a non-Jew. Imagine if a white person's parents objected to them dating a black person. They would instantly be labeled a racist. But when Jews do it nobody blinks an eye.
news,fcly4kg,t1_fclexdf,1577759321.0,"Consider the fact that even a 10-20% disparity among races or genders often results in massive political animosity and then consider the fact that Jews are 200x as likely to be billionaires as non-Jews (20,000% disparity!). They wield considerable control over several industries (most notable the banking industry) and nepotism is rampant. When you have economically marginalized groups like African Americans encountering Jews who are the most economically powerful group there's bound to be animosity (the specific point of friction in places like NYC is often Jews gentrifying traditionally black neighborhoods). When people write stuff like, ""eat the rich"" this is where it ends up.

Of course like all bigots most of these people are pretty stupid so they end up attacking the most visibly Jewish communities even though those aren't necessarily the ones who are even wielding economic power."
news,fchqs70,t1_fcfeegx,1577653170.0,"There are plenty of valid criticisms of the Jewish community and we in the US need to be able to discuss those criticisms without labeling it, ""antisemitism"".
