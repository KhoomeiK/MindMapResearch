subreddit,self ID,parent ID,time,text
LSD,fffb9vt,t1_ffewdcg,1579880160.0,i know the feeling lmao especially when iâ€™m taking a selfie just to be stupid and flash is on.
shrooms,ffdbnkn,t1_ffck8oe,1579817420.0,just crosspost it to that subreddit
fakehistoryporn,ffd5yl8,t1_ffcxgl5,1579814068.0,me and my friend were just talking about becoming astronauts just to smoke weed and take acid in space while looking at the planets
PewdiepieSubmissions,ffcsk35,t1_ffcj33r,1579806388.0,i may be wrong but i think a catapult launches things and a trebuchet throws/slings them.
drugscirclejerk,ffcoesi,t1_ffcn9e9,1579803778.0,that works too cos it cauterizes the wound.
drugscirclejerk,ffcl3ax,t1_ffci3pm,1579801750.0,you have to boof 10 pounds of dry ice then boof one lit cigarette to melt the dry ice.

Psychedelics,ffalr5c,t1_ffajmbg,1579738914.0,thatâ€™s what iâ€™m looking for. i have this condition called misophonia (and possibly many other undiagnosed mental illnessâ€™) that has no known cure or treatment other than plugging your ears with something and listening to superposition music in hopes that you go deaf and i hope that psychedelics will help me find peace with that. everyone thinks iâ€™m some sort of druggie who only lives to get high but no one understands what these things can do to you for the better or the worse.
Psychedelics,ffajemf,t1_ffaj0qc,1579737205.0,i will and felling the need to de-stigmatize the supposed negatives around psychedelics is totally understandable. it amazes me that people still believe lsd sticks to the brain.
Psychedelics,ffaisuy,t1_ffa7giy,1579736754.0,oh my bad bro. sorry to hear about your brother. idk what itâ€™s like to go through that but i imagine itâ€™s not easy.

RoastMe,ff7036j,t1_ff6qw4i,1579638430.0,and if you swipe the comment to the left it collapses. tapping the top of the comment next to the name also collapses it.
RoastMe,ff57d31,t1_ff55m1r,1579582362.0,to prevent from having to scroll so far collapse the comments when youâ€™re done reading them.
drugscirclejerk,ff56p0v,t1_ff3s7qt,1579581789.0,i agree itâ€™s the only reason iâ€™m still on reddit.

Psychonaut,fel4so0,t1_fel0w2m,1579214059.0,i occasionally go to school high and i function pretty well before passing out around lunch so yeah i see your point.
HydroHomies,fel4ljj,t1_fel3sgh,1579213936.0,i mentioned it above and yes it is sweet tea but i am far from a southerner and like to add a spoonful of sugar to 10 ozs of tea that is pretty far from sweet and heat it in the microwave for 2 mins and it taste amazing as cold tea is disgusting to me.
Psychonaut,fekt713,t1_fekruya,1579207094.0,you got a point there

misophonia,fek8sz4,t1_fek4u0k,1579194994.0,i understand that they canâ€™t control how loud they chew and that other people enjoy popcorn which is why i donâ€™t go to the movies instead of whining and complaining to them to stop being loud. as for your imaginary illness statement i donâ€™t have time to deal with your ignorance.
Psychonaut,fejzpkq,t1_fejz8pu,1579189494.0,when iâ€™m even just barely drunk i act a fool but when iâ€™m high i can still do basic things and iâ€™m more relaxed so iâ€™d expect some punishment for coming in drunk. i do get your point tho. i wouldnâ€™t come in intoxicated in any way.
misophonia,fejzi02,t1_fejb1rc,1579189363.0,i personally love the movies more than i like watching them at home and i donâ€™t think popcorn is an essential for it. but i canâ€™t enjoy it because of misophonia. donâ€™t be dick just because someone has a different opinion than you do.
