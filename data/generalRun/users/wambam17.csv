LateStageCapitalism,fgi74od,t1_fgi5vdp,1580809050.0,"While I appreciate and understand the sentiment, that line of thinking is generally not going to bring you any results. 

Think about it this way: you start a cupcake business. At the start, you were the baker, the greeter, the accountant, the cashier, Everything. Slowly you become bigger and bigger and are now running a chain of these cupcake stores. You worked very hard to get here. So does the 16 yr old kid working as a cashier also deserve the same amount of money that you now earn? If not money, does he get the input into company decisions for expanding or closing down branches? How do you run a company democratically when it's obvious that not everyone has the same level of attachment to the company? 

Things can and should definitely change for the better, but the way you want to go about it will generally lead to socialism countries like China where nobody except one entity has ALL the power. And that has its own dangers."

Everytime you do it or have a strong urge to do it, do a quick 15-30 pushups. The exercise will take your mind off of it, and more importantly, it'll pump you full of the ""feel good"" chemicals.

You can break the habit if you really want to!"
AskReddit,ffzgzkg,t1_ffzgjgd,1580378638.0,No it won't. The Palestine isn't in a position to do much beyond refusal to accept the treaty.

gaming,ffiwfxc,t1_ffib4qc,1579984363.0,"My comment wasn't to pick a fight, however, the reason for revisions for consoles is not often due to simple design faults. There are likely countless reasons for revisions, but I cannot believe they didn't think of the heat escape. 

Thing is, the amount of testing done on boxes like this is tremendous. From simulations to actual testing. The changes are mostly made to make something even better, as you're always chasing perfection, but this isn't really a design fault as much as it is mostly something you can't avoid, like dust."

These guys are top of the line hitters. They obviously could do very well and have shown it (otherwise they wouldn't be picked so high) -- why cheat?"
baseball,fexl2ep,t1_fewlrhd,1579432743.0,"It is pretty annoying tbh. I remember watching Astros getting pummeled. Then they finally come out and dominate for 2 years, getting ready for the third season. Yet, here we are. Houston teams don't really do all that well if you've kept up with the other leagues, Texans disappoint, rockets can't shake the ghost of warrior past, Astros were the shining beacon, and I genuinely liked our team -- nice group of guys that seemed happy to be playing a game, especially players like Altuve who came up from nothing. But like I said, here we are."
baseball,fexkkfh,t1_fevce2h,1579432487.0,"eh, its one of those things where you're not really sure what to say tbh. As an astros fan, I agree with most people here that say the team should be stripped of the title. I would much rather start fresh and work our way back to a championship rather than being reminded of this tainted title if we are ever to win a second one. Nobody in their right mind would even accept the second one, and the fire would burn bright again. Better to just start over.

That being said, is it really worth it for the fans to go out of their to writ and admit all that on the internet when they can just move on? I wouldn't call us pathetic for doing so -- we all have jobs and lives to worry about. Its alot more fun talking about wins / losses and you can take time to participate in the competitive spirit as its part of entertainment. But talking about cheating scandals that, while includes my team, doesn't really affect me in the long run, why would I ruin my entertainment time talking about it. I watch baseball to have fun, I come here to have fun -- cheating isn't fun, so I stay away until the leaf turns over and the dust settles, so to speak. I hope you understand"

Tinder,fexfzll,t1_fexd5kj,1579430367.0,"Yup. Don't uninstall tinder -- delete the actual profile.

Also, I'm sure you don't need this but, if you're having luck in real life, why bother with tinder if it bums you out? Most people that are semi-attractive are using it for (faster) casual sex, or for validation points. If you fit into either categories, godspeed to you, but if you are really trying to find a genuine connection, then I'd suggest not thinking too hard about the lack of quality matches. It's a numbers game sadly, and its like 100 guys to 1 girl, so even compatible girls are likely to slip through the cracks. Just my 2 cents.

Good luck either way friend :)"
Tinder,fexcniz,t1_fexa6z8,1579428721.0,"Have you tried making sure your pictures are good? Maybe that's messing you up. 

Also, keep in mind Tinder uses a point based system. So if you're down in points, you'll get matches that are also low in points. So either you rise up by good looking people swiping right on you, or you delete your profile and restart all over again, and (reset) the points. I'd suggest the latter lol

*I say points for a lack of a better term, but it's just an algorithm."
