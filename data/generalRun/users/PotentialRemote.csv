I don't think it's being too picky as over the years I've been out with all different shapes and sizes, hair colour, eye colour even skin colour and the two common denominators are that they are Scottish and that the budding relationship ended in disaster very quickly lol.

Actually there was another common denominator and that was me! Which was what made me think that it was me that was the problem and maybe it was/is it's just I found it strange that I seemed to do well with anyone who wasn't Scottish lol.

I do take your point about people being at their nicest on their travels which is very insightful actually. All I would say to that is that although some were on there travels, probably at least half were actually in their own country (often even the town they were born in) and it was me that was on my travels either with work or on holiday. So they were in their natural environment being their own person."
depression,ffk7n2u,t1_ffk5sjf,1580018290.0,"Hey man thanks a lot for your kind words, advice and offer of help....I really appreciate it :)

You make some very interesting points too as although I'm not a Doctor (far from it lol), just through experience I believe that depression is not a ""One size fits all"" condition. 

What I mean is, I think there may be different types of depression and person A's depression may not be the same as person B's and because relatively little is known about it, all these different types just get lumped in under the one umbrella and labelled ""Depression"".

That's awesome though that you have found something (i.e. exercise) that lifts your mood. It must be great knowing that, although it's not a cure, when you are at a low point or having a difficult time you have a ""go to activity"" that whilst, not being like some sort of miracle medicine like a vaccination or something that guarantees it wont return....it perhaps offers a little respite and can keep the demons away, so to speak.

Very happy for you as you seem like a thoroughly decent person. All the best and take care :)"

Yet you hear people saying having a ""clean diet"" makes folk feel so much better? Not me. It's the same as exercise. Guys like Joe ""exercise will cure your depression"" Rogan! I actually think he's a great guy to be honest but he admits he is not and has never been depressed.

In my experience if you are in a deep depression (not just feeling a little down...but legit suicidal depression) all the exercise in the world even when you can muster the strength and motivation does not help. Plus he is on steroids, HGH, all sorts of supplements, is worth tens of millions of dollars, is super successful, popular and everything he does he enjoys and gets paid handsomely for (and quite right too and he deserves it). So he knows nothing about depression!

It's just if one has never been depressed and also has all of the above going for them it's a little hard to put ones self in the position of someone who has none of the things he has and feels like eating a 9mm every morning when they wake up and realise they didn't die in their sleep :("
LongDistance,ffk37to,t3_etz8gj,1580014424.0,"I'm from the UK and first tried to get into Canada without success, then the U.S. without success. However from the information that I received in both knockbacks, there are different types of Visa's that you can get when you are under 30. IIRC none are the same as a permanent residency/citizenship and I'm sure there are time limits.

As for marriage I might be wrong but I don't think it guarantees you citizenship until maybe after you have been there for a certain period of time but may make it easier to stay for a while and perhaps gain employment or make it easier to extend the stay, get a job with an organization to sponser you which in the long run can lead to citizenship etc but to be honest I may be wrong.

From a selfish point of view when I realised I was not welcome in either country I kind of stopped taking in any of the other info as I knew I wasn't getting in. One thing is for sure even if it's not permanent being young certainly gives you more advantages so make sure you explore all avenues available.

Sorry I probably should not have commented as I havent been any help but just make sure you look into everyway possible. Don't be like me an dither as before you know it you are stuck and stranded in a country that you detest.

There was one girl who suffered from really bad depression and when she hit a low point she didnt bathe.

I remember one time I had been working away for 10 days and came back and was trying to meet up with her as we did not live together and she text back saying that she was really low and didnt want me to come down as she hadn't been in a bath in almost two weeks (I think it was 12 days IIRC) and was ashamed and embarrassed.

I knew it wasn't her fault though and went down anyway as I just wanted to make sure she was OK, had food in etc and she was a bit angry at first because, to be fair she did tell me not to come down and the fact of the matter is I did not respect her wishes so it was me that was in the wrong. It was only to make sure that she was OK though but she had every right to be angry.

She was upset and crying and I just wanted to give her a kiss and a hug and tell her everything was OK, I was there for her and this illness wasn't her fault but to be honest when I kissed and hugged her she was absolutely STINKING!!! 

I just tried to reassure her that we would get through it and she said she needed a wash so I ran her a bath and she was clean as a whistle after it.

BPDmemes,ffjensj,t3_etu6oe,1579996665.0,"I feel for you!!! I'm really lucky in that even though I have BPD (I'm sure you are familiar with the diagnostic process and criteria for being diagnosed) that, for the most part anyway, I escaped the whole self obsession, self absorbtion, disappointed that I'm not perfect and wishing like I was like everyone who posts their seemingly perfect and happy lives on Facefuck, Instaspam, Twatter etc even being an armchair psychiatrist and virtue signaller. Often, some of these things don't even have anything to do with BPD....but you often only hear about them from Narcissits and BPD sufferers, whether diagnosed officially or by themselves.

It's pretty much all of the other symtoms I present with so I really sympathise with you as it must be awful to feel that way, taking into account the modern world's obsession with Social Media, Reality TV, being perfect (even if that paradoxically means being fake i.e. fake breasts, fake teeth, dyed hair, fake relationships etc), how much money one earns, how pretty their partner is etc, etc.

If it's anything like the other symptoms it must be awful! I just wish that everyone got dealt the same hand in life. Sure some people would be a success others would not be but at least it would be fair i.e. everyone getting the same chances in life, starting from the same foundation and all that.

I hope you can find happiness or if you're anything like me you wont even be asking for happiness, just contentment ot something to strive for or work towards rather than constantly feeling the way we feel (even if our symptoms or issues may differ slightly...we still have the same condition)   :(

If you have regularly only been getting 15 hours sleep a week for a prolonged period of time then you are probably suffering from insomnia.

Generation Snowflake really does my head in. If you think this is bad? Do not ever go on the BPD forum!!!! I've been diagnosed with it and it contributes to my insomnia and had a look in that sub, mistakenly thinking I might find support, good advice etc... but with regards to that forum (not everyone but an alarming majority) I have never come across so many self absorbed, self obsessed, attention seeking, armchair psychiatrists, hypochondriacs that are also virtue signalling, validation seeking, keyboard warriors in my life!!!!

depression,ffj8kss,t1_ffeqymn,1579993018.0,"I was not expecting that last sentence TBH! I hope it was tongue in cheek. The whole reason I'm still plodding on is because my mother is a really, really great person. I know a lot of people think that about their mother but nobody has a bad word to say about mine and I have to concur.

It's just for some reason, she thinks the world of me and her only flaw (and it's not really a flaw as such) is that she is not a very strong person. This has not caused her any issues though because she bothers nobody and therefore nobody has ever tested her strength. But I know her better than anyone.

Due to this I know that because she is such a nice person, has such a great heart and nobody has caused her any true hurt because of these attributes... she is not used to having to deal with traumatic events.

She has worked hard all her days and recently retired and if I Iced myself it would basically ruin her life. I'm not like her, I'm not anywhere near as nice so in my mind I wish she would realise this, but because she is so nice she does not really see the badness in people only the good.

I just feel that she is at the stage of her life where she has done all the hard work and should now put her feet up and enjoy the rest of her life. She was basically a slave to the system for 40 years and never once complained. So I can't check out until she passes away.

However if my mother was your mother.....i.e. encouraging me to Ice myself, then I would have no issue whatsoever with putting a 12g under my chin. I wouldn't even be writing this as I would be in the ground (minus my head).

You must have other reasons rather than your mother for still being here. I just encourage you to keep focusing on those things and to have goals and objectives to keep you going. Good luck and I wish you all the best :)"

It's just some people come on here and other forums because they have nobody else to talk to or are at their wits end. They come on looking for help, support and some compassion from people who are ostensibly in the same boat as them. Only to be brought down even lower than they already were by someone looking to make themselves feel better, try their hand at being an amateur clairvoyant (and usually falling far short!) or looking to have their back slapped and be given an ""addaboy"" even if it is at the expense of a vulnerable, fragile person who was just looking for someone to talk to, run something by or to ask for some advice.

BPDmemes,ffdzkeq,t1_ffcwa93,1579832864.0,"IDK if any of us ""deserve"" anything, in terms of a happy ending? Sometimes you get what you put in and reap what you sow.

Other times I've seen perfectly lovely people be absolutely shafted.

I just feel that (not saying im right) part of the problem with people these days is that many us feel ""entitled"" i.e. that life owes us something.

It's almost like they take pleasure in slapping someone down for having the gumption to have a different opinion...a different opinion on matters that are totally subjective. It's like they take pleasure in bringing people down in the hope it garners them some attention or in a perverse way makes them feel better about themselves.

They often think they know everything and when you admit that you are confused about an aspect of the condition they profess to be mind readers and tell you what you are thinking and feeling when we know that, if they genuinely have the condition...the chances are that they dont even know what THEY THEMSELVES are thinking and feeling never mind a total stranger that they have never and will never meet.

It could possibly even be approaching 100 years (please no!!!) before I die and I did not even want to be born but had no choice. Therefore surely if I did not get a choice about being born into the world I should at least get a choice about checking out?

Especially if they think it will get them upvoted or a pat on the back from other members.

It seems that they are so insecure themselves but because they know they don't have to actually face people in person and say what they type here to the persons face that they think it gives them carte blanche to be as nasty as they want from behind the safety of their computer.

I actually feel sorry for some of these people. I imagine them being the person in movies that when they are scared i.e. have to face someone, you see a stream of yellow liquid running out one of their trouser legs as they dont have their computer screen to protect them anymore.

When I'm in company, I'm OK for an hour max then I get anxious. Not only anxious but I find that most people I end up with (i.e. in their company) are actually more lost than me.

Part of the reason is that, in my experience at least, the vast majority of people I come into contact with seem unable to think for themselves, be their own person etc. They even come out with comments that when you go over in your head what they have just said, you realise it doesnt really compute or make any sense? So you press them for more info on what they said. 

More often than not it turns out that there is no more information, because what they claimed to be their opinion, isnt really their opinion, it's the opinion of someone else that they have heard or read somewhere. They have just regurgitated it to you or the company you are in because they thought it sounded good. In all honesty...half the time they dont even understand the very thing they are regurgitating!

Anyway, I'm probably nobody to be taking advice from as I have no desire to be in the company of people for any length of time but for what it's worth....I would think that the only way you can get over your isolation and loneliness is to try an take steps to immerse yourself in the company of people. Immerse is probably the wrong word as it would maybe be best to take baby steps.

However my loss can be your gain as some of the situations when I've found myself in the company of people (which makes me very uncomfortable but seems to be, for reasons I don't pretend to undertand, what you crave) is when you find an activity that you like which then becomes a hobby. It can be the gym, martial arts, sailing, art, languages, football team, even going to sports matches....anything really that involves a group of people being together and allows for someone new to enter the fold and try it and if they like it to keep attending. This is how I have met most of the people I have ever known. It was different for me as I had no desire to hang out with them as I dont really like people to be honest and being in their company was a necessary evil that was required for me to take part in the aforementioned activites.

Im not good at explaining things and have always had poor communication skills but im going to try anyway so here goes nothing:

We are not perfect and we know this right? We make mistakes too dont we? We are only human after all? Perhaps we make more mistakes than others? Or maybe we are just more sensitive?

However, despite all our flaws and this condition (BPD) and without trying to be ""that guy"" whose life philosophy is ""it's always someone else's fault!"". Sometimes we have to remember that people are just being people. What I mean is, most people are just out for themselves and their whole reason for living is to attain The BBD....(The Bigger Better Deal).

So what if the only thing changed in our lives (and the OP's life) was that we suddenly became rich, and/or gained a respected position in society....apart from these new found attributes we are exactly the same people? We would no doubt find that people who ignore us, have no time for us or abandon us SUDDENLY make us a priority in their life?

What has changed? Apart from the two things mentioned nothing has changed! It's just that these two additions to our lives have made us more desirable....even though we are the same person! So despite us still being the same person....the people who previously would not have pissed on us if we were on fire have now made us their number one priority.

I ask....who then is the real loser? I'm thinking more and more that if someone is only with someone for what they can provide them. Whether it be material things, money, their friends admiring them for being with a so called successful person etc......then to be honest I'd rather they just ignored me and treated me like a loser they way they would have if I wasn't successful as they are basically shallow people out for what they can get.

FACTS....information that is irrefutable. NOT information that you have taken, added arms and legs on to and then further still, drawn your own conclusions from what is now non factual information. In short....what you have done with regards to my life and employment history!

2) Unfortunately I have been unemployed more times than I care to remember.

I don't need to ""Try"" the things that you TELL me to try (again)...I've alreadt lived it! It SEEMS you may have too. I use the word ""seems"" because I have never met you and know nothing about you so it would be ridiculous of me to have the audacity to think that I know anything about your life, your experiences or how you have lived or jump to the conclusions about you that you have jumped to with regards to me, my life experiences, the type of person I am and everything else that you were completely wrong about in terms of me and my life. (not necessarily the benefits system). That was something that you actually got correct (go you!!)...well mostly correct.

The only thing you are wrong about (with regards to the benefits system that is....as your were wrong about EVERYTHING in terms of the conclusions you jumped to about the history of a stranger on the internet) is your ludicrous statement that being on benefits in the UK is ""Probably the most miserable existence you can find in the EU"". 

It is certainly not nice, again if you show where I said it was pleasant then I will apologise, however you have pretty much alluded to it being one of the worst....in fact you said ""Probably the most miserable existence you could find in the EU"" Some would take that as being the worst in the EU?

But to tell someone to ""Get their facts straight"" then come out with a lot of completely inaccurate guesswork about someones (a stranger no less!) life history, experiences, circumstances etc which turned out to be completely wrong, and then to make a grossly inaccurate statement with regards to the UK benefits system's standing within the EU. It just seems somewhat embarrassing.

And to think all that came out of someone saying that they welcome people into the country who are here to work or genuinely fleeing persecution if our island is the nearest safe haven. The mind boggles!"

depression,ffb6odx,t3_esnpei,1579753238.0,"It's a very strange feeling. I have often, and even to an extent always, felt suicidal ever since I was early teens. However the only way I can describe it is.....if you have ever looked at a diving pool and the diving boards and the way it is set up? For example two low springboards, then above them two higher springboards. Then above those a platform, then above that another platform...then a large gap and the very top platform, the highest one.

When you look up at this highest platform from the pool then sure, it does look pretty high and you think ""I'm going to dive off that!"" So you climb up the stairs to the top platform and as you look down it suddenly looks about five times higher than it did from the pool :O 

However you know that despite some nagging doubts you know that you just have to give yourself that little push and you know you can do it. This is how I always felt about ending my life. I knew I could do it and often thought about it but knew id just have to give myself that little extra push to do it. 

Obviously (as im still here) I didnt but only because I didnt want to hurt certain people. But what really freaked me out was in the midst of one bout of a really severe depression....instead of having to give myself that little nudge to do it....it felt like the easiest most natural thing in the world to just end it and I hadn't ever felt like that before.

This time, instead of having to give myself that little push to do it I was actually having to haul myself back from actually going full pelt and doing it! I had never felt THAT suicidal before and it really kind of freaked me out!"

It seems like you leaving that job and moving away isnt the cause (although again I have to emphasise I have no medical training etc) as you would think that you wouldn't have been sleeping fairly soundly just after these ""changes"" if they were the underlying issue.

Also, the fact that you have an understanding Doctor is great as , for various reasons, they are hard to find (often not their fault).

To answer your questions I started realising I didnt sleep the way normal people slept at about roughly 12 or 13. Id have to get up at 0730 for school and find myself still lying awake at 2 and 3am normally but sometimes 4 and 5 am :(  I hated sleepovers as everyone else would be asleep before midnight and id be lying there still awake when the birds started chirping and light started creeping in through the windows.

It has been particularly bad the past 5-7 years though thats when it consistantly got down to no more than 3-4 hours per night and sometimes nothing for 3 straight nights. I wouldnt mind so much if it was 3 unbroken hours but it is say falling asleep at 0330....waken up at 0415, then back to sleep about 0430....waken again at say 0520,,,,back to sleep at 0540...wake 0600....back to sleep 0610....up for the day at 0630 so any sleep is always broken and not enough of it (all rough figures obviously). It was so bad that when I started seeing my ex girfriend she was convinced I was a ""Speed Freak"" and thats why i couldnt sleep lol.

On the positive side, so far your sleep issues seem to be a temporary thing i.e. the last month or so. Therefore if your Doctor can rule out any conditions then it could possibly be something as simple as your body clock being somehow knocked out of sync and then the fact that this has caused you to be not sleeping well, which as we know is horrible.....then a period of not sleeping can make you more anxious so that you are going to bed feeling anxious and that is causing you not to sleep.....i.e. insomnia causing anxiousness and then the anxiousness causing insomnia...the proverbial vicious circle!

So....I know you probably wouldnt want them but your doctor may give you a short script of sleeping pills....something like Zopiclone or maybe even antihistimines which can cause drowsiness but either way a 7-14 day script to help you sleep and just get you into a routine again. Doctors dont like to prescribe sleep meds long term but you may not need that anyway. A little script of 7-14 days may be all that is required to get your body back to normal and into a routine.

Either way if it keeps up just speak to your doc again and together you can both decide what the next step is. :)"
BorderlinePDisorder,ffarzj8,t3_eskl5w,1579743115.0,"I thought I didn't have abandonment issues as I always did whatever I could to avoid people. I just don't like people and would rather be alone so thought that this aspect of the condition (fear of abandonment) did not apply to me.

However then I was told that the reason I don't like people, push them away and in general would just like as little to do with people as possible is because subconciously I DO fear abandonment but instead of being clingy and holding onto peoples legs begging them not to leave me......i deal with it a different way. Apparently I just avoid them and have as little to do with them as is humanly possible as deep down I equate this to ""No people in my life = it's impossible to be abandoned""

I'm still not even sure if this is accurate but I guess we all have to be open to new ideas and theories right?

Especially if in the past they have agreed with said person on many topics it may just be part of the whole BPD condition i.e. idealization turning into hatred, being petrified that someone that they felt was on their team or in their clique may abandon them, be scared that somone may be trying to fill their own personal emptiness even if filling it may just be trying to take on board a different way of looking at things and therefore feel something..anything.

Im sorry I had to put that disclaimer in there it's just these forums can be EXTREMELY touchy places with people even judging someone, ridiculing them, demeaning them etc (often just to make themselves feel better/validated) or for a pat on the back or a ""well done"" from someone equally as lost and nasty and trying to make themselves feel better but unfortunately at someone weaker's expense!) just on the basis of how THEY interpreted the written word (and usually misinterpreted it at that!) Just wanted to say I mean no offence in what I am about to say....only trying to help!!! The fact that this is necessary is ludicrous in itself especially when the vast majority of members are like ourselves just people seeking information, advice on trying to help ourselves and if we can....help others. Anyway.....to get to the point....

OP you are not alone. There are many of us who basically use any means that we can to make ourselves feel better, more comfortable and more at ease with life. Sometimes I think it is also why people with debilitating conditions...e.g. Depression often like to sleep as much as possible. As similar to what you mention, being asleep is like an escape from reality and an escape from real life. Just like what you allude to in terms of daydreaming. When you are daydreaming, no matter how short you aren't dealing with life, the same as when someone is asleep. Even if it is an unpleasant dream it can still be better then reality.

The only thing I would say (again only advice and not trying to tell you what to do or be negative in anyway before anyone jumps in). I'd just say try and keep a handle on the situation as what has happened to me before is that I eventually had trouble distinguishing between what was real and what was not. Apart from hearing people calling on me from inside the house and outside on the street. I had delusions that I had met a certain person and discussed a particular subject and even had a joke with them.

However about a week or so later I met the person again and reminded them of the laugh we had only for him to tell me that this meeting (the one im now describing) was the first time he had met me in months. So I had invented the whole previous meeting in my head, yet it felt so real!

Other examples are when I believed a friend had introduced me to their friend....and then another aquaintence introduced me to the same person (I had met them twice now so that was someone new that I met through two people I already knew). Then I found out that this ""new"" person didnt exist and was a figment of my imagination!

So what I am trying to say is that it's fine and often a welcome relief to escape reality through daydreaming and actual dreaming, it's just if it gets to the stage where you can't tell the difference between the daydreams, the sleepy dreams and real life then it might be worth letting someone know.

It hopefully wont come to that though I just dont want you to go through the same thing as me as it can be quite unsettling. Take care anyway and all the best :)"

I'm going to be honest with you....the more you think about it, the more of a problem it becomes. It get's in your bones! You worry about not sleeping therefore you don't sleep!

But it's like anything else.....when someone tells you to ignore something or to not think about it....it then proceeds  to consume your every waking (pardon the pun) thought :(

I often don't sleep for 3 days at a time. It's totally debilitating and when you mention the fatal insomnia??? Trust me.......when you suffer from SEVERE insomnia you actually hope that you DO get fatal insomnia and then it's finally over!! You go for ""The big sleep"" i.e. the permanent one and your troubles are over. I take comfort from the fact that severe insomnia over prolonged period knocks YEARS sometimes over a decade off your life expectancy which is the only positive thing about it for me as the quality of life that one has with no sleep is zero anyway so I may as well be dead :(

My advice is, if it keeps going on that is (everyone has trouble sleeping now and again) to go to your doctor. It's possible that you have developed sleep apnoea. I am obviously not a doctor and have no medical expertise but if it doesnt go away they can send you for a sleep study. Sometimes it's done in the house sometimes at a facility but it basically monitors your sleep and can tell if you are suffering from something like sleep apnoea. There are treatments etc available for this that will have you right as rain, and doing a decent Darth Vader impression (if it comes to it you will then understand what i mean lol).

For example (bearing in mind you are still young enough to get a trade or even some qualifications behind you before the big move.....i.e. a couple of years of working towards these may set you up for the rest of your life in Scotland/UK....short term sacrifice for long term gain and all that).

Ironically this was not far from the truth. For example if someone was an EU citizen then, even if they had absolutely nothing to contribute....had never worked a day in their lives and had no intention of ever working a day in their lives, they had every right to come here with their wife and kids and live off benefits. Which, in most cases (althout not all) meant they were ""being paid"" by a more generous benefits system than in their own country.

It's a fact that before the UK voted to leave the EU (this may still be in place until we actually do leave, im honestly not sure) that people from other EU countries could come here and not only claim benefits for themselves while they are living here...but also for their family who often were not even in the country???? I mean WTF?

It works both ways though (to an extent) for example British people were entitled to move to any other EU country. Therefore it's understandable if people on the other side of the Atlantic Ocean just assumed the UK lets anyone in as that is certainly the way it looks from the outside looking in.

You also have people who claimed political asylum. This was supposed to be to grant people who were fleeing persecution a safe haven. Yeah the NEAREST safe haven. What really happend was that you had people passing through about 7 different countries in a desperate attempt to get to the UK.....an Island!!! Because they knew they would get a house and benefits.

I actually have no problem with people wanting to make a better life for themselves and their families as long as they are coming here to work and pay their tax like the rest of us. 

Some people have issues, thinking that Eastern European's etc are ""taking our jobs"" but in my experience most of the time these people end up being the hardest workers I have ever worked with and often even up doing jobs that Brits deem beneath them. I don't care where someone is from or what they are doing, if they are working hard then thats good enough for me. So IMO EU citizens, American's, Canadians etc are welcome as long as they are here to work and not to sponge off the tax payer.

I just cannot fathom why American's, Canadian etc would want to leave their own country and come here? As I say as long as it is to work then I welcome them but it would be great if Brits could go to the US, Canada etc too but it seems even harder for us to get into North America than for U.S. and Canadian citizens to get in here.

I would actually have no problem and indeed be grateful if the U.S. and Canada just gave us a chance....like a time limit to get  job, start a business and be able to provide for ourselves (say 1 year?) and if we proved unable to do so then we couldnt really complain if they sent us home....at least they gave us a chance?

I feel the same with people coming into the UK. I dont care where they are from I feel they should be allowed a chance to come here and provide for themselves as long its not just to rape the UK taxpayer (why the hell they would want to come here is beyond me) but if that's what they want I would be more than happy to give them the chance as long as we Brits got the chance in their respective countries too."

Some people are just plain nasty and it can be worse when they are in groups (packs). This is how people used to sometimes end up ostracized from society, just for being different.

When you have mental issues, sometimes you have thoughts or opinions that others may not agree with. Hell, even people with no mental issues often have a stance on a subject(s) that may not be the norm or which cause them to be in the minority

However when someone has mental problems it can sometimes be vitally important to their wellbeing to try and see the good in people and, even if you disagree with someone, it costs nothing to try and see where they are coming from or try and understand their stance or what has caused them to have this stance/form their opinion even if you disagree completely.

It can really bring someone down even further when people act like a pack of wolves in terms of attacking someone just because you dont share their views/opinions or perhaps even understand what they are feeling or why.

Humans can often be insecure creatures but when I see people try and make themselves feel better by bringing someone else down...often just to feel validated or receive a pat on the back from others it can be really disheartening. Especially when they make no attempt to understand why a person has formed their opinion as they often have valid reasons/experiences that have caused them to feel the way they do.

I guess it is addictive for people who are narrow minded, especially if being nasty to someone or ridiculing them garners attention. It can almost be akin to people posting certain things on social media, things that they themselves may not even believe, in order to receive the maximum amount of ""likes"". Resulting in them feeling better about themselves. No matter if this self satisfaction is a result of tearing someone else down.

Humans are often guilty of fearing what they don't understand. I just think it would be better if rather than trying to destroy something we dont understand or agree with we try and see things from someone elses point of view as it is often ones experiences that causes them to see things the way they do.

There is too much ""I dont agree with you or share your opinion.....therefore you are wrong...so go away"" IMO we should all try and be a little more tolerant and accept that not everyone sees things the same and even agree to disagree rather than just be nasty to folks that we dont understand."

Unfortunately this condition can promote a lot of negativity and when it would be perhaps more beneficial and postive to sit back, take stock and utilise some time to reflect on things that we maybe don't fully understand or perhaps we DO understand (or at least think that we do!) but on first thought whole heartedly disagree with.....it can sometimes do us the world of good to just pause and think about a particular scenario, notion or opinion and where it may have come from or what has happened to cause one to form said stance/viewpoint?

This ""time-out"" so to speak can often be far more positive than reacting like the proverbial pack of hyenas and just attack attack attack, often in order to gain the validation of the rest of the pack.

We can often make more mistakes that so called ""normal"" people but we can also actually be very caring, helpful and understanding people as well because we are acutely aware of just how difficult life can be at times.

I also don't mean to be pessemistic either or the proverbial ""Profit of Doom""...but what I have found is that although sometimes fellow sufferers can be the best people to confide in or go to for advice....because they know what we are going through.....some of the biggest mistakes that I have made has been confiding in or trying to help someone else with BPD.

To explain entirely I'd be here forever and the reasons why others with BPD can sometimes be the worst people to go to for help is due to the very symptoms of the condition (BPD) itself.

I've had experiences where someone else with BPD has had a particular problem....a problem that I myself have had at least one (often several) experiences with, therefore I've been qualified to speak regarding this issue, particularly if the scenario in question is the first time that the person has ever had to deal with this type of issue or problem and you are trying to help them.

However because my explanation of how I dealt with the situation, which may or may not have been the best way, does not fit in with how they have dealt with it or are considering dealing with it....then unfortunately all Hell can break loose.

It can be as a result of perceived criticism of them or the person that they are idealising, it can be pointing out risky behaviour, it can be indicating that they may be experiencing disturbed patterns of thinking even offering advice in order to try to help the sufferer can be taken as you being about to abandon them. However one of the most destructive aspects that is not necessarily even one of the recognised symptoms is what i refer to as ""Craving validation/acceptance"".

For instance someone who is going through a bad time of it can actually turn almost Exorcist like evil on you when you explain that you have been in the same situation and, without telling them what to do....explain that you have been in the same situation and that the way they are reacting/dealing with it is likely to make things worse.

They can go ballistic....not even because they believe what they are saying is true, correct or factual (they often know deep down that it is not)...but because  they think it will garner them attention (even if it is negative) or get them the proverbial ""pat on the back"" or ""Addaboy"". It's not unlike someone posting something on Facebook that they know absolutely nothing about, or posting something that they do not even believe.....but they have posted it simply because they know (or think) it will mean they receive the maximum amount of ""likes"".

As an extreme example it would be akin to a Nazi sympathiser posting about how great Oskar Shindler was.

Therefore sometimes this is why BPD sufferers get a reputation for being difficult to deal with, awkward or sometimes just downright nasty. We are not all like this and even those who are are not like that all the time. This nastiness can also occur when someone with BPD has flipped around from idealising something/someone and therefore only ever saying or doing perceived positive things in order to remain or get into the persons good graces.....to the opposite when they transfer to hating everything about them and just turning on the person themselves is not enough...they need to do or say something to get others to join in making the person (who originally tried to help) feel as bad as possible and have ""The Wolfpack"" turn on that person and maul them because they themselves feel they cannot inflict enough damage on their own. They need others to join in and then there is that validation where they can all congratulate each other.

Sorry for such a long post but it's just such a complex condition that even at our worst...and no matter how bad or vindictive we look or seem we are often actually good, caring people deep down who just find life more of a struggle than others.

Not all of them, but most of them have admitted that, although they really love their kids (and I totally believe them as they always provide for them and put them first) they also admit that if they had their time over again, they would have remained child free.

In relation to your situation, at least you have taken responsibility for your actions/situation. There are plenty of people who make, what in my opinion, is the biggest commitment a human can make and that is bring another human into the world....then realise they have made a mistake and bail out! Which can result in a child ending up in care, never seeing their parents etc. You have at least stepped up and taken responsibility for your actions and you are also a very honest person.

What I mean is....to this day....I have NEVER met a woman who does not lie!!! Especially when it comes to the reasons for a breakup.

Again I'm not saying this is accurate in your situation but anytime I have witnessed a relationship breakdown then the woman will give a spiel of all the different reasons why she is not happy.....there are usually many i.e. we were too young when we met, we have grown apart, we want different things now...then there are the ""unsaid"" things like when they go on Social Media and/or watch Reality TV and see that others post pictures of their seemingly perfect lives (which of course are NOT perfect) or see Kim Kardashian with expensive gifts etc....then your wife decides ""I want that.....I DESERVE that!""...next thing not only are you served with divorce papers....but you are paying for HER lawyer as well as your own!!!!

Then when everything is said and done....the REAL reason comes out and there is suddenly a guy who has miraculously appeared out of nowhere, living in the house you have paid for and perhaps even driving the cars that you paid for!!!

What's more.... In my opinion/experience....it would be best if you don't get involved with anyone else until you have got a bit more of a handle on your issues at least.

This may sound harsh but if you take into account that I have experienced all of the above and believe it or not....(to a lesser or greater extent.....from both sides and both angles) I actually know what I'm talking about!

Although guys often get a bad press there are actually some guys out there who will stick by a woman no matter what! No matter how badly they are treated, verbally, physically etc they see it as their duty to stand by their woman/wife. I've seen this happen with awful consequences the least of which has seen the guys life effectively pass him by and by the time he is finally told the truth and where he stands hes been through so much, is too old etc that basically nobody wants him now. Thats the price he paid for honesty and loyalty but he got neither back!

If you love him sit him down and tell him...if you do love him he should already be aware of your issues and if he loves you he will stand by you. But please don't just use him as a doormat or a punching bag or someone to take your anger, issues or frustrations out on.

If you guys both love each other though then you will be honest with each other and both be prepared to sit down and always talk any and every issue over and come to an agreement or compromise that suits you both.

Don't know if you remember the days when someone with BPD had their appointments cancelled so that the therapist could deal with the 20 kids that apparently had ADD....which then became ADHD.....then they started handing out Amphetemines etc, etc , etc we had our appointments cancelled because the condition was said to be incurable an to an extent untreatable. What they really meant was that....the condition does not have the same potential to label people and then extract copious amount of money out of them so that you can be labelled a competent parent.

Whereas when a child is born to two people who have no time for the kid, work 60-70 hours a week (yet thought it was a great idea to become parents?) have no real parenting skills, thought that they would be procreating the next Einstein etc....the answer is ""Even though you spend 10 hours a week with the child, you are perfect parents.....it's not your fault......lets pump this poor side effect of sex full of speed and see if that works!!!

I'm just about to send out a group email to them to basically BEG them to ask if they would be kind enough to let me escape Scotland!!!!

I just cannot stay here anymore. Im such a Scottish embarrassment to the world though that I don't even know how much money I would need to be able to give them to allow me to stay for a week?

After a week I totally understand my rent money will have been used up and they can kick me out and im on my own. Obviously I wouldnt expect the rent to include food etc. This is more than fair! It will likely be my cousin in Tenerife who lets me stay, is 450 Euros enough for a week in a studio apartment do you think? Its just the one room really where there is a kitchen, a sort of little lounge area (very small) and the bed is in the same room? Although to be fair there is a small balcony.

After that week i will have to find somewhere else and thats fine. I saw those pop up tents for 30 Euros.....i'd rather live in a pop up tent in Tenerife than live in a 5 bed detached villa in Scotland :(

The only other thing I was worried about is, if I died in a foreign country....would they try and track down my relatives and try and make them foot the bill? I have one of those EC cards and was kind of hoping that if I turned up dead somewhere abroad (in the EU) it would cover any costs for having to be cremated or planted? Just as long as they dont try and track down relatives and scam them for costs that have really nothing to do with them? It's just with all this Brexit shite etc I don't really know what's what with regards to funerals?

But if your brain and how it operates is fundamentally damaged then it does not matter a jot how you think about things or how postitive/negative you are, if you have molehill thinking etc....none of this matters really!

Imagine buying or downloading the latest all new and all singing and all dancing PC game.....only to realise that you dont have enough RAM...and/or your Graphics Card or processor is 3 years out of date.... or even your hard drive does not have the required capability or capacity.....this is what trying to cope with life is like for some people. They are actually unable to cope/proceed with life due to having what is essentially brain damage!

It's not always that people go on social media and see Kim Kardashian in a Ferrari and wish they had it, realise that they dont and therefore feel a bit pissed off! See that their friend has lost some weight, bought a new bikini and timed their pictures so that they looked better than you and feel a bit jealous and therefore declare themselves ""depressed"".

These type of things can be helped with CBT/DBT......but when your brain is fundamentally damanged and does not work properly......every day feels like a fight to the death just to stay alive because you know that, although your parents are in fact responsible for the torture that you are living...they didnt mean it....and they are actually good people.....and finding you with a 12g shotgun under your chin.....having just created a Jackson Pollock on the white wall behind you with your blood, skull and brain matter.....that is a different matter entirely!

For example just to escape I'd love to buy a plot of land in the wilderness, build a cabin or even stick a caravan or something on it and just be self sufficient. Most importantly I would bother nobody!

However you cannot even do that. Even if you buy the land, which in itself is made as difficult as possible..you then need plnning permission... they say you cant build on it, live on it or probably both! You think well ""Why?"" it's a plot of land in the wilderness that has been sitting doing nothing since the dawn of time and will continue to do nothing? There is no trees on it that I would be destroying? No running water, gas or electricity so I wouldnt be causing any damage that way. I would grow some food so more plant life = more oxygen = better for the environment etc?

However everywhere you look the powers that be have put obstacles in your path to make it as difficult as can be, if not impossible to escape mainstream society. Whereas if it was possible to build the cabin and live there I wouldn't even need to work and would actually have a shot at being happy. But rather than let someone do this they would rather we stay part of the system even though it makes us deeply depressed and to be frank, I'd rather be dead than just exist like this forever and be a slave for the rest of my life, wasting it by working, and any money I do make is just going straight back out on tax, insurance, utility bills, food, fuel, transport etc :("

Anyone who listens to podcasts has probably listened to or at least heard of The Joe Rogan Experience. Now he seems like a genuinely nice guy and he is super successful at EVERYTHING he does. Personally I really like his podcast and think he is also a good role model (for the most part) even though im pretty sure he doesnt see himself as a rolemodel or sets out to be one...how can you not admire a guy who is worth tens of millions of dollars and enjoys everything he does for a living as well as his hobbies and makes an absolute fortune?

However he also freely admits to having never suffered from depression. He often (i.e. almost every episode) talks about how much he works out and how much he loves it and he often advocates that people who suffer from depression should excercise.

Now I don't think there is anything wrong with this but the key points is that he doesnt suffer from depression and he is also on a thing called TRT which is basically getting steroids from his doctor. He is also on HGH (Human Growth Hormone). It's is widely known that both testosterone and HGH have a positive effect on someones mood. He also partly owns a supplements company and freely admits to taking massive amounts of these supplements and vitamins too.

Thats the only thing that sometimes annoys me about him is that he often kind of makes out that people who are depressed, simply have to go to the gym, go for a run or a bike ride or whatever and that will basically cure their depression. Omitting the fact he is not prone to depression and also on TRT, HGH, all the vitamins under the sun, loves everything he does, makes a massive amount of money and even gets paid for his hobbies therefore it kind of stands to reason that he may not be depressed for these reasons rather than because he works out?

Therefore advocating exercise as a cure for depression is just too simplistic (unfortunately). For example ive been so depressed that I could barely summon the energy to get out of bed to go to the bathroom! With all the will in the world it was just not physically possible for me to work out! Even if i managed to crawl along the floor to a barbell...I would not have been able to get the thing off the ground and would possibly have even injured myself.

So (sorry for such a long post BTW) it is correct that excercise can make someone feel better. If someone who is slightly depressed can muster the energy then I would definitely recommend some sort of excercise. But unfortunately it is not a cure and it is sometimes not even possible to excercise if you are having a major depressive episode. Sorry for rambling but I just get annoyed when someone who has never actually experienced a condition makes out that exercising can cure it."

I mean these things are just simply not true and as a result of being lied to their whole life there are  lot of people out there who just feel really disillusioned, disappointed, difficulty trusting as a result of the lies and also feel like a bit of a let down, a loser, a failure etc because they aren't where they hoped or expected to be in their life.

depression,ff0jkd4,t3_eqzk3k,1579469478.0,"I feel exactly the same. It was one of the things that made me into an Athiest as well. I definitely think there should be some sort of euthanasia but that nobody gets hurt in the process in terms of sadness or grief.

You just get put to sleep for good but everyone understands that your suffering is over and instead of feeling sadness or grief, your relatives feel what you would feel, just absolute relief that the suffering is over."
depression,ff00874,t1_fezxlu0,1579463733.0,"It would be so awesome, like a real life Rip Van Winkle lol. It would be amazing to just sleep until we were say 50, then wake up, see if we felt any better about life and if not.....back to sleepy times for another 15 or 20 years :)"
BPD,fezyfxl,t3_eqyhd0,1579463258.0,"Hey there, as has been mentioned, don't stress about it. I don't mean to sound like I am getting all high and mighty on your or talking down to you or patrionizing you because of your age, but you are still really young :)

You have all the time in the world and what's more, you sound as if you have your head screwed on and are intelligent. We often assume that everyone else is doing better than us, ahead of us or happier than us.

Im not one of those people who blame social media for everything but it can be very misleading and give people an unrealistic view of life. For example a couple may post a picture of themselves looking all loved up and happy, then two minutes later they may have had a blazing row. We won't hear about the fight or what caused it or we wont know what goes on behind closed doors, we only see what they want us to see and I think a lot of things in life are like that which sort of relates to you perhaps feeling left behind and as if things are passing you by.

Trust me, when you have a boyfriend you will look back to around this time and wonder why you wasted time worrying or stressing about it. Good luck with everything anyway :) Take care."
depression,fezwkp4,t3_eqxc9u,1579462598.0,"I love it too! Unfortunately I suffer from severe insomnia so when it is really bad I can be awake for 3 days :(

However I can totally relate that sleep is like an escape from reality, a welcome escape! I often watch the movie Highlander: Endgame. It's not the best of movies but there is a place called ""The Sanctuary"" where the Immortals go and are hooked up to something that allows thenm to sleep for what could be years at a time.

Sheer bliss lol."
BPD,fezuki6,t3_eqv250,1579461847.0,"This happens to me as well, or things that are very similar to what you describe. I often have dreams or imaginary visions but (possibly due to severe insomnia) I often have trouble distinguishing between reality and what I have dreamed or imagined.

It's even got so bad that I have perhaps met someone I know who then introduces me to someone that they know but that I have never met until now. So in my head, I have met this new person and it feels so real and then it turns out that this ""friend of a friend"" doesn't actually even exist! I must have either dreamed about it or somehow just imagined it.

This has happened a few times and the imaginary person even had a name and a background. I've also thought that i've bumped into someone I know, say a week ago, and we had a chat about a particular subject. Then I meet them again and remind them of what we talked about last week and then they inform me that this is the first time we have spoken in months. Yet to me, it felt so real?

 It's actually really unsettling as I literally cannot trust what is real and what is not real and what genuinely has occurred and what has just been in my head. So I kinda know what you are talking about."
BPD,fezog53,t3_eqw37o,1579459671.0,"I feel for you and hope you are OK! It's so strange these days as, a couple of generations ago it was quite unusal for a male and a female to be ""friends"". So it can sometimes get a bit confusing. Part of the problem is that, for some unknown reason, everyone seems to have some issue with being unable to tell the truth? I honestly cannot fathom what is so difficult about being honest? In fact it usually less stressful as you don't need to worry about keeping track of lies you have told and to whom.

So now it's hard to know if someone is genuinely your friend, if they want more or if you want more...if this is possible/an option.

The worst one is this thing I got told about called ""The Friendzone"". It's the most horrible, humiliating lie that a girl can tell a guy. Even though they often do it to let you down gently.....just having someone you care about stand there and lie to you....just lie to your face like that telling you that ""Because we are such great friends, I don't want to ruin it..."" 

Then you think about it and realise that, they dont know where you live, you dont know where they live, you have never been to each others house, you have never spent any meaningful time together that friends automatically would do, you have never even had a conversation on the phone....yet you are such GREAT friends? It's so humiliating and embarrassing when they could just be honest with you and say that you arent their type, they have a partner, they arent looking or they think that they can do better or are waiting on a better offer etc. 

Just to strange that nobody seem to be able to tell the truth, it's sort of fascinating in a morbid way. So I hope you feel a bit better soon and try and remember that it's not just you and most of all you have done nothing wrong. All you did was get intimate with a guy that you were attracted to (who may or may not be an actual real friend). Hope you find someone who can reciprocate with you and take care! (At least you didn't get Friendzoned eeeeeeewwwkkk)."
BorderlinePDisorder,feweqyg,t3_eqh607,1579409370.0,"I don't care what you said or how you were feeling, we all make mistakes and we all have outbursts. It's part of what makes us human!

 Also don't know who the person is in the pic or if it is just capturing a random person in a less than pefect moment but she is beautful! Reminds me of a girl i knew in the past. Thanks for posting."
depression,femexam,t3_epxpfw,1579251936.0,"Unfortunately it seems to be something that folks cant understand unless they experience it. I remember I couldnt understand it all, would think...""What the hell do they have to be depressed about?"" I just couldnt fathom it.....then it happened to me :(

I've often heard people say ""The worst thing you can say to a depressed person is get a grip or pull yourself together"". I totally understand where they are coming from as they dont want the depressed person to feel worse but I look on it a different way now.

When someone says the above to me I actually feel happy for them as for someone to say such a thing instantly tells me they have never been depressed which is obviously a good thing. I would not wish it on anyone.

To try and have your mum understand it the only thing I can think of is to show her the symptoms from a respected medical website. Sometimes when people from ""the old school"" so to speak see something in black and white that has come from a respected medical professional or body then and only then will they take it as gospel and understand that it is an illness. A bloody horrible one at that. Good luck and take care :)"
childfree,feme9pp,t1_femda7m,1579250990.0,"Exactly. I'm not saying that parents should not have a life, but at the same time....whatever someones reason for having kids i.e. they wanted to be a parent all their life or more likely in my experience they had them because ""everyone else is doing it so I have to as well"". Jeez some people even look upon kids as a fashion accessory or some do it because they wont have to work and/or will move up the pecking order for social housing etc.

Whatever the reason, when you choose to create another human being without their consent, sacrifices have to be made and that includes not ruining the happyness of others who didnt make the same choices/mistakes as you. Not everone wants kids around them and those that dont should be entitled to enjoy their leisure time without having it ruined just because of the mistakes or choices of people who bred."
depression,femdxcs,t3_epqmgb,1579250507.0,"Thanks for posting this. It means a lot to people like me. So strange that you mention things like getting out of bed, brushing our teeth, even showering. Whoever thought that these things that ""normal"" folks do without even thinking about it can be soooo difficult.

I mean just trying to get up in the morning, brushing my teeth, keeping up with basic personal hygiene...it shouldnt be difficult but it is. I've had times when I really STANK!!!!!

Its nice to know im not alone and that people like you care and post to try and motivate the rest of us. Thank you so much and have a great day :)"
BPD,femd3wf,t3_epxg7k,1579249370.0,Where have you been all my life? lol
depression,femczzb,t3_epupd3,1579249224.0,"God I know what you mean about being a wage slave. It feels like we leave school and are just expected to work until either retirement or death. The problem is the retirement age keeps going up as people are living longer. So even if you dont die before you retire, you will likely have to keep working to survive. Talk about a vicious circle.

Anyway as a result of the above I started looking into offgrid living. Im in the UK so the climate is not the best to be truly offgrid then you have alsorts of planning laws etc. But im serously looking into van life. Just living in a campervan. Its cheaper than rent and it also means that if you dont have the same overheads then, although you may have to still work some hours or certain times of the year it wont be as bad as just go to bed, get up, go to work, pay bills and repeat for 6 decades.

Im with you though it really seems like just existing rather than actually living. I hope you can find something to make things a little more bearable but isnt it so much of a struggle?"
BPD,femckuz,t1_fembfct,1579248663.0,"I dont ever remember blacking out or being told that I did something that I completely dont remember. However the thing with BPD is that not everyone has the same symptoms its one of the reasons it really hard to diagnose. For example (i forget offhand the exact figures) but I think there are say, nine symptoms but someone only has to display around 4 or 5 to have BPD. (Ass eating isnt one!!! and thanks for your understanding lol)

I don't ever recall having a complete memory lapse though but thats not to say its not possible. I guess it wouldnt be a memory lapse if I remembered it lol but ive never been told I did something (sober) and not recalled it at least partially.

Had he been drinking or anything that could have contributed to the blackout? I've also heard of people being so incandecent with rage that they have forgotten things that they have said or done but that seemingly can happen to anyone not just someone with BPD.

If you kinda know when he is lying and it doesnt seem that he is, he may just be prone to bouts of anger that makes him forget things if the episode is intense enough. However as I say, this may not even be related to the BPD.

It's a weird one because it would usually be your BF who would be the one who doesnt think he is good enough for you not the other way around. Im no expert though so all I can say is kinda see how it goes and if things dont improve then you may have a decision to make as no matter what condition somone has people shouldnt have to put up with a partner being abusive. But it could just be a tough spell he is going through and he might change. Sorry im not much help but well done for sticking with it and at least trying to research the condition and understand it and help him. Some people run a mile and that includes therapists."
BPD,femc0bb,t3_eprv0y,1579247916.0,"We all make mistakes bud. You at least know that you made a mistake and were wrong and are trying to accept it and get over it. Everyone does this in different ways and some struggle to let go of past mistakes completely (myself included).

I forget where I saw or read this but something that helps me try and get over things like this is imagine that there are two universes. In both...you made the same mistake but in one universe you react a certain way to this mistake and in the other universe you act in a different, hopefully more constructive way.

So in scenario one, after you have been rude or behaved in an unacceptable manner....time passes as it invariably does, one minute goes past, then an hour, then a day and all the time you are going over it in your head, wishing you had not done it but nothing you do can change this it's done but you are keeping going over it again and again and not moving on. In your head after these days, weeks and months pass you are still there going over it again and again as if you are both still even in the same positions (the couch, the street, the car or whatever). But all this time you arent letting it go time is passing and life is passing you by.

In scenario/universe two. You still made exactly the same mistake but instead of letting it fly around contantly in your head. Imagine you go into the back seat of a taxi and the driver just drives (no fare, no particular destination) you're just driving away from the incident/mistake. It still happened but instead of being in that moment for months on end, beating yourself up over it, you are looking at it through the back window of this cab. Time passing = the cab driver driving away from this incident and you are just waving goodbye to it out the back window. As the miles clock up and the driver takes you further away from the scene, you are still waving goodbye to this mistake. Sooner or later, the scene and indeed the incident is completely out of sight, then as more miles clock up and more time passes you're in a different city, maybe even crosses a border. 

The point is in the second example, you still made the same mistake but you accepted it and learned from it, waved goodbye to it and moved on. This is the much more  constructive way to deal with what is essentially exactly the same problem.

Hope this helps bud and good luck with putting it behind you :)"
BPD,femb4zf,t3_epwf56,1579246802.0,"Not going to lie it can make relationships difficult but he should still know right from wrong. Classic signs are being a bit clingy (although rather unhelpfully this can also manifest itself as pushing people away)...it's to do with a fear of abandonment which depending on the person, can show in different ways.

Wreckless spending, alchohol/drug abuse, a history of intense/unstable relationships are also classic symptoms. A big one for me has been insomnia which isnt really a symptom according to psychiatrists but everyone I know with BPD has insomnia.

Not saying this is your boyfriend but I've been guilty of using it as an excuse for unacceptable behavour. For example I was seeing a girl who didnt have BPD but was BiPolar and well without going into too much graphic detail.....she was a bit self concious about her buttocks and one time we were being intimate and....well.....I ate her ass!

She said ""Oh I suppose that was because you have BPD too?"" So she knew right away I was going to use it as an excuse when it was really just me wanting to eat her ass.

So he is in control of his behaviour for the most part there might just be outburts or strange behaviour sometimes. It's very nice of you to try to understand what he is going through though and help him. Good luck with the relationship and hope things go well :)"
