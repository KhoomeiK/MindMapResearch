If the 2020 election goes the way it should, I see a lot of Yangs policies being expanded and debated in the coming years.  He’s just very young and new, so he doesn’t have the credibility that other candidates have.  He’s making an impact, and it will snowball.

I’m assuming you’re talking about when he is president after rereading it multiple times trying to understand.  If that’s what you’re referring to, I don’t think any president would be able to wipe any congressmen through impeachment.  I don’t care what party or anything.  Or if it happened in the past.  It won’t happen now, especially with the separation between parties.  

IMO it goes against the separations of powers/checks and balances anyway.  Ultimately congress has the final say based on the constitution.  The person would still have to be voted out, witnesses would need to be there, and ultimately there would need to be a large case with an investigation.  

If you’re implying that Bernie would be some sort of fascist president, that’s what we have right now.  You don’t need to blame it on a progressive socialist when the GOP has had this in motion since before the Regan admin."

We all know a lot of communities can be toxic.  “No one hates Star Wars like Star Wars fans.” Substitute Star Wars with GOT, LOTR, RDR2, GTA, Fallout, The Sopranos, knitting, whatever the fuck.  There’s always going to be toxic people and removing yourself from those communities is your choice, and I’m **NOT** shitting on that.  I’m just reiterating what the other person said in that those communities have helped me a ton.  Discussions, game questions, theories over the next season, or how the final season ended.  It’s all apart of it, you’re going to find crappy people wherever you go.  Imo I’m not going to hold myself back from the full experience of the hobby just because of a toxic fan base.

Being an atheist in SA isn’t a crime?  If I mention my religious ideology would it be a crime?  I’m curious if I never portrayed that I was atheist that I would be able to live there without worry.  If I lived there, told people I wasn’t religious and it was reported would I be in trouble?
