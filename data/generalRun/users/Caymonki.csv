television,ffc7r9o,t3_espyqz,1579793485.0,11 million. Yet the senate can’t stick around to watch.
blackmagicfuckery,ff8606s,t3_es38cy,1579666954.0,"This summer we had a few kids working for us as dishwashers. They saw me adding a slurry (cornstarch and water) to a soup and asked if they could “get some of that shit” so I dumped 2 boxes into a bucket and gave it to them. Few hours later the manager was looking for them, found them both in the bathroom with their shoes off, taking turns sticking their feet into the bucket. We all had a good chuckle, idiots."
destiny2,ff540ud,t1_ff3l8op,1579579620.0,"I never fucking learn, I get blasted by those damn things often."
OldSchoolCool,ff1g4qh,t1_ff0oeh5,1579478689.0,For that future sweet Reddit karma.

todayilearned,fev57ao,t3_eqhx5n,1579393228.0,"In high school we got to go on a bowling trip. When we got there some dude locked his keys in his car and the cop was struggling to get the door open. My buddy offered to help, and popped the door in seconds. The cop asked him how the hell do you know how to do that? He responds “my neighbor taught me, but the state of Maryland told me to stop doing it, don’t tell anyone”."
videos,fepskim,t1_fep93bq,1579329831.0,I’m playing this at work tomorrow at least twice.
todayilearned,feprrkq,t1_fepqkme,1579329062.0,"Agreed. Just trying to escape real life, just to get stuck in a virtual reality real life scenario. 
Don’t let it get to you though, there are still good ones out there, just gotta pick the subs that aren’t super overcrowded."
todayilearned,fepptyf,t1_fepoxya,1579327291.0,"I have noticed it’s in a lot of subs. It’s made me unsub from several places just from the sheer annoyance from attempting to comment. It’s just that some people suck, and they’re the loudest. Though if I learned anything from Reddit they’re just mean bots."
meirl,fei9d42,t1_fei341n,1579133205.0,I am completely unaware as to what you are referred to. I was doing Spider/Gunsmith weeklys.

toastme,feeo0px,t3_eokrx3,1579037631.0,"You look like a good dude to chill with. 

Everyone progresses differently. If anything those friends with kids are going to cherish the child free time they’ll get to spend with you while you chug through the next few years."
oddlysatisfying,fecek4n,t1_fec8m6i,1578972042.0,"I saw this once, except it was Sakrete. A guy stole another guys tools and got caught and cornered. They held him down until he whimpered and then they let him up. It got kinda sketchy. It was an off season job, I learned real fast that roofers are fucking crazy. Not ‘haha crazy’, but scary, I might die, crazy. Also, don’t steal anything. But definitely don’t steal tools from people who paid for them."
mildlyinteresting,fe7ova1,t3_eo08m4,1578917478.0,Mostly just don’t breathe in through your nose and you’ll be fine.
aww,fe63qkm,t1_fe5wxsf,1578881112.0,"I zip tied a section of wire fencing to the door on my truck. So I can roll the window down for my pup but she can’t jump out. I take a lot of flak for it, because “it looks rapey” per my co-workers. But it’s better than the constant fear of my dog jumping out."
technology,fdpw27y,t3_emdyhu,1578642880.0,I have a 1950 JD M.. It has survived an impressive amount of abuse and still runs like a champ. I don’t think it would be fun to farm with though.

todayilearned,fc5qe9v,t1_fc5kpdo,1577463702.0,"As a former WRX owner. Do it. They are such good cars, but don’t get a used one, get a 6 speed manual. Don’t worry about judgment because they’ll be behind you eating vape dust."
todayilearned,fc5q3uw,t3_egb6ru,1577463537.0,"The only speeding ticket I have had in my 14 years of driving. 85 in 70, cop knocked it down to 80 but maxed my fine out. 

I had a WRX at the time. My record was 142mph on a desolate stretch of highway in upstate Vermont. Those cars are fucking fast, now I have an old man truck and I’m happier. No premium gas and the clearance is phenomenally better."

My Mom passed away a few months ago, and my dogs stash of toys is dwindling, I do my best to keep up on them, but my dog definitely knows I suck. She misses the spoils."
