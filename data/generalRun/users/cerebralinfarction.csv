""These studies have not shown clear evidence of a relationship between cell phone use and cancer."" Cancer.gov also goes on to say the conclusions that do pop out as significant are inconsistent. 

You mention that the phone might locally raise the temperature but that is surely limited to the skin. The cancers they discuss are glioma and various cancers of neural tissue. Those tissues are under tight temperature regulation since neural activity is itself temperature sensitive.

Although the onus is on the papers to report a hypothetical mechanism, not the skeptics, I could speculate. People talking on their cell phones often may do so for work or family and may encounter more stress, which can lead to a whole myriad of health issues, which could produce a correlation between cancer and cell phone use. But that correlation, no matter if significant beyond p=0.05 on the stats test of their choice has no basis in causation. 

It's fine to remain open and curious, sure. I'm a scientist too. But for matters of public health, it's better to give more concrete advisory statements than to get bogged down by minutiae/weird correlations found in some occasional epidemiological studies. If we're still talking science, I think it would be way better to approach this from a more mechanism-based/hypothesis-driven direction than doing some data scraping."
