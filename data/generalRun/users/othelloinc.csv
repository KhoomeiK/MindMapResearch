Imagine a percentage system. (It would be impossible to actually mathematize this stuff, but it is a useful mental model.)

Every bad action chosen increases your 'bad percentage'.

No one is ever 100% bad, nor 0% bad.

Still, some people are a lot closer to 100% than others.

Maybe we start calling someone ""a bad person"" when they are over 50%, or over 80%...or maybe we never apply that label because we don't like what it connotes. Nevertheless, we can identify bad actions and the people who choose them.

By acknowledging that some actions are bad, we can then ask -- in a binary choice -- who is most bad?

In something like an election, this is *super important*. If you can tell that one of the candidates chooses bad actions significantly more than the other, then it should be near impossible to convince you to vote for the candidate that chooses bad actions more often.

----------

While there will always be some ambiguities, we can't let them stop us from making judgements between good and bad actions, choices, and candidates.

That's the point. It isn't weak.

If you put Trump and these two women on the stand in a courtroom, then did nothing else except try to strengthen or weaken their claims (attempts to discredit them, finding corroborating evidence, etc.) then I can pretty much guarantee you that the jury would conclude that it happened as these two women have sworn it happened.

> but if there was any evidence of this other than some people saying so than people would be pursuing this more and it would be a bigger deal

I've tried to be calm in all of my responses so far, but this part made that difficult.

There *were* people pursuing it more. The source I linked to in the initial comment was a Snopes article -- Snopes's core-competence is figuring out what is true. The Snopes article's sources are court filings which it links to.

Court filings are ""...people...pursuing this more..."". It is exactly what you are referring to.

Why hasn't the case gone forward? Because [she fears for her life](https://www.snopes.com/news/2016/11/05/trump-rape-lawsuit-dropped-again/):

> ...The complainant cited “numerous threats” against her life as the reason behind both her non-appearance and her dropping of the lawsuit...“She has been here all day, ready to do it, but unfortunately she is in terrible fear,” attorney Lisa Bloom said...

We also know that death threats and intimidation are a standard feature of cases like this because a Roy Moore accuser [had her home burned down](https://www.politico.com/story/2018/01/05/roy-moore-accuser-home-burns-down-arson-investigation-327078) and Kavanaugh's accuser can't go home due to [death threats](https://people.com/politics/christine-blasey-ford-cant-go-home-death-threats-lawyer/). 

Dropping the court case because she feared for her life does not make Katie Johnson's story any less credible.

----------

Who else do you think should be taking action?

The FBI director? The last FBI director to investigate Trump wrongdoing got fired for it. Trump even [admitted that was why he fired him](https://www.vox.com/2017/5/11/15628276/trump-comey-fired-russia)!

The attorney general? The last attorney general was fired because [he didn't interfere with an investigation into Trump wrongdoing](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-46132348). The current attorney general was hired in response to that, and the one thing he was known for was covering up crimes by members of the executive branch:

That's why people are so upset! The president seems to be getting away with many crimes *because he is willing to abuse the powers of his office to do so*.

...plus, many Republicans backed accused child molester Roy Moore, and the prosecutor who made a sweet-heart deal with Epstein originally, was [confirmed to Trump's cabinet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Acosta#Prosecution_of_Jeffrey_Epstein).

I'm going off on a bit of a tangent here, but...

You might want to look this over:

[Bill Clinton sexual misconduct allegations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Clinton_sexual_misconduct_allegations)

Bill Clinton has been accused of MUCH more than infidelity, and I feel like it doesn't do his accusers justice to only think of him as a cheater.

In fact, that Wikipedia article reads like he had a checklist of every possible kind of sexual misconduct and he was trying to collect them all:


> Juanita Broaddrick...states that he raped her...

> Leslie Millwee accused Bill Clinton of sexually assaulting her three times in 1980...on each of the three occasions, Clinton came up behind her and fondled her breasts, and on the second occasion, he rubbed his crotch against her and came to orgasm.

> According to Paula Jones...he...exposed himself...

> Kathleen Willey alleged Clinton groped her without consent...

> random person

This was not a ""random person"". This was someone swearing under oath. There is also corroborating evidence of her presence at Epstein's parties. This as good as eyewitness testimony gets.

Also, this statement corroborates what the accuser -- ""the [then 13-year-old] Plaintiff"" Katie Johnson -- said. That means two eyewitnesses corroborating each others' story. That is pretty persuasive.

I'm also going to quote myself here:

> [Trump] also has a history of lying whenever it suits him. That may not seem important, but I'll remind you that if you want *evidence* of what was described in that quote above...then you really have three witnesses: The victim (with nothing to discredit her), the witness quoted (with nothing to discredit her), and presumably Donald Trump denying it (with *every possible* reason to believe that he is lying).

If this case was brought before a jury, and it came down to who to believe, I can pretty much guarantee that the two women would be believed.

----------

Lastly, let's talk about false rape allegations.

Too often people (conveniently) over-simplify: Some rape allegations are false...so I guess we just shouldn't believe any accuser.

That's not how it works.

[1] You can look for corroborating evidence (like a witness in the room, as above) and fact check the stories of the accuser and the accused. Substantiating evidence strengthens the case, and sometimes evidence is found that weakens the case.

[2] False rape allegations aren't randomly dispersed among accusers. If you want to argue that we shouldn't believe accusers, start by reading up on results of study into this field:

[What kind of person makes false rape accusations?](https://qz.com/980766/the-truth-about-false-rape-accusations/)

...and figure out if Katie Johnson fits the profile.

[3] Finally, consider motives. A Roy Moore accuser [had her home burned down](https://www.politico.com/story/2018/01/05/roy-moore-accuser-home-burns-down-arson-investigation-327078). Kavanaugh's accuser can't go home due to [death threats](https://people.com/politics/christine-blasey-ford-cant-go-home-death-threats-lawyer/). The costs of coming forward with an allegation like this are high; the benefits are near nonexistent.

There is very little reason to disbelieve the accuser in a case like this."

> 
> 

I noticed that most of the replies to this have been about [A] the evidence against Trump ([the rape of Katie Johnson](https://old.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/em9t4a/president_donald_trump_and_convicted_child_sex/fdnsedh/) when she was 13, at an Epstein party, according to both Johnson herself and another witness who was in the room.)

...but we should talk about your other two questions:

[B] Is there evidence against Bill Clinton as well?

...and...

[C] Did any of these people kill Epstein?

Here we go...

----------

[B] Is there evidence against Bill Clinton as well?

[We know](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/bill-clinton-with-jeffrey-epstein/) that Bill Clinton flew multiple times on the ""Lolita Express""; a private plane that Epstein used to get guests to his private island. That is pretty suspicious. No one writes a receipt for sexual assault, so this is the closest we can get to a paper record.

However, as far as I know, no one has come forward and said that she was assaulted by Bill Clinton at one of these parties, nor witnessed him assault anyone else. Granted, Bill Clinton has been accused of sexual misconduct of many kinds by [many](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Clinton_sexual_misconduct_allegations) women, so it seems reasonable to be suspicious of him.

Still...if you limit it to the Epstein case, there is persuasive evidence of Donald Trump committing a crime, but not Clinton. The persuasive evidence that Clinton has committed sex crimes is real, but unrelated to Epstein.

Side Note: There is basically *zero* reason to bring Hillary Clinton into this discussion. If someone mentions her, they are probably just a nut.

----------

[C1] Did any of these people kill Epstein? Bill Clinton?

Ultimately, we don't know who killed Epstein.

There seems to be substantial evidence -- and cause for suspicion -- suggesting that he didn't kill himself, but we don't know exactly who *did* kill him, nor who gave the orders/made it possible.

That being said, Bill Clinton probably didn't do it. He has the ability to get media attention, but no direct power that we know of. In order for us to entertain *even the slightest* belief that Clinton might have ordered the hit, we would need to have some evidence of the mechanism he would use; things like a history of mob connections or supporters in law enforcement who would be willing to commit crimes on his behalf. He doesn't have any of that; and without that, it is just a silly conspiracy theory.

Don't get me wrong: There is substantial evidence that Bill Clinton would abuse his power in order to get away with sex crimes.

...there is just zero evidence that he *currently has* the power to abuse, to murder someone in federal custody.

---------

[C2] Who else might have killed Epstein?

Anyone that Epstein had damaging information on.

The prevailing theory is that Epstein made a routine practice of providing underage girls to those with wealth and power, then blackmailed them over it. If that is true, there are MANY wealthy & powerful people who had a motive, and they should all be considered suspects.

...but without the means -- the way of actually killing him -- we don't have a lot to go on. Matt Groening has a lot of money...but can he kill people in federal prisons? Probably not.

These suspects should be investigated, but we can't assume they are guilty of murder (many of them are probably guilty of sex crimes).

----------

[C3] Did anyone have both *the means* and *the motive* to kill Epstein?

There are two men who stand out...

Suspect #2

William Barr is the current United States Attorney General. As such, he is in charge of federal prisons, including the one that Epstein died in. He undeniably had the means -- power he could abuse -- to participate in the killing. 

His father is also a key figure in Epstein's rise to prominence. With nothing else, that would be a motive.

...but Barr also has a reputation as ""Coverup-General"" for his work silencing the investigation into [Iran-Contra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Barr#Iran-Contra). This reputation has to be considered because Trump hired Barr *after* an investigation into his campaign had been launched by the Justice Department. It is very likely that Barr was hired specifically for his ability to coverup the president's crimes. That too, is a motive.

...and that brings us to:

Suspect #1

Donald Trump's extensive relationship with Epstein has been thoroughly documented. Trump also has a history of sexual assault against adult women, and a history of verbally expressing sexual desire for underage girls.

...but it is best to listen to Katie Johnson and the witness quoted here:

> I personally witnessed four sexual encounters that the [then 13-year-old Katie Johnson] was forced to have with Mr. Trump during this period, including the fourth of these encounters where Mr. Trump forcibly raped her despite her pleas to stop.

[Source](https://www.snopes.com/news/2016/06/23/donald-trump-rape-lawsuit/)


He has a motive. He has a history of criminal behavior, and a history of trying to coverup criminal behavior.

He also has a history of lying whenever it suits him. That may not seem important, but I'll remind you that if you want *evidence* of what was described in that quote above...then you really have three witnesses: The victim (with nothing to discredit her), the witness quoted (with nothing to discredit her), and presumably Donald Trump denying it (with *every possible* reason to believe that he is lying).

That is pretty persuasive.

Lastly, the means. Barr worked for him. Trump also seems to have a number of federal employees who are willing to violate the law in service to him. If *anyone* had the ability to have Epstein killed in a federal prison, it was the sitting president of the United States.

----------

Does that mean Trump and Barr killed Epstein? No.

It just means that they ought to be the chief suspects.
