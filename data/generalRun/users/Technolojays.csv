I wonder if you were effected by the google update which targeted health related content. I heard that Google considers only if the content is created or reviewed at least by a professional expert. Not sure if it is really like that. But it's the reason i changed my mind to write about baby niche.. 

I am a father of a toddler and have many information about babies for 2 years, wish i could write about my experiences, but if it wont rank, no way..."

do you mean page relevance or site relevance or both? :) Is there a spesific way/tool to measure relevancy that you can advice? thanks..."
juststart,fdo3vu5,t3_em8gkn,1578598420.0,"Thank you very much sharing this great journey. It really provides direction to start doing the right thing.

Although it stills sounds like a dream for me to make even 1 dollar from affiliate thing, it helps to see it can really be done. I really can't imagine how great it'd feel not to be tied to a 9-5 job and never ending busy work in a day. But I hope I'll manage to make it real as you did, and I'll thank you once again."
depression,fdk4ius,t3_elqwy9,1578495865.0,"This is my list. 

Parents who argued everyday at my childhood period, also my dad's relatives those tried to manipulate my father think my mom is not doing things properly.

Dad who was always angry and yelling around for anything.

A childhood under pressure to always act as an ideally regular, quiet and not couraged for expressing thoughts and feelings.

Selfish and disrespectful people, specially at the confusing, stressfull and crowded traffic in my country.

A 9-5 job to work for a boss who always asks for more than a man can do and no other chance to survive if i don't get the salary even for a month...

But still life worths to go on."

Anxiety,fchq8o5,t3_eh69it,1577652988.0,"It is very clear that how your dad treats to you is totally wrong. Just trust me, it is. First, it's very rude and offensive for nothing. We aren't presented options for choosing our family. I hope he will develop his communication skills..."
