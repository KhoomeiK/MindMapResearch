I wasn't going to reply again but I have to ask if you're making the claim here that genocide doesn't count unless it occurs on foreign territory?

I do have a 401K. I imagine they're all doing well, but I like to look at the world outside of my own bubble, and I'm seeing there are a lot more important things that really need attention. Things that could be improved that wouldn't even impact my 401K.

Your focus on such a materialistic and self-serving thing that bears no real consequence on the majority of the world is very telling. Once again, narcissistic. Do you really think your 401K wouldn't be doing well if we had a different President?"

Pretty pathetic that you had family in Auschwitz and you're still supporting the types of policies and individuals that placed them there. Having family that was victimized does not mean you were victimized. You are supposed to honor their suffering by continuing to fight against what imprisoned them. Not this.

Have fun representing evil in the world in order to prove some sort of point about someone being mean to you online.

Textbook narcissism. No wonder you like Trump.

Here's a friendly suggestion: ***If you don't want to be called a Nazi, don't support Nazi policies***

Nazi's were never going to help our cause.

No you didn't.

>It cracks me up when people like you compare Trump to Adolf Hitler.

I didn't compare him to Hitler. I said he endorses Nazi's, which he does. Perhaps you heard of Charlottesville and the white supremacists? Or Stephen Miller? He's literally a Nazi. White supremacists and Nazi's follow the same ideology. I know, as someone who supports a Nationalist, you don't like to be compared to Nazis, but if the shoe fits...

I don't discriminate against people based on who they are. I discriminate against them based on their choices, and being conservative is a choice. Fuck *all* of the aforementioned."
SeattleWA,fdarzlc,t1_fdajidi,1578249345.0,"I love how you replace, ""I'm too ashamed to express my deplorable opinions in public"" with ""Republican voters have been driven into the closet"".

Grow some balls and have an opinion. If you can't have an opinion and handle the criticism you're not a victim, you're a coward. And if opinions really attract such virulent criticism then maybe the problem isn't the critics.

""Wah, wah, wah, people don't like me when I support genocide of minorities, heartily endorse Nazis, defend foreign treason, and ignore constitutional law and due process!!""

Thin-skinned. Requiring safe spaces. There's a lot of projection coming from the right because I only see one side  constantly playing the victim.

What kind of pathetic assholes so desperately want to become the victim from such a place of sheer privilege? The reality is they perceive their privilege as ""equality"", so when you try to actually equalize the scales, they feel persecuted because ***they're no longer on top***. They personify pathetic.
