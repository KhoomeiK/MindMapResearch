pmp,ffsnk7s,t3_euybj3,1580186328.0,Just wait 1 more year for the PMP and do the CAPM in the meantime. If you do the PMP and get audited you will fail the audit and then you won’t be able to reapply until you get the actual experience because you WILL be audited again until you pass the audit.
pmp,ffryb3l,t1_ffrwn1w,1580168673.0,Thanks for the insight. I’m similar- I’ve done personal projects using professional project management methods but haven’t done formal project management at my job. So I would feel comfortable developing a study plan similar to yours now seeing how much work you did/didn’t do to prepare and how it translates to success on the exam.
pmp,ffrrooo,t3_eutu2h,1580164322.0,Thanks for the concise description of your studying experience! What’s your previous experience in project management?
marijuanaenthusiasts,ffpnsuu,t1_ffphj5u,1580099790.0,I think part of it is the top picture seems to be taken in winter and the bottom in summer so the summer foliage makes it look like there’s more growth
NoStupidQuestions,ffpkh94,t1_ffpannm,1580097233.0,"I had the same experience, but I preferred the late-night work over early work.  I used to work at 5am to 1pm so I would go to bed at 9:30 and wake up at 4:30. I was ok with it but didn’t like going to bed so early and hated getting up early. Later I got a different job where I worked 5pm to 1am. I find it hard to sleep immediately after coming home from work so I would stay up til 8am and then sleep til 3pm. Same number of hrs working and sleeping yet the “crazy” schedule was much more desirable for me. But like you, I gained the ability to sleep with no alarm for late jobs, and also the ability to wake up with no snooze on early jobs."
AskNYC,ffp8vx9,t1_ffp4zss,1580089105.0,"I live on a ground floor apt with a door that opens up to a courtyard space and the number of disgusting items we see in front of our door is astounding. Feces (human I guess), bagged vomit, used condoms, broken beer bottles, etc. Luckily we have an attentive super that is kind enough to clean the courtyard regularly.I feel bad for our super to have to clean up this garbage"
todayilearned,ffmufx2,t1_ffmfxkr,1580059050.0,Yea I’m in an open floor plan where I get distracted all the time though in general I’m good at blocking things out. The problem is people that come by my desk to ask me questions. My boss has her own office and I used to think that she gets less distracted than me bc of her ability to close the door but it turns out she gets even more distracted bc even more people stop by her office than my desk
todayilearned,ffmu018,t1_ffmf537,1580058878.0,I like the open floor plan bc of the environment it creates but there definitely are days I just wish I could go into an office and not be disturbed so dedicated quiet rooms where I could do that sounds awesome
todayilearned,ffmr7ia,t1_ffls67z,1580058061.0,Wait there are offices where you have to change your desk every day?
pmp,ffdfyd5,t3_esxwqx,1579820059.0,"The important thing to remember is that the exam is not based on the PMBOK guide. The exam _references content_ found in the PMBOK, but the exam is not actual on the actual PMBOK guide. If you’re looking to _learn about project mangement_ and have a reference guide for best practices to apply to your profession, PMBOK guide is great. If you’re looking to _pass the test_ and don’t actually care about the content, a reputable study book like Ritas book is better."

AskNYC,ff7oc3z,t3_es2p3v,1579654373.0,I grew up in the suburbs of philly. I equate taking off my shoes to “getting personal and comfortable” so I actually take off my shoes in my own house but not other people’s house unless they ask.
AskNYC,ff7o47i,t1_ff7ly9m,1579654217.0,Lmaoo this reminds me of the older woman in Argentina I lived with. She insisted on doing my laundry but she would complain about how dirty my socks got. I tried to explain to her that I purposely kept my socks on and let them get dirty because I preferred dirt on my socks over the feeling of house dirt stuck to my feet.

AskReddit,ff5uccp,t1_ff5ch2w,1579610536.0,Did you have trouble getting out of Russia bc of legalities (visas) or just because you didn’t have money at the time? I remember hearing about how getting exit visas out of Russia’s in the past could become hard for some people. I think last I heard Russia doesn’t do exit visas anymore though
