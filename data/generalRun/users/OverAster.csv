JusticeServed,ffbn9ih,t1_ffblaz7,1579773891.0,"I am not committing any fallacy. I very explicitly stated that the conclusions I have drawn are directly tied to my personal experience with these people, you've just chosen to ignore that. The ratio that I experience may not be the same as the one you experience, and your rush to brush off my experience to further validate your own is a fallacy in and of itself. In fact, you seem to have commit several, and as someone who has written debating points and counter arguments professionally, I feel the need to underline them for you.

1) The Hasty Conclusion Fallacy. 
I did not generalize the entirety of a political body. I understand that the majority of the feminist group does not believe what the majority of feminists I have met believes, which is why I reiterated several times throughout my message that these are the people who have claimed feminism that I have come into contact with. You, however, seem to be asserting that your experiences with feminists seem to adjudicate the entirety of the feminist body. This is a logical leap. Your personal experience cannot determine the majority of a group, and there are no determining stats that back up your claims, as far as I can find. Most cases actually seem to show that the majority of people don't really even know what a feminist is. 

You also commit this fallacy when you said, ""... the way you talk about women ""wanting equal rights"" as if that's some sort of a privilege that women have made a choice to request screams very sexist to me."" It seems like you wanted to put a negative label on him to discredit the entirety of his argument, but couldn't find a justifiable reason to do so, so rather than actually argue the point, you jumped to a conclusion.

2)The burden of proof fallacy. 
I made very clear that my beliefs were directly derived from my experiences, you however did not. You stated as though what you were claiming was objectively true, regardless of you not providing any evidence to support your points.
 
It's also important to note that some of your points are objectively false. A good example is this line: ""Women didn't ""say they want equal rights""."" They did. They actually did several times. Did you happen to miss the suffrage movement? A movement which, surprisingly enough, was the foundation for feminism?

3)The ""no true Scotsman"" fallacy
You have asserted that a feminist can not be someone who believes that men can't defend themselves. A belief you stated here: ""The views of the nuts that think men should not be able to protect themselves do not represent the majority of feminists."" This of course is not the case, as feminism has little to do with self defense across genders, and much more to do with written law and patching up unfair rights. You have acted to write off an entire subsection of the feminist movement, which also happens to be the most vocal subsection of this movement, and have elected to ignore how they're changing the way feminism as a whole is perceived. 

Fact of the matter is, Feminism is changing, and not necessarily for the better. It's time to understand that. 

Also, the fallacy which you think I commit is not ""the nutpicker fallacy"" it's called, ""The anecdotal evidence fallacy."""

JusticeServed,ffblncy,t1_ffbjrjo,1579771410.0,What's your grudge with fat people?
JusticeServed,ffblija,t1_ffbggk3,1579771201.0,"Nah, that'd get you killed. Anyone willing to rape should be assumed to be willing to do worse, and insulting their dignity isn't going to help. 

I would recommend stabbing the throat or abdomen with your keys, a pocket knife, high heels, or anything that can cause penetrative damage. If you have nothing like that, kick the balls, hard. As hard as you can kick. You're aiming to kick their balls so hard they can taste it. Anyone willing to rape doesn't deserve to use their balls anyway, so you're doing no real damage. If you cannot kick their balls, punch them. Same level of force should be used. If you can't punch very hard you can grab them and squeeze, pull, twist, or yank. Any combination of this will do.

The main goal, however, shouldn't be to cause serious damage, kill, or revel in their pain. When you feel you are in a dangerous position your number one priority is to get away as fast as you can. There's no telling what they'll be capable of when they get up, how long it'll take them to recover, or if they plan on continuing, so it's time to leave. When they lose the ability or intent to keep you where you are, your job is to leave, and fast. If you can get away at any time, do it. This is incredibly important. Revenge is nothing compared to the risk you take by staying."

JusticeServed,ffbl6yk,t1_ffbihgs,1579770710.0,"I think it's this sentiment that perpetuates men's inability to defend against dangerous women, especially those of domestic nature. When you become the judge between dangerous and harmless the person trying to defend them self loses all power. 

I've personally been in an abusive relationship, and as a 6' 4"" man it was incredibly difficult to justify my own defense. Either ""she wasn't actually hurting me,"" or, ""I could do way more damage,"" or, ""There's nothing wrong with a woman hitting a man,"" popped into my head, and I was powerless. The idea that someone smaller couldn't cause damage to someone else is incredibly dangerous, and blatantly wrong. 

Justification for defense then has to come down to intent. Does this person intend to hurt me, and if so, will my hurting them save myself. 

In my situation I should have fought back, ran from that relationship, and save myself a whole lot of issues down the line, but because of the idea that I was too dangerous to defend myself, I never could."
JusticeServed,ffbkwjq,t1_ffbk6v5,1579770262.0,"I mean, you can say that, sure, but that doesn't mean that's what the reality is. I'm not trying to discredit your understanding of it, but I've met plenty of men and women who would heavily disagree with your sentiment. I would argue that a vast majority of  self-proclaimed feminists I've personally come into contact with would disagree with what the man did. 

I do agree that anyone who believes in equal rights between men and women would say that this man was justified in his actions, but I don't believe that's the definition of feminist anymore. Perhaps it's time to get a new word to describe people that are in support of equal rights, rather than using feminist, a label that, by in large, has drastically changed in meaning over the last decade."

You seem to suffer from delusions of grandeur, and maybe even a minor case of autism.

My mom doesn't work a traditional job. She stays at home with us, meets all of our friends, has all day to celebrate birthdays, visits our doctor's, dentists, and teachers, and feeds us. She knows those things because she does those things. 

These people that come into the comments and complain about how awful the dad is for not knowing all of this stuff are either too young to understand, or are living in a fairy tail world.

Your breathing posture is awful. Your stomach is holding up the weight of your upper body, and you're flexing your core to do so. Sit up a bit straighter, and set your head at a ninety degree level to your chest.

As for the tonality. You're very pitchy. It feels like you're unsure of where the next note is. You need to go to a piano, or use your guitar, and play scales while singing with the notes played. Sooner or later that'll be so burned into your mind that you'll find it difficult to sing the wrong notes, but you need a much stronger intuitive foundation for the flow of the scale. 

Stop pushing your head forward. When you sing your head should be close to directly above your torso, just over your center of mass. Jutting forward your head and stretching your neck will damage your vocal chords, and will strain your throat, further damaging your breathing. 

Going back to breathing, take deeper breaths, and don't breathe into your shoulders. It's okay to move when singing, singing is inherently expressive, but if you lift your shoulders when you breathe you'll just further put stress on your neck, doing everything that jutting your head forward was doing. 

Your voice texture is terrible. That's not your voice. You shouldn't mimic someone else's singing, you should make your own. Listen to famous singers during their interviews. Notice how their voices and their singing voices (sans classical and opera) aren't all that different? You need to do that, but with your voice.

Before you sing, especially since you're just starting out, you need to warm up. This will get your throat and body used to the unique vocal movements that are required to sing well. I suggest either standing, or sitting on a flat surface with your feet flat on the floor, your back straight and perpendicular to the floor, and your chin parallel to the floor. Eventually you'll be able to sing well without warning up, but right now it's important that you force yourself to develop good breathing habits, all of which will be adopted naturally with warmups and good posture. 

Try and get better strumming patterns. If you only play the down stroke of every chord your music won't flow, and it'll be harder to sing with emotion, which is the most important part of singing.

But yeah, keep trying. You'll get there sooner or later. You've gotten a good start, already knowing guitar, so it's only a matter of time before the vocals follow."
