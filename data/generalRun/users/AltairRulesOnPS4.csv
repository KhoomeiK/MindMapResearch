ems,ffjy4da,t3_etzj4r,1580010154.0,"I didn’t feel sad or anything with my first death as ems because I had a very traumatic childhood. I felt disappointed that we couldn’t save her and felt like if I were a full paramedic, that I could’ve saved her. But Mayo ALS was there about 10 mins after us and said there was nothing that they could even do, so that helped. I still want to go to full paramedic though due to the rural area I live in, to give people a better chance at life. One of the gals on our crew though worked on and lost her next door neighbor that she had been friends with for over 30 years, so she took it quite hard. Myself and the others checked in on her routinely for the next week or so including one of those “meetings” to help her deal with it. She’s doing much better now but it did make me more aware to ask others on our crew how they’re doing when we have a death of someone we know (small community) or particularly gruesome trauma."

We did have a really shy guy who was brand new to this and he kept getting “stage fright”, so I left them alone so they could finish lol. When occasionally it’s a girl for me, it varies as well for the same reasons. We separate sex from emotions essentially. When we’re with others whether it be alone or all together, it’s just pure raw animal sex, purely pleasure. When it’s just the wife and I, it’s sensual “making love” where we connect in addition to sex. One of our main rules is if one starts to develop feelings for someone, the involvement ends. We’ve had a couple guys who started to develop romantic feelings for her, so they got the boot."
