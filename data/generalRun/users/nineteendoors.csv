Adoption,ffjbv2b,t3_ett15t,1579995029.0,I would love to adopt an older child someday. I'm so sorry you're experiencing this.
bipolar2,ff7es6a,t1_ff71igu,1579647877.0,"It might be illegal, but try proving that the firing was for that reason. It's hard to win a lawsuit in these cases, particularly since the existence of the lawsuit will publicize your illness and make future prospective employers less likely to hire you."
journalismjobs,feydmoz,t3_eq51bb,1579444185.0,"Journalists make too little to be able to afford to give away their labor to benefit an unpaid side gig. Please post this somewhere else. It's insulting, TBH."
recruitinghell,fei0i41,t1_fegi23j,1579127630.0,Congratulations?
Journalism,fei096h,t1_fegs5mj,1579127481.0,"Looks like his response was essentially, ""this is just how I talk to women."" He's awful."
bipolar,fdzjugy,t1_fdzj9d2,1578790876.0,"We're not supposed to take JUST antidepressants. If we take them, they have to be taken with something else or we'll become hypomanic or manic. I take mine with an antipsychotic, which helps stabilize my mood. Lots of people with bipolar disorder, especially bipolar II, experience such severe depression that we need an antidepressant on top of another medication."
bipolar,fdzj5w1,t1_fdxzjv5,1578790710.0,"I'm on an antidepressant, an antipsychotic, and a medication that helps me sleep at night. I need all three to function well."
bipolar2,fdwzx4z,t3_en7vn4,1578763896.0,"Even with meds, I experience mood swings and depression right before my period. My husband is able to tell when my period is about to start by my behavior, because normally, after years on medication, I am stable. It's not nearly as bad now as it was without medication though."
bipolar,fdwxs4o,t1_fdwwcl6,1578763284.0,I know how hard depression is. I've been in that place too. <3 You are strong.
bipolar,fdvr6de,t3_en1nb9,1578750593.0,"This is a hauntingly beautiful portrayal of depression. I'm sorry you have been suffering but you were able to channel those feelings into an incredible piece of work. Wow. <3 <3 Hope you feel better soon, OP, but congrats on an awesome piece of art."
Wellthatsucks,fdvpe15,t3_en295l,1578750041.0,"""I wasn't texting. I was looking at my phone.""   
Holy shit is right. Wow."
bipolar2,fdp7jry,t3_emd3vz,1578621836.0,"I'm so sorry about the loss of your client. Thank you for sharing this with us.  Reading it made me cry.   
Please continue in your work as a psychologist. It makes me feel good about the profession to know that there are people that care as much as you do out there, doing their best for their clients."

bigboobproblems,fc9a8b5,t3_ego0ze,1577549545.0,TBH it sounds like you need new friends more than new boobs.
CatsInSinks,fc94u40,t3_egev68,1577547049.0,That sink looks like it was designed for that cat.
angrycatpics,fc94pxn,t3_egr0d5,1577547000.0,Good thing you woke up when you did...

ToxicMoldExposure,fc924bq,t1_f9dnw5y,1577545797.0,That could definitely be mold.
ToxicMoldExposure,fc920qj,t3_eco4v1,1577545753.0,"I am so sorry you're going through this. We went through it with my husband last year, and it's awful. It was the worst experience of our lives. It is absolutely shocking how little most traditional doctors know about mold."
bipolar2,fc90ocg,t3_egq7x0,1577545131.0,This is beautiful!
AspiePartners,fc6o5za,t3_egctmp,1577485257.0,"You are in an abusive relationship. His behavior is destructive and manipulative, and his refusal to seek help is toxic.  Giving away your kittens? Calling you names? I know plenty of people on the spectrum who do not treat people like that. Having autism is not a choice, but how you treat other people in your life is, regardless of your internal experience.   
I have a mental illness. Does that mean I get to treat everybody in my life like shit and blame it on my condition or blame them for triggering me? No. That would be abuse. Everyone has choices, including people who are wired differently.   
Get out while you still can. He is refusing to take responsibility for his behavior and he is not going to get better unless he wants to. He has made it pretty clear where he stands."
