I’m sure you’ve heard of fractional reserve banking. Regular banks create a lot more credit and currency than Central Banks. Every loan on every banks’ books is money created largely out of thin air.  There must be a certain nominal percentage of real currency on hand in reserve against each loan. The percentages where increased by the Basel II accords in the wake of the 2008 global banking crisis. 

Take that loan and make a bunch more. Then make loans on those loans and loans on those loans. Oh and the reserves that back one loan could’ve come out of thin air when a earlier loan was made. You get the picture?

As far as the Aussie goes, if the fire were to engulf his ranch he would not be able to stop it. So what you’re really saying is that he choose to die with his horses if it comes to that.

There is a calculus that most people go through in these situations. Part of that is, “I’m no good to my animals dead.” Getting stabbed for your dog doesn’t help your dog. You don’t get away, your dog doesn’t get away. Getting burned alive with your horses doesn’t help your horses. If you really love them for them then put them all out to pasture. Fill the water cisterns, put out bales of alfalfa and other feed, then open the gates. They’ll stick around the general area unless the fire approaches the ranch.

Not sure whether toxic people are inherently drawn to fantasy worlds where they are capable of exerting their influence or video games create an artificial distance between people that spawns unhealthy interactions.

Regardless, if you’re to grow as a human, then you need to get away from the video games and engage a diversity of people in real life."

Whether he’s a day three pick or a priority UDFA, he’s not going to go high enough that the coaching staff has ego invested in his development if he doesn’t show out in camp."
huskies,fczzr7l,t1_fcydu08,1578111446.0,"Do you honestly think a 1,000 rusher is going to be scared to compete against the guys he beat out for the role last season? That’s not how any successful college player thinks about the NFL decision. They make the leap because they believe they’re ready to compete for a job at the next level."
huskies,fczyute,t1_fcyh2cn,1578110993.0,"That’s right. Despite his size, McGrew has great instincts and feet between the tackles. Newton runs angry and I love that. He’s only going to get more explosive and scary as he continues through our S&C program.

Ahmed is strictly a third down back in the NFL. But he is great in space and could really excel in that role if used properly. A role like what the Bears do with Tarik Cohen would be perfect. He will surely check all the athletic measurable boxes at the combine.

I would’ve loved to have Salvon back for his final year. But another year wouldn’t change who he is as a back so he probably made the right call."
facepalm,fczx2yp,t1_fczoy3q,1578110105.0,"I really don’t want to see us go to war with Iran. I was a Peace Corps Volunteer in West Africa. I’ve been against our entire debacle in Iraq from the start. Stopping our international military bullying is probably my number one issue when it comes to politics. So let me say again, I really don’t want to see us in another war. 

But the Iranian special forces general was directing military operations against our embassy in Baghdad *from the Baghdad airport*. There was no way he was done with offensive operations either. He was in the theater of operations to continue directing attacks on US civilians as well as our soldiers. Fuck him. Kill the guy that is actually behind these acts of violence instead of the Iranian soldiers just following orders. 

Given that the guy was killed at the Baghdad airport your comment that the authorization was not based on intelligence is completely disposable. 

As stupid as Trump is on Twitter he’s been bringing troops home and deescalating our military engagements in Afghanistan and Iraq while avoiding entanglement in Syria much to the consternation of the talking heads across the political spectrum.

I will put up with a lot of stupid bullshit from an asshole that everyone hates if he is working to stop our involvement in decades long wars. Lives matter more than feelings."

This seems like a very foreign concept to you, but it is the very essence of being libertarian. Have you just started studying libertarian views or are you here to subject us to your opinions?"
libertarianmeme,fcowzrz,t1_fcotl89,1577843881.0,"That’s subjective and my opinion is that they’re not enjoyable. They’re addictive and habit forming, which causes people to attempt to rationalize this by claiming they’re enjoyable when they are horrible tasting.

I smoked for a period of years. Maybe that helps you understand my strong opinions on the matter."

I can’t make any sense of your last three sentences apart from a rather melodramatic attempt to make something mundane sound very noble and representative of core libertarian principles."
