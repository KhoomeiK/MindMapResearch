It actually does matter why his license was denied when people use it as an argument to promote their agenda. Id bet real money more than a few of them also turn around and call him Martin Luther Coon after invoking his name for their cause. These people use the 2A to maintain the status quo, not to fend off an out of control government. If that was the case, where was the 2A crowd when trump said take the guns first and due process later? Or when bush passed the patriot act?

That shit is happening right now and theres nothing but crickets from the tacticool crowd because *their guy* is ""winning""."

I personally am not going to pretend that more than a few of these people arent being serious and using ""Boogaloo"" as a dog whistle code word for ""kill people we dont like"". 

It is disingenuous AS FUCK for you to even suggest regulation was the cause of MLKs license being denied and not, oh, say the racist fuckwit sheriff. How can you seriously think that? Are you that out of touch with reality?"

I disagree about your point that they know what theyre getting into. All these people know is what theyre told to believe, they eat up the jingoism and fake ass patriotism like ambrosia. They think theyre fighting for america and not for select peoples interests."

These dudes didnt sign up to die so cheney could make a couple of bucks and bush could get revenge for his dad. They keep beating the patriotism drum saying theyre fighting for our freedoms over there and that is a load of bullshit.

If you dont subscribe to tbe fact that bush cheated to win the election and then allowed people to die on 9/11 so they could go to war for personal gain then we dont have much to say to each other."
