It takes some understanding of Linux and some trial and error to get there, but in the end it boils down to picking the opinionated package of Linux + other utilities that aligns most closely with your ideal opinionated package of Linux + other utilities. Even without looking up lesser-known distros, there's probably one distro that aligns with your idea of perfection more than the others.

For example, I think operating systems should be minimal, modular, come with only the basic tools to function and let the user speak and decide what they want. But I also want it to be practical and I don't want to compile things. Arch gets closest and Arch stays on my box until the day my vision changes. If you think an OS should be updated, come ready to work with all the basic utilities and with strong security standards that would be Fedora.

Everything except linux and linux-headers

> I've been on Manjaro for 2 maybe 3 years now, only 1 hiccup when they forgot to update their keys or whatever, something Google and similar big companies have done. 

Anecdotal experience. I've been on Arch and I haven't even had that one hiccup, but that is my own merit because I did my homework, RTFM and regularly updated my rolling distro while always reading the RSS feed before performing an upgrade, something that you should do on Arch and all derivates. You *can* ignore it and it will still technically work and update, but it will come back and bite you later - guaranteed. Also, even on this subreddit, there are many reports of people having issues with Manjaro. But all of this is irrelevant, since anecdotal experience is not proof.

> Though I dislike that its German made, the german surveillance state is actually scary.

Could you elaborate on this? What surveillance state? Germany has strict privacy laws and the whole code is open source and audited anyway, security-wise it's mostly safe to use Manjaro (the only thing that needs to be checked is how good the security team is at patching CVEs - it certainly doesn't have any spyware features added by the Manjaro team itself

Manjaro is still an arch-based rolling release that comes with implications. Rolling releases shouldn't be given to beginners, there are a lot of moving parts and more potential for shit to break. And you can't tell an absolute beginner to RTFM and check a RSS feed before upgrading and expect them to know what a chroot is, a beginner needs a softer learning curve and their hand held a bit more. I've seen almost nobody start with Manjaro, most people just move to it from, like, Ubuntu"

linux,fexcutj,t1_feudiai,1579428825.0,"> Also, you are not forced to reboot your PC to install updates.

This is true, but this is also terrible advice. If anything major got updated, you should totally reboot and avoid probolems. If you update KDE Plasma and then you don't reboot to reload it, you'll see random errors pop up of qt5 liberaries no longer being loaded. If you update Firefox and not restart it webpages will stop loading and it will generally act weird. Etc etc etc. If something you have opened gets updated, you should restart it. If it's something low-level like systemd, you should reboot. If it's the DE, it's sufficient to log out and back in. If it's the kernel, it depends on your distro.

The beauty of it is that you aren't really forced to do that, and you can do updates whenever you want, so you're not going to be forced to just reboot while you're working. You can choose to update when your work is over and then power off."

I don't think they have ""tamed"" the Arch base as much as they claim they have.

It's honestly simple for beginners IMO. Look at the ubuntu family and install the one that has the desktop environment you prefer, then go from there. It's actually designed to be for beginners, it doesn't require users to read from an RSS that this update requires pacman -Syyuu because `systemd` was downgraded once again, plus there's a wealth of information regarding Ubuntu online and it's all aimed at beginners."

All of these fancy automation programs run under X11: either you need a full X11 session or you need to run them under XWayland. So, in both cases, sadly, not a chance.

I won't hide it: I don't like being criticized as a mod, but if enough people complain, I'll listen. If it's not an isolated small group but a majority of the community complaining you may be doing the work for free, but you may not be doing it well. And you should gather all the mods and go back to the drawing board. Being a mod is not about exercising power, it's about making the community work but filtering out the trolls, the spam and the shit. If the community constantly resists your behaviour you're not making the community work.

After all you're working for free, you're at the n-th mod action of the day, you don't want users who sit there and just chat to complain about your free work. *I get it.*

But while it's one thing if it's an isolated group of trolls consistently criticizing your moderation (because you keep shutting down their constant flame wars and trolling attempts so they don't like you), when *a vast percentage of your community* is constantly complaining about your moderation being heavy-handed, so much that you can't even lock and hide the criticism before it gets popularâ€¦ maybe there's a problem that is worth looking into? I'd personally suggest the mods to have a chat about this and seriously evaluate if all the recent criticism can be dismissed as trolling or if there is some truth to it. Because trolls and problematic users are statistically a minority. Most people aren't sociopaths who are just there to disrupt and cause havoc: they legitimately just want to interact with the community.

* For example, I am not convinced by the innate superiority of a dock + top bar with a global menu and system tray. I personally find that an utter waste of space, and purely an annoyance to users who don't pin their applications and always open them via they keyboard: for this kind of user, the taskbar paradigm saves space and it's generally better. i don't agree on the global menu being the best option universally either - it's without a doubt the best option if you have gone with a dock to try and reclaim some of the pixels you lost already, but it can get very confusing when you have a lot of windows open since you have to check if you are focusing the correct one before using the menu. It also makes the menu less reachable if you're using a windowed program. It's entirely up to debate whether it is a good idea or not.

There is no clear signalling about which features are included in the first payment and which are not - they let the user accidentally stumble upon them to then present a pop-up advertising a monthly subscription to unlock that feature.

That... is not OK. That's misleading users into thinking they have access to a feature, and then telling them they have to pay extra for it. While this is not exactly a [dark pattern](https://www.darkpatterns.org/) [another explanation on the matter](https://www.howtogeek.com/363484/dark-patterns-when-companies-use-design-to-manipulate-you/), it is reminiscent of that since the little ""plus"" logo that distinguishes these features is not only hard to notice, but something I would expect to find in a free app.

I'm a seasoned Pocket Casts user and I am just sorry to see how it has changed. The original version appealed to users like me who just wanted simplicity: â‚¬4 would get you a simple, lightweight app with a simple layout, no extra features, no extra payments (except for the web version that is a separate program that also costs server time so completely fair), none of the bullshit from other programs. It was *fantastic*. I don't know how many hours I've spent on if, I used to swear by it and I even convinced several people to jump ship to it. After the acquisition it's become the polar opposite of what many of us paid for: a more complicated rewrite with a less intuitive interface and a heavier pushing of further subscriptions (even if at least some of the bugs from the rewrite seem to be gone). How is this different from the free app Player FM? I feel like the premium I've paid for Pocket Casts is no longer worth it now. New version that's the opposite of what you paid for, like it or lump it.

And no, I don't want eternal support and new features for a one-time small payment. In fact, I would be very much content to re-download the version I paid for and only the version I paid for, pre-rewrite, and use that until it stops working in a few Android updates.

When you install something on Windows, you should be, positively, 100% sure you are okay with potentially never being able to remove it. Many programs use this functionality to write keys to the registry when the free trial is over so the user can't keep restarting it, some just forget to remove their stuff for pure incompetence or negligence. Removing programs on Windows is broken and it won't remove them completely. There have been created tools that actually scan the system for leftover files and keys and offer to delete them, but it's absolutely ridiculous that this is even a thing and and even then it doesn't work well.

I like Firefox better ideologically, but I also keep this one around 'cause it's not my fault that Firefox still has awful webGL performance on Linux (even Webrenderer enabled doesn't seem to make it go any faster here), so while I wait for this aspect to get mature on the Linux version, I keep the two browsers.

> Battery life is more often then not terrible out of the box,

This is a catch-22. The manufacturers are to fault because they optimize customer hardware for Windows and not for Linux. But more people need to be on Linux desktop for manufacturers to care

> a application can easily take down your entire x window server

That's a real problem in Wayland, in X it's never happened to me in years but if it does, it's very very easy to recover (the distro itself could add a script to do it itself probably)

> the system becomes unresponsive in low memory situation,

This is true but this is, again, to chalk up mostly to the quality of drivers. On my system the lockups there happen because my computer has a shared bus for CPU, I/O and network board. Swapping is heavy on I/O, which uses the same bus as CPU causing delay. But the real kicker is that my wireless card manufacturer distributes a very shitty driver for Linux that basically keeps its usage to 100% all the time in KWorker. It's constantly accessing the bus and it's slowing it down. The same bus as CPU and IO. The lockups don't happen when I'm offline but what good is being offline. This doesn't happen on Windows because, despite having a shared bus, the manufacturers actually wrote better drivers for Windows and there is no shitty iwlwifi driver monopolizing the bus. The problem would be very much alleviated with just there being better drivers. However, I think a better default should be to use the bfq scheduler with zram on, as this combination alone really helps with the lockups to the point they get extremely rare and it should be default on desktop distros

> browsers still don't support hardware decoding, ...

Which is sadly true, but the browser developers are also to fault, not quite Linux. For Chromium I use a patched version with hardware acceleration forcefully enabled and it works just fine, which means it's just that Google doesn't want to give Linux users an experience on-par yet (I can see the point, it's the same reason why Prime Video won't support Linux in HD: power user OS used by big corporation good, power user OS that puts the users in control of their privacy bad. Giving users something like Linux is extremely bad for the business models of hyper-proprietary services). Mozilla is working on WebRenderer which hopefully will be ready in a few years. Bottom line: hardware decoding in browsers works, it just should be the default.

Most things are there. What we need is more manufacturers caring about Linux more and distros adopting better defaults. It would be a start to include the video acceleration patches in the standard chromium package, for example. So far the best experience to be had on Linux IMO is to use a bare bones distro like Arch and spend some time setting up things that should have been default already, I just wish more desktop distros adopted them."

You're insulting the work of unpaid volunteers who pour their heart into making a DE for the goodness of their hearts and might as well be enjoying more time with their friends and family instead or work extra hours and make more money. In the same spirit, I don't think the maintainers of GNOME, Xfce, or whichever it is that you use, would be happy about their users brigading against other friendly alternative projects. Competitiveness is between two proprietary systems, e.g. Apple and Microsoft. Here on FOSS collaboration is much preferred. Criticism is OK, but it's best when it's taken to the project's bug tracker. Gratuitous insulting with no reasons given is not OK, not productive, not called for and will cause you to be ostracized and deserted by the rest of the community when you display that behaviour.

Which does not invalidate my point, especially seeing some of Window's graphical changes are closer to what KDE was at that point, rather than macOS. It would be quite far-fetched to argue otherwise on things like the flat, white theme that came on Plasma first, everywhere else second.

Thanks for clearing that up.

I know. This is a complicated subject. It can't be a replacement for everybody just yet, but for many people, I think, absolutely.

For fairness's sake. But I know on which subreddit we are, and Reddit being Reddit, the vast majority of the people here are going to have a biased view.

Why would it not also have been inspired by KDE? Noticed I said from KDE, not **exclusively** from KDE. Is there any source for this where in Microsoft personally denied that had taken any inspiration from Plasma but only from macOS?

> I don't want to say its impossible but i would connect the dots there differently what would make the probabilities and conclusion different.

I get what you mean - but I don't think it's the right reason, still. It would actually be demeaning to Microsoft employees to assume they are little more than normal users and only know about macOS of all other operating systems. I'm sure they are aware that Linux exists and of its main desktop environments: their competition is not macOS exclusively, especially with the new improvements and ability to run just about every game except those with intrusive anti-cheat on Linux, desktop Linux is becoming actual competition to Microsoft - a valid Windows alternative that runs on your existing computer and doesn't require you to shell out â‚¬1500+ for a computer that runs it. Many users that don't need exclusive software and for one reason or another don't like Windows would very happily jump ship, it just isn't really popular yet. I'm sure Microsoft's Windows department is aware of this competition and they have already tried it to see what they could learn from it."

Just because it has low exposure can Microsoft not take a look at it and get inspired by it? It would be like saying a hip-hop artist who sampled a rather obscure song (there is nothing wrong with it, but it needs to be noted) and made a hit out of it made a completely original piece of art and were not, in fact, inspired by the less popular song, just because their own song that used the obscure's song sample got more exposure. Exposure has nothing to do with inspiration, and it doesn't make sense to say that, while Plasma integrated some features first, Windows added them later and was absolutely not inspired by it. If you say KDE was inspired from Windows (which the basic layout was), and Windows had added some KDE features later, this relationship goes both ways. It's not that only because Windows is more popular that only the less popular product is inspired by it, that's a very biased view of it."
