BackToCollege,fffdcie,t3_es13is,1579881470.0,"This really depends on how the online course is structured.

If there are scheduled times for live online lectures - then you need to set up a schedule for yourself. They are basically the same as a traditional in-person course, you are just accessing it remotely.  
If there are scheduled times for live online lectures AND they are recorded, they you should attend remotely/live when you can, and review them asynchronously when you can't.

If the lectures are pre-recorded, then view them when convenient for you.

If there are discussion boards that need participation, then keep checking in on them and post GOOD comments (which means something more than 'I agree'). Ask questions in the boards, add thoughtful commentary.

If it is possible to do so, get ahead of the class schedule - real-life stuff will happen

DO NOT wait until the last minute to submit things - the network WILL be hosed on the one day that you try to submit something at 1155 on Tuesday night when the assignment is due before midnight."

If it is the mac app store, try contacting the app author (google the app name). I have seen some that dropped their app from the store, but continue to support it, and willo give you credit if you can prove that you purchased it from apple.

If it is the ios app store, then you are probably screwed. The app may no longer work with the current version of ios, and the author/app store either dropped it or is no longer maintaining it.

BackToCollege,fdh00bk,t3_el64vp,1578412391.0,"For the most part textbook publishing is a complete scam. There is absolutely no good reason for you to have the most current edition of a an algebra/calculus/other math book - the material has not changed significantly since it was invented. What usually changes are the problem sets, and possibly the ordering of some sections in a chapter. 

Tips - 

Do not buy the book in advance, wait until after the first class session to see if it is really needed.

Check with the instructor - the previous edition may be good enough."
BackToCollege,fdgzfzj,t1_fdg1cju,1578412030.0,"Customized books for a specific class are definitely a thing. In my experience they are often composed of chapters from an assortment of different books, which are reprinted by a local academic press. The instructor gives a list of articles to the local press, and they contact the original publishers for reprint rights (for the specific chapters in question). The local press then reprints these chapters into a packet and resells it for a small profit. The advantage is that you as a student are not paying for several books where you would only be reading a few chapters from each."
