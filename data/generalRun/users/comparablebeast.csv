relationships,ffixsgz,t1_ffiwzvd,1579985333.0,"Oh, so you came into it? Yeah....i think this may pose as opportunity for you to learn how to mediate some of that frustration because it sounds like she doesn’t deserve it, even though you haven’t outwardly expressed frustration to her....you’re actually very fortunate that you have managed to find the kinds of dynamics that compliment you, your personality, your lifestyle at home. If this is the one instance that you have where everything isn’t perfect, you’re already ahead. Give it time but just make sure not to be over the top, at least not with her. Don’t force a relationship that isn’t there because that may backfire. Leave the space and invitation there for a deeper relationship to form but still get yourself prepared for the fact that more likely than not, this is as good as it’s going to get. It may be too early to say"
relationships,ffiww6f,t3_etw4g6,1579984685.0,"My advice is time. You didn’t mention how long she’s been living there or even whether any of you knew her prior to her living there but time is the best factor. You can’t force relationships and despite how much you may want her to fall into this category of people you’ve been able to surround yourself with, it may end up being that she won’t ever fall into it. Which is okay and you do have to accept when/if you do come to realize that. But time is the best tool you have, that an experience. But what I’ve learned is that you can’t expect to supplement experiences (movie nights, bike rides) for relationship development. In theory, why wouldn’t these things make people the best of friends but in practice....it’s not always that easy.

First, did he actually say that he thought you were too loose or are you putting words into his mouth?

Two, are you doing kegals because you wanted to or as a reaction to insecurities stemming from this issue with your husband?

Three....it’s definitely possible to get desensitized by sex toys, although I say that in the context of a woman with a vibratory. Some fleshlights vibrate and so if that’s the case with the one with your husband, perhaps that could be a factor? I can’t say got certain but this kind of issue warrants more deeper discussions as to why you feel the way you feel and brainstorming new techniques or approaches to your sex life that satisfies you both

You’ve got to find ways to work out why you give a shit. She’s with you, not with them and if that’s not good enough for you, you know the alternative.

It’s a tough spot. 

Thinking outside the box....last resort, maybe you could intervene and talk to the girl? Maybe you could convince her that this relationship is toxic and if she had any respect for your friend (or herself for that matter) she’d do them both a favor and walk away? Idk of reasoning with her is even possible but maybe a little reverse psychology can help? Idek how likely it is that that would work but I think if I had a friend who I saw was basically disintegrated in front of my eyes and I rationalized that it was their SO that was largely to blame, I’d risk my friendship or whatever hard feelings to be had and say something to the SO. Tell them you hate how much they’re destroying this person you love, that they’re no good or better off not in this kind of relationship, that they’re both better off without each other.

CasualConversation,fen87xl,t3_eq2nzh,1579279111.0,"Nah dude...alcohol sucks. I’ve got other drugs of choice that I consider to be a better use of my time if I’m trying to not live the reality of “the everyday”.

But alcohol is relatively cheap for its impact I’d say and widely available. Think of it as the nighttime cousin to coffee, its availability drives its appeal. I think the proportion of people who don’t partake in ANYTHING is low compared to those who do, even out of the select people who feel as though they’re confident enough with life and whatever the fuck else in order to live without any type of consumption...

But you know the saying “everyone has a vice”. Yours just doesn’t happen to be alcohol."
relationship_advice,femz57y,t1_femhc87,1579273303.0,"Is he someone who needs like psychiatric intervention? Or maybe if that’s a bit extreme for his case, would he be open to seeing someone about all the shit he’s going through?

If he’s never seen someone for anything mental health related it can seem daunting...a lot of vulnerabilities you’re forced to confront but it may be a tool worth talking to your friend about. Especially if he’s losing his mind and constantly exposed to instability (on-and-off again nature of his “relationship”). That’s a mind fuck for anyone but it could help him to see someone and gain clarity.

It sounds cheesy, I used to really feel the same way, whenever people suggest therapists but there’s a reason why. Also, if he does have depression....he needs better support (you sound like an AWESOME friend) from someone whose equipped to deal with everything that depression entails. It ca take him to some dark places and if you are concerned for him in that sense, talk about it. You’re his friend, show him that you’re seriously worried about him, that you want to see him doing better for himself and maybe you can’t convince him of anything in regards to his gf, but there are healthier ways to be in a relationship and therapy/medication (he may have some undiagnosed condition) could help with that."

relationship_advice,felpp70,t3_eptqv8,1579227918.0,"Don’t date her then. You can send her the message and plead your case but it’s ultimately up to her whether that’s something she’ll agree to. Not commenting on the underaged part of this, although I know experimentation is a thing so it’s even more important that whatever she does she’s as responsible as she can be, but the majority of the world partakes in some form of drinking and to a high degree, most are not abusive alcoholics who don’t drink responsibly. 

To say you’ll never associate with those that drink is a boundary worth setting for yourself but if we really think about it, it’s unrealistic. To also say you don’t want to date someone who drinks is a great boundary to have but I think that makes it obvious that you and your girlfriend should not be dating if that’s the case."

Also wtf does that even mean “I like meat but I don’t support it because of cruelty...I don’t care what he eats” yet you feel some type of way about what he orders?

Pay for your own meal, let him do the same from now on if you don’t want to pay for his choice of meal."

You don’t have to be fit, you don’t have to work out all the time or even most of the time but it sounds like you stopped taking care of yourself in a way and allowed your insecurities to get the better of you. It happens to all of us...but if you haven’t been putting effort into yourself or your marriage as far as intimacy goes then it’s time for some serious reflection.

And if you didn’t reach out to them at all to let them know of your situation or ask them for advice on how to not pay at the time, then I don’t think you have a leg to stand on. You’re most likely going to end up having to pay. Have you reached out to the school’s billing department to ask what your options are? If not, I’d suggest doing so...."

If he won’t then looks like he’s found himself a no effort long term relationship. Congrats to him."
