ContagiousLaughter,ffjpifl,t1_ffiprqv,1580003703.0,"You are right.  One could make almost anything a racial issue if they use malice.  It doesn't even have to be racial to be hurtful.  I was once told in video game to ""shut up because you sound like a fucking chipmunk."" LOL  Years later, I still laugh about it.  

As seen in the video and my experiences in life, it's all in good fun.  If someone wants to be toxic, I don't have to allow them in my life."
ContagiousLaughter,ffinsln,t1_ffimpwn,1579978316.0,"Um, who considers it racist?  People that likely take things too seriously.  I laugh at my own accent and when others laugh at my pronunciation of certain words.  My foreign born husband of the same ethnicity pokes fun at my pronunciation of words all the time.  I don't consider it a racial issue at all. 

Embrace your differences and similarities."

The problem with sending the young ones off to elementary is that certain ideologies are pushed on them - quite early these days.  Those ideologies may not fit your morals and values, so be mindful of that. 

In fact, that's the reason I made the decision to start homeschooling this year.  My first graders were being subjected to questionable material."

Is this true for most parents?  Not from my experience.  Will my children eventually say these words?  Most likely.  Will I encourage them to say these things or give them unfiltered access to media or exploit them for internet points?  No."
