Democrats the party of gimme gimme I need I need but don’t use my money take it from the people who actually worked for it. Your views are so flawed you aren’t worth my time. Then you wanna act like you are so appalled that I ( who you don’t know) would vote differently from you. That’s how it works in this country different views and opinions expressed through voting. You are a fuckin sheep wake up. I’ll come back here in a few months when Trump is not impeached and by the will of the people he gets elected to a second term. Mark my words
