There's one vocaloid-esque character, but she's a support character, so you'll basically just be talking to her to do various weapon and skills related upgrade things. One of the party has a sort-of dark-Miku look to her default battle outfit, but you can change that eventually, and the character herself is no Miku. If you liked the j-pop music in Zombie Land Saga, you'll probably also like the music in this.

I came at this from the opposite - never played any Persona games (except Persona Q), but have played a lot of the SMT ones. I'm not entirely sure it neatly fits into SMT style gameplay or Persona style gameplay. It certainly has aspects of SMT. You can have the MC wearing a version of Joker's outfit - altho it looks odd with his eyes.

I'm a systems administrator - so I look after the servers (mostly all virtual) and some networking and firewalls. I don't have the right mindset for development, but I do do a lot of scripting to automate stuff. I also do some third line support for our helpdesk and I guess informally mentor them.

At present if it was offered I would consider working a second day from home, but no more than that. As it is, if I genuinely need to work from home I can (as an example, something happened on the way into work a few Fridays ago, which triggered a massive breakdown, which prompted my boss to suggest I work from home that day and to not over exert myself). The main reason I wouldn't want to work from home more than that at present is my team. I work with a bunch of talented, nice, thoughtful people that make even the worst days bearable. If that changed, I'd want to work from home more.

I've just remembered another accommodation - which is my seating position. I'm sat right at the end of the row of desks, away from the corridor, so I don't have people walking past and only have someone sat on one side of me.

It also helps that the company is fairly committed to looking after its staff and making sure everyone feels included and is treated equally. And it seems to be a genuine commitment, not just a publicity stunt."

How meaningful it would feel depends on where you work. If what the company does doesn't align with what you find meaningful then there will be something missing, I think, however good the job is.

From what you've written I don't think you'll feel satisfied if you settle for something that's less stressful but less meaningful just to pay the bills. Unless maybe you did that part time and found something else to part time that was more meaningful. But my personal experience is taking a job just to pay the bills is incredibly draining.

I've been in IT for nearly 3 decades - I started off in private sector which was OK-ish. The work was interesting, but because the companies I worked for were purely commercial enterprises, it was ultimately unfulfilling. My current and previous job are/were in the 3rd sector (charities, not for profits etc) and I far prefer it. I stayed at my last place a lot longer than I should have simply because I believed in what the company was doing. My current place is a not-for-profit arts venue (concert hall, two smaller music/talk venues and a gallery) and I love it there. I work from home one day a week and in the office the other 4. I've been able to shift my hours to avoid the rush hour, and whilst the office is open plan and can get noisy, no-one bats an eyelid if I put head phones on, or go and work in the server room.

I got a formal dx as an adult. I'm exaggerating a bit, but it changed everything and nothing.

Everything because I now had an explanation as to why I react and behave like I do, and suddenly past behaviours made sense. Because I had a better way of explaining my poor communication skills (I can apparently be way too blunt) than just saying I have a poor brain/mouth filter. Because I had a better way to explain other behaviours. Because being able to give more neuro-typical people a medical label helps them understand me better and thus makes it easier to get along with them. And because it freed me to be more myself.

And nothing because despite all of that I'm still me. All the behavioural and situational challenges are still there. Things that could trigger a meltdown pre diagnosis can still trigger a meltdown post diagnosis. I still have a tendency to be way too blunt.

Generally they do want to help people, but this is basically all they can do. Many years ago GPs would do the referrals for you - I don't know why that changed, but even the most sympathetic GP will give you the info so you can self refer.

Meds can and do help. They take a while to kick in, and it can take a while to find the right ones for you, but if you are depressed enough to have constant suicidal thoughts then you should seriously consider taking them. The right ones will not change who you are or turn you into a zombie or anything - they'll smooth things out so your emotions are more even.

If you are seriously considering suicide (and there is a difference between constant suicidal thoughts and actually having the desire to go through with it) then either go to A&E and tell them or call the Samaritans (116 123 - their website is [https://www.samaritans.org/how-we-can-help/contact-samaritan/](https://www.samaritans.org/how-we-can-help/contact-samaritan/))."
