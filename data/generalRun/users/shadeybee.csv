DnD,ffw2ig4,t3_evexxn,1580281530.0,"Just to add a bit of the lore reasoning to what’s been said - Dragonmarks are a major part of the Eberron setting. In Eberron, the 100 year war has just ended, and the major factions were not just various countries but also the Dragonmarked Houses, which are “neutral” organizations that function like corporations. Most of them made a LOT of money in the war, so they have a lot of power.

Dragonmarks are passed down through family bloodlines, and if you have one you belong to that specific House, with all of the complications, loyalties, and obligations that may entail."

PCAcademy,ffue7fk,t1_ffua35y,1580240095.0,"if you want to lean into the ""learning about her past"" angle, you could pick Archaeologist. I dunno if Noble fits if you're going to say she was raised in the woods like the movie, but you don't have to go that way. She could also easily be an Exile or a Hermit. Inheritor works as well (the amulet!).

PCAcademy,ffu4t3i,t3_ev8ou9,1580234499.0,"Probably a struggle with disbelief, at first. Everything, everyone is gone? How? She will want proof. And then, she might be very interested in the history of her people, what happened to them, why is her kingdom gone, etc. Maybe a little bit sentimental, keeps things that remind her of home even if they're useless.

In the Disney version, she's raised in the woods by faeries, so you might seek out Feywild connections for help, and just in general have an affinity for animals and nature.

Maybe she wants revenge on whoever was responsible for the curse? Or for wiping her kingdom out? If it was a long time ago, you might not have a lot of options there, though. She might end up just having to let the past... go.

And depending on how closely you hew to the Disney version, she would barely even know she was royalty, and certainly wasn't raised that way, so that's something to think about in terms of how responsible she'd feel for what happened."
Aquariums,ffnvrtg,t3_euc8zi,1580071463.0,"In general, do a lot of googling and cross checking, really. 

You can search “stocking 20 gallon” for ex. in this sub for a lot of ideas (and see what people think are bad ideas), check the min. requirements for the species you are interested in on Seriouslyfish, and there is a website called aqadvisor that can give you an approximation of whether you have too many fish or incompatibilities.

I don’t have any super good advice but I see you haven’t gotten replies yet. I suspect the main answer is go slow.

Have you seen this video of a somewhat aggressive dog being counter-conditioned?

https://youtu.be/sI13v9JgJu0

Can you give him just some positive quiet time around a human?  Give him a safe place in a quiet spot if you can. Sit quietly and throw treats away from yourself. Don’t ask him to be touched or anything. 

I found this short article and it advises the same as a place to start:

Dogtraining,fdk6xqf,t3_els0rv,1578497475.0,I think this is less that he’s thinking about it that way and more that you’ve taught him a specific behavior in that circumstance = reward / attention. It’s basically a trick.

Can you find a recording / youtube of a similar sound, and play it at home, at a low volume? Practice short sessions at a volume he tolerates + give treats. Then slowly increase the volume. That's the usual rec. for ""scared of sounds.""   


Someone on an older similar thread, but for thunder recommended an app:  
 [https://www.reddit.com/r/Dogtraining/comments/e3v157/how\_to\_train\_my\_dog\_to\_dont\_be\_soooo\_scared\_with/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Dogtraining/comments/e3v157/how_to_train_my_dog_to_dont_be_soooo_scared_with/)"
Dogtraining,fdhm6l7,t3_elcla0,1578425597.0,"\-Use treats / toys / play / pets (things your dog likes) to reward her. Later on, if you're worried about her only listening when you have a treat,  start asking her to do things when you have something hidden nearby (in an airtight container on a shelf, in your pocket, etc). If she listens, then SURPRISE she gets a reward even though it looked like you had nothing! You could have something great any time! Dogs are gamblers. If there's a good chance she'll get something good out of listening to you, she will.  


\-Make sure to teach her what you do want her to do. Punishing a dog for an undesired behavior can be unclear to them, but ""don't do that, do this"" is much easier to understand and work on. Reward behaviors that are incompatible with the undesired behavior. Ex. - Always rushing out the door? Ask her to sit, then open it. If she gets up before the door is all the way open, close it. Start over. Only polite sitting puppies get to go through.  


 \-I would also look into ""capturing calmness,"" because it just helps your dog choose to be calm. This video explains it pretty good:  
[https://youtu.be/wesm2OpE\_2c](https://youtu.be/wesm2OpE_2c) 

\-Look up the Premack Principle and try to incorporate it into your training. Here's an ok article about it:  
 [https://www.akc.org/expert-advice/training/what-is-the-premack-principle-in-dog-training/](https://www.akc.org/expert-advice/training/what-is-the-premack-principle-in-dog-training/)   
My dog didn't like to come back inside from playing in the backyard, so we practiced:   
Calling him to the door, give him a treat, and then send him back out.   
He learned that listening was a double reward 9/10 times - treat + he gets to go back to what he wanted to do! Very quickly he would come running inside.  


\-Look up some training / trick vids on youtube w/ positive reinforcement. Kikopup and Zak George are both pretty good.

\-Lastly, dominance training can be dangerous (bc the point is to make the dog fear you, and fearful dogs bite) and damaging to your relationship with your dog. So it's really great that you're looking into more modern training. If you feel like some extra reading, here's an article with videos that contrasts the approaches in a useful way:

You can dump the water you don’t need first, then have one bucket for the water / plants / etc you’re keeping sitting until you’re ready, and another bucket for the gravel you’re taking out. Yay buckets hahaha.

You can also try bitter apple spray on some things but if she’s stealing just regular items off the counter / dresser you may have to treat it like counter surfing for food- nothing in reach bc every time she snags something fun to chew it’s self rewarding.

Also if you’re doing mostly active training / tricks make sure to work in some self control exercises. Look up how to teach “settle”, capturing calmness, and the relaxation protocol."
