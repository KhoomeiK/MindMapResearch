Makeup,ff341m9,t1_fewmm42,1579533134.0,"Since there's no hard rules on what you can call a product in the cosmetic industry, I've found that BB, CC and even foundation all get used interchangeably. 

The only time I've seen a real difference is with Tinted Moisturizers, since that's exactly all they are, tinted. 

I mean the IT CC is heavier than any foundation I use, yet it's called a CC."
Makeup,feyhhus,t1_fewet0q,1579445643.0,"Tarte Amazonian Clay foundation stick is not super thick, not at all. It's pretty thin for a stick foundation. Much thinner than Bare Minerals Complexion Rescue stick actually. I have both and prefer the Tarte.

Oh, if you're talking about the liquid foundations, disregard my comment cause I have no idea."
Rosacea,feu8qh8,t1_fetrd5u,1579384252.0,"Same.   
My face also hated La Roche-Posay Toleraine Hydrating cleanser as well. They were all too drying for me."
Rosacea,feu5viw,t3_eqkt4i,1579383381.0,"I use Finacea which is 15% Azelaic Acid.   
My derm (both old, and new) said to apply it after you wash your face, just dry first. Use a very small amount as well. Wait 20 minutes and apply your moisturizer. My first derm was adamant about not using vaseline or anything that's a heavy occlusive. Not sure if it was related to the Finacea or not though.

My skin is normal-dry."
dogs,fek3gnn,t3_epi99u,1579191805.0,"I don't know the laws in Australia, but in the states it varies by what the regulations are, and that differs county to count, state to state. 

From what you wrote though, it seems he's dog aggressive, that's it. Mine don't like most other dogs either. So you know what I don't do? I don't let them off lead around other dogs. It's really simple. It's not something I'd chance just because they haven't bit another dog before.

If I were you, I would give him to a rescue where they can place him in a home that has no other dogs. Rescues do this all the time. From what you said, he just needs to be the only dog. 

Hopefully the puppy survives this."
dogs,fek39on,t1_fek1v8r,1579191688.0,"u/helleraine exactly! well said. 

My two dogs are not dog friendly, but they love kids. One has nothing to do with the other. What the hell's wrong with people making such a horrible assumption."
dogs,fehbj9f,t3_ep5ems,1579113163.0,One of my bulldogs starts doing his best Chewbacca imitation if I'm more than 5 minutes late with his dinner. He cries and whines like he's being abused until he gets his dinner served. I always know I'm late when he starts doing the Chewy.
dogs,feecx7l,t1_feebrne,1579031173.0,"I know!! I think lots of people just let their dogs wander outside of the house. They assume they'll stay close to home but many of course won't. 

My guys are not dog friendly so they're always on lead. The only time they're allowed outside unsupervised is when they're on the deck.  No one's getting out."
dogs,feebhzv,t3_eomrod,1579030343.0,"Agreed. 

One of mine was re-homed to us. When he was 13 months old, the owners wife decided she no longer wanted a dog- that it was too much upkeep and fur everywhere. This guy was left at a dog trainers house. The dog trainer was working with our other guy and asked us if we wanted another bulldog. I was either us, or rescue so we took him. 

Two weeks later he winded up in veterinary hospital with aspiration/pneumonia for two nights getting critical care. Our rescued boy cost us over 4k in the first two weeks. I think they gave him up because they knew he had breathing issues and didn't want to pay for the surgery he needed (brachycephalic surgery.) 

I f'ing hate people. I hate people that buy/ or rescue a dog because they think they're cute, or their partner wants a dog. 

Earlier today someone posted on FB how her dog was bitten by an off-lead dog. The owners of the off-lead dog rescued her and it turns out she's dog aggressive. Now they're debating putting her down.  Instead of muzzle training her, and keeping her on-lead, they set her up for failure and now blame the dog. Seriously, I hate people."
dogs,feaatzf,t3_eo5tdp,1578946404.0,"Where do these asinine people come from? Seriously??!! How is it even possible to breed such an idiot human?! Wow.   
It's incredible how many cartoon characters I've been running into, and hearing about lately. Just idiots. 

Anyway, sorry for the rant. I would just tell her point blank a dog is expensive, just the food bill alone would require they spend at least an extra 100 a month. Even idiots understand $$$ - and it's a good deterrent."
Rosacea,fdroxy1,t3_emwgv3,1578687606.0,"I have two different supergoops and like both, but neither are tinted.

Only thing is, you still have to use 1/4 teaspoon just for your face to get the full SPF. That's one of the reasons I don't rely on tinted sunscreens- I just can't put that much of them on."
Rosacea,fdnkg9c,t1_fdnako9,1578587676.0,"Spot on u/Didi661

Of course Cancer and Rosacea aren't the same. But that doesn't mean a medical doctor should be dismissing of a Rosacea patient. No one knows how it's affecting someones quality of life, or mental health. 

Hell, when I have a flare and my face burns for 3 days straight, you can bet it's serious to me, and I wouldn't appreciate an indifferent/blasé type of response from a medical professional, just because they deal with worse. Who wants someone like that for a doctor? not I."
Rosacea,fdn0l9w,t3_em2qpb,1578573545.0,"Some doctors have no patient skills.  I think that's all it is.

When I get a doctor that makes me feel like I'm a piece of meat on an assembly line, I find a new doctor. Here, that's not a problem for me."
Rosacea,fdi6exm,t1_fdi04o2,1578436552.0,"Inflammation is what causes the redness (subtype 1) because your capillaries become dilated. 
Inflammation can also cause bumps. 
Everyone's different, but all symptoms and subtypes of Rosacea are caused because of inflammation."
Rosacea,fdfeutu,t3_el0rxo,1578360048.0,"I don't think it's cute at all.

It means inflammation, and if the inflammation isn't controlled, it leads to broken capillaries, plaque, and/or bumps. Plus for many of us there's a burning sensation associated with the redness. 

That's the thing with Rosacea type 1,  it's not just about rosy cheeks"
Makeup,fde8kjw,t1_fdcsboq,1578333544.0,"I think it varies depending on the location and person. But I've had both types of experiences - being ignored, and having someone ask if I need help.

I will say this, the Sephora near me is full of assholes. Not one person has ever bothered to even look my way. It's in the financial district so they're packed at certain hoursn and it can definitely be stressful to work there. Still, if you don't know how to deal with customers, then you shouldn't be working with them."
Makeup,fd5u7m9,t3_ek3hq0,1578181561.0,"I was Sephora Rouge, then dropped to VIB this year. Realized Sephora is over hyped BS.

1. Their 20% sales for Rouge a few times a year are BS since all the brands they carry have the same, or better sales throughout the year, and most stick samples with their orders.  Their points system is absolute crap. By the time you get enough points for something decent, they'll be out of it, and you'll be shit out of luck, hoping next week something good drops again, and you'll get it in time.

ULTA- Much better points program that add up fast, especially if you get their CC (I have their MC, but only use it at ULTA), as you get twice the points. They also have specials throughout the year that can get you 5x the points on certain items. In other words, you wind up saving much more at ULTA, than you do at Sephora.  And the higher your tier, the more points you get for each dollar spent. 

Downside with Ulta is it doesn't carry all the brands Sephora does. But it doesn't really matter as you can always just buy a product from the brand directly, and most likely at a better price than at Sephora since brands have their own sales throughout the year.

There's also Beautylish and Space NK, who offer the same brands as Sephora and have better reward programs. 

For me, I recently started buying from Dermstore. They carry skincare brands that Sephora and Ulta don't like Replenix, and SkinCeuticals, while still carrying brands like Sunday Riley and First Aid Beauty and make up brands. Plus,  many brands offer 10% off your purchase if you save it to favorites. This is huge for me as I'm an avid Replenix Sunscreen user, and that 10% off every time I buy (and no, they don't ship it automatically for the discount), is huge for me. Better than anything Ulta or Sephora have."
