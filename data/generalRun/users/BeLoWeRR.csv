graffhelp,ffb8p3h,t1_ffb8nuo,1579755241.0,"I’d say 2+ cans black if you don’t trust yourself, roller fills are always fun. if you have a basic color, try grabbing a spray in that same color to clean it up"
graffhelp,ffb8fst,t1_ffb8dkd,1579754928.0,"Experiment with what works for you, for me, I know I can bust out a 4 letter fill solid color with 2.5 cans, i’m comfortable with 3. 2 for outline, and then 1 each for aura, background, inlines and 3D. And then scraps for extra. But i’ve been painting a while so i’ve got the routine down"
graffhelp,ffb8cnb,t1_ffb89zv,1579754831.0,One more thing is don’t plan out dimensions like you did on the top left because it almost never goes according to plan
graffhelp,ffb8btz,t1_ffb89zv,1579754805.0,"Definitely felt that. If you have spray( i’m assuming this is roller fill) try some cracks out. The biggest thing with blockbusters like this, is CLEANLINESS. Cut backs on lines and consistency in width is what separates you from a toy"

graffhelp,ffb86tg,t3_esjbtl,1579754660.0,No disrespect but it’s literally just block letters there isn’t much you can do as far as making it “better” that one of us can tell you
graffhelp,ffb7ux1,t3_esnpq6,1579754342.0,"Keep bars same width and consistency. Check out the left of the A. Thicken our the outside of your letters.  CUT BACKS on the inside.

A is too too heavy, top left, too skinny bottom left. As others mentioned definitely make that T pop more"

IBEW,ff2d4by,t1_ff00nwz,1579501326.0,Been with a waterproofing company for about 4 months now and this post makes me wanna quit. We jackhammer and drill through 50-70 year old concrete on a daily basis. No safety precautions except a shop vac on a jackhammer that captures some dust. This thread makes me wanna quit before it’s too late.

facepalm,fellemp,t1_fel7aqz,1579224968.0,When i went to college the professors explained this and said the homework was more about trying than it was about getting it perfect. If your #2 was different than my #2 but you answered the question correctly all my profs except one would just give the person full credit
