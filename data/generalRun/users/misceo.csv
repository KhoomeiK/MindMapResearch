as for homelessness in austin - even though that’s not the issue here - i think the recent steps the city has taken to address the issue are good steps, e.g. using available resources at the state level, build additional housing units with the sole purpose of rehabilitation/stabilization for folks dealing with addiction (a large part of that undertaking is increased access to proper mental health, but that’s more of a national issue at this stage), and continue to have discussion around it. while these positive steps will likely draw in more folks suffering from homelessness, i don’t take any issue with the compassion going on or my tax dollars supporting that. 

saying you want to live in a “nice community that your kids can play” is the same as saying you’re scared and you don’t want anything to happen to it/them. it’s not the worst thing to be motivated by, but recognize it for what it is. you’re indirectly saying that immigrants, refugees, and asylum seekers will only deteriorate your community. pretty narrow-minded.
