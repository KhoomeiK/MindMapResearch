Maybe, just maybe having a girlfriend isnt the right thing, I dont know why you both broke up but if its even slightly related to your depression or condition then I think she made the right choice, you need to make yourself better and find some info online and straight up lose your pride and humility when pursuing a future at your position.

The system sucks, whatever we have been taught may be morally right but that didnt prepare us to deal with cheats and assholes, its like using the highway in the morning to get to work, we because we follow the law take the normal route, while some asshole at work would take the express lane or commuter lane and get to work early or on time, that makes the person look good and sets them up for promotions while we who followed the rules get written strikes because we were late and could even get yelled at for never being able to arrive on time which gets us on the bad side of whoever is in charge for something we cant control.

I know life isnt fair but damn it if it doesn't fuckin punish those who deserve it. America is fucked over, most of the world is fucked over because of people like this, and countries that dont have this problem are either forgotten or thier government style is taught to not be workable anywhere else.
