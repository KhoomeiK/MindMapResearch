depression,ffa7e75,t3_esbfsf,1579729326.0,"I knew i had my issues but i just realized my first reaction to this makes me a super shitty person. Reading through your post made me cringe, i didnt feel sorry for you, i did resonate with some of the things you said but mostly  just got the feeling that even though you say your mind is set on killing yourself, you still feel the need to tell everyone, which means you do want help. You just probably dont think anyone CAN help you. But it also means, to me, you are hard seeking attention. And i cant not look down on you a little for that, given how sincere you seem to be, id figure youd just do it. Not seek attention about it first."
