Obviously there are some risks but worst case is that they'd get picked up by soldiers and sent back out of the zone.

I show you true radiation!"" and ran down to the riverbed where he held the geiger counter up to a piece of concrete.

history,fe017j2,t3_en9nil,1578800559.0,"The midlands were the heart of the industrial revolution in England. In the space of less than 50 years it was transformed from a collection of small villages and rolling green hills to a blackened hell. 

It was very impactful on JRR Tolkein who grew up near Birmingham in a place like Hobbiton, with a little mill and farmsteads and houses, when he returned as an adult it had been surrounded by ugly factories spewing ash and smoke. The fields were coated in thick layers of ash inches deep. The entire region is still referred to as ""The Black Country"" because of the mass scale pollution. 

In 1830 a man named James Nasmyth wrote on his impressions of the black country. 

""The black country is anything but picturesque. The earth seems to have been turned inside out. Its entrails are strewn about; nearly the entire surface of the ground is covered with cinder heaps and mounds of scoriae. The coal which has been drawn from below the ground is blazing on the surface. The district is crowded with iron furnaces, puddling furnaces, and coal-pit engine furnaces. By day and night the country is glowing with fire, and the smoke of the ironworks hovers over it. There is a rumbling and clanking of iron forges and rolling mills. Workmen covered with smut, and fierce white eyes, are seen moving about amongst the glowing iron and the dull thud of forge-hammers."" 

This goes to show how corrupted the most industrial areas in Britain were. Queen Victoria drew her curtains when her train passed through the area."
learndota2,fdzymy6,t3_en7djt,1578798983.0,"Clockwerk is my go-to offlaner for his great toolkit, really good pick off potential against carries but most often supports in the backlines and in laning phase. 

He has a lot of different playstyles in how you build him. Itemwise you usually go for the same few things, phase boots, blademail, aghs, force staff. But with levelling if you max battery (the most common build) you can kill most immobile heroes in the game at level 6 by walking them down or hookshotting them. 

With max cogs (the least common) you can keep burning the health and mana of your laning opponents, especially melee cores. This makes laning as someone like jug or slark really annoying because you're forced away from last hits. 


Maxing rocket flare early is a really fun build because you can get great snipes across the map or vision and just farm globally for the entire game, plus talents improving the damage mean you can keep defending towers by blasting the creeps even when you're walking back to base. 

He's a very fun hero and mastering the skillshot of hookshot is tricky but rewarding when you hit the perfect TP cancel in trees with no vision or catch the antimage just as he's about to blink away. 

As clock really don't need much gold to be as useful as your midlaner and you tank a lot of damage, since you build into armor and hp items and then get a magic resistance talent. 

Of course he has a few strong counters but since he is a hard counter to pudge who is in almost every low mmr game I'm sure you're going to more than an even match."
