It was super nice of you to take an interest.

Ill definitely give the self help thing a try and I'll stick to it.

My school offers conselling but I think it's for people with real problems like bad home life and shit so I always feel too ashamed to ask for help from them when really my life is pretty good.

It's so hard to be kind to myself but I try and sometimes it's just too much and I can't help but hate myself. You have ideas on how to help becauae this self doubt and self hate is like wrecking my life.
