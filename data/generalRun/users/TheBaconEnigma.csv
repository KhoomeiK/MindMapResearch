college,ffaw9yb,t1_ff9s8jb,1579745961.0,"Thank you, I am doing most of this out of interest instead of just a mad dash to fill my schedule with stuff to do, which I see as a definite plus on my end. I suck at time management so I’m hoping that I won’t wear myself out to the point that I slack off on schoolwork in an attempt to relax and take time to myself. One of my friends had also suggested taking a look at everything"
college,ffaw33o,t1_ff9vvav,1579745834.0,I’ve only been to one meeting so far as it’s a new semester. The second meeting for me is tomorrow. Essentially there were anime themed games like guess the character and stuff like that as sort of group icebreakers. I know that they do polls on what genre or what specific anime they will be  watching as a group for a majority of the meetings.
college,ff9aowi,t1_ff95bkm,1579708670.0,Yes!
AskReddit,ff90yu6,t1_ff8z35w,1579702088.0,"That depends, I’m not too well versed on really how to do anything so I would be learning as I go. Which isn’t ideal for survival. I was in the Boy Scouts but it’s not like I can call all of what’ve learned like 5 years ago on a whim. And I would probably stay away from them. For all I know I could be infected myself and if they aren’t then why put them at risk. And vice versa."
AskReddit,ff8zd5r,t3_esc219,1579700824.0,Well when I sit on my phone on Reddit I face away usually but other than that I sort of spin around in circles trying to get my entire body to wash.
AskReddit,ff8zar1,t3_esc21r,1579700772.0,Accept bribes to vote for people other than my parents during their workplace holiday competitions where they decorated their desks. Honestly over the years I’ve just come to feel ashamed. I’ve tried making it up to them and myself but the memory remains.
AskReddit,ff8z7g2,t3_esc21y,1579700698.0,"Well. I asked my first girlfriend out by sitting in a stairwell in my high school with the orange she carried around all day with her in the proposal position offering the orange to her. I had to say „Name, Will you be my girlfriend“ and I had to do that a few times before she said yes. Honestly it was the wildest experience of my life. Relationship only lasted a week but I broke it off because I found out I was moving."
AskReddit,ff8yzsm,t3_esc24y,1579700526.0,"I have to say I would probably go out into the country and try my best to learn how to fend for myself out in the wilderness. Best case scenario I survive, worst case scenario I don’t. But if it’s human to human contact then you’re less likely to find humans out in the wilderness."
EmpireDidNothingWrong,festp8z,t1_fesje3t,1579368917.0,Is it actually worth it?

AskReddit,fefnemg,t1_fefn2km,1579060127.0,Thank you!
AskReddit,fefmw48,t1_fefmd34,1579059786.0,"Danke! Das ist gut! I’ve visited Germany many years ago when I lived in Italy. Mainly around the Garmisch area, it was beautiful. The language had also always intrigued me. HopefullyI will be able to study abroad in Germany in 2021 :)"
AskReddit,fefm575,t3_eoma58,1579059293.0,Wie Geht‘s? :) (im an American but learning the German Language and I’ve always wanted to go back to Germany and talk to Germans)

depression,fdjz1oo,t3_elqlff,1578491866.0,I’m glad for you!
AskReddit,fdixe0e,t3_eld4mi,1578453208.0,I had my compute privileges taken away for looking at pictures of Adam and Eve for a school project. They knew what it was for but their pride got in the way.
BreakUps,fdfu02e,t1_fdecawu,1578370179.0,"I know that feeling. In my case I lost my pillar of emotional support so I was lost for a few weeks, I couldn’t pick myself up or thing straight and I just cried. I’m getting better and trying to branch out more, it helps a lot that I have made a new best friend here in college. Unfortunately he’s a senior so he’ll be leaving soon. I would say to just try and keep it nonchalant, don’t press yourself to put effort in and just say what you want and get it over with. If you like talking with each other then burning bridges isn’t a good idea and if things don’t work out between her and her new person then you’re still there to provide support. Just be you, be her friend but don’t allow her to be the center of your life. I’m sure it’ll work out"
BreakUps,fdeburr,t1_fdebc8b,1578335619.0,"Oh wow. Well, look at it this way, she didn’t really say that she wouldn’t talk to you, it may be implied but you have time to at least talk and be on good terms. If she completely stops talking to you if she gets serious then she wasn’t worth having back in your life anyway. Maybe she just means that you both will be able to talk but not as much. Obviously only time will tell here but if things go south and need a random internet stranger to rant to then I’ll be here for you. I’m sure we all would be. Try and stay positive, I’m sure everything will work themselves out :)"
BreakUps,fde8ooh,t1_fdds562,1578333617.0,"I understand you there. Perhaps the best thing is to not trust it if you don’t think she’s being sincere. Maybe you both can just be on good terms but not be best friends, rather be old friends that get along and talk every now and again. I wouldn’t know how it would be to have an ex coming back to me since I’m usually the one that tries to go back and make sure things end on good terms. Follow your gut. Whatever you decide is best for you then do it, you got this."
depression,fddnc0o,t3_eko57p,1578318554.0,"It’s fantastic until it falls apart. I can’t say I’m super depressed passively but I am generally apathetic and honestly couldn’t care less if I died most the time. My latest relationship pulled me out of that and I had a reason to live, I loved her but I messed things up one too many times and she left. She’s completely cut me out of her life at this point and I’m struggling with it. It’s nice while it lasts but if it doesn’t then the immediate aftermath is hard to move forward through. One day I am sure you will find someone that is meant for you, that is a cheesy common phrase but don’t be afraid to extend your wings and try. You’ve got this, I believe in you."
depression,fddmgbj,t1_fdbmvzn,1578317740.0,"I understand this fully. I pushed through and tried not to completely let go because we both wanted to be friends but something changed and about two weeks ago they told me they no longer wanted me in their life and didn’t even want to try being friends. It didn’t sting as much because I was honestly expecting something like that to happen, Milo Murphy’s Law and all that, but it’s sort of a dull pain that I’m trying to not let being me back to square one of getting over them."
depression,fddm3eg,t3_ekfp0m,1578317398.0,"My sleep sucks sometimes because I get to dream about the reason I got to slip back into my depression instead of not dreaming like I usually do. Breakups suck and my body feels the need to remind me of what I lost every other night when I go to sleep. It’s dreams of me and then getting back together, of me and then actually talking again, of me and them avoiding each other but wanting to communicate. It’s essentially a reflection of the deep desires I’m trynna forget about.  These things tend to happen, but it sure doesn’t help my usual passive depression."

dndmemes,fby75sy,t1_fby1q5r,1577209732.0,"The most sexual thing my bard has done was play for money at a giant NPC sex party. Other than that he’s literally just the dude who tries and mostly fails to use charisma to talk their way out of things, most my free time is learning new languages or playing in local taverns. And my go-to for combat is the shatter spell. Seduction and bedding everything I see is kind of counterproductive to what I’m trying to do. Which is learn every language to talk to literally anyone to help the party and earn enough gold to buy enchanted musical instruments to boost party stats during combat."
