specializedtools,fejngh0,t1_fejjcl1,1579180755.0,I was all confused about that as well. Definitely a reflection.

askscience,fecap1n,t1_fec7qgg,1578969706.0,"It really depends on where you place value. Most definitely it won't be close to virgin, and that's definitely not the point I'm trying to make.

I understand that thermosets can't be traditionally recycled. It doesn't mean that we can't try to find another way to use them or change the way our goods are packaged. 

Or, you know, we can keep filling whales with them and claim that ""There wasn't anything we could do. They weren't recyclable..."""
askscience,fec8ly1,t1_fec3qe8,1578968559.0,"You check out the link?

“I have worked with recycling both phenolic and BMC, and I’m starting to work on a project to recycle epoxies. Based on this, I feel I can be forward enough to tell you that recycling thermosets is no more or less difficult than recycling any engineering-grade thermoplastic—with the exception of polypropylene, polyethylene, styrene, PVC and maybe ABS,”

They're already thinking deeper. Let's continue."
askscience,fec28z0,t1_fec0y5p,1578965594.0,"I totally agree.Cowboy hats for frogs are a horrible idea! I think that the challenge isn't in recycling the material, but rather in finding creative uses for something that is otherwise discarded and can be used more effectively to replace something else that is produced from raw resources. 

Simply grinding up a product that isn't recyclable to use as less expensive filler for molded parts seems to somewhat fit that bill. I'm sure that more creative minds can imagine even more creative uses than my 30 second Google search to find better uses at a lower environmental impact. 

It just bothers me a little that everyone is ok pitching thermoset plastics because some dude said ""They can't be recycled"". Let's think deeper than that."
askscience,fec0awt,t1_fean2p5,1578964818.0,"I think that this is a common misconception. Just because we can't directly recycle formed thermoset plastics back into another formed thermoset plastic part doesn't mean that they can't be used as something else. 

Were we to take a serious look at how else we could use the material in a different form, I think that we could find a use and ""recycle"" it. If budget or practicability weren't concerns, than we would clearly find a use for it: cut the material into tiny strips and weave cowboy hats for frogs or something. 

Even inside of plastic forming, there are uses for [thermoset plastics that have been ground into powder](https://www.plasticstoday.com/recycling/yes-thermoset-resins-can-be-recycled/25571967424816)

Edit: Misconception was probably a poor choice of words, since OP was talking about constituent elements and I was thinking of recycling/repurposing in general. Sorry for that, and not trying to be inflammatory. It just bugs me that we pitch an insane volume of single use plastics, ocean buddies are eating a ton of it, and that koalas and kangaroos are on fire. 

Carry on."
