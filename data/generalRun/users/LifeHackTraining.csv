They have been marketed as trying to improve our lives but all they do is distract us and make our lives more complicated.

I just used this - https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Q73RdfGZvO_vGVjfSFKqDOaMqO5G1khsZgwgTBxekD4/edit#gid=0

I have it printed off in a written diary and next to my bed so it's visible.

I try and have these days away from the computer and my mobile phone and reconnect with nature and so I've taken to using a paper diary and note pad.

You can make a copy of this if you wish and use it yourself.

I use it as a guide and do allow flexibility in some cases."
getdisciplined,ffa8nrs,t1_ffa40hp,1579730033.0,"I had some money saved over 15 years. I used to the money to buy me time to invest in myself, pursue fulfilment and develop / discover my passion (i spent some of it to go on a personal trainer course for example).

It was difficult watching that money deplete but it was the right thing to do considering the alternative.

Right now, I have very little money but that doesn't matter because I am doing what I am supposed to be doing with my life.

I have a very simple life. I don't go on holidays, I don't drink alcohol or smoke. I cycle to work. My diet is very simple - I eat fruit and vegetables most of the time. 

I've come to truly appreciate simplicity; I take joy in tranquility, nature, meditation, reading.

I invest the rest of my time in creating something so I can help empower people.."
LifeProTips,ffa714e,t1_ffa3ktb,1579729123.0,I don't understand. What do you mean?
getdisciplined,ffa2p6i,t1_ffa24l7,1579726687.0,"Thank you for your comment. I became fascinated with Stoicism. If find all of this so relevant to the problems and challenges we see in society today.

I came to realise I needed to take a step back from it all. Our emotions are a direct result to what we subject ourselves to (our habits and daily decisions). 

I came to the realisation I needed to change everything.. 

I sacrificed financial wealth for a wealth that was so much more profound and meaningful...

it was then that I discovered fulfilment..."
getdisciplined,ffa1a6v,t1_ff9xhdn,1579725868.0,"Haha. Thank you for asking.

So I concentrated on exercise and resumed the things I loved doing in youth (took up yoga again, kickboxing - I ended up having a couple of kickboxing fights -, half marathons and started meditation). I retrained as a personal trainer, switched up my diet and ended up working part time where I train in kickboxing. 

I developed an interest in philosophy, psychology and personal development. So spend the rest of my time reading and meditating.

I just set up a sub reddit and youtube channel to focus on useful strategies, tools and techniques which I have used on myself that I want to share to help others. 

Just trying to figure out what I need to do now that this reddit group is set up.."
getdisciplined,ff9xv1h,t1_ff96scv,1579723860.0,"Funny you mention that, I just picked up Meditations from Marcus Aurelius. I will say that reading philosophy and psychology opened my mind up and helped me understand much more about life; understanding that confronting fear, discomfort and challenge are integral for grow, that our emotions are a survival mechanism that serve to send us messages and guide us to take action.."
getdisciplined,femiupu,t1_feldy4e,1579257818.0,"What is your passion?

I totally agree with you about society and greed. 

I became disillusioned by it. 

This is why I distance myself from things. I spend a lot of time alone, reflecting, meditating and just focus on working on myself.

I live a very simple life now. I don't watch TV or read newspapers because I realised that's all BS. I just read books now.

When all this happened to me.. I looked up and very few people were there to help.

Since then I keep a small group of people but see them sparingly. I much prefer being alone these days..."
getdisciplined,fel5wby,t1_fehhpom,1579214735.0,Totally agree with what you say about having a greater calling and surrendering yourself to a greater purpose. Once you have this you develop more motivation and energy than you realise you were capable of. It no longer is a job it becomes more than that... Best of luck with your endeavours...
getdisciplined,fel580b,t1_fehbcff,1579214322.0,"Thank you. 

I wish you health, happiness and prosperity in 2020 and beyond.."
getdisciplined,fel5591,t1_fehczw0,1579214276.0,"Totally agree. It is very difficult in our society to find our love / passion / purpose. We live in the information age where we are bombarded with messaging all the time. This confuses the brain and makes it really hard for people to discover or develop their passion. 
Society tells us what we should be doing (buy this product, get an education, get a job, go on this holiday, get married, get a mortgage) because we look outwardly so much we seek happiness with things on the outside (food, sex, drugs, shopping, etc). 

True happiness comes from self analysis, time alone to reflect, meditation and time away from this constant bombardment of BS information we are subjected to (advertising, marketing, social media, etc). This helps us to reconnect with ourselves and understand our truth (who we are, what we stand for and what we want from life)"
getdisciplined,fel4fl0,t1_fehiixz,1579213835.0,"My overwhelming fear in life is looking back on my life when I am 80 years old or on my death bed and thinking I didn't try hard enough to make something of my life. 

I have a overwhelming fear that I may regret not having tried to create the life I wanted for myself.

I have taken different tools, techniques and resources from a range of different personal development books. Not just the 7 Habits.

Once book a really recommend you read is a book called PsychoCybernetics by Maxwell Maltz. It's simplicity is genius. I learnt a great deal about the mind, identity and how personality is formed. This books is a game changer."
getdisciplined,fel3j43,t1_fehpa6v,1579213281.0,I had many boring careers and came to the realisation that money doesn't mean sh*t. We have one life. Do the things you love doing. Life is innately difficult for everyone. But it is a lot easier to come through obstacles and challenges in life when you love what you do. The one thing that scares me in life is looking back on my life in old age and thinking I should have tried harder or done what I wanted to do rather than living based on other people or society's expectations of what I should do.
getdisciplined,fel33lp,t1_fehx3kg,1579213013.0,Read a book called PsychoCybernetics by Maxwell Maltz and decide for yourself.
antiwork,feh0ghl,t1_fegsn4d,1579106550.0,"That's totally fine. Just to give some context, it took me 15 years to save that money...."
