aspergers,ffq3981,t1_ff94k1c,1580118000.0,"Yeah, I really find I quite sarcastic to let (suspected) aspies wait for a period that is that long. It just shows me that the understanding of aspies in the world of psychiatric/psychologic practice is still limited. It induces a huge anxiety in me because of the intolerance of uncertanty aspect in me, it is (and was) devastating to me and my mental health. Thus, I am now only considering therapists and clinicans that are aspies themselves, as I just had too many very damaging experiences..."
aspergers,ffq30ft,t1_ff98wt8,1580117606.0,"Yeah exactly. That's my reasoning too. 'Data science' basically describes the operating system of my brain (and most likely quite a lot of other people on the spectrum too), so it makes sense that we end up in that field I guess.
The only thing I'm kinda afraid is, that a data science job actually usually most of the time includes some 'consulting' and going to business clients and presenting the results of analyses. Even though I can give presentations, I very much suffer multiple days before giving one (does not matter in front of how many people, or what audience) as it induced ridiculous anxiety in me. But I'll see I guess :)
I am actually pretty positive that you'll finde an entry position (I am also in the tough situation of not having a ton of experience outside academia). But once you are in there, things should be fine. Maybe we need to consider a trainee or intern position to enter the field..."
aspergers,ff8pg9l,t3_es9cxe,1579690365.0,"Wow, such wise words! I totally endorse your message.

I was very much appalled from the very much 'fundamentalistic' mentality that some people in the 'scene'/'movement' show (I don't intend to offend anyone with this post, though).  
But to me, a very informed self-diagnosis should not be discredited the way it sometimes is in the community (and usually aspies inform themself quite well and thoroughly). And no, I'm not advising to just do self-diagnosis at all, but it most of the time is the way people go through after realizing and suspecting they might be on the spectrum. And as you know the waiting list, as well as the process of diagnosis itself usually is super long, and often exceeds 1 year. This combined with the fact that people that realize, they might be on the spectrum are often at a bad time in their life, as it means they might be depressed or burnt out or something like that. Thus not being willing to accept (well informed) self-diagnosed people in the community most likely is cause quite a lot of unnecessary harm and suffering to people that are in a relly bad spot anyway. And the change that an informed self-diagnosis is actually wrong is not that big as many thinks, and no matter what, the person seeking diagnosis/explanation by definition are experiencing struggles, and if they are not on the spectrum most likely do have another neurodiverse condition (like ADHD etc). So why not just accept these people (even temporarily) and show a willingness to help? They'll move on to the 'right' community after the diagnosis anyway, so the community would not be flooded with 'wrongly diagnosed' people. (which by itself is some kind of fundamentalistic belief that I very much resist to endorse). Just my 2-cents."
aspergers,ff8p132,t3_eryzgf,1579689741.0,"My words!

Thanks for that. It's very interesting all the parallels to my current situation in life.  
Also just finished my education (Ph.D.) and trying to jump into the private sector for an 'entry position'  in data science (which seems ironic and strange at the age of early 30ies). I totally confirm all the points you listed. I got the exact same thoughts about the process. It's relly hard to not get too discouraged to actually even try. I'm at the border of doing that, but struggling with bad thoughts on a daily basis (like: ""I will never be able to do that"", ""I'm just not made for a usual job life"" etc.). But it also is a double edged sword. Somehow I get depressed when I do not do anything (professionaly/work), but when I do, it is so exhausting, that I pretty much struggle with my private everyday life (however, usually it very much satisfies me to learn new things and do meaningful work). Thus, I'm also 'afraid' (ironically) of my future job to suck me in that much that it becomes one of my special interest, which would inevitably,  mean that I neglect my wife and kid, without actually wanting do do that.

The lacking network is also a big issue for me, also the bad appearance at job interview (even though I just had 2 in my life). I'm really insecure, shy, and not spontaneous at all with my answers (beating up myself for all mistakes in appearance/communication/answers etc. over and over again).  
I am positive that there is a niche for people like us, where it is ok for us to be the way we are. There most likely is a niche for everyone. However, it just might take some time to actually find ours...Mine most likely is not involving too much contact with human beings, as that is just too exhausting for me (so maybe I'll just end up in an IT-back office with quite some people that function similar to me, be it autistic or NT). :) 

Good luck!"
ADHD,ff8om8p,t3_es1hdg,1579689130.0,"Wow congrats!

I hope that you had some time since the diagnosis to implement some support mechanisms in your life to mitigate your struggles (maybe you already did that before diagnosis).  
I was just recently thinking about what would have happened if I decided to go the medical school. And my conclusion was that I would have failed drastically. Because I was undiagnosed at that time and had serious issues with self control/discipline. And having seen in the meantime many friends go through medical school (and quite some dropping out) I realized that I would have probably failed without diagnosis and thus better understanding of my struggles etc. Not sure about the US, or your specific country, as I'm residing in central Europe and it might be quite different there. But there the sheer amount of down-time you have for studying independently, I guess I would have not had the discipline to give me that much structure to actually invest enough time to succeed in the exams :)."
ADHD,ff43bn1,t3_erfkfx,1579554625.0,"As ADHD according to current research is also a spectrum condition, it means that ADHD traits are present in all different combinations and intensities.  
Thus, most people have some traits/behaviors that are implicated in ADHD if they are present to a certain degree that is interfering with one's life.  


I see your point, however I also think that this fact that people instantly recognize similar features in themselves is also a great door for Non-ADHD people to actually understand us a litle bit better, since they might know some of the struggles from their life (however, they are usually present to a much less debilitating degree). But I still think in the end it helps us to be understood by society. Boon and bane..."

ADHD,fe7lkj3,t3_enzpwr,1578916196.0,"Yeah it's all about public education and ADHD awareness (or mental health in general, too).

I guess the tides are already changing, but the thing is that the change appears slowly. I just see that in todays classes and schools there is a rather big adhd awareness around and it is pretty much mandatory for all teachers to get educated about adhd etc. But that's a long term investment. This will show an effect once these people make up the big part of society in some decades or so.  
What we can do, and what our job is, is to educate our surroundings and be open about it. When people are not afraid anymore to be stigmatized after 'coming out' things will drastically change. I just imagined something like the #metoo wave or samething, where just some celebrities publicily show some adhd pride and then a lot of people follow etc."

I guess that makes sense. At least to explain it. So it originated as a behaviour to very much assist you. But keep an eye on it. If it gets dominating and starts to impair you more than it helps, then you might have to tackle the OCD too actively.
For me, I had heavy OCD in my childhood, but somehow outgrew it.
But my ADHD mom as very pronounced OCD as she grew up in a dirty messy chaos and therefore developed crazy, cleaning and organising OCD.

aspergers,fdqvrtf,t1_fdphli7,1578675594.0,"Totally agree!  
That's what my examiner stated too: It's very hard to distinguish mild ASD from ADHD+Social anxiety. Especially if there are some autistic tendencies involved too."
aspergers,fdqvjxj,t3_emlbct,1578675520.0,"Well, if your ADHD examiner is not highly experienced in diagnosing adults on the milder end of the spectrum, they are not qualified to judge no matter what. It's very very tough to diagnose 'high functioning' (sorry for the term) adults. Just keep in mind that Tony Attwood, the world-leading clinical psychologist in the field of  aspergers, did miss to see that his son is on the spectrum until his son was like 30 years old or so. Just that shows how hard it can be to detect it. Also, even ASD experts are not always able to reproduce previous diagnoses from other experts. So it's totally healthy to keep a reasonable skepticism of the clinical diagnoses (as we are talking about arbitrary categories that change on a regular basis anyway).

I was in a similar position. My Examiner diagnosed me with ADHD and did not see any signs of ASD, because I was showing non-verbal behavior (but...yeah masking...).

Regarding your points (I'm not trying to say you are not potentially on the spectrum, but I'd like to comment generally):

Number 1: Issues with eye contact are 100% explainable with a diagnosis of ADHD, it's a vital part of it too. (I found out during my research, as it was one of my arguments too).

Number 2: Also perfectly explainable by ADHD. Stimulants are in no way a wonder drug that cure ADHD. They just improve certain aspects of everyday life. And also the response rate varies widely and finding the right dose of the right drug might be a long journey of several years

Number 3: Sensory issues are very very common with ADHD too. Could be smell...touch...or hearing (as it is for me). It is very common to be a symptom of ADHD. Or might even be a sensory integration disorder that is comorbid to ADHD, which is very common too.

Number 4: Actually that one point I cannot explain in my case either. Most of the time ADHDers are described as lying very often to hide their failures etc. But I am also pathologically honest. I cannot lie and I do never lie. I do not see the point in it. And I expect the same from my surroundings.

Number 5: Also perfectly explainable by ADHD. ADHD symptoms might lead to a clinical presentation that is pretty much indistinguishable from ASD regarding social difficulties. It might have several reasons, e.g. always having been rejected because of impulsive behaviour like anger, or interrupting onversations etc. But ADHD also means that you might actually no pick up social cues because of your lacking attention. And as you can see, that's pretty much the same thing as not understanding social cues at all, at least in the consequences. This might lead to a very similar presentation to ASD symptoms.

Number 6: Yep you said it. One prime symptom of ADHD. And again, sounds like you might either not be respondig to your medication, or no thave found the correct dose yet.

But it sounds like we are veeeeeeeery close to each other. Your post could have been coming from me. I'm currently mentally assessing if I should go for an ASD diagnosis even though the ADHD expert was disagreeing. But I still had the same thoughts as you did. It just felt like it was pretty accurate, but there was that feeling of not being the perfect fit. Where ASD actually was pretty much explaining all of my struggles. After hearing a lot of experience reports by ASD people and ADHD people I end up identifying with the ASD people almost 100% of the time.  
My core thoughts are also the part about lying, which according to my knowledge is not explained by ADHD. But also the special interests. This is also a tricky part, because special interest are also a part of ADHD, expecially due to hyperfocus and deep interest. However they thend to be short-lived and change quickly. However, for me it's way more than a consequence from hyper-focusing or so. It is a clear coping mechanism. And the interest is to such an intensity that I totally freak out if I'm interrupted and that I end up knowing EVERYTHING about certain topics in a very short time.  
However, I realized that I will not find an answer to that question online. But I found quite some reports of experts and some primary research that showed me that ADHD and ASD are in no way independent. And that ADHD is a spectrum too, and the two conditions overlap quite a bit. And I've heard experts state that it is not possible even for the biggest experts in the field to distinguish heavy ADHD from mild ASD reliably. One Expert would diagnose one and another one the other condition. Thus, I grew a healthy skepticism of clinical diagnoses as they reflect an arbitrary cutoff. Imagine you just bein a tiny bit below the clinical threshold: it does not mean that your struggles do not exist. There might still be significant autistic traits, but because of an arbitrary cutoff you would not get a diagnosis.  
Additionally. What is the reason to get diagnosed after all. Why is it that important to us? Shouldn't it be to get help for our struggles and our symptoms? Having an ASD diagnosis likely would not change anything regarding the treatments you'd receive. So maybe it does not matter what label we carry...it should rather be about getting help and validation for/of our struggles.

Sorry for the lengthy post. But this topic bothers me very much too right now. As I kind of get obsessed with trying to figure out what is true in my case, but I just cannot.

Please let me know if anyone got some expert knowledge on distinguishing ASD from ADHD etc."
autism,fdqs9dw,t3_emslvi,1578673783.0,"Why does it matter to you?

Who defines/defined the term 'disability'?

I look at the term 'disability' in a neutral way. It just describes that a person is not able to function to a degree as an average human being is. It's just validating your struggles basically. The negative connotation to 'disability' is just because some derivations of it are used as a swear word or because you might be thinking of highly disabled people when you hear it and you are not identifying. But there is actually no bad connotation to 'disability' to all. To me, it might even be positive, as it's validating your struggles, as I've just said."

It always feels really creepy and like it will be like that forever. Was especially true for my first big and long episode of severe depression and clinical anxiety. I was sure that it would never go away, which just fueled my anxiety and depression. The good think is that I still had some depressive episodes in the next 10 years, but they were way 'less harmful' subjectively. Maybe the depression was as bad, but just the fact you've been through it already and you know it went away the first time is very calming and prevented me from going down the negative spiral of being anxious about being anxious etc. Have hope!

People that are sure they've got ASD.

Depending on the region/country people use the word depression in a casual way pretty much just like sadness. That's why I started saying 'clinical depression'. Meaning clinically relevant, thus depression to a degree that it impairs your functioning. But I'm not an expert.

But it really works for pretty much all mental illnesses. Like OCD for example. Everyone is not sure if they locked the door and have to check again or something like that.

Or anxiety. Anxiety is a totally normal emotion. Every human being is anxious at times, and it was evolutionary totally essential for our existence.

Trust me, there will be a lot of things waiting for you in the next decade that will be challenging AF. Go for diagnosis now and get the help you need. You'll prevent a potential burnout and a lot of mental health complications like anxiety and clinical depression! With a diagnosis, you might also get support for your 'disability', which can be total game changers! Just the inproved self understanding is totally worth it to not judge potentiall failures to harshly, which can in turn lead to depression again.

depression,fdgiwlh,t3_el7fo7,1578398672.0,"I'm happy to hear that you did not do it. 

I know life can be extremely painful and exhausting. And it is perfectly valid to be that exhausted from it, that one actually feels like not being able to handle it anymore. I've been through that too, and so have a lot of people reading this.

Trust me, in the future you'll actually be happy that you did not do it. there is pleanty of help around for all different types of mental health issues and it's worth going through the pain of talking about your struggles to an expert.

Life can be wonderful. And there are great things waiting for you in life.  


Have you ever thried to visit a selfhelp group for mental health in general (or the condition(s) that affect you)?  
Just talking to people that go and went throught the same struggles (maybe even including a suicide attempt) might  help you a lot to be a lot more positive about your existence, as you won't feel alone anymore."
aspergers,fda6hb5,t3_eke16j,1578242282.0,"HI!

I was in the exact same position just some months ago actually.

I totally feel with you. I was very confused and also kind of disappointed, as I experienced the same eye-opening even everyone was describing after realizing they might be on the spectrum.I had the exact same feelings after the negative diagnosis, I felt like the perfect explanation for my struggles was taken from me and I also thought that I'm now back at the start and just a terrible person (by the way, my AQ is also between 38 and 40). Did you also get checked for ADHD? because fortunately my evaluator was an expert on botch ASD and ADHD in adults and at least he was very clear about me having strong ADHD. He also pointed out that it is very hard, or basically 'impossible' to diagnostically distinguish mild ASD from ADHD with comorbid social anxiety/ or general anxiety.  I realized that I actually did not know what ADHD actually implied. Long story short: After diving into the scientific literature about ASD and ADHD I realised that quite some experts in the field think that ASD and ADHD together is some sort of a Spectrum. Imagine a Venn-Diagramm with 2 Circles that have a big intersection (see for example [this youtube video](https://youtu.be/63cCOZhzrqo); around minute 2 you can see the diagram). Additionally I got to realise that 1. ADHD itself might be a spectrum disorder according to recent science ([scource1](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0165178119313538), [scource2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5154646/) ) 2. There is a big genetic link between ASD and ADHD (and depression) ([source1](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-019-0527-8),[source2](https://www.nature.com/articles/mp201717)) and 3rd and final point: Even experts say that even clinicians are not reliably able to correctly diagnose and distinguish mild aspergers/asd from strong ADHD (e.g. check this [5min youtube video out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HX4Zbfy72NU)).

I guess my personal final (maybe temporary) conclusion is that the label is not an important part of the equation. It just does not matter if it is mild ASD or strong ADHD (or maybe both), especially as the symptoms very much overlap. Thus, addressing your personal struggles and symptoms is the most important point, not finding the perfect label for it!

So keep in mind. You do not need a label in order to be able to accept your struggles. Your struggles and difficulties in life are real, no matter what clinical label they carry. So try to address these with a therapist (just choose a therapist that is an expert on adhd and asd, because they'll understand your struggles no matter what diagnosis it actually is."
ADHD,fcl62bw,t1_fckjlcm,1577740589.0,"Damn, that's awesome to hear as a newly diagnosed. Actually considered being on the autism spectrum because my feelings are so numb a lot of the time and I would not feel anything in regards to close people around me.  
However, I guess 100% or nothing pretty much describes it perfectly.  
But I guess 100% or 0% could be the slogan for ADHD in general, so it makes sense :)"
ADHD,fcl5m6m,t3_ehi0pq,1577740317.0,"in contrary. I would rather say my Empathy is impaired. But I realized that people sometimes do not define Empathy equally.

However, I have an immense sense of justice. And unfairness and inequality drive me absolutely insane.But, I can totally freak out during a meltdown and call my wife the worst cursewords on the planet and I do not feel anything. Not even bad that I did it at all or so. Thus, I consider myself to be empathy impaired. But that could just be that that my anger is just dominating too much.

Edit: I however also do possess that trait of personification of objects. But not sure if I would consider that to be Empathy...

What helped for me was (and it might sound strange and disgusting) taking some complete food in liquid form (like soylent or similar things; just powder where everything you need is in there. And it's super easy to prepare it. Just add some spoons of powder to a mug and stir. That's it.  
For me, it's just way easier to ingest calories in a liquid form rather than the usual 'solid' form. That's how I tricked and me. And I've been holding my weight ever since. (Before, I was loosing around 40 pounds/20 Kilograms in one depressive episode of like 4-5 Months)"
dogs,fcl48n2,t3_eho07v,1577739465.0,"Absolutely.

Both I as well as my wife do suffer from episodic depression and clinical anxiety. We sometimes sarcastically call our dog our 'antidepressant'. It's absolutely invaluable to have a being that forces you to get moving and get out of bed or your house. Some fresh air, a bit of physical exercise and maybe feeling like part of the world again, as you might see busy people minding their business and rushing around.  
I would totally recommend getting a dog. However, of course, it is a lot of work and responsibility, so it very much helps to be a couple that looks after the dog. (Maybe if you are alone in your household or the only 'owner' I would recommend having a backup plan for the case that you would not be able to look after your dog for some days or so (family members, friends, doggy daycare, etc..

I guess I would recommend getting a dog, as long as you are willing and interested to read up on how to train one or maybe go for a course or something (if you're not already dog experienced).  
Also, it is absolutely essential to pick the right breed (and character) that is compatible with your lifestyle.  
E.g. Do not even think about getting a border collie or husky if you are a couch potato.

Adjusting was super quick and we were absolutely sure that we would want a dog.  
What we did is we wrote a classified ad online and offered free dog sitting for a month or two, as we were both working from home at that time. This was just to actually get to know what it is like to look after a dog and what responsibilities you have and what types of freedom you loose etc. That worked very well for us, as we both did not have explicit experience with owning a dog or growing up with one.  


As a first step ask yourself if you are willing to give up potential 'freedom' in your life. Think about what you will be doing with your dog in case you are working in an office and cannot bring it with you. Even though I guess in some regions of the US, leaving the dog at home alone during a full workday seems to be practiced, I think that this is very irresponsible and should not be considered as a long-term option. If you have flexible working hours and can maybe work for 5-6 hours a day and have a short commute, I think it would be kinda ok for a rather calm dog without separation anxiety. Given a walk before and after work obviously. At the start, we were forced to give our dog to doggy day care 5 days a week, as the two of us had no possibility of taking it with us to work. That was not only very time consuming to bring and get the dog from day care, but also veeeeery veeeeery expensive (at least where I live).  


But if these things sound like common sense to you then you've got what it takes to look after a dog I guess. As the most important thing is to be willing to learn how a dog functions and what it needs to be happy etc.

And be sure to consider adopting a dog from your friendly local shelter :)"

I'll get a binder and try to follow your advise! Thanks for your comment!"
