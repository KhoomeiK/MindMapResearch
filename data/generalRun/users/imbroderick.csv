MurderedByWords,fewacn7,t3_eqjlha,1579407507.0,"That’s a valid point, I just think there are so many things to jump to before racism. Like was the dude just taking his own anger out on someone else, is he just delusional, like there are so many things it could have been"
MurderedByWords,fev67y5,t1_fev43a3,1579393528.0,"If I can toss my two cents in, I would say keep being passionate, that’s how things progress and change happens. But, approach it in a more strategic way. Trying to say someone you don’t know online is “wrong” when stating their opinion (which is not determined by fact, but simple ones own thoughts) is a bit out there. Enjoy peoples thoughts and better yourself for them. I hope you have a great night, week, month, year and life. I hold no hate for the comments. Stay happy and keep fighting for what you believe in."
MurderedByWords,fev4pse,t1_fev43a3,1579393048.0,"Props to you for admitting that. You seem like a really good and passionate dude, which is why I’m still wondering why you want to turn a simple opinion of mine into debate on how I’m playing the victim and shit"
MurderedByWords,fev44jq,t1_fev2tn1,1579392926.0,"I didn’t say he face to face met her and she was a douche to him? I said by chance what if her saw her being upset. Say she was on the phone with one of her kids and mad about something or talking to her husband and being adamant about something and it came off angrily. Also,  not here to defend “David” as I clearly said he was wrong for his comment"
MurderedByWords,fev3rkj,t1_fev2djz,1579392775.0,"So what you’re saying is, you’ve never once in your life said the wrong thing around the wrong group of people? said something that offended someone? Because everyone in this world is absolutely perfect? What is the difference between saying “this person hasn’t done anything to gain my respect” or “they’re angry” and “Who the fuck actually thinks like that? Nobody. Just people who like playing victim for being terrible people...” the point is you can’t jump to conclusions when simply reading an online post"
MurderedByWords,fev2irn,t1_fev1q56,1579392386.0,"As I said in my original comment, she has never been an angry person, and the original comment on the post was wrong... but that shouldn’t allow someone to assume racism. What if by chance the original commenter ran into her on a bad day and saw her being upset irl and that’s the notion they have of her? Someone online can’t then just assume because they said she’s an angry person that the underlying cause is racism"
MurderedByWords,fev1bpa,t1_fev111v,1579392007.0,I didn’t say people shouldn’t be called out? in the original post when did anyone say anything about racism until the second person assumed the reason was racism?
MurderedByWords,feur8of,t1_feuqukj,1579389199.0,"I mean that’s true, but with the whole pc culture of 2020 you can’t even sneeze in the direction of someone that’s a different race than you without someone being offended by it"

MurderedByWords,fett5oe,t3_eqjlha,1579379770.0,"I can’t think of any time I’ve ever seen here angry ever, but for someone to throw out the “you’re just a racist pos” is a little extreme for me. Especially in a time where racism allegations carry more weight than ever before. The guy is clearly not correct, but neither is the person who commented. I may be wrong and there could be missing context, but throwing the race thing out there without proof is a huge problem.

They do have a much more powerful emotional state that pushes them to do what they think they need to do, but in terms of bite power and physical brute force, they are no different than a German Shepard or Labrador. And those two breeds are heavily sought after as a “family” pet. It’s just sad that certain breeds get such a negative connotation because of mainstream media and a lack of research on pet owners parts."
