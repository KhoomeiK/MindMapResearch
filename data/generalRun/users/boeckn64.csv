1000lbsisters,ffpky69,t3_euf3iv,1580097583.0,"It is a shame. I've already posted that clearly there's a need for heavier range scales and I hope that changes. BUT Tammy ONLY needs to comply and lose that first 50 lbs and then she, too, can use Amy's new scale. Tammy is a month or 2 from 550 if she's compliant...Perhaps Tammy can use this as inspiration to lose the first 50, 60 lbs."
BravoRealHousewives,ffpjvlq,t3_eue03w,1580096799.0,I fucking HATE Joyce. She doesn't deserve the blessings she's derived by being Kandi Buress' Mom. Bitch.
GTAorRussia,ffpjbqf,t3_erfewy,1580096407.0,He didnt look real to me. Looks like its all CGI.

1000lbsisters,ffpiskh,t1_ffnhn0v,1580096051.0,Do you happen to know which sister is older? I know Amy feels guilty for putting food on Tammy's plate as kids which sounds like Amy was/is the older sister...is she?
realhousewives,ffolppc,t1_ffmpfgz,1580078946.0,"That's BEYOND low...Vicki has an amazing ability to perceive events ENTIRELY DIFFERENT than EVERYONE ELSE and as we all know, it's rarely, if ever a good thing!!!"

1000lbsisters,ffmq2n9,t3_eu1k6v,1580057789.0,"After last night's episode I could just strangle Tammy!! I want to be equally supportive to BOTH sisters. As a fan of the show I feel it's my duty to try my best to not bash but to support. I am frustrated tho, ESPECIALLY AT TAMMY!!! 

I'm so glad the Dr asked her why she isn't getting her own beverages, at the very least. She is so angry and poor Amy takes the brunt of it. And poor Amy is becoming reactionary to Tammy now, meaning extra sensitive to anything that comes out of Tammy's mouth. So Amy's right about moving next door and getting space. 

More time in the pool is a given if you ask me. They loved it!!!!"
realhousewives,ffmoxkx,t1_ffk7vrd,1580057369.0,"I agree. Why such hate for MKE?? I always liked her, admired that she wouldn't back down to liar Vicki, and damn she is GORGEOUS. Who else can pull of a denim romper like she did on the train. Wow, I can look cute but damn, she has legs that go for miles and genetically MKE is blessed. Yet she's not immune to bad times so I wish fans would cut MKE some slack, and embrace her. Stay focused on Vicki and Tamra, and idk about Shannon yet. I'm on the fence..."
BravoRealHousewives,ffmnh1w,t1_ffifm08,1580056937.0,"But you know, people actually still do go out and earn, just for the satisfaction of doing the right thing and also hopefully for the enjoyment of working if so fortunate. But to be able bodied and deliberately remain unemployed, how can one excuse that? ESPECIALLY WHEN one has a disabled child to support. I mean he used to act like Gretchen wanted him home, or as her manager of BS, LOL, but they haven't been on reality tv for YEARS and he STILL isn't working??? OMG How was he EVER successful then??? How does one just lose their work ethic like that??"
1000lbsisters,ffmmar5,t1_ffiu5wg,1580056608.0,I didn't say it exactly that way...I was simply separating the issues. Of course linguistically and legally they're both classified as abuse and I merely was asking for distinction and details. It doesn't seem tho there's much more you'd like to add except to say neglect is abuse. No argument there...never was.
hoarderhouses,ffm10xb,t3_e98gm1,1580046773.0,What a little cutie pie!!! What breed is your little hoarder?? You outta crosspost this pic if you haven't already on r/awww and other animal subs. Redditors will eat this little hoarder pup up!! I don't know if this sub gets much traffic.
1000lbsisters,ffiig2y,t1_ffhvacu,1579974633.0,So what animals did they abuse?

BravoRealHousewives,ffiedlm,t1_ffie1fy,1579971864.0,And what about Slade? Surely he found a job by NOW...it's not 2008 anymore. He's had 12 years to find another occupation or go back into mortgages or whatever it was he did...what a sloth.

TooAfraidToAsk,ffhof3w,t3_etl02h,1579945309.0,"Plus our cities are passe. Look at the amazing architecture going on in say Dubai  and Asia...those are modern cities. America isn't keeping up. Seems our isolation and our ego has STUNTED our growth going into the future. It's true that Asia's burgeoning population forces them to build vertically, and boy do they!! With some of the sexiest skyscrapers I've ever seen. Sadly I don't see ANY growth in ANY American city that could rival Asia"
1000lbsisters,ffhaw1k,t1_ffgoti6,1579928284.0,"I'm with you Dad...there's a real need so I'm surprised no one is jumping on the opportunity to manufacture scales that go higher. Thank God they found one that's max weight limit is 550. It's a start and maybe Tammy will drop 50 lbs and then she can use the scale too!!

I know that's meaningless to Tammy right now she's hurting and super depressed...I hope that the depression lifts soon!"
90DayFiance,ffha4dh,t1_ffgjhpf,1579927577.0,"Ok, so like how Bravo refers to those 1 on 1 interviews as ""confessionals""?  (NOTE: I think that term originated w/ mTV's ""Real World"")"
GhostAdventures,ffh9oa5,t1_fffym2e,1579927168.0,I'd be interested in knowing if Jay had any lasting effects from that investigation because so much was centered around him. I wonder if any entity attached themselves to him or what. Just a quick follow up interview would be so cool...
animalsdoingstuff,ffh9c2s,t1_fffsjsz,1579926868.0,A real heartbreaker!!! I spent 4 hours a day minimum holding and interacting with my pet rat. That's ALOT of bonding and fun to lose so suddenly to death after just 2 yrs.  I cried for a week and vowed to never adopt a rat again. They're too smart and give sooo much back to merely live only 2 to 3 years. I can handle the tiny life span.
BravoRealHousewives,ffgtcji,t1_ffgss8z,1579914546.0,"Idk, I've lost faith in Andy & Bravo as far as having any backbone, etc. They coddle those women instead of holding them accountable for their bad behavior. It's true I tuned in to RH to watch affluent people behaving badly, and boy that's what I got, 10 fold!!"

AbruptChaos,ffgpobp,t1_fff9990,1579911893.0,YIKES!!
1000lbsisters,ffgosmy,t3_et39xj,1579911273.0,"Tammy needs a mind reset ASAP. Tammy acts entitled to order Amy around and it's mind boggling. And if I had to rely on another human for most to all my basics, I'd kiss her ass or at least TRY to be kinder. Honestly altho Amy has sharp edges, she's a true saint when it comes to loving, caring and committing to het sister Tammy. Tammy is VERY lucky but she better slow her roll, lessen the attitude and start getting her OWN drinks, etc. It'll improve, I have faith. 

I wish they did make bigger scales cuz feeling defeated isn't a good mindset for dieting. Let's try to ease their obstacles, we don't need to shame them...so I'm saddened noone out there is manufacturing larger scales...they need to. Why pay a hospital a huge inflated fee just to have access to a scale?? Not helpful and these sisters have enough on their plates to contend with...LOL."
aww,ffgmo9b,t3_ete2io,1579909794.0,What I would give to experience that little bundle of joy in MY hand...so lucky both of them ultimately...
aww,ffgmgpd,t1_fffvogr,1579909653.0,"That's why ALL babies are adorable, so that we won't abandon them...evolution/science or God knew that if babies look cute we would automatically be drawn to them, to cuddle them and to ultimately love and NOT abandon them in their greatest time of need and vulnerability..."
Ghoststories,fffyqia,t3_etdyeq,1579894725.0,Wow that's some story...question: why is it special to know that he died on his birthday? I only ask because you had hinted it was pertinent to the unfolding story) but I missed any further reference to his death and birth being same days. And my other comment is that ghost seemed to really hang on for awhile before dissapearing. I find that fascinating...
BravoRealHousewives,fffu5bz,t3_etc7we,1579891853.0,So what happened between Tre and Danielle???

realhousewives,ffeyn2g,t1_ffe3a3s,1579870564.0,"Damn I'm sorry I missed this scene!!! My 23 yr old daughter asked who Charles Manson was which shocked me but she is young and if they don't cover it in American education classes, I cut her some slack. But how the heck can someone OUR AGE, (around TRE's AGE) NOT KNOW who the HECK Charles Manson is?? How is that even possible??"

90DayFiance,ffecx5h,t1_ffcun8t,1579843476.0,"Yea I hear you! I'm 56 and she absolutely looks way older than me. I guess I attributed her chest wrinkles to massive sun damage. Afterall she's so well endowed and if she was one to tan then you know she had to have had a dark chest...Idk tho, genetics may also be a factor. And if that's from smoking, wow, who would have thunk it?? But what a good deterrent from smoking if we put pics of her chest on cig packs: warning, smoking leads to Angela's chest!! Lol"
