AskReddit,fg3z9r0,t1_fg3xc07,1580492842.0,"Eh, you started it with the poor assumptions. 

You're significantly older than me, apparently, so you've had more time to make money. That passive income isn't much more than what I make daily with my full-time job. But I have also made large amounts of money from stocks and own a successful bar that brings me quite a bit of income as well. Taking that into consideration, $626.26 a day doesn't really compare. I also outright own my $350k home. FYI, I'm only in my late 20s.

It's interesting to see you pass off your 'inheritance' as a measure of success, given that you didn't work for it at all. Also interesting to call yourself a man slut and judge women for being in threesomes. The cognitive dissonance is amazing. Also hilarious that you keep count of something so insignificant. 

I don't honestly think that you are richer than me, but hey, anything's possible I guess. My sex life is moderately active, but I choose to focus my time on becoming a better person which tends to take up a lot of my attention and energy. I also have no idea how many women I've slept with, but it's not a small number I guess.

I am pretty happy with my life, thanks for noticing. Onward and upward, I always say. 

Doesn't seem so 'two to one' to me. But it's cute that you'd assume as much."
AskReddit,fg3vetk,t1_fg3uwac,1580490507.0,"Well, not right now I'm not. I'm working from my office in my beautiful home, waiting on a powershell script to finish for a major project I'm working on. You do realize most people in my field make very good money right? I'm sorry you're poor, it'll get better for you little buddy.

I have the time because I've already put years into my career lol. Not to mention that you have more time than I do, given that you perused my profile to try to figure out some sort of 'gotcha' to get back at me. Does that mean you're less successful than me? How's that working out for you? Honestly, you just sound really bitter, probably because you don't get laid due to your misogynistic views."
AskReddit,fg3uc0b,t1_fg3lnw1,1580489840.0,"Hahahaha you couldn't be more off. You would never guess I work in IT if you saw me in person. 

Let me laugh at you while I wipe my tears of joy with my six figure salary.
