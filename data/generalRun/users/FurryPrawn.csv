That's if you DO want to go out for dinner. I understand how hurt and sad you feel because I had a rocky relationship with my dad. I feel like your mum had a knee jerk reaction of feeling wounded so she lashed out by trying to hurt you with what's essentially an ""all or nothing"" ultimatum.

I honestly dont think you're overreacting or being insecure about this because it's weird as hell. Why is he so stubborn about keeping the pic of his ex up? Is he still in love with her? Is he using his instagram as a signal to show her hes still interested just in case she looks and is still interested too? He can't be embarrassed about the pages he follows otherwise he wouldnt scroll through them so openly while sitting next to you.

Your girlfriend is an immature child throwing a tantrum when things dont go her way. It's especially manipulative for her to threaten to break up with you whenever you have an argument. You need a partner who will stick by you and support you, who has your back. She doesn't sound like she can do any of that, at least without rubbing your face in it when she wants to score points in an argument.

I get being really being in love with her, but think about the future...do you want to be trapped in a shitty relationship for the next five, ten years? Do you think you deserve to be treated better? I'm looking forward to seeing an update to this after you speak with her."

They are old enough to make their own choices (also my father is dead now so it's a non issue.) If my mother had sex with one of my friends of course I would be uncomfortable.

I can see how it makes OP uncomfortable. Her friend is her peer, someone who she relates to. Now her friend has gone and fucked her father, who isn't her peer and hes the last person in the world she would have sex with. Its definitely awkward. 

I'm just repeating myself now but they're both consenting adults. Her father isn't JUST her father. Hes also his own person with a sex drive and once again hes an adult capable of making his own choices as is the friend, and theres nothing wrong with enjoying sex as he seems to.

Stop obsessing about other peoples sex life and concentrate on your own.

Also, don't make out like me saying it not 'being your business' was about anything other than their sex life. Of course in general your friends and your parents are your business. But there should be parts that remain private."

relationships,fcw9cw5,t1_fcw8sd2,1578020143.0,"It's none of her business that they had sex in the first place. If she can't look at her friend knowing that two consenting adults had sex then she needs to learn how to get over it.

Edit: seriously, do people not see how obsessive it is to be so fixated on what your own fathers penis has done? It's a private matter that doesn't involve, and should never involve, OP."

Shes told you shes not interested. That's it. You can't change that. Life is not a rom com or Disney movie. No amount of grand gestures and chasing will make her love you. You have to understand and accept that sometimes you're going to love someone who will never love you back, and that's ok because you'll move on and meet someone who does."

relationships,fcvl3pb,t3_ej515n,1578004415.0,"I agree with the other comments saying to speak with your dad about how his behaviour makes you feel. Honestly, he sounds pretty immature.

BUT. Your dad and your friend are both adults who had consensual sex. It's not your place to say who your dad or your friend can have sex with. It's also none of your business who your dad has sex with and he shouldn't be obligated to tell you."
relationship_advice,fcvjwrn,t3_ej51k7,1578003671.0,"Why did you ask your dad for permission? You're an adult now. It's not your dads place to tell you what you can and can't do anymore. Being an adult means making your own decisions. I think the transition going from teen to adult can sometimes be difficult for parents because after 18 years of parenting, they need to sit back and watch their child make their own decisions and mistakes and it's hard to not revert back to that parenting role. It's also hard to get out of the habit of asking for parents permission and not falling back into the child role. The whole relationship dynamic has changed and you're both still trying to find a footing in your new roles.

So no, I dont think your dad is justified, but I can see where hes coming from. Maybe sit down with him and have a mature conversation about what both your expectations are. Sorry if that's worded weirdly, I've just woken up."

The parents have a shitty, patronising holier than thou attitude and honestly, it's not ok that they told you that you should be grateful for being allowed to spend time with them. That's a terrible thing to say. And yes, your boyfriend should be sticking up for you and not pandering to his sister. She shouldn't be allowed to get away with throwing a tantrum every time something doesn't go her way.

I honestly dont know what to advise. I definitely think you should talk to your boyfriend again. Ideally it would be good for your boyfriend to leave with you to show a united front. He definitely needs to talk to his sister and let her know that her attitude is unacceptable.

I'm sorry that you're in this situation."

If she feels the same then congratulations! 

If she doesn't, move on. It will hurt and it won't be easy, but you have to respect her feelings. Trying to manipulate her into a relationship like others have suggested is a shit thing to do. 

Life isn't a rom com or a Disney movie. A lot of the time you're going to like someone who doesn't like you back and no amount of stalking and harassment will fix that.

This is very much a crime that doesn't have a grey area. I could understand hesitating to report someone who murdered someone else as self defense (eg victim of abuse), but this is clear cut.

He has committed crimes. He deserves to go to jail and face the consequences. He should have considered what he was putting his family through before doing anything, but he didn't. He is selfishly disregarding the law AND his family for his weird, sick obsession.

Also the family might not be without options. If the mother won't divorce him and get alimony/whatever you have there, then they could split assets/money before he goes to jail, providing his assets/finances aren't from something illegal. I don't know their financial situation apart from that his father earns good money. Maybe OP is lying and this is all a creative writing exercise."

Better lighting shows off the area more and turns the quality from home-movie-amateur to clear and professional and inviting. Also fluid camera movement showing off the area and close ups of different furnishings. It helps the viewer to feel more connected to the space they're being shown.

I feel like your mum had a knee jerk reaction of feeling wounded so she lashed out by trying to hurt you with what's essentially an ""all or nothing"" ultimatum.

I can see how it makes OP uncomfortable. Her friend is her peer, someone who she relates to. Now her friend has gone and fucked her father, who isn't her peer and hes the last person in the world she would have sex with. Its definitely awkward. 

I'm just repeating myself now but they're both consenting adults. Her father isn't JUST her father. Hes also his own person with a sex drive and once again hes an adult capable of making his own choices as is the friend, and theres nothing wrong with enjoying sex as he seems to.

Stop obsessing about other peoples sex life and concentrate on your own.

relationship_advice,fcvjwrn,t3_ej51k7,1578003671.0,"Why did you ask your dad for permission? You're an adult now. It's not your dads place to tell you what you can and can't do anymore. Being an adult means making your own decisions. I think the transition going from teen to adult can sometimes be difficult for parents because after 18 years of parenting, they need to sit back and watch their child make their own decisions and mistakes and it's hard to not revert back to that parenting role. It's also hard to get out of the habit of asking for parents permission and not falling back into the child role. The whole relationship dynamic has changed and you're both still trying to find a footing in your new roles.

So no, I dont think your dad is justified, but I can see where hes coming from. Maybe sit down with him and have a mature conversation about what both your expectations are. Sorry if that's worded weirdly, I've just woken up."

He has committed crimes. He deserves to go to jail and face the consequences. He should have considered what he was putting his family through before doing anything, but he didn't. He is selfishly disregarding the law AND his family for his weird, sick obsession.

Also the family might not be without options.
