todayilearned,ff8w8tv,t1_ff7wf6k,1579698166.0,"The only women in Ancient Rome who could be considered fully emancipated and equal to men were the priestesses of Vesta, the famous Vestal Virgins, because they were spiritually wed to the deified concept of the Roman state. And even then it was only for the duration of their time as priestesses - a thirty year span. Afterwards they were normal (if highly regarded for their service) Roman noblewomen and it was expected and encouraged for them to marry."

This isn't America with it's Second Amendment rights and rampant gun ownership. It'll be a slaughter."

Meanwhile my brother-in-law is fully bilingual and when he and my sister went to Paris he was treated like a long-lost cousin. I suppose I thought France would appreciate someone from overseas who spoke their language, even if it is oddly accented or flavoured with Quebecois."

HongKong,femv75n,t1_femdye9,1579270479.0,"It comes from Chinese legal history. The most extreme of punishments under the old Imperial legal code was the so-called ""Nine familial exterminations"", reserved for capital offenses such as treason, sedition, rebellion, and others under the [Ten Abominations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ten_Abominations). This involved execution, by slow slicing (a particularly horrifying and bloody method, not outlawed until the modern Chinese era in

-  The criminal's living parents

- The criminal's living grandparents

- Any children the criminal may have, over a certain age (generally 16, though it varied over different eras, children below that age becoming slaves) and—if married—their spouses.

- Any grandchildren the criminal may have, over a certain age (and  enslavement of the underage) and—if married—their spouses.

- Siblings and siblings-in-law (the siblings of the criminal and that of his or her spouse, in the case where he or she is married)

- Uncles and aunts of the criminal, as well as their spouses

- The criminal's cousins (in case of Korea, this includes up to second and third cousins)

- The criminal himself"

Seems the opinions are divided along generational lines - the older ones (my parents, aunts and uncles, their spouses and my grandmas) are all pro-China. Theirs is the first generation out of China, and grew up in India/Pakistan/UK before settling in Canada.

Meanwhile, me and my cousins (and their spouses), who were all born and raised here either in Canada or stateside, are all pro-democracy and support the HK protesters.

And that's not touching the passive-aggressive War of the WiFi Network Names I unwittingly instigated in my apartment building."
