puppy101,fdvlxcd,t1_fdsdgqt,1578748813.0,Thank you! We also do the grass mat on the patio but our puppy seems to be okay with that for now. She gets zoomies frequently though so thank you for the friend’s house idea!
puppy101,fds9ikd,t1_fds3sr4,1578697457.0,"As a new puppy owner, do you mind me asking when you finally felt comfortable bringing your pup outside? I’m in a similar situation with the apartment lifestyle and can see her looking out the windows wistfully!"
puppy101,fdrm5pw,t1_fdrbz4e,1578686418.0,"I have a strange mix of both of these puppies in my corgi pup. She’s 9 weeks old and has not had an accident in the house (we use a grass training pad), sleeps through the night without a mess, and is incredibly smart. But, when she’s playful, she will chew on any and everything. That said, she redirects to her toys really easily and listens to “no” the first time. I did a lot of reading on various subs, websites, and books when we were looking for a puppy and the day before we got her, almost backed out because I was afraid of not being able to handle all the scaries that people describe in their own puppies. I’m only a week into having her so there’s every potential that this will change, but so far, I have not felt like she was an inconvenience whatsoever."

corgi,fcxjrb7,t1_fcxa9qu,1578064646.0,Thank you! She slept the whole car ride home and only needed 2 potty breaks last night. Today she’s much more active!
