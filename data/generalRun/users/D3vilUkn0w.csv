This is 100% true. I am one of those morons! I nearly failed out of college (I did eventually get my degree, but boy...it took a while), went through some family drama because of it, and now two decades later I'm doing extremely well. Just a gentle suggestion: why not study your ass off for those 9 hours? Don't stare at the walls dude. That will make you cray cray."

>Work smart for massive companies that would treat it like a problem and not a tragedy if you died at your desk.


I've been using the management version of this ""work smart"" approach for many years and have been promoted several times while not working very hard at all. Its hilariously effective. 


Basically I delegate most things to folks who work for me and want to climb the ladder. Its win-win; my staff are treated seriously and I provide them with training and experience while lightening my own workload to completely manageable proportions. As a result, my bosses see that I do high-quality work and get everything done on time. They promote me and give me raises, and I do the same for my acolytes. As the workload increases, I simply hire more people. The senior executives see this and think ""that guy is really growing our company, he's amazing"" and promote me again. At some point, some of the people under me become almost as competent (or, frankly, more so) as me. These folks might be seen at some point as a cheaper alternative to replace me, so I am careful to give them healthy raises, praising them up and down and telling them what a great job they are doing when I do so. Now they make almost as much as I do and no longer represent a cheaper alternative to upper management. Meanwhile they work harder than ever for me, and I gain a reputation as a guy who really cares about his people (in fact this is also true). I've been repeating this cycle  over and over for a long time and it has worked beautifully. I make good money, have a corner office, keep regular hours, seldom feel stressed, my group is happy and growing all the time, and I've got a stellar reputation. So yes - always work smart."
