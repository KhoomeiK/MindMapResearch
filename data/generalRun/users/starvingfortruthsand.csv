SuicideWatch,fgkztd7,t3_eysa2j,1580877754.0,"Living is so so hard. I don’t want to sound insensitive or cheesy, I hope there is something that can help with the bad feelings for you. For me it’s been music."

FriendshipAdvice,fgazwl8,t1_fgaxz0x,1580657093.0,Thank you. This makes a lot of sense.
SuicideWatch,fgav5og,t1_fgat47k,1580655730.0,I agree. Anytime I share personal struggles or share deeply I feel like people don't want me to be real with them and sometimes will go as far as to make fun of me or minimize what I am going through. At the same time they want me to support them. They want to keep up their illusion of what I am but allow themselves to be a whole being. I don't like being around people like that.
