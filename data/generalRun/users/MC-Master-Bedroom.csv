NoStupidQuestions,ff6k8fj,t3_erxj2b,1579628977.0,"The right to bear arms has been perverted by the NRA and its industrial backers to become a paranoid political movement opposed to any common sense rules on gun control.   


I'm a gun user myself but the lack of restrictions on the sale and ownership for people with criminal records and  mental health issues is simply inexcusable.   


Take simple measures like closing the gun show loophole which allows people in many states to buy guns with no background checks and dubious ID. The majority of Americans, including the majority of gun owners, support that move. But the NRA opposes it and feeds the conspiracy frenzy that ANY rules are the start of a secret disarmament plan.   


The general public now lumps all 2a advocates in with the NRA and the marginal groups (militias, nationalists/white supremacists, conspiracy theorists, etc.) opposed to even discussing common sense rules.    


To be pro 2a is seen by many people as being a dangerous nut. Just another example of how American society is being split into ""us vs them"" with no civil discourse possible with ""the enemy"".    



TL:DR - Thanks to the NRA and extremist groups, people assume all 2a advocates are ""gun nuts"" who want the right to open carry flamethrowers."
