BuyItForLife,ff69wbk,t3_err5p9,1579622531.0,"Great setup. I would recommend that if you get burnt out on analog photography, you check out digital. You can get a digital camera body and an adapter and use all these lenses on it. A decent enough body should be cheap; often the most expensive part (since you won't need the functionality of a high end DSLR) of digital kits are the lenses, and it looks like you have 3 good primes there already. 

And if you're wondering why you would burn out on analog photography? On top of how difficult it is to learn from your mistakes weeks after you take the photos, even finding someone to process film is very hard now. Which means it's more expensive. And more time consuming. And access to film is limited as well. 

Regardless, the stuff you have is amazing. Hope you find some joy out of it."
