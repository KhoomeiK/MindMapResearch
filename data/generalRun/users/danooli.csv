Her hardest hue to hold.

Then leaf subsides to leaf.

So Eden sank to grief,

So dawn goes down to day.

Nothing gold can stay."

Luckily, we just had a house full of smoke and the cats were able to get away from it. We're still airing out the house, but there was no fire, for which we are very thankful. And lucky."
