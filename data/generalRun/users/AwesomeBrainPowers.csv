All we're talking about is policy—because this is politics, not a smoky café or the Algonquin Round Table.

That’s incredibly reductive and not really how the law works.

I *want* them to not try to limit what a doctor is permitted to say to a woman who needs a doctor. I *want* them to recognize that outlawing abortion will only increase maternal mortality rates. (And, just for good measure, I’ll repeat: I want them to understand that they don’t get to control the bodies of grown, able-minded adults—because having a uterus doesn’t make anyone *less* deserving of individual rights.)

politics,fgihysk,t1_fgic7l2,1580822195.0,"There are arguments to be made that our current system is misrepresentative of both the demographics and the democratic will of the population—in that it places a *drastically* lopsided importance on some extremely rural and homogeneous states with more cattle than people in them—for sure.


Some counter-arguments are as follows:

-	More populous states already have the advantage of granting more delegates to a candidate, so the media attention is the only reason a candidate would ever come to one of these other states at all. (This presupposes that it is a net positive to pay attention to tiny populations. I’m not saying it *isn’t*, but that’s a necessary belief-condition for this argument.)
-	Starting with smaller states can be a boon to upstart or less well-financed campaigns. (People like to point to Carter and Obama as examples.)
-	These smaller states act like test beds or laboratories (or, more specifically, microscopes) for campaigns: The voters in Iowa and New Hampshire take this stuff *really* seriously, tend to me more informed and engaged, and are a decent way to vet candidates’ stamina, draw-power, messaging, etc.


To be honest, I don’t know if there’s a truly *right* answer here—or at least sufficient data to support either simultaneous or staggered primaries over the other.

One definite problem is how the staggered primaries affect actual policy: For example, Iowa’s position in the electoral cycle is very likely to blame for our government’s [idiotic fuel-ethanol mandate](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/11/ethanol-has-forsaken-us/602191/), 
as that single state produces [30% of the country’s ethanol](https://www.iowacorn.org/media-page/corn-facts). (Then again, it’s entirely possible that simultaneous primaries would have similar effects—only those would favor larger states.)

Ultimately, it’s just another manifestation of the push/pull between larger states wanting to *not* be disproportionately undervalued and smaller states wanting to not be ignored—which has been a part of this country’s politics since literally before it was a country at all.

Given [how different elections in the UK are from ours](https://qz.com/1743234/the-three-main-differences-between-us-and-uk-elections/), it would probably take weeks to be able to give a comprehensive explanation of why we’re like this.

They've managed to make that same kind of rubber/leather thing work pretty well on some other skins (e.g., Wisp, Titania's deluxe, the ribbony bits from Limbo's deluxe, both the base *and* the deluxe Harrow vestments, the tails on Mesa Presidio's jacket), though, which is why I'm hoping we were just seeing a pre-final version of Protea."
Warframe,fg4ip2a,t1_fg4cjfe,1580504053.0,"Her kit and concept sound very exciting, but her model looks like something left over from the very first few batches of designs: weirdly chunky and rigid, with no real textural variety.

I'm hoping it's just an unfinished model that's getting a few cosmetic passes before it ships."
Warframe,fg4g64h,t1_fg47gmu,1580502761.0,"Yeah, it sounds like they're just using the console to cycle pets (kind of like how the other console displays your last-used robotic companion).

Warframe,fg4clwh,t1_fg4bne7,1580500901.0,"Yeah, the thing that made the helmet look so great is that it really commits to the concept of having more empty space than hard surfaces and then filling that space with energy.

If the abdomen and extremities had more of that, it would be an instant buy for me."
Warframe,fg4b5d1,t1_fg49hze,1580500012.0,"Yeah, the helmet is great, but the rest of the skin looks more like just a really, *really* good TennoGen instead of a full-on deluxe (which tend to have more significant differences from the base skin)."

politics,fg3xkiw,t1_fg3l85b,1580491809.0,"ATD programs have existed [since at least 2003](https://www.gao.gov/assets/670/666911.pdf) (PDF warning!), but, yeah: They were seldom more than pilot programs and didn't get any *serious* funding until 2009.


""Aggressive Deterrence"" was absolutely an abysmal policy goal, but it was [halted and reversed in federal court rather quickly](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/immigration-detention-injunction_n_6724662) and that ruling was [later upheld by an appeals court](https://www.dallasnews.com/news/immigration/2018/06/19/how-trump-s-zero-tolerance-policy-differs-from-the-ways-bush-and-obama-treated-immigrant-families/).

For the record: Yes, it is shameful that it required a court order *and* an appeal in the first place.

It's also horrific that those decisions led to [a massive increase of immigration raids](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/01/the-obama-administrations-crackdown-on-central-american-migrants/422550/).


My goal here isn't to defend Obama's immigration policies (or anti-immigrant actions); I just think [there are several non-trivial distinctions to be made—in intent, priority, and execution—between Obama's policies and Trump's](https://www.migrationpolicy.org/article/obama-record-deportations-deporter-chief-or-not)."

politics,fg3khnp,t1_fg3jld6,1580483693.0,"First, here are some contemporary news stories about the pushback the Obama administration got:

Second:


Many overcrowded and/or overburdened detention facilities during the Obama administration [were the result of the government being unprepared for a sudden and unexpected influx of people crossing the border](https://www.businessinsider.com/migrant-children-in-cages-2014-photos-explained-2018-5),
and they [created alternative-to-detention programs to try and get people *out* of those facilities as quickly as possible](https://qz.com/1312707/trumps-family-detention-policy-vs-obamas-more-humane-alternative-to-jailing-immigrant-families/).

Trump, on the other hand, [ended AtD programs](https://www.theatlantic.com/news/archive/2017/06/ice-shuts-down-program-for-asylum-seekers/529887/)—despite the fact that they were cheaper than detention (see link to QZ, above)
and [98% successful](https://www.oig.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/assets/2017-12/OIG-18-22-Nov17.pdf)—
and [voluntarily overburdened an already-strained system by instituting his draconian ""zero-tolerance"" policy in an explicit attempt to provide a deterrent effect](https://www.npr.org/2018/05/29/615079848/following-up-on-1-500-missing-immigrant-children-in-the-u-s)—in essence, to terrorize potential migrants (and their families) by creating a nightmarish scenario for them upon arrival.



And, before anyone wants to jump in with “but those AtD programs used too small a sample pool!”:

Those articles used a few AtD programs as an example. [This Cato Institute article](https://www.cato.org/blog/alternatives-detention-are-cheaper-indefinite-detention) analyzes *many* such programs and demonstrates how they’re all cheaper and basically as effective.



I’m not defending the use of detention camps or the practice of family separation at all, but it is incorrect (if not disingenuous) to suggest that what Trump is doing is the same thing."

2.	The family from this article are asylum-seekers who presented themselves to CBP at a port of entry.
3.	International treaties—that the US has signed—prohibit criminalizing (or penalizing in any way) asylum-seekers.
4.	The article even cites CBP’s own (written) policy to keep families together whenever possible.
5.	Again: This family presented themselves to border enforcement, which is all that asylum-seekers are required to do by international law (to which we have agreed)."
