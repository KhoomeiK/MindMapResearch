xxfitness,ffgkq5c,t1_ffgg87j,1579908474.0,"> I genuinely think walking and daily not-necessarily-intended-as-exercise movement is one of the most important parts here.

Yep, NEAT is much bigger than a lot of people realize (though daily steps could be considered either NEAT or intentional exercise depending on how the person views them). People rarely believe me when I say I used to burn 700-800 cals/day just through walking and not much else, and for awhile I even doubted it myself, but months of using the adaptive TDEE spreadsheet confirmed it for me. Even in this thread you can see that a lot of the women with the highest TDEEs are averaging quite a lot of steps in addition to whatever their actual exercise routines look like."
xxfitness,ffg7qx7,t1_ffg66jc,1579900277.0,"Yeah it's common to think walking ""doesn't count"" but it definitely does when you do a lot of it. 15-20K steps is 7-10 miles (depending on stride length-- that's about what it would be for me). When you think about it in those terms it becomes much more obvious that it would count as activity. The fact that it feels easy doesn't mean it doesn't burn calories; humans are very well-adapted for walking and can do it over long distances without much strain. That's also why it can be great exercise. When I was less fit I could burn way more calories walking than by doing just about anything else, simply because it was so easy on my body. 

Again, take what other people tell you with a grain of salt (including me!). Track your intake and see what your weight does, and refine from there.

ETA: I'm prepared to get some downvotes for saying this, but I also think the tendency to dismiss walking is something of a gatekeeping thing in fitness subs. Walking is easy and anyone can do it, so it can't actually be good for that much, not like ""real"" exercise (which always seems to mean lifting and running for some reason)."
fatlogic,ffg4vi4,t1_ffg2mk9,1579898508.0,"Awesome! I like to run but have never really felt all that interested in a marathon, but I admit this movie did make me consider trying to do the NYC marathon at some point just because it looked like such a fun route :)"
xxfitness,ffg4lju,t3_eteizy,1579898338.0,"I'm 41, 5'7, 173lbs, and I have a desk job. I'm planning to lose more weight this year but my maintenance calories are currently around 2600-2700. I'm lifting and triathlon training now, but I've also maintained at the same amount of calories with nothing but a boatload of walking, like 14-15K steps a day (I was also a bit heavier then). I mention that because often people think that only ""hard"" activity burns substantive calories, but easy activity can too if you do a lot of it. 

Also if you're counting calories and weighing yourself regularly, weight really can't sneak up on you. If you see your weight trending up-- and I don't mean over a few days, I mean over a few weeks-- then eat a bit less. You have very little to lose by experimenting with eating a bit more. 

Finally, a lot of people think they need absurdly low calories to maintain, but keep in mind it's very common to underestimate intake. If someone tells me they weigh 130lbs and maintain on 1200cals/day-- and they aren't 70 years old and don't have a thyroid problem-- I know I've just found someone who doesn't weigh their food. Don't compare yourself to others; just troubleshoot until you find the right intake level for you."

I would say I'm surprised that the FA/HAES types found it ""fatphobic"" but of course I'm not. Obviously it's not good enough for them that Brittany's focus on weight loss led her to injure herself, or that she eventually threw out her scale, or that she told off her skinny roommate for being a toxic friend and bad person, or that she acknowledged that her self-hatred led her to treat the fat woman at the BBQ badly (or that said fat woman basically said ""hey I'm happy with my body and my life, you should try it!""). Brittany still lost some weight and the movie dared to imply that maybe that wasn't a terrible and unhealthy thing, so of course the entire thing is garbage. The only acceptable outcome would have been Brittany checking herself into ED recovery with a HAES dietician, gaining all of the weight back (plus another 15lbs to prove that dieting made her setpoint go up), and then wearing a ""Riots Not Diets"" shirt and finishing the marathon with a shockingly fast time to prove to all of those skinny fatphobic runners that size doesn't matter. Followed by her writing a book called ""My Big Fat Marathon"" and touring the US giving seminars on intuitive sports nutrition, sizeism in the running apparel industry, and how to prevent chub rub.

But, like you said, it felt too scattered and it was hard to see if I was really making progress. Lifting on my own schedule and being able to choose my own programming (I'm following 5/3/1) has helped me to progress much faster, and I also enjoy it more. 

I will say though that lifting without a class or instructor requires either some coaching or an investment of time into learning proper form. I've had some personal training sessions and that was really helpful, but I see from your previous comment that that's not in your budget. My BF is completely self-coached and has great technique, and he learned everything from reading Starting Strength (he didn't follow the SS program, but did learn a lot from it about how to perform the lifts correctly), as well as recording himself and doing research on what the lifts should look like.

I'm not a pro bodybuilder or even close; I've only been lifting for a couple months (though I did do some climbing the year before). Even so, I have visible muscle in my arms and shoulders, and I had broad shoulders to begin with, so someone could very well look at me and think that I look bigger than their preferred aesthetic. But that's at least partially because I still have fat to lose. If I didn't have muscle, I'd still be bigger up top than someone at a healthy weight, but I would look worse. Someone who avoids weights because they don't want to be ""bulky"" like I am would be making a huge mistake.

This is a little different from what you said in your first comment, which is that ""any ambulatory non-obese sedentary person who can bike and swim"" could do an Ironman (albeit ""with great difficulty""). I'm not saying absolutely no one could do it ever, just that the statement that any sedentary non-obese person could do it is a huge stretch. Especially because you also left out the second part of my quote:

> or at least would seriously injure themselves in the process

I think the thing you're overlooking is the sheer amount of stress that the body is being subjected to. It's not just about muscular endurance, but also about other structures and tissues-- bones, joints, tendons-- that are not adapted to that volume of exercise. Not to mention the risk of things like dehydration or bonking due to improper hydration or nutrition. But even if we're assuming that this person gets those things right, there's also the fact that all three legs need to be done successively. Even assuming that a sedentary person could swim the entire distance in open water without risk of drowning (not a given if their only experience is swimming in a pool where they can stop in between laps if they need a rest break-- drowning is really not that uncommon in triathlons even for shorter distances), breaststroke involves heavy use of the legs (hence why most triathletes don't favor it), and those same legs will then be asked to bike and walk distances that would be quite challenging on their own. The likelihood of some kind of muscular or joint injury is pretty high for someone who is doing an Ironman off the couch, with absolutely no preparation. (Hell, the likelihood of those kinds of injuries is high even for people who train properly for it. Which is the main reason I have no interest in doing an Ironman.) Obviously the risk is lower for a non-obese person, and I would buy that maybe someone who is quite young and healthy could do it without injuring themselves too badly, but that still doesn't make it something that ""any ambulatory non-obese sedentary person"" could do."

A sedentary person who tried to do an Ironman with absolutely no training would almost certainly not finish, or at least would seriously injure themselves in the process. The rest of your point totally stands though; her martyr complex is ridiculous. I actually *want* to do a triathlon this year (just a sprint, though, not an Ironman), and am having to work through some injuries and chronic pain to do it, and it really pisses me off to see her treating this like some kind of chore.

This is actually great advice and probably the thing they need to hear most. I honestly think the main problem most people have isn't lack of desire, or motivation, or willpower. It's that they don't really appreciate the importance of consistency over a long time horizon. They try to do too much and think they can just power through for a little while until they hit their goal. Behavioral change (which is what weight loss ultimately is) isn't about short-term feats of heroism; it's about making small and manageable changes, which then turn into habits, which you then repeat every day until you reach your goal. But that sounds way more boring. (This is also why I hate The Biggest Loser; it's taught people that the way to lose weight is to suffer over the short term. It's actually the opposite: you shouldn't suffer at all, but you should be prepared for it to take awhile.)

xxfitness,fef13pi,t3_eossxt,1579045700.0,"I'm similar to you: all of my favorite activities are done outside. I lift for the benefits but don't really enjoy it, and I'm only able to be consistent with it because my BF and I lift together, and we have a gym at home so I don't have to go anywhere. 

A few suggestions:

* Find a goal. I've decided I want to complete a sprint triathlon this year, so I'm much more motivated to do things I otherwise might not bother with, like getting up at 6am for a swim at the Y. 
* Consider bringing your outdoor workouts inside, if you can. Can you find a climbing gym? Or, since you mentioned you love biking, look into a smart trainer + Zwift. It's amazingly fun and engaging. I'll probably use mine even when it's nice out-- no cars!
* If you like the social element of working out but classes aren't doing it for you, look into some new sports maybe? My Y has things like pick-up basketball, volleyball, and racquetball. Maybe you can find something you really like at your gym. 

Good luck!"
fatlogic,fe2pep2,t1_fdy97hf,1578841447.0,Thanks so much! I'm glad my experience seems to be helpful for others. I hope the changes you mentioned bring good sleep for you too :)
fatlogic,fdswgyj,t1_fdsqnc4,1578708841.0,"Yeah running actually suppresses appetite for me, though I know it does the opposite for others. The only thing that really seems to increase my appetite is lifting, or swimming if the pool is cold and I don't hop in the hot tub afterwards."
fatlogic,fdsw677,t1_fdssqlf,1578708725.0,"Oh! Ha, sorry, my bad. Thank you for the sympathy, it is indeed pretty sucky! Though I'm glad the cream is working so well at least. It's been a huge relief."
fatlogic,fdsn7kb,t1_fdskeaj,1578705416.0,"Oh sorry, I just re-read my post and I realize it was unclear-- I definitely know repetitive stress shoulder injuries are a thing, I've been to physical therapy for mine. I just didn't know about capsaicin cream to relieve pain :)"
fatlogic,fdsik3x,t1_fds5me0,1578703420.0,"There are so many misunderstandings about exercise. Like that you have to kill yourself in the gym or run marathons to actually burn enough calories to make a difference. There was a year where I did almost nothing besides walk, and I burned an extra 500 cals/day from that alone. (At the time I burned around 100 cals/mile, so that was about 5 miles of walking per day, which I did over my lunch break and in the evenings.) And it didn't increase my appetite at all since the intensity wasn't that high. Which means I basically got to eat a whole extra meal every day, or several snacks, or a snack and a dessert, or whatever. It absolutely made a difference in how easy it was to lose weight. 

Ironically enough people seem to make the opposite assumption now that I'm training for a triathlon-- they all figure I must have such an easy time losing weight because I'm burning so many calories. But it's actually way harder because if I cut too fast my workouts feel terrible. It was so much easier to lose weight when I was just walking a ton and not really doing much else."
fatlogic,fds7dci,t1_fds3xdx,1578696016.0,"Oh, sure :) There are a few parts to it:

* I made my bedroom darker and tried to eliminate noises or other things that might wake me up (still working on this with my cat)
* I avoid screens, snacks, and liquids an hour before bedtime
* 20-30 minutes before bedtime, I change into my PJs, brush my teeth, take melatonin, and do any prep stuff for the next day, like packing my gym bag
* Then I get into bed and read until I fall asleep, or cuddle with my BF (he goes to bed later but will come hang out with me while I'm falling asleep)

That's basically it. I think the exact routine is probably not all that important, aside from the avoiding screens/snacking/liquids. The rest is just a way to signal to your brain that the day is over and it's time to go to bed. Anything that relaxes you would probably work: hot bath, some stretches, meditation, etc. I think the typical advice not to use the bedroom for anything but sleep and sex is good too. I don't have a TV in my bedroom and I'm basically only in there for those two activities, so my brain associates that room with with feeling relaxed. 

I hope this helps. I know how hard it is to function on poor sleep. Maybe consider the melatonin too if your doctor agrees (not sure if it's contraindicated for bipolar)."
fatlogic,fds16i4,t1_fdrjv2s,1578692715.0,"It's funny, I saw a coworker bring some yogurt and berries into a morning meeting, and I almost made some comment about how healthy it looked, mostly as a way to make conversation. And then I was like... no, self, don't say that, that's obnoxious. So I just said that the blueberries looked really tasty instead, and he agreed they were, and we had a nice little chat about our favorite berries. I think sometimes people just say dumb things on autopilot because they're trying to make small talk, but it's really annoying to be on the receiving end of that shit all the time."
fatlogic,fds0swj,t3_ems7pb,1578692481.0,"My stylist, who I've been seeing for years and really like, told me at my last appointment that if I kept losing weight I'd vanish into thin air. It was actually kind of funny mainly because of her delivery. Like, ""GIIIIIRL, you're getting TINY! When you turn SIDEWAYS I can't even SEE YOU!"" I just laughed and was like, don't worry, I promise I will not lose so much weight that I cease to exist. I realized later that she's kind of my best barometer for whether I'm visibly losing weight, because I see her every couple months, which is long enough that she actually notices changes, but not so long that she forgot what size I was the last time she saw me. 

I actually don't have a lot to rant about this week. I'm sleeping way better with the help of some melatonin + better sleep hygiene, and my BF-- bless him-- picked up some capsaicin cream for me to try on my shoulder to help manage pain from a repetitive stress injury. (I had no idea that was a thing.) Which means I'm actually feeling refreshed and pain-free for the first time in... um... I don't know how long. A couple years at least? The improved sleep hygiene also requires me to avoid screens before bed, so I've been doing more sketching and reading instead of watching TV and/or mindlessly scrolling through reddit on the couch. Which also means I'm snacking less, both because I'm more mentally engaged in the evening, and also because I'm less tired. And being less tired means I can work out more consistently, which means I sleep better *and* eat better. It's kind of amazing how good habits can all build on each other like that. Hope I can keep it going :)"

fatlogic,fdlg888,t1_fdkjnih,1578523352.0,"160 is only one pound overweight for 5'7 (BMI of 25.1). 150-160 is a fine range for someone that height. But there's also nothing wrong with 130; it's still a healthy BMI. Not sure why people think their subjective aesthetic preferences should determine another person's goal weight. Like, mind your own business.

Good luck on the weight loss! I'm still working on it myself (those last 10-15lbs really do take forever). You can do it :)"
fatlogic,fcyk0c1,t1_fcyhm3l,1578081383.0,"Very true. Honestly if HAES were explicitly promoted as a harm reduction strategy for people who have failed repeatedly to lose weight, I would respect that. But, like you said, that would require acknowledging that being overweight is harmful."

They'll get a million different suggestions for how to address it indirectly (strengthening! yoga! physical therapy! supplements!) but the most obvious solution is totally off the table. I can understand that approach for someone who really does have a long history of failed weight loss attempts and who is just at the point where they need to try some other solutions, but HAES recommends this approach for *every* fat person, even those who have never even tried weight loss and might be totally successful with it first try, like I was."

Sorry, my position wasn't clear from my first comment, but if you check my post history you'll see that I post a lot on r/fatlogic making a lot of the points you just made (that weight loss is hard, that compassion is important, and that smug self-righteousness solves nothing). I used to be into fat acceptance myself and there are parts of it I still believe in (I even used to be a Ragen fangirl, back in the day, before I stopped drinking the koolaid-- and yes that does make me cringe now, haha). But the defeatism around success rates is a sore point for me because if I'd known the truth sooner, I also would have lost weight sooner.

I took a rain check on the hike I was supposed to do with friends today, just because I knew my nose would run like crazy, and I also slept badly last night so energy is low. Will at least try to get some steps in today but I doubt I'll be up for anything more ambitious.

The one silver lining of being sick is I had a lot of time to really sit down and think about my 2020 goals. I came up with a few (some fitness-related, one for art, another for reading, plus a professional goal) and planned everything out with milestones, timelines, and attached rewards. Dorky but fun. The rewards are in-theme, so, e.g., deadlifting my bodyweight means I can buy some new workout clothing at Athleta, or reading a certain number of books means I get to splurge on a couple new hardcovers (something I rarely do; I'm generally a paperback-from-the-used-bookstore kind of person). Feels good. I think the goals are reasonable and not too ambitious, but only time will tell whether I calibrated things correctly. We'll see how much I get done :)"

(She's always been a slim person so I know she just loses the weight when she goes home.)

For myself, I'm definitely up a pound, maybe two, but trying not to let it get to me. It happens every Christmas and I fix it every January. I'm much more bothered by this cold I picked up a few days ago. I had grand plans for spending my last few vacation days doing some running, some group bike rides, and a hike with friends on New Year's Day, but instead I've just been sitting around in my PJs and feeling sorry for myself (though I am hoping I will be well enough for the hike tomorrow). It's especially annoying since this is my first real cold since I started losing weight-- I haven't been properly sick for almost three years now. I was starting to think maybe I had a new superpower. Sadly no. Though this cold is much less severe than the ones I used to get, so I guess that's something.

Happy New Year everyone :)"

I picked up some tendinitis in week 5, and while I can't say for sure that the 4x/week schedule is why, my physical therapist thinks it probably contributed. And I was already in pretty decent shape with a good aerobic base from lots of biking and hiking. I think people like me are actually at more risk, since we aren't limited by our cardiovascular system, and can run to the point of injury long before we actually feel tired."
