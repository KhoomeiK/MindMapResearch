GamePhysics,fd2nd0a,t1_fd27ovs,1578149688.0,"Your actual health and stamina is the ring that goes around the ""core"" (the heart, lightning and eye) . The core determines the regeneration of your health and stamina. If the core is full, that means you will be able to regenerate, but if you watch close while you regenerate, the cores will slowly deplete. Once they are empty, no more regeneration. So eating/drinking helps to keep your cores up, which is why you always want some sort of food/drink on you. 

Tonics work to instantly refill the rings, but have no effect on the core at all. Really tonics are used if you need a quick boost in the middle of a fight.  Your will notice some tonics turn your rings yellow, this ""reinforces"" your rings which pretty much means you have an unlimited use for a short amount of time without the ring draining. 

Dead eye works pretty much the same, but in order to refill the ring, you need to land shots and get kills, with headshots having the biggest effect of refilling the dead eye ring."
