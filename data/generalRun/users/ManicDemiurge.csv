Paranormal,fewf80x,t3_eqpkgt,1579409596.0,"Look up hypnopompic hallucinations. These are hallucinations that are caused within everyone, and they occur when you're still waking up. You could have been still partially asleep, as that happens quite often. For some reason, I have a LOT of hypnopompic and hypnagogic hallucinations, so this happens to me daily. I talk to people in my sleep and when I'm falling asleep, and when I'm waking up. For example, one time I had a mini-conversation with my girlfriend and kissed her (my pillow) goodnight. Then, a couple seconds later, when I fully woke up, I realized I was in my bed without my girlfriend, and that I just kissed my pillow. I slapped myself."
AskReddit,fevswo4,t3_eqies2,1579401051.0,"When I was little (10-15) I saw two things:

1. An airplane that looked like it happened to be completely stationary mid-air. We were in a moving car, the airplane was going the same direction we were, and the airplane didn't follow us or go in front of. It just chilled there.
2. A bird that flew into a rock in the ground. It just poofed. I don't know if it hid somewhere like under the rock, but I just saw it dive straight into the fucking rock and gone.

To be fair I'm probably psychotic but that's not the point."
unpopularopinion,fevshpe,t3_eqh2c2,1579400915.0,"I almost took my life when I was 10. I cried every day and every night. Depression and anxiety were high. I hated myself for so many reasons. No one believed me though, until I was sent to a mental hospital when I was 16 and got a genuine diagnosis."
schizophrenia,fethb9f,t1_ferfch2,1579375472.0,"I’m not insane. Why are delusions considered psychotic if they are just beliefs? No one can prove me wrong because nothing’s trustworthy. Just because I’m the only one that sees them doesn’t mean I’m insane. I can’t tell you about them, you may or may not find out about them. It depends on who you are.

schizophrenia,feokz9w,t1_feojzut,1579301571.0,"The fact that I want to kill myself to release myself from this world might worry them. I’m not going to, though. I want to stay for my girlfriend. She’s real.

The fact that I have thoughts about hurting others, MY thoughts, might also worry them. I know I won’t tell them, but if they somehow find out.

Edit: I don’t think I’ll follow through with hurting anyone, I have an alter that stops me if I come close, which has only happened a couple times."

schizophrenia,fenulg0,t1_fentegr,1579291029.0,"I thought dissociative identity disorder counted as a personality disorder as well? I have 12+ alters that all experience my symptoms as well, I just suffer more greatly. I do not want to be diagnosed because then my life will be stripped away.
