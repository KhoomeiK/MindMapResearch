Trump calls people who disagree with him “spies” and says they should be convicted of treason (“and you know what we used to do to people like that...”) yet this man was allegedly watching a US ambassador on foreign soil and tracking her movements for Parnas. Even went as far as to say that money can make anything happen in Ukraine, which is *really* troubling. But he shouldn’t be tried for treason? Interesting double standard.

Honestly, I’m not sure if he was actually getting the intel on her he said he was. He is famous for his inability to tell the truth and for taking things way too far.

You make an excellent point. Greg’s default was to worry about how this horrific incident would affect *him*. It certainly doesn’t sound like her wellbeing was at the forefront of his mind. Even when he spoke to the cop he couldn’t contain himself. At first, worried that she may have hit the landscaping rocks and wanted the doctor to see exactly where she fell (as if saying “from a second story window onto concrete” isn’t sufficient) but that quickly gave way to mentioning being concerned that he would need to prove his innocence.

I’m interested in this camera that sits facing the property across the street. He showed the police the Ring doorbell footage knowing full well (I’m sure he sits and watches those cameras sometimes, c’mon) that it wouldn’t capture her fall. The camera across the way shows the front of their house and would definitely show what happened...right? Why not just use that? It all seems very, very odd to me. I’m troubled by this.
