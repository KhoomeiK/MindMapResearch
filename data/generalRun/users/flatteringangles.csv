I can’t believe I never noticed this was a side effect from the dope- I thought I was genuinely in love and lust with this one guy I used to live/use with. I would’ve fucked him all day if he let me (he didn’t- had trouble getting it up from dope + intimacy issues) and I don’t feel like that about anyone all these years later, which is frustrating and sad."
