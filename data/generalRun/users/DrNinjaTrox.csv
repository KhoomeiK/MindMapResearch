politics,ff3rdk2,t1_ff3lbpg,1579547205.0,I have no issue with leaving dental and vision out of a universal system. I'm used to paying for those things on my own already. I'd rather have taxes go up some if it means my overall out of pocket costs decrease which it sounds like they definitely would. Maybe one day this country will move to it.
politics,ff2uijx,t1_ff2cziv,1579524684.0,"So the basic healthcare is covered by the government but you can get ""extra"" through your company if they provide it?

I dont get company healthcare at all at my job but I do get some money every month towards my own plan. Dental and vision have always been separate from ""normal healthcare"" for me on my own.  When I was a kid my moms health coverage through work would pay for like two cleanings for dental and one eye exam a year, coverage in the US has definitely gotten worse for more money."
