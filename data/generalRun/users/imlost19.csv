I think graffiti serves a purpose though, it can beautify ugly areas of cities and make them more alive. Look at wynwood, Miami for example. That area was a dangerous hell hole 10 years ago, basically an abandoned warehouse district. All the buildings are ugly. But now it’s one of the most popular tourist attractions in Miami.

people wanted their space fantasy to continue indefinitely but there's no money in selling merchandise for 30 year old movies (at least not traditionally).
