We took her to the Dr for a exam and she was stage 3 Alzheimers, sundowners, and dementia.   I guess they can seem totally normal when its people and places they know.

The internet and video makes it possible to find out stuff officers did but you almost never get to use other proof in a court of law.  

Most officers havent written a police report in years they use a template that is just saved on the computer desktop where they input reports.   Lawyers try to argue the report has nothing related to a incident ( cop testimony will end up totally different from his report). Judges often say they send emails that were copied from something else.   Police reports are not considered evidence so what is written in them doesnt have to match what they testify to under oath.  

So basically they can change the story on the stand and not be asked why the report they wrote said something else."

The internet and video makes it possible to find out stuff officers did but you almost never get to use other proof in a court of law.  

Most officers haven’t written a police report in years they use a template that is just saved on the computer desktop where they input reports.   Lawyers try to argue the report has nothing related to a incident ( cop testimony will end up totally different from his report). Judges often say they send emails that were copied from something else.   Police reports are not considered evidence so what is written in them doesn’t have to match what they testify to under oath.  

So basically they can change the story on the stand and not be asked why the report they wrote said something else."

They did not pay grandmas bills for ambulances they instructed her caregivers not to call 911 since ambulances  had a city fee not covered by medi -care. and they moved out of state and left grandma near me.  When I went to visit I was told my grandma had no diapers and they could not get in touch with my mom.   So my mom would say go buy diapers she doesn’t trust the place to charge it on her credit card. 

They filed a forged grant deed so I reported it to the PD where my grandmas house was.   That should have barred them from future jobs with PD real estate forgery is one of the only automatic no hires in LE.
