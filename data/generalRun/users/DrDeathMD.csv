AskReddit,fend5e7,t3_epyrmi,1579282141.0,"It's wasteful, it's a pain in the ass, and it's a financial burden. If forty people driving their own cars instead all rode on one bus, there would be forty fewer cars clogging up the freeway. Even more if everyone took the train. You don't need to put an entire vehicle on the road just for yourself. You are contributing to traffic congestion and pollution. And cars are almost as financially draining as babies. Gasoline, maintenance, registration are expenses I don't want. All the expenses caused by owning a car add up to far more than daily transit fare. and should I get in a fender bender, car parts and body shop labor are horribly overpriced. Not only would I be paying out of my ass to keep my car on the road but I could go broke from one little accident if it's my fault. And that's another thing: every second I am behind the wheel I am risking getting in an accident. If a bus gets in an accident, whose fault is it? Not mine. And finally, I just prefer the freedom of being able to go anywhere I want without being tethered to a car. I like the liberating feeling of not needing a car to go places. I like never needing to find a place to park."
