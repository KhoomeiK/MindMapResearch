Another comment I have is that the early game is severely bottlenecked by the rate of ore delivery. For example I have started a new game, (to get better starting asteroids), and have two outposts making ~20k/s but due to the slow delivery of ore I actually make around 950/s. The research items take too long to upgrade the delivery speed."
incremental_games,fe5o971,t3_enr9en,1578872047.0,"I've played for about an hour and the only real problem I've encountered is the fact that you can't move outposts. It's frustrating because you want to use your outposts efficiently. 

You are punished for building on all your initial asteroids by the prohibitive costs of additional outposts and upgrades. Once you unlock the scanner upgrade your initial outposts can't be refunded or moved making it costly to utilize new/better asteroids."
