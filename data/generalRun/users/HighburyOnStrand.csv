soccer,ff6aqaf,t1_ff5rlxs,1579623072.0,"Serious answer:

It's not a terrible strategy if Arsenal can get an extortionist fee.  Auba is older, on huge wages, has a contract coming up and is highly likely to start losing a step in the next few years.  Ozil's contract has been an albatross and Auba's could be seen as the same if he continues on a loses a step off his pace.  Too many people pay for past performance rather than future.

This season is already a wash and perhaps the most productive thing to do is play youth such as Martinelli and Nketiah.  Taking the lessons of Gnabry, Maylen and Bennacer is that young players need game time to improve.  As shitty as this season has been Martinelli, Guendouzi, Nketiah, Nelson, AMN, Saka and Willock are a really promising young core.

If Auba can be sold at premium prices and there are young defenders who can be bought to go along with the above-refernced players, it is not a bad shout to put them together and play them.

This all assumes a fee high enough to be able to reinvest.

My real opinion is that this transfer does not happen because no team would pay a fee high enough to warrant this type of strategic change."

The answer is they had to get ahead of the story.  It's good tactics for P.R. and lawyers (although typically not in this way).

When I try a case, I always want to be the first person to talk about a topic.  I frame it.  I contour it.  I set perceptions.  Failing to address it--especially if it is a bad fact--only allows the other side to control the narrative, imply that it was hidden and undermine our credibility.

Parnas' lawyer knows this.  He knows that if Barr came after Parnas in a paradigm where Parnas was publicly viewed as a skullduggering henchman, then Parnas' goose would be cooked.  Now, anything Barr does will be viewed as political retribution.  Barr will be perceived as abusing his office to come after Parnas for speaking out.  

Had Parnas chosen to speak out after Barr did something, it would be perceived as a shitbird making up excuses and or lying.  The usual calculus of a lawyer telling his client to shut up is upended by Barr's unethical punitiveness."

First off, the personal loan market is incredibility predatory.  So using that as an example is not apt.  ""Not as bad as"" is not an availing argument.

Secondly, the personal loan industry does not have federal guarantees, non-dischargability and the myriad other systemic advantages that student loan lenders have.  In fact, one could argue that non-dischargability is the primary reason why the crisis exists.  There is a reason why treasury rates are much lower than other loan vessels as well, it's the guarantees.  They are two different markets entirely.  These loans are being written at (often) double prime when they are essentially guaranteed to be repaid.  

Lastly, the personal loan industry provides few--if any--positive externalities to wider society, whereas access to education does."
politics,fekuu5p,t1_fekqrjh,1579208060.0,"This is victim blaming.

The reality is that the government loans are typically not a large problem.  Their interest rates tend to be much lower, forgiveness and forbearance tend to be more available and they are successfully paid off at much higher rates than private loans.  

The real issues are systemic.  The wage deflation is the primary factor.  Real wages have been declining relative to production for nearly three decades.  What does this mean?  It means people are getting paid less relative both to inflation and to the benefit being provided to their employer.  

Employers are also decreasing benefits, passing those costs on to the employees (and often the government in the form of social programs, see e.g. the insurance crisis of the ""intentional 25-hour work week"").

On the opposite end of the spectrum, high-level management wage growth has exploded, as have stock buy back programs and other expenditures which hold almost no benefit to wage workers, even high earning wage workers.  At the same time, wage workers have been subject to immense tax pressure relative to ""unearned"" types of income.

In short, the professional classes are making less money per ""widget"" produced while their highest level supervisors and company owners are being paid more per ""widget"" produced while the tax structure has been simultaneously tilted in favor of the ownership class.  College degrees are losing value because business interests have an incentive to have them lose value.

soccer,ff6aqaf,t1_ff5rlxs,1579623072.0,"Serious answer:

It's not a terrible strategy if Arsenal can get an extortionist fee.  Auba is older, on huge wages, has a contract coming up and is highly likely to start losing a step in the next few years.  Ozil's contract has been an albatross and Auba's could be seen as the same if he continues on a loses a step off his pace.  Too many people pay for past performance rather than future.

This season is already a wash and perhaps the most productive thing to do is play youth such as Martinelli and Nketiah.  Taking the lessons of Gnabry, Maylen and Bennacer is that young players need game time to improve.  As shitty as this season has been Martinelli, Guendouzi, Nketiah, Nelson, AMN, Saka and Willock are a really promising young core.

If Auba can be sold at premium prices and there are young defenders who can be bought to go along with the above-refernced players, it is not a bad shout to put them together and play them.

This all assumes a fee high enough to be able to reinvest.

My real opinion is that this transfer does not happen because no team would pay a fee high enough to warrant this type of strategic change."

The answer is they had to get ahead of the story.  It's good tactics for P.R. and lawyers (although typically not in this way).

When I try a case, I always want to be the first person to talk about a topic.  I frame it.  I contour it.  I set perceptions.  Failing to address it--especially if it is a bad fact--only allows the other side to control the narrative, imply that it was hidden and undermine our credibility.

Parnas' lawyer knows this.  He knows that if Barr came after Parnas in a paradigm where Parnas was publicly viewed as a skullduggering henchman, then Parnas' goose would be cooked.  Now, anything Barr does will be viewed as political retribution.  Barr will be perceived as abusing his office to come after Parnas for speaking out.  

Had Parnas chosen to speak out after Barr did something, it would be perceived as a shitbird making up excuses and or lying.  The usual calculus of a lawyer telling his client to shut up is upended by Barr's unethical punitiveness."

First off, the personal loan market is incredibility predatory.  So using that as an example is not apt.  ""Not as bad as"" is not an availing argument.

Secondly, the personal loan industry does not have federal guarantees, non-dischargability and the myriad other systemic advantages that student loan lenders have.  In fact, one could argue that non-dischargability is the primary reason why the crisis exists.  There is a reason why treasury rates are much lower than other loan vessels as well, it's the guarantees.  They are two different markets entirely.  These loans are being written at (often) double prime when they are essentially guaranteed to be repaid.  

Lastly, the personal loan industry provides few--if any--positive externalities to wider society, whereas access to education does."
politics,fekuu5p,t1_fekqrjh,1579208060.0,"This is victim blaming.

The reality is that the government loans are typically not a large problem.  Their interest rates tend to be much lower, forgiveness and forbearance tend to be more available and they are successfully paid off at much higher rates than private loans.  

The real issues are systemic.  The wage deflation is the primary factor.  Real wages have been declining relative to production for nearly three decades.  What does this mean?  It means people are getting paid less relative both to inflation and to the benefit being provided to their employer.  

Employers are also decreasing benefits, passing those costs on to the employees (and often the government in the form of social programs, see e.g. the insurance crisis of the ""intentional 25-hour work week"").

On the opposite end of the spectrum, high-level management wage growth has exploded, as have stock buy back programs and other expenditures which hold almost no benefit to wage workers, even high earning wage workers.  At the same time, wage workers have been subject to immense tax pressure relative to ""unearned"" types of income.

In short, the professional classes are making less money per ""widget"" produced while their highest level supervisors and company owners are being paid more per ""widget"" produced while the tax structure has been simultaneously tilted in favor of the ownership class.  College degrees are losing value because business interests have an incentive to have them lose value.

politics,fdiejd6,t3_eljscm,1578441110.0,"There was a reasonable timeline in which regime change could have taken place in Iran with the hardliners being pushed out with a slow turn toward more open society.  Iranians were in the streets a matter of weeks ago being violently repressed by the regime.  Now they are marching in the streets and mourning a key regime crony.

That timeline just got delayed 20 years, at best."

The tale of the tape has been the same in every quagmire we've waded into from Vietnam to Afghanistan to Iraq.  Civilians will bear the brunt."

worldnews,fdhyo73,t1_fdhxofj,1578432563.0,"The American sanctions were a reaction to Japanese aggression on the Asian mainland in Korea, China and elsewhere.  The American sanctions effectively limited Japan's options for continuing their wars in Asia.  They did not dramatically impact Japan's ability to function as a peace time society.  

If anything Japan demonstrates the fault in an ultra-nationalist society in this situation, not the relatively isolationist US.  

There's plenty to throw shade on the US for, but this episode is not one of them.  In fact, I'd argue that my country took the wrong lessons from WWI and WWII...temperance and patience were why we were successful in that era...rather than the gung-ho interventionism that seems to have flowed from the aftermath of the world wars"

I'm far from the person who seeks to demonize the Iranians (or the diaspora) but the meaning is pretty clear, even if moderates/revisionists tend to frame it more so as denouncement of American policy choice rather than as directed at the state or the people generally.

It's still denouncement any way you slice it...and it has been going on since long before Trump."
