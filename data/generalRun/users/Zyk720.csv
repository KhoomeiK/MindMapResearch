IAmA,ff4o3hh,t1_ff4hivr,1579568327.0,"Just your friendly, neighborhood gay here to say that nobody in the universe thinks this, we simply accept and bring awareness to ALL sexes and genders. Sex is NOT sexuality. Sex, sexuality, and gender are all separate categories but all are welcome under the LGBTQIA spectrum. Intersex people aren't discussed nearly enough and we are simply here to support them because no one else was."
AskAnthropology,ff44bxt,t1_ff3xa5x,1579555245.0,"You're right that there are plenty of dark skinned people exist in Northern Europe, for a variety of different reasons but primarily because as with most indigenous populations they typically get absorbed into whoever take's overs population. That variance TODAY'S population shows comes from genetic blending, the populations have become almost entirely blended over the last century especially. If you look farther back in time even to the early 1900's the Sámi population wasn't as blended and you can see a much more clear resemblance to our Monogloid ancestors. My great gramps looked more Inuit than he did European. (I'm happy to find you more data if you'd like as I'm Sámi myself, but if even Disney's Frozen can recognize this differentiation in Sámi people back in the day I'd say it's extremely common information at this point.)"
AskAnthropology,ff3l9n1,t3_erf63r,1579543449.0,"Just here to add that there are darker skinned indigenous people in Northern Europe, too, (like the Sámi aka Lapps) so anywhere around the arctic circle you can find darker skinned people."
