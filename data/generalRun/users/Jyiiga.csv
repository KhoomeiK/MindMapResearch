Britain’s tax system is made up of income tax bands at 20%, 40% and 45%, plus national insurance contributions of a further 12%, with low earners benefiting from a tax-free personal allowance at £11,500, which is higher than most other countries.

Higher earners pay income and social security taxes that are on a par with the US, Australia and Spain, but which are much less than those in France, Sweden and Ireland.

VAT, levied at a standard rate of 20%, is towards the lower end of sales tax rates across the EU, though council taxes are relatively high by comparison.

Precise tax comparisons are difficult in the US because of the myriad federal, state and local tax rates, and an equally wide range of deductions and allowances.

We chose New York state for our ­comparison, where the state taxes are relatively high. That might help to explain the surprising discovery that people on low earnings see more of their income disappear in tax than those in the UK, while high earners are taxed relatively lightly.

State and local sales taxes in New York City, at 8.875%, are markedly lower than the 19%-25% VAT rates ­common in the EU. However, property taxes are relatively high in the US, with homeowners in the New York/New ­Jersey/Connecticut area, for example, typically having to pay upwards of $5,000-$7,000 a year."
