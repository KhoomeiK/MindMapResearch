Or is it 30 years out of date and won't fetch the same price as other homes in the area? The national average of home prices is only 1% over inflation so your home probably won't be some big cash out unless you get lucky. 

Obviously there are tons of cases where it works out really well but it's not ""gimme"". Buying a home isn't a guaranteed retirement plan. It's why some folks get upset when folks on the internet just chant ""buying good! Renting bad!"" Because obviously it's much more nuanced than that."

If that's the best example you can come up with then I'm not concerned. Most people are never shot at. Very few people ever get shot at. And many of the people that get shot at get into those situations by reacting with anger and cruelty. You are the one who needs to be educated. You seem to think that life is some kind of battle. With that outlook you are going to be fighting your whole life. That is going to be exhausting. Eventually you'll find that this tough-guy, be mean to everyone, screw them before they screw you attitude isn't helpful. You meet people that take action and solve problems, stand up for themselves and others and protect their families, and they do it while still being kind. You obviously don't know what it means to be kind. I'm not sure, lots of people don't know what it means. They think it means being soft and weak. But being kind in a cruel world is hard.
