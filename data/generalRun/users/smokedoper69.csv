AskTrumpSupporters,fgevjtv,t1_fgeucys,1580711632.0,"What do you bring up as examples of the good that Trump has done? I agreed with the bump stock ban, and his actions on vaping. I’m a smoker but I think it’s very telling that nicotine is one of the few substances that users think should have more regulation. I’m in favor of extremely high taxes on nicotine, I’ve made an unhealthy decision and if that money went to healthcare or social security I’d happily pay the tax. I think that should have been the route but I don’t condemn the ban for being “not good enough”. Besides that he seems to me to be reganomics 1.1 in most of his policies, starve the beast, cut taxes, all this bullshit that has been shown to not work in both theory and practice. But I keep an open mind, what other good has he done?"
AdviceAnimals,fgeuohp,t1_fge7aj3,1580710679.0,"I think so, I intend to go back to them. I think he maybe could have got it running for cheaper but didn’t want me to blame his shop when something else failed soon after. He seemed like a stand up guy and told me I should consider taking the issue to small claims because work had been done incorrectly but I’m just not the kind of person to bother with that hassle, I’d spend more time wise than I could to just work off the cost. And I don’t think the guy I bought I from was a scammer, just incompetent. Plus, buyer beware, I bought an old beater, I knew the risk."

AdviceAnimals,fgbwmat,t1_fgaftp6,1580666760.0,"It’s such a hard business to build trust in too because the consumer doesn’t usually know about the product. I just had some car trouble. I moved to a new city and bought a beater, had a break down and the initial quote was low, but the mechanic seemed like he had something stuck in his craw. He asked if I bought the car recently, I said yes. He said he was concerned because the malfunction was due to an incorrectly installed aftermarket part, and their might be some accidents waiting to happen if someone was wrenching on it at home. I basically told him that I just moved there, I needed my car to run well for at least six months so I can show established income for a loan, and I was willing to spend a little money. I moved here with a group so I told him if I felt happy with the work he would get a few new costumers out of the deal. He seemed happy with that and offered me a free diagnostic but told he most likely would have to replace a few parts. Kept me abreast of everything, gave me part numbers and asked me if I wanted to hunt around for used parts. It still wasn’t a lot of money and I needed the car kinda quick so I said pull the trigger. When I picked it up he gave me all the old parts and explained what was wrong with them/ suggested a YouTube to watch if I wanted to know more about why he replaced the parts. 

Do I know whether or not these  parts needed replacing? Hell no. And I never will. I don’t have the time or knowledge to look into it. But the car runs a lot better and the fuel economy is somewhere between a third better and twice as good as it used to be, so the new parts will pay for themselves over about 10,000 miles. I think he did a good job and I will recommend him to others.

But even given all that, I have a little tickle in the back of my mind saying “you got ripped off. Maybe he just gave the car a tune up and is bullshitting you”, which is totally unfair because he went out of his way to prove he was doing honest work, I just have no way of really checking."

My dad studied behaviorism, works as a teacher and is a strong union organizer. He’s very aware of men’s issues and the difficulties our generation faces, that my dollar doesn’t go as far as his did at my age and that my labor is worth fewer dollars to boot. I’ve been really hustling the last 8 months trying to rebuild my credit and save up for a move. Over that period I stopped complaining to him because anytime I was talking about working 80 to 100 hours a week, taking swing shifts and juggling two schedules, he’s just be like “yeah life is hard sometime, suck it up and it will get better”  or “it’s not temporary for some people so you should be grateful you’re working towards a better life”. 

My friends who are women are way better about it. “That sucks, it is bullshit that things are this way, don’t beat yourself up and take care of yourself when you can.” I think maybe men worry that complaining/acknowledging your struggling is the first step towards total despair.

For me I judge the likelihood of someones corruption by looking at there personal interest and seeing how they align with actions (in areas that aren’t mutually beneficial). Trump has violated the emoluments clause numerous times, and tweeted about decisions that could effect major mergers. He has cut taxes for the rich and benefits for the poor. He consistently insists on his own properties, which he has not divested from, as venues for government functions, enriching himself directly. The second one you could argue is good for the economy, but it would be a hard argument to make. So Trump has enriched the elite class at a cost to the rest of us and driven business to himself through his use of office. There is a laundry list of corruption and lawsuits before he took office as well. I see a lot of Trump supporters defend this by saying “real estate is a dirty business”, to which I always think “than why did you vote for him! Running a nightclub is a sleazy business but I wouldn’t vote the manager of the local titty bar into the mayors office!”
 
You know what else is a dirty business? Politics. And somehow Sanders made it through scandal free. Plenty of powerful people don’t want the man elected and yet no dirt has surfaced. Besides that, ask yourself, in what way to his proposed policies serve to enrich himself or the traditional “donor” class? In what ways has he used his office in the past for personal financial benefit? If his motivation is not enrichment, what might his motives be? Ask yourself a those questions, take the time to look into it, and I think you will see he is not “as corrupt as the rest”"

On the other hand, getting involved with this sort of competition can bring out the worst in you. I got really into a couple of VR games to the point that I had broken the top hundred on the leaderboards. In one game in particular, there was a noticeable “gap” in the leaderboards, it was a time based game that got progressively harder as the time goes on (the “reflex alley” mini game in knockout league), and basically the leaderboards jumped from 25 minutes to a group of ten users who had astronomically high times, from 1 hour to 3 hours. This made me suspicious that they were cheating by using a trainer (a program that helps you cheat not a coach lol), and I started scouting the internet for footage of one of these people ACTUALLY playing for that long. I found one video that was only five minutes of footage right before he failed where he said he had “forgotten” to record the rest, aka the speed runners “a dog ate my homework”. I was about to accuse the dude of cheating in the comments and than I was like.... this isn’t like me at all. If this guy isn’t cheating I’m an asshole, and if he is, is it really worth my time to call him out? I decided to just focus on beating my own highscores, and I enjoy the game a lot more that way."

I personally would like to run a business someday, what sort isn’t important to the conversation, and ideally I would like to provide a service and take good care of my employees. That means I can’t ever make my company publicly traded, as I could be sued by shareholders for not focusing on growth. There is precedent for this, Henry Ford wanted to pay his factory workers a living wage and was sued by his shareholders over it, who argued he had an obligation to the market to pay the lowest fee that would attract workers of an acceptable quality/skill level. The shareholders won the case and it’s now precedent in this country that the board of a given company must maximize profit. If I want to treat my workers right, I can’t have an IPO to raise funds, and most likely a company that is less focused on quality of life and quality of products will occupy the majority of the market space. We live under a system that benefits very few, I would go as far as to argue none. I know a lot of very wealthy people, the only one I know who’s happy is a half retired philanthropist. That doesn’t mean it’s the only system, that it can’t be changed, or that it’s “natural”. Humans go to war, but war is not a humans natural state. Most people would never willingly kill someone, but many people would kill in self defense. War is a trick to make people believe they are fighting in self defense, when they are often serving an interest that doesn’t care about them. I see our economic set up the same way.

Some simple general accessibility options in games could really open them up, I’ve finished the aiming system for the game and am now working on the navigation system, one of my biggest worries is that there are already A LOT of sounds going on, but this post seems to show that people who are blind can process a lot of auditory information. I’m also really glad that zombies is a popular game mode among blind gamers, because that’s the best way I could think of to have consistent audio cue coming from enemies, although another option is to just have the enemies talk a lot.

The main difference was lack of access to medicine and lack of security in the event of ecological disaster. People work more and are generally more unhappy today than they were back than. Your not going to die of gangrene because you stepped on a nail, which is great, but medical advancements would have come without the stock market, same with shipping growth that allows surplus from one region to offset disaster in another. Couple this with modern automation and all of us should be enjoying large amounts of leisure time combined with healthcare and overall societal stability. 

But because this scam, which funnels money (and therefore power) upward existed concurrently with these advancements, they were captured by a small group of people who were not involved in there development. My argument is that the stock market does more harm then good, even if you accept the premise that growth is the best metric. I always see people defend the market like it’s the gospel truth that the economy couldn’t exist without it, that it is responsible for societal advancement, which is demonstrably false. These discussions always go the same way. I am accused of ignorance, I demonstrate my viewpoint is not born of ignorance, and the other party waves a hand and says the time for discussion has passed.

The idea that we need a speculation based high liquidity market in order to have a functioning economy is, as I stated in the first place, a scam which funnels money upwards. 

I am aware that is a radical viewpoint, but it is not one born of ignorance. As I said, I think growth is a terrible thing to build your society around driving.

I also know a good amount about the history of currency. It started as a measure of goodwill, morphed into a measure of resources and labor, and I guess is now energy credits, in a way. In its first form, currency didn’t have to be scarce, plenty of tribes used common items as currency. It didn’t really have any value, if I traded you fifty fish for a canoe and you said “well that doesn’t seem fair” maybe I’d throw in a seashell necklace. The value of this is tacitly determined by similar trades between tribes people, and you could trade it back to me later or to someone else in the tribe. Nobody sat on the beach making seashell necklaces all day even though it would be lucrative, because other tribes people would shun them for not doing any contributing work. As societies grow larger we hit a point where you could just be a necklace maker and at that point in pretty much every culture, currency transitions from random detritus to something harder to come by.

All this to say value as it applies to currency is an apparition, it’s an entirely human affair. Econ is not a science (in spite of several universities trying to reclassify it as one). It does not deal with axioms or universal laws, in fact it’s much closer to philosophy than a science. The health indicators of any given economic model are a philosophical assertion that gets taught in colleges around the country as though it’s a fact. Our current economy is an exercise in applied philosophy which, in both models and in practice, shuffles money upwards. One simple example: during a market correction, a hedge fund is going to be able to maneuver a lot better than joe blow on his e-trade account. Saw this happen to several friends parents during the Recession. Speculative value evaporates, but the larger entities are able to retain more, and are in a more advantageous position when the cycle restarts.

We were doing a year long lease, June to June. Foaf tells me she found a sub letter for my room because I was working over the summer for a family friend in a different city, like 3 months before June to so I’m feeling pretty good. A week before I leave my friend approaches me and is like “it’s really cool that your helping (foaf) out like this.” And I’m like “I mean your the one who has to live with the sub letter” and she gives me a weird look, “yeah... but you’re the one paying”. Me: *blink* “come again?”

Long story short, she had told everyone that I hadn’t been able to find a sub letter so her friend was living in my room for free while I paid for it. She had told *me* the paperwork was already filed and her friend had covered the deposit. None of that was true, and I had a week to come up with about 1500 I didn’t have. This girl regularly begged her folks for money so I guess she thought that was an option for everyone. However I had left my paperwork with her with no deposit, so I wasn’t out any money yet. So I told her this was completely bananas and I’m walking away from the situation. First she shamelessly tried to gas light me and says we agreed on this at some point. I pointed out that we had filled out the paperwork together, so the contract should represent what she said. She says she lost the paperwork. I’m like okay, do you have any evidence we discussed this? She breaks down crying and says I’m being mean, and it creeps up my spine that I do not want any part of this situation, and shouldn’t have agreed to it in the first place. So I tell her good luck, I haven’t signed anything and I don’t need a place to live for 3 more months. I tell my friends I was going to live with sorry but I literally don’t have the money and this bitch had told me three months ago that paperwork was filed, And I’m not signing a lease with a psycho. So sure enough she calls her parents and begs for the money and her friend still lives there rent free but I washed my hands of it. 

What was eye opening about the experience is how many people side with the abuser/victim blame. Out of the people who knew the truth of the situation (she went to great lengths to prove she was telling the truth that I defused over the next year, that’s another story), about half still said “well you should have just paid it, you inconvenienced a lot of people” and I’m like “I should have just paid 3000 dollars? Because someone I know literally attempted to commit fraud?” I also (unsurprisingly) lost the friends I was going to live with, but in retrospect I think one of them was aware of this scam and kept quite about it, and the other has a history of abusive boyfriends so it’s not surprising she was in the “you should have just cleaned up this other persons mess camp”.

Rape is such a terrible crime because the aggressor uses force, fear, or coercion to take away a victims will power. It is the approach of coercion rather than enticement, I believe this to be a moral crime in general, and Rape is simply the expression of this crime in a sexual context. The loss of control is what makes it so traumatic. The classic scene of the bully using the threat of force to make the victim do something humiliating is a form of the same crime. The stealing of will power is a key element to why it should be punished severely IMHO.

If your only evidence is testimony  that’s a different story, but your going to lose your case if that’s your only evidence. Women also have been charged in cases where they later admited the story was false, or in cases where it’s proven they provided false testimony. Let’s say a woman claims a man raped her at party last Saturday night. If she goes to court and with traumatic injuries, had a rape kit done that matches the accused, and someone at the party says they saw them both at the party and the guy had been acting aggressive/creepy towards her, the man may be charged. If she’s missing one of those things, he probably won’t be. If she has only her word and the word of someone saying they saw the guy at the party, she will most likely lose the case. If she does, her testimony is not considered “false”, it is insufficient to provide enough evidence to convict. If the man provides an alibi which is verifiable, for instance his employer has security footage showing he worked all that Saturday night, the woman can be charged with perjury. She might be charged if she can argue her claims were mistaken, not malicious, but there is precedent for cases proven false ending in such charges. The victim in such a case is the man accused, and he can bring a civil suit against his accuser, but saying “I was not convicted, my accuser slandered me.” Is not going to win you the case. The burden of proof switches to you and you have to prove your accuser knowingly spoke falsely about you.

That seems like a good system to me. The alternative of treating insufficient testimony as false testimony means that a woman could be raped, tell authorities, and end up in prison herself. You know, the shit you hear about happening in shitty countries. I’d rather not follow that example. You will find some cases were a man was convicted on testimony alone, but these usually involve defense co-operative police who railroad them into a plea bargain, or a racial/class component was involved, both huge problems in this country that need to be addressed. By and large, a testimony only accusation probably won’t even make it to a court room. But if you see an option I’m not seeing I’m happy to hear it.

Does this mean that there are different experimental results in different world to the double slit experiments run? Maybe if I explain why I’m interested in this idea it will help.

I had an idea for a story about a world that’s on a branch with these statistical aberrations. You mentioned getting 1000 heads up results in a coin flip, as well as the limit of time as it relates to a random events. Since all of our sources of “randomness” are predetermined, if your flipping a coin the amount of force and the trajectory of the coin is determined by the events leading to the moment of the flip. Using a random number generator is just a math equation with a seed that is predetermined in the same fashion. So we can assign a team of thousands of people flipping thousands of coins (or use a computer but you get my drift) and not get the result we’re looking for before the sun explodes. Am I to understand that in the double slit experiment all trajectories of the particle in question are realized in some world, and that would mean in some world every particle has hit the exact same spot? That’s what I would like to write about, a timeline where the experiments don’t match the predictions, and how that would effect society at large.  If that’s not the case with this experiment or any existing experiment, is there an experiment that is feasible but has not been run yet where that would be the case? Sorry if it seems like I’m repeating the same question, this is pretty mind bending stuff so I want to make sure I’m getting the gory details right (not that it would be the first sci-if story to have a premise that is just plain wrong)"

In it, two characters are discussing the many world interpretation and determinism. One character explains it as worlds branching because of things that happen at a subatomic level, things we can’t really effect and that don’t effect us. She says besides this things are predetermined, but it’s not really something worth worrying too much about. She says something like “with the knowledge of determinism, it is also predetermined if we respond to this idea with dread, relief, or indifference”. 

Since I think we are talking about the same thing here, has such or could such an experiment ever be run? By which I mean one which, as you said, has different measured outcomes? And if superposistion means all possible outcomes are true, doesn’t this mean that there are worlds with very strange statistical outcomes?

Let me lay out my understanding step wise so you can (hopefully) point out where I’ve gone sideways. I’m just going to use the experiment linked as an example.
1. An experiment is designed that tells us the electron spin of a given electron. The result is expressed as either up or down. (I think this is the part I’m not getting, I thought outermost electron in a given atom of x element alway has the same spin. This might be where I’m confused)
2. An experiment is run to determine the spin of an electron
3. If the many worlds interpretation of is correct, both states are true in different positions of the universe.
4. This means a scientist in one branch sees the spin up, another sees the spin as down.
5. If the scientist decides to allow this moment to influence their life in some way, they have diverged from the version of themself in the position of the universe in which the electron spin was the opposite.

The person who worked in BILLING told me it was not her job to be familiar with the penal code, and I would have to take it up with the collections agency.

I was in the ER for, full disclosure, a drug overdose (I’m clean six years fuuuuck yeah) and my theory is they just fast tracked those sorts of visits to collections to clear the books."

politics,fdj8m2d,t1_fdj8dwq,1578461583.0,"I mean, I’m incredibly skeptical that Iran shot that plane down right now. If it comes out there were a bunch of American personnel on the plane, yeah I would change my mind. I’m willing to buy “this plane went down in Iran, it was an accident” not willing to buy “this plane went down in Iran with ten CIA agents on it. It was an accident.” I think that’s true of most people."

The title track is about a boy and a girl who would fall in love but never meet because of there isolationism. It’s all really good and I would definitely look up the lyrics if you like there music! Also the name comes from a great movie called “Darkstar”, old sci-fi film that’s basically about long haul trucking in space. Pinback is the name of the communications array in the movie. Sorry for gushing I just love them a lot."

politics,fdj6h5k,t1_fdj66rd,1578459794.0,So Iran took down a 747 full of innocent people... to kill a spy that was leaving the country...and isn’t taking credit for it. You know Jason Bourne is just a movie right? No target would be worth that kind of heat. This is a dumb take.

politics,fdj5sh2,t1_fdj4n9y,1578459238.0,"Wasn’t this a passenger plane? Also, there is another global power active in that region that has a history of shooting down 747’s. Specifically Ukrainian 747’s. I’m not seeing a benefit to Iran in shooting this plane down, especially when it looks like their “retaliation strike” missed on purpose."
politics,fdj5fuy,t1_fdie7qt,1578458957.0,"In my family we often paraphrase the big Lebowski when we see this sort of behavior. “You have nothing to fear Donny, these men are cowards.” While it was unnerving to know that a whole neighborhood was willing to be mute about it, it was kind of a grim satisfaction knowing that all of these pencil pushers who drove lifted trucks were deeply afraid of my father. Nobody ever said boo to us to our faces. And two years after that some guy was chatting with someone’s 14 year old daughter, and her father came to mine for help. They knew he was a real man, that didn’t need a coalition of cowards to run with. 

Also I love that people like that claim the art of war backs up this sort of behavior. The art of war is a liberal text by today’s standards, it is anti interventionist, never recommends a preemptive strike, and has a lot of other fun little hippy things in it. One of favorite lines in the book is something like “ look for the best captain in your ranks. When you are sure you have found him, you are wrong. This man is the best at being known as the best captain. You will never know your best captains name, because he has concerned himself with being the best captain.”"

It follows all of these different branches of a scientist life as he uses a quantum computer to make decisions. In one of the branches his daughter is kidnapped and brutally murdered due to a decision made on the computer, in another he is completely content/ successful, but in both cases he lives with the knowledge that his “what if’s” are real places."

It’s like, a universal thing with y’all, what’s up with that?

politics,fdhyhl6,t1_fdhiaai,1578432471.0,"The war machine is definitely booting up. The AP just rolled out the same front page story across thousands of newspapers today, telling us all Iranians want war with the U.S. My favorite excerpt from this piece was (paraphrasing because I read it this morning) “in the past, when unable to successfully attack economic or military targets, Iranian forces have resorted to using terrorist bombs against civilian targets” they actually used the phrase “terrorist bombs” jfc. the article didn’t mention, even though it was apparent, that so far Iranian leaders have not called for general strikes against the US, but have threatened soldiers “within our reach” as well as personally threatened Donald Trump. We, on the other hand (or more specifically trump) HAVE threatened retaliation against soft civilians targets. We are the terrorist in this engagement, and no mainstream media outlet is going to acknowledge it. The article did acknowledge that Soleimani appeared to be trying to improve relations throughout the Middle East, but used this as a way to avoid pointing out that our accusations are so far baseless, or that the last time the pentagon claimed evidence of a clear and present danger to get us into a war, it was a Bold Faced Lie. Instead they portray it as a he said she said situation. 

I was a kid when the Iraq war ramped and it was disgusting even than when I was only somewhat aware of what was going on. Really looking forward to hearing grown ass men say we should glass the whole region and using disgusting slurs for middle eastern people in normal conversation again. It’s already started, my dad had a neighbor who he’s had a good relationship with the entire time he’s lived here pick a fight over his “resist” sign this morning. A few more weeks and he will be calling it “unpatriotic”, and I’m glad I installed cameras before I moved out because if the last war is indication he may resort to vandalism at some point. 
When the Iraq war started up, we had just moved from a really crappy neighborhood to the burbs. We were the “known liberals” in the neighborhood, and shortly after troops started getting deployed someone used there car to dig up our lawn while we were out of the house. It must have taken awhile, they had run the hose and then driven around in the mud, basically destroying the entire front yard. It must have taken at least an hour, and not a soul in the neighborhood called the cops or would admit they had seen it happening. The neighborhood I moved out of had regular gang violence, but I never felt unsafe in my own home until that moment living in the suburbs."
philosophy,fdhj682,t1_fdguj3b,1578423766.0,"Oh I know, I was talking to someone else about this in a PM. The issue isn’t with many worlds, it’s how it’s presented. World splits occur based on things that happen on a subatomic level, so there are many world but the recent ones are probably very similar to this one. By our current understanding there is no reason to think that there is a world where Hitler passed art school or Lincoln didn’t get shot. It’s often presented as though world splits are predicated on human choices. As far as we know RIGHT NOW, they are not. Scientist have designed experiments that would change this, one of my favorites being “quantum suicide”, in which a scientist leaves the firing pin of a gun to be decided by a particle, thus creating a world where they live and a world where they die. A little grim but a fun way to illustrate a point. 

As far as I know we have yet to find a connection between particle decay and human decision making, but I do know there is a lot of research going on in biology related to this. As far as I know it’s still fruitless but if something new has come out I’d like to know about it, I haven’t looked into this for years tbh."
