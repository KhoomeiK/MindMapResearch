AskReddit,fgl86yk,t1_fgl7kbk,1580885463.0,"They’re not? Look at who sponsors each study. You can look at the sponsors in each article. Almost all of them are sponsored by NIH. And the very first study I linked you was funded by antivaxxers and yet they came to the same conclusion. It’s funny you mention that because the original Wakefield study was done so he could sell his own MMR vaccine that promised to not cause autism. In other words, Pharma was the one who told you that vaccines cause autism. 

They were fine because autism symptoms aren’t apparent until around age 2. Anecdote isn’t the plural of data. 

Besides, Pharma isn’t interested in vaccines. They’re not big money makers. A couple shots once in your life doesn’t keep raking in money consistently, especially with the lowering birth rate. They make a lot more money from heart meds. If anything, Pharma wants us to become obese and be dependent on heart meds. The elderly are the real whales. The fact that big Pharma doesn’t care about vaccines and antibiotics is actually a huge problem for scientists."

I mention assimilation because notice how the European powers never assimilated with the local populace. The Roman and Mongol Empires did, for example. Rome was famous for adapting and coopting the peoples they conquered. Even the Roman religion was adapted to local culture, like the Gallo-Roman culture. You could be any religion you wanted as long as you paid your taxes and didn’t revolt (the Jews revolted). Contrast that with Spain, which had a whole race-based caste system with colonists (peninsulares) at the top and pagan Indians on the bottom. In Rome, even a barbarian had the chance to become a general and a citizen through merit, like Stilicho. That couldn’t happen in British India. Become the head of the Gurkhas? Yes.
