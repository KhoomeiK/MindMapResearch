AskReddit,ffmfav0,t1_fcqt84f,1580053797.0,"Yeah, just do it. Two years ago I got a weird stomach pain, over the course of the next 3 or 4 days I refused to go to the doctor until it was so brutal I could barely take a breath without being in extreme pain. Finally I drove to the ER and it turned out I had acute diverticulitis, it had became pretty serious and eventually my lower intestine ruptured and I spent 5 weeks in the hospital, had four surgeries and had to have a colostomy bag for about 8 months. I was recovering for over a year and if I had just gone to a doctor when I first noticed something was off I could have avoided all of it."

tattoos,fds4ihk,t1_fdruqwc,1578694172.0,"I only have my leg and toes done from just above the knee down is basically covered and a few spots on the upper thigh as well. Everything knee and below sucks so bad, I'm about to move to my left arm and everybody keeps telling me it's way less painful. And I sure do hope they're right. The kneecap is brutal but sides of the knee was something else entirely. I was gonna do the knee ditch too but fuck that."
mildlyinfuriating,fds2n1w,t1_fdrx74p,1578693408.0,The worst part is that now the government mandates you buy insurance. It's taxpayer funded medical care with extra steps. Extra steps that line the pockets of insurance companies and the politicians they buy off. Obamacare was the biggest corporate handout in American history.

Habs,fcph45h,t1_fcp33u3,1577863781.0,I was at tonight's game and honestly I hate to make these kinds of excuses but the ref's were fucking horrible. I had Canes fans turning around to tell me we just got robbed. Horrible fucking calls all night.
