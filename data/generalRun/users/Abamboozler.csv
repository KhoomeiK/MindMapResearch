TheMonkeysPaw,ffy0w1i,t1_ffy04z9,1580336339.0,Okay than the twist is all Pornstars are sex vampires and they dont steal your life but gain life for every +1. And it's all a huge race to see who can live the longest
TheMonkeysPaw,ffxs02v,t3_evih36,1580331269.0,Question: do they also know what video/pictures too or do they just get a +1 above their head like in Mario?
Warhammer40k,ffxoqt0,t1_ffxnqro,1580329427.0,"Later HH books that reference say it was a much bigger battle than the earlier ones. Hell one of the short stories has the Sons of Horus listing that close to 50,000 loyalists survived the battle. And that's more Marines than Fulgrim lists in the entire battle, all 11 legions combined"
Warhammer40k,ffxkm6h,t1_ffxkdhk,1580327050.0,"Ravens flight, the raven guard audio drama gets their version nice. They go to istvaan with 80,000 warriors and 90 days later leave with 3000 

One of the Salamanders ones get theirs cool in that the iron warriors dont bother assaulting them, they just drop nukes on them

Edit: also the first heretic"
Warhammer40k,ffx0rcc,t1_ffwzyf1,1580315277.0,"Eh to be honest I only found it okay, especially the later half with the battles of Istvaan. Like they're just glossed over, especially as later FW and BL increases Legion size by ten-fold. 

The Dropshit Massacre boils down to ""There's blood everywhere. A lot of Space Marines are dying. Thousands of Marines are fighting one another. Over there TEN WHOLE IRON HANDS just got shot by a Predator, and they exploded and now its all gory and bloody. Look now Vulkan and all 50 of his Veterans are charging the Night Lords. Oh, they didn't make it :( "" 

Whereas later books say no, there were dozens of Titans on both sides, hundreds of Knights, millions of Army dudes, Nukes were used, the Death Guard used biological weapons, the Word Bearers summoned daemons, Corax was even there. With scale-creep over the 20 years the HH novels have been going, the early ones seems like...i dunno, the kids book version of events?"
Warhammer40k,ffwz5j5,t3_evosnd,1580314277.0,It's in Fulgrim. And yeah it turns into a murder orgy with the conductor of the orchestra exploding into a Daemonette and the Emperors children so enraged the music has stopped the take up the instruments themselves and become the first noise marines.

Warhammer40k,ffotbeq,t3_euewuc,1580081500.0,I love them for that 4++  great for holding the line or deepstriking in backlines and being a nuisance. Also great for holding up monsters. Those AP-4 Magnus the Red hits dont matter with a 50% of saving
Warhammer40k,ffoaifs,t3_eudlke,1580075725.0,"It depends on their disposition and attitude. Most of the time he'd swear a death oath and go off to be the last. 
Sometimes the Imperium would rebuild them entirely, or scrap their fortress and equipment for a brand new chapter. 
Sometimes if the chapter was close to another they might ""adopt"" him, or even supply specialists like apothecaries and techmarine to help rebuild as the Black Templar supplied essentially a 10th company worth of trainers and specialists to the Celestial Lions when they were reduced to like 30 to help them rebuild. 
Rarely the Marine might kill himself or driven insane by grief go renegade. The iron warriors Honsou encountered a Renegade Scythes of the Emperor who thought he was the last. Alternatively if they were on deployment with the Deathwatch, like Venerable Cryssus of the Lamenters, they might just stay as they have nowhere else to go."

So Magnus was the most actively powerful, while according to some lore Russ was the most passively powerful which manifested in an innate ability to kill other Primarchs"
