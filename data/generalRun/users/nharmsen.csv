personalfinance,fe29mrs,t1_fdx4wdw,1578835936.0,If I could’ve just gotten the order canceled and my money back I wouldn’t need to go through my bank except to get a new card
personalfinance,fe2944i,t1_fdxokin,1578835839.0,"Thanks for the info. And yes I’ve done that. They said once the order is delivered to the store I’ll be able to cancel it and get a refund with no restocking fee.

I’m assuming to them it looks like “I sent the item to the wrong store”."
personalfinance,fe28u8g,t1_fdxx37o,1578835729.0,They won’t even have an order confirmation because the email they used isn’t even active.
personalfinance,fdx1kop,t1_fdx1cfm,1578764355.0,I hardly use my debit cards. Only to get cash.
personalfinance,fdx1dys,t1_fdx0vys,1578764289.0,I always use credit cards. Hardly if ever use debit cards.
personalfinance,fdwwrra,t1_fdwwank,1578763064.0,This is very true. I was debating on taking some vacation time in the area when it gets delivered. But that will be vigilantism.
personalfinance,fdww2f5,t1_fdwthd4,1578762845.0,"Why would you ship it to a store, when you can have it shipped to your house instead? In store you will have to show government ID to receive the item."
personalfinance,fdwvmfc,t1_fdwve87,1578762776.0,"They said since it is after the 45 minute window of original purchase they can not refund until it is delivered. I'm worried there will be a ""restocking"" fee."

I went through a mission and it was the end of the game."
pcmasterrace,fdvrt8t,t1_fdvmlbc,1578750814.0,That's how I felt after finishing Ace Combat 4. That had to be one of the best story lines I've ever played. So sad.
personalfinance,fdato1x,t1_fdas05k,1578250003.0,Yeah they sponsored an arena where they didn’t even have service!
personalfinance,fdai5j1,t1_fdaannf,1578246384.0,But having better service isn't having brand loyalty. I'd change in a heart beat if I received the same exact speeds and service coverage for a cheaper price.
personalfinance,fda8u8m,t1_fda6y4k,1578243126.0,"When I was leaving Vegas and going to MD, Verizon didn't work in one spot. That was going through the Grand Canyon National Park. Plus the internet speed is important. With T-Mobil (in vegas) I was only about to get maybe 5Mbps download speeds. Switched to Verizon and I was getting 50+ in the same exact spot.

But I said in another post, Verizon was $15/month cheaper for 2 lines than T-Mobile (at the time, with a specific discount)."
personalfinance,fda4sbn,t1_fda36d5,1578241665.0,"When I had T-Mobile, going through Kansas, I had 0 service nearly the entire time. Don't get me started when I got to Colorado."
personalfinance,fda4nvr,t1_fda04ol,1578241608.0,"I tried T-mobile, but they didn't offer a discount that Verizon did (at the time). So Verizon was actually $15/month cheaper than T-Mobile. Plus T-Mobile in Vegas was absolutely garbage everywhere I went.

I'm going to pay my phone off soon, and our bill will total about $120/month for 2 lines unlimited."
dogs,fd4wb28,t1_fd4vbfz,1578171634.0,"She will never believe you because you don't back it up. This is you vs her.

She knows that she will get table scraps or cheese. Just don't give her ANY human food period. It will be rough, but after a week she will get into a habit.

I had to feed my dog chicken and rice from my hand when we first got her (transitioning from her poor diet+MASSIVE diarrhea). Then slowly mixed in regular dog food.

Seriously, you need to get her to eat her dog food. No treats or anything else until then.

One thing you could try, is if she eats her dog food give her a TINY piece of cheese as a reward. Slowly phase it out though."
dogs,fd4tzgj,t1_fd4tujl,1578171093.0,"We don't know, the shelter didn't know anything more than that. She gets all the pets. Though she doesn't really like to cuddle."
dogs,fd4tlo0,t1_fd4tc81,1578170968.0,"Yes, eventually they will eat. They will get hungry and decide to eat the food.

I did forget to mention, try different types of food (mine loves the smaller bites, didn't really eat the bigger ones). Try the Science Diet Perfect Weight (the one with a dachshund on it)."
dogs,fd4s7t2,t1_fd4p813,1578170607.0,"So this is going to be an issue for you my friend.

1) Stop giving her scraps, period  
2) Put the food down (1/2 cup or whatever) in the morning, if they don't eat it within 30 minutes put it up and try again later (around lunch time)

To get the dachshund to stop eating stuff outside (they are probably doing this because of a poor diet) put one of those free muzzles on them so they can eat anything but can still open their mouths to pant. At least for their walks.  


I can't stress this enough DO NOT GIVE THEM TABLE SCRAPS. Your dog's digestive system isn't built for dairy products."
dogs,fd4axto,t1_fd4alln,1578165925.0,Long haired standard actually!
dogs,fd434j7,t1_fd406zc,1578163945.0,"It really wasn’t very hard. She was fed only bologna for 5 years of her life. Just switching to dog food would’ve made her lose weight. We were feeding her about 1 cup a day total (2 meals at 1/2 cup) now she’s up to 1.25 cups (1/4 cup at lunch time).

She seems pleased and is still under what she should be eating, so she should still loose weight. But the most important weight is gone."
dogs,fd3v91z,t1_fd3v6b6,1578161925.0,“I swear with my paw on the Bible”!
dogs,fd37klw,t1_fd37f45,1578155480.0,She is pretty awesome. Gets mad when we take her toys away before bed though.

trump,fcwi336,t1_fcwhjtf,1578026201.0,"You’re comparing investment with inauguration.

I had $3k (S&P 500) in after trump was in, I now have $5k and it is still climbing. I think I’m doing well.

If someone were to invest why would they invest in something that wasn’t going to grow?

My question is, if Obama was doing so well, then why wasn’t the highlights of his expansive economic growth?"
trump,fcr1106,t1_fcmh3n1,1577895179.0,It's embarrassing that Bernie makes millions on capitalism and then wants to tell you it's bad.
trump,fcr0u54,t3_ehwe41,1577895097.0,"Yes, a guy who gained millions in the capitalistic economy telling you he will stand up for greed."
trump,fcr0pw8,t3_ehy8cu,1577895052.0,"Climate change is happening. Man-made climate change is another issue. The climate changes because of the orbit of the earth around the sun.  


If I am wrong, then the USA isn't responsible for it and shouldn't make drastic changes until EVERY country is required to. Having a single country go into this is not going to solve anything. Every country will have to. Plus we will have to have emissions less than we did in 1900 to attribute anything."
trump,fcqzvzh,t1_fcqip62,1577894708.0,"Right? stock markets reached record highs under the Trump administration, GDP growth was ""a wave of a wand"" according to Obama and Obama said ""This is how our economy is, we have to get used to it"". But then people want to say Trump is riding his coat-tails."

personalfinance,fcn1ddg,t1_fcl6v51,1577800451.0,"I'm IT by trade, issue I had was that most places want some type of education regardless of experience (blame the electronic HR filtering systems) if you want to get more than an entry level job.

Colleges almost always offer jobs for students as well (I worked at a CC while going to school) but you have to maintain a minimum GPA and a minimum number of classes."
personalfinance,fcn182v,t1_fclpbvo,1577800320.0,"Military is what this was built for. OP should seriously consider coast guard/air force. 4 year commitment and get out. Navy(including Marines)/Army have cut their tuition assistance in half. Air force Still gives $4500/year for TA.

Unfortunately I've stayed in longer than  was planning, but I'll be separating at 13.5 years with a bachelors in Network Security with certificates paid for by the college. All this paid for by TA (with about $1k/year paid for by the Pell Grant).

Plus the health insurance (even though shitty in my experience) will help you get to a manageable level of health."

Got my parent's 96 taurus 140k miles, rebuilt transmission which held up installed for $600 total. Ran it till 350k when i changed the radiator a hose wasn't clamped down. I ended up selling it for $300 and the guy rebuilt the header and ran it for another 200k."
personalfinance,fcn09py,t1_fclkxrv,1577799450.0,"This is a big one. My mother was a gambler/alcoholic. She was one of the best realtors in West Michigan in the late 90's/early 2000's. She gave it all away for alcohol. I had about $400 in my bank account (from saving from birthday's/christmas's) when I turned 18 went to the bank and the account was closed.

Also gave my ex wife a credit card tied to my account for only emergencies when I was deployed. She ended up spending $500 after we fought on the phone. I blocked it and didn't tell her. She got pissed when she was trying to buy a coat or something after another fight when I got back.

Learned my lesson. No more joint accounts except for rent/utilities."
Insurance,fcisqvx,t1_fciso64,1577668922.0,It is whatever the bank used when I got the loan. They sent me the paperwork and that is what it said.

Insurance,fcg2ua5,t1_fcfwfbi,1577635960.0,I was at an 820 credit score. With multiple credit cards that had very little to no balance (probably $20k worth of credit line). I still wasn’t able to get loans or a decent auto insurance rate (lowest was 9.2% then refinanced a few months later at 3%)
Insurance,fcg28oa,t1_fcfwq5t,1577635861.0,"MD, even when I was in Vegas it was higher than other people’s. Regardless of where I’m at or what car, I always pay more.

personalfinance,fcflvpp,t1_fcffxqu,1577631477.0,"So the law is that the bar or company is able to charge you a ""convenience fee"" but the waitress/waiter isn't allowed to add anything to the tip. But there must be a sign on display unobstructed.  


It made me think of when I lived in Vegas. There are signs that say ""no guns allowed"" in some businesses but the law in Vegas states the following:  **Signs** do **not** have the force of **law** on private property. In public buildings, only concealed carry is banned where '**no guns**' **signs** are posted or metal detectors are present at each public entrance (NRS 202.3673).  


Only the owner of the business can ask you to leave, if you don't then the only thing you'll get is a trespassing misdemeanor."
