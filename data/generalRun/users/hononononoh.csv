Take it or leave it. I don't need anybody, and as a matter of fact I'd much rather be alone than have even just one person in my life who plays games with me or uses me. Take me up on this, and I'll be one of the most real, kind, and loyal people you've met.  Break this deal, and I might just never talk to you again.

I care much more whether what I believe has what it takes to carry me and others through this damn painful sentient existence with some modicum of hope that all this pain is for some greater good.

Personally, if a relentless and rigorous pursuit of truth requires me to tentatively conclude that I am a one-time random and pointless accident of an indifferent universe where nothing ultimately matters, then I fail to see the point of valuing truth so highly. If you could prove to me beyond much doubt that what I described in my last sentence was true, then let me off this awful ride, I've had enough.

A lot of the details could be wrong, corrupted over generations and generations of retellings before the Torah was finally redacted into the 5 books we've had since Ezra's time. But the important part is, the story is a piece of cultural memory that various nations of people have seen value in trying to remember and pass on. And because of that, it *is* an accurate reflection of the collective yearnings and perceived spiritual needs of the peoples who have sought to preserve it.

I'm actually working on writing a novel right now, in which a small band of Bronze Age Semites encounter a VonNeumann probe in the desert, sent from a faraway alien civilization to look for and catalog living beings on our planet. The probe communicates with them and reassures them that if they protect it and give it the data it's trying to collect, it'll help them stay safe and prosperous. The desert folk are so blown away by this otherworldly encounter, and filled with such a sense that they are part of some bigger project going on in the world, that they make sure the story of this encounter becomes part of their oral history. It eventually makes it to us as the story of Moses and the burning bush. I'm considering putting a plot twist in the end, where all of this takes place within a simulation, and the user of the computer who designed the simulation has inserted the VonNeumann probe into the world he created to send a message to the inhabitants of his world, to see how they react and see if he can guide the evolution of their society in a certain direction with one seminal intrusion event into their world.

Stories have an intended audience, and an intended emotional effect on their intended audiences. They're also part of a larger cultural context, and as such contain references to other works and pieces of culture that the intended audience would have been familiar with.

DebateReligion,ffayvp4,t3_esfa9c,1579747686.0,"The Gnostic heresy basically boils down what you're saying: the physical world we live in is a mistake. The god who created it is not as almighty as he would like us to think, and is actually a fallible being who answers to an even higher authority unknown to us. The god we know got in way over his head creating this world and then getting lost in it.

This dovetails pretty nicely with the first noble truth of Buddhism: that life is pretty much made of suffering. There's a reason why Shiva the Destroyer is venerated far more widely in the Vedic tradition than Brahma the Creator. It's arguable by death and destruction that we're left with what we have today, and got to where where are now.

In either of these esoteric paths, the key out of this prison is to expect and abide suffering as long as you're alive, and to have compassion for your fellow sentient beings, even the ones who cause you pain, because they're just suffering and struggling to survive the same way you are.

Gnosticism and Buddhism are both arguably non-theistic spiritual paths, because god(s) play a very minor role in your salvation. There may very well be supernatural beings who interface with us and our world, like what our ancestors would have called gods or spirits, but they're probably fallible and impermanent just like us. The prime mover, meanwhile, is unknown and unknowable to us, and doesn't need to be known to us. Instead, each person comes to realize that they've had everything necessary within them to transcend the alienation of sentient existence all along. You and every other sentient beings possesses a spark of what we'd call divine at our core, buried under layers of ego and worry and worldly cares. You have and have always had a direct link with the soure of all being, and you're responsible for, and perfectly capable of, your own salvation."

Hawaiian has p and t in this category also, and of course the infamous 'okina, a glottal stop which is phonemic in Hawaiian.

I'm only an amateur linguist and haven't done a lot of reading about Hawaiian, but I can tell you this much: it has one of the smallest phonemic inventories of any well-documented living human language. A series of sound changes have collapsed a lot of ancestral languages' stop consonants to the 'okina, particularly /k/. *Aliki* (chieftain) in most Oceanic Polynesian languages is *ali'i* in Hawaiian.

Just like Arabic can be described as a language where vowels and the distinction between different vowels plays a noticeably smaller role than English speakers are used to, a similar thing can be said about Hawaiian, except for consonants.

Some evolutionary linguists think that the phonology of Hawaiian with its stripped-down set of consonants is a product of needing to shout between boats, or between a boat and a nearby piece of land. These are situations where the speakers cannot get much closer to each other, but still need to exchange accurate information to cooperate or trade or posture for battle. An extreme example of something like this is the whistled language of the Canary Islands, where only speech cadence, tone of voice, and to some degree the vowel sounds are conveyed."

I really don't like it when the Gospel of John is quoted to support an argument for Jesus as the only way. I'm fairly convinced by Bart Ehrman's argument that unlike most of the other gospels, John was specifically written to push this very agenda.

It seems reasonable to me that there have been many, many people throughout human history who have provided valuable insights about how to transcend the pain of life and our base animal nature, and grow into something greater. And there will be many more yet to come. The core spiritual message, the Perennial Philosophy, has always been there just waiting for us to rediscover, across time and culture.

I think this is usually a case of virtue-signaling being old and established; if a new business were to open with one of these words in its name, it would strike people as lipstick on a pig.

Frankly, I think there are two driving reasons behind the deprecation of *apothecary* in favor of *pharmacy/-ist*. First is an impatience among American English speakers for adorned or pretentious language, and for any hint of intellectual elitism in general. *Pharmacist* is just shorter and closer phonologically to words that average people already know, like *farm*. Second is the huge crackdown on quackery (and the confusing sophistry that sells quackery) by the Flexner Report in 1917. This set a strong precedent in the US, still felt today, for precision of language and standardization of terminology in the field of healthcare.

They're usually a case of an entirely different word intruding. *People* as a singlular noun, and *persons* as a plural of *person* are each still a thing, after all.

If textual analysis bots can identify a short passage in an ancient codex as almost certainly having been inserted by a later copyist rather than the original author, I don't see how some joe schmo making threats or admitting to illegal activity on Reddit or 4chan could possibly be taken seriously saying ""Wasn't me.""

First off, you play kind of fast-and-loose with the term ""objective"". Do you mind defining what you use this word to mean in your post?

I'm not sure that ""God cannot serve as the source of morality"" logically follows from ""we cannot objectively determine what morality is"". Suppose that our world was created by God, and unfolded as it did producing all of its complex forms (including us and our brains) with God having some kind of creative role in the process. This is in line with many mainstream Abrahamic cosmogenies, and can be supported by the Hebrew Bible. Suppose also that the foundation claim of neuroethics — that morality is made of hardwired brain modules common to all humans — someday finds robust scientific support with test data, and henceforth informs and dramatically improves the way we make moral decisions at all levels of society. It seems to me then that that if God is the source of us, and we are the source of morality by the way we're built, then by the chain rule, God is the source of morality by the way God built us. But of course as we're finding, objective morality is a slippery thing to prove.

If God and God's ways are not fully understandable to us, or at least not fully understood by us, then it seems to me that no matter how poorly or well we understand human morality, we're not necessarily any closer to understanding God's involvement in the cultivation of that morality. We're not necessarily any closer to knowing how close following our moral compass gets us to understanding God and aligning with God's plan for us.

I'd like to look up some traditional *Midrash* on the passages from the book of Judges that you're talking about. As with a lot of stories from the Hebrew Bible, there's a lot more than meets the eye. Even if there is some historical truth to this tale of genocide, I'd be willing to bet the original Hebrew text has layers upon layers of hidden allegorical meanings, references to other books, dramatic flourish for entertainment value, covert political agendas, and possibly even an encoded message from the writer to one intended reader. I'd want to be familiar with all of this before I concluded that these passages were a good example for discussing the nature of morality vis-a-vis the nature of God."

For people unlike you and and I who are extroverts, though, frequent social interaction is a need, so being a hermit isn't a good solution. How does one meet this need when I don't like the way interacting with people makes me feel in general? By seeking out venues where it's as scripted as possible, where I can know exactly what I can expect from each other person I meet, and the chance of someone surprising me is low. A place where everyone knows their place and stays in it, and it's fairly easy to tell if somebody doesn't know the script or is taking liberties with it.

The difference will be in how the person prefers to think and engage with the world. One of these three options will just feel right to them, and (hopefully) there will be no one keeping them from making any of these three choices.

I think it's always been this way, because quite a lot of things about human nature and the human condition have remained the same.

People with right wing political and social beliefs live with a constant low-level fear of everyone and everything. Theirs is a world just full of things to be afraid of, lurking behind every corner. Fear is not so much extinguished so much as managed, and trust isn't cultivated so much as it's obviated. Because of this emotional and cognitive mindset, obedience rises to the status of a virtue, because it substitutes for goodwill and compassion as a basis for trusting other people.

These sorts of folks feel most comfortable in a network of unequal, hierarchical power relationships with the people in their world. They are willing to cede a good bit of individuality and privacy in order to have more stable and tight-knit, albeit more painful, human relationships. It's a mindset that takes a deep mistrust of human nature as foundational.

Even in places like the West, where there is ample opportunity and encouragement to choose a different attitude toward other people and society, there will always be some fraction of the population whose neurological wiring and life experiences will together lead them to adopt a right-wing authoritarian stance towards other people and society. Unsurprisingly, there are and have always been institutions — formal and informal, sacred and secular — that serve as social hubs for people who just naturally have a low level of trust and a high level of fear at baseline, and are comfortable with this.

The fable of the blind men and the elephant comes to mind: I think it could very well be that each person and each belief system only holds a few small pieces of the puzzle, and none of us understand God anywhere near completely.

This is because to me, the whole point of spirituality is to make this painful life a little less painful to bear, by holding out hope that there's some sort of greater plan that my life (and all life) is a part of. And service to this goal doesn't really require much more than this. I've sometimes said that ""I live right over the border from unbelief"".

I think the goal of ""swaying the other side"" and ""winning the debate"" is pointless. Instead, I think both sides would do well to try to understand and empathize with why the other does not [dis]believe as they do, and what led them to that. I think most people who do this are going to see that both belief and unbelief are reasonable responses to life, born of the application of normal mental faculties we all possess.

Blessed is he (or she) who realizes there is no winning this debate, as there are no clear answers as to why we're here right now living the lives we are. So it really comes down to what each of us wants out of life, and what each of us considers reliable knowledge.

As a result, I don't participate in this sub to win debates or convert people to my viewpoint. I participate in it as a form of mental and spiritual exercise, challenging myself to clarify my beliefs into coherent language, understand why I believe what I do, understand why others believe what they do, and find common ground. When people ignore this and take an adversarial tone with me regardless, I just want to facepalm and say ""Dude, you don't get it."""

If what you say is true, then the Mandaean religion is indeed moribund. If there are no Mandaean religious communities that would accept your children, then the odds are low that they will grow wanting anything to do with the religion. And a community without children is moribund.

I've heard similar issues are facing India's Parsis and Israel's Samaritans. There is no way into these ethnoreligions without being born into them, and the door locks behind you if you leave. The Karaites *just* relented and started allowing converts, owing to the same issue.

I'm going to say something politically incorrect and culturally insensitive here, but I think the traditional Middle Eastern concept of one ethnicity and one religion coinciding perfectly, and both being immutably set at birth, has no future in a world dominated by Western individualistic values. Hereditary institutions, where the only way in is being born to an existing member, are very much an affront to Western ideals, and are on the way out. I predict any such institutions (religious or secular) will continue to face a lot of tension with the societies in which they operate, until they either open up to membership by choice, or dwindle away. This type of arrangement (one ethnicity = one religion = one language) was the only game in town in our hunter-gatherer days. It made sense to continue this tradition in the earliest agriculture-based societies which were in the Middle East, when knowledge, authority, and inheritance were all top-down, and there was no such thing as a state as we know it now. 

But in today's world of big states and free movement of people and ideas, the notion that a person's identity, let alone their *value as a person*, is at all a function of who their ancestors were, just does not fit. It's dangerous because it creates a sense of unearned privilege among those included, and unearned unworthiness among those excluded. Judging people by things they have no control over is a surefire way to create a very unhappy and conflict-riddled society. In the olden days, that constant conflict was taken as the norm, the only way. The Bible, to me, paints a picture of the Middle East as just as rough and war-torn a place as it is today. But science and technology has since shown us we're capable of better as a species, and there's no going back to the old way.

I speak as a non-Jewish man who married a (believing and fairly ethnic) Jewish woman, and did not convert. We're raising our children Jewish, as that is their birthright as children of a Jewish mother. But the hostility I feel toward me in some religious Jewish circles as pretty palpable. People like my ass are part of the problem, not part of the solution, the story goes. Even though I'm curious and want to be a friendly and supportive ally, I don't post in r/Judaism ever anymore. No matter how respectfully or kindly I try to word my questions, if I'm candid about my background, the response I get usually boils down to ""GTFO"". Jewish people have all told me they love a good intellectual argument, but if the subject is the Jewish faith or the Jewish people, I am not welcome to say anything. Part of the reason I didn't convert is because I have no faith that this situation would change even if I did. Maybe the hair-trigger for any hint of antisemitism in my words would disappear. Maybe. But the devaluing of my input based on it not being backed up by a lifetime of scripture and commentary study almost certainly would not end. Judaism is a mindset cultivated in childhood, and that much is clear from an outsider looking at the way the holy days are celebrated. One does not become a ""real Jew"" (or change one's ethnicity at all, in most cases) after childhood, in my opinion."
DebateReligion,fdlnrj7,t1_fdklz9d,1578528214.0,"> In your statement above - you provided a perfect example of why a materialist (philosophical and methodological) would buy into anything you are claiming.

I haven't made any claims, but sure, go ahead, deem any claims I *do* make preemptively untrustworthy. It's your life to live. And like I said, I don't expect everyone to like me, and that goes for everyone trusting me as well.

> There is no other way of knowing.

It's my perception that you and I disagree far more in how we approach not-knowing, than how we approach knowing. There are many aspects to myself and the world around me that I will never know, and none of us likely will ever know in the course of this life. I take this massive realm of unknowns as an open invitation to let my imagination run wild, dream big, and hope for great things. I don't really care if anyone else shares or appreciates my speculations about what might be hiding in the dark corners between what we know for sure. I've run into a lot of people who find the exercise of speculating and dreaming about the unknown to be a waste of time, or even repulsive. They consider only what is knowable (via the method you described) as even worthy of consideration, let alone discussion. To each his own. I'm not subjecting anyone to my baseless speculations who doesn't want to hear them. As I said, this is all a matter of temperament.

I'm not going to defend religious groups who make demonstrably false claims about reality and demand their followers believe these literally rather than symbolically, because I don't do this and don't support this.

Truth seems to be pretty important to you, and the nature of truth relates closely to what the OP is talking about. Let me state for the record that while truth is important, there are things that I value equally as much as, if not more than, truth. Love, compassion, connectedness, purpose, and being at peace with myself and the world around me are among them.

It seems to me that if you take epistemological naturalism, and the existential nihilism that logically flows from it, to its logical endpoint, it's kind of self-refuting. If nothing ultimately matters and I'm nothing but a one-time pointless accident of an indifferent universe, then it seems to me it is of no consequence in the grand scheme of things whether I endorse it or not. This worldview removes any basis for placing an objective value judgement on its own acceptance *or* rejection. It becomes nothing more than the subjective value placed by another person, who either relates or does not. Again, temperament is the bottom line. So I choose to hold out hope that epistemological (and ontological) naturalism and existential nihilism are not true. You're welcome to join me or not."
