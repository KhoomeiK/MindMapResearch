Do you have a source for this or is it just your personal opinion?"
dogs,ffdx1c1,t1_ffdu399,1579831043.0,"Yeah, I've got a 1 year old purebred Border Collie, with her I just used an adult size crate from the beginning as well. For certain puppies though, it can definitely help to have a smaller crate, at least until they grow out of it. [PAWS' site] (https://www.paws.org/resources/the-benefits-of-crate-training/) classifies a crate as a space that the dog can just stand up and turn around in.

My roommate, though, had to use a cat crate for his Retriever/Collie puppy when she was 8-10 weeks old, and it was perfect for her. Crate was probably only about 18 inches long by about 12 tall, small enough to have on the bed comfortably, but big enough for her to stand up and turn around enough. Any bigger of a crate than that encourages using part of the crate as a bathroom in my experience."

dogs,ffdgrna,t1_ffc410c,1579820532.0,Most puppy crates I've used are pretty small. You want to use a crate they only have room to turn around in. I suppose it's circumstantial.

By the time I got to the coat combo, my girl was already decent on leash. However the [design seems solid](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07XPNQWMP/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_apa_i_SWsjEbBW45WJ8) -- the bulk of the force is applied to the harness, not the coat."

dogs,ff1t933,t3_eqxx8s,1579485668.0,"Man, people really hate dog parks on this sub. The humping wouldn't concern me too much, it's just an act of dominance for the most part. As for copying behaviors, of course this is possible, but it's your responsibility to correct it. 

I think dog parks are a great way to get your dog socialized but negligent owners can definitely cause issues.. however, you're going to have similar risks no matter where you take your dog. They just get to have more fun at a park."

Just make sure you're using a cup to rinse and not running the water as often as possible. I've found its the noise of the water more than the water itself that causes issues."

However my Roomba does mainly run at night while we sleep, it's only occasionally that I run it during the day. Maybe try that? Although I'd be worried that she might hear it in the night and whine to go after it. Tough spot."
