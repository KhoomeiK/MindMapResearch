AmItheAsshole,ff9xlrb,t3_esha7x,1579723708.0,"NTA. Oh my Lord, you are NTA. 
You did what you had to to survive, even if it meant immense pain on your part. I'm so sorry you're living through this, and I hope very much that things take a positive turn soon so that you can both eat/pay rent and live as you are. It goes without saying that your entire family (minus your sister) is TA, what with the gaslighting and the Bible-thumping and whatnot. I look forward to the day when you get to be yourself. Loved and welcomed as you are.  You're still in there, even if you're choosing to put the mask back on for awhile."

AskReddit,ff6zafn,t3_es09d4,1579637964.0,"Any of the Romance languages (French, Italian, Spanish) are going to be easier because they share most of the same alphabet, a lot of grammar structures, and lots of similar words. 
Pick one that emerged from Latin and you're good to go. 
I've also heard German is comparatively easier for us to pick up, because we get a lot of our language from German."

solotravel,fesckpz,t3_eqgwtb,1579363862.0,"I look specifically for female-only rooms. I agree with other posters that I'm also looking for outlets, privacy curtains, storage space in-room (my personal favorite are the under-bed cages). I also appreciate if they've got a cool/cozy lounge space. Close to public transit is a big thing for me, since I try to eschew driving/cabs while traveling. 

That said, I'm a little older (28, so not like ancient, but older than the target demographic), so I may not be representative of your site's audience."

When you use being trans to avoid unwanted attention, you make it normal for people to immediately dismiss trans people. Google the ""trans panic"" defense and see if you still feel alright about using it to avoid dudes.

Look, I get it, tons of unwanted attention is super irritating. But you're (knowingly or unknowingly) making life worse for lots of actual people."
GradSchool,fddb8qv,t3_ekka30,1578303706.0,"This was me in 2012. I went to grad school right after my undergrad. I made it a semester before the cumulative burnout and poverty got to me. It wasn't the right program for me, and I didn't have the support I needed. So I quit, moved home, and started working. Fast forward 7 years, and I have a career I love that led me to a program that's right for me. It's probably a little harder to work and go to school, but I have the benefit of more certainty that this is the right thing for me. 
Whatever you choose, it will all work out. You're smart and ambitious, so there's no wrong choice. Good luck!"
