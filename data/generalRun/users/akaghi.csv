AdvancedRunning,ffivnku,t1_ffhr5fb,1579983808.0,"Also depends on how casual OP wants to stay and natural ability.

450km and a 1:46 is *quite* casual but 1:46 is a respectable time for that. I ran a 1:40.01 half this year, but I also ran almost 2500km this year.

I bet they could bq at some point, but how much work it will take might vary, especially for twice the distance. Even for me, I'd have to cut over 1:00/mi off my time for twice the distance.

So can a filthy casual bq (in that not a pro or collegiate runner)? Yeah. Can you bq on low mileage? That would be harder to judge."

politics,ffillon,t1_ffig585,1579976803.0,He's already settled on crazy Bernie. I honestly thing he actually likes Bernie though. Bernie is a bit of an outsider too (which is ludicrous since he's been in politics for so long).

I also agree with you, but I agree with you as someone who has taken in an inordinate amount of this stuff in. We're not the audience for this. You have to think of average people who simply don't have the time to dedicate to this. If you're in an office job, sure you could listen or watch at your desk (if you're so inclined) but what if you're a lineman working in the field? Doing underwater welding? Or maybe you just don't spend hours a day reading this stuff like we do. You go to work, you come home and eat dinner, maybe watch a few shows, and then go to bed. I wouldn't be surprised if plenty of people simply just don't follow this stuff much. You can argue they're dumb or naive (they're probably not). It's easy to be cynical of all of politics and the theater. 

So when you just catch up here or there and you hear Schiff saying the evidence is overwhelming and the GOP saying then they shouldn't need anything else, at least from a rhetorical argument it makes sense if you don't follow this stuff like crazy."

politics,ffia8bs,t1_ffi9bjs,1579969045.0,"I'm not defending it. Like I said they should get all requested testimony and documents. But it's a very cogent and compelling argument to make for a proceeding that is unlike any other, even an actual trial.

As a piece of the larger strategy argument, it's effective, I'm sure. Democrats have good rebuttals for why they didn't take everything through the courts but that's not the Republicans' problem. It boils down to what the American people find more compelling.

I really wish they'd kept their cases/subpoenas open though as dropping them have Republicans such an easy pot shot at their strategy.

It's all process shit, but it's still important."

politics,ffi783e,t1_ffi2lln,1579966913.0,"I have to say, I think they should allow witnesses, documents, and everything counsel needs to make and defend their cases. I'd even support Biden being called because I honestly don't see it harming him and would just make the defense look ridiculous.

But as a rhetorical argument, the Republican play is actually kind of brilliant and Dems sort of walked into it. I feel like a lot of people are misrepresenting the argument.

The GOP isn't saying there's too much evidence to require more but not enough evidence to convict trump. They're using the Democratic argument against themselves. Schiff has said over and over that the evidence is overwhelming. *Overwhelming*. Well, if it's overwhelming you shouldn't need more. I think if they'd been saying the evidence was *clear* or something similar, Dems could fight back more effectively. But if you were arguing your case was *overwhelming, beyond a shadow of a doubt*, and then in the next breath saying you need thousands of documents and hours of witness testimony, it does seem contradictory. And that's what the GOO is pointing out here. It was a strategy that played into GOP hands, but I think Schiff was hoping public pressure would move a few senators to support subpoenas. And it may yet succeed. Joni Ernst was never going to support the measure anyway."

politics,ffi0whu,t1_ffazfus,1579961710.0,"Trump doesn't attack Bernie or others to help Biden get the nomination though, because there isn't any document dump to release.

It's just the line of attack he will use, *lots of people are saying this was corrupt, even folks in his administration*.

He attacks Warren as Pocahontas because she'd also be formidable. 

He doesn't really talk about Bernie, maybe because he likes him, maybe because he doesn't think a socialist has a chance in hell, but he also probably figures Bernie is an easy opponent to spar with. Bernie basically just says the same thing over and over, and wants to raise taxes by trillions of dollars, had a heart attack, is old, and his ideas are a bit crazy. Most of Trump's work is done for him with Bernie.

Buttgieg and Klobuchar don't appear to have any real shot.

I'd be curious how he'd attack Bloomberg. There's not a lot there Trump can personally attack him on, so he'll probably just make shit up."

politics,ffdumut,t1_ffcjej1,1579829339.0,"To be fair, Nadler said more than ""cover up"" and he basically attacked opposing counsel (verbally) in a way that is exceptional within the Halls of the Senate. Nadler is a bit of a firebrand and the House Judiciary Committee is a very raucous one which sort of necessitates it, but that doesn't fly in the Senate. Cippollone was similarly out of line (though probably less so than Nadler, by virtue of speaking less).

I can't speak to the phones/Fox news stuff as I've been sick with my daughter the last few days so I haven't been able to watch it all. I do know there was reporting of senators dozing off, walking about, and chatting but I think that the rules as written are absurd. These senators have to sit in their seats, basically without moving, until well past midnight with just water, snacks, and milk. It's insane that they don't just allow them coffee, at least.

lockpicking,ffdtcid,t1_ffd2lur,1579828426.0,"I see his short videos more as a *person googling x lock to see if it's any good* sort of thing. So if you buy the bike lock that Phil Gaimon reps (because they sponsor him) and see that it can be cut in less than a second, you might have second thoughts. You might then see they updated it, and that LPL cuts through that one relatively easily too. I give Phil credit though, because he responded to that one too and despite them being a sponsor, he was honest and said, *hey man if he can cut it he can cut it* and then went on to detail how/why he uses that lock and why it makes sense for him, but may not be a great lock if you're locking your bike up out of view while you're at work."

It seems like LPL is for people who want to see locks being opened and BB is for people who want to learn locksport.

I wish lpl did more videos explaining things, like the various kinds of locks, how they work, how picking them works, different pin types, etc. Instead he just torches licks or shoots them with giant bullets."

politics,ff9reul,t1_ff9r09o,1579719451.0,"The main teeth of impeachment is that it's a way to hold someone's feet to the fire, to change their behavior. Johnson, as part of his bargain said he'd stop interfering with reconstruction, as an example.

Trump is kind of a different case because I don't think he gives a shit. To him, if he isn't going to face conviction, then why should he hold back? Just like how he doesn't see political interference as bad if it helps him. In his view, he'd be stupid not to accept and seek it.

So for that case, impeachment is still a stain on a legacy. I think Trump actually cares about this quite deeply. He wants to be remembered as a good president. I think he is hoping/banking on the fact that conservative historians might write about him as a great president and all that jazz, dismissing any negative views as fake or hit jobs. But historians generally agree on whether a president is good or not, so I don't think he has much to look forward to there."
