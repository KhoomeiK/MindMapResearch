Pets,ffdliw3,t3_esusbf,1579823433.0,"What in the world... my cat is also on Royal Canin prescription food. I asked for a written prescription for it from my vet and sent a photo of that to Chewy. Complete BS that they won't let you get it anywhere else. Echoing what other have said - get a copy of the records if they wont write you a script, and take it to a new vet. I've switched vets multiple times (moved around a bit) and none of them have had an issue rewriting the script based off the previous vet's recommendation."

ABCDesis,fekggif,t3_epfqz0,1579199531.0,"I didn't realize my orientation until after I was married. My family is Muslim, I'm not religious (neither is my husband). I guess I would define myself as bi gray-ace. I've talked to some people online about it but not really anyone in my immediate life (well, except husband, he's aware of the bi-ness). Swinging both ways hasn't really effected my marriage though, and being in the gray-ace spectrum kinda helps in the not really feeling interested in experimenting."

Bullet journaling has saved my life! Start of every workday I sit down and write out my tasks for the day in my journal. Then I do ""sprints"" (pomodoro method) of 30 min (5 min break, 25 min of work) and check off items as I go. What has also really really helped me is ""sprinting"" WITH other people. There is an adhd discord and a channel where people can check in with each other on how their work is going, a bot to create the sprinting times, etc. Having other people hold you accountable helps a lot."

dogs,fdhed4i,t3_eldvww,1578420861.0,"I've got a tripaw (lab pit mix)! You can barely tell with the way she tears around the house. Some things to consider to make her life a little easier:  
\- raised food and water bowl, especially if she's a front amp  
\- carpets/rugs/yoga mats for tiled or hardwood areas to help with traction  
\- harness with a handle (so you can lift her/help her out if needed). Also, keep in mind she will likely walk faster than 'normal' to make up for the missing leg. Harness will help stabilize her.  
\- she may tire quicker when on walks/playing  
\- as she gets older, consider talking to your vet about joint supplements"
weddingplanning,fdhc9rt,t3_eldhr5,1578419808.0,"Husband and I signed our papers Dec 2012. I needed health insurance, among other legal needs. We had our wedding April 2013.   
Like others have said - it's fairly common. And in some cultures (mine/my parents') it's completely normal to do it separately, and a newer thing to do it all in one day. We recognize the Dec date casually - maybe we'll use it to go out to dinner or something - but April is our anniversary."
adhdwomen,fdffwf0,t1_fdffcjp,1578360753.0,"Generally you'll need a referral from your doctor or psychiatrist, they should be able to point you in the right direction. Heads up that in many places there is a bit of a wait (I had to make my appointment 2 months out) but it's worth it imo.   


When you say you're seeing therapists do you mean psychologists or psychiatrists? You'll want to see psychiatrist specifically if you are looking to be diagnosed. If you can find one that specializes in ADHD, even better!"

I've been struggling on what I need to do for maintenance, and if it's necessary to keep using pricey products at the shorter length."
ABCDesis,fculyob,t3_eirr8t,1577983886.0,"Fellow brown ADHD-er here. Silver lining of being diagnosed at nearly 30 yo was not feeling the need to defend myself to my parents. Downside was struggling until then so GOOD ON YOU for getting the help you need. Seriously!  


My suggestion: do what /u/ZanshinJ said.  
""Mom, I have an official diagnosis from Dr X. I am aware of the side effects. I am doing well on the meds, thanks for your concern."" Don't feel the need to go into detail, basically you want to just emphasize the point that a DOCTOR has diagnosed you and your medical decisions have been discussed with your DOCTOR and external input won't be discussed. If she keeps on, stop responding! Just end the conversation and walk away every time she starts. You do NOT need to justify your decisions, and arguing just opens that door back up for her. This is pretty much my method of dealing with most meddling from parents at this point ""Thank you for your concern, but I'm fine/I'm aware"" and no response to anything beyond that. They tend to drop the topic.  


When I was diagnosed with anxiety, my psych printed off a packet of papers for me to share with my father explaining GAD because I had told her he would not believe me. When I was diagnosed with ADHD, I shared videos from Dr. Russell Barkley (expert in the field) with my father, which actually REALLY helped him understand (and now he suspects he has ADHD as well - which I have also suspected lol).  


Also LOL at not being focused b/c of stimulants. Only way I AM focused!"

dogs,fcl8qtp,t3_eho07v,1577742252.0,"Yes & no. It has definitely helped me *some*. I have a cuddle pal, I feel content sleeping in with the dog in the bed. I have something to love that loves me back. I'm super on top of feeding them, vet appointments, etc. It has NOT helped me get out of the house. I intended to start jogging with the dog, etc. On super depressed days, it's a struggle to even walk them. I may just play in the yard with them, or let them play out their energy together (I have two, they are best buds). My husband does step in and pick up my slack. **Do NOT get a dog because you think it will help you get out of the house with walking etc.** Get a dog because you want a pet, and have the ability to care for it properly."
AmItheAsshole,fckri5e,t3_ehmukj,1577731621.0,"NAH bordering YTA only because of your attitude about it. The way you've addressed it so far is fine. But do your best to get past it now - it's done, it'll grow back eventually (if she wants to grow it back). What exactly do you expect her to do if you repeatedly tell her you hate it now? Also, she DID check in - she told you she wanted to cut it. 

Focus on the person beyond the hair. She's your wife of 20 years, I would hope you didn't marry her for her hair."
