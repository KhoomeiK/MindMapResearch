BreakingBenjamin,ffhlfzr,t3_etlfah,1579940838.0,"I remember in interviews he didn’t like his old members as much because he felt that he was the only one creating the content of the songs while the others contributed very little and just played their part. But with the current members, he personally doesn’t feel the weight is all on him and that other members contribute to the songs and the singing"

BreakingBenjamin,ffg3dx0,t3_ete28f,1579897591.0,"This album is causing a divide from what I’ve been seeing. Others love it to death but others are super critical of it. For me, it had some good additions like Far Away because that was a true acoustic, new and original song. And I argue that every song should have been new like Far Away. But I did like DWTD with Adam, that was a masterpiece; tourniquet obviously had new vocals and it sounded more raw and intense to me; Never Again was a great version; Dear Agony was also awesome I have no complaints there. The other half, it’s not too memorable. Songs like So Cold has reused vocals which some argue that “Ben can manipulate his voice to sound like his old self” which sounds right but it’s too eerily similar to the old songs. I did like that some of the songs had hindi/Eastern instrumental sounds to them. Very diverse in that aspect. I still bought it regardless and I love that they are still giving us content and showing that BB is still alive and well."

BreakingBenjamin,ffejd1v,t1_ffehpa7,1579850408.0,"Yeah I understand that point; very ironic. Regardless of the mixed reaction, I liked Far Away, it was a new and original and acoustic song that was a great addition to BB’s catalog. And every song should have been new like Far Away but wasn’t. But I liked never again, DWTD was a masterpiece and tourniquet sounded amazing because I could tell they were new vocals. But the rest of the album, so far isn’t that memorable."
