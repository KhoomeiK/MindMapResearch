Seaofthieves,ffc1p1f,t3_est08t,1579789303.0,"Hey Man ! I was the sloop who stole your key, if you want some advices here‘s some.

1. Do not play sword, you just need it for PvE or dash
2. Always 1 person on the ship, if you get aboard you need to defend and protect the *anchor*.
3.bucket is your best friend, even if you are 2 lvl sinking, you can reverse the situation.
4. Be multifunction, you need to do all the things in a second, you have to know what to do.
5. Learn mechanics, if some loots are hidden in places or how many seconds you need to eat.
6. Be a ninja, you need to move alot, most people find the scope hard and you can take time to eat
7. Do not shoot far with the blunderbuss, snipe is the best weapon 
8. Be paranoiac, it help 
9. Do not take a keg on your ship, most of the time it will blow on your own ship
10. Be smart, you are the predator not the prey, each action need to be think and planned."
