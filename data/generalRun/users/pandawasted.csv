Hypothyroidism,fdo02s0,t1_fdnt1ep,1578596345.0,I notice my hair will stop falling out but I do not really see my hair growing back either especially in the eyebrow it stays the same. I can see the baldness I’ve noticed now there’s areas in which it looks like I have very little hair & they weren’t there before I started medication. It could also be that my hair isn’t growing back bc I have not taken the medicine consistently since I get other really bad side effects that make it intolerable at times so I take a break from the meds every here & there
