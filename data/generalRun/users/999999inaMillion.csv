gadgets,ffjg3rl,t1_ffjeurc,1579997520.0,And what stops apple from creating a charge port that fits spec but adding a security chip to require apple chargers.   The end possible positive effect is less then the overall possible negative effects which is huge.
gadgets,ffjdbgv,t3_ets977,1579995875.0,"Apple could put out EU friendly products with that USBc charger.   Then all Apple is going to do is add some special chip so that only Apple chargers will work with Apple phones.   Sometimes government regulations make sense.  Then things like this happen and people that believe Praeger U videos that hate ""far left"" government regulations are proven correct by this stupidity."
gadgets,ffjcji1,t1_ffimfja,1579995423.0,"I am a huge critic of Apple's person ~~moneygrab~~ ecosystem and what I see as doing passive aggressive move to make their products unfixable and requiring applecare.  But requiring a company to fit a standard technology shared by competition?  If I understand the situation correctly, that is something that goes too far and will manage to break a company's vision of a product.  Even with the good intent here."

TooAfraidToAsk,ff50qfc,t3_erc31s,1579577124.0,"Part of it is garbage drama where this is overplayed and most people are respectful of other life choices but don't care about this stuff.  For the longest time there was a big deal made by Republicans (conservatives), associated conservative media and a mainstream media liberal on social policies like this (identity politics?) where there was an endless discussion about the cost of requiring a third bathroom or allowing something using  self-identification as the bathroom to use.  And here in the middle of the country literally nobody really cared about this  as far as I knew.  Keep in mind in the US the press is often driven by the west coast and east coast population centers and the media is  looking for pointless social drama discussion that does not involve talking about changing the economic system."

facepalm,fewkvho,t3_eqqf7g,1579413020.0,There is something called  polygonal rifling in a barrel and I think some civil war rifles  had special projectiles for the polygonal rifling.   This need to be done as a test by someone like Taofledermaus.

JusticeServed,fco21tn,t1_fcnxe3l,1577822645.0,"These things are complicated to the point we need an Adam Ruins Everything episode to break down why to me for an understanding that might change my mind.  However I think that taxing companies that pay western scale labor for a pickup that would offer an alternative to the overpriced alternatives sold in the US when NAFTA allows (allowed?) ""American"" car companies to build trucks in Mexico without a chicken tax at 1/7th or less of American wages without changing the sticker prices to the final product on the lot?  It makes no sense at all to me, and somehow the winner based on all of these freakonomics type of fact sets are usually the corporations."

television,fc7j79s,t3_eghdau,1577509121.0,"I am shocked at this result based on things like Will Smith's Bright, Star Trek Discovery, The Last Jedi, Ghostbusters 2016, and other movies or TV I have probably forgotten.   Because the hardcore science fiction and science fantasy audience is totally in synch with the movie reviewers of this age."
