I think there's a bit of a double standard here. Yes, the Japanese military was reaching its limit, but so was the Russian government as a whole. Russia had been deeply unstable for a long time by that point, and they could not have afforded to divert troops away from maintaining order at home to fight the war.

The reality is that both sides were nearing the limits of their ability to continue fighting, but the Japanese controlled the war objective on the ground. For that reason, both sides needed to reach a negotiated peace, but Japan was able to keep their goal of war."

history,fffct73,t3_et11ly,1579881131.0,"Would be happy to be corrected by someone who is more familiar with the details.

But my understanding was that a big part of this was just the strategic concerns of Japan. Japan's initial plan was to capture the capital region around Nanjing and Shanghai, the historical center of power around Beijing, and China's main shipping port (as well as the Nationalist Party's traditional base of support) in Guangzhou. The belief was that after capturing these three key regions, the Chiense government would collapse and they would be able to rapidly gain control of China under the control of the Wang Jingwei puppet region. 

However, the Nationalists successfully retreated to Chongqing and maintained their military despite the loss of all three regions. Following the failure of this plan, the Japanese strategy became less clear - they seem to have mostly just expanded on the fringes around areas they already controlled, while trying to win major victories that could demoralize the Chinese and lead to that final collapse they had predicted. 

In that context, Shaanxi and Fujian were just never major strategic priorities. The Japanese were far more interested in Changsha, which sat on the path to the new Nationalist capital at Chongqing and which was one of the major bastions of China's defense - it's fall would be a more important strategic victory than regions like Fujian or Shaanxi. Shanxi was an exception in that it was easily captured (as a open plain) and had critical coal resources, so the Japanese made a diversion to capture it."

history,ffbyzbb,t3_esemeo,1579787194.0,"It sounds like an excuse. If you go through examples of American warfare, the tactics and formations the US used really do not seem all that unconventional by European standards. 

While the Americans were more dependent on using light companies and irregulars than most European armies, that practice had actually been copied from British colonial practice (for use in fighting against natives) and Spanish militias often used similar tactics in the Peninsular War. These tactics would have viewed by the British as somewhat unusual, but nothing they had not seen before.

Moreover, if you look through examples of battles, it doesn't seem to be the case that unconventional warfare by the Americans was a major factor. 

Let's use the Battle of New Orleans as an examples. In the Battle of New Orleans, the Americans were defending a fortified position along the Rodriguez Canal. The British plan of battle was to have their soldiers on the west flank to dig a small canal so that they could use boats to capture American artillery, and then use those cannons to help their center to break through the fortified American position.

The British canal collapsed, leaving the soldiers on the west bank dragging their boats by hand through the mud. The commander of the center hoped that even though the attack on the western artillery had failed, it would still provide enough of a distraction for him to attack under cover of fog. Not only was this not enough of a distraction, the fog cleared during their attack and one of the officers forgot to bring the ladders that they needed to cross the canal, leaving the British trapped and exposed to enemy fire directly in front of the American fortified position.

It's also worth pointing out that despite the collapse of the canal, the troops on the west side did eventually manage to assault American lines and capture the guns, albeit by this point the battle was already lost.

Looking at this chain of events, while the Battle of New Orleans was sort of a fiasco, it has little to do with unconventional tactics by the Americans. Far from their usual portrayal as a guerilla type force that used snipers to kill officers, the Americans spent most of the battle behind their fortified position using heavy cannons to fire on the British - a style of fighting which would have been familiar to any of the veterans of the Napoleonic Wars. It honestly sounds more like a story of overall incompetence by Major General Pakenham and his ranking officers - which might explain why the surviving officers (Sir Pakenham was killed) were keen to blame their defeat on ""unconventional American tactics""."

And he warned the United States that if u.s. troops should cross the 38th parallel, we would not sit idly by, we would definitely intervene

That is the version of the 30 September warning by Zhou En Lai recorded by the Chinese foreign affairs ([link](https://www.fmprc.gov.cn/mfa_eng/ziliao_665539/3602_665543/3604_665547/t18022.shtml)). I do need to give a correction - I stated that it was issued to MacArthur before, but it was actually a public statement. The US Foreign Ministry confirms the quote here ([link](https://history.state.gov/historicaldocuments/frus1950v07/d598)), but they don't repeat the text in full - linked quote is an excerpt from an internal wire from the foreign ministry. Taiwanese records (linked [here](http://www3.nccu.edu.tw/~lorenzo/Hao%20Chinas%20Decision.pdf)) state that after making the statement in pubic, Zhou En-lai specifically asked the Indian ambassador to China to make sure that the US got the message. Overall, this warning seems to be pretty well documented in contemporary sources.

I'm not clear on where my original statement contradicts the second one. We are discussing two different events that occured at different times. MacArthur's decision to occupy the border in Oct 7 led to China entering the war on Nov 25 (although the decision to enter was made on Oct 13 and there is evidence China was already mobilizing its troops by Oct 19).

The issue regarding the bombings happened later. MacArthur submitted a request for authorization to use nuclear weapons against China on 9th of December ([link](https://archive.org/details/macarthurswarkor00wein)).

Truman was absolutely right to refuse to allow MacArthur to make those bombings, and any plan which depended on making those bombings (like MacArthur's was) was not a good plan. In fact Ridgway was able to hold off the Chinese using conventional war.

Mao may not have been aware of all of the details, but he likely was not worried about bombings on Chinese soil because the Soviets promised him air cover, and as a result he felt more comfortable massing his troops within his borders, as opposed to spreading them out throughout North Korean territory (where the Soviets had refused to send their planes)."

Declassified records from China show that they had not made a decision on whether to enter the war or not, and in fact were telling the Soviets that they didn't think it made sense for them to enter the war.

Then MacArthur occupied the river and China mobilized its soldiers within a week and pushed him all the way to Seoul. That is a massive strategic error.

AskHistorians,ff77kd3,t1_ff6t23s,1579642678.0,"The existence of cultural/linguistic regions with a sense of shared identity is ancient one, and this is a pretty solid definition for a ""nation"". 

However, the idea that the borders of political states should be drawn according to place ""nations""within the same country is one which became widespread only in the modern era. To go back to the Greek example, even when the Greeks were united against a foreign enemy in Persia there was never a concept that it was the destiny of the Greek nation to be united under a single country. This shift is what we label as the rise of nationalism. 

While there were certainly pseudo-nationalistic movements before the 19th century, especially where national identity feeds into other fissures in society, the idea was never as predominant as it became in the 19th century until today.

As for the cause of the rise of nationalism, this is something which has been debated extensively and which has yet to reach a clear answer. My personal view is that I would point to two trends. 

The first is the rise of universal suffrage. As people increasingly believed that common people deserved a voice in politics, nationalism emerged as a force that could unite the interests of common people and elites. I would argue that it is not a coincidence that many early nationalist movements were also strongly pro-democracy. The liberal ideal of the mid-19th century was often to advocate for democratic nation-states, most clearly shown in the revolutions of 1848. It is only with the emergence of fascism, an political philosophy that it is extremely nationalistic and anti-democratic that the link begins to sever (which was reinforced by the backlash against fascism, producing a brand of European liberalism that was pro-democratic and anti-nationalistic).

The other trend was the rise of imperialism. Both the imperial expansion of Napoleon and of European states outside of Europe galvanized conquered and conquering peoples alike to think about what unites and differentiates them, further feeding the rise of nationalism."

I think this is a bit of an oversimplification of the politics involved. The PM who was in power at the start of the famine, Robert Peel, was a Conservative who repealed the Corn Laws (which put tariffs on imports of food into the UK, including Ireland) in order to make it easier to supply food to Ireland. In fact, the Corn Laws were deeply unpopular with free market capitalists. The Economist, a weekly newspaper which is still a prominant pro-Capitalist voice today, was actually founded to advocate the repeal of the Corn Laws.

It is also not true that his successor, Lord Russell, ran a laissez faire policy while ignoring the struggles of Ireland. While it is true that they initially implemented laissez faire policies, the Whig government realized that they were not working in 1847 and abandoned those policies. 

The deeper issue was that their response, the Irish Poor Laws, sought to rectify the issue by forcing landlords in Ireland to support tenants living on their land (""Irish property must support Irish poverty"", as the slogan went). However, this policy failed because instead of willingly paying for the costs of poor tenants living on their land, Irish landlords responded by evicting their tenants.

The rule was formed in response to a sequence of events where Stepien traded away 5 consecutive future first rounders (despite only owning the team for three years). These all turned into top 10 picks, including a #1 overall that turned into future FMVP James Worthy and a #8 which turned into All-Star Detlef Schrempf. 

During this win-now stretch, in which Stepien sold off the team's future, the Cavs failed to make the playoffs a single time. It's a spectacular failure of management that makes Billy King look like a genius - at least King's Nets managed to make a decent run in the playoffs after mortgaging their future to win now."
history,ff60q5y,t3_erqsd9,1579616143.0,">So while this was happening wasn’t the Russian military immensely stronger than the Japanese imperial military

I think this question is really rooted on a false premise, that Russian had enormous military strength which it was holding in reserve, which doesn't appear to be true.

To start off, the Russian navy was almost completely devastated. The Russian Baltic Fleet (which was the main fleet in Russia) lost 6 of its 8 battleships at the Battle of Tsushima (for comparison, all 5 Japanese battleships survived the battle). The Pacific Fleet had already been destroyed at the start of the war. And under the terms of the Treaty of Paris at the end of the Crimean War, Russia was not permitted to maintain a Black Sea fleet. In fact, Russia was in violation of the treaty, and was maintaining a contingent of warships in the Black Sea, but IIRC this was much smaller than than the Pacific or Black Sea fleets which had already been defeated, and would have stood no chance against the Imperial Japanese Navy.

With the Japanese holding naval supremacy, Russia did not have a real ability to threaten Japan itself or its territories. The only option  left was to face a purely land-based war against the Japanese. Leaving aside the tactical limitations, it is also not obvious that they could win - the Russians were able to mobilize 700,000 troops at the peak of the war, compared to 650,000 for Japan. Coupled with the fact that Japan captured Port Arthur (the site of contention and a well-fortified defensive position) and were able to provide naval support in ways the Russians were not, it is not obvious that Russia would have been able to win a land war - and that's even before considering that many of these troops were needed to keep order at home, as clearly demonstrated by the Revolution of 1905 at the end of the war."

Neither VAT nor UBI is mutually exclusive with any form of income taxation. For UBI, I think it's a good idea in principle. However, negative income taxes achieve the same goal as UBI while being more targeted towards the poor. That said, I also understand that negative income taxes are harder to sell politically - selling UBI to present day voters is hard enough as is."
worldnews,ff4bdva,t1_ff2qd73,1579559662.0,"Obviously it's a lot of money, but I think it's also easy to overstate how much it would be. There's about 2,000 billionaires in the world. Just for the sake of keeping numbers round, let's suppose that the top 7,600 people have 1 billion each. 

If you tax that at 5%, it comes out to be 380 billion dollars, which is around 9% of the US 2018 federal government spending, or about 60% of US defense spending. It's a lot of money, sure, but on the scale of global government spending, it's not a game changing amount.

Moreover, we've seen in practice in countries that have attempted it like Denmark or Austria that wealth taxes are extremely hard to enforce in practice. In order for a wealth tax to work, you need to be able to value wealth accurately. Otherwise, you create a distortive system where people structure their wealth in ways to avoid tax - which often damages investment and economic growth. Conversely, overestimation of the value of wealth forces people to pay taxes on wealth they don't actually have. 

Valuing publicly traded assets already involves billions of dollars worth of labor hours from extremely qualified people - it is one of the primary functions of the finance industry. This problem becomes much, much harder when you need to value intangible assets like art collections which are not traded frequently. For this reason, countries that have imposed wealth taxes have actually struggled to raise significant revenue, and often dropped those taxes for those reasons.

Overall, if our goal is to increase taxation on the rich to fund spending on the poor, income (especially capital gains) taxes are historically more effective than wealth taxes. There's no point in just sitting on a hoard of wealth - wealth must either be spent or invested. A combination of capital gains income taxes and consumption taxes are able to tax both, and are much more practical to implement than wealth taxes."
