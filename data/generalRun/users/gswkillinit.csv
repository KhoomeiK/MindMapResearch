AskReddit,fgkl0zk,t1_fgk1acl,1580868024.0,What if there actually was something to complain about? I accidentally must've did this when I told her how my ex pretty much took my money I lent her for attenting a semester of college (which I learned my lesson with btw)
aww,fgjclco,t3_eyq77y,1580841223.0,Cute but can't help but cringe seeing the baby start grabbing the ice cream.
todayilearned,fgj2j5c,t1_fgj24ao,1580835755.0,Uh idk but how can someone allow a star as big as Daniel Radcliffe show up to work drunk?

AskReddit,fg065r9,t1_ffxmdii,1580401071.0,"This is kind've a shot in the dark here, but I think a drawback to working at home could be that people start to feel depressed/lonely? Regardless of being comfortable in your own home or having a SO/family, you'll be at home A LOT and not around other people. Plus having time to yourself and away from family can be beneficial too."
AskReddit,ffr1skp,t1_ffp7p5t,1580148583.0,"My issue is, I feel terrible even when i'm unproductive for 1 day. Which i'm aware of that it's not bad, but I can't shake the feeling."
AskReddit,ffqqkyu,t1_ffpkw47,1580141339.0,"I think if you talk about it with your wife, it's ok as long as she knows you're working towards getting better. And actively doing so. When girls say they like when their SO, is vulnerable, they mean open but making progress on fixing it. My ex broke up with me cause we fought more but also cause I didn't work towards fixing my issues when I opened up to her."

AskReddit,ffgos6r,t3_etenir,1579911264.0,I like single player games so it depends what i'm craving. I think i'd play Dragon Quest Builders 2.
AskReddit,ffgneak,t3_etf2bi,1579910289.0,"When I was a barista, most customers would just drink 1 cup of coffee a day. Then there's the 2nd group of people who would drink lattes/mochas with like 3 shots. After that, there's those who would drink a double espresso. And lastly, there's a select few who drink double espressos like 3x a day.

I used to drink 1 cup of coffee or latte a day but that was it. Maybe an iced tea at the end of my shift cause that stuff is hella refreshing."
AskReddit,ffeg0cf,t1_ffeffxw,1579846568.0,"I mean when we're walking we hold hands and they would lean on my shoulder and such. But I think that's more a relationship thing. Whenever I was single, i'd never experience girls touching my arm or anything like that. At least that I remember. 

Then again, i'm not one to go to bars or parties much. So maybe I should start lol"
NoFap,ffeamw1,t1_feg5chn,1579841392.0,"Yeah. I hate that I went through that, but at the same time i'm glad I did. It's an eye opener that's for sure. Right now though i'm stuck in a rut and struggling to improve myself. I know what I must do. But it's a daily battle to keep focusing on myself when you go through things like this."

NintendoSwitchDeals,ffcru24,t1_ffc4bn8,1579805957.0,"I feel like even though it's overpriced compared to other controllers out there, it's worth buying it and just biting the cost. The more I use it, the more comfortable, convenient, and worthwhile it feels. It's like...I don't even have to think about my controller. I just pick it up and enjoy whatever i'm playing. No looking for a charger or adjusting my hands to get comfortable. And this goes on for weeks. I do like my PS4 controller (better than PS3 for sure) but man do the batteries really suck. And even though it's comfortable, it's not as much as the Pro controller is."
Rateme,ffaskg1,t1_ffa3ug3,1579743508.0,"Thank you, at least I have that still."
Rateme,ffasj8t,t1_ff8kqvo,1579743485.0,"Thanks, I hope you know I meant the right pic being terrible and not the left lol. Right is my current one."
Rateme,ffasf82,t1_ffah7w1,1579743409.0,Thanks man. Though I should actually clarify that im taking about my hair on the right being terrible. I tried out a new style but didnt communicate to my barber well enough.
NintendoSwitchDeals,ff9u7pd,t1_ff9egls,1579721423.0,"All I can say is to relax, take your time, and all the information can be displayed on the screen. If you hover over a unit, it shows all the stats and their abilities, such as a bowman and their distance needed to attack. 

Most need 2 grid units of distance or can attack adjacent to the enemy (diagonally 1 grid apart), better bowmen can do 3 or more when upgraded, Try to experiment. You can preview what can happen and cancel it if it's not what you want to do.

As for recruiting folks, no it's not necessary and sticking with your original house is fine. Recruiting however can possibly unlock new side missions as some characters can have side stories with each other. Again, not necessary as its optional. 

And for optional quests, no you don't miss things really. You kinda have to choose how you want to spend your time at the monastery as you only have finite amount of time points (the number on top of your screen at the monastary). Its entirely up to you. Mission quests/side stories however, do have expiration dates (you know the screen where you choose to either teach a class, rest, explore monastary). So keep an eye out for those."
NoFap,ff57i8i,t3_ero7dd,1579582486.0,I went 10 days before I relapsed and I ended up coming a lot and it shot out quickly too. I don't recommend it though i'm doing nofap again and for as long as I can.
NintendoSwitch,ff4vjh2,t3_ergux9,1579573461.0,GET THIS GAME. IMO ITS BETTER THAN DK TROPICAL FREEZE!!! MORE OF A CHALLENGE AND BETTER DESIGNED FOR SURE.
NoFap,ff4pvrz,t3_ern4hs,1579569578.0,"You lose progress regardless imo. All about semen retention and not letting your addiction get the best of you. Definitely better than watching porn, but still not excusable."
PS4Deals,ff1r89b,t1_feofht8,1579484410.0,"Yeah. I personally like WD2 more with all it's improvements to gameplay and the city imo being more diverse, but the invasion mode was a bit of a letdown compared to WD1 with letting you control the drone and all."
NoFap,fep3myf,t3_eq92wa,1579311396.0,What benefits have you experienced? I'm hoping it helps with my anxiety.

AskReddit,fehlkvs,t1_fehfsw8,1579119013.0,"As someone who got out of a 2.5 year relationship, remember to always put yourself first. Not saying you don't know, idk if you do but I just want to give advice, because this was how my ex and I broke up. Be happy with yourself first. One way to know is, if you guys broke up one day, could you still be happy without her? Always put her needs after yours (not in a selfish way, but if you're not happy, she won't be happy). Love her, but love yourself man."
NoFap,fefvmsc,t1_fefsfdt,1579066659.0,"Still, people change. Not to be discouraging, but you have to ALWAYS put yourself first. And by that I mean, don't make her the reason for your happiness or sense of living. Ask yourself, are you going to be ok if she doesn't want to be with you one day? You should be happy regardless of her. If so, then good for you. I learned this the hard way after 2.5 yrs with my ex."
NoFap,fefsys8,t3_eow7r5,1579064264.0,"Maybe cause something new is happening? People who are confident, etc still do have anxiety. I think it's just how we respond to it that's the difference. Work with it, not against it."
NoFap,fefsuwh,t3_eowaie,1579064172.0,"My question is, as someone who is on a 10 day run, do these non-superpowers work if you are productive outside of just nofap? Like going to the gym, being more social, going outside comfort zone, letting your brain rewire itself?"
NoFap,fefs25q,t3_eoxj71,1579063517.0,"Only one way to find out. Before nofap, I went to the gym like once a week. Now I go 3x a week at least. And on days off I try to be productive as well. Does nofap give you more energy and focus? Yes, but that's 50%, the other 50% that imo is the real reason things are hard is lack of motivation/discipline. Nofap has changed that too. It has personally made me more motivated/disciplined than ever. A mix between not wanting to break a streak and also feeling good and accomplished so I want to keep going."
NintendoSwitch,fef859v,t1_fedcfae,1579050446.0,I'm just waiting on Fallout 3/New Vegas...they missed the opportunity to release them as an anniversary last year as F3 reached the 10yr mark. I hope they can do it this year.
NoFap,fecrvsp,t3_eog6gf,1578982261.0,Where'd you meet her? How'd you meet her? Give some context lol
NoFap,fecrp3p,t1_fecr9gs,1578982073.0,Go for a walk or hit the gym. Spend time with friends. Do something you like.
NoFap,fecod3i,t1_fecn1sy,1578979037.0,"What does your brain being caught up do? Make you feel more normal? Less anxious or depressed? Trust me when I say that I'm doing everything I can outside of nofap to get better. Sleep 7+ hours a day now, take vitamin D to boost testosterone, hit the gym at least 3 times per week, ask 1 person a question per day, hang with friends more, go out more instead of stay in and be lazy."
NoFap,feclpt1,t1_feag28q,1578977016.0,"I personally think you should stop altogether. Sounds harsh, but even if you were to do it just once a week, that one time will make you want to fap again and again. Its VERY HARD the first couple days, but it gets easier...and along with it you'll see your confidence go up...you have self discipline...you have much more ENERGY (trust me on this one), and also determination/motivation to keep going (cause you ride the momentum of feeling good while not wanting to break the streak). 

That motivation seeps into wanting to use your renewed energy to find other ways to better yourself. I had a gym membership for months and would go like...once a week. But 1 week after nofap, I've gone 3x a week and last week I went 4 days in a row. Sounds exhausting? Well it wasn't for me! Even after work, I actually still had energy and motivation to go! The feeling of improving myself was addicting and I feel really accomplished.

Masturbating feels good, but dude you feel like shit afterwards AND you feel sad/depressed after. It's not worth it! Try to go 7 days at least without PMO."
NoFap,feckoea,t1_fe50b5v,1578976260.0,"Well idk about after. I think it's better to go before. Kinda weird to start the date in silence for 2-3 hours. They should chill, get to know each other, and then go to the movies relaxed and he can even make a move."
NoFap,fec6fe5,t3_eoagxc,1578967423.0,I'm 9 days in now. What benefits did you get so far?
Rateme,febm7gc,t3_enhslf,1578960285.0,I'd give you a 7.5. Cute and you can pull off either smiling or not. Your smile looks genuine which is great. Could you also rate mine and give some advice as well?
tifu,fe8u4to,t3_eo0m9v,1578930904.0,"I did something similar. Was about the same age and my parents dropped me off at my aunts house for the summer when they went on vacation (I didn't want to go). They left me their cellphone to contact them for emergencies as I didn't have my own yet. So over the course of the whole summer, I discovered I could download new phone games without having to go to the store to buy them! I ended up costing my parents $500 on phone games alone. And mind you these games are like $1-5 at the time. So I downloaded A LOT. They got mad, but they understood I didn't know. We all laugh about it nowadays."
Rateme,fdy6cqc,t1_fdw4mrt,1578776534.0,So wait anything 6 or less is below average?
Rateme,fdy5hqw,t3_emvcmw,1578776309.0,"5/10, but with your top right pic being a 6.5/10 because your hair looks stylish in that one. You should smile more too :) not bad looking at all. I'm asian myself but you could be 18-25 for all I know lol. So smile and change your hairstyle up. Could you also rate mine as well?"
Rateme,fdy3ouk,t1_fdwr05o,1578775749.0,Gotta smile with your eyes too bro. You're not bad looking. It just looks like your posing. Try to practice or think of something funny.
Rateme,fdy3dh9,t3_en7zxb,1578775635.0,Smile more and try a short haircut. Right now you're average cause the only thing you need is to stand out and look cleaner with a smile and haircut.
Rateme,fdwy15e,t3_en9le4,1578763376.0,"You're attractive. And I think you look lean enough. Everybody has different opinions though, so the point is don't worry if someone feels differently. 7/10.

GamePhysics,fdnij64,t1_fdn59n6,1578586532.0,I played most of the ones you did too and I really enjoyed Syndicate. I do really like London and English culture/history in general though. The characters in Syndicate are also pretty hilarious and has that witty banter/dry humor you'd expect from the British. Anyways gameplay wise I think its typical AC. I just really enjoy the game for it's setting.
AskReddit,fdlz421,t3_eluyyy,1578535947.0,Around 5.2-5.5? Idk it's been awhile since I measured. Kinda self conscious about it tbh.

AskMen,fdircyo,t1_fdijyfx,1578449323.0,"I'm the same height as you. Can I ask how'd you and your gf meet? I'm just wondering cause I've tried online dating and met a previous ex from there, even though people say it's terrible for shorter guys. Idk if I should do it again or if it's better to go out."
AskMen,fdiq56a,t1_fdiklcq,1578448540.0,Lmao I hope he was trying to make this out as a dumb joke. But even then that's crazy.

aww,fdif58y,t1_fdi5kni,1578441500.0,I haven't played my violin since elementary school and i'm 25 now. So it's been a good 15 years since I held one. I'm surprised I was able to guess it right from just looking at the box. Anyways this is definitely wholesome. I'm sure the parents are glad she wanted something that wasn't a phone.
AskMen,fdhu01a,t1_fdgm611,1578430123.0,"I kinda feel bad for him. I'm only 5'5"" so its discouraging at times, but yeah despite understanding why he did it, he was also delusional thinking he could get away with that. All I want is for a girl to like me for who I am. Honestly being this short is a blessing in some ways, cause it helps me weed out the bad ones. Now I just need to find a girl who doesn't mind a short guy like me haha"
AskMen,fdhtc5t,t1_fdhekid,1578429792.0,Man as a newbie to the gym why they gotta make the gym even more intimidating than it is lol
AskMen,fdhjw7b,t1_fdh1m8i,1578424207.0,So you'd be ok with dating him even if he's shorter? More people need to be like you. The reason it's a problem in the first place is because people make it a problem.
