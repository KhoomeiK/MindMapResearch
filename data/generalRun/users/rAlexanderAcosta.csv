Any changes are made peacefully through the culture and through politics, not violence. Change is more stable and genuine this way. I say that about every politician."

Sure. I can see it from that point of view. Still goes to the credit of Trump for looking to give and expand DACA in exchange for wall funding now. If I recall correctly, the 25 billies only came with a few bills up front and didn't do much to haul future immigration. The latter is the most important part. A porous wall isn't much of a wall. 

I need to have my memory refreshed on that particular deal, though.

AskTrumpSupporters,ffbfwvz,t1_ffbcvxk,1579763523.0,"I apologize for the length, but I’ll answer your questions.

Foreign policy:

I’ll give you a philosophical point and concrete examples.

Philosophical:

“There are no permanent alliances. Only permanent interests.” - Lord Atkins (or Palmdale, I forget).

Our current allies aren’t going anywhere. They’re our friends, at the end of the day, because they have to be. We have all the money and guns and they want to be able to benefit from it.

Our allies talk shit when they’re able to and smile to our faces with their hands sticking out. This has always been true. 

They only liked Obama because of how eagerly he bent over backwards to please them. Granted, he also spied on them (cough cough see: above quote).

How does this play out in concrete fashion?

For years, Iran and Russia have played every president we have going back decades. They only respond to strength. Bus and Obama let Iran get away with a lot because they were afraid of conflict. Like a child that knows that their parents won’t stop them, they pushed the envelope. Trump showed them real consequences. 

For similar reasons, ISIS is toast, Mexico is enforcing their own immigration laws on their southern and northern boarders to the point where illegal immigration is down 70% (Mexican President AMLO and Trump are actually really friendly to each other), North Korea is making efforts to at least talk to us (Communication is key. Conservatives were wrong to bash Obama to open up comms with Castro), Europe is picking up more of their own defense tab, and our new domestic oil operations are making it easier everyday to not depend on our frenemies in the Middle East, making it so we don’t need to be there so much nor do we need to be nice to them because we need their oil.

We’ll see how the tariffs play out. I’m still a Milton Friedman-esque free-market capitalist. If China can drop their tariffs and not steal our IP in exchange for us dropping our tariffs, I’ll call it a win. 

Regarding the Bible thing:. 

Did you watch that speech? He was so full of shit lol.

The candor of the “2 Corinthians” sounded like it was going to be followed with “walk into a bar”. 

He did say the Bible was a great book, but then he said, “You know what’s a great book? Art of the Deal.”

It was so obvious he was there because he needed to be there, not because he honestly wanted to. The tone of that speech was way off."
AskTrumpSupporters,ffbeurj,t1_ffbd6tc,1579762259.0,"Totally. Birthright citizenship shouldn’t be a thing.


If the kid, as an American wants to stay, he can stay if his parents get deported. His parents can choose to take him or leave him. Anchor babies are babies. They don’t get to choose for themselves quiet yet."
AskTrumpSupporters,ffbetjz,t1_ffbeku5,1579762220.0,"He may or may not have been and there is evidence to say that he was, but he did not use Marxist rhetoric to promote his agenda.

He could have been a full blown commie in his heart, but he was using American ideas, not Marxist ideas, to reach equality.

The vehicle that is used to communicate matters just as much as the communication itself."
AskTrumpSupporters,ffbd0pw,t1_ffbbp8x,1579760188.0,"I’m talking about foundational philosophy.

Consider MLK vs early Malcom X.

MLK’s ideas operated with an American framework. He advocated for equality under the law and preached that America was not living up to its own standards. 

Malcom X preached violence and racial separation. 

It’s easy to see why one won and the other did not.

Consider today’s time where egalitarianism is currently being attacked by SJWs and neo-Marxists. They want equity, not equality. 

I’m not saying no one can disagree. I am saying that we need to be on the same page on some basic ideas: free speech, freedom of associated, life, liberty, happiness, etc.

Bernie’s Iowa staff was caught on tape saying that “there are more important things than the rule of law”  and that gulags and the murder fo political revivals is fine.

If you go back and watch the debates, the dude was all over the place even saying that we should government run healthcare, big ol' tariffs, and wasn't necessarily against a tax increase.

Turns out he's something of a center-right guy with some conservative flavoring that I can appreciate. His foreign policy is top notch. I'm still undecided about the tariffs. We'll see how that turns up. I love the judges. I dig that he was able to win without having to do the whole Jesus thing and went hard on the media.

Before Trump, the GOP was always playing defense against the media narrative, always trying to appease the cultural elites. Trump showed the GOP that they don't have to play the media's game and they can define themselves.
