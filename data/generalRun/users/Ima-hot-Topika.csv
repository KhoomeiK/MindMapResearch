keto,fcfumb1,t3_eh6diz,1577633870.0,"Not dangerous. I started keto and a heavy weightlifting regimen in 2018 with great success. One thing I recommend is that people get a body composition analysis done so you know your actual lean body mass and can setup your macros for proper protein intake. Also, RMR so you know your caloric needs. The tip that really helped me is to remember that protein is a goal, carbs a limit and fat a lever. Always hit your protein goal, stay under carbs and eat the fat needed to maintain energy and be satiated. 

Make sure you get enough electrolytes. I take magnesium at night and use plenty of lite salt for sodium and potassium. If I’m doing a longer workout I’ll take a salty bone broth and have in the middle of it to replenish. I also start workouts with a keto coffee with MCT oils."

I’m not sure that the ROI on a traditional bachelors degree is worth it today unless you are going into a field that absolutely requires it. Entry level in many fields can be made through tech schools or an associates degree. Others you can learn through apprenticeships. 

That’s not to say that the satisfaction of earning a degree or the love of learning aren’t great reasons to pursue education. Also, you can learn a great deal through reading, individual study, and open courses nowadays and that can also be immensely valuable."

keto,fcfumb1,t3_eh6diz,1577633870.0,"Not dangerous. I started keto and a heavy weightlifting regimen in 2018 with great success. One thing I recommend is that people get a body composition analysis done so you know your actual lean body mass and can setup your macros for proper protein intake. Also, RMR so you know your caloric needs. The tip that really helped me is to remember that protein is a goal, carbs a limit and fat a lever. Always hit your protein goal, stay under carbs and eat the fat needed to maintain energy and be satiated. 

Make sure you get enough electrolytes. I take magnesium at night and use plenty of lite salt for sodium and potassium. If Iâ€™m doing a longer workout Iâ€™ll take a salty bone broth and have in the middle of it to replenish. I also start workouts with a keto coffee with MCT oils."
