You hate not being your IDEALIZED self. This is largely due to an inflated ego not reflecting the pressures of social norms. You believe you should be something else, but when you look in the mirror, all you see is the real you. the goal should not be to accept yourself, but to begin work towards the self you want to be. To be better every single day, so even in failure you are proud of your attempt and achievements.   


the problem with people isn't acceptance, its to much acceptance and to much ego."

I have worked for two, both pulled the exact same stunt. One in a local small plastic factory.

The end result? I was offered a 4th position working a second production machine at the same time as my original production machine, the fork truck, and the regrind area. I declined and said I would no longer do regrind either due to not getting that raise. They laid me off and shut the factory down a month later. It was revealed on the local news that they were supposed to be creating 200 jobs in exchange for massive local tax cuts and state tax cuts...they had 45 of us working, doing 200 peoples worth of jobs.
