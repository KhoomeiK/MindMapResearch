funny,ffwrjtp,t3_evlrg2,1580309290.0,Sheep actually enjoy shearing.
news,ffwrc9l,t3_evkqyv,1580309141.0,"The real question is, why do we still have tapeworms in 2020? Who uses tape? Shouldn't everything be digital?"
unpopularopinion,fful5kx,t3_ev44cp,1580244267.0,"As a formerly obese person, I am convinced that fat people should work on losing weight for their own health. It's done wonders for me. I lost years of life due to being a fatso. Had sleep apnea, insomnia, couldn't concentrate on simple tasks and was tired all the time. I felt like shit and I looked like shit.

But fat people who are into fat acceptance would rather the rest of the world change to suit them. That's wrong for many reasons, but primarily because it's not in their best interest. It's an unhealthy state of being and it's almost always treatable with a simple diet and exercise regimen.

Just look at David Goggins. He should be an inspiration to overweight people everywhere."
europe,ffukcv3,t3_ev1x24,1580243783.0,Absolutely unacceptable. EU shouldn't have to accept the import of American poison.

television,fftqu6o,t3_eurt7k,1580227382.0,I was surprised at how much different the show was compared to the books since Netflix pretty much said that he was heavily involved IIRC.
pcgaming,fftq2ok,t3_ev4xa2,1580227092.0,It's time to realize what most gamers knew all along - it was never going to work.
sports,ffsul0c,t3_euwixj,1580193065.0,Not even a big basketball fan but it's still surreal that he's gone. A world without Kobe.
worldnews,ffgfdc6,t1_ffg9ogj,1579904987.0,"He absolutely is an idiot. If you go back to some of his earlier interviews from before he got into politics, he was no better. He was younger and maybe more charismatic and able to talk a bit faster. That combined with his wealth and fame made people assume that he knew what he was talking about. But there was never any substance to any of his ramblings even going back 20 years. He's always been a clueless fuckin' moron."
pcgaming,ffgf6hl,t1_ffgcy9u,1579904868.0,Of course.

Why on Earth do I care so much if someone's stuffed bear doesn't have a heart? Two minutes ago I didn't even know about the whole heart thing."
pcgaming,feyxzqx,t1_fewmb7c,1579451830.0,"Here's the thing. I created an Epic account last year. Haven't used it at all and I must have received at least one notification per week for two months straight of someone trying to log into it. They couldn't of course, but the attempts were there. Plenty of them."
pcgaming,feu9k4y,t3_eqivab,1579384473.0,"Steam's biggest advantages are the fact that it's not owned by the Chinese and nobody ever tried to hack into my Steam account. There's simply no way in hell that I can trust Epic with any of my info. Especially my credit card info. If my choices are to buy from Epic or buy a console version, I'll go with the console version."

aww,fehk6p4,t3_ep3shu,1579118213.0,"He missed you more.

I remember reading that dogs are kind of in love with their human. That love is obsessively strong. We adore them back, but I don't think it's the same. I don't think it's as strong as their love for us. That makes me both happy and sad.

I am, however, comforted by the fact that I definitely love my cat more than she loves me."

OldSchoolCool,fcmypn6,t1_fcjz7dq,1577797898.0,"I wouldn't go that far. People need an incentive to innovate and that could backfire. I would, however, put a limit on how long a patent can last, depending on how important it might be for society, and limit how much money can be made from the patent."
OldSchoolCool,fcjkhos,t1_fcjjoha,1577691269.0,We're already living in a hellish version of the world due to the fact that profits take precedent over wellbeing of other humans. Guys like him are the exception to the vast majority of greedy assholes and psychopathic businessmen.
