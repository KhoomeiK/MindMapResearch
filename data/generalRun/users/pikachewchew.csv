Like I know it's not real but that is what pulls me out of it. Kinda like if you watch a play, you know it ain't real but you can become immersed until you notice a theatre light on the ceiling and you're like ' oh yea'."

MovieDetails,feiz1wh,t3_epa8iw,1579151264.0,"Jesus fucking christ this sub is so hit or miss. Sometimes I get insanely intricate and researched  explanations into film lore, other times it is literally people explaining very obvious visual gags from kids movies. I never know what to expect"
videos,feiyi8f,t1_feis8ia,1579150786.0,"This is gonna sound sarcastic, but I'm actually asking. So you had a male friend who slept with girls but then 'went trans' and still sleeps with girls? Does your friend identify as a male still? What does afaik mean?"

MovieDetails,fe27din,t3_enikcb,1578835241.0,I'm new to this sub but does this actually belong here? This is a pretty simple visual gag from a children's film. I'd hardly call it a detail. Do these kind of 'details' pop up as posts often?

todayilearned,fd7zq76,t1_fd4mk89,1578212302.0,"yea you are right. Like I was saying, he is a great guy and is just a product of the era he existed in. I know that excuse is quite often used when boomers try to excuse their racism or something but it's true. He had this idea of men as the workers and females as the mothers reinforced from all sides"

todayilearned,fd2oy2h,t3_ejwxed,1578150287.0,"My FIL is a great guy but would often call me 'mr mom' when he saw me giving our first kid (his first grand kid) a bottle. Despite having three kids he had never changed a diaper either. He would never admit it but I think he feels a little embarassed by his lack of baby knowledge to be honest, he just done what was the norm when he was younger but I think after seeing me with my kids he kinda thought 'oh I could have done that too'"
