AskStatistics,ffmk55r,t1_ffl5mik,1580055831.0,"Thank you so much! Truthfully my statistics is a little rusty so I was more or less trying to hack together a solution, but this is the real deal! 

Let me know if you know of any good online statistics courses that dig deep enough to get to this ^^ level of understanding. I don't entirely grasp the solution and it bothers me lol."
AskStatistics,ffj6osu,t1_ffifi73,1579991757.0,"Thanks for the response. The general idea is I'd like to end up with a specific number or range of what im most likely going to earn off this commission plan in 2020 based off my previous performance. 

My strategy with the spreadsheet was to list out every possible ""final revenue generated"" for the year in increments of $1000 - as well as what $ commission I would earn on that. So everything from selling $1000 worth of products (equates to $100 earned) up to selling $400,000 worth. 

But there's very little chance I'd generate only $1000 of revenue so I wanted to apply some kind of probability weighting based off my past performance (mean = 260k, std Dev = 30k) so that ""final revenue generated"" values close to 260k are weighted highest. 

The ""NormDist"" function in excell returns the probability for each 1k increment based off the bell curve you generate. So it inputs 1k, 2k, 3k, etc and returns the x value on the curve you set via the mean and std dev. Then I summed those to get the area under the new curve. 

*However now I'm considering that won't work due to the fact that Im only summing in increments of 1k instead of a continuous function.*

Doing some research into probability mass functions now. Hopefully it applies to what I'm trying to accomplish. Thanks for the insight!"

Also makes conceptual sense since the chicken came about at a specific time, and eggs have been in existence for far longer."
