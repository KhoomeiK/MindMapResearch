starterpacks,ffhjdp9,t1_ff85u57,1579937930.0,"My little cousins are crazy about Stardew valley and Minecraft. Never played them. I’m just not into video games these days. I had a play station until it exploded and then Xbox. Played the shit out of halo with the scratch card  on the “6 months of Xbox online gold if you register etc”. Never got into games again after that. 

The other friend down the block had Dreamcast, and that is just different shit to discuss."
Futurology,ffgj18o,t1_fffwnu6,1579907359.0,I used to drive up and down the mound corridor for work years back. Mound was nicely timed and moved fluidly for the most part. 4-6 sucked but that’s just kinda how it goes.

nextfuckinglevel,ffat1vh,t1_ff9x6e7,1579743825.0,People are amazed at how bears and etc climb up trees but just watching that had me realizing humans do crazy shit too.

chicago,ff86a5d,t1_ff832zy,1579667181.0,"I can only speak to Bangkok, but people that I know living there also wear them during commutes involving a moped, bus, etc. it’s to cut down on inhaling particulate while driving around the congested traffic areas. Agreed that it can be used as a way of being conscious of your own illness. But people wear them on an almost daily basis for air pollution reasons as well."

HongKong,ff80x5m,t1_ff7hyh5,1579663110.0,"It is a physically painful sensation. Doesn’t matter if you have vision or not. Anywhere it touches near mucus membranes will hurt. Ears, nose, mouth."
starterpacks,ff7ztvv,t1_ff7wif1,1579662321.0,"They should start a reddit for people who were originally on reddit. But then after about 10 years, you’d notice that “senior reddit” has been skewing young, and you probably will think it kind of sucks."
HistoryMemes,ff7wpta,t1_ff7nyco,1579660165.0,"The Secret Service was originally the enforcement arm of the Dept of Treasury. Focusing on counterfeiting, although they did do some intel/counterintel stuff way back. They didn’t become the presidential security detail until McKinley was assassinated. The FBI started around that time and took on more of those former duties. 

Secret police are used for silencing dissidents under authoritarian regimes. Think Gestapo or Stasi. The NSA seems more fit out of many of them."
HistoryMemes,ff7v6b6,t1_ff7tcoo,1579659119.0,Homan Square. Every time I get off the blue line and see the Kimball-Homan bus sign I think about that in the headlines.

MovieDetails,ff4824n,t1_ff3x5y2,1579557570.0,I watched it the other night for the first time in however long and my friend pointed out to me how the dude just wanted to be waited on hand and foot. All the sudden his grandson wins a fancy prize that he spent the tiny amount of money to his name on and BOOM! Up and at em!
worldnews,ff3yphb,t1_ff3tbnl,1579551757.0,"I just had a few weeks of downtime at my job (consulting), and the first week is cool and you get a bunch of admin type work done (clear out mailbox, do expense reports) and after that you slowly go crazy. Sitting there and getting your paycheck sounds fun on paper but I was desperate for something to do after that first week."
PublicFreakout,ff3nxud,t1_ff356v7,1579545102.0,My brother wrestled and I’d go to the meets. 10 year old me saw that happen in person. Needless to say I didn’t think wrestling was cool after that. WWF got real as fuck before my own eyes.
fantasyfootball,ff30elq,t1_fezoah1,1579530301.0,Which team right now would have the protection that Brady is used to playing behind in the pocket? I thought that was the entire point of the Pats scheme- protect Brady.
politics,ff23c17,t1_ff0gsvz,1579492667.0,So why does it look like he can’t dress himself in formal wear? His suits like like he operates a funeral home. End of his tie down to his ankles almost.

reactiongifs,ff1wezd,t1_ff1w0b2,1579487711.0,"It’s an instant noodle brand from Indonesia that has an awesome mie goreng. Some of the flavors are made to be soup noodles, but others like the classic indomie are meant to be drained noodles mixed with several flavor packets that are included in all of them.

Edit: for example, in the classic flavor you get a packet of: Sambal (chili sauce), kecap (dark soy sauce), dry flavoring, and dehydrated fried onion pieces to top it off with. I got into them when i visited Indonesia and H Mart here in Chicago carries them. Amazon can deliver them as well."

ThatsInsane,fezxlf6,t1_fez655t,1579463012.0,"What the gif doesn’t accurately display is how jammed packed full of tourists it is. I went very early in the day on like a Tuesday during low season and it was still crowded as hell. I had way more fun just looking out the window on the train ride down, and stopping off in Samut Sakhon for like an hour, rather than actually being at the train market."
chicago,fevqemm,t1_fevpykv,1579400248.0,Agreed. You can get an ounce of great weed for like $175.
Damnthatsinteresting,fep28in,t1_fep0jrq,1579310501.0,I used to have *Masters of the Universe* on CD back in high school. *Slang Blade* and *Honest Expression* were the best.
