I believe that Disney meddled, and that the end result is not what JJ wanted.  I don't think they deliberately tried to make JJ look bad in the eyes of investors.  That part seems way too ridiculous to be true.  Even if this leak is verified, I would chalk that up to watercooler speculation.

> If even half of this stuff happened, he wouldn't have stood for it. 

According to the post, he *didn't* stand for it, but no amount of kicking and screaming changes the fact that Disney is in charge, not JJ Abrams.

> I have zero doubt that he also had no final answers for his 'mystery boxes' that were created in TFA

Very unlikely.  According to Daisy Ridley herself, ""JJ wrote Episode VII, as well as drafts for VIII & IX"" (I'm guessing rough treatments, it's unlikely he wrote three full scripts).

> TLJ is a fantastic film for bucking the trend and tropes

TLJ is horrible.  Bucking trends is a deliberate decision that filmmakers should make with the intent of payoff.  ""Aha, this isn't what you expected, but look what we have now!""  There is zero payoff in TLJ.  It just *is*.

Look at Frozen for masterful example of subversion.  One of the opening songs is a campy love duet, which is exactly what we expect from an animated Disney film.  In the next scene, Anna is told, ""you can't marry a man you just met.""  This is HUGE: it reframes the entire universe of the film, introduces tension between the sisters that we weren't expecting.  This twist is wrapped up in a big way with its third-act take on ""an act of true love,"" which everyone assumes is a kiss.  We're left with a heartful, non-preachy commentary on the value of non-romantic love, which people by-and-large thought had solid emotional payoff.  Anna's arc in the movie ends up being the audience's arc.

The payoff for Luke's ""new"" character is...it's slightly surprising when he does one final heroic act before dying.  The payoff for Snoke being killed mid-movie is...literally nothing.  The subversion in TLJ either resolves itself by saying ""surprise, but actually not!"" or by simply not mattering at all.

Now that I've typed all this out, I'm not sure why we're even discussing the quality of TLJ.  It has nothing to do with this thread."

You're right to be skeptical - there's some stuff in here that I wouldn't believe, even if the source was publicly confirmed.  Some of it sounds like watercooler speculation more than actual insider knowledge.  Also, OP isn't the leaker, and credible leaker JediPaxis (no 'r' in his username) says he doesn't have any evidence for or against, but that it sounds like an ""STC conspiracy"" to him.

That's the arguments against the leaks.  The argument for it is that OP has been around for a while and appears more trustworthy than a random redditor, but that's obviously not saying much.

television,fcnpmz0,t1_fcmsbws,1577816058.0,"Streaming is still infinitely better than cable.  Yes, it was great when Netflix was the one streaming source for all big AAA movies, but that was never going to last.  Compared to basic cable's packages, where they lump in dozens of channels you will never use, this is still much better value.  All it takes is the restraint to not subscribe to every streaming service every month.  Are you really getting your money's worth for Netflix, Hulu, HBO, Amazon Prime, Disney+, and Apple TV+, or can you live with a self-imposed rule of one or two services per month?

Cable will never have the same value as streaming unless individual streaming services massively gouge their prices.  Cable is beholden to broadcasting schedules, absurd bundles, and speaking from experience, crappy on-demand offerings.

The streaming wars should also help maintain stable pricing (no local monopolies) and drive good original content.

We were spoiled by Netflix's content monopoly and stable pricing, but that should be viewed as a blip.  The cost of entertainment is going back up *if you subscribe to every service at once.*  There are no 12-month contracts and no penalties for saying ""I'm interested in these two Netflix shows, so I'll do that for a month, then hop back to Disney+.""
