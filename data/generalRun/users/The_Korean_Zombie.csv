After I parked, I went to look for it by pushing my seat forward, moving the carpet, checking under the other seat, side of the seat, outside for some reason, EVERYWHERE it could've possibly been in my car. I was looking for at least an hour and I never found it. It just fucking disappeared. It made absolutely no sense. It blew my mind how ridiculous this was.

istp,fdmjvcz,t1_fdmi3ih,1578552592.0,"Agreed. I'm sure BJJ would be amazing if I stuck with it. My instructor was really bummed out when I went to boxing since I'm lanky and showed potential. But I prefer the instant gratification of dodging and hitting things.

For muay thai, unfortunately I had a bad gym when I was younger. The main instructer was never there. We were instructed by some cholo student who showed us combos. We would go running, hit the bags, then go straight to sparring. Everyone just went 80-100%, no emphasis on technique or any advice given. I always sparred guys over 200 pounds when I was 160. Lol looking back that gym was so sketch.

With that being said, I would probably really enjoy it at a decent gym. Imo, the best striking martial art today. I love watching those muay thai sparring videos where the guys are just having fun."
istp,fdmamsd,t3_ej8hau,1578544035.0,"I did BJJ, Muay Thai, and Boxing for about a year each. 

BJJ was way too humbling. Getting my ass handed to me everytime got depressing after a while.. but I respect it.

Excelled in boxing right away after I tried jiu jitsu. Philly shell felt very natural to me. Very fun. Love the competitive drills and instant satisfaction you get every visit. I could hit pretty hard and have a knack for the philly shell."
