relationships,ff5syak,t3_erta3i,1579609057.0,"“Steal her”? She’s not a thing to be stolen. She’s a human being who has made it very clear she wants to just be friends, and has even indicated concern for how you may affect her boyfriend’s emotional health. You met her two weeks ago. She is not going to give up a committed relationship for a guy she JUST met. Maybe you should ask yourself why you find it difficult to be just friends with a woman. Why can’t you respect her enough as a person to be only a friend? Why can’t you see her value as a person when dating isn’t attached to it? Why do you think it’s okay to potentially end one of her relationships? That is not a decision you get to make for her or for anyone. If she wanted to be in a relationship with you, she would be in a relationship with you. She made her intentions clear and there is nothing to read between the lines. You’re trying to find things to read. Frankly, I hope you ignore what I’ve written and make your moves so she can see you for who you are and never talk to you again."
woodworking,ff5rxwk,t3_ertb01,1579607927.0,"This is irresponsible and negligent, especially with a child in your home. Lock your weapon in a cabinet, and make sure your ammo is locked and stored elsewhere in the house. If you scoff and think that’s excessive, then maybe you have no business owning a firearm until you can comprehend and respect the power and danger behind the weapon."

HomeImprovement,fezahff,t1_fexx1jq,1579455352.0,Oh I definitely didn’t buy it! Lol my dad did. Don’t look down on yourself for taking things at your own pace. Adulthood is difficult to navigate and life is not a race.
HomeImprovement,fewdfm4,t3_eqrkpl,1579408750.0,"Yup! I am a college student and I live with my dad. A couple years ago, he bought a 116 year old fixer upper. My dad works a lot, so I spend my summers and weekends learning how to fix things and I’m slowly checking things off. 

I’ve refinished the kitchen cabinets and staircase, installed flooring throughout the house, and rebuilt my dad’s shed. This Spring, I plan on tackling the landscaping. It’s been a lot of fun and I’m really glad I get to do all this stuff."

cats,felxbwd,t1_felwlnh,1579233299.0,"Thank you! All of the cats are super mellow so your comment made me feel a lot more comfortable. It’s only been a week and they’re  eating out of the same food bowl at the same time already. There’s still some hissing from my elderly neutered male cat, but I think it’s more him being a grump towards his new little brother who really wants to play with him. I don’t think there will be any fighting in the future, so I will keep him!"
