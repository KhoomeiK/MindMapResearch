bestoflegaladvice,ffr1ajj,t1_ffqsoex,1580148267.0,"A friend and I once left her baby in her car, though fortunately baby was fine. We were meeting some other friends (including her husband) at a restaurant, and the baby fell asleep in the back seat. We were talking and just kind of forgot we had a baby with us. The really scary/funny thing too is that her husband didn't even notice when we walked in without the baby. We'd sat down and ordered drinks already when she goes, ""Oh my god!"" and sprinted out the door, which made us all realize that we'd forgotten the baby.

Luckily it was a cool night and of course that still all was just 10 minutes, tops. Baby hadn't even woken up. It was kind of amazing how a whole group of people just kind of forgot. They were sleep-deprived new parents, and this get-together was a regular thing we'd been doing for years and I think that was the first time they'd been able to join us again after the birth of their baby, so we just all slipped back into old habits."
dogs,ffpi5ui,t1_ffpgjfq,1580095628.0,"No problem! And that's pretty much what I do with my girl too, haha. We stare at each other for a bit and then I go, ""You know you're a good girl,"" and she gets all wiggly and snuggles into my neck for a minute while I scratch her, then she leans back and stares at me again. I don't even say it in an excited voice, just an even tone, and she goes crazy. I love it, and I love her. It's kind of our special thing, since she adores my fiance but doesn't do it with him.

Since you're on this forum already you may have already seen these recommended, but if you haven't read them yet I highly recommend *The Culture Clash* by Jean Donaldson and *Don't Shoot the Dog* by Karen Pryor. Donaldson's book is a really fast and engaging read; it's kind of geared more towards new puppy owners in some parts but it has a lot of great general information. Pryor's book is a little more intense but still very accessible. Both kind of have a focus on how we interpret dog behavior vs. what is actually motivating the behavior and are rooted in scientific research into behavior.

You and your girl sound like you've got a lovely relationship! :)"
dogs,ffpf9jf,t3_eugqyh,1580093592.0,"One of my dogs does this with me as a sign of affection. She'll stand there for ages just gazing into my eyes, it's kind of hilarious. Her eyes are very soft and her body language is relaxed the whole time; she just likes soulfully gazing into my eyes.

Eye contact can be threatening/aggressive, but in many contexts it's a positive thing. If you have a good relationship with the dog and everyone's eyes are soft, it's probably just an affectionate thing.

Also, dogs don't really vie for dominance with humans like that. Dominance is kind of a complicated topic when it comes to dogs, and it does come up in dog-dog interactions, but if you find yourself asking, ""Is my dog trying to become dominant over me?"" then you can pretty safely guess the answer is no because that's not really how dog-human interactions work."
AmItheAsshole,ffpc4g7,t1_ffp5s9k,1580091350.0,"Yeah, I wear shoes in the house and it always kind of cracks me up when people get so fussed about it because I'm like, I have 3 dogs. They're tracking in more crap than I am.

In fact they're part of the reason I do wear shoes inside, because where I grew up and lived much of my life, we had these delightful plants called [goat heads](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goat%27s_head#/media/File:Acanthospermum_hispidum_seeds.jpg) that are great at getting stuck in dogs' paws and then being pulled out and dropped by said dog on the floor after we come back inside. And those fuckers hurt to step on. Not even just the initial pain, but sometimes if you manage to step hard on a big one, it'll ache for quite awhile after you pull it out.

We also don't have much mud or snow, it's just dust. And most houses I've lived in are hard flooring; carpeting seems to be less popular here than in some other areas of the US. Usually only bedrooms are carpeted, and we typically don't wear shoes into bedrooms anyway.

All that said, though, still NTA to the OP. I gotta admit that ""no shoes"" rules do make me a little uncomfortable (I feel under-dressed without shoes, plus the norm in my area is to wear shoes so if I'm not warned in advance I might be wearing socks with small holes in them or something, which is kind of embarrassing), but I still respect my hosts' rules."

AmItheAsshole,ffp87w1,t1_ffoam6i,1580088661.0,"It happened to this poor girl at a farm I rode at when a beloved lesson horse died suddenly. That one was particularly crazy because it was a super-popular farm and there was a huge group of 10-12 year olds who all took group lessons together and did a lot of social stuff together and everyone except her had their parents explain that he had died, but her parents insisted he just went to another farm. Even at the time (I was one of the 12-year-olds) I felt bad for her and thought it was crazy, but some of the other kids thought it was hilarious and made fun of her mercilessly for it.

And looking back the really crazy thing to me is that they were super-fundamentalist Christians, so they'd even have a really easy way to talk about it! Though I guess I don't know, maybe their denomination didn't believe animals have souls or something. We mostly knew about how crazy fundie they were because she thought Harry Potter was evil but then my sister convinced her it was great and would let her read her Harry Potter books while we were hanging out around the farm, and her mom eventually found out and almost pulled her from the program.

She did eventually stop riding with us and I kind of wonder what happened to her. She was a really sweet kid but her family (or at least her mom) was weird. And she was homeschooled to boot so who even knows what kind of education she was getting."

It's not even necessarily a gender thing, not when you're talking about these kinds of casual games. I'm not trying to deny that, all else being equal, men will be better than women at most sports, but in my experience all else is rarely equal. Like at Christmas, my family was playing 3x3 soccer, men (my brother, my fiance, and my sister's boyfriend) against women (my brother's wife, my sister, me). The thing is, my sister and I were both serious soccer players all throughout high school and college and both of us have played in adult leagues on and off (nothing serious, just for fun), whereas our brother only had a couple of years in youth league and neither of our partners had ever played before. We could have stomped them even though my SIL didn't have any soccer experience either, but we held back, because, you know, it's not fun to have people running circles around you and we wanted everyone to have fun.

Funnily enough, I used to actually go to church events a lot with my Mormon best friend growing up, and I don't associate the term with them.

And I wound up moving into his place and can definitely confirm he wasn't just missing them, since I work from home.

I've lived in some areas where free-roaming dogs like that were common and in my experience they'll usually just join you for relatively short distances and then head home. It's not really like with your own dogs, who will generally stick with you for as far as you want to go because they're bonded to you.

AmItheAsshole,ffmsit7,t1_ffkwf4l,1580058440.0,"Eh, there's responding and there's *responding*. You can definitely get most dogs to respond to anything in a low-stakes situation where getting attention from you is the most exciting thing going on, but if you need a serious recall, it is important to have one specific cue for that. I work with my dogs off-leash outdoors a lot and I'm extremely careful about names because of that. Well, that and a few other cues where I need them to listen to me. I want their names to be a distinct cue that makes them instantly take notice and be prepared to act on the cue I say next even if they're distracted by something really exciting (wildlife, etc.), basically.

I wouldn't be okay with having a shared dog name because of that, as it does cause confusion and can train the dog not to listen to their name, since sometimes when they respond you'll actually be calling the other dog. Though I still think OP is NTA, because she's the one whose dog actually responds to the name. And of course for people who just want a reasonably well-behaved pet rather than being a weird dog person like me, it probably doesn't matter that much."
AmItheAsshole,ffmpp1g,t1_ffmbvti,1580057638.0,"I'll just add on to what u/CatsandSucculents said with a bit of explanation about the laws involved, assuming you're in the US.

In the US, the disability isn't what determines whether a dog is an ESA or a service dog. Anyone with a disability can qualify for either.

The issue is that you're dealing with three different laws: The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), the Fair Housing Act (FHA), and the Air Carrier Access Act (ACAA). The ADA covers public access (so going into restaurants, stores, etc.) and employment, and the other two have fairly self-explanatory names.

The difference comes in the way the three different laws define what counts as a service/assistance animal. So the ADA requires the animal to be a dog (with a separate clause allowing mini horses, but they have less protections) that is trained to perform at least one task to mitigate the handler's disability.

The FHA uses the term assistance animal, and defines it much more broadly. It doesn't have a species restriction (though landlords are only required to make reasonable accommodations, so no emotional support rhinos or whatever), and it covers both task-trained animals like the ADA *and* animals who mitigate their owners' disabilities by providing emotional support. The ACAA I believe uses the term service animals, but it uses a similar definition to the FHA that includes animals that provide emotional support, so that's why ESAs are allowed on airplanes.

So basically, if someone has PTSD or autism and their dog is trained to perform specific soothing behaviors, that is a trained task and it qualifies as a service dog under the ADA definition, so it's allowed in public. If someone has PTSD or autism and simply finds comfort in the animal's presence, that isn't a trained task so it is an ESA and not allowed in public (except on planes).

I hope that makes sense. The tl;dr is that it's all about the dog's training or lack thereof, not the person's disability (as long as they have one)."
AmItheAsshole,ffjv3nz,t1_ffj8s4y,1580007779.0,"It's fucked up, but I'm guessing these are high school/early college kids, and kids that age rarely handle this kind of stuff well. OP is definitely NTA and her behavior is definitely inappropriate, but OP also mentions she has gone through ""problems"" herself so I could see this as just a very misguided attempt to connect with someone she sees as being able to relate to her.

My situation was different, but I made a few bad missteps that I cringe looking back on due to similar reasons. I hadn't suffered a loss like the OP, but one of my siblings has a severe mental illness with a rare childhood onset. I experienced a lot of physical and psychological abuse from him during my teen years, and whenever I met someone who seemed to have similar experiences, I would kind of glom onto them in an inappropriate way. I'm not excusing that at all, in fact it's rather horrifying to me to think about, but I did it.

My parents were really aware of and proactive about the whole situation and I was in therapy and had a great support system so it was probably more under control for me than for most teenagers in similarly difficult situations, but I was still pretty creepy at times.

So yeah, my vote is still definitely NTA, but assuming these people are as young as they sound, I can't judge her too harshly if my assumptions are correct. If they both happen to be older nontraditional university students or something then I'd be a lot harsher on her. But man, people do enough cringey shit just with normal young adult dating.

But the funny thing is that I'm comfortable with a lot of things that many people calling the girlfriend controlling would probably freak out about. I'm fine with my fiance spending time and even traveling alone with female friends, I'm fine with casual nudity among mixed-sex friends groups, I'm fine with him kissing other women in rehearsal/on stage, one of his good friends is an ex-FWB and I love her and have no problem with them spending time together... You get the idea.

For me it's purely a moral/ethical thing, and it kind of sounds like it might be for the OP's girlfriend as well. I mean, it's not even like Hooters uniforms are *that* revealing.

ninja edit: Though at least in some areas of the country, 24-hour ranges aren't that unusual. I used to live near one and started sleeping through the shooting very quickly.

bestoflegaladvice,ffifa29,t1_ffhmw9c,1579972479.0,"Local laws have an impact on shelter policy, too. For example, I worked at a shelter that spayed/neutered all pets because we had to by law. The city required all owners of intact animals to maintain a special license for each one, and one of the conditions of the license is that if your animal wound up in the shelter, your license for that animal was automatically revoked and you couldn't legally keep it intact anymore. The shelter was required to neuter it before releasing it back to you.

Granted, that city did have some of the strictest laws about stuff like that that I've ever seen due to an extremely massive issue with both dangerous free-roaming dogs and pet overpopulation in general, but it isn't the only place in the country with laws like that."

AmItheAsshole,ffgsy1z,t1_ffffwro,1579914253.0,"I don't know if this is the case in the OP's city, but in some places this kind of bullshit is actually part of what drives up housing costs to those unaffordable levels. It can happen a variety of ways; for example, in a small city near me, there's an artificial housing shortage caused almost entirely by the vacation rental market (like AirBNB), as it's a very popular vacation destination. So you have both investors buying up properties to use them as vacation rentals, and you have long-time landlords not renewing leases of long-term tenants so that they can use the property as a vacation rental, because they make way more money that way.

So rent has skyrocketed, if you can even find an open place to rent, and most rentals are in shitty neighborhoods. Which then tends to drive out most of the low-wage workers who can possibly afford to move, because there's another city just about an hour away that actually has affordable housing and plenty of jobs. Wages in Expensive City have of course increased a bit to try to attract workers, but not enough, plus you'd still probably have to live in a shitty area because that's what's available. No one wants to live in a run-down apartment building where you gotta watch out for syringes and shit on the ground.

And I guess you could argue that that's just capitalism and it'll eventually even out or fail, but it's harming the entire community. I've worked on some public hearings related to possibly regulating the vacation rental market and it's really heartbreaking to hear people who were forced out talk about it. Plus if it fails, we'll be stuck with this blighted area where we once had a thriving historic city.

And this city I'm talking about isn't unique; artificial housing shortages due to a large number of empty housing units are actually a big problem in a lot of areas. So yeah, I gotta go with YTA. OP has the right to do whatever they want with their property, but I can't really side with anyone who keeps a place empty like that in an area that obviously has a high demand. The fact that it's their disabled niece who wants to rent it makes it even worse. Use that 1.2k to get a freaking hotel for your one weekend a month in the city, goddamn."
bestoflegaladvice,ffgfhms,t1_ffee9w9,1579905064.0,"I think this story is fishy too, but the part about already posting the dog and having an adopter lined up is 100% believable to me. I have volunteered at several shelters that operate like that. We posted every dog that comes into the shelter on social media during the intake process, and for desirable breeds and puppies (and especially desirable breed puppies) we'd start having potential adopters contacting us immediately, even though we noted it would be a few days before the dog was available. We were a very high-volume shelter and sadly often had to euthanize for space reasons, so our goal was to move dogs through as fast as we possibly could. No reason to only start trying to find a home after the stray hold was up, plus since it was a known thing we did, people who had lost dogs would keep an eye on our site and we did have a few people reunite with their dogs that way since sometimes dogs don't get matched to lost dog reports for various reasons.

Also, not all shelters do much temperament testing. Again, at high-volume or underfunded shelters, as well as smaller rural shelters, it's very common IME for minimal to no temperament testing to be done as long as the dog isn't being dangerous.

The things that are tripping me up is how quickly the spay was arranged, but I *could* see that one as there's no chance that a purebred golden puppy isn't going to get adopted, so if they had a slot available to get it done, might as well.

But also, I'm confused about the intake in general. If it was presented as an owner surrender, there's no need for a hold in most places. I saw a purebred Lab puppy get adopted like an hour after he was surrendered once (he didn't go home that fast as we still had to neuter him and everything, of course). So did the roommate present the dog as a stray? If so, why didn't they scan for a chip? Even at high-volume shelters in areas where chipping is uncommon I've always seen them scan for chips on strays.

It wouldn't be unheard of for a rescue worker to arbitrarily decide someone is a bad owner and cause shit, but it's not that common, especially at municipal shelters where you quickly learn that lost dogs happen even to good owners. The refusal to release the dog would make more sense if people are right that the worker wants to adopt the dog themselves or to friends/family...but then why did they post the dog to social media at all?

I mean, there can be a lot of variation in shelter policies and operation protocols, but this is just such a weird story in so many ways. It's possible, but there are definitely some red flags."
bestoflegaladvice,fffft1x,t1_fff2a6u,1579883022.0,"Three days is actually a pretty standard hold time in my experience. Usually it takes longer to actually adopt most dogs out, but I find it totally believable that they already have adopters lined up for a purebred Golden pup. At the shelters I've volunteered at, we almost always have adopters lined up for purebreds of popular breeds like that and for young puppies of almost any breed before the three-day stray hold is up.

The hold time is usually mandated by law and varies by state and by county/city, though."

I could see a few rare circumstances where a litter of puppies could come into a breed rescue and they adopt them out intact, but it would be super rare. Like, winning the Powerball jackpot rare.

I'd bet money this is a puppy mill broker masquerading as an adoption group, which is a common tactic they use now that people are more generally aware that puppy mills are bad. I don't think LAOP probably did as much research as they think they did.

bestoflegaladvice,ffe1yvi,t1_ffak0o4,1579834599.0,"I used to live in a small town that had this random three-story house (most houses in that region are single-story) that I often went by while walking my dogs or driving to work. Just to set the scene, this house was on kind of a weird lot; it was the corner lot in an old district with weird roads, and the two particular roads around that block narrowed down so it didn't have a house behind it like you'd normally expect. So I had a clear view of 3 out of 4 of its sides, and it was a desert area with a super-barren (even by the area's standards) yard, so I could pretty much see all of it.

There was only one visible door on the first floor, but the second floor had 3 doors that opened up onto nothing, and the third floor had *six.* If not for the third floor, I probably would have just assumed it was a former boarding house with separate entrances that had been knocked down or something like that. But this was not that big of a house; there's no way you'd need six different entrances on the third floor. There wasn't even room for six private bedrooms up there, even assuming a shared bathroom or going down to the second floor to share that bathroom or whatever.

My girlfriend and I used to refer to it as the \[town name\] Mystery House because of that. And it was kind of bizarre. It was obviously old and I'm usually pretty good at tracking down information on older buildings like that, especially in small towns, but neither librarians nor the local historical society nor any of the old timers I knew had any idea why it was built like that. Records indicated it had always been a private residence and that's about all we could figure; it was pretty unremarkable.

bestoflegaladvice,ffe0f32,t1_ffc5u8m,1579833475.0,"Yeah, landlord/tenant law in many jurisdictions does offer different avenues for redress than general premises liability, which is where I think a lot of commenters seem to be approaching this from. I'm not a lawyer, but I do have some professional experience in this area, and in at least one state I've worked in I saw people successfully pursue legal action over safety and habitability concerns even when no actual damages were incurred.

Like, you can't sue the shopping mall because you *almost* tripped over a large crack in a poorly lit parking lot, even though the broken pavement and bad lighting are safety hazards that would be considered if you *did* trip and were injured. However, you may be able to take some form of legal action if your landlord refuses to fix some broken stairs in your residence, even if you just almost trip over them. In the state I worked in it wasn't necessarily an immediate lawsuit, it was more you could withhold rent until it got fixed or deduct reasonable repair expenses from your rent, but there was a path of action, and if you did it right and it was a genuine safety or habitability issue, you'd win in court if it got to that point.

The money I got (well, the business I managed got, but I'm going to use ""I"" here just for clarity's sake) was *my* money. I could blow it all on luxury items for myself with not a single cent going to benefit the animals if I wanted, because it was money paid to me for fulfilling my end of the contract.

In practice the animals usually do benefit quite a bit from the money, both because it's in the owners' best interest to keep them healthy and happy, and because in my experience most people do actually care about their animals, particularly when talking about dogs and horses trained to the point they can ""star"" in a film or TV show, but they're not actually getting paid directly. When you read things talking about Moose's salary or whatever, it's just a cute turn of phrase.

They contract with the animal's owner, and the contract specifies what animals need to be provided to the production. It can be a specific animal (like Toto, or Lassie and Benji would be other examples I can think of where the character was typically played by one dog at a time) or more general (think cattle and background horses in a western; you also see it with dogs when the dog itself isn't famous and especially when it needs to do stunts--even famous dogs get stunt doubles at times), but it's actually the owner who is being hired, and then the owner's contract requires them to make their animal(s) available for filming.

It can be an emotionally difficult process so like I said, I'm not trying to push you into doing it or anything. I just see a common misconception that it's the victim's job to provide proof that something happened, and I think it deters a lot of people from reporting things even if they otherwise would.

Hot air balloons, though? He wasn't losing his mind or anything, but he *hated* watching them drift over our house.

I have to agree with u/FinchHop that the wheelbarrow method is by far the best way to break up dog fights. In my experience it breaks up the vast majority very quickly; most dogs let go in surprise when you lift them up, and at the very least they'll usually release slightly after a bit to re-position and since you're holding them up, that's usually enough to pull them free without causing additional harm to the other dog.

A bite stick (or break stick, that's what my trainer always calls them but I'm guessing it's probably just a regional variation) may be necessary in extreme cases, though, and/or for dogs that are bred to bite and hold. If you're breaking up the fight alone in that circumstance, if possible you want to loop a leash or other rope around the attacking dog's hips (so under their belly just in front of their hind legs) and tie them up wheelbarrow-fashion to something. Then you use the stick to break the bite and get the other dog free.

I've unfortunately had to break up my fair share of dog fights over the years, including a lot of fights involving breeds that are traditionally bred to bite and hold (though most of the ones I have worked with are of unknown origin, so who knows what their actual bloodlines look like--pit bull type dogs are extremely common in some areas I've lived and the mutty ones have a huge range of temperament and drive), and the wheelbarrow method has always worked for me personally. Sometimes it takes a moment for them to actually release, but it usually works pretty fast. I've also been lucky enough to have never been bitten using that method, because it does make it hard for them to go after you.

Shot was tetanus, I'm guessing. You usually have to get them after any puncture wound because that's a good environment for the tetanus virus to grow in.

bestoflegaladvice,ff7iqjr,t1_ff6tukk,1579650497.0,"No problem! It is really a huge difference; IIRC the earliest archaeological evidence of cats in what's now the UK dates back to like 200 BC, whereas they were unknown in North America until European settlers arrived, so a few hundred years ago. After that amount of time in the UK I'm not sure if they can even truly be considered an invasive species anymore, even though they were technically introduced.

And even in the US their impact can vary depending on both the fragility of the ecosystem and the time when they were introduced. Like, I'm from the southwestern US, which ironically did have some of the earliest European settlements but it was all Spanish conquistadors and missionaries who had traveled long distances by land to establish them, so they didn't bring cats with them at first. Coastal areas got cats pretty much immediately, though, since sailors would make sure they had some on the ships for rodent control. And while feral cats will obviously expand their territories on their own, the conditions are harsh enough in much of the southwestern US (and the land mass is big enough) that there were still areas that they didn't really get into until people brought them there.

Sorry for the long spiel, this is an area of interest of mine as a general animal lover (I've got two cats myself) and a birdwatcher and conservationist. Also some of my dates might be a little off as I'm going off the top of my head, but they're in the ballpark."

You know you're probably going to be a bit short on bills next month and have to do some juggling of which ones get paid when, like you do almost every month.

The best thing from a long-term perspective is to put that $20 in savings for next month, of course. But when you never get to have *anything* nice, and you know that you're *always* going to be slogging along juggling bills like this (which is sadly the truth for many people living in poverty, often for factors beyond their control), setting aside that $20 for next month isn't going to make a huge difference in your life, but taking your kids out for a pizza party or fast food or a matinee movie in the theaters can bring your family a lot of happiness and joy. It's not really an irrational decision to choose the significant short-term happiness over possible future benefits when those future benefits are going to be minor and you get so few fun outings like that.

AmItheAsshole,ff1jxmb,t3_eqqejz,1579480380.0,"I know I'm late to this, but as a crazy dog person with working dog who are often exposed to extreme temperatures, I thought my perspective may be helpful.

I gotta give you a very, very mild YTA. I don't think it's cruel to keep a Malamute in a sheltered, padded garage in those temperatures by any means. The reason I'm giving you TA judgment is because it sounds like you disregarded your girlfriend's views despite having far less knowledge and experience with this dog. Unless your girlfriend was clearly way out of line, you gotta defer to her about stuff like this that doesn't endanger the dog. She's the dog's owner, trainer, and manager. She hopefully knows what circumstances will make her dog more comfortable. If you had specific evidence about this particular dog that suggested she'd be happier in a larger but colder space, that might also change things, but just basing it on breed generalizations isn't really enough in this circumstance.

Breed traits are very general and can vary a lot. I'm kind of the opposite of you, I live in a very hot climate and keep Australian Cattle Dogs, a breed that tends to do well in the heat, because of it. I also still honestly don't think 23F is terribly cold. My pups and I routinely camp in those temps and they tend to cuddle a little closer but if they don't, it's not like they're shivering.

But I've had some extremes. I had one purebred, working-bred heeler who was useless when it hit like 85F, which is downright cool by our standards. I currently have one who tends to get restless at night if it drops much below freezing (so 32F/0C), so I leave her at home on our cooler weather camping trips. I'm sure she'd live if I dragged her along, but I'm also sure it wouldn't be fun so why subject her to it?

And that's just temperature alone; there can be a lot of other environmental factors that affect a dog's comfort but might not be immediately obvious. Many owners get a feel for this, though, even though sometimes it can be hard to articulate the specific issues.

If it's 6 of one and half a dozen of another, which this sounds like, always defer to the dog's owner. Maybe she's projecting, but maybe she's just not really that great at articulating the subtle reasons she thinks her dog may prefer the smaller, heated space so is focusing on the heat.

Also, for the record, while you're not wrong about the temperature not being that extreme for a Malamute, you are wrong about the space thing. Lots of dogs prefer smaller spaces in circumstances like this as it's more controllable and feels safer to them.

edit: also, gotta ask...you say she ""felt warm,"" but where did you check? There are specific areas to look for hypothermia risk in canines. Do you know what they are?"
AmItheAsshole,ff169op,t1_fewhrwd,1579475603.0,"I'm a woman and usually pretty astute about social stuff including wedding etiquette, but I could see myself acting like Christine in this situation. First, the groom tells her to go to the bridal suite. Okay, kind of weird, but I've been to some weddings where they take a ""the more, the merrier"" approach.

Then she gets to the bridal suite and probably is getting vibes that this is not one of those situations, but there are two problems. First, it sounds like she didn't know any of these people well, and wedding dynamics can be complex. We don't even know how long she'd been dating the best man. I'm planning a wedding myself so spend a *lot* of time reading wedding forums, and it seems bizarrely common for people to insist that their dates or their friends' dates or whoever get special privileges just because, even when the date clearly doesn't even want them. She might have been sitting there wondering if there was behind-the-scenes drama that she wasn't privy to but that leaving the bridal suite could set off.

Even when OP gave her the vague out with the ""If you're bored, don't feel obligated,"" line, that kind of makes it worst. If I was worrying about that kind of drama, that would definitely feel like a trap. Even if I wasn't, I'm not sure I could really tell whether the bride--a stranger, in the OP's own words--would be offended by me suggesting that I was indeed bored. Like, my good friend says that, I know she means it genuinely. Some rando? I have no idea. But more importantly, it also doesn't address the practical issue--I really wonder if Christine even knew where she *was* supposed to hang out instead.

Hear me out. OP says there was a big, comfortable lobby--but often things that seem obvious to someone who has spent ages poring over all the details of the venue layout (say, the bride) aren't nearly as obvious to guests. And I've been to weddings at venues with kind of confusing restrictions on where guests can be.

I gotta go with a light YTA because of those issues. Christine seems fairly gracious--she didn't attempt to insert herself into the conversation, she didn't object when she was told in an unambiguous but still gentle way to leave. She just sounds like she was kind of unobtrusively sitting there while it was unclear what everyone wanted her to do.

OP or one of her bridesmaids could have just solved the whole problem right away when Christine walked in by saying, ""Oh, this is just for the wedding party! Guests are hanging out downstairs \[or wherever the lobby was located relative to OP's suite; I probably wouldn't call it 'the lobby' myself\]."" Or she could have clearly asked Christine to leave, especially when she had the practical reason of the makeup to point to: ""I'm sorry, Christine, but this is a pretty crowded space and I don't have room. Would you mind waiting in the lobby for a bit?""

It's really unfair to a guest (particularly a ""special"" guest like the date of a member of the wedding party, because they often do get different treatment like sitting at the head table even if they aren't in the wedding party themselves) to be mad at her for doing what the groom told her to do, even if she could have perhaps picked up on some hints that it was the wrong thing. But clear instructions from one host generally trump subtle hints from the other host, so she was in a pretty difficult situation.

edit: Also, I gotta say, my wedding is in a little over two months and I pray something like this is the worst thing that happens at it. My fiance is wonderful and I know it will be wonderful regardless because I'm marrying the man I love, but with our crazy families I am expecting much more drama (his family's religion thinks people of my family's religion are devil worshippers, as just a starting point...), so I gotta say YTA on that basis alone.

AmItheAsshole,ff0z3uw,t1_fezvct3,1579473713.0,"I agree with u/Storm137, although the mass isn't what's concerning to me. It is really common for dogs to get benign tumors and lipomas as they age.

I and all of my cousins have shacked up with partners before marriage, and I know most of my female cousins use hormonal birth control even after marriage, but we still maintain the polite fiction that we don't because openly acknowledging it would create an insane amount of family drama. And maybe we should, but you say that when you're talking about blowing up your own family. Besides, the older generation already must know. No one really believes a romantically involved couple is living together for years and not having sex, or that our family is apparently supremely blessed to only get kids if and when we want them, yet that's how it's worked out for most of my generation.

The polite fiction is important in some cultures. I think it's stupid, but it's a real thing. I'd be fine with the OP confronting their sister in person and in private, but blowing that shit up on social media? Definite YTA. Potential for ESH if the sister's fiance is genuinely misled, but there's a really solid chance he isn't. But even if he was, social media is not the place to do that shit."
bestof,fev3qx6,t1_fep0l7b,1579392767.0,"I think u/CharmCityRedditor kind of oversimplified the issue with the deaf/Deaf community. Culture is strongly shaped by language, and that's still true for Deaf people who sign as a primary language. They're still influenced by the majority culture they're in, of course, so like a deaf American isn't going to be culturally the same as a deaf French person, but it is still a distinct culture and at least ASL (and I'd guess probably all sign languages, but I've only ever researched this issue in the US) isn't like a direct 1:1 translation of American English. It has its own jokes, puns, idioms, sentence structure, etc. that don't translate directly to spoken English.

There also has been a long history of an emphasis on oralism, which is a teaching approach focused on getting all deaf people to speak and understand spoken English. This isn't inherently bad for people capable of it, but not all deaf people are capable of it, and some schools and prominent charities have focused on it even to the point of refusing to communicate in sign--which of course is extremely harmful to the people who cannot learn to speak and read lips for whatever reasons.

Cochlear implants themselves aren't always all they're cracked up to be, although a big part of the reason this issue is so controversial is because people who get them as young children tend to report a higher level of satisfaction with them than people who get them as adults do. So that is probably coloring some people's attitudes towards it, if they received a cochlear implant and it didn't work well for them.

The cultural issue is the big one, though, and it's a valid concern. [The Atlantic wrote a pretty short but decent explainer on the issue if you care to read it](https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2013/08/understanding-deafness-not-everyone-wants-to-be-fixed/278527/), but I think a quote that sums it up well is:

>The debate stems from a fundamental disagreement: one group sees deafness as a disability, and the other group sees it as a culture. The trouble is that the former group holds a disproportionate amount of power, and the latter group are the ones affected.

edit: For the record, I am not deaf and have no firsthand experience with this. I am a professional editor and am fascinated by language and how it shapes our beliefs and cultures, though, and I have also worked on a few articles and papers about this issue. I want to be clear that I do not speak for the Deaf community. I just also used to believe that it was crazy that anyone would be opposed to cochlear implants but learned that it is actually a pretty nuanced issue."

Everyone else has addressed the comment on your manager's body, but I just want to address this part. The coworker's inference that you were calling her body manly was definitely not ridiculous in this context. Broad shoulders are generally considered a masculine trait, so when you follow up commenting on a woman's broad shoulders with an example involving men with ""feminine bodies,"" it's going to come across as suggesting that she has a similarly non-conforming physique; ie. that she has a masculine (or manly) body.

Think about it like someone breaking into your house just to chat vs. making small talk in the waiting room at the DMV...in the former situation, it's an intrusion and is going to feel very scary even if the person who breaks into your house has no intention to harm you. In the latter, at worst it's mildly annoying if you just want to read your book or whatever, but it isn't scary.

They're a really awful anti-choice tactic because they often pretend to be pro-choice in their advertising and initial contacts with pregnant women, then attempt to guilt or manipulate women who want abortions into not terminating. Things they've been caught doing include providing false information (suggesting the pregnancy is too far along to legally terminate is the worst, but they also often provide false information about fetal development to suggest the fetus is more far along than it is in an attempt to guilt the woman) and in a few cases straight-up illegal shit like locking patients in rooms when they try to leave before listening to the anti-choice spiel.

A lot aren't quite that extreme, but they still actively mislead women who think they're getting unbiased information or even that they'll be able to receive an abortion at that clinic but instead are subjected to information geared towards convincing them to carry the pregnancy to term. There are also sometimes shady agreements with adoption agencies that also may color the advice being given (note that Planned Parenthood and many other abortion providers will refer patients to adoption agencies if the patient requests it, but there isn't the kind of direct relationship that some CPCs have).

I actually do think they're a pretty good idea in theory. Planned Parenthood in particular will give you all the same kind of referrals to resources if you want to keep your pregnancy, but having specialized agencies to provide more intensive guidance would be a great thing. In practice, though, they're super-shady and are designed to push an anti-choice agenda."

And if it's expensive beer, they might assume he has cash or other drugs on him as well. I know it won't take a raging alcoholic terribly long to work through 24 beers, but there's still a period of time where he's going to be having to figure that out.

On the moral stuff, which I think is what OP is really asking about, I say NAH.

Not trying to be a jerk, but Banjo clearly isn't a purebred ACD based on that picture. He's got a very strong ACD influence obviously, but I could see the Dal guess as a mix. It wouldn't be my personal first guess, but guessing breeds is a crapshoot and heavily influenced by normal breeds in your area. Honestly, if Banjo came into my shelter, I'd probably just label him as an ACD mix without a secondary breed, but he really clearly isn't just an ACD.

Foxy is much more classic ACD based on that picture and I would probably just call her an ACD. She could very well be a purebred heeler based on that picture.

I really am not trying to call you out; you obviously aren't that involved in this interaction. But matching dogs with homes is complicated and it really isn't rare at all for dogs to act differently in different homes.

Or here's this for an example for what I'm talking about: One of my friends adopted a dog with well-known fear and aggression issues, and I acted as transport. Dog was totally shut down during the two-day drive so was fine in a behavioral sense with me.

When I go visit my friend, though? The dog (who is normally good, though a bit high-maintenance) is really fear-aggressive towards me. Only thing we can figure is he associates me with that horrible stressful time.

Dogs displaying significantly different behavior in different environments is normal, especially for a breed like ACDs that are kind of known for wariness, sensitivity, and aggression (and I want to emphasize that these are actually desirable traits in a working environment).

You're doing a great thing by fostering Rex! But I also am really impressed by the potential adopters driving all that distance and keeping him overnight. That's a lot of time and money and effort and suggests they weren't just kicking tires."
dogs,felswyh,t3_epthmg,1579230132.0,"I do a lot of dog rescue, ranging from facilitating adoptions and working with dogs in shelter to fostering and adopting myself. ACDs, and particularly difficult ACDs, are my favorite critters in the world. I've owned 7 for life, all rescues, and I've fostered maybe 10-15 others for short terms.

This seems like a big rescue failure to me. 50 pounds is definitely outside what you'd expect from an ACD, and people are horrible at estimating size based on weight. The breed standard tops out at like 35 pounds. Also, people are awful at estimating size based on weights even in very popular breeds, and in my experience ACDs aren't super well-known, particularly back east. You're right that that was a big communication failure. (edit: and to be clear, since I was interrupted in the middle of writing this paragraph which is why it's so repetitive, in my experience people almost always overestimate dogs' sizes. I have a 25-pound heeler mix who most people assume is 40-50 pounds)

I don't think the adopters are the ones who need more education, though. Any halfway experienced rescue person should know about the weight/size estimate issue (it comes up *a lot*). And honestly, while it isn't terribly unheard of for unexpected aggression issues to occur in a new adoption, particularly when it's that kind of stressful long-distance handoff, I can't blame the adopters a bit to not want to work with a dog who is growling at them on the first night. I don't think that's a bad dog, and I agree that the adopters should have been vetted better, but that's on the rescue. People have varying levels of interest in dog training. Me, I see a dog growling at me as a fun challenge, because I am insane. Most people, they want a nice pet who maybe has a few issues but doesn't scare them. Neither approach is right or wrong, as long as they get the right dog for their needs. These adopters did the best thing by returning the dog.

As a rescue, you're the dog experts. People trust you to guide them to the right pup for their needs. If you guide them wrong, that's on you.

For example, an attorney might ask, ""You said just now that you didn't kill her. What did you mean when you told police 'I killed her?'"" I formatted that the ""proper"" way.

But you'd write that in a transcript as:

Q    You said just now that you didn't kill her. What did you mean when you told police, ""I killed her""?

Because including the period (or rather comma) after ""her"" is kind of confusing and hard to read, but including the question mark inside the quotes does imply that it is part of the quote, which can open up room for argument.

But if the quote was a question, you might include the question mark inside the quotes. So if an attorney was asking for clarification on a witness's testimony, you could also see something like:

Q    Why did you say, ""Are you saying I killed her?""

AmItheAsshole,fehhgsm,t1_feh8j50,1579116619.0,"Aw, thanks. My parents are pretty awesome and I'm very lucky to have them. They weren't always this close, there was some tension and distance during and immediately after the divorce, but they've never treated each other with anything but kindness and respect, and they both have always believed that even though their romantic relationship wasn't working anymore, they're still family since they have kids together and all.

Though honestly, I've worked in family law and I think there are more couples like my parents than a lot of people realize. You hear the horror stories, and for good reason--when divorces go bad, they can go *really* bad. But for every shitshow, there are numerous amicable divorces where people just peacefully work things out in mediation and either go their separate ways or have a great co-parenting relationship or whatever. It's just not that interesting when it works like that, so no one talks about it."
AmItheAsshole,feh5mia,t1_feg6689,1579109635.0,"I don't even know that it's *that* common in the US. My family never stocked it and I haven't noticed it all that much in various first aid kits I've used. I do keep some in my house but only because I have dogs and it can be used as an emetic if they eat something toxic. It's not recommended for use on injuries in the US anymore, though it was a traditional remedy so I'm sure it still persists.

Definite YTA to the OP. It's a common chemical, sure, but we all have our blind spots. Doesn't make him dumb and that doesn't really seem like a joke even from the start."
AmItheAsshole,fegtq7c,t1_fegcj41,1579102323.0,"General ""adults only"" communities and apartments are illegal under the FHA, which prohibits discrimination based on family status.

Senior housing (55+) is in a separate category and those buildings/communities are permitted (relevant federal law is the Housing for Older Persons Act) as long as they meet certain rules.

Comment you're replying to is still wrong for this situation though, since the FHA doesn't apply to landlords renting out a room in a shared dwelling."
AmItheAsshole,fefxk91,t1_feffbfk,1579068535.0,"I was hospitalized for about two weeks with a life-threatening illness when I was 2. My mom is a super easy crier, my dad is much more stoic. I have no memories of this time since I was so young, but I've heard stories of it.

My mom was apparently crying constantly because she was so scared, and my dad was always comforting her. The thing is, they're divorced now (not at all related to that), and now that I'm in my 30s they've both been very candid about a lot of my childhood stuff like that. They're also still excellent friends; like, not just casual ""oh we still get along but are distant co-parents"" friends but like ""oh we go on hikes together fairly regularly and talk on the phone like once a week and sometimes get together for dinner just because"" friends.

They both fully acknowledge that my mom was a mess and my dad was powering through it, but the funny thing is, they both talk about that as a positive thing. My mom talks about how supportive my dad was, the kind of stuff you'd expect. My dad, though, that's where it gets interesting, because he appreciated being able to comfort my mom because he felt so helpless not being able to do much for me. And it's really interesting for me to hear about that because I know their general difference in emotional responses to small things played a big role in their divorce, but apparently in crises it worked.

That's not to say OP's brother is like my dad, but I thought it might be a helpful illustration of how variable these things can be. But OP is YTA regardless, because who the fuck berates a freaked-out parent of a dangerously ill child? WTF is wrong with you?

(edit: and for the record, I know that my parents fell into very traditional gender roles in that instance too, which is also kind of funny to me as otherwise they really didn't--my dad sacrificed a lot to support my mom's career, did most of the childcare when we were growing up, and pretty evenly split other household chores. It just worked out that way in that situation for them)"
AmItheAsshole,fefvckq,t1_fecvbyd,1579066394.0,"So true. My fiance sometimes uses an eye mask when his work fucks with his shifts and he needs to sleep late. He's still way faster than me about responding to one of our critters horking like they're going to throw up, and I'm sure would also be way faster than me if there was an actual danger. I'm a heavy sleeper though and it takes me awhile to wake up (if I even do..I have slept through a smoke alarm going off), whereas he's a light one who is ready to go immediately.

I feel for OP but that's not a healthy attitude on multiple levels."
AmItheAsshole,feedaok,t1_fedf6jo,1579031391.0,"Seriously! I'm getting married in a couple of months and actually did buy a cheap, nontraditional wedding dress. I still spent about $400 on the actual dress and about $200 more on alterations to get a really flattering fit.

The dresses I buy to be a wedding *guest* are typically $200-300, even with outlet shopping and looking for deals. I don't alter them, so that's the total cost, but it's still a lot more expensive that OP thinks.

Women's fashion is expensive as fuck and changes regularly. It's not really comparable to most men's fashion, unless the dude is a real fashionista (fashionisto?) on the cutting edge of style. There are some trends that don't age well, but something like a tuxedo is usually going to be fairly timeless and usually the minor trend variances are fairly easy to alter. There are some exceptions, like if his dad was really into the pastel formal wear trend, but I'm guessing he probably would have mentioned that if that was the case.

And I'll note this is definitely a middle-class or higher perspective. I know women who got married in $30 dresses from Target and looked gorgeous. But when you're dropping a minimum of $20k on a wedding like these two are, the expectations of how the bride and groom are going to look are a bit different. You can't expect her to go to her own $20k wedding in a cheap $100 dress. It is noticeable. Good people shouldn't and won't judge her for it, but I know I wouldn't feel good wearing something like that to my wedding. And I'm not even some fashionista, my typical outfit is jeans or hiking pants and a t-shirt. But since I do know how to dress for more formal occasions, I feel awkward if I don't meet those standards. And unfortunately, women's fashion standards tend to be expensive.

AmItheAsshole,fee141e,t1_fedsoaq,1579024201.0,"Seriously, the blame some people are putting on the bully's sister is really pissing me off. I have 3 siblings, two of whom are wonderful people (and I like to think I'm halfway decent, too). One of my brothers is a nightmare, though. He was an awful bully in high school and caused a lot of people a lot of pain (and has continued to wreck his own life and others to date, for that matter, but as adults people can choose to avoid him). Two of the people he bullied in high school were also two of my best friends.

I'm older than my brother too but by the time he was 13 he was way bigger than me, and he was fully capable of making my life miserable and beating me up. Our parents were very aware of his issues and took them extremely seriously, even working with developmental psychologists and other experts to figure out what was going on with him and trying to correct it, but not much seemed to work on him for very long.

I got a lot of cruel treatment myself from my brother's victims, which as an adult I understand but as a teenager was so awful. My worst bully (because yes, it was bullying) actually targeted me *because* of who my brother was and the fact that we didn't get along so he would usually not do anything to her for treating me like shit.

My two friends who stood by me in spite of my brother's awful treatment of them are still two of my best friends today, and I'm so grateful to them. I already suffered from a lot of suicidal ideation and self harm, and I might have gone through with it if not for them.

Some bullies come from families where that kind of behavior is ignored or even celebrated, but not all of them. It's unfair to assume someone is bad just because one of their siblings is. Even if they seem to ignore the behavior...what is a sibling supposed to do? I guess some may have influence, like I've got a younger sister too and she sometimes pulled some minor ""mean girl"" stuff that I called her out on and she shaped up, but that's because we're really close and she cared about what I had to say. Same with my older brother calling me out when I was being a jerk--I knew he couldn't make me do anything but I felt bad about disappointing him. My younger brother didn't care about any of that."
bestoflegaladvice,fedpb53,t1_fe58731,1579016954.0,"I never understood how people could mix those up until someone pointed out that a lot of them have probably only heard it pronounced, so they're thinking ""wear"" with a ""y"" attached to the end. I guess I kind of get how that can happen...

It drives me insane too. Although once I did have someone hilariously correct me when I used ""weary"" properly and they thought I was misusing the word ""wary."""
bestoflegaladvice,fecyhgd,t1_fecm303,1578989858.0,"I got the impression that she definitely believed she was being arrested for the stolen vehicle. The conversation between the officers about how those charges wouldn't apply happened when she was sitting in the police car and they were standing outside of it, so she probably couldn't hear them well, and they were definitely focused on the stolen vehicle when talking to her

edit: Yeah, I just watched the part where they catch up to her again, and she even really clearly says, ""I told you I didn't steal that car. You guys told me I was going to jail for something I didn't do. Now I'm going to jail for something I did."" Like I said, stupid as hell, but I can appreciate where she's coming from in a way."
bestoflegaladvice,febwntz,t1_febvckm,1578963570.0,"To be fair, ""just filled with stupidity"" seems to describe like 99% of police stops that are interesting enough to be featured on Youtube, much less network TV."

Second one I can't watch all of at the moment and doesn't seem anything distinctive in the few minutes I could watch, but I'll watch it later. Sorry that's kind of a cop-out response."
bestoflegaladvice,febms1m,t1_febkly0,1578960516.0,"That first one honestly seems totally standard to me, but to be fair I do have a pretty extreme addict in my immediate family.

The second one, was that Live PD too? Because if so, I think I saw that. I remember it mostly because she was wearing a lovely loose-knit white top that I liked. I don't even watch Live PD all that much but I was traveling a lot for the holidays and with hotel TV plus the holiday recap episodes and the fact that A&E seems to be Live PD and Forensic Files 24/7 now, I saw it like 5 times.

If it is that one, she was dumb as hell but I can appreciate the logic. If you're already getting accused of something and don't think you can resolve it, might as well do what you're being punished for. That actually doesn't work well in a legal sense, but it's a pretty common impulse and there is some logic behind it, even though the foundations are deeply flawed."
