Just make it so skill rating doesn’t change if you quit the game in the first half, or if you quit any time when not losing.  Or a 24hr ban for anyone that quits 5 rivals games in a day."
FIFA,ffg7yrw,t1_fffrm60,1579900415.0,"Actually seems pointless.  A legit Div 1/2 player can win almost every game in Div 4.

FIFA,ffeha5g,t1_ffed8ba,1579847966.0,"Were Bayern on shit form last year too?  Because I showed you they still only won 70% of games.  Even with all games at home, on 2018/19 form, their chance to win 3 in a row is below 50%."
FIFA,ffed00u,t1_ffdv5oh,1579843553.0,Obviously you have no clue how probability works.  They’ve only won 60% of their games this year and even last year they only won 70% of the time.  So that makes their chance of winning 3 in a row somewhere between 20 and 35%.  Except two of their opponents are 1st and 5th so it’s actually lower than that.

And it does not say “humanity killed”.  So if you want to get upset that a few million humans *might* have contributed to extinction of wooly mammoths and Sabretooth tigers, along with an ice age and giant comets hitting the Earth, go ahead.

PremierLeague,ffarvy9,t1_ffakecf,1579743048.0,"You just seem confused.  The issue isn’t if the VAR agrees with the ref, and if he disagrees then how can he decide it’s clear and obvious if you have two opposing opinions and the ref can’t see the replay.  And if you want to use Rugby as a reference then you should at least understand the system:

1) the ref can see everything on the big video screen

2) the ref makes the final decision and sometimes he disagrees with the TMO.  The TMO is only there to advise."
PremierLeague,ffaiggp,t1_ffagpom,1579736502.0,"Thats the reason to look at the monitor.  If there’s no contact then VAR can just decide no penalty and no need for the ref to look at the monitor.  If VAR says there’s contact but I wouldnt have called that a penalty then that’s only his personal opinion.  The only way to overturn is if the ref also looks and says yes, now that I can see it better I wouldn’t call it a pen either.  

All the internet refs are certain of every decision, usually biased by being fans of one team, hating the other, or just trolling or click baiting.  But outside of offside, hand ball, and an obvious no contact on a foul there is almost always some subjectivity.  And people still complain that 1 inch offside is still offside or because they don’t like the new handball rule."
PremierLeague,ffag60y,t1_ffaefju,1579734981.0,And people complained because subjective decisions are almost never “clear and obvious” to VAR.  Now if VAR decides it’s subjective (and would therefore not overturn) the ref has a chance to reverse himself by deciding after looking at the replay.

PremierLeague,ffa982t,t3_eshxig,1579730348.0,"Depends what the ref is told by the VAR official.  If the VAR says this is what I see and the ref thinks that matches what he saw then the decision is just confirmed.  The point of the monitor is if VAR sees something inconsistent but it’s subjective the ref can now look and compare to what he thought happened with the idea that it is easier for him to overrule himself on a subjective decision.  So if VAR says no contact, he dived, again no need for the monitor; decision overturned.  If VAR says there’s contact but it looks like the player went down a bit too easily then ref goes to the monitor.

Btw it was a clear pen, gave a dodgy push in the back which he might have got away with, but then kicked his foot pretty hard and nowhere close to getting the ball.  If there was any doubt VAR was looking if it was outside the box.  Stupid foul because the ball was going away from goal and there was no danger."

FIFA,ff91lue,t1_ff8vvjb,1579702573.0,Why do you think it isn’t built in already?  A player can still have 80 or 78 or 76 finishing on his weak foot.  If a player has a certain rating for shooting or passing that already reflects his overall ability on a 1-99 scale; weak foot rating is just about assigning a relative ability between the feet.  Ratings are already very subjective so how can you even begin to decide so precisely for each foot?

- the people giving the explanations often have no idea what’s actually been coded and don’t check with the people who do know

Gullit is a player that only a few can afford; when they buy they are never going to sell him.  Even many of the people that pack one will keep it.

soccer,fev5oc6,t1_fetwbxg,1579393422.0,"FIFA tests require only an accuracy of 3cm, it’s Hawkeye that claims 3mm or whatever ridiculous number they have now.  And the FIFA tests are not even realistic.  You have one that uses a stationary ball at a known height where you have a margin of 3cm. Then you have one with a moving ball where there’s a wall that’s placed behind the goal line and you shoot against it.  To pass it has to give a goal when the wall is 24cm behind the line; a football has a diameter of 22cm and of course it will compress but only in a direction favorable to giving a goal.  Then it has to not give a goal when the wall is 12cm behind the line; the only way you could fail that test would be actually bursting the ball on impact, but the required speed is so slow that it would embarrass a Sunday League player.

Please don’t pretend you know something when you just read some newspaper article repeating Hawkeye’s PR.  Anything less than about 3cm and it’s a complete guess as to whether it’s a goal or not.  As proven in cricket and tennis (which both claim 2-5mm accuracy) it is perfectly possible to see Hawkeye mistakes of several cm.
