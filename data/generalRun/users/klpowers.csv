AJelqForYou,ffaskmr,t3_esld94,1579743512.0,"5 inches is average and enough to have good sex. But if you compare yourself to guys with massive cocks well you will think you're small. Almost every guy would want at least one inch more, even the big guys."
citypop,ffa98hf,t3_di6j2n,1579730354.0,"I dont find ""Angel Touch"" overproduced. Miho Nakayama songs are way more overproduced than Cindy's. Still good though"
MassiveCock,ffa84po,t3_esd1ui,1579729738.0,Holy shit!
ANTM,ff5ow1f,t1_ff5g858,1579603880.0,"Not like a model, just a beuatiful person. Little differences make a model. Tyra always is comparing actresses to models."
rupaulsdragrace,ff3rspe,t3_eretks,1579547462.0,Sometimes i forget Monet won actually. Monique was done dirty.
ANTM,ff3rngi,t3_ereufk,1579547374.0,"For me she looks more like a celebrity or an actress or singer, not a model"
gaypornhunters,ff1abu2,t1_ff0rqit,1579476824.0,Hehehe that's just because i watched that video several times. Andy Star is very cute
gaypornhunters,feyd1ba,t3_eqw2g1,1579443956.0,They are Big Marcos and Andy Star
rupaulsdragrace,few75jp,t3_eqmjxj,1579406287.0,You look spooky but i bet you're really nice
ANTM,fenibkf,t3_eq1fch,1579285305.0,She looks like she's running for president or something like that
ANTM,feinatl,t1_feidu1a,1579142531.0,Leila had a terrible walk at the time. Nastasia was the full package imo. And Leila proved she didnt needed to win to have an amazing career
ANTM,fehy1wt,t1_fehxvbm,1579126157.0,"Take off your tank top, take off the belt and tie your hair in a ponytail. There you go. See the difference? DO YOU SEE IT?"
ANTM,fehxsv4,t3_eoykhn,1579126009.0,"This is an amazing shot but your overall film wasnt good. 

(shrinks neck) 

Actress

(Elongates neck)

Model

See the difference? Alright, thanks. â˜º

Now the judges and I will deliberate."
cats,fehxdb0,t3_ep0uzv,1579125752.0,"So sorry for your loss. I believe that our beloved pets are waiting for us somewhere, as well as our loved ones. She is with you in spirit and as long as you remember her she will live somehow. Hugs."
ANTM,fehwygj,t3_ep2hmd,1579125514.0,Robin (or Robynne) is one of the most controversial contestants in ANTM. Say whatever you want to say about her but she was a very important character in C1. She was part of a lot of drama and memorable moments.
GaybrosGoneWild,fef1ea2,t3_eoscgr,1579045896.0,Omg that looks so cute ðŸ˜»
Tekken,febsz7z,t3_elby6r,1578962310.0,I think its more like a bait. I dont like it and sometimes even forget its an option. But i do get baited lots of times. When my opponent is in rage i know he can do a rage art and i should be careful but no matter how i approach it i always get baited by it. I know it can be blocked and punished but my timing and luck are always bad in that case
ANTM,fdhfvmu,t3_el6g0s,1578421776.0,"This was obviously done on purpose to get rid of Nicole, who was actually a strong model and likeable girl (stronger than Ann and Norelle, even Amanda imo). 

Nicole Borud, the first victim of the ""no personality"" edit."
ANTM,fdfveq8,t3_ekm4xk,1578371246.0,Natasha. I never liked her..i thought she was fake and her portfolio was inconsistent.
rupaulsdragrace,fdc5f99,t1_fdam20v,1578267454.0,Im with you. I really dont find him attractive at all but its just personal taste. He isnt ugly by any means.
Tekken,fd6bzsg,t3_eb7kec,1578188651.0,"Imo i would get rid of Katarina, Gigas and Josie. The rest are ok but should be developed more."
gaymersgonewild,fcvut2t,t3_eixqgf,1578010589.0,"We're kinda similar. I would get rid of the fat on the sides, but other than that i think you look really hot."
ANTM,fcsp7cg,t3_eimejr,1577921618.0,Idk but Kelly Cutrone would be Ursula.
rupaulsdragrace,fcm6z6u,t3_ehu56a,1577765855.0,That's not Shangela. That's Jada Pinkett Smith
ANTM,fcm6tg7,t3_ehtks7,1577765734.0,"Kendal, April, Samantha (C8), Eugena, Katarzyna"
ANTM,fclgtah,t3_ehrqut,1577747452.0,She looks more like a Playboy model or a b-rate movie actress tbh. But she is very pretty and sexy.
cats,fcl26l0,t3_ehkqrg,1577738188.0,Im sorry for you but you should be very proud and feel very lucky to have your cat friend for 20 years. She will be waiting for you somewhere in Heaven.
ANTM,fck4u30,t3_ehkwh6,1577716627.0,"Bethany. Obligatory ""Who?"" (i know who she is btw)"
ANTM,fcil7mn,t3_ehcq0v,1577664425.0,"Ava had the worst. Honorable mentions include Hannah C11, Marvita, Stacy-Ann, Cassandra C5."
Pizza,fcikxox,t3_ehagej,1577664284.0,I've never seen a pizza that looked so good. Omg
ANTM,fcfr9mg,t3_eh4irb,1577632964.0,"6-5 Joanie wins. But to be honest, they were pretty even. They both had a couple of weak pictures (ice princesses) and also standouts (Danielle's fairy tales and Joanie's future goals). They also were neck and neck sometimes (bald, dolls)."
ANTM,fcfpdgz,t3_eh4i34,1577632458.0,"Very difficult to judge who did better in the circus, Fabio, celebrity impersonations, runway on water and the horrible foundation in space photo. A lot of photoshoots were very bad this season. Michelle wins by default 5-4. I think Michelle was more edgy than Amanda, but both were high fashion. They almost never dissapointed."
ANTM,fcfo2ne,t3_eh49f2,1577632128.0,"Allison is still my winner, but she is so overrated by fans. Yes, she did amazing, but Teyona did pretty consistent as well. I agree completely with you, OP. Allison gets so much love, that she totally deserves, but fans are too biased towards her. Personally i would give Teyona the Ciara photo and the CG photo."
ANTM,fcfn7vk,t3_eh47xl,1577631927.0,Chantal's stranded in desert picture was the best of the week.
ANTM,fcfmt9y,t3_eh478o,1577631799.0,"Nastasia did so well at the Nine West ad that she couldve won the competition. Laura and Leila did ok, but Kiara's photo was terrible. Not top2 worthy"
cats,fc7djd0,t3_egbld0,1577504252.0,What a beautfiul cat! So elegant. You should be very proud
ANTM,fc4opbw,t3_eei7ck,1577423060.0,"Tahlia had a great face and gave at least a couple of good photos. To me she looked borderline plus size, like Sarah C9. Excluding her scars, she didnt had a model body. And she was obviously used for sob story purposes. Shame on you, Tyra"
ANTM,fc4o3ii,t3_efnq1c,1577422505.0,"Spanish dub is actually not that bad, i watched the show like this for a loooong time. I do like Tyra's voice. 

However lots of things and jokes or references get lost in translation especially when 'bitch' is translated to 'bruja'. Actually 'bitch' is 'perra'."
ANTM,fc4as5a,t1_fc3zvvh,1577411301.0,"I think the shot couldve been a lot better, but the bodysuits and helmets made all girls look the same and it was horrible..only Caridee had a slightly usable photo. And they didnt even bother to give Eugena a matching foundation color."
ANTM,fbyizw4,t3_ef0hbx,1577218099.0,"Raina was good, everybody loves her, but Krista was much stronger overseas and had a better runway. However both of them had lackluster CG photos."
ANTM,fbwndig,t3_eemw14,1577154465.0,"Victoria was a very interesting girl, but i see her taking Ambreal's spot at best."
