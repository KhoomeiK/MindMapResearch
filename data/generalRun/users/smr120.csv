I understand what it's like to not tell anyone about how you're feeling, depression or normal sadness, and it's not fun. As someone who thinks I'm garbage enough already, I don't want to burden anyone with my problems, but I know bottling it all up is bad too. That's why I suggest not dating while depressed, because either you share it and are called manipulative (they're not wrong) or you get worse and worse for what appears to be no reason to your SO. It's not good on any front. If you can handle it, go for it, it might help make you better; but if not, it'll only make things worse."
