crochet,fe7yygu,t1_fe6o2va,1578920646.0,It’s the [Klaziena](http://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/klaziena-shawl) shawl. The designer has some other shawl patterns that are equally interesting and lovely.

crochet,fdf0h75,t1_fdf0a2f,1578350535.0,"Thanks! If you're interested, it was sc around, dc around, then alternating fpdc/bpdc. Hope you post your project when it's done!"
crochet,fdf004p,t1_fdezcdy,1578350239.0,"Hope you are having fun making it!!

So it's the same stitch count (mult of 10 + 4), I just changed the points of the flowers to bobbles. For example, the first row is ""sc in first 4, ch 10, sc"" and instead of the chain and single I did a bobble where the single is. So if you follow the pattern for a few rows and swap in the bobbles it will be really easy to finish the rest. Hope that helps! 

I also changed the border; forgot to mention that in my post. It's fpdc/bpdc, because I thought the pattern border was weird too."
