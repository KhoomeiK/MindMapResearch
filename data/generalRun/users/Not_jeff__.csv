Her dad was a super smart engineer and her mom remarried a rich guy so she was spoiled by both. Whenever money came up, she’d always say “my moms gonna get me a job at her husbands place where I’ll make six figures starting out”. Or she’d say, “my parents make way more than your parents or you ever will”. This is why I broke up with her a while ago. Thing is, she doesn’t try at all in school and frankly is kind of stupid when it comes to conceptual topics in what she’s majoring. Pisses me off to know she probably will get a good job because of her parents while I’m here working my ass off only to maybe get half of that"
