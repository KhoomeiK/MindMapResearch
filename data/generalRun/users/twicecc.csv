Cardinals,ffwtzvf,t1_ffwragm,1580310962.0,I try and stay at the Westin as it is directly across the street from the stadium and you can get a room that looks directly at the stadium.  Looking at the days you will be in town it looks like the westin is $245 per and the Hyatt is $174.  I have stayed at the Hyatt numerous times and it's a few easy blocks from Busch Stadium and basically across the street from the arch so that may be a better option.  Both places charge for parking so that won't make a difference

I have had many over the years and the type of business you are in designates the risk the bank takes.  More risk equals higher rates and and less risk equal lower rates.   There are plenty of places online that promise low rates and fast turnaround and some do actually do that.  However, I found the quickest way to get the money was if you use the bank that you bank with.  They will be able to put you in touch with a merchant account provider."

Since these are important guests I would call the hotel and talk to the manager and see what they will do for you.   It sounds like even if you have to pay a daily rate for the wifi you may want to do that as these are special guests.  However, I have found almost everytime that Marriotts are accomodating in one way or another.  They may give you the wifi free for all the rooms because you booked a block of rooms."

marriott,fek0vie,t3_epkvfe,1579190213.0,You are able to get the points for up to 3 rooms including your own.   As far as the other rooms getting your status benefits that is completely up to the hotel.  If you are hosting a meeting you will want to check with the sales manager regarding wifi in the meeting room and during the meeting.   Most places will allow you to use it for free and others will want to charge you per user.  I have booked hundreds of meetings at Marriott properties in the last few years and would be happy to assist if you want to dm me.
