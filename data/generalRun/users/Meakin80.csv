loseit,feet86j,t3_eoq7ux,1579040707.0,"Ride it out. People get tired of mentioning it eventually or get used to your smaller size. Most of the comments are backed by envy. Just ignore them and they’ll eventually stop (as long as you don’t go too far and get down to an unhealthy weight). Voice of experience here. Yes it’s annoying, but it’s temporary. Hang in there."

What you’re actually doing is scaring or startling the person which, once they realize what just happened, will just get angry that you scared or startled them. Or get enraged that you scared or startled them and then take that out on you. You never know someone else’s brand of crazy. You have to protect yourself, especially when you’re not the one safe inside a vehicle."
