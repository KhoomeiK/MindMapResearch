I know I’m in the minority, but it seems to me the cost:benefit ratio is stronger for reckoning than not reclining.

Racing for 10 minutes could also burn as many calories as jogging for 30 minutes, but it’s nonsensical to say “running is three times better for you than running.”


The real YSK is that you’re more likely to stick with an exercise routine if you like it. We’re all busy, but if we’re honest, almost everyone who has 10 minutes to exercise also has 30 minutes to exercise. Your time is better spent finding an exercise you don’t mind, rather than one that’s as short as possible. If you find jumping rope more enjoyable, great — it’s a good exercise. Personally, I enjoy running, in part because I get to enjoy the outdoors while I do it. Others may enjoy swimming, or biking (indoors or out), or a fast-paced basketball game.

That’s how I first found out about the law, years ago. I told the gas station attendant I wanted air but didn’t have quarters (intending to communicate that I wanted change), and he told me that it was free at any gas station in California."
PoliticalScience,fdfcgw8,t1_fdf84po,1578358433.0,"> I’m opposing celebrities lecturing on politics (a very common occurence) and you're talking about who they lecture on?

Could you define “lecturing on politics”? Your position seems to have shifted in this thread.

As a recap, you said, “I wholeheartedly agree that celebrities drawing attention to climate change is fantastic.” That is a political issue. 

You then said you “draw the line” at telling their fans who to vote for. I asked why it would be fantastic for a celebrity to draw attention to climate change, but inappropriate to advocate for a candidate whose climate change platform is superior to their opponent’s. You then “corrected” me to say “anyone” should advocate for the candidate with the better position on a dire issue (i.e. climate change). I agree with that (though I had limited my first comment to celebrities because that’s the topic under discussion), which explains the comment you’ve quoted above. What does that comment have to do with the difference between what one should do and what one does?

It sounded like you were saying celebrities should not advocate for a candidate who will improve a dire situation, but I guess we agree that they should do so.

Sure, some celebrities might have less-than-expert understanding of an issue, although for all you know they might have deep expertise. They’re still entitled to give their opinion and any factual support they have for it; in fact, I would argue that doing so is the ethical choice.

The public should seek out credible information sources. But Gervais’ commentary was (ostensibly) directed at celebrities, not the public, as was OP’s question. That’s what I’m responding to."
PoliticalScience,fdewhlb,t1_fdeomnm,1578348049.0,"Let’s agree that celebrities drawing attention to climate change is fantastic. Now let’s suppose that one candidate advocates policies that will alleviate climate change, and the other candidate advocates policies that will worsen climate change.

Wouldn’t it follow that celebrities should advocate for the candidate who will improve a dire situation?

(Whether it’s true that one candidate is worse than the other when it comes to climate change might be outside the scope of this sub, but I think it’s demonstrably true.)"
PoliticalScience,fdevkp9,t1_fdejli1,1578347505.0,"It’s presumably meant to be “funny but true,” but really isn’t either one. Actors _act_, which is different from lying, and no evidence was given that any of the political statements made by celebrities are lies. Furthermore, there’s a world of difference between saying “this political issue is very important” and saying “vote for me to solve this issue”; the Golden Globe attendees are making political statements, but they are not trying to become politicians.

And perhaps most importantly, it doesn’t answer OP’s question."
PoliticalScience,fdeundw,t1_fdencfr,1578346957.0,"It’s an interesting thought experiment to wonder what would have happened if a celebrity from a more “liberal” genre had said the opposite — if Incubus had said, “We love George Bush and his policies.”

I imagine there would have been backlash, but they probably wouldn’t have been booted off most radio stations the way the Dixie Chicks were. 

But if, today, they said they loved Trump? There probably would be calls for them to be “canceled.”

In addition to genre, I think that has to do with both the times and the man. Ellen DeGeneres faces some criticism, but little in the way of “consequences,” for recently palling around with Bush."
PoliticalScience,fdejhec,t1_fde0mtx,1578340338.0,"I think Gervais made two arguments. Both seem convincing at first, but ultimately I disagree.

You’ve highlighted one: Actors generally have no more expertise than the average person, so their opinion shouldn’t carry any more weight than the average person’s. That’s true, but if the issues are important — the actors think they are — then it’s the responsibility of everyone, including the average person and the activist actor, to do what they can to solve the issue. Celebrities have a bigger platform than others, so we hear more from them, but that doesn’t mean the celebrities shouldn’t express their opinions. 

If every celebrity just said “thanks for the award” and then sat down, people would be just as (un)likely to study a PhD holder’s YouTube video as before. The public should do additional research, but if a celebrity speech is what gets them to look into the causes of the fires in Australia, then great."
