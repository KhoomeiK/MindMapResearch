palletfurniture,feci3or,t3_eo9s7y,1578974455.0,"I usually joint and plane my pieces, but i like to made sure that I cut my pieces to the rough length I need before hand so if the boards are really warped (which they usually Are) I don't have to take off as much material to get it flat."

woodworking,fdepxo3,t1_fdei98p,1578344162.0,"Yeah I have a video on my channel , its mostly just drilling different sized holes, here is a link https://youtu.be/3FszeFRagZo"
woodworking,fdepfeu,t1_fdem8kk,1578343864.0,"Thank, its not really a budget thing I choose to just use wrenches because they would have more leverage then the wheel handles usually on these type of vises. I also wanted the handles to be removable so they were not in the way when the vise was in use so instead of welding them on I drilled and tapped a hole in the wrenches to hold a small bolt I can tighten when its on the nut"

woodworking,fcc6725,t1_fcc3c3t,1577594866.0,"Thanks, it is kinda hard to say for sure how long it took because this was a project I did in the background while working on others over the past 3 months but a good estimate would be about 30 hours.

Also, yes, resawing was the worst part"
