AmItheAsshole,fdsfame,t1_fdri2cr,1578701425.0,"There is a difference between trying to get pregnant, and succeeding, and then asking for a paternity test.

And between half assedly protecting themselves and accidently getting pregnant, and then asking for a paternity test.

But using double protection, doing the best not to get pregnant, and then asking for a test is accusing of cheating??? That's straight up what any man should do. Wtf is this subreddit."
AmItheAsshole,fdseoye,t1_fdqf6f1,1578700994.0,I guess the other guy who fucked her was also wearing a condom like the bf? Great logic
AmItheAsshole,fdsecp6,t1_fdqs7s0,1578700756.0,"What a fucking joke, nobody was accusing her of that, the best most unsuspecting people turn out to be cheaters, guy is protecting himself, imagine calling a guy an asshole for getting a patternity test, disgusting, on top of that defending this girl who is calling all men the same over 1 guy, and dumping her bf over this, this is just disturbing."

How hard can it be to look from his perspective? Condoms are 99%, and then its bc on top of that, anyone with a brain would get a paternity test."

You never talked to him in private about how the joke hurts you. I know everyone here will say NTA, but in a real world, if he was unaware that he was doing something bad, and you potentially ruined his life over that on Christmas, you need a reality check if you even need to ask if you're TA."

Him not being attracted to something doesn't make him a bad person, realistically most of men won't date a girl with armpit hair, some men might even be into that but its very rare, don't be surprised if he ends it... Sure ""your body your choice"", you can do whatever you want but its him who has to have sex with you."
