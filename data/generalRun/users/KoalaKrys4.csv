stevenuniverse,ff3u7a2,t1_ff3s615,1579548944.0,"No, I'm saying that she tried to be good despite her bad influences. I re-read that section and I definitely worded it wrong...and IDK how to word it better so yeaaaa.

Rose's mistakes are not the diamond's fault. Rose's mistakes are her own. She thought she was doing a good thing but it wasn't. She had to realize what was good and bad for herself after being raised to think that all of these bad things are okay.

I didn't say Rose is good because there are worse people.

I said everyone is flawed in this show. literally everyone. And I still love most of them because in the end they tried to get better.

I'm also saying that you can't condemn one person to being evil while marking everyone else off as good when they made similar mistakes.

For example, Peridot (AKA my fav character <3) did some pretty messed up things. She tried to become better, but almost relapsed back into those bad things when she contacted yellow diamond. Thankfully, she got over it and now she's an adorable little green bean.

Now take Pink Diamond. (I like her but she isn't my favorite) She did a lot of messed up things. She tried to become better, but relapsed into some of those bad things. After the war was over, she still did something bad (Keeping lapis trapped) but that was a unanimous decision between her, Garnet, and Pearl, so it's not all on her. She tried her hardest to get better and she did. She was seen as a good person throughout her time of living peacefully on Earth. She only started to look like a horrible being when her past was dug up.

Why did both these characters do bad things, relapse into old thinking, get over it, and become better people, but only one of them is hated?  That's my point. If you're gonna use PD as a punching bag you better be prepared to hit most of the other Steven Universe characters. Which is why I don't want to hate on Pink Diamond. This plus my other reasoning is why I don't think she's so bad.

I'm not excusing her actions, I'm explaining her actions and excusing her as a gem."

Or maybe slightly transparent and can trap things inside her, like real amber? like orange-red semi transparent and make trees and plants and other stuff trapped inside her? idk what you want the form to look like, this is just a suggestion. 

What would be the amber's powers? any weapons? and what's her role on homeworld? would she be an elite gem, a solider gem or something like that? I'd say she'd be a terraforming gem if I were you, but idk. Those aspects might help you with the corruption design."
stevenuniverse,ff3r236,t3_erf1t7,1579547010.0,"I kinda agree, but Steven was being a bit clueless. It doesn't seem like Connie was upset selfishly. It seems like she was upset because Steven gave up so easily, and didn't even try to fight like Steven said they could, together. Steven didn't understand, he thought he was doing her a huge favor, when all he did was prove to her that there was no way out of a bad situation, even if they worked together. I don't think Connie was in the wrong, and neither was Steven. They were both clueless to each other's feelings. I don't think Connie should have blamed steven though. I get why she was upset, but to blame steven when his only thought was protecting HER? really connie?"
stevenuniverse,ff3pz1f,t3_erf4nq,1579546347.0,"I still like Pink Diamond to be honest. She did some sucky things, but even throughout that, it wasn't intentional. She really was trying to become a better person, she just didn't know how. I won't bring up her abuse, but I will bring up her bad role models. After being raised to think that she's better than other gems, nobody else matters, and other things like that, I applaud her for trying to rise up to become a better person, even if she wasn't entirely sure what was okay and what wasn't okay. She realized she wasn't acting right, and tried to fix it, but nobody taught her how to improve herself, and how to actually fix her bad behavior, so she did those bad things, although with good intentions. She made the ""best"" of what she could and I like that. I'm not excusing her bad behavior,  because she did ruin a lot of lives. But out of the diamonds, she was the kindest one and the fact that she wanted to be a good person is enough evidence that she isn't a jerk like everyone says she is. I think people should stop using Pink Diamond as a punching bag and instead remember that literally everyone in that show has flaws. I don't understand why people are calling her evil but then leaving Blue, Yellow, and White alone when they were the ones who raised her to make all those horrible decisions, shattered thousands of gems, and taught her that they were above everyone else. That gems were easily replaceable, and individual gems didn't matter. Or remembering that Spinel tried to destroy the earth, Sapphire was helping Blue Diamond end the rebellion, Lapis used to destroy planets and create kindergartens, and Peridot was aiding in the creation of the cluster, AND experimenting with shattered gems and forcing them to fuse. Everyone in that show has flaws, yet we don't call them horrible people. I still like almost everyone in that show, including Pink Diamond, despite their bad decisions."

She abandoned all of her desires to serve Pink Diamond, then finds out she got abandoned for 6,000 years in a garden after being lied to and realizing that her so called ""best friend"" who she did everything for abandoned her for a bunch of strangers. She didn't know what to do other than to act badly. Pink Diamond was abused, so she abused spinel, who in turn abused everyone else. It's a cycle and it wasn't her fault. She didn't know how else to let out her betrayal when the only person she interacted with used to throw childish tantrums. She didn't know how else to let out her depression when her only role model had no idea to let out hers.  Of course, I don't think pink is the bad guy. After all, she was treated with abuse and just tried to do the best she could, but that doesn't mean you have to hate on spinel for making pink diamond look more ""evil""."

stevenuniverse,ff3kdi6,t1_ff3jyfb,1579542905.0,"But that's the entire point of my theory. PD could come back because Steven was hit with the rejuvinator, which would reset Pink Steven back to the origional form. Since the gem went through all previous forms, that would be Pink Diamond.

It was never stated that a gem couldn't contain more consciences either lol"
stevenuniverse,ff3jvyi,t1_ff3j853,1579542608.0,"That's a good point. 

It's either that this show follows original cartoon logic (People can fall off a bridge or go through something life-threatening or damaging and still survive)

Or they just slowed down time, making them appear super fast. Which I kind of don't believe, because the reason all that was happening was because Smokey Quartz tapped into Steven's diamond power, which only visually affected Smokey Quartz. Plus, the dialogue hints to the fact that Smokey Quartz was super speeding, not messing with time.

This is a cartoon show about gem aliens who have powers and colonize different planets, lol. I doubt real world logic would affect this."
stevenuniverse,ff3j2yo,t1_ff3hchj,1579542118.0,"A gem isn't a vital organ though. It's literally their entire body. Gems hold everything mental about a gem.

The only thing he needed PD's gem for was to support his physical form. He was the same person without his gem, just ya know, about to die without it. 
Rose doesn't have vital organs. Her only organ is her gem, which is still intact, and only holds her mental qualities.So who's to say her mental aspects aren't still in there? 
I'm sorry I'm horrible at explaining things gosh. Okay
If The gem holds mental stuff
and steven only needs the physical stuff, but whenever he taps into the gem it's always connected to Rose, it means the gem still holds her mental things."

stevenuniverse,ff3gkmq,t1_ff2c5af,1579540597.0,"> This has nothing do to with conscious, every gem goes through her past form when reforming. 

Yes, but if Pink isn't there anymore, it's no longer HER gem. So why would the gem keep her past form, not to mention memories? It would have gone straight to Pink Steven because those forms were never his. I think the writers included the first two forms for a reason.

&#x200B;

> She's dead, period. 

Maybe, maybe not. Never been confirmed.

&#x200B;

>And this is based on what?

Based on Spinel using the rejuvinator on Steven. IF Pink Diamond is still in there according to my first two theories, then she technically never got her final piece. Only Steven did. Which means since Pink Steven is the gem without Steven actually owning it, if Pink Diamond was still in there, Pink Steven would be gone and Pink Diamond would be back, since the rejuvinator turns a gem back to her first form.  

Of course I could be completely wrong, but that's why this is just a theory."

The only way for him to be corrupted would be if the other diamonds did it. There is a theory that steven can make his own small diamond blast and corrupt himself, but I don't really believe that. Corruption affects the body and mind, and I think

Pink can affect mental state,

Blue can affect emotions,

Yellow can affect physical traits,

and White ties it all together

and different mixes of diamonds = different kinds of corruption.

WAIT. If pink can affect mental state....Steven having mental breakdowns... Well frick. Maybe he can corrupt himself, but I doubt he can turn into wormy boi unless Yellow had something to do with it."

If you're doing this to be considerate of her feelings, (Which is very kind of you) then why don't you ask her how she would feel about you going solo for half the trip? Of course you shouldn't have to do whatever she wants for the entire Disney World trip, but I dunno, maybe you can compromise? 

INFO: How does her autism effect her? Just curious."
AmItheAsshole,fdzy19o,t1_fdzjjk5,1578798588.0,Okay well try telling a five year old the process of how the bacon on their plate is made and see how they process that.
AmItheAsshole,fdzxn7a,t3_engcqz,1578798301.0,"ESH, but mostly you. You have a right to hunt for your own food, but to butcher it out in the open? Watch a little kid come out and get traumatized because you're literally skinning an animal out in the open... Couldn't you have done it in your backyard, or somewhere else where it wouldn't disturb anyone? You could have even put up a tarp to shield your work. Some people are extremely sensitive to these kind of things and you doing that right smack in the middle of your driveway was inconsiderate.

However, the woman who called the cops handled the situation very immaturely. She shouldn't have berated you for hunting, as you're doing it for a good reason. The way you are describing her shows her to only be harassing you based on her own moral values, saying that you're a terrible person for hunting. That was a horrible reason to waste the police's time. Not only that, but she's very clearly a hypocrite.

Basically, you both sucked in this situation."
AmItheAsshole,fdzw846,t1_fdzvkgf,1578797286.0,"Ah, okay. I hope she learned the consequences of that and will become more mature."
AmItheAsshole,fdzvwqo,t3_en622s,1578797060.0,"YTA. What did you expect, for your daughter to *thank* you for traumatizing your granddaughter by basically telling her that you STALK her through dogs?! The Elf on the Shelf are INANIMATE objects that do not have the ability to bark, lick, or touch her without her touching them first. You likely planted a fear of dogs in this child and I think you should apologize to her and tell her the truth, before she starts running/crying every time she sees a puppy."

unpopularopinion,fdyivui,t3_enbhag,1578780237.0,"I agree! I love soda as it is, but I also like them when after a while, the gas has gone out just a little. It's kinda like drinking juice, but with a distinct taste to it. Glad I'm not alone. However I would never get the gas out before I drink soda, because I like bubbly and a little flat equally."

AskReddit,fdyfl5m,t1_fdwgny8,1578779247.0,"Depends on the situation. ""If you love them let them go"" is more of you want the person you love to be happy, regardless of keeping contact with you. Sometimes letting them go IS fighting for them. You're fighting for their well being."

Although people keep using that phrase as an excuse. It's an explanation, not a justification."
