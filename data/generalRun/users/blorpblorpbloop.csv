Trump's deficit addition, in 4 years, will be 5.08 Trillion according to the white house's own numbers:

[https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/budget-fy2020.pdf](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/budget-fy2020.pdf)

Obama's ***total*** ***in*** ***8 years*** was $8.588 Trillion and that *includes battling the largest economic recession since the great depression.*

What does Trump's rate exceeding that do?  In his bottomless idiocy, it gives away a Trillion dollars to the rich *at the all time high booming stock market*.

Another fun one is that his *welfare-for-farmers-I've-fucked-over* plan.  That one **doubled** the total cost of the great recession auto-bailout.  And, to wit, most of the auto bailout funds were paid back. What do you think we're gonna get for ""pay-to-not-grow"" dollars?  Oh, and his Ag department made up the justification for it.  No congressional approval apparently, despite a constitution saying otherwise. 

When we actually do hit a recession and need that money his idiocy will certainly go down as the biggest fiscal policy fuckup of the last 20 years, maybe exceeding the mid-east boondoggle of his previous republican predecessor.  That said I'm sure it will be buried among a torrent of other fuckups.

todayilearned,fffmect,t1_fff44xo,1579887087.0,"Reminds me of [Cliff Young](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cliff_Young_(athlete)) who won the first Sydney to Melbourne Ultramarathon (at age 61) and beat the previous record *by 2 days*:

>Young showed up to compete in overalls and work boots, without his dentures (later claiming they rattled when he ran).  He ran at a slow, loping pace, and trailed the pack by a large margin at the end of the first day. While the other competitors stopped to sleep for six hours, however, Young kept running. He ran continuously for five days, taking the lead during the first night and eventually winning by ten hours. Before running the race, he had told the press that he had previously run for two to three days straight rounding up sheep in gumboots. He claimed afterwards that during the race, he imagined that he was running after sheep, trying to outrun a storm. The Westfield run took him five days, 15 hours and four minutes, almost two days faster than the previous record for any run between Sydney and Melbourne, at an average speed of 6.5 kilometres per hour (4.0 mph). All six competitors who finished the race broke the old record. Upon being awarded the prize of A$10,000 (equivalent to $32,067 in 2018), Young said he did not know that there was a prize, and that he felt bad accepting it as each of the other five runners who finished had worked as hard as he did—so he split the money equally between them, keeping none.
