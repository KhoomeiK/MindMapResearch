BlackPeopleTwitter,ffz2qez,t1_ffyvptv,1580362044.0,"Lived in Dundalk when I was little (barely remember it apart from visiting family) and moved to the surrounding area for college, but haven’t lived in the city. Half the people I know still think I’m going to get shot if I step foot on Pratt street of all places. Went to dinner at like 10pm in little Italy the other night and my girlfriend’s mom was horrified when we told her. People are weird about Baltimore"

cringepics,ffxio6i,t1_ffxikhk,1580325916.0,"Right but being Levantine doesn’t make you black, hence me “relying” on the 1%. I’m white as hell even though my dad’s side is Lebanese immigrants"
cringepics,ffx6s43,t1_ffw0kth,1580318941.0,Are you telling me that neither my 1% “sub Saharan African” nor 15% Levantine doesn’t make me black by default? Outrage
Justrolledintotheshop,ffx68o1,t3_evoagq,1580318618.0,I’d expect him to know just based on how popular hoovie’s garage is with car guys that age
worldnews,ffwm7xy,t1_ffwhipl,1580305310.0,"But people have such a hard time believing that the same types of deals exist in the west with nsa or even gchq. Couldn’t happen here, just over there with those corrupt chinese"

E32,ffteimj,t3_eury79,1580218218.0,I’ve got my 94 740il sitting around neglected with a whole slew of problems. Probably my favorite car I’ve ever had. Only real close second is my current (also neglected and not running) 98 750il. Something about those e32s though. Whole car is a work of art
zelda,ffi3g3t,t1_ffhxxlu,1579963967.0,I still don’t get why this was so widespread

blackpeoplegifs,fff1oac,t1_ffd36gl,1579873255.0,"I have a client that’s a retired navy seal and I met a munch hit old buddies that are still active on the teams. I swear to god a few of them could fit my entire hand in the tiny part of their palm and I’m a grown dude.   

This has nothing to do with the guys in the gif but it blows my mind how generally huge people can be when their absolutely jacked. I mean his fucking *hands*. And they felt like rocks"
MrRobot,fferd9o,t3_et88ch,1579861742.0,I absolutely love this and it is now my undeniable truth
MrRobot,ffer18v,t1_fc6bns6,1579861249.0,What I think he meant was it’s not “looks nothing like you” but “is nothing like you”
offbeat,ffeqlve,t3_esytd2,1579860620.0,"Apparently everyone in this thread but me commonly cashes 5+ digit checks, wtf. Even if you have a ton of money, why checks?"
2007scape,ffbuqi1,t1_ffbey56,1579783422.0,"Right, I meant building on top of runelite’s gpu mode. I’m not familiar with runelite or RuneScape’s graphics implementations but I meant more along the lines of smoothing a vertex shader, similar to animation smoothing, rather than say an hd water shader.  

Just asked about the textures because we’ve seen others get threaded in the past for using the jagex-owned ones. Looking forward to the public repo stages so I can help contribute"
BlackPeopleTwitter,ffb9w2y,t1_ffau1ab,1579756650.0,"What do you expect from the training? They made their policies as a company clear to the employees. You’re not going to be able to convince a shithead employee not to be a shithead, whether they’re racist or prejudice against homeless people or homophobic etc.  

They can (should) be reprimanded for bringing their asinine ideals to work though, and because of the training there’s explicit precedent for what isn’t acceptable. Not much more “training” is going to do so I’m not sure what spending more than a day on it would accomplish"
2007scape,ffb8f0y,t3_eskdim,1579754904.0,"This would just be tweaks to existing shaders, animations, particle effects etc right? Not an attempt to recreate/reuse the original rs2 hd textures?"
admincraft,ffaozks,t3_esl38f,1579741102.0,"I did a quick search and didn’t come up with anything (guessing you did too?). Are you looking  for a custom plugin to be made or just hoping someone already knows about one?  

If you want something custom: plenty of people, including me, make custom plugins. But they tend to be more expensive than people expect IMO so many people immediately turn away when they realize it won’t be $20"
Cplusplus,ffaolx1,t1_ffaofp0,1579740850.0,"I probably came off as more of an asshole about it than I meant to but if you can write your code using std data structures and functions in cpp you can do it in java. They’re very similar languages, especially to a beginner. I’d argue java is easier but c++ is more important to understand"
Cplusplus,ffaoan4,t3_esj2re,1579740635.0,">Besides glut and Eigen it’s just basic stuff that comes with code blocks  

Those are both huge, massive, libraries. But if you really mean “just the other stuff” then rewrite it. C++ to java is really not going to be a challenge unless you’re dealing with bytes then you have to think a _little_ bit due to Java’s signed bytes.  

I’d focus more on general knowledge of programming since you said “comes with code blocks” as if code blocks is the source of the language"

UMBC,ff86byr,t3_es6f3d,1579667223.0,I dislike this just because you said TG instead of dhall. That’s some narc shit
tifu,ff6wj2b,t1_ff6wehf,1579636342.0,I was told it was more similar to 'fuck' in a broad sense. I would sprinkle it in to comments in code every once in a while to see if he was paying attention lol
