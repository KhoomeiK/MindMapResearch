From that point on, every time I wanted to smash something expensive I would stop and think about all the hours I had to work to buy it."
aww,fcnmdug,t1_fcn362n,1577814242.0,"Yeah but chopping wasn’t the *only* thing I did. Slicing, mincing, peeling, (I worked in kitchens my entire Highschool and college career and I STILL cut myself peeling potatoes to this day) ecs. Psychologically it’s very comforting knowing I wouldn’t hurt myself and it helped me out at first when my technique wasn’t very refined.

Nowadays, Ive mastered the proper technique and I don’t wear any protective gloves when cooking at home."
aww,fcmsnl7,t1_fcmp76m,1577790311.0,"You need 2 things. 

A honing rod and sharpening stones. 

Hone the edge of your blade, then remove any excess material on the stone. The process takes 10 minutes and will leave your knives sharp enough to shave with."
aww,fcmsh2b,t1_fcmqk30,1577790050.0,"It takes 10 minutes to run down to the nearest kitchen supply store and buy a knife-proof glove. Put a latex glove over it and you’re set. When I worked in kitchens as a teenager, I could whizz by my daily prep knowing I didn’t have to worry about chopping off the tips of my fingers."
gaming,fclys2x,t1_fclemka,1577759788.0,"For me it was competitive CoD. My rage peaked after BO2 and while I absolutely loved the game, it was seriously impacting my personality and I would walk away *fucking pissed* most days.

It’s been years now and I still play competitive shooters at a pretty high level, just not the infuriating garbage ones."
wholesomememes,fbxtfoi,t1_fbxqvpe,1577200039.0,"My parents were both raised on dirt floors. They came to Canada for a better life and tried to assimilate, but there came a point where they said “I was fine without it, they’ll be fine without it” it’s pretty common."
