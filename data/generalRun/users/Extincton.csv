Here’s a tip for everyone to prevent it. There is a vaccine at the vet to I guess make your cat immune to it. But once they have it there’s no cure. Get it. Especially if they go out."

PoliticalHumor,fd6orq3,t3_ejuf1p,1578193905.0,"He has a number of Pseudonyms. One look at the search for a Carolin Gallego. 
Here’s an excerpt from Wikipedia on such a name. 

A 1992 letter to New York Magazine signed by “Carolin Gallego” replied to an article by Julie Baumgold. The letter asserted that “as his secretary” she knew Trump to treat women with respect.[14] This letter resurfaced in a 2017 article in the Washingtonian which highlighted similarities between patterns of repetition in Trump's speech and the final line in the letter, which read “I do not believe any man in America gets more calls from women wanting to see him, meet him, or go out with him. The most beautiful women, the most successful women—all women love Donald Trump.” The Washingtonian was unable to find any record of a Carolin Gallego as secretary to Trump.[15]. 
In short, yes he wrote this. Yes he’s always been the same idiot everyone thought he was."
