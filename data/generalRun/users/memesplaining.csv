Drugs,fffi9ah,t1_ffes7j4,1579884542.0,"Awe frendo <3 thank you so much!

That means a lot to me. I have been struggling with feeling undesirable lately. I was feeling undateable and horrible because I still don't have a job, but I had a realization that I just need to really just stop wanting things. Realized that I could be content when I stopped trying to rush life landmarks that I'm not ready for yet.

If I want to make sure I am fully healthy before working again, I should. And if that means I can't have a girlfriend yet, so what? 

Going to the buddhist zen center has helped me a lot. At the least I think they have a good philosophy. Last week I was there and they were talking about the catch 22 of us all being there to better our lives, and enlightenment being about accepting each moment the way it is in the absence of striving for more, realizing what you have now is what is going on and to stop waiting for your life to ""really start.""

Anyway. Next move for me I think is to move to a new city where I can be in a single room and have a slower life. City life is too fast now that I don't work in the bar industry any more.

Thanks again friend for supporting me. Ya what I said in the post I really mean.  I didn't have the coping mechanisms to appreciate or handle life yet.  I had a good overall life, but one bad shift at the bar where I got yelled at by my manager on the busiest day of the year, and I decided to give up, say fuck it, and go smoke meth. 5 days later and I still hasn't slept, my brother checked me into a psychiatric hospital and I have been seeking recovery ever since. Relapsed once after being discharged from the first program into a shelter. But now I know even if that happens I won't do it. Literally nothing could make me relapse now. Took me way too long to get my sanity back this time. Meth is one fucked up drug. I was never long term addicted to it, only did about 4 week long binges in my life, each separated by like years. But each one wreaked havoc on my brain. I mostly needed to be sober from alcohol. 

Ok I'm just rambling now gotta go much <3"

Drugs,ffe4d4j,t1_ffd3p7i,1579836375.0,"Reality sucking is relative, I have found. 

I used meth while I had a well paying job and friends and a laptop and a room to myself and a life all because I thought life was too hard.

Then because of meth I lost my job and all my friends and got sober and now a year later I am still sober but still living in a drug program and my life is super small and I don't have a job yet or many friends or even the basic tools to be creative in my field (laptop), and I am in a bunk bed in a three person room so my life is objectively way worse than it was before I used the meth, but mentally life is so much better.

I go to therapy twice a week, I eat well, I quit cigarettes 4 months ago and feel healthier than ever, I hit the gym 2 times a week at mininum, I call my parents at least 3 times a week, I can see my confidence and ability to socialize improving every day. 

I am taking it slow. I will get a job and move out of this hellhole of a program soon. I will continue on. 

But this time I know that no matter how bad things seem drugs are not the answer. I KNOW rhat this time. 

Not as far as escaping life goes. I will not use alcohol or kratom or weed to escape life any more. And definitely not meth.

But I do plan to do psychedelics in the future. But only after I have earned the right to do them by getting myself stable in my own room. I believe in those drugs and know they can help me be stable in my life. 

But I was not using them responsibly before. I was mixing them with other drugs and not respecting them like I used to in college.

Anyway. Just saying my life is shitty and I got sober while it was shitty. I resorted to meth because my life hit a relative low that was no where near how low I would eventually get. 

But now I know no level of reality sucking is worth doing drugs.

Ayuhasca, lsd, dmt, and shrooms are all in my future but nothing else."

Everything I am learning in therapy...

I'm realizing I'm not the fucking problem society is!

I learned not to ruminate...san francisco ruminates on purpose as a fucking hobby. 

Learn it is my reaction that matters, not what happens to me, not to control my environment, but only myself...san francisco tries to help all liberals avoid ever having to actually speak up for themselves by literally trying to control the environment. Didn't let Milo on Berkeley Campus, shuts down and shuns people so liberals don't have to learn to respond to their environment

I'll tell you bro if I stay in San Francisco much longer I am going to have to become a super human, cause that is what sf trains their resident non liberals to be. 

If I want to speak my mind I have to learn to stand by my own word despite overwhelming criticism.

While the liberals who live here have zero training or skills in this field, non liberals are required to be absolute masters of it or keep their mouths shut

And now that I am sober and getting healthy I realize how inhibited the very culture is trying to force me to be. 

We only have two options: extreme inhibition (just never speaking up about politics), or extreme bravery (have to stand completely fucking alone in most settings)

I feel like going to an anti trump rally and holding up a trump 2020 sign just to see if someone will attack me and I can sue them

Drugs,feclfwa,t3_eo3uid,1578976820.0,"LSD told me to quit everything too, it was like I could clearly see the addiction pattern and how it fucked up the natural rhythm of my life.

I quit everything.  Ciggarettes, caffeine, meth, weed, alcohol, kratom. Even deleted all the games on my phone. One thing at a time though, this has been a process. I am a year in and almost done. All I feel the need to quit now is jacking off 2 times a day. I can tell it is still something I am using unhealthily.

But I plan to take acid again.

I want acid to be the last thing I take, to help heal from the meth. Don't want meth to be the last big drug I took. 

Acid told me to quit cigarettes and wait three months at least to earn another acid trip. I am now 6 months clean on cigs, 1 year clean off all other drugs.

Still being patient, need to wait till I have a better setting."
