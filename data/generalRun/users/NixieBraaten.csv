travel,ff9pvg0,t1_ff9paq5,1579718298.0,Thanks. We have fun. We went to see my Grandma in Iowa last time. She was back seat co-pilot and her dog seatbelt works really well. She has been noticeably more secure in the car since I got it.
travel,ff9p19s,t1_ff9off4,1579717689.0,I don't. I drive.
travel,ff9lag0,t3_esfcnl,1579715387.0,"It has its pros and cons. I treasure memories of traveling with my pets. It makes me feel like I'm enriching their lives by providing them with new, positive experiences.

It can be challenging when you need to go into a store or you would like to see something that doesn't allow pets to be with you. If you're traveling solo, it is very tricky. If you have a companion to watch the pet(s), you have to be confident in doing stuff separately from them and making haste so they can do what they need to as well.

I've always found it to be worth it as long as I am taking my pet sonewhere fun and relatively safe."

AskReddit,ff7nidl,t3_es3x84,1579653790.0,Cleanliness. It seems obvious but the number of guys that think it's okay to only wash occasionally and that body soap can be used in their hair is astonishing.... and really gross.
AskReddit,ff317bg,t1_ff30vqc,1579530949.0,"If you find out she's experiencing that sort of thing, via conversation or check ins, teach her how to handle that situation. I.e. don't play with certain people, find a different server, disable chat and go rogue. Teach to either turn the other cheeknor be a badass.
If she can't handle it, help her find games that lack direct communication but still have a multiplayer atmosphere, like pokemon."
AskReddit,ff30bwc,t3_erdrnh,1579530238.0,.... let them? Don't get them any games that you wouldn't get for your sons and maybe pop in every once and a while to make sure they're having fun without being obtrusive.

I don't know why though. I didn't want kids at all until December of 2010. I had a very sudden epiphany that I wanted to have kids and I haven't been able to shake it since."

Paranormal,fea30la,t1_fea0dao,1578943831.0,My aunt is spiritual and calm. I picked up things from her. :) Maybe trying some deep breaths next time you have an experience? Pace yourself unless you absolutely feel like you are in danger.

A family plot is possible but the Pioneer Cemetery was full before the city became more industrialized and they opened three new ones based on status not far from where I work. The historical society does tours every year that I've attended for the past two. She could very well be buried in one of those places."
