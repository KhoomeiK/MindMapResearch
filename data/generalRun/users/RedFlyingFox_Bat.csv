college,ff2ahao,t3_er72ir,1579498692.0,The tuition and people I met definitely made me depressed. I should have taken a break from school to begin with.
college,fepj0ip,t3_eqb5de,1579321744.0,I'm a gay Mexican female residing in the Midwest. I'll answer any questions if you still need more people.
antiMLM,fekyi81,t1_fekv9fe,1579210239.0,Sounds more like you need your own downline.
antiMLM,fdrk96i,t1_fdrhug4,1578685654.0,Thanks for the update! I hope they can get out of the situation sooner than later.
antiMLM,fdnpnfa,t3_elwk2s,1578590508.0,"So do most MLM's use this pitch, or does a particular one use this? Just because I was approached by a 21 yo at target who had the same pitch, but didn't get far with me because I was not interested in retiring by 23. Never got to hear what the ""wealthy couple"" taught her."
