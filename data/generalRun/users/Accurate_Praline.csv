Which is also a trope. Yeah, hormones and all that but it's just way too overblown. If your mood changes that drastically because of your cycle then see a doctor. It shouldn't be used to excuse asshole/bitchy behaviour.

You're probably able to just grab your own clothing before going to prison or have your family do it. No idea about that though.

It makes more sense to keep the prisoners in good enough mental shape so that they can reintegrate. Taking away their own clothes is taking away part of their identity.

Obviously people at risk of suicide will have restrictions.

As for escapees.. it's not that hard to change your outfit. Hell, someone in an orange prison suit might just be more dangerous because they want out of it and could see killing someone to steal their clothes as an option."
