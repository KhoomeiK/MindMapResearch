AmItheAsshole,ffdrxbz,t1_ffdqaii,1579827428.0,"His is looking for support, he says one of the reasons he’s upset is because she doesn’t reciprocate the praise he gives her... after two days. Did you read the post? Oh and where does he state that he is exclusively talking to himself, because if not than you are just assuming it. 

Also the baby isn’t tethered to the room, it’s possible for him to be other places to talk to people. Plus phones exist so he can talk to people without leaving the hospital."
AmItheAsshole,ffdoskn,t1_ffdnrlr,1579825431.0,"DUDE she can’t fucking handle supporting him atm, so she asked not to complain to her. And yes he was complaining to her because if not why would she have to ask him to keep the comments to himself? All he has to do is leave and find someone else to vent to, is that really that hard to do? 

She carried his child for months, just had major surgery and now she has to listen to him whine?  This bitch can’t catch a break to save her life"

I don’t think he shouldn’t complain or vent but definitely not to her. She is in a much worse situation and doesn’t need that/isn’t a position to offer support. I’m sure he has other friends and family that can offer more support that she can (at least for the time being)"

That’s why everyone is talking about/ has issue with how he was *low-key* complaining in front of the person who had major surgery two days ago because asking if he’s allowed to be frustrated is such a stupid question/non-issue."

And yea some bosses are fair but they aren’t reallythe ones that care if the employees talk.

AmItheAsshole,ffap7nn,t1_ffanboe,1579741251.0,"It is a taboo, a shitty one that employers want us to continue to not talk about because it makes them more money. 

In the post the other employees went to their managers to ask for an explanation, which they should.  They didn’t go to op and blame him, the only people who had a real problem with what op said was the bosses because they don’t want people asking for more money. 

Oh and if op decides they improved enough and deserves a better salary, they should negotiate it. If they don’t get it? Leave. They should take all their knowledge and expertise to another company, then use that to get a better deal. Cuz companies don’t want to train up someone new and they will pay for that knowledge and experience. I’ve always been told you should leave to a new company every 5-7 years because every time you leave you’re gunna get a significantly better deal then if you had stayed.

In the 10th grade I was put into a small school that had a focus on dual enrollment (meaning we also took classes at the community college). I was separated from all my friends and REALLY didn’t want to go but was told I could transfer after the first semester if it was truly as bad as I thought.
