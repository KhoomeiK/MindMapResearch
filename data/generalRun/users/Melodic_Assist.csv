femalefashionadvice,feivnt6,t3_ep46th,1579148466.0,"Hey all. I work in the beauty industry, and I need a good pair of shoes that are durable, comfortable, not ugly, and are preferably under $100. I can't wear danskos (forgive me if my spelling is wrong) or anything that looks like a tennis shoe because of the company's rules. They want us to look super fashionable and trendy. I've been wearing a pair of vans, but those don't go with my nice dresses, and the flats I own are absolute rubbish and I tend to walk out of them and twist my ankle in them frequently. I have a pair of docs, but again, those don't go with certain things. I'd appreciate any ideas that you guys have."

I've been trying to find a good therapist for awhile. It's been hard for me to find someone I connect with and who isn't judgemental with preconceived notions about my diagnosis. I'm hoping that this year I can find someone who will be helpful."
rapecounseling,fdpoxcf,t1_fdpokj7,1578635083.0,"Thank you <3 if you ever need to talk to someone, feel free to message me. Sometimes talking to random internet strangers is more helpful and easier than trying to talk to a friend."
bipolar,fdpou35,t3_emm9pq,1578634996.0,"I need to vent/ramble, so here we go. I'm in the midst of a really bad depressive episode. It's gone on for over a month, possibly longer. I feel so hopeless about my life. I feel like I'm never going to find a job where I will have affordable health insurance. Insurance is kind of necessary when you have a diagnosis like this. Medication is expensive. Therapy is expensive. I can either choose to pay for health insurance or choose to pay my rent, and rent is more important. I also feel like I'm never going to have a job where I can live comfortably. I'm probably always going to make just enough to pay my bills and have maybe $50 left over to do something with. All my friends maybe double or triple what I do and it makes me feel awful. It makes me feel like I'm not worth their time. So much value is placed on your income, and I'm just not enough. I'm worried about what I'm going to do when it comes time to buy a new car or take on any other additional expenses, because every dollar I bring home has an assignment. I literally cannot afford anything else. Trying to pay $200+ a month for a car can't happen because I don't make enough. This is all so stressful to me. I feel like it's never going to get any better. In all honesty, it probably won't because every year, shit just gets more expensive and I'm just going to get poorer. It makes me feel like life isn't worth living because I know this is something that I can't fix. Why bother anymore?"
rapecounseling,fdmexa2,t3_eitdpv,1578547649.0,"Oh, absolutely. I tend to idealize sexual interactions, but when I start to think about actually acting them out, I freak out and get scared. I've sent myself into many a panic attack by doing this. Many of my friends are male, and I've had times where they've gone to hug me to say goodbye or something and I've had a panic attack because of it. It's been about a year and a half since I was assaulted, and recently I had a panic attack because of a friend hugging me. It sucks.

In regards to what you should do: Ideally, you should find a new therapist who specializes in sexual trauma. Go into it knowing that this is the main thing you want to discuss and work on. It's easier said than done, and I know how hard it is to find a good therapist. I've been notoriously known for ghosting therapists because I don't feel comfortable opening up to them about my sexual trauma, so I move on to the next and hope that I'll feel more comfortable with someone new... I never do. It's hard to talk about this stuff to a complete stranger, face to face. It's hard to even talk to a friend about it. Hell, I struggle to talk to my boyfriend about it. We just have to keep moving forward, the best we can.

I can't tell you that it's going to get better and that someday all these problems will go away. As much as I wish I did, I don't have the answer for that. All we can do as survivors is try our best to keep going, keep working on ourselves, and remember that time will help the pain. Sending much love your way."
rapecounseling,fdmec0y,t3_ejnvas,1578547123.0,"Blacking out is terrifying as a sexual assault survivor. After the fact, you feel out of control and you think about all the things that could have possibly happened to you while you were ""gone"". You were safe and with friends who cared, but that doesn't negate the shitty feelings that you're having. You can drink and get drunk and not get to the point of blacking out. Make sure you drink a glass of water with every drink, and if you start to feel too out of control, eat something and take a break. This is something I struggle with, too. I know how you're feeling. At every party I go to, I get scared because I don't want to let myself get too far gone and let something happen to me again. If you ever need to talk, send me a message. Sending lots of love your way. You're strong, you'll get through this."
AskReddit,fdkgdci,t1_fdit1zf,1578503300.0,"My parents were the same way. Until I was 22, I had to ask if I could leave the house to go to Target or hang out with my friends. The times I'd go on dates, I'd have to tell an elaborate lie about what I was doing with a friend that they knew about. It was insane shit. I had to be home by a certain time. If I brought any alcohol into the house, my mother would freak out and start yelling. If I got a job more than 5 miles away (mind you, we lived in the country and any job worth having was 15+ miles away), they wouldn't let me take it and I was stuck waiting tables in a local restaurant for years. They wanted to keep me stuck under their roof forever."

WhitePeopleTwitter,fdfuo9n,t1_fdfcdo2,1578370680.0,"I had an IUD for a few months and I wish that it had worked out for me. I hear so many success stories about it, but mine wound up getting embedded in my uterus and I had to have minor surgery to get it removed. I was in the worst pain of my life by the time I got it taken out. I thought the daily pain was normal. Hormonal birth control is a BITCH. Makes my anxiety so bad that I can't function. I've been on nearly every pill there is, and nothing has been tolerable. It sucks. Being a woman sucks."

bipolar,fc5c7l1,t3_eg6qb2,1577452972.0,"I hate when people try to turn pain into a pissing contest. One of my coworkers asked me what's wrong and why I'm feeling down, and I didn't want to go into it - how do you explain to someone that you aren't close with that you're struggling just to stay afloat because of your mental illness? She started listing all these bad things that have happened in her life lately. Her grandpa died, her sister in law stole her (coworker) husband's social security number and ran his credit to the ground, that all her kids currently have the flu, her new car is having issues, etc, and then said ""does that make you feel any better?"". No. It doesn't. It makes me feel a million times worse because my problems aren't real. They're all in my head. They aren't real, tangible things. It makes me feel like a piece of shit knowing that all my problems are just with my brain."
