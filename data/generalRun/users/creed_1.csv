NCAAFBseries,ff62ap4,t1_ff58rrc,1579617330.0,Lol I only got 4 wins in my first season but that was after I made everyone a punter and cut them to only have walk ons. Virginia tech killed us week 1 69-6
college,fe6dn5t,t1_fe6cz49,1578887836.0,That's the worst. When you are in college I swear they try and nickel and dime you for every little thing
soccer,fe6dk2m,t1_fe5zd49,1578887768.0,That is very true. I even think that there may be some players that would still be rolling around the field as I type this acting like their life was chopped off
college,fe6cmi9,t3_envjls,1578887044.0,I hate access codes. Those are the worst. If you get lucky and get a class that doesn't need one then search the internet as much as you can to find the book for free. Like a PDF or something. It's not worth paying for the book of you are just gonna hide it away when the class is over
college,fcum3jw,t1_fctqo1t,1577983960.0,Only thing you'll gain is money to save up if you work. Plus who says you can't live it up while in college?
NCAAFBseries,fcu60zr,t3_eiv4j5,1577973413.0,Then your teammates starting trying to tackle you and it all went downhill
college,fcn6tco,t3_ei1qt5,1577804779.0,You can take them whenever but I think most people try to get them out of the way early so they don't have to worry about them when they are taking higher level courses
college,fcn6i08,t3_ehvewj,1577804546.0,I would just say how is any human supposed to only look straight down at an exam for two hours straight. Probably won't help at all but it's a valid point
college,fcn6axd,t3_ehsw3s,1577804406.0,My friends and I explored our campus on a huge party night for the school. Once we went all over called we went to a house party and it was mostly upperclassmen and they ended up locking us out on the back porch but they had most of their cases of beer there so we each grabbed one and took off running back to our dorm
NCAAFBseries,fcn5uin,t3_ehxfej,1577804062.0,"Every game from start to finish, every play. Everything. Unless I do a coordinator to hc dynasty thing"
college,fcn5ahz,t3_ehrtzg,1577803647.0,I met my current fiance when I was in college. We have twins as well. Both of us said first night we weren't looking for a one night stand. Only ironic thing I guess is we started talking on Tinder but weren't using it to get hookups and stuff
NCAAFBseries,fcktd3v,t1_fc96g7e,1577732764.0,GO DINGOS
NCAAFBseries,fckt8rj,t1_fc9n9oi,1577732688.0,Probably not on a console. Maybe if you take the save from a USB and put it in your computer. Then use ea db editor you can then change the schedule but that would be my only guess
NCAAFBseries,fckoway,t1_fckf15n,1577730014.0,Whose number #1? And did either you or Texas tech lose?
college,fckomey,t1_fckoj3j,1577729848.0,Well you know. There's gotta be someone that'll be your friend. Maybe I'll be your friend but I'm no where near Washington
NCAAFBseries,fck9o6t,t3_ehhhlh,1577720311.0,I hope you didn't run it lol
college,fck94vh,t3_ehmapz,1577719932.0,I would say it is a strange thing but it could be a mix of trying to get students used to being with people they don't know or just because it's cheaper to have a 2 person room than a single. I got lucky that I had a friend of mine that was going to the same college I did so we just roomed together
college,fck8i5g,t3_ehjah8,1577719486.0,I would say I never hated to admit it. I really missed school when I stayed in campus. Hanging out with my friends everyday was a blast compared to sitting at home doing nothing
NCAAFBseries,fck8g5g,t1_fck1rck,1577719446.0,Same here until I get on th next day to realize I lost every game I played
NCAAFBseries,fck8e2j,t1_fcjk3a0,1577719405.0,I mean you could.... Just not legally unless you parents give it to you
NCAAFBseries,fc5md80,t3_eg6w85,1577461395.0,Aye I'm at Notre Dame. Not bad. Not bad
PremierLeague,fbu3ikd,t1_fbu0ppb,1577106870.0,"This is a business. If a person in a business does something illegal, all aspects of the company get affected. From the shareholders to the consumers that use the businesses product. If you want to stop people from doing racist things then you can't just grab the ones doing it at the time. You need to make a point by hurting everyone so that people realize that it's not a joke and they don't have that "" I won't get caught"" mentality"
