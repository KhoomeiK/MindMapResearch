TwoXChromosomes,fflmzt5,t1_ffjzkfq,1580041623.0,"Accountability without judgement is the practice of holding people accountable for their actions, while understanding that labelling anyone's behavior prevents mutual understanding and growth. ""When you do X, it affects me in a specific negative way."" If someone repeatedly shows that they are unable or unwilling to do the work of listening and understanding, then the other person gets to make the choice to stop interacting with them (with children being the exception, which is why so many of us develop coping mechanisms which serve us well enough until we are adults and need to un-learn them)."

Landlord,ffdzspw,t1_ffdz24m,1579833029.0,"I live in a town where bed bugs are very common.  I would find another pest control company that can get rid of ALL of the bed bugs.  They are not a bug that you routinely spray for.  Either you have them or you don't.  There are tents that are made to kill bed bugs in furniture by exposing everything enclosed to very high heat.  They are expensive, but some places provide a tent for tenants and require that all furniture be treated for bed bugs before move-in."

Instead of assuming that your tenants are being unreasonable or overly fearful, just call the damn pest control guy about the bugs.  Just because you don't mind living with bed bugs doesn't mean that other people should have to.

Edit:  Also, some people have anxiety.  Even if your tenant is being unusually anxious about bugs, that's just part of their being human."

The trick is to engage in conversations with lots of people who seem interesting to you.  Don't rudely ghost anyone, but don't continue to have a long back-and-forth with someone who starts to bore you, either.

It's okay if the people you meet don't become your best friends!  It's still nice to make queer connections.  I like to meet people for an early dinner at a restaurant, or meet somewhere like a dog park to be able to do something physical and low-stakes."

Now, we are no longer getting divorced.  My wife and I have taken turns staying with my dad in order to clear our heads and give each other space.  My dad ultimately wants for our marriage to last, but he really wants what is best for us, no matter what we decide.

That is the kind of unwavering support that I'm talking about."

lesbianfashionadvice,fdvfoq6,t3_en3zyp,1578746953.0,"I just had a custom belt made for $50. I wanted a masculine belt that I could wear every day, with both high-waisted and with regular pants. I got to pick out the leather and the buckle, and I requested that the holes be punched close together. The woman who made it also brainstormed ways to have the keeper loop be highly adjustable without slipping off when the belt is hung up for storage. It is the best piece of clothing I have ever bought. It is so comfortable, exactly what I wanted, measured to fit me perfectly, and I never get the floppy belt end in my way anymore."
latebloomerlesbians,fdvbekh,t1_fdv64rj,1578745625.0,"I disagree with that poster. I dated only cisgender men before realizing that I was gay/queer when I was 23 years old. I am now married to a woman, 10 years later.  Do not worry about labels or let anyone tell you what to label yourself.

I also felt imposter syndrome when I started to date women. The best advice that I can give is to just pay attention to the individuals you're attracted to, try going on a date with them, which is just a hangout with the understanding that you are two strangers interested in getting to know each other better. There are no rules about how to get to know someone. Do what you feel comfortable with. Start as friends if that feels right. Just find people that make you feel happy, safe, and comfortable. Do not spend time with people who you cannot be honest with, because that will not lead to a healthy relationship."

AmItheAsshole,fdoi1um,t1_fdmesww,1578605566.0,I don't think that people are entitled to luxury lifestyles. I think that all people deserve to be very comfortable. K understand that that's not how the world works. No person has the right to look at someone else and decide what they are and are not worthy of having. Neurodiversity is real. Just because someone sucks doesn't mean that a person in a better financial situation knows what that person should and should not get to have.

AmItheAsshole,fdofoni,t1_fdmktam,1578604200.0,"What makes your POV inherently more right than OP's SIL's POV?

For the record, I do not personally agree with excessive spending or living in luxury. I just don't think it's for anyone else to decide what another person feels makes them comfortable. I also don't think that SIL sounds comfortable. I think that she probably is depressed or anxious and uses quick food choices and streaming services to cope on some level. No one is inherently more deserving of ""nice"" things than another person. Judging someone else for being bad with money doesn't do anything but assign shame instead of using compassion."

AmItheAsshole,fdm50yd,t1_fdm4u2o,1578539955.0,All I was commenting on was his statement about how SIL thinks that she deserves the same lifestyle as them.  And she does.  Because she's a person.  But I was not responding to OP's post; I was responding to OP's comment.
AmItheAsshole,fdm4sc4,t1_fdm44af,1578539789.0,"Right.  I think our only disagreement is how we each define ""deserve."""
AmItheAsshole,fdm4p3s,t1_fdm419l,1578539725.0,Overspending is a common human flaw.  Of course better money management could help a lot of people raise their standard of living.  There are so many hurdles for individuals to overcome on their journey to physical and mental health.  Judging a complete stranger and saying that they only deserve the bare minimum unless they make the same spending compromises that you would make seems very out of touch with the diversity of human experience.
AmItheAsshole,fdm3upi,t1_fdm1ri5,1578539159.0,"If people could just make decisions favorable to their own financial mobility, why are there so many people who are both poor and hard-working?  Do extremely neurodivergent people deserve to suffer if there are not jobs available that suit their different skill sets?

The world is unfair.  The universe does not just hand out a reward equal to the amount of energy one puts out.  Humans are vulnerable beings with a myriad of complexities within that we are learning more about every day.  You don't have to like the description of OP's SIL to know that she is a human who is obviously suffering.  Whether or not she is annoying and rude has nothing to do with the fact that she is a person, and that your ability to make enough money to live in your society does not give you x-ray vision into someone else's cognitive processing or life experiences."
AmItheAsshole,fdm39nc,t1_fdm27yw,1578538774.0,Right.  But the amount of money that someone has is not the great determiner of whether or not they are inherently worthy of the the comfort and safety that money can buy.
AmItheAsshole,fdm35ln,t1_fdm2g9e,1578538698.0,"I do not think it is OP's responsibility to raise her standard of living.  I would not give my money to someone who did not seem good at budgeting what they had.

But I also wouldn't judge them for their situation.  I was just pointing out that everyone has a right to comfort.  It is a basic principle of a compassionate worldview to believe that everyone inherently deserves a good life.  No one has the right to decide for anyone else what they ought to do in order to deserve basic human comforts.  To believe otherwise gets into eugenics territory."
