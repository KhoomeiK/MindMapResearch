IDontWorkHereLady,ff09vfy,t3_eqy3vx,1579466723.0,The tow company I used to work for in Maryland had the same number as a Kaiser Permanente office in California. The only difference was our number had an area code of 301 and theirs had an area code of 310. People called us all the time on accident. We would tell them the mix up and most wouldn't call back. For the people who refused to believe they had dialed wrong and then get angry with us we would set up appointments. Always for 10am on Thursday. Eventually KP called us upset about the appointment fiasco when they had multiple people show up with no record of their appointment. I think they changed their number because we got a lot less calls from patients after that.

We don't have magic trucks that hover over the snow and ice. That and the fact that a lot of companies and drivers aren't comfortable putting their trucks at risk in bad road conditions so they shut down operations. That puts less drivers out trying to service high volume. We also tend to service customers in order of most dangerous to least dangerous situations. That means if you are at home and your car won't start you could be waiting a while as we are helping stranded motorists on the roadways first.

Hope this helps you understand the wait a little better.

They were so worried about weed being a gateway drug that they missed the benefits of legalization. Subsidizing farms to grow weed so that they don't have to pay them not to grow crops. Tax revenue from both the sale and the cultivation of marijuana. So many positives and very few negatives but they just couldn't see it. It is less harmful than both alcohol and cigarettes."
