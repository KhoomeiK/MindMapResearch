KingOfTheHill,ffdrbx4,t3_eswhr6,1579827029.0,I didn't know his channel was still active! This is how I will prefer to get impeachment updates from now on. Thank you.
AmItheAsshole,ffdb7sb,t1_ffdaeik,1579817127.0,"Yeah, it was pretty much the same except she iced the bully out at the end."
AmItheAsshole,ff4taa7,t1_ff3zmgh,1579571921.0,"There was a similar AITA post today about a sister being mad because the ex-bride didn't want her sister using her dress a few months later. What is wrong with people?? If they were in your situation, would they be so calm about you taking their wedding plans and ideas? They 100% would not be. You are in NTA in any way. Do what is best for you emotionally. If your family can't handle that then they clearly don't have your best interest in mind. I'm sorry you are going through such a rough time."
AskReddit,ff41si1,t1_ff2r534,1579553679.0,That happened with an ex of mine. It ended up being the reason we didn't last. I was relying on him to pull me out of my spirals and I didn't realize how much it was affecting him until it was too late to do anything about it.
trashy,fexofwp,t3_eqt5sj,1579434031.0,They're little heart melters. I hope you can find homes for them all.
AmItheAsshole,fewbqz7,t1_fewbgfs,1579408061.0,"He completely ignored his wife's wishes and made her uncomfortable in one of the most vulnerable situations she'll ever be in just to make himself and his mother happy. It's completely relevant to the situation.

Edit: I'd like to add I never said he was a bad person. Good people can have the best intentions and still be inconsiderate. It doesn't mean he doesn't love her, but he should recognize why it is OP feels this way and try his best to not do it again."
AmItheAsshole,few97i4,t1_fev27ht,1579407030.0,"He sounds like my dad. He doesn't respect anyone's feelings but his own, unless it comes to his mother, and then he'll get angry at anyone who calls him out on his behavior. It's never his fault that he upset you, it's your fault for getting upset at him. OP's husband is behaving like more of a child than their newborn"
ChoosingBeggars,fen0hn3,t1_fems2mo,1579274213.0,"That's so fucked. I remember seeing an article where an animal rights group stole a homeless man's dog for that reason, and another where they stole a puppy from a child and had it euthanized. I don't know how they twist it so that it's better for an animal to die than to be cared for. I can almost see their reasoning if a dog is being neglected but still, it's wrong. Plus they're just hurting their own cause by acting like idiots."
MurderedByWords,femoash,t1_femkn7z,1579264551.0,Would you mind explaining the tax write offs as well?
MurderedByWords,femk6zr,t1_femjmwk,1579259723.0,"There is no need to be rude. I said the line you quoted because the redditor above said ""they don't expect people to donate"", and it's almost like donations are how charities thrive. I never said the money doesn't help anybody. The point I am making is that most of the companies running these charities have the means to donate in ways that will have a bigger impact on the people they are intending to help. I see your point about the majority of people not going out of the way to donate otherwise. While there are more impactful ways to help not everyone has the time, energy, or resources. It isn't the consumer I'm finding fault with. Most people want to do whatever they can."
MurderedByWords,femjgzl,t1_femj2id,1579258716.0,"I actually just read about the myth of being bumped to the next tax bracket, it was pretty crazy that so many people are misinformed on the subject. I suppose the same can be said for tax write offs. There were hundreds of people on that thread who all seemed to be under the same impression. Would you mind explaining it then? I'm curious as to how it really works."
MurderedByWords,femj0ay,t1_femiv2t,1579258044.0,"I agree. I can't afford that place. I was thinking of places like Walmart who do the same thing while I was typing, I guess I should have worded better."
MurderedByWords,femixhv,t1_femikf7,1579257934.0,"...But they are expecting people to donate. That's the whole point. They can help others without begging for handouts, they have the means. If I still had the post I would link it but unfortunately I didn't save it. There was useful information on there, and it made it obvious that there are better ways for both the company to help and for people's donations to stretch further. I'm not by any means saying people shouldn't donate, giving to charity is very important."
MurderedByWords,femihe6,t1_femi5nm,1579257275.0,"That's what I remember reading, I'll look into it. Even so, there is still no reason they should expect people to donate for them when there is absolutely no reason they shouldn't be doing it themselves."
ChoosingBeggars,femic3h,t1_felozw9,1579257064.0,"I dunno why you got downvoted for that. This really isn't a choosy beggar at all, it's just someone whining. It would be choosy if she said something like ""I need you to cover more hours than you agreed to because one shift isn't good enough"" or something along those lines."
MurderedByWords,femhy99,t1_femgcs6,1579256494.0,"Someone posted awhile ago about the yearly Whole Foods fundraiser where they ask customers to donate food or money. They basically take millions in donations from customers, donate it for a giant tax write off, and pat themselves on the back. Why do they get credit for this at all? There's absolutely no reason Bezos should be relying on donations from average or struggling people when he's one of the richest people in the world. But now the world is watching so I guess he felt obligated to share some of the exorbitant amount of money he hoards.

Edit: I understand I may be mistaken on the finer points of how things work in regards to these charities. I did not save the post I am referring to, it was a mega thread over the holidays. It had some solid information but I unfortunately do not have it to share."
ChoosingBeggars,femh1gb,t1_femfem6,1579255114.0,"My dog is 13 now and I've never felt comfortable leaving him in the yard unattended. Some people are disgusting and view dogs as objects instead of companions, and they have no trouble just yanking pets from people's yards. I don't know what I'd do if I caught someone trying to pull that shit with my best friend."
ehlersdanlos,femgrjo,t3_epwla1,1579254709.0,"I've noticed the same. I use a cane everyday and people stare. I think it's because of my age, like ""why is that young girl using a cane?"" I still have a really hard time using my wheelchair for the same reason. I'm insecure about it to the point I rarely use it, but when I do stangers either blatantly stare OR very obviously avoid eye contact. My husband has to hold doors and pull me through at the same time, and a surprisingly small number of people ever think to hold the door to help. Eventually it'll get easier to ignore it and focus on yourself. Mobility aids are hard to get used to but they really do help. I hope it gets easier for you!"
AmItheAsshole,felrbym,t3_ept9u2,1579229040.0,"NTA. I almost said NAH until I saw the part about her wanting to take full custody. It made me cringe. Unless there's a valid reason for her and her jobless fiance to raise the child, then why is it okay for her to want to take this child for her own? Think about the heartbreak that world cause the biological mother. It's great that your friend wants to be a part of the child's life, but as you said she can do so as a step-mother. Her fiance and the child's mother are the ones who are going to have to set the boundaries, but there's nothing wrong with you expressing you opinion. Maybe try approaching the subject again when you're both relaxed and phrase it in a way that isn't as hurtful to her. It sounds like she's probably a good person but just a bit overeager."
