AskReddit,ff5bdvb,t3_erq426,1579586104.0,"When I was 16 I was a part of OCP (Off Campus Schooling) aka ""The school for Fuckups who fuckup"". There were only 5 or 6 of us in the school with other teens coming in and out when they were in trouble, but going back to regular school when their time was up.

Twice a week we had to have a group therapy session and for some reason the psychiatrist singled me out as ""the group leader"". She said this in one of our sessions in front of the others and they all immediately became aggressive and started saying they don't follow anyone etc.

After that the others avoided me which sucked because I really liked them all. After I graduated the program I was able to enroll in the regular high school. A few months of keeping a low profile go by and we get a new student from Hawaii. She is very pretty and word travels fast that she is a ""rocker chick"" who drinks booze, plays guitar and was sent to our town to live with her aunt because she got in legal trouble in Hawaii. 

One day I am eating lunch minding my own business when she sits right by me. I say ""Hello"" and she instantly ask if I'm Marcus. I say I am and she invites me to a party to get wasted. I ask why she wants me to come and she tells because her aunt told her to avoid me if I ever approached her at school. Her aunt turned out to be the damn psychologist.

AMA,ff4zapd,t1_ff4v6h3,1579576068.0,"In that case I wish you nothing but success or at least guiding revelation in your future adventures. Hate is such a strong word. You know when I was 11 years old a dog in my grandparents neighborhood attacked me and tried to maul me. My grandfather eventually came outside and fired a gun into the air and it ran away. 

I was so angered that it had attacked me that I didn't feel right for weeks. I didn't eat much or sleep either. All I keep seeing was that dog looming over me growling, barking and biting. 

One day I was outside swinging on a tree swing and I saw him eating grass a few houses away. He was so calm and relaxed. When I had been attacked it was dark outside and he looked absolutely monstrous, but in the early morning sun he was beautiful. I stopped swinging and watched him. As I watched my heart started to ""hurt"" and I use quotations because it wasn't pain as much as it was a ""heavy"" feeling. I knew in that moment that I was going to kill that dog. I didn't know how or when, but I knew I was going to do it.

I spent days planning on how I was going to do it. Where I was going to do it. If I would get rid of his body or just leave him where I killed him. As the days went on the weight in my chest became heavier every time I thought about the dog. One day I saw a commotion in the street and went on to find the dog twitching and bleeding on the road. 

Hit and run. There were adults and kids around watching it with various emotions. Confusion. Sadness. Anger. I walked right up to the dog and stared directly into his eye. He was panting/gurguling and he looked afraid? I don't know exactly, but his eye was looking around in a way that made me think he was wanting help. As I walked closer to him his legs began doing a running motion even faster than they had been, but he was on his side with intestines coming out of his anus and brain from a crack in his skull.

As I looked at him he slowed down before eventually stopping all movement. His eye lost all acknowledgement of the outside world and looked ""unfocused"". I began crying, sobbing really. I was so enraged. I punched the road and kept punching it until my hand hurt too much. My hand was torn and bleeding. I had been punching into a pool of the dog's blood so his was mixed with mine. 

A young man came to my side and told me it was going to be alright and if he wanted me to have him get my parents to let them know about our dog. It wasn't my dog so I ignored him and ran crying to my grandparents house. 

I went directly to the bathroom and poured rubbing alcohol on my hand. The pain was so bad that I felt angry. The anger was compounded with the anger I already felt because I wouldn't get to kill that dog. I bit myself on my damaged hand as hard as I could and began coughing when  some of the blood and alcohol got in my mouth.

That was so many years ago, but sometimes when I hear about children being abused I get that same weight in my chest. There is nothing in this world more pleasurable than cathartic release. I truly can not express in words the feeling of instant release.

Well one day he was sitting at lunch with actor John Travolta and they were discussing the idea of asking Tarantino to write a Pulp Fiction prequel that followed the many missions of hitmen Vincent Vega (John Travolta) and Jules Winnfield (Samuel L. Jackson). They both loved the idea, but when they approached Tarantino he hated it and shut them down immediately.
