I completely agree that if you cannot fit in the sit safety then you shouldn't fly. The issue here is more of why do we not address the the key issue of poor diet and lack of exercise.

We need to figure out how to live on this planet without causing harm. Solar power and wind turbines are wonderful at producing clean electricity, but our mining process to get the materials needed to produce said items is horrible. Clean energy should be the start that leads to further green initiatives. Weaning our selves off of fossil fuels alone wont fix everything."

pics,fd7zpg4,t3_ek85tw,1578212293.0,"I was deployed to Afghanistan in 2009. I worked in a surgical tent and saw the suffering of innocence first hand. War is not funny. I thought several times about killing myself when I got back but was lucky enough to have a family to fall back on.

Edit: I have recieved more comments than I thought this would garner so I will try to answer some of the questions about my time in Afghanistan. I was in the Air Force as a 4C which is a mental health technician. I volunteered my services at the Army Forward Surgical tent as I had a lot of free time. While there the vast majority of our patients were the local population either injured in the cross fire, or just injured from daily life kind of things. The breaking point for me was the two year old (or there abouts) male Afghani child that came in with severe head trauma due to our actions there. He died on our table and part of my job was to hold people together and be there for them to talk about this. We did a lot of good as the soul medical presence  in the area but we also saw a lot of people harmed for no reason. 

When I got back stateside I moved bases almost immediately and started to become symptomatic, I ended up hospitalized in a civilian psych ward where they prescribed anti psychotics. I was never psychotic but it kept me quiet so the military continued the medication while also setting up a medical eval for service. I was deemed not fit for duty and medically retired. They tried little in the way of rehabilitation and so I was thrown into the VA's woefully inadequate system. The VA put me on harsher and harsher antipsychotics until I was in a near vegative state at times. I was never psychotic. By the time I got to a competent Psychiatrist I already had cognitive issues. I now have pretty significant memory issues. 

I struggled with suicidal thoughts the whole time and until the last few years the only thing that kept me alive was my family. I am doing better now, but I am a shell of what I used to be. The military as a whole does not care about you. The VA as a whole does not care about you. War is ugly, are cruel, and cold. There are no winners in war. Just survivors. 

I do want to thank all the well wishes that I have gotten. It has take nearly a decade but I am on the better side of recovery. I also dont want people to think that I am anti military. We do not yet live in a world that will allow no preventive measures like armies. But I hope one day we do."
