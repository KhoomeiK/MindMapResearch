nba,ffd371p,t1_ffc0wja,1579812523.0,"I think refs have always been wildly inconsistent the difference now is definition of your television and the amount of times we replay things. Plus the internet. We can replay something now on a 70 in. television in 1080p/4k and scrutinize the hell out of it. Whereas 20 years ago there was the internet but you didn't have videos being uploaded the way they are now and discussed over and over again. I think that's also contributed to people thinking the issue is worse. Then there's the speed of the game now which is just impossible to ref.

Just look at the 90s. Star players always got calls and refs always called things differently in the regular season. They've never been consistent."

I doubt when DWest was drafted 24th in the NBA this is where he envisioned his life ending up and I doubt this is where he wants to be. The guy is mentally ill he didn't mess up and he's still alive so there's still a purpose for him. His life doesnt have to be over. It can still be rich in other ways.

I don't mind watching the top college teams but I just want to the best of the best which is the NBA and NFL.

He joined a team that lost in the finals a year before and if stupid Houston doesn't go 0-27 from 3 GSW doesn't make it to the finals that year either. There was no guarantee that KD would win a championship just because of the team and joined. I can also tell your a talentless hack with no respect for people like Jerry West who anyone would want to be recruited by.

Character issues have been a problem for him before he ever got his 1st concussion in the NFL. He even lost a scholarship to FIU because of an altercation on campus and had such bad grades no one would touch him. I just think it's a disservice to anyone who's actually had CTE or is living with it. He also didn't grow up with any real father figure and lived in an incredibly poor and violent part of town. Let's factor in everything before we just blame CTE and play doctor. He's had problems going back a long time and I don't necessarily think it's just because Burfict rocked his dome.
