Having a math background and some programming knowledge, I thought I could get into being a data scientist also. I recently saw a posting for a quantitive developer which also sounded quite engaging and interesting."

offmychest,ff8moyd,t3_es8xl4,1579686191.0,"Awww your children are going to have so much fun having a lot of siblings. I wish I had a family as big as the one in cheaper by the dozen. If I can afford kids, I would like a huge family haha. 

Well this is the time where family comes in to help. You got to ask sisters, mothers, mother in law, sister in laws, fathers grandfathers, brothers to help you out with the kids. Like babysit them for sometime so u can have time to yourself. Once your kids become teenagers then most likely then don’t want anything to do with you for sometime haha. So u will earn your peace then. But if you can’t wait, then ask your family for help!"
offmychest,ff8m0ot,t3_es904q,1579685144.0,"I’m truly sorry for that you had to face... Life is full of ups and downs at one point you were on your ups and now you are facing the lowest point of your life. So I can assure you there will be up from here. But like everything, it needs time. You need time as well. Your first task is to lawyer up and serve your sentence, hopefully you only get community service. Fingers crossed. Secondly, work on your anger issues. You had every right to be angry, but you can’t hurt others in your anger (verbally or physically). She cheating on you is cause she has a lack of character. Don’t let her drop you down to her stage. After that, nothing is over. You can still have a career. Money isn’t everything. You can still find a career which makes you happy and earn a decent living. Hit the gym, delete Facebook and dumb everyone who is being toxic to you cus of your past. I would say run from it for sometime. After a while, you can reach out and reconcile with your past. But don’t forget your daughter. Be in touch with her. Don’t let your ex’s characterless decision affect your relationship with your daughter. 

I know everything is overwhelming now. But take it one day at a time and gradually. You have fallen, so crawl first then walk and then u can run. But u will run again so don’t overthink about the future. Time heals everything, you will pass through this and be stronger and better version of yourself."
