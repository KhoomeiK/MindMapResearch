But I like that he did.

Before Endgame came out, I tried to think of how they would move forward after IA.

My ideas weren't very good. I didnt see any way out.

So, when I saw Endgame and the way they went... was way outside of anything  I had come with. 

So, I was surprised and happy.

I liked all of the family service and I was engaged in the story.

I was just very satisfied.

I get that others don't feel the same way, but thinking Stark's last words has me getting little misty-eyed.

Of course, I'm drunk and high as well. Lol.

I was super happy with Endgame and other than a few quibbles, I am happy."

Spy-Nebula brought past Thanos through time to the present.

Thanos telling Witch he doesn't know her makes sense.

Because he hasn't met her yet.

Not sure where your getting alternate Thanos from.

In fact, Steve's entire mission was to collapse any alternate timelines by returning the stones before anyone misses them and acts on that knowledge.

Which is all moot considering time travel is bonkers."
