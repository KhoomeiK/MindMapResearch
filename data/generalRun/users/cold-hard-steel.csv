Team 1

Ashe - Shikari/RM 

Balthier - Uhlan/archer

Fran - Monk/TM

Team 2

Vaan - Knight/BM

Basch - Bushi/foebreaker

Penelo- Machinist/WM


Each team has a tank (and damage dealer), DPS monster, and support. Works well in pretty much any situation.

The tank has a shield so they can tank and has decoy cast on them. The DPS is hasted and berserked. The support supports and stays out of the way with their long ranged weaponry."

Blood tests, poo tests, scans all pale in significance to a colonoscopy. A screening program including colonoscopy is proven to reduce the rate of colorectal cancer by the removal of polyps that could turn cancerous and improving the survival from colorectal cancer through early detection. What is the issue is colonoscopies after the first are often performed more frequently than required. A strong family history of colorectal cancer for example requires a colonoscopy only every five years. Different countries have different screening programs depending on funding etc but the follow up protocols are pretty much the same."

In the before time, in the long long ago, there was no such thing as grass. Trees and bushes grew where they grew and there wasn’t much growing where they didn’t. 

Then the grasses came. Grass is very hardy, it can grow in places that trees cannot, it is drought resistant, and even when mostly eaten it can grow right back. Grass became very widespread and successful."
StardewValley,ff8lehd,t3_es3uei,1579684200.0,"Each ‘fish’ has a growth rate, say every 3 days. So every three days the population will go up by one. If the population can’t go up because there is no more room (ie your pond population is 3/3) then the ‘fish’ give you a quest. Compete the quest to make ‘more room’ in the pond. Do enough quests and you can get the population up to ten. The higher the population the more likely you will get an item each day from the pond to collect. It’s usually fish eggs (roe) but can be other items depending on your ‘fish’. Usually a higher population unlocks better items to collect from your pond. For example a population of 9 or 10 in a blob fish pond means there’s a small chance you can get a pearl instead of roe."

StardewValley,fe6lbkp,t1_fe6g2ye,1578894721.0,"Technically correct (the best kind of correct). Given that the poorest quality berry is worth 3000g, and the best you can get from a seed maker is three seeds, and seeds are 1000g each (or rarely cheaper) from the pig-lady. Then on average you are paying more for your seeds from a seed maker than you are from pig-lady. 

However, if you consider the average output from a seed maker is two seeds of the produce entered and you just put standard gem berries in then you’ve turned your 3000g berry into at least 6000g worth of berries (eventually) which is not a bad thing.

todayilearned,fe4yz5y,t1_fe4ukm5,1578864147.0,"The gut microbiome is indeed very important. However, the role of the appendix in this relative to the rest of your gut is overstated. Interestingly a lot of probiotics are pretty much useless, even if given when the micorbiome is out of whack, there are a few good ones though. Your comment about the foods is spot on, ‘live foods’ such as sourdough, sauerkraut, yoghurts etc are helpful in maintaining and restoring the microbiome. In addition to this diets high in soluble fibre (such as in cereals) are fantastic at maintaining your healthy microbiome.

The take home message the public needs is that you don’t have to worry about the long term effects of losing your appendix and the secret to a healthy life (and gut micorbiome) is just have a healthy, well balanced diet with plenty of fibre. 

The in-depth workings of the gut microbiome are still being discovered and there are many more breakthroughs to be made. I suspect that eventually there will be a very specific cocktail of prebiotics given to children at a young age in combination with the vaccination schedule to optimise health."
