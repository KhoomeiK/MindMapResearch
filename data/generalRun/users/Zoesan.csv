What a pointless observation. By your logic every metal bound sounds the same.

No, they do not. They use different guitar brands, different pickups, different amplifiers. 

Their records sound completely different. From the guitar tones, to drum tones, to musical style, to songwriting. If you think those bands sound extremely similar, maybe you need to stop widening your horizon and start going in depth on the things you talk about.

Right, one of the forerunners of modern metalcore, a beloved band by many and one of the most successful metalcore bands is clearly lacking anything of value.

What in the fuck, AILD have been around since 2000 (the same year as between the buried and me). Wage war started in 2010. (Moreover, wage war doesn't really sound that much like AILD, as wage war sounds a lot like hardcore punk and AILD sounds much more like any of the gothenburg bands from the 90s.
