corvallis,ffit9vy,t1_ffis9it,1579982164.0,"Corvallis is much more extreme about it than most college towns. It's a surprise to a lot of people.

If you're happy to live in an apartment and don't have pets, it's a lot less important. But houses/duplexes with private owners or smaller rental companies get rented fast. Especially if they're pet friendly."
AskReddit,ffis3sm,t1_ffi8arg,1579981321.0,Header color makes me think of Golder associates. Had to fill out way too many emergency plans when I was there.
Surveying,ffiktd0,t3_etthxb,1579976264.0,"Draft recorded surveys in the area  

Align them roughly to gis taxlots 

make calc points for monuments

 make work maps showing calc points,  aerial imagery, tax lots

Field guys do their thing. Provide support on finding monuments or which ones are most important to get.

We usually run traverses and tie gps shots multiple times. So we run an adjustment in Trimble business center or starnet. That can be a process. The licensed surveyor does that sometimes. Depends how busy he is vs how much he trusts his tech.

Import adjusted points to a database. We use feature codes so cad will automatically draw out lines and show the right symbols. (As long as field guys coded everything right, which they usually don't.) 

Go through everything and make sure we're showing what we need to show correctly. For example, sidewalk points connect to make lines that make sense. Label all the found monuments. 

Hand off all the boundary info to the licensed surveyor. He resolves any issues, decides if anything needs to be set, etc.

Make a surface if we did topo work.

Put together existing conditions sheets, record of survey, ALTA survey, whatever we need to provide the client. That can vary a lot depending on the job. 

Good things to know in cad are surfaces, xrefs, data shortcuts, databases, layer management. Lots of small very useful commands like line by bearing and distance, curve from end of object, cglist. I have a running list"
corvallis,ffij7dn,t3_etiokl,1579975152.0,"If you're renting, lock down housing at the beginning of summer! I can't tell you how crazy the Corvallis rental market is. Almost everyone secures their rental before they leave town for summer break. You will have a ton more options if you are looking in May/June than if you're looking in August. I know it's renting for extra months, but it's likely you might end up saving money. The rentals available at the end of summer tend to be more expensive. 

We rented from proper t care and they were great. When we left, they filled our place without even posting an ad because someone called well before we moved out. Highly recommend that."

YouShouldKnow,ffgt78p,t1_ffffn9v,1579914440.0,I was hoping someone in this thread would suggest surveying! We need people pretty bad in my area.
YouShouldKnow,ffgt3x4,t1_ffff880,1579914372.0,Land surveying is typically pretty local. The field needs people bad in my area.
YouShouldKnow,ffgt0a3,t1_fffiz72,1579914298.0,"Oregon is crazy looking for land surveying techs. Generally no experience necessary, but a little construction or hands on anything background helps."
Dogtraining,ffd8k5j,t3_estevw,1579815520.0,"Try feeding him more to help the counter surfing and trash digging. One of my dogs was getting into stuff and feeding him just a bit more made a pretty big difference. if you're trying to exercise it out, he might be extra hungry. (not to mention, he might be going through a growth spurt.)

Get a trash can with a lid that he can't get into. We got [one similar to this, but it was a generic brand](https://www.walmart.com/ip/iTouchless-SoftStep-13-2-Gallon-Stainless-Steel-Step-Trash-Can-50-Liter-Pedal-Kitchen-Trash-Can/953890106). He can still open it, but he has to really try. It's enough to keep him out of it unless it's full with something really good smelling at the top."
weddingplanning,ffcnexd,t3_eswtv6,1579803162.0,The wedding discord is the best!! It's a lot more conversational than reddit. And people are so supportive and helpful. It's the best place to ask all those small annoying questions that you don't want to bother all your real life people with.
Dogtraining,ffajg53,t3_esbhxc,1579737236.0,My dog fusses if she's cold or wants to cuddle. But the regularity of this is interesting to me. Every couple of months might line up with an unspayed female dog in your neighborhood being in heat.
DesignMyRoom,ffacelq,t3_esidc2,1579732238.0,"I'm a big fan of dark green. You can match it to your plants. Throw blankets, some pillows. You don't need much! 

I could also see a rich blue going well. That blue from the rug, or a darker one."
OregonStateUniv,ff9keuz,t1_ff9gz8j,1579714872.0,You can definitely do the second one after you graduate. It's pretty common. Most of the people i know who did that stayed on as a full time employee with their second company.
