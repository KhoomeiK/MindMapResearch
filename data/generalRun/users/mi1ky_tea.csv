I may be wrong but I remember looking into it."
SuicideWatch,fgelkk2,t1_fgdvru9,1580702538.0,"Euthanasia should be accessible to all. Society shouldn't be allowed to dictate what constitutes for enough suffering for them to be like ""oh yeah, well in that case I have no issue with doctor assisted suicide"" ...like really?"
SuicideWatch,fgeldzr,t3_exwvb6,1580702398.0,"I cannot tell you how much I feel this post on a spiritual level. I had surgery 2 weeks ago. The night before I had a realization...I thought to myself how general anaesthesia would be an amazing way to go. you're just there and then you're just a sleep forever.

When I woke up from surgery it took me a few hours to come to but when I did I had this amazing feeling because for once my brain shut up. Even when I dream there is so much clutter and noise....but that time there was nothing. it was refreshing.

Oddly enough I was considering making a post about this exact thing."
GoodValue,fgcs2ry,t1_fgcrh4w,1580675780.0,"Oh for sure. I have really messed up teeth though and I find flossing to be extremely difficult due to the spacing of my teeth. The floss constantly gets stuck and breaks. I'm just hoping it can help me get more of that deep clean that I need. 
Though, I should still consult a dentist."
GoodValue,fgcj70x,t1_fgcg208,1580673112.0,So I don't know much about these tools yet so forgive my ignorance. What is the reservoir for? And canister? Do those need to be changed or anything?
Blind,ffy2io8,t1_ffy1pne,1580337324.0,"Unfortunately,I am not working right now. I'm looking though.the issue is getting employed. 

Where do I get a workplace assessmrnt done?"
Blind,ffx8dnt,t1_ffx7zgp,1580319886.0,"We have something similar we have a law here about equal opportunity workplace and blah blah blah. But honestly 99% it's just words written to abide by rules. They also do have government grants that are typically offer through employment agencies either run by the government of Ontario or government of Canada. Most of the time that gets us a probation period and then a decision is made afterwards. However, these agencies can't guarantee a job.loke they say they can't force someone to hire you. 
There is also funding from other places for assistance devices but that honestly doesn't seem to be the issue. The issue is they just don't want to have deal with employing us."
rant,ff6s6xy,t3_eruel4,1579633777.0,"Just want to share a story. 

When I was In a shelter a couple years ago, there was a mother with three kids, 8,4,2 IIRC. she was always on her phone trying to find her new flavour of the week whole she left the oldest inside to watch his younger siblings. It was so sad I felt so bad for him. Not only was he going through such a stressful time in that living situation and just starting school, but he had to take on his mother's responsibilities because she makes such piss poor decisions.

If you don't have the capacity to take xar of your kid(s) STOP fucking having them."
mentalhealth,ff6r0hw,t3_erxe88,1579633068.0,"Yep, this happens all the time. Right now in my life I'm kinda Ina precarious situation and it just feels like time is running out for me. It's like I'm always frantic because things aren't happening. 
I also get very anxious when I'm even a few minutes late. I'm not too sure why honestly."
abuse,ff26w47,t1_ff2699j,1579495516.0,"Well they kept trying to get me to touch their genitals. Then they brought me to a communal washroom (was living in a shelter at the time) and tried to get me to lay on top of them.  
I too feel I didn't know much about what was appropriate or not. I believe now the reason I was so uncomfortable, besides not consenting, is because I've always had some sex repulsion issues, though it wasn't bad as it is now. Now after multiple sexual assults, I'm completely sex repulsed and anything relared to sex, though it wasn't always this bad."
mentalhealth,ff1m7bj,t1_ff0408f,1579481484.0,"Interesting that you mention this. Studies have found that an overgrowth of bad gut bacteria (eating too much sugars and processed food causes this) can cause depression. They've also found that same gut bacteria in your brain too, which explains the ""gut feeling"" thing. Anytime I mention this people write me off as I'm just crazy, but it is actually quite interesting stuff."
DoesAnybodyElse,fcw3n9r,t3_ej1bho,1578016392.0,"I do this almost every waking moment. I'm not exaggerating. 
I make facial expressions that I'm making in my daydreams, hand movements, laugh, smile and even speak what I'm saying in my head. I definitely get embarrassed like when I'm on public transit. Sometimes I can catch myself and put my hands over my mouth when I want to laugh or smile. At home IFGAF. When I first lived with roomates I was super worried about someone hearing me talk to myself. Then one day a roomate asked and I was like eh whatever I was talking to myself. I'm a lot more lax about that part now but still. I tend to also narrate what I'm doing or just speak what I'm thinking. For example, if I'm grocery shopping I might say something like ""ugh they don't have any"" or ""why is this can so dented"" things along that time. I'm constantly in a daydream state tbh.

Edit: a couple times I've also done crazy hand/ body gestures and I didn't notice a person was coming towards me. I get so embarrassed. I try to play it off like I was on the phone or something."
