xmen,ffdo4ge,t1_ffdk05b,1579825019.0,"I think a lot of people jumped on the Greg land hate bandwagon, I'm not a huge fan of him tracing so often but while his style has flaws I still enjoy it. I think he's tried to use less references , traces lately which is good."
xmen,ffcki66,t1_ffcjzwh,1579801393.0,Ahh ok I thought it looked different than Land. I actually kinda like Land's art though lol
xmen,ffcj3dc,t3_esrpak,1579800542.0,Probably gonna get downvoted for this lol but I actually like this art
Shinmai_Maou,ffamljf,t3_eskn77,1579739486.0,I love this guy's posts. Chisato has the best cake

todayilearned,ff3o920,t1_ff3le9o,1579545306.0,If it weren't for America the Nazis would've won and taken over Europe and the Japanese would've taken asia so stop complaining about America and be grateful.
todayilearned,ff3kq6f,t1_ff3jl1m,1579543119.0,? I never said that it was ok...
todayilearned,ff36qzx,t1_ff36kbn,1579535017.0,STFU it was a fair retaliation for a war they started.
todayilearned,ff36n1c,t3_er8yw5,1579534943.0,I had a classmate who was a history buff who asked the teacher why the war crimes of Japan aren't covered in Western schools the same way the Nazis and Holocaust were.
todayilearned,ff36cwz,t1_ff33qw1,1579534753.0,Don't tell me about Japanese history. I have grandparents who had to flee Asia as they raped and butchered their way through.
todayilearned,ff33y22,t1_ff2k43i,1579533061.0,Yeah it's pretty disgusting to see them try and take the moral high ground here. Didn't they honor some of their fallen generals who were known for war crimes?
todayilearned,ff33o7b,t1_ff30u5b,1579532862.0,How would you have stopped them then? The  war would have carried out indefinitely
todayilearned,ff336zh,t1_ff2zupi,1579532499.0,"Agreed , they started the war and committed horrible attrocities that they don't seem to apologectic for they needed to be prepared to face the consequences of their actions. It's sick to turn around and then try to take the moral high ground."
todayilearned,ff32vdq,t1_ff2suai,1579532253.0,"What the Japanese did in WW2 was way worse than what the Nazis did, but they don't really teach it in the western schools and Japan doesn't like to acknowledge it so the rest of Asia still kinda hates them"
FanTheories,fesmsa2,t3_cmb746,1579366892.0,Love this amazing theory. Wonder what Jk Rowling would say...

pegasusart,fdx7ixm,t1_fdp28h9,1578766054.0,"Yeah I mean I just like the details and the way you drew your ladies before, you know?"
comicbookcollecting,fdx7d7n,t1_fdnns5t,1578766001.0,"Yeah it's a really beautiful cover, loves the lines and the inking. The covers back then really were special and rarer to find today"

Frozen,fds9mwm,t3_emt6z5,1578697538.0,So pretty
pegasusart,fdovixs,t1_fdoueto,1578613829.0,"I will say this from an outsiders perspective that seems like there are things that you gain and lose with digital. With your previous pencils and hand drawn stuff the lines were thinner and there was a lot more detail. With digital you gain stuff like shading, colors but lose some of those previous intricate details. I know this might be hard but would you ever consider hand drawing and then having someone else digitally ink and color? I know it's really hard to do all 3 roles and finding someone who can compliment your pencils can really go a long way, just look at Jim Lee."
comicbookcollecting,fdoudus,t1_fdnfwq8,1578613092.0,"Yeah him and whedon were a great combo, very hard to follow up Morrison's run but they did a great job."
pegasusart,fdou8is,t1_fdopsjo,1578612995.0,Haha glad to hear it. Like I said I really was a huge fan of SA when it was ongoing. Really happy to hear it's returning! Is your stuff all digital now instead of pencils? I would say those pin ups you drew of the SA girls were my favorite art of yours
comicbookcollecting,fdnb55f,t3_emai2y,1578581962.0,"The Shadow of the Bat also came with a lot of fold out posters, schematics of Arkham, etc... Not sure anyone has any idea about those?"
comicbookcollecting,fdnag1z,t3_emai2y,1578581500.0,Was pleasantly surprised to go home and find that the X-Men 1 was signed on the inside by Cassady...
pegasusart,fdma1ex,t1_fd41ysq,1578543578.0,"Yeah I liked your older stuff better like submission agenda and whores of darkseid. I liked it when the lines were more intricate and more detailed. It might be because you are busier or trying a new style but it feels like your newer stuff isn't as detailed ( maybe a new inker would help) and all the girls kinda look the same with big lips, t&a, etc... I liked that you worked with mobofair and it's a great combo but not a huge fan of your new style tbh..."
Elsanna,fdchie5,t1_fd0641h,1578275030.0,Haha thanks
TrueOffMyChest,fd6ixt2,t3_e8zhs1,1578191744.0,"It's definitely tough, Im kinda in the same boat. In fact you helped me on here with your comment a while back. I think the best you can do is love and improve yourself and good things will happen naturally."
