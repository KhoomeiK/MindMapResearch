She then cornered me and told me to stay away from her and all her friends but told her friends to watch me because I ‘wasn’t doing too well’ she even went so far as to gather people to look for me during lunch so I couldn’t be somewhere with having to move to avoid her. It took me talking to another friend who explained everything to everyone else before I could return to my friends, though with daggers stabbing me all the time by my ex.
