nfl,fdhmdwu,t1_fdhet0q,1578425719.0,"Indeed. Guys like John Harbaugh and Joe Judge are the closest thing we've seen to a coach jumping from special teams to head coach, and both of them had to have a year of work in an additional role before they got hired (Harbaugh switched from special teams to defensive backs coach for his last year on the Eagles staff and Judge added WR coach to his roles with the Patriots). Will we see a special teams guy hired straight up at some point? I think it's possible, especially with Harbaugh's success and if Judge proves to be a good hire, but it's still gonna be viewed as a gamble by some owners."
nfl,fdhdp67,t1_fdh932j,1578420519.0,"All of them may have started out as special teams coaches, but by the time they were hired for head coaching positions in the NFL, they had taken on additional roles or switched to other areas of coaching.

-Bill Cowher: Defensive coordinator for the Kansas City Chiefs from 1989-1991.

-Mike Ditka: Also worked as a wide receiver or tight ends coach while being the special teams coach for the Cowboys.

-Marv Levy: Was a head coach at the collegiate level, as well as the CFL and USFL.

-Bill Belichick: Was the Giants Defensive Coordinator from 1985-1990 before the Browns hired him, then he was the assistant head coach and defensive coordinator of the Jets from 1997-1999.

So while all these guys coached special teams at one time or another, they didn't get hired as head coaches until they held some other positions."

politics,fdf4khd,t1_fdf32th,1578353160.0,"Do you have any sources for those quotes? Also, what were the percentages for Sanders voters voting for Clinton? I think it's also important to point out that there were more voters in the [2008 Democratic Primary](https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2008/president/democratic_vote_count.html) than there were in the [2016 primary](https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/democratic_vote_count.html). This means that it's entirely possible that less Sanders voters overall made the flip simply because there were less to flip to begin with.

I can assure you that she absolutely did not want Trump to win. I have never heard her speak more negatively about someone in my entire life. I'm just pointing out that there is another perspective out there and that the progressive wing need to be aware about."
politics,fdf3aji,t1_fdf1ib0,1578352329.0,"While I think that she would accept that information, she'd point out states like Michigan and Wisconsin, where Bernie won the primary, but Trump won in the general election, as places where Bernie could have done more to get his base behind Hillary."
politics,fdf1yk7,t1_fdf0xmp,1578351467.0,"At least to her, she believed that Hillary at least made sure to keep the party unified behind one candidate while Sanders didn't. Now, plenty of that is on Hillary, but I can recall plenty of those Bernie or bust types on here, while she saw them in interviews or read about them in the news. Like I said, not based on any real data, but I can see how she developed that impression."
politics,fdezxrf,t1_fdeqq18,1578350196.0,"After speaking with my mom (she's a longtime registered Democrat), I got a good look at this perspective. To her, Sanders came across like a leech in that he wasn't a member of the party until he decided to run for President. Then, at least to her, he didn't push hard enough to get Hillary elected after he lost the nomination, at least not compared to what Hillary did for Obama in 2008. A lot of this was the result of empirical observations on her part, but I imagine it's not an uncommon train of thought. 

Right now, I'm not sure where her loyalties lie. I know that she still doesn't like Sanders. At the same time, she isn't the biggest fan of Biden either and seems to be more positive toward Buttigieg, though she has reservations about him too. Warren seemed to be on her radar for a while too, but I know she wasn't the biggest fan of her attack on Pete during the last debate. It's hard to judge her for certain."
