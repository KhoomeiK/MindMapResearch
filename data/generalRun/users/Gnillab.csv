In Bruges, Snatch, Layer Cake, and Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels all have some of the same qualities."

Watches,fdnh322,t1_fdme8vc,1578585660.0,"Just wanted to add a different perspective re the polishing.

Before you downvote, remember you don't have to agree with everything.

If you're not a hardcore watch guy and like your things to look pristine, get it polished.

If you get it serviced and polished by Rolex it will look like new. Forget horror stories about losing the sharp edges. Rolex don't do that (obviously).

The ""patina"" is mostly an acquired taste that people who are into watches have gotten used to. Your family will appreciate a restoration and that the heirloom is being taken care of.

In the end, do what your gut says. I don't see you regretting either decision, tbh.

Of course, if in doubt, definitely don't get it polished! Can't unring that bell. You can just as well have it polished in a year or two."

HC is fantastic in it."

Yeah, have a look at the last launch game from Guerilla Games before you decide on anything.

GG have done some great work, but consistency is not their strong suit."

Bang & Olufsen are making some great streaming solutuons these days as well. Of course, you pay for the premium design and build, so that might be a deal breaker for some."

AskReddit,fbzv0vq,t1_fbzqam1,1577263047.0,"As a European visiting NYC for the first, I was overwhelmed first with how little time you need to spend in front of a Subway map to be offered help by a stranger.

Then, with how much people ignore each other in the street.

Then, with how much people seem to loathe everyone in line at the same store or coffee shop.

New Yorkers are oddly specific with their friendliness."

BMW,fby83x4,t1_fby1jjr,1577210389.0,"Foam lances are just for show. Covering the car in foam makes absolutely no difference.

Looks cool, though and can genuinely be fun if you can ignore that it's a waste of time and water.

Source: have been obsessed with car cleaning and ""detailing"" and spent way to much money on recommended tools and products that turned out useless."
