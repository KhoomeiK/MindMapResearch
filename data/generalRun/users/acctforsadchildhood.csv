This is gonna sound like I'm crazy as shit, or my boyfriend is, but...

I had my own, separate issue concerning a tax refund (side note: fuck the IRS) that was forfeited to my state's (Pennsylvania) unclaimed property cache. So I had to petition the Treasury to get it, but they have an online search engine so anyone can look up if they have stuff (mostly money, but they catalog all unclaimed property types) waiting to be claimed.

For shits n giggles we typed his name in, and there were like 5 or 6 refunds from GameStop just chilling for apparently years... he never worked there, and really only would go there to replace a controller or something that had broken that day or some shit. To this day, he hasn't even claimed them, to my chagrin, because he has no fucking idea what or why they exist. He used to shop there more, especially when you had to have the CD for games.

Also, there's one two blocks from us now, and they were the only store not busy for Christmas. They are constantly advertising hiring events and whatnot too, there's no way it's because of demand."

They fucking pay cash money for this shit, the only thing I can say is that is shitty if they have true knowledge it's bad and don't give af, but I'll take your word that they DO know.

And I am paranoid as shit, I'm on the east coast US, and knowing it's already in Seattle, a simple plane ride away domestically, scares me too. We have plenty of people here in Philadelphia who have ties to that area. 

I don't like being sensationalist, but the Chinese government is known for a lot of things, but being upfront and honest are nowhere on that list. And if it's here, it's a ton of other places likely too. Like you said people know they're sick or likely impending sick, and still travelling.

Advice,ff90u17,t3_es9wdh,1579701984.0,"Pay the fines/restitution, show up for all appointments, don't use any substances. They likely gave you a list of rules, follow all of them, and keep records of interactions.

And just because you will eventually get to the tail-end of the time period, don't slack on the rules, because any infraction can lead to incarceration and or reinstatement of the whole damn sentence, ie: you have complied for 11 months of a 12 month sentence, and decide to smoke weed, and your officer urines you month 11.5. They can easily give you 12 more months (or more if they're a dick) of probation with no credit for the time you put in (reinstated), or worse, resentence you to a jail sentence with likely parole afterwards (revoked). At least with parole your compliance/incarceration time usually counts towards your time. 

If you violate probation, you can sit in jail and that time will not count towards anything.

Dumb shit I've seen people do jail time for while on probation:

Address changes not ""approved"" by PO, this goes into my tip of keeping records of your phone calls and messages left to that PO.

Police contact, even without new criminal charges... traffic tickets, etc.

But the biggest, obvious, way people mess up is by getting a new charge of any kind, which is surprisingly easy to do when you consider police will often charge you with something when they know you're on supervision... more so than a random person who has never been in trouble before doing the same thing.

That being said, it can be done. Make your life about staying at home, going to work, and not going out late unless neccessary. Avoid police interaction if at all possible, and report it to your officer if it happens. 

Good luck. Where I live, Philadelphia, probation is rarely shortened for compliance. It very well could be different where you live. They usually taper off the intensity of supervision, though, once you establish you are being compliant. Just don't let them give you just enough rope to hang yourself. They can and will pop up at your house/work, if they feel like it, and your roommate's bong on the table will get YOU in trouble, so keep stuff like that in mind."

It's not just the non-dropping off, it's also that she hadn't seen him in a long time.

The only thing the caller should have done differently is bypass 911 and call the local non-emergency number to request it.

And the irreparable damage part is crazy-sounding, and you need to hear that. A welfare check is usually done with paramedics in tow. The person is checked, the response needed, if any, is assessed, and then the caller is informed it's complete. It's not like they're calling the Gestapo to report Jews, knock off the hyperbole."
