aww,ff2jpbq,t1_ff2bdn1,1579509224.0,Yesterday my dog legit spazzed over a door that's always been there. They're such dorks.
HumansBeingBros,feyipa6,t1_feyede9,1579445979.0,He also made a pretty awesome video game!
worldnews,ferrcur,t1_ferpdj4,1579357473.0,Honestly at that point you're not really thinking clearly. Part of the problem with depression is being too introspective. You get stuck in dark thoughts about what your life is like and whether or not it's your fault. It's not that you don't care about others but you've sort of lost the ability to do it with ease because you're so bogged down by negative thoughts. It's terrible.
instant_regret,ferj66n,t1_fer9n8z,1579354567.0,"I did this when I was a kid. You open a bottle and starts to fizz over, dumb brain decides the best way to stop it is with your mouth. Pretty much as soon as you've done it you realize you're mistake, but it all happens so fast it's too late and you're spewing fizz everywhere."
UpliftingNews,feovio2,t1_feouq8a,1579306313.0,"Actually, it is. Judges have discretion and interpretation of the law. You cannot possibly afford a lawyer if you are in need of filing bankruptcy."
UpliftingNews,feoo04b,t1_feokf0p,1579302789.0,I did just now in reference to the education of judges who would behave so backwards to logic.
UpliftingNews,feoelam,t1_feoamx2,1579299087.0,Aka stamping everything that hits your desk without looking at it.
UpliftingNews,feoeefb,t1_feo64o3,1579299040.0,"The problems discussed in this thread have almost all come from policy changes in the past 10 years. After the recession of 2008, even, the bankruptcy system became incredibly restricted."
UpliftingNews,feoe6l2,t1_feo64cr,1579298912.0,If you're married it's highly unlikely that you'll get that payment lowered.
UpliftingNews,feoe2y6,t1_feob8qj,1579298852.0,Such a backwards thought process it makes you wonder about the education.
UpliftingNews,feodyq0,t1_feng8n6,1579298779.0,Past generations kind of ruined that for everyone though.
reactiongifs,feodhzc,t1_femyasw,1579298693.0,Idk mine will post a cop outside when they are about an hour from close turning everyone away.
reactiongifs,feoda16,t3_epzvft,1579298582.0,Mrw I get to the dmv and there's not a line wrapped around the building..
AskReddit,fenxfa7,t1_fen6ghr,1579292216.0,What about a cupcake?
chemicalreactiongifs,feewbhc,t1_feew5eh,1579042609.0,Counter point- just saying something sucks is a poor quality comment. It adds little to the conversation and is low effort.
DidntKnowIWantedThat,feevk0n,t1_feejrlg,1579042138.0,Lol am woman smoker and I have never ever heard this
EatCheapAndHealthy,fdyjgmu,t1_fdt4hgj,1578780459.0,Idk I'm American and I've never seen those ingredients on my peanuts.
funny,fdxu2qp,t1_fdxhzes,1578772947.0,"Again, smoking frequently and constantly having the craving to smoke are different. 

Additionally there are plenty of psychological issues that have shown benefits from smoking. It is not just for pain management."
bipolar,fdxt96g,t1_fdx6sbg,1578772671.0,Yes that was one of my problems. It got worse the more we upped the dose. I ended up switching to lithium and it works better with my chemistry. Still some cognition issues but they're easy to get past.
videos,fdxt1p6,t1_fds4z4v,1578772595.0,"It's really not that farfetched. I've worked quite a few jobs, and at each one good or bad there are people like that who just don't want to look for better. 

I never said I disagreed with you. In face I agreed that it's easy to look for better even in the same industry."
funny,fdxfjgi,t1_fdx9o9v,1578768226.0,"Addiction isn't addiction without being held back in some way shape or form. Obviously any addict is going to be that way. 

Just because someone smokes frequently does not make them an addict."
peopleofwalmart,fdx7q0l,t1_fdx1urz,1578766122.0,I will never understand when people violate personal space like that.
SampleSize,fdx7djj,t1_fdvvqrv,1578766005.0,"Also, some people work in retail their entire life. It's pretty hard to sum up those experiences or differentiate them. For instance, I didn't feel safe working at a grocery store but felt safe selling children's clothing."
bipolar,fdx4xbp,t1_fdulkim,1578765396.0,Counter point- I was on it for 5 years and it really messed up my cognition. I couldn't remember things or retain new information that well.
WatchPeopleDieInside,fdtss2b,t1_fdspbhf,1578721629.0,You can be mentally ill and function like a normal person.
videos,fdruafw,t1_fdrfvg5,1578689817.0,For real. They pay the lowest in the industry. Not that hard to find another storage facility to work for.
videos,fdru65k,t1_fdrfqp9,1578689744.0,"Used to work there, too. It's like the Walmart of storage companies. Wasn't that hard for me to find a better storage company to work for."
videos,fdre6al,t1_fdqo5na,1578683204.0,You'd need a lot of time using an angle grinder on cylinder locks. You need a power drill for those.
LifeProTips,fdrbqel,t1_fdqjsax,1578682195.0,"I know you don't like the praise, but it is  positive reinforcement that many people need."
funny,fd9rr1m,t1_fd9nf7j,1578237163.0,Sometimes my dog is the big spoon when i wake up and it's awesome.
funny,fd9ri7z,t1_fd978lh,1578237061.0,Honestly jumping can cause dogs to slip a disc so I'm more than happy to give my pup a little hand.
WatchPeopleDieInside,fd5qdzh,t1_fd4wea7,1578180307.0,And this is why people want to keep castle laws.
GifRecipes,fd4fz7l,t1_fd30pcr,1578167145.0,It's much easier to get an even coating when you have plenty of breading mix though.
todayilearned,fcz47da,t1_fcz1mca,1578093323.0,Not really illustrating your maturity there.
science,fcx34d1,t1_fcw0unr,1578049128.0,You ate medication?
dogswithjobs,fcv71ec,t1_fcud08v,1577995973.0,"I have legitimate severe dog allergies and so does my brother. We both take meds and it's plenty tolerable. 

Frankly if dander is that hard on you just pet owners existing in the same confined space will wreck you, in which case you should find other means of travel."
dogswithjobs,fcv6paj,t1_fcuhbq1,1577995773.0,Why are so many people in this thread resorting to name calling? You throw your point in the trash behaving like that.
dogswithjobs,fcv6ayz,t1_fcuppcm,1577995536.0,"They mean if the dog is not well behaved. Dogs that are not well behaved are not protected and can be asked to remove from the premises.

A service dog does not harass other people or bite them or jump on them or eliminate willy nilly. They do their job."
dogswithjobs,fcv5381,t1_fcugcd2,1577994822.0,"Being disrespectful back helps no one, friend. You shouldn't call names like that just because you disagree."
pics,fcr9v83,t3_eigav4,1577898879.0,This literally looks like an ad for shell not a campaign against gas. Not a great concept.
aww,fcr8wkm,t1_fcr6yf4,1577898478.0,Because evolution is not necessarily an improvement in one's biology.
aww,fcr8kuy,t1_fcr2svd,1577898355.0,Almost like it's a common quadruped thing and not a cat thing
technology,fc6nlqr,t1_fc6c8c6,1577484860.0,For me it's the astronomical cost. Thousands of dollars per tooth with insurance like fuck you dentist I'll gum it when i have to.
deadbydaylight,fc6md1c,t1_fc5toyl,1577483984.0,I read this in his voice

aww,fbzagvb,t1_fbz63sf,1577240220.0,"Yes I've thought about going raw many times but the vet has advised against it on account of risk of bacteria exposure to a sensitive immune system. I do feed her freeze dried food when it's in the budget, though, and make her bone broth for her joints (she basically has rheumatoid arthritis)."
