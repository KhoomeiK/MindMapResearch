I've lost alot of weight and most people would not guess that i used go be fat.  Whenever i see others make fun of other fat people i still get angry.  It is so easy to make jokes at their expense, when you are not in their situation. It truly breaks my heart.  I know being fat/ obese is unhealthy,  and in alot of cases it has to do with poor choices in life,  but you usually don't know why they made them.  People don't want to be fat and miserable."
offmychest,ff60icf,t3_erh037,1579615978.0,"You are probably not that bad of a person, perhaps it is simply the result of hardship in your life you had to endure. 

There's probably a reason you used to treat people like that.  Although there might be no excuse for this you should be proud of yourself, you took notice of your own behavior and decided to take action.  That takes strength. Good luck in being a better version of you."
offmychest,ff5qk8u,t3_eraow3,1579606216.0,"I feel you man, a few days ago i almost lost both my wife due to a gruesome childbirth. 

Luckily the medical staff were just in time and I'm relieved to say that I'm a proud dad and husband. 

Don't take those who love you for granted, it's moments like this that make you realize that you would be lost without them."

I can't decide if she's cute or awful in his picture. I think i go with less then charming this time. Her nose is too big, the color of her hair just doesn't seem right, and her skin looks restless.

I know what's wrong. She's just getting older, which is not a bad thing of course. But I have this image of a Sclarett Johanson from the year 2004 in my mind:

Autistic,feenkhr,t1_feaw2a9,1579037370.0,What the ...?  Contemplating committing a murder-suicide against their own child!? or any child for that matter!? I'm at a loss for words here..
Autistic,feen8oq,t1_fedjf6e,1579037183.0,"Hi, she is actually supportive in many ways, i'm not trying to characterize her as a un-supportive person, but she thinks that a test is a waste of time and resources because it costs money and probably won't be funded by the insurers. 

Also, she said she doesn't care because she loves me anyways, and because I have a job, kids, and everything a man should want, there's no shame in having autism. So she looks at it from a bright side.

For me though, its not that simple. Because if i'm truly autistic, it would answer so many questions and clarify why things happened as they did. My childhood was not a bad one, but at school I felt .. different. Like everybody is blue and you are yellow. Different, like from a different age, or planet even at times.

It is good to read how you were able to learn about your disorder and your strength and weaknesses, and how to overcome those. I guess it must be hard, if not impossible to figure out that all by yourselves."
Autistic,feem62t,t1_fecsac1,1579036561.0,"Hi, I know I was over simplifying it by calling it a test. Our son got diagnosed so I know how long it can take. I suppose we were lucky how fast he got to be assessed. He was 3 years old and they knew right away he was autistic. Of course they've assessed him properly, but it wasn't a tough nut to crack. But I have heard stories from other parents where it took a long way before getting a diagnosis.

Thanks for your resolute words. I will absolutely consider it."

Thank you for your kind words."
offmychest,fe9nce1,t1_fe6wlgq,1578939699.0,"Hi there, 

Yeah I know she ain't enjoying this either, I know she is actually suffering and i'm just the guy that has to help her go through it. Today it started bad, then it went alright and it ended horribly... her having mood-swings plus me being clumsy most of the times (partly due to being nervous around her, partly because i'm simply.. clumsy by nature).  

Thanks!"
