EDAnonymous,ffek2jt,t3_et2kh8,1579851282.0,"Another ED person who likes to cook/bake here: I completely agree with your thoughts, OP. I think removing some aspect of that person’s autonomy through manipulating them is outright cruel. When I bake for people it’s to live vicariously through them, and gift them the joy I wish I could give myself. I also like to use it to make friends and make people happy. I know we all have different reasons for why we cook or bake for others, but those are mine and I can’t fathom that kind of cruelty."

EDAnonymous,fexpnz0,t1_fexaww5,1579434500.0,That’s usually water retention - change in diet means it’s gotta balance it out again.
fatlogic,fepcquc,t1_feonlhl,1579317319.0,"To be fair, though, I’ve heard anecdotally about a fair few anorexics struggling with recovery, where afterward they do a 180 and turn to binge eating because they’ve been depriving themselves so long and recovery has managed to flip that switch for them. Though I really really doubt many of them are going straight into the body positivity movement from there - most of them are still struggling with the internalised self hatred, just coping with it differently."

Vindicta,fcozfsn,t1_fcnxrxw,1577845868.0,"I see - this is where our opinions/points of view cross ways. I certainly don’t disagree with any of that. Restricting heavily to a low healthy BMI over a short period of time used to make me pass out every time I stood up, and I felt exhausted a lot of the time, but not many more symptoms outside of that off the top of my head. 
Now, restricting moderately and over a longer period of time and losing the weight a little slower, and to a slightly underweight BMI, I have thus far experienced heavy exhaustion, brain fog, am emotional and quick to anger, don’t sleep well and have lost my period. 
I think you were right to point out that we were coming from different angles. That definitely seemed the case. 

Thank you, OP. I’m glad you got out where you could. I’m still trapped in this nightmare."
AskTruFemcels,fcmzt6d,t1_fcl2h9n,1577799012.0,But... that *is* validating.
Vindicta,fclq0n0,t1_fcdlfm4,1577753673.0,"But, that’s not true. Your body doesn’t stop losing weight so soon. If you are eating at a deficit the body will still use fat stores.

Long-term restriction actually leads to excess water retention - this effect was even observed in the Minnesota Starvation Experiment. Weight loss becomes sporadic over a long period of restriction because cortisol levels become elevated, and it effects glycogen stores in the body. This effect is even observed in keto, or fasting - dieters reader to the “woosh” effect in which they see no results for a period of time, until they go into Ketosis, in which the body uses the glycogen stores, and a portion of weight appears to go overnight. The same principle applies. Water weight can remain for up to months before you see it go.

My source? I am slightly underweight. I’m actually going through the same weight loss plateau right now. After stressing over it, and having to listen to ED brain shout over logical brain (the one that knows how CICO works and keeps reassuring ED brain that my body doesn’t defy physics) I’ve been rigorously researching, going through articles and studies. Feel free to try to refute my points, but off of the top of my head this is how it works. I’m happy to link some genuine sources later if need be."

EDAnonymous,fcjwnzb,t3_ehjajy,1577708306.0,"I used to be a compulsive binge eater, maybe about 6 years ago. After going through a bout of binge-purging (lasted maybe a couple years?) I’ve downward-spiralled with restriction. The shame that came with binge eating was indescribable. 99% of the reason for my restriction being as bad as it is, is due to the fear of yo-yo-ing back to the other extreme again. I can never go back there. I can’t."
