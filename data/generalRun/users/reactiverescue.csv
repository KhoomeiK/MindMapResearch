I’ve also been getting up at 5:30 for our morning walk. It works well for us, but it’s soooo funny - she really doesn’t want to get up and always gives me “Do I HAVE to?!” eyes as I coax her out of bed. Dummy, we only have to because you’re a barky mess if we go out at a normal hour!"

dogs,ff9fk7w,t1_ff9en5a,1579711942.0,"I’m glad to help! You could make the Kong more difficult by covering the hole with plain yogurt or PB and freezing it (with kibble inside). Plus there are definitely some toys out there that are more challenging than Kongs (the Quizzl, for example, it too hard for my dog!) Another good one is to get one of those rubber “mesh” balls and stuff it with fabric and treats so the dog can “disembowel” it. Just make sure your dog isn’t interested in swallowing fabric - if you’re worried about that you can stuff it with bigger things like rope toys.

My dog loves her snuffle mat. In addition to hiding the treats in the mat itself, I like to surround the mat with toys and hide treats either in the toys (if it’s like a Kong) or under toys (so it even works with soft toys). I know some people will hide things in boxes, etc, but since your dog is a destructive chewer I’d stick to hiding things around items it’s okay for your dog to chew."
reactivedogs,ff9984g,t3_es9gzk,1579707753.0,"Pup did well on her walk yesterday (of course with very careful management). When we walked back in the building, we entered JUST as another dog was exiting the back elevator. I immediately started to do a U-turn but the other dog barked first, and my dog threw in a few good barks in response, but overall it was not bad! Pretty sure the other dog is one that struggles with reactivity  as well, since they were on the back elevator and I also see them out super early in the morning (\~5:30) when I take mine out to avoid the morning rush."
dogs,ff985np,t3_esdeie,1579707067.0,"In addition to the crate training others have suggested, maybe have more chew toys that you switch out every few days so they remain exciting for him to chew on. 

Besides the physical exercise, what mental stimulation is he getting? You can make him use puzzle toys or a snuffle mat (since he seems to like scavenger hunting) to earn his meals."
dogs,ff93ku3,t1_ff919g9,1579704000.0,If my place were bigger I would do some similar to this - a kiddy sandbox that comes with a lid (to keep rain and pests out)
reactivedogs,ff71gzk,t3_eryu1x,1579639241.0,"I don't think there's too much of a downside to medication, but I know a lot of vets prefer weaning dogs off of fluoxetine/Prozac once they have been able to make progress with training on the drug. So unless you have visitors over a lot/would have visitors over a lot as a training opportunity once the fluoxetine takes effect, I wonder if you'd be better off with just giving him a more ""incident-specific"" drug like Trazodone prior to having visitors. FWIW, trazodone zonked my dog out like crazy the first few times she took it, but now it doesn't. She uses it almost daily though, which I think causes it to have less of a sedative effect than dogs who only occasionally take it.

With that said, I think if you want to put your dog on fluoxetine that seems totally fine, especially since it could help with the reactivity on walks to the extent that it's still a problem for you.

Good luck!!"
reactivedogs,ff6j7iz,t3_ers4g1,1579628354.0,"We're five weeks into fluoxetine. Despite some real ups and downs (yesterday was BAD) there seems to be an improvement in that her reactions are usually shorter and less intense than they were before. BUT, starting two days ago, I've noticed that she seems a little more skittish inside with me, where she hasn't been before. E.g. jumping up if she's lying down and I walk past her too close (she tends to lie in the middle of the hallway or doorways and has never minded in the past if I step over her) or if I drop something and it makes a noise.

I'm a tad concerned, but I'll see if it's just a fluke."
dogs,ff3s6ke,t3_erhml3,1579547698.0,"I think management is going to be the safest course of action - tell your mom to feed the dogs separately and not leave the bowls out once they are finished eating. Also, even if your dog is currently fine with your older dog, it's probably best if you do this at home as well."
dogs,ff3rpy7,t1_ff3rbsm,1579547415.0,"That's a very good point, thanks. If I decide to do this I might do cat litter for the majority and some soil on top, and try to transition her to less and less soil as she gets used to it."
dogs,ff3om9t,t1_ff3ocfp,1579545522.0,"Oh, I didn't mean I'd store it under my bed haha - just that that's the style of bin I would use. But yeah, I know smell would be an issue, in my mind having a lid would contain that but you're right that it might not. 

Thanks for the input!"
reactivedogs,ff3h0qb,t3_eravso,1579540848.0,"Just had a walk that started out fine, but devolved into terrible reaction over reaction in the last half-block to my apartment. All this while a building resident standing outside the building dog park just like... stared judgmentally. 

I'm feeling pretty awful about it, I had sort of felt like we were starting to make progress on her medication but this morning's walk (coupled with some reactions yesterday) are so discouraging. I of course made myself be upbeat with my pup as I navigated her back in to the apartment, but now I'm just sitting here feeling sad and resentful, which I know isn't fair or productive. 

Having a reactive dog sucks, y'all."
