3) Trying....

4) No contracts, that's a big part of our business. All the employees and the owner are over 50 (probably 60) and they often forget what they're told anyways. A big part of the ""I just don't like change"" mentality is not absorbing new information on anything.

I'm just at a loss on what to say. It's 99% email communication and as you can see, he's just a dick about it now. 

I'm about ready to call and tell him we're done, but I have a great reputation here and I don't want a detractor. So frustrated..... I was firm the last time he emailed me that he was losing priority status and not to send me a message of this sort again. Yet. Here we are....."
WhatDoISayNow,ffxg49v,t1_ffxeikb,1580324455.0,"They've gotten two free fixes already, breaking different things each time. In reality, very little has changed. It's simply his employees (or him) screwing with things. So it's a good thought, but it's been done.

This is I think the fifth aggressive email. I come out and fix things and he's very personable. I agree escalation is bad, hence me posting here, but I have no idea what to say. Before writing this I had half a mind to tell him I'm not coming back, and we're no longer his provider.

Gotta do a lot of repairs to make up for that, and even then you have to sell a shitton of stuff every year to keep it.

Still, you could be a bit of an empath. It would be worth getting into meditation to help strengthen it, if you want to.

I would also recommend creepyhollows.com for some inspiration. My Wicca wife has spent way too much there lol.... 

Something a lot of people don't realize is that its all about intent, and you don't have to do everything exactly the same as everyone else. 

Take for example, the cross. I see it as a highly evil symbol. According to those who use them, the cross is what Jesus was killed on and that makes it holy. I disagree, and crosses make me suspect vileness that you often see associated with Catholics. They're an evil organization, and that's their symbol.

But take someone who doesn't think that, maybe even you, and try to use it as a holy symbol. It works! Because they are intending a holy symbol. 

Another example is the pentagram, which is not actually an evil symbol. It's supposed to connect you to the Earth, and is wonderful for grounding spells. The only reason it's demonized is because Wicca is demonized.
