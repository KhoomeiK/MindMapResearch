And I can technically do flashpoints. I've done some story mode ones. I plan to give up on vets for a while though. Every group I've come across has been toxic."
swtor,fetrlzh,t1_fet8482,1579379030.0,"No, I've avoided most of them since I wanted to give planets another pass later. I'll have to do more of those, thanks."
swtor,fetrkcu,t1_fesmxnw,1579378997.0,"I've been skipping the planetary stories to see how far it could get me (clearly not that far) so I'll have to go do some of them.

I did try my companion as heals for a while. I'll go back to doing that and see how much it helps. I've been flip-flopping between defense and vigilance, but I think I'll stick to vigilance from now on."

asl,fepe0jv,t1_fepdsew,1579318184.0,I knew it! I used to be Vice President so everything in your post clicked. There are a lot of beginners in the club so you don’t need to worry. Gally will be fun too if you decide to go.
asl,fejrhyz,t3_epj2ef,1579184029.0,"Most ASL clubs welcome all levels, so just do the best you can. A lot of club activities help practice new signs or useful skills to help improve your ASL.

Side note: You don’t happen to go to UAkron do you?"
college,fef2g8y,t1_fef2etb,1579046600.0,Good luck!
college,fef24wb,t1_fef20xh,1579046391.0,"That's better than what I was thinking, but still a ton though imo. I just recommend caution especially if you're unhappy. The price tag is far too expensive to not be satisfied."
college,fef1o3p,t1_fe8qgs3,1579046080.0,"Yep, even though I live with family, I really just don't want to be at my uni. It sucks to start off the semester with such a bad mindset. :("
college,fef1fz7,t3_eor3ve,1579045930.0,"Completely normal. I'm a sophomore too and feel the same way. Honestly I would seriously think about why you're feeling that way. Your roommate sounds very inconsiderate. Maybe you could look into different housing accommodations? Also that is a TON of debt you're in already. If you do plan on transferring, definitely find somewhere a lot cheaper. $50k after only one year can cripple you in the future unfortunately."
college,fef17si,t3_eotr9m,1579045776.0,"From an academic perspective, fine. From my perspective, awful. Don't want to be there anymore. I wish my feelings hadn't come on so late so I would have had time to transfer."
college,feez1zg,t3_eosmpt,1579044366.0,No impact really. Also check the pre-med sub.
college,fedgb4y,t1_fe6knmx,1579010748.0,This is really inspiring. I have a similar story and I’m considering transferring to online uni because I hate where I’m going and I dislike all the frills. Thank you for sharing :)
college,fedftjy,t3_eofo2p,1579010362.0,"I still felt unhappy. Just didn’t want to be there even though I did the work. Feels like high school. Also since I’m in a new major, most people seem to already have impenetrable friend groups. I’m an extrovert and social, but my first day felt oppressive as always."
college,fedfmmm,t3_eo5gcl,1579010212.0,"Yep, feeling just like you. I dreaded going back to school, and after my first day, I still dreaded it. I’ve always been unhappy here, bouncing to different majors and between wanting to drop out or transfer. I feel like I’ve become less idealistic and more realistic (or pessimistic? Possibly.) College feels like public high school all over again and I hate it. I transferred to online high school at the end of my sophomore year and loved it. Wondering if I should do the same thing..."
college,fdxbcro,t1_fdx6i34,1578767151.0,"I wish I could read my course syllabi, but sadly my classes don't open on BrightSpace until Monday when classes begin. And wow, good luck. My situation's the opposite. Last semester I was studying biology so I had labs, but this semester I'm studying English so there will definitely be a ton of papers and reading."
college,fdvh133,t3_emncdl,1578747345.0,"I would seriously consider taking a gap year to work, spend time with your family, and figure out what you want to do. I wish I would have taken a gap year because I wasted my first year not knowing what I wanted to do and being unhappy in college (still am unhappy r.i.p). Follow the path that is best for you, not a lifescript."
college,fdt26v8,t1_fdsx6l5,1578710953.0,Don’t be afraid to talk to them anyway. You can find friends anywhere. Maybe there is an older students club on your campus?
college,fdspeip,t1_fdsnllj,1578706230.0,"Aw, sorry to hear that. I know that you can overcome anything that troubles you. It’s also okay to cry, and to let out your emotions."
college,fds4ol7,t1_fds3z2c,1578694281.0,"I’m an English major now, after putting myself through engineering and biology for a year and a half to no success. :)"

crueltyfree,fcajej1,t3_egwl3z,1577570325.0,I would just use it and not buy it in the future.
college,fc4hnl7,t1_fc4b5cv,1577416933.0,"Not sure what you mean, it doesn’t cost me anything to change."
