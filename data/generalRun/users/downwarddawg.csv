aww,fe38q3t,t1_fe2yr49,1578847011.0,"What is wonderful is you have her/him right now, have provided a loving home for two decades and are well aware of how lucky you are. Enjoy every moment, as I’m sure you are, and when the time comes, allow yourself to grieve, but also celebrate that because of you and the relationship that you shared, this wonderful soul was allowed to blossom and live a long, happy and healthy life, knowing how loved they always were.  When I think of my cat, someone reminded me to say “thank you” to her in my mind. I’m so thankful I had the experience of loving her every day and so blessed to have had her in my life for so long. I’ve been sad, but the blow is softened over time knowing how lucky I’ve been, and how lucky she was too.  A lot of animals live and die without ever experiencing a love like that. A lot of humans too."
