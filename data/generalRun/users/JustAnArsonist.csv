We dont usually just assume that we can talk to people that way, a lot of it is just that guys dont often form the types of relationships where their friends are people they can talk to like that. Its not that they have bad friends, we just generally dont bring up stuff like that. Thats just the way guys are I guess, but I make an effort to be there for my friends as best I can. If some people were after one of my boys, I'd have their back no matter what, but I cant beat the mental illness out of them.

I know very little about how any of this works, but if you could actually make sure all the money went where it's supposed to, it would be an amazing plan. Instead of fighting and losing money and time trying to get rid of weed, let's start selling it and use the extra cash to feed people. Genius man, we need more people like you.
