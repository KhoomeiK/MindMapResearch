1.Stick with glasses and a few different shapes. They actually compliment the curvature of your face.

2. Obviously smiling goes a long way and it's crazy how that can make one more attractive, even if it's forced in public to help break the ice with possibly meeting new friends (even if you're still feeling depressed).

3. Make up. It's one of my biggest pet peeves I see on this sub thrown around by (from what I assume) are guys just saying you need some. This is a 50/50 for me. You have already an amazing complexion so while in this case I would absolutely go with dark eyeliner I wouldn't go overboard with top much of anything else. See what matches your skintone and use a few of those products that makes it look like you're barely wearing any. 

4. Highlight your biggest feature which are your eyes. Certain glasses and eye makeup will help with that. Also....I know it's a big fad right now to go basic with parting your hair straight down the middle but it isn't doing you any favors. You have absolutely beautiful healthy hair but If you're going to keep it straight then sweep a bit more starting to part a few inches to the right of center and bring it all over to the other side. Give your hair a bit of volume and bounce but NOT with hairspray...only the techniques out there (there are some amazing YouTube videos how to make straight hair look full and thicker when wearing straight down).

You already have longer lips going for you (but not too thick) which is also a great strength you can play with just try not to go overboard.

Lastly (and take this however you want it's just my opinion my wife used to work in this arena for years), research and keep finding clothes that go with your body style. I know the higher Jean look is in Right now but you have a great longer frame that you can do so incredibly much with. They may be hard to find however this is just starting to come back into style and I think they would look amazing on you. Basically low rider flared camo pants(and jeans). Something similar to this would look stunning with the right shirt.  [lowrider camo pants](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/53/f9/03/53f903cd2880eaab3ba845a073774ef5.jpg)

gamingsuggestions,ff00rxe,t1_fexr051,1579463970.0,"I second this. Guild Wars 2 has put so much content to do at max level it’s astounding. 

Also, stay away from GW2 subreddit it’s full of toxic peeps bitching about not getting new fractals/raids when areanet has told them they’re focusing more on other content to do in the game and most people love it (and prefer it to more raids).

I just got a friend and her daughter started in it and would gladly show you the ropes.

A few things about the other MMOs mentioned (imho) as I’ve played them all for years.

1. WoW is clearly the most popular but has the most toxic player base and the whole game is about grinding for what you want (even more than it used to be)...but hands down the best MMO if you want to be a hardcore progressive raider/heroics and care about being top dps (because everyone else cares and that’s all they talk about and monitor)

2. SWTOR has the best leveling story line of any MMO and IMO was amazing until they decided not to put money into upgrading their graphics (and yes they could have) but instead spent it on char customizations and skins and such. It’s hard to find a hardcore player base these days because so many people have dropped off.

FF14 and it’s expansions aren’t extremely Asian looking and TBH I’m not a fan of the gameplay/combat system. I know I’ll get mowed for this and I’m not bashing the game but I just find the mechanics of combat extremely unwhelming and I just can’t get past it. It’s also a darker game as a whole (the lighting is darker and I feel like time hasn’t to it). It’s got a huge player base still though if you find out you enjoy it.

In my opinion those are the only top contenders right now since BDO massive XP nerf made a lot of people upset and I saw that player base drop quite a bit. BDO is literally the definition of grind and always being online for your professions (some people love that though)

childfree,fcltxuw,t1_fckxalb,1577756385.0,"Alright....I got to ask this because I’ve seen so many posts like this lately.

Does most of this sub hate children? So many of you refer to kids as all of these derogatory terms and it’s honestly got me on the brink of leaving this sub. 

There isn’t anything wrong with kids or parents who have them. That is their choice and I respect that. I’m on this subreddit because my wife and I decided it wasn’t a desire of ours to have and raise our own but are extremely involved in my 10 nieces and nephews lives...but when I see insecure posts about a parent who was possibly having a bad moment/day and possibly exhausted and the CF individual needing to try and make up for it by posting about orgies extremely over the top.  Those parents do love their kids (most of them)....and it was absolutely worth it for them I would never assume or come online and post how it wasn’t worth it for them to have human beings of their own. 

Can’t the majority of you go about this from a respectful and mature point of view and just have your statement ready about why CF is the best for you instead of bashing those that did? Can we possibly bring a bit of love to people especially the kids which most of them didn’t get a choice in any of this.

I honestly hope most CF’ers aren’t as shallow and judgemetal as they make themselves out to be by their posts lately. There’s absolutely *nothing wrong* with having kids if that’s the right decision for them....but what I’ve picked up on is so many of you are so ready and raring to pick a fight based on a lot of statements that are taken out of context it’s made many of you cursing kids who haven’t had the chance to mature yet and are just being kids.

AskReddit,fclsf54,t1_fcloriz,1577755329.0,"The thing is...some of them are and some aren’t. Depending on your workout regime and the brand and type of supplements many are extremely effective and reputable. It’s all about balance and the knowledge of products and how you’re using them.

For instance hydroxycut was extremely effective before it was banned but overweight and out of shape people took it and couldn’t match the drive when it kicked in and had issues because of it. It’s clearly not meant for certain people at beginning stages of workouts but ya know..,,welcome to the land of lawsuits and stuff being pulled from shelves.

Many proteins are excellent in a lot more nutrients and aminos than just having extra protein when it comes to what your body needs after an intense bodybuilding session.

When I was a personal trainer and needed to cut for the summer I did an extremely well thought out regime of an ECY stack (ephedrine from primatene and caffeine and yohimbine in certain doses really helps you shred and if you use it only for x amounts of weeks it can provide amazing results. Then again you have to keep your cardio/workout regime at a level commensurate to the product.

I understand the frustrations hands down you made some great points...and I know you aren't looking to leave but sometimes it's nice to step away for a bit or change things up with a new MMO foe just a few months to come back invigorated.

aww,fc70lkw,t1_fc6uryl,1577494344.0,"Just so everyone’s aware....here in the Midwest there is only ONE type of pet insurance and even though you pay every month we have a 5k deductible (at least) for any major surgery and that doesn’t cover PT. So yeah you’re looking at 7-10k easy even with insurance most of them aren’t even worth it.

Also to the poor guy getting downvoted for suggesting other puppies for that price....I get it. I love my Great Dane she is basically our child but she’s also a dog...i cannot spend 5k for her to have a major surgery plus therapy knowing I can respectfully send her off in peace and when I. Ready learn to love again with another pet.

Pets aren’t humans. I love the crap out of mine but I won’t put my family in debt for one."

If that fails and you have the money, I'd hire a Private Investagator."
