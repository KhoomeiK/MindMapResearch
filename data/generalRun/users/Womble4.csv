CasualUK,fgfp80o,t1_fgfka0q,1580744488.0,Not too bad on the carbon cock print too. Think they’re pretty economical.
Guitar,fgesqau,t3_ey2507,1580708660.0,"It’s all about 

1. Practice
2. Not giving up
3. Patience

Frustration I suspect is the reason people give up. 

So my advice is to stay motivated. I used to try and work out how to play the music of my favourite artists. Listening, watching videos of them playing live. 

If you can stay motivated, you’ll do fine."
