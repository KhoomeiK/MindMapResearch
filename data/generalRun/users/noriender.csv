I oppose private insurance as well and can from personal experience tell you that having both private and public insurances is not a good idea. You basically introduce a two-class healthcare system.

I'm not a wildlife rehabber (unfortunately) but you are correct in assuming that it's not a pet mouse. 

I saved him from being accidentally burned in a campfire where he must have already been at least an hour without his mother. I put him near where I found him but his mother didn't show up (we waited and checked on him). So I took him in and handraised him together with my family. Against all odds, he survived (he was at most 8 days old when we found him and their chances of survival are not great when found that young). 

He was way too tame to be released back into the wild (and he is a bank vole, which are not rare or protected) so we kept him. I moved out of my parents' home for university in September and took him with me. I tried socialising him with other mice from his species (I actually found someone who breeds them and doesn't live that far away) because even though he is male they usually get along with other males very well as long as there are no females around. But no matter how much I tried, he prefers the company of humans to other mice. So he has his tank all to himself now. :)

Meanwhile, my family is taking care of a hedgehog that was too small to survive the winter on its own (he will be released back into the wild though!) and my father had handraised a mouse before so I feel like we're hobby wildlife rehabbers lol.
