vandwellers,ffpc4m4,t3_euftpy,1580091353.0,Get the van. Stop paying rent. Get a job that supports the van life. You'll be happy.
CampingGear,ffpbuq5,t3_eug3i2,1580091160.0,"My vote is for DIY alcohol stoves. HEET+can+lighter. If I need a new stove I can just make one. I don't use my stoves on the summit, just to cook and heat water in parking lots. Your mileage may vary. I agree it's nice to have instant gas, but yellow Heet is $1.50 at gas stations, Walmart, etc. Fuel availability is the most important thing for me when using my stove on the road."
LSD,feh87rc,t3_ep3bgp,1579111167.0,Cats take a week or two to adapt to a new environment. Give your cat more time to bond with you beforehand. You'll get much more out of all this if you adopt the cat for the sole reason of adopting a cat.
