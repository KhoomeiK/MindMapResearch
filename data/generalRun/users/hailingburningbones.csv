travel,ffglx5h,t3_etew87,1579909286.0,"London is my favourite as well. So beautiful, so much to do, and i have lots of friends there. I try to go once a year, and miss it when I'm away!"
beer,fff14l0,t1_fff0m2f,1579872803.0,Nice! Yes it's a lot of fun for everyone! You could have some hops in your hair or bouquet as well!
beer,fff0e1t,t3_et8bwr,1579872172.0,"My now husband and i own a brewery, so we got married there. Only thing we did differently, though, was a beer ceremony at the end. He'd made a special beer for the wedding. We also had photos taken in front of a wall of kegs that have our logo on them. Other than that (and free beer for the guests) it wasn't beer-related at all, but our whole lives are beer-related! Best of luck to you!"

AskReddit,ffbbv2r,t1_ff96a33,1579758935.0,That one gets in my head fairly often (though I'm happily married). Such a great song.
AskReddit,ffbbp38,t1_ffaenp5,1579758761.0,Such a beautiful song on an amazing album.
AskReddit,ffbbo3c,t1_ff90ow7,1579758731.0,Anytime i hear T. Rex it puts a big smile on my face. Marc was taken from this world way too soon. Last year I visited the shrine at the spot where he died. So sad.
grunge,ffb8kvt,t3_es92ys,1579755098.0,"I've seen Singles more than any other movie, including at the theater when it was released. I last watched it just hours before Chris died. I was supposed to fly to Denver the next day to see SG (a few days later). I haven't been able to watch it since."

arcticmonkeys,fehmm9j,t3_ep31vu,1579119616.0,"""And to tear apart the ties that bind,  perhaps 'fuck off' might be too kind"".

I used OP's in my wedding vows, and it was the only part where i got choked up. My husband and i met as friends after i answered his ad in ""Strictly Platonic"" on Craigslist. We were just friends for a few hours, and have been a couple ever since! (11.5 years!)"

beer,feckg3m,t1_fecjlf2,1578976093.0,"I believe that's because we don't make enough of those more limited beers to reach every market. I don't work there, though, so I'll let my husband u/jpellett251 elaborate! Thank you for loving our beers!"
beer,fecj02d,t1_fechnq9,1578975080.0,I'm sorry to hear that. United is our distributor for Georgia. Care to elaborate? :)
beer,feceq5m,t3_eodytj,1578972155.0,"I live in Atlanta and the best part is Orpheus Brewing. Of course I'm a little biased since I'm an owner and my husband is the brewmaster. But it's pretty fucking awesome!

Also The Porter and Brick Store Pub are here, which are widely considered to be two of the best beer bars in the world. We also have a lot of other great breweries and beer bars, too. Atlanta is a highly underrated beer city!"
