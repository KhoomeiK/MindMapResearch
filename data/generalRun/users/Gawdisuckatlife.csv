depression,fdpr779,t3_els6qu,1578637403.0,"Taking the time to look back n actually see that made it thru another year, even thru my darkest days, kinda does help.  Like, Im still learning to accept that I'm going to have those days and they will be super painful, but here I am!  I made it thru and I'm going to make it thru the bad times this year, and the next, and the next.  I just really hope that I can heal some of those wounds to grow thru the hard times vs eroding?  Not sure how to describe it but I'm still holding onto hope.  And that's gotta be something!"
depression,fdpqx7u,t1_fdji3pz,1578637115.0,I just wanted to say thank you for this reply.  I think a lot of us fight our demons everyday.  It really helps just hearing that those of us struggling at times are not alone.  Just wanted to say thank you.
depression,fdpqo6z,t3_elwlee,1578636854.0,"Give yourself permission to rest, what you're going thru is valid and you need to take care of yourself.  Just remember, even if someone else doesn't get it, they do not have to carry out the everyday tasks you will, so take care of you and do not place pleasing those individuals before your own self care.  Take care of you, and remember, you're important and have a right to be here and a purpose."
depression,fdlcgnz,t1_fdlb84m,1578521066.0,Yeah its kind of a nightmare with no hope of ever waking up
depression,fdjuqt3,t3_eloddk,1578488157.0,"Mine is like a play and everyone else has a script except for me, and I'm just walking around like messing things up and there's this huge communication barrier"
bulletjournal,fdc3r2s,t3_ekikx7,1578266524.0,That is beautiful!  Wow I love it!
depression,fd6bzcu,t3_cjjdc3,1578188646.0,I don't go to therapy tho.  Not anymore.
depression,fd5z51w,t1_fd1lluu,1578183339.0,Who would I report them to tho?
depression,fd5xedq,t1_fd5dyqv,1578182704.0,"But here's the thing, who do I tell?  I never asked for this it just took over my life so I have no clue who's ordering this n it feels as if someone's made a big mistake."
depression,fd1l6g9,t3_ejdrh2,1578132796.0,I'd give anything for some real help bc I'm hanging on by a thread.  I swear my meds have been tampered with and I'm quickly unraveling.  I need real help but I feel trapped.
depression,fd1ksvm,t1_fd1jz6y,1578132635.0,"I wish I could.  I have no way to pay for therapy, plus the last few times I tried I had bad experiences with so called professional.  I do need help but I literally have nobody that can truly help me.  I don't have any options.  The last time I tried therapy it seemed entirely staged n I got the sense the social worker was trying to intimidate me and being accusational.  I never went back."
depression,fd039zn,t1_f1wuavl,1578112993.0,Is it possible to be forced into this therapy without consent?  Bc I think this almost sounds like my life..
depression,fd02vgq,t3_cjjdc3,1578112828.0,"Yes, you completely described something I've been dealing with but I have no idea what it was, yet this is my life.  Like I'm forced into a restaurant I don't even want to be at, and forced to eat cat piss, but whenever I try to leave or talk about the cat pee, it's like I get punished with more cat pee and never allowed to leave!"
depression,fczzxz1,t3_ejqql6,1578111534.0,"I want to tell you to keep trying, but sometimes you just need to catch a break after trying so fucking hard.  Give yourself permission to take a break maybe.  I know I have to on my worste days, I literally cannot make anyone else happy on those days and I have to just be depressed.  Idk if this is helpful or not but I'm in a very similar situation.  It sucks.  If you can get the strength to get out of bed, take a hot shower, or like, read a book n escape for awhile.  If you can't get out of bed then you are allowed to just breathe, and sometimes just staying alive is an accomplishment most ppl don't understand or know."
depression,fczyrwc,t3_ejqyi5,1578110951.0,Happy bday
depression,fczy2k6,t3_ejdrh2,1578110602.0,I feel like I shouldn't have opened up after reading this.  But not having a single person to ever talk to when I cannot fix myself seems to make it worse.  I don't see any options.
depression,fczhmp2,t3_eji660,1578101446.0,Thank you for posting this.  I was just trying to explain this to someone today and how I feel stuck.  It's just nice to see that it's not just me.

depression,fcsndd0,t1_fcsn940,1577920317.0,I'm completely useless.
depression,fcsn940,t1_fcsmy2w,1577920232.0,"My kids would be devastated, I can't think about the pain I'd cause them.  Everyone else tho...I'd be doing them a service."
depression,fcrk978,t3_eikc8e,1577902912.0,I feel this.  Like all the way.  At what point does hope just become denial?
depression,fcrhyp7,t3_eihb2v,1577902055.0,"That is such a compassionate way of thinking.  Even in such a dark place you think of others.  I wish I wasn't so bitter, thank you for the perspective.  I mean it honestly."
depression,fcrew73,t3_eidxlt,1577900902.0,"Lol do the opposite?  Trust me, smiling when you feel like dying only makes you feel even more resentful and in pain.  Now you're not just sad but you're also denying the injury and for what?  To make it more comfortable for the people who don't want to deal with the inconveniences of being in the presence of actual feelings?  Wtf.  Just deny yourself your feelings.  Great philosophy. It doesn't work I can promise you that.  Been forced to live that way for a long time n I'm more fucked up than ever."
depression,fcrcv8u,t3_eihb2v,1577900123.0,Yeah...GARY.
