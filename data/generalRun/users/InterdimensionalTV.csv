Recently AMD came along with some new stuff that has blown Intel out of the water. Now there’s real competition and it can only benefit the consumer.

It’s not as bad as when I was younger though and it got better after I got my nose cauterized. 

I will also add that having your nose cauterized is less so painful and more just a really really uncomfortable feeling experience. Though it could be different for you. Like I said they stick a tool in there and expand your nostril so the doctor can work. Then they take a q-tip with silver nitrate on it and use it to chemically burn shut whatever wound is causing your problems. Then you can’t blow your nose for like a day or so. I could be wrong but I don’t remember them numbing anything to get it done as it’s a fairly quick process.

Though I will say I never resorted to stealing to fund my habit, I just skipped out on a lot of bills and fucked my credit up. I’m not saying if you’ve got an addict in your life that you should let them get away with whatever they want. My cousin was hooked on heroin at one point and was kicked out by both her mom and dad at separate points because she kept stealing. Nobody blamed them for that. Even so, they still did their best to try and help but they understood there’s only so much they could do. In the end though, my cousin always knew her parents loved and cared about her. Once she realized it was time and she wanted to get better, she knew she had help and she’s been clean for a while now. On the other side of that I have some old family friends who kicked their son out of the house when they found out he tried smoking crack at a house party. They cut off all contact with him and said it was for his own good. A month later they got a phone call. Someone found him dead in a gutter in the nearest big city to me with a needle in his arm.

I could be wrong but I have a feeling you’ve never felt what it’s like to truly be addicted to something. If you had you’d fully understand how powerless it makes you feel. Even though I quit taking pills a long time ago now, at least once a day my brain butts in with “hey wouldn’t it be great if we were high as shit on some Oxy right now?” That will likely never stop happening no matter how hard I try. I’ve even denied pain meds since I quit so you’d think I’m fully over it, but no.

I understand why you feel the way you do, but if you truly think people should give smoking up then being empathetic and understanding is the best way to do it.

In the beginning you have less games on record so one or two good games might be all it takes to skew whatever magic number IW uses far enough upward to put you into lobbies with much better people. As time goes on everything should eventually even out if you play enough and a good or bad game shouldn’t really have near as much of an impact on your “ELO” or whatever. It makes sense that you’re seeing what you are if the system operates in a logical way. 

I kinda hope they keep whatever data they gather on your skill for the next iteration of CoD.

Mine exists almost purely for show it seems like. The company does what it wants and the people close to retirement agree to horrible contracts that cut wages and benefits in return for cash when they retire. Another workplace near me just completely de-unionized due to some very shady back room deals. Of course the most senior members of said union suddenly became quite well off.

We literally have a clause in our union contract, that the union fucking approved, that says we are not allowed to strike or demonstrate. I’m sure you can see the problem with this. It has essentially taken away all power from the union as the company can just fire anyone who talks of striking. The company does whatever it wants and will continue to. The company wants me to work a couple months straight? They can and have and I have no way to fight it even though the amount of OT I can be forced to work is supposed to be limited. The worst part of all it is the older, close to retirement people agreed to it and they agreed to cut wages down for hires after 2010 by $6 or more an hour and they also agreed to abolish pensions for the same group of people. Why you ask? Oh when they retire they get extra money depending on how long they’ve worked for the company. In return myself and all the other newer people coming get completely and utterly fucked. Even if I work there for life I’ll never make a wage anywhere close to theirs and my benefits and pay cut off the day I walk out. Of course theirs doesn’t though.

To clarify, I agree about the vehicle tracking thing so I’m commenting on that. No thank you I don’t need to be tracked.
