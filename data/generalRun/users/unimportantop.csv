college,ffgw2cj,t1_ffgtw1l,1579916524.0,"A lot of this depends on the college you go to but I currently feel this way. I was well above a 3.5 in high school, at my university they grade on the curve and the median is about 2.7-2.9 for most courses, even lower in other classes, which is what the vast majority of people get.  

The biggest thing about this is that *it's the average among 3.5+ high school students*, meaning in order to get a 4.0 you have to be the cream of the crop of already the best students, not just the general population. So if you're performing only slightly worse then the already best students you might be sitting at a 2.5.

Honestly I would never do it myself because my mom intentionally put all the burden raising us by herself (she's stubborn and didn't want to deal with guys/marriage) and I feel like she carried that burden onto us despite not being stable enough to deal with all of us.

Also sperm banks are grossly unregulated. Many have no limits on number of children that can be born, no checks on the people wanting children (my mom was financially but otherwise unready parent), and you're dooming kids to be raised with identity crisis w/o fathers  and not knowing their bio dad until late adolescence(although I don't feel that crisis myself). Really it should he for infertile couples w/ checks to see that they are completely ready for children and no one else. And they need to better check the people donating also.

Edit- while it should be primarily for couples I can understand someone's intent to have children w/o being in a relationship. But banks should check that those recieving donations have other adults for their future children's upbringings because I didn't get that and I think it's necessary."

He was curious about me, he had done the DNA test shortly before me turning 18 (I'm the youngest we knew he didn't donate for long) I think he was keeping track. I learned he's a professor with good credentials, and enjoys living in foreign countries like I do. 

Your father might have not recieved much information about you, as I was surprised how little my donor knew about his kids, I had to inform him about the half sister I knew about, which might be why he hasn't contacted you yet. Wait until your 18 to contact if you aren't already OP.

I still have a lot to learn about my donor father but it's very worth it OP just to discover more about yourself. Who ever it is will probably suspect you're curious, as mine did.

I don't agree with what his gf was doing but his lashback was a stoop lower than what she was doing, although he might have not realized that.
