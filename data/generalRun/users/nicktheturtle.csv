tarot,ffkdw8y,t1_ffirxsj,1580021161.0,"I thought I’d posted an edit, it didn’t go through! Sorry about that. 

For me, taking a moment before a reading (especially personal ones) and acknowledging the outcomes that you do want to see, that you *don’t* want to see, and maybe even taking a moment to think about what outcome you wouldn’t expect. 

This is obviously not as intuitive as the reading* itself, but I personally find it to be a great way to analyze myself and my motivations, and leave the divination more separate from myself. It allows me to use divination like tarot reading as a much more powerful tool than if I didn’t do this practice. 

Generally, I don’t do readings *that* frequently. Maybe once every few months. But when I do use it, it is incredibly helpful, powerful, and effective."

bipolar,fffm5tm,t1_fffjlwv,1579886943.0,"Actually... he *can* help it. Like I said, we’re accountable for our actions. I have a list of mental conditions as long as my forearm, everything from autism and CPTSD to BPD. And if my partner where to tell me I was making him unhappy, it would be my job to figure out my behavior. You’ll get the same accountability from most adults who are aware of their illnesses, and probably most of the ones on here too. 

Do you consider yourself happy? Does this relationship make you happy? Have you expressed how these actions take a toll on you? If you have, what is his reaction? This does not seem like a relationship that would encourage your personal growth and support your needs and aspirations. 

I’ve been with my partner for 4 years. I’m 20, but don’t let that deceive you— I’ve had my fair share of horrible relationships with other people. Be it romantic, parental, friendships that were manipulative— I think that being 33 and being afraid of “staring over” is a pretty flimsy reason to stay in a relationship that doesn’t meet your needs (if that is the case here), to be honest. We only have one life, and we *all* deserve to be allowed to make the best of it.

It might be good for you to take some time and figure out what exactly you would want out of a relationship. Do you want kids? Do you want to get married? Do you have aspirations and preferences, or did you have different ones before you got with this guy? What are the pros and cons of the relationship? What kinds of things do you actively enjoy about your life with him, what actively hurts you? What can you work on, what do you think he’s contributing? Just taking some time and trying to figure out your priorities separate from everything else can really help put into perspective whatever steps need to be taken to improve the situation. 

Going to couple’s therapy is one option. It doesn’t really mater if he thinks “they’re all cons” because in my experience, that’s something people usually say when they are afraid of doing work on themselves. It’s not even uncommon, but it does freeze any and all personal growth. If it’s important to you, he should be on board with you. That’s just how partnerships work. 

Another option is getting yourself into therapy on your own, which could help you even if he doesn’t get involved. 

I really wish the best for you, I know how difficult this place can be, but I want to let you know that there’s no such thing as too late, too far gone, too little. Any amount of improvement is better than no amount of improvement."

bipolar,fffhca1,t3_etcnva,1579883972.0,"He’s not really being fair to you. This is a highly stressful and chaotic situation for anyone to be in, and it isn’t healthy for you in the slightest. If he doesn’t see anything wrong with his behavior, that’s a huge red flag. 

Ultimately regardless of what mental health issues we do or don’t have, we are 100% accountable for our actions, and his actions are incredibly unhealthy and toxic. He can’t be treating you like that— what’s your long-term plan? Keep up like this while he continues to refuse to get help? This sounds like a relationship from hell honestly, and I don’t imagine it’s good for your own health."
socialskills,fffgrtm,t3_etco42,1579883620.0,"Yeah, you’re wrong. Friends need to feel important to people they care about. Never sharing anything about yourself, especially when your friends *do* share things about themselves, puts people off and makes them feel unimportant. You aren’t letting anyone in, and anyone who’s a halfway decent friend will feel frustrated by that. 

It’s not okay to expect someone to talk to you while at the same time never opening up to them about anything that matters to you. It creates an imbalance and makes people feel like you don’t trust them, don’t value their judgment, or  maybe even have something to hide."

ADHD,ff5bdc4,t3_erprud,1579586090.0,"At some point your family has to be more willing to accept symptoms of your personality. So what if you talk a little loud sometimes. You shouldn’t feel personally guilty for something that is kind-of just a symptom. 

That said, and as someone who’s really bad at it, I’m an advocate for mindfulness (I have aspergers and adhd, I’m *really bad at it*) because it does help me feel a little more in control when I’m overwhelmed by external stimuli, and it helps me regulate my responses to things too. 

Another thing I believe really helps is actually greek philosophy of stoicism. It’s more about lessening emotional reactions that can mess up your judgement, but I personally find that this and mindfulness work together seamlessly and I have a little more of a handle on things than I did before I started working on these two things."
ftm,ff5axho,t3_erpvta,1579585654.0,"Hey, have our considered getting professional help? As someone who’s been through it, I can only tell you that this isn’t how it has to be. You don’t have to live in perpetual self-hatred, and more of your issues very likely have to do with the context your life has had so far. Growing up without any kind of support can be insidiously damaging in so many ways, and no one deserves to struggle this much with something about their identity. 

It’s possible to be transgender and happy. I do it, my fiancé does it, so many people who are trans can and do live happy and successful lives. I heavily urge you to seek out professional help, particularly from lgbt resources aimed towards survivors of conversion therapy."
gay,ff59wt8,t3_erpx2d,1579584676.0,"It’s ok to be gay, and honestly not getting too hung up on it, working on just allowing whatever you are to be as it is, will help lots regardless of what your sexuality is. It’s easy to be super shaken up by the idea that you’re somehow not right, or something about you is different than you want, but ultimately none of the details matter. Who you are, is just one person in billions, which means there’s no way to do it wrong. Even if you’re gay.

ftm,fewbr47,t3_eqrc62,1579408062.0,"Yeah unless she has a pattern of this kind of behavior AND you’ve brought it up with her, you might be reading too much into it. Worst thing you could do is just get more talkative about gender and how it’s all made up and that sports are for losers. You’re into that REAL man shit, [whatever other interests you have]. The point is NOT changing your interests or personality, and sometimes cis people have unconsciously incorrect understandings about transition just like we do. 

She might’ve even said it trying to be supportive, if not misguided. Kinda like my math class friend who started calling me “bro” way too much after I came out. He was dumb, but sweet af. 

I also wanna suggest finding ways to be more confident and centered, in order to let things like this (even if they were meant in a nasty way) roll off easier. It’s always gonna suck if you feel someone you love doesn’t get you, but it’s easier with a more stable and certain center in all scenarios. The study of Stoicism personally works well for me and feeling masculine is a bonus for it."
