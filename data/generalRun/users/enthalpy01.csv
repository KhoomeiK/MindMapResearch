TwoXChromosomes,ffh23h1,t1_fffqqeg,1579921038.0,An abortion is just the end of a pregnancy. Having a dilation and extraction after a miscarriage is also an abortion. A miscarriage itself is a natural abortion. It’s just a technical term.
TwoXChromosomes,ffh1ynm,t1_fffvdpp,1579920936.0,"Yes, I was under the blissfully naive impression that pregnancies in our modern world were oh so safe. I went into my first pregnancy very unaware of the danger I put myself in. My other two pregnancies I went in with my eyes wide open well aware I was risking my life for theirs, but that was my choice to make. More education about pregnancies and complications as part of sex Ed is needed."
