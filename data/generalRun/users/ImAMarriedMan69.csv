DecidingToBeBetter,feecw4a,t3_eoni7c,1579031155.0,"First of all I’m proud you for even thinking about quitting and trying to quit before. It’s def not easy I know this, as I decided to stop smoking a while ago, and it’s def been difficult staying away from it. I live with my fiancée so there isn’t anyone stopping me from buying it and smoking whenever I want to, but I tell myself that this discipline will pay off for me eventually. I don’t want anything to hinder me from making more money and reaching my goals. 

A few things, if you do want to quit and stay off of it you have to eliminate anything in your life that enables you. Delete your dealers number, and stop hanging around people who also smoke. Talk with your girl, this is big. You cannot be around anyone who smokes right now, because you’ll get right back into it. If your girl doesn’t want to stop I’m sorry to say that you need to either spend less time with her or just end the relationship. 

You can def do this but it’ll be extremely difficult. It’ll take a lot of disciple but will bring you so much freedom in the future."

I don’t read books at all, the way I like to learn new things is through watching videos online. I’d much rather see and hear a person talk, than read something they wrote. Also, you don’t need to force yourself to do anything."
getdisciplined,fdcrpqk,t3_ekhv6y,1578282418.0,"Some advice for you, try to get off of social media it’s literally made to keep you scrolling and scrolling and scrolling. I went off of it for about a month, and when I went back I started right back on that habit again. Ask yourself this, do you really care about what the hell is on Instagram? It’s the most pointless content out there. This post has made me want to get off of social media again, think I’ll delete them now! Just delete them, it’ll be hard the first couple of days because you’ll need to find something to fill all of that time with."
getdisciplined,fdcreds,t3_ejxtz0,1578282179.0,"Honestly you need to find what time is best for you to wake up, sometimes I try to wake up earlier than normal but I just find myself being exhausted and irritable. I head back to sleep for another hour or so and I feel great and ready to take on the day. Just experiment with it."
relationship_advice,fb8ly13,t3_ebwnsp,1576616776.0,"Hey I see people giving you a lot shit here, I won’t do that. I get where you’re coming from, my wife deals with depression and often times I have to handle most of the responsibility for cooking and cleaning, and just keeping our place in order. I have told her many times that she needs to step up and often have handled things wrong, so it’s ok if you mess up. I often snap at her for not pushing hard enough and for pushing to hard so I’ve been there. We both just need to find that happy middle ground I guess, good luck!"
