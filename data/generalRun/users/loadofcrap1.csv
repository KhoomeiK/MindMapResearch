There is a reason that alot of doctors don't accept Medicare. And still, someone has to make up the massive cost of this. Who?"
AdviceAnimals,ffpi6x7,t1_ffpfct1,1580095647.0,"Of course thats how you would translate it. If I was only concerned with myself, why would I give a shit about peoole wanting America to go to a socialist healthcare system? My evidence is no more anecdotal than your belief in a system that has failed in every other country that tried it. Does it work on paper? Sure! Maybe do a little homework of your own and check the income tax rates in those countries. Unless you're willing to work your ass off and give 40% or more of it to the government to fund that healthcare system for all of your unemployed countrymen, then you should probably stop trying to convince me that its a good idea."
