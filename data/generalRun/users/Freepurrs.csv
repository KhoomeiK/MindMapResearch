The manuals were not current or detailed about the systems and changes b/c pilots were told they didn’t really need to understand these operator-independent systems. Two test pilots (who weren’t just Boeing employees, they still fly for other airlines) had a text msg exchange following a simulator session, essentially saying “this sucks, it’s going to cause errors, the project leader is clueless, but whatever that’s just how it is here”

Edit: for more facts and less speculation on the mcas stuff, I’ve been following a barebones YT channel called blancolirio run by an airline 777 pilot & trained aircraft mechanic Juan Brown. He reviews the actual testimony, technical manuals and NTSB reports. (It’s informative, but not very slicky produced)."

*Until the fume event the captain had always been reliable, trustworthy, friendly and skilled throughout his career of more than 30 years. His health had been impeccable. His reputation over all the years was impeccable, collegues were generally talking well about him.*

*However, following the fume event, after the captain returned to work following the fume event, the collegues noticed that the captain became increasingly dithering and unreliable. The captain lost eye and hand coordination as well as threedimensional perceiption. One day the captain parked his aircraft in such a way, that the crew taking the aircraft over the next day feared the captain might have been intoxicated.*

*And then the autopsy report starts mentioning that on the day of his passing the captain was about to be handcuffed by police when he collapsed and died. Police had been called on scene by witnesses reporting the captain had attempted to kidnap a woman on open street in the middle of their town and was in a physical struggle with her. When police arrived he attempted to flee and hide, but was caught.*

*The coroner stated he found: ""No evidence of significant trauma (superficial blunt force injuries identified on head, torso, extremities; multiple injuries from resuscitative attempts)"", ""Microscopic evidence of acute myocardial infarction (24 hours or less in age)"", ""Cardiac interstitial and perivascular fibrosis"" and added: ""Possible exposure to organophosphates during airline flight, July, 2015"".*"

Absolutely no one wants this. It’s a metaphor. The phrase got traction b/c PM Scott Morrison has his head in the sand during a crisis. When called out for staying on vacation in Hawaii while Australia faces record setting temps and wildfires, the PRIME MINISTER basically said “there’s nothing I can do there, I can’t pick up a hose.” 

The point is that there’s a lot that a political leader CAN do in times of crisis like mobilize resources, increase funding for emergency efforts, and enlist foreign aid (Firefighting teams and water bomber planes have come in from other countries in the past). 

If nothing else, he can give moral support to people left homeless & make sure relief areas have medical support. Or he can just fake some empathy, instead of making the families of firefighters who’ve died hear him justify 3 extra days on a tropical beach while the country is in flames. 

Not only does this asshole “leader” fail to lead, but he’s now DENIED emergency funding for political reasons.

No one wants him to grab a hose. He just needs to do his fucking job or get off the pot."

It’s a difficult question because you want to respect the decedent’s privacy and wishes, but police do have to investigate & seek an identity if possible because there is often a missing persons report out there, and people with mental illness may be considered “endangered missing”. Many criminals have also committed suicide without ID. There have been many Does who committed suicide anonymously (or under a fake ID) that truly had people who cared about them, but the circumstances that lead someone to suicide (or go on the run), can also make people believe that people don’t care about them. 

.

Some Does who were identified post-suicide were: Lyle Stevik (alias), Lori Ruff (alias, had a young daughter), Joseph Newton Chandler (alias, had 2 young sons when he originally left), [Gail DeLano (faked her disappearance & committed suicide in another state, had 2 young sons)](https://unsolvedmysteries.fandom.com/wiki/Gail_DeLano)."
