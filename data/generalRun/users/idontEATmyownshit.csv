lgbt,ff2i02r,t3_eqx63w,1579506984.0,"I'm sort of scared? (don't know if that's the right way to put it) to say that I'm trans... I'm genderfluid and haven't gotten any reassignment surgery as of now and the dysphoria comes and goes sort of randomly (though it is pretty agonizing on the days it is there). I really respect binary trans people and found that a lot of them are very uncomfortable with nonbinary people identifying as trans, to say the least. I honestly don't mind nonbinary not being considered trans? Especially when it illicits such a visceral response to the people I've interacted with..."
