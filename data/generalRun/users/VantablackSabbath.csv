geopolitics,ff3qbkl,t1_ff3pg3u,1579546559.0,"Nope, major religion all the way from Kabul to Samarkand, and from taxila to Lhasa was Buddhism until Islam came. And saying the region was paganism and not Hinduism is just dumb and pedantic. Hinduism never called itself that, and the Vedas had already been written by that time"
geopolitics,ff3mnnn,t1_ff3gedk,1579544311.0,"Yes, but it's justifiable to hang the serial killer. 

And saying that saying that islamist rule over Kashmir is justified because Muslims are a majority there, when that majority was achieved through the genocide of infidels which even continues upto today, that IS justifying genocide."
geopolitics,ff3fvut,t1_ff3fbtn,1579540210.0,"And in another hundred years, natives will be Hindus again. If you can excuse one genocide you can excuse another. If Islamic conquest if Kashmir is justifiable, so is Hindu reconquest."
geopolitics,ff3e3to,t1_ff352en,1579539235.0,"""always"" is last 100 years? Kashmir has a 5000 year history, throughout which it was predominantly Hindu. It only became muslim after Islamic conquests where Hindus and Buddhists were genocided, which even continues till present day, look up what happened to the kashmiri pandits. Nothing is owed to kashmiri islamists"

todayilearned,fcx5emh,t1_fcws83r,1578051965.0,"But ""Indian"" isn't a language. And even if they were, it just confirms that even Indians had managed to form trade routes with it, like Magellan was doing

Also, I think it was known long before Magellan that the Earth was round, wasn't that why columbus decided to go west anyway?"

Documentaries,fcpgr57,t1_fcp3c89,1577863311.0,"I was speaking hypothetically, I don't actually wanta theocratic country. What I was pointing out is the hypocrisy in that when Muslims want it it's fine, but literally anyone else then it gets cashed xenophobia or islamophobia or fascism or whatever. Why storage standards for Muslims, they're not special in any way."
