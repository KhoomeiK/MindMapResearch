MicrosoftRewards,fgmd20s,t1_fgm8ay1,1580922228.0,Dailies just got added. So 11 AM CST may be the refresh time.
MicrosoftRewards,fgm8ew0,t1_fgm8ay1,1580919881.0,Cool thank you! I’ll also check around 5 pm CST to see.
MicrosoftRewards,fgm2gzy,t1_fglrvya,1580916651.0,Question - have your dailies refreshed yet? I completed mine last night and this morning I have nothing under my daily quests. I’m wondering if it’s a 24 hour cycle or divided by calendar days.
MicrosoftRewards,fgluowy,t1_fgj8zs0,1580911374.0,I had the same issue last night. Checked again this morning and everything appears to be working.
fatlogic,fgilewg,t3_eygtep,1580824990.0,So if you’re fat and live long enough to get heart disease you’re set? Where the fuck do I sign up?
MicrosoftRewards,fghil7q,t1_fghibbt,1580785633.0,This. I can’t tell you how many times I had to spam the button to get it to register
insanepeoplefacebook,fgg3ppc,t3_ey4nbi,1580753584.0,"America, because fuck learning other languages!"
ATBGE,fg7jkts,t3_ex9max,1580594078.0,"I think it looks pretty dope man, this is far from awful taste"
iamatotalpieceofshit,ffql70k,t1_ffqkubf,1580137582.0,You’re “making a joke” about scamming someone whose dog was needlessly killed on a sub about calling people out for being shitty. Learn to read your audience if you want to make jokes and not get downvoted.
iamatotalpieceofshit,ffqj2st,t1_ffqggdf,1580135986.0,I think doing that would also make someone a total piece of shit.
iamatotalpieceofshit,ffi737w,t1_ffhet81,1579966815.0,"I see your point and I think it has some merit, but take another example into account. If you call in a fake bomb threat, you will get in trouble because (among other things) you’re inciting fear of danger to a person or group of people. If you threaten to rape someone, you’re mostly doing the same thing. Granted it’s on a much smaller scale, but I still think there’s justification here. The solution is simple, don’t publicly threaten to rape, kill, or otherwise harm someone. You can hate someone for their views and express that hate in a number of ways that doesn’t directly implicate you in potentially breaking the law."
madlads,ff7l9if,t3_ersuay,1579652233.0,But wouldn’t the first guy voted out cause a stir when he inevitably asks why the show is continuing considering since he’s straight?
iamverybadass,ff7cibk,t1_ff752vd,1579646360.0,Bruh you’re double overhanding 455 and you don’t think your forearms are impressive? You got body dysmorphia
iamverybadass,ff6y964,t1_ff6xe7w,1579637355.0,"Yup, not to mention a double overhand grip with pretty average forearms. Chalked up or not you should be seeing some good pump and vascularity on a double overhand 405 pull."
iamverybadass,ff6w6p8,t1_ff6vafw,1579636139.0,"Look at his legs, he’s not deading 405."
Cringetopia,ff64os0,t1_ff5zaen,1579619052.0,"People are going to believe what they want to believe, facts usually just get in the way of that. I can’t image functioning in the world with this kind of mentality. I imagine it’s a scared and angry existence and that’s going to be the self-built jail they’ll have to live in until they die or decide to challenge their beliefs."
Soundbars,fezmggb,t3_eqvvwz,1579458994.0,Sorry to throw a 3rd option in the ring but the JBL Bar 3.1 has blown me away and it should meet your criteria. The soundstage that this bar presents has blown me away. Solid and impactful bass and clear mids to the point where I don’t need to use subtitles anymore. As an added bonus the subwoofer can either be connected to the sound bar via an aux cable or Bluetooth. The Bluetooth connection is great and really helps with being able to put the sub wherever you want without any wires poking out.
insanepeoplefacebook,fesscq0,t3_eqfq3b,1579368522.0,I’d bet my entire life savings that this person also frequently calls others snowflakes.
fatlogic,fekad4d,t3_epjq71,1579195915.0,So I see you’re taking the “hope I develop a healthy relationship with food before I get diabetes” approach. Best of luck with that.
fatlogic,fehbe87,t3_eotyif,1579113078.0,Pretty sure the fitness industry is doing fine. It’s resolutioner season once again and my gym is swarmed with out of shape people who pay for a year membership and maybe go for two months. Not really “coming for your jobs” so much as “helping fund more staff.”
OopsDidntMeanTo,fegma4v,t1_feg8m4t,1579097078.0,It’s just a bunch of people who can’t get laid pretending it would be their choice to turn this person down.
HolUp,fdq8g2f,t1_fdq8ccv,1578659155.0,"Sorry, I thought I was answering your question about the ACA. You are aware that you brought the ACA up in conversation and that he is trying to repeal it right? These are just facts, I’m not making a straw man here."
HolUp,fdq5bm0,t1_fdq43ao,1578655522.0,The thing that Trump’s repealing despite large backlash from people in impoverished areas because they’re going to lose coverage and not be able to afford to get it back? Solid argument bud.
HolUp,fdq572j,t1_fdq476x,1578655360.0,"That’s the most anti-American ideology ever. Our founding fathers saw a land that needed to be changed from a legal perspective so they fought for it. You can love a country and admit that it has flaws. If they had just left because they didn’t like things, we’d still be a British colony. Maybe that education you got wasn’t so hot since you can’t even remember how this country came to be. Not surprising since our education system also sucks ass."
HolUp,fdpcknj,t1_fdp066k,1578625225.0,"You don’t have to agree with Bernie Sanders on everything, but you should be able to recognize that our healthcare system is fucked."
Cringetopia,fdenymj,t3_eku1ux,1578343012.0,I too support the idea of dropping furries into an active war zone.
KidsAreFuckingStupid,fam9fqa,t3_e9qm7d,1576198768.0,Still beats playing Division 2 imo (at least I think that’s what’s under Elf)
