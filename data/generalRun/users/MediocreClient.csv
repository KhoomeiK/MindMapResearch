.... basically all of it. all of it is perfectly admissible. as far as your plea for ""first-hand evidence"", you and the Democratic party are on the same side, asking why the Republican Senate refuses to allow first-hand testimony. kinda makes you go *hmm*, doesn't it? refuse to allow first-hand testimony, then bitching that there's no first-hand testimony. fucking bizarro world up in here."
