I have few online friends but all of them are tired of me because i have no life when I am home and people dont really have time for me. The loneliness slowly kills. I think the problem is me now. I am 22 almost 23 now. I played too much video games, watched shitload of anime, read lota of manga, watched kdrama lots of them. Now i am just bored of everything. I think suicide will be the only thing that stops how i feel. Hopefully you arent like me."
