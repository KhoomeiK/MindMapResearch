For me, accepting this was a snowball that started with quitting smoking that ended up with losing lots of weight, getting a great job I love and being consistent in the gym.   

I'd tried to quit smoking for years. I would go a day/two days/a week... Cave, smoke. ""Well I've ruined all my progress now, might as well give up.""    

What made it stick was focusing on the cigarettes I didn't smoke, rather than the ones I did. ""I used to smoke 30 a day. I haven't smoked for six days. That's 180 cigarettes. I smoked 5 today because I was stressed. I'm still 215 cigarettes down from where I was.""

One, people are used to an overweight you - so the change is noticeable.  

Two, people in a calorie deficit tend to lose weight from the face. The face becomes drawn and they get a 'hungry' look. (I notice it in myself.)     

When you hit goalweight and transition to maintenance, the face 'fluffs' up a little bit. New people - those that never knew the overweight you - won't even comment on your weight, or if they do, they'll assume you've always been in shape.

LifeProTips,fck14s5,t3_ehafa2,1577713353.0,"I was food shopping a couple of weeks ago. A youngish guy in front of me, had some kind of learning difficulties. Paid for his shopping with a lot of small coins. Probably all the money he had in the world. He counted it out very slowly (I've worked as a cashier before, don't know why she wouldn't count it for him - she had to count it right after)... didn't have enough, had to work out what to leave etc etc.    

Couple of middle-aged Karens behind me were huffing and puffing, exasperated laughing when he lost count and had to start again etc etc. I turned and gave them a death glare, but it didn't seem to shame them. I didn't want to shame the guy by openly calling them out.   

When he'd finished, he moved only a small step away to pack his backpack. Cashier apologised for the wait, so of course, I replied something like, ""Oh, it's fine, I'm in no rush.""    

Then my petty revenge mode kicked in.    

Firstly, I took absolutely ages packing my bags. Everything placed in 'just so', re-arranged etc.    

Next of course came the 'Do you have a loyalty card?' Nope, I don't.  What do they get me? Where can I get one? Is it possible to get one now before I checkout? Oh, you can sign me up right now? Let's do that. Phone number? Hang on, I never remember it... let me check my phone. Email? Let me check my phone again, I never remember it.      

The Karens had figured out what I was doing at this point and were stood in stony silence. The cashier had a bit of a smirk.    

Then the pièce de résistance. I'd been to the pub the night before and still had a massive pocket full of change. I'd normally throw this in a Coinstar machine (was planning to on the way out.) But now?     

""£17.30? I think I've got that, hang on.""    

""10p... 20p... 30p..."" ""Oh, I've lost count. Start again.""  A few minutes later, ""I'm short £1.20. Can I pay with this and top it up with my debit card?""     

By this point, the Karens had re-packed their trollies and moved to another checkout. It was glorious."
