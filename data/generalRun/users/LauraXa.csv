Damnthatsinteresting,fdzsn69,t3_en97v1,1578794847.0,"This is so cool! I love capybaras, they are so chill! I grew up in brazil and in my city there were a lot of capybaras close to a lake. They were always just chilling there, not caring about anything or anyone. But it's good to remember that they are wild animals and they will bite if you get too close. They also can carry diseases, deadly ones, so it's best to avoid the wild ones. But I'd looooveeeeee to play with one, they are so cute"
JusticeServed,fdgcwtu,t1_fdeh2vp,1578390701.0,"In brazil a few years ago there was a case of a guy that ran over a biker, ripped his arm out, and drove away with the arm attached to his windshield, and after threw the arm in a river! They found the arm a couple hours later and the doctors said that if the driver had stopped they could've reattached the arm. Now there's a guy out there, who was a painter, without his right arm, because an asshole decided not to stop. The father of the driver found out and brought him to the police, but I'm not sure what happened to him.
EDIT: Found what happened, he had to do 2 years of prison, in a ""open regime"", which is when they are allowed to leave the prison during the day to work and have to come back at night. He also had to pay 50 minimum wages to the family of the victim... So, basically nothing happened..."

todayilearned,fdb8f86,t1_fd3vt9a,1578254867.0,In the beginning of our relationship I would come to visit my husband and stay with him at his parents house. His dad would invite all his friends to come meet me and parade me around like a zoo animal. When he had friends over I would refuse to go downstairs
todayilearned,fd2zyhn,t1_fd2wm1g,1578153387.0,"My father in law wants me to have kids because I'm Brazilian and they are dutch and he wants ""exotic"" grandkids, his words. And all the time he says he's gonna help us take care of the child. He didn't do shit to raise the kids, they don't even remember him playing with them, not even once, and the grandchildren he has now he does the same. Doesn't give a shit about them and he tells me he will help? I roll my eyes so hard when he says that I see my brain"
