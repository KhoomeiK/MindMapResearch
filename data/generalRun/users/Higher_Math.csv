ATC,ffckcqc,t1_fef5zd3,1579801302.0,That's why you make it effective the day the bill is signed into law.
waiting_to_try,ffcj5u9,t3_er2sbc,1579800584.0,I'm a fed father due in June/July. I'm gonna try not signing my child's birth certificate and legally adopting them October 1st 2020. Gonna talk to a lawyer and see what exactly I have to do to do it all by the books. We would have waited to try but had no idea this was gonna be a thing. Hoping they remove the effective date as it's kindof crazy. For example the national age increase to 21 for tobacco products went into effect immediately.

fednews,feva2fu,t1_fdegit4,1579394964.0,I may seriously consider consulting a lawyer about this very thing when the time comes. We are due in June/July but I could potentially just wait until October 1St to Legally adopt if that is a possible thing. Who knows!!!
fednews,fempobx,t3_eonowu,1579265885.0,"I will contact the people you advised about this. We are expecting in June/July and while I am not optimistic about my chances, I want my voice to be heard. I don't think an effective date of October 1st 2020 is really fair to anybody. It should be effective immediately following signing of the bill. They could do it with raising the age to purchase tobacco products. Hopefully I am able to take advantage of the benefit!"

canada,fdvej08,t1_fdvczvu,1578746619.0,Okay here's the thing. Nobody is given authority to shoot a missile at an airliner just on their own. You make a group decision to fire. You are trying to make excuses for a horrific act of violence.
