No, it's absolutely critical to the conversation and undermines the entire misconception you have about what is and isn't capitalism. I'm guessing you've read no or very little political theory.

There are numerous economic systems that are not capitalism and involve trade.

>The spread of capitalism and civilization are highly correlated.

No - again, you're conflating trade and capitalism. Not to mention population. The most powerful driver of progress is population not the economic model. Not just total population but also density. Lastly correlation is not causation even if your premise weren't flawed.

>That still doesn't change the history of our species and that capitalism has plainly been a major driving force for the process of civilization.

Do you happen to have access to another identical universe where socialism took over in the 1900s to compare the march of progress to? Are you still considering everything with trade to be capitalism when for most of recorded history it was semi-centralized planning where a handful of lords owned everything including the people ultimately. Quite a bit of progress occurred during this period as you may be aware.

>I didn't say that. In fact I specifically suggested the process would have been significantly slower.

No, you said both and didn't directly state which you believed which is why I said the idea was laughable and asked you. Who's not reading here?

>There's pretty good arguments that without it civilization in a general sense never would have happened or at least at nowhere near the pace of how it has occurred.

No evidence of *why* it would be slower, just a baseless assumption.

>Almost all of the other systems require some sort of strong highly functional well intentioned centralized government which is even currently an arguably speculative concept.

Almost every other system *was* a primarily centrally planned economy not free trade with private ownership of the means of production. A handful of kings and their nobility owned nearly everything for most of recorded history. Any definition of capitalism that includes that as part of it is so broad as to be worthless and again circling back to 'anything with trade is capitalism'.

>As I went over above capitalism literally is trade

Please at least read *some* political theory. Because it literally is not. You even said earlier that you acknowledge some economic systems involving trade aren't capitalism, I mean at least be internally consistent even if your logic is based on a flawed premise.

>Spare me the basic lessons on economics and my political alignment from here on out, I'm pretty certain I know more on those subjects than yourself. If you are going to assume I'm some misinformed fool again please just don't reply. Thanks.

Futurology,ffhtpj1,t1_ffhtfdx,1579953402.0,"You do understand the overwhelming majority of human history was spent as collectivist tribes right? Your first premise is objectively false to start with. Secondly capitalism is *not* trade. Capitalism is the private ownership of the means of production, you can have an economic system that includes trade but does not include private ownership of industry. You can have a direct democracy where the nation owns industry or you can mandate that ownership must be held by the workers, stakeholders rather than shareholders.

I'm trying to be informative rather than a dick here but you're clearly not far to the left given your conception of what is and isn't capitalism.

Furthermore the idea that without it civilization can't exist is pretty laughable - are you also one of the people that thinks no technological progress occurred outside of capitalist countries? Obviously things would have progressed differently but pretending you can be certain it either wouldn't have at all or even that it would have been slower is an assumption based on nothing.

>Just because it needs heavy regulation to be non-explotative

Profit is literally the difference between the value created by labor and what labor is paid and someone else takes. Capitalism is intrinsically exploitative, regulation literally cannot make it non-exploitative, at best it can reduce it marginally. When a capitalist gets paid for not doing any work that money literally can only come from workers creating that value."

As for costs I covered that with the subsidies comment - the amount of damage caused by ultimately human error when it comes to vehicles is astronomical.

Frankly that's because you're a child and you lack empathy. I also never want children and from my perspective I think they're annoying parasites but because I have developed empathy I can understand that people do have different views - having and raising children is a fundamental and desirable part of the human experience for most people and denying them that right because they are doing a job that needs to be done but we've decided not to pay them sufficiently for doing it is disgusting.

>I don’t see the problem in a huge portion of the population not having kids.

That's because you are one. Sharp population declines and eugenics are both really *really* bad for societies for different reasons. The former because modern countries have decided that they should take care of their elders rather than pushing them into ditches to die as soon as they aren't productive. An aging population spells economic disaster when older people rely on younger people to support them. The latter, well if you can't figure that out I'll never be able to explain it.

>If most black people don’t have money then the most financially beneficial choice would be to not reproduce.

Again with the soft peddling of eugenics. Children should never be forced to live in poverty, they are innocent in all of this and the government should never prevent people from having children just because ghouls like you hate children. The only solution is to help these people, not letting children suffer for the economic conditions of their parents that we allowed in the first place. There is enough wealth to ensure everyone that works is paid well above the poverty line and pretending otherwise just betrays a lack of understanding of economics. We did it decades ago and we're wealthier in absolute and per capita terms today than we were then.

>The rich are getting richer because they’re automizing

You're betraying a serious ignorance *again* here. The rich are getting richer because they're taking a larger share of the value of people's labor, automation is still in a fledgling state outside of very limited applications fields. People are more productive now than they ever have been yet labor earns a smaller and smaller portion of income every year, this isn't just automation it's the value of people's work being stolen from them.

>Soon all manufacturing jobs align with service jobs will cease to exist, and the rich will simply move.

You're really dense if you think taxing fairly instead of less than people who make next to nothing because of the cap on capital gains tax rates is going to cause them to flee first of all, we could double capital gains or even consider it income and the US would still have a lower effective tax rate than most of the developed world.

Either way most work jobs will be phased out in the coming decades - what is *your* solution, hope the rich decide to be generous? You're an imbecile if you think that's going to work, or do you think people who can't work in an automated society deserve to die?

>Replaceable jobs don’t matter much especially when you get bots replacing them.

Again, do the people doing those jobs now deserve to die?

>Important jobs that aren’t easily replaceable is where everything is it.

You're especially naive if you think there's enough work for everyone once automation enters full swing, nearly every office job can be done by computers that's including programming, machine learning can do jobs that take entire teams of varied disciplines to accomplish now. To say nothing of all the people who will never be capable of what little niche work is left.

>If someone can’t have kids then don’t have them.
