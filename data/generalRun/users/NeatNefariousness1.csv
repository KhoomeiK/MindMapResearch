nba,fftkjga,t1_ffrlrbz,1580222939.0,"This. I think you've hit on something important here. An earlier comment suggested that conspiracy theories develop because people find it comforting to believe they know the cause or source behind  unexplained events. 

My reaction is to find it horrifying to think that there are evil forces controlling things that can kill people at will. I find no comfort in that.

Your comment would suggest that the conspiracy nuts are NOT delusional. They are **peddling** delusion to make themselves or a cause they believe in SEEM all-powerful and to strike fear into the hearts of the masses who are struggling to come to terms with unexpected disasters. 

Some may do it to create terror--others because of hyper vigilant paranoia from having been targeted in the past"

She's from Finland, a socialistic country where there is a high minimum standard of living. She has no clue what it will take to live here and even if she was actually as hot as she is trying to become, her beauty  and inner peace won't be sufficient to help put food on the table, even after his parents give them a place to live.

AmItheAsshole,ffld4sy,t3_eu1ygi,1580038002.0,"NTA. Consider the fact that she likes your name and has had a lot of inner turmoil. She's not trying to be offensive but she is.

It seems that she is grappling with the fact that she stole her unique name from you and is looking for a way to make a stronger claim to the name because she knows she is NOT the original.

Tell her that friendship is a two-way street and it takes BEING a friend to GET a friend.  SHE is not being a good friend when she copies your name and now attempts to diminish you in an effort to distinguish herself so she can lay claim to a name she stole.

I suspect that she could be worried about seeming to be an imposter and choosing a name that she took from someone else in her circle may aggravate those feelings constantly. It may not be too late for her to consider a variation of the name you share so that she can settle into a name that doesn't trigger her. Just a thought."

After the first correction or two, posts and downvotes are just piling on.  It's boring to read post after post making the same (unoriginal) correction to someone who has made a typo, grammatical error or any other language error. 

 And yes, there are plenty of errors made by native English speakers--often more than those for whom English is a second or third language.  The same principles apply to them as well, IMO.  For me, it's not about which group makes more language errors. It's that the rude, over-the-top corrections people hurl at native speakers aren't interesting to begin with and IMO, they are out of place against non-native speakers after the 3rd correction. 

Anyone can learn from a correction or two but repeating the same criticism--especially for rules that most people are aware of -- loses its value quickly.  Our primary purpose here on Reddit is for the content that is specific to the subs we visit.
