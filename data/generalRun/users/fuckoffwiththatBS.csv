politics,ff9q09y,t1_ff9h4ny,1579718390.0,I bet if they put Trump ahead you would be believing and posting them. Am I right?
Showerthoughts,ff6ssy0,t1_ff5uipp,1579634145.0,That is chump change to start a business from scratch. Tou could burn through 300k in about a year or two easily with the costs of running even an online business.

quityourbullshit,ff472zx,t1_ff46vsz,1579556970.0,The lie is literally that I broke rule #3 when I literally stated no yes or no answers. It is literally quit your bullshit.
quityourbullshit,ff46zbe,t1_ff46vsz,1579556905.0,Except they let one post go and the other one not. I guess you want to be called out too. No worries. Hypocrisy at its best.
AskReddit,ff43a2c,t1_ff42l3c,1579554598.0,Great response! I agree the math does check out for a small sized 401k balance. I think I should have been more specific in responding to them saying that Trump was responsible for this growth. Show those markets from 2008 to now and you will see that the president has had no affect on it. It has been on a steady up tic for some time. But your math does make sense so thank you for providing that. The markets are in a constant upward motion with some low points every 10-12 years. I just feel like presidents should not take the credit for this either way.
AskReddit,ff42byi,t1_ff41pnd,1579554012.0,I admit I was wrong there.
AskReddit,ff41cg9,t1_ff40k3p,1579553402.0,"You said your 401k doubled in 3 years. Show how then. You are just gonna keep saying I do not know what I am talking about. I linked to actual data you instead gave anecdotal info that means nothing without anything backing it up. You literally said your 401k doubled because of Trump. That was your point. Yet now you agree that it has been going up since Obama saved us from a recession. You even admit it here. You have no clue what you are saying and instead projecting that on me.  Either calm down and post some info backing up your original claim of ""doubled in 3 years"" or admit that you lied.  I am having a discussion. You are making accusations and projecting."
AskReddit,ff40i5y,t1_ff3zz8j,1579552877.0,Another well thought out response. Thank you.
AskReddit,ff408sd,t1_ff3zqe1,1579552714.0,Great response. Thanks for being so thorough.
AskReddit,ff3zob5,t1_ff3zj9f,1579552363.0,It has been surprisingly civil. I like it.
AskReddit,ff3znao,t1_ff3zk24,1579552346.0,Good point. I wonder how that will effect the next election. Did they follow through on the relief or not? I am not in a farming area so its hard to see it from here.
AskReddit,ff3zjvu,t1_ff3z5e8,1579552287.0,"Thanks, I can understand this as a businessman. I just have not found living in a Blue state or city has hurt my business but I guess it is different everywhere you go."

AskReddit,ff3z062,t1_ff3yss8,1579551944.0,I do think that the two parties exist to give everyone the feeling of winning just long enough so that when its the others turn they don't rise up. All while most people do not benefit from either side. I tried to add another post asking why so many rich tech millionaires vote democrat when it hurts their business and bottom line but the sub would not let me so I need to rephrase the question.
AskReddit,ff3yu00,t1_ff3xhds,1579551835.0,Thanks for the response. Care to elaborate on your views? I am trying to discuss specifics but if you do not want to get into it further that is okay. I appreciate your response either way.
AskReddit,ff3ypfk,t1_ff3ycm1,1579551756.0,I agree that it is a natural cycle. So voting has almost no effect on it right?
AskReddit,ff3xdhc,t1_ff3wo8l,1579550925.0,Thanks for the heartfelt response.
AskReddit,ff3x721,t1_ff3wwkf,1579550814.0,"Of course my opinion is involved. I am asking the question.

Also all evidence on stock market growth shows a steady climb since 2008. Obama had the same climb rate as Trump has now. Care to explain? https://www.marketwatch.com/"
AskReddit,ff3wkeo,t1_ff3w4l9,1579550414.0,Thanks for the response. I would assume all of those points myself so I will say it doesn't add much to the discussion as something that vague could describe any voter in any country. Any specifics would help add to the discussion though.
AskReddit,ff3wdwa,t1_ff3w4tb,1579550303.0,"I agree that we need to look out for farmers and factory workers. As automation takes over these people need to be ready with new skills that they can contribute to jobs that we don't even have yet. Innovation is both good and bad and unfortunately they do feel they are left behind. I don't blame them there, both parties have left them behind for some time."
AskReddit,ff3w90u,t1_ff3w6hg,1579550219.0,I do think the politics of emotion have ruled for some time. Good point.

AskReddit,ff3tklk,t1_ff3tg0v,1579548554.0,Never said I was right. At least not in this post. If I have an opinion and they have one that is ok. I made this post to learn more about theirs. I am allowed to have my opinion just like everyone. However you did not give an actual answer to the question. Can you make some points that contribute?
AskReddit,ff3tfa1,t1_ff3t7qh,1579548463.0, Agreed. They are both just so old. I worry about that all the time.

AskReddit,ff3t1h3,t1_ff3sze4,1579548227.0,I would think so too. But honestly I do not know for sure. Maybe this time we will see the true fight that we deserved 3 years ago.
AskReddit,ff3sww3,t1_ff3sujn,1579548149.0,"While this makes sense. I agree she was terrible, there are better options on both sides. Trump was not the best republican, he was just the best showman during the campaign."

Edit: Personally stock growth like what I have seen in my own accounts does not reflect a country as a whole. Just so you know."
nottheonion,ff3sdgv,t3_erbflf,1579547816.0,Well it will. You just also have to be a bit lucky. That is the thing people don't want to address. Luck plays a huge role in this. I grew up poor as fuck. My parents are still poor. I didn't go to college but because of the friends and connections I made I have ran several businesses and escaped the poverty of my upbringing. But to think that it was just my hard work is a slap in the face to all those others that are still working hard and broke. I got lucky and I took that luck and did my best with it.
AskReddit,ff3s60g,t1_ff3s2e3,1579547689.0,Not gonna argue with that.
AskReddit,ff3s06e,t1_ff3roez,1579547588.0,"So what I said is nasty and adding to the divide. But what Trump says about people is ""just saying it how it is"" and a reason given by lots of people for why they vote Trump. Thanks for your input though."

Edit:https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/041015/what-rate-return-should-i-expect-my-401k.asp

AskReddit,ff3py6x,t1_ff3puvp,1579546333.0,Makes sense
AskReddit,ff3pqb5,t1_ff3peip,1579546198.0,"Temporary tax cuts. Permient ones for the rich. Employment up but not average income so I guess people are working 2 jobs or 3 jobs now. Taxes help middle and lower class so voting against their best heard. Dow and S&P have almost no effect on poor or middle class.

Edit: I was wrong to say that employment is affected by people working two jobs. This is a position Trump is right about as he has lowered unemployment from 4.7% to 3.6% currently. I would also note that unemployment was at 10% in 2007 (7.8% when sworn in) and down to 4.7% when obama left office so both presidents have seen a good decrease in the unemployment rates during their terms."

AskReddit,ff3oyb6,t1_ff3oqhi,1579545726.0,They will trash talk Bernie who is looking out for them while praising Trump. I hear them talk so much shit about privileged rich kids and then they keep voting them in. Trump embodies this more than anyone ever elected in my opinion.
AskReddit,ff3ol5k,t1_ff3og2q,1579545504.0,Most definitely.  Poor whites especially. I keep meeting folks that make 30k a year in retirement benefits and they vote republican. I guess fake family values are enough?
AskReddit,ff3od8f,t1_ff3oan5,1579545369.0,Yeah but chances are they will never get rich. Most only know labor jobs and have no ability or time to start a business. Edit: also why not just wait until you are rich to vote republican?
