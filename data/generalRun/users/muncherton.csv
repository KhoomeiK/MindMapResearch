confidence,ffrkc2f,t1_ffqwp7k,1580159794.0,I suppose for a males perspective in today’s society that may have some correlation. But I still personally wouldn’t advise anyone to have sex as a means to hopefully fix their confidence issues. I know that for many men and women alike it can be detrimental to mental health when engaging in intimacy for the wrong reasons.
confidence,ffqouvt,t1_ffqonc6,1580140170.0,"Yeah, I’m still asking the same question. I have had plenty of sex and am nowhere NEAR confident. I know this is true of virgins and non virgins alike. Having more sex does not make you more or less confident in yourself. Maybe you’re more confident about sex as an act itself. I’m genuinely confused here."
confidence,ffqoku7,t1_ffqcw64,1580139979.0,I’m sorry but this is just plain stupid. I don’t normally like to chime in on here if I’m not going to be saying something positive but I simply could not scroll past this one. What in the actual hell kind of correlation are you trying to make here? Really?
dachshunds,ffq4z4z,t3_eulvo0,1580120775.0,still a stinkin’ cute lil butt tho
astrology,ffq2vwy,t3_eui6cv,1580117409.0,"I’m excited for it. I hear it’s going to be so bright at night, that it will be similar to day. I’m curious how it will affect our nocturnal creatures though."
Meditation,ffm85n1,t1_fflmvde,1580050162.0,Do you mind elaborating on intentions a bit? Are you just stating affirmations of your intended purpose for your practice that day?

photocritique,ffh92rs,t1_ffh5fa7,1579926641.0,Well that’s feedback I can run with! Thank you :)
photocritique,ffh4m2m,t1_ffh3nfx,1579922976.0,"I have some basic experience in photography and I have learned here and there throughout school about all of those things. I’m not sure where you got the idea that I have zero knowledge whatsoever about iso, shutter speed etc. I also had to crop this photo to eliminate my watermark because I wasn’t sure if that was allowed here, which is also why it doesn’t follow the rule of thirds here. I’ll look at those YouTube vids though. I just like shooting in auto for simplicity sake and this was more to get in depth CC on a quick raw photo. What can you tell me about the focal length and exposure? I would appreciate your detailed feedback! :)"
photocritique,ffg3usi,t3_etg1il,1579897878.0,"I shot this just for fun

I used a kind of older DSLR that a friend gave me. I’m pretty amateur so I don’t really know what model it is

Shot this in auto on portrait mode I believe

Just looking for any suggestions really. Or the best places to educate myself on camera models more. I want to start taking more nature/wildlife photos. I also want to start vlogging soon too, so I want to invest in a decent camera kit, lenses and all. Any suggestions would be helpful. CC appreciated as well. Thanks"

nihilism,fffi9c4,t1_fffafqe,1579884542.0,Well that’s your interpretation. But that doesn’t make this “wrong.” Lol.

PetTheDamnDog,ffcclp6,t3_epinr7,1579796550.0,I believe you have your doggo set to hoppo. You need to reset it to walko. Refer to instruction manual for further explanation.
astrology,ffc898p,t1_ffc21f0,1579793805.0,They honestly give me anxiety. I don’t want to know that kind of stuff. That’s just bringing bad vibes if you ask me.
lawofattraction,ffc7zz0,t3_est62p,1579793640.0,Heck yeah!!!! Go OP!!! What did you tell yourself/the Universe while going through the interview process? I’m curious because I struggle with positive affirmations and things of that nature.
Empaths,ff8ny6p,t3_erjixo,1579688122.0,"I just found this sub. 

I’m extremely spacey, I will hear people talking to me and even somewhat take note of what they said, it’s like my brain understood it on one side, but the other side is so focused on whatever else is occupying it at the moment that I simply can’t respond or react to the person. Then they end up annoyed with me and repeating themselves.

I’m also extremely sensitive to others. I have very low self esteem because I care so much what others think. But it’s not just of me. I care about everything; no matter what someone does or says to me I either have little to no emotion towards it or I feel 100% full blown hyper-emotion.

I also have bouts of paranoia and anxiety that vary in intensity each day.

For awhile, I thought I have some serious mental health issues as I have experienced some trauma in my life here and there. I’ve recently been prescribed some medication to try to get “control” of my mind, but I can’t speak on the results yet.

After joining this sub and reading some of these posts, I’m starting to wonder if I’m just an extreme empath."
Empaths,ff8n8tm,t3_es0mcm,1579687040.0,"I would say, reach out to that temp agent again and say “Hey man, do you have ANY other options available for me right now?” And try to find something in a pinch before you leave this place. I’m sure I’m probably just reiterating what you already know, but just make sure you have another gig lined up before you cut off your current source of income. I do believe that you will take your leave when the time is right though. :)"
energy_work,ff8kv4v,t3_es5exc,1579683374.0,"Oof, I just graduated and I’m facing those student loans now too. So I feel you there. Rip. But, I’m rooting for you!! Sending happy and hopeful vibes your way :)"
cats,ff8kjuj,t1_ff8k41e,1579682905.0,"Goodness, sounds like you’ve been to hell and back. I’m so sorry for all of those issues that you’ve faced. Amazing how animals will come to your aid in your time of need though. I knew that cats have senses like that, but I didn’t know that the purring can help with the healing process. We’re so lucky to have such loyal creatures walking this journey with us!"
cats,ff8js0o,t1_ff8ik1k,1579681782.0,Can you expand on this a bit? This is intriguing. You use purring to heal physical wounds???

ContagiousLaughter,ff2cyl7,t1_ff23tlf,1579501160.0,"See, I’ve been a hobbyist photographer for years and just recently transitioned to working the other side of the camera occasionally, too. That’s why this kind of post makes me so angry. This is a cheap, creative way of getting a really cool effect in a photo for someone who can’t or maybe doesn’t want to go underwater and venture into the costly equipment that it would require to get a shot like this.

Some people are just being creative and having fun, and there’s always got to be people who come along and try to rain on the parade. I’m glad there are people like you and I who are on the same page here."
