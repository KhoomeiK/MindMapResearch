Your point isn't really valid as I never said I was 'only mad at Trump'. I didn't mention him in the first comment because I didn't need to, until you said I was 'directing my anger at Americans', which I clarified.

>My anger isn't directed at Americans in general, just the current selfish, idiotic, NHS-killing, snob Prime Minister and his twin brother, your current orange-faced, pussy-grabbing, war-starting imbecile President. As well as any Pharmaceutical company that helps screw over the NHS even more in future

I never backpedaled, either, just added to my point after you said 

>Trump isn't the pharmaceutical companies or that redditor

When in fact Trump's allies and himself wanted the NHS to be part of a trade deal. There's plenty of news articles/videos of Trump himself saying so.

>but of course most people in the UK are too ignorant to see past the wall of nationalist shit.

Sidenote - I got into an argument with an American on a reddit thread once, as the guy thought that having universal free healthcare 'isn't giving freedom' because people aren't 'choosing' to have it, to which I replied it wasn't a matter of choice, it's a *need*.

Edit: I know it's technically 'not free' because its obviously funded with taxation, but in terms of practicality it is, e.g you don't have to pay each time you visit the hospital/doctor for whatever reason, and this is most definitely preferable to countries without this system; such as the US, in which people often gain huge debt from paying for healthcare. So don't try and hit me with that 'ItS nOt fReE' BS. I know which one I prefer."

changemyview,fdgbodt,t1_fdfxe50,1578388878.0,"So not having free healtcare which is paid for by taxes and instead having to pay an exorbitant amount of money on health insurance instead (with it often leading to huge debt) is more free? Health care isn't a **""choice""** everyone needs it. It is a necessary thing.

That doesn't mean you can excuse what either country did - they started wars all over the world to, in reality, spread their influence and control under the premise of 'preserving' a country's ideology. Thousands of innocent people died in the many 'proxy' wars, just look at Vietnam and the USA's rolling thunder campaign. 

They're still doing it today - destabilising the middle east by invading Iraq. For what? Oil. They've even occupied oil plants in northern Iraq/Syria today. You can put a 'freedom' stamp on anything, but in reality the US is a capitalist country, and the basis of capitalism is working in your own self interest."
