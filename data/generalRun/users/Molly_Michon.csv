kevinandbean,fej3b73,t3_eoxyzj,1579155309.0,"He is only apologizing because this went viral. Even if he is telling the truth here, I don't believe he actually sees what's wrong with what he did and would 100% repeat it if this hadn't gotten him into some heat. Brad Williams was never that funny to begin with so no great loss as far as I'm concerned."
kevinandbean,fej2xtq,t1_fei3ckc,1579154918.0,It absolutely could be true. A man getting peed on is just as likely to be too embarrassed to report and press any charges.
