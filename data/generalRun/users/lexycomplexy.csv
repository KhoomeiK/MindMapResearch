BackYardChickens,fffgam4,t3_esxcwm,1579883324.0,Do you have any Cream Legbar Chickens. They have the head feathers and are not bantams.
BackYardChickens,ffdugkd,t3_esxcwm,1579829215.0,"It’s a Silkie serema, my friend has one just like it."
BackYardChickens,feav5zk,t1_feauhtb,1578952482.0,"Thank you for letting me know. I am glad that the surgery went well. I hope that she continues to heal up nicely. She is a really cute chicken. 

To reply to someone you chick on the curved arrow, then type in what you want to say. It took me a while to figure it out, but I finally did after a few weeks of being on reddit."
chickens,feauf79,t3_eo60wj,1578952250.0,I love that show on Netflix. I hope there is a season 3!!!!
crafts,featx6z,t3_eo4amx,1578952174.0,They look amazing!!!! Now I am hungry for berries.
BackYardChickens,feaqmca,t3_eo6bri,1578951386.0,I hope your chicken gets better soon. Be sure to post an update of how the surgery goes.
chickens,fe6aytx,t3_envskv,1578885818.0,It could be a scanned over injury too though. I have never seen one on that part of a chickens body. I usually use Vaseline for my girls. Do not use pain relieving Neosporin because chickens a very sensitive to pain relievers even if it’s just a little.
chickens,fe6aonz,t3_envskv,1578885612.0,"I’v never seen anything like that before and I have owned chickens for 8 years. It kind of looks like a blood blister that people get. If it is then don’t pop it. I would take her to the vet just to be sure that it isn’t something more serious. In the meantime you might want to quarantine her in an animal crate. Make sure that the bottom of the crate isn’t wire though so that she doesn’t hurt her feet. Quarantining her will prevent the other chickens from hurting her because chicken like to peck at things that are red, as well as injured and weaker chickens."
cats,fe69bod,t3_entppo,1578884646.0,Happy 14th birthday Steve!!!!
WeirdEggs,fe50u97,t3_enc93u,1578864631.0,Looks like a Batam sized egg.
chickens,fdslp95,t3_emwlh7,1578704814.0,If one has a Vitamin deficiency can also cause one to be smaller than the other. I would watch to make sure that they are both eating enough. If you notice that one is getting picked on then you can add more feeders. Also I have to feed my sister’s 8 year old Dark Brahma separately because she has arthritis. Feeding the one that is getting picked on separately might help.
chickens,fdrww9n,t3_emwlh7,1578690899.0,My friend has a rooster that had a father that was smaller then him. I think that it depends on how big or small Their relatives were and the size of the egg too.
chickens,fdrw1tr,t3_emwlh7,1578690615.0,"Batams are smaller versions of a bigger breed of chicken. True Bantams don’t have a bigger version of their breed though. Also Serema chickens come in class A, Class B, and Class C. Class C is the biggest and class A is the smallest. That is what I read in my books about chickens. I’m not sure if other breeds of chickens have class sizes, but I imagine that they probably do."
BackYardChickens,fdg9esc,t3_ekvsfd,1578385713.0,"Warm Epsom Salt soaks can help to relax her feet. I do that for my sisters 8 year old chicken sometimes. Also if your chicken has something stuck in her feet it can help. If nothing else works I would try to take her to a vet, preferably an avian vet."
BackYardChickens,fdg99df,t3_ekvsfd,1578385514.0,"It could also be osteoporosis, or arthritis. My sister has an 8 year old hen with either arthritis or osteoporosis. She walks funny though due to a toe with 2 toenails coming out of it. If your chickens toes are floppy and rubbery than that is a sign of osteoporosis."
BackYardChickens,fdfjojb,t3_ekvsfd,1578363284.0,It looks like maybe she broke her middle toes. Chickens can break their toes when they try to get up on the roost and don’t get a good grip so they accidentally fall off. They can also break their toes if the roost is too high up and they jump down and land wrong.
chickens,fdf8emw,t3_ekvrnz,1578355703.0,That is so cool!!!!
BackYardChickens,fd3c5ch,t3_ejxj2x,1578156839.0,The lighter colored one could be a Splash Silikie though.
BackYardChickens,fd3by71,t3_ejxj2x,1578156789.0,"I agree, they are Silkies, I believe that they are Blue Silkies."
pokemon,fcs7s3u,t3_eigk2c,1577912636.0,"Wow, that is really cool!!!! My sister likes to make things out of polymer clay. I love how accurate they are. I wish that I could make things out of clay that look as good as your Pokémon do."
chickens,fcnvlzb,t3_ehvqc7,1577819319.0,"I have a hen that crows like a rooster, she only crows every once in a while or when she gets up early and sees the sun come up. Other than that she lays eggs and is a normal hen."
chickens,fcnvc2f,t3_ehvqc7,1577819157.0,It looks like a hen to me.

cats,fc5x3b1,t3_egc3nl,1577467718.0,It reminds me of Sméagol from lord of the rings.
