Compared to other empires of history and of the same time period, the British empire was relatively progressive. It was the first nation to abolish slavery, and allowed native people to keep positions of power. The British empire wasn't some nationalist or ethnic world conquest, it was a bunch of massive corporations doing what corporations do best, exploiting the poor. Very much like the ""American Empire"" of today - many supposedly sovereign states today are pretty much controlled by the US because American corperations dominate it's economy and exploit their lower classes with cheap labour and natural resources."

So hating your country shouldn't be self hatred, unless you're personally responsible for the problems you hate about your country - which the majority of people aren't.

SelfAwarewolves,fejl0vv,t1_fein9kf,1579178468.0,"My understanding of ""white privilege"" is the idea that white people in the US and Europe have higher income and wealth on average compared to ethnic minorities. Which makes them privileged in the fact they can afford a better lifestyle, better education, etc. Besides that, isn't the very concept of ""white privilege"" proof that white people are discriminated against for being white? It's pretty ridiculous to claim they aren't. Perhaps you could claim they're discriminated against less - but even then, discrimination against white people is generally deemed as lot more acceptable and 'mainstream' than discrimination against other races. A really stupid mindset that people seem to adopt is that acknowledging discrimination against one group of people somehow negates the discrimination experienced by another group of people. The whole culture of these buzzwords like ""white privilege"" is really dangerous, because all it does is stir up a lot more racial tension than it resolves. People don't think logically, they hear ""white privilege"" and they create this non-existent entity in their head encompassing all white people which is evil, racist and wealthy. Either that or they create a non-existent entity in their head encompassing all non-white people which hates and attacks white people. Either way, all it does is create hatred for other people, most of whom you have no reason to hate. Categorising and grouping people in any way by race is a terrible and dangerous thing."

The human body is self-sustaining and can reproduce. It's so complex we can't even begin to understand all of it. Do you know of any computer that can instantly process a 576 megapixel image and nearly flawlessly identify every object in that image, and then instantly form reasoned opinions on those objects based on data from over a petabyte of information gathered from previous experiences? On the other hand, Atlas can do backflips and run, Asimo can pour a drink - so long as they're well maintained by humans, their batteries are recharged by humans, and they're not in slightly too warm, too cold or too wet conditions.
