 [Burrumbuttock Hay Runners ](https://www.mycause.com.au/page/219796/bhr-fire-disaster-drought-appeal) have been getting animal feed to farms in fire affected areas. 

[CFA](https://www.cfa.vic.gov.au/about/supporting-cfa) are the Victorian fire fighters.  

[Red Cross ](https://www.redcross.org.au/campaigns/disaster-relief-and-recovery-donate) have a disaster relief and recovery fund for the bushfire crisis. 

I might edit and add more as I find them. 

One other thing you can do this is lobby for action on climate change. Tell anybody, tell everybody, do what you can and push for those who  can do more to go ahead and do it. Climate change is making our fire seasons longer, hotter and drier, and it's reducing the window in which hazard reduction burns are safe to do between fire seasons.

In addition,  [The Burrumbuttock Hay Runners](https://www.mycause.com.au/page/219796/bhr-fire-disaster-drought-appeal) usually take animal feed to farmers in drought, but they're helping get feed to farmers impacted by fire at the moment. 

Apart from donating you can also lobby your government for action on climate change. Climate change is making our fire seasons longer, hotter and drier, and  reducing the window we have for safe hazard reduction burn in between fire seasons. All of  this impacts on our fires by making them burn bigger and more intense. We aren't even halfway through our current season and weve already had a larger area burned than ever before in recorded history. 

Australia  follows US lead in many ways. And climate change action is going to have to be a team effort.
