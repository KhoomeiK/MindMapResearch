She was then classified as coloured (a term in apathied south Africa). She had a very tragic story. Her white family never spoke to her again until her father's death and then rarely. Her first husband was abusive and she lived in extreme poverty. 

The apathied system was the complete repression of all non whites via strict laws on education, travel, access to legal services, hospitals, newspapers, housing, banking and private property.
