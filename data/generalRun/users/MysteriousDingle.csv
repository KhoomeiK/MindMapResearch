The first page alone simply lists your details such as name, address and contact information.

It was good by the standards of it’s time, but since then so much good stuff has come out that it’s now okay at best (and even then, only really the first season is really any good).

AskReddit,fdbi6w7,t1_fda3c9k,1578257608.0,"The first season was based on a collection of separate short stories, which I think may have contributed to the strange pacing, as well as the jumping to significantly different points in time between episodes, which many found jarring.

The spicy chicken meal they keep ordering always seems bland compared to the ‘hot’ advertised in the menu, so they asked you to make it even hotter because it still tastes plain to them. Anything advertised as hot in a menu implies spicy, because pretty much all food is served warmed up, the temperature is generally implied. Extra hot never means you the actual temperature of the meal, this should be obvious."

AskReddit,fd5r2kn,t3_da8dp3,1578180534.0,"A friend of mine used to work on a farm in the South African bushveld and part of his job was to deter rhino poachers (he was part of a small group). This was in the province formerly known as the Orange Free State. He told me this story and seems to genuinely believe it.

One night while on patrol they stopped to smoke a joint and just hang out. It’s hot out there in summer, even at night. Over time one of the girls comments that the temperature seemed to have dropped significantly, asking if anybody had a jersey she could borrow. So he turned around to reach into the back of the van and every hair on his entire body suddenly stood on end as he saw a tall figure standing on two legs staring at them from the bushes.

It looked to be over 7 feet tall and was very lean and lanky. It’s eyes were reflecting the light from the rear lights, and he describes its head as almost looking like a hyena or African bush dog.

He swore in shock and everybody turned around at the same time and went dead silent, sort-of paralyzed in fear. He says that he has seen a lot of wildlife but never anything like that. Apparently it didn’t invoke just the natural fear instinct in them but literally gave them a sense of pure unnatural dread, as if it was actually evil.

It took a step forward and that snapped them out of it and somebody shouted “ry, ry, ry!” (“drive, drive, drive” in Afrikaans) and they booked it out of there, adrenaline pumping.

Since then he has developed a fascination with mythology and thinks figures like the Egyptian god Anubis may have been inspired encounters with similar creatures."

TheDragonPrince,fcwv2d3,t1_f6nw33i,1578038818.0,"Exactly this. She seems to think her LGBTQ+ status gives her special privileges that allow her to go beyond the boundaries of her actual job.

TheDragonPrince,fcwukgj,t1_f6nhabd,1578038229.0,"Well it’s just a claim. It sounds to me like they weren’t writers but because they were lesbians they felt that they had a right to have a say in the story anyway, and when that never happened they threw a tantrum and claimed to be ignored."

AskReddit,fck0vrk,t1_fcju9hb,1577713114.0,"2 sexes really. Back in the day gender and sex meant essentially the same thing, except sex was more biological and gender had additional stuff like ‘boys like cars and blue is for boys’ and ‘girls like Barbie dolls and pink is for girls’.

But gender is just a ‘social construct’ which means a made up thing (like, there is no fundamental reason why blue should be for boys, we just made that shit up).

So I guess people can make up a kazillion if they really want, but it’s just silly and kinda meaningless at this point. The whole gender thing is just silly really, we should chuck the concept out, stick with the two sexes, and if a dude likes pink or My Little Pony he doesn’t need to invent a new word to describe himself,he just likes what he likes."
