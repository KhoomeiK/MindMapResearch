AnimalsBeingJerks,feysr2a,t1_feyqj0v,1579450153.0,We use bells on our indoor cats due to my mother being harder of hearing and the cats being so silent. They'll charge for the door the moment they get the chance and it's easier to hear and stop them before they do get out.

TinyUnits,fep403w,t1_feokr07,1579311626.0,"Well, this is a positive sub and tbqh comments like that usually get downvoted and rightfully so. Didn't add anything to what was going on imho, just negative b.s. that didn't need to be shared, I know it's hard they should learn to read the room? If i went to a sub for tiny vegetables and commented on a tiny beet saying there are too many beet posts here in a disgusted tone, I'd expect to be downvoted. Same applies here.

& probs downvoted cause it sounds like you're defending someone/a comment that doesn't at a deserve it and was better off left unread and unsaid. Updooted ya tho"

TinyUnits,feo38z1,t1_fentxuc,1579294576.0,"Bcos, like you said, it's subjective and this video right here is cute to most people. If people don't like it, don't comment. It's a cute animal video, who cares if there's a child in it? Downvote/report content you don't like or thinks breaks the rules and move on. There's a sub for whining about hating children if they aren't feeling it tbh."

GuildWars,fdw7ak7,t1_fds1cs8,1578755837.0,"You don't have to know the satisfaction, people play games for different reasons. You're basically saying ""I don't know why people like the color red"" bcos they just.. do? People have different preferences and enjoy different things. They don't need a new game just bcos they're not enjoying/doing/feeling things the way you do."
tinyanimalsonfingers,fdw6259,t3_en3ay2,1578755397.0,This is awesome! I love these guys and would love to get into keeping them regularly! Favorite things ever.
theisle,fdru27u,t1_fdrogtl,1578689679.0,"Can confirm that there are mods that heal themselves during fights, there was one recently that happened and it's still in the reports server on their discord, server one? And when the user asks the deciding admin why they made the decision not to regrow, user never got their answer. I honestly wish they'd make it 21+ to be a mod there, I've witnessed a lot of issues that have to be taken to senior admins that the mods mess up.

All that being said, still my favorite server to play on."
