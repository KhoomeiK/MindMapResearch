What's the SCP foundation?"
AskReddit,ffxyvoc,t3_evnzey,1580335138.0,"The SJW mindset. We all know why!

The Supremacy mindset. I'm talking about the KKK, Neo-Nazi's, ISIS, Taliban, Black supremacists, white supremacists. There's a supremacy for everything.

The Westboro Baptist Church. We are all aware of that cult.

The Victimhood mentality.

The extreme Vegan mentality. Gary Yourofsky and Joey Carbstrong are examples. So is Vegan Boobs, Freelee the Banana Girl, and those people who make raps and song parodies of their agenda and also some members of PETA. They think ending animal suffering and abuse completely will automatically end every other global issue. They think using animals as insults in our language (bitch, cow, sheep, chicken, rat) is insulting to animals and we should stop that. (Do people really think animals care about their names being used as insults?) and they are radical and violent, and they won't listen to different opinions in debates. I saw a 'This Morning' debate on the question 'Has Veganism gone too far?' which featured Joey Carbstrong (a militant Vegan and animal rights activist) and a hunter, and Joey was a freaking bitch through out the whole interview! He interrupted the woman, didn't let her talk about herself and say her opinion, basically tried to hijack the interview. And that just really got to me. There's nothing wrong with the Vegan lifestyle. It's actually a good thing. Healthy diet, not supporting animal exploitation when not buying animal furniture, so it;s good to be Vegan. It's because of these extreme militant cult like jerks that they've tainted the whole word.

And this is something that this is not often brought to awareness of and that's the mentality that a lot of activist and party supporters have, and that's when you automatically assume that those who dissagree with you or have different opinions than you are an enemy and it applies to all of those people who fall in that. An obvious example are Trump Supporters and Clinton Supporters. And that's also the new prejudice. Discriminating people for the political party the support. How the hell are we all going to come together and sort out the world's problems if we are at eachother's throats all the time and judging eachother? Not to mention name calling, threats, insults, villainising and all that crap you see in the comment section of the media and videos. Come on, people, we are all freaking humans!"
