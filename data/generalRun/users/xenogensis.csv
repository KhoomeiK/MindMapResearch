That being said I’m happy we still have two undefeated fighters doing the rounds, but in all honesty I think he should have lost that. 

If your not a “true boxer” in the sense of movement style and technique, you end up relying on sheer strength, and it’s served Wilder extremely well. The caveat to that is you have to finish your opponent because the rounds are scored based on your ability to “box,” knockdowns are good but they don’t undo 10 rounds of brilliant boxing from Fury, IMO."

mildlyinteresting,fe5jnkp,t1_fe3940a,1578870290.0,"An interesting point made in that source, the plants that the bees go too seem to make the most impact. Should the ‘ingredients’ be to high in fructose (which as I understand is the sugar we derive from sugar cane, also the type of sugar I supplemented my bees with) it crystallizes much quicker. Where as the honey containing more glucose (which as I understand it is the sugar plants produce via the sun, and is not used in the sugar we buy at the store) will stay liquid for longer. 


How interesting, I wonder if there is a way to test my bee’s honey to see what plants they’re going too. I could figure out what plants in the area my bees like the most, plus I bet I could learn a lot more about how to make sure they stay alive by understanding their feeding choices as seasons change and their behavior does too.

mildlyinteresting,fe2kz9g,t1_fe2073s,1578839708.0,"So that’s not true, not all honey solidifies at room temp. We’ve kept beehives for almost a decade now. With no additives what’s so ever our honey has always come out in liquid form, the only time it didn’t stay solid was one year when we were struggling to keep a hive alive so we fed it sugar water.
