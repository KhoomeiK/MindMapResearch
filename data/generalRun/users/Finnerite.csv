A suggestion—BPD isn’t something to mess around with. If you aren’t already working with a medical doctor, get yer butt in there!  Untreated it can seriously screw up your whole life.  Btw, “I don’t have money for a doctor” just isn’t an excuse. This is way more important than tv/internet and cell phone bills."
KindVoice,ffujdao,t3_eu99a2,1580243191.0,"Hi there, it’s good that you’re reaching out. I hope you will keep reaching out. 
The usual (and correct) advice is to seek counseling and ask your doctor for help. Those will make a huge difference. So go right now today and make those phone calls, ok? 

There are a few things that can help while you’re waiting for the appointments that can take some of the edge off. 

Spend time with pets. If you don’t have one, here are a few ideas:  Cuddle puppies at a dog adoption event. Get some bread and sit on a bench feeding pigeons, or ducks at a pond.  Find a guinea pig rescue group and foster one.  Or go ahead and adopt one. The commitment to making sure the little guy is fed, clean and happy will help you feel better. 

More ideas—

Go on and get out of your house. during the daytime. You desperately need to move around in fresh air and sun.   Before you go out, you’re going to take a bath and put on clean clothes.  When you are out, smile and nod at old people. You have no idea how much a greeting from a stranger can light up their day. 

Blessings, and an electronic hug."
KindVoice,ffuhhqe,t3_euip9m,1580242055.0,"That sounds pretty awful. 

Can you figure out why it bothers you so much?  You might be feeling a mixture of feelings: jealousy, anger, shame, fear, love, grief.  If you can pull apart that knot of feelings it would help you figure out what to do to feel better. 

Do it soon. You do not want these feelings to become normal for you in this or future relationships. They just won’t work out. The girls you have relationships with will get tired of dealing with jealousy. It’s exhausting for you, too. 

Best of luck!"
