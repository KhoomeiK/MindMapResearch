AskUK,fdgybx9,t3_ekxycz,1578411314.0,Thanks for your help. I can't seem to find anyone who will cover me. I can buy a new policy (so I'd be doubly covered) covering the whole of the holiday but thats around £60 minimum. Seems a bit steep as I'll only be quadding for about 45-60 minutes. Also as I already have travel insurance I'd only be able to claim on one policy (provided it wasn't related to quad biking). So one of the providers is getting paid for doing nothing. Insurance is a racket.

AskUK,fdgvp3s,t1_fdgcsbu,1578409493.0,I only know of this provider. I'm 99% sure its not included (its run out of a storage container). Can't find any info about it on their sparse website either. I'd phone up but from my last time there I know the guys barely speak English.
