AskReddit,ffxhcur,t1_ffxcr44,1580325170.0,"I don't know why you're being so aggressive and accusatory. I'm not the tailgating type. I don't need to be the tailgating type, though, to know that getting up on someones ass, especially in the left lane, will generally cause them to move over so you can pass. I mean, I drive a car - pretty much everyone who drives cars possesses that piece of knowledge, I would imagine. I was simply pointing out that, even though it is stupid, it's extremely effective."
AskReddit,ffxgs2d,t1_ffxcw6u,1580324837.0,"Well, I mean, you must drive in a special and unique part of the country, because generally, if you roll up on someones ass, most of them will change lanes to yield to the faster traffic behind them. I'm not saying that tailgating is good for anyone, but it generally results in the person in front moving out of the way. I get that there are people like you who feel entitled to cruise in the far left at the speed limit, piling up traffic behind you in some twisted attempt at ""justice"" because you have every right to blah blah blah, but that's why drivers hate people like you just as much as they hate tailgaters. Heck, maybe more."
AskReddit,ffxg2cn,t1_ffxbuix,1580324426.0,"Or anyone, really. I've literally never in my lifetime ever overheard someone seriously extolling the virtues of ""no pain, no gain"", and I've been going to the gym for over a decade. When someone says that the mentality is ""rampant"", it just makes me wonder who these people are. I mean, I get that it was a saying, once upon a time, but I've never actually met someone who believes it."
AskReddit,ffx9v4v,t1_ffx9gtd,1580320768.0,"Oh, so you're one of those people that judges the generosity of an act by the amount of hardship it places on the actor? Add it to the list of ""stupid mentalities and mindsets that need to end""."
AskReddit,ffx9e4o,t1_ffx5yek,1580320490.0,"I mean, he's given away like over $30 billion dollars, so I think you can remove the mocking quotes."
AskReddit,ffx8uic,t1_ffx0jg3,1580320165.0,"I don't know where you go to the gym, or where you work out, but I feel like the whole ""no pain, no gain"" thing went out of favor a couple of decades ago. It's definitely not the mantra of any educated, modern fitness enthusiast."
AskReddit,ffx8l0i,t1_ffx14w1,1580320006.0,"I mean, it is definitely a terrible mentality, but it also usually works."
AskReddit,ffw6kkg,t1_ffupoko,1580286691.0,I could eat that Pasta Fagioli with some breadsticks for days. DAYS.
DIY,ffw4ojh,t3_ev7dko,1580284195.0,"I don’t understand why you would go out of your way to invent an unattractive and less functional DIY solution for something that could have been fixed with five dollars of JB Weld, but ok."
AskReddit,ffw3l8k,t1_ffw2nil,1580282824.0,"What does context have to do with anything? You’re the one who wrote it - it is what it is, regardless of context. If you had wanted “less” to be correct, you should have written your comment differently. Sorry mate."
AskReddit,ffw2ln1,t1_ffv43oc,1580281634.0,"But you're not talking about numbers - you're talking about ""arms"" as a countable noun. On average, people have fewer than two arms. You might have had an argument if you had said something like, ""The average number of arms people have is less than two"", or some such.

I know you think you're very smart, but you're wrong."

AskReddit,ffvd3b7,t1_ffv65b7,1580261282.0,"No, they're not mandatory at all. Generally, they're completely cosmetic and have no impact on actual game play. The fact is, micro-transactions/loot boxes exist because people buy them, and most of those people are adults. There's not really any such thing as loot boxes that are ""marketed towards youth or children"". It's just a narrative people can get behind because it's quick to gain traction, poor gamers think they're entitled to all the same things as gamers with money, and they think that banning loot boxes somehow means that suddenly they'll get more for less."
funny,ffvb160,t3_ev8g8j,1580259898.0,"Girl is typing out the answer to the problem from her calculator as “SYNTAX ERROR”, even though it just means she didn’t input the problem correctly. Teacher on the left watches in amazement. 

No matter what anyone wants to claim or believe, this is not an obvious joke."
AskReddit,ffujsoi,t1_ffuhn8n,1580243446.0,"I mean, by all definitions I’ve encountered, atheism involves, specifically, disbelief in the existence of gods, so no, I don’t think most true atheists would agree that there could be a god. If you wanted to split hairs, someone could still be an atheist while also being agnostic because, according to most definitions, agnosticism is an epistemological position, not a declaration of faith (or lack thereof). Still, I think most atheists take the position that gods do not exist (a metaphysical position) rather than the position that we *cannot know if gods exist* (an epistemological position), even if it’s possible to be both."
Music,ffu7s5j,t1_ffu7c7r,1580236284.0,"Hey, I’m not judging you. If you want to keep playing Minecraft as a grown man, then good for you. I mean, it seems more like the kind of game I played when I was 8, but you do you."
Music,ffu791g,t1_ffu3dp9,1580235969.0,"Did you play Minecraft when you were 10, too?"
Music,ffu33p0,t1_ffu1s5e,1580233452.0,"Wellllll..... I mean, if his albums keep going number one, we can only conclude that you’re objectively in the minority. Also, you are *literally* being judgmental."
Music,ffu2u53,t1_fftxtpk,1580233291.0,"An album is (and always has been) just a collection of songs. How old you are is kind of irrelevant - it just means you didn’t know what an album was back then, either."

AskReddit,ffu1v99,t1_fftnu5b,1580232693.0,Sounds like you’re more agnostic than atheist.

sports,ffs8jnt,t1_ffs6myp,1580175770.0,I’m not looking for anything. All I know is that you are certain about something that I know you’re not certain about.
sports,ffs5nch,t1_ffqueqw,1580173743.0,"Well, if the comic isn’t necessarily representative of real life, it very well could be Kobe’s arm. He is looking at the arm as he exclaims, the arm has Kobe’s name and lifespan above it, the shooter is the one who generally exclaims, AND this comic is most likely from an Asian country that glorifies pale, white skin, based on the date stamp. Sure, Kobe may be black IRL - that’s just not how they drew the comic. 

The fact is... you don’t know, as much as you want to pretend that your interpretation is unequivocally correct."
tifu,ffpfggz,t1_ffpab76,1580093731.0,Because fake stories never make sense.
tifu,ffpf8wm,t3_eudp05,1580093579.0,"This whole story reads like a huge lie. So, a bunch of people without bathing suits are going to strip down to use the hot tub, but make a big deal about being naked? For some reason, being nude around someone who is family (but not immediate family) is a big deal, around what are presumably a bunch of people in their late 20's and early 30's? You have a strange underwear fetish, but for some reason, you have no problem telling everyone on the internet, or getting into a hot tub completely naked with a bunch of strangers? You talk about how secure and comfortable you are, right before you call it your ""pervy little secret"". Plus, the edits cheering on your up-vote counts, trying to drum up more interest.

Low effort karma grab. Please move along."
