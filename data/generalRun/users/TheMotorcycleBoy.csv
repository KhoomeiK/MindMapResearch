The Crown Estates are not the only revenue stream produced by The Royal Family. 

They boost tourism by an astronomic figure every year. They also wield a lot of ‘soft power’ in international diplomacy. It’s hard to put a value on this but if you look at what countries spend on diplomatic missions and armed forces to help achieve the same ends it’s staggeringly valuable.

I also fully sympathise with you about the dickhead man who did that to you. That was not okay and guys should not be doing that - even as a ‘joke’.

So. Strictly back on topic:

I’ve been surprise kissed in a club by a stranger - I just laughed. It was funny. 

I had a friend’s sister grab my balls when I was making a pool shot. Same thing. 

Why does this stuff make you feel like a victim? It’s a completely different power dynamic when it’s a girl doing it to a boy. 

I’m not being ‘smug’, I’m absolutely not a super confident guy - I’m not an exhibitionist or at all kinky. But this stuff just doesn’t faze me.  I completely accept that it would be wrong for a man to behave this way to a woman. I really don’t understand exactly why there should be this double standard logically - I am just instinctively conscious that it’s not equivalent. I am all for equality and consider myself a feminist, I’ve always mainly had female friends. 

I am just genuinely puzzled why this younger generation of males seems to respond to these things more as I would expect girls to.

Harry was always a reluctant Royal - after losing his mother when he was very young (as he saw it) as a direct consequence of Paparazzi excesses. He has always held The Press to be responsible for her death, and insufficiently accountable for intrusions into their targets’ privacy.

The Palace has tried to stop Harry openly complaining about The Press or hitting back at their mistreatment (for obvious PR reasons).

Harry and Megan (Meghan?sp?) have had enough and relinquished their Royal duties. Good for them. I wouldn’t want to be a walking Tourist Attraction and it never sat well with him either.

facepalm,fepxjhg,t1_feozppe,1579334089.0,"That’s literally the law we have. The doctrine of necessity applies as a defence to almost all offences. If you throw something to try to save someone’s life you have a defence. If you are just littering you don’t. In the UK there is no statute (written law) setting out the doctrine. It derives from case-law and appellate court judgements.

That’s an example of society making an attempt to properly distinguish between transgressive and non-transgressive behaviour. It took very little imagination or effort on the part of our appeal-judges to hit upon this doctrine and give it the force of law. Sadly the bank couldn’t (be bothered) take the same steps."

We were discussing whether the bank was morally right to dismiss her or not.  I wasn’t talking about legal liabilities.  For what it’s worth I’ve been a practicing lawyer since 2001. 

It’s been a while since I took undergraduate philosophy modules.  I don’t need a refresher to feel that the bank were dead-eyed and overly bureaucratic to stand on this policy in this instance.  The bank could and should have taken the trouble to distinguish the circumstances of this case (in their written policies) so it couldn’t be used as a precedent for legitimising transgressive behaviour by other employees.

Philosophy is one aspect of every subject, but you don’t really understand that until you have a more-than-superficial grasp of the other subjects.

If it was taught at ‘high school’ level (secondary school), I think it probably would have to be simplified so much that it would be meaningless or maybe even counterproductive.  You can simplify History and you can simplify Literature and retain some meaning, but simplifying complex philosophy just contorts it.

If you’re going to keep them in prison forever, why take those resources away from public services? Again; (especially in poorer countries like Russia), money directed away from (say) dialysis machines for children’s hospitals is lives sacrificed to preserve your murderers.

I’ve prosecuted plenty of murders. Not one of them was a ‘whodunnit’ - it was always a question of clarifying whether they had the requisite mental state for murder (an intent to kill or cause grievous bodily harm). 

You make a good argument for having careful safeguards against false convictions, but I’m not sure the tiny smattering of miscarriages of justice justifies the preservation of the large number of worthless evil murderers that clog up the prison system. People like that are part of what makes Prison such an awful place for other inmates and staff. Even in prison they carry on drawing resources away from rehabilitation programmes and development of other inmates.  Then there’s the family of the murder victim.
