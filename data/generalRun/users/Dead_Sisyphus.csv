and still find an exageration to have bought a 1070(still in use obviously) for like 400 euro when it came out,i can't imagine how you can afford a 2080ti at current price and don't feel like an idiot milked by nvidia."

vegan,fehdqsm,t3_ep3m8t,1579114449.0,"the problem is much more simple than it looks:

every animal belongs to the wild,

taking an animal from the wild and using it is wrong,

reproducing animals in captivity for our own use is wrong too,

in other simple words leave the animals alone is so fucking easy.

(for animals ALREADY in captivity is an other story,but in that case we are talking about a way to save them from a life of use/abuse,not talking about a legit way to USE them,we are in 2020 there is no need to use animals anymore)."
