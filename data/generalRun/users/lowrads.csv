TooAfraidToAsk,fh71zq7,t1_fh44vp7,1581312398.0,"You have omitted what states and the federal government spend in health services, or ""non-discretionary"" spending for the latter.  Social spending is a slice several times larger than defense spending.  Education generally makes up the bulk of state expenditures, but health services are no small factor either, though there is some considerable variance between states.

The major distinction between state and federal budgets is the capacity for deficit spending, and financing to service debt interest is the fastest growing part of the federal budget.  It is projected that interest payments will exceed the defense budget by 2023 or so."

It's the casualness of the new era of corporate censorship that is so concerning.  At the height of Goebbel's campaign, they were only able to eliminate a few tens of thousands of books, and that was with over a thousand people employed at that task.  Now it happens all over the internet with the push of a few buttons.  No authoritarian will ever fear such a fragile communications network."

After establishing a baseline, the formula can just look at the number of territory holding guilds, or the average territory points per guild, and then use the reciprocal for the tax multiplier.  ie, if a handful of guilds own large amounts of territory, the taxes/fees go very high, and if ownership is more distributed, they go down."

albiononline,fh5a2be,t3_f1eyyz,1581286678.0,"Hard limits will always produce arbitrary results.  A better solution is to embrace soft limits in the form of diminishing returns.  A guild would simply pay a compounding fee in base costs and upkeep costs for each additional facility.  

Ideally, you have an HQ, and operating costs increase the farther you are from the capital.  In terms of power projection, it might as well be difficult and risky to mount an assault on a territory that is not in proximity to your own.  Assault equipment would be expected to be cumbersome, costly and vulnerable.

Similarly for shops, there might as well be a surcharge for overwhelming them.  Each additional job in a given time frame would warrant a compounding food cost burden.  That would encourage internal division within large player groups as scarcity would be enforced.  

The next logical thing to double down on after that is to charge rents for storage.  Player run storage could be the next big enterprise for Real Estate Online."

centrist,fh2xd8c,t1_fh2v7dw,1581262142.0,"Yes, it is often overlooked that protection for pre-existing conditions goes back to the 90s.

Regardless, people are justifiably wary of putting more resources in the hands of politicians.  They would be more trusting of extra-governmental agencies that operated under a high degree of transparency.  So long as there is a certain minimum threshold of insurers and re-insurers, then prices are likely to trend competitive.  On the opposite end of the spectrum, where very small insurers are allowed to emerge, is where you will see the most confusion develop over variance in practices and vulnerability to making negative decisions as a consequence of thin margins and small subscriber populations.  Pushing standards is about the best government can do, but guilds still have a better track record."
centrist,fh2s99a,t1_fh2bdjf,1581260276.0,"Allegedly, insurers only make about a 1% margin.  It's hard to determine without some sunshine laws.

If there were no insurers, it really would be a free for all, as they help spread the cost of the severely ill across the rest of us.  

There are a couple of vehicle insurers that advertise on the radio that they keep costs low because *""We only insure safe drivers.""*  The obvious response is that we shouldn't allow insurers to turn down anyone, but that turns those entities into quasi-governmental agencies.

If proponents were serious about increasing the role of the government in health services, they would stop talking about nationalizing the actual infrastructure and expert technicians, and start selling people on the idea of regimentation or even nationalization of insurance services.  There isn't actually much resistance to the idea of increased regulation of insurers, just a lot of money."

centrist,fh100yg,t3_ezv2xd,1581209339.0,"There is a big shuffle of cohorts under the big tents currently.  With Trump to the left of the DNC on trade, and the DNC wrapped up in too many niche bourgeois issues, and too convinced that demographics is the eventual future of their party to be bothered to pick up the populist vote, you know a big shift is inevitable.

You can tell that a lot of groups feel left out in the cold right now, such as libertarians and constitutionalists.  That can't last."
centrist,fh0xqr2,t3_f0wfnh,1581208663.0,"Proportional representation, or multi-member district plurality systems, favor extremists and partisan purists, aka hacks.  Worse, they tend to isolate seat holders from being beholden to their districts.  It also markedly increases political polarization in any country that adopts it.

There are a number of different formulations for PR, but in general they increase the power of party leaders and party whips over seat holders.  Seat holders are beholden to whomever or whatever gets them elected.  List PR systems, where you simply vote for a party and the party itself gets to determine the order of candidates on the list is the most notorious of these.  If a seat holder in a traditional legislature gets elected by her district against the preferences of the party, she can tell them to go pound sand whenever she likes.

They have different systems to account for overhang seats, ie how to deal with rounding errors for parties, and  there is some squabbling about where exactly to set the margin threshold, but it really doesn't matter most of the time.  Just getting someone in the chambers means nothing whatsoever for generating polity.  It has a little bit of effect sometimes on the composition of ruling coalitions, which are inherently unstable the more parties are present, or the lower the overhang threshold.  Polarization tends to be the stronger driver of the number of parties.

Decisions get made between party leaders in the proverbial ""smoke-filled rooms.""  The public is irrelevant in this process, except once per election cycle.  Even line members are largely irrelevant, as in some legislatures they can be booted mid-session for not hewing to the party line.  A good example of that was back when Greece was going through the expected difficulties of being made to accept bailout conditions.  Two legislators were evicted from the chamber on the spot.  

If you really want to see a change in the big tents, or see them follow public trends more closely, you will see the most benefit from allowing instant runoff voting under any single-member district plurality framework.  It changes the calculus for how people do strategic voting."
centrist,fh0v3zm,t3_f0u62m,1581207811.0,"There will always be scarcity.  All that can be changed are the mechanisms that account for it.  In this case, political capital would trade places with more familiar capital, but only up to a point.  

On the supply side, you will see an exodus of the most talented people into boutique medicine, mainly services that are not bound under price fixing arrangements.  The people who would stay in general services will be those who have no other choice, usually young people who have service requirements written in to their education funding contracts, and foreigners who are dependent upon their employer for their visa status well beyond their actual residencies.  

You would also see massive divestment in facilities and equipment.  Equipment would be decades old by the time it was retired, and there is a good chance that it won't be replaced at all when it does finally go.

It wouldn't all be bad though.  The system of funding is so byzantine right now, that having the government come and throw it all into disarray could have some benefits, especially if the public became disillusioned with the change after a single election cycle or two.  

The political effects of a generous welfare state is always a marked increase in nationalism and xenophobia.  Populist parties would ride the wave to easy victories, or rather, both of the big tents would embrace populism."

As you get older, and you notice that your mind just doesn't do as much of the work for you as it used to, you realize the importance of being an accomplishment enabler.  It becomes easier to stick to the obvious problems and carry them to their sensible outcomes.  It's at this phase that people find it reasonable to become mentors, teachers, confidants, administrators and functionaries.  It's rewarding to give more young people a chance to grapple with the really important questions and challenges, as well as to get up to speed quickly.  Your job becomes making institutions more robust, but without making them moribund.  Sinecures are not actually an end in themselves, but should be a means to some ends.
