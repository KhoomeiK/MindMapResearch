space,ffgj8hu,t1_ffeu1to,1579907493.0,Boeing spent $100 million on R and D. And gave all of the research to DARPA. Once they realized it was not viable they backed out. Simple.
pcmasterrace,ffdh7xx,t1_ffcyyx7,1579820805.0,Its likely not bringing in money. Most tech start ups dont. Probably doesn't have far to go though.
MemeEconomy,ff64hu9,t1_ff5dzkx,1579618915.0,"Affordable college would probably be on a UK based system, or just free. In the UK you basically pay nothing, but a £10,000 loan is sent from the Gov to your Uni in your name. So you pay the loan back after school based on your income post graduation. It wouldnt cost much to bring that system here.

>Most collages are technically private businesses (I think). How will the government fairly govern them

Most colleges are public universities. The ones that arent would just be for rich people.

>how will we make it public healthcare

Theres two main ways. 1 is a public option where the gov supplies healthcare plans for whoever wants them, and everyone else is free to go private (sort of like obamacare). The other is where the gov provides everyone healthcare basically eliminating the need for private healthcare.

It would have to be funded through a tax raise. 

> we turn to public healthcare, wouldn’t that put a lot of insurance workers out of a job? 

Yes, but those skills are pretty easily transferrable to other fields. 

> -is one, government funded, healthcare business really a good idea?

Yes generally.

>We wouldn’t be able to go to a different health insurance/healthcare company if the government screws us over. (I’m assuming it’s government funded healthcare.) -is it the healthcare providers causing the problem, or is it the drug companies that are over pricing their products?

That is a risk with Gov healthcare, but it would be quite difficult to ""screw us over"". 

And its both, insurance sucks ass and drug companies suck ass."

She didn't actually catch up to the men, she caught up to the ambulance which sits pretty far behind the racers and moves slowly. 3. It would allow for cheating in other races. 4.

YouShouldKnow,feufy2l,t1_feuen23,1579386128.0,Fine. Lets use the tourism agency which reports the figure to be about £500 million a year just in tourism. That doesn't even count merchandise.
