Dimash,ffiormq,t3_etutvd,1579978977.0,"I had never heard of a ""vocaloid"" before either.  Seems it's synthesizer software.  It has banks of vocal samples. You can give it a melody and words and it will sing them.   This gets combined with a CGI avatar and suddenly you have a virtual-singer that can be turned into a virtual popstar.

""Luo Tianyi"" is a combination of vocal samples mainly from the voice actress Shan Xin, but also with a splash of Japanese singer Kano.

Whatever you may think of a vocaloid, I very much enjoy the fact that even the most advanced software and CGI available to mankind still can't keep up vocally with Dimash.   :D"

So his mother, father, grandfather, and who knows who else in his family are very talented musically, and they recognized and encouraged his own talent early on.

Your personal reactions to the original Dimash performances are great and encouraged though, as are reactions to actual real performer's reactions (like the Jessie J. ""Hello"" reaction).
