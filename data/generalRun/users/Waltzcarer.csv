Some suggestions that might improve your chances:

1- Force the marines to fight on your own terms. Make it so they can't take advantage of what makes them overpowered. IE: Tight confined spaces to negative their speed advantage as much as possible.

2- Use weapons that are effective against them. IE: Plasma, Melta, Lascannons, Heavy weapons, artillery.

3- Use IEDs, traps and cleverly planned ambushes, favour long range engagements over close range fights if the situation calls for it.

4- Don't engage them in a proper head on fight, ambush them and retreat, preferable engage them while their already busy with another foe. IE: Inqusition vs Celestial Lions on Armageddon.

5- Use of vehicles can be considered when the situation is appropriate

6- Force the Astartes to divide into smaller groups and conquer them separately with overwhelming force.

TLDR: Use of guerilla tactics is your best chance.

A non-Astartes force dedicated to fighting Astartes needs to carefully pick their battles. Unless your Officio Assasinorum levels of elite, casualties are to be expected. I definitely think it's possible, but it won't be easy.

We also need to keep in mind most of 40k literature is subject to heavy bias in either direction. There are no ""true"" depictions of Astartes. I like to think of them like Jedi, while impossibly strong, their not invincible."
