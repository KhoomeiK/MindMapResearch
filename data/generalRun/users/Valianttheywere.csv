1. Pattern recognition and maths are vital. 

2. computers dont do real maths. They use lookup tables, which if corrupted can skew the math results.

3. **A divided by zero equals NOT A (a Set unrelated to A except at superposition)**. If you ever get to code at that level of the machine's OS put that in place of the divide by zero error message. ;-)

In binary terms it means A(00110010) ÷ Zero(00000000) equals NOT A(11001101).  So it converts Ascii from Í to 2. While valid logically in binary terms, its not realy the correct result at 2÷0=Í unless you consider Í a number from an alternate reality universe."
