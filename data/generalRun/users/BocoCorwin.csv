Unrelated, my sister and I would write messages to each other in the mirror of our bathroom. When the steam from the shower would hit the mirror, the message would appear. 

One day, my dad and his gf were in a huge fight and she stormed out. I asked him what was up. He mentioned something about ""ghosts bullshit again"" and I kinda forgot about it. It wasn't until I was at school when it clicked - I had written""GET OUT!"" on the mirror last time my sister was staying there. 

My dad's gf had seen the message, thought it was a ghost, and told my dad. He thought she made it all up and blew it off.

Even after telling her it was me, she still didn't believe, and swore it was my dead uncle who didn't want her there. We moved a few months later.

Not dude to a lack of respect , more to a lack of interested by media consumers. There are probably thousands of people who died in helicopter crashes that never even got mentioned in national news.

What you impart on people before you die is worth more than how long people remember your name when you're gone. 

Five years from now I'm gonna think, ""Holy shit, it's been 5 years since Kobe died?"" People who have memories of seeing Kobe play will still tell their kids about it.

Many times, the person who was talking, for whatever reason, will stop talking. I will often take this pause in oral communication as a cue to, once again, resume said communication. 

This can continue for quite a while  until information exchange has reached maximum, interest levels are below the minimum threshold, or one of the oratory participants comes up with an excuse why they totally have to be somewhere, like 10 minutes ago, but it was good catching up with you, yeah we should totally get lunch sometime"

trashy,ffwxf1n,t1_ffwpdtm,1580313188.0,"When I was maybe 5, I was at my grandparents' house. My grandpa was the cook. He was one in the second war and got run over by a semi on a scooter, and the injury made him unable to work. He cooked and cleaned, while my grandma worked at a pet store. They bred exotic birds and reptiles.

Anyway, when I was there, one day, my Grandpa was feeding some baby birds with a dropper, and I guess it was lunchtime. Since he was busy, my Grandma asked me what I wanted. I loved soft cooked egg sandwiches, so that's what she made both of us.

Well, for whatever reason, she burned the toast. I guess she took it a little to heart, and started to kinda break down as she presented them to us. My grandpa exclaimed, ""Toasted just the way I like it!"" and winked at me, chowing down on the burnt sandwich.

I understood, even at that young age, that he didn't really like burnt toast. Sometimes, you just do shit like that for people you love.

Ever since then, I acted like I liked overcooked eggs, burnt toast, etc..., when my mom would be short on time while cooking, and may burn or otherwise muss up some food. I didn't really like burnt toast, but it was an act I kept up for 30 years.

My grandpa is long dead, and my Grandma is getting on. And to this day, both her and my mom will bring up that burnt toast and reminisce about my deceased Grandpa and his love for burnt toast and how we have that in common.

I'll never come clean, and it's one of the few things that make me kinda choke up to talk about."
