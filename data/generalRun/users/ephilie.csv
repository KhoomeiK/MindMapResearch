bulletjournal,fgjf4zg,t3_eyo0g5,1580842732.0,"Adorable Illustration! Also, I like the ""Top Priority"" List. I usually just put all bug tasks in one list but sorting them for importance is a great idea."
PewdiepieSubmissions,fgjedgy,t1_fgi2ix6,1580842281.0,Was actually scrolling through the comments to find that out!
AskReddit,fg7sg62,t1_fg7s73v,1580600329.0,"You underestimate my powers.
Or maybe I didn't think this through, not sure."
AskReddit,fg7mp7p,t1_fg7llpb,1580596253.0,Well at least I'll be able to enjoy some silence.
AskReddit,fg7jqni,t3_exd1jf,1580594191.0,Korean Dramas. No idea where I got that from.
AskReddit,fg7izfh,t3_exd1zm,1580593671.0,"Who can stay quiet the longest. Fell for that ""game"" since I was 3 so I like to think I'm pretty good at it by now."
AskReddit,fg7iq35,t3_exd2ep,1580593491.0,"I was raised to believe in a loving god and for a long time found strength in it. However, after my grandmother got cancer for the second time (a woman who devoted her life to doing good in the name of her religion) I started to doubt. I couldn't believe in a god who wouldn't lower the suffering of such a devoted human being. And the more I thought about it, the more obvious it got to me: Humans created god to give a name and reason to things they didn't understand.

What I believe in, is human determination. That there is a will to live, something that drives us forward. For me that has nothing to do with a god (anymore)."
bulletjournal,fg0i33z,t1_ffzyo2t,1580408246.0,I didn't know! I'm in Europe and didn't check if its not shown everywhere. Thanks for the links.
bulletjournal,ffzfuf4,t1_ffzepfv,1580376968.0,"I get where you're coming from. For a while I tried to put the art part in a different book but weirdly enough I started migrated my task lists into said art pad. For me personally it is probably about motivating myself to stay consistent. But I wouldn't say its a core part of journaling either (obviously, seeing where the method is coming from). I find it actually quite facinating how incredibly versataile and personal the system can be."
bulletjournal,ffzfoeq,t1_ffzehjo,1580376722.0,"I was initially sceptical about glueing anything in my journal or using stickers. But I experimented a bit with it and for me it can actually be quite fun. However, I guess I understand that if you spend money on certain quality that is meant for drawing or writing it could seem like a waste of said. But to each their own.

Also regarding drawing: I usually do landscapes! But since these are not original characters there were a ton of screenshots I could use as inspiration. If you want to get into it the best (and most boring) advice I have is: Just go for it!"
bulletjournal,ffzfibe,t1_ffze7gl,1580376473.0,Exactly! It would be great to see more minimalistic setups online. I often purposly search for them to get new ideas for spreads without focusing on the aesthetic aspects too much.
bulletjournal,ffz12eu,t1_ffz0mbz,1580360556.0,Thank you! I started out with the basic system and the art part just gradually made its way into my journal. To me it is a way of taking the time to collect my thoughts and get more motivated to use my journal!
bulletjournal,ffz0xq3,t1_ffz0sdw,1580360446.0,They got the licence recently. Apperently we'll be able to watch them February to April.
AskReddit,ffv9lpb,t3_evetu6,1580258941.0,"I'd ask if there is anything I can do to support them or something I should know about (triggers, etc). I would want to make sure they are okay and affirm they are safe with me.
I was not taken seriously by partners before. Think that is extremly important."
AskReddit,ffv973n,t3_eveu89,1580258665.0,"Uncomfortable. I usually make very clear that I am not interested. If a guy keeps trying to flirt with me, he obviously ignores the boundary I set."
AskReddit,ffntenb,t1_ffnt8vy,1580070558.0,I think I am. Thank you for the encouragement!
AskReddit,ffnofj1,t3_eubfxz,1580068541.0,'Is this working? Why is this working? They are coming over. What do I do now? Help!'
AskReddit,ffnnmfn,t3_eubjeo,1580068212.0,"I got myself out of bed to take a quick swim in the sea with a friend. Freezing cold, slept for the rest of the day but still happy I did it.

I started writing down things I'm grateful for every day. Even BS stuff. On a day where I can't find anything I try to do something small in the evening that I enjoy, to put it on the list. It helps a lot to see the small things when it's getting bad."
AskReddit,ffm8pbb,t3_eu725g,1580050482.0,"I was only 5, but I still somehow remember my mom picking me up from Kindergarten that day. She seemed shocked about something and I didn't understand what all the fuss was about. No idea where my dad was.
I barely remember anything from that age but her trying to smile for me and turning off the radio in the car stuck with me."
AskReddit,ffm7wlt,t3_eu72uo,1580050093.0,"Howl's moving castle! 
I absolutely adore this movie, I love the soundtrack and discover something new every time I watch it."
PewdiepieSubmissions,ff511g9,t3_erhqex,1579577345.0,"I can't hold myself back. Got curious and consulted google. They apperently do performance art showing moments of seperation and togetherness. 
Not sure what to do with this info."
lgbt,fegtvk1,t3_ep041r,1579102418.0,"So just to emphasize what others said before: 
I was searching for an ugly coffee mug in the picture for a few minutes cause I did not even get the idea you could have meant yourself. 

You are beautiful, that dress is absolutly amazing and I would not even be able to safely stand in those shoes! I wish you all the best x3 Don't talk yourself down, beautiful."
AskReddit,fdlpbp3,t3_em0nr7,1578529280.0,That's a very smart way of asking 'What are you wearing right now?'. I'm impressed.
