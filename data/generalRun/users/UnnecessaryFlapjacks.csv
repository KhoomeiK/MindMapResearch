As to your second ""point"": I'm not sure what you're getting at. People get heated about politics.

I don't mind to continue talking about this, but I from this point forward I'm going to use accurate terminology. You're talking about universal background checks, so let us call them that. You want universal background checks, just say so. There is no need to paint this as wanting to use ""closing the gun show loophole"" ""as a bargaining chip"".

With over 300,000,000 people and over 300,000,000 guns... one wonders why your hypothetical situation hasn't already happened. Perhaps it's because people at gun shows are armed?

As far as doing gun rights a service, playing for the other team by using their extremely manipulative phrasing does no one any good.

The issue should be reframed more honestly before you even agree to speak about it. The issue is background checks for sales between FFL holders and non FFL holders, or universal background checks. *There are many people who support ""closing the gun show loophole"" without knowing it means universal background checks.*

As it has been proven ad nauseam, gun control advocates are nearly always completely ignorant on every single gun issue they try to speak about. This phrase os designed to make people think gun dealers can sell whatever they want to whoever they want without a check at a gun show.

You run down my entire reply with ""cool""... then try to make your point at the end by correcting me for the mistake o claiming it is a myth, which I never did.

Libertarian,ff8dh2z,t1_ff82nmb,1579673936.0,"The term ""gun show loophole"" is a **prime** fucking example of phrases engineered to frame an argument. 

""Gun show"" is used to stoke fear, and ""loophole"" implies that someone is abusing the law to unfairly/unjustly violate the spirit of the law and ""get away with it"". This phrase is far more engineered than you would believe. 

Anyone (in free states) can and should be able to sell a gun to anyone who's legally allowed to own that gun. It's not a ""loophole"", because the Federal Firearms Licenses and background check system was never meant to apply to anyone not in the business of selling guns. Private sales were never meant to be covered by any of these laws.

You can't play it yet, so you don't want others to?"
cyberpunkgame,fem739z,t1_feluwc5,1579242103.0,How dare you impugn their honor!?
cyberpunkgame,fem6mvu,t1_fel777y,1579241619.0,"Do you think that represents a substantial, or even noticable share of the audience?

I'd say the Keanu hype is almost entirely from fans of the game liking that he is in it as well.... and less because ""Keanu is in some game called cyberpunk?!"""
cyberpunkgame,fem6kk3,t1_felzke5,1579241551.0,"I wouldnt say it's impossoble they are working on MP. It's not like reputable gaming companies haven't turned snake before.

I don't expect it, I'm not accusing them of it, I wouldn't bet on it. Yet.

Though I do wonder how long they have known they needed this delay. One would think you would realize at some point that you're running out of time... and the fact that the delay is longer than the time between now and the original release is a little strange."
cyberpunkgame,fem6cml,t1_fekqxpo,1579241326.0,"I swear, some people would be happy with any level of delay. Their eyes gloss over and they start rambling about ""polish""."
cyberpunkgame,fem66bv,t1_feleh5y,1579241150.0,"Yeah. From early 2020 to fucking might as well or literally might even be 2021.

The real thing to look for is how they treat the next gen release. They're only 2 months from it now."
cyberpunkgame,fem60p7,t1_fekitt4,1579240992.0,"Real talk though, how long have they known they needed this extra time. It's really last minute to announce a half year delay."
cyberpunkgame,fem5yjo,t3_epmpuh,1579240931.0,"Why do they wait so long to announce delays?
They knew about this months ago."
