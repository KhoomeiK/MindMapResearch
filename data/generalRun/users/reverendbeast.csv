agedlikemilk,fel7tg3,t1_fejpd07,1579215924.0,"Got to tell you that for most people outside the USA, Obama was widely seen as a somewhat flawed breath of fresh air after Bush Jnr was re-elected, and all that Desert War shit he initiated. 

Trump is almost universally seen as a fucking clown, a dangerous laughing stock. Billions of people are hoping this mentally ill narcissistic old gangster doesn’t do something moronic that will lead to widespread megadeath.

The GOP need to find someone strong and stable to represent their views, desires and power... not this fuckwit."

IdiotsInCars,fel61yf,t1_fel4f2w,1579214827.0,"It’s based on previous Crown Courts’ judgments. Funny story: a local guy got done for growing weed to freely distribute for altruistic purposes. He officially changed his name to Free Rob Cannabis before his Crown Court proceedings, and now the case against him is down in legal history as* Elizabeth Regina vs Free Cannabis*."

Charcuterie,fcv53vu,t1_fcuolt5,1577994832.0,"I will reply more fully soon, but it’s basically the same as normal fermentation except the sausage is vacuum packed and the sous vide water maintains the temperature. All the usual graphs and safety limits apply. The main advantage is you can easily test the liquid’s pH (although I note the point about cheese making, I don’t know the answer), the main disadvantage (if it is one) is that the sausage is compressed a bit- I see this as another advantage as any air pockets might be squeezed out. I welcome any comments from people more experienced than I am."

Her dad tried to stop her, but now says that in doing what she has, she is now engaging with the world after retreating from it for most of her childhood. I am very uncomfortable watching her on tv as I worry she will burn out, but nothing at all suggests she has anything like FAS."
Charcuterie,fcs7z4q,t3_ein8lz,1577912717.0,I ferment in a sous vide so I simply use an electronic pH meter in the fluid that leaches out into the vac bag.
todayilearned,fcs4c77,t1_fcs129e,1577911283.0,"She not twelve, she is sixteen. Her parents didn’t ‘shove her in front of cameras’. She went on strike from school to protest, the cameras came to her when her actions struck a chord with millions of children around the world, worried for their futures. What you are saying is so ignorant and devoid of any facts, just stop."

Sausage,fclt8kb,t1_fcl9pfa,1577755901.0,"Dry. Just pour a load of salt on them in a food-safe plastic bag (or whatever) and mix it all about a bit to get good coverage. 

Later, you can soak them in body temp water for a few hours before using them, maybe change the water once or twice to pull more of the salt out."
