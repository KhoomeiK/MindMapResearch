>Before then, Usenet was largely restricted to colleges,  universities, and other research institutions.

>Whereas the regular September student influx would quickly settle  down, the influx of new users from AOL did not end and Usenet's  existing culture did not have the capacity to integrate the sheer number  of new users.[\[4\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eternal_September#cite_note-AutoOO-3-4)[\[5\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eternal_September#cite_note-5) The influx was exacerbated by the aggressive direct mailing campaign by AOL Chief Marketing Officer [Jan Brandt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jan_Brandt), which most notably involved distributing millions of floppy disks and [CD-ROMs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD-ROM) with free trials of AOL.[\[6\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eternal_September#cite_note-6)

>Since then the popularity of the Internet has led to a constant  stream of new users. Hence, from the point of view of the early Usenet,  the influx of new users in September 1993 never ended.

>Dave Fischer appears to have coined the term in a January 1994  post to alt.folklore.computers: ""It's moot now. September 1993 will go  down in net history as the September that never ended.""[\[7\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eternal_September#cite_note-firstuse-7)

> **Capitalism** is an [economic system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_system) based on the [private ownership](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_property) of the [means of production](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Means_of_production) and their operation for [profit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Profit_(economics)).[\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitalism#cite_note-1)[\[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitalism#cite_note-2)[\[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitalism#cite_note-3)[\[4\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitalism#cite_note-4) Characteristics central to capitalism include private property, [capital accumulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_accumulation), [wage labor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wage_labor), [voluntary exchange](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voluntary_exchange), a [price system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price_system) and [competitive markets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competitive_market).[\[5\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitalism#cite_note-5)[\[6\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitalism#cite_note-6) In a capitalist [market economy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_economy), decision-making and investments are determined by every owner of wealth, property or production ability in [financial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_market) and [capital markets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_market), whereas prices and the distribution of goods and services are mainly determined by competition in goods and services markets.[\[7\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitalism#cite_note-7)[\[8\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitalism#cite_note-8)

These include [*laissez-faire*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laissez-faire) or [free-market](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free-market) capitalism, [welfare capitalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welfare_capitalism) and [state capitalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_capitalism).

The degree of competition in markets, the role of [intervention](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_interventionism) and regulation, and the scope of state ownership vary across different models of capitalism.[\[10\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitalism#cite_note-Modern_Economics_1986,_p._54-10)[\[11\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitalism#cite_note-11) The extent to which different markets are free as well as the rules defining private property are matters of politics and [policy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Policy). Most existing capitalist economies are [mixed economies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixed_economies) which combine elements of free markets with state intervention and in some cases [economic planning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_planning).[\[12\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitalism#cite_note-Stilwell-12)

Modern capitalist societies—marked by a universalization of [money](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money)\-based social relations, a consistently large and system-wide [class of workers who must work for wages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proletariat), and a [capitalist class](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitalist_class) which owns the [means of production](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Means_of_production)—developed in [Western Europe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Europe) in a process that led to the [Industrial Revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_Revolution). Capitalist systems with varying degrees of direct government intervention have since become dominant in the [Western world](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_world) and continue to spread.

>  
>[Critics of capitalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critics_of_capitalism)  argue that it establishes power in the hands of a minority capitalist  class that exists through the exploitation of the majority working class  and their labor; it prioritizes profit over social good, natural  resources and the environment; and it is an engine of inequality,  corruption and economic instabilities. Supporters argue that it provides  better products and innovation through competition, disperses wealth to  all productive people, promotes pluralism and decentralization of  power, creates strong economic growth and yields productivity and  prosperity that greatly benefit society."

Through these and other efforts Demand Progress  drove more than 130,000 phone calls and 1.8 million emails to Congress,  and organized dozens of meetings across the country between  constituents and their lawmakers in support of surveillance reform.

Through its advocacy, Demand Progress has  prevented the expansion of the CFAA.

This was the overarching justification for every cold-war intervention from Korea to [Grenada](https://www.c-span.org/video/?71980-1/international-affairs).

The US public eventually rejected the Vietnam war not because they were convinced that it was morally wrong to intervene in Indochina but because the death toll of American soldiers was too high to justify this intangible threat of communism in some peasant country.

I think it's important to recognize that 90a lot of your objections in this post are superficial eruptions of the ""culture wars"" politics that have basically no grounding in political policy. I agree that there plenty of instances of hypocrisy but it's important to remind yourself that you're trying to compare and contrast the statements of two groups composed of millions of people. It's also important to recognize that nobody is above that stuff - if you look at my comment history, I've most certainly said some inflammatory bullshit in anger.

I would identify myself as a libertarian socialist - that puts me on the ""extreme left"" economically. Five years ago I was a neoliberal with socially libertarian leanings and a lingering disappointment with the Obama presidency and frustration with the political process. Obama campaigned on a political revolution, he had a majoritarian mandate and support from congress and he did basically none of the things that I wanted. I generally agreed with his stated approach of negotiating for ""bipartisan consensus"" which was part of the disillusionment. Bipartisan consensus is an oxymoron. Seeking that is like cutting a big old fucking hole down your main sail. The parties who win out when bipartisan consensus is sought are the super-rich, ""business interests"", and the bankers. It wasn't until I listened to [Yanis Varoufakis' criticism of Obama's bail-outs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z5J7Ldq3ItY) (never heard any of these ideas on NPR, CNN, et al. during that crisis in 2008) that I realized there were other options. Obama's bailouts were an ideologically driven value judgement and that ideology does not align with my own.

I have strong criticisms of Trump (obviously) but am very glad for his decision to deescalate yesterday.

Why?

>During the 1940s and 1950s, the school sought to prove that the  quality of training provided matched or exceeded training provided by  institutions within the U.S. When a group of Argentine officers attended  a three-month course in 1948, the school painstakingly structured the  program to convince them that that U.S. was ""enterprising, efficient,  and powerful."" Administrators leveraged preconceived notions around  Argentine racial superiority in Latin America to cultivate feelings of  equality between the Argentine officers and their U.S. counterparts.[\[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Hemisphere_Institute_for_Security_Cooperation#cite_note-:18-3)   
>  
>Scholar Lesley Gill has argued that the Ground School not only  trained students, but incorporated them ""into the ideology of the  'American way of life' by steeping them in a vision of empire that  identified their aspirations with those of the United States.""[\[4\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Hemisphere_Institute_for_Security_Cooperation#cite_note-4) 

Warfare?

>The counterinsurgency manuals that the school used for instruction were  produced during the Army's Project X, established under the Foreign  Intelligence Assistance Program in 1965-66, which relied on knowledge  produced during the [Central Intelligence Agency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Intelligence_Agency)'s [Phoenix Program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix_Program).[\[18\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Hemisphere_Institute_for_Security_Cooperation#cite_note-:10-18)  According to Major Joseph Blair, a former instructor at the school,  ""the author of SOA and CIA torture manuals \[...\] drew from intelligence  materials used during the Vietnam War that advocated assassination,  torture, extortion, and other 'techniques'.""[\[18\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Hemisphere_Institute_for_Security_Cooperation#cite_note-:10-18)  McSherry argues that the authors of the manuals ""believed that  oversight regulations and prohibitions applied only to U.S. personnel,  not to foreign officers.""[\[18\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Hemisphere_Institute_for_Security_Cooperation#cite_note-:10-18) Use of the manuals was suspended under President [Jimmy Carter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Carter) over concerns about their correlation to human rights abuses.[\[17\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Hemisphere_Institute_for_Security_Cooperation#cite_note-:11-17)

Socialism in Latin America was never an existential threat to the United States. These schools were always designed to support US empire.

>In 1981, various left-wing guerrilla groups coalesced into the [Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farabundo_Marti_National_Liberation_Front) to battle El Salvador's right-wing [military dictatorship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolutionary_Government_Junta_of_El_Salvador).[\[4\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Mozote_massacre#cite_note-4)  Prior to the massacre, unlike many villages in the area, El Mozote had a  reputation for neutrality. While many of its neighbors were largely [Roman Catholic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Catholic), and therefore often influenced by [liberation theology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberation_theology) and sympathetic to the guerrillas, El Mozote was largely [Evangelical Protestant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evangelical_Protestant).  The village had sold guerrillas some supplies but was also ""a place  where the guerrillas had learned not to look for recruits"".[\[5\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Mozote_massacre#cite_note-NY-5)   
>  
>Prior to the massacre, the town's wealthiest man, Marcos Díaz,  had gathered the citizens to warn them that the army would soon pass  through the area in a counterinsurgency operation, but he had been  assured that the town's residents would not be harmed if they remained  in place. Concerned that fleeing the town would cause them to be  mistaken for guerrillas, the townspeople chose to stay and extended an  offer of protection to peasants from the surrounding area, who soon  flooded the town.[\[5\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Mozote_massacre#cite_note-NY-5)

>It is alleged by the United States that some credit for the unity of the five organizations that formed the FMLN may belong to [Cuba's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuba) [Fidel Castro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fidel_Castro), who facilitated negotiation between the groups in [Havana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Havana)  in December 1979. However, neither the Cuban nor Soviet government were  significantly responsible for forming FMLN, although it received some  of its arms and supplies from the Soviet Union and Cuba. While all five  groups called themselves [revolutionaries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolutionary) and [socialists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialism),  they had serious ideological and practical differences, and there had  been serious conflicts, even including in some cases bloodshed, between  some of the groups during the 1970s.

>In  the end, the soldiers of the Atlacatl Battalion burned the village to  the ground and massacred more than 900 men, women, and children. 6 Out  of 143 bodies later identified in a lab following the massacre, 131 were  children under the age of twelve, including three infants under the age  of three months. 7

>After an investigation into the El Mozote massacre, twelve soldiers were  cited for the massacre. 8 Of these twelve soldiers, ten were graduates  of the School of the Americas. 9 The School of the Americas (""SOA"") is a  training facility financed and operated by the United States with the  mission of training Latin American soldiers. 10 However, the SOA has  also received infamous recognition for the great number of SOA graduates  who have committed human right abuses. 11 Besides the El Mozote  massacre, SOA graduates have played key roles in nearly every coup and  major human rights violation in Latin America in the past fifty years.  12 In fact, Latin American nations with the worst human rights records  have consistently sent the most soldiers to the SOA. 13 Martin Meehand, a  Congressman from Massachusetts, has noted ""if the SOA held an alumni  association meeting, it would bring  \[\*477\]  together some of the most  unsavory thugs in the hemisphere."" 14 There have been so many despots  trained at the SOA that it has earned numerous nicknames including  ""School of Coups,"" ""School of Assassins,"" and ""School of Dictators."" 15

...

>The United States government and other defenders of the SOA have argued  that the SOA cannot be blamed for a ""few bad apples"" who commit human  rights abuses. 16 The problem with this argument is the fact that the  SOA curriculum has not only been weak in teaching a respect for human  rights, but has, in fact, encouraged Latin American soldiers to torture  and use other techniques that are considered violations of international  law. The United States can no longer deny its responsibility and  liability for the tortures, assassinations, massacres, and murders  committed by the soldiers that it has trained."
