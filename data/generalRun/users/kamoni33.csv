CPTSD,ff20o8f,t3_er2q5c,1579490670.0,"This makes sense on why my trauma specialized therapist is reducing our sessions. I feel better and they are making sure we don’t develop an unhealthy relationship. They are definitely up to date on modalities and  trauma research. Seeing this post assured me they aren’t reducing sessions for an ill intended reason. 

Before I met this therapist, I was in an unhealthy codependent relationship with a therapist who relied on EMDR for trauma. I am really glad I did not stick with this technique because my current therapist has not suggested to use it, it seems a little hokey, and it is an old technique from what I have read. However the therapist who was suggesting it was really trying to push it on me. I am proud I went with my gut and said no, even if I wasn’t sure why. I can get more benefits than EMDR from a good night’s sleep, since it depends on REM. 

Trust yourself, I guess? It is our treatment plan after all."

CPTSD,fewmvui,t1_fewgek5,1579415108.0,"I mentioned self care comes so I think you missed that part.

CPTSD,fewfltq,t1_fewesy5,1579409780.0,"I see your point and that makes some sense. I want to believe that most people do care so I am cautious when I begin to think somebody could be a narcissist. It is possible they could be and  completely up to us to decide if the care is worth giving based on our experiences with them. 

Add- I am also not a licensed therapist so I try not to label other people’s mental experience. I worry that the label is sometimes given with little thought and can be dismissive of others’ experiences."
CPTSD,fewdprv,t1_fev09uz,1579408873.0,"I see a lot of posts about narcissists but NPD is actually really rare. It is easy to blame and dismiss others, but in that process we reject an entire person’s experience. If that was done to me, I might not have recovered. I was irate and bitter when I had PTSD. If I was not shown compassion, I would have stayed that way. Now, I am dedicated to paying it forward. People need care."
CPTSD,fewcym1,t1_feuwgnn,1579408567.0,"But it doesn’t work that way. After I recovered from PTSD symptoms, I became more aware that others around me are struggling with their own unresolved trauma. It was not easy for me to recover but, I finally had the resources and willpower to heal. It took me 25 years to get diagnosed and get help, so it doesn’t seem farfetched to imagine other people need a little validation to help them to realize they need help too. Some never see it and are constantly lashed out on because they are in pain, so they lash out on others. Perhaps they are deeply hurt because they neglected themselves, as I once did. I deserved to heal and so do they. Everyone’s path is different and no trauma is worse than another.  

Validation of my experience helped me recover and therefore I think can help others heal, too. It took me a long time to feel stable enough to get to this stage, so I am not suggesting anything or blaming you for lack of empathy at all. You have your own health to manage, first and foremost. I thought sharing something that helped me mend broken relationships would be useful. Having compassion for others helped prevent me from internalizing the projected emotions of others, particularly my own birthing unit. Best of luck, it is not easy and hope this helps you to feel liberated from them blaming you."
CPTSD,feufhx6,t3_eqk0pb,1579385995.0,"True but as people who understand how painful life can be, we can exercise some compassion. It helps us and makes us stronger to accept other people go through hell too. It calmed me to learn this from my trauma advisor so I am sharing it."
bisexual,felw4vm,t3_epjtel,1579232422.0,"I was pretty surprised how judgmental monosexuals are of bisexuals. Maybe there should be two labels? People who care about gender and people who do not??

That idea is going to toss away the idea of LGBTetc, which maybe is a good thing! Any thoughts? Labels can be helpful on a personal level, but there can also be too many that overcomplicate things on a general level. A simpler and more inclusive label might be needed for such purposes. After all, words and labels are powerful tools!

Perhaps, that would help everyone calm the fuck down and love to who they so choose without having to over explain (imo a romance killer). 

One can hope."

Wake up early before the day starts to journal- this gets me to feel emotionally ready for the day

Playing with our pets or watching other people’s pet videos online

Video games- if you find the kind you like. So many now and can be interactive. I like solving puzzles so Zelda games are fun.

Comedy- so many niche comedians with shows and podcasts. 

Intellectual podcasts- love learning new things. Sawbones is neat for medical history type discussions.

Chatting on social media about my interests - lot’s of opportunities to learn from others.

Cooking new things, baking too

Keeping plants

Maintaining a social media page where I post about my interests. The followers can be a nice mood boost at times.

Online shopping, I buy myself something totally self indulgent and unnecessary every 2-3 weeks. Spending like 20 bucks max, otherwise I cannot afford it


Ofc, you can make your own list centered on making new happy memories, this trains your brain to seek new ways to feel good instead of the habits you had before. These are my own “happy memory making” things but, I am sure you have your own concept of that. Making the list was fun too. Whenever I feel bored, I remember I have so much that I want to do!

Overall I feel better about myself because I was able to actually quit and feeling positive about keeping this long term.

I had a little slip up with alcohol this past weekend and drank more than I wanted to, but trying not to let it bog me down. I am going to abstain from that too. 

I get impatient and irritable at times because I getting used to not being high all the time. It feels good to learn how to be more understanding to others and think my way through problems rather than escaping all the time with weed.

The road has been a little rough at times, but overall I felt like stopping from edibles really worked in my favor regarding any withdrawals. I didn’t feel any at all."

Petioles,fcycr3e,t1_fcy6u9b,1578078149.0,"With smoking it is much harder to measure THC intake but edibles have milligrams measured in them, if you buy these. If you can measure down how much you take, you can slowly lower your tolerance at a pace you feel comfortable with.

The timeline was just an estimate for how quickly I expect to see reduced symptoms after daily therapy exercises and homework. I plan to stay off THC during treatment. 

You would need to find your own treatment plan and personally having the right kind of help made a big difference. Conventional therapists did not help me as much as seeing a therapist who specializes in PTSD, which I guess seems obvious but it took me time to seek one out.

Add: on a positive note, there is a high rate of recovery from PTSD when patients engage in consistent treatment. This keeps my chin up, hope it does for you too!"
Petioles,fcxq19d,t3_ejcrau,1578068752.0,"I have PTSD and OCD and found reduction through edibles than smoking was a less rocky transition than from inhalation products.

I don’t have any advice since I have the same disease; I came here to assure you that you aren’t alone and to encourage your recovery.  I still struggle with PTSD symptoms but am working through my therapy program to handle them. I am engaging in self care and challenging myself every day by staying totally THC free for the next 6-18 months."
Petioles,fcxp7w5,t3_eje1hc,1578068244.0,"It used to help my anxiety but over time my life stress got more serious, which is normal for someone entering their thirties with a growing family/career. Now, it has become less effective for managing my anxiety which caused me so much more anxiety, making me try to use it more and more without it really helping at all.  After all, it was so helpful to me for many, many years. 

I was essentially forced to find a different way to manage my stress and anxiety, which is fine because ideally I would like weed to just be a past time I enjoy on special occasions, like alcohol.

So I temporarily am stopping this year while I live life without THC. There are so many other ways to relax! It just takes some time to adjust.

I don’t have advice but I hope I am portraying that reaching this point was neither straightforward or easy. It took a lot of contemplation, therapy and honesty."

Petioles,fcvoss7,t1_fcvl4p2,1578006729.0,"Yes I understand that smoking is much more enjoyable and it took me some time to appreciate edibles. It is quite a different experience. I think it helps to make a list of your different options. 

Example

A) mode of intake: vaping, edibles, oils, flower
B) method of reduction: cold turkey, slowly weaning, quickly weaning

Then trying different combinations depending on what you have available, seeing how it affects you, and all while being very patient/honest with yourself.

I found the right combination that worked for me.- quick weaning (1-2 days) with edibles. It took me months to figure out what works for me. 

I really did not expect this to work because I am not much of an edibles person, but the results were so much better (for me) than by quitting smoking joints/bowls or vaping oil pens. Cold turkey did not work for me at all and slow weaning (over 1-2 weeks) made me too anxious.

The weed might not be as effective as it once was for you. At least this was my experience. It stopped doing what it used to do- make all the social anxiety go away. What it left me with is more total anxiety because my favorite past time was no longer helping me.

It takes a lot of personal honesty. I can’t tell you how to feel about it, but you already know. Make efforts to be true to yourself and you will find this is a path to building a bit of confidence. Start small.

Edibles feel more like food and less like smoking. I live in a legal state so I used 2mg mints to moderate my dose and brought it down to zero over the course of 2 weeks. I don’t like edibles that are candies or baked goods. The mints are easier to just pop in whenever. I had fun with them too over Christmas.

For me, I was a single parent for 8-9 years before I even considered trying to date because I lost my husband in a traumatic homicide, never found the killer. I spent years going “how would I even explain this to a date? How can I ever recover?”

I took the time I needed, dated these last few years and had some really teaching experiences and some good ones too. Mostly I realized I needed help from my dating experiences and this year was diagnosed with PTSD.

It just makes no sense for me to date again until I get better. I was having meltdowns every 4-5 date and kept getting called “crazy” by men. I am also bisexual and would like to try dating women, just to complicate things further I am scared of dating women after on sexually abused me as a kid. I need to work on these issues.

I need a year of intensive psychotherapy and it will help me be more stable while dating, which is expected to be a trying process anyways.
