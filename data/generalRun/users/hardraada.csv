politics,fgtz2k0,t1_fgsrkmu,1581111265.0,"It all has to due with the 3/5 Compromise.  Slave states wanted to count (non-voting of course) slaves as population when determining representation in the House, but the free states disagreed and they decided each slave would count as 3/5 of a person (yes, this all sucks).  When voting for President, however, only your white land owning males over 21 could vote, so a standard election would mean a huge loss of voting power and so. . .Electoral College.  As it is based on a state's representation in congress, if you don't live in a state, SOL.  It stems from an arcane solution to a now non-existant problem that could be remedied except the most likely ""territories"" generally vote one way so the other side will always block it.

All that being said, if you moved from DC or PR to a state, you can vote for President and voting members of Congress day one like anybody else."

I was in Bengaluru for work last year and maybe 40% of the team spoke Kanada as a 1st language and perhaps 20% more as a 2nd.  Outside of one on one, English was the work language.

Another example I have experienced was visiting family in Bulgaria was that in tourist areas, English (and to some extent still, Russian) was used between locals and Danes, Italians, etc.  

This, of course, was not as widespread as in India, but scores along the same spectrum and, I guess what I am getting at, is I think it would be a small number of languages at various levels of the spectrum in different places rather than a global language shift to English/MandarinStandard Arabic/etc.
