AskWomen,fehjj2j,t3_eoy958,1579117830.0,Not necessarily introverted but I can be quite awful with confrontation and I'm definitely more quiet. I honestly just texted the guy I was interested in if he wanted to go on a date and just went from there. Now we reach 3 years in a few days.
college,fehjb7s,t3_ep1or8,1579117701.0,Yes but I can be difficult depending on your schools meal quality. At my school I honestly eat healthier here than I do at home but I also have my days where i eat super unhealthy.
college,fda1vfk,t3_ekdrod,1578240760.0,"A first year writing class. I took 101 and 102 with so much ease because it was such a blow-off. then for 103 the professor was such a mess. He gave me no feedback on my turned in draft when I asked for it. Then weeks later with only 6 days in advance (during finals season) he wanted me to redo the whole 10 page paper, NOT because it was poor writing, but because my papers argument was ""wrong."" He literally told me ""just because you found research backing it up doesn't mean it's correct."" 

 Not to mention he also made me redo my whole presentation in his office. I got a B+ but never knew what was going on because this professor changed his mind on whether he liked your work or not every 2 seconds."

NoStupidQuestions,fczgix3,t3_ejg3sv,1578100753.0,For me it's because I'm more awake at night. So I actually do get more done at night. In the morning I'm still waking up and during the day I'm busy with class or work.
NoStupidQuestions,fcwhp9w,t1_fcwhg58,1578025907.0,"1. its a question not a statement. 
2. I said ""an act that could start a war""
3. I know Congress officially declares war, but as commander in chief Trump ordered an attack that could prompt Iran from retaliating ergo possible war"
NoStupidQuestions,fcwh7cr,t3_eja1ws,1578025538.0,So I could've SWORN one of my professors said war was an exclusion to the two term rule but guess I misremembered. Thanks for the answers guys!
NoStupidQuestions,fcwguam,t1_fcwgnv2,1578025269.0,I knew FDR served beyond two terms since that was before the term limit. But I've once heard about that being disregarded in case of war
college,fcwgozh,t1_fcwf7md,1578025162.0,I also took an astronomy class it was definitely fun !
college,fcvb6t4,t1_fcv9ma8,1577998442.0,Ooo what's your major?
college,fcvb5la,t1_fcvao8s,1577998422.0,"I go to a liberal arts school so definitely some bias in some courses but it's still interesting!! Classes like these usually look at research, history, and personal accounts; it's a women's and gender studies course."
college,fcv9x5d,t1_fcv9k4o,1577997697.0,"lol God no, the class is moreso looking at the Injustices within the system"
college,fcuvmyp,t3_eivprz,1577989468.0,"Depends. Look at how much tuition has raised year to year in the schools you wanna go to. If you think you can save up money that will be significantly more than the annual rise, then do it. If not then don't. Because if you're trying to save up money it'd be pointless if it's not a good chunk more than the annual tuition rise"
college,fcr3hq6,t3_eih4bb,1577896246.0,ita doable but you will definitely be burntout if you don't give yourself a day off :/
college,fcj0ej9,t1_fcj07m0,1577674171.0,I also forgot to add that the only close friend I ever made at my college ended up transferring for the same reasons I wanted to and she made friends within 2 weeks at her new school. She's super happy now!!
college,fc5qx7b,t3_egbmvj,1577463995.0,I once saw a squirrel freeze and then scream in panic up a tree to hide from a hawk preying on it...
gradadmissions,fbilmn4,t1_fbgtmv5,1576904822.0,Do you know if there's free waivers for all those fees? as a lower-middle class student $800 seems pretty inaccessible without some fee waivers...
