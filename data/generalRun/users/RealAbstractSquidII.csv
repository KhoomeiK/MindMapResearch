White gums can mean sign of illness but not always. Usually this is accompanied by lethargy and other symptoms of ailment. 

Bright to pale pink are normal and within range for a healthy cat."
CATHELP,ffh68a5,t3_etlflu,1579924246.0,"I would reccomend taking him to the vet. Food abstinence can be a behavioral problem and it can be a health problem. Sometimes both sometimes individual. 

Its possible he has some sort of gastrointestinal problem thats causing him to avoid cat food like bloating, stomach pain, pain in the throat or he has a bad tooth or teeth. It can also be a problem in the roof of his mouth or surrounding his gums. 

Cat treats are usually fairly soft so cats experiencing mouth pain will gravitate towards them. Or its possible the treats lack an ingredient that the food has and is problematic for the cat. 

Does touching his sides or belly seem to bother him? Does touching his chin/mouth bother him? Are his gums pink or a more white? Or a totally different color all together? Have you noticed his breath being worse then normal? Like can smell his breath even though your standing up and he yawned sitting at your feet? Does he use the bathroom normally or does he appear constipated or appearance of blood/mucus in the litter? 

If its strictly behavioral i would reccomend speaking to a vet on the best way to get him eating and drinking normally. My personal advice is to invest in a cat water fountain. You can get them for 15 to 20 bucks on Amazon and its just a water bowl with flowing water. A lot of cats avoid still water or water that's been out for a few days because instinctually still water usually means the water is contaminated or bad. 

For the food I'd attempt getting him to eat a wet food and avoid giving treats. But I don't reccomend doing this unless a vet okays it as I don't want your cat to become malnourished."
insaneparents,ffgv7ta,t1_ffgss7k,1579915903.0,"I can't stand apps like this or similiar advertised ""family tracking"" 

For normal families with healthy boundaries it could be a pretty useful tool for connection. 

But too often its used as a violation of privacy by obsessive helicopter parents that need control.
My own mom obsessively drove by checking where my car was parked at my apartment, hounding her friends that had kids I knew and people I worked with for my location, threatening to have trackers put on my vehicle illegally while I was at work or school, etc. 

I was 20, fully financially independent, living on my own with my own cell plan and I bought and payed for that vehicle and the insurance. I would have to park at my apartment and walk or get rides if I wanted to go somewhere or see friends without my phone blowing up. God forbid a car that looked like mine drove by and she saw it, id be called a lair and have to prove my location on the spot while she accused me of ill deeds or ""sneaking"" off. Despite the fact I was a good kid that didn't do drugs and had good grades and she literally had 0 reason to suspect me of anything bad. 

If my mom was able to use an app like this back then she never would have chilled out and I don't think we would have any sort of relationship now. By not being able to obsessively monitor my every move she had to grow up and learn to communicate with me to get information or admit to her peers that she was stalking her adult kid and it forced us into having a better, healthier relationship. The reactions normal adults gave to her stalking made her realize how out of the norm she was acting. 

Apps like this can be incredibly damaging in both the short and long term when used by people with no concept of boundaries or personal space. Especially when the app is normalized."

CATHELP,ffgqrhq,t3_eti5a2,1579912673.0,"So from your post it sounds like a couple of things are going on. This is unlikely going to be a quick or easy fix. 

First, stress. Your original cat sounds stressed way out which I'm going to assume is at least 1 part of your litter box problem. 

Litter boxes are important to cats. Not all cats tolerate or handle big changes to their boxes very well. Window went from a box she knew and was comfortable with to a brand New type of litter, a box that makes no sense to her, covered in the scent of an aggressive cat.

Saw dust pellet litter is genuinely awesome at smell control. But it isn't a cure all. Cats with dry or cracked paws or cats that have been declawed have a hard time with this type of litter. It hurts the dry paws and can feel very weird to the cat. It also feels very different to that of regular litter brands. Window may be having a hard time adjusting or the litter may be hurting her paws. Some cats adjust better then others to changes like this and window may just not be adjusting. 

The new boxes are strange and weird for Window. She was comfortable with a normal box and suddenly she's in an enclosed space that has a slatted bottom. A big problem with self cleaning boxes or these off bottom boxes is that  smells often remain. Urine doesn't fully clump up like in a typical box and can run down into the slats where it remains. You or I probably can't smell it so we don't tend to notice. But your cats can smell this. Scent is a strong communication tool for cats. So if this box reeks of the second cat, Windows is gonna feel like shes  intruding in puddles space/ territory. The enclosed feeling likely makes window uncomfortable and feeling trapped. Not to mention if windows is trying to use the box but puddles leaps in there, window can't just escape easily. She's enclosed with puddles and this is going to cause anxiety surrounding the litter box for her. 

Litter avoidance isnt just behavioral either. It could be a sign of health issues like UTIs , other types of infections, kidney issues, etc. The most common cause for litter avoidance in health issues is a buildup of crystals in the urinary tract. This makes urinating painful and the cat begins to associate the litter box with pain. So they avoid it. Your scent is comforting to your cat so during issues like crystals or other health concerns your cat will seek things out that smell like you to pee on. It comforts the cat while it is in pain. So things like our beds, clothes, hampers, tubs, carpets, shoes, etc end up being peed on.

Stress is another big factor in litter avoidance. The higher your cats stress the more likely your cat is to begin avoiding their litter, losing their appetite, losing their fur, and you may notice your cat is hiding a lot or acting more aggressive then usual.

Puddles is a source of stress for window. Puddles is taking over every thing from Window and not allowing window to fully relax in her own home. It would be like if I followed you around yelling boo every 3 minutes while taking away your phone or slapping food out of your hand. You would end up hating me and finding enjoyment hard to come by. 

Not all cats handle other cats well. And not all cats adjust to having more cats around. Cats are generally social creatures but just like humans cats and other animals have their own personality and preferences. 

Puddles has to learn that Window is not to be bullied. My advice to you on this aspect would be using 1 litter box as you have been. Buy a litter box and clay litter for Window.  Its okay if they use each others litter. But this may help ease a little of windows anxiety as its something familiar and something she will recognize as hers. Not to mention the box will be open and she may feel safer/more secure knowing theres exit routes in the event puddles jumps into the box with her.

Next is behavioral training for puddles. Contrary to popular belief cats don't actually understand punishments. Spanking or spraying a cat is about as effective as yelling no at a mosquito. The key here is going to be positive reinforcement.

If you are playing with window and puddles gets aggressive or tries to take your attention away from Window, firmly tell him no and set him in a different room with the door shut for 10 minutes. Give lots of attention to Windows. Then release puddles and observe. If hes nice, give him lots of attention. 

If puddles plays WITH window instead of taking the toy or bullying Windows give treats to both cats and lots of attention. 

Set aside 30 minutes per cat each day. Take one cat into a room just you two. Play like crazy. Lazer pointer, toys, tunnels, cat nip. After 30 minutes take the other cat. Give them each a solid 30 minutes of 1 on 1 attention. This will help them both feel secure and get that extra energy out. You can do more than 30 minutes but don't do less. 

If puddles chases Window to be a bully, again a firm no and put him in timeout for 10 minutes. 

If puddles bites window that's another 10 minutes in time out. 

10 minute time outs every single time puddles acts like a bully. 

Repeat every time he's mean to Window.  And reward him every time he includes Window or plays with/is nice to Window. Reward him even if he walks past window without acknowledging window. 

Eventually puddles will learn that he gets no attention when being a bully. But being nice gives him attention. The important part is being firm and consistent. If you aren't consistent this won't work because puddles won't understand the confusing signals hes gettimg. Do not pet or play with puddles AT ALL if hes being mean to Window or you'll just reinforce his poor behavior. 

As for litter retraining for Window, if Window goes outside the box show window the spot, give a firm no, and place Window in the litter box. Do that every single time Window potties outside of the box. Several times a day take Window and place her in the litter box with the door closed. This keeps her scent near/in the box and may make her more comfortable with using the box. Close the door with only you and windows in the room of the litter box several times a day. She needs time to use/sniff around the box WITHOUT puddles being able to chase her out or take over the box. 

Any time puddles is playing in the litter box without using the litter box, remove him from the box. Puddles needs to learn that litter boxes are not toys as playing in the litter opens him up to yeast infections and other health concerns as well as tracks traces of urine all over your apartment. If he has pee paws then walks all over your bed/carpet/clothes hes leaving behind his pee on those items. 

I hope this helps despite its length. Good luck!"

AmItheAsshole,ffdvi0j,t1_ffduq3l,1579829953.0,"OPs parents are also entitled. You don't get to volunteer your adult child's time and attention without their consent or knowledge just because you birthed them and want something. 

Watching soemone's kids *seems* like a simple task. But you are on the hook if those kids get hurt, get sick, have an allergic reaction, etc. It Doesn't matter if the parents are 1 room away, 1 road away, or 1 state away. You accept responsibility when you babysit. No one should accept that responsibility unless they actually want to.

All the parents involved in this situation suck. Find a willing babysitter or accept that you'll have to miss out on shit when your kids aren't cooperative. Being a parent is a full time job. If you choose to carry the kid to term, birth the kid, and keep the kid (or if you choose to remain in the child's life after its been birthed)  that means you willingly signed up for that job. You don't get to shove that responsibility on the people around you when you realize your choice wasn't as fun as you thought it would be."

We work with some very mentally/physically disabled adults. This woman went OFF the other day after finding out a female patient had a hysterectomy (due to severe health complication) as a teenager. This woman ranted for almost an hour about how cruel we were to this patient for revoking her right to be a mother, that all of this patients difficulties and mannerisms were because she was an unfulfilled mother and that we were fucked up people abusing this resident and holding her reproductive rights hostage. 

Except : 1. The patients parents made that choice years before the patient ever came to my facility. 

2. It is literally illegal for this patient to consent to sex. She is not mentally competent at all, and is essentially a very small child mentally.

Yes she has been reported to HR, The program Specialist and my direct boss over the period of her (recent) employment due to this and many other unethical rants and tirades.

Pretend for a second your guy accidently cut his hand off and was bleeding all over the place. He would obviously seek medical treatment because bleeding to death is a shitty way to go, right? 

When you have a flare up of your illness you handle it. Of course hes there to see you through. That's what you do when someone you love is sick. But you are an active participant in your own recovery.

Depression is hard and comes in many forms. Depression is a sickness of the Brain, just like the flue is a sickness of the stomach or cancer is a sickness of the body. But being sick isn't an excuse to refuse to get better. You can't just lay in your own vomit when you have the flue. 

You need to have a real talk. And you need to stick with the ultimatum. He starts putting the work into getting better, which you fully understand will be a slow process, or its time to leave the relationship. By letting him wallow in his own misery you are enabling him to continue to refuse help. If you wouldn't let him bleed out after losing his hand, why would you let him refuse to even try to feel better when hes metaphorically drowning? 

People with depression aren't helpless, dependant babies. They are sick people perfectly capable of trying to get better. Its hard. It sucks. It requires constant, consistent work with therapy and sometimes medication. You have to WANT to feel better. And then you have to put the effort in to doing things designed to make you feel better. 

Depression is a reason, never an excuse. And if you continue to tolerate his refusal to get help, he will never get better. Because to him this is working. To him, your staying, so there's no real reason to want change. This is no way for either of you to be living. You are both unhappy. And both doing minimal to change that.

If he doesnt get help, those awesome moments you guys had together are in the past and will stay there. You can't have a healthy relationship with an unhealthy person. Even if you really, really want to.

You aren't giving up on him. You are refusing to enable poor self pitying behavior. You say hed move mountains for you, but that isn't true. Because he knows how damaging this has been to your relationship and still isn't willing to speak to a doctor."

legaladvice,feemhvm,t1_feelqho,1579036753.0,"No it doesn't count. Mental health doesn't work like that. Because a sick brain isn't logical. You can know your history 100%, provide proof of it all, and tell me everything that triggers your conditions. And you can still have something thrown at you from left field. You can still have a sudden break or previously unknown stressor. Or any number of other things. Which is why its so serious when you say you have thoughts of hurting people. 

Do you know how many people voluntarily go to seek help only to refuse that help later on? Or the amount of people that seek and receive help but still experience crisis? Its a lot. I mean, A LOT. And unless that person is deemed a danger to themself or others we cannot stop them from discontinuing treatment or ignoring professional advice. 

Ill tell you about one patient. Really nice guy. Talkative and helpful. He started experiencing hallucinations and he already dealt with depression. He voluntarily sought help. And he was doing great at making it to appointments and taking his medication. He was living with his parents. Loving, supportive people. And even though this man was  doing everything right he had a breakdown and during it he murdered his parents. He phoned the police voluntarily because in his state of mind he truly believed his brother had broken in and murdered them. His brother didn't even live in the area. But this man really 100% believed he came home to his parents butchered and his brother laughing at him despite it being physically impossible. He was enraged that the media called him the murderer. He has never accepted that it was his own doing. 

While he was a very extreme case mental health workers see this all the time. Just because you, as the patient, feel you are 100% fine does not mean that you are. You can tell us your known triggers but you nor we have any way of knowing if anything else triggers you. So when you say you have thought a of hurting/killing some one we have to treat you as if you could do that at any time. Its for our safety, your safety, and the publics safety. We cannot take you at your word. If we did do you know how many patients in crisis would exploit that to discontinue very needed treatment? We can't just give a paranoid schizophrenic experiencing hallucinations a key to the door. They could walk outside and seriously hurt themselves trying to evade their hallucinstions or get into the wrong house because they are scared and confused. We Can't just send some one claiming to fixate on hurting people back to the outside world when theres significant reason to believe they could be a real danger to others. 

We see patients every day who voluntarily seek help because they only see or feel 1 part of the problem and think its going to be a quick fix who then later flip out or their condition gets worse because what the doctors are saying conflicts with what they are perceiving to be real. 

You can swear up one hallway and down the other till youre blue in the face that only x, y or z trigger you and that despite having harmful thoughts you'll never act on it. But the truth is, your brain is sick and you don't know that you won't act on it. 

Mental health isn't logical. Its more like a river full of rapids. You might be rafting just fine before suddenly being sucked into the water because you hit a bad spot.

The fact of the matter is that you are experiencing a very serious problem. It is not normal or average to have these thoughts, to this extent, this often. You aren't able to assess yourself or the situation correctly because you strongly feel you are in control. And you may be. But it is never a garuntee that you will always be in control when you are fixating on violent intrusive thoughts. Safety plans are in place for a reason. You were placed under a safety plan because your thoughts and behaviors were alarming to trained professionals.  You can argue all you want, swear all you want that we have you all wrong, but the truth is we don't. We have dealt with patients similar to you many times. We are trained to look for these signs. And if you want help, you are going to have to listen to the mental health professionals. 

None of that means you are a bad person. None of that means the people treating you think you are a murderer or rapist or anything else. 

It means we know you are sick and need help and we are doing the best that we can while you fight us tooth and nail."
legaladvice,feekd9e,t1_feeh258,1579035512.0,"OP I work in mental health. Please listen to me for just a moment. 

It does not matter that you have never acted on these thoughts or intend to act on them. The moment you say you have thoughts of hurting yourself or others we HAVE to commit you. 

This is not falsified. And it is not personal against you. Remove yourself from the situation for a second. 

Pretend that a random every day guy goes to a hospital or therapist and says he has frequent thoughts of hurting people. But he assures the doctor he would never do it, he just wants therapy and some help getting rid of these thoughts. So the doctor says okay, releases him with a date to return for therapy or other treatment. The guy walks out of the office, down the street, and begins slashing strangers to death. One of those strangers is some one you care for deeply.

In this scenario you would be livid. Hurt. You may want to sue the doctor for releasing a dangerous person to the public. Theres an outcry from the news and people in town. 

You are that guy. Im not saying you will ever do anything to hurt anyone. I am saying that if you tell us you have these thoughts the only thing we have to go on is your word that you won't act on them. You as a person may be completely trust worthy. But the last 3 people who said the same thing were not trust worthy. And people got hurt. 

It doesn't matter if you tell us 1000 times you won't act on these thoughts. We have to be cautious and treat the situation as if it is a crisis. 

It might be a crisis. Or it might be intrusive thoughts. But if we didn't have these rules in place a lot of people WOULD get hurt. 

You have to realize that we are the ones that assess the severe cases. We have patients come in insisting they are fine while simultaneously convinced that an alien has taken over their spouse and they have to kill the alien to save the spouse. To that person, they genuinely believe they are fine and doing the right thing. To their spouse they are having a mental health crisis and pose a genuine real life threat to them. You can insist your fine till youre blue in the face, it doesn't mean you really are fine though. 

I understand why you are upset. And that's valid. But you have to understand why these things are the way they are. You may not be a genuine threat when you are healthy and 100% yourself. But there are a lot of variables involved in mental health and if something is going wrong, and you have these thoughts there is never a zero percent chance you won't be a threat. A break from reality, an onset of certain mental illnesses, and much more can make a normal, every day person snap or act out of character. 

An involuntary hold protects you, your loved ones, strangers and doctors. You have to remember that the people working in mental health have seen everything. They cannot know for sure your intentions or plans. Only you do. And we have to do what's safest for everyone involved.

You would probably never forgive us if we let a person leave the facility just to go on and hurt someone you cared about. 

And you would probably never forgive us if you experienced a crisis situation and went on and actually hurt someone because we failed to intervene or act in the best interest of you and the people around you. 

I know its a shitty process. It feels confining and confusing. No one ever wants to be held involuntarily. It fucking sucks. But if we didn't have it in place we would be failing people that really need the help on a mass scale."

CATHELP,fe6sjfl,t3_eo0uoq,1578903365.0,"Don't worry! This is actually pretty typical of cats when they are introduced to a new environment. I had a cat that once chose to live in a closet for 2 weeks before he would willingly let me look at him. And it was another month entirely before he would willingly approach me by himself. 

Your kitty is just nervous and overwhelmed. Make sure your home is quiet (no loud music/yelling/etc) and calm. Make sure food and water is available and that you don't move the litter box from where she currently knows it. She will most likely eat/drink and go to the bathroom while you guys are asleep and the house is the quietest. The quiet will make her feel safe and more secure in the new area. Using the bathroom makes cats feel very vulnerable, and she may be waiting till she feels safe to do so. 

Your home is full of brand new sounds, and smells, and sensations, that are all overwhelming her right now. It would be like if some one suddenly put you in a cage without warning or explanation, drove you to an unknown location, and dropped you off all while not speaking a language you know. Youd be pretty scared and might also choose to hide in the closet. 

Your kitty will adjust slowly. Some cats handle stress worse then others. But give her time. Don't approach her first, let her come to you. Don't try to pick her up or force her out of hiding. As she adjusts and slowly becomes more comfortable in your home shell start cautiously exploring the place. You'll slowly start seeing her more. She may slowly begin approaching you and eventually work her way up to cuddling or wanting pets. 

If she is still skittish in a few months time don't be alarmed. That's natural and normal. Some cats are very quick to adjust and settle in and some take a very long time before they feel comfortable. I have one cat that thinks car rides are the bees knees and doesn't realize you rearranged a room, and I have a cat that if you move a table 2 inches to the left she's skittish and nervous for a whole month. She just doesn't like change. 

If she (your kitty) does take a few months to settle in and seems stressed you can always talk to a vet about calming remedies to help her anxiety. But overall she will be okay in time."
CATHELP,fe6rjb2,t3_eo0vhh,1578902006.0,"I had a meower before. Chances are your cat is always going to be talkative to an extent. But you can try to limit the noisy talks. 

We got my boy to stop meowing as much by silently picking him up (gently) when he was too loud, and removing him from the room we were in. If he came back and resumed meowing, we left the room or shut ourselves in a differemt room away from him. 

Eventually he learned that being loud = being ignored in time out. But approaching and pawing gently but quietly = head pats and tummy rubs. 

What it did was taught him that being loud was not going to illicit a reaction from us and was actually going to drive us a way from him. The key is not saying anything to him in response. No yelling, pleading, talking, no swats or sprays or scruff grabs or anything else. Just calm and silent removal from the noise. 

Cats do not understand punishmemt. They just become fearful of negative stimulus. However cats are great at learning positive outcomes. So if he learns that being quiet illicits a positive reaction (head pats, talking to him, tummy rubs, occasional treats) he'll adjust to what gives him positive reactions. 

(Absolutely do not give in and give him treats/wet food when hes being loud or he'll keep being loud)

The other thing we did was LOTS of play for about an hour before bed. Many cats are loud when youre trying to sleep because they aren't getting enough stimulus. Regular routine play with lazer lights, cat nip, noise toys or string toys for an hour before bed can help tire them out and ensure they let you sleep. If you are in a position to do so, getting a second cat can help with the play situation as cats are social and enjoy having playmates. But I totally understand if a second cat is not in your cards. 

Try setting aside 40 minutes to an hour before bedtime to playing with your cat. Get him involved with lazer lights or other toys he enjoys and really tire him out. You may see a decrease in the constant meowing. 

I hope this helps!"

You can try an over the counter hairball reliever (you can find plenty on Amazon) and see if that does anything for the hacking sound. Provide lots of whatever food he will eat. If you want to track weight loss, if you own a scale at home, you can weigh a laundry basket, then put him in it and weigh it. Subtract the weight of the basket. Do this daily and write down the weights. It'll give you an idea of how much and how quickly he's dropping weight. Can help the vet as well. Use a warm moist cloth to gently dab away discharge from the eye. Track the color of the discharge and write down any noticeable changes. Like color, consistency, and if the pupil becomes any more distorted. Be vigilant of any other symptoms or strange behavior and write it down as you notice it. Dates, times, description.

Holding the cat under water like that is not only shitty and abusive, but can actually kill the cat. Have you ever heard the term dry drowning?

This can happen to all mammals, not just humans. If that cat inhales water when it panics over being held in the water it could eventually dry drown.

relationships,fdzzfqs,t1_fdzvxqc,1578799463.0,"Theres a process you'll have to go through before you can think about potential adoption. 

The first step is turning him in to the RSPCA/Humane society in charge of your location. If there is neither of these (you can Google it) there should be a dog warden. While primarily in charge of dogs there is a section through the warden that deals with other domestic pets. Call the warden and state you are reporting animal abuse. The warden will take the case or refer you to the proper channel to report to. 

In some small towns none of these are available. If these channels are not available to you, you need to go to the local police station and file a report against your boy friend for animal abuse and cruelty. If you are shrugged off escalate to a superior within the force to report to. Contrary to popular belief animal abuse and cruelty IS a reportable offence. There is currently legislature being passed (it may have already passed) that changes animal abuse from a misdemeanor to a felony offense. 

After you have reported this there will be an investigation either through the warden, ASPCA/humane society or the local police. He will be contacted by a member or officer and they will request to view the home and the animals. 

If your boyfriend has never been reported before he will be given a chance to improve his behavior. He will be given resources to help him understand his abuse and his pets will be given a thorough once over physically to ensure they are well fed, not injured, and the house is not a hazard. 

He will be given a surprise house check some time after the initial home check. If he passes his case will likely be closed. 

If he has been reported before, has a known history with these channels for abuse, or during the investigation the investigating party determines he is a serious risk to the animals, they will be removed from the home. From there they must undergo a mandatory hold in the event of an appeal for the removal (usually 3 days to 1 week) they will have a medical assessment and then will be placed for adoption. During the adoption period you can formally adopt them through the agency they are placed at. Removals are not usually held for specific people that want to adopt them, you must be ready upon their adoption status through the agency. However if you are informed they have been removed due to your report you can request to be notified if they go up for adoption. 

The animals are not garunteed to be removed at the first report if there is no sign of starvation or injury.  You can report as many times as you want so long as your reports are honest and factual each time you report. The more evidence you can provide in your reports the best. Be sure to include specific dates, times and details of the incident. 

For example, on may 1st ""boy friend"" held cat under running water for 3 minutes as punishment for meowing. On may 2nd i saw him strike cat in head for unknown reasons. 

Just remember not to embellish or provide false details. Be as thorough and honest as you can."
WTF,fdwxnkn,t1_fdwu37r,1578763240.0,"Not OP but no, clipping the wing doesn't hurt the bird. Its similar to a hair cut honestly. There are a few different ways of clipping the wing, none of which are painful. And the clipped feathers grow back in a few weeks to a few months depending on the bird. Which means they are not permenantly altered and can fly again as soon as the clipping grows back. 

Most pet birds are clipped at a very young age to train them into not relying on flight for movement. clipped birds tend to be more docile then unclipped birds and can be easier to train. 

Clipping is advised by most vets and pet store employees because domestic birds can really hurt themselves by flying into walls/windows/stoves/open water like toilets or cooking pots/into buckets of cleaning solution or supplies and other house hold dangers. Birds that fly away from their owners do not have a high survival rate in the wild due to things like temperature differences and difficulty finding food when they are so use to having it delivered via their humans. 

Even a very well trained bird can become scared by loud noises like fire alarms, car alarms, neighbors or children yelling, tornado warnings, bad weather and other noises and fly into furniture/Windows/etc and injure or kill themselves. 

This link provides some good information on wing clipping and why its important to the health and safety of domestic birds.

So essentually when you jam your gears, it isnt a garuntee that you are 100/% going to fuck up your transmission. Its just a possibility. The more you do it though the higher the chance of damage is. You can always damage it on the first try it just isn't a 100% for sure fact that you will. A lot of factors play into how bad the damage is. Like the age of the car/transmission, condition of the transmission, how hard/fast your jamming the gears, etc. 

And when you do this your vehicle is gonna make noise. You may hear a loud grinding sound, something may whine loudly, depending on what's damaged you could hear a loud snap or screech. And if you are actively moving forward and then fuck the transmission and come to a halt quickly you'll hear the screeching of breaks or other noises related to a fast and difficult stop. 

It can be silent. Ive had transmissions that just quietly died on me at red lights. But that's also not a garuntee. 

So while he totally could have set this up, its something thats going to take some time and while it was late, he still risks some one seeing or hearing him. Which is why I defaulted to him potentially damaging the car then bringing it there. But that also runs a risk of being seen and heard. 

Then There's the cost of repairs that he would be stuck with. Your insurance doesn't typically cover random transmission failure. Especially in older cars or if you admit you failed your tranny by racing another vehicle. That's a bit of an insurance nightmare. 

For a story so choppily put together, this is a lot of effort to go through. Not impossible per say, but unlikely. As some one willing to think this out and put the effort in, would likely have thought up a better more plausible story or alibi that required half the involved work. 

My other hunch, and i could be completely wrong, but when someone is involved in a crime, most often they don't want to be associated with it at all.  Which is why a lot of times you see the murderous husband/wife/partner/etc saying oh they didn't come home i don't know what happened or oh they went jogging at this time and didn't return, they saw this person and didn't return. Murderers don't often (but not never) directly involve themselves in the immediate before or after a crime has been committed. It puts them in the spot light and often the story crumbles and they confess or evidence starts piling against them. 

He was cleared formally but his story about the truck was discredited. So I truly don't know if he was involved or just wanted to try and play hero. But the broken down vehicle seems like a lot of effort to fake, and very expensive personally to fix."
UnresolvedMysteries,fdlbxmy,t1_fdl519d,1578520746.0,"No with the sort of damage he had to that transmission he wouldnt be doing anything other then possibly a very slow limp off the side of the road. And that's if the vehicle is capable of moving at all. 

Depending on what exactly is wrong with the transmission you aren't moving at all. Period. There's no get up and go or oompf to the vehicle. In slightly less severe situations you can get your vehicle to crawl at slow speed enough to get to the side of the road, or if your really pushing it maybe limp it down the road a small ways. But you won't be chasing anyone unless it's on foot. 

You can genuinely do some real damage to your transmission by throwing it in gear without your car being fully stopped, or worse if you are still actively driving forward then suddenly slam it in reverse or neutral and vice versa.

I suppose if he really wanted a good story he could damage it intentionally by shifting like a maniac, or crawling under and taking the transmission apart. He would then have to limp or push the vehicle to the alleged abduction site and make his claim of the chase.  But that seems like a far way to go for a story full of holes. And if this was in the middle of town almost certainly some one would have seen or heard him limping or pushing a broken down vehicle several blocks into town. The vehicle will still turn over/heat up. It jsut won't really be going anywhere and you may not be able to shift it depending on the issue. Most tranny issues tend to lock up the clutch.

At this point the wallet is sitting at the top of the bag. Pick pockets tend to hang around shops/busy plazas so they observe you tossing your wallet in or placing it in a back pocket. They then follow you into a crowded area, get behind or to the side of you, and are able to quickly grab the wallet since they know generally where in the bag it is. Its also a decent guess that if you are in an area with a lot of shops or places where you can buy things, someone has likely used their wallet recently. So a pick pocket may stick their hand in 12 open bags before grabbing a wallet. But they've still found a wallet. Its a numbers game since pick pockets are typically quick and looking for easy targets.  

Open bags are problematic in other ways too. If a pick pocket is taller then you , then they can follow behind you while looking into your bag. They can easily grab an item they want if they see it in the bag. Open bags leave you at risk of theft scams as well.

Cats (and other pets) are really sensitive to changes in their mates and friends. Socks rights now reeks of various different animals some who may have been sick, smells of medication and sterile cleaning supplies, and the strange humans (vet techs/doctors) that performed the surgery. Cats also smell different to other cats when they are stressed out. On top of the strange smells, Socks is acting differently behaviorally.

confession,fdifvve,t1_fdibdly,1578441980.0,"When traveling in typical tourist spots, areas of high crime or highly populated places, buy yourself a cheap wallet and put absolutely nothing in it. Put that in your pocket. Keep your cards/pictures/etc at home or your hotel hidden away in a hard to find place. Only carry the nessecsry cash/card for what your doing and keep it in your sock against your leg or in an interior coat or pant pocket. 

If you are travelling through a typical tourist area or place with high crime rates, leave your purse/backpack at home or at your hotel. If you absolutely have to have your purse or back pack only carry what's absolutely nessecary. Leave your extra cards/checks/cash behind. DO NOT ever carry your passport or banking info on you. Put a lock on your phone if anything related to your banking is on it. Again carry loose cash or the card or cards you need for the time you are out in your sock, interior coat/pants pockets, or in your shoe. Purses and back packs are targets because someone can easily snatch it and run. 

If you have to have a purse or back pack on you: 
1. Wear your backpack with both straps on your shoulders. This makes it harder to be yanked off you if someone tries to grab it and run. 

2. Invest in back pack locks. They are just small locks you can put through the zippers of your bag to keep it shut when traveling. Prevents pick pockets. 

3. Wear your purse across your body so that if someone yanks the strap it won't slide off your shoulder. Keep the actual bag part of your purse positioned towards the front of your body.

4. Avoid purses that do not close. Tote bags and open style bags are easy for pick pockets. Get a bag that fully zips, clips, or snaps shut. Avoid clutches or handbags you can't body wear if you plan on being in a populated tourist area or high crime location. Clutches and small non wearable bags are easy to grab and run with. Back pack purses and purses with pockets that zip can also use back pack locks. 

5. Don't ever put valuables, cash or cards in small outside pockets of backpacks or purses. These are easiest to unzip/unsnap/open without alerting you. Don't put your ID in these small outer pockets either. 

6. For high crime areas carry a cheap, empty wallet. If you are mugged you can throw the fake at your mugger and run. They will likely grab it and also run before realizing they've been duped."
WTF,fdfb34p,t1_fdf6xh6,1578357512.0,"My best guess is young ground hog. Their hides are tough and can withstand some damage. It wouldn't be the first ground hog to find its way into a sewer or septic tank due to their digging habits. A young one could easilly trap itself in a pipe and drown or suffocate by thrashing/squeezing itself too tightly into the pipe its trapped in. 

Dark fur would match. The ears are further back and rounded like a groundhogs would be. The rounded and short stumpy back legs rule out a cat or dog. Thick mid section and build also rules out puppy or cats.  Size rules out a squirrel or average rat. Facial shape is rounded and stumpy, similar to a developing ground hog or other rodent. Facial shape rules out a possum as possums have more angular facial structures and are ""pinched"" in a way. The front paws have elongated fingers and what appears to be claws/nails. Due to the way they curve/sit on the arms it appears to be primarily used for digging. 

If there was a tail on this creature that was sorta thick and not very long its almost certainly a ground hog without fur."
WTF,fdf92sm,t1_fdf51e9,1578356160.0,"I think it might be a young ground hog. Not a baby but not fully grown. Back legs are stumpy and low to ground, front paws are small with what looks like thicker claws/nails likely for digging. If you look at the paw the ""fingers"" are elongated which is a feature seen in most rodents.  Dark fur would match. Body looks a bit bloated especially around the face but seems to have the general shape of a groundhog. Ears are up and rounded in the same way. Ground hogs have short ish furry tails usually a couple inches long. When hairless their tail resembles that of a rat, just shorter then the average rats tail. 

A possums face is a lot longer/""pinched"" vs. This stumpy rounded face.  Possums back legs arent this stumpy either. A cat wouldn't be so thick in the mid section and a cats limbs are not this short, fingers on the paws are too long to be a cat or dog. Face doesn't like up with a puppy or dog. Paws and general size seem too large to be an average rat or mouse. 

My best guess is ground hog. Would make sense if there's ground hogs on the property who have dug through or around the house/septic tank/piping. 

Groundhogs can live in a variety of areas and Their digging habits have gotten them trapped in homes/septic tanks and other human inventions before. 

Some good reference pictures on the ground hog wiki page.

dogswithjobs,fcvriz2,t1_fcvqq3o,1578008472.0,"Which i understand and I'm sorry your service dog was attacked. I agree wholeheartedly that emotional support animals are often poorly trained and out of control. 

They don't have the same rights that a service/therapy animal does. So if you see an out of control, untrained or dangerous ESA report it to the people in charge of the place you are in or contact the non emergency number. 

Its okay to be fed up with illtrained animals and its okay to be fed up with the people that abuse the ESA label. It is not okay to harass strangers about their animals unprovoked or to escalate an already bad situation by demanding that stranger to leave or tell you their disability. Its not okay to randomly assume an animal you see in public is an ESA and harrass the owner, especially if the animal is calm and behaving. And it's not okay to jump on someones back when they post their animal online without specifically stating it is not an ESA. They are under no obligation to specify. 

If you are in a real life situation with an aggressive or illtrained ESA Remove yourself from the situation and report the situation. Report any injuries you or anyone else/service OR Therapy animals sustain."
dogswithjobs,fcvlvp8,t1_fcvltwo,1578004900.0,My bad! Thank you for the clarification!
dogswithjobs,fcvh5pq,t1_fcv857s,1578001994.0,"Per OPs above reply, OP has schizoaffective disorder and is prone to panic attacks and visual hallucinations. OPs dog is a registered therapy dog through OPs disability counselors. The dog is trained to alert OP when a real person is in OPs blind spot, and to lead OP away from crowds/people during hallucinatory episodes. 

Lets try not to make assumptions about people and their therapy animals. Not all disabilities are visible to an outsider. A disabled person is not required to inform you personally of their disability or the severity of said disability. Therapy dogs can be large or small and trained to perform a variety of tasks that an outsider watching may or may not recognize or understand.

Asking a stranger to clarify their disability so you can determine if you believe them or not is a shitty way to behave. You wouldn't ask a total stranger why they have no legs or why they are missing an eye, so don't ask a total stranger what invisible disability they do or don't have.

If you are so concerned that a therapy dog could be an emotional support dog instead AND you notice it is behaving poorly in a public space INSTEAD OF confronting the owner and demanding to know their disability, which you are NOT entitled to, seek out an employee, manager or owner of the public area you are in and let them know about the poorly behaved dog or other animal. THEY will handle it the way it is outlined in their handbook or code of conduct. Even an owner or manager cannot demand to know the persons disability or ailment requiring the use of the animal. But they can ask them to leave if their behavior is unsafe or unfitting for the area they are in. If you have allergeries to that specific animal you can politely ask an employee or manager for an appropriate accommodation fitting with the area you are in.

If you are in a public space that does not have employees or management and you genuinely believe the dog is behaving unsafely you can call your local non emergency police number or the number to a local humane society or dog warden. 

 If the animal is behaving safely and not bothering anyone, practice minding your own business and walking away as a well behaved animal is not affecting you. Your allergies, emotions, opinions and outrage are YOURS to handle and are not the responsibility of anyone else."

He got sick more then once. We had to take expired bologna to the big trash outside to prevent him from pulling it back out to eat/serve. 

That same coworker would leave his uncapped medications precariously perched above the turbo chef and deli station where it easily could have fallen into the sandwich stuff. 

I had another coworker that didn't believe in cooking temperatures. So half her stuff was either frozen in the middle or so overcooked it was hard and rubbery. She refused to ever temp anything though and would get chewed out constantly for serving undercooked food.

Then she randomly flipped out and began accusing her husband (who we did not work with and was not present) of cheating on her with a woman he worked with.

A 3 year old immediately asking if you still love them after a typical 3 year old blunder isn't exactly normal. 

Don't get me wrong it could totally happen. BUT its a bit of an extreme reaction from such a small child. Especially if you genuinely talk out why what she's done is bad and reassure her but stay firm with consequences. 

I ask this because my cousin was this way as a kid and it turned out that one parent was saying some hurtful shit to my cousin when the other parent wasn't around.

I know most people's first reaction is going to be ""my wife would never do that!"" But given her reaction to you saying you loved your daughter i am genuinely concerned that your wife has had these feelings of jealousy for awhile now, and she may be taking it out on your daughter when you aren't around either intentionally or unintentionally. Your wife needs medical help, as suggested by other users. 

But please take your daughter to a child psychologist. Preferrably quickly. As this kind of psychological damage can begin manifesting in other ways both behaviorally and emotionally.
