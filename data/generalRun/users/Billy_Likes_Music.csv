CasualConversation,fcp760u,t3_eidnma,1577852720.0,"There's a difference between believing in your point of view vs learning vs being tolerant vs being hateful.

Your title and first statement seems to imply that your communication is alienating others. Additionally later you seem to state you may not be happy about this.

I think you've made an important first step. I'd suggest when you state opinions you leave room for people to give you feedback, ASK if you think there is more to consider.

Do not ask ""Am I right?"" People may agree just to shut you up and you will never really know... Or they might just disagree and you'll strat an entrenched argument.

Good luck... I'm sure other users can add helpful tips."
