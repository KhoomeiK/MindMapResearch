tumblr,fe86n1a,t1_fe6p6up,1578923140.0,"Yeah, I feel that. If you met me, you would honestly never expect that my style of gameplay involved so much murder. I'm not a murder hobo, it isn't my solution to everything, it's just the solution I use most often. My resolution this year's campaign (school club, so we have a new campaign every year) is to only kill when provoked, because we had a kill count of over 300 last year. Granted, most of those were from sinking a few ships, but still. It came back to bite us in the ass, so I'm trying to at least be able to justify most of my murders this year. 

For me, it really comes down to how good my DM is. My current DM isn't the best I've ever had, but he's still excellent. He was our DM last year, too, and he's been good at making NPCs feel real when we meet them. Maybe I put too much of myself in my characters, but it's really hard for me to kill a humanized character. There have been times when I hated him for the emotions he was making me feel, like the Orphanage Incident, but honestly, I wouldn't have it any other way. He's an amazing DM and a great friend."
tumblr,fe84rdb,t1_fe7dura,1578922555.0,"Same. I was already crying after I killed the dogs. These were the same characters I had just spent almost 16 hours (no joke, the Omega Flowey battle was a bitch to finish) fighting to save the lives of, and what had I done immediately after? I had gone back and slaughtered them all, every single one, just because I could. It was already hard to make it to Papyrus. His speech is one of the most heartwrenching, guilt-filled moments I've ever experienced in a video game. It felt *dirty*. I had fallen in love with these characters, from Sans to Napstablook to Temmie to the little grindy ones like Froggit. Even Flowey (Asriel remains my absolute favorite character to this day, by a long shot) had gotten me feeling bad for him. The game is incredible at making you feel like an absolute piece of shit for the brutal, senseless murder spree you're on. The characters feel like real people, who have hopes and dreams just like you and me. 

That's why it's a shame a small part of the fandom has ruined the game for a lot of people, because it's really a fascinating look into the psychology of video games, with a damn good OST to get you through it. Unlike a lot of games there are real consequences for hurting the NPCs, whether you killed one of them or thousands. If you're evil, the game tries to make you feel bad for it. 

That's not to say you have to be a psychopath to get through a NM or Genocide run. You could just be the type of person who doesn't get attached to video game characters, which is fine. But for those of us who do, like me, it's a really interesting deep dive into what makes us tick. The Genocide route is just as fleshed out and excellent as Pacifist, and yet many of us couldn't bring ourselves to finish it, not because of difficult battles like Undyne the Undying and Sans, but because it *hurt too much to do it*. While there are people who gave up because of those battles or because of boredom from the monotonous grind of murdering NPC after NPC, there are a lot of us who were so affected by the game we simply couldn't finish that route. Some of us, like you, abandoned the game after that. I personally chose to continue the game, playing it once or twice a year, but never, ever harming one of the NPCs again. It's truly deeply fascinating to me, and I would like to do a study of Undertale players sometime to see the biggest reason for abandoning the genocide route.

tumblr,fe6hoya,t1_fe4waea,1578891228.0,"Undertale did an excellent job of creating consequences for being evil. Not even mentioning the in-game penalties (*cough Sans cough*), the emotional toll hurting the characters takes on you is rough. The game knows you're awful, and you know you're awful. It really fucks with your head. Toriel caring about your safety, Papyrus wanting to be your friend, Undyne desperately trying to protect what was left of her people from extermination, Sans' desperate, nihilistic attempts to bore you into stopping your senseless, needless murder spree. Each character has a new, different, and more depressing way of making you feel like the complete piece of shit you are for genociding an entire people for no reason other than that you *just can*. 

The part that really got to me was the very end, where even Flowey, a character who canonically can pretty much only feel anger and hate, begs you not to kill him. I know it's Chara in control when you kill him, but it's your actions that caused that. It's an incredibly fucked up ending, and shows how truly evil you were. I felt bad after just watching a playthrough of Genocide."

It's all depressing, though. It's the reason I hail Undertale as the way to do a good/evil game. There are rewards for the good you do, and if you choose to be evil, well... The game forces you to confront the consequences of what you've done. It's been a few years, but I still remember the feeling of striking down enemy after enemy, not thinking about how much murder I was doing, and then landing that one fatal strike on Toriel. I wish I had a video of the shock on my face during that moment. I made it to the Papyrus battle, but my heart wasn't in it. It's incredibly difficult emotionally to be evil in the game, as it should be. Maybe I shouldn't have done Genocide nearly immediately after finishing Pacifist, but oh well.

For the pasta, good old fashioned macaroni is always a favorite, but any pasta of a similar size works. I love shells so it's usually my go-to, but I've also used wheels in the past. You don't even really have to use pasta, honestly. Anything of the size with a neutral flavor will work, as long as there's 16 ounces of it. Get whatever your ""mac"" will be ready first, and set it aside while you prepare everything else. Once you've finished that part, preheat your oven to 350 Fahrenheit (sorry, I'm an idiot American and don't know what that is in Celsius).

As for the cheese sauce, I use about 4 cups of shredded cheese (shred it down from blocks if you can- the pre shredded stuff doesn't melt as well). My cheeses of choice are applewood-smoked gruyere and sharp cheddar, but it's really hard to fuck up mac and cheese, so experiment with whatever cheeses you fancy. You start with a roux (equal parts butter and flour, about 1/4 cup each, whisk over heat until a light golden brown) and slowly whisk in 1 cup heavy cream and 3 cups whole milk. Add your cheese 1 cup at a time, continuing to whisk until fully incorporated. It's at this point where you're gonna want to add any extra goodies if you want them- I use diced mushrooms and bacon, but again, feel free to experiment. Amounts of goodies don't matter very much, since it's up to personal taste. 

Mix the sauce with the pasta, then pour into a baking tin. Get yourself some panko bread crumbs and dump about a cup in a bowl with about 1/4 cup shredded parmesan cheese, and 1/4 cup shredded romano cheese. Those cheeses are optional if you don't like them (it's okay, I don't like parmesan either). Mix in a very small amount of paprika, then spread it on top of the mac and cheese. Pop it in your oven until the panko is starting to turn golden, then pull it out and you've got yourself a delicious family meal. It tastes great served with literally any meat dish, or just by itself. Just make sure you have space to store leftovers, because this recipe makes way more than you'd expect it would, and if you're lazy like me you're not gonna want to take the time to put all the leftovers in smaller containers. 

I just made this exact recipe today, lol. Hope you enjoy!"

AskReddit,fdpajqp,t1_fdmx0rn,1578623839.0,This is hilarious. Your dad sounds like he was a fun dude. I'm glad you're keeping it alive.
AskReddit,fdpa6j2,t1_fdn44v1,1578623593.0,"Aw, that's so cute! My go-to is a hand hug kinda thing, you put your hands together and then lock fingers for a second. It's the closest thing I can get to a hug without going into sensory overload, unless I've really prepared myself for a lot of hugs (like holidays with extended family and such)"
AskReddit,fdp9uda,t1_fdnrn7k,1578623367.0,"This is a great thing to teach kids. I didn't really learn bodily autonomy beyond stranger danger until well into my teens, and the family I have who were the pushiest about it now wonder why they never get a hug."

AskReddit,fdp9iwy,t1_fdmb2hl,1578623158.0,"My grandmother spent most of my life forcing me to hug her every time we saw her, even if I didn't want a hug that day. I saw her often. I've been forced into thousands of hugs in my life. 
Same woman doesn't understand why I never hug her anymore. They used to make me give her ""one hug at Christmas"", but I stopped, because I value my bodily autonomy and she's made it abundantly clear she doesn't care about my personal space (not just through this, other stuff too).
The weird part is, my grandad and all 5 of my great aunts and uncles understand the whole no hugging thing. My grandad only high fives me and it's never something I need to do, I can decline if I want to. His siblings always ask if I want a hug, and never just as a formality, they actually wait for an answer. The only person who never really asked that I was okay with hugging me was the 90+ matriarch of a family that had always been extremely close to mine, and that only because she was very mindful of my space besides that."
