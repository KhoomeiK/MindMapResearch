educationalgifs,ff6rpfn,t1_ff6lo23,1579633482.0,"as powerlifters we use heavy grade belts, Ie thick leather, one width, and metal clasp, as a second layer of muscle for a strong brace.

A 60 yo man who wants to go to the gym to be healthier will use lighter belts, Ie cloth with velcro, in order to support their abdominals and prevent unnecessary stress and injury. 

For most lifters and people a belt is more for injury prevention, for those participating in weightlifting sports it's purpose and build becomes different, same with wraps and sleeves."

Generally we teach to lift with a neutral spine in order to get the rest of the body moving in the correct path, Ie hip hinge and knee bend which have to come along with keeping a stable torso. For most individuals in daily practice they will have enough back strength to pick most things up with a rounded spine and slightly bent knees without pain. The issues arise when the method of lifting something no longer is adequate for the thing being lifted, which can result in injury. The most important thing to lifting anything or any movement is having strong balance and proper bracing of the body, which becomes effectively impossible for most people in the typical bent over knees straight position. Over activation of the lower back is also damaging but we don't commonly see that in most people.

The discussion you linked okay, they base their arguement based of a few assumptions that aren't inherently true, such as stooping not being an awkward posture, and that manual workers being taught different technique is equivalent to pedestrians being taught different technique. A worker is going to see much less benefit from this type of physical cue because they already know how to lift and are strong in their lifting pathway, they don't need to follow this queue exactly because they are already strong. An awkward position is one where it is difficult to generate power from the ground, however they fail to define a stoop when they designate it as 'not awkward'. A locked knee stoop with lesser degrees of hip flexion is incredibly different from a stoop with  unlocked knees and a hip hinge. They both are a stoop but one is a ridiculously stronger position than the other, but nobody knows the difference. If you try and lift anything with locked knees and no hip flexion you WILL feel lbp unless you have specifically trained in that area. Only lift with your back if you know what youre doing, cause one missed judgement with poor form will fuck u up even if uve never had lbp before."
