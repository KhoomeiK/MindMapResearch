I've been playing back since before the first season and I can confirm that this happened quite a bit before SBMM was a thing, so ""not having SBMM"" wouldn't fix this problem. 

>Without the former, you end up playing a normal statistical representation of the player base... so a handful of bronze players, mostly silvers and golds, approximately ten platinums, and perhaps one or two diamond/predator level players.

I would argue that this is largely already what is happening.

The issue people currently have is not SBMM, but rather the lack of SBMM. Whenever you queue up, it'll tell you on the button how many people are queuing, and for me at least, that number is very rarely above 70~, which means that there isn't a large enough pool of players for the game to be picky about who it's matching together, especially when you take into account ping (If it was matching cross-server it'd have an easier time finding people of similar skill levels, but a far more difficult time finding good pings) 

The thing is, it doesn't matter much how many ""full 4k 20k pred squads"" are in the game as long as that number is above zero. Even if there's only one squad that's like... 1 low diamond, 1 pred, 1 high diamond they're still going to absolutely steamroll the rest of the game.  

Obviously people are going to get killed more often by these guys, it's not that they're the majority of the lobby, it's that they're the ones doing the majority of the killing, and unless Apex gets more players, has laxer ping restrictions, or does things like Fortnite to reduce the gap between skilled and unskilled players (i.e. stuff like bloom) this isn't really a problem that has a solution.
