This is useful because they won't want to stick around and see how scary and weird things will get. I mean, what sort of response were you expecting? INTJs are usually emotionally immature until they are young adults or older so just listen to them when they speak because they probably won't talk much when they're really angry. You will be able to tell right away because of how short and dismissive they are if you know them well. Forget trying to figure out how they're feeling when they aren't royally pissed unless you are also an INTJ because they tend to suppress their emotions until there is nothing left to feel.
Hope this helps"

INTP,fbtii9w,t3_ednybz,1577080109.0,I agree. I believe that people with leading Ni or Ti will just make everything a lot more thoughtful. It's like they don't follow a different direction in social interaction than they do with problem solving. Every person is a different individual case that requires a different social lubricant.
