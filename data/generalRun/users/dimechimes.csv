Time to teach I suppose, since no one seems content with educating themselves.

If I shoot a bullet into a bullseye. A single bullet. Is that an accurate shot? Yes. Is it a precise shot? No. It's not because it is a single shot. Precision is would be the grouping.

Saying ""Bloomberg donated in 2018"" is an accurate statement. But it is a singular statement. It is impossible for it to be precise because of it's discrete nature.

A group of facts that relate to each other would be a more precise statement. Both statements could be of equal accuracy but only one has precision.
