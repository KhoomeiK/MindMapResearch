mealtimevideos,ffcnpb5,t1_ffckl7z,1579803341.0,Lol this is what happens when you listen to CNN. You’re an NPC dude.
todayilearned,ffcizia,t1_ffchcoj,1579800478.0,Ok. Maybe im wrong then. But to me it makes sense that if the beans were as common as they were that someone would try to roast and boil them. Afterall its not like inventing the lightbulb.

mealtimevideos,ffcgk01,t1_ffc2sjc,1579798991.0,"1.  Trump did not threathen to withold aid to Ukraine. The president of Ukraine confirmed this and it’s in the transcript of the phone call.

2. The freeze of aid to Ukraine was done by the budget office to ensure the spending was inline with US foreign policy. This is nothing rare btw.

3. Trump asked for Ukraine to look into Hunter Biden because of how his prosecution was stopped by his father and his sketchy business in Ukraine were there is clear sign of big corruption. The guy sits on a board without any knowledge and is making millions and millions of dollars. Bidens son is not protected from investigation because his father is running for president. You guys have investigated the president of the USA for almost 3 years without any proof for the purpose of a smear campaign, you have no say in this.

4. He did not ask a foreign power to interfere in our election. He asked for information about a US citizens business in Ukraine where there is sign of corruption. Hunter Biden is not protected from investigations because his father is running for president.

5. He didn’t violate the law on Ukraine military aid (which btw he created). Obama didnt send Ukraine military aid it was Trump. It was simply a temporary freeze by the white house budget office. You have no proof Trump even asked for this.

6. All those witnesses you mentioned were anti-trumpers. And their testimony colide with others who overheard the phone call. When people who have written on twitter that they want the president impeached less than one year into his presidency then they have no credibility.

Btw. stop listening to what ”some experts” say. Stop listening to authority and listen to the facts only. I would rather listen to a farmer to speaks the facts than expert that uses his authority to lie."

todayilearned,ffby570,t1_ffbvrp9,1579786497.0,It was common by Ethiopian tribes to roast and boil the beans which became coffee. And this was before Yemen imported the beans through trade from Ethiopia. Why do you think they wanted to import this thing if it didnt have to do with how the Ethiopians used it?

I think that’s a pretty good reason to vote for him. Trump is a patriot who is the only one who gave a fuck about the forgotten Americans who had lost their jobs to China or Mexico. The jobs are back and America dont need socialism or globalism.

movies,fc91rmu,t1_fc8ej1n,1577545636.0,"Im not arguing about the nazis being monsters, ofcourse they were. I just disagree with you that the Soviet were the good guys. Both sides were evil, the good guys were the western allies, they were the ones that actually liberated Europe. Most wars throughout history were between two bad sides and not one bad side vs one good side. There doesn’t have to be one good side in a war. And let’s not forget that Soviet union eventually murdered between 40 to 60 million people.

And ive heard 2 million rapes by the germans, but can you give source for 25 million? Also the Russians committed more rapes under a shorter period of time. And rapes continued 3 to 4 years after the war ended in eastern Germany and Poland."
movies,fc87cw6,t1_fc7nfly,1577528513.0,"Invasion of eastern Poland. Occupation of eastern Europe and it’s enslavement. The burning and raping of Poland when they ”liberated it”. The mass rape of women, elders and little girls in Berlin (millions of rapes). The war crimes and slaughter of 20000 captured polish military prisoners. War crimes against ukrainians and baltics civilians. Thousands if not millions sent to gulags including civilians from other countries. Mass torture and massacres against civilians. The mass rape of women and little girls in Krakow. The burning of cities, towns and villages even after the war.

Read your fucking history.

Edit: there is so much more and let’s not forget the raping of women who were in concentration camp. The Soviet were in some places worse than the nazis."
