BeardedDragons,ff978io,t1_ff86nig,1579706474.0,"Top one is a 4’x3’ “tall” Vision cage made of PVC plastic I believe. It’s pretty old, I got it with a corn snake in it a few years back. They’re really solid cages, got a few nooks and crannies that are difficult to clean though and the doors have no handles on them... the one on the bottom is very similar in dimensions but it’s handmade by a gentleman down in Kamloops/Kelowna (BC) area. When I got it, it was just raw plywood (paid $200) and I stained it and sealed it myself. The plastic one fits perfectly inside the groove on the top of the wooden one. It’s like they were made for each other!"

BeardedDragons,ff7lsap,t1_ff7k4yv,1579652595.0,"I’m not sure, he’s not shed in a long time (few months) but I think he might’ve caught the scent of my other dragon (Bean Sprout) and that must’ve thrown him over. He’s almost 2 years old now so I’m thinking he’s at that “young adult” hormonal stage? His femoral pores are crazy enlarged atm"
BeardedDragons,ff7lift,t1_ff7kza9,1579652407.0,"Well he’s above him and I didn’t take him out so probably not, but I did feed Bean Sprout before Mushu, so maybe he caught his scent."

Awwducational,fe6c9ix,t1_fe6btr9,1578886775.0,Absolutely ! I guess that makes me a beach ruining twat though :( to be fair it was one of those resort beaches that was raked over and sort of ruined. It had shark nets hanging out a ways into the water that fenced the whole beach in and prevented natural fishes from coming up the beach
Awwducational,fe6b4vm,t1_fe6au0c,1578885941.0,"True, it could’ve been that. Google says “It is illegal by Dominican law to take the shells”"

Awwducational,fe6a5z5,t1_fe5amvf,1578885238.0,"Don’t recall why they’re illegal, but I had it all packed up tightly with cushions and stuff to protect it from breaking and when I went into the airport there was a conch shell on display under “prohibited items”. I got my bag ripped thru and searched a few times on that trip too but nobody found my shell! I’m guessing being that it was part of native wildlife there comes a risk of specific diseases and stuff that the shell could carry. Also given that I took it right off the beach, it was not treated, sterilized or sealed in any way."
Awwducational,fe57xg0,t1_fe57gyl,1578866401.0,"Sometimes you get lucky and the shells are empty, then you can keep them. I found a big shell washed up on the beach in Dominican Republic so I illegally smuggled it home so It can look pretty on my shelf :)"

oddlyspecific,fdrzd51,t1_fdqsatp,1578691955.0,Right that must be similar to how it works here too.
oddlyspecific,fdqitfd,t1_fdpp6mr,1578667722.0,"Wow. Okay so I think how it goes where I’m from (BC, Canada) is you have 3 months probation. Within those 3 months, the establishment can decide to fire you or keep you. You typically get a”review” that states if you can stay or go. After that though, you have to get 3 written infractions, within the same category (ie. work quality, customer service etc.) in order to be terminated. So, someone could be written up several times, but in all different categories and not be eligible for termination. So what us Canadians like to do, is to either a) try and “sway” someone into fucking up in the same category multiple times or b) fire them without proper documentations and pray to god that they don’t go to the labour board. So in other words: it’s really fucking hard to get fired here unless you fuck up BAD. 

Full disclosure: I have no idea if this is actually how it goes, I supervised a pet store for a year once though and from what I experienced there and my other work establishments, this is how it goes."
oddlyspecific,fdqhy6y,t1_fdqhcb2,1578667116.0,"My work got into a lot of legal trouble a while back for doing something like that though, I think the labor laws might be different up here in Canada though.

In reality bearded dragons need crickets and other bugs, vitamin powders, as well as a hearty mixture of dark greens and vegetables (mustard greens, kale, dandelions, Swiss chard, collard greens etc...) but a lot of people who buy dragons don’t realize that crickets creak, worms wiggle, and bugs escape. To combat this, they feed pelleted foods, which in turn they unknowingly make their dragons malnourished and sick.
