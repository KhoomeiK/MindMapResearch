todayilearned,feug2vk,t1_feu9cy4,1579386176.0,"Obviously it’s not the same exact pieces of paper. If it were, that would be a way more impressive story. 

Here’s another article that has a more extensive write-up: https://reelrundown.com/film-industry/Same-newspaper-prop-in-different-movies"

Moviesinthemaking,fetrrtt,t1_fetqqno,1579379147.0,"Maybe! Given everything I’ve learned today it seems be a pretty common practice to reuse sets/props, which make a ton of sense."

Moviesinthemaking,fet4x65,t1_fet45zh,1579371816.0,Interesting! Reminds me that it always bugs me when I see palm trees or California specific trees/plants in shows that are supposed to take place in a different areas of the country (US version of The Office comes to mind)
Moviesinthemaking,fesng5a,t1_fesk8yu,1579367097.0,I’m willing to suspend my disbelief
Moviesinthemaking,fesl8d2,t1_feshbia,1579366391.0,Aha! Thanks. The article you shared pretty much confirmed my suspicions about the Oval Office in particular. It just seems too impractical to build for individual productions and doubted filming happened in the real place.
AskReddit,fes00bg,t3_eqhffp,1579360075.0,"I could be wrong, but I’m assuming this is a thing to share major sets of iconic locations or maybe even businesses that specialize in set/prop rentals.  I had this thought the other day while watching the show Veep and wondered if scenes in the Oval Office/White House were actually filmed on location or if rooms were recreated just for that show.  Seems like a lot of work to create a replica just for one show and filming on location is probably very difficult for a series like this."
