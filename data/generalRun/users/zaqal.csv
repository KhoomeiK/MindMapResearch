TooAfraidToAsk,ff3za1m,t3_erc31s,1579552116.0,"I'm honestly unsure of where this Eastern European paradise is. Gay marriage isn't legal in the majority of Eastern Europe, gay pride protesters were attacked at multiple events last year in Poland and Russia is famous for discriminating against homosexuals (not that they're the only country which does it).

Women are still not treated as equals to men, there is still huge societal discrimination against women in traditionally male professions and there were literal protests in many countries over the Instabul Convention being signed.

God forbid if you're an ethnic minority or trans.

You're either very misinformed or a liar because this attitude you've described here does not exist anywhere in Eastern Europe."

I do agree with you that separating a field into ""the beautiful and the vulgar"" is an elitist mindset and those who work the ""vulgar"" jobs are, in the end, the only people needed to sustain a society. They're fundamental.

Iamactuallyverybadass,fclj7xr,t1_fcks1r0,1577749054.0,The Forbes article says guns are used defensively 500 000 - 3 000 000 times a year. It does not say that number of lives is saved. It does not account for the times said guns are used to protect people against the guns being used offensively. It definitely isn't a proof of guns saving lives.

Anarchism,fchoz6z,t1_fch7riu,1577652615.0,Yup. That phrase is a meme made to mock the mentality you've described.
changemyview,fchoq0h,t3_eh9iwx,1577652526.0,"For what reason should anyone be forced to study anything?

Generally, when talking about the individual freedoms of a person, arguments like ""it would be better to do this, therefore we will force them to do that"" or ""imagine how much better society would be if we forced everyone do to X"" are disregarded by most, since we understand that a person's rights cannot be compromised, even if said compromise would provide a temporary benefit to the person.

In rare instances, and, suspiciously, in instances where the people arguing about something aren't the ones who's rights are being compromised, this mentality is completely ahandoned. One example is  this - mandatory schooling. Others include prison, the treatment of people with mental disabilities and illnesses, etc.

The essence of my argument is this: we, as a society, have agreed that the individual liberties of a person cannot be compromised, even if the end result would benefit society and that person. Why does this particular situation deserve a completely different mentality? Why should anyone be forced to study anything?"
