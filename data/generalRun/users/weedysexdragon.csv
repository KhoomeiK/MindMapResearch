America treats its weakest members with contempt. Those are the three main points of any far right ideology, in groups, out groups and contempt. Couple that up with mistaking wealth for righteousness and base line misogyny and you  have a simple recipe for right wing morons to follow. If you don’t think and you believe that might makes right, then it all makes perfect sense. 

Young teenage men specifically feel alienated by high school. They can also feel like they’re being held back. Which they are because were waiting for them to mature and be useful in society.  They believe that they’re being held back by the system. A system that they see as spending inordinate resources on the weak; women, cripples, immigrants and minorities. It’s a pretty easy leap to make if you don’t think it through. “The system is wasting resources AND holding ME back”. “NOW DO YOU SEE THE INEFFICIENCY OF THE SYSTEM!”

freefolk,ff1qxai,t1_feyr2ai,1579484216.0,"Can I just bitch about the ending a bit as an amateur dork history guy?   

The problem of the Iron Throne, just as with the English throne in the war of the roses, is that the king isn’t strong enough to reign in his high lords. Putting Bran on the throne doesn’t change that. Interestingly though, putting not insane Danerys on the throne with 5k Unsullied and some Dothraki cavalry actually does change the dynamic enough that I assumed that’s why Martin put them there.  

Putting a guy on the throne who doesn’t have kids is a mistake, putting someone on the throne who CANT have kids is just asking for civil war when he dies.  No, fuck that, it’s demanding a civil war. Oh and what’s the life expectancy of a paraplegic in 1400? Yay.  We bought ourselves 8 years!!

The war of the roses is kicked off by a child king in Henry 6 being weak and the political nonsense that flared up as powerful lords jockeyed for power.  The entire Plantagenet dynasty is plagued by succession issues. The end of this show just a precursor to another war in 10 years.  

There would be lords all over that kingdom plotting against the throne from day one of Brans reign.
