You guys have made a fantastic product, but the cost on those being half the cost of a printed mini (or more than a mini from Reaper) from you has kept me from purchasing. I'd be buying piles of them if you could get it to a sub $5 price."

FortCollinsClassified,fdgwtyl,t1_fderjrp,1578410285.0,"I broke into the IT field in Fort Collins about five years ago and have been rapidly advancing. FRII is a great place to get a start, though the pay is abysmal. In my experience knowing someone always helps, but that's just life. I have found that the it field is fairly egalitarian and values knowledge and abilities over certifications.
