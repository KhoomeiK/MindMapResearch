aww,ffch0dq,t1_ffcf5ik,1579799271.0,"Thank you for providing an actual study. I don’t plan on getting a cat any time soon, but I’ll read through that for sure"
aww,ffce1kv,t1_ffcdkj4,1579797449.0,"I understand your reasoning. I still don’t see any “necessary need” for claws on indoor cats, sure it might be unnecessary and painful (as all surgeries are), but those aren’t “needs” like hunting and escaping are. I don’t want a cat attacking myself, my pets, or others, for sometimes random and unprovoked reasons, so I would feel safer without claws, but that’s just me. It’s clear we are at an impasse, so I’m going to stop responding. Have a good rest of your day"
aww,ffcd5yy,t1_ffccpnd,1579796900.0,"Any surgical procedure on an animal is painful, but that’s what medicine and time is for. I’m thinking about that one video of the girl getting in the suitcase, then when she gets out her cat attacks her, drawing blood. Everyone said to put the cat down, when likely it was just spooked by what was going on. Should that cat die? No. If it didn’t have claws it wouldn’t have been an issue"
aww,ffccibf,t1_ffcboku,1579796492.0,"So you agree all cats are different, some might help with brushing and some might hate it. I think that could be applied to training cats as well, just like any other animal, some are easily trained and others are stubborn. Do you have any concrete reasoning for why an indoor cat needs their claws? Removing them just seems safer for everyone; you may have a well trained cat, but they can be unpredictable"
aww,ffcb96k,t1_ffcall9,1579795705.0,"My family has had a Maine coon since i was in 5th grade (I’m now 26). He has always put up a huge fight when brushing, particularly his stomach

I also see pics everywhere of peoples arms scratched up from their cats, and they think it’s funny almost"
aww,ffcacuz,t1_ffc9nsv,1579795140.0,"How does one teach a cat that? Isn’t it inherent to them to scratch? Or what about when you’re putting them through something that they might not like, but is good for them, like brushing their fur?"
aww,ffca82e,t1_ffc9y1e,1579795058.0,"I’m thinking about that one video a little while back where a girl got into a suitcase and when she got out, her cat freaked out and attacked her and she had very noticeable bloody cuts. Everyone was saying how the cat should be put down. If it was declawed it wouldn’t have been an issue"
aww,ffc7qof,t1_ffc79az,1579793475.0,"You can’t get by nearly as well as a blind person. My grandpa didn’t just get by, he had a perfectly normal life. So back to cats, who are just laying around, eating, and maybe batting some toys. Do they need their fingertips?"
aww,ffc6jvz,t1_ffc69gn,1579792702.0,"He lost multiple. 4/5 on one hand and 3/5 on the other. I’m sure it was hard at first but he preferred losing them to dying, and he was able to go on great with life once he adjusted"
aww,ffc64kf,t1_ffc5ggk,1579792421.0,"I wasn’t asking about scalps, I’m asking about fingertips. People most definitely can live a full life without them, my grandpa did. I’m not trying to argue, I’m asking a genuine question"
aww,ffc5b51,t1_ffc1n21,1579791870.0,"Not disagreeing with you here, just a genuine question. If the cat is an indoor cat, do they really need the tips of their “fingers”? They aren’t hunting, and don’t need to worry about escaping predators"
