Had a couple of ideas that are a bit unusual:

 Shinx, sandile and spheal, and Luxray, Krookodile and Walrein could be a good final stage, only potential issue would be the difference in levels for evolution.

Houndour, Carvanha and Snover, with ability to mega evolve available in the mid-game e.g. after the 4th/5th gym"

PremierLeague,fee27fr,t1_fedls2c,1579024860.0,"Just to give you a 'brief' overview:

We used to be one of the biggest clubs in England, in 1996 we hired Arsene Wenger - a foreign manager which at the time was virtually unheard of in the PL. Wenger revolutionised football in this country and led us to multiple League and Cup wins including the 2003/04 season where we were undefeated in the league over an entire season.

In 2006 Arsenal built a new state of the art stadium, it cost millions of pounds, and resulted in years of the club prioritising financial stability over winning trophies. For a long time, finishing in the top 4 and getting into the Champions League (CL) was such a big financial boost that it seemed to be our target for the season, just to be in the top 4 spots.

By the time the stadium debt was paid off and we were ready to shell out big money on big players, Wenger had been our manager for about 20 years, and had been trophyless for 8 years or so. He was almost bigger than the club, and every major decision was his. His footballing philosophy had been adapted and improved by younger managers and he was seen as a footballing dinosaur.

We won 3 FA Cups in 2014, '15 and '17, and despite his contract expiring in 2017, the FA cup win meant he signed a new 2 year deal, despite finishing 5th, our first year outside the top 4 since he became our manager. 

Wenger 'retired' at the end of the 2018 season and our club was in a bit of a mess. We had two world class strikers in Lacazette and Aubameyang who had been bought for £100m+ between them, but our goalkeeper was 36 and on the verge of retirement, and barely any decent defenders or defensive midfielders, which was the main reason why we were losing games.

We hired a new manager Unai Emery, and in his first year we made it to the final of the Europa League, if we won the competition, we would be back in the CL, even though we finished in 5th place again. We lost 4-1 to Chelsea, a big London rival.

Emery lasted just over a year before he was fired, he was replaced by his assistant manager Freddie Ljungberg - an ex-arsenal legend and part of the 2003/04 unbeaten squad - as interim manager, after 2 games, the board decided we needed better than an ex-arsenal player and PL assistant manager - so we hired Mikel Arteta, an ex-arsenal player and assistant manager at Manchester City.

We're only 10th this year, but we have an innate ability to lose the easiest of games, steal extremely undeserved wins out the bag against mid-table clubs and when we're in truly shocking form and I'm expecting a huge battering, somehow play to perfection against a team like Manchester United"

Machop, Pidgey/Starly and Geodude

Shinx, sandile and spheal

I'm yet to find a game where gyms aren't all type based, and I think I'd want to make a hack where gym leaders still have a theme, but not always the type of their team, e.g. a baby gym, a canine/feline gym, fossil gym (though this would pretty much be a rock type gym too), and a group I want to call the 'African' pokemon - Pyroar, Zebstrika, Girafarig, Hippowdon, Donphan etc. that look very similar to their real world counterparts of African animals and less like original video game monsters."
