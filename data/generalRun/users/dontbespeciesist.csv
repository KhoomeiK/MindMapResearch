aww,ffxbfj5,t3_evqf1j,1580321706.0,Those tiny wings!
IsItBullshit,ffxbbos,t1_ffxakhd,1580321643.0,I wish I could upvote this comment multiple times.
aww,ffx9twc,t3_evq27w,1580320747.0,"Personally, I think all runway models should be allowed to randomly take a swing at or trip the next model coming down the line."
whatisthisthing,fffehag,t3_etccf0,1579882191.0,Looks like it might be a type of plumb bob. Google “old plumb bob tool”.
RoastMe,ff612no,t3_ernxxd,1579616411.0,Why does it look like your nostrils have eyebrows?
millionairemakers,feqvvcd,t3_eq81a8,1579346689.0,Good luck everyone. My winnings towards building out an inlaw apartment for my aging parents so they can retire close to family.
rarepuppers,fedm8ou,t1_fedknrk,1579014976.0,Sounds like everything's worked out for the best. She looks like an awesome pup!
rarepuppers,fedk9vd,t1_fedhdar,1579013641.0,"Well, just a thought... If you have a good cold pond by you where she can swim throw a stick a few times. If she doesn't hesitate going into the water after a few times and she isn't shaking like a leaf from the cold chances are she has a lab-type coat that's keeping her warm in the wet water :)

Regardless, she's beautiful. Did you have her checked for a microchip?"
rarepuppers,fedgzqx,t1_fedgizl,1579011271.0,"That does sound small, but she could have a lot of growing left. That said, looking at her paws I wouldn’t guess that she’s full lab, but honestly it is very hard to tell these things from a picture. Is she very toothy? ( does she tend to chew and perhaps lightly hold your hands or forearm in your mouth when she’s excited? How does her coat feel? Does it have a very slight oily feel?"
rarepuppers,fedgc9t,t3_eolmqf,1579010773.0,Looks like a strong amount of Labrador to me.
whatisthisthing,fdqiaxu,t3_emr7vx,1578667365.0,"Could it be an automatic shut off key? Some equipment requires this key to be in place to function. The key would be around your wrist, neck or attached to your shirt so if you walk away, fall, etc. The key would pull out and quickly shut off or lock out the equipment that you were using."
ShittyLifeProTips,fdnxawh,t3_emdnoy,1578594730.0,"Technically true, i guess"
facepalm,fdnx8ah,t1_fdnwvcd,1578594688.0,My personal favorite was the guess that was in the vicinity of Long Island.
FloridaMan,fdnwy3t,t3_emdo6u,1578594525.0,We can only hope that the president is able to raise to the potential assailant's level to overcome such a threat.
rarepuppers,fdmz07g,t3_em8rwl,1578571932.0,I'd react the same way
aww,fdl9af5,t3_elz8yj,1578519225.0,I hope this ended well and not with the dog running around the house yelping with a hermit crab firmly attached to his nose...
calvinandhobbes,fdk4u3b,t1_fdk09gk,1578496078.0,Thanks!
calvinandhobbes,fdjzr6w,t3_elt4kb,1578492421.0,I want this t-shirt
AskMen,fdhrieg,t3_elacu8,1578428759.0,"Am i the only one that actually finds short guys attractive? I mean...i see 5'8"" and that's a plus as far as I'm concerned."
Breadit,fdhj2sq,t3_elfvkp,1578423707.0,Gorgeous
castiron,fdh1cmg,t3_elc6kw,1578413244.0,"Just was out visiting my brother and spent the week cooking with cast iron on an induction cook top. Works like a charm ( the pan heats up very quickly- don't add oil to the pan until you are ready to add what ever you are cooking, or the oil will scorch). His pans didn't sit perfectly flush on the surface due to the small ridge on the bottom of the pan... Not an issue at all."
gardening,fddwlkm,t1_fddvzw0,1578325755.0,Looks great. It'd be worth putting on blocks to allow the bottom timbers to stay off the ground to avoid rot.
ExpectationVsReality,fcxkmis,t3_ejfueq,1578065234.0,That could be hilarious on a windy day...
whatisthisthing,fcxfbmg,t3_ejfsun,1578061442.0,"YSK, that you can also use a ""figure eight cable"" instead of buying a regional adapter from Apple. These cables can be bought cheaply from most any electronics store and plug into the hole in the Apple power supply brick once you remove the regional adapter piece you are looking to buy.

A lot of older electronics use these, so there might even be one around the house."
facepalm,fcu8h4r,t1_fctpau4,1577975039.0,Don't forget to pour boiling water over the dent first or the surface will just crack.
castiron,fcrwnyj,t3_eimk3p,1577907644.0,Any pics of the bottoms?
