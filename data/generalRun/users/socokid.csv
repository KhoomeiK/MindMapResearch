I am not aware of any display company offering warranties that are 10 years long. No. The vast, vast majority of people would upgrade within 10 years simply due to the age of the tech, in that there would be vastly better/cheaper options to have come out within that 10 years. 

That's a good display (the one you linked) assuming you are using an NVidia GPU in your current build as it comes with G-Sync

> How does 1080p media look on 1440p??

Absolutely fine. 

> How do games look on 1440p? Is there much of a difference in gaming in terms of overall graphics?

It's f'n fantastic. It's clearer, sharper, you don't see pixels, etc... This can also be assumed. Of course it looks better. A lot better. That's a ***lot*** more pixels. 

> some of my friends prefer 1080p ultra over 1440p med is that true that the former is better?

No... look, if you are playing 1440p at medium, your GPU isn't matched to that display well. A PC gamer playing at medium graphics specs defeats a large purpose of playing on PC. I would much rather play at 1080p at Ultra and higher refresh rate, over medium graphics at a much lower refresh rate all day long, yes absolutely. 

> .Other then gaming how/in what way is 1440p useful?

Useful? The display itself uses more picture elements, and is therefore quite a bit sharper/clearer. These questions are getting tedious and silly. What?

> How will 1080p scale to 1440p with the new integer scaling for rtx cards for games

Why would anyone do that... no. Play at the native resolution, which will ***always*** look better, and match your GPU.

> Are there any major cons

If your GPU is weak, you'll be playing at low graphics settings and low frame rate, two things that are the bane of PC gamers. 

> Is the fps drop significant enough to regret ur purchase?

No, because I purchased a GPU that could push that many pixels at high frame rates. I had a 1080 at first, currently have a 2080 Super. Both worked great on 1440p. 

> Will the rtx 2080 super drive 1440p144hz satisfactorily(75+fps by tweaking some settings) 

The 2080 Super will be perfect for at 1440p 144hz Display. Depending on the game, you'll get 75+ ***easy***. Very graphic intensive games like Read Dead 2, I get ~75 with maxed settings. You'll get much more in other games, no worries there. 

> for the next 3-4 years

Probably. That is mostly dependent on the games that release and the GPUs that come out in that time. But, my son is still playing at 1080p with a GTX 970. He's due for an upgrade, but that thing is over 5 years old. 

> Do you in any way miss 1080p?

Hell. No. Not in any way, shape or form. Zero regrets. Period. 

> Would seeing a 1440p144hz and 1080p144hz monitor in person rly help in making my decision?

For 2020, absolutely. 

However, I was one of the many people that played Witcher 1 when it first came out and was blown away. There was a reason Witcher 2 was so anticipated.

I had yet to play a game that had *all* of the RPG elements I wanted, with very high quality graphics, a large world (for the time), and also presented an incredible story filled with extreme moral ambiguity, a narrative that changed with decisions, a battle style that at the time was bold if not clunky (I liked it), and it seemed to come out of freaking ***NO***where. 

I have been a gaming hobbyist since the late 70's (I'm old and still play a LOT of video games). Stumbling across that gem with zero expectations was something I still talk about today."

But it's a moot question because there is literally no way 67 Senators are going to vote to remove Donald Trump from office, and Donald Trump couldn't care less about anything other than that fact."

*Will* be?

He is already the second most hated man in America for large swaths of people. However, a minority of rabid voters in Kentucky keep putting him back in power, and they like that he's destroying our democratic republic for power afforded to him by his real masters... the wealthy people he keeps giving all of our resources to as the deficit skyrockets.

He is already impeached without ambiguity. Donald Trump is an impeached President. The House voting to formally charge Donald with crimes is an impeachment in totality. That was done. 

This will be the ***third*** time the Senate will conduct a trial based on that impeachment, however. If the Senate finds him guilty (they won't), then he could be removed."

I know swaths of people that live just 50 miles away from Chicago that think that. Unless you've been there, or are familiar with pretty much any large city, it's a common theme, unfortunately. 

I usually tell them that it's an amazing city, just as long as they don't accidentally join a gang on the South side, which is generally do-able..."
