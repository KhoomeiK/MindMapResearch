science,ffw15eu,t3_evbhc2,1580279999.0,This makes sense.  GPA is largely work ethic and how committed you are.  ACT score is just raw problem solving and reading comprehension.
fatlogic,ffw0ud1,t3_evap0l,1580279673.0,"The desire for a quick dopamine rush isn't ""hunger.""  You can crave something and not need it.  We were celebrating a birthday party at the office earlier today, and food didn't cross my mind until I saw the beautiful cake.  Then all of the sudden I wanted a slice..  This doesn't mean my body required the cake; this isn't hunger.  Hunger is when you have gone a long time without eating and its a very different feeling."

But if we are going to generalize, I do recognize that the ""community"" in particular has a problem and needs a good purifying or a schism."
