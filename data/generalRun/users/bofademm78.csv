DidntKnowIWantedThat,fg8kio9,t3_exegoc,1580622405.0,Started today in Jackson county Oregon.
YouShouldKnow,fg8k315,t1_fg8ivda,1580621994.0,Article 1 Section 8 grants Congress the power to collect taxes. The 16th ammendment allows Congress to collect income tax. That wasn't so hard.
YouShouldKnow,fg8jt6i,t3_exgczj,1580621734.0,"This is most tired line ever. ""Give the Gov a free loan"". A $1500 lump sum is far better than an extra $50 or so per check."
geography,fg708fp,t3_ex5kzb,1580580957.0,Congrats. Try quizzes on Jetpunk. Jetpunk is better than Sporcle.
TheSilphRoad,fg2ofz7,t3_ewjev6,1580449882.0,Wow! Some super douchey a holes in here. So sorry to bother everyone.
changemyview,fg0drfb,t3_ew6xyi,1580405668.0,"It's a about ""charisma"", good or bad. Go back 30+ years. The most charismatic candidate won every time. Dole or Clinton? No question. Reagan or Mondale? No question. Clinton or Bush? No question. Gore or Bush? Oddly enough, Bush. Obama vs. McCain or Romney? No brainers. Clinton or Trump? Unfortunately Trump for all the wrong reasons.  That's my theory."

gis,fg09llm,t1_fg03d9z,1580403160.0,I agree GISP is useless and expensive. I just seems like there is some venting about the future of GIS that is not adding to the conversation. Posting that future GIS jobs will just be data preparers doesn't help anyone who is thinking about getting in to GIS.
gis,fg0922x,t1_fg0092o,1580402834.0,They're not criticizing. Criticism adds to a conversation. They're vomiting negativity. It doesn't add to the discussion.
gis,ffzzfjt,t3_ew5krv,1580396750.0,"Sounds like some people need a change in career. Please shit on our chosen jobs and make us feel as if we are already obsolete. The economy and life are uncertain enough. We don't need disgruntled naysayers trying to bring us down more.

The GISP may be toothless and may never have meaning, but please don't use this type of post to spread negativity. If you feel obsolete and don't like the direction GIS is heading, find another job."

politics,ff3jadq,t3_erd01f,1579542243.0,"Bernie is amazing, but Bernie is too old. It's TRUE. We do not need an 80 year old president. He gets my vote if he wins the primary but I support Warren more. Bernie better pick a good goddamn VP."
YouShouldKnow,ff3hyi5,t3_ere17n,1579541426.0,Glad I live in Oregon. I get to sit in my car and someone else pumps the gas.
changemyview,ff3hnw1,t1_ff373nw,1579541245.0,Work injuries while telecommuting... Like Gilbert from Revenge of the Nerds breaking his leg playing chess?
changemyview,ff3h5kx,t3_ere339,1579540929.0,"I have been WFH for over 7 years. I visit my office once per week and other times when necessary. It is great, but it brings a lot of baggage. 
- motivation ebbs and flows
- distractions are everywhere
- staying on task can be a struggle sometimes
- being out of sight out if mind with those in charge can lead to job security anxiety 
- lack of supervision can lead to complacency
- lack of personal interactions with workmates 

There are tons of pros and cons but if you are a social I suggest you stay in the office. A mix of office time and WFH is probably best."

changemyview,fem2rw1,t3_eptp94,1579237854.0,"Sorry, but that is the lamest and most overused line... ""... gave the government an interest free loan"". A lump sum of 1500 to 3000 is much more useful than an extra 40 to 80 per paycheck."

StLouis,fdoz6dg,t3_emhti7,1578616220.0,I wear my Cardinals hat daily here in Oregon. It is a calling card to tourists and StL expats regularly.
StLouis,fdkk1jl,t3_eluteq,1578505263.0,"Great review. I have a strong affinity for my hometown. I don't get to visit much anymore. I live in Oregon so I am not in a beer desert, but I am always eager to explore the beer scene whenever I am in St. Louis."
