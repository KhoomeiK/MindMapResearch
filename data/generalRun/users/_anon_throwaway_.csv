Like, it would take a while, and consoling would be mandatory. 

I'm imagining myself in the exact same scenario and yeah you have to make sure there are consequences and that your partner earns your trust back.

There are long term partners who make mistakes and make it through situations like this and come out stronger. I know a few couples. I think it's when the offender repeats mistakes, won't work on themselves, or fall back on manipulation tactics, that the partnership is destined to fail."

A beta male, or simply a new male to the pod, will pretend to be a female in order to get accepted. I got the impression from the documentary that the beta just exhibited female dolphin behavior in order to not be threatening and to be accepted."

Standup,ff6if6w,t1_ff6f2tn,1579627873.0,"I've definitely see a bias but I think the bias makes sense based off of the amount of dudes in the crowd vs women.

There's always that one guy in the scene that has to say something after a girl's set about how ""vagina jokes are not funny and he's heard them all before"" while dick and ball jokes are just common practice.

I've heard women complain about ball jokes but since there are less women in comedy there are less ball joke complaints.

I don't much care for or against any subject matter. Joke just needs to be funny.

EDIT:

Also to answer OP, who gives a fuk? Tell jokes that you like. If you are having the time of your life with your ball dick and vagina jokes, go for it. It's your time, do what you want with it."

look at the first 150lb girl you see. and keep looking. There's variation.

I can dm you a photo of me. 150 is not big on me(im 140lb now). I get called skinny and tiny and thin all the time.

Weight isn't as important as body composition.  I get some FAs use that as an excuse, but I'd be happy at 145lbs if it were muscle gain. Which is my goal. That and 19.5% body fat. (I'm about 20.2%).

Attraction isn't even preference. If you said gay people had a preference for same sex... that's wrong. It's an orientation. Preference makes it sound like you weren't born that way. 

And that's why they use that language. Saying you can change your preference doesn't sound so bad. But trying to get people to change their orientation... yeah..."

I'm 5'7 and at most I weighed 150lb and dudes were shocked because I'm thin and 150 is suppose to be big, I guess. 

tbf I don't really know how to gauge a man's weight. If they're tall I guess 180-200lbs. Anything heavier I can't really discern.
