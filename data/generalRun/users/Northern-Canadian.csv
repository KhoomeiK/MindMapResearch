AskReddit,ffveoh2,t1_ffuwj0m,1580262355.0,That’s adorable. But also shit; y’all must be great people to one another to decide on such a thing so young.
AskReddit,ffuwv8b,t1_ffuj8w0,1580250873.0,"This is the only reason I feel like people believe shaving makes it grow back thicker.

There are too many instances of this; and not just puberty.

I’m 30 and well past puberty; however it wasn’t until I did a close shave in a few areas that suddenly in the past year it’s grown back full force."
AskReddit,ffuvqj4,t1_ffuuz3k,1580250253.0,"Married at 18? This always baffles me. I know it’s really common in the states but oh my god that’s terrifying.
I’m happy for you though that 7 years later and all is well!"
worldnews,fftd9bb,t1_ffsv1hs,1580217102.0,"Actual science question then here.

Would a Bactria infection be considered alive?
And a virus not?

What’s really the difference between them that makes a virus not to be considered live.

worldnews,fftcrmc,t1_fft38u7,1580216645.0,Good for them; it’s working for lots of other places like Canada so this should go in through I hope. They have successful examples to pull from.
science,fftcadl,t1_ffr7es1,1580216194.0,"A brief anecdote.

I suffer/suffered from severe migraines and headaches from age 10+. Over the years I would have bouts of taking Tylenol daily for extended periods of time days; weeks. I popped them to help curb a headache from becoming a migraine.

I felt dulled emotionally during those times; the highs and lows just weren’t there. Like riding the rollercoaster of life and instead of shouting with glee or nearly crying from fear it was a muted “oh, yay...,oh, no...” the odd thing is, I never felt depressed like that. At the time being dulled wasn’t depressing at all. I just felt like I was very in control and balanced when it came to emotions; not overly excited or sad. I often wonder if I ever really missed the mark in developing deep rooted emotions because of this.

I’m a genuinely happy 30 year old now. But I still don’t peak or valley like some people are capable of doing with certain experiences."

You’re gunning for the downvotes OP."
KidsAreFuckingStupid,fft7qry,t1_ffsy05w,1580211272.0,"Uh, a 5 year old knows not to swallow shit that’s not food. 7 is especially special...

Either way; kids don’t need air pods. Ridiculous purchase for a child."

I’m new to the geelong this past year, but I’ve been exploring everywhere every weekend. I see a lot of young families down at the waterfront with kids having a bbq and such. You could try that?"
funny,fft5f9u,t1_ffsq8lv,1580208066.0,"Oh god.
There truly is a hentai for everything.

Makes you wonder if the artists just enjoy drawing this or if they are all contracted works.

I can’t see someone being a good artist and thinking “this is it; this is what I want to use my skills for”"
funny,fft4o7l,t1_ffswad5,1580206930.0,"Legitimately I did something similar to this.
Less a mountain and more of a valley with a hill on either side to climb; and only 5km.

Pussies."

UpliftingNews,ffsvuoi,t1_ffsjpo3,1580194531.0,Does the background check show what you were incarcerated for? Or is it just a blanket “criminal” label that sticks with ya?
firealarms,ffsuvgb,t3_etrut3,1580193388.0,"I hate this panel.

Such a simple and easy panel to work with. But it’s such garbage.

The bell disconnect switch timing out is absolutely awful."

KidsAreFuckingStupid,ffqbyj3,t1_ffqbdr4,1580129766.0,"Hey man; just a thought here. But you might wanna take a step back and assess your attitude.

You may be oblivious that you come across as a douchebag. And “normal” people actually don’t mind little snippets of facts & info."
NatureIsFuckingLit,ffot3dc,t1_ffnz3q6,1580081403.0,"I didn’t see a single part of that article describing the taste. That’s kinda unfortunate.

Edit: had to search through a cancerous website like buzzfeed/tmz to find a quote of sorts. 

“Fans of fruit say the Black Diamond, also known as the “scorpion fruit,” is sweeter and crisper than your standard varietal.”

And that’s still not very descriptive."
todayilearned,ffokeds,t1_ffmrai5,1580078537.0,"Honestly; when I was 10 years old, if I did some weird shit my friends and others would call me on it. It’s how you develop social skills. It’s being corrected by your peers.

On a metaphorical level, maybe its similar to how dogs and other animals nip their offspring for bad behaviour. But instead with friends.

I’m glad this kid got a scholarship because that’s just sweet for anyone. Buuuut perhaps we’re coddling this generation? I don’t condone bullying but holy shit. Taping a piece of paper to your shirt should be able to raise some eyebrows without getting the press involved."

The single deep throat is like either a K.O finishing move or a little bit of a sexy trick during. But a good BJ won’t be 100 % deep throating."
AskReddit,ffoe45m,t1_ffhnsv9,1580076693.0,That’s why I appreciate that they kind of covered this in the show friends for Monica & Rachel’s appartment. As it was Monica’s grandmothers.
AskReddit,ffoafr2,t1_ffmd6nu,1580075704.0,"Hear me out.
If you’ve got a solid wood frame bed; you can definitely use the foot end for leverage in like doggy style."
