TallGirls,ffguh8k,t3_eth8jo,1579915371.0,It still boggles my mind that men care about height so much. Soooooo dumb.
physicaltherapy,fff5zo1,t3_esjmrk,1579876580.0,There’s nothing in the OT practice act that’s delineates walking.
MakeupRehab,fff4s7t,t3_etah91,1579875690.0,"I figured cool tones would make a come back soon. Good point, buying these trendy colors means they’ll essentially be unwearable once you get over the love. Never thought of that perspective."
books,fff4i2u,t3_etasxd,1579875484.0,It’s a comfort thing. I spent my summers at the local library as a kid and I used to read in my room alone all summer. I love getting invested in the characters. It’s just fun. I do it for leisure and also to gain possible new perspectives.
braces,fff43r6,t3_etavcc,1579875181.0,"I’m
Not sure... mine were clearly impacted and I wasn’t required to get mine removed. Now one has broke me the surface but not making much progress. 

I’d ask why in very specific detail he wants this done. Or she."
MakeupRehab,ffbyn8h,t3_es3j6n,1579786919.0,It’s all such a damn scam. It’s been good for one thing though... realizing which products withstand the test of time and aren’t gimmicks.
Makeup,ffabf4p,t3_esj69g,1579731610.0,I have similar issue. My scalp hair isn’t blonde anymore but my brows and lashes and skin are see through. Just filling brows in MAKES SUCH A DIFFERENCE. Try doing that and just mascara. You’ll be surprised how much better it makes you look. I always thought I was ugly without makeup then I realize nope. Just light hair lol
bathandbodyworks,ff8zwu2,t3_esam2l,1579701256.0,I would die to have my hair smell like warm vanilla sugar
bathandbodyworks,ff8zk8i,t3_esb3hb,1579700979.0,Any time I’ve seen people return sas items they ring up the sale price and that’s the credit they receive. I’ve never done it. I should. I have too many products and would like to curate down to one scent set only as my go to.
OccupationalTherapy,ff7y9ep,t1_ff5czht,1579661219.0,"I do too. And every OTA and otr I shadowed sat the entire time unless they were going to get a patient. There’s adaptations you can do for transfers. It seemed extremely easy on the body. I shadowed a few different settings and no one was doing hard labor or lifting anything insane.
Also- I asked all my peers and received the same responses as i had fears about pack pain as well. My peers shadowed all over the country not just my area."
TallGirls,ff7x11l,t3_es4fzg,1579660375.0,If you can’t it’s tight Hamstrings typically.
braces,ff6xhtw,t1_ff6ws0m,1579636911.0,Awe that’s a bummer! My orthodontist said there’s no way to keep our teeth EXACTLY as they were right after taking braces off but it sucks regardless
braces,ff6vvv3,t3_erzr0l,1579635958.0,My jaw looks the same. Did yours change? I wear my retainer and didn’t notice a change in my face after braces
MakeupRehab,ff53zt0,t3_erp361,1579579598.0,"Welcome! 

The constant launches have killed it for us all. They need to chill... haha."
bathandbodyworks,ff4s5tl,t1_ff4ntf3,1579571146.0,That’s adorable... haha!!!
DunderMifflin,ff4rwlv,t1_ff4p248,1579570971.0,"Lol every time I read this crap I think

.....it’s a tv show......"
PanPorn,ff3rwqm,t1_ff3ftnr,1579547530.0,Gotcha! Makes way more sense haha. This is a great summer scent for sure
PanPorn,ff3fay0,t3_erf80w,1579539888.0,So I’m a perfume junkie ... I have this perfume in this size and it’s tiny. So I must ask- why two years?! Did you wear other perfumes too?
bathandbodyworks,ff3agtc,t1_ff380f9,1579537392.0,"I’ve thought that too. And no one ever believes me when I tell them this. I’ve tried right before getting into someone’s car... a friend who would tell me the truth and she’s like “nope”.  Its like what’s the point. 

It’s just how my life would work. I’m a “fumehead” so of course my scents go unnoticed. But I wear them for myself anyway."
bathandbodyworks,ff365qm,t3_er7c3o,1579534613.0,20-40x multiple times a day. I’m not kidding. And I wear perfume. People still can’t smell me. I’m just one of those people who doesn’t radiate scent. I ask people all the time if they can smell me... like my perfume. It’s quite literally always “no” unless it’s a couple of specific perfumes.
Makeup,ff31fl3,t3_erdsef,1579531133.0,I think milani did too. Not sure how their quality is though.
buffy,ff212um,t3_er75z6,1579490964.0,I’ve always wanted this
fragrance,ff0zuw0,t3_er3h46,1579473872.0,"These are my absolute fave types
Of scents so thank youuuuu"
fragrance,feywny6,t1_feys42o,1579451462.0,I think so! But you may not
