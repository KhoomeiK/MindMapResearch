Playing and constructing my own DnD campaign, which I’ll probably try to write a book or something from it. Building complex buildings in Minecraft as a fun way for me to make a portfolio for myself.

AskReddit,fe6j87h,t3_enzbdv,1578892653.0,"That I’m extremely proud that I didn’t kill myself when i had the opportunity. There was a long string of time where i felt i had nothing. I was turning into a fuck up, and i was depressed. It felt like i didnt have a purpose anymore.

What fixed me in these past couple years is sorta harping in on my sense of loyalty. Ive found good people to obtain allegiance with, they all teach me how to become a better person.

Examples being my girlfriend. My friend who is my manager, around 10 years older than me (im 20). A bunch of friends, old and new. My asshole old boss and his fantastic son, who is my new boss. My sister. Barb the gas station lady. That crazy person who terrorized the town i work in, including my job. The list goes on.

I have a need to learn from people, i see value in what they can teach me. I really only like people i perceive equally as, if not smarter/wiser than me. I would essentially be wasting my time talking to people not like me, purely in that context. 

I love learning about other cultures, even though im ignorant to what other’s are like. Im open to speaking to any type of person, but a sizable chunk of people aren’t as willing to reciprocate, mostly to my appearance I assume. Reasonably stalky long-haired kid with a red beard and tattoos are pretty taboo, so ive been told by the people of South Carolina

I give my loyalty to people who deserve it, im saying I’m proud to be secure of the fact that I trust good people, and look up to something truly greater than me. I’m gonna try my hardest to leave an impact on this world, because it would be a waste of my talent to do anything lesser. If i waste myself, i would let down my hero’s. It’s a good thing i know that’s going to be impossible."

AskReddit,fc6eklk,t3_egg3s9,1577478718.0,"I literally JUST had an insane person walk into my shop yesterday.

I was out back telling my coworker that i was going to go get some food, once i walked back inside some dude was shuffling through the papers on the front desk. I just said “Can i help you?” And the dude goes “yeah, you got a cigarette?” I said no, but he does, pointing to where my 6’4” 400 pound coworker was sitting. Dude just asks if it’s my boss and i was like “yeah sure”

He walks out there, about 30 seconds pass, and the guy walks back inside and asks where my boss is, i just say idk and the guy goes “Well, when he comes back, tell him i came for what he owes me,” and he slams his hand down on a build table, and leaves.

My coworker comes back in and asks me what he said, so i told him. My coworker says, “When he walked out here, he said he was the owner of all the buildings in the area and he demanded that i give him money for a repair. So i asked him what [actual owner of the buildings] thought about that. The guy asked who that was so i told him to get the fuck out of here.”

After that conversation, i notice on the build table that he left a dead phone and a blunt roller.

We walk outside and we see him just as he’s getting out of a truck just up the road, and he starts walking towards the main road. At that point I actually just went and followed him for a sec to see what he was doing, and he’s just walking around pulling on car doors.

After seeing that, i go into the gas station across from my shop and ask if the dude has been in there. The cashier says “Yeah!” And jesters to a pile of random drinks. “He just tried to buy all of this shit with a subway rewards card”

Once i tell them what this guy is all about, motherfucker walks into the gas station! Acts like he’s never seen me before in his life, stands next to me, and starts asking the cashier is she’s seen his Uncle Darrel or some shit like that

After she says no, he walks outside and i say “Im about to go call the sheriffs department, are you gonna be okay?” And she reminds me that she’s been working at gas stations for a really long time, she’s got this.

As im about to leave, i see a car parked directly in front of me, he’s checking the door handles on that one too.

I head back to my shop, call the sheriffs department. Turns out, as i was on the phone with them, they told me that he was being arrested. Charged with breaking and entering or something. Afterwards, a cop comes and questions me and takes the phone and blunt roller (i still have no idea where he got those) and leaves
