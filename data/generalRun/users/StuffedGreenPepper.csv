teenagers,ffepe87,t3_estyah,1579858781.0,In my school barely any teacher gives homework. There isn't really a point if they manage to teach and make students understand everything they need in class. I really don't see the point in Homework for any class other than subjects like Math.
ChineseLanguage,ffbs2di,t3_esru4x,1579780565.0,The animations are so cute!
ChineseLanguage,ffbm1xl,t3_esocnj,1579772024.0,"I didn't start only with Pinyin, but I think if I were to do that I would have a really hard time. The characters make so much more sense to me than the Pinyin, and they are what helps me learn the Pinyin. 
I always first learn how a character is written and it's meaning, and only then the Pinyin."
ChineseLanguage,ffblppl,t3_esp8a3,1579771507.0,The first one is funny looking

ChineseLanguage,ff65gn3,t3_eruqtc,1579619591.0,Wow! It's so pretty :D
facepalm,ff601vj,t1_ff4q1jc,1579615615.0,"Oh! I understand.
Your feelings are not my business, but please remember that everything you do is feminine because of you being a female. You can consider yourself as a woman if you want to, even if you don't do things that are considered feminine. As I said, being a woman is being a human with it's own world, likes, dislikes and everything that makes us special. Your gender just also happens to be female.
Anyways, I personally believe the whole 'feminine' and 'masucline' business is pretty dumb. Don't live your life by these definitions, because they don't make too much sense."
facepalm,ff3hqms,t1_ff3busq,1579541290.0,"Maybe you see the word ""woman"" as less respectful. It's legit. In the end doesn't matter really which word is used, it's the tone and how things are said. It's possible to make 'woman' and 'girl' also sound creepy."
ChineseLanguage,ff3a79t,t3_er82rw,1579537250.0,"Oh my god, my Chinese teacher showed us this video not too long ago xD"
facepalm,ff34e6h,t1_ff28seo,1579533386.0,"Exactly what I feel. Thank you for your comment, you explained it well!"
facepalm,ff33c07,t1_ff2l4lj,1579532603.0,"Agreed. With the right tone ""woman"" is a really nice word because it acknowledges my gender yet also make me seem like a human being."
facepalm,ff33347,t1_ff2ml3a,1579532418.0,"I also identify as female and it's fine to use this word. But I don't think this word can be used in the same situations as 'girl' and 'woman'. It can sound dehumanizing in my opinion.
""I'm dating a beautiful woman "", ""I'm seeing a cute girl"". 
It would sound creepy if someone would say ""I'm dating a beautiful female"", ""I'm seeing a cute female"".

The words ""girl"" and ""woman"" are refering to a human female. A human with it's own world who is also a female. Just ""female"" sounds like everything about a woman is just about her gender. Again, it depends on the situation and the tone, but personally when others use ""female"" I tend to feel uncomfortable."
facepalm,ff31s4i,t1_ff2zmie,1579531414.0,"What the fuck? These words are completely legit, and in no fucking way make anyone assume these things unless they are perverts themselves. I mean I'm also a person on Reddit, but please don't listen to whoever told you that."
ChineseLanguage,ff2bkvv,t3_er5chq,1579499757.0,"I won't say I always write the characters in the right order, but in my opinion the stroke order makes sense. The stroke order helps me remember characters amazingly better."
ChineseLanguage,fexkrpo,t3_eqsi7s,1579432584.0,Thank you! Very helpful! I always wondered what the title mark were.
ChineseLanguage,fe3irco,t1_fe2b7rs,1578849632.0,Just started watching it and I'm really enjoying it so far!
