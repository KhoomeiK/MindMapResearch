It sounds like your expectations were set by a trailer made by people unrelated to the filmmaker, who is *well known* for how grounded he is in exploration drama.

What do you like about Sir Edmund Hillary? About John Cabot? Amerigo Vespucci? Idk, but their names and stories are written down forever. I don't think it was an epic about fathers and sons. It was an epic about why men feel the need to just leave and say it's ""for science"". Pitt found that reconnecting with his father wasn't going to fix anything about him. The answers to why he felt so alone and angry weren't with his father on Neptune, they were inside him. If dad's generation had been let to feel anything similar, maybe he wouldn't be having a crisis of masculinity threatening to end the world.
