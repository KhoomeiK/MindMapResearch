AskWomen,fe5l5ij,t3_enlknn,1578870861.0,"I’ve been pretty blessed with some healthy close platonic friendships with male friends. I’m a musician and most of my contemporaries are dudes. It’s not like none of my friends ever thought I was attractive, but playing music together kinda creates a more egalitarian environment where it feels like shredding takes precedence over banging. 

I do have one friend though, 

not a musician, who I’ve had some tumultuous times with because of some unreciprocated feelings on his part. I was clear with him from the beginning that I have no interest whatsoever in dating him. I fucking love him for sure. He’s hilarious and brilliant and compassionate and caring and I hope to keep him as a friend for as long as possible, because real human connection is priceless. 

He tried for a while to cope with it, but eventually he told me he was in love with me and that if I didn’t feel the same way, he couldn’t stand to hang out with me. I was like “ok. That fucking sucks because you’re one of my best friends. Do what you have to do but this sucks.” 

Flash forward about a year and a half and he hits me up again, apologizes for being a dumbass, says he misses being my friend and it was stupid to throw that away. Hurray! So we start hanging out again, drinkin beer and recording silly voiceover for animation projects. Our friendship feels solid for a long while until, again, he presents me with the same ultimatum. He begs me this time, says that it’s not fair for me to decide it would never work between us because I’d never even given him a chance. I acquiesced. This was a mistake. He took me on one date and it was the most uncomfortable date I’ve ever been on in my life. He spent the entire time staring at the side of my face while I pretended not to be weirded out. we had sex. Gross gross gross. I’d somehow convinced myself that he was right, that I did actually owe him something. The next day I was like “alright, I’m not feeling dating you. I gave it a shot, it’s not for me. You know I’ll always be your homie and that I love the shit out of you, but I don’t want to have sex with or date you.” After that it was over again, he couldn’t handle the rejection, he showed up sobbing at my house after I told him I couldn’t meet up to talk, that I was on my way to work. He showed up just as I was pulling my car out of the driveway and driving down the street. He chased after my car melodramatically and then gave up and sat down on a curb with his head in his hands. I fucking never wanted to see my friend like that, let alone be the person he’s feeling like that over. 

So, obviously, he told me he can’t be my friend anymore a second time. I gave him approximately the same response. “This fucking sucks, but I can’t do anything to change your mind. I’ll miss you. Hit me up if you’re ever fully over me romantically and you’re ready to chill” another year or so goes by, and he hits me back up again. This time, things did seem different. We’d talked at length about what went down, how everyone was feeling, and what wasn’t ok. We had rebuilt our friendship over the course of a year that I was living in a different state. 

This New Years, I was poised to move back to where he and all the rest of my friends live. My guy friend and I had planned to be roommates when I returned, because he also needed to move out around the same time and it seemed like a decent situation. Except I was purposefully ignoring our past history, opting to believe him this time when he said he’s over it and ready to finally just be friends. Well, we were in the process of looking at houses last week when the subject of my love life came up. We’d been sharing our dating stories with each other since we’d started being friends again, so in theory, this conversation shouldn’t have been an emotionally charged one. I’ve been seeing someone new, and when i told him about it, he got really weird and judgmental and told me what I was doing was disgusting. When I was like “woah buddy, harsh words, why are you being so judgy?” He shut down and denied judging me at all, said he didn’t mean it, it’s fine, he doesn’t care who I date, and we don’t have to talk about it anymore. Fucking red flags. 

Sooooo turns out this guy I’m seeing and this friend I’m talking about have a history and it’s not pretty. My friend pulled a similar charade with this guy’s ex girlfriend a few years back. He was in love with her. She only liked him as a friend. He continued to hang out with her holding on to the hope that one day she might leave her boyfriend and love him back. That whole debacle ended when he got into a pseudo-lover’s quarrel with her at a local bar and APPARENTLY it got physical. I find all of this out through mutual friends. So yeah. Irony. He wanted this guy’s girlfriend for soooo long and she never loved him back. Then he met me, wanted me for soooo long, I never wanted him back, and now I’m fucking the same guy whose girlfriend he tried to steal in the first place. Instead of blaming himself for trying to pursue people who weren’t interested in him and/or were already in a relationship, he resents this one guy.

So I’m here in town, my car is full of my belongings, and I’m trying to figure out where I’m going to live because something tells me that if I try to be roommates with this guy right now, we’re both going to be fucking miserable."

It is higher in the morning. I know that men have generally higher levels of cortisol, the stress hormone, which is linked to their higher levels of testosterone when compared to women. There is anecdotal evidence suggesting a mild fluctuation of the male hormonal system from season to season. Whether men have a monthly hormonal cycle has been researched and the conclusion is that they don’t. So, like, maybe you should learn more about your body. 


All of your comments here have been about menstruation. I’m not sure where the disconnect is for you here. 


It is a commonly understood reality that until very recently, medical research had considered the male body the default.  women were basically thought of as smaller men with different hormones, not really acknowledging that these different hormones comprise a very very different machine. If you’re interested in learning more about gender bias in medical research, google will be happy to oblige."
