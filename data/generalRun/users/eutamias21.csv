tonightsdinner,ff6ky1g,t3_erneo2,1579629412.0,"Slow-Roasted Beef with Leeks
By Donna Hay
Serves 6â€“8

* 4 leeks, trimmed and halved lengthways
* 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
* 1 x 1.6kg (3 Â½ pounds) beef sirloin roast
* 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil, extra
* 400 ml (13 Â½ ounces) beef stock
* Sea salt and cracked black pepper
* 2 tablespoons chopped tarragon
* 2 tablespoons thyme leaves

Preheat oven to 100Â°C (212Â°F). Cover the leeks with boiling water and allow to stand for 5 minutes. Drain and pat dry. 

Place the leeks in the base of a baking tray, drizzle with the oil, and pour over the beef stock. 

Brush the beef with extra oil and generously sprinkle with salt and pepper. Heat a large non-stick frying pan over medium heat and cook the beef for 3 minutes each side or until just browned. Place the beef on top of the leeks and sprinkle with the tarragon and thyme leaves. Roast for 2 hours or until the leeks are tender and the beef is cooked to medium-rare. Remove the beef from pan, cover and keep warm.

Increase the oven temperature to 220Â°C (425Â°F) and cook the leeks for a further 10â€“15 minutes or until golden. Thinly slice the beef and serve with the leeks and pan juices."

Cooking,fefe6sd,t1_fef9nxm,1579054414.0,"1. She gets her mother significantly more than two hours a day four days a week. 

2. My husband is finishing his PhD so I am the primary breadwinner. 

3. Even if we could afford it, I wouldnâ€™t want to be home with her 24/7. I would be at my witâ€™s end and we would both be far less happy. 

4. Please explain to me how I am supposed to simultaneously work full time and personally take care of my child all day. Would you ask this of a man who works in an office? â€œWhy are you working? You should be home taking care of your baby! You think your baby is BOTHERING you by being there?â€ Itâ€™s absolutely ludicrous. I do specialized work 40 hours a week and make good money - I just happen to be in my house while I do it. There is no way I could do this and care for my baby at the same time. NO way. Should I be leaving her unattended in a childproofed pen all day while I earn money so that sheâ€™s physically at home with me (never mind being ignored) rather than in an interactive and nurturing environment with other children that she loves?"

a) Sheâ€™s at daycare Tuesday through Thursday and at home with me and my parents watching her on Mondays and Fridays, and then of course Iâ€™m with her all weekend. 
b) No. She still has no teeth and has to be hand or spoon fed and canâ€™t have heavily-spiced or salted foods. My husband and I like to take our time with dinner and enjoy our meal together without wrangling a barely-toddler at the same time. 
c) Have you ever tried to get any work done while minding a baby? Itâ€™s nearly impossible without either seriously compromising your work or the care of your child. In fact I was barely able to type this response out to you just now.
