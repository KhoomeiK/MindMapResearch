Because some artists don't just copy, they literally do almost the exact same thing and that's what I was referring to.

If a song has a terrible message it should be considered bad, imo. That's it. You can still enjoy it tho (you can't just force your music taste to change)"
changemyview,ffmun7q,t3_etu01j,1580059128.0,"I disagree, just like I disagree with ""there is no objectivity in music"".

For example, a song that appeals to the use of drugs for minors. I don't think there is any song that was particularly made with that purpose, but I that's the impact a lot of songs end up having. That's an extreme example, but what I'm trying to say is that there is a way to objectively evaluate the purpose, meaning and the impact a song has on the audience. 
Or a song that is unoriginal (copying lyrics or other musical components and trying to take credit for it)


Thats unethical (or atleast imoral) and should be considered objectively bad music, doesn't matter how many people like it."

Tyler and Josh are very good musicians. Of course they're not the best: Tyler is no fucking 300 IQ genius and Josh isn't the best drummer of all time, but their music is... Good. They have a good message, good lyrics (most of the times) and the purpose to express their emotions through music, connecting with their audience. I'm no producer, but, musically, they seem alright too. The production on older albums has some flaws but in Trench, it's better than ever. 


One thing I'd like to add: most of their songs were made to be played LIVE. Of course this isn't an excuse for you to forget about the studio versions, but have you ever watched one of their shows? Unfortunately, I haven't, only through other people's videos online, but it's full of energy and most people claim that it was the best night of their lives. 
In ""Lane Boy"", he sings: ""if it wasn't for this music I don't know how I would have fought this (...) I'm in constant confrontation with what I want and what is popping in the industry (...) My creativity's only free when I'm playing shows"".
