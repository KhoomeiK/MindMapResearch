AskReddit,ffghebp,t3_etcyd6,1579906281.0,"Paradoxically I would empower women. We as men are set to compete, we don't afford ourselves to fail, we need to provide for those delicate flowers: women.
We don't like to be challenged by women, and see them as weak. On the other hand we don't allow ourselves to develop tools to cope with frustration.
So if thing go south suicide is the extreme way to cope with failure.
If we recognise Women as equals we win a partner to share and  help us grow without this self-imposed do-or-die mentality."
