childfree,fffrslh,t1_ffdssmx,1579890400.0,"*Only* option? I'm saying there are so many options out there and maybe avoid this *one*.

As for the attitude that's completely okay, people tend to get riled up on this site especially once the downvotes hit. I don't feel like anything I've written sounds all that unreasonable (obviously, I suppose, or I wouldn't have writtne it). Because it goes against the narrative and is already highly downvoted (and people's love of sex which, I will point out again, is there specifically so that they do it more often and increase the chance of pregnancy)."
childfree,fffrdaw,t1_ffdtyo4,1579890134.0,Uh actually yeah; I would suggest that this hypothetical person avoid KFC as much as possible (whether they are already fat or not) *if* they specifically told me that they didn't want to be fat. I would similarly recommend that anybody who doesn't want to conceive a child avoids PiV as much as possible. There's plenty of lovely food out there which isn't coated in grease.
childfree,fffr8vp,t1_ffe3n7w,1579890059.0,Hey I know you don't want kids and all but just keep on eating KFC whenever you want.
childfree,fffr6jd,t1_ffe46ly,1579890020.0,I disagree with somebody on this topic then? How surprising.
childfree,fffqxii,t1_ffe7m51,1579889867.0,"Well no, the doctor gave her advice. OP clearly said that they didn't want to have children and the doctor gave a correct opinion on the only foolproof way to avoid pregnancy. The only foolproof way to lose weight is to eat healthily for sustained periods of time, I think my analogy is better."
childfree,fffqm4c,t1_ffe9q1b,1579889673.0,"Yes they can. I never said they couldn't. My reasoning for what I said was never that I didn't enjoy it either, I do enjoy PiV, just not as much as other techniques.

All I'm saying is that people should think more carefully before doing the one thing in this universe which can cause you to create a baby when they are hundreds of other things you could be trying instead which have a 0% chance to land you with a child.

And stop what? Having an opinion which differs from yours. If you change my mind then maybe, until then no way."
childfree,ffdr6m2,t1_ffdqk3v,1579826937.0,"That's fine by me; be unapologetic and, by all means as it is indeed *your* body, do whatever you want in the bedroom. I'm not suggesting a ban. All I'm saying is that PiV is dangerous if you are childfree.

I'm not 100% on board with abortion though. I'm fine with it being legal but I also think that it should be done as little as possible and preventing the pregnancy from ever happening in the first place should be a priority. For men it is completely reliant on your partner's agreement and as such misplaced trust could potentially ruin your life. Additionally it rubs many people up the wrong way. Whilst I don't necessarily agree with them I think that if we, as a society, focus more on preventing pregnancies with improved birth control (including a reduction of PiV) than promoting and normalising abortions then the pro-lifers will have no reason to be mad and the childfree people will still be without kids. It's a win-win-win (third win is for the kids who never have to be born into the timeline where Donald Trump got elected)."
childfree,ffdo9k9,t1_ffdn9q6,1579825104.0,"Is it really though? I'm not trying to disrespect you, it's a genuinely good analogy.

*Would* you suggest a fat person stuff their face with fast food rather than maybe recommend a healthier alternative?

PiV is the fast food of the sexual world and if that's where sex ends for you then I can only pity your partners (no offense intended, honestly, just saying there is a lot more to contemporary human sexuality than the one sexual activity designed to make babies)."
childfree,ffdmugv,t1_ffd1ryu,1579824245.0,"Uh, you're welcome?

You do realise that there are other ways of being intimate with your partner than putting having them put their penis (an organ developed through millions of years of evolution with the sole purpose of reproduction) into your vagina (an organ developed... you get the picture) then rubbing them around until his semen (which is designed to get you pregnant) goes into your vagina (which will then trasport it to the womb to attempt to fertilise an egg).

What's wrong with outercourse, anal, pegging, grinding or literally anything other than the one sexual act which makes babies for the other 90% of the human population of this planet of who want, or who don't actively want to prevent, it.

I said in my comment that there are other ways to do it. I was in no way suggesting that people shouldn't be intimate. I'm just saying that to avoid accidents there are a lot of other ways of giving your partner pleasure."
childfree,ffdmfdv,t1_ffdgy6l,1579823991.0,"Maybe we are? Honestly PiV is, in my opinion, the absolute least interesting and least pleasurable form of intimate activity. It's worse than cuddling. It just feels like mechanical pumping of a baby batter baster pointed directly at the womb. It *feels* like it is only for making babies. I would rather do an hour of foreplay than an hour of PiV. Or, better yet, anal!"
childfree,ffdmbx9,t1_ffd4vqe,1579823930.0,"Why not? As somebody pointed out you wouldn't tell a fat person that it's okay to eat KFC every day because it will make things worse for them. You'd recommend they eat other, healthier foods. Similarly people who don't want kids should practice other, safer, forms of sex which don't involve PiV. Tbh PiV is the worst part of sex, everything else is much better.

Please tell me why I'm wrong though, I'm all ears."
childfree,ffdm5f5,t1_ffd1856,1579823817.0,"Or, you know, eat different kinds of food which don't make you fat? Nice analogy, thanks."
AskReddit,ffdm05h,t1_ffde2d4,1579823725.0,I'm glad to hear that! Just sounded like a whole lot of work but if it's work you like then that's not necessarily a bad thing.
childfree,ffcza32,t3_esxlpo,1579810332.0,"I somewhat agree with the doctor to be honest. There are other reasons to have sex and, thankfully, other ways to do it. Unless you're sterilised, however, you should really avoid ~~it~~ PiV. Most birth control methods can and do fail.

**Edit:** As Catvros said you wouldn't tell a fat person to eat all the KFC and margerine they want. You'd tell them to eat a balanced diet with lots of fruits and vegatables."

If that wasn't reason enough I also don't particularly like the Earth, nor human society. I would prefer not to force either on anybody else."

Should be wish desperately that this awful (and completely optional) burden be inflicted upon him? Nope. Should they, as a couple, maybe come off the birth control (since it's so awful) and try some new stuff in the bedroom which doesn't involve putting a sperm baster into a baby hole? Absolutely.

Regardless not getting a vasectomy should not be construed as anything but positive if that is what the individual wishes. He has reservations and it is his scrote. There should be no discussion. He is in the right to not get a vasectomy.

A vasectomy is permanent; it is not just another contraceptive method. It is an invasive surgery and people take it far too lightly.

Anyway clearly I'm in the minority on this so I'ma just leave this sub and hopefully kill myself too."
