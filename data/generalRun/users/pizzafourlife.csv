The medium version of the more recent stuff is when the Illitch family got approval to build their new downtown arena for the Wings (and the Pistons joined later), they promised ""District Detroit"" which was supposed to be a whole series of residential, commercial and hotel buildings around the arena. This was supposed to be a huge deal for the city as that area, which is right between downtown and midtown, and was supposed to replace a rougher area, and connect downtown and midtown with a new urban center. Anyways, the arena and the Mike Illitch school of business got built, but the rest of the area is basically just surface parking. No new buildings outside of those two and two parking structures have been built. 

To add salt to the wound they got a bunch of subsidies to pay for it all and ""had to"" demolish some abandoned but savable historic buildings to make room for the new development- sites that are now parking lots. I am not certain but I seem to recall that eminent domain was used for some land acquisition, so that does not improve feelings either. It really feels like the city gave them a bunch of money to build a stadium, tear down historic buildings, and fill the area with parking lots that charge outrageous prices. Basically it feels very one-sided when we were promised to see benefits from it too"

The clear zone is the area around the freeway kept clear of obstacles as much as possible, and with things that have to be there either being designed to breakaway (most sign and light posts are weakened intentionally at the ground level so they will just snap off) and everything else surrounded by crash rails.

Sure the guy hitting the bus is an idiot, but we are literally watching a crash compilation of an intersection because that intersection is dangerous in general. 

The whole reason we have traffic safety devices, be it traffic lights, stop signs, guard rails, curve warnings, etc, is because humans fuck up, often. If everyone drove as carefully ass possible 100% of the time, we would never need any of it ever. but we do, mistakes happen.
