I do not believe that the right to vote means anything if you don’t have an independent press to nform the citizenry so they can make intelligent decisions on Election Day. Any tyrant discredits the journalists as the first step to destroy democracy.Google “a little good news” by Anne Murray. It will make you feel better.

politics,ffdxvqa,t1_ffdxdik,1579831647.0,Lol. You are so wrong. California is the strongest economy of any state in the u.s. ! That’s the fact. California is one of only a few states that pays into the government instead of pulling out money from the government. And I might add California has done this at a time that trump is creating debt at a record level. The only reason some people can’t live in california is because real estate is so desirable that many can’t afford it.

television,ffd2mxg,t1_ffd0gp7,1579812204.0,Because we must defend our democracy from a would be tyrant who abused his power and obstructed the investigation into his own abuse of power. This country matters. Some of us love this country and the ideals it represents. It’s important to uphold democracy.
television,ffd2fhc,t1_ffd19av,1579812087.0,No. It is not. Are you even watching? They are removing a president who clearly abused his power. This is going down in history as a great defense of this nation and our political process from the abuse of a would be tyrant. You can’t frame it any other way. The democrats want a trial with witnesses. The republicans want to block all witnesses. A fair trial requires witnesses to be allowed to testify. Don’t pretend like it’s not so.
television,ffd228b,t3_espyqz,1579811878.0,11 million people watching the republicans pretend like a fair trial can occur without witnesses or evidence being allowed. Fuck the republicans. They are traitors to our country. Fair trials allow witnesses. Period. There is no argument against that.
politics,ffd1n23,t1_ffckoli,1579811643.0,Doesn’t have to be a crime to be impeachable. The framers of the constitution could not foresee a president calling a foreign leader and asking for dirt on a political foe in exchange for needed military aid that the president was already legally obligated to provide. The house and the senate are supposed to be able to remove a president if he abuses his power and inviting a foreign country’s involvement in our political system and muscling that involvement by withholding military aid for a personal favor clearly fall under that scope!

teslamotors,fe4iloa,t1_fe4gfvw,1578859707.0,They were on back order for a ridiculous period of time because unlike ford there is no support for the product/ consumer after the sale. The sale experience kiosk thing is nice but then there’s no support. A ford has service departments and parts warehouses across the country. And you don’t have to hunt down used parts on eBay. You just call your local dealership. And there’s a brick and mortar building to take your ford to for Install. How are you going to get that with your eBay used door handle that comes in the mail?
teslamotors,fe3s4yp,t1_fe3lmsa,1578852342.0,For a company that hasn’t made an electric car it’s very impressive. It’s huge. The model 3 is following the model s and it’s a third of the cost of the s. So low it might be a disappointment in quality. Ford is just getting into the game and they’ve sold more than Tesla did before the model s came out. With worldwide brand recognition and superior service Tesla would be wise to ignore you and to take the competition seriously. I doubt that ford forgot that they have no batteries and they just cancel it all and go away as you are hoping.
teslamotors,fe3poli,t1_fe3lypi,1578851714.0,If you break the door handle on a tesla you have to wait like 6 months. They don’t have parts. If you break a door handle on a ford you go to your dealer. Ford has had time to think about it. They won’t make the mistakes of the volt.
teslamotors,fe3l5z0,t1_fe3jgsn,1578850263.0,"Ford doesn’t Do things without thinking them through. Especially something they are going to call a mustang. They’ve taken the orders, they’ve accepted the deposits. They’re not going to suddenly realize they don’t have batteries and call the whole thing off. You are being ridiculous. I really struck a nerve with you die hard - bury your head in the sand and ignore the future-Tesla owners. The Tesla is an ugly car and the truck is even uglier and ford is gunning for your market in a big way. Hold on to your asses cause it’s going to be a blow to your bottom line when the blue oval is in the e.v. Game."
teslamotors,fe3jpgj,t1_fe3ifqn,1578849862.0,"Because of the low sticker price, superior performance and the backing of ford motor company. Tesla has no support or service departments after the sale. Ford has brick and mortar service departments across the country and the infrastructure to erect charging stations. It’s ford. It’s a mustang. DoMy try to discount it as some fly by night shoestring operation."
teslamotors,fe3hkw7,t1_fe3gth4,1578849347.0,Well they’ve taken the orders and the customer deposits so you do t know as much as you think.
teslamotors,fe3f3ui,t1_fe38mbm,1578848743.0,"you just speak without knowing. They’ve already taken 50,000 orders. So you are wrong about the “low volume compliance car”assumption.  You’d have a better grasp on reality if you researched."
teslamotors,fe38exc,t1_fe37bx0,1578846906.0,They are already taking orders and they’ve already showed the car at auto shows. It’s happening. Don’t proclaim ford dead and the game over before the electric mustang reaches the dealer floors. It’s every bit as real as that ugly Tesla truck. Ford has tons of trucks to compete with Tesla at the price point of a Tesla. There’s the whole f series line to compete against. If yuh of war is your game; if that’s what they want to use to show towing power than they have to compete 4wd Tesla against 4wd ford. Not 4wd Tesla against 2wd ford. That’s just stupid.
teslamotors,fe34ygb,t1_fe31zye,1578845962.0,"So you want to claim the game is over before ford even gets a chance to release an electric vehicle. You’ve made your decision without even knowing or being open to experiencing the ford electric car. Because for you it doesn’t matter; Tesla’s the only electric car that will ever work. That’s fucking ridiculous. You can’t say “game over” before the car is even released, tested , or driven! And to your second point I.c.e trucks will be around for a long time. The rest of our lifetimes. You can’t do a tug of war with a two wheel drive versus a 4 wheel drive especially when the two wheel drive is lighter. Put the 4 wheel drive Tesla agains a 4 wheel drive ford of the same weight and you’ll see that test was designed for idiots."
teslamotors,fe312vi,t1_fe2yjje,1578844886.0,It hasn’t even launched yet and you’re saying to “ get over it”. That’s rich. Ford hasn’t been in the electric game yet and they’re not jumping in light. They gave it the mustang name and they know the stakes. If you want to talk about learning from history and you’re talking cars then you’re talking learning from ford. That’s how it’s always been. Look at all the firsts over the years.If history has taught anything it’s not to write off ford before their model drops. Don’t you find it odd that the Tesla truck went up against a two wheel drive f150 with the smallest power plant available instead of four wheel drive f150 or an f250 or 350 or 450? Tesla only wanted a piece of the smallest two wheel drive model. Sad!
teslamotors,fe2yb1w,t1_fe2x30u,1578844198.0,"The Mach e is not a hybrid. It’s an all electric mustang and it’s got a 300 mile range and a sticker of $45-$60,000. When it drops next year it’s going to take a big chunk of Tesla sales."

You were lying when you said that. If the republicans would stop blocking witnesses it would be any easy case to prove of abuse of power and of obstruction of Congress.

Foreigners come for the universities. They are expensive but they have the money. Most Americans can’t afford to send their kids to these universities. Look at the numbers: where does the u.s. stand in public education, in retirement age, in average days off, in numbers of people incarcerated or any other index of quality of life. We were longer with less days off than almost any other developed nation. It’s true. And we have no affordable healthcare for most. We have a lot of work to do to say we are the greatest country. Our public education sucks and our children are not prepared to compete globally. I too have traveled. I left for almost the whole decade in the 90’s and I have no plans on retiring here. Just because I made it doesn’t mean that I can’t see that our society is nowhere near the top in quality of life."
todayilearned,fd1l5qo,t1_fd1k5fl,1578132788.0,"The education is near the bottom. So is the healthcare. The average American has fewer vacations , less savings and retires later ( if at all ) than their counter parts in almost any developed country. The one thing the U.S. excels at is prisons. Largest prison system in the world with literally millions of people incarcerated. That doesn’t exactly make a country great."

Hitler was a naitionalist and a crazy racist fuck. No tie to socialism. In other news the Holocaust was real.
