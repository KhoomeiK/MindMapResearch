bulletjournal,ff76678,t3_eru3n8,1579641899.0,That's a great idea! My boyfriend just drew me a pretty funny one the other day that's just been sitting in my car. Definitely going to add it to my bullet journal
puppy101,fec57qv,t1_feaw42q,1578966830.0,"Omg this sounds exactly like my dog. When I tell him to lay down he just stares at me like I'm dumb. He refuses to roll over now and acts like he doesn't know how until I lure him into it. 

I can't  wait till adolescence is over with lol. He is the sass master and tests my patience every day."
germanshepherds,fe6apg6,t1_fe5cgds,1578885628.0,"He's pretty good at sticking by me. His recall is good around other people, but I have to put him on leash if I see another dog coming. He doesn't listen to me of another dog is around, still working on that."
puppy101,fdjhxp2,t3_elmcjn,1578471600.0,"Holy hell this thread made me feel so much better about how I'm feeling right now. I've got an un-neutered 11 month old GSD. He almost had me in tears yesterday because he wouldn't stop trying to wrestle my poor boyfriends dog in the living room (which he knows is not ok in the house), while we were all trying to relax. This was after a 4 mile hike that did nothing to phase his energy. 

Still enforcing naps to keep my sanity...his sanity is gone and hopefully will come back soon."
bulletjournal,fcza6hz,t3_ejg0r9,1578096794.0,"I LOVE THIS! I have a very active breed and feel bad if I don't get him out of the house once if not twice a day. I also struggle with both depression and anxiety.

It will probably feel so good to see this filled in at the end of the year! Hugs from me and my pup and good luck on your walk journeys."
