terracehouse,ff99kzh,t1_ff8ngze,1579707977.0,The reactions had minor r/watchpeopledieinside vibes.
YouShouldKnow,ff8oxkt,t1_ff8583e,1579689598.0,Our geography teacher recommends It a lot. Has some really good features.
YouShouldKnow,ff8h6ib,t1_ff7yfmm,1579678313.0,Just scroll into the comment section and you can either find the first comment saying It's BS or give another source and validate it.
terracehouse,ff48ce9,t1_ff3qhop,1579557747.0,You guys really need to rewatch the scene (possible without the audio) and just focus on Vivi's facial expressions. That really speaks for itself.
anime,ff1aaop,t1_feyqdl3,1579476812.0,I forgot most of the stuff of this series but what I won't forget is the clever transition from the ending of the series over to the movie. It's done just right.
terracehouse,fepz60g,t3_eqbhn6,1579335111.0,Well that's interesting. At first I thought I looked at the wrong sub.
PewdiepieSubmissions,femdx7k,t1_feln0d0,1579250501.0,Imagine dieing on the exact date.
fakehistoryporn,fe7b5ad,t1_fe7agu2,1578912358.0,That's what my impression is as a European who isn't really into politics after all these Reddit posts about him.
PewdiepieSubmissions,fe5n8fz,t1_fe5mfe4,1578871649.0,"I came on this comment because my nice geography teacher (as the only one) straight up says something along the line like ""I can already see all your eyes going down staring at your paper..."". I try the same as you even though I don't really have a problem with sacrificing myself."
PewdiepieSubmissions,fe5bygf,t1_fe4kuon,1578867480.0,Sadly there was a patch that gave some teachers the ability to see when the whole class tries to do this easy glitch.
LearnJapanese,fe1qqoq,t3_enfdl7,1578829753.0,I tried it yesterday with Spanish and It's really good but now when I disable It the subtitles have different colors and I want to remove that... does anyone know how to do it? I already tried to make the font settings back to normal but those changes don't appear there.

PewdiepieSubmissions,fdmvoya,t3_em6s80,1578567999.0,The death rate of people who consumed Oxygen is 100%. Let that sink in.
witcher,fdlebn8,t1_fdle08c,1578522194.0,Didn't the Metro author even said something against The Witcher author who should stop crying about that one deal?
PewdiepieSubmissions,fdh1kaq,t3_elc3op,1578413378.0,He is just replacing the things in his room.
PewdiepieSubmissions,fdf4rt6,t3_ekwpow,1578353294.0,"I still have 8 hours left... wait, why am I here?"
terracehouse,fdbxyf9,t1_fdbwmc0,1578263573.0,Thank you!
terracehouse,fdbnlhd,t1_fdb44a0,1578259178.0,One can actually buy something from Amazon jp even outside of Japan?
PewdiepieSubmissions,fda9na8,t3_ekculc,1578243342.0,"You know you are in the right house when you shout swear words with a kids voice in the next room and you only hear ""WhAt DiD YoU SaY tO Me yoU LitTLe-"""

NintendoSwitch,fd1pdwf,t1_fczjvhi,1578134731.0,"Can your son hear anything without hearing aids? As an example: Me and my brother have hearing aids and just take them out and put a headset on. Yes, our hearing is bad but when using a real headset you can just bump up the volume and because it is right next to the ear and isolates the outside sound It works.
I guess this is not possible for your son because he has It worse, I guess?"
NintendoSwitch,fd1nfdd,t3_ejt5wb,1578133798.0,"Taiko no Tatsujin uses it too.
The big notes feel really satisfying and HD rumble gives good feedback."
explainlikeimfive,fcxfhh5,t1_fcxeggi,1578061563.0,"Thank you for clarifying that. Like another redditorr already said, simplyifing complex things can get it totally wrong."
explainlikeimfive,fcx4vaf,t1_fcw5bsv,1578051310.0,"Thank you for sharing your knowledge. A few years ago I did a frequency test in biology class to see who can still here the high (?) frequencies. Shouldn't wonder you when I say that I was the worst. ""wHaT YoU cANt HeRE tHAt?!"""
explainlikeimfive,fcvm1kw,t1_fcvksg7,1578005001.0,Thank you for this interesting comment! I only noticed that when I go swimming (after diving for some time) that I'm suddenly able to hear a little better which makes communication with my friends easier.
explainlikeimfive,fcv4jii,t3_ej0hd1,1577994498.0,"Person who has hearing aids here. In terms of damage there is one thing that bothers me the most because nobody told me that even though It makes sense. Your hearing without them gets worse and worse which is the thing that hit me the most. I think It's because your ears are happy that they don't have to work hard and because of the extra help they don't need to make their job. (That's at least how I got told the reason)

Edit: reason is NOT true at all and was just too simplified."
PewdiepieSubmissions,fcv3in6,t3_eivoyy,1577993895.0,420 minutes here are just 69 minutes on earth.
YouShouldKnow,fcttn1m,t3_eiuejn,1577958907.0,I recommend a Password Manager too. Every (important) account has a different password with all sorts of different symbols which makes it impossible to remember for people next to you.
YouShouldKnow,fcmlqwl,t1_fcmf4mr,1577780611.0,"I can assume you traveled to 2020 some years ago , found this out and came back to tell us this? A fellow timetraveler"
terracehouse,fcawqeq,t3_egy1rm,1577578127.0,So good and accurate!
PewdiepieSubmissions,fc8w5l1,t1_fc8sss2,1577543003.0,"Sorry, mixed it up with Voodoo. They steal game ideas and make them their own and many more things.
Edit: Ketchapp seems to do the same thing."
PewdiepieSubmissions,fc8pxla,t1_fc8caqd,1577539855.0,Especially Ketchapp. Isn't this the really sketchy company?
PewdiepieSubmissions,fc8nh4x,t3_egncw6,1577538510.0,"Do you want Karma? Just post a pic with the same meaning... Yes, the message is true but the people that created the problem may use this chance to get some more of their internet points."
terracehouse,fc5rbgs,t3_ega31s,1577464209.0,I saw this meme one week ago and had the exact same thought. lol
PewdiepieSubmissions,fbz645j,t1_fbz2xvi,1577236240.0,Like everybody waits that someone other than yourself buys the door so you could be the first at the mystery box or get enough points to make the ultimate door + box flex... nostalgia kicks in.
