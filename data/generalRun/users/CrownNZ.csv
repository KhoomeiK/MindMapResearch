GetMotivated,ff4msmd,t1_ff3xkww,1579567408.0,"Yes but what if some people aspire to achieving certain goals by a certain age. In the same way noone should fault you for moving at your pace, I think the same should be said for those who want to move faster.
Why is it bad if someone who wants to be financially independent at 35 starts to worry about how they are keeping to their plan?
Yes they may well be doing we by your standards, but they measure themselves by their own standards. I personally feel happy for those who are pushing themselves harder at a younger age, and for those who waited till later. Everyone moves at their own pace, that doesn't make them crazy though."

I'd consider myself still young but there is a lot I do want to do so sometimes I get concerned by the passage of time.
Not at all trying to criticize you being an older student but if we all move along at our own rate and rhythm surely there are those who want to move faster?"

entp,fcopyb4,t3_ei8odd,1577838461.0,"I don't mean to spoil your parade but I disagree strongly.
I think our limitations can easily be corrected, especially so in this modern world where there is such ease of access to different fields and so many organizing aids. Whereas our strengths are more difficult to emulate. It leads me to believe a well developed ENTP is quite truly a force to be reckoned with.
I would argue it's much more difficult for xSTJs to adopt some of the strengths of an ENTP than for us to adopt xSTJs strengths.
Being good with money is definitely a skill we can develop and the production of further sources of income can be one of our projects.
Making plans is something there are plenty of aids in today's world. If not a simple notebook can go a long way.
Ascending the career ladder is something I think we can do well by being personable with our superiors and making ourselves available, add in a couple of Ne problem solving when necessary can make us indispensable.

I think we are quite capable as a personality type, sure others may have strengths more obviously adapted to current society, but I think we have a lot of potential that can be unlocked with a bit of appropriate moulding"

Is it okay if I ask how old you are?
Also from an ENTP perspective, honestly thank you for not talking too much. I think from my own experience, immediately following a break up if my ex would reach out.. I'd feel a deep obligation to reach out and comfort them and make them feel better. Unfortunately this never ends well long term :(. 
I hope you get through this as well as possible :) 2020 is a new year!!!"
infj,fcmkfc9,t1_fcmk89q,1577778937.0,Surely not if it is a long term relationship? Say 10 years would not warrant 5 years to be ready to move on? Or do you mean by the sense of completely get over someone?

I guess a wee bit has happened since this message, we've hung out and things seemed to be going really well so I was hopeful, and then more recently things seem to have gone the other way(she's not been messaging much at all) so I've had to come to terms with the fact it might not happen. 
I like this girl alot obviously and I think we'd make a great partnership. But I guess I'm also painfully aware that she's just super cool to talk to hahah, I'd be quite sad to lose her as a friend. Truth be told I don't think I've talked to many INFJs as I've tended to go for more extroverted girls in my ignorance hahaha. 
I Appreciate the advice, at this stage I think I'll have to give her space and see what's up when she does decide to message me again. If things start going back to the way they were I'm thinking I just let her know I like her, then take it from there. If she reciprocates then yay, if not... Then we'll see if friends can be a thing."
infj,fcjkce1,t1_fcjh53u,1577691086.0,"Thanks for the well wishes :)

I might be wrong here but in my experience, and those of my friends. Physical attraction is necessary. I definitely told myself it wasn't and had a relationship where I didn't find her physically thaat attractive, but really enjoyed our time together. Sexually it was fine, but the physical attraction I've had in my other relationships was missing and it grows unfortunately. I love(d) them regardless, but it is a thing. I know I wanted to feel all Noble and tell myself I'd be shallow to care, but the reality is that it matters, maybe not now, but eventually it will.
I also don't mean this in any offense, but to say that your crush caring about your androgenisity as shallow I think is wrong. That is to say that if she has a criteria physically that you don't match, it makes her shallow? Would this apply to other aspects of you or just the physical, I personally think everyone is allowed to find people physically attractive and not, without being shallow.

Gosh I feel like a negative nancy here but I'm only saying this because I don't want you to get hurt. I am/was in a similiar boat to you with the holding on to the hope aspect. I only worry that as long as you hold onto this hope you will shut yourself off from other opportunities to meet a different girl that you may fall in love with. Especially if you are a relatively introverted intj. I know I share(d) the same view as you but my current thought process is if she says no, then I gotta let go of those feelings, however they may be.

Now this paragraph is interesting to me, I agree with you that those signs may be construed as positive indications that she likes you. I know I want to believe them, I've had quite similiar expressions from my INFJ crush. But the sad reality is that it could easily just be friendly. Time you allocate to friends and romantic interests are different and take a different toll on you. Furthermore I don't think those activities necessarily have to mean any more than they enjoy your company, which for me is true of me and my platonic friends.
Now regarding the workload for pre-med, I myself have fortunately made it through medschool whilst maintaining a good social life and activities outside of med and relationships. But I know peers of mine who haven't, and I have seen firsthand the toll a relationship can take on many of my friends. Just because you may be able to handle the emotional stresses of a relationship doesn't necessarily mean she can. It doesn't mean she can't, but maybe if you could find out how she's feeling regarding this, you may be able to tailor solutions that work (if this is a contributor).


I also v much relate to your last paragraph.... But I'm telling you friend, there are things we can control that do affect our emotions. An easy one (for me as an ENTP) is throwing myself into a project so I'm not thinking of her 24/7 but for intj s this may be different. I'm not saying you have to move on, but it is possible, and may be worth considering, especially if nothing much happens in the near future. I don't want you waiting around 10 years for a girl that you may never get hahaha"

infj,fcjbo36,t1_fcidk0a,1577682302.0,"Hey, 
Unfortunately I've got little advice as far as dating INFJs go having not dated them yet. But from what little I've read, them making space and time for you may be good. But I also feel like (maybe from a less mbti stance) there are other aspects that have to go into a relationship?
I could be completely wrong here but my past relationships have all required a basal level of mutual attraction. 
I have female friends I'd gladly hang out with, in the same nature u have described above and would not consider anything more than a platonic relationship with them. Not because I don't enjoy spending time with them, but I just don't find them attractive. It's not that they are objectively unattractive, some of them are quite the opposite, but the physical spark* just isn't there.

I'm glad you've been confident enough to make the first moves and even go so far as to ask her if you are dating. I also have to agree with all the other comments I've read here that you need to respect her decision.
I do however worry that you may be holding out hope that she may one day reciprocate the feelings? The reality is that she just may not see you that way. Also for most of the anecdotal evidence shown in this thread, most friendships that segwayed into relationships seem to be long term friendships. If you want that I feel like you may have to give up the idea of a relationship with her and let what happens happen.

I want to tell you just wait it out, she'll fall for you. I'm probably in a similarish boat. Slightly more complicated maybe but potentially more promising. I've definitely ruminated on it and seeing as I haven't told her my feelings explicitly, I'll probably have to do something of the sort eventually. But hey if she doesn't like me and says she hasn't got the time or interest to be in a relationship now... I've accepted I'll have to move on.
I desperately want to tell you that you've still got hope, and you may well do.... But at the same time if she's explicitly said no? Surely you respect that and move on as far as more than friends go?

Another thing may be the fact that she's pre med, idk the full uni system over there but my understanding is that it's quite difficult. maybe she has decided she wants to focus on uni? That's fair enough I think?

Just becareful, I don't want you to hold onto something and get hurt, your still Young, the world is still there for the taking. You've done well thus far, just keep it up and maybe the next girl you ask out (clarify its a date earlier hahaha ;))

Also maybe ask her or probe to see why she doesn't wanna date, if it's just you, or if it's whilst she premed, or what?"
infj,fcirk7t,t1_fcio2k0,1577668133.0,"Is that not harmful to most INFJs the idea of an ultimatum..
Truth be told I don't mind just being friends, of course I'd like more... But if she doesn't wanna be in a relationship with me I'd still like to be friends.
Unfortunately she isn't a big fan of alcohol so I'm not sure how I'd get her to go out for drinks hahah, she'll have a sip but she's nevet mentioned having had more than one drink max"

I always wondered if this was an ENTP thing cos I've heard we aren't supposed to be overly practical. I found this difficult ish to relate to.
Reading the current comments maybe we aren't meant to be?
I don't know but I think I am quite practical, largely probably due to my upbringing. Dad was a major DIY guy, and I was constantly helping him around the house and other properties we owned. By the time I finished high school I had put up carports, sheds, walls, fences, painted houses, done some roofing, tiling. Even a little plumbing and electrical work (much less but enough to sort a problem in a rush).
I found my problem solving was super helpful for this kind of work and I quite enjoyed it.
Having left home however I see that I do faaaaar less nowadays than I used to and maybe it was purely due to my father's influence, but I would still say I do more than most guys my age...
Not sure how ENTP related that is, but the problem solving was super useful for DIY.
As far stuff I did with my mom? I can do a wee bit of sowing, again not much but enough to get by and probably more than most guys my age. I like to think I'm quite a good cook too, having spent alot of time in the kitchen with my parents.
I hope this helps, but I'm thinking my hands on aspect is far more to do with my upbringing than my mbti type?? I may be wrong tho"
