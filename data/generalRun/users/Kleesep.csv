Christianity,ffoh41q,t3_etulwy,1580077591.0,"2nd Corinthians 5:7 Says, ""that we live by faith and not by sight."". It is extremely difficult for man to  live by faith and not sight in fact without God it is impossible. The reason we don't live by sight is that our sight constantly changes and is also filled with negativity and sin however if we live by faith then we are living under God who cannot change James 1:17 says, ""Every good and perfect gift is from above, coming down from the Father of the heavenly lights, who does not change like shifting shadows."" Another verse about this is Numbers 23:19 "" God is not a man, that he should lie; neither the son of man, that he should repent: hath he said, and shall he not do it? or hath he spoken, and shall he not make it good?"" .  So for your situation I would suggest trying to realize that no matter what's happening ing Hod is good and he loves you so much that he sent his one and only to die for your sins and that by accepting him as your sacrifice you will be saved. These two videos should also help.

Christianity,ffjsxox,t3_etyplu,1580006080.0,God is good and all his ways are perfect even if we don't seem to understand them at times.
depression,fe5b2ft,t3_eno7v3,1578867224.0,"Now I am a Christian and what I believe is that even if you have Jesus all your problems will not go away in fact they may get tougher because you going against the world and its evil ways. However praying and asking God for his help definitely helps you with any issues that you are going. One thing as Christian that we have to remember is that in Heaven we will no longer have any sin or evil inside of us including depression. This is because Heaven is perfect and sin isn't. Now I am not saying this for you guys to just come to Jesus because you want to live a worry free life. I am saying though that in order to experience all that the Father has for you, you must confess with your mouth and believe in your heart that Jesus Christ is Lord and he will save you. You can only do this though through his strength. Once he is working in you will live your life to the best of his will that you can. All God wants to do is for you to love him with all that you are. Have an amazing day brothers and sisters. Sorry for the long rant I just wanted to show you guys the truth so that you so maybe one day you could experience it."

Christianity,fdlwica,t1_fdkpzm2,1578534182.0,"The biggest way to see if God is who he says he is, is to check whether the ressurection truly happened or not. The movie The Case for Christ is based on a true story and talks about this topic. If you are curious I would highly recommend it."

socialskills,fd3cixb,t3_ejxxzd,1578156882.0,"You are not alone brother, when it comes to caring about what other people think I definitely have struggled and I still do. The biggest and most important advice that I can give you is to REALIZE HOW MUCH YOU ARE LOVED BY GOD AND THAT ONCE YOU GRASP THAT NOTHING ELSE REALLY MATTERS. I mean let's be honest God loved man so much that he sent his one and only Son Jesus Christ to die for all the sins of humanity so that we could be in right relationship with the Father. If this isn't the biggest act of love the world has even know I don't what is. Now here comes the important part in order to experience this peace of being secured in Christs opinion of you and to experience eternal life, you must admit to God that you are a sinner and that you need his grace ALONE to was away your sins. Once you have done that you must believe that the Son Jesus was raised from the dead three days after his crucifixion which shows that he has conquered your sin problem and can help you through his strength. You must also believe that it is not by anything that you can do that saves you but it is the gift of God. There is another key aspect which is called the Trinity it is basically where God is the Father, the Son, and The Holy Spirit at the same time but are each their own individual. Confusing I know but just because we don't understand it doesn't make it false. Lastly the biggest thing you can do is to Love the Lord your God with all your being and all fall into place. God bless. 

Sorry if this was too long I just wanted to share with the Good News brother."

AskReddit,f8xh1jd,t3_e22uvo,1574918538.0,"One idea that has been on my mind for a while, is about this teenage girl named Allison Pierce who ends up gaining magical abilities from her familiar, Blitz the green spirit tiger to hunt down a spectre known as Zarath for ( I am still debating on this ) the murder of her parents. Some of the difficult parts for me is that I have been trying to find ways that Blitz could play an active role in the story, I was thinking he could be like some sort of family guardian but then he again I am not really sure he could play an important role. I also struggle a lot to find out and advance the plot. If any of you guys have any  suggestions I would greatly appreciate it."
