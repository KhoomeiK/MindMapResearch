Right now you should all live with your father full time. Your mother isn't capable of caring and supporting you.

I hope she is able to get the help she needs."

The guy with the sign is lumping everything that is not Christianity into one category of evil. (us or them) The sciences, sexuality, and witchcraft are all very different things and cover way too much territory to be just lumped together.

The sciences are evidence based, while I think witchcraft is more spiritual and is closer to a religious belief. (please correct me if I am wrong. I am willing to learn.) Sexuality is more of a primal urge and is a prime tool for controlling the population through shaming since everyone has some form of sexuality. (Between sex and original sin, we are all going to burn in hell just because we exist, unless we do exactly what the church wants. Good mind-fuck! Very well conceived and executed. Well, except for the sexual abuse perpetrated by clergy...)

This is why I choose to say witchcraft and Christianity are more similar than the other things. (I shouldn't have used the word superstition, but it is a really good word for riling up religious guys with signs, which is where my mind was at. I apologize.)

I really like your last post. Any other knowledge you might want to drop on me is welcome."
