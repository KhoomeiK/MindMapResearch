ITCareerQuestions,fff9zfh,t1_ffeoox2,1579879333.0,"Actually, yeah, we are. I will say that from what I heard the pay is on the lower end for the position."
ITCareerQuestions,ffe2ptz,t3_et26d0,1579835155.0,"If you could get onto a smaller IT team within a smaller company, that'd be nice. I work for a tech company in LA and our IT team is 3 people + their lead, supporting ~500 people but they love it."
ccna,ff8e92m,t1_ff8dc56,1579674795.0,"Thanks, just looked it up and realize it starts like Feb. 24th so I think it makes sense to wait. When do you anticipate releasing your new material?"
ccna,ff4ejl7,t3_erev5c,1579561728.0,"Sorry, as it's not related to this, but do you have a specific course that you offer that in your opinion can bring someone who has no experience to the point where they're armed with enough knowledge to pass the CCENT or the CCNA?"
GutHealth,fewncjz,t1_fewjtai,1579415617.0,"I hear you. Treatment is SO expensive. I tried chiro for a while and it helped, but only for like a few days. I'm also dealing with much more than just stomach issues though. Have you tried any specific diets to see if they'd help?"
dogswithjobs,fewh13x,t3_eqg2zd,1579410445.0,Hi Emma you beautiful sweet pup you!
GutHealth,fewgo38,t3_eqp8ex,1579410272.0,"You kind of need to be your own advocate, especially if you're going to be just seeing regular, allopathic doctors. Like you'd probably have to demand they run a specific test to check for like SIBO, or Candida, or the number of other tests for specific gut-related issues. Or try to see a Naturopath or Homeopath who will, or should have more insight into these issues."
Lyme,feffwib,t3_eosvd0,1579055473.0,"Tested initially through an ND for Lyme, but was negative. I moved down to LA and now travel down to TJ for treatment for what was diagnosed as Lyme, Bart and Mycoplasma. Did this with a dark field analysis under a microscope for about $150-200, can't remember off the top of my head. There's other options than your basic ELISA and ones you'll find through your PCP."
oddlysatisfying,fedhmkb,t3_eoj1o7,1579011745.0,Just keep looking at it.
rarepuppers,feddug5,t3_eofl6z,1579008747.0,The best of breeds.
AskReddit,fe8mm0z,t3_eo3q9l,1578927985.0,On the bus in LA. I guess it wouldn't be the most uncommon thing to see here.
ClashRoyale,fdz9bwz,t1_fdys8ds,1578787913.0,I actually like that idea!
