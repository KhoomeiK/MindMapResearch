WTF,ffdp2nw,t1_ffd6bz8,1579825607.0,"From the Wikipedia: ""Some posts on Weibo showed that hospital in Wuhan has already overloaded with thousands of people with fever and were highly critical of the reliability of the figures from the Chinese government although such posts are now deleted due to unknown reasons.[76]"" so they are at the very least hiding something."

Jokes,ffai7k5,t3_es9qzg,1579736331.0,"I've heard a version of this joke where they're just hopelessly lost, the camel is still alive, and after some similar buildup he asks her to hold the camel still for him."
lgbt,ff7ben5,t3_errhgd,1579645477.0,"Big eyebrows are back in fashion, I wish I still had mine. There's nothing wrong with a little landscaping, but you have beautiful, full eyebrows so please don't go overboard like so many (myself included a few yrs ago)."
NonBinary,ff1dpgq,t1_fezm9uu,1579477857.0,"As a white person, I'm glad to see more queer POC being out and proud, even if it's on the web. I always notice how white the queer scene is in my country compared to the general population and I've always wondered how we could make queer spaces more welcoming and actually inclusive. Not that I'm putting it on you to answer that question, I just don't think anyone should give you hate for encouraging and praising POC for representation and visibility is what I'm trying to say."
AskReddit,fergkxp,t1_fepu7pz,1579353604.0,"I saw them twice in the last few years, right before AmeriKKKant and also after. Can confirm, crowd is a huge factor. It was at a festival both times and seeing the neonazis leave after realising what type of political wasp nest they were in made the crowd go crazy the first time I saw them."
gaming,felep8l,t3_epmk42,1579220418.0,This is good. I prefer this over burnt out devs trying to slap shit together during crunchtime and day one patches anyday.
television,fed9sdy,t1_fed9hik,1579004984.0,"Like I said, there's enough info about her company out there. The science is there. The show would just be piling onto that. As for your edit, microdosing with psilocybin has only been proven to work combined with therapy given by a person trained to do so, but go off I guess. Also, they also promote 'energy healing' and vaginal steaming which is dangerous bullshit."

AskReddit,fe1wn8a,t1_fe1crsm,1578831764.0,I've read somewhere that the narcos are responsible for most snuff films on the internet to make some money on the side. It's apparently come to the point where a lot of 'fake snuff' is actually the real thing with a fake disclaimer.
mildlyinteresting,fdzc6ov,t3_en7qv0,1578788726.0,A lot of Tefal pans have a circular design in the middle in different shades of red. The lighter reds turn darker until it's uniformly red when heated.
AskReddit,fdovukm,t1_fdogbxj,1578614044.0,I went to see Garbage a while back and I loved it. I'm 26 so I basically grew up listening to them.

lgbt,fdiinen,t3_elavhf,1578443767.0,Same goes for survivors of childhood abuse in any form btw. Being both is a whole can of worms in and of itself in my experience.
explainlikeimfive,fdii516,t1_fdi2u9m,1578443440.0,"There's a well known joke in my native language/dialect that usually gets shortened to its punchline that's very similar to this. It's about powder that keeps elephants away. Someone asks 'but there are no elephants around?'. The punchline that gets used as shorthand for the whole joke is 'goe poeier eh', which means as much as 'good powder, isn't it'. It's so popular it gets used out of context a lot (even to indicate a drink or joint is strong or that something is simply good, from food to stuff like duct tape,...). I think it's originally by a comedian named Urbanus."

AskReddit,fcyz0kw,t1_fcyu688,1578090222.0,"I'm sorry this happened to you. It was my worst fear for years and I'm so grateful my family believes and supports me, and cast out my abuser. This stranger on the internet believes you. I hope you've found support in others around you. Chosen family can be amazing as well. I wish you well, may you find yourself making progress towards healing."
