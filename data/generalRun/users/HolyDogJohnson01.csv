Concepts of race are a fucking joke. A lie embraced to justify political views, and bigotry. But a lot of places like that reenforce the ideas in order to maintain a level of exclusivity. It’s really an immature reaction to power. The shit bullies do to the nerds. I went to an inner city school briefly. It was in the fiber of that place. Cruelty for the power, and the approval of your peers.
