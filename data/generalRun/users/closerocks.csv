But not all hope is lost. I suspect that a lot of you are also combining intermittent fasting with the lower carb veganism. That may be why people are reporting positive results. The Keto vegan diet seems like it would reduce the magnitude and duration of a glucose spike from a meal.

If you're serious about changing diet for health reasons, you need to measure more. I highly recommend using some form of continuous glucose monitor like the freestyle libre to see just how much you spike after your carbohydrate intake. I discovered that if I increase my metformin from 1000 mg a day to 1500, my numbers became much more reasonable at the cost of increased fatigue.

The reason I say get a dog is because it will take you outside of yourself. The dog is completely dependent on you and most importantly, it won't get tired of you if you are intensely connected to it. You can be fulfilled by the affection of the dog and need people less which gives you a chance to be with people without being clingy.

So get a dog, take up some serious competitive activity with the dogs such as obedience training, tracking, agility and gives you a chance to interact with people the casual in a casual way not based in relationships."

They put me in an observation room, stuffed me full of, nitroglycerin and heparin. I think they also gave me beta-blockers as well. As I said I confounded the doctors because EKG look normal, ejection fraction was normal and it took hours for the troponin level to rise. It rose for about six hours and then went back down.

>I completely understand being tentative after an experience like that. Did you ever end up doing a stress EKG?

Not when I was in the hospital. My new cardiologist gave me a stress EKG this fall and I was having some burning in the chest when my heart rate hit about 130 something. My cardiologist thinks it may be a partial or small clog that isn't in need of immediate attention. I'm probably in serious denial but I attributed it to a lack of conditioning. So far, exercising is not causing me any problems but I do try to keep my heart rate between 110 and 130 during my workout session. 

What I don't get is that I can walk really fast in the flats, heart rates had a good range but the moment I hit a hill, my heart rate shoots up and I run out of air. I'm hoping it's conditioning but it's been a problem at some level my entire life.

My memory of the event is a bit foggy but I was presenting symptoms but the EKG didn't show any indicators of a heart attack and the troponins didn't show up for 6 hours.

boston,ffd9np9,t1_ffcxgcu,1579816155.0,"There are multiple factors as to why rents are rising. Increasing demand is one of them. ""Because they can"" is another factor. The cost of moving is so high plus the trapping effect of leases keep people renting the same place and just swallowing the increase.

https://ggwash.org/view/68318/why-is-that-house-or-storefront-vacant

This article has a really good discussion of why landlords will keep property empty. To your point about a landlord not making money if a property is vacant, there are two reasons for that. 

First is when all factors are considered if the landlord cannot cover expenses and profit, not renting loses less money than renting.

Second, you can't charge enough rent to be worth getting rid of a bad tenant. Boston real estate appreciates 6% a year so why take on the hassle of renting when your investment makes you 6% without doing anything. 

While everybody should have access to safe, clean, affordable housing, the ugly reality is nobody owes you a place to live and all the demands for affordable housing mean squat unless you personally are contributing to the funding of that housing. Would you pay twice as much rent if you knew that extra money was going to building new affordable housing?"
veganketo,ffc84lv,t1_ff7vic6,1579793721.0,"I was talking to my doctors about the problems I was having and he said that the studies that show the benefits of any diet are population-based studies.

The other factor is that we are really crap measuring important factors when it comes to diet. Every person starting the whole plant vegan diet should get a continuous glucose monitor at day one. Until you measure those glucose curves, you have no idea how the body is dealing with a high carbohydrate diet.

At the very least, people should get an A1c test every month and see if the average climes or falls.

yup, it is expensive at $362 per square foot.  Labor costs were in the ballpark of $100 an hour and is listed as a significant driver of costs.

I wondered why it was so expensive and this article turned up https://www.cityandstateny.com/articles/opinion/commentary/unions-costs-so-much-build-anything-new-york-city.html which indicates that union labor is expensive because they have a huge pension fund problem. The pension fund problem is driven in no small part by medical costs and the current population age inversion curve (more older people than younger people).

Yet somehow, nowhere in my research did tax burdens and permitting fees come up as a cost driver. For example, when I looked into Chicago construction costs, (https://workwithfocus.com/news/chicago-construction-costs/ ) again labor is the dominant factor. A second significant factor is tariff driven cost increases in materials.

There are a couple of possible fallacies. First, it's more likely that the old housing will be taken off the market, refurbished, and put back in at a new higher price. I know this is what I would do if I owned rental properties. 

The second fallacy is that people have the money to buy into more expensive housing. If housing is not affordable and people are stretched to the limits where they are, how can they afford to move to something more expensive?

The only way to bring prices down is if there is a property developer willing to take a loss on building housing. By taking a loss, I mean renting apartments at a rate where they may not recoup development costs for 20 or 30 years. The only entity that can do that is a government"

As a bit of back story, back last September I went to whole plant-based diet on the instructions of my cardiologist. There have been some benefits but one of the negatives was my A1c one from 6.0 to 6.9 and four months. I also didn't lose any weight and in fact I think I've gained a few pounds even though I'm eating less than I did before.

I wear a glucose monitor known as freestyle Libra which gives me very nice insights into blood sugar curves around meals. What I found was on the vegan diet, I was spiking in the 250 to 300 range. This explains my fatigue and generally feeling unwell. It also explains weight gain. Why? When the body has an excess of glucose, it converts it to triglycerides and then to adipose fat. This indicates that it may be diabetes that makes you fat. This will be a hardship for many people to make since the myth that fat makes you diabetic is so entrenched.

Since the beginning of January, I cut back from an low fat all plant diet to one that has peanut butter or avocado daily, some cheese a couple days a week, and fish about once a week.

There are surprisingly few differences between riding a motorcycle and an e-bike. From my perspective, the biggest difference is you don't need to use a clutch and the mass of the vehicle although with some of the smaller motorcycles, there may not be much of a difference there either. I haven't ridden a e-scooter yet but when I found a kick scooter big enough for my size 15 feet, I had all the expected counter steering and braking issues you'd expect from a single track vehicle. 

The course would need to train and start to build muscle memory for things like proper braking technique and counter steering. Then there is the whole thing about training people to not focus on the bike and the road in front of them but on everything around them, cars, pedestrians, and other single track vehicles.

you're right that the scooter companies would fight it but then again lots of companies have fought regulations for food and drug safety, safety features in cars, pollution controls and other things that benefit the general population.

I don't think the licensing scheme would necessarily kill off the micro mobility because look how many people have car driver licenses. It's really not that hard.

I did not change my meal timing. I typically eat when I'm hungry can be anything from eating breakfast right away till four or five in the afternoon. Then eating dinner somewhere around 8 PM to midnight. Not exactly the best dietary practices. On the PBD I tried to eat more regularly but I had to stop eating during the day because every time I got a glucose spike I would pass out and lose two or three hours out of my day

With regards to the curves, I posted them as an example of the kind of data that people need to collect if they are diabetic. I would love to run an experiment where PBD people of all types of health used a freestyle Libra to measure glucose response to their diet. I suspect what we would see is that everyone experiences the same kind of spike as I do just that some have a faster response and a lower baseline."
PlantBasedDiet,fcyhajq,t1_fcygsvy,1578080122.0,"The research paper describes using the Mediterranean diet was certain now parameters compared to the traditional six meal uniform distribution of calories dietary restriction for diabetics. 

In my case, I am currently comparing eating whole plant high carb versus fasting. When I start eating again, I am going to follow a more Mediterranean-style diet and measure the glucose curves from that"
PlantBasedDiet,fcyfc6h,t1_fcyavwi,1578079215.0,"Tell me about it. On a low-carb diet I was still rocking triglycerides between 700 and 900. After a few months on praulent, I was able to get my cholesterol to a normal range and triglycerides down to where the doctors were not panicking.

From what I can tell, high triglycerides in response to a whole plant diet is possibly a precursor to type II diabetes. If I remember what my doctor said correctly, as glucose builds up in the body, the liver converted to triglycerides as a way of storing the excess glucose. 

At this point, I'm convinced my body is all forked up and I should set it back to the OEM for a refurb."
PlantBasedDiet,fcyeg9z,t1_fcxs8eo,1578078915.0,"videos are all well and good but you really need to have solid studies to back up the assertions. I also replied to the same poster you did with some snapshots of graphs from BG measurements over time. It shows how my diabetic control degraded over the past four months.

I have a copy of *Reduction in Glycated Hemoglobin and Daily Insulin Dose Alongside Circadian Clock Upregulation in Patients With Type 2 Diabetes Consuming a Three-Meal Diet: A Randomized Clinical Trial*

This paper makes the case that eating Mediterranean diet style with mild intermittent fasting (10/14), calorie load profile of  700 cal at breakfast, 600 cal at lunch, and 200 cal at dinner with a macronutrient composition of 35:25:40% for fat, protein and carbohydrates has a significant benefit for type II diabetics in terms of weight loss and A1c reduction. I need to read the paper closer to see what they say about BG ranges in response to food but it's promising.

I am going to try this kind of a diet for a while with fish and dairy and see if my BG response gets better. It may be that part of the protocol for moving to a whole plant diet for diabetics and get the full benefit would be a transition through a Mediterranean-style diet according to the protocol outlined in the paper."
PlantBasedDiet,fcyc9fw,t1_fcxfyfa,1578077918.0,"To truly understand how a plant-based eye affects your glucose levels, you need to use a continuous glucose monitor such as the Freestyle Libra. The initial investment is something like $150 US or so depending on your insurance rules.

Once you start tracking data you see some interesting things. here are two sample charts.  the first is around the time I started PBD. [http://cubeupload.com/im/closerocks/bgcurves20190908.png](http://cubeupload.com/im/closerocks/bgcurves20190908.png)  as you can see, the baseline is low and stable. the spike is a PBD meal.   [http://cubeupload.com/im/closerocks/bgcurves20200103.png](http://cubeupload.com/im/closerocks/bgcurves20200103.png) is the last few days.

12-31 is the current unstable bg plus an evening of being yielding to nye temptation.

01-10 is a recovery day. eating light (50ish gr carbs/meal)fasting after breakfast(10:30 am) till dinner (8 pm)

01-02 is a fast day trying to burn off glucose . 8 pm spike is about 70 carbs meal.

01-03 is another fast day and bg numbers are not dropping. conjecture is over time the body becomes accustomed to higher glucose levels and the liver will do a glucose dump to maintain those levels. Part of the treatment of diabetes is to lower the average glucose level so the body will stop trying to maintain it."
PlantBasedDiet,fcxu3kc,t3_ejfull,1578070510.0,"Based on available research that I've seen, a plant-based diet is beneficial to most people. There is a question in my mind whether or not it's better than the Mediterranean diet which keeps coming out on top in terms of results.

Based on personal experience and published research, a low-fat plant-based diet has significant benefits for cardiac patients. 

I'm starting to question however the benefit to type II diabetics. Yes there is some research showing that it will benefit type II diabetics. However, in my experience, it took four months of a plant-based diet to degrade my diabetic control to where I was 15 years ago (A1c 6.0 rising to 6.9, fasting blood sugar 100 rising to 140). 

The other argument against the plant-based, especially when used for medical reasons, is that the knowledge is thin on the ground. Yes there are books and there are for fee services so you can talk to someone by phone or email but nothing replaces someone you can see face-to-face and coverage by insurance. 

I'm lucky that my primary care is vegan by culture so he understands my desire to be on the plant-based diet for reasons of health etc. He has been very supportive and is trying to help me find an endocrinologist that can help untangle a puzzle of diabetics on whole plant diets. 

It is appalling though that in the Boston area, I was only able to find a cardiologist that practiced plant-based medicine. The nearest place was a Dean Ornish center in Providence which would require me to live there for six weeks and go through their cardiac rehab program at a cost of some God knows how many thousands of dollars.

In the meantime, I'm backing away from all plants to mostly plants. I need to add back in some caloric source that won't boost my blood sugar that means dairy and/or fish. I've been on this vegan diet long enough that the thought of eating meat makes me a little bit queasy but eating food and then passing out from a rapid rise in blood sugar is not good either. 

If it wasn't for the support I've gotten here in this group and all the useful information, I would be back on a low-carb diet and enjoying my brisket from blue-ribbon barbecue."
PlantBasedDiet,fcvc4am,t1_fcv9rnn,1577998992.0,"1 head of cauliflower is 29 grams of carbs. 150 cals. Adding 250 Cal's to get to a 400 Cal meal at 0 carbs means 30 grams of fats.

What about protein?  I need about 5 gram of protein per meal. Quinoa supplies 4.4 grams of protein per 100 grams of quinoa. Almost a good match. 100 grams of quinoa is 23 grams of carbohydrates. Subtracting that from the cauliflower carbohydrates effectively removes cauliflower from the meal. 100 grams of quinoa is also 120 calories which means I need to add more oil or fats to make up the calorie difference. 

Sometimes I think balancing fats, carbs, protein is not unlike the rocket equation. There are no good solutions especially if you need to control two macronutrients."
PlantBasedDiet,fcut8ku,t3_eiuwai,1577988039.0,"29.8. Annoyingly, weight hasn't budged in the past 4 months even though I've been very careful to be low fat most of the time. I suspect the high blood sugar levels have kept me from losing weight and may have added some as the body tries to store the excess energy.

Low-fat and low-carb? I guess I need to become a watertarian."
PlantBasedDiet,fcuauja,t1_fcua30o,1577976673.0,"My fridge is a crappy fridge and unfortunately apartment is small and the refrigerator is a small one (10 ft.³) supplied by the landlord who is ""economical"".

Great advice on handling produce and thank you for reminding me that I love alfalfa sprouts. They are really easy to grow and when you do it yourself, you're not at risk to the various forms of commercial contamination that took alfalfa sprouts off the market. In the wintertime it's also really nice to see something green and growing. 

You have given me a joyful mission for the day. Find alfalfa seeds!"
PlantBasedDiet,fcua4cl,t1_fcu8jir,1577976164.0,"Apologies but I have a pedantic correction. The word diabetes literally means sweet passes through (mid 16th century: via Latin from Greek, literally ‘siphon’, from diabainein ‘go through’; mellitus is from Latin mellitus ‘sweet’.) In other words sugar in the urine which is one of the symptoms of disorder. When you increase insulin resistance, you are increasing the level of glucose in the system.

Although this being Reddit, I'm sure someone will come up with a pedantic correction to my pedantic correction."
PlantBasedDiet,fcu4dd3,t1_fctr3g8,1577972254.0,"Yeah 300 is bad. Rule of thumb has been to eat only as much carbs as will raise your blood sugar by 50 mg/dl per meal.  For me, 300 is a rise of 200 or 4 times that. The why it's bad is that nerve damage starts to happen around 140 mg/dl. 

after I had a heart attack, the cardiologist told me that I had to cut out the low carb diet because more people die from cardiac disease than diabetes. My retort was yes diabetics die one amputation at a time. 

Let me be clear that I am grateful for the help people have given me here and I am following up on a lot of the recommendations. I believe that the research shows that this time it will bring my diabetes under better control without medication but I'm frustrated it's been 4 months and not doing any better."
veganketo,fctnkuz,t1_fctmvvh,1577950315.0,"great pointers. Thank you. I'm going to have to take a look at the pea protein. The only experience I had with pea based processed food was pea juice which also gave me a migraine. I'll have to look again to see what's in it that might have cause that problem. Fortunately the other plant-based juices don't seem to cause me a problem almond, cashew, oat juices, are all fine."
PlantBasedDiet,fctl6k5,t1_f1doh76,1577947350.0,"nope,, no down votes here. you are polite and informative. disagreeing with a post is no reason for a down vote.

A couple of questions. How do you keep leafy greens or any vegetable for that matter fresh in your fridge? Boston lettuce last about three days, green leaf lettuce last about two. Red leaf lettuce lasts about 12 hours before decaying into something that smells like algae on a hot summer day. Don't get me started on kale and eggplant. (If that doesn't get down votes… ;-)

Seriously, I cannot keep fresh vegetables edible for more than a day or two and I'm going every couple of days to the store and it is eating almost an hour of my day just to get a days worth of food. My freezer is tiny and I have to be very selective about what kind of food I put in there."
