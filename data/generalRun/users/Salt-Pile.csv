1) No they don't, they just think they do. It's common for Whanagrei to be on about 12 degrees and complaining bitterly about the cold while Wellington is feeling all happy it's on 6 not 4. Whangarei has a warmer overall climate and no real wind.

2) Yes

3) Yes

4) Whangarei has a casual, small town feeling, whereas Wellington feels like a miniature city where everyone knows each other. 

As well as the drop in population size, you would be moving from one of the wealthiest provinces in New Zealand to one of the very poorest (so, much lower GDP per capita, lower education levels, underfunded DHB, highest methamphetamine use in NZ etc), and the social scene really does reflect that."
SeriousConversation,ff1ycoh,t3_er5foq,1579489005.0,"I can see the argument for it but I don't think it's fair to children.

I would much rather we put our energy into demanding resources for the development of better birth control options for men (there is basically no funding for this from big pharma) rather than on demanding for the legislation of a right to abandon children."

It's bad enough having all our parents sick and dying and the financial arrangements around being ""sandwich generation"" (sandwiched between caring for elderly and for kids) without having to pay for healthcare on top of that. I can't even imagine."
AskEurope,ff1vz5o,t1_feyv1dr,1579487418.0,">don't understand why the US gets singled out

OP asked the Europeans about the US specifically, that's why it is being ""singled out"" in everyone's answers. I think the reason the US surprises people in this regard is that it's a western nation, just as their own nations are.

If you look at my link, most of it is about viewing habits. Too lazy to find it now but I'm pretty sure pornhub found that the more conservative US states consume more porn than their less conservative compatriots, as well. YMMV though."

But there are a few others that aren't and *should* be. Longfin eel for example are as rare/threatened as brown kiwi. 

It's weird, as a culture we are okay about at least wanting to give our land native species a fair go, but anything in the water we will devastate to extinction."

AskReddit,ff1uo27,t1_fez6kq5,1579486582.0,">The problem was they were never taught how to check for sources for creditablity, so they believed just about everything they saw all the same.

This is true of our societies as a whole. The internet contains powerful resources, just like universities contained libraries, but knowing how to access and use them effectively is crucial.

I grew up with an older family member who always demanded to know *how* I knew what I knew, always made me think about the reliability of sources. The internet didn't phase her - if I said it was on the internet she would say ""ok, who put it there""? Used to drive me crazy but I really appreciate it now."
AskReddit,ff1ubr7,t1_fexup4i,1579486362.0,"I think the *potential* to effectively question much more is there, sure. There was always the ability to look up and challenge information but it took more of the form of a ""note to self"" and hit up the library. 

Looking it up in a meaningful way is easier now, but it still takes a bit of diligence and knowing what you are looking for, some critical thinking and analytical skills.

Nothing worse than an Anti-vaxxer pulling out their phone to ""prove"" their stupid backward beliefs.

I have a kind of weird perspective because I'm right at the end of gen X - the so called ""xennials - analogue childhood, digital adulthood""). 

For my generation, we had to know *how* our computers worked to build them and keep them running, and we were on the net back when it was the wild west. We watched as idiots fell for Bonsai Kitten and were there when early Wikipedia was full of shit."
AskReddit,ff1trbu,t1_fezehsz,1579485994.0,"It depends on the people I guess. in my experience boomers are a bit less likely to annoyingly wikipedia something and then drone on about it like they know it than Millennials and Gen z, but everyone does it.

The *difference* for me is once we get into an actual sphere of knowledge eg if you're an actual engineer, etc. At that point you need to actually cognitively know and understand what you are talking about. And I don't think any particular generation has a corner on that one- it comes down to what you were taught but also how good you were at learning and applying.

Over-reliance on tech leads to shit like the [Walkie Scorchie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTBm9LwzIAw). Anyone with a basic grasp of physics could have told them what a curved mirror can do."

So this overvaluing the young is kind of a delusion."
