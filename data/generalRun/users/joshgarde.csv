westworld,fgjfnoi,t3_eymypf,1580843044.0,"Even with pure randomized noise, humans will eventually begin to start noticing patterns that don't actually exist. I'm not saying the showrunners didn't intentionally add in references to other works of literature and media. I'm sure with a team of writers this talented, someone's gonna slip in a subtle nod here and there, but you may be looking a bit too closely

security,fgdi9z5,t3_exrieu,1580682764.0,I just want to know wtf the reverse-address bot was trying to do. Who would setup a bot and not realize they're trying to access the reversed addresses after years of operating it? Did they just not debug any of their code before deployment or is it an intentional form of attack?

techsupportmacgyver,fg5cm88,t1_fg4r6i8,1580523949.0,"It's a pretty short distance so there's not a lot of interference that can mess with the signals. Also, typically good jumper wires are made with copper or a copper- coating so there should be a minimal amount of resistance for how far that signal has to go"

security,fg3z9eq,t1_fg3c1fr,1580492836.0,"Ik that MacOS creates folders specifically for Spotlight search on any flash drive you plug in. Windows does a roughly similar thing for other optimizations (thumbnails come to mind). The only OS ik that doesn't modify the filesystem on plug-in would be most Linux distros though I'm sure there's edge cases. So at the very least you'll be able to know a rough idea of what OS your drive was plugged into, but if all the victims' PCs run the same OS, then you wouldn't be able to get anything further"
security,fg39wqr,t3_ewmfjr,1580475648.0,"You might be able to build a custom USB device that determines OS information based on the handshake process of various device IDs (keyboards, ethernet adapters, displays, audio interfaces, etc), but you'll be dealing with a lot of low level protocol stuff and you'll need to build up a database of how each OS deals with certain device IDS which will probably vary from config to config. Idk how reliable you'd be able to make it and it'd probably take a solid year or two of dev work, but definitely seems plausible"
