Albuquerque,ffjulz0,t1_ffj4cp4,1580007385.0,">lot of us who live in the city proper or county dislike rio ranchoians

I was referring to the part where most people in Albuquerque hate people from Rio Rancho.  Was it edited?

I don't live in RR, I live on the Westside (northwest).  While the commute can suck, there are up sides like not having to worry about auto theft or property crime.  To be completely honest,  I wouldn't care to live in a good portion of Albuquerque, and I was born here and lived most of my life here.  Maybe it's just me getting older, but I can live without the 'city vibe' of drug addicts, loud noise, property crime, auto theft, etc.

For instance.   I accidentally left my garage door open all night with the lights on several times (it was malfunctioning before I got it replaced).  I had an expensive mountain bike in the garage, lots of tools, and a door that opened directly into my house.   Nothing was ever stolen.  I would not expect to be so lucky in other parts of Albuquerque.  In all my years here the only time I've had someone try to break into my car (or any property crime for that matter) was when I was parked in the Southeast part of town. 

The one thing I will concede is the lack of restaurant diversity.   There have been some really good hole in the wall family owned restaurants that went under, and some that seem like they are failing simply because it's just the wrong location while chains and 'American' food restaurants seem to be doing just fine."
