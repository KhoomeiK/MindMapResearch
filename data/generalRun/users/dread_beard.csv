Watchexchange,ffjksvl,t3_etzonr,1580000508.0,"Really only wore this about 4 times. It's a super nice watch. Dial and case are both made in US and the movement is a Swiss workhorse - Selilita SW210. These sell for $1080 new. Comes with 2 NATO straps as well. These are not super cheap - the Orange was included with the watch and I bought the Blue. The blue was $42 and is a super nice ADPT strap. Vero sells them [here](https://vero-watch.com/collections/accessories/products/adpt-nato) (where I bought them).

Comes with outer box, inner box, papers, tags, and the balance of the Vero warranty. Warranty card is pictured and included.

$615 shipped via F&F or +3% for PayPal standard (with references). I can share feedback here, on WUS, or on eBay if requested.

US only at that price. Will ship to Canada but buyer pays shipping.

Ugh."
nottheonion,ffdqzx4,t1_ffdnprr,1579826819.0,"The aftermarket replacements just don’t work for GTOs. It’s unfortunately a problem with the design on the key fob. 

Most fail after a week or two."
nottheonion,ffd9ey7,t1_ffd8qjo,1579816011.0,"That's bizarre since I know multiple attorneys with M3s, Porches, and a few with Ferraris. The ones that aren't into sports cars generally have very nice SUVs (Range Rovers, BMWs, etc.). And I do generally assume that I know more attorneys. 

All of them have beater vehicles they bring to a court case in front of a jury. The only ones I know who are overly flashy at court are divorce attorneys."
nottheonion,ffd7oet,t1_ffd4p8s,1579815019.0,"I'm not talking about knowing an attorney and what they drive. I am referring to seeing an attorney pull into the court in a certain car. This is absolutely taken into account. I am actually an attorney and I have actually seen this first-hand. 

My old firm very much understood this and young associates like myself were told to not drive flashy cars to any court appearance. 

You served on a jury once, somewhere. I don't think you're speaking from much experience, man."
Watches,ffd0qjp,t1_ffcflfh,1579811138.0,"Grand Seiko bracelets aren’t worth the price, IMO. I’d keep it on leather or see if Toppers, Timeless, or someone has a lugs-matching leather or fabric strap. 

Just my POV."

It’s so easy to fall in love with this watch from the way it looks to how it feels on wrist."
nottheonion,ffcu82j,t1_ffctgzd,1579807359.0,"Yep. I could sell it now for a bit more than what I paid for it + the costs of the mods. It looks to have ended up a decent purchase! 

Zero plans to sell it, too. Too much fun."
Watchexchange,ffctr3d,t1_ffc4hum,1579807085.0,"Yep, unfortunately (for the OP), it can be found for around $4,500 BNIB with warranty. His price isn't unreasonable at all (I would likely ask the same . . .), but that's the main reason it hasn't sold."
nottheonion,ffctco4,t1_ffcpnxs,1579806851.0,"Me, too! And the value retention on them is absurd. I'm debating buying a Limited or a TRD Off Road Premium. If I do the Limited, I'd do a front fascia swap with an Off Road front and ditch the 20"" wheels for 17s with KO2s on them."
nottheonion,ffct99l,t1_ffce6xq,1579806797.0,"Depends!

With the Saturn? Parts are still available. Remember, it is the twin of the Traverse and Acadia.

With my 2004 GTO? Yeah, that baby is expensive. They just discontinued the key fobs so I had to get a Holden version from Australia. But the car has a ton of money poured into it as it was a race car (actually bought it from my dad who was looking to move on from it). I've put in about $6,000 to turn it back into a very high level grand tourer, so it's a ton of fun now. But yes - potential for buckets of money."
nottheonion,ffct2wv,t1_ffcc7f4,1579806693.0,"Pretty much. I really don't drive. My summer car is a 2004 GTO with only 34,000 miles on it . . ."
nottheonion,ffct1qq,t1_ffcdrdl,1579806675.0,Wow. That's a lot of driving.
nottheonion,ffct16f,t1_ffccvy9,1579806666.0,"I'm in the private sector, now. The Plastic Fantastic is just a nice, cheap, relatively harmless SUV for getting to and from work."

So my buddy and I were going to carpool in the Durango. Had to end up renting a Suburban for the drive. Much nicer in a newer car, but really pissed me off.

I quit that firm a few months later and had to tow the Durango back due to the brakes."
nottheonion,ffcsvri,t1_ffc7mmr,1579806579.0,I miss mine. Had her on KO2s and just had a blast with her in the winter.

nottheonion,ffcst0z,t1_ffc8rj4,1579806535.0,"That's a good point. When I was practicing and engaging with clients regularly, I got all kinds of questions about cars and never did someone say ""Boy, you must get paid too much."" or something of that sort."
nottheonion,ffcsozx,t1_ffcdz55,1579806469.0,"I moved onto the private sector so mine is now purely steady.

Prior it could be big bursts. 

I still have the salary + bonus model, but it's more predictable. I generally know my bonus about 6-8 months out."
nottheonion,ffcsmi1,t1_ffcjrye,1579806427.0,"My summer car is a highly worked 2004 GTO (and I've gone through a 2014 Jeep SRT, 2009 Cadillac CTS-V, 2013 Mustang GT with a blower, etc. over the last 8 years). 

So the ""side car"" is still nice. But even there I moved off the payment. I don't drive a ton at all, so I'd prefer to put my fun money into watches and stuff like that."

LOL :)"

Replaced them with stainless lines."
