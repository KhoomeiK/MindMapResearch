He’s got popeye from what I can tell, and some naturally large eyes compared to the average betta

Went into adopting him with the understanding he’s not going to be the healthiest fish in this universe, being the lunar flare type

tumblr,fgng1tj,t1_fgnfgcs,1580944102.0,"Yeah, in med school, depending on where you go, some of you patients will be asking for gender affirming surgeries

I hadn’t seen him jump before and since my other bettas who have lives in that type tank before haven’t had issues I guess I never thought abt it too hard
