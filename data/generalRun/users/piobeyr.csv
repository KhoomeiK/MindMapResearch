Take time to let your body AND your mind heal. Feel all your feelings, don't push them down. When you are ready, get back on routes that you have read and are suitably low-risk for you. For me, it helps to evaluate the safety and risks of a given climb and assess as objectively as I can to decide if those are tolerable risks for me or not.

If you are interested in exercise (which for me keeps my mental health in check, I know it isn't that way for everyone), you could check out your local rec center. Mine has recumbent bikes and seated ellipticals that I can use. Swimming is not really my jam, but it is low-impact and better-tolerated for many people.

I learned in [mental health first aid training](https://www.mentalhealthfirstaid.org/) that the number one thing to do when you are concerned about a friend's depression or when someone brings up suicide in conversation is to directly ask, ""Are you considering suicide?"" If the answer to that is ""yes,"" then ask, ""Do you have a plan?"" If the answer to both those questions is ""yes,"" it is an emergency and should be treated as such; the person should not be left alone.

It is really scary to ask that question directly because we may be afraid of the answer. ASK. 

OP, I'm so sorry for your loss. As others have said, your friend probably trusted you quite a lot. Many people experiencing depression are really, really good at hiding its depth. Don't blame yourself.

ETA: Nothing you say in this context will ""convince"" someone to go through with suicide. They may have already made up their mind (as is likely with OP's friend), but asking about it isn't going to hurt them and may help. Asking if they are considering suicide doesn't put the thought in their head.
