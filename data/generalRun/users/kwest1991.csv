fatlogic,fdiaj0e,t3_elj0ps,1578438696.0,"Has anyone watched Secret Eaters? Theres some episodes on YouTube and on 4od if you're in the UK but they follow people who say they cant lose weight and ask them to keep a food diary at the same time. They always say they're eating ""1500"" cals for example but the hidden cameras show them eating loads."
LuLaNo,fdgtnye,t3_el4fk1,1578408043.0,Beware people - I watched one of these parody videos last week that was posted on here and now Youtube thinks i love LulaRoe and keeps recommending them to me! Watch them signed out.
ABoringDystopia,fddpqad,t1_fddl416,1578320642.0,"I've tried to find the origin of this cartoon and I don't think it is from the 30s - from what I gather it's a Soviet cartoon about America from 1953 called ""priorities"" and this is the original  [https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DYnqlu6WsAAZFtG.jpg:large](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DYnqlu6WsAAZFtG.jpg:large)   Don't know how genuine that info is though?"
fatlogic,fddnq9j,t1_fddbjbj,1578318908.0,I've seen a version of this chart before - I don't get it though. Have fat activists made this scale? and are people happy with being called infinifat or death fat?
fatlogic,fdc2nao,t3_ekgr6e,1578265888.0,What about fat people who work out? Where do sumo wrestlers fall in this?
fatlogic,fcu94dm,t3_egt3uo,1577975491.0,"I am sort of tall (not that tall - i'm 5'11)  but sometimes I have found it difficult in chairs on planes, buses, trains etc. because of lack of leg room. I can't imagine being so big that you make sitting in a chair difficult and voluntarily keeping yourself that way! It's baffling."
fatlogic,fcqksuz,t1_fcoxlmj,1577887757.0,I've seen a lot of these posts say racism - does anyone know why??
fatlogic,fc3o5wd,t1_fc1e76r,1577394422.0,"Response 2 is infuriating. Fat people aren't in the same category as tall and disabled people
You have absolutely no choice in being tall or disabled!"
