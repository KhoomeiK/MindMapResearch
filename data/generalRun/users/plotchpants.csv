dogs,fev9c81,t1_fepvtln,1579394681.0,"Do me a favor, and don't get a dog, dog."
dogs,fepcxl1,t1_fep2tfz,1579317446.0,Do you mind me asking what daycare you work for? Is it a local small business? I have been looking for something like that for years now.
dogs,fep1l8j,t1_feoznfe,1579310095.0,"If the owners were even remotely attentive then I would have no problem, and if it came out that they are working on training then I would be fully supportive because that's great. None of the above-described situations featured owners who were trying to curb any bad behaviors. They just watched, ignored, and sometimes even laughed."
dogs,feodzhd,t1_feocrtn,1579298792.0,"I figured it was the same everywhere. We were never big dog park people because our dog is just super into fetch and all we ever needed was our own backyard. But now that we are in an apartment we obviously don't have the yard and so the dog park is a necessary evil. It's funny because you read about how dog parks are crucial for socialization of a young dog, but after my experiences there's no way in hell I'd take a puppy to a dog park"
CFB,fenkh6n,t1_feneb2t,1579286620.0,Haven't had an elite RB since he took over the job from Cale Gundy. It's really not hard to piece it together. I would just thank your lucky stars he's being hired to a coach a different position.
CFB,fenkapm,t1_feng6p6,1579286514.0,Do you know where I could find more info about this? I'm curious.
unpopularopinion,feh8689,t3_ep2slk,1579111144.0,"Yikes. So many ego-centric assholes. Humans are complex, and emotions are complicated, and people handle heavy emotions differently. You have zero reason to believe the man is karma farming or seeking ""internet points."" Maybe, JUST MAYBE, the man is seeking comfort. Just because you cannot imagine finding comfort from strangers, that doesn't mean it's impossible for a different person to find comfort there. Spewing toxic rhetoric about a man who is grieving his dying spouse, and then DIRECTING OTHER PEOPLE TO THE POST, is what's sickening. Good lord, pull your head out of your ass.


Your opinion isn't unpopular, I think a lot of people are uncomfortable with 'over-sharing.' But your post here is just mean-spirited, disingenuous, and tacky. Quit trying to gatekeep the grieving process."
confidentlyincorrect,fe2pkfp,t1_fe1emsw,1578841510.0,"maybe so, but for those 4 1/2 hours we were kings."
IsThereAWordForThat,fdm9zly,t3_em24p7,1578543540.0,It doesn't seem like you even understand what introvert means based upon this context
horror,fcki2pe,t1_fckcs67,1577725808.0,Thatâ€™s how Pennywise is described in the books in its clown form though.
