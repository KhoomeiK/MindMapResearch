ShitMomGroupsSay,ffjvttw,t1_ffjvkmd,1580008341.0,That’s so horrible :( I can’t imagine having to live with someone that didn’t treat me like a human being.
BabyBumps,ffjsozw,t1_ffd00uz,1580005897.0,People just love to tell people with vaginas what they’re supposed to do with them. It doesn’t seem to matter the context at all.
BabyBumps,ffjsfuy,t1_ffdjd36,1580005701.0,"That’s so stupid of them! I am 100% going to use whatever drug they recommend for me, but people have been giving birth for millions of years without them and why shouldn’t you have the right to do it that way if you want to or believe it is best for you? Birth decisions should ultimately be in the mother’s hands. We should be educated about all of our options, but at the end of the day, we are the patient and should be in control of what is done to our bodies."
BabyBumps,ffjs68g,t1_ffd4hsi,1580005493.0,That’s brilliant
BabyBumps,ffjrvy1,t1_ffd2p6u,1580005277.0,"Does that mean she also thinks adoptive parents aren’t real parents? Or that people who give birth and breastfeed and then go on to abuse their children, lose them to the court, and wind up in jail for it *are* real parents? What an awful person, I’m glad you don’t have to deal with that person anymore!"
BabyBumps,ffjrhfa,t1_ffd2k14,1580005005.0,"Thank you for saying this!! The idea of a major, invasive operation is terrifying and should never be treated like the “easy way out.” Imagine if we told people getting open heart surgery, ACL repair, or a liver transplant that they are taking the easy way out! A c-section is an amazing medical development that has saved millions of lives, but it’s still a major procedure with risks and possible complications and I think people need to be more respectful of that. 

Pregnancy is a sacrifice, no matter how that baby ends up outside of you. Even if you aren’t the one to birth that baby, becoming it’s parent is a huge sacrifice on top of that. People who shame parents for c-sections just seem insecure to me, as if they need to put someone else down to feel better about themselves."
BabyBumps,ffjr00e,t3_etlyth,1580004686.0,"I don’t have any advice that hasn’t already been said, but I just wanted to pipe in that you’re not alone! Everyone in my circle who is currently or was recently pregnant with their first has had some hiccups along the way with their SO. It’s super hard for the non-pregnant partner to fully understand how incredibly difficult this is for us as the pregnant partner. My friends whose children are now born have all said that their SO is much more supportive and on the same page as them in terms of what’s important. 

I do think it’s important that we all remember that even though we are all pregnant and hormonal, our feelings are valid, reasonable, and not to be written off as being purely due to pregnancy. Even if you “over” react to something, others (especially SOs) need to be respectful of how significant these feelings can be."
BabyBumps,ffjqg0n,t1_ffgfpob,1580004317.0,“We’ll figure it out” has been my motto this whole time!  Everything seems to work out okay eventually so I’m not even worrying about a crib until he’s too big for a bassinet. We’ll also have a pack n play for travel and that seems sufficient for now.
BabyBumps,ffjpy9m,t1_ffhy9ws,1580003993.0,"I’m the same!! My mom is the strongest advocate I know, whereas my husband is more likely to avoid conflict out of fear of being disrespectful or making a scene. She also lives an hour away, and may have her license restricted due to a possible recent seizure (she has epilepsy) so I’m very worried about making sure she is able to be there! I would rather give birth in a dirt barn with only my mom there than be at the hospital without her :("
BabyBumps,ffjplw9,t1_ffh9jha,1580003770.0,"My husband is wonderful and supportive, but if I had to choose between him and my mom being present for the delivery, I think I’d choose my mom! There’s something really comforting about her being the person to give birth to me, you know?"
agedlikemilk,ffjpfsq,t1_ffjp7b4,1580003651.0,"At least in the United States, it’s free for most people under insurance, including Medicare and Medicaid. And if you don’t have insurance or Medicare/Medicaid, there are places that will still give it at low cost or free if needed!"
BabyBumps,ffjoug3,t3_etrif5,1580003252.0,"Yes! 100mg nightly, and I’ve been told I could even be on a higher dose if needed. My little guy is developing perfectly, and both of my doctors have said stress and depression are more harmful than the medication. I’ve been on this medication for 5 years and have had a diagnosis of major depressive disorder for 10. 

For me, I know that the chances of me slipping into self-harm or suicidal ideation are pretty high without my medication. I’d rather my baby be exposed to the medicine than to have him die because I do, you know? At the end of the day, it’s not considered to be harmful to fetuses, and for me it was the right choice to continue taking it as I have been. But your pregnancy is up to you, and if you feel more comfortable going without the medication, you have every right to make that choice."
BabyBumps,ffjo6zi,t3_etu6ga,1580002811.0,And it’s never enough to feel like the trip back to the bathroom was worth it!! My little guy keeps jumping on my bladder when I lay down and it’s driving me nuts.
agedlikemilk,ffjo04d,t1_ffjnr81,1580002677.0,"Oh believe me, I’m laughing. Chill out, and get your flu shot. That’s really the only point I care for you to take away from this tantrum you’re having."
agedlikemilk,ffjn6ms,t1_ffjn3ef,1580002126.0,"Lol, okay. Get your flu shot."
agedlikemilk,ffjmm1k,t1_ffjmjig,1580001740.0,"You’re honestly not worth the time. It’s reddit, not a fucking dissertation."
agedlikemilk,ffjlvjg,t1_ffjl5va,1580001245.0,"Lmao, the flu shot doesn’t protect against just one. It’s specifically formulated to be the best possible protection against the most likely common strains present for the season. You’re acting like it doesn’t help at all. I never said it was 100% effective- nothing is. But it’s the best opportunity you have to prevent the flu, it’s usually free, and if you don’t get it when you’re physically able, I’m sorry, but you’re a selfish idiot."
agedlikemilk,ffjbgra,t1_ffjbalh,1579994797.0,"It’s not too late for it to be effective! The flu sees a second surge in the spring time IIRC, and no matter when you get the shot you are helping to protect infants and other vulnerable people. Most places are still offering it for the season, especially with people freaking out about the coronavirus."
Instagramreality,ffjbbnf,t1_ffjaq0c,1579994712.0,"Same!!! The worst I’ve done to myself is over-frying the ends when I was in college, but I know if I tried to bleach my whole head (almost black hair that doesn’t lighten well), I would either end up with patchy orange or I would be bald. I leave it to the professionals now haha"
agedlikemilk,ffjb6hj,t1_ffj8zqa,1579994626.0,"That is correct, but it’s much more simplistic to call it a vaccine rather than try to explain that to someone who already doesn’t get their shots. It’s not a random guess, and it does a damn good job of protecting a person from contracting the flu. Everyone should get it annually."
agedlikemilk,ffj67e3,t1_ffj5kgf,1579991418.0,"You’re speculating wildly. Also, every virus mutates. That’s the reason we have to create a new flu vaccine every year. Scientists have been reporting that the virus is less life-threatening than the flu, and frankly I trust them over someone speculating with no reliable support for their claims."
Instagramreality,ffj5504,t1_ffitzko,1579990648.0,"I think it’s good to make sure people are aware of the risks of bleaching on their own without a professional, though. Some people are really good at doing it themselves, but some people end up accidentally burning their hair and head really badly. So I think the comment was more of a fair warning to everyone else against trying it yourself without doing a lot of research first."
ShitMomGroupsSay,ffj4nho,t1_ffiqlgw,1579990289.0,What I don’t understand is how that’s even supposed to be appealing? My husband would be really sad if I said yes to sex even if I didn’t feel like it. It wouldn’t be fun if he felt like he was using me.
agedlikemilk,ffj4ckb,t1_ffj3z1o,1579990067.0,"The vaccine does not completely prevent the illness. But it reduces the chances of you getting it, and if everyone has their vaccine, you are naturally more protected due to the collective herd immunity. And a doctor who dies of the flu would have told you the exact same thing. Nothing is 100%. But not getting your shots is like not wearing your seatbelt just because once in a rare occasion, someone dies due to their seatbelt rather than being saved by it."
agedlikemilk,ffj475f,t1_ffj2722,1579989958.0,"Honestly, more people have died from the flu this year than from coronavirus. The flu is incredibly dangerous, especially to the vulnerable (immunocompromised people, infants, young kids, the elderly, pregnant people) and is a known killer every year in even the most developed nations (over 6600 in the USA this season alone). The flu is what people should be worrying about preventing if they’re going to freak out about a disease."
agedlikemilk,ffj3ysc,t1_ffivn7k,1579989788.0,"Plus, the flu has been and will continue to be present and highly contagious every single year. It kills 300,000-650,000 people worldwide annually. And we have a vaccine for it. People who freak out about coronavirus but don’t get a flu shot when they are able are ignorant. 

My mom is immunocompromised. She gets her flu shot every year but is still more susceptible than most people due to her disease. You know what she’s worried about? The flu. Not the coronavirus, not Ebola, but the flu. Because people with the currently sensationalized illness are less likely to go out and about, spreading their sick to everyone else. And yet people send their children to school with the flu, and one of those kids could kill my mom. 

I fucking hate healthy people who don’t get their shots.

Edit: Thanks, I’m aware that the flu mutates. The shot changes each year to best prevent the common strains. Why do you think you have to get the shot every year, unlike most other vaccines? Justify it however you want, but if you use that as an excuse to not do your part in supporting herd immunity, you’re selfish and being an idiot."
agedlikemilk,ffj3k5s,t1_ffj1ixx,1579989496.0,"I’m certain it will still have a less significant impact than the flu. People love to sensationalize “new” viruses, but ignore the fact that a simple vaccine can protect them from something that kills hundreds of thousands of people every single year."
facepalm,ffitmen,t1_ffi3khd,1579982410.0,"Yeah, mangos, kiwi, papaya and other tropical ones seem to make my mouth and stomach hurt the most!"
TalesFromRetail,ffititc,t1_ffhoteo,1579982340.0,"I have very little sympathy for able-bodied young people who don’t know how to get directions to where they are going. Even if you don’t have a smart phone, it’s pretty easy to plan ahead. The elderly get a pass for me if they’re polite because they’re usually used to asking for directions and don’t always know how to look online. Why do people have to be so rude???"
IdiotsNearlyDying,ffhj5l8,t1_ffg0u1v,1579937629.0,"FWIW, the Corona virus has killed less than 100 people worldwide, while the flu has killed 6600 people in the USA this season alone. I wouldn’t panic about this virus, but I would encourage everyone to get their flu vaccine!"
ChoosingBeggars,ffhiyur,t1_ffgzf14,1579937381.0,"Yeah, at the end of the day, OP did a nice thing for someone who is clearly struggling with their stability, and OP should feel good about that."
facepalm,ffhiptm,t1_ffhince,1579937050.0,"Just be careful! For me, the reaction started to get worse every time I ate them, to where now just a little bit of almond, pecan, or walnut makes me super sick."
