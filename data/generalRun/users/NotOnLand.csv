FemaleDatingStrategy,fc128ck,t3_efg3cj,1577306167.0,"I've known two separate groups of friends in 3-way couples calling themselves ""open"" or ""poly"" and both crashed and ended horribly. One was two men and a woman, which eventually devolved into a mostly normal relationship and one sad cuckold. The other was a bi man, a trans man, and a bi girl who was both the oldest and least mature. The men took care of her like their daughter with benefits and fought endlessly behind her back. Eventually some other friends helped her out of the mess and she's doing well and they're still a wreck.

You can't have a solid, committed relationship split between two people, one will always get the shit end of the stick."
