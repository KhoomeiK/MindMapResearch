AskReddit,ffvq2ba,t1_ffu1x2m,1580270123.0,"I can confirm, I worked for a fire sprinkler company for several years. The thing is the ""nasty shit"" part doesn't take years, it's in there from the day the system is pressurized for the first time. Much of the cast iron needs to be cut on site which requires a shit ton of cutting oil for just not cutting but threading as well, then it is connected with buckets of pipe dope. Only *then* does it sit in hot high ceilings and attics and ferment into something that looks like very used motor oil mixed half and half with antifreeze. Installing the stuff new was hot and dirty work but reworking older systems was worse.

>They don't all go off by pulling a fire alarm, they're individually heat activated.

 As with everything this is mostly accurate but there are rare exceptions that most people will never encounter. First, pulling the fire alarm won't set off sprinklers, nor will heating one sprinkler head cause all of them to go off. The usual purpose of the fire alarm is to tell people to get the hell out. In some very rare locations like where there is a lot of very expensive computer or telecommunications equipment pulling a fire alarm will start a timer countdown to evacuate before a halon gas dump happens. In this case though you won't see a standard pull down fire alarm; It's usually a huge red button covered with a larger hard plastic cover and a warning sign that says (and I paraphrase:) ""Don't fucking touch this. Don't fiddle or adjust the cover. If you ignore this and do accidentally set the system off we recommend you ignore the evacuation time and sit your ass in a chair because you will never work another day *anywhere* in your life."" I don't know if they use halon systems anymore, it's been a few years since I worked fire protection. I'm sure Reddit will correct me though.

I only ever saw one application where one sprinkler head triggering caused all to activate but that was a deluge system. Think of a situation where one head triggers but you have a hangar full of billion dollar aircraft. You might be willing to get a few airplanes wet rather than risk the chance of a fire spreading."

AskReddit,ffb19yh,t1_ffaqszt,1579749303.0,"Kmart always had a theft problem. I worked part time at a Kmart in the late 70's when I was in high school, in Canada no less and the amount of shoplifting was horrendous. This was before cameras so enforcement usually fell to one or two ""undercovers"" that would pretend to shop or they would hide in storage closets that overlooked the store. Of course the ""professional"" thieves knew this; when you see the same faces in the same store every day you visit it is pretty obvious, especially when it is 10 below outside and you are being tailed by someone that isn't even wearing a winter coat.

It was bad enough to drive an assistant manager nuts. It was hilarious (but probably not for the poor guy.) He got on the loudspeaker and announced to the store something like *"" Attention Kmart shoplifters! I want to thank you for choosing Kmart for all your five fingered discount needs!

>The forum, which is often criticized for being out of touch with the real world...

Actually some of those timelines aren't really unreasonable. I don't know if getting rid of the internal combustion engine by 2030 can be done in terms of long distance transport (I'm thinking of trucking, freight trains and overseas vessels) but battery technology has been growing incredibly fast. Who knows what 10 more years of development may bring. There are already electric aircraft and trucks being tested.

Solar, wind and wave power is already providing cleaner power all over the place. It just has to be ramped up. Will coal or natural gas use be finished by 2030? Personally I doubt it.

Unfortunately none of this is going to happen though unless it becomes profitable to the politicians and the megacompanies that control them. Until a bucketful of sunshine becomes more valuable than a barrel of oil. Then we will see Texaco change it's name to the ""Texas Solar Power Co."""

todayilearned,fepf6t6,t1_fep75iz,1579318986.0,"OK, I just moved a year ago from KS so I know a little about it. First it varies from county to county (and there are still many dry counties) but at my time of departure from Sedgwick County (Wichita) here were the rules: Supermarkets could sell ""near-beer"" being 3.3% or less. For ""real beer"" you had to go to a ""Liquor Store."" Now that store could you sell you beer, wine or spirits...and absolutely nothing else. No mixers, no snacks or cigarettes, they could not legally even have ice inside of the structure. They generally had a cooler outside the premise where you paid for ice and then grabbed it on your way out.

When I was leaving I think there was a plan to let supermarkets sell  real beer and even liquor at the supermarkets but the liquor stores wanted then the right to sell other products but I don't know the outcome of that. I'm back in CA where I can buy beer, cigarettes and lottery tickets in one place."

For those not from Toronto here's what I recall: The DVP is mostly in a valley following the drunken path of of the Don River, hence the name. The Don River (more like a stream now) is an ancient river so it winds to and fro...and so does the parkway beside it. There are very few straight sections. IIRC it is usually 3 lanes in both directions except in summer. As the comedian Jeff Foxworthy once said: ""Toronto truly is a city of four seasons. Autumn, winter, spring and construction."" I don't know whether it is just because of all the curves but the lanes seem to be 2 feet narrower than anywhere else. To add to this most of the exits are such that the exit deceleration lane (where you are exiting the roadway and slowing for the ramp) is also the *acceleration* lane for traffic wanting to get on the parkway. All this in what seems to be 45 feet. On those rare times traffic is moving at speed  this is akin to landing an F/A 18 on the deck of the Nimitz...while having another F/A 18 launching right behind you."

DIY,fd6gf33,t1_fd660jy,1578190607.0,"Gas fireplace technician here. You didn't ask for my opinion but this is Reddit dammit so here are my thoughts:

I was truly frightened for your safety when I saw a combustible mantle that close to the fireplace. Glad to hear that you have retired the old beast otherwise your next fire could be much larger than you anticipated. Personally I would have used metal studs clad in non-combustible wallboard like Hardyboard.

That said, don't expect much heat from an electric insert unless you plan on running a dedicated 220V line to it. Even on a dedicated 120V circuit the best you can get is about 1700 watts of heat. That's less than two hair dryers.

Best choice (but unfortunately by far the most expensive) is a gas insert. If the existing chimney and flue are intact that is the route I would pick if it were my house. I'd still ""fireproof"" that mantle though. Gas inserts *generally* have lower clearances for non-combustible mantles and *most* inserts have blowers that can really push out heat.
