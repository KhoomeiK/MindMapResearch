Documentaries,fe9pw01,t1_fe90w95,1578940378.0,"Actually let's use statistics.

According to the Asia Centre for Human Rights the highest discrepancies in male births to female are, in descending order, Lichtenstein, China, Armenia and India.

So let's follow the assumption of ACHR that these are signs of infanticide or foeticide/selective abortion.

Then we look at the census of Punjab to get the birth rates of females as opposed to males across the three main religions.

The rates in 2001 were:

Muslim: 793 females to 1000 males
Sikh: 897 females to 1000 males
Hindu: 846 females to 1000 males

In 1931 Sikhs had the highest proportion of estimated female infanticide out of the three main religions of Punjab, now they have the lowest.

So what you are saying was correct (in Punjab) up until around 1951 but not anymore."
