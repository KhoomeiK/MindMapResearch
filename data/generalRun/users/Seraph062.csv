It's not really the ""fire"" that is different, it's the fact that there is a bunch of electricity involved too. So they require you to use an extinguishing method that isn't going to react badly to electricity.  
Water (Type 'A' extinguishers) is dangerous to use on electricity, you can get electrocuted while actually putting out the fire, the water can cause the electricity to reach other points of ignition, and if you put the fire out you now have a bunch of potentially energized water to worry about. There are special ""water mist"" extinguishers that can be used because they avoid the issues with water 'spreading' the electricity.  
Foam are usually just foamy water, so similar issues apply. There are foams that are designed/tested to resist electricity so they'll be fine for electricity.

This is not true. Glass fibers can be much, much stronger than blocks of glass. This is due to the way crack propagation works in glasses. In simple terms: Glass fails in tension due to flaws, which act as stress concentration / crack initiation points. If you have one 'large' flaw in a block of glass then that flaw determines when your block fails. If you have one large flaw in a bundle of fibers then that flaw determines when a fiber will fail but then the other fibers are fine (just carrying a little higher load).  
  
Somewhat related to this: There is a fairly common demo where you take some glass rods, dip some in HF (which dissolves glass) and then put them under tension until they break. The rods subjected to the acid will support a higher load, despite the fact that they are thinner, because the acid will help smooth out the flaws in the surface of the glass.

This is backwards. Glass is generally has higher compression strength than it has tensile strength."

In the simplest (ELI5) terms: velocity is relative but acceleration is not.  
  
Something ""Rotating around us in a right weird and [non-]uniform way"" would require objects to be under weird and non-uniform acceleration. Since acceleration is not relative, we could detect that acceleration if it existed.  
  
Two: The ""usefulness"" of a theory as a model. The current theory lets us correctly predict a lot of useful things.

This was actually a fairly famous experiment by a 17th century scientist - Jan Baptist van Helmont. He grew a willow tree, carefully measured the soil and water he used to grow it, and figured out at the end that the tree was like 200lbs heavier than he started with, but the mass of the soil was basically unchanged."

No. It might have been provoked, but it wasn't first.

Neither.

This was combined with the fact that the biosphere soil contained a lot of extra organic matter. So microbes would use oxygen to break the soil organics down and make CO2, then the CO2 would react with the concrete sequestering that oxygen away."
askscience,fc5k5x8,t1_fc5eata,1577459793.0,"> As this article describes, given the current rate of depletion, experts believe we could run out of accessible helium in 25 years or so.

That article is pretty out of date (I was actually able to guess the year it was written before opening it based on your description of it).  
  
Thanks to the free market the helium shortage is more or less a solved problem in the short-medium term. Basically ""accessible"" in terms of geologic gas means ""is easy enough to extract that people can make money doing it"". As the price of helium started to go up helium that had previously not been ""accessible"" started to become worth capturing, and suddenly people were actually willing to spend money to capture the stuff from natural gas.  
Qatar open a helium plant in 2013, are in the middle of building another one (which may be open? It was expected top open in 2019 but was hitting delays) and is talking about building another one. Russia is building a plant in Amur that is expected to come online in 2021."

7.9 km/s would be enough to ""cancel"" gravitational acceleration, but how would that make you ""Fly off into space""? It would seem to me that it's going to simply put you into a (nearly) circular orbit around the earth.  
If you want to ""fly off into space"" you'd need to enter a parabolic or hyperbolic trajectory. A quick back-of-the-envelope calculation suggests that this would require a velocity of a little over 11000 m/s, which means you'd be looking at a about 1 rotation per hour."
