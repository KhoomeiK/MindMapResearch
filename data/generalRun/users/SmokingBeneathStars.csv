depression,fgtm4hg,t1_fgthj7x,1581106403.0,Well said. Another point is showing empathy to your employee will calm your other employees. They'll be less stressed knowing their backs are covered which in turn allows them to perform better without any real changes basically.

askseddit,fg7cv0j,t3_ex8vr3,1580589447.0,"You can do a few things. There's a master post on either seduction or seddit about shit tests, I don't know how to find it on mobile but imma give you what I remember from it.

1) exaggerate. You could say something like ""yes indeed I'm boring this girl once fell asleep on me talking""

2) completely ignore it and change the subject. ""So anyways ..."" works great.

3) I forgot the third to be honest but I remember there were 3. Perhaps it was change the frame or something like that but I'm not sure. You could say something like ""I may be boring but my pokemon card collection is worth more than your future""

4) Wasn't on that list but here's one that works and some girls go wild for, throw something back at her. She's mocking you so mock her back. Roast her ass. A lot of guys always try be so nice to girls that they get bored of it. The example in 3 fits here as well.

EDIT: [This is the post in talking about, there are actually 4 concepts, I thought only 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/9kfl5t/the_ultimate_guide_to_passing_shit_tests_this/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share)"

askseddit,fftyfkg,t1_fftxf42,1580230494.0,Not OP but I think they mean you'll feel too committed to one person which may lead to you being very needy to this one person because you have no other options open that calm your mind.

Besides it's subjective anyway. A ""strong"" person will feel the same amount of pressure with a lot of problems than a ""weak"" person with small problems. What matters is how much pressure is on someone mentally."
