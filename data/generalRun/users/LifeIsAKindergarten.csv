13ReasonsWhy,femnazy,t3_elk5lg,1579263515.0,"The love Clay has for Hannah is a good ""first love"".  


That means he has all of these emotions, but he doesn't really know how to love.  


For instance, he pretty much puts Hannah on a pedestal. To him, she is perfect in every way, and he expects her to live up to that expectation. It's normal for first loves to be that way. He's in love with the idea more than the actual person. In love with being in love. I've been there, and so has most people I know, especially early in life.  


When he finds out Hannah had other relationships other than him, he actually wondered whether Hannah was worth loving at all. Because she didn't live up to his expectation of her. But life doesn't work that way, and Clay doesn't have the life experience to teach him that.  


He might be in love with her, and she might be in love with him, but to be honest, if they had had a relationship I don't think it would have ever lasted for long. Hannah wouldn't be able to live up to Clay's image of her in his head. Clay wouldn't accept that, and at some point that would have split them up.

She was not exactly a reliable narrator, and Bryce's lawyers would have focused on her bullying in her other school, and probably the ""slut"" rumors about her.  


I don't think reporting it would have made a difference. Jessica didn't want to admit to her being raped in season 1, so she probably wouldn't have supported Hannah's case in S1, especially since their friendship went sour.

The end of the relationship was not at all his fault. I just realised we weren't at all compatible, and I didn't see a future with him.  


I agreed to meet up with him, and we had coffee. All he wanted to do was remember. He kept asking me ""Do you still have that dress you wore for New Year's?"" and stuff all the time.

To be polite about it, he's not very good at understanding things. Maybe I'm just bad at explaining them to him, but he's very... I'm not going to say ""simple"", but he has a hard time understanding more abstract things, so explaining things to him was always hard.

For instance. I am horribly messy. We're talking clothes and stuff lying around everywhere, not cleaning regularly, only doing dishes once a week etc.  


Obviously, I'm not like that when in a relationship, but when single, no matter how long I was in a relationship, I fall right back into it.

I love going out and dancing, doing karaoke etc, especially on my own because I don't have to worry about what the other people want, I can run around and talk to whoever I like, and I can leave whenever I like.

AskReddit,fe5m7oc,t3_enu4le,1578871244.0,"It's a lot less boring and lonely than living alone and having no job.  


Having a job means getting out into the world, since you have a reason to. You talk to others, get to do some work etc.  


Then when you get home you're tired so the TV and food is good to do, and it doesn't feel boring at all."
AskReddit,fe5ky4u,t3_entre1,1578870760.0,"I allow myself to feel them. Eventually they change, dull, or go away. Obviously, I'll do this without it affecting others.  


Say I'm absolutely furious. Smoke coming out of my ears and all I want to do is punch the person I'm angry at, or say something hurtful.  


I tell them I need a minute, and then I take a walk. Listen to some angry music, talk angrily to myself etc. At some point I cool off enough to go back and talk it out.  


  
Say I'm so sad all I want to do is cry. I'll get my tissuebox, put on a sad movie and I'll be one big mess of snot and tears until I'm all cried out.

You do you, I do me, and as long as you're not breaking any laws all is cool."
AskReddit,fe5iskm,t1_fe5iln8,1578870004.0,I'm completely chilled. But calling strangers on the internet necrophiles doesn't usually generate laughs. I didn't say that to be rude or to attack you.

Reading a good story doesn't mean you have to imagine yourself in that story. I like the story.

I wouldn't know if you're a psycho. But the attempt at a joke you made wasn't very funny."
AskReddit,fe5g4g1,t1_fe5exdt,1578869049.0,"No, I did not feel alone in the world. As I said, lonely and alone is not the same thing. It's fact. People don't die with you, and people don't get created with you. Alone means, you're the only one who can help yourself make your life what you want it to be. Other people can't fix you, and other people can't break you. You are the only person who can help yourself.

No, it's not a bad thing. It's empowering to know you can help yourself if you just grab yourself by the hair and pull yourself up.

Other people can affect you, yes. That does not make my statement any less true. Other people can not fix you or make your mood change unless you let them. 

My happiness is mine, and other people can't take that away. My troubles are mine, and nobody but me can fix them. Sure, others can give me advice, but the final decision is mine.

You wouldn't like being stranded on a deserted island? Well then build yourself a raft and get away from that island.

And don't try to tell me how I feel. I'm not lonely, and I'm not sad or depressed. I am completely happy."

Seriously. Read anything and everything. It's a really good way to put yourself in someone else's shoes in a safe way. It also helps you learn more about the world. Even bad books can teach you something.
