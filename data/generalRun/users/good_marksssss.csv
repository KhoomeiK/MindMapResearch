He finished the war as a Corporal. His best friend throughout the war was killed during some peacekeeping assignment in Israel in the 50's. That hurt him more than anything he saw in the war I think. My mum has told me that he used to leave the room whenever they memorialised WW2."

Irrespective of OP's horrific experience with an ignorant psychologist, there are psychiatric units that can provide help. Sure, they may not have anyone on staff who is well versed or has a clinical interest in ASD - but they can signpost and treat the depression and anxiety that is so often a co-morbidity of autism/ Asperger's. Sometimes, with mental health professionals, it can be a case of trial and error. The important thing is that you don't give up and keep plugging away at trying to get the best help and support that you possibly can.  


I speak from experience. I can relate to OP with the breakdowns and the awful mental health. If I hadn't sought treatment then I would still be in limbo and my assessment would not be happening."

They're ""turns"", ""twists"" or ""forks"" in vessels. The lumen of arteries/ the arterial endothelial cells are generally subject to much more turbulent flow than veins since the flow of blood isn't unidirectional and there's the matter of peripheral resistance to forward cardiac output."

I've been told that it's common to have to bring a parent or other close, first-degree relative with you to the assessment as they can give an account of what you were like growing up. It might take several visits/ interviews before a diagnosis is made, so yes, it does seem rather gruelling."

There's some tough scences, especially towards the end of the movie. They're probably tame by most modern standards, but at that time in history must have been extremely difficult to watch.

WTF,fe8t1bx,t1_fe8czyk,1578930458.0,"Blood loss, if severe enough, could lead to circulatory collapse. This wouldn't manifest as the ""classic"" presentation of a heart attack though.

What happens with most MI's is there is a steady accumulation of plaque in the lumen of the arteries over many years (atherosclerosis), which, in some people, can get to a stage where an atheroma can form within a coronary artery. The atheroma has the potential to become unstable and rupture - which will quickly lead to thrombus formation. The clot can then occlude the coronary artery within which it has formed and cause a heart attack.

I guess people with underlying health problems like chronic infections and endocrine issues could be more susceptible to experiencing MI through another mechanism.

There are some, more uncommon occurrences which can sort of mimic MI. Coronary vasospasm being one and other problems with the micro-vasculature. These entities are likely to result in angina - cardiac chest pain - they might even produce some EKG changes, but they are not classed as ""heart-attacks"".
