You have the right in a marriage to expect reciprocation. Tell him its rehab, a sober coach, and counseling while you live separate and maybe if you decide to stick it out you may or may not get back together. He obviously has issues he's not dealing with if he's an alcoholic. It's ok to start putting your needs first."

At the very least in CA they will seize any tax refunds. Funny story that happened with me and my ex. He ignored our daughters for years, got paid under the table to avoid wage garnishments, married another woman with 2 daughters. They were on shakey ground because he was selfish and she thought he was someone he wasn't cuz she was too dumb to see things for what they really were. So she actually had a legit job and I'm sure she was happy to be receiving a 750 dollare tax refund....but nope. Guess who got her refund cuz they were dumb enough to file joint. Yes... you guessed it...me! Well after that she promptly made it known that they were on the skids and subsequently split up."

raisedbynarcissists,ffdf3h2,t1_ffdcab9,1579819546.0,"You know it's funny how things are when we are kids and we don't even realize it until we are grown. My family was kind of poor, and my dad was an alcoholic. I guess all the neighbors knew this but I didn't know  that they knew. He'd make a scene every now and then when my parents would fight.  There were 5 of us kids and I was the only girl so I used to play with my girlfriend across the street to get away from my brothers. She grew up in a ""normal"" family, nice peaceful home, two attentive loving parents and I often went over there to play with her and swim in their pool, and secretly pretend I was part of their family. Her dad built her a playhouse and we'd pass the summer away hanging out at her house dipping in the pool, eating sunflower seeds in her playhouse all under the watchful eye of her stay home mom. I realize now that I probably wore out my welcome but as a latchkey kid I didn't realize it at the time. Fast forward 40 years later and I found out my friend lived in the same town as I. We had agreed to meet up for a barbecue. I went over with my two daughters and husband and lo and behold her parents were there as well. The look on her mothers face is something I will never forget. She looked at me like as if to say....... Oh wow look at you, you turned out ok. She hugged me and started to cry. I knew what the tears were about but my friend had no clue. I think she must have somehow felt bad for me and wondered what ended up happening to me and was glad I turned out ok in spite of my upbringing."

I'm also the kind of person who lets you do things your way, cuz I don't care how it gets done as long as it gets done. Some people prescribe to the notion that if it's not done their way then it's not done right.  Maybe he's afraid of not doing it your way or not doing it the right way. My husbands ex was like that, she'd berate him if he didn't fold the towels the way she wanted them to be folded so she'd unfold them and re-fold them her way. I told him, look as long as they get folded and can fit in the cabinet go for it. Also consider how he was raised, did his mom do everything in the house or did she train her kids to do chores?

Just that I freaked out with the stock market crash and I think I ended myself because of it, thus leaving my family to fend for themselves. I was told I lived in Chicago. From what I have learned the end goal is love, pure and simple we are here to learn how to love one another and find our way back to God.  A really awesome book I recommend you to read is ""A Journey To Self-Realization"" that book really opened my mind and help me understand the end goal. It's written by a Yogi Paramansa Yognanda. It explains not only the spiritual aspect but also the biological, metaphysical etc. of who we are and why we're here. I am a Christian but I'm also open minded and that book really helped me understand a lot. I've also been learning a lot about past lives and near death experiences. Good luck on your journey.

I had a reading done on my psychic ability and during the reading I asked about some past lives. Apparently my most recent past life was male/ mid 40's who was very  materialistic and lost everything in the stock market crash of the 20's. I ended up abandoning my family and left them to fend for themselves. I remember when I was a kid I was very driven to start a family and be a mom. I think my Karma is making up for the abandonment of my family as now I am really the main provider for them. I'm glad I have the opportunity to right a wrong. Maybe this will be my last incarnation.

Eventually you will come through the other side and believe it or not you will rejoice in the fact that you are free from the pain, worry, doubt, mistrust, speculation of his cheating ways. You are fee my dear. Put it behind you and be glad you didn't waste 13 years of your life with him the way I did.

There is a book I highly recommend written by a woman who was sexually abused by her father while her mother stood by and did nothing. She overcame the abuse and now is a minister. It's Christian based but the message is the same. The book is about healing the soul of a woman who was abused. The book is called Healing The Soul of a Woman by Joyce Meyer.

The fact that you and DH have had to repeatedly tell them you aren't interested in sharing is obvious that they don't acknowledge your boundaries.

I know you mentioned that you've told her off a few times but she might really just be that clueless on what boundaries are. I'm only mentioning this because we often think everyone thinks the way we do, but it's very telling that the moment she moved close to you she gave you a key to her house. Some people think an open door means you can just come on in anytime. I have a neighbor like that. She lives directly across the street and if my front door is open, we have a screen door that is closed though, she takes that as a sign that it's ok to stop by. I think maybe the first step would be to try and have a heart to heart talk and let her know that you have boundaries, both physical and emotional and she needs to respect them or you will be moving away and she will never see you or your child again if she oversteps.
