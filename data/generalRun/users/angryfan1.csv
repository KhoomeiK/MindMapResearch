nottheonion,fetk2l4,t1_feth0tx,1579376214.0,Truck drivers work for the biggest companies in the world. They are one of the most important parts of the consumer society we have in in the USA. Bus drivers only work because most people are to lazy to driver their kids to school or arrange a way for them to get to school.
nottheonion,fetcvnz,t1_fet75l6,1579374009.0,You need a special license to be a bus driver so it is studying and a road test. All of that work to then have to yell at kids to sit down and stop fighting. A truck driving license is almost the same process to get as a bus driver license but you don't have to put up with kids and make way more.

LivestreamFail,fee4cqg,t1_fecbra1,1579026134.0,It is because when you make comments about guys as a female streamer people gossip about if they are dating.
LivestreamFail,fee49i0,t1_fedsigz,1579026081.0,She works very hard to maintain an imagine on her channel for advertisers. I honestly do not blame her if i could make millions just by keeping things PG as a streamer I would.
LivestreamFail,fee40jc,t1_fed6r31,1579025934.0,I agree Pokimane on other peoples streams is way better than Pokimane on her streams
LivestreamFail,fed25yi,t1_fecvb1x,1578994969.0,"No  i did not miss the word live. I often watch live Youtube it has much better variety than Twitch and you can easily rewatch it. The smaller the channel the better experience with community. There is this law livestream where a lawyer gives his opinions on the outcome of cases. I could never find that content on Twitch because of how little variety it has. 

Not being able to find a good live channel on youtube has more to do with the ability to searching for content."
todayilearned,fecmry2,t1_fec6o93,1578977788.0,Actually that is pretty normal most humans live on or near a coast or a river that leads to a coast.
LivestreamFail,feb7be3,t1_feauf5z,1578956090.0,"The experience on Youtube is way better than twitch. The sheer variety of content on Youtube dwarfs Twitch. Lets be perfectly honest most of Twitch's content is not original and has no watch value after 2-3 months, the vast majority of content is gaming which is further divided into skill based or personality based. The Twitch site itself is so geared toward live content that the  prerecorded content is so hard to watch. The IRL part of twitch is mostly podcasts which usually ends up on youtube, people switching between games, and  livestreaming people walking around which Facebook shutdown do to the many problems it had even though Facebook livestream were way better than Twitch's livestream due to the livestream map.

Youtube is like unregulated TV with everybody and their mother making content. If you just search a little you can really go down a rabbit hole of excellent content."
noveltranslations,fe0m4h6,t3_enjuck,1578815897.0,I know which novel you are talking about but i can not for the life of me remember the name of it. It shouldn't be to hard to find if you use the tag and search function of Royal road.
AmItheAsshole,fdx29s1,t1_fdtt68q,1578764582.0,"It is not free she has to pay for insurance, gas, and tolls. She probably will not have the cash to buy a new car when she goes to college with all of those bills. She is basically paying to use a car it is the argument of leasing verse owning a car. The payment being her having to ferry her brothers around and do errands."
AmItheAsshole,fdso6ot,t1_fdrd6b5,1578705785.0,Yeah but at least it will be hers when she turns 18.

LivestreamFail,fdnlv4k,t1_fdn4xut,1578588509.0,It is so weird to see you posting. You used to post so much in the ask reddit sections back in the day now i don't see you at all.

castiron,fdm780o,t1_fdlzb58,1578541502.0,"Use soap don't listen to other people who say not to use it. The soap thing comes from a time when soap were much harsher than modern soap.

 After you wash it with soap and any metal scrubber, rinse it off. Put a little of any oil in the pan, and wipe it all out with a paper towel so there is a thin layer of oil in the pan, then heat the pan so it starts to smoke a little then take it off.

You can also treat you cast iron pan like a regular steel pan just use and abuse it. A cast iron can be used and abused much worse than any other pan, so don't baby it. When you get accustomed to using it, and want to try the maintenance techniques you hear about on this sub you can try them, even after 10 to 20 years of daily use the pan will still work like a new pan."

TinyTits,fcszxu7,t1_fcsslcw,1577929315.0,This picture feels so much like jail bait. I joined this subreddit for girls with small but perky tits.
todayilearned,fckznf6,t1_fckvdfg,1577736624.0,"Yeah the reason why the guests go on the show is because they need a platform to promote their projects. It is the sole reason why they come on the show. When the host stops them from promoting the project or takes attention away from the guest it seems like a waste of time that could be spent doing other things that could actually help them. 

The host of  Late Night shows knows this. If they only wanted to be entertaining they should be in movies or sitcoms. I feel like that being a good Late Night show host has more responsibilities than just being entertaining. I was listening to Conan O'brien talk about how one of the obligations he has when a guest comes on is to help them be as great as possible if he sees the guest go off on something left field he should bring them back. When a guest is making a joke he should help them make the joke."
todayilearned,fckt8md,t1_fcjrbsn,1577732686.0,Yeah but entertaining the viewers is not why multi millionaire movie stars go on the show. Taking away valuable promotion time just so the host can make a joke is sort of an asshole move.
todayilearned,fcjr0yc,t1_fcjow3p,1577700287.0,"A tv interviewer's job is to entertain the audience and make the guests come off as good a possible. A bad tv interviewer comes off like Jerry Springer talking to his guests, he interrupts them and makes them look stupid to entertain the viewers. That is why Jimmy Fallon is such a horrible interviewer. He interrupts guests to laugh and tries to outstage the guest even though he is on a hour everyday. He still wants more tv time focused on him at the expense of his guests"
todayilearned,fcjo896,t1_fcjnsps,1577696278.0,There are so few good tv interviewers it is sort of upsetting. You can really count on your hand how many talk show host are good at interviews.
oddlysatisfying,fcc4rqm,t1_fcc2dtj,1577594403.0,That works for all pans. If you put coconut oil on cast iron and heat it  until it smokes the pan will be non stick. Cast iron is just to much work if you only casually cook.
todayilearned,fcbaj0j,t1_fcauq3g,1577584494.0,Too bad that 5 million for American Idol is all they are ever going to make from that show because it has no rewatch value and cant be syndicated.
LivestreamFail,fc7div7,t1_f9mdajs,1577504242.0,9k viewers is a huge streamer on twitch. I can imagine both shroud and ninja are happy not to deal with Twitch's bullshit.

ArtisanVideos,fbx3vf3,t1_fbwsu6m,1577168285.0,I just assumed it was fake because of the lack of sweat. This fat old man is doing wood work without any power tools and is not breaking a sweat. Just doing this kind of work would be back breaking work. There is a reason why people do not do it that way anymore.
ArtisanVideos,fbx3mbl,t1_fbvs8d3,1577167990.0,Really aren't Japanese buildings over a certain age like 40 years old considered pretty crappy by almost everyone. This is mostly due to the buildings not having earthquake resistance. Japan housing prices have been going down in most places outside of Tokyo.
OutOfTheLoop,fb9q4tp,t1_fb8wbh6,1576645901.0,"Thomas Jefferson lived in time so far removed from today most of what he is says in those quotes do not apply to life in the USA today. Keep in mind that when he made those quotes America was very new and really didn't have a strong Army. He said that because he feared the British attacking and America losing its independence.

FYI the British did end up invading in the the war of 1812."
