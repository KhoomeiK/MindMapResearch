skeptic,ffoku2e,t1_ffoexh5,1580078704.0,"We could all do better to be more skeptical and critical of the media we consume and the ideas presented in it, especially when those ideas confirm our biases. I don't think that's a controversial statement at all and it's one of the tenets of skepticism. I'm just addressing human nature. 

&#x200B;

Also, it's clear that JRE is unique. People are used to journalists doing some level of due diligence. Joe very openly and admittedly does not. If that were the norm, it wouldn't be worth making the point, but because his style is very much unique and apart from what most audiences expect, I think it's worth making.

&#x200B;

I don't think I'm being uncharitable to anyone here. I'm just pointing out a potential consequence of human nature and aspect of the JRE I admitted made for some great long form interviews, free from sound-bite answers and all that nonsense. 

I'm truly sorry if I triggered you by implying Bro Jogans have the same critical thinking capacity as most modern americans, but as Joe would say, if you're offended, it's because you took offense, not because I gave it."
skeptic,ffngdmt,t1_ffnedur,1580065584.0,"It isn't entirely the fans themselves but other organizations who take Joe's interviews or comments out of context. I think what kicked this off Bernie's campaign tweeted about Joe ""endorsing"" him. Now a whole host of media organizations are trying to leverage that connection to smear Bernie or whatever by associating him with all this other shit Joe is accused of. I don't think that would happen if Dave Chappelle ""endorsed"" a candidate. 

Joe is unique because JRE is more popular than his comedy, I think. People don't see him as a comedian but as a podcaster, which traditional media is treating like an interviewer."
skeptic,ffnexk9,t1_ffmlb99,1580065089.0,"This is an excellent criticism of what's wrong Joe's ""I'm just having a conversation"" approach to interviews. I think he has at least some responsibility to his guests, who listen faithfully to his show and fill his bank account, to at least vet the guests on his show, so he doesn't spend two or three hours going ""oh, interesting"" while an idiot talks. 

However, many of the things that he's been criticised for isn't something a guest has come on and said, but stuff he said, to multiple guests, notably the trans athlete stuff. He got into a fairly heated debate with Adam Connover when he was on the podcast. 

The idea that he's too credulous in his interviews is kind of a separate issue from the idea that his claim ""it's unfair for female athletes to compete against transwomen"" is transphobic."
skeptic,ffnc1rz,t1_ffn8a8u,1580064176.0,"That's kind of the entire point of my comment, that he doesn't conduct his interview the way a journalist would, and there are some pros to cons to that approach. The cons become exacerbated when the audience treats him as though he were a journalist, and fails to remember he's just a commedian having a conversation."
skeptic,ffmuhky,t1_ffma4q8,1580059069.0,"There's nothing wrong with it as long as the the audience understands that's what's going on. There's a lot wrong with it if they don't. 

A traditional interview, done by an actual journalist, would differ a lot from a Rogan podcast. The journalist would vet the person being interviewed, determine if the person's opinion qualifies as news worthy, and do their own research before the interview. Then, if the interviewee says some bogus shit, the interview would respond with something like, ""isn't true that multiple studies have shown no link between vaccines and autism?""

Joe doesn't do that. He's not ""conducting an interview"" he's ""having a conversation"". He has long, in depth, 190 minute conversations with people and doesn't challenge them and largely hasn't done any research. His guests get very comfortable. They have three hours to talk, so they don't have to condense complicated ideas into sound bites. They don't have to worry about a ""gotcha question"". Joe doesn't do that. This makes for gro interviews. 

But all that means is that we, as the audience, have to skeptical, and we have to evaluate the guests claims critically, because Joe isn't. Joe's format only works if he is engaging and credulous. So he is deliberately credulous. He has admitted this. It's up to us to use critical thinking. 

That's a lot to ask of an audience sometimes."

2) People ignore the bad stuff their own candidate does because of tribalism. The reason someone would support Hillary after the things she did is because they'll just support anyone who's a Democrat regardless of how terrible the Democratic is. They also criticize Trump not because they oppose his policies but because he's a Republican. Presidential elections are popularity contests determined by whichever tribe gets more people to show up.

ENLIGHTENEDCENTRISM,fefijy3,t1_fedetvi,1579057055.0,"We live in a society where a woman gets to choose which man will pass on their genes. They are the gatekeepers of sex and gatekeeping is wrong. Guy has an overbite? Swipe left. Guy has a big nose? Swipe left. She's only going to swipe right if the guy matches her desired phenotype. So only desired phenotypes get to pass on their genes to the next generation. This agency modern society gives females, it's the same as the state forcibly sterilizing gypsies.

ENLIGHTENEDCENTRISM,fefbffc,t1_fed22aj,1579052625.0,"The joke in OP is just as funny if instead of being decapitated, he's being confined to a cell for life sentence, and he as the door closes the Nazi says ""so much for the tolerant left"". This is because the joke isn't mocking Nazis for being murdered in the French revolution, which never happened, but the tendency for Nazis to claim the left is hypocritical for not tolerating their desire for genocide as much as we tolerate Jews for existing, which happens all the time. Neonazis and white nationalists cry foul anytime the left has the audacity to call their ideology racist. A joke about putting Nazis in prison would trigger them just as much. 

The bogus centrism that is mocked here is the idea that on one hand Jews just want to not be murdered, and on the other hand neo Nazis just want a white ethnostate, and so we have to compromise in the middle somehow to avoid appearing partisan and maintain the status quo. We don't. There is no paradox of tolerance. 

Furthermore, while a society that puts people to death for mass murder isn't as enlightened as one that puts them in prison of life, it is still more enlightened then a society that commits genocide. 

""Norway is better than you"" is not the same as ""you guys are just as bad as Nazis"". Are you really responding to a good faith criticism of the death penalty, or are you just responding to a lame attempt to create the same false equivalency the joke is making fun of."

unpopularopinion,fef02l2,t1_feevcum,1579045027.0,"No. That's not what I claimed. 

The fraction of people that lean right and voted for Donald Trump is greater than the fraction of right leaning voters who voted for the previous two right leaning candidates. 

Now, compared to a hypothetical, but totally unreal, perfect candidate, who would get 100% of right wing voters, Trump can't be considered representative. 

However, compared to historical precedents, based on candidates who are real, as opposed to imaginary, Trump got the largest fraction of right wing support of any candidate since 2008. 

Furthermore, Trump absolutely fucking dominated the primaries. Right wing voters who participated in the primaries overwhelmingly prefered Donald Trump, in both the polls leading up to the contests and the contests themselves. 

Now, I don't have data on right wing folks who didn't participate in either the poles or the contests, but neither do you. Based on the data I *do* have, it is clear that Trump is supported much more than any other right wing candidate that exists in the real world, since 2008. While he may not represent the ideals of every single right leaning person, the available data suggest he has broad support among right wing voters, and that he is supported enthusiastically by his base. That's the point I was making."
ENLIGHTENEDCENTRISM,feewr94,t1_fedz93a,1579042886.0,"Nobody here is attempting to change anyone's mind.

There are plenty of places where progressives and leftists proselytize or campaign. This isn't one of them. This is a place where people who enjoy the same type of jokes share those jokes for laughs. 

Think about yourself: is the best way to win others to your way of thinking coming to this sub and scolding us for our memes? No. But you're doing it anyway because our jokes triggered you.

unpopularopinion,feejkxm,t1_fedwho2,1579035058.0,Trump won the Republican primary by a healthy margin and was then elected because more of the right wing base showed up to support him than Romney or McCain.

ENLIGHTENEDCENTRISM,feeh2kc,t3_eoo18x,1579033610.0,"There's a huge difference between having principles and tribalism. You are assuming we just disagree with the right because they are on a different team or whatever. We actually disagree with the right because our ideals are very different. 

The centrists we are mocking aren't actually trying to establish a compromise between two opposing sides. They are just saying ""both sides are the same, so might as well just concede to the right since it's the same as the left"". Conceding to one extreme because you incorrectly perceive both extremes are identical is not centrism and is very stupid. 

""Both sides are the same"" arguments boil down to communist regimes and facists regimes both bad, or both left and right say mean things on Twitter. There's never discussion on the issues within contemporary politics because in contemporary American politics both sides are not the fucking same. 

One side wants to build a wall, one side doesn't. A having a border wall and not having one are different, not the same. One side thinks climate change is fake and wants to subsidize coal. One side thinks climate change is real and wants to subsidize renewable energy. One side is prochoice, the other is pro life. Those stances, if you look closely, are not the same, but different. I would prefer candidates who were prochoice and believed in climate change.

Centrism that attempts to take a middle ground between two extremes might be somewhat valuable, but not as valuable as someone who could actually accomplish progressive goals. What has zero value is clowns like you who say ""Soviets and Nazis were both bad, so I can't support either side"". 

If both sides are the same, why don't centrists ever expect the right to concede? ""Soviets and Nazis were equally bad so you might as well vote for a candidate who's in favor of teaching evolution and sex ed instead of creationism and abstinence only."""
