indieheads,fffx52b,t1_fffncb3,1579893731.0,"this was the first song of theirs i heard (on the radio of all places) and made me check them out. i'm always suckered in for a dark, halloween vibe song and it opened me up to their greatness."
indieheads,fffwwd0,t1_fffn9ms,1579893581.0,i liked 7 much more than Depression Cherry and Thank Your Lucky Stars. The latter two are my least favorite in their discography so it was great for me to hear them bounce back with 7

news,fff00nl,t1_ffdjico,1579871839.0,"Yes I have done studies and it shows more people would watch longer. People always lean on ""well there must be a reason!"" like corporations never make poor decisions. They make dumb decisions all the time and very slowly adapt to change well past the time they should have already. The NFL just has a major oversight here."
news,ffdhxyh,t1_ffcqwxy,1579821241.0,But what's the downside to either starting it 1-2 hours earlier so the largest market (East coast) can make the whole game or just have it on Saturday? More ad revenue would be made this way since you'd keep eyeballs on the game longer overall which is all they care about
nfl,ffd4c4f,t1_ffcp746,1579813164.0,"Eli was never a top 5 QB in the league. *Maybe* one year (2011) if that, but i wouldn't count that."
nfl,ffd45iz,t1_ffciy85,1579813063.0,i'm a Giants fan here to say Eli was never great and doesn't deserve to be in the HOF. He was never an elite QB during his era. I'll certainly be happy when he does get in though since he's my guy.

nfl,ff1wsg2,t1_fespowf,1579487965.0,"40% of Brady's playoff wins have come with a passer rating less than 90. After tonight's game, 62.5% of Rodgers' playoff losses have come with a passer rating greater than 90. That speaks volumes to how much the game is decided by the whole team and coaches yet people still focus on crediting the QB way too much win or lose."

NYGiants,fet6zoy,t1_fesyjgq,1579372359.0,Dak is a good QB but not great especially when Zeke isn't on the field. You can definitely win a superbowl with Dak. I'd take Dak over Jones right now but I totally expect Jones in the future to be at least around the level that Dak is right now if not better.

AdviceAnimals,fe6k7uz,t1_fe6ihko,1578893613.0,"Bonds can also bust too. Not as risky as stocks of course, but they hold their own risk. A good, ""non-risky"" bond won't yield much more than a savings account and it's way less liquid."

discgolf,fe62xwh,t1_fe62b8r,1578880593.0,Interesting. Be careful. Most charts will show you have a good chance of frostbite after an hour of play at -38 with no wind. With wind and it's  worse obviously. I've gotten it snowboarding in -26 before and it's not fun.
