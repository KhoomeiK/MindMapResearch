Dogtraining,ffojh3l,t3_eud2ju,1580078328.0,"I think you jumped the gun on the amount of time you expect the little dude to remain crated. I wouldn’t leave I’m him in there for more than 2 hrs at a time with good long walks in between until he’s a bit older. I recommend continuing to work on crate training In small batches, and hiring someone to come let him out 2-3 times while you’re at work"
dogs,ffnmkbw,t1_ffnlbv0,1580067898.0,"I’ve had a very different experience with the breed. They’ve all been moody, particular about food, when and where they can be touched, particular about which humans and dogs are allowed near them. I don’t doubt that this is breeding based, and owners faults as well. But ensuring that you’ll find a good breeder in this day and age is difficult. And I will only ever recommend the breed to people who are willing to work with moody, particular dogs. It’s not fair to the dogs to end up in homes not warned about the possibility that they are poorly bred, and will have these issues"
dogs,ffnjava,t1_ffnigub,1580066679.0,"I think that your best bet would to ask all of your local rescues about dogs they have in foster homes. This would allow you to speak with someone who has lived with a dog in a home setting and knows how much exercise it needs, how well it walks on leash, and will be able to tell you what training it has and still needs. You’ll be able to pick the right dog for your life"
dogs,ffniau0,t1_ffnhi0y,1580066291.0,"I would recommend a minimum of an hour walking each day, and preferably more. With added mental stimulation. You will see destructive behavior very quickly with this breed of not properly stimulated and exercised"
dogs,ffnh0oq,t3_euaw5r,1580065858.0,"Dalmatians are very aggression prone, and are not recommended for people with children. If you plan on having kids in the next 10-12 years while the dog is alive I would recommend a different breed. 1.5 hrs exercise daily will be enough if you include about a 1/2 hr of mental stimulation. You will also need to break up the exercise over the course of the day. Jog in the morning before work, let the dog out for a short walk at lunch time and another walk or jog after work. Then use its meals as rewards in training sessions. Plan to let this breed go potty 4 or more times a day as well."
fatpeoplestories,ffn2jiq,t1_ffn1lk6,1580061306.0,"I had to take a good long look at how I was interacting with them, and it seems that what they were most upset about was the “no I can’t do brunch today, I’ll be hiking but we can go shopping later!” And the “is it okay if we go to (restaurant with whole food option) instead?” They just wanted our friendship to remain how it used to be, only meeting up to eat"
fatpeoplestories,ffmzx3y,t3_eu9t1v,1580060603.0,"Sort of, I got really passionate about health after overhauling my diet to be all whole, unprocessed foods, and exercising every day. I feel great and will never look back. But one of my heavier friends accused me of judging their lifestyle and said that I wasn’t fun because I didn’t order junk when we went out together. We don’t speak anymore and it’s for the better. The only thing we used to have in common was junk food apparently"
Dogtraining,ffm47f4,t3_eu5ym7,1580048146.0,"This dog sounds anxious, overstimulated, and like he’s learned how to get rewards for unsavory behavior. I recommend writing out a schedule that you can follow on work days and weekends. 
Example-
Wake up and jog with dog2-3 miles. 
Train dog with breakfast as reward.
Let dog pee again.
Crate dog, go to work.
Lunch break walk +training session
Crate dog, go to work.
Long walk and training session. 
Dinner for dog 
Tether dog in house with on 6ft leash with a Kong and NOTHING ELSE NEARBY HE CAN DESTROY. Ignore dog completely until last potty break of day. 
Back in crate for night, 
Rinse and repeat.

Pup needs to get used to alone time, and not be rewarded constantly for not screaming. This is going to take some time a patience but the dog doesn’t seem to have an off switch and knows you’ll cave and give him what he wants. When he’s calmer on his new schedule-reintroduce hikes and more fun things like dog parks. I would go as far as to pull him off the trail, or out of the park and time him up and go sit down and ignore him if he acts up for attention."
Horses,ffjfw9s,t3_etul4g,1579997393.0,Yes all the time! I bring my dogs two work with me and my senior horse is stabled a couple of miles away so everyday at lunch we all go on a long walk down the road so everybody can stretch their legs

Dogtraining,fffrb0t,t1_fffpea5,1579890095.0,I agree. Seems like pooch needs to be stimulated and entertained. I would crate him at night and get him out for long walks as soon as you’re up for the day.
Dogtraining,fffnjme,t3_etdjeq,1579887786.0,I would wake him up and take him outside until he’s old enough to hold it better. Figure out how long he normally naps for and wake him up 5-10 mins early for potty
dogs,fffjjtd,t1_fffj529,1579885331.0,"Try teaching him to play red light green light!

Sit him down at the end of his chain and call him forward, let him take two steps and ask him to stop and sit. Then call him to run forward and ask him to stop and sit before he gets to you, variations of distance and speed will keep his mind working"
dogs,fffityl,t3_etcqqn,1579884893.0,Are you able to drive him to a plowed park? Or go behind or beside the house and set up an agility course and teach him how to do it on a leash?
dogs,fff7fqy,t1_fff6x4a,1579877617.0,I know plenty of puppies who are crate trained by the time they’re a couple of months old and are very content to take their naps when put away. What types of crate training methods have you tried? They shouldn’t  be hurting themselves when put away properly worn out and reassured that they’ll be allowed out later

dogs,ffexq5p,t1_ffeeajf,1579869674.0,"The two week shut down is definitely not great for most or all dogs. My rescues have both lived with people before they came to me, they know what a routine is and what walks are. They’re medium sized dogs and would have eaten my entire apartment if I didn’t start taking them on long walks the first day they came home.  For the dog park, just wait until you’re sure of the new pups temperament and walk him instead until you’re comfortable with him around other dogs. Have him drag his leash his first few visits to the dog park as well, so you can grab him quickly if needed and work on his recall."
dogs,ffewjck,t1_ffet7a4,1579868458.0,A reinforced nap after he walks and has some water is great too. Puppies need a lot of sleep and it’s hard for them to decide to put themselves to bed. After his walk put him in his crate or someone’s bedroom aNd leave him alone for a couple hours so he can sleep and the older dog can enjoy the quite
Dogtraining,ffawt63,t3_esmaqn,1579746318.0,"Make sure you have time to walk and run this dog on leash 2-3 times a day with more potty breaks between.  He will be high energy and stubborn, and you won’t want to allow him around other dogs off leash until you’re certain of his temperament in a few months. 
You’ll need a large bag of food, two bowls, a large crate, a harness, a collar, dog tags, money for a 3 month vet check, two or more leashes (keep one in the car and an extra in the house is nice) a poop bag dispenser and a large box of poop bags. You’ll need plush toys, Rope toys, rubber toys and tennis balls to see what your dog likes. High quality soft and chewy treats for training. A dog bed, blankets, a dog first sit kid. You’ll need a portable dog water bowl and bottle for your adventures, a dog boots/ possibly jacket if it’s cold where you are. You will need a play pen or baby gates to insure he is always with you or crated until you trust him alone in the house. Some towels you don’t mind drying a wet dog with, dog shampoo, a brush for his hair type, a nail trimmer, and a dog tooth brush and ear cleaning kit"
Dogtraining,ff9n3tx,t3_esdmup,1579716460.0,"Check with your vet, and I recommend feeding dinner at around 5 PM if not a bit earlier. Then going on at least a mile or two walk before bed to let him eliminate as much as he needs to and wear him out for the night"
dogs,ff8r4te,t3_es9k04,1579692699.0,"I would go to your local shelters during non peak hours and spend some time going over this with them. Being your boyfriends first dog I think you’ll be better off with a young adult and not a puppy. This will also allow you to find a dog that’s good with hanging on the sofa when you’re both working or can’t fit in an adventure that day. If you do go the puppy route with your chosen breed, I recommend having the pup take its reinforced naps in a crate in a room separate from where your boyfriend is working to prevent developing too much of a dependency"
Dogtraining,ff7gmyj,t3_es2kb3,1579649099.0,"Set your dog up for success. Put all food away where he can’t reach it. Make sure he’s getting lots of good training sessions outside of the house. On your walks make sure he’s getting two 15 minute obedience sessions a day minimum. With high reward treats. Your dog needs to see that you= work= food outside of the house before he will listen to you above food inside the house. Exercise exercise exercise, a tired lab is a happy lab. Might be time to pick up jogging if you haven’t already. In short, work harder to make sure he’s worn out, willing to listen to you, and has less access to food when he is home."
Dogtraining,ff69hhe,t3_erw39w,1579622265.0,"I use my place command for this, which is just the dog hanging out where I ask them to. Then throw the ball, walk around for a bit and say UP! As their release. My high drive dog goes for the ball and my low drive goes and sniffs around"
Dogtraining,ff4nx1y,t3_ermt8a,1579568201.0,"I take all of the small cardboard boxes home from work, put a high reward treat in a few and scatter 9 or so total boxes, some empty around the apartment and have the dog lead me to and then open(the fun part) the ones that contain treats. For outside, I take them to a nearby field and play similar games with the boxes and teach the dogs only to destroy the ones with goodies inside so they can’t guess"
Dogtraining,ff4lchy,t3_ermg2i,1579566402.0,"For friends and family’s dogs, meet them and go on a nice long walk with both dogs in heel position, no interaction until the walk is over and their body language is relaxed. Just let them be in the same space, with their people, following commands for some time so they can get used to the others presence She doesn’t have to meet strange dogs, I would advise that you avoid them forever."

Dogtraining,ff36ssy,t1_ff35wxg,1579535051.0,"I would start by YouTubing puppy potty training, find a method that fits your lifestyle. Make sure the puppy has a very solid routine. Yard time, walks, food, naps at the same time every day. Head to a pet store and load up on specialized scent removing sprays and scrub everywhere the dog has gone potty inside. Then commit to your picked potty training method from YouTube (or elsewhere online, or a local hired trainer) and just stay consistent. As puppy grows and eats more food, you’ll need to be more vigilant about making sure edge gets outside 15 mins after meals, right after he wakes up, and several times throughout the day until you can adjust him to his adult schedule"
Dogtraining,ff35qo2,t3_ere7db,1579534321.0,Go back to potty training basics.. but check the yard for cleanliness. You may need to hose it down and poop scoop more often. Consider walking the dog for potty and leaving the yard as a place to play. It will remain cleaner and the dog gets more exercise that way.
Dogtraining,ff355fe,t3_erebvh,1579533920.0,"How long have you had the dog?

Does the dog get long structured walks for potty and exercise or just yard time?"
dogs,ff34uhp,t3_erdszn,1579533709.0,"Dogs can help, if you are already helping yourself. But if the dog gets a short walk, or misses one, she will likely destroy something out of frustration and boredom, or poop in the house, or get into the trash, ect.. which will make you feel worse. The lab will need 2-3 long walks a day and plenty of fetch, training, car rides to the beach or woods for an afternoon out. If this is something you can’t supply for yourself, don’t trust yourself to supply it for a dog"
Dogtraining,ff2t1tv,t3_er7p1i,1579522954.0,"Looks like you’ve already tried the vet, I recommend giving him one last long walk and training session an hour or two before kennel time for a week or so to see if he’s just not worn out enough to sleep through the night.

Dogtraining,fesrntd,t3_eqj4x4,1579368305.0,"Have the dog sleep in another room. And anxious dogs always benefit from loads of daily exercise and a strict routine.

Dogtraining,fernhxg,t3_eqd4ys,1579356130.0,"Make sure his feeding schedule is consistent, and make sure that he’s getting enough exercise to keep his bowel movements regular. A couple of walks and some running around time every single day. You can try walking him a short distance, bringing him back to the yard, walking him in the yard on leash until he goes and then finishing your walk. But most dogs prefer not to go in places they play or spend time. This training might take a while to really stick"
dogs,fepj65i,t3_eqbrt0,1579321857.0,"You either have to do something or forget about it. Knowing that animals are being neglected is heart wrenching, and it will only get worse for you if you let it fester. It sounds like they shouldn’t have animals or kids, so if you want to do something about it, look up the laws in your area and see if any of it actually counts as a use or neglect. (Hoarding usually does, and it sounds like they hoed animals) you may also have to chose between your SO and helping the animals. Decide how important this is to you, and take action, find someone who will, or forget about it."
Dogtraining,fepgpw6,t3_eqb6yl,1579320058.0,"It sounds like your dog is smart enough to know that tricks aren’t worth the effort unless she benefits. The key to solving this is engagement. If you are the coolest part of your dogs life, she will be more willing to work for you. Pick up all of her toys for a while. Take them out only to play with her, so that the key to the game is you. Make sure that you have a rock solid heel command trained and take her on lots of long walks, a couple a day. Instead of sniffing or seeing other dogs on walks, she’ll have to focus on you, when you ask her to heel and when she’s allowed to stop to go potty. Feed her dinner in small amounts at a time, using dinner as a reward for tricks. The dog needs to understand that you control how things run (not in a alpha way) and that if she works for you, she gets good long walks, play, food, and all of her other favorites. For the barking- teach her to speak. Then teach her to be quite."

Dogtraining,felae0i,t3_epqvz9,1579217566.0,"The simplest solution is set routine and boundaries. Close the basement door if you can and ask other to behind them.

The issue with dogs is that they will act up the second the daily training and long walks start to slack. To keep a hyper obedient dog fixated on its handlers, you will need to participate in a dog sport, or at least train for one that you don’t preform in. The more you interact with a dog, the more you get out of the dog.  This being said, you will also need a reputable breeder that can offer training resources, kenneling resources when you need to go away, and advice on weather or not the breed is right for your family and if you will have time for it.

Dogtraining,fe042in,t3_ene4t9,1578802563.0,"Vet first, pain can cause aggression in dog (bring his muzzle and warn the vet that he isnâ€™t friendly)

Evaluate his training and exercise, make sure heâ€™s getting enough. That breed needs a lot. 

Crate train, he needs to be comfortable when people are over or youâ€™ll only make matters worse.

Hire a professional. Search one that comes to your home, and specializes in reactivity and aggression."

Dogtraining,fdvvy7i,t1_fdvswyp,1578752215.0,"Some dogs can take up to several months to get used to their new house, especially if the routine is very different. Heel training and eye contact training wear dogs out very quickly on walks, as well as letting them in front of you on a long line and teaching them so sit and wait for you at a distance. Best of luck."
Dogtraining,fdvrcd0,t3_en6jtu,1578750629.0,"Keep the dog outside if you want, but she needs walks, training, hikes, games of fetch, and more interaction. A yard is not, and has never been a good substitute for exercise. All of our destructive rescues have come from situations  where people used a yard to babysit instead of taking the time to raise the dog. A yard to take care of a dog is akin to putting a smart kid in front of the tv all day, theyâ€™re going to want to get out, and break things"

Dogs need and deserve walks, and need to go to the vet, sometimes big dogs just need a little more communication, and that usually comes in the form of training tools."

Secondly- routine for anxious dogs is key. Walks every morning before breakfast, yard time (or more walks) mid day, a couple of training sessions between and another evening walk. 

Thirdly- reintroduce baby to dog on leash, with supervision, and hopefully with a trainer present. Anxiety meds never worked for my shepsky. But routine and exercise and plenty of patience did wonders"
Dogtraining,fdegg40,t3_ekykf9,1578338485.0,"You need to keep Otto away from the dog park until you have a bombproof recall and heel position trained. In your pups mind, growling has worked because the people heâ€™s growled at havenâ€™t ended up approaching him further or trying to touch him, youâ€™re in the early stages of having a reactive or aggressive dog. I always recommend hiring a trainer. But finding your preferred method of recall, heel, and place training will be invaluable to keeping your dog safe. Otto doesnâ€™t need to like strangers, but he does need to ignore them and focus on you."
