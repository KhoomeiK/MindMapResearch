AskReddit,fdhoid3,t1_fdgul9t,1578426987.0,What do you do? I’m in law school and just took antitrust last semester! Never took any economics or business in undergrad so the course was tough. But it was pretty fascinating...
aww,fd6ygke,t1_fd6xmcj,1578197274.0,"None of us were athlete level fit! We were in shape, for sure, but nothing special. It’s all about knowing your limits and recognizing signs of being overheated/threat of heat stroke/exhaustion. We drank lots of water and Gatorade to stay hydrated and took plenty of breaks.

We actually did have multiple people per character. At my school, we had two characters and two people per character. For my character, we would each mascot a half. Basketball (we are a blue blood school so it was a big deal to mascot), the varsity person for each character would do the games since they are much shorter and more temperature controlled than football.

It was definitely a physical activity though. My pants would almost slide off of me after games because of how much water weight I had lost!"
