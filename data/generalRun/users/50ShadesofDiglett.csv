The straight white man thing may as well be an irrelevant biproduct. They just coincidentally happen to be straight white men.

Those straight white men make up less than 0.01 pct of the straight white man population. A good number of them are closet gay, bi or pedofiles. They deserve their own group. It's not about race or gender to them. It's about class. Lumping them in with straight white men is not only an insult to straight white men around the world, but it actually dilutes the problem even further by introducing a race aspect when they don't even see colour.

So if you advertised it and had rules, you're asking for trouble.

Everything is black and white with the privilege of having been raised in a decent country where the idea of slavery (which is ironic given the us' history...) is unimaginable. Keep in mind shit like this happens around the US every day.

You're 100 pct right that slavery in a rub in tug is almost guaranteed to be better than having that place busted and brought back to some back water opium den where the women are force fed drugs to keep them complacent and they get raped incessantly by disgusting perverts all day and night. Fading into anonymity until they die or are killed.

But the idea of slavery is ""wrong"" and so obviously the choice is easy. I find redittors in general see the world in black and white and all choices are easy and obvious. They can rarely think farther than 1 degree of separation from their decision and the possible consequences. Ie the sun will rise and it will be sunny. Forgetting the hundreds of other benefits (or consequences) the sun provides for the earth. This point of view in and of itself is the product of the privilege we enjoy in a first world country.

BlackPeopleTwitter,fci6mt4,t1_fchzen9,1577658361.0,"Yes offender is the offending person serving their prison time.

Officer is the Correctional Officer or equivalent title working the security operations of a prison.

I wouldn't say gang subculture I'd say prison subculture instead. No all prisons have gangs and not all gangs go to prison. Each institution has its own prison subculture and hierarchy. Some can be similar and some can be totally satelite.

Depending on the guard maybe not. Any decent officer in my opinion knows it's just a show of saving face for the inmate so he doesn't have to answer to the range leaders or ""heavies"" of the unit. The higher ranked inmates don't have to because they're the ones with the hired muscle, smuggling the drugs and phones and other commodities into the institution, or orchestrating the act of. And so, they have ""underlings"" to run minor errands."

BlackPeopleTwitter,fchfpd9,t1_fchbu7n,1577650037.0,"It's actually true. Been working in prisons for over 10 years both as an Officer and a clerk. Male offenders almost always ironically call the Officers boss. Those low enough on the prison totem pole to actually have to talk to one. Usually seen as a sign of weakness to do so. But when they do, it's : ""Hey boss. Can you do this for me?"" or ""fuck off boss."""
everymanshouldknow,fch7ihd,t1_fcg8c1x,1577647989.0,"Adding to this: there's actually no proof whatsoever that any historian or researcher can find that pinpoints jesus' birthday to the 25th. Its theorized, pretty reasonably, that the date was actually stolen from an ancient Roman holiday celebrating the winter solstice. (they celebrated it after the solstice since generally the solstice was a busy time). And so even the date itself is a joke."
everymanshouldknow,fch73rt,t1_fcgqqye,1577647859.0,"Chinese new year? Ramadan? Bodhi?

Let's say that Christmas is statistically the biggest by participation (which I doubt given that China takes up 20 pct of the earth's population and Chinese new year is a HUGE cultural thing over there...) but for the sake of argument and devils advocate. Christmas Is2 the biggest: it still only applies to a very finite data set of men in the world and doesn't apply to ANY man outside of the Christmas culture subset. So how does a man from China knowing Christmas is a festive time in Western culture help him in his culture?

Everyman should know how to survive in the wild. Not every man needs to know about Christmas. It's ignorant and asinine."

golf,fcbfxlv,t1_fcazxvb,1577586376.0,"Yeah I never understood the Nike gear hate. Their balls were rebranded Bridgestone at a discount price most of the time. One Tour D one of the best feeling and performing balls of all time Imo. Obviously their clubs didn't have the buttery feel of mizunos or miura but then again no one does. Sure their drivers with the cavity backs were slightly off base but once you got used to them they gave great numbers. And their stuff was always 20 pct off. How can you go wrong? I quite frankly really like their gear and rocked it for years.

Those old school stainless steel Nike blades shot me my best rounds of all time and my first round under par. Still miss the feel and performance of those to this day. VR Pro Blades were the shit."
sports,fcb95uz,t1_fc81ew5,1577583989.0,"Don't forget that athletes today get to start with and build on the foundations set by their champion predecessors. So you almost start slightly ahead because you get to model yourself off of the previously great, and then adapt and improve on that formula to suit your body's needs and the game's current meta's needs.

tifu,fc3ftaa,t1_fc3e6cg,1577388851.0,Well I did specify that. But I think ultimately it's still a shortage if anyone outside of a major city can't see a doctor given shortages. Not a great situation to have too many serving the big cities and none serving the surrounding or isolated communities.

Celebrate and remember and they will always be with you."
