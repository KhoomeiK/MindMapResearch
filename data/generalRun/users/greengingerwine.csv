cats,fdumyu2,t1_fdukg2w,1578735537.0,"I cannot agree more about the difficulties that couples can have conceiving. I've had friends struggle with this and losing babies mid and full term and my heart breaks for them. 

There are also plenty of ppl who choose furbabies over the semihairless variety. This can also be challenging, with the all knowing, ""you'll change your mind"" like some stranger knows your life and body better than you do. All I know is that there is nothing more fulfilling than caring for a cat, because they are contrary.. also their sharts go straight into the litter tray rather than up their back+ bedsheets."
