upcycling,ffj1emw,t3_etqqgz,1579987959.0,This looks great but it seems like you used the Jean fabric to make a jacket.. as in you deconstructed the whole thing. Still cool but not what I expected.
ZeroWaste,fficwkc,t1_ffi5p3w,1579970876.0,Thank you for the response! Can you sharpen these metal blades? I guess my confusion is that the blades are the same so was wondering why this one is diff
brooklynninenine,ffhxh1k,t1_ffhm4m2,1579958174.0,Interesting point but I think that if it's something to put on their show agenda then it gets lost. I think the reason why all the other characters are done so well is that they are characters who happen to have this trait. Captain Holt happens to be gay. Rosa happens to be bisexual. They're not making the show about that they just happen to be. It would be really difficult to write an episode with a trans positive message without it seeming like just that ... An episode with an agenda to be trans positive. Imo that would make it distasteful.
ZeroWaste,ffhx29p,t3_etjohp,1579957698.0,"Honest question, are these razors lifetime use? Do you sharpen the blade? Why does ZeroWaste like metals more than plastic when metals are also leaching resources from the planet (honest question). Is it bc metals you can use for a much longer time?"
vegetarianinstantpot,ffeik4z,t3_esylr9,1579849443.0,This looks delicious! Was it good??
Meditation,ffd4mmc,t1_ffcu6kq,1579813325.0,Oh! I very much resonate with that. I definitely don't react as much anymore and people do feel the resistance in that. Good point!
Meditation,ffcc3nn,t1_ffc06dg,1579796234.0,Interesting! I felt the opposite. When I meditate regularly I can literally feel people around me become more centered. I do however have internal struggles with myself for the stark contrast between myself and someone who is very absorbed into their phones. I just don't really escape on my phone around people anymore. I def use it a lot still tho scrolling Reddit when I'm not around people.

happycryingdads,ffb1r3f,t1_ff4pl1p,1579749621.0,Thank you for letting me know! :)
30ROCK,ffastpp,t1_ffan6cb,1579743678.0,So true! Like that scene when Jack realizes that Colleen was putting out on Christmas so that he got presents growing up.
Stepdadreflexes,fetjey1,t1_feqyg0v,1579376069.0,Sorry you didn't like it! I just meant that this person is just recording rather than untangling the kid's feet. But of course no one got hurt and it was light hearted so I get it
Stepdadreflexes,fetj15w,t1_feqkv1i,1579375947.0,Oh I totally agree! Except the kid has his legs tied which I thought was dangerous. (I meant more like untangle his legs) But I do think it was light hearted :)
Unexpected,fesv48t,t3_eqi3dl,1579369307.0,Her confidence short-circuited my brain so I had to watch it twice because this breezy act like she made it
MadeMeSmile,feqc0of,t1_fepxhi8,1579340013.0,"I think it's not fully wholesome if the kid has to do it because ""he had to learn"", not because he loves cooking. That's what makes it heartbreaking. I would love to be proven wrong tho!"
MadeMeSmile,feqbm4c,t1_fepli1b,1579339842.0,"Omggg are they not poor??? I thought this too. I was sad that this kid had to learn how to cook because of circumstances and not passion. I was sad that that the kids might have to do it for his bro because he ""has to"" not because he ""wants to."" Is this not true?? I would be happy if this was not true. Their haircuts and outfits make it seem like they're in a 3rd world country"
Meditation,feq87m9,t3_eqd51h,1579338738.0,"Sometimes I also look on YouTube hypnosis and anxiety videos. I also think the more you do meditation the less anxious you'll feel. It takes a really long time of dilligent practice but one day it'll be much easier :) and if not, reaching out to a professional is okay too!"
zen,feq6xio,t3_eq9vuw,1579338387.0,I've found meditation has been a really good source of information! I think it's because it's about the action and maybe not the theory? I have no idea

EatCheapAndHealthy,feoxfoz,t3_eq2iqm,1579307484.0,I've been eating savory oatmeal for breakfast but never thought to add VEGGIES! Duhhh
AnimalsBeingJerks,feoty07,t1_feo0avm,1579305451.0,I'm glad that's true! But I think other people are commenting on the fact that this is obviously fake because it's highly unlikely for a rat to be placed in two separate studies (not unlikely for studies that are studying similar things) and also one rat's behavior ruining an entire study makes for a pretty shitty study.

yoga,feo3tu7,t3_eq57r0,1579294723.0,"The hardest yoga class I've ever taken was one where we held hip opening poses like pigeon for like five minute, each side. I think for me it was something about letting go and sitting into the pain / stretch. Like in order to open more I had to release but it was so painful to let go to open more so I wanted to hold on. I'm just guessing but I feel like these poses you can't rely on your muscles to hold you up, you literally have to let go and sometimes letting go is so much harder. It was a really mentally and physically uncomfortable class but felt soooo good afterwards!"
AnimalsBeingJerks,fenn2sb,t1_fen8kox,1579288077.0,Except rats aren't likely to be able to participate in more than one study unless that study just includes taking blood and analyzing it for something similar.
ZeroWaste,fenk6qa,t3_eq228f,1579286449.0,That's so awesome! Hopefully it works out well for you because I know some females struggle with it. I personally love it! So much less mess in between and no more leaking while I'm sleeping. I now have to use a liner for minor minor leaks when I'm cleaning it out.
PenmanshipPorn,fengaf9,t1_fena3af,1579284052.0,I think it's still impressive because they're doing it on one go and the lines are the same thickness.
MakeupAddiction,feluuse,t1_fel15zi,1579231504.0,Omg that glitter on the bottom lid looks amazing! What a great idea
Frugal,fels4qx,t1_fel7hsg,1579229582.0,Oh I totally agree! Just a friendly reminder. Also just a reminder that oatmeal can be super cheap too
