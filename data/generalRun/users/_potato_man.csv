Have a nice day"

Don't give up! things get better"

dpdr,fcxkpm2,t3_ejdwtr,1578065292.0,"You can recover if you are serious about it. Dpdr is a coping mechanism and the best way to break one is by facing that thing you are avoiding. For me that's uncomfortable emotions, and it's probably the same for all of us. If you get used to the thing you are avoiding then the dpdr goes away. Do things that make you uncomfortable and work on accepting reality and the emotions you experience. Eat healthy, excersise and set up some goals. Step out of your comfort zone. Don't let this stupid condition break you. Good luck! You are not alone."
