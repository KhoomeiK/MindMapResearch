""I know there's no squad. My firings are the best. Squads have all these guys. Big mess. Very expensive. People say I do the best firings. From a cannon. Very efficient. No more body to take to the dead people hospital. Hillary wants to take our cannons. Terrible. Terrible."""

australia,ffasmbe,t1_ffapozk,1579743543.0,"Every criticism I've seen of the Red Cross has been for the American arm, in response to specific disasters over there. Is there anything they've done in Australia that I should know about?"
melbourne,ffaqlbb,t1_ffa5iab,1579742178.0,I saw lots of people dressed in minimal clean white for the tennis get a good soaking. The laundromats are going to do a good trade today.

comics,ffahrld,t1_ffagaui,1579736034.0,Shere Khan was also supposed to be weak. He hunted soft targets because of his lame leg. I think Scar is actually a pretty good match because they both compensated for physical limitations with a ruthless will to dominate the other animals.
comics,ffah7ux,t1_ffaecu3,1579735672.0,Now I'm surprised that I've never seen a movie about a hungry group of tigers just picking off an unfortunate squabble of humans.

keto,fewi0oj,t3_e0eld4,1579410933.0,"This is a really great video for understanding what the real relationship is between LDL and heart disease. I was going to post it here after finding during research into my mother's heart medication. I wasn't looking for low-carb guidance, but here we are.

I'm not sure if this is enough to recommend keto to combat heart disease in her case (she has comlicating liver issues), but it's good to know that there may be alternatives to statins, which are hitting her hard with the side effects right now."

The halberd is clearly a superior weapon."
