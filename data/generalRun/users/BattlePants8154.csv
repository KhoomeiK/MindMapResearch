memes,ffjkuyd,t3_etwap9,1580000548.0,"I've been to Omaha Beach in Normandy once with my grandparents one summer while my parents were on a cruise. Me and my brother liked WW1 and WW2 stuff so we enjoyed it until our grandmother talked to us about her church (my grandparents are south protestant and my family are mormon and those two religions don't get along very well) and how her church prayed like every day during WW2 at the church for the soldiers and they even had a flag for everyone that lived in that town that got drafted and some empty box underneath it. While we were on the beach, my grandmother took out this ziploc bag and picked up a bunch of sand with it to put in that box under the flag they had at their church. We all looked at her like she was crazy and when she hid the ziploc bag in her purse or whatever, she had this face you'd imagine a child would have when they realize they just did something bad and need to hide it from their parents. I kinda regret not telling her to put the sand back because we all just had this feeling that she broke the law or something."

I can bet at least one person will reply to this with some shit like ""oH yOuRe JuSt In HiGh ScHoOl YoU sHoUlDnT wOrRy AbOuT tHiS sTuFf"" but I'll just comment it anyway because I have nothing better to do.

For a little context, I've moved around a couple different high schools (I'm in my third high school in my junior year) and I've kinda always wanted a girlfriend but didn't take it seriously until around freshman/8th grade year. When I look back on it, I've only really liked girls for how they look before this year and this year I've really only considered a girl's personality before I decided I liked her this year. Her birthday is pretty soon so I wanted to get somewhere with her sometime soon. There is also prom this year and this is my first chance to go to prom since this is my junior year and I really wanted to take this girl to prom. Just today I talked to someone and they asked me who I like and when I told them, they said that the girl I like is their ex and they said that she was very manipulative and pretty much the complete opposite of how I thought she would be like. I've actually talked to her this year, more than any one of my other crushes and I had not expected this at all, she never seemed to be like the kind of person to do that. I've been asking a lot of people I know to help me build up confidence to ask her out because I was really stressed about asking her out.

Well that doesn't exactly answer the question but that's pretty much everything that's happened lately that's really got me down"
