offmychest,fgglgm2,t3_exza7r,1580764335.0,I have pretty much the same obsession with medieval fantasy in video games and books. All the titles you named and then some more. I'm 26 and my nerdiness never embarrasses me. You'd be surprised how many people out there are just like this.
offmychest,fg8ba1o,t3_exb9qq,1580614536.0,Absolutely agree
AskMen,fg89oxo,t3_exd3so,1580613299.0,"I've never felt guilty about being lazy so I guess the question doesn't apply to me.

""Why is patience a virtue? Why can't hurry the fuck up be a virtue?""

Just replace 'patience' and 'hurry the fuck up' with laziness and productivity. Same idea."
offmychest,fg8909h,t1_fg7g9yf,1580612766.0,"This. Exactly this. If I see people on the train wearing a face mask I'm going to assume you're sick and avoid you. It has literally nothing to do with race or nationality.

Very uncommon here in the US at least."

ARKSurvivalEvolved,fg7ftwd,t3_exagz4,1580591471.0,Sometimes you quit and re load the game and you get moved slightly and it fixes things. Also try punching untill you pass out. When you fall down you move a little as well.
offmychest,fg5iqm7,t1_fg5fpvh,1580528576.0,"The whole world is covered in germs. And what if I also don't flush? Yellow let it mellow? Brown flush it down?

Saves water. I've got 58 sick hours accrued at work - not sick often. I'll be alright, I hope :P"
offmychest,fg5dm3a,t3_ewum8x,1580524676.0,"I don't always wash if I only went pee.  Sometimes I wash anyways. But sometimes not. Dont touch the junk, and pee at an angle that eliminates splash. I'll be fine, assuming I'm not cooking or eating anything."
unpopularopinion,fg5ccvn,t3_ewtnl1,1580523757.0,"I totally get that point you're trying to make, but hell you don't know me. I speak two languages as well.

I'm within my rights to sit here and think ""Dam that tourist shoild have studied English more""... especially if we are failing to communicate simple ideas.

I'm not saying they're dumb either. It's just a language barrier. There are hundreds of different languages in this world - by no means can any individual learn them all."

unpopularopinion,fe6854q,t1_fe67rnh,1578883891.0,Had what was probably an 8 year old try to sell me cocaine - persistently - in Costa Rica. Found it really concerning how young he was.

ARKSurvivalEvolved,fdnuuwf,t3_em9vvg,1578593308.0,"Admin command 'gcm' works fine but you can also enable a setting that will make it show up on pause screen.

Hit 'Host/Local' from the start screen. Scroll down untill you find 'show creative mode' in the general settings tab. It's the very last option. Good luck!"
