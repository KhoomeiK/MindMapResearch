MySummerCar,fehcciz,t1_feg4new,1579113643.0,"Exactly! It's like the game always wants you to be stranded when the car breaks, even though IRL, there should be ways to get it running enough to get home so you can fix it.  Things like driving a car without a starter for two weeks or having synchros that are so worn you have to double clutch for some gears are what makes Jalopy ownership so fun. You have a unique ability to drive your car, when no one else can."
MySummerCar,fefnc78,t1_fef9xhh,1579060082.0,"So the game allows you to run the engine without a piston, but you can't push start the car if the starter fails? This game is weird..."

ADHD,fefgy1l,t3_eonxi7,1579056098.0,"Yeah, I do feel like this sometimes. Often I'll achieve something and then beat myself up for not achieving the same thing when I was younger. For example, I recently finished a 1500 line Excel Macro program that groups test results into categories and highlights problem areas. Soon after I'd done it I thought ""I wish I'd done something like this when I started learning Visual Basic at 16...""

I apologise if I'm boasting here, but I really want to feel like it was a worthwhile achievement, and a little boasting is one way that I can get a taste of that."

RetroFuturism,fef7a9a,t3_eoqzno,1579049862.0,"Why spherical though? Wouldn't it be a more efficient use of the space to make it cylindrical. Also it would be more stable in it's final position since it can't just roll in any direction.

Actually, why not ditch the the idea of rolling the whole house, and instead make it a long cuboidal structure that has wheels, which you can use to load it onto a trailer and transport it cross country. You would then set it down on a platform that raises it off the temporary wheels and anchors it to the ground in its final desired place.

Wait, I think I just invented the mobile home..."

aww,fe3euc5,t1_fe3bx7v,1578848658.0,"No, but we have to focus other strategies as well. We need to stop deluding ourselves that we can somehow stop climate change or reverse it. Now, we must focus on creating the most accurate models that we can, and figure out what damage will be caused, and how we can minimise the losses caused by it.

We still need some mitigation, if only to buy us enough time that it doesn't wipe out our entire species before we have time to prepare ourselves. However the majority of our efforts should be focused on preparation."
