cyclothymia,ffhc14z,t3_eoxmci,1579929394.0,"Not sure if I am cyclothymic, but I definitely struggle with the low. I lose motivation, I get irritable, isolate myself, become suicidal etc. I can sort of survive, but it's getting worse and worse, to the point where I could barely function, also my anxiety is pretty bad and got me paranoid about my own body and health (the weirdest thing was being hyperaware of my body and feeling like I was trapped behind my eyes).

My highs are great. It's where I feel the best. The only problem is that I tend to organize too much and do too much, to the point of injury. And then I crash because I am exhausted."
cyclothymia,ffhbrdb,t1_ffhaxa9,1579929125.0,"I definitely understand. I always refused medications, and taking seroquel actually gave me spikes of anxiety (every single time). 

I stopped for the dumbest reason ever. First of all, I was taking it for anxiety and my physical symptoms (panic, continuous tremors, spasms) disappeared so I could live normally, but also I was starting to feel okay and I was convinced that the seroquel was tampering with my hypomania, and because I wanted to feel hypomanic I stopped taking. Clearly, I was wrong. My mood is on suicidal low now, ops.

It made me sleepy, but honestly, if this is what I have to take to not feel like I am going to die, I will probably start taking it again as soon as I see my doctor and pass it by them.

Also one of the reasons for my hesitating is because I am not convinced I am bipolar or cyclothymic, so I keep thinking that I should look into other meds or just wait it out. What a psychologist told me was to not think too much about it, if it works it means that it's doing something good."
patientgamers,ffh96da,t1_fdh60o7,1579926727.0,"The dialogue and characters interactions are definitely the best part of TLJ. The lore was so weird, dreamlike, which was fitting. Admittedly, I didn't cry but probably because I rarely cry while playing videogames or reading books, but it broke my heart. 

I am not good at puzzles so I found Dreamfall easier, even if I never understood why they did that to April's character.

And I actually liked Dreamfall Chapters a lot. Definitely another kind of game, but there I admit, I did cry, because elderly Saga remembering her family pulled all my strings. Still, part of the last game (especially Zoe's part in Stark) was generally boring and it took me a while to get into it."
cyclothymia,ffh7zya,t3_etjujb,1579925715.0,"Not sure if it is placebo, but I took seroquel for ten days, and after day 5 I started feeling much better (okay happy, not depressed, not anxious) and I was taking the minimum dose. It also made me extremely sleepy and sleep for 12 hours, so maybe it was just an effect of all that sleep?

Still I only started to feel very hungry by day 9, more or less. But I think it can also cause lose of weight (so maybe lack of appetite?).

Like all medications, it may have side effects, it's all a trade off. It shouldn't be prescribed for sleeping disorders because there are other options in that case. To me, it was prescribed for panic and because I am cyclothymic, so my doctor didn't feel safe prescribing other medications. 

Also, I am in a similar situation. I am not sure if I have cyclothymia or bipolar or who knows what and seeing a psychiatrist soon to check.What they told me is that seroquel acts on depression and anxiety, independently from the possible depression/bipolar/cyclothymya or who knows what underneath, the most important thing is that you are feeling better. So if it is working, it's good!"

Regarding feeling disconnected, the whole Zoe in Stark with amnesia was really boring to me, especially because it never went anywhere. I would have preferred her to be in Stark for some reason and actually actively trying to do something. I much preferred Kian's parts,at the beginning, and Zoe's parts as soon as she gets involved in Arcadia. I really enjoyed Zoe at the end and the foreshadowed twist!"

thelongestjourney,ff4u1cq,t3_eraev1,1579572437.0,"Other addendum things:

- Helena might have been able to create Zoe because of the Stark / Arcadia division? Lux seemed to prefer residing in Stark and maybe the Lux we see is sort of in half, and it's only fitting that Stark users science to get a dreamer. 

- Not sure what was the point of the dividing of world in the first place. Maybe it's connected with Lux losing his soul stone originally? Like, worlds cannot stay together well because he's not whole? And now that he has it back the reunification can happen. Or maybe it's connected to some personal shit Lux was going through? Also I like to see Lux in Arcadia more as an avatar of the originally dreamer being.

- because they wanted to have another game and April, I wonder if it would have been with April playing a role in the unification. Because of how popular April is, I guess they would have wanted her and not Saga, so maybe Saga could have dragged April into it and then erased her memories somehow? Or maybe we would have had a re-division of April and Saga as two? Like one acting in the real worlds, and the other acting more like a soul in storytime? 

- also not sure how Brian managed to go to storytelling, and if all worlds are created by dreamers or of its only one of the methods to create universes

- this white dragon thing is very confusing, so for my peace of mind she is officially dead even if of course her kin is around, so maybe she reincarnated into one of her daughters somewhere. Not sure if the other dragons see all dead, but I think I've read somewhere that the blue dragon is more like silenced than dead."
thelongestjourney,ff4sv1w,t1_ff49pb9,1579571633.0,"Thank you!
I've read somewhere that hovering machines were around before the collapse but, as Zoe explains in the second game, man never flew without wings again.
I think someone added that this could mean that the almost crashing of Stark and Arcadia in game one, with the attempt to bring chaos (magic = chaos) let people use hovering technology in Stark. When the Balance was restored the Collapse happened because the hovering magic/tech was not available anymore (and maybe other pseudo magical things that Stark was starting to use). Which is why the collapse is only felt in Stark and happens when April disappears.

Also things i forgot to add: April's parents are unknown so she is a dragon kin because maybe she is originally from Arcadia."

I feel amazing, when it happens, but I know it happens differently for different people.

I am slightly afraid that my hyper period this month was the anxiety breakdown, I hope not. I feel like I am owed my hyper happy period if I have to suffer through these lows."
cyclothymia,fdsm815,t1_fdqfmej,1578705025.0,"I think I can definitely manage hypomania, if that's what it is, but the low periods are worse and worse, and my anxiety has reached physiological debilitating levels. 
I think the seroquel was given to me because it's an anti anxiety and that was the symptom my doctor was mostly trying to fix, to make me feel like I was not dying every second of the day, and being seroquel it should not drive bipolar based illnesses into mania/hypomania. 
I feel like no one of the doctors I've visited (two) knew what was going on and what to do. This doctor prescribed seroquel to me, but she admitted that she had no idea what to give for cyclothymia."

cyclothymia,fdsli48,t1_fdsh26z,1578704732.0,"The thing I mostly doubt is that during the ""hypomania"" I am me but better. I can make big plans, start new hobbies, work for hours and hours, obsess over health and exercises, which should be good for me etc. I found it manageable, and then my mood would slowly start to descend. What I don't find manageable is the long depression and the anxiety.

Oh boy, over planning during high and then crashing into depression is exactly what I do too, and exactly what happened to me the last time. I ended up working more than 100 hours a week and the stress landed me in an increasingly low mood. 

I never considered it could be both ADD and cyclothymia. I think I might ask for a new referral for a new psychiatrist."

italy,fdglsj6,t3_ekzaqq,1578401621.0,"1) Mi sembra una di leggere quelle cose che avrei potuto scrivere nell'apice della mia ipomania. Prima di tutto, non e' detto che migliorare le condizioni lavorative migliorino la tua depressione. Sono quella che da fuori potrebbe essere considerata di medio successo (vivo all'estero, vengo pagata per fare qualcosa che mi permette di decidere le mie ore ed e' anche la mia passione e il mio sogno e mi pagano anche viaggi per conferenze, sono riuscita a risparmiare molto, non sono particolarmente preoccupata del non trovare un prossimo lavoro con anche una paga migliore qui e sono piu' che pronta a cambiare di nuovo continente etc.), credo, ma ti assicuro che se la depressione e' clinica non se ne va piu' la mia vita migliora, ed e' cosi' per moltissime persone. Non sono mai stata cosi' tendente al suicidio come all'apice del mio lavoro, che e' anche la passione della mia vita.

Inoltre, tutti hanno le stesse esperienze o vengono dallo stesso luogo. E' ovvio che ""la vita e' dura"" e' applicabile a tutti e arrendersi significa suicidio, quindi direi di evitarlo. Ma tra vivere e suicidio c'e' di mezzo il mare.

2.  I boomer, vabbhe'. Non ho nemmeno idea di cosa siano, so solo che la generazione dei miei genitori e' vissuta in un periodo di crescita economica ed ha avuto opportunita' che molte persone ora non hanno, specialmente per quanto riguarda iniziare una famiglia da giovani. E' la generazione dei miei nonni che e' cresciuta nella fame e sotto il fascismo.

Inoltre non so cosa intendi per bambagia. Non e' certo un campione assoluto, ma la maggior parte del mio circolo di amici in Italia ha iniziato a lavorare alle superiori ed ha continuato a lavorare all'universita' o ha cercato subito un lavoro dopo le superiori.

3) Non conosco nessuno di questi giovani che vogliono tutto e subito, sinceramente, non so come siano i tuoi amici, ma devi anche considerare che ogni cosa e' biased, quindi sia quelli che conosci tu che quelli che conosco io non rappresentano adeguatamente la maggior parte dei giovani, probabilmente. Ho trent'anni e conosco un sacco di gente che ha studiato e lavorato e messo da parte sogni per prendersi cura della propria famiglia, o per risparmiare abbastanza da iniziare una loro famiglia. Un posto di lavoro non retribuito e' una cattiva esperienza. Un posto di lavoro non retribuito non e' un posto di lavoro, punto, e automaticamente esclude una fetta di popolazione.

Alcune persone non possono scegliere tra 800 e 1200. Non e' una questione di volere tutto subito, e' una questione di responsabilita'. Io mi sono potuta permettere di trasferirmi e di accettare una bassa paga per iniziare un percorso che mi piaceva, ma non avrei mai potuto permettermi di accettare un posto non retribuito, specialmente se in un'altra citta'."
