while it's not technically ""ramp""  as it only tutors to hand,  it presents a range of options.   T1 or as an early drop,  it tends to ""draw"" you anywhere from 9-15 cards out of your deck (i often draw all my basic plains if i field it early)

bestof,fffjgaw,t1_fffbmd1,1579885269.0,"ascribing any human quality to an animal is stupid.      --setting aside the idea humans are ""wired wrong""  is probably also a stupid way to think about mental health.  


going from  ""we don't know why an animal does this""  to  that animal is insane.   is ridiculous.    


insanity,  is a human quality,  it is impossible for an animal to be insane,  psychotic, or a sociopath.    Because it is also impossible for an animal to comprehend or express a human understanding of morality or ethics.      A human is deemed insane when they are so mentally ill as to not have a grip on reality.   legally speaking, you are insane if you do not have the capacity to know right from wrong, or that your actions were illegal.    A dog,  can never have that foundation of ""understanding"" to begin with.

EDH,fffi1xg,t3_et915q,1579884419.0,"while not the same as your deck here is my twins list... focused on goad/combat control nonsense  [https://deckstats.net/decks/122221/1510132-super-twins-combat-control/en](https://deckstats.net/decks/122221/1510132-super-twins-combat-control/en)   


looking at your list.   i'd consider that your ramp... might be a little  weak.   seems like 9 total mana rocks.   but... 4 of those are over 3 cmc.   and traveler's amulet  isn't technically ramp as it is fetch to hand.     fellwar stone,  arcane signet,  izzet signet, or the UR talisman would be good additions.     chromatic lantern,  and darksteel ingot... are needlessly high cmc  for meh value.   worn power stone... i dunno.  I think i would go with hedron archive if you wanted to go up the big mana tree.   the upside of potential card draw.   and being able to use it right away... vs  3 mana etb tapped of worn power stone.    


34 lands is also low.  for a deck piloted by 2   high cmc generals  


i'd even say... some of your removal is wonky.   the bounce to hand stuff... is kinda meh.  the frogify.   dunno if that's a budget choice,  or what.  but...    reality shift,  chaos warp,  seem to be notable omissions.      


aside from that... some of the cards seem a bit meh.   the two enchants.  circle of flame, and drowned secrets.  seems really meh.   i saw like 1 other mill card.  the ... if my lib has 20 cards,  draw 3   ...i dunno.  even that is weak.   if you're not a mill deck,   lose both the mill cards,   and the ... red dinger enchant.    


I think the single red... snatch a creature under 3 cmc  is kinda bad.   you're just not likely to net much value from the spell.    some of your other theft type spells.  switcheroo, the fae spell,  malevalent whispers.   I don't know if they're good or bad,  my instinct is they're all slightly over costed.   or meh.   I'd look at like... brion stout arm theft lists.  to see the best red theft options.   and i dunno... a blue theft deck,  to see the best blue options.      


There's also cards like Torbran,  which,  i question why you're running it?    if your deck was more pinger/dinger  sure.   but what is really benefitting you with this?    


i guess in general.    consider,   what exactly your deck is trying to do.   you've got some proliferate.  planeswalkers.   some spellslinger/token stuff,  some of this theft stuff,   the oddball one or two off mill cards.  some dinger cards.    


my advice.   pick like... 2.   if you want the spell slinger stuff,  go with that.  tokens, spells, spell value.   planeswalkers that help tokens,  more token producers,  bigger token-ish threats.    some more spell recursion, spell doubling stuff.        


if you lean on spells and tokens,  this opens up.  maybe... some sacrifice potential.   you want mill... run the altar that mills.   or like... theft.   run some theft spells.  and some sac outlets (goblin bombardment as an example... or ashnod's for mana).  skullclamp.  etc.    


OR could pair  theft,  with dinger strategies.  OR tokens with etb slug...  it doesn't matter what you focus on,  but  focusing on one or two things.  or one main thing,  and one subtheme.  tends to enable a deck to be more focused."
CafeRacers,fffd27r,t3_et5cpr,1579881286.0,"if you don't know how to ride a motorcycle.   start there.      taking the time to do a project bike before you know how to ride is silly.    you'll have zero frame of reference.    And if you go fucking with the weight and geometry of a bike,  could lead to issues for an inexperienced rider.   same for...really old shitty 1970's  brakes,  or suspension.    


that being said.    it kinda depends on what bike you get.   I'd go with a japanese bike.   one of the big names.  honda, kawi,  suzuki etc    avoid european bikes,  or even... harleys.   (although dunno if anyone turns harleys into cafe bikes)    


doing some research on common platforms should direct you to the types of bikes people most frequently turn into cafe racer bikes.  There's a reason for this.   availability...  of the bikes,  of parts,  of after market parts,     ease of converting the stock bike into a cafe bike.    and reliability of the engine.    


If you're buying something to ride.  make sure it runs.    Can not stress this enough.   if you have no skills,  buying something that does not start is a dice roll.     


If you're purely looking for a project,  buy as cheap a pile as possible.    


there is a double edged sword sorta problem with buying someone else's project.   On the one hand... profit from their stupidity,   if they've done some work,  or bought some additional stuff,  this might save you some work.   On the other hand,  you're buying someone else's failure.   If they've chopped the frame,   fucked with the wiring/electrical,   removed parts you're not aware of.   Done some really shitty jerry rig for some crucial component  it may be hard to figure all that out.  IE you're just buying someone else's problems.     Also the issue of some idiot,  thinks they put hoop on the back of a bike and an ebay cafe seat... now a shitty ujm  is magically worth 10k.      hard pass on that shit.    


The sweet spot,  is a decent bike... someone is desperate to get rid of.   If it's running,  all the better,  but a clean bike,  sat in someone's garage, they never got around to.    See if they'll take a lowball offer.      get in for cheap.   


realize it's a pricey hobby.    if you buy a non-running old bike,  will you have to pay to tow it?   do you have space to store it?   Plenty of things can be cheap,  but other things can be pricey,  how much you dump into a bike varies a lot.      Major engine work,  any machine work,  or things of that nature can get really pricey.   fancy named brand mods ...your cognito moto,  m-unit  hipster type shit.  can tack hundreds if not thousands onto a price of a build.   


as far as what to learn.  don't worry about that until you pick a bike.   I think most common are the honda CB  bikes.   If i had to guess in the dark,  they are the most popular,  most frequently showcased on youtube videos and there's tons and tons of info (entire forums dedicated to old CBs,   facebook groups,  etc etc)and stuff on them on the after market            


the knowledge will come.  regarding engines.     i'm a big fan of aim small miss small.   just dig into it.  watch youtube videos,  read ...tinker with your bike.   do an oil change.  know how to change spark plugs.  know how the electrical of a bike works.... get a grip on the basics of the electrics  (how the stator - reg/rec  feed the battery,  how the always on power,  grounds,  the various relays and whatnot.   get like an overview of these bits)   Understand about maintaining the chain.   How to set it's tension,  clean it,  lube it.   How to change a tire,  balance a tire... know if your rubber is worn out.     If it's a carbuerated bike... get real comfortable taking a carb off,  taking it apart and cleaning it,  research how to tune a carb.     if you buy a carbed bike,  and mod a bike into a cafe racer  you're going to need to be on pretty intimate terms with your carb  


you don't need to know all this immediately,   but you can take baby steps.  do the easy fixes,  maint things, to spend time with the bike and engine.   learn how it works.   get a wrench on a bike.     


as far as tools.     


a set of sockets.    typically will need a few larger wrenches  24-25 mm for the rear axl nut,  or like the one oddball big bolts on the bike.  but a reg socket set... with like the sorta standard 4-12 mm or whatever comes in those common sets.   start there.    But start with the set.  buy the one or two bigger wrenches as you need them  


allen keys.  depending on the age of the bike,  what type of hardware it uses.  this may also be necessary.        On older japanese bikes  (i think the 70's era and earlier) they use a special  japanese industrial standard type of screw head.   IF you have an older bike... buy a set of JIS screwdrivers.  it will save you tones of stripped screws          --obviously if your bike doesn't use these,  they're not necessay  (although allen keys maybe more so if you add new components)  


a multimeter,  and or a light tester.    A multimeter is a great tool.  don't have to go nuts buying a super expensive one.   a $20 one off amazon is prob fine.    This allows you all sorts of flexibility in testing/troubleshooting electrical stuff.     Is your battery being charged properly?   does this wire make a circuit?     


a gizmo to pull a spark plug.    and a tire pressure gauge           


possibly a torque wrench.    i found,  just start with good habits.  read about using a torque wrench and tightening things to spec.  and just get in the habit of it.     Most people are just lazy about this,  but honestly.   it doesn't take any more effort to grab a torque wrench...   vs lock tite-ing everything because you're a lazy prat  


that would be some of my bare bones tools.          I think also.   some penetrating oil,  and carb/brake cleaner,  are handy to have.      I also found i used calipers somewhat regularly.  my old bike had a lot of miss matched bolts.  that were smaller than spec.   So... i eventually swapped all the bolts to newer ones.   but i found i liked having the calipers.      


you can buy cheapo welders,   buy a hand held angle grinder,    I found a wire brush head for a drill ...to sort of ""clean""  the metal areas on some parts... helpful    ...metal work tends to require it's own tools.  hammers,  clamps, files,  the actual welding gear.   discs and pads for grinders.   sand paper.  etc etc etc  


but again... how deep do you want to get right away.     Some things you'd need to weld.  a rear hoop.  or cowl.   there's plenty of ready made items available.    


but... if you wanna go hog wild,   just educate yourself.  watch some youtube content from actual welders or fabricators (the sort of hobbyist bike builders... eh  they rarely do it like the pros)  practice on something disposable first.    several times (sheet metal/some tube steel... is pretty cheap... fucking up your frame isn't)  


but like i said... better to start small.   like... really simple.    Take the chain guard protector thing off.   the exposed chain look.  ups the silly ""badass"" factor a solid 10 points.    If it's an older bike.  can swap the old clunky 70's  blinkers and rear light,  for smaller less clunky options,   this will give you a little exp with wiring.    Watch some youtube videos about doing a fender tidy.   attempt that.     clean the bike.    like...seriously.   buy some cleaning products,  go to town cleaning it.   they make polish products for metal,  whatever.  shine up your new baby.      Don't ignore safety features.     ...want an early maint project.   learn how to bleed brakes.  do that.   check if the brake pads need changing.     learn out to check your bikes sag.    maybe replace the rear shocks.    Change the tires.      this will require a lot of taking things apart.   having to support the bike.   various tasks,   they don't seem big,   but they put time on your bike with tools.    take the carb apart.  buy a carb kit.    clean the ever loving fuck out of the carb, and rebuild it.      Replace the chain and sprocket set.    if these are old.   just replace them... this is another task that tends to require some taking shit apart.   so is a good exercise in getting hands on with your bike  


ie... don't go out and immediately buy a lame 4 into 1 exhaust,  and chop the rear section off the bike.     


but then again.   do what you want."

so glad you have rogue decks in your format.         where you can play.. combo in mono green,  or mono blue, and choose between infinite turns combo,   or infinite mana combo,  or draw my entire deck combo.     or play godo,  and win off a combo  ...or run najeela, and play combat combo.   running 3 warriors.  Or a lands matter deck... that combos by dropping tons of lands once valakut is out?    

or you can play Stax ...that might combo late game because everyone is about ready to stab their eyes out the game is so boring at that point

would you say  98% of decks are combo.   or 99% of decks involve combo?       

i have several friends who play cEDH.   i have decks that would reach to the lvl of cEDH.  I've piloted several of the top tier cEDH decks. I even have my own shitty rogue brew cEDH deck for when i'm drunk enough to let my friend talk me into playing cEDH because they can't get a pod together....  even tried for awhile to put up with the people who played cEDH at my LGS because a close friend hard sold me on the format...saying it was so much fun to play magic at it's most pure... blah blah blah

   same with my friends who play legacy,  who purport legacy to be this lovely free brewers paradise,  and then legacy events are... top 4  meta decks that stabilize over rogue brews,  and crush events when you average out the variance.      cEDH is defined by rapid combo along narrow win cons.  yes.. i know cEDH has a cute little deck database site now.   but i highly doubt,  much really has shifted in terms of which decks are truly the best.   

and if your format is so unique and varied,   it can stand on it's own. because regardless of how many cute rogue brews you guys have now.   None of them are really appropriate matched up against anything other than decks of a similar caliber.     

 So i don't see your real beef.  

i also don't see why cEDH people are so defensive.   you feel the need to try and ""well actually""  me about it.    I play a fair bit of magic,   i know a decent amt about cEDH.   I personally don't care for it,  or play it.   But y'all are entitled to your little variant.   

but pretending it's not a narrow.  combo centric format,  is silly."

EDH,ffd07ck,t1_ffcxnyw,1579810845.0,"cEDH operates outside the philosophical parameters of EDH.  

it's EDH  only in that it's 99 card singleton with the color identity restrictions.  

same as 1v1  is EDH  and french or canadian highlander are EDH.   


cEDH doesn't play in a sandbox that at all allows it to play alongside any other normal EDH deck.   

saying cEDH is ""edh""   like it's anything other than a variant,   is insulting to anyone who's played both.   

pretending it's not different,  is an attempt to glom onto the legitimacy of regular EDH.    while exploiting the social contract of the regular format.   instead of standing on their own... and making their own ban list or rule set.      And now cEDH is venting this toxic attitude toward the rules committee, using troll tactics to harass the regular EDH forum.    and the general EDH community because they don't want to have their own format that has to justify it's existence(to LGS and GPs),  without that option to mooch off of EDH's popularity.  


simple reality is.  Flash is not an issue for EDH.   it's an issue for cEDH.     the rules committee has indicated it's not willing to maintain separate ban lists,   or target cards specifically for cEDH because it's seen as a narrow variant that falls outside the purview of the goals/standard of EDH rules committee and it's ban list

flexibility exists within the confines of actual EDH   ...rule zero.   to handle this situation.       but cEDH players aren't happy with that.  because again,  this would require their community to police itself,  and own up to the fact that it requires special consideration to function.   because it is so outside the norm for regular EDH"
EDH,ffcvzeq,t1_ffct4cu,1579808413.0,"didn't call EDH narrow,  I called cEDH a narrow format

how is it a stretch?    it takes 10s of thousands of cards.   and constricts it to a narrow range of generals,  and similar combo wincons?   the only metric is winning.   people don't play or pick their generals based on anything other than what those cards offer in terms of colors or combo potential?   

combat is not a viable strategy in their format.      

think of all the archetypes that are not viable. tribal,  group hug,  political,  pillowfort, chaos,  lands matter,  even the kess ""storm"" decks aren't really spell slinger storm,  so much as they're combo to lab man decks.  

most spells over 3 cmc are not viable in their format (outside of combo pcs)  like... you're not running a misc good stuff 4 drop.   you're sure as fuck not running a misc cool 6 drop.  

several decks... of the very narrow range of actually competitive decks,  win using similar combos.   so not only is the viability of general restricted to overall CMC and flexible colors enabling combo.   several of the limited options... devolve into the exact same.. lab man/fishbowl ...scepter/bsz type wincons.  

the frequency of decks with the exact same cards is near total.   ie... every deck with access to blue,  will run a high percentage of the exact same blue cards.  this is largely true... of all the other colors.   the only slight variant being which wincon combo aspect they win off of.    Because the format only cares about power lvl of a card.   there is no room for personalization or self expression,  otherwise.  you're building a sub optimal deck,  and therefor at a drastic disadvantage.    (the najeela lists often times run only like 2 warriors)

so... narrow range of viable generals to use.  near forced adoption of sultai colors.  

narrow range of optimal spells to use

narrow range of efficient combo win cons/stax elements to present win cons

narrow range of overall supported archetypes.   utter and total elimination of many strategies or archetypes.   

even with cards with seemingly clear flavor elements.   say... najeela running 2 warriors.  Zur.   running only 3-4 enchantments.  tazri running 2-3 allys....    There is not even any uniqueness to those decks"

if someone thinks nature is the same.  they're a moron.    even in an environment where most things are similar,  the simple act of moving along means the scenery changes.   i've seen little streams/brooks be the most picturesque and beautiful things on a trail,  even though i've crossed dozens and dozens of them.     one tiny rock cairn...some trendy moron built.  can be beautiful.     The grand freaking canyon...  most likely will not disappoint.    


if you want to get into hiking/camping.  start small.   budget allowing.   consider your big 3.   backpack,  sleep system,  shelter.    There is tons of information out there.  budget alternatives.  hiker trash hacks to save money.    fancy new tech.   It all depends on your comfort and budget.     


I advocate on keeping things light.   and spending money on hiking specific stuff.  nice trail runner shoes.   morino wool socks/base layers.  fabrics made for the outdoors.  a solid rain shell.  etc.      i have a tiny $15 stove off amazon, weighs next to nothing.  I spent the extra money on a $30 titanium cook pot.   my entire ""cooking"" setup fits in a little bag,  and weights next to nothing.   Get on youtube or google.  start checking out some content.    


but... when you start getting some gear.  go on little test runs.   go to a state park, that has nice... safe.  easy going camping spots.  little fire pits, or tent pads.   maybe you'll only be like 10 feet from a big honking RV camper.   but... gives you a chance to test setting up your tent,  cooking,  comfort of your clothes/sleeping bag.     getting use to the dark,  noises of the outdoors.     using the bathroom outdoors etc etc.    


then... maybe reach out.  get into a community.   see if any local stores or groups offer any outings.   It's hard to just find new friends for new hobbies.   put yourself out there, rely on other people who have more experience and knowledge.

i would imagine that there were a lot of issue.   And a lot of stress and pressure... right at the holidays.     then... if you consider,  what would be a reasonable time to wait?

say.. the deadline was what?  dec 6th?     even if everyone sent out packages by that deadline(i sent my deck out nearly a week late),  there would need to be a week or so,  of just normal shipping allowance.   then... maybe another week to two weeks just to make sure some sort of normal shipping delay or post office fuckery wasn't the issue(maybe more because it is Xmas).     now consider that... those 2-3 weeks.  is effectively Christmas,  and i dunno about you,  but basically thanksgiving to new years is a cluster fuck of travel, deadlines, work nonsense, family stress, and whatnot.

so... after those first 2-3 weeks,  they maybe sorta know there's an issue, then... do you reach out to the person on file who was supposed to send?   how long do you wait on that?   if you have an ""elf"" or person just willing to send an additional deck,  or blindly send a deck with no expectation of getting one.      ....is that another week to two weeks?  to wait for that to be sure it's not just a shipping issue?

I have a sevala heart of the wilds ""bro-storm""   list.     it's pretty powerful.   as i understand it.  it's basically tier 2 ish from a cEDH perspective.  meaning it's worthless in an actual cEDH meta..because then i'm only really relying on the budget of my opponents not to have brought actual T1 cEDH decks.  which my deck can't really win against except by cheese.  

the deck decimates almost any other power range of decks,  because it has near 90% chance to get it's general online before turn 3,   and can storm off and win the game  with multiple combo lines,  as early as T2.   typically turn 3  and something like 75%  math odds by turn 4.    barring interruption.    even if the combo line i take involves combat,  the deck does not need to interact via the combat phase.   and it's other more aggressive combos can eliminate all player resources,  and win a number of non-combat was (mill loops via memory jar for example)

this deck is not an EDH deck.   it's a cEDH deck.     my edgar deck... which i consider on the higher end of ""casual""  can not compete against my selvala deck.  because inherently my edgar deck relies on combat to win,  it is inherently weaker.   

i feel cEDH is not EDH  for multiple reasons.   I think you could easily make a rule stating,  any deck that wins via combo or some form of loop,  before turn 6  is a competitive deck,  and not playable in a regular EDH pod.   

that's just my opinion.   i know the butthurt wails of combo losers would drown out the sun if that became a rule.   but... this idea you couldn't seperate the formats is stupid.  

I'm not conflating anything.  cEDH played amoungst themselves as a sep format is perfectly fine.  cEDH decks mixed in with regular EDH is abusive and exploitative of the social contract and general rules of EDH as a format

you angry cEDH people... seem to forget there are several other lines of txt on that EDH philosophy section of the RC site.   

this toxic attitude that the suggestion of a rule 0 solution is impossible,  only highlights just how separate cEDH should be.       

The goal of the ban list is similar; it does not seek to regulate competitive play or power level, which are decisions best left to individual play groups. The ban list seeks to demonstrate which cards threaten the positive player experience at the core of the format or prevent players from reasonable self-expression.

flash does not threaten the play experience of the core of EDH,   doesn't not inhibit reasonable self-expression.  

as cEDH is an entirely arbitrary self imposed restriction towards hyper aggressive combo victories.    the format is not operating within the bounds of what the ban list is meant to address.

EDH,ffc73ye,t1_ffc108i,1579793066.0,"the rules committee has indicated they will not ban cards solely on account of cEDH

this is because the underlying sentiment is,  is that cEDH is not the same as regular EDH      ...it operates outside the mission statement of the rules committee for what EDH is.

the explanations of people who don't acknowledge this simple starting point,  is pointless to argue further    

flash is not a problem for the vast majority of EDH players.     so... unlike say.  Paradox engine.   which became ubiquitous and non-fun to play against.   Flash is not an issue for EDH

it is an issue for cEDH players.  a tiny fraction of EDH players.     

doesn't matter if this is the first card cEDH is calling for a specific format ban for.   If the RC does this... they have to do it again,  whenever this tiny fraction of non-EDH players finds a card that they can't regulate themselves.     Would also open up the RC to having to defend other bans against complaints by angry and aggressive cEDH players who feel said banning is not appropriate for their format.  

everything else doesn't matter.   those are the salient points:

RC has indicated they won't make bans specifically for cEDH

they do it once.   they have to do it again... this will effectively mean there's 2 ban lists anyway.   As again.  flash is not an issue for regular edh.  just like prot hulk isn't an issue.  

if they ban cards for cEDH.   they then have to consider cEDH fee fees  when deciding to ban other cards.    this is unnecessary extra concern for a variant that could just branch off and manage itself.  


just like 1v1  and french or canadian highlander are not ""edh""  even though they're edh.    cEDH is not  edh.   

If your community and format is getting so big as to need it's own unique bans.   It's time your community stepped up,  and made it's own banlist.  

the initial post by the RC member... just stopping by to drop the link,  was a cesspool of idiots shitting on the RC  and blaming them for all manner of nonsense.   cEDH routinely utilizes insulting rhetoric to define their variant   trying to establish it's legitimacy via hyped up nonsense.   ""it's the natural progression of magic""   --it's not.     ""it's edh at it's most pure""  it's not.   these self righteous attitudes lead those same people to attack and shit on the RC.   

these now constant...   waaaaaah    flash is bad for our format that's the best most powerful magic,  but this card... is too strong.   why is the rules comiteee ignoring us.   

because they said they would?

If the RC has to constantly ban cards.   And then by proxy of doing this.  Not ban cards based on the complaints of a variant that isn’t the experience of the vast majority of other players, it makes the management of the format needlessly complex

The solution is for cEDH to maintain a sep ban list and finally stop being so lazy and codify it’s rules outside of normal edh.  

The position of the RC has been pretty clear they don’t and won’t ban cards solely based on cEDH

card draw also seems weak... you're going to really want more than just tutors.  you have high cmc beater top end.  utility creatures  and equips.   this is a recipe for drawing the wrong parts of your deck,  or just doing nothing.    


the simple reality is.   equipment decks start off in a tricky spot.   a well built deck,  will typically have something on the order of 30-35 actual cards to build the deck with.   if you're at 10-15 equipment cards.     you don't have room for nearly 30 creatures.   you have room for aprox 15-20.    most likely some of those just being misc equip utility creatures and not beaters.    so...5 or so.  you're puresteel paladin, sram,  shikari,  SFM, godo?             ...want to subtract another 5  for utility enchantments?      now you're down to 10 creatures.

the shuffle effects,  are beyond the scope of easily understood math,  so i would argue no one has a real handle on the value on that front.  


\--also.  if your deck benefits from the etb of lands.   but that has nothing to do with mana,  so should be obvious if your deck gains value on this front

the value for fixing is pretty easy to understand.

1 shock, 1 pain(2nd pain if a horizon land is avail),  1 filter (possibly a second filter if it's an older color pair)  check land,    4-5 rainbow lands.    the odd chance... a  battlebond land is in your colors...  or for black.. tainted lands.   etc etc.   The point being.   You run out of viable untap duals rather quickly.    Fetches.   even if they're budget (panoramas,  mirage slow fetch,  e-wilds, t-expanse)  present additional lands that could presumably access either color.

running 7 fetches in a two color deck  ensures you have something on the order of 15+ lands that present both colors as options.  add in basic lands... and your mana base may have something lke 20-25   lands of either color accessible to it... out of 36ish total.   this presents a high statistical probability of ""fixing"" your mana.

higher color count decks.   fetches are actually less important,  because the availability of lands is higher.  3 shocks,  3 painlands, 3 filters, 3 checks... etc etc.  there are many more actual lands... and a fetch land,  can acquire multiple other lands.    the volume of fetches is reduced. to reach the same numerical volume of lands to ensure high % chance of encountering them.

so.. the true value of fetches is they present as variable lands.   almost like rainbow lands.     In color pairings that need additional land sources they fill in that gap.

now... if you can't afford optimal lands.   they still present some value.  even running the slower fetches.   but the overall value is mixed.

the question isn't  what's the value of a fetch.   it's ...is a fetchland that etbs tapped, or can only fetch a basic tapped.   is that any worse than just another shitty tapped dual?

the sole purpose is density of cards that fufill the role of providing both colors.  or access to a color (where you would be fetching a basic land)

in my valuation.  mirage slow fetches,  panoramas,  ash barrens,   e-wilds/t-expanse  are how i would break down the budget fetches    (if...all the zendikar/onslaught   and now the modern horizon/eldraine slightly shittier fetch  ...are all outside your budget)

if you have a marginal budget.   you get more bang for your buck,  buying city of brass,  than any one fetch.   exotic orchard,  (the shittier orchard)  ...and it's pricing is fucked now adays because of pioneer... but mana confluence.   reflecting pool...      like... if you've got $10-$20 to dump into EDH   a rainbow land will go in nearly every deck."

EDH,ff226xa,t3_er5fqx,1579491793.0,"some general advice:  


38 lands is ok.   obviously could improve the land base.  I would highly recommend going to watch the professor's youtube video on edh mana bases.  his suggestions present fairly solid math for mana bases.      Even on a budget... BW pain land.  possibly the check land,  should be fairly cheap.   then... if you can afford it.  command tower,  exotic orchard present cheap rainbow lands.   you have the single pip cyclers,   i'd consider the 2 mana cycler  deserts as well.  and possibly the black castle from eldraine as a card draw land.    some number of misc/budget fetchlands would help somewhat as well.   


ramp...   i count 6 items of ramp.  for colors that are not good at ramp.  this is somewhat bad.  mind stone, fellwar stone, the BW talisman  would be three easy additional items(arcane signet would be another... budget allowing).   could run additional mana rocks,  or white creatures.   black market,  presents an enchantment based ramp option as well.     Aim for 10 ish as a min.    as many of those as possible below 3 cmc.     


card draw.  this is another area you've neglected.  in black,  it shouldn't be hard to find decent draw spells.   black has multiple copies of straight forward draw effects.   sign in blood.   there's a near duplicate version... night whisper.   at 3 cmc.  there's read the bones.   I saw at pre-release there's a new spell that's similar to this.   there are also bigger draw spells in black... skeletal scrying i think is one,  necrologia.  ...etc    there are enchantments like underworld connections.  phyrexian arena,  necropotence   ...there are also the sort of self-curse black enchantments.     again... aim for a rock solid 10 sources of card draw.    And if your deck only has one enchantress.  that doesn't really count as draw.  you're never going to weaponize enchantments for draw like a GW enchantress deck.      


removal you have some spells.    Personally,  if you're going for enchantments,  I'd look at enchantment based options rather than... meh spells like mortify.   there are a wide range of enchantment based removal,  or tricks.   darksteel mutation, nevermore,  journey to nowhere,  Oblivion ring,   prison term,   quarantine field.   the o-ring spell that targets all three opponents.          You have some of this stuff in your deck,  but it seems sort of hodge podge.   If you have 5 ish... ok single target spells.  you shouldn't then have 5 ok to meh  enchantment removal.  10 single target spells.   is kinda a lot.   at those high a numbers.   you're detracting from your deck.     


lastly.    Your deck has somewhat an identity crisis.      


what is your deck's goal?    in a short as possible description?         To me... it seems really all over the place.    


if you're going with the choice of BW.   or daxos.   what about daxos are you leveraging?  ie... why run that card?   what is it about enchantments that you like?     


as it stands... you have a small handful of tempo/hatebear type cards  a couple pillowfort cards.   Some misc enchantment recursion creatures.    some anthems and go wide pump effects.    a small selection of voltron or aura effects.   Oddball punishment spells like painful quandary.   then even a yolo card or two  like big Sorin.     


so... it's hard to give you any advice on your deck.      You could go a number of directions.  If you wanted to attempt pillowfort or hatebear/stax type stuff.  could certainly do that... more enchantments that restrict or affect how others play.   hoping to snowball into shitting out big spirits with daxos.    You could do... go wide tokens.    plenty of enchantments that make,  or generate tokens,   could run value enchants that can be blinked... to repeat trigger various etb effects for things.     There's probably also... generic beater strategies.  go wide,  or go tall.  auras,  or world enchants.      Could also go more evil type enchants.  curse effects,  the black enchantments that punish people... make them sac their own stuff, discard, or they take damage when they attack you.... or other ""black"" effects.  


if you want the hatebears route.  look up ""staxos""  lists.      curse lists.. or punishment lists... for more the evil stuff.   I'd honestly suggest looking at some GW lists to see good general white enchantments.  or maybe... looking at mardu... lists that sometimes use enchantments.   maybe alesha,  or zurgo... or possibly esper enchantment decks.       


generally speaking.  a well built deck will have 30-35 cards after all the foundation elements.   this allows one main theme/central strategy.   and a small subtheme  


if it were me,  i would focus on tokens/go wide.    leverage all the token generating enchantments,   run a tight selection of team pump style effects.  cathar's crusade,  true conviction,  archetype of finality.  some anthems.     make lots of misc flying tokens.   off of enchantments.   have daxos to crank out big tokens.      then a small subtheme of punishment or deterrent effects.     the black enchantments that damage opponents when they attack you.  or make them discard,  or otherwise mess with their decisions.    then... build an army of tokens,  swoop in to beat face."
EDH,fezhwk4,t3_eqqykl,1579457525.0,"36-38 lands

10 ramp/draw/ removal

As a baseline.      These can be adjusted slightly but too much derivation any your deck won’t have a high enough density of cards of a type to encounter them


I for instance shoot for 10 ish. Straight up draw effects. But then will have. Mind stone or single pip cycle lands or a land that can draw cards at a meh rate.   For like. Overall 15-20 card draw sources.  Or like 7 single target removal. Maybe less rates. Or maybe like 12 ish overall removal cards. 

But the hyper geometric math on 10 of a type is about as low as I’m willing to go.  

After that.  Is have as concise a deck strategy as possible for the remaining 30ish cards

Ie. If you can’t answer how your deck wins in like one sentence. Your deck is probably meh.  (If winning isn’t the goal... change wins to whatever goal you have)

Sub themes need to be highly disciplined. Again if you can’t commit 8-10 cards to a theme it’s really not helping your deck all that much.   

A deck normally can only support one main theme and a single subtheme if there is value added to it from the central deck conceit 

Compound value is the key to having a deck that actually generates value.  Not every deck can do this. So sometimes you have to understand what your deck wants to be doing or should be doing.  

Keeping an eye towards.   Actually useful low cmc spells.  And overly bloated high cmc spells is also key if winning. Vs drrrp battlecruiser"

Taking cards to an LGS.  This is less than a buylist but lowest effort.  A brick and mortar store has overhead and has to compete with online stores so they typically offer the least.  But. It’s as lazy as going to your local store

Selling them yourself.  eBay. Tcg player.  Facebook groups.  You post them at just below the last seller.  Sell them. Ship them.  Eat the 10-14% fee     Normally works out slightly better than buylist.   

For me.  If you have a small amt of cards sell them on ebay/TCGplayer.   I just flipped the new UG titan of nature. On eBay after pulling it in pre-release.  Same with a nylea foil I pulled.   It’s not hard.   But. I’m also not really concerned with getting max money back.  

If you speculate on cards or have hundreds of dollars worth of cards.  A buylist might be better

There is also a site called card sphere where you “trade” cards to people for credit on the site.   And people will send you cards.   If you have enough “money” in your account.   You can also cash out your balance and get paid.     But cardsphere operates somewhere in the valuation of slightly below tcg low.  And a lot of people are seeking to operate even lower.  At buylist type lvls.  So. Have to be careful
