AmItheAsshole,ffc19iq,t1_ffc01t4,1579788979.0,"IMO it DID sound like a hint, from a very stupid and tone-deaf person. Not excusing this ""friend"" for saying something so horrible--but there are lots of incredibly obnoxious people who don't realize that their ""flirting"" can be downright vile. She's also probably one of those people to get offended when you don't like their mean joke, and double down, saying ""What? Can't take a joke? What are you, a pussy?"" And I suspect that's what's going on here."

Hehe if it helps, I can obviously see the resemblance--they're also closely related to otters (i.e. sea pups), and if you can imagine how your ferrets look in a bath, they frankly look more like long wet rats than otters!

Have some empathy. Those people are telling you the negative consequences from their parents making the same decision as you. Your  first thought is defensiveness instead of empathy. Which is not a good look."

Listen, you're not a shitty parent for baptizing your child and bringing them into your religion from a young age. But frankly, you've got some issues if you refuse to acknowledge that there's any merit in raising your child without religion and letting them choose when they're older."
AmItheAsshole,fehkyo2,t1_fehjjrj,1579118658.0,"I give children a lot more credit. Sure, they don't understand most things *fully,* but children ARE taught math, sports, science, etc. starting at a very young age.

AmItheAsshole,fehjdyl,t1_feh96nc,1579117746.0,Would you mind explaining why you are so against the idea of *not* introducing the child to *any* religion until they understand what it is?

Bringing up the possibility that a personality disorder could be the explanation for mom's assholery gets some people all riled up as if psych/medical conjecture between strangers is completely inappropriate. Maybe you're in the medical field. Maybe you've had someone close to you behave like this and actually have a diagnosis. I wasn't throwing Borderline in willy-nilly.

Sure, lots of women *prefer* seeing female practitioners to examine that area, but why would there be male family docs and OBGYNs at all? Is your husband saying all of their female patients are assholes? Your husband is frankly ridiculous and clearly needs to get out more."

AmItheAsshole,fee3wkm,t3_eol4yx,1579025869.0,"YTA (i.e. YWBTA), but very gently. I know you loved your grandmother and love the ring she left you. And I understand why you would want to propose with \*that\* ring because it is so important to your family and offering it to your fiancee would be symbolic for her joining your family. But like everyone else says, her ring should be one she LOVES. It's going to be on her hand for (in theory) the rest of her life.

You could try proposing with your grandmother's ring and be very clear that you would be glad for her to have it, but you're also glad to find her an engagement ring that she would love if she preferred that. Make it her choice."

Boy am I sure she regretted that one. Then told her about the second. But I'm waiting to tell her for this one.

If masculinity exists, then there are good and bad versions of it. Just like femininity.
