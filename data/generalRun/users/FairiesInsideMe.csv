Probably you wont be able enjoy weed until you improve your life."
PublicFreakout,fcnxikl,t3_ehnjju,1577820383.0,This is why I never feel safe in Russia. So many violent people roaming the streets...
SuicideWatch,fcnd5sr,t1_fcmzp4a,1577809181.0,Of course it's painful.
SuicideWatch,fcn2kg2,t3_ei2zsn,1577801486.0,"Let her have sex, talk about protection and STDs, talk about risks of developing an addiction. Allow her to have a boyfriend. This is kinda normal teen stuff for many people who grew out if it. Accept her as she are, be her friend.

If you press her to be what you want her to be it won't be good for both of you."
SuicideWatch,fclf821,t1_fcldh4i,1577746410.0,May he rest in peace.
SuicideWatch,fclbq6t,t1_fclb8e3,1577744144.0,I wish you all to heal from that devastating tragedy.
SuicideWatch,fclaqn4,t3_ehsqfh,1577743508.0,Sometimes it does. Depends on the situation.
SuicideWatch,fclai2k,t3_ehqr0u,1577743356.0,"Maybe that was an impulse not planned. Experiencing extreme emotional pain can lead to that. Judgment is clouded during episodes like that and you don't really think about anything else than something to stop the unbearable pain...

I understand why you are angry but a anger won't solve anything. I wish you and your family to get through that with compassion, kindness and forgiveness."
SuicideWatch,fcjt1te,t3_ehjx7m,1577703256.0,"I am sorry that you are tortured by your brain. Did you mentioned it to your psychiatrist?

You can always rehome the cat if you are afraid you will harm him. It would be better for both of you."

How I feel deformed? It's being constantly aware about imperfections, touching them, visualising them, worrying about them.

Feeling dysphoria is quite similar, I can't relax, I feel stress over features that I consider masculine looking like my hairline, I feel bad about having them and afraid that people will see them and don't gender me as female in their brain.

This is why I can't wear my hair up and I worry when it's windy outside.  


Worst of all that I could look completely cis and beautiful if I only had choose the right surgeon. I ruined my life and can't accept this outcome. Just can't."
SuicideWatch,fcblcjq,t1_fcbji7e,1577588203.0,"I still feel intense regret about losing my apartment. Back then I was sucidal over this,

In what way? I feel deformed and ugly (not obviously ugly but if you look closely).

And dysphoric (I am trans woman).

It is a mess, my forehead is all uneven and asymmetrical, I have bumps in my scalp, and my hairline is too high now.

Nobody will like me if I don't like myself.

So I will be alone and this all is pointless.

Uhh.. I am going to bed, it's 5 am here.

Thank you for your time and this little conversation."
SuicideWatch,fcbhvvv,t1_fcbeqjp,1577587063.0,"Hi

First time serious thoughts? When I made a big financial mistake that altered my life in a negative way, I lost my apartment. But I got over it (not really but regret didn't torture me every day).

In September I had a plastic surgery that was botched, how I look prevents me to socialize or feel comfortable with my appearance. This surgery supposed to improve my confidence, instead it ruined it completely.

There's nothing in my life really, I always was depressed but this was the final blow that convinced me my life is not worth living.

Everything is triggering and frustrating, movies, social media, laughing people outside, my past better days.

I don't do anything all day except chain smoking and reading suicide forums.

This is not life.

Thank you for replying."
SuicideWatch,fcbbzsw,t3_egzhko,1577585011.0,Like what?
SuicideWatch,fcalyp1,t3_egu5b3,1577571873.0,I am planning to rot as I do everyday
SuicideWatch,fc8n7wx,t3_egmsmm,1577538365.0,"No, why. I don't want to hurt anyone even that arrogant plastic surgeon who ruined my life."
SuicideWatch,fc65x6n,t3_egeqih,1577473009.0,"This is just a thought experiment.

I think you need professional help because it sounds like OCD, I have OCD myself, it can be absolutely horrible.

Believe me, Rockos basilisk is another scary story that boys tell in a dark room but they have grown up and came up with more elaborate and mind twisting one."
SuicideWatch,fc5omnu,t1_fc4a8bw,1577462733.0,"No, just no."
SuicideWatch,fc383jj,t3_efvqlx,1577383737.0,Who knows
SuicideWatch,fc380d2,t3_efyay1,1577383677.0,"Your therapist is manipulating and guilt tripping you. It's not professional nor moral.

I don't know why he decided to say something like that, maybe because he is on of those people who despise suicide.

I think you should discuss it with him."
SuicideWatch,fc07khn,t3_efg5o8,1577281915.0,Pretty much nothing
