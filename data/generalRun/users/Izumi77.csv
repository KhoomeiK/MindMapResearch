AskWomen,fdb23pc,t3_ek8mpl,1578252859.0,"I had my daughter when I was 17 in 1968. I was expelled from school, church and my ,mother wanted to send me to live with my grandmother in another state. Her father was sent away to another state to finish high school. I never saw her at the delivery and went home the next day. In 2 months I moved to Hawaii with my family after signing final adoption papers. Every Mother’s Day, every birthday  I cried for 20. Years. Every relationship I had I told that I had a daughter some where and if she wanted to see me I would welcome her. Lots of my family never knew I was pregnant. I felt isolated and was made to feel guilty. My college and career plans all down the drain. I finally found my path and 12 years later I had my son. Early on I told him about his sister. I feel like I have fought depression most of my adult life. When  she turned 20 she found me and my so, husband and I welcomed her. Her adopted father was a nice man. Her adoptive mother was mentally ill. I will always feel guilty for not being able to provide for and raise her. We have a good relationship and I am close to her children. I couldn’t be more great full for our relationship now. It was hard but in the end she was worth every tear."
