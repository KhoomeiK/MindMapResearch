SuicideWatch,ffwsca4,t1_fdi8u89,1580309842.0,"I replied to this message to someone else sorry. My parents are super backwards and oldschool
And they don't believe anything besides what they grew up with or what they have knowledge on previously, super resistant to learning new things but expect perfectionism from me. I'm stuck in that mindset and have been since the day she left I can't get over it. I smoke weed to numb the pain but even that's not enough anymore. I have no one to guide me and I need a proper parent right now and proper support. What makes me me? The old me is dead and buried and I'm never going back because ei thought that guy was awesome and everyone loved him until they got to know him properly and he's the reason Im in such a shitty place. I play rocket league as much as I can to distract myself but that has such a negative affect on my mental health I've ended up breaking 3 controllers this year alone. I just want her back thats all I want until then gym, girls, friends, humans, family are all pointless and I couldn't care whatsoever, they could drop dead now and I'd probably feel happy. I'm just depression, sadness, crying, not hungry, not sleeping, desperate to have my old life, can't look after myself, can't even keep a good appearenec, people feel uncomfortable around me, misery, pain, pressure, failures, stuck in cycles, unable to help myself, not wanting to work for it, want to be lifeless, just non existent. No peace, no happiness just plain simple nothing. Thanks for your help but I'm hard work and there is no one that would be able to put up with me anymore I'm long gone, I don't even understand myself anymore so I don't expect anyone else to."

Granted her friend shows it in the wrong way but it's very very difficult to understand people in this state. I have a friend like this and could've gave up on him too but I stuck around and he turned his life around after a very very long time, I could see him battling himself everytime, he needed constant reassurance, it was a struggle but I'm glad I didn't leave him out to dry. Love is wanting more for someone than they want for themselves."

lonely,fegcbsc,t1_fefoq85,1579087403.0,This person is right OP absolutely spot on. Similar thing happened to me and I kinda regret putting my ex in that position and wasting both our time. Make sure you're mentally sound before you think of getting into a relationship because they come with very tough challenges and only the strong minded and clear headed will make it through. Even 2 years later I'm still struggling with crippling depression and getting over her is a huge challenge relationships are awesome but in retrospective weighing everything up it wasn't worth it my case and I came out of it in the worst state possible. Your time will come too in the meantime just prepare for it.

depression,fedjfyv,t3_eoky9h,1579013060.0,"I feel most people do come on here to vent and that's good, sometimes that's all they need. I do see a lot of posts providing help too but we can only support, that's the extent of the help we can give the rest of the work has to be done by the poster. This sub is for depressed people and honestly it's difficult for a person who's drowning to help another drowning person if that makes sense. What ways would you like people to help you? It's great that you've opened up the conversation, let's try make this a better space."
SuicideWatch,fedfuw9,t1_fedfd8m,1579010391.0,"Don't worry about it nobody teaches us how to deal with this sort of thing and everyone deals with it in their own way and at their own pace, just because it's taken me so long and I'm still not over it doesn't mean you can't progress faster than me. I'm super stubborn and was told plenty of times that just accept its over dude and everytime i felt a little stab to my heart because I didn't want it to be true I didn't want this reality to be true and I was resisting, I ended up in a cycle of self hate and just straight negativity and hopelessness. Just try keep your mind off things, the aim is to slowly move the person out of your mind. Over time you will get better with it just like anything we put time and effort into. We need to have our own backs for sure because we can't rely on anyone else to have our back thats not how life works. Us guys on this sub will always be here to help just remember you aren't alone in this we're all fighting these same thoughts and feelings and all have the same goal, happiness and that starts from within :) good luck!"
SuicideWatch,fedevwf,t3_eokrzu,1579009612.0,"I know how you're feeling and it's natural, my gf walked away 2 years ago and I still to this day beat myself up and always want to reach out when I'm feeling weak. I think a big part in all this is to stop resisting, stop resisting this present moment and this reality that is now ours. Nothing will magically speed this up we just have to give it time and keep going on with daily life because I'm telling you from experience that putting everything on hold will make you feel worse. Go easy on yourself too there is no pressure even though you feel it, that frustration the deep sadness I get it but your mind is lying to you. Right now you are in no state to make correct decisions and if you act on the impulses you will regret it in the future (as I am rn). My advice is give in to it and accept that its over now. People can offer advice and guidance but you are the one who can make the magic really happen it's all down to you to turn this into a good situation. There is no rush, go at your own pace and be gentle with yourself, when you naturally feel a push to move forward go for it, when you feel overwhelmed take some quality time to re energise. It's a long journey sometimes but with discipline and patience you will come out of this better, I think it's foolish to think feeling better is like a switch, imo I think it's a group of daily habits and practices mentally and physically that help you through, there is no getting over it's learning to accept and be okay with this shitty outcome. You will get through this, I believe in you."
