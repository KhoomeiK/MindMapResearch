Well Wikipedia says:
>>It is usually tied to a person's [sense of self](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sense_of_self). It is particularly important in planning, problem solving, [self-reflection](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Introspection), [self-image](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-image), [critical thinking](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_thinking), [emotions](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotion),[[2]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_monologue#cite_note-2) and [subvocalization](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subvocalization) (reading in one's head).

So it seems natural that I'd use internal dialogue when problem solving or meditating but switch to stream of consciousness when doing things like cooking, stretching, planning a route."
