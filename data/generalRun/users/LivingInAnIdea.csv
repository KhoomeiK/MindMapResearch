selfharm,fegr7e6,t3_eoxacw,1579100633.0,"Sort of, yeah. 
Usually I use an alcohol prep pad to clean the razor and my surface before I start. My rule is if I open the packet, then I will follow through. Sometimes I decide not to open the packet, it just depends on how I feel at that moment."
SelfHarmScars,fderrlp,t1_fddu0tr,1578345246.0,I want to cut deeper. That's all
depression,fderma1,t3_ekwbox,1578345158.0,I'm with you. I just really want my depression to kill me
selfharm,fdcfexk,t1_fdcf5m2,1578273562.0,"This is what I started out on and used for my first 6 or so months of self harming. 
Basically, it was a disposable razor with 2 thin blades. I took some pliers and tried to dismantle the plastic that held the blades in place. It took a while, but I eventually got it. The hard part is trying not to bend the blades for an easier experience."
selfharm,fdceuxc,t1_fdc91p7,1578273179.0,"Amazon, Giant, Walmart, Target, etc. Anywhere you get razors. Disposable razors are the ones where you have to rip the blades out to use them. But real razors have replaceable blades, which then means they have to sell replacements. I just bought mine at Giant (around $8 USD)"
selfharm,fdceow7,t3_ekf706,1578273061.0,I hate going over scars too. And I know where you are. I'm asexual and aromantic. It's a hard life. Maybe try new methods? I recently tried burning. I dont like it as much but it makes ends meet
zoloft,fdccf4i,t3_ekhn4j,1578271535.0,"I'm on 25mg right now, started January 1st (2020)  I felt loss of appetite, and a felt lighter. My stomach was bubbly but no diarrhea yet. Anyways, I feel like the meds arent doing anything now, and the next time I go in is the 15th"
Animemes,fdaaghg,t3_ekdm6m,1578243680.0,"It depends, actually. If I am already a killer, then the number of killers actually decreases by 1.

For example, John and I are killers, Addy is not.
John kills Addy, we still have 2 killers. I kill John, now we have 1 killer."
selfharm,fd7cjve,t3_edwf7y,1578202377.0,I always just leave out the part of my body from the stream. Or I dont shower at all.

antidepressants,fd4fd82,t3_ek02i0,1578167050.0,"I just started out on Zoloft (25 mg) 3 days ago. I've definitely felt a change, but the depression is down rather than up, among other things. But I can't say for sure, in your case. The fact that you are sensitive to medicine probably means that your body reacted quicker than most. Sorry, I dont have much else. Hope this helps"
Daylio,fd4dwp8,t1_fd0heyr,1578166718.0,"You need to understand sarcasm better. Obviously the OP knows it wont cure the depression. The OP is saying what the features seem like they are doing. I agree with OP, these make no sense."
depression,fd302y0,t3_ejnao7,1578153424.0,"I have 2 places where I vent: Reddit and Instagram. I use Reddit to vent to like-minded strangers, since in the sub we're all going through the same thing, so I don't feel bad. But on Instagram, I only vent using the ""close friends"" feature (I have two). I feel bad when I vent on there because I know they don't really care. Thus, the beauty of subreddits."
antidepressants,fcz7r1n,t1_fcz63mq,1578095375.0,"Thanks for responding so quickly. I have a GP, not a psychiatrist. The day she prescribed them, the doctor said she wanted to see me again in no more than one week, but the next appointment is the 15th of January (my dad likes his schedules, even though I'm 17). She isnt my usual doctor, even. And no, family is close to nonexistent. Friends, not so much. Winter break, my personality, and also my abandoning tendencies."

depression,fcxk6ns,t3_ejdj5b,1578064935.0,"I'm still there. I don't want to just die, though. I don't want to exist. Idk what happens after life (heaven, hell, nothing) but I know that being something, even just dead forever, is hell enough."
depression,fcxilx4,t1_fcwygsw,1578063847.0,I love music but sometimes it's the thing to bring me to tears and make me feel worse.
selfharm,fcwqk4h,t3_ej8yw5,1578033716.0,"I'm in the is too, but I've bought them (16 at the time). Before that, I was using disposable razors I got from a hotel. Took some pliers and removed the plastic that secured it, and then used it.

But for the non disposable one, I just went to giant after work, got a pack of blades, and self checked out."
selfharm,fcwq8dv,t3_ejb4x2,1578033383.0,"Sorta. Depending on whether I work a lot or if it is summer, i have to change whether i do it on my upper arm or lower. The lower scars easier and feels better to do it on. And I'm fine with not wearing sweaters (I usually always wear them, even in the summer) around people I'm very comfortable with."
selfharm,fcwq0ky,t3_ej9ah3,1578033160.0,"August of 2018, summer before junior year of HS. Family shit and friend's suicide among other things led to that.

I remember shaving at one point, and then looking at the razor and remembering when I cut my finger by accident trying to clean it out (it was a reusable and I was broke). Took some pliers and removed them, and did some on my ankle. Didn't like that at all so I moved up to thighs and now arms. I pretty much only do arms now."

antidepressants,fcthxo2,t3_ebws2r,1577943869.0,"What was your first day on Zoloft like? I just started taking it (just 25 mg) and all it is doing is making me feel loopy, nauseous, and is giving me a headache."
depression,fcrgjh4,t3_eigrss,1577901533.0,"I \[M17\] know how you feel. I also try and maintain grades so that my parents don't pay more attention to me. I have a therapist as well, but we don't talk about much. Just the same thing (about my family, because that's the shittiest part of my life) every session. Nothing changes. I've tried excessively masturbating, cutting, suicide, music, and just crying to fix it but nothing ever changes either. I'm just to weak and broken to do anything right. I'm such a burden on the people around me, too, since I'm either happy around them or really depressed, or just mean.

I'm just tired of existing. I believe in Heaven and Hell, I just don't want to exist forever. Endless life or endless suffering? I'd rather just not exist.

&#x200B;

But I am starting to take antidepressants. I haven't had any yet, but I hope they will work. I'm tired of living like this, if at all."
depression,fcrerxy,t3_cml6ni,1577900856.0,"After many months of depression, a mental hospital, a bunch of programs, and therapy, I'm finally getting antidepressants. I've just wanted to function right for so long now and I'm just happy to be on the track to being fixed."
javahelp,fcm1b3c,t1_fcm0mgr,1577761641.0,"No, that is correct. I rarely use longs, so that is probably why I didn't remember that. Thank you so much!"
