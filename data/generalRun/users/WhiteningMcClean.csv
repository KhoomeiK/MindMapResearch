Joe Rogan had Molyneux on his show, but I wouldn't say the same things about him. Because he CHALLENGED him and called him out on things he thought were questionable. Which JP did not.

One thing I will give Peterson credit for, however, is that unlike SM, he actually does address and downplay the problematic implications of some of his conclusions. He doesn't just blow dog whistles all day long. Which is part of the reason I DON'T hate him."

PurplePillDebate,fdnss1e,t1_fdn1r2o,1578592103.0,"You said beauty was subjective, but what I think you meant is that beauty is relative.

Beauty is technically subjective, because it can't be measured or quantified. But functionally, people tend to agree on what constitutes beauty way more than they disagree.

What you're saying is that beauty is relative, meaning someone's attractiveness means nothing without context:  who are they being compared to and what group of people (gender, race, country, age) are making that judgment."

PurplePillDebate,fdnposd,t1_fdnk4dx,1578590526.0,"I don't hate Peterson, but I think he does two things that majorly undermine his credibility and make me understand why fellow lefties chastise him.

1. He keeps the wrong company. He has a complete smoothbrain in Molyneux on his show and takes him seriously. He goes on Dave Rubin alongside a cavalcade of right wing loons. If he doesn't actually want to be embraced as alt right, then he's either an opportunist or a terrible strategist.
2. He too often thinks his expertise in a particular field entitles him to have ""expert-level opinions"" on other subjects. He can be very insightful with regard to psychological subjects, and I think part of that is because he doesn't hesitate to enter ""politically incorrect"" territory. But he goes on to speak about other fields with the same gusto, even when it's clear he isn't informed at all."

It's in no way Bernie's fault; he took the loss like a champ. As you say, he didn't pull a Ralph Nader and instead swallowed his pride & enthusiastically endorsed her. But there was a lot of resentment among his supporters. They were given what they saw as a significantly better realistic option to the establishment favorite, and then felt like they were unfairly stripped of that option. I think that led to a lesser level of enthusiasm for Clinton than would have existed if she had just run essentially unopposed."
