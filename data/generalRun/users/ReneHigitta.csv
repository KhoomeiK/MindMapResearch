Is that assumption wrong? If it's right, then is it the detectors that are super expensive and rare, or do you maybe need to mobilize an instrument for very long periods just to get one reading?"

AskReddit,fdmkgdb,t1_fdljgh8,1578553251.0,"Yeah but also all of us 7 billions have 2 parents, 4 grandparents,... 2^32 ancestors (actually a lot more I'd think, 25 years per generation seems large) 

So now Genghis is just one of a billion ancestors to each of that 0.5%, which yeah, probably a huge chunk of the 360 millions are too.

So the feat is not really that he's an ancestor to 35 millions or whatever, he's an ancestor to many many more, but that he is repeated often enough in those 35 millions' family trees that we can still see it in their DNA."

Will be interesting to see if it makes it more ok to market dubbed films in the theatres in the US in the future, that might mean fewer remakes"
nottheonion,fdjhcn5,t3_elhsjm,1578470848.0,"So there's this young surgeon fresh out of med school, sent for his very first intervention on a C section. Unfortunately a bad move and he kills the baby. Horrified, he jumps back and severs one of the mother's arteries. The dad behind him starts shouting and runs to him, only to find the panicked doctor's knife puncturing his guts after he turned around. All three died in the tragedy, and the doctor takes months to recover.

One day he is finally ready to get back on the saddle. He and everyone around is very nervous as he enters the room for another C-section. After minutes, shouts are being heard and staff is running towards the room. The door opens, and the young surgeon comes out, covered in blood but with a big smile on his face : ""this time I could save the father!""

Thanks for your efforts Joaquin, but you should know your environmental footprint is still waaaaay above that of the vast majority of people"
todayilearned,fdel8i9,t1_fdeipsk,1578341399.0,"I'm sold. I still see hurdles (no pest will mean even less robust crops as things go and other things are optimised ; less manpower is good but entirely offset by labor cost if you plan to put these in cities ; growing in water and sterile environnement I suspect will result in blander everything - cue artificial flavours ; many more I'm sure ) . Still sounds like a win overall.

On the CO2 front though, it won't help. That's fine, but heh, we need to take care of that too"
todayilearned,fde8oyi,t1_fde7s4s,1578333621.0,"Yeah I figured something like that, the point is, you need an energy input. You can say renewables, but when all our energy production is renewables, the need for trees will be much less. Conversely, while we make energy by releasing co2, the net effect of clearing land for trees by concentrating food production in buildings with lamps will be more co2 being released in the atmosphere. 

It's still good to have more trees overall for other reasons, but the co2 sink is such a big arguement at the moment and it does seem like this solution is a dead end in that respect. Even counter productive"

todayilearned,fddvsqw,t1_fddusfn,1578325204.0,"Isn't a huge chunk of that population density due to being in the NYC metropolitan area though?

Another thing to keep in mind is that NJ is not it's own country. In case of fan-hitting shit they can count on other parts of the US to provide things like food. Belgium, while part of the EU, is an independent country, and for better or for worse countries will cling to things like food independence (or do their best to not go too dependent on neighbours). And that does take space as well. 

There might still be plenty of room for more woodlands though, I don't know any particulars I'm just pointing out potential limitations"
