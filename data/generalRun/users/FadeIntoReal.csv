I would also add that if you’re recording 24 bit, simply setting your levels for the screaming may work. 24 bits is plenty enough that levels down quite a ways will still be recorded with sufficient bit depth.

My experience with shielding is that you *can* use something like chicken wire for a faraday cage if installed correctly. I’ve seen studios near broadcast and electrical facilities constructed this way. My suggestion would be to grab a roll of wire fencing, connect to a good ground, and test yourself before adding these materials to a wall. Some exterior sheathing-type insulation adds foil which may be an easier material with which to test but, if incorporated into walls, be certain to make good electrical connections between panels."

“RF condenser microphones use a comparatively low RF voltage, generated by a low-noise oscillator. The signal from the oscillator may either be amplitude modulated by the capacitance changes produced by the sound waves moving the capsule diaphragm, or the capsule may be part of a resonant circuit that modulates the frequency of the oscillator signal.”

This allows assembly without insulating each line and is kept in place by the outer shrink tube. 

If you’re dealing with “solderproof” wire, which contains polyester strands woven in with the meat conductor strands, bend the wire  90° or more then brush the end a bit with a fingertip until all of the polyester stands out straight, separated from the conductor.  Then it’s easier to cut back the polyester which tends to burn and prevent any solder from adhering to the conductors,  hence the nickname “solderproof“."

The gain cell changes gain according to a voltage input. The detector generates a voltage that’s proportional to the incoming signal level. The gain cell uses that voltage to vary its gain. If the gain increases with an increase in incoming signal level, it expands dynamic range. If the the gain decreases with an increase of incoming signal level, it co presses dynamic range. When the detector and the gain cell see *different signals*, then the signal fed into the detector (sidechain signal) causes those proportional changes to an entirely different signal ."
