The average occupancy of theaters hovers between 15 and 20%.

Theaters make much more on concessions than they do on the tickets and they would make much more if they just filled the seats for free. The problem is that studios will demand the same amount on every ticket regardless of whether it is a hit or flop. There was a freakonomics or Planet Money on ticket pricing that was quite good.

Anyhow, theaters have to charge for each ticket no matter what due to the way movies are priced. Individual cinemas might be able to fit more butts in seats to their own incentive but there is no benefit to the studios to change the way they sell their movies."

So many such as yoga actually do work in more-or-less the same fashion in which it claims to minus the mystical energies which is actually a visualization of your own nervous system."
