college,ffap02e,t1_ffag9hw,1579741111.0,Do it. Time can't be wasted if you shift it. You sleep then means you don't have to sleep at home so you reclaim the time.

MurderedByWords,ff9t6e1,t1_ff9m738,1579720717.0,It's isn't. They just throw these labels at people to try and discredit them. Oh I don't like your opinion so i'm gonna call a *ist
news,ff6ateb,t3_erou9m,1579623126.0,These buy backs are so stupid. Anyone participating in them is probably not the person that's gonna be using their guns for a shooting. But they are the person with no defense against a shooter now.
college,fes30nd,t1_ferznxk,1579360915.0,"It makes sense just fine. Thanks for telling the story. I don't like how these types invade the education system these days. They are unprofessional overgrown children that throw a fit if their political views are questioned. They don't even really teach anything and seem to just be there because someone wants to fulfill a political agenda, waste of money. $2000 just to sit and listen to some sjw ape shove his opinions down everyone's throats. College is broken."

tifu,fe6nn59,t1_fe3ljtr,1578897216.0,"lots of ""supposed to"" in society. 

Feels like people respond with ""ew underaged"" as a preprogrammed response. 18 is just an arbitrary number america picked. it's 17 or 16 in other places and people don't magically wake up any different on their 18th birthday. Many look almost exactly the same at 17 and 18. 

Fact is by biology, age 15 is a fully sexually developed adult capable of reproduction in most cases so attraction isn't really strange. Exploitation of ignorant children is what's the problem. 
Responses like this guy's wife are preprogrammed pretentiousness. Guy didn't even know the age or anything, just saw young wife at her prime in a bikini."
college,fe6mm4s,t1_fe41ili,1578896094.0,Well that could be possible. I'm just thinking work + college together are such a massive time and money drain that one may not have the resources to fully commit to such experiences. Maybe one just wants to unwind and chill in the little off time. Depends on the person.
college,fe6mcvv,t1_fe2d4d5,1578895809.0,"Well first of all you need to know what you want from life and start building towards that. 
For now just finish your college so you can get a good stable high paying job. 

Now after that is the question. Many people would just saddle themself with the next big responsibility and life drain, such as having kids. If building a family and raising kids is your goal and your happiness then go ahead. But if you just want to live your life doing whatever then making kids and or getting tied down to your current location due to relationships may not be good decisions for that particular goal. If you really wanted to you could work 40 hours and live your life with the other 30-40 hours a week. Pick your path and build towards it.

Life after high school doesn't have to be the generic suffocating depressing life you are thinking of. Your life will be built on the decisions you make. How you manage finances, how you plan ahead, how long you let your debt go unpaid, which jobs you choose and for how long you choose to stay at them. Which people you associate with. etc"
college,fe0gmo6,t1_fe07mtu,1578813131.0,This feeling happens when every day is the same. You recall an entire year as a handful of events only. If 9 months are the same then they might as well be 9 weeks. Try having unique experiences frequently after you're done with this shit.

tax,fdpyh68,t1_fdofja6,1578645994.0,What I need to know is do I need to put the credits in the W4 or can I put nothing on the W4 and fill the forms for my employer and be done with them and sort the credits out when i file taxes in February when I have my W2 to get the info from it to fill out the other forms.
tax,fdo8v5a,t1_fdo05iz,1578600898.0,"I think I do quality for that American opportunity credit. Idk how to claim that though. 

So what do i put in the W4? Estimate the student loan interest ill have in 2020? Should I fill in the forms for the job and deal with these credits later when i file my tax return?

Thank you for your help"
