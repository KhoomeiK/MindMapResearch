cats,fee19wn,t1_fedigm0,1579024300.0,I ended up trying Nulo. I really like how the food it’s super tiny. My cat was having problems with Blue buffalo she would always throw it up and the food wouldn’t be completely chewed. Idk if it was too much for her to handle or if something in the food was upsetting her stomach. But if Nulo doesn’t work out either I will definitely be trying Royal canon!

FirstTimeHomeBuyer,fdzlizk,t1_fdzkjxl,1578791364.0,"Well they bought the house for 164,500. They were asking way more than they paid for it. They didn’t have any updates to the house besides painting the outside. So we thought it was a fair price. But of course we would negotiate if they said no."
