You're joking right?  I've done over 600 AV's in classic and every ally premade I've done either does 1 or 2 things.  They either rush straight to Drek skipping everything, doing a broken as fuck pally bubble pull - or they rush straight to Galv, kill it, then rush straight to Drek and do a bullshit pally bubble pull.

Either method they're attempting to end the game as FAST as possible.  They don't care about objectives, nor winning.  They care about maximizing their ""honor per hour"".  Hence why after you wipe a premade on defense once or twice a lot tend to give up.  Just yesterday I had ""the"" ally premade (the one with like 12 marshalls) wipe twice, the last with Drek on 1%.  Half their raid went AFK in their starting cave, the other half took off their armor and went AFK in the harpy cave."
