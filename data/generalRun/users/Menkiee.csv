SuicideWatch,feocxbh,t3_eq750x,1579298369.0,"Please don’t do anything dangerous to yourself. Remember that you don’t deserve to feel this way and that each morning you wake up is a new start. No matter what you’ve done or what you felt. Do you need someone to talk to? You can rant to me if you want. Also, happy birthday. I truly hope that you’ll find happiness in your life."
SuicideWatch,feoaza5,t3_eq6yiu,1579297587.0,Hey. I care about you and if you ever need someone to talk to you can just pm me if you want.  I know how much loneliness sucks and you definitely don’t deserve to feel this way. I hope that you’ll be able to find happiness in life.
SuicideWatch,fecptn0,t3_eogarx,1578980287.0,"Each morning is a new start. No matter what you've done or what you felt. So please, try to survive untill the morning arrives. You can tell yourself no one cares as much as you want but that doesn't change the fact that I'm taking my time to write this because I care about you. And more people care about you. That's what we do here in this subreddit. We care about eachother. Please do not do anything dangerous to yourself. Out of all the things that could've happened, this popped up on your screen. This is a sign. Stay alive, for us."
SuicideWatch,fe6ox0o,t1_fe6nxmq,1578898691.0,"I've also been abused my whole life. Neglect, physical abuse, yelling, my own mother telling me she wants me dead. And I also had the thought of getting rid of my mother and sister. Hell, I even pulled a knife on my sister when I was 12 and I got into alot of trouble with the police. But now I realise that killing is not the smartest option. Killing will only result in being more of an awful human being than those who hurt you. You should forgive those who hurt you. Not because they deserve it, but because you deserve it. Commiting murder will never result in being respected by other people. What satisfaction will there be if you killed those people? The only thing you'll realise after killing those people is that they had control over you and that you weren't strong enough to forgive them, or to leave them alone. I get that abuse can make you do alot of terrible things, but seeking help for it is the best you can do."
SuicideWatch,fe6nkhu,t1_fe6m63a,1578897134.0,You must hate those people alot if you want them to die. What made you hate these people? What did they do to make you feel this way about them? I just want to listen to you and try to help you.
SuicideWatch,fe6m2ye,t1_fe6lpxp,1578895519.0,"Killing is not revenge. It probably won't even give you the satisfaction you want. Killing is just admitting you let that person control you and you want to get rid of them. As I said, there are so many other ways for revenge without causing any harm. Succes is a great revenge. Make life goals, plans, live your life. Show them you're better off without those toxic people. Just don't turn into one yourself by killing people."
SuicideWatch,fe6ll4r,t3_enzzob,1578894997.0,"I get that going through alot of suffering is hard. Especially when other people caused that suffering. It's understandable that you want revenge and that you just want those people gone forever, but there are so many other ways for revenge. Please do not hurt others or yourself. We're all here to listen to you, and to help you. Believe me, killing people is not going to help."
