guitars,ffiama6,t3_etsqrz,1579969310.0,"I've been trying to refine my sound for months. I've gone through 300$ boutique pedals, a bunch of boss and ehx, tried all the brands people seem to fawn over, and this is what I've eventually settled on!

Guitar is a Gretsch jet club

- Caline Midlander: it's a tube screamer clone for 30$. It's cheap, all metal, and has its own distinct personality. Can get a bit dirtier than a normal ts

- GOKKO angel chorus: another cheap and cheerful pedal. Very deep chorus, lots of range. Close to an ehx Clone but sounds pretty unique still

- Ammoon Pockecho: great delay pedal. Does tube, digital, tape, analog, low fi, reverse, mod, and more.. Also has a looper that can be used at the same time or independently. I only wish it had different time divisions like dotted 8ths. All in all really good deal for the 70$ new I paid

- Line6 Verbzilla: found at a used guitar shop for 25$. I'm petty sure this is what they based the oceans 11 off of. Shimmer, two different springs, all the standards, and a modulated reverb called cave that sounds a bit like the Afterneath without getting nearly as crazy

- WA Slo: I can't say enough about this pedal. All I know is that it's never leaving my board and provides me with the deepest, longest, dreamiest reverb money can get.

- Mustang GT100: these things got slammed when they first came out, but after the 2.0 update they're amazing amps. The built in effects are totally serviceable and you can even get some great metal tones out of them. Plus it plugs directly into my pc via USB for lag-free recording.

Sometimes expensive doesn't mean it's the best, and I've learned that. I'm chasing a sound, not a showcase."

- Animesh, so non-attached mesh objects can have animations and sorta-physics
- Bento mesh, meaning that avatars don't have to use the standard SL rig anymore
- Lighting improvements accross the board
- Shadows from sun/moon and local lights
- AO / SSAO implemented

Consoles aren't powerhouses, for sure, but the xbone can handle elite dangerous and no man's sky, both of those games containing huge dynamic game worlds albeit with repetitive assets. The ps4 can handle planetside 2 which at peak play has 3000 players per map. These things aren't just little baby toys to play gimped simulacra of popular games on.

I must have tried twenty different pedals before deciding on this one and I'm so glad I did. It had the largest range of any distortion I've used while still keeping the tone coherent. I can go anywhere from a doom fuzz to a straight clean boost, with lots of options in between.
