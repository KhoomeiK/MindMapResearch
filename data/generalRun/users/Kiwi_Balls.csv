im14andthisisdeep,fgow0m5,t3_ezdbdl,1580989137.0,Holy shit. I've actually posted this exact picture on my Tumblr back in 2012 i belive.

tumblr,fgi7jos,t3_eyief5,1580809706.0,"One of the reasons i stopped watching Sleepy Hollow on Netflix was because in every episode (and i mean EVERY), some caracter would be like ""There's a ancient monster going around the city? I conveniently remember reading about it somewhere!"" and then pulls out a old dusty book from an untouched bookshelf, just kinda knew exactly where it would be, flips throug it for a second and then starts translating some dead language perfectly into english that conveniently tells exactly how to track the monster down and kill it."
AskReddit,fgi7394,t3_ey9qbh,1580808990.0,"First one that came to mind (because i paid for it) was the newest Pirates of the Caribbean.

I paid to see non funny sex and alcohol jokes and Johnny Depp drunk as fuck pretending to act as Jack Sparrow. Seriously the dialogues were so bad i actually wanted to cry. I've been a fan since i saw the first one as like a 7 year old. Hell, i even liked the 4th one! But this? I've never been more dissapointed. I'd rather watch the Avatar the last airbender movie over and over again than this ever again.

It's kinda a shame because i actually liked the villain in it and Javier Bardem actually did a good job. It's just that literaly everything else sucked ass and i'm just wondering why no one's talking about this!"
