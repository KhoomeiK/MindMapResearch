OldSchoolCool,ff8xija,t3_es93i8,1579699297.0,"My parents were at this too! My mom told me she wore a bikini, and just a bikini, lol."
DunderMifflin,ff8dyh8,t1_ff8708t,1579674470.0,I just watched that episode and he KILLED that scene. It looked so natural and not over acted at all. He is super talented.
FundieSnark,ff72ktr,t1_ff6qtaf,1579639853.0,"YES. Your experience is exactly like mine. I feel like there needs to be an attitude of convalescing after birth, rather that bouncing back and that there are all these expectations of you. If I ever have another baby I am making arrangements to be able to lie in my bed with my baby, surrounded by the things we need, diapers and snacks ect. Newborns nurse constantly so I will just make myself available constantly so that it won’t feel like such an intrusion or inconvenience. I am not putting anything extra on myself for a week. Social media made me feel like I needed to be doing something, but damn if me and my baby don’t deserve to relax and not look or be perfect.

Also I am so relieved to hear that other moms didn’t bond with their baby right away. I cried everyday because I loved her so much and would have died for her but to be honest most of the time picking her up when she cried at night and woke me felt no different than picking up a box I knew I had to move into another room. Legitimately just an object I had to care for at the time.  Never hatred or regret but it felt very mechanical and joyless during the really hard weeks. Once things chilled out I had time to bond with her because I felt more human to an extent. 

It also made me believe everyone dressed their newborn in impractical, nonfunctional and expensive clothing as well. As a first time mom, caring for my daughter was so overwhelming that the idea that I had to change her into pajamas every night and then change her into regular clothes seemed like too much. She wore pretty much just a onesie and socks 24/7 and I always felt bad about it which suuucked."
femalefashionadvice,ff2gn51,t1_ff2b82o,1579505304.0,My favorite color! It seems to go great with any and all skin tones as well. I also like Essies Topless And Barefoot nude color if you’re looking for more recommendations!
instant_regret,ff08zif,t1_ff01b3r,1579466481.0,"This for sure. I used to think they were mean but then I went bird hunting with my in-laws and realized that a well trained hunting dog very rarely gets shocked. Sometimes it’s even used to keep them safe, like if they get too far away and need to come back. Most hunters only use it as a last resort and teaching tool. Also I think having the collar put on helps get them into “hunting mode” if you will."
drugstoreMUA,fem2kix,t1_felukno,1579237666.0,I love it too! I like to use the lightest shade as highlighter occasionally!
DunderMifflin,fej3e0o,t1_feizxnq,1579155392.0,"I agree. So much magic can happen in a podcast when hosts get a little off topic or on a tangent and I feel like trying to keep it under a time limit can really stunt the whole beauty of podcasts which is to some extent just listening to several people chatting. So many of my favorites are really free form discussion podcasts with a bit of structure, but I do enjoy their format I just wish they expanded on it some more. 

Also if you don’t mind, what is the most successful podcast of all time? I’m always looking for suggestions!"
tretinoin,feii9pg,t3_ep3ciw,1579139157.0,"We are in such a similar predicament and I almost made a post just like this one so that people would talk me off the ledge of stopping tret! I am about a month in and started slowly and I’m now using it every night, and the purging has been ridiculously awful. It started not long after I first began but now that I’m up to every night it’s gotten crazy. I’m on .025 but waiting on delivery of .05 because of what I’ve read here recently that .025 can have more of a drawn out purge whereas a higher concentration will kick it faster. I started tret when I began experiencing cystic acne out of the blue after having only mild acne my entire life, but even then I never had as bad of skin as I do now. I’m sticking with it and praying that in a few months I can come on here and be glad I did instead of depressed that maybe I’ve ruined my skin? I’m also experiencing a lot of peeling but only in my bad areas, around my mouth and chin which are the usual places I get acne and of course where my purge is the worst. I’m literally in actual pain from my face! Here’s hoping things improve for both of us!!"
raisedbynarcissists,fei29st,t1_feh6nyl,1579128702.0,"I love this. Especially the uniforms, it would’ve taken away 99% of my school stress as a kid. That being said, I love watching my daughter enjoying getting dressed and picking her outfits just as you said! She’s little and doesn’t understand fashion and style or fitting in yet, but I can’t wait to help her find her personal style and help her shop for what she needs. Just like you I rarely had the clothes that made me “fit in” and even though the idea of clothes mattering socially makes me cringe, it’s totally true. Especially with kids who don’t understand as much nuance of friendships and looking past appearance, having some of the “right” clothes matters soooo much to helping self esteem even years and years later. Of course money plays a huge part but I think the care that a parent exhibits in that respect really does a lot."
raisedbynarcissists,fehzpz6,t1_feg5kgj,1579127160.0,"My mom was so similar to this except with opposite clothing shapes. I was afraid of loose fitting clothing FOREVER because she always used to say how much bigger it makes you look, like no matter what. I was a somewhat chubbier pre-teen who could’ve benefited from better fitting clothing for my body, including loser fitting but structured items. Also she always said that high rise jeans were “old lady”, and it’s true that they were less mainstream and popular at the time but I didn’t have the body type for low rise jeans and would’ve looked much better in high rise. She had an issue with me wearing “lazy” looking clothes to school and it’s stuck with me forever that I have to be wearing something “nice” whenever I go somewhere. Once she even said “your boyfriend isn’t going to like it if you always just wear t shirts when he comes over.” She was also recently appealed and couldn’t understand why my sister and I don’t worry about shaving our legs for our husbands everyday. 
Now of course styles dictate a slouchy loose look as well as high rise jeans which I have learned to embrace, but for a long time I had huge hang ups over it! I have made a promise to myself that I won’t make the same mistakes my mom did and to teach my daughter that finding clothes isn’t all about what can make you look the most thin, it’s about having fun and expressing yourself and being comfortable!"
Showerthoughts,fefp0tm,t3_eou90f,1579061237.0,"This summer, I was on a walk around our neighborhood with my daughter and husband. Suddenly I had a severe gurgle in my stomach, one of those “get to the bathroom NOW” gurgles. We were at least a 10 minute walk away and I knew I wouldn’t make it in that time. So the only logical thing was to hedge my bets and start running home and hope that time would be on my side. I made it but I can only imagine who saw me running as fast as I could bear in sandals and a sundress and what they thought about me."
starterpacks,fec5y12,t1_fec3vf3,1578967176.0,"This is exactly what I was saying! My dad was always like this. If he bought soda or some other treat for the family, my brothers would eat tons of it really quickly, and rather than teaching them moderation for the sake of their health as well as the ability of others to partake in the treat, he declared “no soda or treats ever!” because he didn’t want to discipline them and deal with the work of it."
starterpacks,feahmtp,t1_fe9je4f,1578948901.0,"I always thought it was dumb that he threw away the computer. Like okay, get rid of the medium you use to consume porn rather than learn to avoid it. Almost like if he set his car on fire because he drives it to go get fast food rather than learning to resist getting fast food. I just never thought that part showed him in a very positive light. Like yes you aren’t watching porn but not because you chose to, it’s because you CANT. And now you’ve destroyed a tool that the rest of your family needs to use."
FundieSnark,fe6p1q1,t1_fe6mapm,1578898845.0,I had a friend who got baptized at 3. THREE! There is not a 3 yr old in the world who is developmentally advanced enough to understand baptism and a religion.
FundieSnark,fe6otry,t1_fe6lo8c,1578898584.0,So much shame is put on the backs of kids in the name of religion. It was drilled into us that we had to try to convert adults and that it was something we needed to worry about all the time. Like can’t I just focus on going to elementary school please?
FundieSnark,fe6n412,t1_fe6kodt,1578896639.0,"My period stopped when I hit 120lbs at 5ft 6. My doctor said every woman has their own set weight and body fat percentage where their period will stop, and even though everyone is different I am nearly certain these girls don’t have periods. Very sad as it can mess with their fertility and just health in general in the long term."
oneanddone,fdrec5g,t3_emspxp,1578683306.0,"Yes. I want a medical reason that I can’t have more as it would make the decision for me, per se. Obviously I don’t want to minimize women who do suffer from infertility or certain conditions but if I knew that I physically couldn’t then it would be relieving as well as a good excuse for other people."
AskReddit,fdr4vic,t1_fdqgoe2,1578679552.0,Agreed. I have a winter jacket that I’ve had since I was 13 that I plan to give to my daughter when it fits her. The only reason I’m still not wearing it is because I was gifted another slightly upgraded one.
birthcontrol,fdg95mn,t3_el7xfj,1578385375.0,"This is exactly my experience as well. I do tend to have spotting 2-3 days beforehand the super heavy day and 2-3 days after also. I’m also in considerably more significant pain during that heavy day, but I prefer it rather than the spaced out week of heavy cramping I used to have. It took me a while for everything to even out, but I have had mine since April."
tretinoin,fdf6uvb,t1_fdep37q,1578354665.0,Seeing this gives me hope for my red marks!! Can’t wait to get through the purge and start making progress like you!
insaneparents,fdd2c3q,t1_fdby7dl,1578291977.0,"Right! It’s not like it’s a 17 YEAR old, the baby hasn’t had hardly any time or chance to develop a health issue."
trashy,fdd1sou,t1_fdcls5d,1578291393.0,"I remember really appreciating that aspect of hunters ed. I was relatively older when I took it but I liked how they taught you respectful sportsmanlike rules and not just cut and dry regulations. I remember one of the teachers telling us to always ask if it’s okay before you show someone a picture of something you’ve killed because it could be offensive or frightening to them, and it always stood out to me."
Parenting,fd7pvok,t1_fd6jsm1,1578208234.0,"I am the same with food. The feeling of being in true need of nourishment and having someone keeping you from it is THE WORST and really feels dehumanizing. I try my best to get my daughter whatever she might need to enjoy her meal but I’m not going to the fridge 4 times for different dips or condiments, sorry!"
Parenting,fd7p3hr,t1_fd7aqal,1578207895.0,"I see so many new moms say “wow I finally got a shower after a week!” Like wow you must have a really terrible husband if he can’t give you 20 minutes to take a shower whenever you need one. My daughter cried like crazy whenever I showered and left her with my husband when she was little but tough luck, I have to care for the actual biological needs and health of my body and state of mind. I totally get the craziness and forgetting to shower or just being too tired some days but come on, it shouldn’t be a source of pride or a way to brag how overworked you are because there’s no way a mom with a husband at home for even a small portion of the day can’t get time away for a shower."
interestingasfuck,fd5m4na,t1_fd3glzc,1578178956.0,Him and Daniel really seemed to get along during their interview too! Often they seem forced but theirs was really genuine and like they were just having a good time with each other and could honestly be friends. I loved it!
PanPorn,fd5kq4d,t1_fd3xeik,1578178589.0,If you take a relatively strong fridge magnet and place it over the top of the pan it will pop right out and be attached to the magnet!
todayilearned,fd3bidq,t1_fd2skz9,1578156638.0,"I also think it’s odd that I can’t ever find them in schools either! My college had one but any elementary, middle, and high schools I visit for siblings sports never have one even in the women’s! I know the students there don’t need diaper changing facilities but the visitors who come for athletics, plays, etc do. Even a mom coming to pick up her kids might find herself in need of a place to change her not school age baby. It’s just always strange and inconvenient to me!"
todayilearned,fd39x9m,t3_ejwxed,1578156174.0,"I once asked my grandpa about some detail of what happened when my dad was born, and he said “I have no idea, I wasn’t in the room.” I was surprised and then he explained that it really wasn’t a thing back then for dads to be present or there for support during childbirth. Different times, man."
todayilearned,fd09zb4,t1_fcz88p7,1578115827.0,This is exactly true. I was told that it helps babies to associate concepts with language and communication and aids them in making those connections once they are ready to speak. Anecdotally I feel as if the small amount of sign language we taught my daughter as a baby has helped her communication skills as a toddler.
DuggarsSnark,fculwpy,t1_fcu95tf,1577983855.0,"I know a lady with 5 kids, the last 3 were all very premature with long NICU stays and complications. The last baby is still in the NICU. My question is, obviously a pattern is emerging, why do you keep getting pregnant?? Why put babies through this over and over when obviously something is repeatedly causing problems?? The mom has complications too and reproductive organs issues she’s also still dealing with. And she always posts how overwhelmed she is with her kids because they are all young and close in age. It’s like women with lots of kids act like it just “suddenly happened to them” when in fact they made a conscious decision every time to either try again or not seek birth control and risk pregnancy. I get feeling overwhelmed with the amount you chose, but once you hit that “okay this is too much for me” amount, then STOP."
TwoXChromosomes,fckxxmf,t1_fcjzwkw,1577735572.0,"I wanted to like my DivaCup so badly! But I think maybe I got the wrong size because I can feel it. It kinda feels like it’s constantly pressing on my bladder so I always feel like I have to pee. I have had 1 baby so I got the post childbirth/ age 30 plus size, but I’m also only 24 so maybe I should have just gotten the smaller one??"
toddlers,fc6idtk,t1_fc69mue,1577481296.0,I do this too! Especially when it’s something she really wants like a bubble bath or to watch a movie. Then he can help her with it and she sees him more positively!
toddlers,fc6i906,t1_fc5jmm1,1577481204.0,"Yes! Going through the same and this is exactly what needs to happen. As long as LO is fed and safe and needs are met, they need to learn that they can’t always have Mom and that it’s not appropriate to expect that she’ll always be around every second. My husband hates when she freaks out because she wants me because the instant solution is for me to just return and fix everything and it’s an easy fix, but not fair to me! Or my daughter. So we have special times that I am not available at all!"
tretinoin,fc1boa9,t1_fbyv6tf,1577313953.0,"What kind of acne did you have before?? I have mild acne and mostly closed condones but since starting tret I have gotten several big swollen cyst like pimples in my usual areas. Just curious if you dealt with cysts prior or are noticing them as a new type, because I’m worried that the big cysts I’m getting could be unrelated to purging, however they are in my usual spots where I’m prone to acne, so idk."
iwatchedanoldmovie,fbytqjs,t1_fbykwrb,1577226089.0,Right! And she has to do it quick and get herself back out there to be a mom. Kills me!
