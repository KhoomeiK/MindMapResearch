If you mandate people to go out of their way and spend money to sell to their family member or neighbor you will only increase back door, black market sales.

Open access will make private party sales safer."
science,ffdmld2,t1_ffdhnr7,1579824092.0,The FFL system already exists. The least they can do is give us access to it so we can have SAFE sales.

science,ffddj3b,t1_ffddc68,1579818609.0,"That's not really going to help either. .22 caliber bullets and 7.62 bullets are not much larger than each other if you look at the actual projectile sizes.

In addition .22 is probably MORE lethal because it goes into you and stops whereas a 7.62 will go through you and produce a cleaner wound."
science,ffddev4,t1_ffda8oj,1579818537.0,"> Want to buy a firearm? You need a form of ID, a background check, to wait 10 days, attend a safety class, and show you own a safe. Then it needs to be locked up, in said safe, when not in use. In some places it also can't have certain appearance features, and can't be a specific color.

I would _love_ if this were true. This is the kind of common sense regulation that many gun owners hope for. But alas, in Michigan at least, you can go and purchase a pistol with a background check and none of the other stuff you mentioned.

I had to apply for a concealed carry permit to be required to take a safety class, and at no point to they require you to own a safe. Yes, the gun is sold with a lock to prevent negligent discharge, but do they ever check?

You're more likely to be killed by negligent discharge than in a mass shooting, and that's something that we can _absolutely_ do something about."

science,ffdbsw9,t1_ffd9un3,1579817517.0,"AR-15 vs Ruger Mini 14. Same calibre, same essential function (semiautomatic long rifle). AR-15 looks ""tactical"" and scary black plastic, while the Ruger Mini 14 is wooden and looks like a ranch gun.

The AR-15 was banned, the Ruger Mini-14 was not. Their form and function are _exactly the same_. Same killing power, same bullet, same range.

Banning weapons on _cosmetic_ features like pistol grip, foregrips, or ""tacticool"" additions doesn't work."

Right now you're just kvetching with ""maybes"" and ""I think it might be this"" but you're unwilling to perform any tests to confirm that.

ClotSurvivors,ffcsode,t3_esr8jt,1579806459.0,"My experience with Eliquis has been similarly blessed. I do not participate in contact sport, but with my doctor's approval I was cleared to start running again a month after my DVT / PE diagnosis. I've kept it up and it's quite literally one of the only things keeping my anxiety in check at the moment.

Due to the bleed / injury risk of full contact fighting like BJJ you might need to transition your athleticism to something else. If running is of interest to you I highly suggest it!

Don't be afraid to seek out help for your anxiety. Lots of other commenters have mentioned the real possibility of PTSD or PTSD-like symptoms. Talk therapy and CBT (cognitive behavioral therapy) can really help you work through your fears and help you feel better. Find a local professional if that's something you feel could be useful for you."

ketochow,ffcpsqi,t1_ffceygv,1579804652.0,"FYI, the salmonella risk from eating cookie dough is actually from the flour, not the egg. TL;DR: don't eat raw flour.

>Why? Flour, regardless of the brand, can contain bacteria that cause disease. In 2016, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), along with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and state and local officials, investigated an outbreak of infections that illustrated the dangers of eating raw dough. Dozens of people across the country were sickened by a strain of bacteria called Shiga toxin-producing E. coli O121.

kzoo,ffcp4xj,t3_esteuq,1579804217.0,"Questions for you:

* Did you bring-your-own phone to AT&T? If so, are you sure they set it up correctly with the right information for your data connection?
* You might have a bad SIM card, they can replace it for you at the store. See if that helps.
* Since activating everything have you rebooted your phone? (sounds silly but fixes all sorts of stuff)
* Have you tested AT&T performance anywhere else to confirm it's only a problem _here_ ?

I'm also laughing that you think a 6-month old phone is ""too old"" ? The iPhone 11 Max Pro was only released in September of 2019."
