So yeah, that's what it was all for. Saving someone else's life."

WatchPeopleDieInside,ff6hwr9,t1_ff6hhvg,1579627561.0,Right? It seemed pretty obvious.

todayilearned,fegemt5,t3_eoyig0,1579090111.0,"I think it's just general preference? Doesn't really seem like something you'd call a ""syndrome"". If there were green dogs, nobody would pick them because they'd probably be really weird looking. And that's just preference, not really a ""syndrome"". Correct me if I'm wrong, though."

pcmasterrace,fdac4pk,t1_fd3y3ue,1578244417.0,"I installed the WD disk checking software, and so far it said it ""PASSED"" with a green check mark and all. I have also tried other things to fix the high disk usage or at least know what exactly is wrong with my disk, but nothing is presenting itself. The thing is, a benchmark website tells me that it's heavily under performing, so I don't really know why nothing shows up. I don't really know what to do, other than to have to buy a new one entirely."

pcmasterrace,fd2kxtf,t3_ejwzgv,1578148703.0,"I bought my computer on a budget about 2 years ago, and I (think) it has good parts, but lately it has been under performing. My main issue is that I'm always at 100% disk usage when playing certain games, causing micro-stutters (otherwise running perfectly at 60 fps in between stutters) and I'm not sure why. Do I need to upgrade a part? Or is there some way to know why my disk usage is always capped out? Whatever it is, I'd really like to fix it.
