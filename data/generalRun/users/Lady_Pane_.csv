I’m so unmotivated to finish this semester. I’m already so burnt out and it’s only the third week of school... good luck, though! You got this!"
college,ff4qo9s,t3_erfqro,1579570127.0,"It’s real tough, but once you get back to it, you wont have as much time to miss home. 

I came back for three days and I already dont wanna go back lol, but hey. I at least have the motivation to keep myself going because im transferring to a college thats significantly cheaper and closer to home.

As long as you remind yourself about how you’ll be back home sooner than you realize, I think you’ll be okay. I only have 10 weeks until I come back for Spring Break. Not too bad. And then after that, I’ll only have 4 weeks left before I can come home for good."
college,fe6qt0q,t3_envzzl,1578901044.0,"I’m sending you some good vibes, man.

I relate to a certain extent and made the call to transfer out of my current school because I just can’t imagine myself being here for four years and hating myself everyday because of it. Im lucky i’m just starting off and my parents understand that I need to put my mental health first before anything else.

Good luck, and I hope everything gets sorted out!"

I have to take a lot of walks around campus to get my mind off of all the emotions, but it’ll get better. Attend puppy therapy if your school provides it. Talk to some people.

Don’t forget to take care of yourself either. I was in a real bad funk and didnt eat or drink much, wasn’t a great way to start off.

Go kick ass this semester!"
collegeadvice,fdjaq76,t1_fdip0i4,1578463498.0,"I’ve tried making it more home-y and less crummy, but because it’s a federal vessel (belongs to the US Coast Guard) I can’t do much as almost anything is considered a fire or safety hazard. 

I’m also usually not like this. I like to think I’m fairly stable in new/unfamiliar environments, so I’m not sure why I’m feeling this way in particular. Regardless, I will look into possible grounding techniques and such.

Thanks so much for the advice! I’ll definitely think about it these next couple of months."
