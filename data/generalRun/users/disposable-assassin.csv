fountainpens,ffkt858,t3_etzcso,1580028453.0,"I just bought an Al-Star from this same store on Amazon and initially had doubts about authenticity before placing my order.  I thought their [web store](https://www.creoly.com/) looked legit enough so I bought the pen for $5 cheaper than the Sold By Amazon option.  The pen I received seems legit.  Pen was in a box inside a box with way more effort than a counterfeiter would probably do (die cut, ribbed texture, and embossed with box maker logo) and the silver printed inner box was color matched to the Lamy logo on the outer box despite the inner bog being on a white tag board and the outer a black rag. I don't think a counterfeiter would bother pantone system matching their silvers.  I walked into a Lamy physical store a week after receiving it, they tuned the nib, and handled it without saying something was off.  Body color matched the ones on the shelf. Between all those factors, I think it is legit.  Never going to be 100% sure.  

The main annoying thing with buying from Creoly US that wasn't apparent is that they ship from the UK using unregistered mail.  No tracking number.  I ordered on the 6th, it shipped the 7th and I got it in California around the 13th while their estimate was between the 16th and 29th.  Not bad but 2-day prime shipping has us spoiled."

NintendoSwitchDeals,fefgoho,t1_fedgxlc,1579055939.0,"Let's take a full example of each path step-by-step for a game that cost $40 regular price with 50% discount. 

Purchase Game on eshop:  

* buy $40 game for $20 on eshop
* game begins download on purchasing Nintendo account
* Receive 20 Gold Coins to Nintendo account that made the purchase. 

Purchase on HB:  

*  Buy $40 game for $20 on HB
*  Receive digital code for game 
*  go to eshop and redeem digital code (either yourself or send to someone else for redemption)
* Game begins download on redeeming Nintendo account 
* Receive **40** Gold Coins in the redeeming Nintendo account

So for me, the benefit is a transferable code.  The 40 coins versus 20 coins is probably negligible for most especially since it's got some added steps of go to HB, purchase, go to email, go to eshop, enter code versus go to eshop, purchase.  They can have my 20 cents."
bayarea,fef0t0d,t1_feeql1a,1579045508.0,There's gray one that always does a 3-point turn (but really like 15-pt) at Lombard and Baker. I don't know if I'm amazed at the balls or horrified that they can't circle a block instead.
beer,fedyit8,t1_fedt4ld,1579022586.0,That happened to me last year as well.  Forgot where it was but a week or so after SF beer week I walked into some random place and found PtY.  Big difference from the 1st time I had it and had to wake up at 5AM to get in line somewhere on the peninsula.
NintendoSwitchDeals,fed2c08,t1_fec5t7v,1578995221.0,"yeah, the difference is you get gold coins based on full price from HB while eshop is coins to match discount price.  This makes the most difference on Trials Raising Gold Ed. at $20, so an extra 20 coins. 20 cents off a future purchase. whooo hooo?  It's something but nothing that would make or break my decision.

I think you could also use a HB purchase code as a gift if you want to sent any of these to a friend.  I'm thinking of it for Hang On."
