wholesomememes,fdozobt,t1_fdov21c,1578616548.0,"wow. So, I'll give a defense of my first position, but at first glance here it **does** seem that you're right.

from [this](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4771005/) link (just the sidebar, i didn't read past it), this was the position I was coming from:

>1. Infants and toddlers prefer their mothers to their fathers when they seek solace or relief from hunger, fear, sickness, or some other distress;  
>  
>2.  Mothers tend to be more soothing;  
>  
>3.  Mothers are more responsive to the distinctive cries of infants: they are better able than fathers, for example, to distinguish between their baby's cry of hunger and cry of pain;  
>  
>4.  They are also better than fathers at detecting their children's emotions by looking at their faces, postures, and gestures. Not surprisingly, then,  
>  
>5.  Children who were deprived of maternal care during extended periods in their early lives “lacked feeling, had superficial relationships, and exhibited hostile or antisocial tendencies” as they developed into adulthood.

I'd never really looked into the scientific literature, and this whole issue is fairly new to me. I'll stay on the lookout for new information but I'm much more open to the idea of same-sex parenting than i was before. Thanks"

>femininity and masculinity are culturally defined.

I think this is partly true but not entirely, so I guess if there's a solution to be found it's in finding a final answer for this question. The traits of fem. and masc. are older than culture or any idea of them."
wholesomememes,fdoqg7u,t3_emgo6j,1578610545.0,"I'm all for gay rights and equality but what about children's rights? The idea of two fathers makes me uneasy. Humans are hardwired to have a mother and a father and it seems to me like the chances of healthy psychological development diminish with same-sex parents. Mind you, it may matter less than something like abusive parents, but I don't see how a child could develop a healthy relationship with femininity without the care of a mother figure."
