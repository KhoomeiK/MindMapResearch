MurderedByWords,fff6f6z,t1_fff3i3t,1579876894.0,I’m sure it must be legitimately but I dunno something about killing lions for sport just seems wrong. I’m getting downvoted about it but it’s just my opinion.

awfuleyebrows,fff0z1z,t1_ffanw07,1579872673.0,Is that a look tho? My mum used to line her lips and the lipstick would eventually rub off and she would have a line- not as ridiculous as this one. Do people now intentionally line their lips up to their nostrils with no lipstick?
