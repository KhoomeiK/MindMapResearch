It could not rewind, fast forward and only in extremely rare circumstances could expensive home decks record. Each track was only about 15 minutes long, so there were many cases where in order to fit an album on an 8-track, a song had to be cut in half.

I was so excited when I finally got to compare her first book, The Whicharts, to Ballet Shoes. I never thought I'd get a chance to read it myself, yet alone own my own copy someday! I am forever grateful to whomever worked out the rights for that reprint. For those not in the know, her very first book was for adults and was, in many ways, a story similar to Ballet Shoes but for adults. It only did well enough for her to keep writing. The reason original copies in any condition are so rare are that so few we're printed and what WWll did to London. After a quite a few books didn't find their audience, (someone important) suggested that she rework The Whicharts into a children's book. She wasn't happy about the idea, but obviously eventually did.

Though I also love the many, many, many books known as the Shoes Series (most out of print in the US for decades or longer), I also love the Gemma series, Thursday's Child and Far to Go, The Growing Summer, and When the Siren Wailed.

Two of her books written for adults that I really enjoy are Saplings (available as a reprint through Persephone Books) and Tops and Bottoms (not adult in THAT way and more of a YA style read). I was lucky to pick up Tops and Bottoms on eBay about 20 years ago and I'll never give it up, unless I'm offered quite a lot! (lol)

It's getting hard to believe that Ballet Shoes is almost 100 years old. Also, when I decided that it was about time I get my own ”Skating Shoes” in the 80s when I was in my 20s, skaters still had to learn some of the figures that Lalla had to learn, though those days were about to die.

Another thing that was different, even though there were plenty of math classes, College Algebra was as far as you could go.

AskOldPeople,fcpphu6,t3_ei55m9,1577869329.0,"To me, keeping up with new music and working in radio was totally intertwined. I always wanted to do radio and luckily was able to start doing it while still in high school, just not where I wanted to be. I listed to Album Rock and wanted more than anything to play that kind of music on the radio, but I never worked in that format. What I ended up doing was getting heavily into the music of every radio format I did work in for only as long as I worked in that genre. 

As much as I loved music, I loved radio more, so when I had to start out in an old fashioned country station, so be it. I learned to really respect then love the music. 

Then, between jobs, I got hired at a   station that played what most people would call Top 40 (we call it CHR) and I really blossomed there, so that became my home and my music for a while. I even took spent a little time playing dance leaning and even rap leaning Top 40 for a bit.

I ended my career back in country. There were less Top 40 stations by this time and the ”New Country"" movement had started so the same act I had on Top 40 worked on country radio now. I stopped following one type type of music and switched to another.

Once I left radio for good, I guess I there just wasn't much of a reason to care anymore. I'm sure that there is tons of good stuff out there though."
