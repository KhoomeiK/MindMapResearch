LateStageCapitalism,ffju54i,t1_ffjc9f8,1580007013.0,There will come a time where the property values start to plummet because no one will be around to keep the schools and commercial amenities open.
statenisland,ffinfzb,t3_etmrm0,1579978079.0,Why tho?
Mechwarrior5,ffdz4e3,t3_erlra9,1579832539.0,I see advancements in graphic design have also been lost in the Succession Wars.
CrappyDesign,ffdm9q2,t1_ffcp4v7,1579823892.0,People shouldn’t be criticizing this post when more than half the image is cropped out. Big difference in context between a wheat field and a shoreline.
MemeThatNews,ffak3bi,t1_ffac837,1579737703.0,"Because how it’s currently working out in America is doing wonders right? Especially San Francisco and New York City. Nothing like another luxury condo being built up to what should be a more affordable housing complex.

I suspect there was some sort of raid antagonistic to this subreddits ideals in this thread so let me be clear of something, while I acknowledge that some of r/latestagecapitalism is laughable dreck, there are certain truths underlining that is causing horrendous distrust in the current economic system. We can continue to shrug our shoulders sure, I mean, I’m fine now, I have a health plan, can afford vacations, but where will we be in 10 or 20 years when gentrification and inflation continue and wages cannot?"
MemeThatNews,ff95tba,t1_ff8ha00,1579705529.0,I would say that whatever I had stated in brackets is objectively defined as basic comfort. Anything beyond that is a luxury. Nobody said anything about happiness. There’s a fine line between being a socialist and being entitled to everything the world didn’t give you.
foxes,ff7o3fg,t3_erhq4w,1579654202.0,Looks like an extra from that music video of Korn’s “Word Up”
MemeThatNews,ff7mnqz,t1_ff5qkuw,1579653200.0,"A capitalism well regulated by a non-corrupt government IS the best answer. That’s not what countries like the USA are today. I’d like nothing more than a guaranteed, at the minimum, basic comfortable life (housing, nights out, healthcare, 20% into savings) as long as you put in for a 40 hour workweek... that’s it."
LateStageCapitalism,feov5sh,t3_eq1kc9,1579306110.0,Difference is he’ll settle for half the cookie you have. So Isn’t our jobs getting outsourced for cheaper foreign labor supposed to be avoided? Not sure if this comic is sending the right message.
animation,feo7dh4,t3_eq1ko4,1579296135.0,Have you posted this before? I remember seeing this elsewhere.
funny,felbv2a,t3_epfa1b,1579218531.0,That chair looks so uncomfortable tho
justneckbeardthings,feblzc8,t1_feavjvi,1578960193.0,"I disagree. I thought Rey was a dull Mary Sue. Her character didn’t evolve, she didn’t have much of any obstacle to overcome. She kicked Kylo Ren’s ass in the first movie and she barely held a lightsaber let alone train with one. Her action scenes left no excitement because I couldn’t anticipate a possible failure. It felt like she had an answer to everything.

I’m not justifying the screenshot you posted to be clear, there are great examples of interesting female heroines like Sarah Connor or Ellen Ripley."

LateStageCapitalism,fcohieg,t1_fcoae1c,1577832355.0,"New Yorker here. My mother’s a teacher and she gets home at 3:30. She works 8 hours. Hardly working 12 hour days aside from PTA nights twice a year my friend. And he’s right, they do get excellent benefits so much so that my mother encouraged me multiple times to get a city job."
statenisland,fcog68u,t3_eh968a,1577831443.0,"Taken a weekend boat last Sunday. Didn’t notice anything to that degree, but I’ve always found that once every 4 or 5 times they’re 5 - 10 minutes late regardless of day."
LateStageCapitalism,fcneuq9,t3_ei0qjb,1577810280.0,So getting caught for doing 75 in a 50 highway is now considered oppressive capitalism? Gee I didn’t realize fighting an establishment required me to put myself in danger from reckless drivers.
facepalm,fclq9st,t1_fcklhy3,1577753849.0,"It’s Billboard tho, this is probably a list of songs that has been #1 on the charts the longest / radio circulation. Radio music had no relevance to me the last 10 or so years."

Mechwarrior5,fcl9gi6,t1_fcjs17u,1577742702.0,I had a rare Shadow Hawk next to a somewhat damaged Shadow Hawk (no lost weapons) for about 1.2m cheaper. I ended up purchasing the damaged one and even with the repairs it came out on top in value by more than half.
