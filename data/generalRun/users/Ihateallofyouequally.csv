My doctors tried to get rid of them for 10 years before giving up. They gave me all sorts of medications thinking it was a fungal infection but nothing worked. Eventually my doctor just called it a mystery pigmentosa. I don't really mind though. They're just oversized freckles on my chest and back. Never looked more into it since in ten years nothing happened, my doc just keeps and eye on them."
spartanrace,ff158y5,t3_er1lla,1579475347.0,"Looked it up, you can send your medical bills for a race injury in for it. They cover 100k after a 500 deductible, after your medical insurance. Probably deters lawsuits since your medical bills are paid already."
AskReddit,fewk1zc,t1_ferquji,1579412300.0,My mom lived in West Berlin after WWII and told us it reminded her of nazi Germany and the soviets in East Berlin. She always encouraged us not to do it and would give any teacher that gave us trouble a history lesson. She's very touchy about nationalism.
AskReddit,fesz84d,t1_fer8t0y,1579370387.0,"You sound like the cops from my hometown. The town is famous for weed, but there were never weed arrests. The cops would show up, scare the crap outta kids smoking in the woods, maybe joke around with them and then just let them go with a warning.

Cops in my hometown mostly worked search and rescue for lost/injured hikers. They town didn't care what locals did as long as no one got hurt."
MaliciousCompliance,fep6ebg,t1_feoiovg,1579313162.0,"I think this is honestly the most appropriate reaction to being dress coded. If you have to work to make it inappropriate, it's not inappropriate you're just a creep."
science,feneu0v,t1_fen3p0o,1579283164.0,I got it despite being vaccinated. Coughed so hard I passed out of my kitchen floor. My bf was scared. The nurse I saw at the doctor was even scared when I had a fit in the office. It's a terrifying sickness to get. A superbug version is even scarier.
BeautyBoxes,felzhob,t1_felpirf,1579234994.0,"Jeffrey has a long list of issues, particularly with racism. Here's a link to them: [Beauty Guru Breakdown](https://www.reddit.com/r/BeautyGuruChatter/comments/bduvox/a_comprehensive_list_of_jeffree_stars_many/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share)"
BeautyBoxes,fel6t7q,t1_fekgr9t,1579215296.0,"She's a total neonazi. She's made a lot of racist and antisemitic posts and comments. She dated a literal neonazi. Burned the star of David and is pretty openly antisemitic. Oh, she named one of her lipsticks after the term for selection in concentration camps. 

I've been boycotting her for ages and Jeffrey star too. There was a video that came out of Jeffrey star being racist and a bunch of her following that one.

That woman is awful. Being vegan doesn't obsolve you from being a shit person."
facepalm,fel0xho,t1_fek6kul,1579211688.0,I could see it. My friend spent 60k on a culinary school associates. So 119k doesn't seem to crazy by comparison.

SweatyPalms,feesu8g,t1_fee3q7o,1579040469.0,"I'm a climber so I'll assure you, you are correct and this guy is talking out his ass. I'm no expert climber but I know enough to call bullshit. 

 1. This isn't belaying 2. The friction for a belay is in the wrap and belay device (atc, grigri ect). Friction from an edge is not good, it damages the rope. 3. An anchor should always have a redundancy, so two anchoring points 4. I wouldn't consider a bucket a good single anchoring point. It should be something static that's not movable. 

There's so many other issues but I'm specifically addressing your point."

I, being the child of a lawyer, used the fact my parents never signed a contract only me, a minor (at the time) therefore unable to sign a binding contract, to threaten my school into giving my phone back. My dad supported this because understanding how contracts work is important."

notliketheothergirls,fdwgkae,t1_fdvlfjx,1578758424.0,"It's a disservice to men that basic hygiene is seen as bad. Skincare, soap, haircare, razers, fragrance, lotion ect should all be gender less. 

My bf adopted a lot of my products after we moved in together. His skin is so much better. Poor man was using some shitty working man's hand cream (that's the name) for his eczema and using regular soap on his face. Why is basic lotion feminine, everyone gets dry skin! Masculinity is too damn fragile, I can't handle it my hands are too calloused."
AskReddit,fdli5yd,t1_fdkf53u,1578524543.0,It's not the pain but lack of sleep. Had that with severe itbs. Fine when I wasnt moving but I kept waking myself up moving my knee or hip. Didn't sleep more than an hour at a time for 4 days til I got in to see a doctor.

science,fdadxtw,t1_fd9r53v,1578245011.0,The article suggests boys are more sensitive in utero. I would suspect they're more sensitive to hormones since all fetuses develop female first. Or it could just be some epigenetic trigger on the x chromosome. Boys are more sensitive to genetics on the x chromosome since they only have the one. More research is clearly needed.

mildlyinfuriating,fd33tdu,t1_fd0nr91,1578154474.0,"I've literally only ever seen metro discounts but that's it. Not too useful in rural America. 

Unless you're under the poverty line, there don't seem to be disability discounts despite life with a disability being more expensive.  Most everything I need for my disability is at a premium. 

I could do with some tailoring/clothing discounts. Or like gaming discounts so I could get one of those adaptive controllers. Or at the store on prechopped veggies. Ya know the stuff I have to get instead of the normal version."

science,fcspqwb,t1_fcrsv5o,1577922005.0,In grad school we were working with census data to determine who groups voted for.  I had a lot of trouble getting a unique variable. Religiousness and lack of understanding of science kept coming up as exactly the same and being republican. I forget what other variables I was working on but I remember freaking out thinking I was going to fail because I couldn't get three unique variables to do my analysis.

facepalm,fc92qae,t1_fc87eiy,1577546077.0,"So my mom lived in Berlin shortly after ww2. At the time nationalism was very, very tabu. Things like the national anthem before school just didn't happen. She only lived in Germany until she was 12 maybe but this stuck with her. 

She  finds the national anthem and pledge of allegiance very disturbing and would tell us not to participate. Even in the 90s just sitting down caused outrage. I was screamed at in high school for it once, told them to call my mom to be chewed out about it. I think someone who knew my mom warned the teacher because the call never came and they never said anything again."
DiWHY,fc4jywz,t1_fc3tor7,1577418874.0,"Loaned? You can buy them in most pharmacies. I've never heard of a hospital loaning them before.  

I find in truth they just pass from person to person. I got mine from a coworker, who got them from a relative. They went to my mom and then onto a friend. They'll likely travel to another person with a broken ankle or sprained knee from there. Maybe someday they'll be a bookshelf too though these wooden ones actually look nice."
AnimalTextGifs,fc41rj1,t1_fc3r1fi,1577404356.0,"I was looking for something like this. I wouldn't want any puppy around a baby but especially high energy dogs like huskies. 

The huskies reaction is cute now but totally unacceptable in a month or two. He can do serious damage to that child accidentally. I have a scar on my nose from an excited big dog. He wanted to play but I was only 4, so his jumping did a lot of damage. Knew someone who's dog accidentally ruined their daughter's face playing, she needed lots of plastic surgery.

Like I love dogs, but I've met very few owners who train their dogs well and I worry in cases like this one. Huskies are not a dog for most people, and I'm saying this as someone that grew up with equally high energy dogs."

AskReddit,fc1zmez,t1_fc1g381,1577334798.0,Same thing for me. Ended up just being really severe gerd. I have a list of foods to avoid and some meds and it's so much better. Went from throwing up 5+times a day to not at all some days. When it started I dropped to 90 pounds and thought I was dying. Took 10 years to diagnose and every test under the sun.
starterpacks,fc0ix7m,t1_fc0eces,1577291845.0,It's just old and out of date. Something they probably got for free. I'm not in Germany but I've seen many a frat house with similar tables they got on a curb.
femalefashionadvice,fbwfhyj,t1_fbulgu9,1577148552.0,I do this too! But because I have bad blood flow. My arms are cold but my torso is warm.
