It felt like my life was ruined, and briefly it was, and like there was nothing left for me after almost five years of insane work and things I wish I hadn't been through. Thankfully I recovered fairly quickly and found new purpose in helping my family and friends support themselves. Without them in my life I'm not sure what I'd do.
  
Last year though I did almost cry when my dog I'd had since childhood died."

It's just very easy to see your defensiveness as sensitivity towards people shit talking Nazis. Also, and I'd typically never play this card, but I don't need to wait for depression, the cancer will probably kill me first. Have a good one man! :)"

DnD,ffgf5p4,t1_fff4ee3,1579904854.0,"An excellent question that was hotly debated during the original campaign.
  
The theocrats made a case for mutual faith and the merchants relied heavily on their support whereas the peasants, constantly trampled by the will of the many churches and cults, had begun to generally reject religion. This led to the paladins favoring the merchants as they promised democracy while maintaining the churches and freedom of religion (as opposed to the theocratic factions who were monarchical and oligarchical and the peasants who wanted the churches' influence minimized). One paladin actually wanted to stop fighting peasants after an important NPC ominously left the party because of it."

DnD,fff5om7,t1_fff2zd6,1579876354.0,"I credit Seth's (Kah'Min) persuasiveness. He swayed a lot of people to the peasants' cause and by the end people were wishing they'd sided with them to see what's happened. The NPC that saved the druid actually is strongly on the peasants' side and leaves the party if you don't side with them and will fight you if you side with a democratic faction then switch to a non-democratic one, so his leaving already sparked some questioning of morals within the party. 
  
At the end I think people were feeling bad for fighting the popular will and killing peasants. The paladin said he was feeling guilty for killing a friend too. Seth is pretty zealous irl, too (for similar causes) and has actually converted a handful of his friends to our side politically, so you can imagine how into the rp he got when advocating for democracy in dnd.
  
Edit, just messaged him and asked why he didn't keep his character alive to fight alongside Kah'Min. He said that as he recalls he though about what his character would do and, based on the frame of mind he was in just as a player, determined that he wouldn't have been able to go on after watching all of his friends die but knew that Kah'Min would have the strength to help forge a new great nation.
  
So rp basically. Though it's worth pointing out that his character had been through massive wars in the time between the original campaign and the follow up, so the it does fit the MO of a PTSD riddled 60 year old hardened soldier."
