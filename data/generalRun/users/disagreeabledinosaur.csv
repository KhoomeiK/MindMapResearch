minimalism,felzikm,t3_epm13p,1579235015.0,"I see a lot of people suggesting heated drying racks and de humidifiers. In general those things consume almost as much or more energy than a decent A++ rated heat pump dryer. Do the math carefully and honestly if you go that route. By honestly I mean don't put down that you'll leave the dehumidifier running for 6 hours if in reality it'll be overnight which will be 10 hours etc.

Drying clothes indoors without either adequate ventilation (tends to push heating bills up) or a dehumidifier tends to lead to condensation problems and mould in your house. There's a lot of water released in drying clothes.

Honestly, spin your clothes well in the washing machine and get yourself a very energy efficient dryer. Dryers these days are not the energy hungry beasts they used to be."

Mullen has a cohort of people who vote for him. I can't see that increasing much.

Mullen gets his current 7K votes. He'll pick up some transfers, in the last election it took him 26 counts to pick up the 2K he needed to get the old 9k quota and thus elected.  Aside from those who voted for him as number 1, he was slow to pick up transfers. McDowell started almost 2K votes behind him and got elected on the same count.
