RandomActsofCards,feysoox,t3_eqt2hd,1579450129.0,"What a cool offer. I really need to up my  game and start making cards. Your sample card looks great! I'm interested in this offer.

I would say the most influential writer for me is Joanna Macy. She started in the 70s with what she called Despair Work to get people acquainted with their fears about nuclear war. She would help them connect with that pain and fear and transform it into non-violent activism. She is 90 now, and still going strong.  Her focus in the last 30+ years has been motivating people on climate action. She is so inspiring to me and gives me hope in these dark times.

loseit,fej0pbv,t3_epe7ep,1579152749.0,"Hi! Brave post, so kudos on that. The tone, especially in the last paragraph, made me think that there are a few other subs where you might find additional support beyond this one (although this one is great!). First, since you have a history of exercise, you could look at r/EOOD, which is exercise out of depression. I know I'm just guessing here but you sound like you're depressed and not valuing yourself much. You might find something useful there.

Next is r/DecidingToBeBetter, which is exactly what it sounds like. You may find support there as well. The last is r/theXeffect, where you can choose a small change to move you forward, commit to it to the group and post your progress. I think it's worth a look. 

It's easy to get caught up in everything you're doing wrong but that won't get you anywhere. Instead, find one small thing you can change and work to master that. Grow your skills. Keep moving forward!"

Meditation,fd56xev,t3_ek1qmc,1578174806.0,"I have started working with a program called the Work that Reconnects. It was started by Buddhist scholar Joanna Macy. 

The program introduces a spiral that travels through grounding in gratitude, honoring pain, seeing with new eyes and going forth. Although not all those involved are Buddhists, the people I've met there have a strong love of Earth and want to positively contribute to protecting the planet. (You can find more information at www.workthatreconnects.org or PM me.) Work with this group and facing the realities of climate change head on have been very helpful to me."

I think our biggest and healthiest changes come when we take the risk to look into the darkness in our lives, stand firmly and see what those experiences can teach us. Numerous philosophers and teachers talk about the value of this. You are at a crossroads that is also a point of strength. Seize this moment to better yourself. Treat yourself with love, care and acceptance. A gratitude practice right now can help you ground your experience and move forward. Start the New Year bravely!  I wish you the best."

My dog would occasionally lunge at my husband unexpectedly. He would nip or show his teeth, too. We have stopped this completely by changing how we interact and what we allow. First, the dog is no longer allowed on the bed. I don't allow him in my lap. My husband has taken over feeding duties. At first, this was really hard because I love my dog and love to cuddle him. He was a bit pouty and confused at first. Surprisingly, it's straightened him right up. I think it helped clarify the pecking order in the house. Aside from breaking my heart a bit, it's been good."
