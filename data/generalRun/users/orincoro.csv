smallbusiness,ffup9ct,t1_ffuo8f0,1580246684.0,"Which is why I charge a day rate. As a contractor I am usually making twice what the in-house people are making, and I work half as much. But I’m the one who gets the job done, which is why I’m useful. I’m usually the one guy who can clearly lay out the plan and put everybody on task. And I have enough experience that I can easily give juniors the fundamentals to learn how to think correctly and clearly about problems to solve them. You end up as much a coach as a creative. 

As I told somebody today on a team I’m working with: “don’t be fooled, I don’t know how to do any of this stuff, I just know what the result should be, and I’ll make sure we get there,” 

I’ve learned it helps to delegate if you don’t hang around looking over their shoulders. Let junior people figure things out and just advise them on the finishing touches. You get the best of what they can do; and make sure it works to your standards."
smallbusiness,ffuowyg,t1_ffukrtf,1580246490.0,It takes creativity just to formulate a response to someone asking about a problem. So letting you stew on the problem for a while clears your issues with expressing it.
EnoughMuskSpam,ffuonph,t1_ffubpgj,1580246343.0,Oh I know.
smallbusiness,fftnqjv,t1_fftniiu,1580225153.0,"That sounds too informal for me. If I were running a creative agency, I would have a strict 5 hour policy. Lights on at 8am. Everyone in the office. Lights out at 1pm. Everyone out. A few digital agencies have started doing this, and productivity improves. You also save money on office management, electricity, food, etc."
smallbusiness,fftmlnw,t1_fftdgrw,1580224385.0,"Yeah I’ve learned to do the same with developers I’m working with. I’ll come in on a Thursday or Friday and ask “what would it take to....” This usually prompts them to say how complicated it is and how it will take a lot of work. then I’ll tell them “don’t worry about it right now. Let’s talk Monday.” 

Then Monday comes and I bring it up, they’ve completely forgotten about it, but suddenly the answer is fairly simple. Just having that problem in their subconscious makes them more able to solve it when you ask again. It works like crazy. I can’t believe more people don’t do this.

Developers don’t want their work to seem easy either, so by letting them have some time, they are less invested in showing you how hard it is. They just do it."
smallbusiness,fftm1nn,t1_fftf9dp,1580223998.0,"The worst thing is working for someone who does this and then resents you for not doing it. It never occurs to them that they waste most of their own time this way, but they need you to waste yours as well."
smallbusiness,fftlwsv,t1_fftle3o,1580223904.0,"This is why I also work for myself. When I am contracting I plainly say I work 4-5 hours a day, not more. I’m a dad and I also have my own business (I don’t count that as work though). That means I’m in at 10 and out the door at 3. If you want something else, hire someone else.

I can do this because I have a good reputation in my field and clients who need me. I’m sure it wouldn’t work for everyone. But I simply ask for the same money they would expect to pay for 8-10 hours a day. That’s my rate.

The great thing about that is you can delegate much more because your client values your time. They preserve better, pay attention to your requests and everyone gets more done."

smallbusiness,ffrfnox,t1_ffrfii3,1580157146.0,You’re what we call a congenital bullshitter. Another time waster. At least you can never say you haven’t been told.

Nobody mocked your English or your lack of success. You brought yourself up as an example. That’s my problem. Stop fucking bullshitting and have some humility.

smallbusiness,ffrdsyf,t1_ffrdgc4,1580156026.0,You cannot stop can you? You can’t listen. You have to spin everything into your little universe where everything orbits you. Just shut the fuck up. Read 10x more than you write.

smallbusiness,ffrcqfl,t1_ffrcnxy,1580155359.0,"No. The post is just lame and generic and lazy. I despise you for what it represents about you.

You’re a person who wrote a “book” on success and you’re pumping a post about making $10 on patreon. I can’t describe how disgusted I feel.

But fuck it, I’ll give you some advice anyway. People with real experience and wisdom know that they don’t know many universal truths. They are parsimonious with their advice because they realize that without having been in someone’s shoes, it’s hard to advise them in a way that *serves them* and not yourself. What you’ve written is all about serving you and your ego. You don’t know how to help others and you aren’t trying to. You’re trying to make yourself look and feel good.

And it’s obvious. And in being obvious, it’s pathetic."
smallbusiness,ffrc6au,t1_ffrc3li,1580155017.0,"You couldn’t have demonstrated my point more clearly. Pathetic.

Look, I don’t despise you because you’re unsuccessful. I despise you because you’re one of those people who is so uncreative he thinks success comes to those who convince others they’re successful. That’s fucking sad.

You’ve spent time and a lot of effort here trying to make yourself look like an authority, and you’ve achieved the opposite. You’re a whiner, and a loser."

So busy telling others how easy everything is you never do anything notable of your own. Selling yourself because nothing else in the world could possibly be more interesting. Yuck. 

 The verbose replies full of more self regard and nebulous references to your “works” just reinforce the impression of a bullshitter who can’t imagine how transparent he is."

personalfinance,ffqr3ur,t1_ffpbowf,1580141695.0,"To an extent this also applies to the thinking of managers. You don't necessarily want to promote from within because someone who has been with the company for a long time has a set idea of what their job is and what they're entitled to. You do get kind of stuck with being the guy who does whatever you do. Promoting them above that position may not be productive if they don't have that kind of relationship with their coworkers and are used to a different level of responsibility. 

I can see that even in my own career. At some points, you've done too much for the employer to keep rising because you sort of wear too many hats already. It's better to move on and have them reassess everything you were responsible for and hire someone (or more than one person) to replace you. When I left my last job, they hired two people to replace me. They ended up spending more, but it took two to do what I was doing. In the end that's probably going to be better for them."
