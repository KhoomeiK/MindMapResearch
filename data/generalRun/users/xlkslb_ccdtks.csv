It was apparently an ""on a whim"" decision which is why (I assume) she got it on a part of her body that doesn't let tattoos stay around for a long time."
todayilearned,ffpxsfo,t1_ffpluxg,1580110067.0,"She said she thought it was funny and didn't mind. If anything, everyone else was more whiney about it than she was."

nextfuckinglevel,ffbr3fl,t1_ffbanhq,1579779389.0,I love when reddit gets caught up on something so harmless.
PublicFreakout,ffbq6vq,t1_ffbajdc,1579778201.0,That's besides the point though. And being a bigger person doesn't equal being a better fighter.

popheads,fez3q3v,t3_eqtwg6,1579453590.0,Discovered Ashnikko's 'Hi It's Me' and absolutely fell in love only to find out the rest of her discography doesn't sound anything like it and pales in comparison.

kpop,felt0y4,t1_fejd6cm,1579230209.0,This gets commented everytime a collab between a man and woman idol is announced.
