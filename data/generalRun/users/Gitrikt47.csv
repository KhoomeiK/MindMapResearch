AskAnAmerican,fdffrfi,t3_ekv0wh,1578360657.0,"I feel that most young Americans have no idea about everything that happened.  I consider myself to be a history enthusiast and it wasn't until I was 30 and watched Ken Burns' ""The Vietnam War"" that I realized my public education left out an awful lot about the conflict.

From Johnson trying to save face to Nixon keeping the war going, I was in shock that our government would keep sending our troops to take a hill with blood and force, only to abandon it in some trivial manner.  People/National Guard in the US shooting students(not just in Kent, OH) due to their opposition of the war.  I ask every co-worker under the age of 30 about it and they look at me like lobsters are crawling out of my ears.  

To any human reading this, please research what happens when your government wants to save face instead of save you."

Two party system works for them because there is a have and a have not and they use that to rally their respective bases(Keep control or, conversely, take it back). Most Americans aren't true Republican or true Democrat. The reason two party systems don't work for the people is because they've divided their platforms so much that there is little compromise anymore. You're either with one side of an issue or against it."

The people seem genuine and are nicer than people from here to your face, not necessarily the case behind your back. Ohio has lots to do in the cities and farms everywhere else.
