iphone,ffc285k,t1_ffc1tns,1579789701.0,"I mean the passcode protects user data, not the OS. What protects the OS is apple's code signing key (among other things). So this is kind of the same issue as the FBI one. They would have to build a legit signed ios version with a backdoor that would allow easy access to root. And then once it gets out everyone's security is fucked."
iphone,ffc1o5o,t1_ffc158p,1579789285.0,"I guess it would be the same as the ""encryption backdoor"" issue, where if apple does something to easily access the root, then any bad actor would be able to do the same.

I'm also interested to see what the final word will be. There's a big difference between whatsapp spilling its data because of a bug, and the whole OS being compromised remotely without user interacion"
iphone,ffc0u7b,t1_ffbzjy0,1579788654.0,"From some further research, it looks like Pegasus will stop and remove itself if it can't root the ios device, so the phone may actually have in fact been compromised just by that video file that didn't even need to be opened. That's scary stuff.

Still, we don't know for certain that it even was pegasus"

From the looks of it, any app can call nsurlsession and so could be used without an OS exploit. Exfil with mobile safari would be another story, though"
iphone,ffbw3yn,t1_ffbtfyt,1579784720.0,"Looks like the media once again is spouting inaccurate statements. Here is the text verbatim from the report:

>Advanced mobile spyware, such as NSO Group's Pegasus"" or Hacking Team's Galileo, can hook into 
legitimate applications and processes on a compromised device as a way to bypass detection and 
obfuscate activity in order to ultimately intercept and exfiltrate data. The success of techniques such 
as these is a very likely explanation for the various spikes in traffic originating from Bozos' device. For 
example, more than 6GB of egress data was observed using exfiltration vectors such as nsurlsession, 
Mobile Safari, and Apple's email client following the initial spike on May 2, 2018. It should be noted that 
these types of advanced Cyber tools are typically employed by sophisticated nation-state actors. An 
investigation into Saudi Arabian sponsored hacking activity demonstrates many examples of 
sophisticated espionage tools such as those provided by NSO Group or Hacking Team being used to 
spy on dissidents and political adversaries. 

So mobile safari and the email client are potential exfiltration vectors, but it doesn't mean that the OS was compromised and that they were in fact being used.

Also:

>FTI will gain access to and conduct a forensic examination of the root filesystem of Bezos' 
iPhone X byjailbreaking it prior to analysis. Advanced weapons grade mobile malware 
typically installs itself to the root filesystem of a device to maintain persistence and avoid 
detection. Identifying evidence of malicious artifacts on this portion of the device could 
validate if an infection existed and corroborate evidence presented in this report. 

and

>FTI also conducted an in-depth investigation of the artifacts related to the iPhone X's logical file 
system from the redacted Cellebrite report, and audited 274,515 directories, subdirectories, and 
filenames. Special care was taken to identify evidence of jailbreaking28 tools and known iOS exploits 
tools.29 After a comprehensive review of the logical file system and a validation of all false positives, 
FTI assesses with medium confidence that no evidence of these types of tools were identified on 
Bezos' iPhone X to date. As previously stated, lack of evidence of malicious tools of this nature does 
not refute their existence since sophisticated malware often contains self-destruction capabilities 
that may activate if certain conditions or objectives are met. 

So really, they don't know if the OS was compromised. Which would be necessary for exfiltration using mobile safari or the email client."
mildlyinteresting,ffaz33e,t1_ffaycoj,1579747822.0,"Yeah now any tweaks will probably be undone by a forced version upgrade, so it hardly feels worthwhile going through the list of services and disabling the ones you don't need or whatever.

iphone,ffa7ah5,t1_ffa63ok,1579729268.0,"Nope, it was solely constrained within whatsapp and whatever whatsapp had access to, as far as I can tell. So the iPhone did its part in being secure in this instance. But whatsapp usually has access to a lot of things: mic, camera, photos, contacts, for obvious reasons.

This flaw is also not limited to just iphones, it affects android versions of whatsapp as well: https://www.zdnet.com/article/attackers-using-whatsapp-vulnerability-triggered-by-video-files-can-remotely-execute-code/
