And now notice the wording ""the Rules Committee."" Notice that is the committee it refers to when it says it can do an investigation to determine whether a more thorough investigation is warranted by another committee.

What it really implies is that the Rules Committee powers to investigate are not strictly limited but rather that they can determine whether a more thorough investigation is warranted by a committee with expertise. There is no restrictions/restraints on their subpoena power stated.

But more importantly, notice the next sentence. It reads ""Second, any committee that might have jurisdiction of any matter that could amount to an impeachable offense may conduct an investigation without waiting for the rules Committee.""

That is a pretty clear statement another committee can do the more thorough investigation without involvement from the Rules Committee. So your main argument is simply wrong.

And even your attempt to move the goal posts to an argument about executive privilege falls flat. The Supreme Court has ruled that executive privilege cannot be used to cover up criminal activity. 

And lastly, your statement about being innocent until proven guilty does not apply here as this is not a criminal trial. It is a trial strictly limited to determining whether the president should be removed from office. The Constitution is quite clear about that."

politics,ffv1b19,t1_ffuylxm,1580253398.0,"Okay. But I don't see where in that response that you answered my question. The question was, where in the Constitution does it say a House resolution is required to authorize the House Judicial Select Committee to issue subpoenas related to impeachment? I've read the Constitution many times and have never seen anything suggesting what you're claiming. So I would still like an answer about that.

However, to address what you did say...

>Article I, Section 2, Clause 5: The House of Representatives shall chuse their Speaker and other Officers; and shall have the sole Power of Impeachment.

Which is exactly what happened. The House voted to impeach the president. It held an investigation with both major parties paticipating on the committees. Then the House held a full House vote where it was decided to exercise the constitutional power of the House to impeach the president.

Now, if I understand what you're suggesting it appears to be that somehow a congressional investigation would take place. But once that investigation starts to uncover wrongdoing by the president that might merit impeachment, the investigation must immediately stop until the House holds a formal vote to continue the investigation. Do I have that right? I hope not because that sounds like complete nonsense to me.

The author himself conceded he concentrates on his chosen reason and overlooks other reasons. See the footnote on page 24. *""Besides the small-state interest in equal representation, two other factors (outside the scope of this article) were also in play, breaking the Convention along North-South and East-West lines. These were slavery and new states...Morris, always less cautious, tied these issues together, hinting at the trouble that northern majorities,proportionally represented, might cause for southern slavery (July 7, 1:552).

>By being non-proportional; it balances power between large and small states.

Which is ridiculous since we are not a confederacy of states. We are a republic of people. So your argument about California having more power falls flat because it ignores that it also has more people. If all the people of California were a homogeneous unit, your argument would have merit. But the lines of the map do not divide people of different cultures and heritages. A person can literally live across the street from someone on the other side of a state border. There is no reason one of their votes should have more power than their neighbor's. Assigning so much importance to the states makes no sense at all. Let states have the power to control what happens within their borders as long as it does not contradict the rules defined by the majority at the national level."

PoliticalHumor,feog6jh,t1_feodxga,1579299649.0,"You're making a false argument. I never claimed it was designed to be purely democratic. My three main arguments were that the Senate should be non-proportional, that there are too few Representatives in the House, and the founders wanted and created a strong central government.

And you did not directly respond to Madison's clear statement it was an issue between the slave and non-slave states, not large and small states."
PoliticalHumor,feobxn3,t1_fenkg7q,1579297920.0,"A republic is a form of government in which power resides in the body of citizens through elected representatives. Nothing about that definition implies some people's votes should have more power than others. That is a failing in our current system.

And it had everything to do with slaves states. During the debates, when James Madison was arguing *against* a non-proportional Senate, he made the real issue perfectly clear *""It seemed now to be pretty well understood that the real difference of interests lay, not between the large and small but between the Northern and Southern States. The institution of slavery and its consequences formed the line of discrimination.""*



And the Senate was implemented as part of the same Connecticut Compromise which gave us slave states getting to count 3/5 of a person towards representation for each slave they owned. 

And do you realize Texas has a far bigger population than New York? So does Florida. In fact, you have to take the largest nine states to get over half the population. So every single person in all nine of those states would have to vote a like for the people of New York and California to get their way. See how stupid that argument is?

And no, the Constitution was written to establish the laws of the country and create a system of government where the people would have the power to govern themselves. And its number one goal was to create a system that would work towards promoting the general welfare of the greater masses of people."

Got some evidence of that?

That is ridiculous. There is so much evidence against that it really is just silly. Look at what they did in Clinton's first term for an example.

>Watch what happens if they get the Senate and White House again, it will probably be the same as it was in Obama's first term. 

If they have Mitch McConnell and the republicans using the minority powers of the Senate to obstruct, that will probably be true. But that is not the democrats corruption. That is the republicans being obstructionist assholes.

No. It was basically the Massachusetts democratic legislatures plan. Romney vetoed a number of its key provisions. They were only passed because the legislature overrode his vetoes."
