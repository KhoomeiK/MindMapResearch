realwitchcraft,fgek8vv,t1_fg737ec,1580701540.0,"That's funny you mention promises. As I mentioned in my above comment, I had an interesting experience today which drew on that idea of making promises to her.

Thank you so much for the advice! If you don't mind explaining, how do you make an effigy of her? And why do you eat those specific foods?"
realwitchcraft,fgek3rk,t1_fg5wzqm,1580701435.0,"Thank you so much! This is great advice. I appreciate it. It's funny; I've been feeling too depressed to do much lately, and as I was walking my dogs today, I was feeling this welling up of regret over not doing anything special for Imbolc since I am trying to expand and develop my faith. As soon as I started feeling sad and guilty, especially because I want to build this relationship with Brigid, I felt this soft peace wash over me, telling me it was ok- I hadn't promised anything. It felt very comforting and nurturing and helped to quell my guilt. Of course, I do still plan to work on this. But it was just a nice moment."

Reduction,fgej88z,t1_fgefzg6,1580700804.0,"Hi! Thanks for replying. I just responded earlier to someone else about this very thing. I did have this done over a series of months. I eventually stopped going because they were painful and because I had some damage from the injections that resulted in thinning of the skin and discoloration. Maybe I should go back, though."
Reduction,fgej3u0,t1_fgdjo3o,1580700717.0,Thanks for your response! Maybe I will try this one. I have tried Scar Away and Recedo so far.

Reduction,fgej1qh,t1_fgaxjz3,1580700675.0,"Hi! Thanks for your reply! I actually did see a dermatologist for a while for these scars. I got a series of injections over several months. Parts of my scars did flatten, but not all of them, and I actually had the... Elasticity? Integrity? Not sure of the term, but there was some structural damage from the injections at one point that caused thinning of my skin in that area and discoloration. I was also prescribed Recedo. I stopped going because the injections were super painful and I was afraid of more issues from the injections. Maybe I should go back..."
