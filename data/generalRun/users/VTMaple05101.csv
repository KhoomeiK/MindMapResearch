raisedbynarcissists,ffa0otl,t3_ese2us,1579725520.0,"I think that it can be very very hard for someone that was raised in a "" normal"" home . To understand someone that was not. My sons father was raised in a family that hadn't ever even had a divorce. He was born and raised in the same home. Had the same routine every day of his life until he moved out. He had the normalcy and support I wished I could have. So, when he started dating a young woman who at 22 was just craving stability and suffered from horrible insecurity due to having none in childhood. He couldn't relate. The people you are talking too may not be able to understand what a disfunctional relationship looks like. Please dont allow what others say to in any way invalidate your life experiences."
insaneparents,ff62pti,t1_ff62ftp,1579617638.0,"I was asked to leave the group because I was too argumentative. They literally all get together and pat each other on the back for their horrible families not understand how much they do for them..lol. I don't understand how a therapyst could sit their and let them stroke their egos. And I said so, That's what made me "" Argumentative"""
insaneparents,ff62e69,t1_ff61ueq,1579617402.0,Meaning: People with Narcissistic Personality disorder NEVER EVER EVER admit to their faults..EVER! Did you think I was blaming the victims???????
insaneparents,ff5xt9h,t3_eroz8v,1579613766.0,"I'm a parent, Was diagnosed with Bi-Polar and Borderline Personality Disorder...Later it was changed to just BPD because I actually had Hormonal Psychosis.  This affected the way i treated my children. The FIRST thing i did was get help. And I tried adult group therapy. Do you know what I learned about Narcissistic parents??  They are completely and utterly incapable of admitting fault or taking any accountability for their actions. Even when they are court ordered to participate, it's never about their children, spouse i
or extended family. They only communicate in the I and ME . The only way for you as a child to improve your life is to a) Go get a therapyst on your own( School therapysts in the United states have to maintain your privacy BUT they are mandated reporters for physical and sexual abuse) 2. Please please please try and find a support group. You may even find others in your situation that you could live with and support one another. I know it must feel like you are stuck. But doing things for yourself is STILL something <3"
Methadone,ff4o45c,t1_ff4moj2,1579568341.0,"Obviously it's not that simple. But the lon GB and short of it is that 1. Depending on your situation. ut more often then not, you are coming into the clinic either detoxing or still pretty messed up. As the Methadone blocks the effects of both the drugs and the feelings of being high. As well, the body has been on "" High alert' So , when you get methadone on board you will stop being so damn UP and crash..Hard. I did have some drowsiness between 25 and 35 but once I got up to 40 I stopped feeling sleepy and started feeling like I was having withdrawals.  Then I went up pretty fast to 71 and stayed  there. In therapeutic doses Methadone should not have a sedative affect. If you have used methadone outside of doctors supervision then you can have all sorts of adverse effects. The whole point of therapeutic methadone is to be able to function again. Like a normal non high or withdrawing individual. Meaning you shouldnt feel anything aside from "" normal"""
Methadone,ff4dg9b,t1_ff4bp83,1579561004.0,"The first few months were like this on and off as I got to a therapeutic dose.   Mine was 71mg. And I stayed there until I got to my 27 take homes. So, 4 years. But my god...The SHIT I've worked through because of being on methadone. I have changed every. damn. aspect of my life. Nothing about my life now reminds me of my life addicted to pain killers. I never did heroine , and I know that has mad my journey easier in many ways. Honestly, it was fear of that needle in my arm that made me finally smarten up and get help. Please, take your time. Yes it's a process but it will be worth in in the long run
 It took us a long time to fuck up our lives and bodies..It takes a long time for your dopamine receptors to heal."
Methadone,ff4bp0z,t1_ff48c2c,1579559858.0,"I'm down to 44 mg this week. I have been doing this for 5 years. As soon as I got my 27 days of take homes I started detoxing at 1mg every two weeks. I have Multiple Sclerosis and Elhers-Danlos so I figured slow and steady..But  I am SOOOO ready to do new things with my life, I'm 41 years old. I want to do long haul trucking but if I continue at this rate it will still be 2 years almost before I'm done. I got REALLY depressed, sad and weepy at 49mg..for like 2 weeks but then I was fine. How do I find out a out rapid detox and does Medicaid/ Medicare pay for it?"
Methadone,ff4b1sg,t3_erks9t,1579559450.0,"How long were you using ? The fatigue is your body being able to finally relax. I'm 6 years clean, all Thanks to Methadone.  I have 1 months worth of take homes and I'm currently tapering a 1 mh every 2 weeks. Slow and steady wins the race. 

Listen, Methadone will help you start to function like a human being again. All the other hard work is up to you. Just remember, Nothing is easy and becoming addicts literally breaks your bodies ability to regulate it's own emotions. Sorry for the long reply. I just want people to focus on the good parts on being on methadone. It is just a great tool to help you on your journey. The fatigue WILL go away. And eventually when you get to a therapeutic dose you won't even be able to tell you are taking anything.  Best of luck on your journey! If you need any help or have questions feel free to DM me."
AskReddit,fespik2,t3_e507au,1579367651.0,"Am I weird??? I have a hand held shower nozzle. So, I kneel one stool and wash my hair upside down ( Meaning, bent over the side of the bathtub.) Then I wrap my hair in a towel and start the shower. My hair is almost to my waist. I HATE it sticking to my body as I'm trying to wash. So, I find that doing it before hand much easier. Also, I have eczema. And I'm very careful about the things that touch my skin. And because I use head and shoulder it can be very drying on your body. I then use Paul Mitchell leave in conditioner. Wrap it all in a towel and hop in the shower. I can then wash my neck, shoulders etc without my hair sticking to everything or rinsing out my conditioner ...Just easier all around."
AskReddit,feso72t,t3_e507au,1579367335.0,"My hair is almost to my waist. I always wash my hair, with the hand held shower head,  first. Then wrap it in a towel and get into the shower. Nothing is as gross to me as pulling head hair out of your bum crack!"
raisedbynarcissists,fedzgew,t3_eodqfd,1579023140.0,"I am a mother to 3. I am a grandmother of 4. Do you want to know what I would do??? Get yourself a damn good therapyst and go no contact. None. Stop giving to people that have no intention of ever giving to you. Their brand of "" love"" is toxic. You are clearly too good of a person.  And I'm assuming here that you inherited much more of your fathera DNA and traits then your mother and sister.  They will NEVER change but you can take yourself out of the line of fire. People like that do not ever change. So when I say no contact, I mean walking away forever. You deserve to be happy and healthy. Is life easy alone? No..But you can make it yours. You can find friends that will be the family you weren't granted by DNA alone. And guess what?? That is perfect okay. Never let anyone make you feel bad or guilty for protecting yourself from terrible parents/ blood relations. Do not ever feel you have to explain your position. Just live tour best darn life on YOUR terms. Don't let the negativity change the obviously good traits your possess. Not all people are bad. Best of luck to you sweetie!!! If you need more advice or just to vent..Well reddit is your friend!!"
