Photons can theoretically continue traveling in an endless space to a point where someone in the future won’t be able to see stars in the night sky. 


If there is a border of some sort encapsulating all matter then there has to be something on the other side of the border. Therefore we can assume the opposite must mean an endless open space must truly be endless. If space is as such, then light will one day travel too far for our eyes to see. The only way to look for answers is to look at everything smaller than photons and figure out their properties."

After 2009, everything started transitioning to a pay to win system.


I particularly was fond of playing RuneScape, Maplestory, and Habbo Hotel. 



I remember being fascinated that there could be a whole world you can interact with on your computer. I played RuneScape until EoC, but my brother continued and maxed out his stats before he got banned for macroing his high alchs. I was about 9 then in 2006. 


Playing Maplestory was super fun. My classmates all started playing in 2007. I was convinced the bandit was the best class because of the 3-hit skills they had. I remember saving up my allowance to buy $50 worth of NEXON currency. I was hooked back then, I swear. 



Habbo was the earliest MMORPG I played, and although it’s more of just a virtual chat portal, I enjoyed the role playing aspect of the community. Here you had teenagers creating mock military branches and ordering others what to do, and the crazy thing is that it worked. People were so into believing they were playing the role they were given that they’d spend hours as receptionists for new recruits. It was crazy."

The drilling wouldn’t be a civilian-pollution issue, and plus we have already stationed scientists from around the earth in that region. 


I’ve read about how life forms could travel space if they develop deep within asteroids, which helps protect them from the radiation emitted by stars. 


I’d be *really* fucking interested to know if Earth has been hit by or is one of those asteroids? We’ve had to wait hundreds of millions of year for the earth to cool off in order for it to develop steam, which in led to water thereby cooling the planet over the course of 100,000,000 years. 

My guess is that when the earth cooled off and was mainly just a ball of rock with a cool, watery surface, the life forms that existed under the cooled rock crept out and were somehow able to survive living in deep water. 


If we can drill deep into Antarctica, I want to see what we would be able to find. Perhaps the earliest lifeforms are too small to have been fossilized? Truly fascinating to think about."

politics,fdbh97t,t1_fdb9aa5,1578257394.0,"At that level it’s an issue of the person lacking sentence structure coherence and the inability to piece things together. 

I seriously believe there will be generations of incoming poverty in American families, particularly those with a family background in manufacturing back when the US labor economy was prominent in manufacturing. The rightwing establishment has made the constituents of red states more and more uneducated over the decades. These people angrily feel that they deserve to be paid more or pay less taxes. 

Remember, wages haven’t gone up in real value since the 1970s. So while the US was stagnant in real wages, everything worsened for the manufacturing economy in the US. 

China made it’s push to take manufacturing and make their export economy a global superpower. China, and a wide group of second and third world countries, stripped America’s manufacturing base of jobs and effectively crippled the US. 


It’s easier to get Americans to think they are owed better economic conditions, it’s easy to sell promises while hard to disclose the truth. The average quality of life in America on the Human Development Index has diminished ever since the USA’s labor economy shifted away from manufacturing and more into information and technology economy. We are shockingly nowhere in the top 20 nations when it comes to education. We have the budget to institute a high quality education program, but it doesn’t benefit the wealthy, who can write a check to any senator and change the senators position on key issues.
