I've been giving him feline CBD oil, it helps a little bit. Mostly with him it's just knowing him and knowing what upsets him and what makes him better. But grooming is very difficult. I wish he'd let me groom him. He has a very thick undercoat. It's gorgeous but needs to be brushed and he hates it."
Christianity,ffinxog,t1_ffhk5s8,1579978410.0,"That's so, so kind. Thank you so much for sharing that. I'm so glad you liked it and saw my message :) I know it's pretty basic but I was hoping it would help and your comment made me feel that it did <3 God bless you!! Praying for continued openness and positivity in your life through Christ!"
Christianity,ffintfy,t1_ffhckda,1579978331.0,"So grateful you saw what I was getting at! I'm no pastor, but I thought I'd share this because I always appreciate when mine relates real-life situations to our faith. It really helps me understand. Praying for your work with Christ and that you experience an abundance of faith in Him -- it's truly the very best gift. God bless, friend."
Christianity,ffinkzd,t1_ffh9jbo,1579978173.0,Blessings to you!! I'm so glad you got my message! I'm so glad it resonated with you. If I opened your heart then I really feel super good inside and makes me want to do good in the world. I'm so grateful <3 Praying for your continued journey in Christ <3
Christianity,ffingok,t1_ffhhvwv,1579978092.0,I'm so sorry. It's SO hard to lose them. I dread the day. God is definitely going to take care of him <3 No more suffering. I am praying for your comfort. I'm so sorry :(
Christianity,ffindv9,t1_ffhn3a0,1579978038.0,"Well, I never said that anger wasn't useful. If you don't know what I mean by trust God then I can't really help you with that, sorry. I said that we're afraid to make choices that we know are good for us, not walking up to a stranger asking for $5. Things don't always work out the way you want but the point is that you don't have to fear when it doesn't because, with faith, He looks out for us through His divinity. He gave his life so that when we die, we have eternal life through Him. I've experienced it firsthand. I've seen it work in other's lives. I don't know why people on Reddit have to twist things around to try and hurt people. But I don't regret sharing this, and I pray for you and that you get my message. I'll never question my faith or believe it isn't the answer to literally every problem in my life."
Christianity,ffin344,t1_ffhvrma,1579977829.0,"Well, I don't think it's a stretch to say I'm more intelligent than my cat but, okay, infinitely wasn't the right word. He is pretty intelligent. But I was only trying to frame up what I was getting at -- that I'm smarter than my cat and God is way smarter than we are. I guess I could've worded it differently. Sorry if I offended you..."

The Amish anger me for a few reasons. They rely on livestock and animals to do their physical bidings (carry their butter- eating asses up hill in all kinds of weather in those damn buggies, tilling the farms, etc.). They claim this is to preserve their antiquated lifestyle, and yet they take advantage of everything else. I see them at the buffet, grocery stores, doctors -- everywhere I go. There are levels to being amish and the ones around here are as far deviated from the tradition as you can get. One even tricked me into going to an Amway information session. Their animals have to work along side 18 wheeler trucks that come from their farms. Understand, they get tax breaks and welfare that the rest of us in society have to work here in the real world to give them. They take advantage. I dislike it very much.
