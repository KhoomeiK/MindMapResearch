dating_advice,ffe7dis,t1_ffdfvei,1579838679.0,"This is bullshit. I'm a guy who takes care of himself, dresses well, groomed, and guess what. It still only places me mildly above average. The issue is a guy can gain 2-3 points off of taking care of themselves, but a girl can go from a 2 to an 8. For instance, a pudgy 6'4'' guy with a head full of hair dressed not terribly will always look better than a short balding guy in fantastic shape and dressed well.

But, a chubby girl who doesn't put on makeup will never look better than an average jane who is well kept.

I think guys don't take care of themselves as much because their physical attraction is mostly genetic, while women's is not."

I'm not saying everything is perfect and equal like some people on this thread, just saying that only a solid effort matters to me. Lazy but lucky < effort but bad luck... mainly because it usually shows in other aspects of life."
medicalschool,ff24f99,t1_fevd5r7,1579493515.0,"I think the big difference is that when you are around other physicians (lounge/dictation area), you likely aren't around a patient. When you are around a nurse, there's a good chance a patients around.

summonerschool,fem37qx,t1_fem0d4w,1579238263.0,"As a mid laner, I've been on the flipside. A supp who wasnt warding was talking trash because  I got hit by a nocturne ult from behind mid lanes turret....  I shouldve warded for the ult.... even though my lane was warded.... and the ult was from behind the other mids turret.

I tried to explain and he told me I was stupid and I can ward for nocturnes ult. 

Nearly had a tension headache from the stupidity."
summonerschool,fem22rf,t1_felzp7b,1579237219.0,"I can play troll picks too and own lanes. The issue is that you end up with 2 AFKs, or a bot lane that goes 0/20 in 15minutes, or a jungle that feeds 3 kills and dub buffs a few times to your laner (this happened to me today).

In higher elos, it happens once and it's usually a close play. Not 6 times in a row in 10 minutes. Literally 1 in 3 matches, the jungle makes multiple dumb af play and gives 3-4 kills to the mid laner im up against. Then I get stuck stalling the lane and other lanes feed.

Doesnt matter if your 20-1, but their ADC is 20-1 as well and you have 2 trolls. Guess whos going to win even if you are better than the fed ADC. They go 5 man, your 2 trolls wander off and get picked, then you attempt to 3 v 5 vs a more fed team.

On my 2nd champion, I just checked. 12-6-10 kda - 44 percent wr."

confidence,felv32k,t3_epsiq0,1579231670.0,I always find mixed teams in soccer the funnest. It usually takes the edge off the match and it becomes much more laid back. Usually the few guys who get way to into the match mellow out.  I'm sure they'd appreciate it if you brought a friend or two along as well.
summonerschool,felrp5d,t1_felqr3h,1579229285.0,"I think you need a reality check and to drop down on another account and play in the elo. I just lost 3 matches in a row, all with a solid KDA and objective control. 

Last match, I get ahead and start decimating the team... but noc ults me every time. My team8s will not peel him, I die again and again until we lose.

You have to change your playstyle totally to carry. You can't play an immobile champion, you can't play a champion w/o push, you can't play anything lategame (because you have to get fed early). The champion pull becomes severely limited.

To top that, you'll occasionally encounter other people who are higher elo and have dropped. The lane becomes a stalemate, and then you both go and feed off the enemy hoping to get a bigger edge. It's really obvious when in iron1 they are farming 150 by 20 on a pressured lane."
summonerschool,felo9vc,t1_felnho2,1579226935.0,"You can't win as often. In gold, a good player can lead a match. In low silver and below, it's flipping coins. For instance, if I splitpush in gold and pull 4 top, my team will take objectives. If I splitpush in silver and pull 4 top, they are doing jungle camps and slowly farming waves. 

If I am fed 15-1 as mid lane in silver, they will not peel for me. In gold, they watch the assassin and stun them as they dive.

Then bad players make the match unwinnable. For instance, last match I am up against a halfway decent galio when I first pick LB. This is an impossible lane to feed on if the galio isn't completely awful. My jungle feeds him 5 kills by 10minutes for no reason, while I'm up a kill from a missplay by him. My trundle continues to straight up solo feed and my adc is 0-5. I can't carry."
summonerschool,felkqur,t1_fekswry,1579224522.0,"Brah.. drop down to iron atm... it's horrid. Consistently going 20-5, 44 percent wr..... the game is dictated by the AFK/troll.... I've been in gold/plat and my god, this is hell.  You actually have to adjust strategies from higher elos because people never follow through on anything.

My WR in gold was 60-70 percent and took me 40 games in gold to reach plat mmr. It took me previously 300 games to get out of silver... and im 30 games in still stuck in iron. TBH, with good macro skills, it's much easier to dictate the match flow in gold3+.

Yeah, you can eventually get out... but it takes hundreds of games for things to even out."

I don't need to be exposed to a case to understand the stats behind it, nor do your anecdotes of suspect cases from second hand info trump stats.

&#x200B;

My info comes from lectures from a well known psychiatrist in my city.  It's just not common enough in the general population for you to have several friends with parents, nor is second hand information enough for someone who doesn't know the criteria to diagnose someone. It's not even enough for someone well versed in the disorder to diagnose it lol."

Now, lets say that 1/2 the people who you know irl who say they were abused are exaggerating. That means you need to know 40 people IRL claiming to have been abused to have 1 narcissist case. There's a pretty good chance you never become close to someone who was abused by a narcissist IRL.

The sub should be abusive parents, not raisedbynarcissists - as the percentage of population with narcissistic personality disorder is very low... It's far less common than more common personality disorders, which based on vague descriptions could also describe many of the cases people on those subs.

People on reddit have started to describe cases of any parent forcing a child to be successful as narcissism now, which is sometimes not even a bad aspect of the parents, many times is just abuse, and rarely due to narcissism."

You can learn a solid amount on rotations, the exams are never totally new material (like all of M1 and M2), and thus you don't need to study as much.
