menstrualcups,ff7abti,t1_ff77enf,1579644514.0,Hmm. Ever seen a gyno? Worth going at least once if you can afford it. There may not be an issue but you can rule it out especially if none of these tips work.
menstrualcups,ff72zgg,t3_er1qdq,1579640088.0,"My first cup was organicup size A. Possible solutions that helped me:

* Ensuring holes are definitely clear.
* Punchdown or 7 fold
* If failing to insert then at second attempt inserting, place in a different direction. So if a c fold turn 180 degrees so a backward c.
* Changing cup size to one smaller (organicup have nice customer service and may do it free)
* Get a different cup that is more firm and more likely to pop into place. Organicup is 2/5 on putacupinit scale for firmness"

Try different positions. Squatting down. Laying down or sitting down with knees up to your chest. Sitting on a toilet but leaning forward. Can be difficult initially but body can get used to it. You could do dry runs but blood is a good lube.

There's also some smaller folds for menstrual cups or you can get a menstrual cup that is smaller. Do you masturbate? Stretching yourself when relaxed would be helpful."

AskReddit,fdq0olr,t1_fdpzl6e,1578649049.0,I like shopping when broke by yourself. Gives me some an idea of variety for when I can afford it. Plus gives some motivation to work. What I detest is going shopping with non broke friends.
depression,fdoq5l8,t3_emfue2,1578610366.0,How about a red felt tip marker?
exmuslim,fdnzdhl,t1_fdnfhm4,1578595935.0,Don’t know how I misread. Thanks for pointing it out.
exmuslim,fdmvjbg,t3_elw6g3,1578567792.0,"Replace all the time you spent with them with a hobby- coding, learning the guitar, cooking, volunteering, reading, netflix.

Write a journal or make plans with people to catch up. Family friends internet strangers.

exmuslim,fdmuw75,t3_em0zqe,1578566937.0,"Not as smart or as well read as you appear to be- but from where I'm standing I can see changes are happening and liberalisation is taking place.

Women are fighting and raising huge awareness against being forced to wear the hijab. We have no hijab day. Women drive in Saudi. We have Muslim women in politics and more and more Muslim women working.

We have first gay muslim marriages in the UK. We have our first mosque led by a female imam and is accepting of homosexuals.

We have ex muslim organisations around the world. ExMNA has done great work across Northen America and the states. Haven't noticed CEMB do much other than Allah is gay which sticks in the head of every person who read it and the controversy it created was huge- but they're active every year for PRIDE. Imtiaz Shams has done great work with Faith to Faithless. They hit the news and youtube and have documentaries.

Then there's also plenty of ex muslim videos or books that have opened people's eyes. The Masked Arab. Abdullah Sameer. Christopher Hitchens. Richad Dawkins. To name a few.

Awareness inspires. I'm proud of our slow progress.

A question though:

exmuslim,fdmttfb,t3_em2q4b,1578565463.0,"Lot of good points. Thought I'd add society is tougher on women to conform than men. Men do value their honour, but don't gossip the way women do, so women have to do extra to be seen as respectable."
exmuslim,fdmtl5k,t3_eluf5y,1578565145.0,"What's MUA? To be honest I support this. I don't believe Islam will die overnight, but with liberal views and encouragement from liberal Muslims we can get the religion to progress and be less problematic."
depression,fdmpmph,t1_fdlapln,1578559587.0,Can only get both through a prescription where I live sadly. Anything’s mon pharmacological which helped?
depression,fdmpl57,t1_fdm4x8q,1578559529.0,I never have heard of this but I’m intrigued and want to try it. Is it because you had some food and especially salty food in your stomach or was it the banana that helped?
depression,fdmpj8v,t1_fdlsel0,1578559456.0,It’ll likely ease up in a few days. Previous antidepressants have made me throw up 15-20 times a day and were pretty debilitating. Not sure if this will be bad but I just don’t want it affecting my everyday life too much. Need to get stuff done.

AskReddit,fcw5l7x,t1_fcvw1ua,1578017681.0,I definitely have had the same experiences. Tweasing or shaving hair results in it growing maybe four times as thick. My mother has the same issue. I've read too many times that it's a myth and blunt stubble but it's definitely not the case for me. Also they say waxing eventually reduces hair growth over the years. 10 years of waxing at least every 4 weeks. No change at all.
AskWomen,fcsip26,t1_fcj3du9,1577917251.0,No one is perfect. Everyone has imperfections. Some are visible. Some aren't. Personally I prefer the ones visible. They're easier to deal with than flaws in personality.

AskWomen,fcj3301,t1_fcj2lgv,1577676055.0,It's a bit difficult initially or if you have a bad experience but get out there and try. You'll get comfortable with your own body with experience and confidence in knowing guys were supportive. So don't date trash or lower your expectations. You're definitely worth loving.
AskWomen,fcj285y,t3_ehfkyw,1577675452.0,"Wearing a bra tailored for you that gives a good appearance.

And in bed own it. :) As long as it's not difficult for you, individualities can be treated as something special. And besides for many guys the best boobs are the ones they can get their hands on right now.

You can get surgery if you like. People do it for all other type of deformities so nothing wrong with doing it for boobs. Shop around and don't go cheap on it"

PMDD,fcj0r95,t1_fcindxy,1577674420.0,"I'm so sorry. That sounds absolutely horrible. Kinda hope it is the IUD so things fall back into place for you. Really curious myself what changes take place for you. Hope things fall into place.

What helped you with PMDD?"
PMDD,fcj0jgv,t1_fcilphx,1577674268.0,I did for three months. Nothing. I got bored so stopped. Antidepressants helped me. Sertraline and later switched to mirtazapine.
PMDD,fcj0f7q,t1_fcikgsv,1577674183.0,"I have depression and anxiety too but its a hundred times more mild compared to PMDD. I never even had PMS or period pain before the IUD. So I knew something was definitely wrong with a sirens call to death.

Glad to hear it wasn't the cause of issue for you."
PMDD,fcj070q,t1_fcij2zr,1577674026.0,It's very rare to the extent there's no scientific knowledge behind it. Imo we're mostly all women sensitive to hormone changes in this sub.  Hence why hormonal contraception hasn't worked well for many of us and copper coils have indirect hormonal changes. Sucks. Hope there's more awareness in the future.
PMDD,fcizw4s,t1_fciig4v,1577673818.0,"I've seen forums on it too. Absolutely no scientific data on mood changes except for copper toxicity. Really should be raised more awareness of.

What helped with PMDD for you? :) Did it go away completely after removing the IUD?"
PMDD,fcizp4o,t1_fciki64,1577673686.0,Don't worry. It's extremely uncommon to the extent there is absolutely no research or scientific mention of it and I've been looking for a long while. Slight bias here because youre on a PMDD sub. But try it. Even with PMDD I'm tempted not to remove it. Antidepressants have helped me. :)

exmuslim,fc55qyu,t3_eg93rc,1577444593.0,I was raised by a single mom who had no family support so I get how hard it is. I'd wait a bit till you could afford to leave your daughter somewhere for babysitting whilst you are working. You'll definitely save her and yourself from the negative energy but you need to be in a financial situation to be able to afford doing it yourself.
SuicideWatch,fbsk42d,t3_ee66b1,1577056326.0,"Feeling alone amongst a crowd. A feeling I can definitely resonate with. The constant pretending that you're okay and brushing all your true feelings under the carpet to support your loved ones. If you can OP talk to someone. A counselor, therapist, friend etc. Someone on the outside who gets where you come from and won't judge you. Not healthy to bottle up and will help you cope."
