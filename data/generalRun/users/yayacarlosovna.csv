houseplants,ffui1lg,t1_ffude5r,1580242387.0,Yeah he did last summer. It badly needs pruning now but I’m waiting until this spring. I find this gig really hardy he never dies. Once it gets cold I bring him in from my balcony and he drops leaves but then goes a bunch new branches and leaves once it gets used to the spot. I use the leaves for natural dyeing and making desserts too (fig leaf ice cream is awesome).
aww,fftn8l1,t1_fftgvtg,1580224819.0,Sounds like you have your heart in the right place and I’m sure you’ll help Luna find her forever home wether it’s with you or a different family. Thanks for fostering!
aww,fftf001,t1_ffrg2u5,1580218637.0,"When I adopted my 100lb dog I lived in a tiny studio apartment in a big city. I still live in similar circumstances, just with slightly more space. I think larger dogs don't seem to care so much about space as long as you make enough time to take them exploring, walking, and going to parks. My dude just sleeps all day unless I'm taking him out, and having a big dog has given me the motivation to be more active and explore more, since I want to enrich his life as much as possible, it has made me see and do so much more I would have without him. When you find your match, you find your match, and you adapt. If she's happy and you're happy then it's a match."

canada,feje5v8,t1_feit707,1579169679.0,Wow. Check the costs of security. It’s absurd for Canadian tax payers to have to take that burden on top of already spending so much money on the monarchy as is.

witcher,fc8joli,t1_fc7om2m,1577536343.0,I don’t think so honestly. I personally think it’s better storytelling to slowly reveal how fucked up and dark Nilfgaard is instead of showing it all at once. To each his own.
