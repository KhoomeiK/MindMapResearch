relationship_advice,feiztp3,t3_epef4c,1579151943.0,"I have been we're you are. Anxiety is a hard demon to live with it, but you can do it.

You can't base your complete self and happiness on another person's dedication to you and expect them to stop doing what makes them happy. That's not a healthy life for either party.

It's very hard to work on yourself, and accept the responsibility to make yourself feel happy.  It comes from within.

 Yes, change therapists if you aren't feeling supported.

I have been married almost 20 years. I have felt like I was competing with activities for my husband's attention. But actually I was jealous he was feeding his interests and honestly I didn't have any.  His interests make him even more appealing, I don't want to take it away.

It is a process, but it is possible. Doing activities that build your self esteem are very helpful.  It's a lot like anxiety in that you can change the pattern of thoughts, because if he is with you and reassuring to you it's only your mind keeping you down.  I have been there.

So I have been trying to get some hobbies, found some, changed my mind, did another thing.  It's not fair to ask the other half to change completely so I don't have to deal with my insecurities.  I try to break negative thought patterns as well, my husband is actually a great partner and I beat myself up far more than is necessary. His behavior isn't unhealthy to our relationship, and I don't want mine to be either.

Don't give up on you.  Or him.  Try a different approach.

Sorry if I went on, topic is close to my heart I guess."

TwoXChromosomes,fdwwtr4,t3_emzkfo,1578763080.0,"The 'American' dream has changed!

I have 2 kids, I am an American. I'm middle aged and middle income. I am in a hetro stable marriage with the father of my kids. He and I are both working full time and have a small retirement fund, 2 cars and a small house. We live comfortably compared to so many.  But a lot has changed since we were naive early twenties who wanted what our parent had.  We're the ideal picture on an insurance company ad.  This is not the American dream anymore. 

It's a struggle to financial live this way. We don't really own anything, it's all monthly payments with interest. We pay so much in taxes it does no good to have the mind set ""work more!"" We'd just pay more taxes.  And we don't mind taxes, we know we need to pay for the society we want to be a part of but there's no breaking free of them...

God forbid one of gets sick or worse. This shit would collapse. And will we ever retire?  Long way of living before we'll really know...

Next, the prospect of giving our kids college funds or trying to help them find their path, in this world, it's scary. We're working hard on good grades and hoping for scholarships!  Will some type of higher education be free in the next 10 or 20 years?

I love my family and I work hard to be the best I can for them. I regret nothing.

 I am expecting my teen daughter not to want kids, and I am fine with that.  She expressed it already. The struggle of middle income is a rat race, there's other ways to live. Why should she lock herself into this?  It's a very hard choice to raise kids emotionally not to mention financially.  I hope it doesn't consume the majority of her adult life. I hope she lives the way she wants to, not bound to some ideas of several generations ago.

Maybe future society can finally free itself of worshipping our capitalist elites and have them pay more of their share back into society it will shift back to a place where raising kids doesn't seem so insane. I'll hope and vote with the next generation in my thoughts.

Sorry if I had a little rant, felt kind of nice."
