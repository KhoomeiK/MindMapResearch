I also think that a dog wouldn’t really help too much about your eating issues because well...it’s a dog. They can do wonderful things like provide pressure therapy but ask yourself would a weighted blanket help you in that situation. 

Essentially the dog is a mobile weighted blanket. They can also do things like self harm alert to try and snap you out of it but they can’t interfere (for the dogs safety). So you’ll still have to continue your therapy and working on it yourself. 

If you truly need a dog to be with you in public you’ll be looking more at a service dog. Which would require training and that training doesn’t finish until about 1.5-2 years."

If an ESA would benefit you then I would go for that more so than a SD because training a SD is a long process. I would not however take them into non pet friendly places because they won't have the training. 

If your doctors are on board then I wouldn't worry about being disabled enough. I go through the same things since I don't have a ""physical"" chronic illness but I remind myself that if these professionals agree then I should put my trust in them.

Make sure your dog has a good tuck and that they can ignore other dogs barking at them. Unfortunately it's very common to have other dogs freaking out at your dog in the airport.

Other than that maybe take a bus ride or play the sound of an airplane taking off. TSA will also pat down your dog and swab your hands."
service_dogs,fglxjyv,t1_fglx10d,1580913380.0,"So ultimately it comes down to the ADA definition of a service dog. Is your dog.

1.) Under control and housebroken
and 
2.) Do they know one task to mitigate your disability?

If it's yes to both then legally they are a ""fully trained service dog"". But depending where you are in the training process you can always go back. There have been times where I just went back to training at lowes (petfriendly) because she was having a weird off week. Slower is always better than faster in the SD world."
service_dogs,fglth61,t1_fglmj0z,1580910541.0,"So this happened to me at an airport due to my family feeding my dog junk without me knowing. 

Even though my poop bags were normally readily accessible I was panicking too much so my motor skills were shot. Thankfully no one yelled at me but it was humiliating.

I still cleaned up my mess and made sure I cleaned it up and not the janitor (although she lent me the supplies). Also having an angry yelling man in your face is awful. It's also one of my biggest triggers and although I have an SD to pull me out of panic attacks and flashbacks having an active trigger screaming at me doesn't help in the slightest."
service_dogs,fglt4ti,t1_fglm2ze,1580910300.0,"The biggest difference between obedience in public and PA is that with PA you are training specifically for no reaction to a varied environment. 

When I go out to train it's not just sit and don't bark. It's also rolling weird carts by, ignoring people, making weird sounds that are normally heard in stores. Basically making sure that my dog knows what to do if a weird thing happens. 

My SD does the same thing for me BTW. She's a supplement to my therapy and meds since they don't take care of all my issues and it's still debilitating with my meds and therapy."

EmotionalSupportDogs,fgknooz,t1_fgkn935,1580869672.0,"Also when you go into pet friendly areas the expectation is also a lot lower.

My service dog still makes the occasional mistake though. Most do since they're living breathing creatures. Like she barked inside a tea shop because there was a man trying to coo her over and a car full of four dogs going nuts."
EmotionalSupportDogs,fgkmoa2,t1_fgkm1g7,1580869062.0,"I think as an ESA he should be fine. He doesn't need to have the temperament that a service dog has. But if your seizures are frequent enough you might actually qualify for a service dog.

I have a GSD service dog and people are scared of her. I usually just have her sit with her back away from people who are scared or ask her to ""guard"" my back where she stands behind me. People are less likely to be scared if she's not looking at them and physically away.

As for the protection part he definitely wouldn't make it as a service dog because of his protectiveness over you. Some good muzzles are Jafcos! They're bite proof and come in a ton of sizes. Also go super slow with desensitizing and always do something fun in the muzzle. We play chase in her muzzle but she's trained to wear it for emergencies or air travel (some companies require me to muzzle her on the flight)

As for access issues and people I've had kids step on her tail, get in her face, pet without asking. It's just how people are. Also the chances of her being stolen with me are very very low since I'm physically holding a leash. If you ever go the route with a service dog with another dog you can teach them to stick by you and have a ""go with them"" command. Otherwise they shouldn't go with anyone else."

EmotionalSupportDogs,ffmd6wz,t1_ffm35sg,1580052721.0,You can contact your local HUD about the FHA. They will probably be able to give you a lawyer at no cost. Just make sure you have everything documented.
dogswithjobs,fflkfv8,t1_ffl06oj,1580040739.0,Not all panic attacks can be harmful to others. Some people lash out and others are more introverted.
dogswithjobs,fflkb93,t1_ffl08gf,1580040679.0,"Depends on if you know the person or not. If they’re having a hard time it’s best to usually ignore it if they have a service dog. It’s embarrassing enough to have one in public. 

If there’s no service dog or service humans to help maybe say “can I help you with anything?” Often they can be physically paralyzing so even a simple help off the ground can be good."
service_dogs,ffljuzb,t3_eu4467,1580040475.0,Great Danes typically only live to 5 or 6. So whenever you see them slowing down or having issues it probably would be a good idea to train a new one.

I’m all for making healthcare more accessible but it should be through reputable companies and not ones that want to scam the disabled."
EmotionalSupportDogs,fflahxb,t3_eu515k,1580037104.0,"Nope online is a scam. Please go through your therapist, pcp, or psych."
service_dogs,ffirbyh,t3_etv5b7,1579980770.0,"Sounds like she just put the bare minimum of training into the dog. 

My service dog will paw me before I have a panic attack so that I can appropriate measures to prevent it but I had to teach her the signs and do scent work. (Trying to do cortisol alert but it’s iffy if I can even train it). 

I mean if the dog is well behaved then w/e but she’s definitely using the dog as a crutch. Without therapy and meds a service dog wouldn’t work for me because the dog can only do so much and sometimes dogs get sick or can’t work."
service_dogs,ffh9v73,t3_etk3bh,1579927345.0,"Yeeep if the vest is off she will usually be an okay dog. Not an excellent one. She’ll bark at another dog or pull a little harder. She jumps on people at the dog park and is a little rebel. 

We’re working on fixing the off duty stuff but a lot of it will just come with time since she’s still so young."
service_dogs,ffgpppj,t1_ffglcnh,1579911920.0,The only time I’ve ever considered an escalator was when I couldn’t for the life of me find an elevator. Thankfully someone helped me find it but escalators are just not good in general for dogs.

Erie,ffdherw,t3_eszovn,1579820918.0,"So the work culture at least for non warehouse is nice. People generally like each other but depending on what area you might get a quieter group or a more outgoing one. 

Benefits and pay are nice but it’s a slow season and there’s a hiring freeze."
service_dogs,ffcjs6k,t1_ffcj99x,1579800958.0,"But ESAs have no public access. They’re a medically prescribed pet. 

ESAs are very important for those who need a little extra help. They absolutely work for people but because they can be any animal and they don’t have public access they don’t need to be trained to the extent of a service dog."
