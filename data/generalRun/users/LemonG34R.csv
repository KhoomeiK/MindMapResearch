GoldandBlack,ffjkcqs,t1_ffjia8i,1580000207.0,"Well, you can harp on about the flaws of a system and advocate for a change while acknowledging that it is better than previous systems. Feudalism is better than citizen/slave societies, but that doesn’t make Feudalism immune to criticism (as you, a proponent of Capitalism, would surely agree).

> You don't talk about eating the rich if you just think it's a flawed but good system.

Yes you do. Good is relative, like I explained before, to the material conditions of whatever state you’re in. Wanting to end a system that’s flawed in favour of one that’s “better” and less flawed isn’t outside of the realm of possibility."
GoldandBlack,ffjfpak,t1_ffj9fty,1579997276.0,"Communists believe that Communism is better than Capitalism which is better than Feudalism which is better than slave/citizen societies.

Marxists believe that Capitalism is a good economic system which improves on the past, however it is not the final solution. Socialists are aware of the merits of capitalism, and also its flaws."

I may be chaotic neutral, but imo there’s nothing home wrecking or wrong about telling him that you like him. It’s up to him whether or not to pursue a relationship with you, and if he does, then it was a good thing anyway because he wasn’t committed to that relationship."
