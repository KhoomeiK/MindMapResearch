Not sure if you're being sarcastic. There *is* a logical and reasonable measurement: kWh = Kilowatt hours.

If a 100 W bulb (a fairly bright non-LED household bulb) is turned on for 1 hour, it uses up 100 Wh = 0,1 kWh.

A 1000 W microwave (most have between 600 and 1200 W) running for 30 minutes uses up 1000 W x 0,5 hours = 500 Wh = 0,5 kWh.

Why's that hypocritical? Monarchy is THE symbol for birthright: The idea that ""bloodlines"" justifies treating people unequally and thus unfair. Have you ever heard the royal family speak out against this? Probably not, and it might have to do with the royal family profiting from it.

Millions of people were taken advantage of by monarchists for generations, and it took piles of casualities and torches and pitchforks and centuries to finally get rid of them.

At least, the british monarchy doesn't have the legislative policial power they used to. But they still leech off society, occupying public positions, pounding on their ""birthright"".

>Your position is admirable,

Thanks!

Good question: *Nothing*. I'm lucky to be born in the 1st world, and I'm aware of it. Financially, I'm probably in the top 10% worldwide. However, I'd advocating for things like basic income, soft borders, freedom of travel, strong social services. In short: I'm all for giving everyone an equal chance, even if it means my own country (*including* myself) becomes (relatively) poorer.
