LabManagement,fe8f98y,t3_eo2dbe,1578925547.0,"See if the company will run and sent results for the batch you will be receiving. A reputable vendor will do this, and should be quality testing each batch anyhow."
LabManagement,fe8172d,t3_eo2dbe,1578921237.0,Can ACB provide any publications or other references? You can always ask for chromatography or mass spec data and compare that way. Sorry I canâ€™t be of more help.
dogs,fdvjnff,t3_en21kr,1578748068.0,"Overall coat condition is heading downhill. Dull coat, some missing fur patches, scabs, and dry skin.. looks like here is some inflammation as well. My guesses are either early mange, or autoimmune issue. If this were just allergies/flea bites I would expect to see scabs/itching/redness/missing fur specifically around the base of the tail, working its way up the back, and possible signs of developing staff infection. 

Good luck! Also, thank you for taking care of this guy. I acquired a stray mama dog just before New Years, so I understand the frustration.. she was clearly a pet earlier in her life, which breaks my heart. She visited the vet his week, and it turns out she is heartworm positive, has GI parasites, and needed to be spayed. I highly advise the heartworm test and GI parasite treatment especially if you have other dogs.. these are not fun or cheap issues to deal with."

I struggled with my decision to take her, but in her condition milk wouldnâ€™t last long with growing pups, and neither would she. Itâ€™s pretty hard to come by a spare leash and collar at night on the back county roads of Georgia."

Thank you!"
dogs,fczriog,t1_fczp055,1578107390.0,"Thank you so much for your response! I think the idea of visiting is good. Not something I thought of before. Sponsoring her care is not an issue, so I will be sure to cover the costs associated her time and adoption.

I hope this girl will be lucky and be placed with a foster family, or a home that has some prior dog experience. She is very easy overall (hasnâ€™t even had an accident! ) but is still learning some manners. This is my first surrender, and hopefully last ever... doing all I can with the best intentions."
BocaRaton,fcz8vox,t1_fcz8i3b,1578096024.0,Born and raised in one of those neighborhoods! I agree!
aww,fcvhw5z,t1_fcv94cc,1578002430.0,Megatron is one of two dogs I can actually keep :) Miss Georgia Peach is the sweetheart needing a home!
aww,fcv68j2,t1_fcv1ma6,1577995496.0,"Basically the same story here... but found in GA. Want another?? Iâ€™m planning to foster her temporarily since Iâ€™m already over the pet limit for my apartment complex. After a month, she will be taken to the shelter and Iâ€™ll be paying for all of her adoption fees up front so she has the best chance of finding a home."
Crayfish,fcf8vaj,t3_egut52,1577627652.0,Curious to hear about how he interacts with the plants overtime! Any special planted tank maintenance you have encountered with a cray added to the mix?
FirstTimeHomeBuyer,fcax3q4,t3_egvyzk,1577578337.0,Iâ€™m no help here... but why carpet?
