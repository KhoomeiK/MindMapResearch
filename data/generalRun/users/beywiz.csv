dankmemes,fcoomy4,t1_fcojb7j,1577837498.0,"You don’t make sound changes on purpose; Britain didn’t “drop the R on purpose”. Not to mention, the R across all English used to be a tap, not the weird retroflex bs we have in American English now. So Shakespeare had a different R than what we have now in either GAE or RP. 

And yes, there are pronunciation differences between RP and GAE beyond rhoticity; the article you shared talked about the difference in the “A” sound (Britain’s “aah”(/a/) vs. America’s “ahh”(/æ/)). 

Again, sound changes don’t happen on purpose, and the south didn’t “emulate what Britain did”, they just had similar (to an extent) sound changes."
dankmemes,fcoae9k,t1_fcnfnvv,1577827427.0,I mean it’s mostly that those who emigrated to America and whose descendants now speak general American English were not the same as those whose descendants speak RP English; the US took one set of dialects and the isles another
