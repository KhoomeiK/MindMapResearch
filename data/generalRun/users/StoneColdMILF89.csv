aww,ffffgzt,t3_et97bl,1579882815.0,"Holy shit! Some of these people are dissecting this video like it’s anything more than what it is.  Chill out! It’ cute. Daddy issues much? 

There’s no winning with some of you. It’s like all you want to do is piss on everyone’s parade.  Most of you probably aren’t even parents but yah, go ahead and act like experts on both parenting and child development. Let me guess you have a Ph.D in Behavioral Psychology too. 

It’s a video of a father spending quality time with his daughters which should be celebrated because God knows we need more parents like this. But no, let’s make him feel bad about it because he’s teaching them to be sore losers. Damned if you do, damned if you don’t. 

Grow up. Perhaps you’re feeling sore because life has fucked you. 

Good day."
Instagramreality,ffdi2ok,t3_es623r,1579821320.0,Right? Making me feel like I suck at makeup. I mean.. I do . But still.
AskReddit,ffcxrjb,t1_ffcopd0,1579809473.0,"Yes! I was seeing a guy for a bit, he always wore a baseball cap which was fine because he was always in athletic apparel. I never thought twice about it since there was a significant amount of  hair coming out from beneath the hat in the back and on the sides. Then one day we started messing around and he took his hat off. I left a few minutes after. Nothing against balding men I find them attractive as well but own that shit. I rather see a shaved/buzzed  head then a patchy one. 

Don’t judge me for being a dick, I was 20 and we weren’t in a relationship or planning to be in one. It was all based on mutual physical attraction which was a farce. Yes, I know some women do that with makeup, push-up bras etc etc.  just sharing an experience, not saying it was right."

AskReddit,ffcucqi,t3_esxok0,1579807434.0,"None, but precisely the reason why I won’t enter a haunted house attraction. What if there really is some psycho murdering people and everyone thinks it’s just part of the “act”. Hell no. Hard pass."

AskReddit,ffcu3dq,t3_esxoph,1579807283.0,"I showed my best friend a meme of OJ Simpson with the caption “ I got 99 problems but a bitch ain’t one”. Her response way, “ I don’t get it, Michelle seems pretty nice”. W T F? She thought OJ was Obama. This was during Obama’s presidency.... or that time she was studying to be a nurse and thought that we had both blue and red blood in our veins because pictures of the circulatory system were marked blue and red ... face palm. Yes, she passed  and is a charge nurse now. No, I will never let her get close to me with a needle."

PlasticSurgery,fekzk9s,t3_epo7mu,1579210877.0,"Don’t do anything else. Fillers are the worst. It seems that people don’t know when to stop injecting them. It’s really easy to want to correct multiple things after you get something done. I just had an upper Blepharoplasty last month so I have an idea of what’s going through your mind when you look at your reflection. You look good man. I would have never guessed you had anything gone, and that is what good plastic surgery looks like. Take the win. Don’t experiment with anything else.  If you ever feel the desire to get more work done, go look at the botched surgeries sub. That will scare you straight."

PlasticSurgery,fehiwg9,t1_feh4uzq,1579117461.0,I just did too. At first with amusement and then I started to feel really sad for these people. No one in their right mind self - mutilates.
Botchedsurgeries,fehiibt,t1_fe4w6nc,1579117232.0,That’s exactly what I was thinking! The eye shape doesn’t look significantly different to me . Wouldn’t it be easier to shave half of the eyebrow off and fill in the new shape?
Botchedsurgeries,fehi5n2,t1_fcyincd,1579117026.0,"People who don’t know squat about squats ! I’ve always had a little more booty and while squats/deadlifts  definitely make it firmer and provide a nice lift, there isn’t a chance in hell they can make it exponentially bigger. Also, anyone who lifts heavy would have equally defined legs and last I checked none of the Kardashians had any leg gains."

Instagramreality,feebhwf,t1_fedwb7l,1579030342.0,"Right? They use their stick thin models and usually have them wear a fake perfectly round, cute bump with a sexy pair of 5” heels. I’ve never seen a photoshopped one like this before though! Was this actually used as an advertisement??"
funny,fdjul42,t3_elpisf,1578488005.0,This took a lot more creativity and effort than just buying a mixer. He’s given her a gift she will always remember and a funny story to share for years to come.  All this work just to see the expression on her face; that’s love man. :)
