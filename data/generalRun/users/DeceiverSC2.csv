Which one? The heavy water leakage that accounted for less than a 1/1000th of the regulatory limit? Or the issues that occurred 70 years ago? 

>Three Mile Island

40 years ago. Very different reactor design. You can't logically attempt to compare pressurized water reactors with heavy water reactors. 

>Fukushima

Believe it or not it's incredibly unlikely that we'll see any tsunamis in lake Huron. 
 
>Chernobyl

Yeah USSR reactors in the 60s did not give a fuck. They were built completely opposite to every other type of reactor in the world which allowed operators to push the reactor into a critical state from which it can't recover. 

>everything at Sellafield

What are you talking about here? Incidents in the 50s and 60s or a 'radiation-leak' in the 2000s in which not a single radioactive particle was released into the environment?

>This just isn't true. Nuclear is one of the most expensive capital energy sources to start while wind, geothermal, certain solar and hydro are all significantly cheaper now and renewables are dropping in cost while nuclear and other non renewables have plateaued or increased. This may have been true like 15 years ago but times are changing.

Once again I'm operating under the assumption that we are not going to all accept a massively decreased quality of life because electricity is now solely dependent on sun hours or wind-speed. Stop acting like it's acceptable to only sometimes have your lights work.

>Which is why it's important to not just bank on one type of energy supply. Nobody is saying only wind, or only solar. A diverse supply of energy generation can be used for baseload. 

I think you have a fundamental misunderstanding of the energy needs of our society. Using some combination of solar power and wind at the costs listed in the report you linked is not sufficient to encompass our energy needs. You can't have several hours in a month where hospitals aren't receiving power because it's night-time and not windy. Yes hydroelectric is absolutely a tried and true method that does work fairly effectively however it's incredibly dependent on geography. Now while Canada may be geographically disposed to take advantage of hydroelectricity it's certainly nothing of a solution for the planets climate crisis. Furthermore a sole reliance on thousands of litres of fresh water flowing may be a difficult proposition in the future as it becomes a more scarce resource. 

>Ah yes the old Canada is just sooooo much different than any other Northern Countries that are currently investing in renewables like Norway, 

Norway outsources their carbon footprint. They export more oil than Qatar. ~11% of their GDP was from exporting oil in 2019, in the 2000s it was >20% of their GDP. This shit does not count if the only way you can fund these renewables is by exporting absurd amounts of oil. 

>Sweden (who's phasing out nuclear)

Except they haven't yet. It's ~45% of their entire countries power generation. Wind is about ~1%, yet somehow wind is going to be ~50% of the power needs for our country that's almost x4 as populous. 

>Canada Quebec, BC and Manitoba. 

Quebec uses almost solely hydroelectric, over 95% of their electricity is generated through hydroelectric means. 

BC and Manitoba are ~85% hydroelectric. Not solar and wind. 

>Different environmental and construction standards. We have no new proposed facilities so do you think these things just get approved overnight? How is it possible that the 102 story Empire State Building was built in a little over a year in the 1930s but now high rises take much longer to build. This might be the dumbest thing you've said.

Darlington was built in the exact same time frame ~8 years in the 90s. Furthermore suggesting changes in policy were similar in scale between 1980-2020 and 1930-2020 is such a dishonest *yikes* argument.

>The facts are that nuclear is expensive, has to go through gigantic time consuming environmental/regulatory hurdles, and there are worries of catastrophic accidents while serious ones happen much more than you're leading on. It doesn't make financial sense or societal sense to think that nuclear will be our transitional future.

We agreed it's expensive. 

Yes there are regulatory hurdles caused by people like you whom have zero interest in acquiring any facts about nuclear energy. Comparing modern CANDU designs to Chernobyl and reactor designs from the 50s is borderline brain-dead. 

>and there are worries of catastrophic accidents while serious ones happen much more than you're leading on.

You are aware you didn't prove this at all correct? 

> It doesn't make financial sense or societal sense to think that nuclear will be our transitional future.

It's likely that quite a few places in Canada can use hydroelectricity as their main source of power generation. However it's:

A. On a timer, unless we absolve water shortage issues in the future. 

B. Completely geographically dependent.

C. Fails to accompany *all* of our energy needs.

It's why the report you linked doesn't mention hydroelectricity. Even though you quote 'hydro' in the hyperlink. Because it's a super limited solution that essentially demands you to be lucky in geography and that's about it."
CanadaPolitics,fgkd2hn,t1_fgjmr8c,1580862746.0,">not totally safe (major accident happens about every 10 years and serious accident every 30).

What does this even mean? If you're talking about Chernobyl it's like suggesting engines are bad because a specific Chevy engine built in 1947 caught fire under extreme operating conditions. 

>It's exceptionally expense,

In comparison to what? Energy is expensive. Clean energy is more expensive.

>the waste will always be an issue along with weapons production on a global scale if more countries decide to also switch.

There are lots of reactors that don't require weapons grade uranium. For a start CANDU reactors only require natural uranium.

Yes there is nuclear waste, it's likely the most substantial problem for nuclear energy. However this is a far, far easier problem to deal with than:

1. fossil fuel by-products (which you can't contain) 

2. Energy only being available during the day-light/when it's windy.Which doesn't work for any emergency service or in any place that has night-time and is cold, which is all of Canada. 

>There is no possible way nuclear will ever get built fast enough in order to meet what we need.

How does this make sense? What else will? How is it we made the Bruce Nuclear Generating Station in roughly ~7-8 years in 1970 yet in 2020 it will take us even longer?"

Except it does because they oftentimes legitimately do not care about these injustices. Every Chinese person who isn't wholly rural knows about the June 4th incident.

>How is that misleading exactly? You're complaining that the viewership dropped off after the premiere..... Exactly like what happened here. Exactly what regularly happens.

Nope. 

The average viewership across the 21 episodes of the 1st season of 30 Rock was 5.8 million. The pilot was 140% of the seasons average, the finale was 81% of the season average. 

The average viewership across the 6 episodes of the 1st season of Diggstown was ~260,000. The pilot was 126% of the season average, the finale was 62% of the season average. 

To give you some perspective on how poor that is; episode 6 of 30 Rock had viewership numbers of 103% relative to the season average. 

The viewership of Diggstown consistently fell throughout all 6 episodes, the viewership of 30 Rock did not.

>Why is that atrocious? What's your definition of an audience? Not every show on TV needs to be number one. Not every show on TV needs to appeal to 30+% of the TV viewing audience.

Because similar CBC dramas that came out around the same time averaged far greater viewership numbers? 

Frankie Drake Mysteries averaged 806,000. 

Coroner averaged ~1,000,000 and premiered to over 1,000,000.

Except those both of those actually had a viewer-base and they weren't 6 episodes. For public television, that's mandatory on every television in the country, running 330k viewership prime-time premiers is atrocious, losing half of your audience in 6 episodes is beyond atrocious, especially when you consider the 2nd and 3rd episodes both had 290,000 viewers. 

Furthermore, your 30 Rock example couldn't be more misleading. The first season of 30 Rock had 21 episodes, outside of one episode that was shown in the lead up to a season finale of Scrubs, no episode got within 2 million viewers of the season premiere.

Uhh what? The show started extremely low for a prime-time slot, it then dropped massively, halving it's viewership in only 6 episodes. So CBC decides to renew it?
