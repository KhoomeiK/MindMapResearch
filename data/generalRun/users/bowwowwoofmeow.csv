AmItheAsshole,fglb8td,t1_fgla6sd,1580889137.0,"No, you read it wrong. OP is not actively trying to have a baby, but not taking any precautions to avoid it either. So they are having sex for recreational purposes and not timing it to ensure conception. If it happened it happened.  

That being said sometimes it doesn’t hit you until you are holding the baby and saying “crap, can’t return this one if it doesn’t work out...”."
insaneparents,fgkqeji,t1_fgkozp9,1580871306.0,Yeah I am a seasoned traveller and have all my vaccines listed in a yellow vaccine book in case they ask for it at the border to some African countries. They usually don’t check but I’m not wasting a flight just to be turned around.

AmItheAsshole,fgkiy4e,t1_fgke6rn,1580866637.0,"He’s currently a liability to himself. I can very well see a case where he injures someone else quite badly (because no one spoke up yet) and they sue because the others were negligent in their duty to to ensure a safe workplace. They sue the company because it will have money, corporate will turn the lawyers on the other employees for not disclosing it (probably fine print in the contract somewhere) and it all goes to shit because you let a homie follow his drunken path."

Coronavirus,fgjeb5z,t3_eytq60,1580842244.0,"I’m here in Vietnam with the same sentiments. Is the low rate we are seeing in near Asian neighbours really because it’s contained or is it because people are afraid to come in for testing, not understanding the symptoms, too expensive to go to doctors or worse still doctors ignoring it."

cvnews,fgi9t4r,t3_eymyp4,1580813129.0,As someone who has to deal with SO2 capture systems I’m more inclined to believe that it’s a smelter that’s had its SO2 capture system break down or leak due to lack of maintenance (because not many people are going to work or critical spares not getting through) than burning bodies with their minuscule S levels.

AskReddit,fghj8hj,t3_ey9qbh,1580786052.0,"Anything with Paris Hilton. 

When Blockbuster was still a thing I had a scale for movie quality. 

Spoiler level: Top tier, read the spoiler and it was still a good movie. 

New release: Worth the overnight price ($6) for a single movie. 

Weekly: $4 for a week to watch many times.

Weekly pack: $5 for 5 movies for a week

Not worth the weekly: Just a waste of time. 

The last was where Paris Hilton’s movies stood. Each and every one of them."

She had this idealised expectation of seeing him at the airport and hyped it up in her mind to the point that when he didn’t meet her it turned what should have been a happy event into a sour one. But that’s definitely all on her.
AmItheAsshole,fgewmmm,t3_ey2z5n,1580712877.0,"NTA. If someone told me they’d call the cops on me for just being alone with their child I would just block and run. No need to risk my reputation and livelihood for pure crazy. 

The boyfriend has also just shot a flare of a red flag though. You may want to confront him on that one."

worldnews,fgc4jpo,t1_fgc302j,1580669006.0,Thanks for the input. Are you vegetarian only or fully vegan? I know that makes a difference to some.
technology,fgaw4wl,t1_fg9pbgs,1580656040.0,When I was in the 80s my Maltese friends duped us into believing that there was only one ring road around the small island and that it was only one way. If you wanted to go ‘back’ 50m you either reversed or went around the island.

dashcamgifs,fg9bvk4,t1_fg8nqcq,1580636698.0,It’s actually simpler than that. Wearing helmets makes them hot in this climate and the sweat and dust makes them dirty. Nothing to do with coolness or recklessness.
dashcamgifs,fg8nkzf,t1_fg8n9i0,1580625591.0,Well looking down my local Main Street here (which is really QL27) I can see plenty without their helmets.

Damnthatsinteresting,fg8cufy,t1_fg8a7lh,1580615780.0,Probably like the Japanese they don’t have a lot of space to work with so their are more efficient with it. Plus if you have to spend a lot or time indoors during the depths of winter you would want your spaces to look nice.
gatekeeping,fg87bbp,t1_fg86a1x,1580611433.0,"So the question is, are the coaches in ballet doing the right thing by their students to let the injuries get like this?"
gatekeeping,fg83slx,t1_fg829ez,1580608769.0,Yeah but I don’t think a ten year old has really good decision making skills. I’m sure a ten year old soccer player probably would play with a concussion if they could.
gatekeeping,fg830sg,t1_fg8287s,1580608174.0,"Well in those case for ballet the injuries shown are through *normal* routine dancing. Not by accident. 

That’s why I’m asking for cheerleading. Maybe the drops and throws cause spine compressions regardless of how well they are done etc.? Certainly looks like they would."
gatekeeping,fg81sky,t1_fg80pn9,1580607234.0,"No disrespect to cheerleaders, cause I couldn’t do it either but would you have gotten those injuries if they didn’t mess up?"

gatekeeping,fg6ge7k,t1_fg6ep0t,1580567231.0,I never said that dancers didn’t. I’m only saying how taking a hit can be advantageous as being able to dodge them. I’ve said in other comments I would likely never be able to push myself for art like they do.
Wellthatsucks,fg6euy3,t3_ex5ced,1580565924.0,This is why I have three main cables and two back ups and two secondary back ups stashed away on every trip. Damn Apple and their fragile proprietary connectors.
gatekeeping,fg6eeo1,t1_fg6def3,1580565519.0,"Never said it was, just noting that it was more than you would expect and therefore you sometimes gotta sit back in awe at the lengths people will go through for their art. I certainly don’t think I could."
gatekeeping,fg6dzv8,t1_fg6aepd,1580565141.0,Well actually part of the fight occurs before the fight as you know. If you have the reputation for taking hits and shrugging them off that’s gotta be a big psychological advantage going into the next match. The opponent may get shy about throwing hits around in case they are ineffective or worse get themselves tangled up.
gatekeeping,fg68l6z,t1_fg66i1l,1580559077.0,“Suffering for one’s art “ is possibly the ego trip you are mentioning. War wounds and a ‘gate keeping’ of sorts for new practitioners.

BlackPeopleTwitter,fg5dl9m,t1_fg5bo9f,1580524659.0,Yep that’s one of the biggest appeal of it. I’ve used movies in the past as an excuse to get away from people and just sleep it off. Expensive sleep but if you find it hard to turn it all off and wind down it’s worth it.

Damnthatsinteresting,fg31we3,t3_ewlals,1580466505.0,"This is one of the things I noticed in recent years in Vietnam which has similar problems with traffic. We used to use our horns as sonar so that people knew where we were. With people darting in and out of traffic lanes it was effective but very noisy. These days I don’t know what they’ve done but there is a lot less honking, almost non existent in some areas where you would expect it. Maybe it’s the transition to cars?
