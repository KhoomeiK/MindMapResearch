""Mind over matter"" is how some friends suggest I handle the excruciating nerve pain. How in the fuck is that gonna work?"

fatlogic,fcykn10,t1_fcx5w0j,1578081733.0,"Outside of actual medical conditions making it a tad too difficult at the moment (I know, I know... sounds like an excuse but they're valid!), I self sabotage a lot. That's just the mental struggle on my end. However, I think about the gym a lot. It's not super far from my house and I used to work out in college (about 12 years ago). I CAN do it. It's been done before.

I'm just kinda stuck with these medical conditions. One of them is most likely going to involve surgery at some point. The other is the slow recovery from nerve damage in my feet. I could maybe work around the feet problem. It would be incredibly painful but I'm sure I could find something that works for me. The other one? I dunno. I'm asking around to see if I can get this surgery thing done sooner rather than later.

When the surgery/recovery is complete, I do plan on getting this gym thing sorted. :-)"

fatlogic,fcw48vg,t3_ej6o9x,1578016788.0,"As a fat man, it disgusts me that this HAES shit exists. Us fatties aren't owed shit. We're this way because it's what we've chosen. We SHOULD be told that what we're doing is unhealthy and why we're having all the health problems we are.

Sure, no one should be spoken down to about it but at least be fucking mature enough to realize you're the goddamn problem.

I say this as I'm downing some Pringles. I'm fat because I haven't hit that point to change... but it's coming. 

Besides... if you make fun of me for being fat... what am I gonna do, chase you? Pfft."
