todayilearned,fc44ykc,t1_fc3oezw,1577406759.0,"Tactics and technology changed a lot in the 80 years in between the two conflicts and the United States operated its military differently than the European superpowers who fielded permanent professional armies. The US relied mostly on a small frontier army, mostly designed to combat threats from Native Americans and Mexico. In this role, they performed better than most would have expected. In 1861 however, the necessity of recruiting hundreds of thousands of men in a short time, both volunteers and conscripted men, put a massive burden on the military of both sides to be able to train all of those men properly. In addition many of the soldiers fighting were not federal troops but instead joined into state militias or fought asymmetrical warfare as â€œbushwhackersâ€, especially in the western parts of the country. 

It is likely that the lack of uniformity was the main critique, but also remember that the French, British Ottomans, and Russians had fought a bloody war in the Crimea with many military failings on both sides due to the inexperience of using new technology that had been made recently available.  Critiquing the US was easy when you already had the experience of just recently coming out of a conflict where you own side had the same issues. And it was unlikely that the US would have spent much time sending military observers to the various conflicts around the world when US foreign policy was primarily to avoid military contact with Europe."
