badhistory,fffsv2d,t1_fffqbhp,1579891061.0,"Hmm. Sorry OP, I'm afraid I'm not convinced. Here are my reasoning:

First, I do not think that what the person is saying is ""every nation must eventually be colonizers"". From what I understand in the context, what they're saying is ""if you want to grow bigger/richer/more powerful above a certain level, war (or colonization) is inevitable"".

And I agree with that statement; pacifist nation-states are aberrations. I can only think of one pacifist polity, the Maurya Empire under Ashoka, and even that came into being after the relentless bloodshed under both Ashoka and Chandragupta.

Likewise, scarcity is not the same thing as greed, but greed + scarcity = exploration and conflict. For example, the European powers traipsed all across Asia because they are greedy for spices, which are scarce. 

> *if scarcity motivated colonization then poorer countries would be raiding wealthier ones.*

That didn't happen because poorer countries, by and large, are weaker than wealthier ones. Colonization and war **can be** motivated by scarcity and greed, but it's not the **only** determinator. Likewise,

> *Those who had the most resources were doing the enslavement, theft, betrayal, deceit, and killing.*

I agree. If you're a poorly-developed country with an abundance of, say, nutmeg, and I'm an European country with abundant resources such as soldiers, cannons and all sorts of sharp, pointy objects, you can bet your britches I will be, er, ""liberating"" you of your spices. 

__________

In conclusion, I cannot agree with your post. But if you do not feel like arguing it with me any further, feel free to contact the other mods to ask for a third-party adjudication."

I'm going to disagree with this.

Whether someone deserves to be punished (in this case, punching) depends on whether or not that person deserves it. Actively participating in a fascist government's actions qualifies.

Neither ""defenseless"" nor ""old"" matter. If we can catch a violent criminal while he is defenseless (e.g., while he's sleeping), should we refrain because it's ""not fair""? And likewise, why would someone escape punishment because ""he's old""? 

You might say ""an old person might die from being punched"", but all that's telling me is that if you want to punch said old person, you better be sure that he or she has committed a crime grave enough that death is a justifiable punishment for it.

badhistory,fffsv2d,t1_fffqbhp,1579891061.0,"Hmm. Sorry OP, I'm afraid I'm not convinced. Here are my reasoning:

First, I do not think that what the person is saying is ""every nation must eventually be colonizers"". From what I understand in the context, what they're saying is ""if you want to grow bigger/richer/more powerful above a certain level, war (or colonization) is inevitable"".

And I agree with that statement; pacifist nation-states are aberrations. I can only think of one pacifist polity, the Maurya Empire under Ashoka, and even that came into being after the relentless bloodshed under both Ashoka and Chandragupta.

Likewise, scarcity is not the same thing as greed, but greed + scarcity = exploration and conflict. For example, the European powers traipsed all across Asia because they are greedy for spices, which are scarce. 

> *if scarcity motivated colonization then poorer countries would be raiding wealthier ones.*

That didn't happen because poorer countries, by and large, are weaker than wealthier ones. Colonization and war **can be** motivated by scarcity and greed, but it's not the **only** determinator. Likewise,

> *Those who had the most resources were doing the enslavement, theft, betrayal, deceit, and killing.*

I agree. If you're a poorly-developed country with an abundance of, say, nutmeg, and I'm an European country with abundant resources such as soldiers, cannons and all sorts of sharp, pointy objects, you can bet your britches I will be, er, ""liberating"" you of your spices.

Also things like the story and cinematics matter more to me than mechanics (unless if said mechanics is so horrible I'm forced to throw my hands up and go ""really guys?"").

That said, I like how ""chunky"" BfA end-bosses are. Both Jaina and Azshara takes a lot of effort with tons of mechanics, things that make me tear my hair out in frustration (but in a good way).

Story-wise, I love the last Legion raid, and I can't comment on the BfA one yet since I'm not there yet. According to r/wow ""it sucks"", but then again according to r/wow this game is ""dead"" several times over."

I think it's funny whenever someone wants to talk about how bad the game is, suddenly they've played the alpha and is besties with Mike Morhaime. But what the hell I'm bored atm, so I'll take this challenge.

* story is underwhelming - well okay, I can't say anything about that, my alt hasn't reached 120 yet. I'll get back to you later. Although if you want lame stories, try the last Cata raid cinematic.

* everything is broken - no it's not.

* game is eating gold - you mean the issue with the AH? Well, here's to hoping it'll be fixed soon. Although if ""something minor that was recently revamped got broken"" is what qualifies as ""worst expac ever"", then you you might be exaggerating things.

* loot system is broken - wut?

* servers are going down - again, wut?

* daily launcher error messages - since the patch, there's only the ""AH issue"" on my launcher. ""Game will be offline for an hour while we do maintenance"" don't count.

* nothing until Shadowlands - you already finished the raid? On the second day? Well okay, granted that bites if you have absolutely nothing else to do (*how*? The game is huge). But y'know, there's 7 months between 7.3.5 and BfA, so maybe this expac is not as different as all the other ones.

SelfAwarewolves,ff66pps,t1_ff4yndh,1579620445.0,"> Iâ€™m saying that going a up to defenseless old man and punching him in the face is a bad idea.

I'm going to disagree with this.

Whether someone deserves to be punished (in this case, punching) depends on whether or not that person deserves it. Actively participating in a fascist government's actions qualifies.

Neither ""defenseless"" nor ""old"" matter. If we can catch a violent criminal while he is defenseless (e.g., while he's sleeping), should we refrain because it's ""not fair""? And likewise, why would someone escape punishment because ""he's old""? 

You might say ""an old person might die from being punched"", but all that's telling me is that if you want to punch said old person, you better be sure that he or she has committed a crime grave enough that death is a justifiable punishment for it. 

I wouldn't punch an old guy who stole money, but I sure would a Nazi if I can get away with it."
