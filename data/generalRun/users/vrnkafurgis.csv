If you must know, smartass, I took out the majority of these loans when I was 18 (too young to buy cigarettes). I got a full scholarship to a t14 law school and have had a the same union position in a public service career for the last eight years. It’s not that I can’t find a job, so you can take your assumptions and fuck right off.

Edit: Also, my structural barrier is the high interest rate on my loans. It’s the fact that the CFBP has been gutted so nobody gives a shit that I got completely fucked over by the corrupt providers who fucked up my loans so $50k of them won’t be forgiven in two years. I don’t even face the structural barriers of racism, homelessness, addiction, incarceration, etc."
BeAmazed,ffitml1,t3_etuesc,1579982414.0,I fucking love this guy. He makes my soul happy.

MadeMeSmile,ffijeya,t1_ffij4c7,1579975295.0,"So it means I’m not going to singlehandedly take down the entire animal product industry by myself and I’m doing what I can by abstaining from all animal products except my friend’s pet chicken’s eggs, so get off your virtue-signaling high horse and accept that something is better than nothing.

Edit: I mean, Jesus. This all-or-nothing mentality is so harmful. You give people a false dichotomy and make them think they have to give up EVERY animal product in order to make a difference, which means they don’t even try, because immediate perfection is unattainable. What if you removed that false dichotomy and instead supported people who are at least trying, knowing that by taking small steps, those people might be completely and sustainably vegan in a few years? 

To be clear, I don’t give a shit what you think; my concern is more for those who are on the fence and don’t want to be lambasted."

europe,ffi8nzw,t1_ffi4cdu,1579967941.0,"Yeah, that’s bullshit. That’s not true at all of the sentencing guidelines. 

And you’re not cuddled. One of my heroin clients was just brutally raped in prison, so fuck your maliciously ignorant statement.

CrappyDesign,ffi7u3u,t1_ffi14lu,1579967353.0,I’m not color blind (just had a vision test last month) and I have a very hard time telling which is which.
ABoringDystopia,ffi7fzq,t1_ffi6p46,1579967071.0,"Yeah, that was a completely absurd statement that shows the person has no idea what it’s like to actually face structural barriers. I’m a lawyer living alone, I work two other jobs (for a total of 70 hours per week), and I live paycheck to paycheck. Oh, and I started with $130k in student loans; after eight years of on-time IBR payments, I owe ~$140k. 

PLUS I just found out my loan provider fucked up eight years ago, and $50k of my loans will not be forgiven in two years like they should be (I work in public service). 

The structural barriers are a goddamn concrete wall between you and your bootstraps, and anyone who thinks you just need to work harder is a goddamn sycophantic blowhard who just wants to roll over and present their ass a little easier for the billionaires."
