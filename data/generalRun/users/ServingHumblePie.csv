bipolar,fdqtzkn,t3_emm9pq,1578674836.0,"If I may indulge you one time with a story of when my illness really kicked in. I’m back visiting the city to where I had one of my first mental breaks. And I feel like I should revisit the experience to compare and contrast to where I am today.


It was fifteen years ago in a major US city. I was nineteen at the time. Estranged from my father, who had embezzled my scholarship money and ruined the path I dreamed of since I could remember. I was at the end of a week long gambling binge where I lost more money than you want to lose to the people who were accepting my wagers. I was popping Xanax every night and drunk dialing a girl who broke my heart so much where I should have been served a restraining order or taken to jail for stalking.


It was a warm, clear summer night. Sitting in my windowsill in my second floor apartment, bong in hand. My heart was racing and my mind at full go. I wanted to die so bad. I only had about nine Xanax left, which I didn’t think was enough to OD on. There was a tree just outside of my reach, I contemplated many a nights how I could get a rope up there. I googled how to tie a noose. But I lived in a well traveled street. It’s not guaranteed I’d die. I was scared to survive my suicide attempt.
I needed to see her. Confront her. Tell her how hurt I was and I miss and love her. Explain my behavior and apologize profusely. Then proceed to scream and berate her for leading me on so much and pulling the rug from under me. But she lived two hours away and I had no car.


A few months prior, my uncle bought me a pistol grip crossbow. I took a screwdriver and took it apart. In the dark night, you couldn’t tell it wasn’t a real gun. And someone was about to lose their car that night. I put it in my waistband and walked out the door. I went down a quiet residential road, waiting for the right moment, someone just getting home from a late night. Someone who would be scared of this young, tall, and frightening man and would give up their keys without a second thought.


I waited for an hour and no opportunities arose. I must go towards downtown a bit more. There’s more people. I look down an alleyway, a sidestreet, and I see it. An older couple laughing, holding hands walking to their car. I have to do this now or never. The angel and devil were on my shoulders debating what I should do. At this moment, the angel won. The devil, not to be defeated moved me to walk back to the quiet streets. Be patient he said.


On my walk back, a random woman walked up asking me if I wanted some crack. Curious, I asked how much. $5 she said. I wasn’t buying, I had no money anyway. But I wanted to know what it feels like. She says it makes you do anything you want and feel alive. I chuckle and tell her to have a good night and be safe.
Continuing on my journey, back to the ritzy quiet streets, the homes that I would never be able to afford even if I saved my entire salary for two years probably still couldn’t have a down payment. I sat on someone’s stoop. Depressed and sad. Wondering what I’m doing with my life. Another car pulls up. A man, twenty years my senior looks at me with disgust. He knew I didn’t belong there. But he didn’t know my pain. I could walk up behind him, cold cock him from behind, push him into his home where I demand keys and wallet. But the angel fought me off one more time.


Fuck it. I’m not built for this. I start walking back home. Two blocks into my walk, the angel appears again, but it’s just the devil behind a mask. A man stops his car in the middle of the street and gets out. It’s 2am at this point and he’s leaving his car right for the taking. He’s an elderly man, he’s dropping off a letter to the mailbox. This is my golden moment. No violence needed. Just walk up to the car and get in. Speed away. And off to see the one who is the only reason why I kept living. Hoping that she would save me.


The old man places his letter in the mail and in a pang of guilt, I think of my grandmother. What would I think if someone pulled this shit on my grandmother. Third time. The angel finally sends me home for the night.
I stay up all night debating my future. I can’t go into work that day. I’m a mess. And it’s the day I have to pay up for my gambling loses. I went for broke that week and ended up broke. Surprise. I put on my favorite DVD at the time, Fight Club. I rip the bong again. Half watching the movie, I contemplate the end. The bridge is the only surefire way to go. I’ll go at daybreak. It’ll be beautiful.
Then Tyler Durden says....”It's only after we've lost everything that we're free to do anything.” It’s an epiphany. A giant weight was lifted off my shoulders. The pain was still there but I knew that I would live for another day. I had nothing to lose anymore. I already hit rock bottom. I decided then and there that I’ll do whatever I want to do, because if I fail, fuck it, I’ll just kill myself later.
24 hours later, after making a convincing lie to a charity organization, I was on an airplane headed to a new place. A place to restart my life. How I was going to pay for it I don’t know, but it’s a start.


The rest is a whole other story. But I want to end by saying that it’s been over a decade since that day. And I’m still alive. I’ve gotten help from so many friends and family. I’m medicated and I feel like I’m normal. I no longer want to kill myself and I’m forever grateful to that angel on my shoulder for guiding me away from ruining my life on multiple occasions. I hope I’ve inspired some of you that it can and does get better.
Much love."
