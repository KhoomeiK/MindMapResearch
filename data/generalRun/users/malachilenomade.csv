Since it was only a week late, that was totally absurd and I never went to that store again.  FYI, information like that does not get shared amongst the stores. I was never asked to pay that from any other Blockbuster."

bizarrebuildings,fenfl2q,t1_fencd4j,1579283625.0,"I knew someone just had to say that. Actually, they didn't... his totally fucked up childhood gave us Charles Manson. Hippies were non-violent so the idea of being part of his cult would have been abhorrent."
bizarrebuildings,fenc70l,t3_epwiz9,1579281558.0,"You say cult, but the description of it is actually pretty chill. They sound about as cultish as the hippies in the 60s were."

I really don't understand why people still complain about the DMV/MVA because they've changed their system around and really rock 'n roll to get as many done as quickly as possible."

I was sad to hear the second would be so small but I'm not going to gripe about it (the 'sexual tension' between the lead actor and actress in Atlantic Rim was.... wow.... I'm sure at some point, she surely punched him while the cameras were off).

If MST3k goes no farther, we have a TON of episodes to enjoy."

Like many films they covered, I feel like there was a strong idea there, but there wasn't the budget or skill to make it actually happen.  Sort of like a Ray Steckler film.... the premise & desire is there, but everything else is just abominable.
