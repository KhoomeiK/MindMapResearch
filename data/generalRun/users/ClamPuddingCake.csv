SkincareAddiction,ffirrhl,t3_ed8yyp,1579981076.0,"Have you ever heard of the cosmetic ingredient hotlist? The government of Canada assesses chemicals to determine if they are toxic (harmful to humans and or the environment). This includes chemicals found in cosmetics. When a risk is found, the government implements some sort of risk management action. One tool is the cosmetic ingredient hotlist. It will list cosmetic and skin care ingredients that are prohibited or restricted to a safe concentration in Canada. This is a reliable source of information on the safety of chemicals in cosmetic and skin care products. There is also a natural health product ingredient database that is similar, some skin care products may be classified as natural health products instead of cosmetics.

In any case, the government of Canada website should have all this information. Look at the chemical management plan."
