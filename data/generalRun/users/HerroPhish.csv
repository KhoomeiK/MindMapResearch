dogs,ffla2cx,t1_ffjna0v,1580036905.0,Idk why this is getting downvoted...dogs understand punishment when its timely. Having a good no command to a dog is pretty useful.
dogs,ffl8mhl,t3_etkbe7,1580036347.0,"So Im just gonna say this, Im surprised nobody has yet. 

Having a puppy when you work a 7-5 everyday is going to be impossible unless you have someone helping you all day. I have a standard poodle and my roommate has a Frenchie. His dog is definitely way less effort than mine, but I dont know he wouldve lasted alone for 10 hours a day. A dog walker wouldnt cut it either... time commitments on a puppy are not easy at all. Also, I felt it was nice bonding with my pup a lot at first. 

Im a bachelor also that used to work hours similar to yours. I only really was able to get a dog when I decided on a complete lifestyle change. I also had my gf help me out a ton at the time.

If you come back once a day, so that 4-5 hour window, Id still say this wont be easy on a puppy. Youd probably need help in between that at first. Once your dog is like 5-6 months old Id say itll be okay."

tretinoin,ffbh3ib,t3_esm2qu,1579765007.0,"I was about to post a thread with this.

Been using Tret for like 8 months now. I would cleanse only at night. My skin just wasnt doing so well. I was still breaking out and I was getting frustrated and wanted to quit Tret.

I stopped cleansing. I wash my face with water morning and evening. Morning I just moisturize and put on sunscreen. Night I was with water, moisturize, wait 15 min and put on Tret. 1 day a week I use azaelic acid as it helps get off all the dead skin and exfoliated my skin really nicely (my skin loved azaelic acid. My skin is looking amazing. I havent gotten any new acne and my face doesnt feel dry at all. It actually feels well balanced. I think just letting the Tret do its work is key and not over drying your skin."
tretinoin,ffbgynn,t1_ffaz5zj,1579764839.0,Same. I only get acne outside my beard areas. My beard is really dense so I cant get the Tret through to it. I just do every part outside of it.

PublicFreakout,ffabirt,t1_ffa469j,1579731669.0,"And What I meant on the companion for years comment, is its not so crazy to think that people buy specific dogs with a specific temperament when talking about a pet that will be living with you for years. Its not a small decision to make."
PublicFreakout,ffa9pt4,t1_ffa469j,1579730628.0,"So it depends. And I am not against getting a dog from a shelter at all. I have my own issues with pitbulls, but thats neither here nor there.  

Honestly for my next dog I will probably get a greyhound. Or adopt an older dog depending on whats out there. Puppies kinda suck and they were a lot of energy. 

Heres the thing for me, and Ill lay it out on why I bought a dog from a breeder. Im 28, single, active, and I live in a highly dog populated area. My apartment complex has its own dog park. I can bring my dog to work. I am slightly allergic to dogs and I was never bothered by dogs with hair instead of fur. Putting all this together I came fo the conclusion that a standard poodle would fit me well. Having the dog as a puppy would give me the opportunity to socialize the dog with other dogs, bring the dog to work w me so it got used to it. It felt like a safer option. Rescue dogs can come with their own issues and I didnt know if I had the time or energy to really deal with that. 

Dont get me wrong, my dog is not perfect. Shes an amazing dog and is totally used to my schedule nowadays. She loves dog parks and playing with dogs. Shes just a good companion. Very even tempered like her parents were and shes just fun to be around. I took her on a hike this past weekends, we walked 45 minutes to the beach. Shes kind of exactly what I wanted in a dog. She can hangout when I need her to, be very active when I need. She is a little vocal in my apartment which can be very annoying sometimes but shes quieted a ton in the last 2 months, shes still very young. Overall though shes very well behaved. Most people are shocked when I tell them shes like 10 months old. 

I dont believe that getting dogs from reputable breeders puts another dog in a shelter. There are tons of shady breeders out there that have bad practices that can definitely lead to more dogs in shelters. But breeders doing the right thing leads to dogs going to good homes. 

No matter what getting a dog is a risk, you dont know what the dog will be like as it gets older. Rescuing a dog can be a beautiful, fulfilling thing - but it just seemed to be more risky and I didnt want to do that. 

All Im saying is people spend money on dogs for a reason and it could be that they wanted a specific dog. And if they went through the right channels and breeder for that dog, that is totally not a bad thing,"
PublicFreakout,ff9xxvt,t1_ff9okac,1579723908.0,"Honestly, there are many many reasons why people do this. 

Ill name a few. Getting a dog that fits your needs. Meaning a breed of dog that works well with your lifestyle. Getting a dog as a puppy also allows you to socialize the dog how you want to. Also, genetics. You meet the parents of the dog and theyre well behaved and dont have mental or physical issues. This gives you a higher chance that your dog will mature into a good adult dog. 

I have no issues if people are buying dogs from reputable breeders. Its a companion you will have for years."
PublicFreakout,ff9xirw,t3_esawu9,1579723658.0,I wonder if this is related to the DCM thing and dog food.

They were bred as fighting dogs and they should be handled as such.

She literally just doesnt bark in public ever. But inside, she can get vocal. Shes aloof with strangers, doesnt really care for them. If she gets to know you she loves you if youre nice to her. Some people can be overbearing and she seems to remember who is. 

Shes always up for long walks and adventures. Athletic as fuck. Loves other dogs and is extremely dog friendly. Very lovable and for sure velcro to me. She follows me everywhere including the bathroom.  Shes also super goofy and lovable to me. My spoo is going to be 50lbs fully grown which I like. Some spoos are like 65-70 so you have to make sure the line is more on the average size.

I definitely think with the right breeder you can get a poodle who would love sports and stuff. Mine currently loves playing and I bet she would enjoy agility which I have to try with her when I get some money together."

After watching videos on them and stuff I think I would lose my mind with a dog with that much energy personally. It seems like a very serious commitment. 

I wanted a medium/large dog that was energetic and something I can take anywhere. I didnt want to deal with shedding so I got a standard poodle. If I was okay with shedding I would personally 100% get a Golden retriever or a Lab. Loving dogs that are energetic and good companions. Greyhounds are awesome also and seem very low maintenance. 

My standard poodle does good in an apt. Shes 50lbs and athletic. I take her for long walks daily and I let her run in the park when I can.

Been using Tret for like 8 months now. I would cleanse only at night. My skin just wasn’t doing so well. I was still breaking out and I was getting frustrated and wanted to quit Tret.

I stopped cleansing. I wash my face with water morning and evening. Morning I just moisturize and put on sunscreen. Night I was with water, moisturize, wait 15 min and put on Tret. 1 day a week I use azaelic acid as it helps get off all the dead skin and exfoliated my skin really nicely (my skin loved azaelic acid.

PublicFreakout,ffa9pt4,t1_ffa469j,1579730628.0,"So it depends. And I am not against getting a dog from a shelter at all. I have my own issues with pitbulls, but that’s neither here nor there.  

Honestly for my next dog I will probably get a greyhound. Or adopt an older dog depending on what’s out there. Puppies kinda suck and they were a lot of energy. 

Here’s the thing for me, and I’ll lay it out on why I bought a dog from a breeder. I’m 28, single, active, and I live in a highly dog populated area. My apartment complex has its own dog park. I can bring my dog to work. I am slightly allergic to dog’s and I was never bothered by dogs with hair instead of fur. Putting all this together I came fo the conclusion that a standard poodle would fit me well. Having the dog as a puppy would give me the opportunity to socialize the dog with other dogs, bring the dog to work w me so it got used to it. It felt like a safer option. Rescue dogs can come with their own issues and I didn’t know if I had the time or energy to really deal with that. 

Don’t get me wrong, my dog is not perfect. She’s an amazing dog and is totally used to my schedule nowadays. She loves dog parks and playing with dogs. She’s just a good companion. Very even tempered like her parents were and she’s just fun to be around. I took her on a hike this past weekends, we walked 45 minutes to the beach. She’s kind of exactly what I wanted in a dog. She can hangout when I need her to, be very active when I need. She is a little vocal in my apartment which can be very annoying sometimes but she’s quieted a ton in the last 2 months, she’s still very young. Overall though she’s very well behaved. Most people are shocked when I tell them she’s like 10 months old. 

I don’t believe that getting dogs from reputable breeders puts another dog in a shelter. There are tons of shady breeders out there that have bad practices that can definitely lead to more dogs in shelters. But breeders doing the right thing leads to dogs going to good homes. 

No matter what getting a dog is a risk, you don’t know what the dog will be like as it gets older. Rescuing a dog can be a beautiful, fulfilling thing - but it just seemed to be more risky and I didn’t want to do that. 

All I’m saying is people spend money on dogs for a reason and it could be that they wanted a specific dog. And if they went through the right channels and breeder for that dog, that is totally not a bad thing,"
PublicFreakout,ff9xxvt,t1_ff9okac,1579723908.0,"Honestly, there are many many reasons why people do this. 

I’ll name a few. Getting a dog that fits your needs. Meaning a breed of dog that works well with your lifestyle. Getting a dog as a puppy also allows you to socialize the dog how you want to. Also, genetics. You meet the parents of the dog and they’re well behaved and don’t have mental or physical issues. This gives you a higher chance that your dog will mature into a good adult dog. 

I have no issues if people are buying dogs from reputable breeders. It’s a companion you will have for years."

She literally just doesn’t bark in public ever. But inside, she can get vocal. She’s aloof with strangers, doesn’t really care for them. If she gets to know you she loves you if you’re nice to her. Some people can be overbearing and she seems to remember who is. 

She’s always up for long walks and adventures. Athletic as fuck. Loves other dogs and is extremely dog friendly. Very lovable and for sure velcro to me. She follows me everywhere including the bathroom.  She’s also super goofy and lovable to me. My spoo is going to be 50lbs fully grown which I like. Some spoos are like 65-70 so you have to make sure the line is more on the average size.

I definitely think with the right breeder you can get a poodle who would love sports and stuff. Mine currently loves playing and I bet she would enjoy agility which I have to try with her when I get some money together."

After watching videos on them and stuff I think I would lose my mind with a dog with that much energy personally. It seems like a very serious commitment. 

I wanted a medium/large dog that was energetic and something I can take anywhere. I didn’t want to deal with shedding so I got a standard poodle. If I was okay with shedding I would personally 100% get a Golden retriever or a Lab. Loving dogs that are energetic and good companions. Greyhounds are awesome also and seem very low maintenance. 

My standard poodle does good in an apt. She’s 50lbs and athletic. I take her for long walks daily and I let her run in the park when I can. She’s usually very okay with that and tired by the end of the day. I believe I could get away with 3 30 minute walks a day. I usually do more though just because I like to take her out when I can and the weather is really nice where I live. She’s very dog friendly and I can take her anywhere really."
BanPitBulls,fed1ia1,t1_feauyfh,1578993981.0,Watched the whole thing. I think every person thinking about getting a pitbull should watch this. This lady knows pitbulls and she literally says “do not get a pitbull if you don’t want dog aggression”
BanPitBulls,fecy65h,t1_feauyfh,1578989441.0,Gonna watch this. Seems interesting.

dogs,feawetk,t3_envhri,1578952874.0,"I remember when I first got my standard poodle pup at 10 weeks old. I thought I got the most lethargic, relaxed puppy in the world. Didn’t bark, just kinda wanted to hangout. I was like okay, well this is kinda odd actually....

Turns out she’s just kinda shy and it took a little while for her to fully open up to me. I worked a ton on socializing her and stuff also. She’s a loudmouth, energetic standard poodle just like the breed standard."
dogs,feavzr3,t1_fe60bku,1578952744.0,That’s actually such a good idea. Dam I would love that! A place to hangout w your dog and grab coffee and stuff.
dogs,feav1nf,t1_feagdc0,1578952445.0,"Interesting. I don’t go much at all, but I’ve strained my back a couple of times and I’ll usually get adjusted and I will feel better in a day or 2. I have been working on very low weighted deadlifts to hopefully strengthen those lower back muscles though."
dogs,feadkrl,t3_eo51pl,1578947357.0,"If the puppy is locked in a laundry room for most of the day because of an aggressive dog in your house, rehome him ASAP or give him to a shelter. You’re literally ruining a dogs life. Also, with that mix if you fuck it up I don’t think it’s going to be headed for anything good in the future."

BanPitBulls,feaa5dl,t3_en4t6a,1578946176.0,"I personally don’t think it’s as known to the public as it should be. Currently, I don’t think shit will be done."
BanPitBulls,fe6vpa0,t1_fe5yy0m,1578906203.0,It really is fucked up isn’t it. Whenever I walk my dog now I’m slightly anxious and wary about dogs near me. The second I see a pit I don’t go anywhere near them. It’s just frustrating.
BanPitBulls,fe6vnkb,t1_fe4yy6w,1578906130.0,Man. I literally had a nightmare last night that my standard poodle girl got attacked by a pitbull. It scared the shit out of me and I was walking her around today in a public area and was really cautious about the dogs she meets (I really hate and try to avoid meeting random dogs I don’t know out in public).
dogs,fdyqlbw,t3_en8fej,1578782551.0,"I think they just care about their dogs. If it’s a reputable breeder they put time and effort into your puppy and they want the dog to have a healthy/happy life. 

As long as your dog is well groomed, healthy weight, and loved, I am sure they will be happy."

doggrooming,fdusjot,t1_fdurgs4,1578738138.0,Gotcha. Thanks! My pup is only 8 months old so I’m learning. Appreciate this. I’ll definitely comb more.
BanPitBulls,fduoaer,t3_emzgbz,1578736192.0,"I think they should be banned being off leash end of story.

I also think there should be a movement pushing other breeds of dogs and euthanizing the pitbulls that are in shelters. There’s absolutely no reason pitbulls need to exist. Why is there a need for a dog that kills other dogs and humans...There are so many breeds of dogs available. They should be phased out. I don’t think killing other people’s pets is the correct move, but there just shouldn’t be anymore of them being available for anyone to go get from a shelter"
dogs,fdu41ac,t3_emnqy7,1578727156.0,"Lol I call my dog “Senator Moira”

Her name is Mila and she’s a brown standard poodle. She’s a little sassy and very bossy in our apartment. If we move furniture or something she has to “approve”. She’s just the boss of my apartment. She’s like a little old lady and a  puppy all in one. Don’t get me wrong she’s extremely playful and funny, but at times I call her the Senator of my apartment. I came up with Moira because it sounded like Mila and it’s an older lady like name. So she’s Senator Moira."
doggrooming,fdu2bik,t1_fdt6sls,1578726267.0,Really? Slicker does nothing? I have a poodle. She doesn’t get matted much from what I can see but I use the slicker mainly. She’s also not in a long cut. I use the comb occasionally and on her head a lot.
