If you see deer in the ditch you don’t just hammer down and hope they don’t jump out at you. You slow down so when they do jump out you have a better chance of avoiding them.

funny,feob7lv,t1_feo7kyf,1579297685.0,I guess the lesson to learn here is that you shouldn’t skim a one sentence reply when someone talking to you. Do you just space out occasionally when someone is talking to you?
MovieDetails,fene08v,t1_fen6ylf,1579282661.0,"I said I question your comprehension skills because you can’t see why it could be likely that the insane guy could not be reliable in telling a story. Yeah he’s not “narrating” in the sense that he is doing voice over or we are hearing his thoughts. But we are seeing his thoughts. His daydream about being on the show is his thoughts. His “dates” are his thoughts. He is still the narrator and he is unreliable.

I don’t care that you don’t think the same way as me or other people about the ending. But you are saying there isn’t enough evidence to point out that he could possibly be in the asylum the whole time and the filmmakers would have made it more clear if he were. Well I think there isn’t enough evidence that he was arrested at the end and the filmmakers would have made that more clear. We saw an ambiguous ending different ways and you refuse to accept that it could be any different then how you see it.

It’s not me saying it was intentional. The director said he did it intentionally. He wanted the audience to interpret it their own way. And I’m not cherry picking things from other versions. The director stated he was influenced by the idea of the “multiple choice background” from day one and tried to work with that idea. 

This article was written before there were plans for a sequel so these were the directors thoughts while making this movie. Now we will see what he does with the sequel to either say which fans were right in their interpretations or find a way to continue the ambiguity of the character and raise only further questions."

And it was his fault because he didn’t clear his throat before entering to announce he was coming. Her husband also didn’t announce he was coming, so she finished him off while her son watched “so that he would learn his lesson” *cue vile laugh and look of disgust on Conan’s face* Then she was mad at her son because he wouldn’t kiss her the next morning..."

nottheonion,fek2mag,t1_fejz583,1579191290.0,Even your example is shit because that's the same everywhere not just France. According to you all American churches are full of flaws and only do horrible shit. But you may be surprised to find out some are generous organizations that usually help homeless and poor people!
MovieDetails,fejv9gy,t1_fejsb39,1579186648.0,"Because some film makers and story tellers like to leave things ambiguous and make the audience decide what happened? Just because Fight Club spells it out for you at the end and you can go back and rewatch it and things are noticeable to support that doesn't mean that this has to be the same. What was in the brief case in Pulp Fiction? What happened to Tony Soprano at the restaurant? Ambiguous endings aren't exactly unheard of in film making. 

The fact that you are saying that a movie being told from the perspective of an insane person (a character who in other films/comics has stated wants his origin story to be ambiguous) who is established to be an unreliable narrator has to have a clear ending makes me question your comprehension skills. 

You say there is not nearly enough to support that this could possibly be what the film makers tried to convey, but there is and you just don't like it so you say that can't be right. How did he end up back in the asylum at the end when just before he was a free man with a crowd worshiping him? Obviously the crowd wouldn't just hand him over to the cops, he was the face of their new movement and their idol. I just don't think there is nearly enough to think this was the filmmakers' intention."
MovieDetails,fejs2oy,t1_fejcrou,1579184456.0,"Especially because the first words in the title are ""In Joker(2019)"". That should have been a clue to either stop reading if you wanted to be spoiler free or not complain about seeing the mildest of spoilers."
MovieDetails,fejrnkm,t1_fejowr3,1579184144.0,Of course that is their intention. Makes you question if anything you just saw was real or imagined. If the Joker is going to have a backstory he would prefer it to be multiple choice. 100% intentional on their part.
MovieDetails,fejqpvb,t1_fejpdvq,1579183455.0,"You don't really know that for sure though, it's never confirmed by any evidence and the only people that think that are insane. Same with the picture at the end with the initials TW leading you to think it was all true, but you can't really be sure. Did Thomas Wayne actually write that? Did his mom actually write that and put those initials on there? Did Arthur just imagine that like he did so many other things throughout the movie?"
