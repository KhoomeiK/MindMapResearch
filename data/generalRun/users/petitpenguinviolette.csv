The way his workbench and radial arm saw were set up, the sawdust would fall behind the bench (where the insulation would be placed in the walls).  The bracing of the bench prevented the sawdust from just falling onto the floor.  

He was working on a project where he would cut however many boards, go install/build, come back and cut more.  It was easier to leave the garage door open.  

When he was finished he grabbed the shopvac and started getting the sawdust under control.  He was vacuuming the area behind the bench where the sawdust piled up.

fuckHOA,ffwhxto,t3_evha0w,1580301617.0,"I saw in the comments of your first post that you stated the trash service said they charge $250 per month.  Could they have said $250 per week?  Because $250 x 4 weeks = $1000 per month.  

I am guessing that your complex has a large metal container, where they bring an empty one with them when picking up the full one.  (Where I live they try to do this to cut down on the number of trips.)  Here, each home has a plastic rolling bin to put our trash in.  The garbage truck has a mechanical arm that picks up the can and tips it upside down over the top of the truck and then sets it back down.  

The largest size is around 90 gallons.  (Holds 5 to 6 kitchen sized trash bags).  It costs about $30 per month.  If your complex has the big metal dumpsters, it doesn’t seem like paying $62.50 weekly for twice a week pickup would be enough.  

Now that you have a bill, can you call the trash service and ask them to explain it to you?  You can also ask them if you are getting twice weekly trash removal.  (I am thinking that your HOA is just saying they have it.  Because you have never seen the second pickup happen and I still think that it’s $250 per pickup.  Meaning that twice weekly pickup would be $500 per week).  

Calling the trash service company is where I would start in trying to unravel this mystery.  Get your questions answered and make sure your facts are correct.  

Good luck!"

Angry email incoming.  

Okay, if that’s how you want to roll.  

I promptly called the phone company to let them know this chick swears my email address is hers.  They told me that they had no way of knowing who she was so they weren’t sure how they could help me.  (Or something like that it’s been a couple decades since this happened).  

I asked them if they would like me to forward the email and replies to them as she emailed me from her student email at the college.  In which the address is your full first and last name.  Sure they said.

OP, if your state has this your mom has to give you this form.  It is extra money you are owed.  In my state it is tied into the property taxes somehow.  If you have a tax guy fill out your taxes ask them about it.  They will know if your state does this or something similar."

You will have to provide documentation to the IRS and file a paper claim.  I honestly would have a tax person help if it gets to this point.  

Once the second person provides proof and the IRS reviews and accepts it, a refund will be sent.  The first person however, is only just starting their fun.

organization,fflgles,t3_eu4e8v,1580039472.0,"Is there a way to add shelves?  My closets had the braces for a shelf above the hanging bar but no shelf.  We ‘made’ a shelf (cut a 1 x 6 to the length needed).  I then had a lot of vertical space and put a couple of those white plastic coated metal grid shelves (possibly Rubbermaid makes them) on the new shelf.  I can stack clothing on top of the grid shelf and on the new shelf (under the grid shelf) I have some bins for smaller items and folded t-shirts directly on the shelf.  

Another closet I put 2 bookshelves I already had in it side by side.  They happened to be matching.  This closet is wider than it is deep.  If I count the top of the book case, each has 5 shelves.  The hanging bar can’t be used, but that’s okay as I can fit more on the shelves.   

I did have clothing in that closet.  Then decided that it should be for my craft supplies.  Now it has an identity crisis and I have to solve that sometime soon.  

Other things that I have seen (but haven’t tried) are the fabric thing that hangs from the hanging bar and has 4 or 5 shelves.  It’s maybe a sweater (something...hanging shelves or something).  

There are over the door shoe organizers.  Basically plastic pockets.  In addition to shoes, they are good for small items.  

One last thing I did do.  I have wooden hangers with the part that hangs over the rod being metal.  (This is important - that part has to be narrow, not bulky like the plastic hangers).  I took tabs off the top of pop cans.  There are 2 holes in the tab.  The larger hole I slid the metal part of the hanger that was going to hang on the rod.    Through the smaller bottom hole I slid another hanger.  Then you can get twice the number of items hung.  I can imagine you could put another tab on the 2nd hanger to use a 3rd hanger I’d you wish.  I haven’t tried it.

JustNoSO,ffkwc23,t3_eu1jo6,1580030190.0,"Sometimes it’s easier to make your point by showing how it’s possible or not possible.  

Look online for apartments in your area.  The ad should state the monthly rent, what utilities are included and amenities (like off street parking and so on).  Take note of the address.  

Where I live, I can call the electric, gas and water companies and tell them I am considering renting an apartment at (address).  They will tell me the last 12 months usage/amount due each month.  Ask if a deposit is required.  

Think of your other expenses you each have.  Car payment, car insurance, renters insurance (usually you can bundle with your car insurance for super cheap), student loans, credit cards, cell phone, internet, tv...  

Now for the harder part (for me anyway) how much will you spend on food, clothing, household items, toiletries, entertainment, eating out, gas for your car, building your savings.  

You will also need to have a deposit (usually one month’s rent) + the first month’s rent when you sign your lease.  

And you need to furnish your apartment.  You obviously do not need everything all at once and maybe your parents can loan you some things.  But you will need dishes, utensils, cookware, bed.  You can get by without a table and chairs.  You also wouldn’t be the first people to use a card table and folding chairs.  And also whatever you need for the living room.  

I’m sure I am missing things - hopefully others will mention anything else to consider.  

Once you have your budget and moving expenses figured out and you think it is possible to move out even though money will be tight, you need to consider the what if.  You mentioned being concerned about what will happen this fall when your boyfriend’s job ends and if he can’t find a job then.  

Most leases are 12 months.  So if your lease starts April 1, 2020 it will end March 31, 2021.  The paychecks in October will be partly budgeted for November’s rent and some bills.  Here is where your savings account will help.  

But let’s say December comes, and boyfriend hasn’t found a job.  The landlord can evict you for nonpayment of rent.  If that happens, any background check a future landlord runs will have the eviction show up.  This will make it incredibly more difficult to rent an apartment.  

You are correct to question the feasibility of getting an apartment at this point in time.  By preparing a budget it will show you (and hopefully your boyfriend too) what the true cost is.  

And the information you get from doing this can help you make a real plan to move out by figuring how much you need to save for rent, deposits and so on.  By waiting, you also can take advantage of sales or thrift store finds on items you need to furnish your apartment.  

Sorry.  This is way longer than I intended.  The timing may not be right for an apartment right now, but it will happen one day soon."
