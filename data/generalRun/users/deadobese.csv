hiphopheads,fdkpe6a,t1_fdkcpns,1578508385.0,"How was Peep milked? COWYS2 was an already half-finished album when he passed and it's his best friend / sound engineer that finished it and released it a year after his passing.

There's a bit more of an argument to be had about Everybody's, but even then it was a bit less marketed as a real studio album and more as an OST for the documentary / compilation. And that documentary was the basis to sue his old management for misconduct.

I really don't see how any of that is milking, even if the quality of the albums are a bit subpar to COWYS1 or Crybaby"
