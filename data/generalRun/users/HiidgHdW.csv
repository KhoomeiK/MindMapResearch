But wouldnt people be able to whip up some sort of deadly poison with legal ingredients, or is that not a thing? Idk Ive never really... tried killing somebody ;D"
nihilism,ffcqnwg,t3_esx69b,1579805226.0,"First of all, you shouldnt be pressured by anybody to have kids imo, its your decision.      

Personally, though this isnt necessarily a nihilistic viewpoint, I dont ever want to have children. The reason why is because we humans are basically only made to reproduce and keep the species going, that is our biological ""purpose"".   
Thats why it would feel wrong to me to have children, I wouldnt feel free. Of course you could say Im not ""free"" either way, but hey."

Could just work out at home tbf. I dont work, but Im at school (including bus rides) for 12 hours every day except weekends and I still work out at home 4 times a week... most of the time ;D"
nihilism,fekh9of,t1_fekgopd,1579200012.0,"Agreed, I cant say I dont have sexual desires, but I try my best to sort of ignore them. I often think about how ""powerful"" it would make one to just not have any such desires. Dont have to care much about how you look, about how people see you, dont have to overthink interactions with people you ""like"", etc."
nihilism,fee5d6t,t1_fee3u8a,1579026732.0,"I cant see a world where ""1 thing"" and ""another thing"" are not ""two things"", so... in that sense, I think so. Though ""logic"" is a pretty broad term."

Fortunately it was a very short phase (~1-2 weeks), but unfortunately I dont really know what made it stop.    The only advice I could give is to self reflect and think a lot. Maybe you have inner conflict or something that put you in this state."

nihilism,fdy7l7l,t1_fdy69sc,1578776904.0,"I mean, its quite the long and hard read especially with english not being my first language :D     
You could just tell me your argument against ""we are capable of feeling empathy for other groups"" if you have one."
nihilism,fdy5u2y,t1_fdy138p,1578776433.0,"So basically... Having more empathy for people of ""your"" group than others can be dangerous? Seems pretty logical to me I guess, yeah.        
My only point, really, was that we can feel empathy for other races etc., is that wrong? Even if it was less, you would still feel empathy."
nihilism,fdy0k8n,t1_fdxwweg,1578774782.0,"And what would that dissonance be? Also you said ""humans are not capable of co-operation and empathy for others that don't look like us"", which isnt true, so..."
nihilism,fdxq7tc,t1_fdxnely,1578771717.0,"I kinda doubt that, but either way, humans are definitely capable of empathy and cooperation. If anything, some may choose to ignore that empathy out of hatred or greed or whatever."

nihilism,fdnyzw4,t3_emdqa1,1578595715.0,"What I tell myself is basically this argument: There are 2 states you can be in, happy and not happy (and dead as third one I guess). Personally I prefer the first one, and I have to keep going in order to stay happy in the future.      

Why even strive to be happy? Well, because it feels good, and giving up is not an option for me because I would feel like life won and I lost. Childish? Maybe, but... hey :D"
nihilism,fdlgkxd,t1_fdlg1y6,1578523567.0,">It would only be bad if there exists an individual to be missing out on it. The individual doesn’t exist at that point, so can’t miss out. The needs and desires of a non existent being are zero.     

Shouldnt there then, in the same way, be no individual to be missing out on the suffering? Therefore the absence of pain is not good but neutral, so there is no asymmetry?"
nihilism,fdlfqnd,t1_fdledbq,1578523051.0,"Just looking at the graph, Im not sure I agree. If pain is bad and the absence of it is good, then shouldnt the absence of pleasure (good) be bad?

nihilism,fdkymi0,t1_fdktyno,1578513848.0,"The question is, if this suffering has ""negative value""/is bad, does pleasure/happiness have ""positive value""?

Who gets to decide that though? Personally I would happily choose life over not existing."
nihilism,fdhp8lh,t3_elg514,1578427420.0,"Well, it depends on semantics I guess. If ""free will"" means ""free of any physical rules of the universe"", then it cant exist.  
Personally, I do more or less believe in determinism, but you wont just sit there, stop eating etc. because ""free will doesnt exist"", so you might as well make choices like it exists imo."
nihilism,fdc3kyk,t3_ekk4te,1578266427.0,"Nihilism kinda does make me happy though. If nothing ""matters"", you are free. Free of excessive worry, free of expectations, etc. You are god, you do what you want. Preferably without impairing others ability to do so as well, if you ask me ;D"

nihilism,fd4fk2a,t1_fd49axk,1578167074.0,"To me nihilism is really just denying an inherent, objective meaning/purpose of existence. While I also think that ""true knowledge"" of this world doesnt exist (for example gravity could stop working tomorrow for all we ""know""), 1+1=2 is objectively true because we have defined every symbol in that statement.      

I guess in the same way I could argue that we have created and defined ""the meaning of existence"" to be something that cannot actually exist, thus (my definition of) nihilism is objectively true."

I dont know, Im pretty close to saying nihilism is an objective truth. I mean, what could be the ""purpose"" of existence? Some god made it as a trial for us?
