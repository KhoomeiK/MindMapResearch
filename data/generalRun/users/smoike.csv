DataHoarder,ffbai7u,t1_ff4ccwb,1579757464.0,"I only found out recently that there are two types of tacho outputs.  
 One where the output is ""free floating"" and is a signalled output, but is not tied to a reference voltage of ground or the full voltage input into the fan. The kind of circuit that uses this fan relies on it as a source of information to control other circuits and provides it's own ground/reference voltage for it's controller logic. This is the most common kind of fan & circuit.  
    
 The other kind is the one where the fan has the output tied to ground or (less commonly) the input voltage via a voltage divider and that provides a full referenced pulsed output to the logic circuits. This type of fan is far less common from what I can tell by looking at mouser/rs electronics/element 14. It unfortunately is the kind of fan that I need to use for my NAS drive enclosures.  
  
To get my enclosure to work with some noctua silent fans that only provide the floating voltage I need to modify my fans and use a voltage divider between them. I would put money on this being the issue if a regular 3 pin fan is still triggering the alarm."

DataHoarder,ff8z424,t3_erhcr3,1579700621.0,"I went through something recently with a roll my own NAS that was not nearly quite as fan dense. I watched [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PspNeXFJ0yM) video and immediately went out and bought similar Noctua fans and replaced those in the [enclosures](http://www.chenbro.com/en-global/products/Storage_Expansion_Kit/Hot-Swap_HDD_Enclosure/SK33502) my [enlight](https://www.newegg.com/beige-ark-en-8950/p/N82E16811128045). The only thing is I had to modify the fans by putting a resistor between the negative and the tachometer so that instead of sending a floating tacho value it had a grounded signal that sent a positive pulse when the tacho sent a signal for the rotation. Worth the increase in silence and reduction in power use by 12w.  

If i could go and redo it I would go for a slimmer case and put in 1x 4 or 6tb drives to reduce the points of failure and power use while increasing density. But it works and I cannot justify the cost at this point."

It was a data centre racks from the time that they used positive pressure cooling from under the floor tiles. I just pulled the top cap off (they were using it for low power equipment that didn't really need cooling, so included the top), had a fan tray at the top to pull out hot air in combination with foam sealed side panels and doors. I built my own fan tray from plywood and put 4x thermaltake pure 20 fans (4x 129CFM) in it and replaced the 240v/30w fans in the top with 12v units that pulled similar if not higher airflow than their predecessors and now only consume 28w for all 8 fans.

I assembled the rack using the principle of the chimney effect and the safe assumption that the cooler air in the room would be hanging around the concrete floor. So far it has kept the rack running at a very reasonable temperature, even in 40'C days here in Sydney."

 Because it is summer here in Australia, I have exactly the reverse problem. So I naturally have never installed the lid, and use the top fan module ( though I replaced the 4x 240v 30w/total of 120w AC fans with 4 higher flow & quieter 12v fans that only consume 20w total) and installed a 25w, 12v fan shelf at the bottom to pull air from the bottom and it does the chimney effect through the rack."

He is flat and one dimensional with nearly no change in tone or other qualities to indicate there is anything more to him.

pics,fed51sb,t1_fecygnv,1578999227.0,"Fireplaces are also bad for draught and the cold unless you're right next to them. I believe it's because with so much hot air rising through the chimney, it forces the house into a.negatives pressure, drawing whatever air it can from outside, undoing whatever heating the radiant heat from the fireplace had achieved.  
  
 You need something like a slow combustion fireplace where air is drawn in, part of it is split off to be use in combustion and then sent out the chimney among with the smoke and particles. The rest of it gets circulated around the outside of the combustion box and comes out vents in the top of the fireplace. In these, only a small fraction of the air is expelled out, providing a minimal intake of cold air into the building.  
  
  A neat feature of these slow combustion fireplaces is that they have little slats on the vents into the combustion area that can be linearly closed and restrict the flow of air even further, allowing combustion to be slowed down as much as you need to provide enough heat to be comfortable without making it overly hot.  
  
It's also a similar reason as to why single tube portable (reversible & cooling only) air conditioner units aren't anywhere near as efficient as dual tube ones or in building ones. Air is taken in to be cooled/heated and also perform the work  and then the used air is sent outside, drawing ambient temperature air in that then heats/cools the place up yet again. Dual tube units as well as window and ducted draw outside air in to perform the work and then send it back outside again, leaving the inside air closer to the target temperature without the negatives pressure undoing it all."
