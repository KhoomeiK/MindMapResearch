ryerson,eib4nh9,t1_eia8az0,1552341692.0,"Thanks! That's super helpful. I also love philosophy so it's hard to narrow things down. A debate sounds super intimidating tbh :\ I also hate when philosophy classes have exams/tests, I tend to drop them at the point hah. Who is your prof for that? I took PHL366 and had an awful prof so didn't enjoy it as much "
