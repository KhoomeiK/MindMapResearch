LittlePeopleBigWorld,ffbas5b,t1_ffapmen,1579757785.0,And he’s still been hanging around the farm judging by his stories. The only difference is he now sometimes has Ember in tow. I guess now that Amy has moved off the farm he can’t just dump Ember with her and drive his mule around pretending to be “farming”.
Dogtraining,ffb9vy9,t1_ffb6rix,1579756645.0,"As the person who you are getting the dog from how large the parents are, it will save you money if you only need to buy one crate rather than getting a smaller one and then needing a larger one later on. Ideally you want a crate that is large enough for the dog to stand, lay, and turn around without issue, but not have too much more space than that. The puppy will be very small at first so you don’t want a gigantic crate where they could go to the bathroom on one side and sleep on the other. They make dividers that you can put in the crate and move as they grow. I’ve used pillows to take up the extra space, but you want to make sure the dog is tired enough when in the crate that their puppy energy doesn’t lead them to chewing on/destroying whatever you use as a divider"
Dogtraining,ffb9evt,t1_ffb6wmr,1579756052.0,"I personally try to avoid pee pads. If you have a yard than you can take him out there, you want to avoid strange dogs that you don’t know have all of their vaccines. And don’t let him eat anything outside/keep outdoor time limited (unless you have a private space) until he has Atleast two rounds of shots. I’ve found it’s much easier to house train a dog without using pads. Simply take them out CONSTANTLY. Take them out as soon as they wake up, wether that’s from a nap or from sleeping all night. Take them out after they run around playing. Take them out after they drink water. Take them out after they eat. Take them out before you sit down to eat dinner and after you eat dinner. My most recent dog I probably took out every hour (minus night time when she was asleep in her crate) for the first few weeks, and then every 1.5 -2 hours until she was about 4 months. But she was completely house trained at 4 months and has never hand an accident (unless she was sick) since. I also put a bell on her collar, you can get small bells at the pet store (usually in the cat section) and that helped keep tabs on her while she was in the house when she was really young. Keep them in eyesight at all times, but the bell will alert you if they get out of sight. If you catch them going potty in the house simply pick them up and take them out at that exact second, mid pee if you catch it, and them outside to finish. Clean it up when you get back in, but don’t punish them for it. They’ll quickly learn that they go outside."

I haven’t looked it up and joined this sub relatively recently so I may have missed if there was already a post about it —-but for some reason I get the feeling that she was really young possibly close to being underage. Idk, maybe because her parents are seemingly so young? Robert seems close in age to them which makes me feel like their kid can’t be that old"

Dogtraining,ffazcfc,t1_ffawt63,1579747995.0,These are all really great things to have - but I would not classify them all as core essentials for first bringing the dog home.

TeenMomOGandTeenMom2,ff2l9tk,t1_ff2j801,1579511443.0,"I too had a red-tagged GSD that i rescued from the shelter. He was the best dog I’ve ever had but it didn’t come without it’s struggles. We were required to get a P.O. Box for our mail until he passed away because he was fearful of people in uniform (he was a former police dog that was abused) and broke a window when the mailman came to the house. We spent thousands on trainers and couldn’t have unexpected guests drop by, but those of us that he knew he would protect with his life. 

A fearful dog is much more dangerous than a guard dog. A lot of people think that just because they get a dog as a puppy and have it around their kids that it will be a good dog. That is the farthest thing from the truth. And I hope that Kail gets both of these Kane korso’s serious training but I doubt she judging by how karma is reacting to her friend and her lack of doing anything about it. In a few months when the dogs are larger it could become a very dangerous situation."
TeenMomOGandTeenMom2,ff2hqfg,t1_ff2gsmd,1579506649.0,"I agree. I watched her story and Karma and clearly insecure and unsure of this person. She isn’t being socialized/trained/taught to be confident. Even if she is great with Kail’s kids, that doesn’t mean she’ll be great with any kid that comes over. An insecure dog is the most dangerous, and it won’t be the dogs fault when she reacts to a situation with one of the boys friends, but she’ll be blamed for it."
