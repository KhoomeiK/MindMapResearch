HistoryMemes,ffigo0v,t3_etmdlp,1579973428.0,"I'm actually doing research on Pontius Pilate

He's from the Equestrian class from the region of [Pontus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pontus_(region))

More than likely served in the Legions as an officer, and was either a client of Tiberius, or was a client of one of Tiberius's clients 

Given that Octavian (aka Augustus) preferred Governorships be given to the Equestrians and not the Patrician class was more about preventing insurrections as the Patrician's had the money to raise an army. Thus, seemingly, following Emperors employed the same reasoning as Octavian *(also, it could be the Patrician class was becoming indistinct from Plebes in terms of wealth, but I have some evidence of that, but not enough to hang my hat on)*

A good way of thinking about Pontius Pilate is do not think of him as a biblical character *(he is, but stay with me on this)*

But

think of him as a Roman Military Governor overlooking a logistical highway [via maris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Via_Maris), that is a critical supply route for Legions facing Parthia until Caesarea is finished.

He has a job which is more than likely ensuring there is no rebellions, keeping the populace placated, but not allowing threats to the supply chain, and raising auxiliaries for Roman commander in Syria

Which then would explain his heavy handed approach to punishment against perceived rebels...

still with me?

Here's the issue with Pontius Pilate and Jesus...He's an educated Roman Governor, he's quite familiar with the Greek philosophies of dissecting truth, which is what he thinks Jesus is talking about, and for a military man such discussions are an exercise in intellectualism. Hardly applicable to real politic...thus, two men discussing the subject of truth at two different levels...talking past each other, kind of.

So, to continue...

Given that the [Head Priest job was more than likely bought](http://12tribehistory.com/office-of-high-priest-was-bought/) from Governor, the Jewish priests had two thing going on, a balancing act if you will...

1) Preserve Jewishness in the face of Roman and Greek culture...which was at best...mmm...50/50

2) Keep the Roman's happy because the zealots were REALLY making things difficult, and everyone knows what happens when a region rebels in the Roman Imperium...shit goes down.

So...here's where it gets interesting...Jewish hierarchy have been cagey with Pilate, but when Pilate rubs their collective noses with, ""isn't he your king?""

The ""Jew's"" response is....right...no, [""Caesar is our King!""](https://biblehub.com/john/19-15.htm)

Now just think for a moment about that...because Pontius Pilate knew, right at that moment, he had them, their balls, and their pretty little tongues in a vice...so, he lets them decide Jesus's fate.

A lot is going on the scriptures that isn't fully fleshed out because there is way to much going on to write it down, but Jesus was pretty much a political pawn. For Pilate, letting the Jew's carry the decision to have Jesus executed wasn't a going concern for him...the bottom line is he couldn't be blamed for his death if it all goes tits up.

And...that's pretty much where I'm at with my thesis...lots of notes, but I hope that wasn't to long winded..oh, right, courtesy tl;dr...

TL:DR: Pontius Pilate ""probably"" saw himself as a military governor who had to keep the supply routes open for the Legions to support Rome's armies along the Parthian frontier."
