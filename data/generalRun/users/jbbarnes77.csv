intj,ffjx2j9,t3_eu180v,1580009318.0,"Same here. I am polite to a fault, as that's how I was raised. But I do seem to have the INTJ ""death stare"", and that puts people off. It requires a LOT of effort on my part to overcome it with tonality and (insincere) smiling.

My neutral face is off-putting. When I pull up to the drive-through window or step up to the service counter, I can see the attendant subtly reading my face to gauge me, and they often clam up, assuming I'm upset. Many a time I've watched a customer service agent laugh and joke with the customer in front of me, only to tighten up when it's my turn. Women sometimes subtly step backward when I get onto an elevator.

I'm past complaining about it. It's just how it is when I don't actively remember to compensate for it. When I forget or am in a hurry, I get a tepid, guarded response.

These people have to deal with hundreds of customers a day. Some will be nice, others will belligerent. They are just making their best guess about what they will have to deal with when it's my turn, so I don't fault them for it. Just wish it weren't so much effort to overcome it. But when it happens and I haven't actively contributed to any kind of misunderstanding, then I have to shrug it off. 

My recommendation: see if you can adjust your tonality. Add a bit of lilt or intonation or try to ""sound"" more polite. That takes less energy (for me) and helps quite a bit. If you naturally have both the death stare and a flat tone, then yes, people often misread you. Very frustrating, I agree."

Abode,fe3w5fm,t3_enjaj2,1578853425.0,"Hmmm. I just dealt with a sensor yesterday, so let me at least share my experience with them. 

I think I have 8 or 9, and they have been reliable for over a year without a single false positive. Yesterday I installed a Dome shutoff valve, so I moved the one in the crawlspace out of the way before installation. Perhaps the cable got a little damp, because it did go off. 

I had to reset the alarm in my app and acknowledge the alert. That silenced the alarm. After a while, though, I found that the device was chirping once every minute or so. That reminded me that it does need something plugged into the port. Either the rubber stopper or a cable. I figured its cables might still be damp, but recalled I had a perfectly dry one in a storage bin, and plugging it in quieted it.

Not your situation, but I wanted to at least share what happened to me. Alarm, silenced in app, plugged a cable into the port. That completely closed the situation. So I would suggest plugging the cable back in if it isn't already. And I would also suggest to anyone who has a water alarm go off to always 1) silence the alarm 2) dry the terminals on the bottom, and 3) temporarily unplug the cable if moist. 

Have you tried deleting the device from the Abode interface and then adding it back?  If you do that and it still trips an alarm, then I would worry about it being faulty."
smarthome,fe0y3fd,t3_enl4bx,1578820144.0,"I just installed a Dome water main shutoff valve for under $100, and it works very well. But I paid plenty to install Abode leak detectors all over my house. 

If I were helping a friend set up a system from scratch, I would recommend a SmartThings hub (\~ $65), a SmartThings leak detector (\~ $16)  near each sink/toilet/water heater, and the Dome valve (< $100).

The difference, though, would that it would not respond to water anywhere there wasn't a sensor."
techsupport,fe0qxgy,t1_fdzx1ub,1578817647.0,"SecondCopy uses ""profiles"" for each job you define. So if you regularly copy C:\users\me\Documents to Z:\Backup\documents, that's saved as a profile and run as often as you like. You will probably set up many--some run on demand and some run on schedules. 

I found with SC9 that if I created a profile that referenced a removable drive or a network drive that might at some point get disconnected, I could never modify or delete those profiles once the drive was gone. The program would hang and have to be aborted and restarted. 

I notified the author and he sent me a test version, but it didn't resolve the problem. He suggested I use SC8 for the time being. When I bought 9, it also included a key that would work with 8. I installed it and it has been just fine. I'll check back in at some point and try 9 again. The only real difference is that 9 is compiled 64-bit. Other than that, they seem to be virtually identical.

While I was struggling with SC9, I did test drive anything I could find that was similar. There wasn't much. But I did end up buying another program. However, I caught it making mistakes when trying to merge/update/sync directories on occasion. It would fail to notice that a source file had a different byte count and updated it in the destination. things like that. So I learned I couldn't trust it 100%. 

But I've used SC for over 25 years and they seem to have worked out all their algorithms long ago. I've never caught it in a mistake like I found within one hour using the other one (FreeFileSync). 

Anyway, SC is recommended for its speed and reliability (aside from that one recent issue.) My only complaint is that the feature set hasn't expanded in more than a decade. There's virtually no difference between version 7 ad 9 beyond adding Unicode and going 64-bit. But it does just what I need, and it will give you 30 days with full features, so give it a spin."

The basic core of the issue for was where did I spend the majority of my time. In my head or in my heart? (Thoughts or emotions.) A 5w4 is thought-based, but is still emotionally aware and sensitive enough to have deep, well-understood feelings and share them with a confidant.

Enneagram,fdtq6uf,t3_en2wyi,1578720494.0,"I struggled with these questions for months as well, not knowing whether I was 5w4 or 4w5. It's especially hard because the 4-to-5 divide is the largest in the whole Enneagram. There's a good reason the Enneagram lines diverge between 4 and 5 and don't cross.  

I highly recommend putting wings on the shelf for a bit and study instinctual subtypes. There is a ton of nuance there, and the three subtypes of a given type can be vastly different. For instance, a sexual 4 is the most emotional and indulgent in fourlike traits, while the self-preservation the least. 

Reading Beatrice Chestnut's book on the 27 subtypes answered so much. It narrowed it down for me to a self-preservation four or a sexual five. Then reading about just the instinctual variants (divorced from types) led me to identify most closely with sx/sp.  That favored being a five, and in time I learned it fit perfectly. A five sx is the most fourlike. Many of the five characteristics that you don't identify with might be tied to the self-preservation five.
