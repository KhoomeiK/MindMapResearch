AmItheAsshole,feoajx0,t1_fenqyv8,1579297341.0,"Also, consider inflation and transaction costs. Transaction costs are usually $20, and after inflation (assuming 2.3%) adds $10 to the value. I‚Äôm assuming if OP bought tickets a year in advance, there are probably no other tickets in that section at that price. NTA. OP is essentially making $20 off the ticket if they choose to sell for $450."
AmItheAsshole,feo01de,t3_eq54mh,1579293270.0,"NAH. My parents opted out of this AND sex ed in the 5th grade because they felt I wasn‚Äôt ready. They did their own version that made them feel more comfortable and added the lovingness these people lack. And tbh, I‚Äôd rather have my parents teach me than my teachers.

Edit: I was the only kid in the grade (of 300) who ever got pulled out for this"

TrueOffMyChest,fcvfoyz,t3_eik86h,1578001122.0,"This!! I‚Äôm not vegan but am vegetarian. A vegan once approached me and said, ‚Äúyou obviously care about the wellbeing of animals because you‚Äôre a vegetarian, why aren‚Äôt you vegan?‚Äù 

I had to explain that I believe it‚Äôs okay for animals to be killed for food. After all, that‚Äôs how the world works lol. I was just vegetarian because I don‚Äôt like the taste of meat. She was speechless.

ETA: I don‚Äôt care if people around me eat meat. I love the smell of a nice, juicy steak. Just don‚Äôt care for the taste ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"
AmItheAsshole,fct9yli,t1_fct9sbv,1577936863.0,"YTA. You‚Äôre 15. Your parents have every *legal* right to know what you‚Äôre doing. If you‚Äôre doing something illegal (not saying that you are) and you get caught, your parents are going to have to take the fall.

Edit: applicable if you are American living in America, don‚Äôt know about elsewhere"

depression,fcohqti,t1_fcohlbt,1577832517.0,"Yes, taking 10 minutes a day is a huge luxury that costs tons of money. Look, all I am is a person trying to put some positivity into this world because I know what it feels like to feel like everything is going to hell. I‚Äôm sorry that you can‚Äôt see the good in anything."
depression,fcoh9am,t1_fcoh0ut,1577832184.0,"Maybe the reason you‚Äôre suicidal is because you don‚Äôt give yourself a break. Taking time for yourself is important, and trust me, I understand the cultural things. I hope you find some peace in the new year, because if you don‚Äôt, live is just going to keep getting harder."

depression,fcogfbb,t1_fcodtm6,1577831613.0,"So neither of you can take 10-20 minutes a day to meditate, read, practice deep breathing, or do anything else that brings you some peace of mind? I never said anything about ‚Äúdropping anything.‚Äù We all have busy lives and bills to pay, but taking some time for yourself doesn‚Äôt take 40 hours a week."

AmItheAsshole,fcjgb0v,t3_ehh473,1577686536.0,"I know I‚Äôm going against the grain, but YTA. This issue should have been dealt with during the semester. If you had an issue with the professor not returning grades, you should‚Äôve gone to the department head and had a discussion with them. Every professor I have ever had has said, ‚Äúif you have an issue, address it before final grades are posted.‚Äù Professors grade things based on different metrics. If you had questions about how things would be graded, you also should have discussed that with your professor before turning it in. 

As for the extra credit, it never hurts to do it. Theoretically, if you bombed the final, that extra credit could save you. 

Overall, you got an A-. I know someone who got one A- during her time in college and graduated with a 3.985. It‚Äôs not the end of the world. In a few years, no one will care if you got a 3.985 or a 4.0."
