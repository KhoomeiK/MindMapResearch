interestingasfuck,ffnk4d7,t1_ffn18ga,1580067027.0,"Um.  Youre mostly right.  Mostly.  While i do believe as far as endurance runs go, there is virtually no other animal on earth with more endurance.  I can think of only one.  And that one is so much better than us that there is literally no competition.  So much so that their very body chemistry is different than any other.

Huskies.

There is no animal alive with more endurance than a husky.  They are so specifically engineered for distance that the way their bodies use energy is different from any other mammal.  Id have to do some digging, but theres some articles on the specifics of how their muscles use glucose.  Its unlike anything else and completely unique to that breed.  Their muscles literally dont wear out.  I think theres also an immensley deminished production of lactic acid in their bodies as well.  Thats the chemical produced as muscles become heavily used and causes weakness/pain after workouts.  They just dont feel that.

I know that you are still generally correct, but the fun thing about life is that there is always an exception."

The unfortunate aspect, is that the recent breakout in china is a new mutation never seen before.  Its much more serious, spreading very very quickly, and has an extremely high chance of further mutations."

Once youre far enough into the game, wishing wells are absolutely a waste of space.  And it takes maybe a week to get another world through iron age and set it up for wishing wells.  You can have many worlds."
forgeofempires,ffi999n,t1_ffhw70j,1579968360.0,"Its very little effort to be honest.  You can clear all event quests by the time you reach the end of iron age, and you never need to develop beyond that, really.  Log in every day for a fast collection, then log out."
forgeofempires,ffi924r,t1_ffhphsm,1579968220.0,"So the real magic of wishing wells requires about a year of planning.

The idea is to set up a world able to reliably complete event quests, and go all out on wishing wells for every event of the year.

With only 3 wells, you'll never see the benefit, and they are a waste of space in your primary world.

You set up these extra worlds to be designated as diamond farms, because diamonds are shared across the whole account.

Each well has a 1% chance of giving you 50 diamonds every day.  With 3 of them, its awful.

I currently have a main world and 3 diamond farms.  As of this event, I've got 99 wishing wells.

With that many, youre nearly guarenteed to get at least 50 diamonds per day, however, luck comes and goes.  Some days ill collect over 300, others none."
