You don't, and yet you keep doing it. This discussion of effective charity was never about you but you keep making it so. Because you made this discussion about you, we have learned you seem to care more about how charity makes you appear than outcomes. Perhaps next time stick to the issues instead of how much you personally give and what we should/shouldn't tell you."

That's certainly true if you set up a system so they intentionally fail. There are some very equal societies on this planet where the very wealthy and the very poor don't exist at the extremes they do here. There is much room for improvement in this regard."
Economics,fgz6d56,t1_fgz3mn8,1581191223.0,"I just linked you to an article that makes a comprehensive case to that effect (private and religious charities are not a suitable substitute for public programs.) Here are more:

----------------------------

LA Times: **[Private charity can’t replace government social programs](https://www.latimes.com/business/la-xpm-2014-mar-30-la-fi-hiltzik-20140330-story.html)**

> charitable organizations typically fall prey to the same economic pressures as the rest of society. “Giving falls when it’s needed the most,” observes Christopher Wimer, an expert on poverty and the social safety net at Columbia University.

> In economic terminology, charitable giving is pro-cyclical, not counter-cyclical, unlike programs such as unemployment insurance and food stamps, which expand to meet rising needs.

> ...

> Part of the mythology of the Great Depression is that charitable giving rose during those hard times, but the truth is exactly the opposite. Overall giving fell by more than a fifth from 1929 through 1933, adjusted for inflation, before starting to recover. Among the wealthy, it fell an inflation-adjusted 70% in 1931-35 — about the magnitude of the stock market drop that had devastated wealth in the capital-owning class.

> Another issue is that philanthropic giving is not synonymous — at all — with helping the needy. Quite the contrary.

> As charitable giving is structured in the United States today, it too often plays out not as the rich helping out the poor, but as the rich increasing the gap between themselves and the poor.

> A 2007 study by Indiana University’s Center on Philanthropy found that only 30% of individual giving in the benchmark year of 2005 was aimed at the needs of the poor — including contributions for basic needs, donations to healthcare institutions, for scholarships and allocations from religious groups. (The study was commissioned by Google.)

> The smallest allocation of philanthropic giving to basic needs of the poor was made by the wealthiest donors, those with income of $1 million of more, who directed 3.8% of their giving directly to the poor. For the $100,000-$200,000 income group, that allocation was 12.4%.

> “The existing evidence doesn’t support the idea that wealthy donors will step in” to replace government transfer programs, says Rob Reich, an expert in philanthropy at Stanford. As he wrote last year, “Philanthropy appears to be more about the pursuit of one’s own projects, a mechanism for the expression of one’s values or preferences rather than a mechanism for redistribution or relief for the poor.”

> The largest single recipient of philanthropy is religion — 32% of the total, according to Giving USA. But only a small portion of that goes to outreach to the needy; more than three-quarters of donations to religious organizations is spent on “congregational operations,” including facilities upkeep, the Indiana University study found.

The Atlantic: **[The Conservative Myth of a Social Safety Net Built on Charity](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2014/03/the-conservative-myth-of-a-social-safety-net-built-on-charity/284552/)**

> As research by Robert Reich and Christopher Wimer showed, the decline occurred with all sources and hit almost all types of nonprofits. Individuals gave 8 percent less in 2008 than the previous year, and their giving dropped an additional 3.6 percent in 2009. Charitable bequests fell 21 percent overall between 2008 and 2010. Contributions by corporations fell in 2008, and only slowly increased afterwards. Foundations also gave less in the Great Recession even though they have legal payout and operating rules to follow that would presumably put a floor on this.

> There were some bright spots—giving to food banks, for instance, increased. But as the economy went from free fall in 2008 to stagnation in 2010, private charity still remained depressed. Worse, as a wave of austerity hit state and local governments—with large retrenchment in spending and layoffs of public-sector workers—the state pushed harder on private charity to pick up the slack of social work.

> Why didn’t this sting as badly as it could have? Because of the role the federal government played. “Automatic stabilizers,” a key policy innovation of the welfare state, were there to pick up the slack. Automatic stabilizers are policies such as unemployment insurance and food assistance that maintain an income floor and security for people, which allows for more spending when an economy goes into a recession. This ability to boost purchasing power automatically is a major, effective response to a recession. These stabilizers, in turn, also decline automatically as the economy starts to recover.

> During 2009, while private charity collapsed, automatic stabilizers expanded rapidly, from 0.1 percent of GDP to 2.2 percent of GDP—or a number roughly akin to all charitable giving in the United States. This was directly targeted at areas that suffered from the most unemployment, and helped those most in need—efforts that, as we’ve seen, private charity does only partially. As Goldman Sachs economists concluded, this shift made a crucial difference, and, alongside the government’s efforts to prevent the collapse of the banking sector and the Federal Reserve’s expansion of monetary policy, was a core reason the Great Recession didn’t become a second Great Depression.

> With this in mind, we can examine why voluntary efforts fail consistently. Despite the general under-theorizing of the voluntary sector, the scholar Lester Salamon in the 1980s did build a theory of “voluntary failures” to contrast with market and government failures. There are three parts to the theory that especially stand out in the wake of the Great Recession.

> The first is what Salamon describes as philanthropic insufficiency. This occurs when the voluntary sector can’t generate enough resources to provide social insurance at a sufficient scale, which, as noted, is exactly what happened in 2008. There is also the problem here of geographic coverage. As Hoover discovered, charity will exist in some places more abundantly than in others; the government has the ability to provide a more universal baseline of coverage.

> But it isn’t just about the business cycle. A second issue Salamon identified is philanthropic particularism. Private charity has a tendency to focus only on specific groups, particularly groups that are considered either “deserving” or similar in-groups. Indeed, in one telling, this is the entire point of private charity. The largest single category of charitable giving in the United States goes not to caring for the poor but for the sustenance of religious institutions (at 32 percent of donations). Using very generous assumptions, Indiana University’s Center for Philanthropy finds that only one-third of charitable giving actually goes to the poor. Almost by definition, there will be people who need access to social insurance who will be left out of such targeted giving.

> The third element of voluntary failure relevant here is philanthropic paternalism. Instead of charity representing a purely spontaneous response by civil society, or a community of equals responding to issues in the commons, there is, in practice, a disproportionate amount of power that rests in the hands of those with the greatest resources. This narrow control of charitable resources, in turn, channels aid toward the interests and needs of those who already hold large amounts of power. Prime examples of this voluntary failure can be seen in the amount of charitable giving that goes to political advocacy, or to elite colleges in order to help secure admission for already privileged children, even as the needs of the truly desperate go unmet.

> At a basic level, much of our elite charitable giving is about status signaling, especially in donations to elite cultural and educational institutions. And much of it is also about political mobilization to pursue objectives favorable to rich elites. As the judge Richard Posner once wrote, a charitable foundation “is a completely irresponsible institution, answerable to nobody” that closely resembles a hereditary monarchy. Why would we put our entire society’s ability to manage the deadly risks we face in the hands of such a creature?

That said, not everyone that wants to tax the nuclear family is an ""anti-family Marxist,"" there are many other reasons to do so besides collective ownership. This seems like the old stale bad-faith argument that anyone left of far right parties is a Marxist. I suspect that is why many are reacting to you with skepticism.

You are totally correct in that anti-family Marxism appears to indeed be a thing. It makes sense if one's goal is to do away with heritable wealth and make a true meritocracy when I think about it. It's an interesting rabbit-hole. [This class I found online has a good summary:](https://revisesociology.com/2014/02/10/marxist-perspective-family/)


> Marxists argue that the nuclear family performs ideological functions for Capitalism – the family acts as a unit of consumption and teaches passive acceptance of hierarchy. It is also the institution through which the wealthy pass down their private property to their children, thus reproducing class inequality.

> ...

> However, this conflict of interests rarely boils over into revolution because institutions such as the family perform the function of ‘ideological control’, or convincing the masses that the present unequal system is inevitable, natural and good.

> Something else Marxists suggest about the family (like the Functional Fit theory) is that the family type generally changes with society – more specifically, the nuclear family emerges not because of the needs of industrialisation, but because of the needs of the capitalist system.

> ...

> The modern nuclear family functions to promote values that ensure the reproduction and maintenance of capitalism. The family is described as an ideological apparatus – this means it socialises people to think in a way that justifies inequality and encourages people to accept the capitalist system as fair, natural and unchangeable. One way in which this happens is that there is a hierarchy in most families which teaches children to accept there will always be someone in “authority” who they must obey, which then mirrors the hierarchy of boss-worker in paid employment in later life.

[Engels wrote a whole book on it,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Origin_of_the_Family,_Private_Property_and_the_State) blaming the family for oppression of women on the name of maintaining heritable wealth and therefore economic inequality. 

I guess whether families are a good thing or not depends on one's outcomes. If families provide a better quality of life and more opportunities then I can see why people see them as a rightful building block of society. If families hold one back by coercion and social enforcement and are seen as an icon of inequality of opportunity, I can see why one might think that a more equal and transparent method of raising children would be better. They're kind of like numerous tiny dictatorships, benevolent dictatorships are awesome and the other kind not so much."

> Using a national survey of religious congregations in the U.S., the Duke Divinity School professor Mark Chaves found that 83 percent of congregations have some sort of program to help needy people in their communities. Most often, these efforts provide clothing, food, and temporary shelter, rather than intensive, long-term programs on substance abuse, post-prison rehabilitation, or immigrant resettlement. The median amount congregations spent on social-service programs was $1,500. “Religious congregations do a lot,” said Mary Jo Bane, a professor at Harvard University. But “the scale of what they do is trivial compared to what the government does. Especially if you think about the big government programs like … food stamps and school lunches, or health services through Medicaid, what religious organizations do is teeny tiny.”"

> “The vast majority of religious congregation budget [money] is spent on in-house expenses: clergy, building, materials,” said Christian Smith, a sociology professor at the University of Notre Dame. “Some congregations have more outreach ministry and social services than others. But in almost all cases, it ends up being a small part of the budget, just because it costs so much to run a congregation.”

Systemic problems need systemic solutions, preferably ones that don't embroil religious coercion with charity. As religion declines in public life we should support public secular ways of helping these people. This public assistance we already provide, although inadequate, dwarfs the contributions of individual churches. Ignoring this to point out that religious people are more generous seems to miss the point entirely and pushes a false reality where religion is the primary helper of the poor and not government."

[This comic illustrates the difference.](http://www.stanleycolors.com/2013/12/atheism-vs-theism-vs-agnosticism-vs-gnosticism-a-simple-guide-to-know-what-the-hell-you-are/) Agnostic atheists are also an example of a type of Atheist who doesn't have to rely on faith or prove a negative (I have stated before, I personally believe this cannot be done.)"

His restaurants and apartments look like the sun king threw up all over the place. Mandating these unnecessary tacked on design elements for modern buildings like skyscrapers is wasteful, useless, and it reminds me of the sensibilities of Peter Keating from the Fountainhead.

There are places and times for other architecture. Brutalism and modernism work well for many government buildings, and although it looks nice in planned cities like DC, I'm not sure I want our government to think of itself as Roman Imperial."

MurderedByWords,fglkjtp,t1_fgkp1ul,1580902214.0,"* Not every belief system is based on faith, many are based on evidence. 

* Atheism is not a faith or religion, it is the absence of one. It is the default state of all humans when born before they are indoctrinated.

* While believing illogical things doesn't necessarily make one a bad person, it doesn't help. Thought precipitates action and illogical thought precipitates illogical action. As per Weinberg's quote, good people will naturally do good things and bad people will naturally do bad things, but if you want to get a good person to do bad deeds you need religion. It's a go-to motivator to get people to do things they wouldn't do otherwise for illogical reasons.

I think we share a lot of common ground but you seem to be a religious apologist for some reason. Is it because there are religious people you care about? I've religious people I care about too and I can't help but wonder how much better they'd be off without this intellectual anchor around their necks holding them down."
