This is what people fail to realize.   
All objects be they apples or oranges or tables or even the earth itself are rendered on the SURFACE of the claustrum.   And no object rendered on the surface of something can be 3 Dimensional.   The 3D aspect of reality is an illusion. 

It's kind of like if you were playing a video game on your LCD monitor.   The game LOOKS like its 3dimensional sure.  But its actually flat because its rendered on your monitor. 
When u move your character forward and back you're given the ILLUSION of 3 dimensionality.

Make sense?"

Maybe instead of fighting the cancer And the right on two fronts, we could Use the the cancer like a shield or like fodder against the right.   Kinda like a large, dispensable mutant army.   That way If miss ""83 genders"" and captain ""everything's racist"" get killed but take a few nazis out in the process, we all win."
todayilearned,ffhjsp8,t1_ffhhm5g,1579938494.0,"No.  I'm the type of guy who would enjoy killing the people who are making it happen. The right doesn't get powerful by itself.   They need leftwing assclowns to make it happen. 
Make the left weaker and weaker and weaker and weaker.   Celebrate weakness. Make it a badge of pride.
And that's how Nazis resurface.
But KILL the people who make Nazis resurface.. and no Nazis resurface."
todayilearned,ffhja6p,t1_ffhi0a3,1579937796.0,"How do you make the right smarter and stronger?  You can't.  Because the right isn't smart or strong.  So how do you do it?  By making the left dumber and weaker.  
That's how.

Downvote me to your heart's content.  Block me if you want to.  But I'll give one thing straight.   You can't defeat evil by squeezing your nipples and calling them racist. 

Do you really think that the people who killed six million jews are gonna go easy on you because applause gives you PTSD?

Do you think those Trump supporters are gonna give you a pass because you weigh 40lbs and wear a vagina hat?

Do you think they're gonna be nice to you if you decide to completely disarm yourself and run at them with whistles and rainbow flags? 

Do you honestly feel that ANY of these people care if you call them racist?  Or homophobic?  Or mysoginist?  Or if you fall to your knees and scream ""Nnnooooooo!!"".  

You know what  keep at it.  Go into convulsions and epileptic seizures whenever you hear a word that makes you uncomfortable.   Suppress free speech and open debate. Make the right look like heroes and the left look like weakling clowns.  And we'll see what happens."

space,ffbip4h,t1_ffbhkmc,1579767130.0,"If you want to learn a bit more about how entanglement works,  imagine a group of 2D people existing on a sheet of paper.  

One group of people are on the top side of the sheet.  The other group of people are on the bottom side.  These people have no concept of 3D.

One day a spinning sphere appears between the sheet.  The people at the top see a circle spinning clockwise.     The people at the bottom see another circle spinning counterclockwise. 

But the truth is that these aren't two separate circles at all.  It's a sphere.   Problem is, because they're 2D beings they can't comprehend the concept of a sphere.

Now imagine a fish tank with a goldfish inside.  There's a camera recording the front of the tank linked to a monitor in room A.   There's a camera recording the side of the tank in room B.
  
The scientists in room A see a front end of a fish.   The scientists in room B see a side end of a fish.   Although these images look different.  They're actually the same fish.

Entangled particles are a lot like that.  Because we're 3D beings we see two different particles. 
But the truth is that the particles in the earth telegraph machine and the particles in the mars telegraph machine are the same particles.  

So you make one spin clockwise and the ""other particle"" spins counterclockwise instantly."

What you see in the night sky isn't what is.  It's more like a video archive.   If you're looking at a star 500 light years from you,  Everything you're seeing happened 500 years ago.

Now let's say that you had a friend on mars with a telegraph machine linked to one set of entangled particles.   Everytime he clicked the machine a particle would be observed.  When he unclicked the telegraph a particle would not be observed.

You would also have a telegraph machine on your side with the formerly paired set of those particles.

When your friend sees Betelgeuse go nova he could telegraph the message to you from mars.
Your telegraph machine would then observe the spin of your particles and display an image of Betelgeuse going nova.   And at the same time, you'll look into the night sky and see it just there."
