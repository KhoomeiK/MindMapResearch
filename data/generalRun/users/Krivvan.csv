ffxiv,ffb283v,t1_ffazb2n,1579749948.0,Yeah I should've added that there is some wonkiness at low level content such as gun breakers easily outdamaging dps classes. Skill overtakes class balance for a window in casual content that begins I think somewhere around level 60 content or so.

The variance among players (and gear) is generally far greater than the variance between the personal dps of different classes.

I enjoy PvP but you'll find that it's considered a niche minigame in this community compared to PvE.

>All i know she said about Minsky is that Epstein directed her to have sex with Minsky. That does not say whether Minsky knew that she was coerced. it does not report what each said and did during their sexual encounter. We can imagine various scenarios. We know that Giuffre was being coerced into sex -- by Epstein

>We can imagine many scenarios, but the most plausible scenario is that she presented herself to Minsky as entirely willing. Assuming she was being coerced by Epstein, he would have had every reason to tell her to conceal that from most of his associates.

He argued that she may have looked as if entirely willing to Minsky, not that she actually was. I'm not defending Stallman as a whole, it ignores the victim testimony and he has defended the possibility of legalizing pedophilia in the past before later recanting those views, but I think many of the headlines about him ""defending Epstein"" and claiming the victims were entirely willing were extremely misleading since they were based on that post."
