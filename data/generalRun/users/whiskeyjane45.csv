How I got my stocked pantry in the beginning was by buying one extra or a bigger version when I bought something, if it was something I knew I would use a lot. I make my grocery list on Sundays by planning out my meals for the week, then adding things we don't have to the list that I will need to make the different dishes. If you do it this way, you will have things you're actually going to use and not a bunch of stuff that other people cook with"
BDSMcommunity,ffp6ckr,t1_ffoz4qa,1580087354.0,"Lol, sorry I didn't make this clear. Those were just some starter questions to get you thinking about what your discussion should be about.

If she just up and decided to have him move in without a discussion from you, it's kind of a big deal. (I'm not sure that is the case, it just sounds like it from what you have written). I am in a 24/7 relationship so I get it, but big changes have consequences for everyone involved so there needs to be a discussion about it outside of the dynamic if things are going to progress smoothly.

I say this because you want to get all the kinks worked out before the big change happens. You may be used to her making all the decisions and just going along with it, but you don't want to get 2 months into it and realize there are some things you aren't comfortable with, and it's already something that is happening. If you talk about it and get those boundaries set up before things get into a rhythm, it will go much smoother for everyone."
BDSMcommunity,ffoxu9a,t3_eueu8t,1580083152.0,"You should definitely be clarifying this with her. You need to have a long conversation about what you expect, what she expects, and what he expects. What exactly will your role be? Will you be expected to play with them? Most importantly, is this something you really want? 

Once you have that discussion and things are starting to be set in motion, you should probably all three sit down and discuss your boundaries. (I say this as someone whose daddy has another sub). It can be easy to step on toes if you don't live together, even easier when you're all in the same house."
HaircareScience,ffn5zp3,t3_eu2sw7,1580062391.0,"Color oops says it's for permanent color but I've used it on deposit only colors for the last 6 years.

Something else you could do is deposit a darker color on top of it to tone it down. You'll really need to know color theory to make that work so I would recommend a professional for that"
NoStupidQuestions,ffmtyoj,t1_ffmilku,1580058864.0,But the question specifically asked how it is in the US. Comparing does not answer the question asked

mildlyinfuriating,ffjyf3c,t1_ffjuwr9,1580010390.0,"Not all of them. There are various levels of difficulty. You can buy puzzles where all the pieces are cut the same, or you can even get puzzles that are all one color to make it more difficult"

Well I've lost all but 2 or 3 accidental wins ever since you told me that. It's been what, a year since then?

I'm still getting matched with 100 million players"

I'm in a 24/7 TPE and that would never happen with us. Basic needs don't even come into the equation."
HaircareScience,ffh07hq,t1_ffgzcqm,1579919609.0,"This has been going on through 3 different homes and several whole house cleanings. After an illness (and we've had many in the past ten years), I always bleach all the bed clothes, bleach every often touched surface (light switches, door knobs, etc), every three months I shampoo the carpets, I have a schedule for deep cleaning each part of the house, a little bit at a time so that by the end of the year, the whole house has been done.

My daughter had an anyphylactic episode and has been tested for allergies (had none, turned out to be because of a virus on top of a bacterial infection made her immune system go crazy). I wash all of our clothes in fragrance and dye free detergent and neither my husband or I wear cologne /perfume. 

As for dietary changes, I have fibro and have tried cutting all of those out of my diet at some point. It neither helped the fibro, or the seb derm. All of us were on a probiotic for a good while after my second daughter was born and we all caught a very, very nasty stomach virus that completely wiped out our gut flora and made it difficult to digest some foods. 

I have a prescription for a medicated shampoo but I've found an otc that works better. It doesn't get rid of it, just makes it manageable.

Thank you for the suggestions though"
NoStupidQuestions,ffgzgu2,t3_etjecq,1579919053.0,"My husband likes anime. Not all of them, but there is several he likes. He's one of the most social people I know. (I'm about to show my age here) When we had a phone plan with limited minutes, out of 900 minutes, I would use 200 and he would use the rest. He's pretty normal. He used to get phone numbers all the time. Still does, from time to time so other people besides me thinks he's cool."
halloween,ffgqtxx,t1_ffgp37e,1579912722.0,"So all the recommendations were for one place in town that hasn't answered my fb post on their page or their phone, but there was another recommendation for a place called Lalobe. It's a drive but it looks like it'll be worth it. It says on their page that they specialize in babies and young kids. I think we'll have to take a trip up there with her besty and find some place cool for lunch"

HaircareScience,ffg6uh7,t1_ffg6994,1579899717.0,Thanks for the change in perspective. I was sad that she'll have to deal with this for so long.

I was just walking around and around in a big circle so idk"
