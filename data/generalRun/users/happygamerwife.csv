IBO,feyc2h6,t3_eqtj2a,1579443550.0,Dm me Tuesday. They are on school computer (I teach hoa)
IBO,fekeuzw,t3_dvvl3m,1579198578.0,has anyone seen the actual list of questions anywhere? Looking specifically for the cold war questions - I can guess that one was causes of crises somehow?
Unexpected,fed9o4k,t3_eo9vb7,1579004862.0,You're an animal.
fatlogic,feb8cvj,t1_fe9u34c,1578956336.0,Undressed...with their 240 calorie packet of dressing though...
loseit,fe1utqg,t1_fdykh27,1578831124.0,Walk or no phone. Simple.
fatlogic,fdjrf08,t1_fdiy2lu,1578484671.0,I visualize the time on the elliptical that a food will take me to burn off and look at the food really hard before I decide to go for it. A mass production garbage cookie gets a pass. Homemade cinnamon rolls on a snowy morning you can bet your ass I'm on that elliptical.
loseit,fdir7vg,t1_fdiq3ky,1578449233.0,"That's not what the article linked first says at all. It says basically that there are factors that will drop your CO rate. It does not say you will store fat in a deficit. Your body building ""science"" article was enlightening though, I was able to glean the madness that drives you. Roid on muscle bro. I'm done here. Your enraged spelling in that last post did give me a giggle or two though."
todayilearned,fdiotcu,t1_fdi6pwy,1578447689.0,"I probably missed the discussion of a subsidy being involved as that changes things on the economic level certainly. However, to intimate that employers would hire a significantly disabled person over a non disabled person is a nice fantasy, but barring laws requiring it or subsidies making it an economic wash at least, it's not happening. I am speaking of the profoundly disabled for whom a normal life is impossible to achieve. They can attain a small measure of independence and useful occupation only with significant support."
loseit,fdio81j,t1_fdi6z3n,1578447311.0,"So you are to dense to realize you've been dismissed entirely as a lunatic one note symphony leader with no orchestra. Noted. You taught me nothing I did not know and added nothing useful to the calculation. Simply repeating over and over that some things hormonal, spiritual, extraterrestrial or whatever impacts your personal CO does not invalidate the laws of physics my simpleminded friend. You cannot create fat out of non existent calories.  Now just stop the broken record, you're beginning to look nuts."
todayilearned,fdi527i,t1_fdhzq7o,1578435864.0,In the real world though those people would not be hired at any wage and thus would be home alone or preventing some other family members from gainful employment. This gets the disabled a sense of self worth and purpose which allevis depression and other negative feelings of self worth. It is a net positive clearly for all concerned except the business who is assuming the responsibility of a disabled person for a portion of the day AND paying for that privilege.
loseit,fdi2mkf,t1_fdgm1wv,1578434631.0,This is clearly the hill you have chosen to die upon. Godspeed.
loseit,fdfffa0,t1_fdf71e1,1578360434.0,"Obviously the body needs fat just as it needs carbs for proper brain function, none of this is relevant in any way to the simple calculation that helps one avoid excess fat. Talk all the circles you want, you will not win in the end. Your body will accumulate excess fat if you exceed it's caloric need no matter what macro division you choose to feed it."
loseit,fdf5be1,t1_fdf4gcl,1578353651.0,"You do not need EXCESS fat in any way shape or form. This is the fat we are discussing. You go on and believe that there is some magic going on here that is more than burn more than you take in. You clearly have a different opinion than science, so go on you way with that."
loseit,fdf2jou,t1_fdevi2i,1578351846.0,"You whole argument about hormones influencing fat storage is irrelevant to the point. Yes it will make your burn number lower but it has no impact on the overall equation of in must be lower than out to lose, period."
hockey,fcxd94b,t1_fcwwxok,1578059804.0,He slid half the length of the ice almost too!
Wellthatsucks,fcx7flb,t1_fcww3dz,1578054283.0,"Yep twenty year old glass stove and fifty year old cast iron pans going strong over here. You have to be more careful of course, but it's not a given.

Cast iron is easy to care for actually. Water and a stiff brush to clean, even soap if you're in a hurry. Dry completely and wipe down with a paper towel with a tablespoon of oil on it and put it on the still warm cook top or oven. My flat tops see daily use at our house and the skillet makes the best deep dish pizza you can imagine."
todayilearned,fcop9hp,t3_ehvc26,1577837955.0,"They also created murals in many post offices and federal buildings that were emblematic of the locality. An amazing project and sparked my most favorite debate in my IB History class last year. The kids argued passionately with me and one another about the value of art in a society, even one suffering an unspeakable Depression. One of the best single days I have had teaching."
loseit,fbz9sp7,t1_fbz9ojb,1577239595.0,No but you do have to be very mindful of where your actual TDEE is and be under it every day. Loseit is a great app but it relies on averages. You may be slightly off that average..
