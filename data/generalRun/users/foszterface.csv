But your kind words convince me, so long as it's a gramma story for gramma story trade.

I never got details about the journey on this but before she married my grandfather, he was in the Navy serving in the Pacific during WWII. He wrote her to tell her he had shore leave coming up, and so when the time came, she hitchhiked from Memphis, TN to San Diego. They met up and spent his time there together, and I believe her trip back was less eventful, though the bus ride back he paid for must have been a lengthy one. 

The grandma I knew on my father's side (his biological mother died when I was very young) always gave the best gifts. Among them is the plush bear she bought us when my daughter was born. My daughter still keeps it close to this day, and when her brother was born, used her saved up money to buy him his own.
