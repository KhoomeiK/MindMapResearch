I had several tough relationships and decided I needed to work on myself before I could find someone worth it. I finally accepted I might be single forever and I was ok with it, then she moved in after escaping an abusive ex and we fell in love with each other"

He also had several weapons he intended to use to fight off and kill police, but they all malfunctioned.

I’m going to try and keep that with me on my sober journey, I’ve not heard it before (or perhaps I have and it’s been erased by the drinking), but it’s a powerful message I hope to not soon forget.

stopdrinking,ff2m8mf,t3_eraurl,1579512903.0,"I appreciate your story man, and congratulations on a year. I’m thankful I never had to come near death for me to realize I need to quit. It’s been about two years that I’ve been trying to get sober, and I’m just over three weeks again. This time felt different though, and now I’m on medication for my anxiety and I’m going back to therapy and I’m actually happy. The world is getting brighter, and I feel I have a future I can look forward. Keep on brother, IWNDWYT"
stopdrinking,fes6k45,t3_eqh0cb,1579361924.0,"I’m not a woman, and I’m not a parent (nor do I plan to be), but this still spoke volumes to me. In the past, I’ve tried quitting but it was always for someone else. Even just to prove to something to someone I didn’t even talk to anymore, in a vain and unfruitful attempt to prove I was worth it. This time, no one pressured me, I realize myself the damage I was doing. I realized there is no “moderation” for me. I realized if I continued drinking I’d lose everything in my life, and my life. I wasn’t happy, I was approaching diabetic, I was wasting money, and one day it all clicked. I haven’t had a drink since, and every day it gets easier."

When I don’t drink, especially starting off, I get really angry and moody and short tempered, and frequently end up fighting with my wife over nothing. I used to just go back to drinking because it was easier to be drunk , but I’ve asked for patience and help being slower to anger, and now instead of drinking I actually talk with my wife. Our relationship has been much better, we’re communicating and I feel loved and heard. We’re more active again, always staying busy. Getting sober again was the best decision I’ve made for myself, and success stories like this one help me push through the humps. IWNDWYT"
