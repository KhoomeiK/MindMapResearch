dogs,ff9voqz,t3_esd28e,1579722523.0,Look on YouTube for howling dog videos. There are some specifically meant to trigger your dog. It worked for mine.

aww,ff32xro,t1_ff2eoe3,1579532303.0,That’s a hearty serving. It was three years ago that I was there so your memory is a little more fresh (like...uhm...that turd).

DivorcedBirds,feyr2x5,t3_eqmrlj,1579449560.0,"The problem was Caesar moved to Portland to be with that pig, but still dressed for the bars of West Hollywood. Why does he have to be so extra, another patron wondered aloud, between sips of his hippy craft brew. Who wears Versace in Portland?"

Midsommar,fenvb54,t3_eq3431,1579291424.0,Seems it’s a hallucination as the diaphragm is necessary to breathe (the lungs aren’t muscles in and of themselves). It was the first thing I googled after I saw the movie. Either way that scene was...vivid.

dogs,feidrmd,t3_ep5jpm,1579136146.0,"I said goodbye to my little guy in the fall after a slow, then rapid decline. The one thing I can say is on top of just being in the room, holding him while he went was the most comforting thing for both of us. And I just kept saying “I love you so much” over and over again. You’re doing the right thing. Set up a little shrine with a photo and some flowers to remember the good times. And don’t be afraid to ask somebody to look after you after. My boyfriend took me for a walk and a drink and just let me be, without leaving my own side."
