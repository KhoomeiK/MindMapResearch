Breadit,fgn1ysy,t1_fgme08w,1580936145.0,"How do you fold your bread in a square container like that? Like I get the straight sides is great to see it's raise, but do you then fold within that container? Or do you raise in that container, then place in a bowl and fold a few staggered times?

Just trying to wrap my head around it..."
Breadit,fgmq2g0,t1_fgmmqb7,1580929742.0,"It's dry active yeast. Not sourdough.

I did the autolyse step but I accidentally threw the activated yeast water in, rather than using a majority of water then activate yeast with the remaining bit of water to add after the autolyse. Forgot yeast wasn't meant to be in that step..."
Breadit,fgmq183,t1_fgmonz2,1580929722.0,"I just wish they had a little more spring in them :(

They always seem to turn out kinda like that... Not very high."
Breadit,fgmmdds,t1_fgmm0ia,1580927530.0,"Too sticky in general? Maybe I'll try lowering the hydration. Definitely going to half the dry yeast, it was pushing out bubbles the next day."

Breadit,fgmiwer,t1_fgmi2sn,1580925482.0,I was very light on the dusting in comparison to that photo. Good to note thanks. Rice flour as well? Seems to be recommended on most blogs/posts..
Breadit,fgmgv43,t1_fgmgav7,1580924288.0,Doing it as we speak. So many steps to everything haha. So easy tomiss something like this...
Breadit,fgmf6gk,t1_fgmeb3h,1580923300.0,"Ive only used it once, so yeah it's nrw. Thanks I'll definitely try that."
Breadit,fgmdkpf,t1_fgmcql1,1580922493.0,Yes it stuck to the banneton is the point. Sorry if that wasn't clear.
Breadit,fgmcecn,t3_ezcimd,1580921894.0,"Completely stuck to banneton

Used rice flour. Overnight proofed so I could wake and bake before work. Took it out and let it sit for 20min but all these bubbles started to push up. Flipped into parchment and it just got destroyed....

Dry active yeast, 345g water, 430g flour (200 bread, 200 white, 30 rye). So 8p% hydration...

Autolyse 1hrs. Ferment 2hrs. Proofed in banneton, fridge overnight.

Edit: [it's finished cooking, not the worst turn out for a fucketty top](http://imgur.com/gallery/gcyyM8d) could have been so much more though...."
Breadit,fgl34rw,t1_fgl1za1,1580880530.0,Appreciate it!
Breadit,fgl0vka,t3_ez40t4,1580878612.0,"Whups and 345g water

Just trying something and wondering whether to split or not for the banneton fridge overnight stage. Thanks"
funny,fgj8ok7,t1_fgiogb9,1580839165.0,"I remember my brother and his wife had a week holiday planned to Cairnes, flying out of Sydney. They get to the airport and look up the flight and turned out they had booked on an international flight that goes via Cairnes. Well they were about an hour late because domestic only require a half hour prior check-in, whereas international is like 2hrs, also the airports aren't quick to get between.. Completely ate into their holiday organising another flight etc."
explainlikeimfive,fgj2b2n,t1_fgieg6n,1580835632.0,Probably jus our house then. We always used powdered stuff for milk. Cadbury or Milo etc
explainlikeimfive,fgj26rh,t1_fgieo8s,1580835570.0,Usually they're all powdered stuff
audiobooks,fgi6hsy,t3_eyj2jf,1580808058.0,"Steven Pacey. I was super impressed with Michael Kramer and Kate Reading with WOT being my first ever audiobook. So impressed I went on to Mistborn, also Michael Kramer. But then Steven Pacey blew that away. I have about 10 hours left of Abercrombie and Pacey and I'm getting super sad that I won't know what to do afterwards.... Such good writing, such good reading...."

Also it gets that weird filmyness. I dunno, I had some texture issues when I was a kid... Love syrups on icecream."
explainlikeimfive,fgi3qt2,t1_fgi3iht,1580804111.0,"Yeah super chalky! That's why I didn't like it. Cadbury made these really fantastic ones in Australia. I remember there was this really special exp one that was basically a packet of what looked like broken up flake. Made the best hot choc ever. Milo is still my favourite. You guys got ripped off with your Milo supply, it's not chunky in NA."
