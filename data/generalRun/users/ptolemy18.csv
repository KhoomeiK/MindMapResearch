My recovery was roooooough. I was a zombie for a solid month after my surgery. I ate, slept, and went to the doctor, and that's about it. I've been hospitalized twice since then for infections (I just got out this past Friday). The med regimen sucks because of the side effects. I'm not going to sugarcoat having a transplant like it's all sunshine and roses and puppies and ice cream. 

But being on dialysis for five years was soul-sucking and it was slowly killing me. Every other day was totally wasted by waiting for transportation, spending six hours at the clinic, feeling like total garbage after dialysis, constantly dealing with labs and medications and infections and paperwork and god knows what else, and above all, having to do all that \*just to still be sick*.

Best of luck to your mom and your family. I was on dialysis for five years and had a kidney transplant this past October, and I know the struggle of having to restrict your diet! If she does end up on dialysis, her clinic will have a dietitian on staff monitoring her labs every month, and he or she will be super helpful with tips, tricks, and suggestions for specifically how your mom can stay on track with her diet while still eating good food!

(Also bear in mind that she really only has to restrict her potassium far enough to keep her blood test between 3.5-5.5. There's a lot more leeway there than you might think, especially depending on her body and how much residual function there is. Don't go out and eat a bunch of bananas or baked potatoes until you know what her body will tolerate while staying healthy, but this also doesn't mean eating like a bird forever, either! I was drinking Diet Coke every day the entire time I was on dialysis and my potassium was always fine.)

Also, tell her to EAT HER PROTEIN. Frankly, potassium is the easy part. Maintaining healthy albumin and hemoglobin levels to not be anemic (and therefore sluggish and tired all the time) is the hard part!"

1. After the surgery, my pain wasn’t from the incision. It was from all the “stuff” they moved out of the way to create space in my guts to put an entire extra organ. So in that sense, yes I did “feel” it.

2. I also can feel it under my skin by touching it. There’s definitely a fleshy mass there. (FWIW I also just had a 300ml fluid collection drained from my kidney area this week, and you’d better believe I felt that.)"
