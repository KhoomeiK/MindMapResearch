depression,ffgh80y,t3_etcurs,1579906169.0,Well spoken bro.
SuicideWatch,ffbkrew,t1_ffaju6q,1579770044.0,What could we do to help life be better for you then?
SuicideWatch,ffajjgh,t1_ffaf9nj,1579737306.0,"Not all cis people are good. Far from it. There are some good and some bad, as with everything. But also, there are some that do care, and grouping them all into one isn't going to help you. You're blaming a random person that you don't know for things that very well may not be their fault. I'm sorry for what you're going through, I honestly am, but there's nothing I can do to directly improve things for you, and if you want support, telling the vast majority of this community that you hate them isn't the way."
UniUK,ff8lmjn,t1_ff8k755,1579684541.0,"Probably Bath, Lancaster, Southampton and Liverpool in that order but that's a bit less set in stone. And none of them are bad unis, don't get me wrong, so if there's a particular reason you want to go to any of them then don't let me put you off."
UniUK,ff8js2t,t3_es7g7v,1579681784.0,"Of those, I'd definitely go for either Warwick or Manchester as they're considerably better than the others. Both are very reputable and you're going to set yourself up well whichever of them you go to. From there, I'd just look at other things, such as how well the content lines up with your interests from your undergrad degree, and less course related things such as the local area."
SuicideWatch,ff8jjb4,t1_ff5yahe,1579681440.0,"I'm incredibly sorry for what you've been through. Having HRT be unsuccessful must be horrible because it leaves you knowing that you're going to look like the gender that you aren't, and there's very little that can be done about it.

However, having this attitude talking to us ""cis people"" isn't going to help you get anywhere either. You can talk about ""our history"" but frankly that wasn't me, nor anyone that you've replied to, and talking in that way isn't going to make your life easier because it doesn't make ""us"" want to help you (quotation marks because you seem so insistent on seperating the population into groups depending on whether we're cis or not).

Nonetheless, I do feel bad for you for the situation you're in. I seriously hope you can find some way to feel more comfortable with the body you're in, and that things work themselves out in the end. Nobody deserves to be forced to be someone they're not and I can't imagine the pain it must cause. 

Best regards."
6thForm,ff8ix5x,t3_es1qrm,1579680582.0,"So imagine you're rolling a die. Let A be the statement ""I rolled a 6"", and let B be the statement ""I rolled an even number"". Then clearly A => B, as if you roll a 6, you must have rolled an even number. However, it is not the case that B => A, as if you roll an even number, it isn't necessarily a 6 (It could be 2, 4 or 6)."

UniUK,ff2r13t,t1_ff2lzjm,1579520198.0,It's different for every uni so what you say may well not be the case.
6thForm,ff1o71s,t3_eqzjv8,1579482479.0,"For maths, sure, but not other subjects. Besides, for me at least, the biggest benefit of writing notes isn't being able to read them again later on. It's actually writing them in the first place. When you're writing them you're taking in what you need to know in order to be able to write them down."
