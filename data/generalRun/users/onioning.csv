The ones I'm used to are pretty much just hollow. But they collapse, so it still has the effect of layers.

Just 'cause it illustrates my first point, I'll answer what I thought you were asking. I first assumed you meant the French beignet. That's basically French tempora. A wide range of vegetables are used, and often the coating is thin to the point that the entire vegetable isn't covered (especially tricky vegetables like tomatoes or bell peppers).

So way back in the day, at my very first real restaurant job, I worked at a French bistro. We did beignet, and when chef showed me the pickup, and the results were all splotchy, she said ""it's supposed to be like that."" Since then I've learned that it very often is like that, but I disagree about ""supposed to."" A French beignet batter should be as thin as possible while still coating the entire thing fried, and your fried things need to be cut or prepped so as to make this feasible. IMO and all. Just answering a question you didn't actually ask. French beignet are pretty fantastic too though. 7/7."

AskReddit,ffuvtko,t1_ffu0345,1580250296.0,"Time of year born definitely matters, for a lot of reasons.

My favorite is especially relevant. There's this dude, Levy-Strauss, who got all tied up in astrology. Basically wanted to prove it existed. So he did a number of experiments with the data. He posited that someone with Mars ascending at the time of birth would be more likely to be a succesful athlete.

And lo and behold, he found statistically meaningful results, with the identified group being significantly more likely to be a successful athlete.

What was actually going on is that Mars ascending happened to line up with common date cutoffs for athletics in school. I may mess up my details here, so bear with me, because the details don't actually matter. All school athletics group people by age. They all must therefore necessarily have a cutoff for determining what group an individual falls in. Those whose birthdates are just before the cutoff have a disadvantage, as they are younger than their competitors. In general, the younger child will be less succesful, meaning they get less attention from coaches, and ultimately, are less likely to develop their skills. They may have the talent, but it isn't encouraged because they're behind the curve relative to their peers. Conversely, the child with a birthdate right after the cutoff receives an advantage, as they are older than their competitors. The result is there is a very real bias in professional sports to players with birthdates in a certain range, and a very real bias against another group of people. Levy-Strauss's marker just happened to line up with something real.

Didn't help though that the other studies he did were ripe with errors and unreasonable jumps. Then to make matters worse, folks did those same studies again, except this time their goal was to disprove astrology, and since they couldn't just stick to facts, they too falsified data.

The issue the EU has is the bath aspect. Doesn't really matter what chemical is being used, and it's hard to imagine a chemical sanitizer less objectionable than bleach."

Why don't we make shortstops pitch? It's part of the game, right? Why do we set up the rules so that position players don't have to pitch? The answer is super duper obvious. It wouldn't be fun to watch."

Actual clubhouse problems are actual problems though. I guess it's kind of shitty to root for someone's failure, but I'd happily root for him if he suddenly became good again too.
