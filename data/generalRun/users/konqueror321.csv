investing,ffgu2jn,t3_et8eg6,1579915074.0,"SPHD was apparently formed in 2012, not anywhere long enough to see how it specifically will fare during a future market crash. Other 'dividend' funds have lost about the same percentage of value as the S&P500 or more, and the dividends paid out also decreased. Consider the fate of Fidelity Dividend Growth Fund (FDGFX), which has been around for 25 years. It is a 'large value' fund with 4\* Morningstar rating. During the 2008 market crash, the value of the fund decreased by 66.8% (from 35.85 on 7/9/07 to 11.90 on 3/2/09), while the dividends paid by this dividend fund decreased by 87% (from $1.27 per share in the year before 7/9/07 to $0.165 in the year after 3/2/2009). All data from Yahoo Finance. 

Given the short lifetime of the fund you noted, and the lack of any data as to how that specific fund did in past market crashes, I would say your plan rates a ""fail"" or at least a ""needs further study""!  Your error may be in assuming that companies who have had a crash in their market value during a market crash will be able to continue paying out the same dividend. Some companies may be able to do so, others not. Do your research!"

>APD (Antisocial Personality Disorder) is a DSM-5 (Diagnostic and  Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fifth edition), diagnosis  assigned to individuals who habitually and pervasively disregard or  violate the rights and considerations of others without remorse. People  with Antisocial Personality Disorder may be habitual criminals, or  engage in behavior which would be grounds for criminal arrest and  prosecution, or they may engage in behaviors which skirt the edges of  the law, or manipulate and hurt others in non-criminal ways which are  widely regarded as unethical, immoral, irresponsible, or in violation of  social norms and expectations. Those with APD often possess an impaired  moral conscience and make decisions driven purely by their own desires  without considering the needs or negative effects of their actions on  others.  Impulsive and criminal behavior is common.  The terms  psychopathy or sociopathy are also used, in some contexts synonymously,  in others, sociopath is differentiated from a psychopath, in that a  sociopathy is rooted in environmental causes, while psychopathy is  genetically based.

In earlier US wars, eg Vietnam, a person who had a concussion would likely have been returned to duty quickly after the immediate symptoms regressed, there would have been no baseline TBI evaluation done (no careful neuropsychiatric testing), and symptoms of 'post concussion syndrome' would have been mostly ignored, and a formal dx of such made in only the most severely affected victims.

That has all (hopefully) changed after the experience of the Iraq war - and the active duty medical staff pay much closer attention to the risk of TBI from even what would, in the past, been considered a 'minor' concussion.

Her decision to leave the ER was unfortunate - if she had told some staff (if she could find one!) she was going to leave they certainly would have tried to talk her into staying -- anybody with new onset but persistent chest pain, shortness of breath, and an 'enlarged heart' belongs in an ER setting, not in a car or parking lot or urgent care center. An urgent care center is not going to be able to help with a heart attack or pulmonary embolus or other bad things.

When I was younger I was investing purely for long term growth, for retirement. Since I was going to keep invested through all market cycles (I never sold anything related to market crashes) I didn't see the point in putting anything into bonds, which during most scenarios do not return as much as equities. When I got to the point of planning to retire in 5-10 years, interest rates had fallen to very low values and were much more likely to go up than down further, so I didn't think it was a good time to accumulate some bonds (or bond funds) because I thought they would predictably lose value. 

So here I am, retired, with a portfolio heavily weighted to stocks. I do have income from a pension and my wife is a disabled vet, and that income is (almost) enough to live on - we have rather low expenses - so I've not needed to significantly withdraw funds from my 'retirement' portfolio, so I'm not tremendously worried about the next market crash.

The only other suggestions I would make from my experience:

1) dollar cost averaging is great -- it keeps you buying shares even during a market crash (when equity prices are low!).

2) don't get scared and sell due to a feared or actual market crash (unless you anticipate you will need the funds within the next 5-10 years, in which case you should have pulled them out of the market anyway regardless of a feared crash!). People I knew who tried to time the market (sell before a crash, buy just before the recovery begins) always screwed up and ended up not doing well. [The way to lose money related to a crash is to get hyped and buy during the good market days in the run-up to a crash, and then to panic and sell after the crash -- that is buying high and selling low, which is backwards from what you want].

3) Start investing at as young an age as you can possible arrange. Time and compound interest (returns) are your friends. I didn't begin till age 30 and in my 40's and 50's I had to save/invest up to 25% or so of my income to meet my goals - that can be hard to do as there are competing things you (or your spouse) will want to spend money on."

askscience,fdfgx0u,t3_el35q2,1578361426.0,"Ideally you would take the antibiotics just long enough to 'cure' the current infection, but no longer. If you stop too soon, you run the risk of (1) not curing the current infection, and (2) leaving alive a group of bacteria that are more resistant to the antibiotic you were taking. This is natural selection or evolution in action. If you then need to take another course of antibiotics, the bacteria that survived the first (too short) course are likely to be more difficult to eradicate with the same antibiotic due to the emergence of resistance. If lots of people do this routinely, soon many antibiotic-resistant bacteria will be out there making treatment of that infection more difficult. 

On the other hand, you don't really want to take antibiotics longer than necessary either. The length of treatment recommended by the doc is an educated guess that may have been validated by clinical studies (take the drug for this long and xx% of patients will be cured). If you feel you have been cured after 5 days of treatment but the Doc gave you a 10 day course of antibiotics, the best I can suggest is to try to contact the Doc and ask for advice. There may be reasons (ie clinical studies) to finish the course, there may not be such reasons. 

Then there is the issue of giving antibiotics to farm animals 'to promote growth'. This practice arguably has a very high risk of developing antibiotic resistance."

politics,fczj43l,t3_ejh1uu,1578102366.0,"A family member used a similar scheme for themself and nuclear family for many years. It took considerable work  -- they had to negotiate with providers (to try to get discounts), they had to work with the 'scheme' to document health issues and treatments, they had to pay the balance not covered by the 'christian donations'. 

Per the christian health expense sharing group members it was helpful and useful, but was much work. The family member has passed away and the spouse is now on medicare, and finds 'real' health insurance to be much easier to use, and you are not forced (as much) to select which of your illnesses to treat and which to ignore.

So I don't think that a 'good' scheme is necessarily a scam, it is a reasonable way for people who are of like mind (ie a religious group/fraternity) who cannot afford normal insurance to get some help with medical bills. 

It is also very likely to be true that members of such 'like minded' groups also don't want to pay for 'those people' to get health care, 'those people' being inconveniently of a different religious persuasion, believing in the 'right to choose', or born with a more pigmented skin shade. I don't know if avoiding 'helping' such people is the main reason for formation of these groups, but I suspect it is perceived as an additional benefit."
