survivor,ffum8ev,t1_ffuhya2,1580244929.0,"Agree, most modern fans who weren’t there during the early seasons won’t truly understand how the massive fan base viewed the show. 

Hatch was reviled, most viewers wanted anybody but Hatch to win Borneo going into the finale. Rudy was obviously the fan favorite, and when Hatch won instead of him there was palpable distaste of the season’s result as a whole. Hatch being this beloved and dominant winner is complete revisionist history, not reflective of viewer response to the season when it ended. 

This response to Borneo definitely impacted the meta-narrative of Australian Outback. Both the producers and the contestants knew America wanted a winner who would be cheered on by the fans. IMO, production pushed the “keep around the most deserving” narrative specifically for the viewers, to justify Tina cutting Jerri and Amber’s throats prematurely. Hatch might have “invented” alliances, but Tina was savvy enough to keep her core three together all the way to the finale by playing both sides of the two major alliances after the merge. She laid the groundwork for modern Survivor strategy that was later built upon by players like Rob C, FairPlay, and eventually culminating in a second similar-styled win with Tony. 

Nowadays, building a core alliance, then playing both sides of the original tribes to your advantage and take out threats to your game is the most widely used strategy for many modern players. You can logically trace those roots all the way back to Tina. 

Survivor needed Colby to win Australian Outback, and when he didn’t they completely whitewashed the reality of what happened to appease the viewers. It wasn’t until the next season where production finally got the winner it needed in Ethan."

politics,fftkvd2,t1_ffth4t0,1580223174.0,"> That's insane. It's like saying a police officer can't arrest a superior.

There are higher forms of authority than the superior officer who are able to bring charges against them. For example, police departments have Internal Affairs who exist outside the chain of command for this exact reason. None such authority exists above the US President. 

> Or a lieutenant in the army couldn't arrest a general who ordered the wholesale genocide of a people.

War crimes are not determined and adjudicated by a lower officer. They make an arrest, but only after things have followed the proper legal channels. The case would ultimately go before a high court with the higher authority to strip him of rank and proceed with indictments, arrest, and criminal trial. None such authority exists above the US President. 

> NO ONE IS ABOVE THE LAW

> No one is a ""higher authority"" when it comes to legal matters

I agree, nobody is above the law and there exists no higher authority than the President, Congress and Supreme Court. 

That’s why we have a co-equal branch of government in the Legislative to hold the Executive accountable via impeachment, with the results confirmed by the third co-equal branch of government in the Judiciary. There’s a reason Presidents cannot be pardoned for crimes in which they were impeached, the natural progression is that once the chief Executive is stripped of their position, higher authorities now exist to press criminal charges against the individual."
