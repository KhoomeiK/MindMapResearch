I can imagine that yes, some that have remained childfree may have gone on to regret it later... but it's the same with the parents that go on to regret having their children - and there is a lot more of those people. 

If anyone is even the tiniest bit (I mean literally even 1%) not sure they want children, do not have them. You have to be 100% into having children and even then it isn't always foolproof. 

I was lucky, when I told my mum about not wanting children she said ""I don't blame you, I love you but it isn't easy and still isn't now you are all older."" Find the person who replies with that to you. That fully supports you. My Mum is now ""Nanny/Nana"" to our dog and two cats and she loves it. People, even if not your mother, will support you through this. 

""Ok Mum, well not to worry I just wanted to be open with you."" Then never discuss it with her again.

Actually I think the whole time that I felt that way I never really thought of it as a lack of women’s rights. All I’d ever heard was “abortion is murder” blah blah blah.

I would suggest starting out with some videos of things in the sims that YOU love the most. Whether it be lets plays or certain challenges etc but whatever you enjoy most. There is nothing worse than watching a video where the YouTuber just isn't into it and looks bored. Jesse recently stopped doing lets plays, she just doesn't enjoy them and I think it was the best way she could have taken her channel. 

Do some videos of things you really love in the sims, build a following, even if just a small one, and then ask your followers what they want to see next.

childfree,fdq7irk,t3_emohwz,1578658158.0,"Hi New Dad. I hope getting this out into the open helped you even just a little bit for a short while. 

What did your wife think to adoption? I'm sure it might not be an easy decision but you are both miserable and need to get some semblance of your life back. Also, the baby will feel the strain and know he/she is unwanted. There are so many loving people out there just waiting for a baby like yours. Give it some serious thought, but don't abandon your wife. You are both in this."
thesims,fdq6v0e,t3_emoe5b,1578657407.0,Knew what this was immediately! Especially the open for business guy. So awesome! Thanks for sharing with us.
cavaliers,fdq6ni8,t3_empufg,1578657166.0,Aww! I remember meeting our girl for the first time at this age. Felt like an age after that until she was old enough for us to take her home
cavalierkingcharles,fdon6xp,t3_emfnrd,1578608574.0,"We brush our cavalier every other day, particularly her ears as they get the worst! But we have her professionally groomed every 2 months. Stops her from getting mats and she gets to see her favourite groomer who always has a tin of treats waiting for her!

If you are getting a puppy, brush from the first day you get him/her. They will learn to enjoy it this way. 

Have fun with your new baby!"
Sims4,fdokql6,t3_emfebv,1578607116.0,Too cute! I love this. It’s perfect. Going to move my sim in and have roommates for the other houses. Thank you so much for sharing with us!
