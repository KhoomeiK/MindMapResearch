cars,fet1pgj,t3_eojexg,1579370993.0,"I have a 2010 Kia Forte EX, and I haven't checked the coolant in a while.

So the level has gotten so low that I can't see the color of the coolant that's in the reservoir, and if I look in the radiator cap there is nothing.

Apparently there are 2 colored coolants (Blue or Green) that are safe with my car, but you can't mix them. I have no idea (right now) how to check my type of coolant when it's so low.

Please let me know if there are any ways to check. If it helps I have found various pieces of blue markings around the car tubs and stuff, but I don't want to make any assumptions based off of a bit if tape and some paint like stuff.

All tips are helpful, and yes I know I'm an idiot for not checking for so long. I never had any overheating lights or low coolant lights, but I'm glad this came to my attention now.

Are there other ways to check?

Is it safe for me to just put in what I have (Green Coolant)?"
