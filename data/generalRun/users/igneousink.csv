I got something right!  Any left-handed people? If so I'm quitting my job and going full Miss Cleo (haha just kidding) - it isn't a stretch to guess left-handed based on the musical stuff, books and artsy feel because statistically left handers are more prone to be artsy fartsy.  In my opinion.  Am left handed."
RBI,ffwem8h,t1_ffwd65z,1580298061.0,"I am sitting here reading all of this with my mouth open.  

You experienced a childhood that was horrific and traumatic.  

Denied basic needs, you were also controlled and treated like you didn't matter, your body didn't matter, you existed for the benefit of others.  children should be loved and celebrated, not sexed and beaten.  

As far as therapy?  My childhood was similar minus the god thing.  Parents were more like insane 70's groupie fiends (that followed bands) so it was a whole different flavor.  I say all that to qualify because like you, I didn't really realize how bad it was until much later. 

And even then I didn't realize, not fully.  So I wasn't looking to talk to anyone and I don't know that it would have helped if I did because I wasn't ready.  Ya gotta be ready.  

You're married - you can read & write - you obviously have some amazing survival skills because it feels like you are on the other side.  I hope you know how precious and rare you are.  And strong.  

I still struggle to feel about my past.  I could be talking about a graphic act with my therapist and I'll talk about it like I'm reading a recipe on the back of a can.  Shit's not normal but then again neither are we.  

It will be a process for you but I feel, in my heart, that you have transcended the worse of it.  Now it is time to simply just realize that fact alone.  That you are not there, that you are better than that and that you deserve a good life."
depressionregimens,ffwe4oj,t3_evbvxn,1580297462.0,"***Wellbutrin*** \- 7/10 - slightly boosts anxiety, minor ""dull"" feeling with regards to libido, works quick but can sometimes stop working (in my experience).

***Nortriptylene*** \- Old school tri-cyclic - 9/10 I believe it helps my gut, also seems to help with alcohol cravings (stopped drinking before christmas), no real side effects other than dry mouth, no hangover feeling, also helps anxiety into the next morning

***Gabapentin*** \- 7/10 - dosing is always weird, sometimes you overshoot (? not sure how to explain it) but it helps with overall pain and heavy feeling, calms down social anxiety, makes me feel a little amorous sometimes.  Have taken it on and off for long enough though to know that breaks from it are important or it stops working.  Has a lifting mood effect unless dosage goes above a certain amount and then I get tired.

***Lyrica*** \- Gabapentin's prettier sister - 4/10 - it made me extremely intoxicated.  like, i went to a different planet.  Hyper and couldn't stop talking.  it was uncomfortable but I give it a 4 because there was a time in my life when I really like that feeling

***Paxil*** \- 3/10 terrible awful not cool - did stop panic attacks but caused brain zaps, flushing, inability to sleep, little bit of mania, inability to focus and think - the only benefit was it made me see that maybe a medication could help me, just not that one.

***Lexapro*** \- 6/10 - high libido effects, inability to climax, hard to come off of, works quickly and quietly, mania in higher doses, dry mouth

***Celexa*** \- 8/10 generic was better than the original - similar side effects, less libido impact, still kind of hard to come off of, stopped working after about 6 months

***Lithium*** \- can we use negative numbers?  Made me dumb, couldn't speak, couldn't put words together, metal taste in mouth, was like a zombie - was horrible

***Seroquel*** \- only good for sleep.  terrible for daytime use unless you are Psychotic and then it is wonderful:  5/10 - definitely no sex for me on this one, gave me the munchies, got fat

***All of the Benzos*** \- 0/10.  don't get me wrong I love them but they do bad things to me and I have definitely used up my ""benzo minutes"" will all that I took in my 20's haha

***Ambien*** \- 10/10 - makes me trip balls but only for a day or two then it doesn't - sex is ridiculous and fun

***Topamax*** \- used off-label for Trauma symptoms - 6/10 gave me weird tingly sensation in middle of forehead that was a deal breaker.  I can't describe it but it was untenable.  when i took it i was not in a relationship or interested in one so i can't speak to libido on this one

***Ketamine*** \- recreational not doctor approved use - 9/10 - lifted me up and I felt great during and after.  actually gave me the oomph to end a relationship (that needed ending).  dosing seems a bit tight in me tho - there's a fine line between ""wow i feel great"" and ""holy shit i'm stuck in the floor""

***Tramadol*** \- even tho this is a synthetic opiate, i read about it's SSRI effects and decided i would try it myself, off-label, as a depression drug.  4/10 - i don't care what anyone says it's addictive.  you can get really sick if you take too much.  but 4 because when it works it really works.  It numbed my stuff.  no hippity dippity.

***Adderall and related drugs like phentermine*** \- gosh.  this drug is both 10 out of 10 and 0 out of 10.  For me, I have to stay far far away!  made me high as shit!  not good!  but i used to like being high so hence the 10/10 because i felt like Gengis Fekking Kahn about to gallop across the mongolian plains.   but then you have the crash.  which is awful.  No nookie!  I just wanted to talk a lot.

***Cocaine*** \- 2/10 would not recommend - not a good long term solution for people who struggle with depression and/or anxiety.  but i give it a 2 because i still have fond memories of my first lift-off and how great i feel.  have not done in almost a decade and will never ever ever do again.

***Ecstasy/MDMA*** \- 9/10 - dosing was tough - additives would muddy up process - but I had some real paradigm shifts.  did too much, hurt my brain, it stopped working and turned on me.  I would be open to doing it under the care of a person who does that for a living (within a therapeutic setting).  it was like my heart opened up when i took it (initially).  no sex but a lot of cuddling?

***LSD BIG AMOUNTS*** \- I thought I was going to die and come back as a sound wave so no to this one.  0/10

***LSD SMALL AMOUNTS*** \- it really did seem to help?  just did it recently but not enough to really have a solid opinion - initial rating 8/10 for very limited and controlled dosing that does not occur regularly but at specific times (like 4 times a year or whatever).  It did make me feel a little zingier in the pants but didn't necessarily want to bone anyone

***Mushrooms*** \- 10/10 - such a lovely thing when you do it right but have not done it in 12 or so years so it might hit me different now.  loved feeling connected to nature and looking at art books.  gave me a sense of peace that I don't normally experience.

I'm sure I'm forgetting a bunch but those are the highlights.

Oh!  And in all cases, except for Paxil, libido came back within a week.  Paxil killed it pretty dead for a good 3 months; I was a mess.

Best of luck to you!  And your libido, lol!

Lastly - approach ALL drugs with caution and knowledge.  ESP the ""off label"" (haha) ones.

So I'm back in therapy (it's been a 30 yr process) because I have fallen in love for the first time in my life and recognizing that I might have some form of attachment disorder?  Her behavior had effects on me that I am now only realizing.  

But!!  It is important to re-frame and what I choose to remember from my earliest years is this:

My Nanna worked for Hudson River Psych in NY with the worst of the worst.  One of her patients was kind of in and out of her ward and when she was ""out"" she kind of hung around my family, which, in the 70's - was OK.  

This particular patient would hang out in my neighborhood on the weekends and if she saw my mom leave she would come upstairs to the apartment we lived in and take care of me.  If the whim-whams (that is what she called it) came upon her and she had to leave, she would entrust me to the care of a downstairs neighbor.  

Her name was charlotte and she just passed away.  But even in her crack addicted schizophrenia she was a better parent than my own.  

As I reflect on this as an adult, it speaks volumes to the inadequate care I received.  But it doesn't make me sad, it makes me relieved.  Because there is a reason why I am the way I am and why I don't seem to fit in anywhere or with anyone."
