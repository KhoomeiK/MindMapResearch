The only assholes in this game are the ones who repeatedly kill you even though you made it clear you don't want to participate in a deathmatch. I am not condoning the latter player nor wanting to introduce features that encourage that.  


My issue is with the first example, the player who attacks wagons. I have never done this because I have never had the opportunity to. I personally couldn't tell you if it is even worth it, what rewards you get from doing it, or even a strategy for it. Believe me I tried for a week strait. But without a players robbery attempts, Wagon deliveries are just that, an unnecessarily long road trip. And turning in bounties becomes a dreaded wait for the timer to run out.   


Players mostly ignore this aspect of the game partially because current itteration of gameplay makes it extremely awkward. There are changes Rockstar can make that would iron out these issues and make for a much more dynamic game play experience."
