That was a mistake I made in financial, that and thinking I didn't need to study for the final as diligently as I should have."

college,fdyhp7g,t3_enbuma,1578779921.0,"820 and 1.4? Oh dude, I'm so sorry. I've been there with issues at home too so I get how hard it can be. I'd recommend you look into the programs you want at community college, studying and retaking the SAT before you get enough college credits to not be able to take it (I have friends that just took it sophomore year of college for the first time) since you may be asked for it depending on how you transfer. Best of luck."
