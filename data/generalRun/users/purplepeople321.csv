SandersForPresident,ff68byp,t1_ff49cqq,1579621518.0,"That's what I went on explaining. I know that I actively come up with a pre-judgement. Knowing your faults or some of the basic ways the mind works (seeing patterns to develop a likely outcome) we are able to throw this aside. Unfortunately not as many people are as deep as that. Introspection is one of my most loved and hsted traits at the same time. I am able to look into how I thought about a situation and do some metathinking. It can lead to disliking the way you think and cause international conflict which requires resolution. Usually that's by actively trying to do better next time. It'd be so much easier to not care and just go off initial thoughts, but it's just not in me to do that. There comes a point where one thinks ""It's so damn easy to see what is being done is wrong, how do so few people see it?"" And that is one thing I cannot fix, or at least nowhere near the rate I'd hope. It often takes months or years of discussions with someone to sway their longstanding opinion a little bit."

I'd say anonymity, but honestly people will say shit they don't truly believe themselves, and would never think or say in person. It feels like the less face time we spend with people, the more people become random objects of no meaning. I have mostly positive interactions in public. People hold the door for one another, let you cut in line if they have a lot of groceries and you just have a handful, help eachother after a large snow storm to clear the driveways and sidewalks. My general day in the world is positive. Online is varying. Is the guy that helps the elderly lady next door to remove snow from her driveway also going online and causing as much drama as possible? Is it mostly an age thing? I was a troll in my teens/early 20s. I'm in my 30s now with a wife and a kid, and don't bother in being hateful to others.

worldnews,ff3jxqk,t1_ff2o4t2,1579542638.0,"That's true. Neither system works well, as it's either the majority states that can control the majority of population or the majority of population that can control majority of states. Metropolitan ideas aren't always in the best interest of more rural areas, and ideas from rural areas aren't always in the best interest of metropolitan areas. I think this is where the ""govern yourself"" comes into play, but given full ability to govern yourself tends to also lead us down a bad path in some states.

California would have more voting power than: Iowa, Nevada, Arkansas, Puerto Rico, Mississippi, Kansas, New Mexico, Nebraska, Idaho, West Virginia, Hawaii, New Hampshire, Maine, Montana, Rhode Island, Delaware, South Dakota, North Dakota, Alaska, Vermont, and Wyoming combined.

SandersForPresident,ff3h810,t1_ff36p87,1579540970.0,"I always say it's natural human nature to judge people and situations on face value. It's a way to keep us safe from potential threats (e.g. if you get mugged by people of a certain look, you would steer clear of people that look like that generally). Completely agree that it is within our grasp as humans to recognize our snap judgments, and work to prove ourselves wrong. I actively judge people based on appearance, then work to prove my judgement wrong. Over time this proved the most simple, yet important conclusion.. People are people. You can get any personality from any socioeconomic status or ethnicity. Nothing on the exterior determines who that person is on the inside. This is why I love humanity so much. We're full of beautiful contradictions, it's just that most people don't see it. That actually includes a decent portion of conservatives as well. I know some truly kind hearted loving people who happen to be conservative. We almost completely disagree on every point, but would still take a bullet for the other, will help each other out in a huge snow storm, etc. We have friendly (semi-heated) debates, try to see eachother's perspective, and go on.
