I redid my fuel lines, got an upgraded fuel pump, fuel filter, map sensor, cleaned the injectors, and got a new air filter. Nothing changed it. Colder air is going to change your fuel to air ratio and cause the engine to run lean. It happens to my motorcycle sometimes, and that is carbureted. Best I got for ya."

Funny thing is that China has been slowly, and illegally, taking over the South China Sea so they can have a monopoly on trade through the area which would screw over even more hungry kids in the USA for a potentially longer period of time. They are building islands to do this. That is money they could put toward their own people in northern rural communities that don’t even have running water. Keep breaking down complex global issues into redditor shaming and see what happens by 2049.

I guess we really shouldn’t worry about China because no one would ever try to dominate the world. /s"

It is called stringing someone along. Just because you don’t do it doesn’t mean that other people don’t. One in twenty five people is a sociopath. 

1) You blame guys for misreading signals, 2) you bring up friend zoning which I never mentioned, 3) and then you mention that “someone is just flirting with guys to break them”, 4) and then you mention a guy would be a psycho if he did what I said.

1) You’re victim blaming, 2) then you’re trying to give a lesson like you know better, 3,) you used “someone” instead of girl/woman, 4) then you agree with me but also specifically mention that a “guy” would be a psycho if he did that instead of saying “anyone” or “someone” (I know someone doesn’t really make sense in the context, but you get the picture) just like in the third point.
