Sims4,fftlr7c,t1_fftldf6,1580223795.0,After every sims session I give my husband a synopsis of what happened. He doesn't care but he listens and that makes me happy
atheism,ffs7o41,t1_ffrr3o5,1580175162.0,"Unless you know that something you learned about in school was the exact opposite of the truth then you don't know to seek the truth. 

Basic history or not, some of us were taught as children that mother Theresa and Ghandi were really good people. At least we have access to the truth now but let's be a little more forgiving to people who were indoctrinated."
PlayTemtem,ffr3ezn,t3_eujkmy,1580149599.0,So glad I power leveled first xD
PlayTemtem,ffqy15u,t1_ffqxxas,1580146198.0,"You never told a story about your SO to anyone? Coworkers? No one? Not even a ""my SO and I went out to dinner at this new restaurant"" type story?? Seems odd."
PlayTemtem,ffqxtgf,t1_ffqwj79,1580146065.0,You never talk about your SO to other people IRL?
PlayTemtem,ffqxr1r,t1_ffqtmmq,1580146024.0,"I quite like the representation and I don't find it to be forced at all. If you're feeling ""reminded"" that LGBT+ people exist every time you encounter one then that's kind of on you for not seeing it as a normal part of life."
Sims4,ffp45ln,t3_euehks,1580085783.0,That flooring reminds me of the first Sims game. Nostalgic
bipolar,ffgrla5,t3_etfa8v,1579913268.0,"Once for like 3 days straight I was able to hear the birds in the sky and watch them fly around, I felt so happy and free for once. I don't remember to try anymore :("
bipolar,ffglyjs,t1_ffg8twy,1579909312.0,I had a similar thing happen to me with my therapist. I'm considering canceling the rest of my appointments with her. She had no sympathy for my recent bad situation and said my mentality is just making it worse and I should stop dwelling on it. Well no shit!! IT'S CALLED INTRUSIVE THOUGHTS. She made me so upset and I just shut down after that.
environment,ffdh1pv,t3_esy5e5,1579820699.0,I want to know what happens after this. Do people not go outside? How do you clean up snow that's higher than you?
