aww,fgf9i99,t1_fgf9c67,1580731206.0,"I live in Sweden and like i said if the breed don't have problems then i didnt see a problem, our cousins adopted a mutt from their neighbor and that dog was plagued with problems so acting like all mutt's are perfect and can't have anything wrong with them is straight up wrong."
aww,fgf7r9y,t1_fgf7b3g,1580728945.0,"There arent really any pounds (that i know off) were im from so  that probablly makes our opinions differ . But like a dog being purebreed (aslong as that breed dosn't have any big problems) i don't think is wrong either, aslong as you don't breed close relatives or those with any ailment i then i think it's fine."
aww,fgf780d,t1_fgf6ocv,1580728189.0,You never specified what type off breeder you were talking about but i agree large breeders are genuinley terrible. Smaller breeders doing 1-2 litters a year i don't think is wrong.

ShitPostCrusaders,fdn43u6,t1_fdmyo0l,1578576713.0,I mean it is offensive but it's not really a word you  would generally link too someone with autism.
Awwducational,fdk17bq,t1_fdk11vw,1578493512.0,I believe they breath through both the mouth and trunk like for us humans and our nose.
Awwducational,fdjykix,t1_fdjnweq,1578491488.0,I mean i don't think they deepthroat it so no. They most likely just put the tip in the mouth and just kinda keeps it there.
