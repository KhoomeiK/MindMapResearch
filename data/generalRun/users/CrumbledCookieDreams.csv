Reddit loves to hate on everything.

Just saw yet another post yesterday about how male refugees from the Middle East should be left to die because they're all animals and the women and children need to be rescued because they are oppressed and enslaved.

I am a Muslim woman from Pakistan. I am telling you that the amount of hate I have received online never ends. It will never end either.

I must be enslaved. Poor, helpless woman forced to wear a hijab, so many more things to generalise at me when they've literally never happened to me. No-one is making me wear a head scarf. 

I'm a horrible person. Yes, I totally am. I've spent my life torturing small children and animals for not being holy. That is my purpose in life.

Terrorist, sandnigger, towelhead, radicalist, dirty because of my skin color, smelly, alien, savage, village goat, illiterate, disgusting, stupid, oppressed. It never ends.

I have spent my life telling people online that I'm from the UK or the US for shame of the sheer hate directed at me if I tell the wrong person.

I remember being eight years old on an online message board for a cooking game for kids, they told to kill myself for being a dirty Muslim freak. They told me such awful things.

I was born a month after 9/11. I have faced the consequences of something I did not do and would never do my entire life.

Freak. Monster. Savage. Alien. 

I only started telling people a year or so ago when I finally gave up at preventing the hate. I am tired of having to hide where I was born.

It was not my choice to be born here. Did you choose to be born to an American family? How lucky you are that you have an excuse.

I lost a very close friend of mine five years ago. I had told her where I was from three years after meeting online.

She was from New Jersey. We had talked daily for three years straight.

I finally admitted where I was from and there was just this torrent of abuse and outrage over it and then she blocked me on all the social media we had shared with one another.

I had sort of hinted before that I was from somewhere close to India so I had thought it would be okay to tell her. That she wouldn't hate me for it.

She felt that I had lied to her for not telling her outright that I was such a horrible person from a horrible place. I hadn't felt safe telling her.

She flooded my messages with comments about every personal thing I had ever told her and tore into every insecurity. She called me a monster and then she blocked me.

I've kept the contact open still in case she ever changes her mind. I don't think she will.

It makes you feel...Subhuman. I hate myself for a lot of things. I've finally stopped hating myself for where I was born of all things. It's not my fault.

I've spent my life dreaming of moving to New Zealand after my studies. It always was a perfect place to me.

After what happened last year, that idea has gotten weaker and weaker. I still want to move to New Zealand. I don't think I will ever feel safe anywhere though.

I see constant hate for people of the region and the religion here everywhere. It has lessened in the past few years but it is everywhere.

I would love to trade lives with you u/altfm1. As far as I've seen, the most people comment about Christianity is the pedophile jokes and r/atheism having a hate boner, which it seems to for all religions indifferently.

I would love to be able to not feel like I'm being scrutinized anytime I go abroad.

Is this person safe? Are they planning something? Do they look suspicious?

Little comments people will make at a grocery store in the US or little second or third glances they give you in Austria.

Always watching. Waiting.

To not be pulled aside for a security check every time I'm in the airport.

I follow the religion of hate and intolerance. This is my personality. I apologise for my religion and my existence."

What about my grandfather, my father, my brother? How can you justify tearing families apart like that and leaving half to die?

The men in my life are kind, good people. There's always going to be a crazy uncle or aunt that wants to live in the middle ages and I've seen that as a constant in all cultures pretty much.

They think all the women are victims. I choose to do what I want to do and I live in Pakistan for Christ's sake. I don't live in a village where I'm forced into marriage and enslaved. 

No idea what they've been reading:
>I've been reading a book about the conditions women are there and it's awful.
>When I can afford it I will adopt a child from one of those countries.

It is worse than Western societies but it's come a long way even in my lifetime and I'm still barely an adult. It will progress as the world progresses. Time fixes.

I choose to continue to follow religion. I am not forced to do so. If you wish to attack people of my religion attack all of us. Dividing it like that doesn't make sense when some of the most strict beliefs I've seen here come from women as well.

I'm honestly horrified by how they speak. Just thinking of leaving my brother here alone kills me. He's older than me and has had his own family for quite some time now but he didn't stop being my brother. I love him. I don't want to leave him to die. He is not inferior because he is a man no more than I am because I am a woman. A woman is not inferior and neither is a man.

This reminds me of the cruel things they say our guys say. It belongs on r/selfawarewolves. They are the very monsters they champion against and it's disgusting. It's r/MGTOW for women.

How can you even talk about another human being like that? I've never seen another person as less than because of skin or religion or gender. I do not understand what hurts someone so badly that it breaks them like this.

I pity such sad, broken people that wish to inflict cruelty like those who feel this way. I hope you get help. You need it as much as the ones who made you hate everyone do."

We do have a lot of languages but those are also pretty much Urdu mixed in with other language influences.

Urdu itself is pretty much 70% Hindi as well, but the writing system is different. Punjabi is similar.

For example, my grandma only speaks Punjabi or Saraiki. I don't see her much, only a couple days every two years or so. I don't speak anything except English and Urdu.

However I can understand 80-90% of what she says because so much is in common.

Just tryna help yah out cause Pakistani isn't a language lol. Urdu/Punjabi is the default for everything, but English has started to become more important for the more educated.

Regional languages aren't often used in reporting. Moreso they're just for daily talking to one another or literature.

Also, they are all their own languages for the most part. Not dialects. Because everyone from Pakistan doesn't have the same ancestry so they didn't bring the same languages with them.

We have around 8 main languages used here and then the rest of the 64 are minor ones. Around thirty languages have distinguishable dialects.

mildlyinteresting,fegx2tk,t1_fegnuf9,1579104464.0,"My Gramma is 98 and she's had dementia since she was 47. She hasn't spoken in 48 years now I think that made sense. Just random words and jumbles. 

She mumbles incoherently sometimes and she likes cats so we got three and she loves them even if she can't do much. She smiles more when they sit on her and they do love doing that. Poor lady. Her hands shake badly but she tries to hug them. 

My gramps is a saint that's been caring for her forever because he loves her.

She cared for their seven kids for the first half of her life and three had major developmental disorders and she never abandoned them.

They all passed a couple years before the dementia began to set in.

She doesn't really remember much anymore. She sees my brother and calls him by her husband's name.

We believe she knows of her childhood up until around 14 or so and she grew up friends with my gramps since she was a baby so she remembers him sorta.

Two weeks ago she showed the most recognition she has in half a century. I just called out her full name and asked her if that was her and she took a bit but she smiled and nodded. She's still there, but only rarely.

She remembers small bits of prayers and people sometimes who passed a long time ago. She used to ask sometimes to go home and that it was just around the corner. Her home after being married was just around the corner from her childhood home and that's what she used to ask for. Used to ask for her mom alot when she still talked.

She doesn't remember that her house hasn't existed since she was in her twenties and they had to flee India after the Partition and her entire family was murdered for being Muslims when trying to cross the border. It's really sad.

My gramps also lost everyone. He had a brother who lived but never found him after they were seperated until long after he passed and had to grieve for him again.

Both my grandparents love each other so much. Whenever she sees him she smiles and tries to touch his face.

They're old and wrinkly but they love each other and always will.

She used to wander off a lot and knew how to open the gates so we had to keep them locked a lot but she doesn't move much anymore.

I remember her wandering off and finding her caretaker there at my college looking for her and she just walked into the gates. My college was only a street away from my house but across a busy intersection.

She didn't know my siblings and I were there but she knew that we would go in a lot because she'd walk around a lot with the caretaker and pick and drop us off because it made her happy so one day she decided to come herself.

She hasn't done much but mumble the last three years. Falls a lot even with constant attention. She had a minor stroke last week and got stitches on her head for a deep gash from falling.

My dad says my gramps is just waiting for her so they can go together because they never want to be alone, otherwise he'd have passed too. He's been very weak for a long time but still of sound mind thankfully, besides some things he forgets. He's 105 years old.

They've never been apart once in almost a hundred years. They've seen each other every day for their entire lives. They'll go together when she's ready.

I think it's sort of beautiful in a sad way. They were meant to be soulmates I think."

They make fun of me for not being able to sparse out each sound individually. It's because in my language we talk much faster so it's more difficult for people to get, whereas English is a very slow, mellow language so I have to slow down for my friends to get what I'm saying.

WhitePeopleTwitter,fee0i92,t1_fee0dso,1579023820.0,That is very nice of them. I like them.
WhitePeopleTwitter,fee017k,t1_fedzyka,1579023492.0,Ah okay. That seems to make sense. So you have less of a divide between countries and more with race?
Damnthatsinteresting,fedzew0,t1_fedyprz,1579023114.0,"I'm not American lol. I'm from Pakistan and my birth at the top hospital of my city was free.

I got both my corneas transplanted for free three years ago too. I don't think anyone in my family has ever paid for hospital care beyond the vending machine stuff I believe, even though cancer does run in my family.

A lotta people choose to donate their organs here after passing cause they think it'll make god happy. I got mine pretty fast. Was only on a list for three weeks. 

All in all, pretty nice situation tbh."
mildlyinteresting,fedxbxd,t1_fedx3i3,1579021870.0,I'm enjoying every minute :D
HumansBeingBros,fedwsbc,t1_fedj3j5,1579021539.0,Hold them from behind as you tie it. Make sure to breathe heavily in their ear.
mildlyinteresting,fedwh83,t1_fedwe1c,1579021351.0,I'm squishing my cats. They deserve it damnit.
AskReddit,fedvptq,t1_fedg584,1579020897.0,You don't wanna do something like react badly cause you were surprised and make them feel bad. Then you'd feel bad and everyone would cry.
AskReddit,fedvl40,t1_fecumzv,1579020818.0,There was another story on here about the dude being her fiance but he cheated on her.
mildlyinteresting,fedvfgi,t1_feduual,1579020726.0,"Thank you for your help :)

I feel like a mix between a first time parent and an excited friend lol.

I adore them so much and I've been learning all sorts of things in this thread like they shed claws and their first teeth and whiskers and I want to squish their cute little faces and feed them more but they just ate so they'll get more later and I just wanna make them so happy, y'know?

They're so perfect and I adore them so much and I will die for them.

I can remember my dad just giving up on shutting the door on me when I was a kiddo cause I'd sob outside till he opened the door and play with me cause I didn't get to see him much cause he was always at work and I honestly wanna tell him how bad I feel for bothering him like this cause I understand the feeling now.

So he'd be trying to nap whilst I patted his beard and squealed at him and this is honestly the same feeling tbh."
mildlyinteresting,fedurpx,t1_feduk8f,1579020331.0,I'm going to start squealing. I swear to god I'm going to squish my kitten's cute faces so much when they start doing adorable things like becoming adults and growing responsible adult teeth. I love them so much.
mildlyinteresting,fedunly,t1_feduh1h,1579020260.0,"It feels like having kids lol. Just give me peace for two hours then you can sleep on the bed.

I think I'll start trying harder to not give in. Thank you :)"
mildlyinteresting,fedu13p,t1_fedt3u9,1579019878.0,They shed their nails!!!!! I'm practically bouncing with excitement for my kittens to start doing stuff like this. I just got them in October and I've never had cats before and I love them so much and I wanna hit each milestone with them with stuff like this. So cuuuute.
mildlyinteresting,fedtx0i,t1_fedsxbg,1579019809.0,"I love my kittens sooo much. I love their personalities and I love how they act.

We used to have dogs when I was a kid and I honestly just didn't like them tbh. They were all so hyperactive and loud and I hated that. Always wagging their tail, always happy. It just felt alien to me. Like clones that can't feel anything but happiness. Same reaction to everyone. They didn't do much and I never really liked that.

Been begging my family for cats for ten years now and my brother was kinda allergic before he went off to Uni so we could never get any before.

I love how they have like actual moods and personalities over happy happy happy 24/7. I adore their cute faces and soft meows. I love how they roll over for belly rubs and the individual little things you have to learn about them.

One of my cats is a total love bug but she doesn't like belly rubs. The other two do but they don't really care for pets besides chin scratches. One purrs like a generator, one doesn't purr but chuffs at you, one purrs for headrubs. I know their individual tastes in food, their moods, how to tell what they want.

It's lovely because it's like having little people around you. Dogs never felt more than just...Dogs to me. They never had personality. I love that about my cats. So much sass.

Also I need to ask a cat lover this very badly.

How in the world do you ignore your cat? I have three Persians and they spend their time competing for my lap and I just wanna sit alone in my room sometimes without a cat purring on me all day and I feel really guilty shutting the door cause they scratch the door and whine and I don't want them to be alone and it makes me sad but I spend hours and hours with them every day and how do I get personal space. Please help lol. I don't know how to say no to their grouchy, lovely faces."
AskReddit,fedsmit,t1_fecfuaj,1579019022.0,Yes. Absolutely. Not compatible with an elephant trunk being shoved up things. Imagine trying to deepthroat it. What a nightmare. Smaller guys are better.
WhitePeopleTwitter,fedsbqw,t1_feds9dg,1579018837.0,That makes more sense to me now. Thank you!
mildlyinteresting,fedsa74,t1_feds769,1579018810.0,"I got three kittens in October and I've never had cats before so I'm excited to learn stuff like this :)
I wanna poke my cats with them now hehe."
mildlyinteresting,feds3wq,t1_feds0ah,1579018704.0,"That's so coooool. How long does it take to grow back, would you know? I got three kittens in October and I'm excited to hit all the milestones and stuff like this cause I've never had cats before."
Unexpected,fedrzla,t1_fedrwsh,1579018629.0,Exactly. Things in large quantities hurt you. Even if you eat too much fruit you'll get fat. You gotta have moderation. If so you can try anything.
todayilearned,fedqx4p,t1_fedgt9x,1579017963.0,She dead.
Unexpected,fedqu7u,t1_fedmq0t,1579017911.0,Why?
WhitePeopleTwitter,fedqpxr,t1_fedqhdc,1579017836.0,I still don't understand tbh. But I give up I guess.
WhitePeopleTwitter,fedqcbl,t1_fedpi3e,1579017598.0,Why are they called yellow though? Never understood that cause they don't look yellow so I dunno where that came from.
Unexpected,fedqaa7,t1_fedcrc0,1579017563.0,"Don't know why people are down-voting this dude. You can give your kid a lil bit. Kids over 5 can have a lil beer/wine in the UK. Doesn't hurt em.

Just like you cat can have a lil bit of salami."
Damnthatsinteresting,fedpoqn,t1_fedp66l,1579017191.0,If you don't have space just cremate. The US should also start cremating. Don't need more graveyards. Be a papaw tree instead. How nice. You can also only be for like 20-100 years lease the plot then they give it to someone else I think.
Damnthatsinteresting,fedomr8,t1_fedokf2,1579016527.0,Sounds more like the US to me lol
Unexpected,fedola9,t1_fednp97,1579016500.0,Lmao. A beer doesn't make you alcoholic.
mildlyinteresting,fedo57d,t1_fednklj,1579016216.0,That's so coooool
