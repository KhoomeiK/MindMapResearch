teenagers,fedrtiw,t1_fedo7sl,1579018524.0,"i’m gonna disagree. She might’ve been a little harsh but getting asked out like that is incredibly awkward lmao. Most people would react the same and now she has a bunch of dudes on some site she probably doesn’t browse calling her an asshole and a bitch, when she’s probably like 14-16. I’m not ragging on the kid for asking her like that, we all did cringey shit when we were younger but it concerns me that if you’re actually in your 20s or higher that you think a random teen girl is a “huge asshole” for not wanting to date a dude from a lame pick up line."

todayilearned,fcvki0f,t3_ej0umo,1578004039.0,The nickel mines school shooting! I went to high school in Lancaster County and since I didn’t grow up there I was unaware of it until I was in journalism class on the tenth anniversary of the shooting. It’s a really interesting case and a lot of first responders in the area have a “where I was when it happened” type story. My senior year I was in tech school for EMS and when I did my clinicals I got to hear a lot of different stories from people who were involved in the response. It was a really horrifying day for many in the area and it’s shocking that it’s not well known whatsoever basically outside of Lancaster county. If you’re ever in the area Lancaster General Hospital has a painting in the trauma hallway from Nickel Mines.
