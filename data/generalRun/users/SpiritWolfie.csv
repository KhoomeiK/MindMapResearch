He had learning disabilities but he had a dream of one day becoming a Navy Seal.

Not only did he achieve that goal, he's done SO Much more than just that.  But his journey to achieve that goal is quite the journey.  It was filled with failures and set backs but he wouldn't give up.

Changing your current situation means you'll have to do things that feel COMPLETELY WRONG TO YOU.  WHY?  They feel wrong because you're not used to them.  They feel wrong because you've never done them consistently or you've done them in the past and you were met with some sort of negativity from some source.  You'll have to push through that negativity if you want to accomplish your dreams.

You have unknown depths.  
If you want to start learning about them, you'll need to start making changes.  

So put on your shoes and go for a 30 minute walk.  Walk away from where you live for 15 minutes then turn around and walk home.  It's just that easy.

Then you've made a start.  You can do that again later today or tonight but definitely do it tomorrow.  Then do it again the next day and the next and the next.

Commit to doing it for 30 days and see if you learn something along the way.  Keep a journal so you can measure your progress.

No one is coming to save you.  
You have to save yourself.

okc,fgsju6p,t3_ezy8vi,1581086149.0,"To stay weather aware - it's all about the apps.

For weather and forecasting I use the iPhone Weather app and Mesonet.  Both are decent about predicting weather conditions but sometimes they don't update fast enough for my liking but I think that's because of where the info is generated (the NWS in Norman).

For current conditions, I use AeroWeather and I bought the pro edition.  I have all the local airports plugged in (Wiley Post, WR, Enid, Max Westheimer, Tinker, Guthrie)  These give a good overall picture of what's going on around the city right now.

Then when storms move in, I have 2 radar apps.  Radar Scope (which I had to pay for) and Hi-Def Radar.  Both have good features and I sometimes switch between them but both pretty much do the same things.  It's nice to have 2 because sometimes one of them seems to have ""dirty data"" which means there's all sorts of clutter on the radar.  

What I really like about the radar apps is you can switch to velocity mode which when there's a tornado, will show you exactly where the rotation is.  That's pretty cool....unless its right over where you are.

If you want, you can also buy weather radio.  There are all different kinds with all different features.  Some have an alarm that will sound when dangerous warnings are issued - which is great if you're busy and not paying attention.  [Here's one but there are many others](https://www.amazon.com/Midland-WR120B-WR120EZ-Certified-Trilingual/dp/B00176T9OY/ref=sr_1_3?keywords=weather+radio&qid=1581086043&sr=8-3) and they all play the recorded weather radio broadcast.

technology,fgjnwvg,t3_eyttmf,1580847911.0,"The problem is not ""techno optimism"" nor is it ""technology being used on problems that don't exist"", as the article claims.  

The problem is with the implementation.

[In this article](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/y3m33x/heres-the-shadow-inc-app-that-failed-in-iowa-last-night) it says ""The app was rushed."" which is so common in software development as to be comical at this point.  

It also says the developer pushed an update just 2 days prior to the election.

The article goes on to say:  
> You don’t deliver an app days before the event and call it good. Not with this much riding on this,"" Miller said. ""In a system, in a world where we are questioning every aspect of elections and whether they can be trusted, why would you do anything to fuel a disinformation attack, and that’s exactly what the Democrats have done. They’ve opened a can of whupass on themselves.""

Which seems pretty accurate.

Technology isn't the problem - it's the implementation.

So be sure to check out the [Open Source Election Software project known as ElectOS](https://electos.org).

Open source means people can download and review the source code themselves.  This helps build in trust because everything is known and vulnerabilities will be detailed by the community.  

Open source software is also safer because when new exploits are discovered in any technology, they're often addressed by open source communities much faster than larger organizations.

Now for the rest of the population, you're not ever required to sell to GS.  There are alternatives.  Now there are not always alternatives in every city.  GS may be the only store buying used games in town.  But we're all connected to the internet and everyone knows about Amazon and eBay so you do have alternative places to sell your game.  So they aren't a monopoly because you have options.

Now about pricing.  This is a VERY complicated issue that most people have never even considered.  We go into a store, we see a price and we think ""that's the price of the item"" but never realize that price is set by any number of factors and it changes all the time.  Why don't we realize this?  Because we're not around to see it change.  We buy our shit and leave the store and never see when items change price.  The only real glimpse we see of this is when we see something go on sale but most people never consider how that happens.

Like I said - pricing is a very complicated issue and I'm not about to get into a discussion about price setting and things like that.  Go study marketing, economics, and business if you want to know more about those things.

But the bottom line is this, if you don't like a price, don't sell it for that price and seek alternatives.  If you can't get the price you want, then your price is too high for the market.  Guess what - that's normal.  If ANY STORE, including GameStop tries to sell something for too high of a price, people don't buy it.  Then what?  It'll sit on the shelf long enough for the store to lower the price.  

Now the main thing in all of this is to not confuse YOUR buying decisions, YOUR desired price, for the price the market will pay.  There are millions of other people in the market and your buying/selling decisions are only one data point.  

So when I'm saying that GS has priced something too high, I'm not meaning for you.  I'm meaning for the market.  

So it's real simple - if you don't like the price they're offering, don't sell to them and try to find a better price.  If you can't find a better price, then you're stuck either with the game or you'll have to sell for a lower price.  But none of that makes GS a monopoly - those are what are called ""Market Forces"".

By the way - you can dislike this whole explanation but it's essentially what capitalism is all about - if you live in a different country than the USA then you may not understand the above explanation or it may not apply to your situation.  That's cool - what I'm talking about is applicable to the USA and/or capitalistic economies around the world."

So what happened is there was dude causing a lot of trouble around the meeting and one foundation held a meeting and banned him.  He didn't listen and kept coming around.

I wasn't around for all this but in discussing it with a few members, it was agreed that since the foundation had the lease, they could prevent him from entering the property but AA couldn't kick him out since he always said he had a desire to stop drinking.

He apparently keeps coming around but they don't do anything.  He's just bugging the shit out of them and constantly calls them out.

I don't have any idea if he's getting or staying sober.  Sometimes he seems to be but other times he seems blasted at the meetings."

""What game is the OP wanting to play?""

If the OP is wanting to play the ""wealth accumulation game"" then your approach is likely better than mine.  Well sort of - one of the best wealth accumulation professions is sales but not everyone can do that.  And some are off the table due to a variety of constraints.

However if the OP is wanting to play the ""create a better life game"" then I think my approach is more applicable.  Your approach may in fact be part of creating a better life but your approach (solely focusing on wealth generation) is not without consequence and may have far reaching and negative set backs along the way.  Mine is much more applicable to a wider variety of people and it's sustainable.

IMO it's a much better approach trying to build a sustainable life, including work life.  And like I said before, vast sums of money can be made in any area of work.  There are all sorts of examples of this in many different industries."
