XenobladeChroniclesX,fek2f1w,t1_fek1irn,1579191167.0,"You're probably right as them folks that have written stuff for the Simpsons are pretty smart. However, Merriam-Webster puts this as the first definition:

hostile toward a rival or one believed to enjoy an advantage. Envious.

Of course, the third definition being:

vigilant in guarding a possession.

So yeah, envious is the correct term, but I feel as though I can get away with being jealous."

Video of a dog being beaten to death by a shovel.

Cartel stuff

My brother used to watch videos of military people in the middle east. One that stuck out was a gunner on some emplacement gunning people down. Must have been a rather large caliber gun because they were basically mist afterwards.

Saw one where three guys were beating a man. Ended with them stabbing him in the stomach. That one especially messed me up.

Two kids and a sandbox or something like that. Basically a woman very aggressively moving a large object in and out of a guys urethra (is that the word? His shaft.)

There's certainly others that I've seen but can't recall. Or simply would rather not recall."
