Health,fgjdzqo,t1_fgij27o,1580842056.0,I think the same thing happened with SARS. Either that or it was an inappropriate delay in conveying accurate information to the global community.
Health,fgjdsvx,t1_fgj5omo,1580841943.0,"I think it's too early to definitively tell, and restricted information coming out of China isn't helping, but if you have access to decent healthcare and go to the doctor if you've been exposed and start having symptoms, you should be able to recover (assuming you don't have any pre-existing medical conditions). Unlike the seasonal flu strains where we have vaccines that can help prevent serious complications from contracting them, there are currently no vaccines for this strain of coronavirus. So, if you do contract it, you would get it full-force as opposed to if you had the vaccine. The result would be very much dependent on the individual. Another issue is timing. This is happening at the same time as a double-barreled flu season, so it is possible to get flu strains A, B, and this new one all in one flu season. If your body is already weakened by fighting the current seasonal flu strains, getting this new one can provide for a dangerous situation. If you are in a medical situation where you can't get certain vaccines (immuno-compromised or an infant), it would be a reason for concern. Personally, I am more concerned about the seasonal flu strains circulating than this, although I did get my flu shot this year. The level of awareness and response (at least in Massachusetts) for the novel coronavirus seems to be taken much more seriously than the more common seasonal flu that most people here would be at risk for at the moment, which is upsetting on a completely different level."

dogs,fggvam7,t1_fgesqol,1580770357.0,"I think she was worried the woman would hide him if she knew my friend was on to her. He was a Min Pin, so stashing him somewhere else would’ve been easy.  That is a good idea about the medication tag, especially for smaller dogs that people would take as a pet for themselves. My main concern with my pup is about people who would steal my pup to use as a bait dog. Bait dogs don’t last long, so that probably won’t deter them in this case. I did feel some relief when I had him neutered. At least no one would take him if their motives were to try and breed him, so that helped in that sense!"
dogs,fgguy5j,t1_fgeq6ks,1580770137.0,"I had been using Whistle. The only problem I have with it is that it doesn’t help with areas that don’t have AT&T coverage. Unfortunately, there are still areas near us that have spotty service. We’re looking into GPS devices normally suited for hunting dogs for when we go on hikes or venture into some State Parks where coverage is less than ideal, but most that fit our needs for that cost between $499 and $899, which I can’t justify spending at this point in time for the amount we would actually use it. The whistle is good for when he is let out in the yard and going on walks. If something ever happens where he gets away (only has happened once when we found out he knows how to open gates) I can at least track him quickly and know where or in which direction he went. He is not a bolter, but he has no street smarts or general sense of direction, so having that extra security is huge."

rawpetfood,fgdvw4g,t3_exucdc,1580687491.0,"It can also depend on your dogs activity level and required volume/weight of daily food. Smaller dogs usually need to be fed more often, but many larger deep-chested dogs can run the risk of bloat if eating too much too fast or in one sitting. My dog (boxer) eats 3lb raw per day. There is no way he can eat that much in one sitting, even two sittings can be pushing it, so we feed 3x day. On most weekdays, he gets breakfast around 6am, lunch when we get home at 4pm, and then dinner around 8pm. Most of his pooping happens in the morning. But usually he poops about 5 times per day. Even when we tried to cut back to feeding twice a day, he still had to poop 5 times a day on average. Keep in mind, this is raw feeding. 

Fresh pet is not raw, so you may not be feeding as much in volume or weight compared to feeding raw. I’ve heard of plenty of dogs doing just fine on one meal per day. Unfortunately mine is just not one of them."

Losing my pup or having him stolen is quite possibly my greatest fear. I have his microchip company and number written everywhere including on his ID tag and a matching wallet card in my wallet, on file at my office and at home, and I check it once a year to make sure it’s still correct and active. Also have the vet scan it once a year to make sure it’s still working. I’m a little nutty when it comes to my pup. I also got him a GPS tracker just in case. Okay, a lot nutty."

rawpetfood,fg4t0ac,t1_fg30d7e,1580510455.0,"Thanks for this! So here’s my advice. I am not a vet, so I can only advise through my own experience and what I’ve learned from our veterinary nutritionist over the years. 

My only concern with switching to raw straight away is the health of her gut. You may want to do a few weeks of adding a probiotic/prebiotic/digestive enzymes to her normal food to ensure she would be able to neutralize any pathogens that can naturally occur with feeding raw. If she’s still good after that, then slowly introducing commercially prepared raw would be a great start to ensure your puppy has all the nutrients she needs to kick off her healthy transition. The last thing you want to do is make her worse from a vitamin or nutrient deficiency.

Deep freezing any grocery-store raw meat for two weeks will also help when/if you do decide it’s time to go all in on homemade. It can help kill some bad bacteria that is found in normal raw. If she doesn’t have any food allergies, she shouldn’t have any issue with what proteins are given to her. Maybe aim towards leaner meats and away from fatty ones like lamb until she’s had a long stretch of no GI issues. Continue supplementing with the probiotics if you think they are helping. 

One thing that I give my boy to help with his sensitive stomach is ginger. Raw ginger root peeled and minced (start with 1/8 teaspoon daily) can help immensely with overall upset tummy, particularly related to gas. A good thing to have on hand is Slippery Elm Bark. If you google it, you’ll find lots of info on it. It’s one of my pantry staples I keep on hand in case GI inflammation every rears it’s ugly head. 

Try to find a veterinary nutritionist or at the very least, a vet that has experience with patients who eat raw. Dogs Naturally Magazine is also a great resource for new raw feeders, as well as papers and articles from the American Holistic Veterinary Medical Association. There are also a number of books out there and other resources a few others mentioned on this post.

I hope this helps a little and the Giardia disappears from your neighborhood!"
SalemMA,fg2lub5,t1_fg29zd0,1580447641.0,"I used to enjoy taking the train. I drive from Salem every day now. It takes me on average less time to drive than to take the train — granted, I work in Cambridge so I transfer to the shuttle once at North Station. But still, the commuter rail is supposed to be way quicker. Don’t forget about the time when a train-car just randomly detached from the rest of the moving train a few years ago!"
rawpetfood,fg2ktkr,t3_ew7oq0,1580446999.0,"Is there a reason they put her on hydrolyzed? If it was simply a bad Giardia infection, then why go on hydrolyzed protein? Did they suspect IBD? It’s common for dogs to have food sensitivities but actually rare for them to have legitimate whole food allergies, especially being so young. I’m happy to offer some advice but I just need clarification on the details of her situation. 

We raised our puppy on raw as he was weaned onto it by his breeder who also fed raw to his Mom. But our vet is also a nutritionist, so we have a very lucky situation where we were able to have professional guidance with regard to proper portions and recipes when making our homemade raw. You can always try and see if a vet that specializes in nutrition happens to practice in your area. They aren’t common, but they are out there!

I also second the commercial raw approach if you can’t locate a nutritionist, at least until she is a little older."

rawpetfood,ffuve52,t3_ev9uml,1580250062.0,"It depends on where you live and what you can source near you. It also depends on the size of the animal being fed. A 10 pound dog eats a lot less than a 100 pound dog. Some people are lucky enough to live in areas where the majority of ingredients are available and plentiful. For us, raw is exponentially more expensive. We have a boxer. Nothing near us has properly diverse organ meat, so we mail order in about 40lbs every few months from Hare Today Gone Tomorrow. Muscle meat can be sourced in bulk at places like Costco but we do catch sales at Market Basket (MA) which save us some money on boneless meat. Our biggest savings is ordering in bulk RMBs from our local butcher. Things like chicken necks, backs, ribcages, etc. run at Max about $1 per pound. These parts are not in high demand for the general public so they are much less pricey than wings. We buy tins of sardines and canned pumpkin in bulk from Amazon, and eggs/fresh veggies by themselves are cheap enough to get at the store or farmstand. This doesn’t include our pup’s supplements which are fed by choice so I really can’t complain about their cost (you don’t need much supplementation if you are feeding raw correctly, but there are certain things that may be worth adding if you feel the need). 

Our dog is 80lbs and eats about 3lbs per day. Buying in bulk means you need a lot of freezer space. We have 2 small chest freezers we use for dog food ingredients because when there is a sale on something at the same time as picking up 40lbs of RMBs and getting a delivery order of 40lbs of organ meat, a regular fridge/freezer combo simply won’t suffice.

That said, I do believe it is worth it if you can find cost savings wherever possible. Our vet who is also a nutritionist believes it is worth it as long as you can financially do it without sacrificing other needs that cost money —like medical care. I would completely understand if someone could not manage the cost, deal with the time consumption, find professional guidance, and have the amenities to do homemade raw for their dog (especially a large one). But if you can manage it, and presuming your pet doesn’t have any medical issues preventing them from eating it, you’ll never want to go back to kibble or canned."

rawpetfood,ffazfmu,t3_esk7ep,1579748055.0,"Ask your vet about homemade raw. For a cat, it shouldn’t be too expensive, and your vet can help make sure what you are making is balanced and nutritionally comprehensive. It may not turn out to be something that works for you or kitty, but it may be worth a shot, especially if you have a picky eater.

EDIT: You can also see if more interesting proteins are what your kitty is looking for. Mail order proteins can be an option. I order from Hare Today Gone Tomorrow for our dog’s more elusive ingredients and they have many options that may be more appealing to finicky felines: cavies, rabbit, mice, quail, etc."

At least in the US, we never hear about these kinds of stories. It’s absolutely crucial to know what not to look for in a breeder. It educates potential owners so they can avoid puppy mills and backyard breeders. However, rarely are we told what determines a great or even an exceptionally excellent one."
