unpopularopinion,ffn5olg,t1_ffm5mro,1580062280.0,"I was recently out at a high-end steakhouse (a meal for 2 would easily be over $100 without drinks, that type of high end) and our dinner was ruined by not 1, but 2 parties with screaming infants. One group asked for the bill and left promptly (thank you!) The other...


The other mother kept walking throughout the different rooms of seating while bouncing her little bundle of shrieking terror. Everyone was subjected to this shrieking for at least 30 minutes  while risking it throwing up on random diners as she wandered aimlessly through tables. It could have been longer, I made my apologies to my mother and uncle and took a cab home. I left my food unfinished, told the hostess exactly why I was leaving, and the restaurant took my meal off the bill. Why? Because they fucked up by letting a screaming infant ruin dinner service for literally dozens of other parties. I can only hope they made the parents of the demon pay for all the meals they ruined.


Children who cannot listen to and understand rules of public behaviour have no business a restaurant. You cannot express to an 8 month old that other people are trying to enjoy a romantic atmosphere and to settle down and behave. So they shouldn't be in that environment at all."

I need to know desperately what happened to her, but I never will, because that's the point. The system doesn't care what happens to people after. They're gone and that's that. 

I literally stopped watching for a few days and went searching online hoping we might get some follow up to her story."

“As long as someone takes responsibility for what they said, and addresses the fact that in 2019 some things that may have been said in the past are inappropriate today, that if anything they’ve ever said in the past caused any type of hurt or disrespect to any one community or another and have apologized for that, I accept that."" - Andrew Sheer, Leader of the Conservative Party in 2019. 

The only double standard is conservatives refusing to accept his sincere apology. Next time you make a claim try and have some sources lol

books,fegzjr1,t3_ep416i,1579105997.0,"Growing up we had family friends who had 2 kids, a son and a daughter. The son was super outgoing and athletic and wanted to play all the time. As punishment he would be sent to his room: no toys, no friends,  no tv, only books to distract him. He hated it. He would come out an hour later to apologise and ask forgiveness. This punishment never worked on their daughter who loved to read. Sending her to her room wasn't punishment, it was a reward! Hours of uninterrupted reading. So they started sending her to the laundry room (no books, no tv, no toys). Almost overnight she stopped misbehaving. There is no one-size-fits-all punishment for children. Taking away books can be an effective punishment to prompt a change in behaviour."

Unfortunately it was most likely stolen valour. If he's worried about forgetting his DnD ID, which every vet I know (military spouse myself) carries with them at all times, why wouldn't he be worried about forgetting the free-admission card? That is much less likely to be with him at any given moment.

AmItheAsshole,fcw811e,t3_eizcvf,1578019262.0,"NTA. You have a job. You have bills to pay. You have skills and other plans for that time which would have earned you $60/hour. They chose to have children. They chose to have 3. They chose to give up their ""adult only"" time when they made their decision to have a child, let alone the second and third. They can look after their own kids, find a teenager who will accept a rate they like (who they won't trust as much, that's why the cost is less), or accept the rate of the person they want to babysit their children. You didn't ask to babysit, they asked you. They can meet your terms or they can look after their own children."
