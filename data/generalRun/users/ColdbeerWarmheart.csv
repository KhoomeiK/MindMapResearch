They were gone a week and the person they left in charge sold their two dogs on nextdoor in the first day. Lead them on all week about how good the dogs had been and then ghosted them after dropping the bomb.

The other is still unaccounted for. But he is chipped so fingers crossed.

Otherwise, their biographies are usually fabricated. It's all social engineering.

But I will also say that I have encountered this mentality from people while I was homeless. I've been told some pretty f'd up racist and classist things by people operating shelters and food pantries.

Not everyone is born with the same opportunities and it isn't exclusive to race. It is predominantly a class struggle issue.

Unfortunately, the folks in charge of this country celebrate such a gross generalization. 

If they make it about race, people might just forget that poor is poor. And unless you win a random genetic lottery that places you closer to the finish line at birth; you will always be playing catch up.

Even if you did catch up, those people won't accept you because you didn't come from the same place as them.

Sorry for the mini-rant, folks. But this mentality strikes a nerve with me on such a deep personal level."
sanantonio,feecr77,t1_fedpihv,1579031075.0,"I somewhat share your opinion. SA is a tough scene and full of cliques and gatekeepers.

I really tried myself, and I'm a local who understands the comedic mentality here. It's downright soul-crushing in an industry that's already pretty soul-crushing.

 Those that have a footload in the scene are very reluctant, if not downright refusing, to give a hand to help others up the hillside. 

Hard to have a decent community when people are actively unsupportive. Even as far as comedians go, some of the people here are outright dicks. 

Such a shame, but typical of just about everything here that isn't sports or drinking at fiesta."

- Just up the freeway from there is a restaurant called Magic Time Machine. They have a small comedy club after hours in the cellar.

- There are tons of bars and clubs in town that do open mics and some include standup.

Check out SA Current newspaper. They have a calendar that lists a bunch of them.

There is a pretty good standup community here. It is just very small and tight knit. Which is fine, but can be intimidating. If you're used to the standup life, that may or may not put you off."

sanantonio,feeasts,t1_fee6yfi,1579029933.0,"It's not just quality. But also consistency of service.

Many times I've ordered from there and gotten burgers that were half frozen or stale fries. Sometimes with items missing. That's always a risk with fast food. But consistency and service are also key aspects of the industry. And possibly some of the easiest things for management to adjust. 

So really, there's no excuse, imho. Especially when your company is making record profits.

WB may be one of the lesser offenders here, but it happens often enough in my personal experience for it to be a noticable change.

iamatotalpieceofshit,fee92y9,t1_fee4ha5,1579028925.0,"I absolutely feel your frustration and I empathize with you.

My cousin, who has been a teacher for ~15 years, stepped away from being in the classroom full-time because she was reaching a breaking point.

She didn't give up, but took a higher level position in the district. Now she travels between schools, sourcing and providing progressive teaching modules that push boundaries while still conforming to the state curriculum.

 (I should say ""progressive"" in that students might actually learn something through practical application of their studies; which is important in mental development, and sadly lacking in today's curriculums.)

She also provides affordable teaching supplies to teachers who can't afford them for their students. (Yes folks! Teachers must purchase their own supplies and modules out of pocket for their students. Most districts do **not** provide these things to educators.) 

Every year, she receives community donations and spends untold amounts of her own personal money to accomplish this.

She is working hard to combat the epidemic from within the system. And she absolutely receives pushback from scrupulous administrators and sometimes, even other teachers.

I should mention we're in Texas, so it's an uphill battle here. Which is crucial in education reform,  since Texas and (to a lesser extent California) dictate much of the curriculum for the rest of the United States.

This is one of the myriad of reasons I did not become an educator myself. Seeing what it has done to the educators in my family. So yeah, I totally feel your pain."

Tbh, this is a trend I've seen over last few years with most of the SA *staple* restaurants. (TC, Bill Millers, even Whataburger.)

And most of those places are as popular as ever! Especially with new arrivals to the city. You would think these restaurants would use their windfall to up their game and the quality of their products. Pay it forward to their customers who made them what they are.

Nope, they cut corners, raise prices, and lower portion sizes surreptitiously to increase profits."

iamatotalpieceofshit,fee39fx,t1_fedfjk1,1579025490.0,"I come from a family of educators, so I see cases like this being discussed quite often. So I'll take a crack at answering your question.

Because our broken judicial system has made it so schools are afraid of litigious parents who will sue if a teacher so much as looks at a student the wrong way.

This is why schools now have 'zero tolerance' policies. Where both students are punished, regardless of the situation. Thankfully, that didn't happen in this case. But it does in many,  many others.

Add to that, fundamentalists working within or government to gut the public education system. Forcing schools to cowtow to these parents in order to keep people in the district and receive greater funding.

So now you have teachers, which let's be honest is a thankless and brutal job these days, losing all their passion for education and their students. Good teachers (and administrators) leave, or are forced out. They are replaced with complacent and apathetic teachers and administrators who just teach to the state run guidelines of their districts. 

Just trying to get students educated enough to be interested in something other than dank memes. Sweating it out, trying to reach retirement before burning out. Once again, to achieve a pittance of funding.


I could go on, but this is long enough already. The point is, this case is just a symptom of a layered, complex and systemic  failure of our current education system.

 A failure that is actively being orchestrated by a fundamintalist ruling class that wants to ensure the masses are undereducated and exploitable.

Its easy to blame teachers and administrators for these problems. But they are just pawns in a greater scheme. Sure, some of them are complicit. But many of them don't have a choice."
