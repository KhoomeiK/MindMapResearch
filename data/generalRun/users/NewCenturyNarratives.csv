EngineeringStudents,ffg4i4g,t1_ffg3btr,1579898280.0,"Like I said, my plan was to wait until I waz 25 to go back to school. When my son was born it was, for lack of a better term, and complete shitshow. I had to do what I could for work ASAP. I found a decent paying job when my wife was pregnant but left after extensive work bullying. Then,I worked as a photographer for a company that flew me out to the Midwest every weekend, but then child care became too expensive. After that I couldn't find anything stable in the videography business in my area."

EngineeringStudents,ffeyynu,t3_et62o1,1579870869.0,"I tried to post a picture here, but it didn't work. Basically I've begun drip-feeding community college classes. Historically I've been mediocre/bad at Algebra 2, so that has been my main focus. I got an A in that last semester, and now I'm on to Trig and Pre-Calc. Sadly I can't do school every semester, so my hope is to at least self-study ahead enough that I'll be mathematically competent by the time I have to do Physics classes.

The main reason I've focused in on materials is that most devices built for invasive BCI fail at the materials level. So much effort goes into cutting edge chip design only to have it fail a month in due to materials mismatch between a metal interface and biological material. Once that problem is solved the world really opens up for EECS and neural engineering to truly be useful in this space.

Right now I have to decide whether to just go to school and get a job, or go for gold and be okay with finishing a PhD at 40. I don't think I can get a job in neural engineering or biomaterials with just an undergrad degree"

* 27. Married. One kid. In community college. I live across the street from CU Boulder. The problem is they don't have a Materials undergrad program, so I have to choose between Physics, Chem, Comp-Sci, etc.

Most of the papers I've read span a whole lot of disciplines, but the three that I've noticed are the Neural Dust/Mote projects (Berkeley and Cornell), flexible and stretchable circuits for bio-interface (Prof. John Rogers at Northwestern), and Polymer interfaces (Melosh Group and Anikeeva Group).
* I am personally more inclined to doing math and physics problems. At least I can sit in a place with sunlight and coffee. Labs sometimes stress me out.
