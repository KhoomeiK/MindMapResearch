Advice,fe5v21w,t3_enjhwg,1578875597.0,"A lot of people are going to comment with information about the psychology or the emotional aspect of your situation, but ultimately, in my opinion, this comes down to energy. 
When someone yells at you, they are ""attacking"" you with a negative energy that your ""aura if you will"" will naturally absorb. You will then feel an urge to release this extra negative energy, as it is superfluous. Most people satisfy this urge by yelling back, or being physical such as punching a wall (or even another person). This is how escalation can quickly turn into a verbal or even physical fight.
People who have a natural tendency to avoid aggressive behavior may release this energy by crying instead. That's perfectly normal and reasonable, and frankly much healthier than throwing fists.
It's the same idea as when you laugh. Things are often ""funny"" to you because your brain has a natural tendency to guess what is going to happen based on experience (it will naturally send neutral impulses through strongly built neural connections, such as those associated with the things you see every day). For example, you see someone start to descend down a stairwell. You see this happen every day, with the result being that they successfully reach the bottom and continue. So, your brain goes ""oh I know what's going to happen there"" and begins creating and sending neural signals down the strongly reinforced ""go down the stairs and reach the bottom without issue"" neural pathway that it knows so well. 
But the person doesn't reach the bottom successfully this time. Instead, they trip and end up falling down on their bum and bouncing the rest of the way.
Well, your brain has already started that anticipatory signal. That electricity is already there. So now you need to get rid of it. Did it startle you? You gasp or exclaim. Did it amuse you? You laugh. The reason this happens involuntarily is because you have extra energy that just has to come out somehow.
I firmly believe in a person's ability to transfer energy from one ""aura"" (for lack of a better scientific word) to another, and yelling is a way of doing this. When there's too much energy you just have to get rid of some. You don't want to yell back or punch a wall, so you cry.
That's all.
Nothing to be worried or embarrassed about.
It's just energy."

Advice,fdaqh6s,t3_ekagek,1578248947.0,"I think she needs to be involuntarily committed to a psychiatric hospital. Her parents should be able to authorize this. This behavior is a form of manipulation for attention and control, and is indicative of severe mental instability. She can easily be considered a danger to herself, so her parents should have the authority to have her committed, at least for a 72 hour evaluation. While she is there she should not be able to harm herself, and she will also no longer have any power over you anymore. Good luck friend."

I would definitely recommend honing in on the birth stone theme tips, as well as the supposed Canadian origins. See if anyone who has a version of the toy can provide brand name or any other useful information about where/when they got theirs. Good luck!"
