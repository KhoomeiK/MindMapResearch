aww,ffgmj6m,t1_ffgkuog,1579909699.0,"Lol a familiar thought process. Unfortunately my pets would have no chance outside, if I had to choose I would of course also open the door, I mean that still beats to rot in here, but euthanasia would probably be more merciful (already totally in an apocalypse scenario xD). Well.. I try to avoid thinking about it too much. I guess dying just isn't an option"

aww,ffg9k4s,t3_et8fmy,1579901393.0,My pets are literally the only reason I still give a shit about my career
FearTheWalkingDead,ff6i7k7,t1_ff4n1h2,1579627746.0,"Even if it isn't a bait, I hate this. I don't care for seeing them all coming together, the shows were good apart (at least fear was until season 3), this is just an attempt to get some viewers back, without having to think up a good story. Just like the whole morgan cross over, they had run out of ideas and this is a cheap way to have content"

I know many love II and hate 3D, but 3D was very entertaining, II just didnt do it for me, found it boring. Not really sure why, maybe because it wasn't really into the whole story yet"
ElderScrollsBlades,fen8mlm,t3_epyslf,1579279362.0,"Tbh I really loved this game, but I'm so tired of pve and pvp. It's too bland. I like quests, something with content, which would have some sense. Just pvp this way is too boring for me. I haven't played in a month or so"
