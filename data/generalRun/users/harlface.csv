If something can literally say ""please don't eat me, please, I don't want to die."" Then I think the majority wouldn't eat them.

If though, say chickens were all annoying as fuck and only talked in racist slurs and shit then yeah I'd still eat them.

Music,feco3dl,t1_fecn7co,1578978818.0,"Right, so you're saying one person is allowed a persona but another isn't? How do you know this singer isn't a feminist?

I don't mean to offend so I apologize if you got offended by any of my previous comments but - having heard a small amount of Tyler and a small amount of Negative XP, I can see why anyone who just heard one song and wasn't familiar with the artist on the whole could see either as a misogynistic. 

I'm not talking about your personal opinion of Tyler the creator, I'm highlighting your hypocrisy in supporting one artist using slurs and making content which is CLEARLY going to offend people, but slamming another doing the same. 

Unfortunately when it comes to moral debate the lines aren't clearly drawn."

I mean the song is LITERALLY called Scott Pilgrim VS the World ruined an entire generation of women, what am I missing?

I appreciate this is a sensitive topic for some people, but I thought the radical nature of my comment showed that it wasn't serious.

As a sidenote, it's funny that my ""triggered"" comment actually did trigger a few people. If that sets you off, good luck living a balanced life in the world today."

sex,fe6m3yp,t3_eo033i,1578895549.0,"First of all, this sucks. Guy sounds like a bit of a douche... Specifically in terms of (from what I understand by reading) you seeing someone else and telling him, and him keep his budding romance quiet for 5 months. 
I'd be interested to know if he told this other girl about you over those five months.

You got any family you can get in touch with? In a non sexual way (obviously), you might find a cuddle there.

I'd also recommend the gym and some light weight training. Nothing has helped me more than this when I feel shitty. 

Not only will you get guys looking at, which might help, but you'll also feel strong physically, which should help you feel strong mentally. Plus an orgasm after a workout is the tits.

What I would avoid is jumping into bed with someone right away, you don't want to get fucked and chucked."
