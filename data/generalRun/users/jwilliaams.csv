Advice,fdskgmm,t1_fdsja1w,1578704312.0,xD youâ€™re right I should have posted a photo hehe still kinda new with reddit only started posting recently. I will add a link. And yes I normally talk to the hair stylist I normally go to but once Iâ€™m there it means for sure Iâ€™ll be getting a haircut[hair](https://imgur.com/aDKmDwS)
Advice,fdsjmg6,t3_emzy0a,1578703977.0,"For me personally I really donâ€™t like last minute plans or plans that arnt really thought our properly especially if you have to pay and for this trip itâ€™s quite a bit of money.
It if was me I wouldnâ€™t go. I say no a lot now to things I donâ€™t want to go to because when I go Iâ€™m just grumpy and get upset that I put in xyz amount of money (Iâ€™m in school and work casually so not much income). Also Iâ€™m kind of annoyed how your friend didnâ€™t ask or tell you about the cheaper tickets? And for me when I say no to things my friends will be sad maybe but they donâ€™t get mad. So if you choose to not go they shouldnâ€™t get mad at you esp since the trip is pretty costly and for you you can use that money for a better planned trip maybe plan the next one :)"
GirlGamers,fdshzmv,t1_fdshadu,1578703108.0,Ah yes thatâ€™s true xD
GirlGamers,fdsgn2h,t3_emv6p8,1578702355.0,Thatâ€™s awesome! Was just wondering if that were to happen but you didnâ€™t know your friends address what would you do if you called authorities would they be able to track them down someone to notify someone to help? :/

Twitch,fdqeamz,t1_fdoy3nh,1578664415.0,Yeah thatâ€™s definitely frustrating. What did they say the first time you called? Let us know how it goes
Twitch,fdoxesv,t3_emi4gs,1578615069.0,"Hey! I have 300down and 10upload and I did all the trouble shooting steps- restarting modem, computer etc. It didnâ€™t help. Then instead of live streaming I clicked record to see if Iâ€™m getting dropped frames even without streaming to make sure itâ€™s not my equipment and it wasnâ€™t. I called my internet provider and they did a few tests. Turns out thereâ€™s â€œupload noiseâ€ in my area affecting everyone and someone from the internet provider company has to come out to fix it. Try calling your internet provider :)"
Twitch,fdox618,t1_fdowc37,1578614908.0,I agree with this as well. Most of the time people come in your chat to get a reaction from you so I normally just ignore and they go away. Also Iâ€™m not sure if the option is still there but a while back on twitch you can set it so if people post certain words itâ€™s instant timeout/ban
Twitch,fdox1l3,t1_fdovi6i,1578614828.0,I agree. When I first started streaming I had a bunch of toxic people coming in chat and I have awesome mods that just banned while I was gaming!
Twitch,fdowffo,t3_emcp0s,1578614422.0,Thanks for sharing! Iâ€™m going to try the discord method :)

GirlGamers,fdo5xr1,t3_emdpwj,1578599469.0,I love the pink and purple! Where did you purchase this? o:
GirlGamers,fdo149v,t1_fdnmpks,1578596958.0,I read a lot of reviews before I bought it and a lot of people were saying itâ€™s super hard and uncomfortable for you bum but I donâ€™t agree with that. The cushion is firm but not hard where itâ€™s uncomfortable for me. I like this chair because it fits my size I got the throne. My last chair I had the Corsair t1 gaming chair I felt it was uncomfortable because it was too big for me. Also the lumbar cushion for this chair is really nice itâ€™s memory foam which also helps to make it comfortable :)
GirlGamers,fdnf54m,t1_fdnazs0,1578584482.0,Iâ€™m using a yoga strap right now and wrap it around my back to help correct posture because it pulls back my shoulders more. I find it better than this back race I bought from amazon. My friend also suggested to do core workouts and said that contributes to back pain as well having a weak core
GirlGamers,fdna7q4,t1_fdn4utp,1578581341.0,I like it a lot. I have difficulty with the lumbar pillow too but I like how you can freely move it and adjust where you want it. I still have back pain but itâ€™s because I have really bad back posture Iâ€™m trying to correct :(
AskReddit,fdmi23x,t3_elzbiv,1578550652.0,Nice to look at but not so much shovelling

GirlGamers,fdenz4a,t3_ek28cn,1578343020.0,I had a Corsair t1 gaming chair but gave it to my brother because it wasnâ€™t comfortable I think the chair was too big for me. I ended up buying a throne secretlab chair and I love it. I got the soft l weave fabric so it would last longer.. There was a sale over Christmas so I got $30 off and free shipping. I have a code for $25 off from purchasing the chair let me know if you want it I canâ€™t send you the code. The chair is over $200 though but look into it itâ€™s a good investment.
GirlGamers,fcj8542,t3_cpt8rd,1577679685.0,"Hey, thanks for responding!! I got the throne :) it should be arriving today. I had the Corsair t1 gaming chair and the lumbar pillow looked similar so I thought that not only the chair but the pillow would be too big for my size for it to be comfortable so I went with the throne. A lot of people suggested the omega because thereâ€™s more space to cross your legs etc but I donâ€™t do that often plus Iâ€™m trying to work on my posture because I have back pain. I hope I will like the chair ðŸ˜­"
GirlGamers,fc5e2pr,t1_ews1072,1577454813.0,Iâ€™m 5â€™4 140lbs and Iâ€™m trying to decide between the omega and throne (these two were recommended sizes) then I sent a msg on twitter and they suggested the omega. What made you decide the throne over the omega?
Markham,fbtg5av,t3_ed43ha,1577077708.0,:( I hope you find out the person who did this. Maybe you can ask a few people at the parking lot if they seen anything that day
