Sure - maybe. Depends on how it plays out, but many of the other territories wanted to strike out on their own. Just because that's the direction they wanted to go doesn't necessarily mean it was the best decision.

You have to realize that at the time corruption was endemic, much more so than it is nowadays. If the outlying areas could profit by letting the Burmese come rampaging through, that's what they did. They had much more to lose by trying to campaign against a larger army that was attacking what many saw as their main competition."

True, but expecting the defendant to extend that to having ""operational control"" and having intent is a whole 'nother step that I have doubts could be proved."

It's great you wanna be one of the guys.

Realize that you're surrounded by over 100 years of collective experience. You've been an apprentice for a week. Tone it down a notch or you're gonna be out of a job."

That plays a lot into the political infighting. The vassal states had a lot to gain by the downfall of Ayutthaya, as seen by the fallout when the Burmese left. All of those other territories became governed by warlords, rogue monks, barons, etc."

Combine that with a siege that lasted over a year - the city was literally starved to death. No matter how well fortified and armed the city was, after 14 months of starvation morale would be in the basement, and those that were still willing to fight were very much unable due to starvation and dehydration."
