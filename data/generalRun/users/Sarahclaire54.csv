I speak as a professor of design and typography. I found the sign riveting and yes, unusual, but loved it once I knew what it said."

aww,fcapuzw,t3_egmwgp,1577574197.0,My mother would tell the story of me as a baby staring and pointing at paintings. It turned out that I have a 1 in a thousand talent/ innate sense of color and am a working artist now in my adult life. Treat him well and let him do art!!
philosophy,fcal82f,t1_fcaj7w7,1577571428.0,"I agree with you. Furthermore, i would hesitate to be telling women, once again, to deny their internal precautionary senses and disbelieve themselves again. 

The article has some interesting notes to heed regarding biases and prejudices, but the sense 'creepy' is very specific and more than just a coping judgement to shut down our inquisitiveness, as the author suggests. It can operate in exactly the opposite way as well. Mothers will draw their children more closely if a 'creepy' man comes too close, etc.

Animals probably sense 'creepy' people; hunters, bullies, etc."
