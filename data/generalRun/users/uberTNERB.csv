LandlordLove,ffsafkn,t3_euxw7y,1580177051.0,The management company that oversees my apartment complex does the same. My place is just a 30 second walk to the leasing office. They’ve recently launched an app that does absolutely nothing except process online payments — for an added fee. I get an email every 3-4 days encouraging me to download it. #kissmyass

WhitePeopleTwitter,ffh2yxd,t3_etjzyt,1579921702.0,"I worked in a small office complex tucked into an older suburb of Saint Louis once upon a time – one of those buildings that leases space to any number of small companies from CPAs to tailors to PC repair guys and, in my case, ad reps for an agency back in Dallas that didn’t want to pay big rent in case our new client dropped us right away. (It happens a lot.) Anyway, the landlady was this ancient little 80+ year-old thing who kept her own office on the top floor in what can only be described as a giant janitor’s closet. A desk, squeaky rolling chair, half a dozen broken and just as many working vacuums, buckets and mops everywhere, fluorescent light tubes stacked in the corner and so on. She might have even had a rollaway bed up there. We rarely ever saw her outside her closet-office other than once every few months, as major holiday seasons changed, she and a maintenance guy in his 60s or early 70s would emerge into the daylight and proceed to yank all the landscaping around the perimeter of the building out of the ground, replacing every bit of it with something different. And very fake. Every little tree, decorative shrub and flower was 100% artificial and color-coordinated to the upcoming festivities. Pink and red for Valentine’s; bright pastels for Easter; red, white and blue for the summer; autumn colors for Halloween and Thanksgiving; red, green, gold and silver for Christmas… You get the idea. It took them 3-4 days to do it each time. Then she’d disappear again. Haven’t thought about her in 15 years. Hope she’s still around, grand and gaudy as ever. Making her patch of the world beautiful."

todayilearned,ffg5af2,t1_ffg4m0e,1579898761.0,"Unilever isn’t a consumer brand. It’s a holding company. And Ben & Jerry’s is, in fact, a big player. But what is its mission? Meaning, how does it distinguish itself from the competition in terms of social or corporate responsibility? It may have had a defining mission at some point, but I think it faded along the way. Probably about the time it was acquired by Unilever. 

That said, I wasn’t dissing big corporations or big brands. I was simply arguing that the metric for company growth mentioned in the TIL was poorly defined and could likely be misleading."

todayilearned,ffg2iql,t3_etb2nv,1579897055.0,"Mission-driven brands are also much more recent and smaller than enormous legacy brands, therefore percentage growth — the way most analyses are performed — will likely be skewed. “Much faster” needs a specific qualifier, preferably total sales growth in dollars over a number of years."

todayilearned,ffdjllk,t3_et0k5r,1579822253.0,"Worked with SUBWAY marketing for 7 years during this era. Can confirm. But the dollar figure quoted represents much more than “Chuck” and “Community.” The investments spanned a number of TV shows and movies over several years, most of which were frankly mediocre at best. And sales gains were, in fact, substantial. But, in my opinion, they were completely unrelated to the product placements. The brand has been in a sales death spiral since about 2014-2015 as its $5 FOOTLONG offering disappeared, overall pricing rose and other, more consumer-focused fast casual restaurant chains supplanted it. The product placements were nice but not central to SUBWAY’s success. Nor did they ensure its continuing relevance.

EDIT #1: I see a lot of comments about SUBWAY getting rid of the $5 FOOTLONG and how that’s a rip-off. To be fair to the franchisees, restaurants in general run on slim profit margins and SUBWAY’s are among the thinnest. The home office has oversaturated the market, forced the building of too many locations, stunted individual store sales volumes, ingredients prices are always increasing and labor costs, insurance and rents have gone up a fair amount — especially in larger cities. It’s literally not possible for them to hold the line on a price point that was first introduced (and was profitable) in the 1990s. A big menu of long-term $5 sandwiches is just not feasible anymore. 

EDIT #2: I was on vacation when Jared was arrested. Coming back to work was walking into a shit storm. Understandably, everyone was holding their breath to see how badly his personal failings would impact store sales. Fortunately for the franchisees – who were my main concern – he’d been out of SUBWAY’s top-tier advertising efforts long enough that most people didn’t hold the company accountable along with him. Estimates were that “the situation” only impacted sales a few percentage points for a limited period of time."
