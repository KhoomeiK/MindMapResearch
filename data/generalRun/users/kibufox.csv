todayilearned,ff04syk,t3_er03rw,1579465242.0,"This isn't entirely true.  Prior to the advent of automobiles, most cities of a substantial size, which is to say one that had a sizable number of streets, had some variation of a law on the books which designated places where pedestrians could safely cross the streets.  The earliest known such law was from around 1900 to 1905 (there's some discussion as to when the law was specifically passed) and came about not because of automobiles, but trolleys.  In one instance in New York City, it was noted that the large numbers of pedestrians crossing the road at random locations was leading to numerous instances of pedestrians being struck and killed by the streetcar system. To cut down on this, a law was passed which would become a 'proto' jaywalking law, that basically stated that pedestrians were forbidden from walking across the streets or roads at any location other than those which were specifically designated for such a purpose. Those locations being around trolley stops, and each end of the streets at the corner. (At the time, the New York Surface system, better known as trolleys, had tracks in the center of the streets, and stops every half block or so. There were no platforms, but were ""safe zones"" designated where a pedestrian could stand in the road and wait the train, and designated paths to the sidewalks to allow the pedestrian to access the trolleys).  When automobiles came about, it wasn't the companies themselves, as is often thought, who petitioned for further legislation on the subject; but city leaders. At the time, though laws did exist in many cities, there still existed a number of cities, and even locations within cities with the laws, where jaywalking was an issue; or at least could pose an issue as automobile traffic became more prevalent.  So, the lawmakers and city authorities, fearing that the number of pedestrians being struck and killed would rise, they went forward with passing the laws to further prevent pedestrian traffic on roads.  Curiously, in New York, there was a side development of this, with a horrible series of car accidents with surface freight trains (in the area we now call the high line), that prompted elevation of the railroad out of the street. They did not however elevate the trolley system, as that stayed in use into the 40's, along side the subway and elevated passenger system."
todayilearned,ff021ib,t3_eqwku5,1579464391.0,"What we consider a work week, which is to say the seven day system, isn't how it's always been.  Granted, it's been that way for a long ass time, but even so there was a period of time where it wasn't considered standard. Curiously, it's not Christians who are thought to have established it.

Alternate-number weeks used to be common. The Egyptians, for example, used 10-day weeks. But our best guess for the creation of the seven-day week is that the idea originated in ancient Babylonia. The Babylonians, living in Mesopotamia (present-day Iraq), held the number seven as a holy number, that being the number of objects in our Solar System they could observe at the time: the sun, the moon, Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn. The Babylonians already had months, just like anyone else, and if you want to split up a period of around 29 days into a smaller period, why not divide it basically into four parts, especially when that number is damnably close to your holy number of seven? So the Babylonians used a seven-day week, with the seventh day having certain religious responsibilities (relaxation, cessation of work, worship, that kind of thing). Writes Zerubavel:

The length of the astrological week was largely a result of the fact that the ancient Babylonian astronomers happened to identify seven planets. (Had they been able, with the help of some sophisticated telescopes, to observe Uranus, Neptune, and Pluto, the week might have evolved as a ten-day cycle. On the other hand, had they accepted our heliocentric model of the planetary system, where the sun is considered a stationary star rather than a planet, this cycle might have been only six days long.)

Around the 6th century BC, the Babylonians were a dominant culture in the Near East, and their ideas spread far and wide, including the concept of the seven-day week. The Jews happened to be captives in Babylonia around that time, and adopted the week concept. So did the nearby Persians and the (not yet dominant) Greeks. The Jews already agreed with the Babylonians that “7” is a very cool number indeed; creation in the Jewish tradition (and Jewish-derived traditions, like Christianity) took place in seven days. (Though it’s worth noting two things: first, nobody’s totally sure that the Jewish creation myth actually predates the Babylonian captivity, and second, that “days” in that case probably translates better to something like “periods” or “intervals.”) Anyway, the Jews got on board.

The Greeks did, too, and when they began traveling and conquering around the time of Alexander the Great, from 356 to 323 BC, they brought the seven-day week with them as far east as India and, either directly or, more likely, through Indian contacts, to China. The last major society to fall to the tyranny of the seven-day week was the Romans; they had observed a strict 8-day week up until 45 BC, when the Romans adopted the new Julian calendar, which is extremely similar to the Gregorian calendar we use today. The Julian calendar used seven-day weeks, but the Romans observed, weirdly, both seven-day Julian weeks and (to a smaller degree) the older eight-day cycles until Constantine officially banned the eight-day cycle in 321 AD. By that time the eight-day cycle was barely used.

The most recent real attempt to throw out the seven-day week was in 1929, when the USSR changed the calendar to have 72 weeks of 5 days each (the difference was made up with some national holidays, which did not fall on normal days of the week—it’d be like having Saturday, Sunday, Labor Day, Monday, Tuesday). Each worker was given one of these days as a rest day, in which they didn’t work. The system was designed to make for a continuous work week; at any given moment, 24 hours a day, every day, 80 percent of the work force was working, compared with in garbage capitalist systems that gave universal weekends."
whatisthisthing,fezlz33,t3_eqwujr,1579458829.0,"This was a type 97 Japanese grenade from ww2. They didn't have the usual 'pin' system like what the US, brits, or the weird ball thing the Germans had.  While yes, there was a safety pin, it didn't arm the grenade. Rather, to do so, the person throwing it would need to strike the brass end on something hard, even including their helmet, to start the timer.  

This one is missing a whole hell of a lot of parts to be armed, looking as if it's been struck on something and then just never detonated.  Explosive wise, the Japanese used Piric Acid in place of TNT, which was both more volatile, but at the same time weaker than TNT, giving this grenade less of an actual 'punch' when compared to other grenade types.

When wet, piric acid is very safe.  When dried out, it becomes extremely dangerous and sensitive to shock or friction.  Picric acid can easily form metal picrate salts that are even more sensitive and hazardous than the acid itself. So, quit picking it up, contact your local police department and have them come deal with it.  

The only thing that might render it safe, is where it was originally found. If it had been found in water, (there is no outside evidence that suggests this is the case), then the Piric acid would have been rendered harmless as it is water soluable.  So yah, it's a type 97, and it's very dangerous."

Back in the 90's, I was in college living in a small town in North East Georgia.   While going to college, I was also working nights at a local grain elevator as an RCO (type of locomotive engineer). That's all going to be important later.

In any case, there was a program all freshmen students had to take part in. That program was aimed at acting as a diversion to keep students out of bars and what not.  While at one of these events, I met another student who I'll call E. E, like me, was a freshman student and had come from some distance to study. She was nice and all, but I had a girlfriend from high school at the time, and wasn't overly interested in her.  It didn't stop me from seeing her as a good friend though, and we did go out to the movies a couple times.

About two months into knowing her, my existing girlfriend broke up with me and I hit a seriously rough patch. E saw this as her opportunity, and tried to get me to date her, but at that point I wasn't having any of it. The breakup had been hard, and I wasn't ready to date again, at least not so soon. E and I went to a movie, and she tried to get me to come back up to her dorm room, but I refused. She seemed to understand that, and left me alone. 

Yeah, that didn't happen though. A couple days later, when I arrived at the college, I was called into the dean's office and told that I was being placed on probation pending the investigation of my sexual assault of E the day before. I was beside myself. I had no idea what was going on, and what to do. I was told that in a few weeks, there'd be a disciplinary hearing as to whether or not I would be expelled.  

I talked with some friends about it, and they told me that E had claimed I'd raped her the night before, and she'd gone to her adviser to report it. Remember how I said I worked nights? I'd worked the full shift the night before, so I knew this was all a lie. I tried explaining this to the dean and later president of the school, but they wouldn't listen. So I had to take drastic action. I contacted the city's police department, informing them that she had failed to report the crime, I was the accused, and I'd like to get my statement out of the way.

That threw one hell of a wrench into things. Police questioned me, got my statement, and checked my alibi, while they also called her in to question. She stuck with the story, even claiming that I'd left work to do it before returning. They checked with the company, found that at no point had I left the job, and blew all manner of holes into her story. Eventually, she had to admit that she'd made the whole story up because she was angry that I wouldn't date her.  The disciplinary hearing still happened, and I ended up on permanent probation for daring to go to an outside source for justice. She ended up in jail for a year for filing a false statement. 

I became a pariah on campus. E's adviser made it clear that regardless of what the facts of the case said, and regardless of E having to admit she'd lied, I still was dangerous and thus not to be trusted. I lasted another three months before I left for another college and put it behind me."

whatisthisthing,fe5wxq6,t1_fe5aw5i,1578876786.0,"Railroad originally ran steam, primarily 2-8-0 consolidation type locomotives.  This changed in the 50's when a pair of GE 70 ton switching locomotives were purchased, and the remaining steam locomotives were scrapped.  Last train ran in 1992. Railroad originally interchanged with the Lehigh Valley Railroad, and the Lackawanna Railroad. Lackawanna electrified much of its main lines in 1930/31; with the area where the Rahway interchanged being part of that electrification process. This electrification process electrified the area using overhead catenary, at 3000v DC.  By 1984, the lines had been converted to 25 kV 60 Hz by NJ transit. 

Given the lack of overall corrosion on the insulator, I suspect it's from the conversion process, an probably dates from some time between the original electrification, and the conversion to the higher power system.  The Rahway would have still been in full operation then, so it stands to reason that it would have seen some use in helping with the removal of the older system."
