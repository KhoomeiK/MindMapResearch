Fast forward 150 years. I am at work helping to refurbish those seven beautiful houses and we we ripped up linoleum guess what we found? That beautiful stone, beautiful enough in my opinion to make jewelry out of, had been hidden underneath that ugly sheet of plastic for I don't know how many decades. After we got it all cleaned up and polished and we're looking at it my boss was practically in tears.

nextfuckinglevel,fg6lfbm,t1_fg6h99b,1580571051.0,"I thought about that. Regular ice might be enough especially since the air (probably nitrogen really) in the canister will cool itself as it decompresses. Again, this thing only has to work for like 5 minutes.

dry ice can also be purchased from grocery stores and ice cream shops. It's not easy. I'm in a major metropolitan area and Google maps only shows me six places where I can buy it in this city. Of course, those guys have to go out for groceries all the time anyway so in some cases it might work out. I have seen a large block last for days in a regular domestic freezer. If you pack the ice into the insulated container and then put it in the freezer you might get more time. Maybe I just like the idea because it's cheap and simple."
nextfuckinglevel,fg3p0rj,t1_fg3jbhu,1580486574.0,"I've been chewing on the problem since I posted. Imagine a small block of dry ice that's well-insulated. running through it is a copper tube that leads on one end to a small cylinder of compressed nitrogen that's also well-insulated. The other end of the copper tube pours cold nitrogen over the component that you're trying to keep cool. The whole thing would be under a kilogram and have only two moving parts the valve and the gas.

Keep in mind this thing only has to work for 5 or 10 minutes tops. I don't think they usually stay inside burning buildings longer than that."

We could do that with foxes, crows or any other animal in 10 generations if we start with a large enough pool.

We could do chimpanzees in a hundred and fifty years but the results might be really troublesome in a lot of ways.

I was actually thinking about the problem on the way into work and considering that the guys are never inside a burning house for more than a few minutes I think the best bet would probably be a well insulated block of ice with a copper tube running through it that blows cold air on to the components you're trying to keep cool.

DiWHY,fffe4n5,t1_ffev13z,1579881966.0,Here's a fun fact. The cranberry marshes need to be flooded in the spring because that's swampyness is the cranberrie's natural habitat and the young plants grow best there. The only reason they flood them in the fall is because since they already have everything all set up the flood them it's the easiest way to harvest all the cranberries. They fall off the vine when they're ripe and when they fill the marsh back up with water they all float to the top so that they can just drain the whole thing through a screen and dump the cranberries into a larger container.
