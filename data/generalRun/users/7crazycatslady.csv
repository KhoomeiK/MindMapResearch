composting,ffnm1j3,t1_ffnkynx,1580067680.0,Great nitrogen source! Pee on it as often as you can/want. I also have my husband pee on the new veggie garden beds that I've covered with straw for the winter - along with adding coffee grounds to promote worm activity.
AskReddit,ffjmued,t1_ffiw1jn,1580001901.0,"My husband and I were caught by our 2 year old once and I just remember yelling ""ABORT! ABORT!"" and we lost it. Now we lock the door."
AskReddit,ffjmpzh,t1_ffjif4b,1580001816.0,This scene helped me reconcile my own relationship with my father. I'm gonna be great without him... but it's normal that it still hurts.
composting,ff78j9h,t1_ff6szc8,1579643228.0,"Nope. I basically just cut them to make a box and screwed them together. In the spring I'll make a gate out of the front panel so I can actually get in there and turn it better, but it was small enough in the fall (I made it late in the year) to just rake to turn. Now that it's mostly frozen I dig a little hole and dump my scraps and I'll give it a good turn in the spring. 

Gonna make a second one on the next nice day so I can start a 2nd pile."
composting,ff6bnr4,t3_errsum,1579623663.0,I used panels from an old fence I had shoved next to my shed.

aww,feergt6,t1_feeqdd4,1579039635.0,"My actual adoption cost was $26,000. We also had to pay bio mom's hospital bill for the birth, which was an additional $12,000. This was in 2016.

It is expensive AF."
aww,feerbtc,t1_fee3lrl,1579039551.0,"Not OP but am an adoptive mom. Assuming you're in the US, your first step will be to decide which type of adoption: domestic infant (a baby born in the US), foreign, or foster care. Each one of those choices has a different road.

I'm happy to share details. But it started with an info session at the adoption agency and going from there.

My advice: start saving up now. Adoption is expensive."
AmItheAsshole,feepm12,t1_feedppf,1579038556.0,"Oh man. That sounds amazing.

composting,fcw14uj,t3_ej7pdd,1578014733.0,You may want to start a 2nd pile now and let your current one cook.
TrueOffMyChest,fcvjlxs,t1_fcu9rwi,1578003486.0,"I was on home and hospital too! I actually really learned a lot and ended up doing really well on finals.

It was also the 2nd half of senior year. So that kinda sucked."
LifeProTips,fcv9wzd,t1_fcuobgz,1577997693.0,My husband and I get takeout from the local mexican restaurant and watch a movie. Best valentine's dates ever for the last 8 years.
composting,fclxrza,t3_ehr0qp,1577759075.0,"You may also see if Sharewaste.com has anyone doing pickups in your area if you want to continue sending scraps to a larger scale composter, or if you have more scraps than your balcony can handle. (In my experience, a tumbler should be fine for 2 people, but it depends heavily on how many fresh fruits and veggies you eat). 

It's not super super popular yet, but the more people that know about it, the better! :)"
TalesFromTheFrontDesk,fci72v7,t3_eh8xs8,1577658508.0,"My husband always tries to use exsuckia for booking. Since reading this sub, I make him book direct. Glad I'm not the only one that's learned!

AskReddit,fchj3t0,t3_eh4nfa,1577650930.0,"I was about 18, out with friends at a local band's show, and I wasn't feeling well. I was sitting on a couch near the door and some guy who was leaving looked at me and said ""you are GORGEOUS."" and left.

Really helped me get through some crappy feelings about myself to remember that at least one person besides my mom thought I was pretty."
marketing,fchhb6b,t3_eh7ojy,1577650468.0,"Look into your local print shops. Honestly, for 50-100 pieces you may have better luck with the big guys, but it's worth checking into. 

If you're mailing TO the US, I use Handymail out of Kansas. Good pricing and good service."
aww,fchgcia,t1_fcgptma,1577650249.0,I'd totally sub to that sub.
marketing,fc97k2a,t3_egm0xz,1577548290.0,"I haven't used the CRM functionality in AC, but friends of mine that work CRM heavy say it kinda sucks. If you were just doing marketing automation it would be a no brainer for AC. I haven't used Zoho, unfortunately. 

I know you asked for people with experience in both, so hopefully other commenters can be more helpful."
