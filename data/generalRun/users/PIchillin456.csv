Roadcam,fgoysd9,t1_fgouryc,1580992161.0,"The same goes for me as well. But that the same time I've seen way too many videos where this sort of thing happens. I think that for some people they let the power of having proof get to their heads. They know that they can prove that they were in the ""right"" so they do things that ensure the accident happens or at least do nothing to prevent it. I watch a lot of car crash compilations on youtube and at one point this one guys videos kept getting featured. He had to have had at least 10-12 videos of accidents he had been in. They were all the other drivers fault but 90% of them were completely preventable."
videos,fgoww31,t1_fgotql2,1580990160.0,"You have a weird personal definition for what a restoration is. To restore something is simply to bring it back to its original condition. This fits that definition. Replacing parts is sometimes a necessary part of restoring something. Plus, the parts that were replaced were wear items like seals and a couple of parts that were beyond repair. 

Also your analogy with the paintings doesn't really work. The goal of restoring a painting is to bring it back its former glory or at least as close as possible. Sure, they're not going to repaint the whole thing. But sometimes restoring a painting requires that they repaint sections where the paint came off or where a hole was punched through. Sometimes they have to attach a support structure behind the painting to stabilize it or replace the original frame. Restoring a painting can even involve removing just the paint and then reattaching it to an entirely new canvas. These are major changes to the original piece. But it's still a restoration,"

battlewagon,ffxh7r0,t1_ffx8a1s,1580325087.0,"Auto or manual? I've got a 1.8T manual 4motion sedan and I love it. I would have preferred a wagon but the 1.8T 4motion manual wagons are hard to track down. 

Btw it's gonna stay FWD unless you want to throw a large amount of cash into modifications. With these it's easier to start with 4motion from the start. The entire floor pan, fuel tank, rear subframe,  rear suspension,transmission, ECU, TCU (if auto), and even the crankshaft are all completely different on the 4motions so it's not just a simple swap."
Dashcam,ffoalcf,t1_ffny011,1580075747.0,That's a fair point. Personally I try to create a balance. I want to give myself that extra distance but I also don't want to brake too hard so that the car behind me has the maximum amount of space to slow down/stop as well. I've been rear-ended multiple times so at this point I do whatever I can to avoid that happening.
IdiotsInCars,ffldoah,t1_ffl8l60,1580038307.0,It's a good thing too because these things do not hold up in rollover crashes. Or any sort of crash really. At one point they were the deadliest cars on the road.
Justrolledintotheshop,ff47cxu,t1_ff46y5m,1579557141.0,I'd imagine Toyota stuck with a basic old school chain system instead of the overcomplicate garbage we see today.
Justrolledintotheshop,ff46fxj,t1_ff44835,1579556573.0,"Is VAG just really bad at making reliable chain driven systems? My 2007 Jetta had a chain and between the 13,000 and 62,000 miles marks I had two tensioner failures. Meanwhile both of the B5.5 Passats I've owned easily made it to 140,000 miles on the original belt."
carporn,ff45tzi,t1_ff407wk,1579556192.0,Same. It has to be either a 71 or a 72. I love this front end. I would accept a 69 or a 70 but I just don't like the 73 and newer models.

Justrolledintotheshop,ff3ycih,t1_ff3umd4,1579551530.0,"Are timing chains really any better these days? I've had way more problems with chain driven systems than I've ever had with a belt. Sure, those old school designs are basically bullet proof. But modern engines have complicated chain routing, along with guides and tensioners that seem to love failing way before the chain requires replacement."

UnethicalLifeProTips,ff1u7h7,t3_epurps,1579486285.0,"You'd have to be very close to the rental place otherwise that wouldn't work. Back when I was in high school someone came by and poured about a gallon of water into the fuel tanks of my car and my parents cars. None of us even made it out of the neighborhood. 

But the bigger issue is that when the rental company finds out what caused the breakdown they'll most likely come after you for the damages."
cars,feudfdn,t1_ferrrrx,1579385507.0,"Can confirm. I have a very clean 2002 Escape with only 65,000 miles on it. I thought that I got a good deal on it but that's because I never got underneath it. The amount of rust is ridiculous. I'm the second owner and it's spent it's whole life here locally in an area where cars don't really rust that much. My 2004 Volkswagen Passat with double the mileage has zero rust and it's also spent it's whole life here. My 1997 Mercury Mountaineer with 200,000 miles has minor surface rust here and there but compared to my Escape it's rust-free. I've never seen a car rust out this bad and I've owned a lot of $1000 beaters."

But ultimately it didn't matter that much because the owner of the car wasn't the driver and neither the owner or their insurance company responded. So my insurance company just treated it as a single vehicle collision.

cars,fdxu3ec,t1_fdxeqew,1578772953.0,I got rear-ended by someone and was deemed at fault for the same bullshit. I was 19 and the lady was a 40 something year old with 2 kids in the car. She kept screaming about how I put her children's lives in danger and the cop took her side. 2 months later I got in another accident when a 60 year old guy cut into my lane last second forcing me to swerve and slam into a curb. The only damage to his car was a scratch on his fender (which in retrospect was probably already there before this happened) and again I was deemed at fault. Being young is a serious disadvantage in these situations. I wish that I had owned a dash cam back then. It would have saved me a lot of trouble.
