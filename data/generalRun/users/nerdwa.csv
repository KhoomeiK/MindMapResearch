todayilearned,ffhkh6r,t1_ffglv2h,1579939441.0,"80s and 90s had a lot of weird animal shows. Ninja turtles, biker mice, street sharks, thunder cats... any more?"
todayilearned,ffhkepy,t1_ffgrwhz,1579939343.0,I have the Exo-Suit toy for Lt. JT Marsh somewhere. I still think it’s one of the best and most realistic depiction of exosuits in general.
todayilearned,ffge99l,t1_fffkpsf,1579904287.0,"I just googled Exo-Squad and they don't have any Star Trek people but they do have two people from Stargate. Also, Biker Mice from Mars apparently had a pretty interesting cast."
AskScienceFiction,ff7p2p2,t1_ff6kaef,1579654893.0,"I also feel like Zed's look of disapproval wasn't about Jay being ""less qualified"" compared to everyone else, but rather sadness that he's essentially going to take away a very good cop's life away and make him disappear."
AskScienceFiction,ff5rpdy,t1_ff4vinb,1579607647.0,My initial thought was that maybe X-Wings are as well suited to engage in dogfights in weather conditions like Hoth and maybe the rebels had to salvage parts from a downed X-Wing and just thought to bolt them onto the speeders.
AskScienceFiction,ff44ego,t1_ff42qdy,1579555290.0,After a bit of research it seems the X-Wings have [KX9 laser cannons](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/KX9_laser_cannon) and the Snowspeeders are equipped with [AP/11 laser cannons](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Ap/11_double_laser_cannon).
funny,ff43u4b,t1_ff3fzaq,1579554941.0,I work in a reference lab and most of my coworkers are Filipino. They're constantly trying to feed me.
AskScienceFiction,ff3ne9f,t1_ff3k43y,1579544771.0,"Never considered this, but the guns on the snowspeeders are probably chopped off from X-Wings and modified for fit onto the much smaller speeders. One X-Wing can arm two speeders."
todayilearned,feztujj,t3_equ0ve,1579461584.0,"My possible future children will never know the feeling of being in a video store and looking at all the aisles and aisles of movies, music, and video games. Being curious about that weird corner with curtains hiding unnamed movies. The feeling of going home with a stack of VHS cassettes in grubby boxes and knowing the next few days is going to be a marathon of being in front of the tv with family. Not knowing if that movie you picked out is going to be good or bad but knowing that you're committed to watching it.  That awful sound of the cassette rewinder."
television,fdv6u1v,t1_fduoa6s,1578743932.0,Very very true.

news,fcx5wcr,t1_fcx14vl,1578052546.0,"I think what pisses me off even more is that a lot of this is being done via Twitter. For all we know, a single “tweet” is going to end the world. This is disgusting."
