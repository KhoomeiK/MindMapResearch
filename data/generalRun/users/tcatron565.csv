NoStupidQuestions,ff5nyw4,t1_ff5mxlf,1579602504.0,"> Okay so if I were a USA resident and had no insurance, I cannot get treated for frequent chest tightness or chest pain but as soon as I have something more urgent like a heart attack, the hospitals would have to treat me appropriately in order to keep me alive?

No, an emergency room in a hospital cannot turn anyone away if they don't have insurance. The severity of your visit does not matter. You could be there for a stubbed toe and they wouldn't turn you away (you would just have a very long wait time). That's great in one sense, but bad in another since people without insurance are likely to visit the ER for something mundane because a regular doctor's visit may not be possible for them.

That being said, there are plenty of doctor's offices and urgent care centers throughout the country that do accept patients without insurance. There are even a few clinics that specialize in taking people without insurance. Unfortunately, it's going to be expensive no matter what, though. There are several places that give discounts or reduced prices or even charity for paying medical bills if you don't have insurance, but even then, it can still be expensive.

I currently am without insurance. Back in July I went to the ER for a kidney stone. I was given a CAT scan and some medications and was sent on my way. That's it. The bill totaled over $6,000 between three different sources (the hospital ER itself, the CT scanning department, and some third party that deals with the ER specifically). Luckily the hospital I went to has a charity service in place for those without insurance. Even with it, though, I still had to pay $800 out of pocket.

Likewise, I just recently went to the doctor for a sore throat and a mental health consultation. I was given a strep throat swab and just spoke with the doctor as she examined me. I had to pay $75 just to get in. I just received the bill for the rest. Thankfully they also have a charity discount for those that do not have insurance. The bill is still $95 for a grand total of $170."

NoStupidQuestions,fem07k8,t1_felykuq,1579235596.0,"The sun is still up the same amount of time! How are you not getting this? The exact same amount of heat energy is being distributed to the earth. It doesn't matter if the sun rises at 5am or 6am, if it's out for 16 hours, then you get 16 hours of heat energy. Yes, that energy begins to dissipate when the sun sets, but not considerably so only *one hour* afterwards. Literally all you're doing is shifting the hottest part of the day one hour earlier. It will still be the same temperature, just one hour earlier.

If the temperature peaks at 115 at 5pm in the summer with DST, if you remove it, the temperature then peaks at 115 at 4pm. That's it. If it's 100 at 9pm when the sun sets and 95 an hour later at 10pm during DST, then by removing DST it's now 100 at 8pm when the sun sets and 95 an hour later at 9pm.

Now, if you happen to be outside during summer nights until 10pm whether DST is around or not, sure, it will feel a tiny bit cooler (like 92 compared to 95), but the time of year is what makes November nights feel cooler, not the ending of DST. This is due to the tilt of the Earth compared to the sun. It doesn't matter where you are located: as long as you are in the northern hemisphere November is cooler than July or August. The fact that the highs in November are lower than the middle of summer should be a dead giveaway to that."
NoStupidQuestions,felyfvj,t1_felx3yo,1579234147.0,Yes. DST is over in November. Summer time is DST.
NoStupidQuestions,felwrx8,t1_felwdyc,1579232889.0,The sun will literally still be up the same amount of time. The reason it feels cooler is because it's later in the year when DST ends *in November*. July at 9pm is still going to be hot as hell whether the sun sets at 8 or 9.
NoStupidQuestions,felw0sm,t1_feltscc,1579232341.0,Shifting your entire day an hour won't change that. Either it will be hotter an hour later or an hour earlier. DST doesn't affect temperature.

So I went with Twitter. They all have varying levels of toxicity, but somehow it seems as if Twitter just brings out the worst in people. On Facebook and Reddit you get hiveminds over mostly political or opinionated entertainment posts. On Twitter you get those plus groups of people coming out of the woodwork to attack others for the most mundane things. And with the low character limit, it becomes a breeding ground for bullying and shouting tactics rather than a space where legitimate debates can thrive, which is almost entirely unique to Twitter.

In short I think all of them have their problems, but Twitter feels like the top source of and most technologically promotive of cyber bullying."

There are certainly other incentives (merch, tour tickets, interviews, etc) but money is no longer one of them. What radio decides to play is based on a long list of factors and the radio industry is super fascinating because of it. Yes, it's all preprogrammed, your requests typically don't get played then and there (but that use them gauge listener response for changing the playlists later), and there is indeed a lot of schmoozing behind the scenes, but pay for play is thankfully illegal.

With one exception: labels can acquire first day or first weekend radio deals in which certain branded stations (most commonly iHeart Radio stations) will play their brand new track for a predetermined amount of time. Typically it is once per hour. But after the deal is over, the station can choose not to ever play the song again if they wish.

In fact, Billboard used to have the requirement that songs could only chart on the Hot 100 if they were released separately from their album. This was totally fine until the death of the physical single arose. Songs like ""Don't Speak"" by No Doubt, ""Torn"" by Natalie Imbruglia, and ""Iris"" by the Goo Goo Dolls were huge on the radio, but were never released as physical singles, thus they were barred from the Hot 100. Billboard changed the rules in the mid-late 90s to allow these radio only singles to finally chart."

Gaga did record ""Do What U Want"" with him a few years back during the ""blind eye"" portion of his career.

So unless you have a larger sized stone, most stones hurt tremendously traveling from the kidney to the bladder while only causing mild to no pain at all after it finds its way to the urethra."
quityourbullshit,fcqvd05,t1_fcpun1n,1577892771.0,"This isn't 100% effective in preventing kidney stones and I loathe how much people spread it around as is it is. Certain medications and foods increase your chances of kidney stones, soda is not one of them. Tea is, however. Water does not decrease the chances of a kidney stone. In fact, there isn't anything that decreases the chances of a kidney stone. Yes, dehydration can lead to kidney stones, ergo drink more liquid, but water itself is not some magical anti-kidney stone remedy. Quite a few root vegetables like rhubarb and beets are linked to increased risk of kidney stones too, hydration be damned. And some people are just prone to them and no matter how hard they try, they can't completely prevent them.

A healthy diet and exercise helps prevent them to a certain degree (especially if you're not prone to them), but then again the same can be said about most diseases.

It's just random internet points, dude. They don't affect your life whatsoever. Quit whining about them."
