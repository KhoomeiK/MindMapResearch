SuicideWatch,ffd1yz6,t3_esymsd,1579811826.0,"I found that was trapped in this cycle of self punishment and I didn't understand where it came from. If you don't mind me asking, do you have any hobbies or activities you enjoy that could be loosely competitive? Like a sport or gaming? I found that doing something that gives you the chance of winning and therefore positive reinforcement, helps remove that belief that you're a failure or are somehow less than everyone."
SuicideWatch,ffd12cd,t3_esymgb,1579811320.0,"Honestly, the world is full of horrible, greedy and manipulative people and I flip between wishing I could klll everyone or myself. If you don't mind me asking, what pusher you over the edge?"
SuicideWatch,ffd0esi,t3_esymsd,1579810961.0,Would you mind if I ask what exactly you feel is so bad about yourself? Do you consciously put yourself down or is it something subconscious. I've found that my self loathing is quite subconscious now. Almost like I've trained myself to just hate myself. Do you feel you've got to that point too?

If you're lucky you may find one that is paid. Some companies will pay you (admittedly poorly) to basically train to be their future staff. It's a good way to get a skill, get out of the house and have some sort of financial setup."

Do you have any little hobby or activities that you can engage in? For me I found I needed something where I was in control of the whole process. Not having to wait for some idiot to do their part so I could progress. It probably sounds kind of weird but I found that mechanism and mechanics were deeply satisfying. They are the purest for of cause and effect. I started making simple little things. I'm currently trying to learn watch making.

It's not easy and you probably think it's really lame but sometimes just having something that only you control and you are subject only to the laws of physics and not people can be really helpful. Just a thought."
SuicideWatch,ff6zfo5,t1_ff6z0f0,1579638047.0,Did you stop because of how exhausting and difficult the people in your life were making online learning or was it the learning itself that wasn't as accessible as you had hoped?

SuicideWatch,ff6wi1a,t3_erzu2u,1579636325.0,"If you don't mind me asking, do you have anything you really like doing? Or watching? One of the things I found that helps me is to try and replicate the things I enjoy watching or reading. It may sound stupid but I really got into watchmakers. It's the incredible order and neatness and the clear order of cause and affect. I find it quite comforting to build something and see it work. I also try to go out every day and pet at least one dog in the park. I guess that sounds really pathetic but I can't have a dog now but grew up with one. It's really nice to see their happy little faces as they come wiggling over to you. 

I guess I'm just trying to say that maybe if you had a reason to get up that was all yours and no one else's and only for your pleasure, it might help you get up each day. Because you have something nice to aim for."

Wherever you are, you're more than likely to have some sort of GFCI or equivalent socket in your bathroom. It's not going to work and you're going to hurt yourself. OR it doesn't trip the breaker and you literally burn your skin off in a tub of conductive fluid that will ensure maximum pain for every submerged part of your body.

SuicideWatch,ff5wtf7,t3_eru9m2,1579612888.0,"This is just my opinion and nothing more so feel free to ignore me but your SO seems to be attuned to your emotional state more than you may realise. He can clearly see pain and suffering and he's desperately trying to help because more than anything in the world, more than his human instinct for self preservation, more than his fear of not understanding and making a mess he loves you dearly. With all his heart he loves you and wants to love you. Wants to take your pain away or help you cary it. He wants to see you smile again, not that smile you do for him so you think he'll feel better. But that smile you do when you're really happy. That little smile when he kisses you and it makes you happy.

He won't know what to do. He's going to have to do all sorts of learning and research to know how to handle this. He's going to have to sit with you in therapy and learn with you. It won't be easy for either of you but he'll do it. He'll drag himself through broken glass if he has to.

Please please please give him the chance. Don't leave him alone. Don't run away from him. He won't be perfect but he'll try like his life depends on it because it does. You're his life. Please don't take his life away with yours without letting him try to help. Sometimes all you need to help take those horrible dark scary steps is knowing that someone is walking next to you.

If you feel so bad that you have nothing left, then you have nothing to loose in turning to the man you love and telling him you need him."

I believe in you. Anyone who keeps getting up like you do, will succeed eventually. To me you sound much stronger than you believe you are. I have learnt that there's no time limit on making friends. Don't be afraid to let go of them. There's always someone else somewhere else and if you keep getting up like you do, you're going to find them all the time. Eventually you'll find one that sticks.

SuicideWatch,ff42uln,t3_erjj9n,1579554334.0,"I'm sorry that you were so viciously hurt by someone you care about. There's no choosing who you love. So I won't waste your time telling you to find someone worthy of you. Because the only person who will ever be truly worthy of you is you. Try to take just one step. One tiny step in any direction at all that allows you to make yourself happy. Find anything, anything at all and get just a tiny bit of joy in your life. For me it was going to the park and petting any dog that wondered over to me. Most people don't let their dogs off lead for some reason here but there's always that one puppy who gets away.

If you can smile at least one tiny bit. Then there's an ocean of hope and power deep inside you still. Repeat until you have enough to take another, slightly bigger, step."

At the moment I find myself in a (subjectively I suppose) good space and I feel that I'm OK. My post was more to see if I could actually bring myself to talk. Even if it was just into the void so to speak. The next step is have a conversation with a person I suppose but for now I'm happy with what I've achieved. So thank, you. But no thank you.

I tried to help the people in my life for so long until I realised they were just using me to compensate for their own laziness and general stupidity. You can love someone dearly but that won't take the fucking stupid out of them. An idiot is an idiot. The only difference between one idiot and the next is how much they affect your life. Think of yourself first. Think about how you feel and what you want. Before you let someone utter moron push you past your breaking point, find something, anything, that makes you even a little bit happy and focus on that. 

I don't know if this makes sense or if you even want to hear it but I've realised that if I go down, I'm not doing so without being happy at least once. Just once and fuck anyone who wants to stop that. The world will abuse good people because people aren't really good. Individually we can be, but the second we are a group of people it's all different."
SuicideWatch,fezy8o3,t1_fezw6wd,1579463167.0,"Ah, OK. Well, my experience of the gaming world is that people are going to be utter dicks about everything anyway. Played Battlefield since 2010 and the online community is, erm, let's just say, difficult. However! I did make some really cool online friends and for years I had a blast. Its all about blocking the idiots and talking to the people who play like you play. Find the one who isn't playing like they haven't discovered higher brain functions yet and hang around them in game. I always played a support role and trust me. Sometimes just the correct deployment of an ammo bag and a claymore can make you a friend! But I'll admit it's difficult. But also entirely virtual! No real world consequences! Take a risk, have fun! When it stops being fun. Turn it. Come back later.

Teachers and school faculty are really not very good at dealing with these things. I know this first hand as I've seen it and dealt with it. I work in a school and you couldn't get me to trust a school Councillor if you paid me. But the helplines are different. 100% different. If for no other reason than they can't possibly throw it back on you. They don't even know where you are. Have a go. Sometimes just taking the first step is enough. No one expects you to run. Just a step. 1 single step. That's it."
SuicideWatch,fezvcis,t1_fezsazs,1579462137.0,"To be honest, talking to someone is the most difficult thing you can ever do. Being vulnerable is difficult, being vulnerable in person is even more difficult. The people on the helplines are trained to not be threatening or judgemental. They won't have opinions about you, they won't judge you and they won't lie to you. They have absolutely no reason to do any of that. Their jobs a voluntary. The one thing that might help is the anonymity of it all. They don't knkw you, you don't know them and there's no need for that to ever change. You'll never have to deal with any consequences of talking to them because the only consequences are those you choose. You can just talk. That's it. No goal. No target to achieve. No pressure.

If you don't mind me asking, what's the video about? Is it something that you could learn or take a course on?"
SuicideWatch,fezqzvr,t1_fezn1wd,1579460551.0,"I think, if you can bring yourself too, it would help you a lot just to talk to someone. Sometimes just hearing a human voice can really help. I know it's scary. I honestly couldn't bring myself to buy a jar of peanut butter on Friday. I had to walk past the shop twice and then paniced because I thought people would think I'm crazy for walking up and down in front of the shop. In the end I found a shop with automated tills so I wouldn't have to face a human.

The feeling of no energy is normal when studying and don't beat yourself up for that. That's unfortunately a natural part of education. The only way I found though that was to try and put myself in a situation where being even remotely productive was the only option. Try not to surround yourself with ways out. I found sometimes a change of location helped massively. Even if it was just from bedroom to dining room.

The videos on YouTube that you enjoy? Are they the kind of thing you can engage with/replicate? Basically, something you can do that is like a hobby?"
SuicideWatch,fezm7cb,t3_eqzsgy,1579458910.0,There's every chance that this isn't the real you to be honest. People are rarely if ever naturally so unhappy unless being acted on by an external force. Do you feel that there are things happening beyond your control? Or that people are saying / doing things to you? Or are the feelings more inexplicable and subtle? Does it just roll over you with no warning and spoil your mood?

SuicideWatch,feyurmr,t3_eqxn0n,1579450780.0,I understand that feeling. Like you're drowning but not in water. Everything is just lurching from one anxiety inducing problem to the next and the only relief from all of it is going back to being apathetic and depressed. It's so painful when being JUST  depressed is actually the highlight of your mood.
SuicideWatch,feypdr3,t3_eqxl6x,1579448652.0,Have you contacted a debt relief agency for advice? Or looked into filing for Bankruptcy? It's not easy but it immediately puts a stop to all contact from debters and agencies until a plan can be worked out. If you're truly in a bad financial situation you man even end up with most of not all of your debt wiped out. You will however basically never be able to borrow money or get a credit card or pass anything with a credit check again but it's a way out.
SuicideWatch,feyip3x,t1_feyf4z4,1579445977.0,"To be honest, looking back on my life I've learnt two things. Your life COULD always be worse and 2. It REALLY doesn't matter one fucking bit if someone else's life is better or worse. It's all relative to your life. If you are unhappy then you are unhappy and no amount of anyone else's anything is going to help. I realised that I have to measure my life with my ruler and no one else's. 

I don't know your life or the people in it and in all honesty I don't think it truly matters if you leave people behind or not. Once you're gone, you're gone and are free of the consequences. If you're worried about them it means that somewhere tapping on the window at the back of your mind is that hope. For me (and this is only from my experience, I don't know if it will work for you) I've decided to set a reasonable goal and frame it in the time of my mother's health. If I find something worth doing that makes me happy before I'm all alone, then it's all good. If not, then at least I tried.

Finding something is difficult though, I have to admit I took the shotgun approach to it all and found I like cooking, graphic design and belive it or not. Printing. Even managed to get a job as a printer. Weird but it's actually satisfying. I have control over what happens and the results of my efforts. For me that's all I've ever wanted I think. It's helping. It hasn't stopped the feeling of loneliness or of drowning but it give me something to aim at and hope for. Hope is all you need I suppose. Or not. I'm still looking and learning."
SuicideWatch,feyde1k,t1_feycgcz,1579444096.0,"You don't really have to respond, don't worry. I do understand what it feels like to be crushed under the weight of responsibility and the glare of others. I've just decided to try doing something fun. For me, I have a time limit of sorts. My mother is unwell and eventually it will be just me. Once I am responsible for only myself. I will evaluate where I am and if it's worth continuing.

There's nothing wrong at all with you for a start. That's absolutely, perfectly, normal. That's the small bit of you that still has hope. You're not completely lost to the dark. Like me you feel like you're drowning but you can still see though it. It's like drowning in nothing. It saps your will and energy but not all of it and not all of your hope. If you can, go and do something fun. Screw people's opinions and their needs. Now is time for you. If you can find that ONE thing that makes you happy, even if only a little bit, you're so close to salvation it's practically already in your hands. Because if you can feel happiness. If you actually find it. You're going to be able to keep finding it."
SuicideWatch,fey8v3a,t3_eqwbrb,1579442248.0,"Sometimes you have to stop smiling for others. Before you go. Try one thing: Live your life entirely for your own benefit, tell the truth.
