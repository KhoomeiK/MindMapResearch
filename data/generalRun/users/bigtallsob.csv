Unless you run the magic unicorn cum power cables directly to your own hyper-smooth generator, there's  a fuckton more things in between you and the source of power that will make a bigger difference to your power than the last three feet of cable.

This covers the maintenance of the generating facilities and the raw material (natural gas, uranium, etc) costs. This cost is highly dependent on how much power you use.

Android,feoijna,t1_feoh2r9,1579300667.0,"Even if they are starting to catch up on the manufacturing front, there's still no reason why the others won't catch up on the actual product. Do you have any idea how much money is being put into this from Volkswagen alone? Tesla can only wish they had that kind of cash flow. Nothing that Tesla builds is so revolutionary that no one can reproduce it. It just takes time and money to switch directions."
Android,feoganz,t1_feof1o7,1579299720.0,"I appreciate that the model 3 is a great car, and that you love yours, but to assume that the biggest players in the game will never compete is simply laughable. Tesla has a ten year head start. That's it. Everyone else has money, experience, existing manufacturing base and supply lines, etc. It's not just about the quality of the car, it's also about the ability to get them to market, and Tesla has yet to show that they can manufacture cars on the scale of say a Toyota Corolla, which they will have to do if they are going to take over like you say. Low volume production is easy. High volume is another beast entirely."
cars,feocxbe,t1_fen5hvv,1579298369.0,I can't imagine Nissan developing two different TT V6's. I'm betting that it actually is the Q60's motor.
Android,feoa37s,t1_fenhhv7,1579297237.0,"Exactly. Tesla is a tech company. They are still figuring out lessons that Ford, Volkswagen, etc., have spent the last century learning. It's why their first high volume car launch went so hilariously bad. There's a reason why so many tech companies outsource production.

As for the infrastructure, they have issues on the horizon. The oil companies see the writing on the wall when it comes to their gas sales profits, and they are pivoting. If I recall correctly, Tesla opened up the patent on the charger so that anyone can build one. The oil companies already have all the locations they would need to build a charging network, and are just waiting for the business case to be viable. Lord knows they have the cash available to throw at the project as soon as the numbers look good, something that the perennially cash strapped Tesla can't say.

I'd love to see Tesla succeed long term, but this feels like another Blackberry situation: startup company almost singlehandedly creates a market and has massive success, untill the established players pivot and simply out compete them."
Android,fencf6c,t1_fenbhxo,1579281697.0,"I still don't see how that makes them worth what people are valuing them at. Tesla may be years ahead on design, but they are not yet at the same level as the incumbents when it comes to manufacturing. Switching from gas to electric is not going to change the manufacturing process a whole lot, and the traditional car makers (and their suppliers) can make the design to production transition was faster and smoother than Tesla has ever been able to. The lead they are currently enjoying is going to be gone in the next ten years."
