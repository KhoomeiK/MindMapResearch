Gel works fine but costs more and can transfer to partners and pets."
NonBinaryTalk,fforh6f,t3_eu582j,1580080846.0,"Gel is expensive and can transfer to your partner or pets if you are not careful. 

I would recommend the injections. It's once a week and you get used to it. I'm terrified of needles too and passed out the first time I did it, now it's just a normal part of the week. 

It goes into your muscle, not your vein, so that's less scary and painful than say, a blood test. It feels more like a vaccine. If you've had an intramuscular vaccine, it feels like that but doesn't burn. Safest place to do it is outer thigh. I use a 1.5 inch 22 or 23 gauge needle. 

If you can afford the gel and avoid getting it on anyone else, that's great, but stay away from the pills as they can be harmful to your liver. 

Your primary care physician can talk about options and show you how to use it. I just went to my normal doctor at the community clinic. 

One thing you should be aware of is that it is only 80% effective at preventing pregnancy, so you will need a contraceptive if you have cis male partners. I learned that the hard way, now I have a Mirena. 

Hope this info helps."
