I'm proud of America and the help we've given freely to other nations and yes, I do despise people taking advantage. It pains me especially that younger Americans don't seem to understand how the rest of the world works. I 100% am for closed borders while still admitting immigrants based on the contribution they could have on American society/economy (like a lot of the rest of the world does) and for having America take care of its own problems first instead of being a rug for anyone else. The only point I was trying to make in my above statement is that some of these people in third world countries are the kindest people you'd ever meet. Their generosity with what little they have can be both humbling and embarrassing since they have nothing. For some of these people, children are their only wealth, the only thing in life they are proud of, and can help them earn more money. This is all I meant by my first statement; just trying to bring perspective. Much love, everyone. Stay kind."

Good luck, and start the year off right with a great book.
