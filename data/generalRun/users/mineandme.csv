AskReddit,ff374cv,t1_ff31z2l,1579535271.0,"It seems like you’re saying that you can’t help someone who won’t help themselves . While that’s mostly true most of the time, severe depression is an insidious disease. Depending on what stage you’re in, it often makes you incapable of helping yourself. I’ve suffered from depression ,in various degrees for over 30 years. When I’m at my darkest points, I’m totally incapable of making appointments, or forcing myself to do anything including getting out of bed. When these times pass,( it could be days, weeks, or months, ) then I work like son-of-bitch to do what I can to prevent another episode. Keep in mind, I’m never depression free, just more functional. 

What I’m trying to say is there are times when a person with depression can FORCE themselves to do things to help themselves. But there are times when this is NOT possible. This is when we need that loved one or trusted person in our lives to help and support us through it. Making assumptions, like they’re not trying, or judgements, is not helpful. 

I’m not saying that those around you need to be saints either. I understand that it is trying and difficult to support someone with depression. Not everyone can do it and anyone can suffer from burnout. Everyone needs to protect their own mental health first or you’re no good to anyone.  So OP, there’s no good way to tell them. Do what you need to do."

CasualConversation,fc7hyiz,t3_egdxlz,1577507998.0,"Iâ€™m guessing from all the outrage in all these replies most of you are all fairly young. I mean below 30. You have every right to be outraged and I hope you all stand firm in your convictions. It surprises me how incensed you all are because I grew up in the 60â€™s and you wouldnâ€™t believe the shit we took for granted back then. My mother wouldnâ€™t pay for me to go to college because I was a girl. Iâ€™m so glad Iâ€™ve lived to see a great improvement. Yes, believe it or not what you are living in gender roles is a great improvement, but we still have far to go so keep up the good fight."
CasualConversation,fc4pyhx,t1_fc4lgf4,1577424237.0,"I havenâ€™t had a very exciting life. Certainly not a wholesome picture perfect family like yours. ( I donâ€™t mean that sarcastically) I guess ours could be a good immigrant story though. My parents came from Italy in 1959. I was 5 at the time. Two months later I started kindergarten and didnâ€™t speak a word of English. Luckily for my parents, my fatherâ€™s sister had been in Canada a few years already so she was helpful in showing them the way of the new world. My mother started work at a grocery store chain where my aunt worked a week after arriving and my dad went to wrk in construction.  Did I mention that we came on a boat? Yup! Iâ€™m an original boat person. 

Five years later my parents bought a house and finished paying for it in 8 years. Imagine doing that today on a labourerâ€™s salary? I donâ€™t know about where you are but houses in Toronto go for over 1 million for a small 3 bedroom. Rent is over $1,800 minimum for a one bedroom apartment. Millennials have a legitimate complaint. 

The rest is pretty average. I married, had two wonderful kids who grew up to be wonderful caring adults.  I divorced 12 years later and raised them on my own. I live with my mother now who will be 89 soon. She has mild dementia and refuses to leave her home. Itâ€™s a challenge. Our upbringing was very different but mainly our values are different too. Thatâ€™s where our heads butt. Itâ€™s all in a days work. Lol. A sense of humour keeps me going. 

Iâ€™m with you.. I hate moaners and whiners. What really gets my goat is when people say, â€œkids today have no respect â€œ or â€œ in my day....â€  you can put on the cranky old man voice when you read that because thatâ€™s how they say it.  Of course I always speak up in defence of â€œkidsâ€ and I get the ole â€œ what planet did you come from â€œ stare. Iâ€™m used to it now. Iâ€™ve always felt like a round peg in a square hole. 

The trouble is that donâ€™t relate at all to people my age. Recently Iâ€™m finding I donâ€™t relate to young people either anymore. I have very few friends and the ones I have are younger than me. So hence my sojourn on Reddit in search of like minded aliens. ( I mean other planets not other countries. Canadians donâ€™t use the term aliens to mean immigrants.) 

Life in Canada is pretty vanilla compared to the U.S.  Half of our news stories are about â€˜The Adventures of Trumpâ€™. For a while they were interesting yet frightening. Now theyâ€™re just frightening. You must be so tired of the shenanigans. ( sorry but Iâ€™m assuming youâ€™re not a Trump supporter because no intelligent person can be and you sound intelligent) 

Hope your holidays were wonderful. Mine absolutely were wonderful in spite of the anxiety I had leading up to Christmas. Iâ€™m enjoying our family gatherings much more as I get older. Having said that, Iâ€™m glad the holidays are over and we can get on to new things in the new year. I looking forward to a week in Mexico in January with my daughter as Iâ€™m not that fond of the cold either."
CasualConversation,fc4ij5j,t3_efyg85,1577417658.0,"Hey old timer, itâ€™s nice to meet someone on here closer to my age. Iâ€™ve only been on Reddit for a couple of months and I feel ancient sometimes.  Iâ€™m 65f and living in beautiful Toronto Canada. I can relate with you about loving the outdoors but I wouldnâ€™t go hiking with you...maybe a few years ago. Iâ€™m more the sit in a comfortable chair in the backyard and talk til the sun sets type. My energy is really low lately but my mind and mouth are still quick. (Donâ€™t take that the wrong way. Lol) 

When I got on Reddit I started looking for subreddits for older people like us and all I found were boomer bashing sites. Donâ€™t get me wrong, I believe like you, that all generations have pros and cons. We grew up in the hippie era. Can you imagine what our parents thought? I have great admiration for the younger generations. It makes me sad when I see this boomer/ millennial feud going on. 

Anyway, I just wanted to say hi. If youâ€™ve found any subs where more  old timers hang out let me know. Thereâ€™s a lot of interesting stuff on here but I have to scroll through tons of kid stuff to find it. 

Have you ever thought about writing about your life? You write a good, readable story ."

AskReddit,fc4epim,t3_efvwzs,1577414509.0,"I donâ€™t think you can conquer depression. Iâ€™ve been trying for over 20 years and itâ€™s a constant roller coaster. The last six months though have been better than any time I can remember. 

One thing I know helps me is vitamin D ( 1000 iu) when I forget for a few days, I immediately feel the difference, like a downward spiral.  Also last month I bought a SAD lamp and use it 30 minutes after I wake  up. I know it has helped me a lot.  Everyone is different but these two things I swear by. Of course I continue to take medication but with that alone I still had really low downswings. 

Good luck to you. Hope you find what works for you."
