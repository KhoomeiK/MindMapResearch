Neil Breen must have some-- for lack of a better term-- talent.  I laughed harder at the first 45 minutes of that movie than I have in maybe a decade.  After that my brain sort of stopped working and I spent the next 45 minutes in a sort of numb silence, similar to a fugue state common to trauma survivors.  

He may not have been trying to make me laugh (I have seen nothing in his work that leads me to believe he is anything other than sincere), and yet does that even matter?  When I watched him slap his junkie girlfriend and then a full second after the slap she fell off the bed, I was in *tears* I was laughing so hard.  Studios spend millions of dollars on very talented people who can't get that reaction out of an audience.  And Breen is doing it on accident."
