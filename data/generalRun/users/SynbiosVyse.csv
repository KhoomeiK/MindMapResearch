thinkpad,ffh88sh,t1_ffh6zh9,1579925920.0,Modern Intel CPUs have been plagued with power issues on Linux for a while now. It took years for Skylake's C-states to be properly supported.
thinkpad,ffh3gsn,t1_ffgt44c,1579922081.0,"Why not look at some AMD thinkpad models? AMD seems to be a first class citizen on Linux, unlike Intel and Nvidia."
redhat,fffqfix,t1_ffdaixk,1579889558.0,This seems like it's a more common scenario. I wonder if there's an upgrade path from 6 to 8 with skipping a release. Probably not as for most migrations it probably means setting up comparable services on a whole new machine for a replacement. Our 7 stuff is not going to get touched until it goes EOL. 10 yr support cycles is part of the motivation behind using RHEL.
datascience,fffq112,t1_fffjahe,1579889308.0,"My two cents, committing ipynb is a pain. Git seems to have trouble with tracking changes because it's a complex structured file. I much prefer plain text files like py so they can be browsed and also easily uploaded onto clusters for computing jobs or called straight from bash. I could be totally biased since I never use Jupyter notebooks."
boston,ffeaz0r,t1_ffdgjfo,1579841690.0,Space savers are just a courtesy. You can move them if you really need a place to park. Very few people are low enough to key your car.
personalfinance,ffc8657,t1_ffbhbfm,1579793748.0,"Consider taking out a loan on your 401k. The terms are a lot more favorable than student loans, it might be a better alternative than selling your house too."

personalfinance,ff5vvoq,t1_ff4o1zv,1579612018.0,I used to have cards that actually said atm card on them and they didn't have the visa or mc logo. They haven't been offered in years though.
personalfinance,ff4pa0t,t1_ff39z63,1579569163.0,"I see this a lot. Maybe it works for you and some people but I found it pretty bad advice for myself.

Edit: I am more frugal than this technique suggests. If I used this technique, I would buy a ton of superfluous things."
datascience,ff4omlu,t3_eripqb,1579568705.0,"How is your pay now compared to when you started? It's good to do a little bit of research by asking around and checking salary sites. However, numbers can vary greatly depending on not only location, but industry (nonprofit, finance, hospital, etc). Most places give about a 3% COL raise per year so you could aim for 5-10%. Otherwise you'll need to start applying and get another offer.  


Search around advice on how to ask for a raise, there are tons of resources for that even for shy people."

datascience,ff4geah,t3_erdwff,1579562976.0,"What you're looking for is Apache Drill. Start the embedded engine and then do a SQL query on the  tsv file. You'll get it going in 10 minutes.

If it's too slow (20TB is pretty big), you can eventually distribute the files with HDFS and/or distribute the query engine with more Drillbits."
datascience,ff2q17c,t1_ff2fotf,1579518732.0,"Production does not mean everything that's not a Kaggle exercise. There are development/prototyping systems, after which algorithms get pushed up to production."
datascience,ff22wgo,t1_ff226v3,1579492334.0,Interesting I never had a query more than a few dozen lines (at the PEP8 80 char limit per line) but I guess I could imagine it.
datascience,ff1y9uk,t1_ff1oe7f,1579488951.0,I could be wrong but it doesn't really make sense to me why you would do multiple queries and then join later. You don't save any memory by loading datasets simultaneously and performing a join.

washingtondc,fep66sk,t1_fep1116,1579313024.0,I've been saying this from the very beginning. 5A was underrated.
linux_gaming,fencutp,t1_fen4x6x,1579281964.0,"i3, Celeron, Chromebooks have a variety of CPUs, really. Chromebook Pixel even had up to an i7 but it's been discontinued."

todayilearned,femp92y,t1_fem7zdw,1579265480.0,Yes but nobody is arguing freight. We're talking about passenger rail.
boston,fem2ujw,t1_fegk0s0,1579237921.0,I got so confused because 753 South closed down years ago. I see there's a new place there now and retained the old name.
boston,fem2jx6,t1_fegrdaz,1579237651.0,"It's just like going to a bunch of car dealerships. You see all the latest cars and get to sit in them and check them out. There's not too many supercars, but a few. Mostly typical Volvo, Chevy, Ford, etc. They might have their top of the line models but plenty of regular stuff too."
boston,fem28s0,t3_ep2wvh,1579237368.0,"WPI is the most rigorous of the bunch mentioned. UMass Amherst is the best value.

Apply to 7 schools or so and see what kind of financial package they get. Student loans is a critical factor nowadays.

Here's my anecdotal rating for comp engineering: MIT, WPI, BU, Amherst, NEU, Wentworth, Lowell."
todayilearned,felxgor,t1_felulyi,1579233397.0,"Not really. Nobody wanted to be in the passenger train business in the US. The only major player is Amtrak which is government run, because it's not profitable. If it were private it would literally be unsustainable outside of the Northeast corridor. These 3-day train rides from Illinois to California have profit margins close to -$1000/passenger."
thinkpad,felwxzc,t1_fel3vqx,1579233012.0,Not really now that eink exists. Best bet is probably the Remarkable or something similar.

matlab,fei50so,t3_ep8kv5,1579130426.0,That's going to depend on the algorithm you want to implement. Can you rephrase the question?

datascience,feh8a72,t3_ep3ida,1579111206.0,"Google hasn't open sourced their most powerful technology, like Dremel. In fact most things you think of Google opensource were acquired by Google and were already opensource, like Android."

You either crash something on purpose or by accident. Unless the driver intentionally crashed into the truck, this was an accident."
VFIO,feh6tfc,t1_fefqix0,1579110352.0,"It seems like your problem has little to do with passthrough, and more to do with configuring your main machine properly."
VFIO,fefn632,t3_eoso2t,1579059967.0,"Your question is very confusing to me. In the title you're asking if you can run CUDA in the host and in the body you're using it in the guest.

If you're doing passthrough and you have 2 GPUs you should be fine though and use it in both. If your VM is setup, why would you have to set it up again if you change the host?

Are you using conda to manage everything? It should manage cuda for you to match your nvidia driver version."
thinkpad,feexhjn,t1_feegajv,1579043352.0,Probably a mistake. It would be listed in the PSREF as a configurable option. You could check there.
thinkpad,feef15l,t1_fee7qqd,1579032415.0,Yeah I wish Lenovo would make a screen like that. Plus the new XPS has a 16:10 screen making it even better. We can only dream.
thinkpad,fee4h6q,t1_fee2sdt,1579026207.0,"That's correct. That's why the Dell XPS is praised for a 3200x1800 screen. At 2x scaling its 1600x900 effective with a 13.3 inch screen. Nice!

The MacBook is 2560x1600 which results in 1280x800 on a 13.3 inch at 2x. A little too big for most. Their algorithm is good for fractions, but it uses a lot more GPU power to compute those fractional cases. On windows and Linux, it usually results in some bug somewhere along the line: blurriness, a button that doesn't look quite right, etc."

You obviously like the original PPI target of around 125. A 14 inch FHD has a PPI of 157, so that's actually pretty high.

It's perfectly fine to switch PPI depending on your distance and what you're doing. You could also use 100% and increase font."

RealEstate,fdtkews,t3_emzjak,1578718033.0,This sounds legit. No realtors is advantageous to both parties. Why does that make you concerned? Realtors help you find a place and you already found it so you don't need one. Nor does the seller need one to find a buyer in this case.
