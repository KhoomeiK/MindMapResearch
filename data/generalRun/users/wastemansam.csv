Bitcoin,fexlski,t1_fewvd7x,1579433091.0,"You shouldn't focus on the 10% since there is a limit to the maximum number of transactions in a day and that was reached at the time, clearly the number of actual transactions attempting to be made was much higher than 10% above current volume. That limit is now slightly higher, but not enough to cope with the transaction volume at ATH hence it would be almost as bad as I originally said. Even with stupidly optimal circumstances (all 1 input, 1 output using segwit for an avg tx size of 166vbytes) only about 900k txs a day can be processed and lightning network is not currently suitable to alleviate the volume of on chain txs"
Bitcoin,fewlico,t1_feva0d6,1579413649.0,">With each halving, miners gain less Bitcoin from block rewards, and will likely require higher transaction fees to make up for the difference.

This is the only statement you made that appears to be correct.

&#x200B;

The last bitcoin will be mined over 100 years from now, trying to predict anything about what will happen is almost impossible due to the fact there will be many updates to bitcoin code and a shift in global circumstances by then, not least trying to predict what the value of BTC will be.

"" If the price of Bitcoin stays below the price necessary to justify mining for too long (block reward + transaction fee), then less miners will run their rigs & the entire block-chain could be at risk.""

Then difficulty adjusts and the blockchain keeps running. As long as any 2 parties wish to use the blockchain it will be possible (barring any kind of difficulty bomb, which shouldn't be an issue as the block reward tapers off so slowly, a sudden loss in hash power would be a bigger issue now than if we reach 21M coins)

""I think Nakamoto reserved their initial Bitcoins for 2 reasons:

**1.** To show how un-hackable the private keys & encryption system is (as their large sum of Bitcoins & wallet vanity is a giant target).

**2.** If additional Bitcoins are necessary to sustain mining operations, they have a supply to work with.""

If Nakamoto is not already dead they will be by 2144 so unless this is a multi-generational plan I don't think he'll be topping up block rewards from the personal stash. Plus the idea is nonsense anyhow as it's difficult to implement (even with zombie satoshi existing), and if the solution is decided to be to inflate the bitcoin supply dramatically why not just fork?

&#x200B;

The reason I didn't type all this out before is because there is a certain threshold for nonsense that doesn't even justify a reply and you met it."
Bitcoin,feu8bpj,t1_feu7p9j,1579384134.0,One problem is that graph is confirmed transactions and the issue during ATH was txs weren't confirming.
Bitcoin,feu6gti,t1_feu5mnz,1579383573.0,"Not a single exchange I care to use has implemented it unfortunately. If they had I would probably use it. Although nearly all make money with fees on withdrawing crypto. Their only incentive is to implement it to attract users, the fact that exchanges that have implemented it are not the most popular shows that the userbase at large does not value it yet. It could just be a chicken before egg problem. If decentralized exchanges were more popular there'd be merit in trying to build one on lightning."

Testnet addresses are not valid on the main blockchain so your trading party could not have sent you bitcoins on chain. You need to give them a valid receiving address so they can send you your coins.

I would like to understand how a noob even accidentally puts electrum in testnet mode, and I worry you may have downloaded a malicious wallet. Could you confirm what you did to install electrum?"
