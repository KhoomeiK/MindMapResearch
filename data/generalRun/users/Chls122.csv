Destin,feyvzd8,t3_eqpejd,1579451116.0,"I'm a local so I don't know anything about the hotels. There are more condos than there are hotels. As far as something to do besides the beach, there are guided fishing tours, and glass bottom boats for dolphin tours. If you are interested in history and are willing to drive a little, Fort Pickens in Pensacola is neat. It will rain when you are here, as it rains every single afternoon May - September, and there is an AMC theater at the Destin Commons, and a New Vision theater on Grand Blvd (Miramar Beach, FL). There's one museum in Destin, the Destin History and Fishing Museum. There's an Indian Temple Mound Museum not far from Destin. There are loads of local places to eat and I highly encourage you to try some of these places; there is a HUGE difference between fresh seafood and frozen seafood. If you have an interest in military history, there's an excellent Armament Museum in Fort Walton, and the Pensacola Naval Air Museum in Pensacola (I'm not sure if there are limitations due to the recent active shooter incident so you may need to look into this)."

Destin,fdqegq5,t3_emm41z,1578664546.0,There's not really an off season here. There's a few weeks around late September and early October that would be the least busy but there's still plenty of people around.  For the rest of the year it's more busy and then ramps up to very busy doing the summer. There's plenty of residents in the area that make trips out to Destin during the less busy time. There may be some small businesses that support beach activities and will close for our winter everything else is open.

amiwrong,fdinrjy,t1_fdimtzf,1578447020.0,There's bad blood between divorced parents sometimes. The term stolen was used in the original post. I was using it in my comment to get them to ask their dad about the money. Money made by one parent does not automatically become the other parent's money when given to the kid. No matter which house they are residing in.

amiwrong,fdingcx,t1_fdim8ux,1578446822.0,"from his/her/their perspective it was stolen (which is perfectly fine for them to feel that way). I think getting their other parent involved is the first step. If their father wants him/her/them to have the money to use on whatever they wish then that should be sufficient for them to get that from their mother. Their mom does not seem very open to giving the money back. Feels a bit red flag-ish (maybe a big yellow flag here).

From my personal experience, I come from a broken home. My own mother would take the money my dad gave me as well, so I had to be in the habit of spending it before I went back to her house, or she would take it and use it on her own stuff (mostly alcohol, cigarettes, bail money for his shitty b/fs). My dad had a college fund set up for me that my mom stole and I ended up paying my own way and apply for scholarships and stuff. My dad was ROYALLY PISSED when he found out but the money was long gone by the time he found out. If I had told him sooner, maybe there would have been more time for him to open a new savings account for me.. I don't know if that is what is happening here, but it feels similar"

raisedbynarcissists,fd5nfzm,t3_ek0lbr,1578179375.0,"I've been NC with my nmom since March, and she texted my husband on Christmas eve that she was coming over (she did not ask). I asked him to text her back and ask that she not come here and to not give us anything. Then she calls my dad (who lives with me) and she tells him that she's on her way and will be here in a few minutes. I hid in the back room while she showed up at our house and gave my husband two gift bags. At least she didn't barge in or anything. Gave me a pair of house slippers, I didn't look in the bag and was ready to just toss it out but my husband opened it up. There are some serious reasons I don't speak to her anymore, that deal with some childhood trauma that I don't wish to think about anymore. Her showing up at my house was not just pushing the boundaries I have set up but also triggered all the stress of having zero privacy, control, autonomy. I cried for awhile after she left. I'm seriously thinking about moving somewhere else."
