Health fees, wage gap fees, benefit fees, Kitchen Fees, Admin fees, Living Wage Fees, Climate Change fees (I kid you not!!!), service charges, surcharge (yes, just a vague ""more money fee).    This is complete Bullshit.  Restaurants have always had to pay a fair wage to keep employees just like any other business. Nothing has changed except restaurants for some reason think they should be exempt from paying for their rising costs.   But just like supermarkets expect you to check and bag your groceries and then take your cart across the parking lot to find a corral, restaurants are shifting their costs onto their guests.  If you see one of these silly signs on the menu, politely walk out.  If you don't know about a scam charge until you get the bill, refuse to pay it.

The airplane I fly now allows .023 gallons  an hour but if I ever saw anything near that I would go to a bar not the cockpit.  While this is the maximum, it would scare the hell out of me if my airplane was burning that.  So if you burned more that a quart every 3 hours, you were exceeding limitations.  Assuming you changed oil at 50 hour intervals, I suppose you would go through 17 quarts before a change.  The sump holds 6 quarts.  I have thousands of hours behind an O-235.  Oil consumption was never an issue.  But then they were overhauled at 2400 hours and were still pretty strong."

napa,fez62wt,t1_fexebl1,1579454155.0,Seemed you were the one doing the Socialist thing about inequality and voting to take the money from landowners by artificially holding down the price of rent increases.  And harassing innocent businesses by picketing them for paying too much for rent when the rent has been raised on the last tenant and they leave.  I'm just saying it sucks but the place has become desirable to too many people which has pushed up the desire to be here which increases land values.  And getting government involved in that just stops improvement and building and leads to the problems San Francisco has.  The economic forces cause an inequality.  Tourists don't have to pay a normal price for a meal.  This is their big splurge of the year.  And we have to compete with them for a seat in a restaurant.  I don't know a cure for that.  Maybe charge each tourist passing a checkpoint into the city $100.  Oh.  And I've lived here for 46 years and was born in California.

""Concealment"" for instance is illegal in some states and legal in others until the person gets outside.  Check your state laws if you really want to know what you can do in your store.  In California, a law was passed to make real shoplifting just a misdemeanor.  Shoplifting has skyrocketed.  The street people just laugh at that.
