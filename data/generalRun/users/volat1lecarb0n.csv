SuicideWatch,ffv406i,t1_ffub3ek,1580255146.0,"You’re right it is subjective and everyone’s experiences and reason are different. I definitely had moments where I also wished it worked. There is no permanent state of “happiness”, at least not for me personally. Just good days and bad days...on those good days or even in those good moments I’m glad I’m still here. In the bad ones I reach out and try to find something to latch on to as a reason to keep going. 

I hope you find some happiness, even if it’s fleeting."
depression,ffu7gra,t3_ev46y3,1580236096.0,That’s awesome! It’s uplifting to hear about any success or bright moments.
bipolar,ffu7ble,t3_ev8qhq,1580236012.0,Love it! And a creative idea to get motivated/cope. I wish I was that good at make up.
SuicideWatch,ffu47ix,t1_fftyxwb,1580234135.0,"Yes. There is. In moments where I am enjoying a new hobby, a trip somewhere new, time with friends or a loved one, I feel grateful that my attempt 10 years ago didn’t kill me. I feel relieved that I got this far, even though it’s really ridiculously rocky sometimes. 

You’ll never know unless you keep going."
SuicideWatch,ffu3vec,t3_ev30fz,1580233924.0,"Sometimes one of the biggest reasons I choose to stay alive is because my cat and dog would miss me. They both have health/behavior issues and need someone understanding and loving to care for them. 

I also list the things I could never do if I’m dead. I can’t see my pets anymore. I’ll never know what it would be like to have a family. I’ll never get to see the places I’ve always wanted to see. 

It’s hard feeling like nothing matters and feeling completely dispassionate about life in general, but when you start thinking about more possibilities little glimmers or motivation start to appear. 

I don’t know if any of those things sound useful to you but I hope you hold on."
WomensHealth,ff9kr1b,t1_ff8tx7a,1579715071.0,Yes I am! Thank you! I just wanted to give you a heads to keep it in mind. Also the stones may not be evident in an x-ray of your kidney if they are passing. It’s good to find primary care doctor who can keep track of your symptoms and give you any referrals. ER and urgent care can miss things and don’t know your whole medical history.
SuicideWatch,ff4pb8j,t3_erd49e,1579569187.0,"Don’t feel bad for needing help right now. I used to work at a suicide hotline and then ended up having to call one for help myself a couple times. Everyone has ups and downs. 

You are wonderful for any time you have given to helping others. Thank you, truly.

Now it’s time to take care of yourself. Your life is worth just as much as anyone else’s. I would never want to take a moment of life and the potential for happiness away from another person no matter what happens to me. We all want you to be okay too. You deserve life and to feel safe and to have hope."
WomensHealth,ff4o8d2,t3_erip8c,1579568424.0,"Is there any chance you have kidney stones? I kept getting misdiagnosed with UTIs and menstrual issues due to my age, then it turned out I was passing kidney stones (why the pain was in the lower back and lower abdomen area). The stones passing could lead to potential infections/fever as well as nausea and vomiting."
WomensHealth,ff43429,t3_ergzp6,1579554496.0,I had similar problems with always pads. Definitely try pads with different material (Cora or stay free are brands that are softer) or thinx period underwear.
ABA,fep77z7,t3_eqa618,1579313691.0,"Dress pants you can move in (or khakis and black jeans depending on company rules), flats (Oxford shoes are great). Avoid sandals. Avoid scarves or dangling jewelry. Any top will do as long as it’s not a t-shirt, spaghetti strap, crop top, or see through."
ABA,fcma0da,t1_fcm3wkk,1577768302.0,It’s reassuring to know trial and error is part of process. Thank you!
