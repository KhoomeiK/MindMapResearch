You can’t just discount things you don’t like if you expect people who didn’t like the last two polls to act rationally when they were showed those polls. 

That’s hypocritical. Which is the charge everyone laid on those who supported the name change after the last two polls. 

Berkeley is a great school. And they take scientific research (even the soft sciences) seriously. What university would make you believe this poll? 

Granted the “people who strongly identify as Native American” plus the fact that they don’t have a methodology posted makes it hard to take 100% seriously.

I don’t care one way or another. I’m fairly certain a name change is inevitable. Maybe not with this owner, but it will happen. I personally don’t think it should, but I’m also not Native American, I’m not going to get offended for them, but if they are overwhelmingly offended I think that’s their right and they should have some say here.
