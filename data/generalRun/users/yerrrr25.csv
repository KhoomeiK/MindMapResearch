depression,ff4o4y5,t3_ererwo,1579568357.0,I really felt this the past couple of months and  almost successfully killed myself if i hadn’t gone to the emergency room. But after realistically facing death i realized that deep down i want to live. And knowing deep down somewhere that i want to live even though i feel like dying every second of the day is enough to keep going. I know that deep down i don’t want to die so i should stop wasting all of my headspace with suicidal ideation. My life is still fucking garbage but killing myself isn’t the answer.
depression,fdcm4p3,t3_ekndnp,1578278326.0,I greatly relate i couldn’t afford the school i was going to so i had to transfer and after i transferred life isn’t exciting I’m just living to get a college degree at this point. Every weekend in highschool was amazing and now my weekends are bleh.
Advice,fd5xnwo,t3_ek4sbj,1578182803.0,Bro I’m in a very similar boat can u message me and we can talk about it?
depression,fcwoaqd,t1_fcwn6a1,1578031455.0,"Maybe in the future if i can get rid of my suicidal thoughts and terrible depression . But I’m just comparing every other girl to her and nobody meets those standards. But if you are scared of getting treated like shit again then u should definitely try out a relationship but make sure you let the next girl know you want something for the long haul, no matter what life throws at you guys. I didn’t make that clear enough in my last relationship and now my ex is a complete slut who has no problem getting treated like shit by frat dudes and would rather be a used up piece of human garbage than be with a loving and caring man."
depression,fcwn31n,t1_fcwmx7p,1578030336.0,"I wasn’t trying to bring back memories of ur pain I’m sorry i did that. But yes she treated me like dog shit and justified it. Every holiday passed and i didn’t even get a happy thanksgiving. Merry Christmas, or happy new year. When the ball dropped i was hysterically crying because i lost her and she spent the night at a frat party making out with other guys."
depression,fcovbcd,t3_ei83fr,1577842557.0,I’ve decided tomorrow will probably be the day i do it. Thanks for your support guys!
depression,fcmmj1x,t1_fcmmgg8,1577781644.0,I like to think those actually happen. Very rarely so sudden drastic things happen that actually make life better. When something happens quickly it’s usually devastating
depression,fcmgwyp,t3_ehunym,1577774825.0,Update* just found out she’s already on tinder using pictures i took of her. I am NOT doing wel now.
depression,fclof96,t1_fclnoa7,1577752579.0,It’s just crazy how i was on top of the world a few months ago and now I’m in the darkest of places. I think about dying all the time because it’s the only thing that gives me hope that the pain will end.
depression,fclnf0y,t1_fclmwme,1577751892.0,"I’m extremely depressed, in this state i see no way out. I’m taking it day by day but each day is way worse than the last. I can’t ever forgive myself for the things I’ve done. I can’t forget the past. I can’t move on in life. All I’ve been doing is taking sleeping pills and laying in bed all day. I don’t know what to do anymore"
