AmItheAsshole,ffmguyv,t3_eu5q5j,1580054488.0,"NTA When I was 18 I was still living at home but worked full time while going to school full time. I had my own health insurance at my job. I remember getting so damn excited to do my own taxes and seeing if aid get anything back as a refund. My mom claimed me as a dependent and I was t able to file my own taxes. I was pissed. I moved out soon after. I was making 10$ an hour which for me was a hell of a lot of money. I had a roommate and our expenses weren’t huge so we were doing fine. My mom told me in HS that if I went to college I wouldn’t have to pay rent or utilities living at home. So that’s why I stayed. It wasn’t until she then decided well you have to pay half of this or half of that that I was like fuck this, If I’m paying half of something I’ll do it where I won’t be under your thumb. So found a place a couple weeks later packed up my shit and left and never have been back living with her. She was all mopey and crying when I left that day but like , nah. Don’t play sad mom while also trying to spring all these new bills on my ass after agreeing to zero expenses since I was going to college like you wanted me to do."
