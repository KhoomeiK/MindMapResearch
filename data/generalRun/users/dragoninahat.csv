Do these people think that it is good and proper parenting to let a kid have 100% of their food choices, so if they want 5 cookies before dinner or a bag of candy they would? Cause I'd have gone to town on a whole bag of marshmallows as a kid...I mean I still would some days if I didn't have self control..."
fatlogic,fdzc5b2,t3_en3n2o,1578788703.0,"I love these grand pronouncements made as though they don't need evidence behind them. ""Your JOB is to..."" and ""Be better"" and ""I am going to help you be a better person."" It always feels weirdly cultlike to me."
fatlogic,fdzbpp6,t1_fdxmkeo,1578788549.0,"I think it's less ""you have to like pop music, it's a sacred cow"" and more that going out of your way to comment on how you don't like popular things can come off as pretentious. Along the lines of ""I don't watch TV, it's pablum for the masses"" or ""I would never step food in a fast food restaurant with my rarified tastes."""
fatlogic,eluoin8,t1_eluc03f,1556302819.0,"My guess is that it's allowed because NOT allowing it gets other parents up in arms about restricting what their child can buy, it's the parent who should be choosing and who is the school to say 5 bags of chips isn't appropriate?!"
