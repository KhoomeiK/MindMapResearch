Foodforthought,ffs1yn6,t1_ffrqy9z,1580171156.0,"It really depends on what you mean by ""capitalism"". A lot of people seem to mean and market-based system, but of course markets were an essential part of all major economies long before anyone came up with the idea of capitalism. The dictionary definition is only moderately helpful:

>an economic and political system in which a  country's trade and industry are controlled by private owners for  profit, rather than by the state

What's left unstated in that definition, and which I consider a key part of capitalism, is that economic policies are made for favor the interests of capital owners over everyone else, which mostly means refusing to enact regulations are inconvenient to business owners.

Personally I think the way forward is tax wealth and/or income at a high enough rate that it's simply not possible for anyone's net worth to exceed some reasonable amount\*. I think that alone would fix a lot of problems, because then there would be nobody who could use their wealth to exert and undue influence on politics through ~~lobbying~~ ~~campaign donations~~ bribery, propaganda, etc. We'd have politicians who represent the voters much better, and we'd have better voters because there would be nobody like Rupert Murdoch who could spend vast sums of money convincing people that up is down and black is white.

\*I intentionally didn't specify how much a ""reasonable"" amount would be. It might be as little as a few million dollars or as much as a billion, but I think the important thing at this point is to just sell people on the idea that allowing a handful of people to amass huge fortunes creates far more problems than it solves."

rust,ffr4lky,t1_ffr3sif,1580150334.0,"It's not undefined at all. A dimension is something like distance, mass, or duration. Every unit has a dimension, and you can only convert between units of the same dimension.

From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimensional_analysis):
>The concept of physical dimension was introduced by Joseph Fourier in 1822. Physical quantities that are of the same kind (also called commensurable) (e.g., length or time or mass) have the same dimension and can be directly compared to other physical quantities of the same kind (i.e., length or time or mass, resp.), even if they are originally expressed in differing units of measure (such as yards and meters). If physical quantities have different dimensions (such as length vs. mass), they cannot be expressed in terms of similar units and cannot be compared in quantity (also called incommensurable). For example, asking whether a kilogram is larger than an hour is meaningless."
