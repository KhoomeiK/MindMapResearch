Rationally I'm not angry at the person who has clearly never lifted sitting on the machine I want for 20 minutes, or the dude who really, really needs to do 9 sets of incline presses incrementing by 10 lbs each set.

But irrationally it bugs the shit out of me. Louis CK had a bit about this how we all think we are so important and have a dramatic ""what is the meaning of this?!"" righteous indignation internally about minor setbacks. Well, I find myself asking ""what is the meaning of this"" quite a bit lately."

In fact I would bet good money that if you feed two groups 4000 calories a day until they hit morbid obesity and one is mostly fat and protein and the other mostly sugar, the sugar group would have more instances of T2D."
fatlogic,ff7h46i,t1_ff54p7e,1579649414.0,"Yeah, and they seem to think baseless, faux condescension is a strong argument.

Then when she is driving to dr Now she stops for fast food first and said she hopes it gets her halfway there. I immediately predicted she wouldn't get 2 hours without more food, then it said "" 2 hrs later.."".

Then she just straight up lies after her first weigh in. Protein bars, lol. I was surprised Dr Now let her outright lie like that, I hope he's not losing his feistiness after dealing with these people so long."

running,fdrktd8,t3_emuope,1578685896.0,"I'm about 250 and I make a concerted effort to keep my feet under me, which typically means a midfoot strike. When you're taking long strides at my weight you're jamming your momentum through your knees which is not good.

So I take pretty short strides, speed controlled mostly through cadence. I don't look very cool running with the nice high back-kick and pretty stride, but my goal is to someday be at best a middle of the packer so it's fine.

So I'd say yes, landing on the middle or ball of your foot is fine."
VacuumCleaners,fdriog0,t3_eildny,1578685114.0,BB&B has sales on the Mieles and the 20% coupon stacks.. just got a Compact C1 turbo team for $319.

So I go watch her live performance, and she stands in place, does some light bouncing back and forth, and periodically turns around and bends over to a 25 degree angle to 'twerk'.

running,fdo7p12,t3_emec48,1578600330.0,"You can do some envelope calculations.. If you get down to, say, 160 which would put you down to a healthy, mid-range BMI (depending of course on your muscle mass) you would be burning almost 100 calories a day less than you are now, so roughly 1lb less of weight loss assuming a consistent diet every 5 weeks compared to what you see now.

If you're losing at a faster pace than that now, you will continue to lose at 160. But I doubt it's going to be much, throw in an extra banana and some cashews every day and you'll probably cover it and maintain stasis. It's not like you'll have to struggle to cram food in your mouth every day like Michael Phelps or The Mountain from GoT ;)"
fatlogic,fdmce1i,t1_fdlljtk,1578545454.0,"Yeah, as in my diatribe above I'm pretty sure it's a big solipsistic joke on me. There is literally no way people can think she is good, but apparently they do. I gave it an honest try, I really did, though I only watched a few of her live performances.

And what's with the ""She flutes, dances, twerks, runs around stage for 8 hours every day 400 days a year, let's see you do that!!"" talking point everyone trots out? I watched her perform live, she just kind of rocks back and forth a bit and walks around the stage, her ""twerking"" seems to just be turning around and bending over a bit. I am not at all shocked that a woman of her size can do that."
fatlogic,fdmc4vz,t1_fdlo81b,1578545241.0,"I have been hearing about Lizzo, like everyone else, for a while. So I went and watched a few of her performances, I like some hip-hop, pop, rock, electro, all kinds of shit, everyone raves about her so I gave it a try.

I'm pretty sure the world is gaslighting me now. I am being gaslit. There is no other explanation. It's absolutely fucking horrible. She gets up there and rap-yell-sings some bullshit that all sounds like some variation of ""I'm amazing and I have to keep saying it or no one will believe me"". And sometimes that's fine, I like a little ""I'm a real badass"" rap now and then. But this is just bad.

I had a literal comical horror-face look on my face when I watched but the people in the audience were seemingly enjoying it.

Now, what does this have to do with fatlogic, you ask? Lizzo is fatlogic absolutely fucking personified. Pure self delusion, shared delusion, style over substance nonsense. If you can feign narcissism well enough then so can I. I don't have to improve myself, fuck it I can just sloppily vocalize and shamelessly shake my ass and that will prove how much I love myself. Much easier than self control, reaching for personal goals, all that nonsense.. I can just ""I'm that bitch!"" myself to happiness and all the people who share my delusion will reinforce it."
fatlogic,fdm9bdf,t3_em3u4k,1578543032.0,"Saw that one. For evidence they refer to a link that literally says ""However, don’t lose heart. Studies show that it is possible to delay or prevent type 2 diabetes by exercising and losing weight.""

I really don't understand how a person can be that completely bereft of basic common knowledge. Some people who are very fat indeed won't get T2. Some people who smoke their whole fucking lives live to be 90. Neither changes the 100% facts that obesity is a huge risk factor and cause of T2 diabetes and smoking is very likely to kill you.

Also there's bonus ""but I know a thin person who got it, therefor obesity means nothing"" fatlogic in there as well. Just like non-smokers get lung cancer sometimes."
running,fdl5qwj,t1_fdl51j6,1578517510.0,"Seems those are the two camps - RPE vs HR. I do HR because it's 'objective'. Now, I'm well aware that though the number is objective my performance on any given day at, say, 140BPS will be different based on many factors. However, this is a feature not a bug. If I'm feeling crappy, tired, or sore then I \_should\_ slow down.

I like being able to see clear, identifiable trends over time for like vs like runs, RPE doesn't get me that. Does it make me a better runner vs just RPE? Dunno, but it suits my nerdiness and gives me something to focus on while I run which I like. I'm hooked up like a cyberpunk novel hero (watch, HR strap, footpod, headphones, shit if they were cheaper I'd get a MOXY sensor) when I go out and run and it doesn't bother me, others may not like that."

The answer is you pay what you're fucking able. Base your max out of pocket on your income. If you are homeless, it's $0. If you make $25k a year, maybe your expenses are capped at $1k a year, if you make $150k a year maybe expenses capped at $7k a year, all the way up to say $50k if you make $1M+.

Trump isn't interested in occupying the middle east. If they openly attack US citizens or military targets he will just dump bombs on them until they capitulate.

I mean, we do it for a reason and I'm sure by not doing it we will pay a price later but Trump plays glue-eating checkers, not chess so what does he care?

This was a strike on a terrorist literally in the midst of doing terrorist shit on Iraqi (not Iranian) soil. If Iran wants to go to war over that then they are way too dangerous to allow anywhere near nuclear weapons and I guess we better have this shit out now rather than later.
