Riley is a wonderfully talented athlete. Unfortunately, she cannot be ""relied"" on to perform consistently on her best events when she's needed.

Why SHOULD they have to feel unsafe because someone suffering from addiction feels it's a great place to shoot up? There comes a time where the public is JUST DONE. And we've reached it. There is nothing new about a few ""bad seeds"" ruining it for everyone, but closing a church shelter program is seriously a wake up call. It is horrible to lose these beds because addicts continue to put themselves and others at risk (without realizing it, I imagine), but that's the thing about social nets. They only work if society is on board. And it seems like Waterloo Region just isn't. See I thought the old court house would be absolutely ideal. Right next to WRPS. Put a shelter and services there. No go, but don't worry, a massive condo complex on the corner is surely less disruptive, right? Gentrification is here and the city isn't going to spend money on the homeless issue outside of increased policing and a token amount of beds. They just aren't interested.

Went to court and after first day of trial she admitted she made it up because she was jealous of my relationship with my parents.

Meanwhile, my Dad's legal bill was 17K, and her family immediately filed for bankruptcy a week after, so we couldn't pursue them civilly. They were legit poor, so wouldn't have made a difference.

Comes out later she had done the same thing before.

She's been married, divorced, and the kicker is her current common law husband is her ex-husband's friend's FATHER. Heinous."

Gymnastics,fcp1wkt,t1_fcp13cm,1577847944.0,"Jade should have a specialist spot as that is the entire idea of the specialist spots, to earn a medal. Jade shouldn't be part of the 4 member team. You want to maximize medal chances, so you need 4 members that could all put up high scores on all events. I don't see McKayla doing that, unless they took 3 AA'ers and whoever had the highest scoring potential on their highest 3 events, etc. 

Jade's spot is hers. You can't just substitute whomever. 

I think the highest potential if we took out Biles would be Lee, Hurd, Wong and McCallum, assuming all of them had their highest scores. It also gives the best potential team score.

Eaker serves no purpose on a 3 up 3 count team as an alternate. She can't vault and her floor is weak. MyKayla is the logical choice for alternate, unless she is better than Wong, Hurd or McCallum come Trials.

But for the fun of thinking up a team without Biles, Lee, Wong, McCallum and ""whoever"" is the best choice, imo."

Re: McKayla Maroney and her variant of the same twisting to double back, she really just liked doing that pass.

Sometimes gymnasts do what they like or are comfortable competing, versus something that could give them a better score, because hit ratio, in the end, matters for confidence.

I had a very pretty free hip hecht on bars. Looked amazing, definitely more difficult than the simple squat transition I did most of the time. Plain and simple, I hated jamming my fingers on the free hip hecht if it wasn't perfect and I was a tad over on the blind catch, and so it just wasn't worth potentially smushing my fingers.

No other reason. I just hated stubbing/jamming my fingers on it."
