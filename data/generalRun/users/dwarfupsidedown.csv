Dogtraining,ffdybvw,t3_et1kkq,1579831968.0,"I wouldnt do it. One day the dog might snap even though they get along. Then you come down the stairs and see a dead bird on the floor and a dog just looking at you like ""why you look so sad. What did i do?"" If it was your bird and your dog might be easier but maybe its just me but ive never been able to control prey drive. I have been able to tell my dog to ""leave it"" and he wont chase the rabbit. But i have to command him before he decides to bolt"

dogs,feva4mi,t3_eqh1nr,1579394988.0,Ye i think he just needs to expell energy maybe its on the hunt for a smell or likes to travel. If the owner is relying on you to expell all its energy then idk where you work or how it works but maybe try running with the dog to expell its energy. Regardless of what type of dog they are always more receptive after they expell energy

dogs,feg0wyp,t1_fefw11y,1579072209.0,I have done exactly this except on my back. My dog had a 4 letter name so i put the name in the 4 paw pads and the year of birth and death under the paw.  The tattoo artist even captured the little bit of hair prints from under his paw. I printed my dog on my back. I wanted to carry him on my back the same way i felt he carried me on his back through this crazy thing called life

dogs,fefzvtj,t3_eox1fx,1579071030.0,"I feel you my dog was my everything he was the type to follow me everywhere when i got home. We Did everything together. My best friend. I was the main care taker. I still remember him start to wag his tail as i walked in the room and saw me, only to lay down on the floor beside him as the vet put him down. Saddest day of my life. But i would relive it again just to spend those last moments with my dog. They say your life flashes before your eyes before you die. Lets just say in that moment i relived my life with my dog in a matter of seconds"
dogs,fefzkdy,t3_eoxvm5,1579070673.0,You did nothing wrong. Your dog is normal. Ypur breeder just made you feel bad becauae she felt insulted. And it wasnt your fault to make her feel insulted.
dogs,fefzafz,t3_eoxxz2,1579070368.0,"Other than the barking at the door which ive experienced with this breed of all sizes.

dogs,fefyvlb,t3_eox3lu,1579069923.0,All i can say is try bones or playing fetch or dog parks if you want him to expell energy. My dog use to destroy every toy i bought him toi if i wasnt playing with him with the toy. Sometimes dog just destroy toys out of bordom because no one is interacting and engaging the dog with the play of the toy
dogs,fefyiyf,t1_fefqqc7,1579069548.0,I agree. If possible its much more reasonable to keep the food out for a monitored time under your supervision and then take it away after a while. That way your dog knows this will only be there for x amount of time l. So i better eat. Dogs like a scheduled day anyways. This will just be part of the scehdual
dogs,fefy560,t3_eodqb5,1579069143.0,"I had to put my dog down suddenly as in i woke up at 10 am and it was a normal day by 1pm my dog had been put down by the vet for life threatening medical reasons. My dog was healthy he got checked out two months ago. It was a normal day. But my dog got taken away in a matter of hours. He was 12 years old. My best friend. But at the end of the day, for anyone that has lost a dog. As long as your conscious allows it. Just know you gave the dog the best life it could be provided and if your anything like me you would do it again in a heartbeat"

dogs,fefxjxz,t3_eomrod,1579068527.0,"Puppyhood is the best part of having a dog. That is. If you have the time to commit. Just like a kid. The fact that when the dog is a puppy you can use every moment to mold the dog with the behaviours your want. Watch it grow. Watch it enjoy life. Its really beautiful. When people get dogs you have to except the good and the bad. And sometimes in the beginning there is more bad than good. But the more you invest with fixing the ""bad"" in the the short term, the more benefits on having a dog you will receive. Just like anything in life. The more effort you put into a task the more rewards you will reap. Its sad that people dont understand this. Having a dog in my life is the one thing i will never regret."

Aquariums,fcwwgb2,t1_fcwl7jm,1578040519.0,Like the person said google is your best friend also knowledge from your local pet store is great. Best way to learn though is just get into the hobby you learn things quickest in the moment. For example why is there green algae in my tank u google it and solve the problem. Why are there a buncha snails in my tank i didnt put in there google it. Solve the problem and now you know for next time. As long as you have a cycled tank just give it a go or maybe im just a fan of trail and error
