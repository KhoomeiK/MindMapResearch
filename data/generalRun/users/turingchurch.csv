You can, of course, prove something to be inconsistent by showing 1=0, or any other false statement. By 'false' I mean that the converse statement is true.

A further example would be one of the implications of this. Gödel showed that it was possible to prove that within this system, if the system is consistent, then G cannot be proven. This then means the system cannot be proven to be consistent. If you could prove it to be consistent, then you could prove that G cannot be proven, which is equivalent to proving G."

math,ff3pcvw,t3_erh31s,1579545971.0,"I recommend reading [Gödel's Proof](http://calculemus.org/cafe-aleph/raclog-arch/nagel-newman.pdf) for a layman's guide to his theorem.

In short: Gödel's Theorem only relies on a very minimal set of axioms. Basically, all you need is natural numbers and the ability to perform addition and multiplication on them. E.g., the Peano axioms.

Using this, Gödel manages to create a correspondence between mathematical statements and the Peano nats. He manages to embed a statement of the Gödel sentence in his mathematical language: 'This statement cannot be proven.' If it can be proven, it results in a contradiction, whereas it is consistent if it can't be proven. So obviously the statement should be true, but it can't be proven.

Keep in mind that he proved this for a very simple set of axioms, using the natural numbers. But that doesn't mean that this only applies to the Peano axioms. Any set of axioms where it's possible to construct something resembling natural numbers with addition and multiplication will be subject to Gödel's Theorem. So e.g. ZF. Simpler systems are not subject to Gödel's Theorem. E.g., Presburger Arithmetic, which is natural numbers but only with addition, is not subject to Gödel's Theorem for this reason. 

In fact, there's some relation between Gödel's Theorem and computability, so the fact that Gödel's Theorem doesn't apply to Presburger Arithmetic also results in it being decidable, and therefore having an algorithm by which you can determine any statement in Presburger to be true or not (albeit if I recall correctly, such algorithms have abysmal time complexities and would end up taking quite a long time for complicated statements \- but still, a slow algorithm is better than no algorithm)."
JoeRogan,ff3mme6,t1_ff3kns8,1579544290.0,"> Specific to the BDS movement, these boycotts do not boycott based on race, or even a country.

I'm not sure why that particularly matters with respect to the law.

As for the listed court cases, note that those were all injunctions, so they will still have to be fully challenged in court. In [Arizona](https://reason.com/2020/01/07/arizona-first-amendment-challenge-to-anti-bds-law-dismissed-on-first-amendment-grounds/), at least, they amended the law to only apply to businesses over a certain size, which got the last case tossed out since the law no longer applied to the plaintiff. The law in Arkansas was upheld in federal court. 

Note that an injunction does not mean the case will be decided that way. Trump's immigration ban had an injunction placed on it, but was ultimately upheld by SCOTUS. imo, these laws, too, will likely be upheld by SCOTUS (and if they aren't, they open the door to constitutional challenges to public accommodation laws \- it will be interesting to see the outcome either way)."
samharris,ff3jvqm,t1_ff2vbga,1579542605.0,"No, I don't really have a dog in this fight, and I think the laws themselves are bad ideas. But imo they are as constitutional as public accommodation laws."
JoeRogan,ff3jqkv,t1_ff31h89,1579542520.0,"The amicus brief addresses the Claiborne case:

> Of course, boycotts usually involve speech—people urging others to join the boycott or organizing in groups that promote the boycott—as well as conduct. Like other advocacy, advocacy of boycotts is generally constitutionally protected: NAACP v. Claiborne Hardware Co.made that clear, in noting that ""peaceful picketing,"" ""marches,"" ""urg­[ing others] to join the common cause,"" ""support[ing the boycott] by speeches,"" ""threats of social ostracism,"" and gathering and publishing the names of those who refuse to join were all ""safeguarded by the First Amendment."" 458 U.S. 886, 907, 909, 910, 933 (1982).

> But Claiborne Hardware had no occasion to decide whether a person's not dealing with someone based on that someone's race was itself protected by the First Amendment, because it was clear that Mississippi law did not prohibit such private choices not to deal. Under Mississippi law, whites could generally refuse to deal with blacks, and blacks could refuse to deal with whites. Nor was the boycott banned by general prohibitions on ""concerted refusal to deal,"" ""secondary boycotts,"" or ""restraint[s] of trade."" Id. at 891 n.7, 894, 915.

> Indeed, Claiborne Hardware expressly reserved the question whether a boycott ""designed to secure aims that are themselves prohibited by a valid state law"" is constitutionally protected. Id. at 915 n.49. It follows that the question whether a boycott that involved refusals to deal that were themselves prohibited by a valid state law—a law that targeted conduct rather than speech—was also not resolved by Claiborne Hardware. And in Rumsfeld, the Court did resolve the issue: a boycott by universities of military recruiters could be outlawed outright, 547 U.S. at 60, and certainly could be penalized by withdrawal of government funds as well, id.

> The holding of Claiborne is thus consistent with the principle set forth just six years before in Runyon v. McCrary: Though people and institutions have a right to advocate for discrimination—to ""promote the belief that racial segregation is desirable""—""it does not follow that the practice of excluding racial minorities from such institutions is also protected by the same principle."" 427 U.S. 160, 176 (1976). Likewise, though people have a right to urge a boycott of white-owned stores, as in Claiborne, it does not follow that the practice of refusing to deal with an entity based on the owners' race (whether black or white) is also protected by the same principle. And though people have an indubitable right to urge a boycott of Israeli companies,[3] it does not follow that the practice of refusing to deal with such companies based on the owners' nationality is also protected by the same principle.

> We see the same in International Longshoremen's Ass'n v. Allied International, Inc., 456 U.S. 212 (1982), where union members engaged in a purely politically motivated boycott of cargoes shipped from the USSR (engaged in as a protest of the invasion of Afghanistan). The Court noted that even outright speech—secondary picketing—in support of refusals to deal might sometimes be properly restricted notwithstanding the First Amendment (a controversial position, but one the Court had settled on in earlier cases). Id. at 226. And, the Court noted, if even picketing supporting a boycott could be restricted, ""[i]t would seem even clearer that conduct designed not to communicate but to coerce"" (there, a refusal to unload ships) ""merits still less consideration under the First Amendment."" Id. Of course, the refusal to unload ships was obviously a part of a broader plan designed to communicate. But the refusal to deal was itself not treated as communication entitled to First Amendment protection.

In other words, you can advocate for a boycott, but boycotts themselves can be prohibited. Just as you can advocate discrimination against minorities, but discrimination against minorities may be prohibited. Laws against boycotts themselves have been upheld by SCOTUS in e.g. International Longshoremen's Ass'n v. Allied International, Inc. and Rumsfeld v. Forum for Academic & Institutional Rights, Inc."

Professors,ff2fmjc,t1_feo2phc,1579504093.0,"> I think the doctrinal question could fairly be said to be open, but I would not want the Court to say that boycotting--refusing to do business--is inherently expressive. If it is, then the baker in Masterpiece Cakeshop and indeed anyone who wants to boycott LGBT customers or customers protected by any other form of anti-discrimination law have prima facie speech protection. So would employers who want to ""boycott"" female, Muslim, or African American prospective employees. I don't want to say no distinctions could be drawn between consumer boycotts and other kinds of boycotts, but I think down that road lies trouble. If Shanor's point is that public accommodations laws and anti-BDS laws are categorically different, then saying boycotting is inherently expressive invites a heavier, not a lighter, justificatory burden.

math,fdxwhgb,t3_ena1ze,1578773616.0,"Gödel's incompleteness theorem proved that given a sufficiently complex set of axioms, it is possible to construct a proposition but not be able to prove it. I believe the axioms basically involved natural numbers, addition, and multiplication. So even seemingly simple systems like the Peano natural numbers have theses sorts of results.

Basically, the proof consisted of using the natural numbers to embed mathematical facts about the system. Gödel had devised some method of making a correspondence between statements like 'proposition P has a proof Q' and numbers. Using this, Gödel managed to construct a 'Gödel sentence' which essentially said something like 'This proposition cannot be proven.'

The Gödel sentence is still *true* in the sense that it can't be false - if it could be proven, then you would have demonstrated the Gödel sentence to be true, which would lead to a contradiction. But you still can't prove it to be true within the set of axioms that you have. If you adopt the Gödel sentence as a new axiom, then a new Gödel sentence can be constructed. So this problem cannot be fixed.

tumblr,fds2otz,t1_fdris48,1578693438.0,"Calling that censorship is laughable. Studios release endless streams of sequels and reboots not because they're enforcing their preferences on the masses, but because that's what people watch and they want to make money. If people stopped watching sequels and reboots, studios would stop making them. Big blockbuster hits are hits because the preferences came bottom up, not top down.

In the meantime, nothing is stopping an independent filmmaker from creating films, and nothing is stopping audiences from viewing those films other than their own preferences. Look at the Oscar nominees for Best Picture last year. Only one of them (*Black Panther*) was part of an existing franchise. One of them (*Vice*) was heavily critical of the US government. Is *Vice* the kind of film that could have been made and released in China?

This year, probably the only franchise film that's a contender for Best Picture is *Joker*, and it probably won't win. Look at [the other contenders](https://www.indiewire.com/2020/01/2020-oscars-final-nominations-predictions-1202201658/). Other than *Joker*, the only other film that made any decent chunk of change was *Once Upon a Time in Hollywood*, which still sits at a third of what superhero films (including *Joker*) make. Can you blame studios for not spending tons of cash on films that don't make them money? It's not like they don't market them, either - I certainly got quite a few ads for *Jojo Rabbit*, but that only made some $30m.

Personally, I also don't think the cinema is as much of a cultural fixture as it used to be anyway. The number of tickets sold has barely changed from 1995 to today, despite a quarter century of population growth. Divided by the population, and the average person goes to the movies maybe four times a year. The vast majority of American cultural output is probably in television, and perhaps streaming, which has opened the door to many new players in the field. Netflix has paid for a ton of independent content, some of it actually even good. Amazon, too, has several decent series right now. Focusing on the box office as the centrepiece of American cultural production is overly narrow.

Anyway, all that is pretty tangential to my overall point. American media consumption is dominated mainly by what Americans want to watch, but if you can get the money for a project, there's nothing stopping you from making it. And if you want to watch it, you'll have the freedom to do so. Whereas in China, even if you have the money to produce a piece of media, you may not be allowed to distribute it if the government doesn't like it. One of these is much more stifling towards creativity and free expression than the other."

In China, the mole's identity is revealed and he is arrested - a change that is utterly incoherent with the theme of the movie and the plot of the sequels.

> Isn't pricing inequitable towards low-income motorists?

> Results from surveys conducted for projects in operation show that drivers of all income levels use priced express lanes. Although many low-income users don't choose to use the tolled facility every day, they support having the option. For instance, a low-income parent racing to avoid the financial penalty associated with being late for pick-up at a day care facility, or for work, is often pleased to have the option of paying a fee to bypass gridlock in the regular lanes. In fact, a high level of support for San Diego's HOT lanes comes from the lowest income users (70 percent support). Moreover, low-income bus riders may benefit significantly from toll-financed transit improvements. Finally, a well-designed value pricing plan can be less burdensome to low-income citizens than current systems that are based on regressive taxes, such as car registration fees, sales taxes and the gas tax. For example, a proposal for pricing the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge included life-line discounts for low-income motorists. The Bridge also currently provides free service for carpool vehicles during rush hours.

> If road pricing enables reductions in current regressive fuel tax rates, low-income drivers will be better off, especially if the quality of public transport is improved and free alternative roads are available for those who do not choose public transport.
