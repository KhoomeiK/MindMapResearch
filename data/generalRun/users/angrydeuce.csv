He really just didn't give a shit and cut some of us some awesome breaks. Not everyone, but I busted my ass, and those of us that did got crazy good deals.  That was not extended to customers, just internal staff."
AskReddit,ffdbu8r,t1_ffbd7m6,1579817541.0,"IMHO, as a lowly peon in the organization, it was CompUSA trying to branch out from computers and move into the A/V space. They stopped stocking much of the PC components they used to carry in lieu of high end home theaters and tvs, markets that places like Best Buy and Circuit City already were well established in. Even outside of that, there were questionable products being brought in. For example, when we liquidated, we had two full pallets of cases of BAWLS energy drink. Retail on those was like 25 bucks and we sold like 1 a week until we liquidated and slashed prices.

We started really pushing phones in a big way, too, when Verizon and US Cellular already had that market cornered as well. We had a USC store in the same fuckin strip mall we were located in, 200 ft away from us. A Verizon store was right around the corner. And of course, Best Buy and CC were already players in that market, too.

I strongly believe that if Comp had just stayed the course and been a computer store, they'd still be around today, but margin on prebuilts was next to nothing. Plus, they *really* started pushing stupid shit like Sirius and XM, and they're extended warranties as well. I had managers straight up refuse a laptop sale if the customer didn't buy TAP.  It left a lot of customers very pissed off, and rightly so.

Plus the door busters were always understocked, we'd get like 4 of the laptop plastered across the entire front page of our weekly ad. Sell out of those in half an hour and spent the rest of the week dealing with super pissed off shoppers.

All in all, there's a lot of reasons they went under IMHO, but I really think the main thing was the lack of focus on the PC enthusiast space that made them what they were in the first place."
AskReddit,ffca9mj,t1_ffc14o9,1579795084.0,"Yeah I can't complain too much as I got a severance (a whopping two grand which was like a month's wages) but many of the people laid off didn't get dick, especially the entry level people. I read about that Sears shit when it was going down and that is supremely fucked up.

We kept on touch after the store closed and everyone was able to find another job relatively quickly so that was good, and it ain't like they were being paid very well as it is, so they just slid over to other big boxes for the most part.  I ended up going back to school and starting a career in IT so that worked out well for me."
AskReddit,ffc1l7i,t1_ffbzs5m,1579789224.0,"The brand was purchased by eMachines to be the front end to their online store. Not sure if eMachines ended up selling that off later or what but that was the rumor.

They also kept a few brick and mortar locations open in Florida for a time, but they were not at all related to the original CompUSA at all."
AskReddit,ffbzu27,t1_ffbygyy,1579787868.0,"Yeah I knew a few peeps that did the same, not 100 thousand worth by any stretch, but there was a whole lot of flipping going on that's for sure.  I was tempted but didn't want to deal with the headache of ebay and all that shit.

We had an entire 24 foot aisle of just CompUSA branded DVD-Rs, because they were shit 4x ones that nobody wanted when 16x was the norm. I bought about a thousand of them for less than a buck per 100 pack spindle. Still have a lot of them, though I haven't burned a DVD in a decade."
AskReddit,ffbuqn7,t1_ffbexyh,1579783425.0,"Basically the blueprint for a particular aisle or department.  What heights to set the shelves or peghooks, what backing paper to use, signage, where everything goes, etc."
AskReddit,ffaum6p,t1_ffai0sd,1579744860.0,"Also worked at Comp, Oct '05-April '08.  I worked through the bankruptcy, liquidation and was one of the only employees to actually be there on the day we locked the doors for the last time.  My first shift was the day the Xbox 360 launched.  The company itself was fucked up, but I really liked most of my coworkers so I stuck around.  Our store survived the first round of closings, although 1/3 of the staff was called into the GMs office and given their walking papers that day with no warning.  Our sales were shit long before that, and we all knew the place was going to fold eventually, but it was still a bit of a shock.

The biggest clue that shit was about to go down was about a month before they announced bankrupcty.  I was the warehouse supervisor at that time, supervising myself pretty much by that point lol.  Every morning I would check the printer for the transfer orders, corporate would constantly freight balance stores so a few a day was pretty typical, until the day I walked in and there was like 30 fuckin pages of transfers sitting there waiting for me, multiple page lists.  They pretty much wanted transfers of all of our worthwhile shit to a Distribution Center in Mexico.  I palletized tons and tons of Mac Pros, Plasma TVs, huge laser printers, laptops, desktops...anything that wasn't complete and utter garbage and sent along at least 8 pallets of shit out a few days later.  We sold off like 1/3 of our displays over the next couple weeks at a deep discount, shit looked half empty.  I was also in charge of managing the planograms being set, which was done by regular sales floor guys, and my GM was like, ""Uhhh, where are the new planograms??""  Kept emailing corporate, kept getting bullshit canned responses, and that's when I pretty much knew.  Bankruptcy was announced and a security guard showed up unannounced at my store to make sure employees didn't immediately start looting the place.

So yeah, moral of the story is Carlos Slim Helu likely consolidated a shitload of the merchandise in a foreign country just before declaring bankruptcy and likely bilked tons of creditors out of millions of dollars worth of stolen assets.  Hooray!!

Anyways, the liquidation was fuckin awesome.  I scored so much shit for pennies on the dollar because I was in good with our liquidation rep from Gordon Brothers.  $2000 iMac for $100.  50"" Plasma for $50.  $400 PDA for $25 bucks.  We bought Xbox Live points and time cards for literally pennies, ditto Nintendo Wii points.  I bought like the entire library on Virtual Console for less than $2 lol.  Every single DLC track for Guitar Hero and Rock Band.  I had *years* of Xbox Live time, and I never ended up paying for Live again, having stopped playing console games in lieu of PC.

And of course it was fun as shit moving racking that hadn't been moved in decades and finding 3.5"" floppies, PC magazines from the early 90s, coupons that expired when some of the youngest kids were being born.  And we fucked off...a *lot*.  I spent entire shifts playing games on the demo PS3 unit.  The last day, when the store was completely empty of everything, I brought my guitar and amp and played music for much of the day while some of the other guys played cards and a few others skateboarded around the floor.  Ordered pizza for lunch, knocked off about 2PM, locked her up and headed home.  Got a severance that wasn't shit, but got unemployment for a bit while I looked for something better, which though a pittance, was a luxury as I'd never been out of work for more than a week or so in like 10 years at that point.

CompUSA was a fuckin shit stain of an operation, but I really do miss those days sometimes.  The job sucked but the people you worked with were generally pretty awesome.

The feel of the burnt orange shag carpet rolling around in our living room watching Fraggle Rock and Inspector Gadget on our huge console TV that only got 4 channels because there was only 4 channels.  The pop-hiss sound of the needle dropping on one of my mom's 45s on the little portable record player I got for my birthday when I was 3 or 4.  Running through the damp, freshly washed sheets hanging from the clothesline in the back yard (we didn't have a dryer at first) in the springtime.  The musky smell of lightning bugs caught on warm summer nights, kept in a jar or coffee can with holes punched in the lid.  The night breeze coming in my open window, making the curtains dance as I lay curled up in my Star Wars sheets, the headlights of the occasional passing car tracing brilliant squares of light across the posters of Mickey Mouse and Winnie the Pooh on my wall.  Baseball cards in the spokes of my bicycle to make it sound like a motorcycle.  Flipping the rocks over that comprised our front walk to look at the bugs underneath, playing with the Rollie Pollies and watching them roll into a ball, marveling at the networks of tunnels the ants built below them while cicadas loudly sing in the background.  Hearing the ice cream man coming and immediately bolting for home to beg your mom for 50 cents so you can chase him down and buy a bomb-pop before he gets too far.

TheWayWeWere,fez6oon,t1_feyuzgt,1579454355.0,"Good on you for picking the right time for you.  A lot of people just have the kids then try to figure out how to make it work, which adds a lot of stress onto an already extremely stressful life-changing event.  It's one thing to be told about the financial impact, the lack of sleep, the seemingly constant illness as their immune system develops, but none of that means shit until you personally are up at 230 in the morning for the fifth time that night trying to comfort an inconsolable 4 month old whose poor little body feels like a hot loaf of bread pulled from the oven from the fever burning through them.  I'm a grown-ass man that has seen and been through some shit, and I'm not ashamed to admit that there were several nights that I just broke down and wept in frustration while the baby literally *screamed* in my arms for half the night.  It is rewarding as hell, and completes a person in a way few other things can, but it is absolutely the hardest thing I've ever dealt with, and I've only got two years under my belt.

But it's because of how incredibly hard it is that I really wish I would have done this like 15 years ago.  When I was in my 20s I could go for fucking *days* on like 3 hours of sleep a night.  I worked third shift for a good chunk of those years and I would stay up 40-50 hours straight when I came off my work week and started my ""weekend"", flip my schedule back around to a dayshift lifestyle so I could, you know, actually have a social life with non-vampires, then flip it right back to nights when I cam e back up in the rotation...did that shit weekly for *years* to little ill effect.  These days if I sit on the couch for more than 10 minutes without being actively engaged in something (and sometimes even if I am) I am nodding off.  A couple hours chasing the kid around my house and *I* need a freaking nap, not him.  I am definitely too old for this shit lol

Ran up tons and tons of credit card debt which had to be paid off or at least paid way the fuck down.  Then of course when they found out they had been cheated on the whole time, or came home to an empty trailer, the wife taking the kids to live with her parents and pretty much telling husband to fuck off.  The wife of a soldier in my step-father's unit in the Army went off the rails during their deployment and opened all the windows in their base housing in **Alaska in winter,** took off back to the lower 48 with no warning, to just let the pipes explode and freeze solid, causing tens of thousands of dollars worth of damage that her husband was on the hook for, both financially and the world of shit he had to deal with because of it.

So much incredibly fucked up shit some of these people do to their SOs while they're deployed, like you wonder how the can fucking sleep at night, how they can even look themselves in the eye after doing somebody that dirty. Not that I would ever condone it obviously, but it makes you somewhat understand why there is so much domestic violence and strife when soldiers come home.  The PTSD is enough to have to deal with, but add in all *that* fuckin stress on top of it?

I mean, my mom was still in her teens when I was born in '79, only 23 when my brother was born in '83.  She already had two kids and a house and a husband at an age where I was still living in a shitty 1 bedroom apartment spending all my extra money on weed and video games.

I'm 40 now, almost 41, and I've got a two year old.  My mom was already empty nesting before she was even as old as I am now.  My grandparents were as old as I am now when they welcomed us, their first grandchildren.  I see all those photographs from when we were young, and them when *they* were that young, and it's weird to me to think that my grandparents and I would be peers at the age I am now, and my mother and father would very much seem like kids to me.  I work with people older than my parents were when I was born and even *they* just seem so freaking young to me.  I don't feel old; when I look in the mirror I don't see someone my grandparent's age looking back at me, I just see *me*.

It's a strange thing, contemplating your parents being like any other 20 year old, partying it up just like we did when we were that age, going through the trials and tribulations of growing up as we all do.  Thinking of your parents as people in their own right, instead of just Mom or Dad."
ChoosingBeggars,few9bi7,t1_feu62xk,1579407077.0,"Given the price difference between Pull-Ups and regular diapers, my wife and I are definitely in the ""just buy diapers"" camp with our 2 year old.  We're working on potty training him but he's just not ready yet, he's started to ""tell us"" when he needs to be changed (maybe one time in ten, if that) but never *before* he needs to be changed.  The overall price per package is similar, but you get 2/3 or less of the amount of Pull-Ups as compared to diapers at that price so it's hard to justify the expense when we're still going through 6-10 diapers a day.

I guess the moral of the story is, as with all things child-related, it really depends on the kid.  If your daughter is signaling that she needs to go before she actually does, then I would jump on it...outside of accidents and the occasional bed-wetting, the transition from Pull-Ups to regular underwear during the day and Pull-Ups at night is much quicker than the transition from diapers to pull-ups (so I've been told, anyways).  But if she's still pretty much just going whenever she feels the need with little to no warning, like my son is, stick with the diapers to save your wallet a little bit.

Side Note, swim diapers are a wonderful thing, but there is no goddamn good reason *I* can see that would justify the **insane** cost of those shitting things.  If someone in the diaper industry reads this, please, enlighten me how a swim diaper is so fundamentally different and has such a much higher cost to produce that a dozen of *those* costs as much as 4 dozen regular diapers, because I just don't fuckin see it."

Though I luckily have an actual office and don't sit out in the pit, my employer very much wants us to keep our doors open whenever we're not actively on a call to avoid the mid- and upper-tier guys from becoming too ""detached"" from the noobs, want us to be approachable and all that, but all it does is fucking destroy all my momentum in whatever task I'm working on.  IT ain't like building a house, you can't just glance at it and have a decent idea of where you left off, there's often nothing *tangible* there at all, it's just data and organizing said data.  It takes me a good 10 minutes to really warm up and start chugging along, but as soon as I start hitting my stride, BAM, there's someone at my goddamn door.  If I could just be alone at home with some music blasting I could easily get my work done in half the time, but nope.  Gotta spend an hour a day in the parking lot we call a highway."

I worked for BBV from 98-01, couldn't agree more.  I worked my way up from entry-level CSR to Store Manager within a couple years, and the job was so fuckin easy, it pretty much did itself.  Pay wasn't great, but being 21 years old with no real responsibilities it was more than enough to support my lifestyle of hitting the bars every night after work with my coworkers and covered my rent and bills easy.

The store I managed had zero turnover for almost a year, which was unheard of in our district, we had some stores that literally turned over almost their entire staff every 6 months.  We were all friends outside of work, and those of us not on shift would often go to the store just to hangout because half our friends were working anyway.  We used to hook up the game rental units to the TV wall and play 4-player Goldeneye or that South Park shooter all the time.  Customers would even join in for a match or two, our security guard, who was supposed to be patrolling the entire strip mall we were located in, yep, he hung out in Blockbuster all night and played video games with us, too.  I remember when Final Fantasy IX dropped, I hooked up the rental Playstation and played that shit from beginning to end in the manager pit totally on the clock.  It was very much like the movie *Empire Records*, we were pretty much a family.

Alas, all things must pass, and we ended up getting a new District Manager in from outside the company that was a total douchebag and decided it was his mission in life to ""clean house"" and get the stores staffed with people of his choosing.  I ended up getting my walking papers about 6 months later due to poor sales of DirecTV packages at my store (because people *always* go to Blockbuster planning on dropping $400 for a satellite TV install, am I right?!?!) and 2/3 of my staff quit with me.  I heard through the grapevine that the asshole DM was pretty much working 7 days a week, 12 hour shifts just to cover not only my store, but all the other stores in our district, after the ""house cleaning"" went down.

My store was long gone before the company folded, but I do really miss the good days.  One of my best friends in the world came out of that job, and we still hang out on the regular to this day, 20 years later.  I lost touch with many of my coworkers over the years, but I still run into some of them from time to time around town, and it's always weird to see the 17 year old kid I hired that used to smoke weed out back by the dumpsters now in his late 30s in professional attire with a wife and multiple kids in tow.

I mean, it was $10 and they got a free rental for every 10 and shitload of coupons in the mail, which were also a lot of free rentals.  We had customers that would rent like 10+ movies every single week.  At $3.50 a pop for a new release it paid for itself very quickly.

The nurse, who wasn't a day under 157, was actually angry with me and threw a change of loaner clothes at me and told me to go to the bathroom and clean myself up and put my shit clothes in a plastic bag.  I did the best I could with the pink powder soap and useless brown paper towels but still smelled like poop. She sent me back to class with my bag of shit clothes so the rest of the kids could make fun of me. They complained to the teacher of the smell so she made me scoot my desk over to the far corner of the room for the rest of the day where I fought back tears and nobody, to include my teacher, gave a single fuck as to how I felt.

This was the early 80s so things are a lot different now, and something like that would be handled a lot better. For the rest of the year I had zero friends, as I was known as the kid that shit his pants throughout the school. ""Hey (Deuce), shit your pants today?!"" became the standard greeting I received.

Luckily I moved the following summer and started a new school the next year.

AskReddit,ffdbu8r,t1_ffbd7m6,1579817541.0,"IMHO, as a lowly peon in the organization, it was CompUSA trying to branch out from computers and move into the A/V space. They stopped stocking much of the PC components they used to carry in lieu of high end home theaters and tvs, markets that places like Best Buy and Circuit City already were well established in. Even outside of that, there were questionable products being brought in. For example, when we liquidated, we had two full pallets of cases of BAWLS energy drink. Retail on those was like 25 bucks and we sold like 1 a week until we liquidated and slashed prices.

We started really pushing phones in a big way, too, when Verizon and US Cellular already had that market cornered as well. We had a USC store in the same fuckin strip mall we were located in, 200 ft away from us. A Verizon store was right around the corner. And of course, Best Buy and CC were already players in that market, too.

I strongly believe that if Comp had just stayed the course and been a computer store, they'd still be around today, but margin on prebuilts was next to nothing. Plus, they *really* started pushing stupid shit like Sirius and XM, and they're extended warranties as well. I had managers straight up refuse a laptop sale if the customer didn't buy TAP.  It left a lot of customers very pissed off, and rightly so.

Plus the door busters were always understocked, we'd get like 4 of the laptop plastered across the entire front page of our weekly ad. Sell out of those in half an hour and spent the rest of the week dealing with super pissed off shoppers.

All in all, there's a lot of reasons they went under IMHO, but I really think the main thing was the lack of focus on the PC enthusiast space that made them what they were in the first place."

We kept on touch after the store closed and everyone was able to find another job relatively quickly so that was good, and it ain't like they were being paid very well as it is, so they just slid over to other big boxes for the most part.

AskReddit,ffaum6p,t1_ffai0sd,1579744860.0,"Also worked at Comp, Oct '05-April '08.  I worked through the bankruptcy, liquidation and was one of the only employees to actually be there on the day we locked the doors for the last time.  My first shift was the day the Xbox 360 launched.  The company itself was fucked up, but I really liked most of my coworkers so I stuck around.  Our store survived the first round of closings, although 1/3 of the staff was called into the GMs office and given their walking papers that day with no warning.  Our sales were shit long before that, and we all knew the place was going to fold eventually, but it was still a bit of a shock.

The biggest clue that shit was about to go down was about a month before they announced bankrupcty.  I was the warehouse supervisor at that time, supervising myself pretty much by that point lol.  Every morning I would check the printer for the transfer orders, corporate would constantly freight balance stores so a few a day was pretty typical, until the day I walked in and there was like 30 fuckin pages of transfers sitting there waiting for me, multiple page lists.  They pretty much wanted transfers of all of our worthwhile shit to a Distribution Center in Mexico.  I palletized tons and tons of Mac Pros, Plasma TVs, huge laser printers, laptops, desktops...anything that wasn't complete and utter garbage and sent along at least 8 pallets of shit out a few days later.  We sold off like 1/3 of our displays over the next couple weeks at a deep discount, shit looked half empty.  I was also in charge of managing the planograms being set, which was done by regular sales floor guys, and my GM was like, ""Uhhh, where are the new planograms??""  Kept emailing corporate, kept getting bullshit canned responses, and that's when I pretty much knew.  Bankruptcy was announced and a security guard showed up unannounced at my store to make sure employees didn't immediately start looting the place.

So yeah, moral of the story is Carlos Slim Helu likely consolidated a shitload of the merchandise in a foreign country just before declaring bankruptcy and likely bilked tons of creditors out of millions of dollars worth of stolen assets.  Hooray!!

Anyways, the liquidation was fuckin awesome.  I scored so much shit for pennies on the dollar because I was in good with our liquidation rep from Gordon Brothers.  $2000 iMac for $100.  50"" Plasma for $50.  $400 PDA for $25 bucks.  We bought Xbox Live points and time cards for literally pennies, ditto Nintendo Wii points.  I bought like the entire library on Virtual Console for less than $2 lol.  Every single DLC track for Guitar Hero and Rock Band.  I had *years* of Xbox Live time, and I never ended up paying for Live again, having stopped playing console games in lieu of PC.

And of course it was fun as shit moving racking that hadn't been moved in decades and finding 3.5"" floppies, PC magazines from the early 90s, coupons that expired when some of the youngest kids were being born.  And we fucked off...a *lot*.  I spent entire shifts playing games on the demo PS3 unit.  The last day, when the store was completely empty of everything, I brought my guitar and amp and played music for much of the day while some of the other guys played cards and a few others skateboarded around the floor.  Ordered pizza for lunch, knocked off about 2PM, locked her up and headed home.  Got a severance that wasn't shit, but got unemployment for a bit while I looked for something better, which though a pittance, was a luxury as I'd never been out of work for more than a week or so in like 10 years at that point.

CompUSA was a fuckin shit stain of an operation, but I really do miss those days sometimes.  The job sucked but the people you worked with were generally pretty awesome.

The feel of the burnt orange shag carpet rolling around in our living room watching Fraggle Rock and Inspector Gadget on our huge console TV that only got 4 channels because there was only 4 channels.  The pop-hiss sound of the needle dropping on one of my mom's 45s on the little portable record player I got for my birthday when I was 3 or 4.  Running through the damp, freshly washed sheets hanging from the clothesline in the back yard (we didn't have a dryer at first) in the springtime.  The musky smell of lightning bugs caught on warm summer nights, kept in a jar or coffee can with holes punched in the lid.  The night breeze coming in my open window, making the curtains dance as I lay curled up in my Star Wars sheets, the headlights of the occasional passing car tracing brilliant squares of light across the posters of Mickey Mouse and Winnie the Pooh on my wall.  Baseball cards in the spokes of my bicycle to make it sound like a motorcycle.  Flipping the rocks over that comprised our front walk to look at the bugs underneath, playing with the Rollie Pollies and watching them roll into a ball, marveling at the networks of tunnels the ants built below them while cicadas loudly sing in the background.  Hearing the ice cream man coming and immediately bolting for home to beg your mom for 50 cents so you can chase him down and buy a bomb-pop before he gets too far.

I worked third shift for a good chunk of those years and I would stay up 40-50 hours straight when I came off my work week and started my ""weekend"", flip my schedule back around to a dayshift lifestyle so I could, you know, actually have a social life with non-vampires, then flip it right back to nights when I cam e back up in the rotation...did that shit weekly for *years* to little ill effect.

Ran up tons and tons of credit card debt which had to be paid off or at least paid way the fuck down.  Then of course when they found out they had been cheated on the whole time, or came home to an empty trailer, the wife taking the kids to live with her parents and pretty much telling husband to fuck off.  The wife of a soldier in my step-father's unit in the Army went off the rails during their deployment and opened all the windows in their base housing in **Alaska in winter,** took off back to the lower 48 with no warning, to just let the pipes explode and freeze solid, causing tens of thousands of dollars worth of damage that her husband was on the hook for, both financially and the world of shit he had to deal with because of it.

So much incredibly fucked up shit some of these people do to their SOs while they're deployed, like you wonder how the can fucking sleep at night, how they can even look themselves in the eye after doing somebody that dirty.

I'm 40 now, almost 41, and I've got a two year old.  My mom was already empty nesting before she was even as old as I am now.  My grandparents were as old as I am now when they welcomed us, their first grandchildren.

I don't feel old; when I look in the mirror I don't see someone my grandparent's age looking back at me, I just see *me*.

It's a strange thing, contemplating your parents being like any other 20 year old, partying it up just like we did when we were that age, going through the trials and tribulations of growing up as we all do.  Thinking of your parents as people in their own right, instead of just Mom or Dad."
ChoosingBeggars,few9bi7,t1_feu62xk,1579407077.0,"Given the price difference between Pull-Ups and regular diapers, my wife and I are definitely in the ""just buy diapers"" camp with our 2 year old.  We're working on potty training him but he's just not ready yet, he's started to ""tell us"" when he needs to be changed (maybe one time in ten, if that) but never *before* he needs to be changed.  The overall price per package is similar, but you get 2/3 or less of the amount of Pull-Ups as compared to diapers at that price so it's hard to justify the expense when we're still going through 6-10 diapers a day.

I guess the moral of the story is, as with all things child-related, it really depends on the kid.  If your daughter is signaling that she needs to go before she actually does, then I would jump on it...outside of accidents and the occasional bed-wetting, the transition from Pull-Ups to regular underwear during the day and Pull-Ups at night is much quicker than the transition from diapers to pull-ups (so I've been told, anyways).  But if she's still pretty much just going whenever she feels the need with little to no warning, like my son is, stick with the diapers to save your wallet a little bit.

Side Note, swim diapers are a wonderful thing, but there is no goddamn good reason *I* can see that would justify the **insane** cost of those shitting things.

I work in IT about 50/50 office/onsite, and there is constantly just a bunch of gossip and farting around going on whenever I'm out there.  At any given time at least 30% of the staff is just walking around, hanging out in each other's cubes talking about whatever the fuck, be it the ludicrous display in the sportsball game last night, Game of fucking Thrones (though thats dried up at least), whose kid got the fuckin plague this week, whose kid mouthed off to mom this week, yadda yadda yaddddddaaaaaa

I mean, even my office isn't immune; I will be in my own office balls deep in a mail migration and I get interrupted 16 fucking times an hour by interns and other low-level techs.  Though I luckily have an actual office and don't sit out in the pit, my employer very much wants us to keep our doors open whenever we're not actively on a call to avoid the mid- and upper-tier guys from becoming too ""detached"" from the noobs, want us to be approachable and all that, but all it does is fucking destroy all my momentum in whatever task I'm working on.  IT ain't like building a house, you can't just glance at it and have a decent idea of where you left off, there's often nothing *tangible* there at all, it's just data and organizing said data.  It takes me a good 10 minutes to really warm up and start chugging along, but as soon as I start hitting my stride, BAM, there's someone at my goddamn door.

Our regular trash is the same large-size can, but it only ends up getting 2 or three kitchen-sized bags in it a week as compared to two or three times that number in recycling, and that's ignoring all the stuff that goes in there that's not bagged, like cardboard...tons of broken down boxes as we do a lot of online shopping, no time to go to more than a grocery store and maybe walmart to do a quick pick up.

blockbustervideo,fdm01yl,t1_fdj73yr,1578536595.0,"> There were some great times working in that district back then. So many stories and funny memories 

I worked for BBV from 98-01, couldn't agree more.  I worked my way up from entry-level CSR to Store Manager within a couple years, and the job was so fuckin easy, it pretty much did itself.  Pay wasn't great, but being 21 years old with no real responsibilities it was more than enough to support my lifestyle of hitting the bars every night after work with my coworkers and covered my rent and bills easy.

The store I managed had zero turnover for almost a year, which was unheard of in our district, we had some stores that literally turned over almost their entire staff every 6 months.  We were all friends outside of work, and those of us not on shift would often go to the store just to hangout because half our friends were working anyway.  We used to hook up the game rental units to the TV wall and play 4-player Goldeneye or that South Park shooter all the time.  Customers would even join in for a match or two, our security guard, who was supposed to be patrolling the entire strip mall we were located in, yep, he hung out in Blockbuster all night and played video games with us, too.  I remember when Final Fantasy IX dropped, I hooked up the rental Playstation and played that shit from beginning to end in the manager pit totally on the clock.  It was very much like the movie *Empire Records*, we were pretty much a family.

Alas, all things must pass, and we ended up getting a new District Manager in from outside the company that was a total douchebag and decided it was his mission in life to ""clean house"" and get the stores staffed with people of his choosing.  I ended up getting my walking papers about 6 months later due to poor sales of DirecTV packages at my store (because people *always* go to Blockbuster planning on dropping $400 for a satellite TV install, am I right?!?!) and 2/3 of my staff quit with me.  I heard through the grapevine that the asshole DM was pretty much working 7 days a week, 12 hour shifts just to cover not only my store, but all the other stores in our district, after the ""house cleaning"" went down.

My store was long gone before the company folded, but I do really miss the good days.  One of my best friends in the world came out of that job, and we still hang out on the regular to this day, 20 years later.  I lost touch with many of my coworkers over the years, but I still run into some of them from time to time around town, and it's always weird to see the 17 year old kid I hired that used to smoke weed out back by the dumpsters now in his late 30s in professional attire with a wife and multiple kids in tow.

We would get $5 worth of 'biz bucks' (pretty much a BBV gift certificate for employees) for every three we sold in a shift and some weekends I would rack up $25 or $30 worth of biz bucks in a night.

I mean, it was $10 and they got a free rental for every 10 and shitload of coupons in the mail, which were also a lot of free rentals.  We had customers that would rent like 10+ movies every single week.  At $3.50 a pop for a new release it paid for itself very quickly.

Course that gravy train slowed way down after about 6 months.  BBV ended up canceling the incentive, and the entire Biz Bucks program, within a year or so of launch."

AskReddit,fdlvytz,t1_fdl85ti,1578533812.0,">It's illegal for the parents to supply alcohol to anyone underage, even their own child

Not everywhere. Here in Wisconsin it is totally legal to allow your kids alcohol, and in many parts of the state you can legally be served alcohol if your parent or guardian is with you and allows it.

Given what an insane fetish this state has with drinking to the point of blacking out, and how getting a DUI up here is like no big deal (people swap stories of their ""first DUI"" to raucous laughter), I have a strong suspicion a lot of it has to do with kids not only growing up seeing their parents get completely shitfaced their whole lives, but being allowed to get shitfaced themselves in their teens at family bbqs."
AskReddit,fdlvhiz,t3_em1ujs,1578533460.0,"When I literally filled my pants with diarrhea during our reading circle in 2nd grade. My stomach had been upset all day but right after recess we were all taking turns reading and without any warning hot liquid feces exploded out of my body down my pants to the knees and up my back to the shoulder blades.

The two girls sitting closest to me crabwalked away in pure terror. The entire class stared at me, mouth open, to include my teacher, who sent me to the nurse. The nurse, who wasn't a day under 157, was actually angry with me and threw a change of loaner clothes at me and told me to go to the bathroom and clean myself up and put my shit clothes in a plastic bag.  I did the best I could with the pink powder soap and useless brown paper towels but still smelled like poop. She sent me back to class with my bag of shit clothes so the rest of the kids could make fun of me. They complained to the teacher of the smell so she made me scoot my desk over to the far corner of the room for the rest of the day where I fought back tears and nobody, to include my teacher, gave a single fuck as to how I felt.

This was the early 80s so things are a lot different now, and something like that would be handled a lot better. For the rest of the year I had zero friends, as I was known as the kid that shit his pants throughout the school. ""Hey (Deuce), shit your pants today?!"" became the standard greeting I received.

Luckily I moved the following summer and started a new school the next year.

And no, username actually has nothing to do with that story, ironically enough."

I downloaded it and burned it to disc to listen to in my car forever ago, and still have the mp3s on my flash drive in my car today.

I could listen to that shit all day and not get tired. Whoever the composer was is a fuckin genius."

This is after a trip to Urgent Care and them sending us to the ER. Course they can't waive the UC fee that is utterly a useless waste of time.

Fuck Healthcare in the US. So incredibly broken."
