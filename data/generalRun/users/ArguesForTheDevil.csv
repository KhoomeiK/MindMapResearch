Under which property system? There are quite a few.

Because they had these assets in the financial system that the US controls, which you have said Venezuela had no right to participate in.

Sure, but they almost certainly persuaded them by threatening to make it harder to participate in the US financial system which (threatening them with fines or cutting them off like Venezuela was), once again, you've said foreign entities have no right to do, so this shouldn't be a problem. Presumably Venezuela doesn't have a right to participate in their financial systems either.

Do you have any examples that don't boil down to the US stopping Venezuela or people who deal with Venezuela from dealing with the US controlled financial systems/markets?

Do you see why I'm having trouble here? That's what economic sanctions boil down to. Cutting off an entity from your financial systems, or fining them if they want to continue using them.

Sanctions don't really work if just the US does it. [The EU, Canada, Mexico, Switzerland, and Panama are also sanctioning Venezuela](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_sanctions#By_targeted_country).

This isn't a ""we're going to kill you"" situation, this is a ""you can't participate in our system"" thing.
