Without playing them it’s really hard to know honestly if it’s the right one for you. I found out I didn’t like a 7.25 radius only by experience. I prefer a 9.5-10. So it’s hard to answer this question because there are great jazz basses in every price bracket. I can honestly recommend the MIM players I think for the price they are hard to beat except for the tuners.

The TI rounds are the only rounds I’ve loved right out of the package. Everything else took time to settle even my Galli nickel rounds which I left on my jazz bass for a year and they still sounded great btw. I only took them off to try out the TI rounds while moving the Gallis over to my p bass. But after realizing how much I loved the TI rounds I bought an extra set and put them on my MIM p bass. I’m in the middle of another p build right now that is meant to be somewhat of a copy of the 62 P custom shop and that one will have TI flats.

You do your own research if you care to. If you really don’t think sexism comes from thinking women  are less than men which is part and parcel of misogynistic beliefs- the more patriarchal the society the more sexist it is and the more homophobic. Also the less sexist the country the more quickly they adopted same sex marriage. Treatment of gays and women in societies are completely tied together.

MensLib,ff5dnrr,t1_ff4y9jw,1579588513.0,"Misogyny includes a hatred of anyone perceived to be ‘like a woman’, explaining much of the homophobic aggression towards non-straight men. Homosexual men have long suffered homophobic abuse because they do not conform to heterosexual male norms, including pursuing women. Homophobia is entirely underpinned and propped up by patriarchy, and a patriarchal society encourages the policing of the boundaries of what it means to be a ‘real man’ and behave in a truly ‘male’ way.

There are massive prohibitions around anal sex with men that haven't existed psychologically and socially in the same way when done to a woman. She is a penetrated body, he is not.

MensLib,ff2c7ls,t1_ff23q77,1579500389.0,"I heard a talk about this a long while back and I was looking for the link and couldn't find it. However I think this article does a decent job of breaking it down.

""The underlying principle of patriarchy, as I understand it, is separation and control. The separation is from self, other, life, and nature. The fundamental structures we have created over these millennia are based on dominance and submission, and the worldview we have inherited justifies them as necessary to overcome both our basic nature and “Nature,” seen as separate from us. We pride self-control and frown on “emotionality”; we operate, organizationally, in command and control forms; we have been treating nature as a thing to exploit, use, subdue, and, most recently, convert to commodities for sale.

Why patriarchy and not some other word? Because, at least in the European historical lineage, which later affected many other cultures through colonial contact, the shift to separation and control coincided with making paternity central. How paternity came to be central after it wasn’t for 97% of the existence of Homo Sapiens is way beyond what a blog post can address. What is important to note, though, is that once paternity becomes important, controlling women is inevitable, because only by controlling women can it be reliably known who the father is. There is an irreducible distance between the biological father and the offspring that can only be eliminated fully by imprisoning a woman and preventing any other man from having access to her. This is why patriarchal societies by necessity become societies of control and separation.""

It does a decent job of unpacking it as a system and not as men. What I recall from the original talk I was looking for was that patriarchal systems have ways that they benefit men and ways that they benefit women, but by far they benefit men, however they are quite simply bad for most everyone (except the few who sit at the very top and one still might ask but at what expense to the totality of their humanity?)

There are petty hefty numbers to support that death rate due  to DV disproportionately effecting women. A slap and choking are both physical violence one is much more likely to leave you dead and one is employed by men in far greater numbers. These are not symmetrical outcomes or experiences. I’m looking at Ncbi reports on it as current as 2017.  Now I’m seriously not going to respond again.

In fact most of the deaths of men from domestic violence is because of the third party, another man. No one is saying men aren’t abused or can’t fight back without repercussions or being blamed as being the attacker when it’s self defense. The unseen consequences of domestic violence, emotional and mental side effects leave people in terrible shape and that is the same for both sexes. Women are just killed more often and physical violence is employed more frequently against them. I have no idea what point you are arguing for. It sounds like you at saying it’s exactly the same the level of fear and impact of physical damage by violence men experience at the hands of women. Which is absurd on its face."
PublicFreakout,feleqc9,t1_feldnx0,1579220438.0,I said rarely not never. It’s a guideline and a general truth but not a hard and fast rule. However the fact men use physical violence more often than women by a sizable amount as a form of control over their partner speaks for itself. Women tended to use other methods of control because physically intimidating their partner wasn’t nearly as useful. I think the death rate difference probably speaks to that too.
PublicFreakout,feldhv5,t1_fel6pnf,1579219616.0,No they aren’t but the weight difference alone means someone’s arm or grabbing you and physically for in your way means she’ll be moved aside in a way that is hard to enforce as a woman. My sister’s hand needs surgery just from her ex grabbing her hand to prevent her from leaving and breaking it. Forget about tackling her choking her out or flat out sitting on her.

Every synth needs power, audio and likely midi, meaning you have at least 3 cables per synth. Not including effects to and from and wiring up the computer and adapters. I have about 100 cables in my studio, it’s as good as it’s gonna get."
JUSTNOMIL,fds7biy,t3_emt4c9,1578695983.0,It’s probably not the end of the story but it’s the beginning of the end for you which is a huge relief. This was the hardest part just extricating yourself. Congrats to you for doing a very hard thing.
aww,fds68xt,t3_emuca9,1578695291.0,Kisses thirsty fren.
synthesizers,fdrvqsk,t1_fdrhzxp,1578690444.0,"I’m one of those people and it wasn’t due to being obstinate. My thinking was the odyssey is pretty crammed as it is and I didn’t want small keys with less throw on the sliders. It’s a fairly versatile synth and moving the slider even a tad can move you into a totally different sound.

With the Arp 2600 at 3/4 size that isn’t an issue. At the time they made it making it more compact and moveable wasn’t an option, now it is. They have fairly different form factors which was why I did want a smaller Arp 2600 but not a smaller Odyssey. 

Anyway here is to hoping the GC picture wasn’t a glitch but shows a smaller version. I simply would have to put the original size on my studio floor to make it fit in my already crowded studio."

synthesizers,fdrd7z1,t1_fdrd55x,1578682854.0,That makes sense it’s inexpensive enough you won’t be taking a major hit.
synthesizers,fdrcw4p,t1_fdrcsuk,1578682661.0,Well still that is a great deal.
relationships,fdr98nj,t1_fdr9606,1578681194.0,Sigh. It’s not insecurity it’s frustration.
synthesizers,fdr93ua,t1_fdr7eq5,1578681142.0,That makes sense. I want the black one. I’m hoping Sweetwater will carry it.
relationships,fdr5rgi,t1_fdr4tru,1578679815.0,I’m really not kidding 2-5 years is fairly average. Not every marriage or level of infidelity is the same nor is every cheater’s response to pulling their head out of the fog or cutting off contact with the affair partner.  At 2-3 years your marriage can look fairly close to what it was like before and be in a good pace. But triggers and other issues are usually lurking depending on the person and the way they talk and relate. That’s why it’s a general ball park. 2-3 yrs is pretty optimistic. Most found it was more like 4-5 to not recall discovery day again or feel a slump around the anniversary of the event. Most people who stayed said their marriage had recovered but was never the same while many of the cheaters felt their marriages were better than before the affair. Almost no person who’d been cheated on shared the same sentiment.
