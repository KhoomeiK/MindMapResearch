stopdrinking,fdw72o9,t3_emvngd,1578755757.0,"Aye, congrats!  2 beers is a big step.  Having gone through this twice now (i know, shouldve learned the first time) ill tell you this.  It isnt the first night you dont drink any its usually a day after or the week of but sleeping gets hard, the anxiety will suck.  You'll feel all kimds of crazy but it will subside.  The cravings are real and you'll start feeling better in a couple of months, thats when it gets testy.  You forget your issues, feel conplacent and safe and fall back in to ""i can have one with the boys"" which turns in to 3 then youre back at 6 a night.

Be strong.  Surround yourself with support and reach out for help when youre at your weakest.  

Good luck and i hope your liver recovers quickly."
