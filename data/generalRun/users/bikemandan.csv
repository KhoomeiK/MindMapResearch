Now can the average person afford these new units, I'd bet not. But that is not the point; not every unit built should be affordable for every person. Each new unit of housing on the market, regardless of cost, means that is one less unit of housing pressure elsewhere in the market. In other words, we need high end units in the market so that low end units can exist"
