dysautonomia,fdooo4w,t3_eka5hq,1578609466.0,"I have a service dog in training. I have other disabilities that also affect my balance. Just touching her, or having her lean gently on my leg, helps to ground me when I am feeling lightheaded. I feel like I am going to fall much more often than I fall so having something solid is a help.. Like the other person said, it’s a LOT of work to have her. She’s helped me get out of the house more, though. 

If you want something to alert someone if you fall, I would buy an Apple Watch or some other device."
