AskReddit,ffqdnaf,t3_euijje,1580131406.0,"My son is FtM. He's 20 years old now, started to live as a male at age 16, started testosterone therapy at 18. One thing that I did not expect as his mother was the emotional change - for the better. He had a very difficult time from ages 12-18, for reasons that are obvious now. But back then, I just thought he was mentally ill and would struggle forever. Nope. Once he started testosterone and started passing as a male, his entire outlook on life changed. There are no more outbursts, threats of suicide, cutting, or emotional breakdowns. He's quiet and anxious and maybe a little lonely, and there is definitely still a struggle going on, but he's much healthier than he was."

Also, whatever you are attempting to do is not do-or-die. When I was first starting with pottery, I would get frustrated that everything I made came out of the kiln completely fucked up. But I would tell myself ""This is literally just mud' and I began to forgive myself. Now that I'm getting some nice pieces out of the kiln, I can say ""Look what I made from a lump of literal mud"" and it makes it even sweeter. That goes for everything - paint is just paint, music is just sound that floats into the either, writing is just ink on paper. Just try and see what happens."

All my life, I told myself that I cannot do things, and I spent 15 years with a husband who also told me I could not do things. I was not smart enough, creative enough, or talented enough to even try.  In my mid 30's I left that husband and that mindset, and now I do everything. I started my own business and I am successful. In my spare time, I am a ceramics artist, a watercolor artist, and a writer. Im learning piano, and I'm getting ready for a journey into metalsmithing. I do hard exercise that I never thought I could do. At 41, I'm finally all the things I always wanted to be. I just had to go and do it."

I think you're wrong about what women want and what you're supposed to ""show"" them. And I think that's the problem. You're enabling your own loneliness by making excuses. So, I ask you what redeeming qualities you actually have and what you actually have to offer someone in a relationship. If the answer is nothing, the onus is on you to change that. Stop blaming others for your lot in life, and stop making assumptions about what women want because they're wrong."

AskReddit,ff1yok7,t3_eqy42h,1579489231.0,"My first year teaching, 2001. 4th grade, very rural school. I had a student, a girl who was extremely obese, like over 200 lbs at 9 years old. She also smelled bad and had dirty  clothing full of holes. She once came to school with the entire ass ripped out of her pants and no underwear on. My heart bled for her. She was very smart (great, imaginative writer!) and she wanted to do well, but she had so much to deal with.

Anyway - she got lice. So we kept sending her home to get the lice treated, but she always came back with lice still in her hair. Eventually, we took her to the cafeteria, got one of those industrial sized jars of peanut butter, slathered her head in it and wrapped it in plastic wrap, hoping it would smother the lice. She sat in the office with peanut butter in her hair the entire school day. Then we had her shower it off in the gym shower and the nurse combed it through.

The lice returned in short order. A few other wtf things happened in quick succession, so we decided we were going to do a home visit. We show up to her trailer, and her gigantic mom answers the door wearing only a bed sheet that had a hole cut out for her head to go through. Also, the trailer had no floor. It was all rotted out and the trailer was just sitting on the ground. There was running water, but no functional toilet. I don't know where the fuck they were shitting. 

So then the dad comes home from work. He's clean, well-dressed (polo shirt, khakis, nicely trimmed hair. He's also quite well-spoken. But, he seems entirely oblivious to the state of his home and family. It was the strangest thing. 

We got them some assitance, I can't remember what exactly it all was (this was 20 years ago). The child went on to 5th grade and then middle school, and I didn't see her again. I think of her often, and I have looked her up on Facebook. It looks like she had a child very young, but otherwise she seems ok. She is overweight, but looks much, much healthier, and she appears to at least be wearing decent clothing. I truly hope she is having a happy life."
