peloton,fen10lb,t1_fem0luv,1579274560.0,"It's sensationalist because why is any of this even necessary. I'm so tired of billing being messed up. I've had 2 insurances majority of my life until recently and hospitals still sent me to collections on a regular basis despite my being clear to them regarding billing up front. They'd rather not communicate and push their mess off on me to figure out because they couldn't care enough to do their job correctly in the first place or give me a courtesy call. It's outrageous and I'm so utterly sick of it.

And that's aside from the different plans that limit your options, deductibles (why do I pay a monthly premium?),  copays, (false) out of pocket maxes, etc, all assuming you have insurance of course.

So your digging into network out of network is, to me, frustrating because why do we have to dig into these weeds, worry about a contracted ambulance being in network, is the doctor in network at this hospital, what if you're moved hospitals, did you give consent if in an altered state of mind leading to put of network?

The 40 hour work week is outdated because workers can complete in an hour what may have taken a team days or weeks before. 

And many hourly workers are underemployed so as to avoid the company paying full time benefits requiring then to have more than one job.
