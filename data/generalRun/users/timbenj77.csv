So even though there was clearly a fumble, it has to be clear that one team or the other (even if it was the Seahawks) recovered the ball in order to overturn the ruling on the field that the runner was down by contact. So for all intents and purposes, *the ruling on the field stands* and that is why the Packers were charged with a time-out.

The Last Jedi demonstrated this perfectly: On one hand, you have Poe. He knows the First Order is bad, bent on galactic conquest for the sake of wielding power. He knows it through first-hand information. When he finds himself in a situation where obliteration of the rebellion - the only good people he knows - seems imminent, and he is in a position to prevent it - he doesn't hesitate. This is where good information, good intentions, and good decisions come together: Poe realizes that he must sacrifice himself to save the rebellion - and points his ship right at the heart of the devil. And then **BAM** Rose. Sweet, stupid, naive little Rose slams her ship into Poe's, knocking him off course **and almost killing both of them in the process**. Not because of some First Order propaganda about ""both sides"" or *the violent left* or *they hate America* or *libtard* nonsense. Because she was so mentally disabled, that she honestly believed that *possibly* saving Poe was the most likely path to saving the rebellion. Even though he was about to stop the giant laser cannon that was already starting to burn a giant effing hole in the fortress that the entire rebel force was holed-up in. *Useful idiot* is too kind of a term for Rose (not to be confused with the actress playing her, because, you know...Rose is a fictional character)."

We can accept that they should have probably lost to DET in their first matchup over the second hands-to-the-face penalty, but they also got screwed by a game-deciding uncalled DPI at the end of the loss to Philly. So how good are they? 13-3.

>Does Aaron Rodgers still look the same as he did a few years ago? Statistically, this year seems different...

He's definitely not been nearly as consistent as he has been in the past. He still has some impressive games (see @Chiefs) and tends to close games out in vintage Rodgers fashion, but he's definitely had bad games. Many throws have been way off - more than I'm comfortable with, for sure. At least for a guy we're used to seeing put the ball on a string exactly where it needs to go.

> The defense played well in the first half. They were OK in the second. What are the best at? Worst at?

I think it's been a lack of consistency in the middle of the season more than anything. Containment could be better and a few key mistakes were made, but overall I feel like they've tightened up - shored up the mistakes - and make the opposing offense earn every yard - and more importantly, make critical stops. The Smiths, especially Z, on the edge have been phenomenal lately. Best 3-man defensive line in the NFL.

>How do you guys feel about Lafleur? His relationship with Rodgers? His game management decisions? And that he'll be coaching in a playoff game for the first time?

I guess the proof is in the pudding. How do you argue with 13-3 from a rookie head coach that inherited a 6-9-1 team? One of the biggest indicators has been team injuries. They couldn't stay healthy for the past 10 years and I had often wondered what the S&C staff was doing wrong. This season, injuries have barely registered. Sounds like the players are happier and having fun. I feel some of his game management decisions are *too* aggressive (I can think of a couple 4th downs in the first half where we went for it instead of taking a field goal), but that's a welcome change from McCarthy's ultra-conservative play-calling.

> Dying from pneumonia is also natural, should we just let people who get it to die.

Know what else is natural? Survival instinct. I mean...bleeding to death is completely natural, too, but I prefer to bandage up my wounds and not die just because it's the natural thing to do. I'm not denying that I have selfish motivations.

I'm sorry, what are you advocating that I eat instead of the livestock?

Nah, NYers don't taste as good as NY strip.

But seriously, I'm not really a ""salad is what the food eats"" kind of guy, and I eat plenty of fruits and veggies, and I'm happy to tip my dietary scales towards *less* meat and *more* plants in the interests of less environmental impact, but as long as meat is an affordable option, you're not going to convince me to give it up entirely - or that I'm some kind of monster for being part of the natural circle of life."
worldpolitics,fdhpyqd,t1_fdhbwb5,1578427856.0,"OP is a liar, but more lies aren't helping. $150B is a gross exaggeration and the money was frozen assets that were subsequently unfrozen for complying with a nuclear treaty. And money we already owed them for an arms deal decades ago where they paid us and we never made good on the sale. Translation: it was their own goddamn money. And we were letting them have it for upholding their end of the nuclear treaty. Because...you know...we want them to continue doing that. Or do you *want* to stab them in the back again and give them more reason to hate us than ousting their democratically elected president in 1953? https://www.npr.org/2019/01/31/690363402/how-the-cia-overthrew-irans-democracy-in-four-days"

facepalm,fdhk9az,t1_fdhavbr,1578424426.0,"I could survive without eating meat, but not without eating some source of protein and we are omnivores - my point is simply that killing animals for meat is completely natural. Sure, you could say agricultural killing of animals isn't natural (vs hunting), but no less than leveling miles and miles of land and diverting waterways to irrigate fields to grow crops. I'm not criticizing either, its evolution and using the tools we have to advance. Clearly you have a moral objection to eating meat and I respect that, but I don't have any moral hangups about it. Animals live, animals die - whether we kill them for meat or not. *Something* is going to eat that meat - I just prefer it be me rather than worms.

But in all seriousness, I love them enough to let them go when the time comes, as I hope my kids will do for me. If I can't *enjoy* life anymore and I'm just aching and tired or suffering, and spending my day sorting out what pills I need to take...it's time to go.
