geography,fgeu2a9,t3_ey1i44,1580710015.0,"I love my degree. My university allowed me to take pretty much anything ranging from biology courses to geology, and wrapped it up nicely with applications of using GIS and remote sensing.  I recommend knocking out the core intro classes as soon as possible so you find the things that really interest you. I would recommend spending extra time when taking GIS. It will become a very useful tool for projects and your own research. 


It really depends on what’s offered to you for example, soils was only offered once during my time at college, and it was a class I found invaluable to my career in plant pathology. In terms of careers and jobs following graduation, soil science and geology are very valuable. Archaeology is a tough field to make a career out of, but it’s doable. Forestry is a rather large field across the US, and actually the field I received my first internship and job in. I believe it’s best to take a little bit of everything, that way you are well rounded."

The first time I tried to approach her to see if she was okay mentally, she snapped on me. I backed off. Eventually she broke up with me because I wasn’t giving her attention or making dinner like I was before."
dating_advice,fg73f3e,t1_fg5syw7,1580583076.0,Yeah I always try to wear a tiny grin. It takes more effort for your face muscles to frown than to smile. And I’ve found that something has simply forcing myself to smile can change my mood.
dating_advice,fg72sm0,t3_ex9sic,1580582655.0,Are you saying you want to do things he hasn’t done? You sound selfish as fuck and woman like you are the problem that continuously gets away without any repercussions.

I’d say do the things you enjoy doing. Find something you are comfortable going out and doing in your own.

For example, I’ve been through a similar situation . I’ve had friends call me ugly and this and that for a while. One day my closer friend asked me why I never approach any of the girls that smile and look at me in certain way. I never notice this because I was always counting myself out. Try to smile and just be happy and thankful for the opportunity to live another day."
