I’ll speak up and say I enjoyed watching ROS, but I hate its existence, lol. It’s a decent blockbuster movie, but so much of it is spent pandering to Star Wars fans who hated TLJ that the trilogy really doesn’t make sense on both a literal and metaphorical level.

Star Wars fans don’t like that Rey’s not connected by blood to someone powerful? Ok, make her related to Palpatine. Oh, they don’t like Rose? Let’s cut all of her scenes and give random pilots and crew members around the base more lines. They hated that Snokes died (despite not even truly being the main antagonist)? Let’s bring back Palpatine *off-screen.*

On a metaphorical level, TLJ was all about teaching us not to take legends and myths too seriously and to forge our own path forward. Rey wasn’t powerful by blood, she was a product of the force trying to balance itself (the way we’re constantly told that it does). Luke wasn’t some infallible badass - he was a powerful warrior who made some terrible mistakes and couldn’t face the consequences. There were a lot of interesting things there, but the way that ROS works is basically the opposite. It goes back to worshipping legends and myths like Palpatine, and Vader, and the previous Jedi order.

It introduces an antagonist and conflict that there is no hint of existing in the other two movies (Palpatine and his dreadnaught fleet). It’s very messy with at least FOUR fake-out deaths that I can remember, none of which lasted very long. They do this weird thing by hinting that Finn loves Rey all movie (and all trilogy really), but force a Kylo/Rey kiss at the end because of...death tension!?! It’s all incredibly awkward from a storytelling perspective. 

What I did like is Kylo’s storyline and how they handled the characters. I felt like the main trio of Rey, Poe, and Finn were written decently with good banter, and Adam Driver’s performance all trilogy is fantastic."

Parenting is one of the hardest jobs in the world because it's 24 hours a day that you're charged with the care, protection, and *growth* of someone. Sure, sometimes you go to work and aren't there, but if your kid gets sick, or has an injury, or needs you...you have to be there. To be a good parent, anyway (which isn't even a requirement).

AND you have to be financially responsible for this person. Most people aren't even financially responsible when dealing with themselves, let alone a tiny person who can't afford their own living cost.

Not to mention that if you mess up parenting, you have let loose a potentially poorly-adjusted individual on the world, and that has consequences in and of itself. Or another potential consequence of messing up (not taking care of the child, negligence - whether accidental or not - that leads to injury, trusting the wrong person/activity, etc.) is getting *jailtime* for being a bad parent.

Yes, maybe it's not the hardest job in the world for everyone, but it absolutely is one of the hardest jobs in the world.
