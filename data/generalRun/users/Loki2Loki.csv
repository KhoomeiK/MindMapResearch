What I’ve been doing lately is going along the sides first, then in intervals so that I can push the most snow but not need my efforts to be tidy.

This recipe has worked well for me.  There are a thousand variations possible once you have the proportions.  I use thawed frozen spinach so that I can squeeze the water out first.  I also dice red bell peppers and sauté them with onion—this helps reduce the water content.  If I’m using mushrooms, I sauté them, as well.   Everyone has their preferences—I prefer my quiche a little less wet.  

I crack my eggs in the blender and then add the cream.  I also add a little bit of Valentina (or mild hot sauce) to add a little more depth of flavor.  

Bon appetite!"

God is our refuge and strength, an ever-present help in trouble.  

Therefore we will not fear, though the earth give way and the mountains fall into the heart of the sea, 
though its waters roar and foam and the mountains quake with their surging. 

There is a river whose streams make glad the city of God, the holy place where the Most High dwells. 

God is within her, she will not fall; God will help her at break of day. 

Nations are in uproar, kingdoms fall; he lifts his voice, the earth melts. 

The LORD Almighty is with us; the God of Jacob is our fortress. 

Come and see what the LORD has done, the desolations he has brought on the earth. 

He makes wars cease to the ends of the earth. He breaks the bow and shatters the spear; he burns the shields with fire. 

He says, “Be still, and know that I am God; I will be exalted among the nations, I will be exalted in the earth.” 

The LORD Almighty is with us; the God of Jacob is our fortress."

The issue for me isn’t whether premarital sex is sinful, it’s whether or not people are treating each other with the utmost of love and respect when they engage sexually.  Married couples sin against each other and God all the time when they treat sex as a bargaining chip or a right.  And couples who are not married are perfectly able to enter into sexual encounters that reflect the sacred nature of the act."
