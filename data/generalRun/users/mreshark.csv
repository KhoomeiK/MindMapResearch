todayilearned,ffech0b,t1_ffe02hf,1579843052.0,That’s the Australian company by the same name. Not the same company they are talking about here. Woolworths failed to register their name outside the USA and other companies took the name.

I’m just saying they lined it up with the stairs incorrectly in relation to the floor. I assume you thought I was making a negative comment about the person. I’m no meanie."

I think it would be funnier if we zoomed out and he was actually eating while getting his hair cut. More readily identifiable and a harder punchline."

blackmagicfuckery,fd9k0wk,t1_fd8jc7h,1578234464.0,"If you threw water on an electrical fire it wouldn’t explode. Instead, the current would travel through the water, potentially electrocute you, or even spread via the electrified water. In the case of pure water thrown on a burning tv, the water would immediately contain impurities since it has now touched the dirty tv and the floor. 
As to where pure water would make a practical difference, this experiment with water flowing between two glasses would be one example. Pure water would not conduct electricity and would not behave the same way. It doesn’t take much to make pure water impure though."
blackmagicfuckery,fd6qkla,t1_fd521wx,1578194509.0,"Technically this is correct. Electricity will not conduct in pure water. Trace minerals or impurities such as salt enable electricity to flow through water. So in other words, tapwater would conduct electricity because it is not “pure” water. Truly pure water would not conduct electricity."

explainlikeimfive,f9m1r6d,t1_f9lj9gn,1575438447.0,Surface tension happens across the entire surface of the tea bag even if the bag itself is submerged. Less energy in the cooler liquid makes it a bit slower for it to seep into the bag and invade all the nooks.
