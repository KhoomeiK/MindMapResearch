Like backstory stuff or something relevant to future challenges to give them a taste without giving to much. Plus it's a chance to add allies for the players for the future.

No idea why you wouldn't be able to drag a ship with the force, obviously it should difficult, but that is why she ended up using the darkside to do it. I think interacting with the world as a force ghost is supposed to be highly difficult which is why we only see Yoda do it in ep 8. I agree about the death star and shield stuff. In my head Canon the Holdo manuver only worked because the shields were down."
