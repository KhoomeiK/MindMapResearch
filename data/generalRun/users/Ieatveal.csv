## ""Can Ozone be Used in Unoccupied Spaces?

Ozone has been extensively used for water purification, but ozone chemistry in water is not the same as ozone chemistry in air. High concentrations of ozone in air, **when people are not present**, are sometimes used to help decontaminate an unoccupied space from certain chemical or biological contaminants or odors (e.g., fire restoration). However, little is known about the chemical by-products left behind by these processes (Dunston and Spivak, 1997). While high concentrations of ozone in air may sometimes be appropriate in these circumstances, ***conditions should be sufficiently controlled to insure that no person or pet becomes exposed***. Ozone can adversely affect indoor plants, and damage materials such as rubber, electrical wire coatings and fabrics and art work containing susceptible dyes and pigments (U.S. EPA, 1996a).""

Laserengraving,ffi03tu,t3_etqnpi,1579960943.0,"You're not going to like my answer. 

You need a $5000 fiber laser to do any decent metal work.  You can't do metal with a diode laser(the usual starter models) or with CO2(The $400 level).    Now there is a caveat.  You can put cermark spray(black ink like stuff) on very clean, very very clean metals and use a CO2 laser to bake it in, but its not what you are looking for.

To do any kind of metal engraving or marking, you need a Fiber laser and they start around $4200 and end up around $5000 once you have the rotary stage (which you want) and shipping etc.

There isn't any inexpensive options for metal. I started with a CO2 and did the Cermark route and its not a quick and easy process until you get good at it.  I find the fiber laser has a much better looking result anyway.

Fiber lasers come in all shapes and power levels.  I went with a 30W.  The price diff between a 20W and 30W is minimal and you can do a lot more with a 30W.  Then there are deskop models, models built into a cart and whatnot.  Lots of options.  eBay is where I bought mine.  Laserfactory2016 was the seller I used and they had great after sales support. They also dont pull any funny business with import duty like many sellers.  You will see identical lasers for $2000 but no import duty or shipping.  After running the numbers, those came out around $5500...so..

"" We heard you. We did not get this right from the start. My apologies for that and I wanted to personally assure you of the path forward:  


First, rest assured that come May, when we end new software updates for our legacy products, **they will continue to work just as they do today.** We are not bricking them, we are not forcing them into obsolescence, and we are not taking anything away. Many of you have invested heavily in your Sonos systems, and we intend to honor that investment for as long as possible. While legacy Sonos products won’t get new software features, we pledge to keep them updated with bug fixes and security patches for as long as possible. If we run into something core to the experience that can’t be addressed, we’ll work to offer an alternative solution and let you know about any changes you’ll see in your experience.  


Secondly, we heard you on the issue of legacy products and modern products not being able to coexist in your home. We are working on a way to **split your system** so that modern products work together and get the latest features, while legacy products work together and remain in their current state. We’re finalizing details on this plan and will share more in the coming weeks.  


While we have a lot of great products and features in the pipeline, we want our customers to upgrade to our latest and greatest products when they’re excited by what the new products offer, not because they feel forced to do so. That’s the intent of the trade up program we launched for our loyal customers. ""

amazonecho,ffg7jii,t1_ffg5xc1,1579900150.0,"I don't know  for sure, but I cant see why it wouldn't. As long as the TV is paired with one and the other is paired with the first echo, then it should be fine. 

Id think the first echo you pair to will be the 'main' echo, then the second is paired to the main echo(If I read the manual right).  The sub is just part of the echo so it shouldn't be an issue.

I haven't tried it myself, but after reading over how they work in that mode, I'd think you are fine to go that route.

There are alexa enabled sound bars(non amazon) as well, but I suspect you know that since you seem to know what you're doing."
Scams,ffg5ofv,t3_etf5jh,1579898997.0,The website itself does not need to be secure. Only the checkout page.  However its stupid to not be updated to HTTPS these days.

Without site info or more info, there is nothing to go on.  Not sure what you are asking really without any info, no one can really answer."

Laserengraving,ffg4y1m,t1_fffwegh,1579898551.0,"He's half right but I dont think that is what happened at all. 
The fact that its cleanly changed is not the plastic in my opinion.  I engrave a lot of acrylic and even crappy lowes acrylic marks fine if I don't run it too fast. He could have run it again and evened it out.
My guess without seeing the setup(machine type) is that they ran it too fast.  The area above has a lot of on and off so it keeps the laser cooler.  Then when it gets to the solid area, the laser is on longer and when they get warm the power output drops.  

This is all speculation of course but the recycled versus virgin sounds like horseshit to me. I've only been engraving almost a year now and I have never had something partly engrave like that unless I did something wrong.

Any idea if he used a CO2 or  diode laser?"
Scams,fffwibj,t3_etbsm8,1579893335.0,Oddly its been around since 2016 though.  Weird.  I wouldnt but that is just me.
Scams,fffwe33,t1_ffffeht,1579893261.0,they will have all your details and sell them to other scammers. I suspect the scam is identity theft as well as money theft.
