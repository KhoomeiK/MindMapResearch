Games,ff7ltav,t1_ff7hjay,1579652615.0,"First, I totally agree with you that DTG is a pretty salty place, even in the best of times.

However, I think the spike in saltiness on DTG was caused by two big issues with D2 now (as one of those people who's stuck around since D1's launch): 1) the way Bungie's content model is contradictory to the way players have played the game so far and 2) Bungie's support model doesn't match their new content model.

Destiny has very much been an all or nothing game for me, in the sense that I'm either playing it religiously or I'm not even touching it. About once a year I take a break from the game when I get burnt out, and up until the launch of the latest expansion (Shadowkeep), it's worked out fine because when I come back to the game all of the content I missed is still waiting for me. With the new Seasonal system Shadowkeep introduced, content is introduced at the beginning of a season and removed at the end of it. If I don't want to play for every single season or show up for every single event, then I no longer have the option to do it later down the line as it will be gone from the game.

So the end result is you have a bunch of players who log in once a week because of FOMO, not because of a natural desire to actually participate in the game.

And for Bungie's support and improvements, they are still following the update model of ""big fixes at the beginning of each season with rapid support only for game breaking issues"". But when your new content model is focused around things that are only relevant for a few months, that strategy doesn't quite work.

Additionally, a lot of players feel like they are shouting into the void, and all the void says in return is ""we're listening"". The cycle of feedback usually is 1) Players make posts about an issue, 2) Bungie says ""we're listening/we'll pass the feedback along"", 3) Usually nothing happens. At first it felt like they really were listening, but that feedback they ""listened"" to never went anywhere and now it doesn't feel genuine anymore, like a parent agreeing with their child just to get them to be quiet.

TL;DR: A combination of FOMO tactics and a feeling of disconnection between Bungie and the playerbase has made a lot of people salty."

Stellaris,fel9lu8,t3_epkns8,1579217065.0,"I remember this more for the RP value than gameplay, but I had a game where I encountered refugees within the first 30 years of the game.

As it turns out, this empire had found a shielded planet during their first exploration phase and cracked it open to find the Prikkiki-Ti inside, who promptly destroyed their early-game fleet and purged their few planets. Since my empire was apparently the only one who had the ""Refugees Welcome"" policy, the few survivors ended up at my door.

But here's the thing, I hadn't even met this empire yet. They were on the complete other side of the galactic core from me, so these guys either traversed their way through the core of the galaxy to get to us, or went hopping from empire to empire, being turned away at the door and vaguely pointed in my empire's direction until they finally made it to my territory. Imagine being the radar technician on duty when they arrived in my territory, seeing a bunch of battered, dying ships no one recognizes piloted by desperate aliens we can't communicate with yet. Or being those desperate aliens hopping across the galaxy chasing a vague rumor of a place where they can seek asylum.

It made for a really cool game because I basically had two starting species (3 if you include the robots my Mechanist empire started with), and gave me a driving motivation to reclaim these guys' homeland and avenge their fallen from the Prikkiki-Ti."

Case and point being machine uprisings. I usually play a machine empire, so I rarely have any true allies until uprisings happen. But because the war system doesn't allow for me to say ""hey, organics, I'm going to use my military to support these rogue AIs"" the only real alternative I have is to build a colossus for the Total War CB and destroy all of their forces until the rebelling machines can win.

The solutions to this I see could be:

1. Let empires join a war in progress, with the benefit to that side being that it removes some of the already existing exhaustion (maybe based on the new empire's economy, military strength, or some other factor).

2. Add a new CB where the win condition is that an empire ends another war it is currently a part of (with maybe options to either surrender if they are the aggressors or seek a status quo if they are defending). For balance reasons I assume this wouldn't be an option for wars like Purges (idk what the CB is for a machine uprising)."
