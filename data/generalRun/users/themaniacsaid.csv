Catswhoyell,ffga6v8,t1_ffg7l4m,1579901786.0,Oh for sure. I had little bits of ham (read online there were stray cats around the island) and he snagged the whole bag when I stopped feeding him to enjoy the views! Still love him.

travel,ffg4u9f,t3_etdd76,1579898487.0,"Spend the full two weeks in Portugal. Obviously do the big cities, Lisboa, Porto, ect.. you can easily take trains to the smaller cities nearby while staying centrally located. Do NOT miss this opportunity to see the Azores or Madeira.. short flight from the mainland, they are Portugese islands in the Atlantic. You can get there super cheap from Porto.  Portugal is easily one of the most beautiful places on earth, you will have so much fun! I'm on Sao Miguel island in the Azores right now and the scenery is blowing my mind."

Shoestring,ff07c71,t3_eqs47n,1579465959.0,Rome is super overrated. Venice is crazy touristy as well. Try flying into venice's treviso airport as well.  Use flixbus  or another chartered bus to travel. Sermione is a small town near venice I would 100% recommend to everyone. Have fun!

Awwducational,fecw92r,t1_fecw6vy,1578987115.0,I don't think storm drain is the word I was looking for.. like a gutter? Thing that collects rainwater from the roof and it flows down the square tube thing.

Maybe someone will know an optometrist or have old glasses to borrow for the moment. Maybe they will have small tasks you could do to pay for the phone bill.
