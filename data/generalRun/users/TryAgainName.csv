AdviceAnimals,ff9oxnb,t1_ff8vxq9,1579717616.0,"Can confirm I am European. Most of us think it is similar to our car insurance, you pay something like $500.00 (for serious issues)and insurance covers the rest. That is the way I used to think and I had been assuming people complaining about the cost were talking about insurance cost, uninsured price or were getting some fancy new treatment.

I probably still have major misconceptions about how it works tbh.

You should check out how cheap travel insurance to the US for Europeans. I think it cost me something like $700 for 6 months which covered me up to $5million."
