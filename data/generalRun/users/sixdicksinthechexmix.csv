I’ll be honest with you, if China took this route I’d be publicly outraged and privately relieved. People in western countries are so removed from the idea of death and disease outbreak that they refuse to get vaccines to prevent them. I have 80 year old patients who want every vaccine I can find for them because they had 12 siblings and 4 died in childhood. People are not ready for mass quarantines to limit the death toll to a couple million instead of a billion. No industrial country can handle a mass outbreak without being ruthless. 

I think it’s likely that the world shaking outbreak will begin in a densely populated country with poor medical care for the general population. I would guess China, or India maybe. Hopefully that country/region has the authority and ruthlessness to isolate the sick and prevent a world altering pandemic for the survival of the species. Is that worse than us all going down together? I have no idea."

I’m in no way trying to legitimize poor behavior, and I’d be lying if I said you wouldn’t have run ins with poor behavior through your career, but don’t base the quality of your future adult interactions on 19 year old boys. 

If you choose to go back and teach college age boys then yes, short of wearing a burlap sack (and maybe even then) you’ll be sexualized. There’s a reason women tend to date older guys, it’s because men under 26 or so are idiots.  

Again, I’m not suggesting you’ll never have problems, and I’m not legitimizing poor behavior, but I no longer care that the woman a few cubes down is cute, I only care that she’s the only person who actually understands how to fix a specific issue I keep running in to.

So even if your blood pressure is low and you’re getting close to passing, I’ll still push morphine if you are/seem uncomfortable or are gasping for breath, because it’s what works best, even though it might hasten death.
