AskReddit,fft3y2p,t3_esy81b,1580205807.0,"Well, my one in a milliom event is my birth and that only happens once so i guess my odds are technically 1/current population size (7 billion?)

I was born on the 9th of April 1989 at 4:09am. So if you're american it's 4/9 at 4:09. 

On my exact due date.

Around 5% of births are their due date so those odds are pretty amazing to start with.

To top all this off, parents were on birth control at the time of my conception.

I wasn't  aware of the uniqueness of my birth until i was in my early 20's, and it made it even more weird because throughout my life, the number 49 has shown up in so many unexpected places. 

Brief example;

Just 2 weeks ago i was on a quick break at work and i rang my mum to have a quick chat about something (can't remember what) and when she answered the conversation went like this

Mum: ""oh hey (my name), i was gonna call you, i was just waiting for my phone to charge""
Me: ""want me to call you later? What % is your phone on?""
Mum: "".... oh ffs...  it's 49% hahahaha""
Me: ""ofcourse it is... (so when 49 shows up i always check the time)... mum, it's 4:09pm right now hahahaha""
Mum: ""not even surprised""

So yeah pretty cool. I'd like to talk to a numerologist if this might mean anything cause i think its pretty unique."

I was just minding my business listening to music when my own voice in my head said ""there's going to be a cat that runs out"" and i was like... ummmokay so i just backed off on the accelerator a slowed to 70kmph. Not even 30 seconds later as i drive over the top of a crest, a cat runs out, and because i slowed down i had time to brake and not end this furr babies life, if i had not slowed down i definitely would have hit that cat.

Just throwing this weird old game at you guys, its not it what we are looking for by any means, but how this game works is what i wonder about the relation to op.

So to perfom any action besides walking, you must type what to do. If you want to pick something up you would have to first inspect it by saying 'look' and then once you know what it is you would say ""pick up 'item' ""

Dont know what type of game play this is, but i used to play the shit out of this game, it was sooo hard trying to figure everything out just by typing, you cant jump or run, everything is pretty strategic and there isn't really any clues on how to play it, you figure it out as you go.

Although this game might not even exist, i really hope it does cause it sounds pretty cool. I saw a suggestion in the op comments for someone to make the game and hope someone does a copyright claim on it so we can find out that way haha"

Could this game possibly have been a mini game or a demo game that came with a full game? 

Like a game inside a game? I cant even find a decent example but i just have these vague memories of games that came with other games when i was younger.

If anyone here is familiar with PC Powerplay magazine's, you'll remember the cd that came with every edition had demo games. Was it a demo game?? 

I'm just trying to think outside the box a bit. Due the fact that all the people that seem to remember it only remember roughly the same parts of the game i think we may not be trying to find a full game.

My dad was subscribed to pc powerplay and i played almost every game on them but dont remember this one. I was also 11-13 years if the game release time is correct info, and demo games were pretty big back then.

Ichi-go ichi-e  - ""one time, one meeting""
Is a Japanese idiom that describes a cultural concept of treasuring the unrepeatable nature of a moment. The term has been translated as ""for this time only,"" and ""once in a lifetime."" The term reminds people to cherish any gathering that they may take part in, citing the fact that any moment in life cannot be repeated; even when the same group of people get together in the same place again, a particular gathering will never be replicated, and thus each moment is always a once-in-a-lifetime experience.

When wearing t shirts. There are certain shirt neck styles that accentuate the body image as well. Most womens shirts are V-neck style, these show collar bones and shoulder structure. 

Pants, you can pretty much wear anything you like, but high waisted pants are a good style for a feminine look.

I have always dressed comfortably and since i was old enough  to think for myself i pretty much haven't changed my style. I have never ever,  EVER worn clothes to impress anyone but myself. The only time i change is if i haven't dressed appropriately (like dressing nicely to an event where i could happily wear loose track pants)

ARG,fdjcu87,t3_eaauk2,1578465616.0,"If we go back to the first uploads, I get the impression that this is an arg. I always keeping mind that people that upload videos must have access to the Internet. It's always first person perspective so the person videoing is also uploading. 
The noises he makes are weird though, why is he always making these noises, even when around other people? In one video I get the impression the camera/phone is taken from The person recording, but the person  filming has obviously had the footage or phone returned to them so they can still upload it to YouTube. 

Still, not enough connecting dots to make a clearer theory"

I think it's harder for me to accept that I didn't know my own mate who I've known for so many years could go under my radar like that and not vent to me more. I guess I feel like a shit friend for not knowing sooner and actually actively helping him more."
