Okay, sorry,  When I was 2 years old, this is how the story I was told to me, apparently someone noticed I had artistic ability ( at 2) My Uncle Paul ( Who was also my Godfather) bought me Spirograph at the age of 3 and he taught me how to use it. By the age of 4, I understood it and mastered the skills of Spirograph. My parents bought me an Etch A Sketch at the age of 4. I enjoyed it as well, but I had two older brothers that would not keep their hands off the  Etch A Sketch, so it wasn't as much fun.

As I grew, I started free hand drawing.  I enjoyed drawing people. I daydreamed...A LOT!! TOO MUCH!! I would get in trouble in school for daydreaming.  I would do my work and then let my mind wander off...somewhere far away.  Then, I would turn my classroom paper over and start drawing on it.  So the Teacher had enough of me and sent me to the Principal's office.  I remember sitting in his office not having any clue that I was being admonished for my deeds. I just sat there clueless.  I think the Principal knew as well because he didn't punish me. What he did was assign me to draw for the school newspaper.  Which I did.  It goes on from here, I went on bigger things and when I was in the working world, I became a Computer Programmer. I am now retired.

Keep on drawing, my friend."

It wasn't easy to suppress the feelings, but in our society if we actually acted the way we truly felt, we may all get arrested for a variety of crimes. So, I had to hide it. I had to teach myself how to cope with strangers, but as time went on it became easier for me to live with it."

I was a single Mom with two children and the older one had moved out. So,at that time, it was just my daughter and I and some Men made weird advances to me ( sexual in nature.) I felt compelled to report them, except that I found most men were doing this.

Anyway, on the day of Dec.21st,2010 ( I was my Dad's caregiver.) I made breakfast for him, then took all his vitals. ( blood pressure, oxygen levels, weight, etc..) Then...there is a side note for the patient to make their remarks:( My Dad wrote: I feel like Tony the Tiger!!!!!!!)

So, my Dad was a tough cookie. I promised him I would NEVER send him to a home. My home would be his home forever.  I didn't have a husband anymore. ( Even if I did, the one I had before wouldn't mind at all being with my Dad.)  My Dad had told me that only ""Family would take care of him"" , I had limited resources, but came up with an idea.

I asked my daughter's boyfriend if he thought he could care for my Dad. I told him he was pretty cranky.  He would have to do ""A lot for Dad"" . My daughter's boyfriend was out of work at the time and only taking online classes in college, so this seemed like it could work. Now, I just needed to run this by my Dad...( I needed to know myself because I have taken so much time from work for Dad. This would be a blessing. )

Wow!!  Dad agreed to it!!!  He had said my daughter's boyfriend was like family.  Anyway, her boyfriend did an excellent job!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  But after 7 months the morning of Dec.22nd 2010 his heart stopped in the bathroom of my home.

Dad passed on my watch. I had a ""meltdown"","" breakdown, ""   I don't care what you call it. I didn't want to be here anymore. However I knew that I was so sick that I needed help. I got help and was diagnosed with PTSD.

Dad has been gone 10 years now, yes I still cry now and then. I am so much better now. I think Dad would be very happy with me."

OMG!!!! DAD!!!!!  I did not have the heart to tell him.  You see Dad was from the depression era, they hung on to their money.  When he gambled, 25 cents was big money.  So, he was thrilled with his winnings!!!

I used to talk to my Dad every day. He called me a ""pest"",  the reason why, I checked on him every night before he came to live with me and I would call him. As soon as I called he would answer "" Is this the PEST?""  I would reply:"" Pap-Pap, did you take your meds tonight?""  Sometimes he would tell me, I forgot. Othr times, Yes I did.

venting,fcknfeu,t3_ehnk7r,1577729109.0,"I get it.  However I am 60 years old and retired. I have a younger sister who is 5 years younger. Early on as young children we got along, I played with her, she was cute as a button, tiny and I protected her. But, as teenagers she developed an attitude "" I am better than you"", you could see it in her photos. She did well in school, better than myself and my two older brothers.  She was the ""baby"" and got away with a lot!!!  

As we aged, married, children, jobs, she became more of a negative, talk-down-to-me kind of person.  I was educated, Had a degree.  She would say, ""That's a useless degree"".

No it wasn't, I got a job in IT. She would say, ""Oh so your going to be a computer operator? Anyone can do that.""  I ignored her, but she hurt me. These comments were unnecessary when she was just a clerk for the county of Orange.

Anyway, if I ever offered advice she would poo-poo it or find some negative reason why she can't accept it.  

So we came to the point in our lives where our Dad passes away. There are 4 siblings and 3 are pissed off because Dad had a Living Trust and made me the Executor of the Trust.  I am called the "" Successor Trustee"" , so according to the trust I must divide his estate. Dad gave me the greater share and explain why in the trust.

"" She was the only daughter who cared for me in my final days, she was the only child of mine that never borrowed money from your Mother and I, and she was the only child that never drop off their Grandchildren as babysitters to your Mother and I. That meant a lot in my decision"" He wrote. 

They all got a lot of money, I no longer speak to any of them. The oldest died I hear. 

My younger sister tried to have my Dad change his trust just a week before he died, she couldn't accept that she was the executor because she is the smarter one.  

She did this while I was at work, she went to my house with documents for my Dad to sign, I had a caregiver ( a trusted caregiver) with my Dad this caregiver went into the next bedroom and called me at work and told me what was happening. I stopped her, my Dad was sick. How dare you come in my home and do this to Dad for your own selfish gain. Please leave. 

When Dad passed, I decided to let my sister help me with the living trust. Just so she would feel like no one was cheated. I asked her at every step if she was good with every decision and she said she was. ( she wasn't) We finalized the trust and then she tells me weeks later that I made poor decisions. ( wait a minute...she was making these poor decisions with me) What is YOUR PROBLEM???? 

She goes off on me, how I am a shitty sister and I didn't deserve the monies I got and so on. I never amounted to anything and I had married a Jap. Had a crappy job.
So, I blew up at her and said ""Look, I am tired of YOU and your B.S. my Ex-is Japanese, you are Racist! My children would be offended by you. I am offended by you, I have a GREAT JOB, I am a Manager of IT, how about you? Are you still a clerk? Is your daughter still hooking for a living?
