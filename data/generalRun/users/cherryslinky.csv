dogs,ffh7rbu,t1_ffgi28u,1579925512.0,"Rolando, College Area, Del Cerro and San Carlos are rampant with off leash, escaped and outright roaming aggressors. They come for me and not my dogs. I must smell great. 

Until last Fall, I had a neighbor who threw open his front door, at what became known as the ""dogshit house,"" for his 3 large aggressive dogs to shit in the unfenced front yard. He'd have a smoke and laugh while his dogs shat and chased neighbors. 

I have another neighbor who lets 3 Yorkies roam. And, plenty of student neighbors who have no idea their Huskies got out again. Meanwhile their Pit is sitting on the front porch after escaping but choosing not to wander.

It's a nice area but we're leaving the state. Ha. Getting acreage and cattle fencing. 

I also want to air some grievances about people adopting cat after cat after cat and letting them out to become coyote chow. I have to watch some Seinfeld now."
DoggyDNA,ff7f2fp,t3_ervezz,1579648067.0,That's cool. He's gorgeous (and perfectly named).
Diwives,ff70oha,t3_erqc6w,1579638773.0,Lovely. Well done.
HomeImprovement,fewpkna,t3_eqrkpl,1579417582.0,My bf breaks everything he touches. It's me or paid pros.
visualsnow,fewi6ja,t1_fev3w8p,1579411025.0,Go for it. It's only a diet. You can always quit. Track your macros so you get enough electrolytes.  I hope you find something that works for you.
visualsnow,fewhpx7,t1_feuf3e9,1579410783.0,"It's complicated as I have a 29 year history of tweaking the diet. I started with crude shakes and ended up going back to shakes a few years ago. I'm very lucky that a commercially available shake works for me now. There was nothing available to buy before. So, two shakes a day plus one meal with the fam. 

If you're interested in high fat low carb for epilepsy, there's a ton of info out there. You can tailor something to your tastes. Good luck."
visualsnow,feu1mm2,t3_eql5gy,1579382193.0,TBI caused. I eat an epilepsy control diet.
AskOldPeople,feqbqwk,t3_eqaw65,1579339898.0,Take excellent care of your teeth. Not good. Not okay. Excellent. Make them last.

visualsnow,feeend6,t1_feec2kf,1579032184.0,"Sorry. That sucks. You may be on to something because mine is from a childhood traumatic brain injury (when another 7 year old tried to kill me). I also had a big incident triggered later when my mother hit my head too hard.

Ever have any epileptic seizures? Absence seizures, auras?

Hope you're okay."
minimalism,feaydjj,t3_eo7cc0,1578953507.0,"It all comes out in the wash.

Sorry. I've always wanted to say that. 

You could try washing your dirty clothes less frequently. Hanging them up to air out. Maybe own an old school valet for this purpose. I know raw denim people who never wash their pants."

dogs,feaah38,t3_eo5tdp,1578946285.0,"1. Never give a pet as a present. Husband needs to pick out his own dog.
2. Everyone in the house should want a dog and, you know, like them.
3. Super senior people have incredibly delicate skin. No dog. No cat. Respect the people and their delicate selves.
4. They're staying with family members? Sounds unstable. Wait for stability. 
5. The woman described a stuffed animal. She's not ready for the responsibility and neither is the husband. Take him hiking with someone else's dogs. Ease him into it."
AskOldPeople,fdxuwnd,t3_en89ip,1578773143.0,I still feel like a toddler.
visualsnow,fds7k02,t3_emxgqu,1578696138.0,"You'll be fine. I'm one of the worst cases and IDGAF about it. 

I don't know of any born with it cases who progressively got worse like you're worrying about. I had sudden onset due to traumatic brain injury."
dogs,fdj3ijj,t3_ele34n,1578457473.0,"There are three or four examples of physical abuse listed here. The spinning in the air, nail clipping to induce pain, holding a pose as long as possible and running in circles as long as possible. The law may not care about mental abuse but it definitely has consequences for physical abuse.

Call animal control and be assertive about what you have witnessed. They can convince the roommate to sign the animal over to avoid any further problems.

Your roommate is not someone you should be around either. Prepare to move out asap.

Since OP has deleted their account, I'm not sure where any of this is going. Fuck. I hope the whole thing was fake.

Edit: I forgot to mention that the dog appears not to care because it has been broken by abuse. It needs rescuing. Now."
pulpfiction,fdfugx7,t3_ekvrzk,1578370527.0,"Are there vanity plates on the car Keitel drives in Point of No Return? Because he's a cleaner in that film, I often think of it when thinking about Wolf."
AskOldPeople,fdedspi,t3_ekwph9,1578336832.0,"Yes but I grew up in cool 70's and 80's SoCal. The only adults I knew who didn't cuss freely were considered backwards. The non-cussers weren't religious so that's not the reason. Sporting events in particular were full of pot smoking and shit talking. Shit and all of her variants were the most common words followed by fucking, fuck, fucker and motherfucker. 

I had just seen Mame and made tracking speech a hobby for a while. Shithead and ""No shit, Sherlock!"" were my personal favorites."
reactivedogs,fdb0q67,t1_fdama6p,1578252394.0,Please be careful. I've seen some pretty nasty forearm (and one chest) bites on people who scooped up a dog who then redirected a bite onto them.
DoggyDNA,fdayf6m,t1_fd8con8,1578251774.0,She's stunning. Obviously in the right home. Lucky dog.

minimalism,fcymnqq,t3_ejdbnh,1578082862.0,"I'm probably old enough to be your mom and it all sounds great to me (especially in comparison to neckbeard nests). 

I love a good futon. Just not advisable here in the desert due to bugs.

It could be that they are throwing around words like extremist in response to your attitude. Are you proselytizing minimalism? Do you come off as judgemental about their habits? They might be a little defensive or maybe they're saboteurs. You know how people try to sabotage dieters? It's a very human thing to do. Don't worry about it. Be yourself and let them be themselves, too."
twinpeaks,fcwoout,t3_eisbp9,1578031836.0,"When this first aired, I was ethereally whooshed right out of the Galactica's airlock.

I was Laura Palmer's age and already an old SoCal punk. This was not cool. One of the joys of Twin Peaks was enjoying things outside of my bubble so I was fine with it. Wild at Heart is cool in its goofiness. Twin Peaks is just Twin Peaks. Sometimes you just gotta let the awkwardly uncomfortable weird flow."

declutter,fcvnm7s,t3_eivfwr,1578005985.0,"I also found the (California for me) bugout bag experiences of the last year very educational.

I hope you stay safe and the burning stops."
AskOldPeople,fcrz04e,t3_eilvly,1577908667.0,"No. Firm no. Are you out of your freaking mind no. 

We were wild. If we had social media, we would have stayed home and accomplished zero worthwhile hell raising. 

It was hard enough to set down the bowl of Cap'n Crunch without knocking over the bong while heading out the door. Imagine trying to accomplish that while trolling and with unlimited access to porn."
AskOldPeople,fcpqnl4,t3_eieey8,1577870037.0,8 years old. Probably watching TV while my dad slept. I used to go to bed after 1 am. Sometimes stayed up all night. The late night movie channels were the shit.
reactivedogs,fcl3hq2,t3_ehq95e,1577738997.0,"Could have shutdown from over-stimulation and new situations. I do think owners contribute (I have PTSD just like my dog) but don't forget the possibility of a shutdown. People often interpret shutdowns as good behavior.

I have one dog whose fear coma gets ""good boy!"" comments from everyone including pet related professionals."
visualsnow,fckri8b,t3_ehojce,1577731622.0,It's made me pretty stoic.
RedditForGrownups,fckr0o2,t3_ehphu1,1577731320.0,"I find this a really attractive idea as well. Jenny, of Missouri Star Quilt Company, has taken over several stores in her town and turned it into a bit of a sewing Mecca. Natalie Chanin, of Alabama Chanin, has hired workers from closed down textile mills. 

I love the idea of moving back and creating help through doing something. Doing what though? And do you have the drive of Jenny and Natalie? I don't, unfortunately. Good luck. I would love to read your success story someday."

I think rehoming is frequently the best option. Read this book, OP. I like all of McConnell's books (especially the separation anxiety book) but this one is really important."

I'm sorry this bs happened at all. I've lived in several neighborhoods and there are always  neighbors who help each other with can placement and removal. It's not a big deal. Back when we had metal cans without wheels, it was not a big deal. That guy is making himself miserable."
