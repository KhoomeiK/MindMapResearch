VetTech,ff8xxv0,t3_es3ho2,1579699661.0,In my state that is so illegal. We aren’t allowed to restrain for X-rays. Either sedation or we strap them down. All states vary I guess but definitely that isn’t safe

Needafriend,ff5kt6m,t1_ff5k5la,1579597683.0,Nope; tomorrow is luckily my day off that I usually spend cleaning and hanging out with my kid. But who needs to clean when I can nap instead haha
Needafriend,ff5jz91,t1_ff5jsw4,1579596480.0,I just happened to be more awake than usually when my fiancé and I go to bed so i stayed up. And if I don’t take my sleeping meds at that time I don’t sleep. Insomnia is Satan and I miss one dose and I’m up all night no problem. So I’ve been cleaning quietly and organizing. My fiancé is annoyed I’m still up but like... I can’t take my meds or I won’t wake up until like noon and I definitely don’t want to lay in bed and stare at the ceiling for hours. So it just kinda sucks.

FreeCompliments,ff3a042,t1_ff3500d,1579537149.0,"Self care is my current goal. I’m not going to go out of my way for awhile but if a situation presents itself I’ll help. But I’m going to cut back on all the extra acts of good I’ve been doing. At least for a little bit. Ive been reading a lot of self improvement books. It’s hard focusing on me since that’s something I’ve never really done. I’ve always been the person people come to for help, not the other way around. So it’s definitely weird and new territory doing things that I enjoy."
FreeCompliments,ff32zog,t1_feymusi,1579532345.0,"Thank you! I really am trying my best. I tend to take care of everyone else except for myself and i am one that will jump at anything that needs assistance. You need a ride? Sure. You’re short on rent and need $40? Here have $80 so you can buy dinner. Feeling down? I’ll be right over with snacks. Sometimes I buy flowers for random people I don’t know and I’ll sit and talk to homeless people when they come up to me and ask for a cigarette. Not once has anyone done any of that for me, and I really don’t expect anyone to. But if I’m able to help or spare a few dollars I’m going to. No questions asked. 

I have everyone’s back even though I am struggling financially and in my own state of depression.  I just feel I’ve given all my energy into helping other people (who never return the same gestures) and I’ve been trying to discover extra energy to be able to help ME. It’s hard and I will never stop helping people. I just need to figure out how to help myself at the same time"
FreeCompliments,feyl99c,t1_feykyr4,1579447091.0,Honestly tradition eastern medicine is amazing. I’ve also been learning about feng shui and trying a bunch of natural stuff like essential oils. At this point in my life in open to trying everything because what I’ve been doing obviously isn’t helping
FreeCompliments,feyjkvf,t1_fewz5sm,1579446356.0,I have considered acupuncture. I actually just started working for a veterinarian that specializes in traditional Chinese herbal medicine and acupuncture and they work with both animals and humans. I’ve been studying up on them both and plan to get acupuncture done hopefully in the near future
FreeCompliments,feyjc05,t1_fey7s7w,1579446237.0,"Thank you so much! And yes, the hoodie. So glad I found another Naruto fan! As horrible as the Akatsuki are, they are quite badass and I love it. 

Definitely working on bettering myself. I even bought a book titled ‘Get your sh*t together’. Trying to eat better, write down my goals for the day so I don’t end up laying in bed all day, and getting back into yoga and meditating. I’m working hard towards managing my bipolar better and it’s hard as hell. 

Oh and I haven’t bought any cigarettes since the new year and I’ve smoked for 10 years and I’m only 24. So that’s a feat in my book."

bipolar,fedfu6e,t1_feci3ov,1579010376.0,I’ve recently cut back on how many clients I see and I’m currently not taking new clients. Maybe I’ll start up again in the future but right now I’m just laying low with it. In my area this sort of thing picks up in the summer and is pretty quiet in the winter anyway.

bipolar,fedfl6x,t1_febta6a,1579010180.0,That’s amazing! I had a few friends like that in high school. Unfortunately my horrible self cut ties years ago and haven’t been able to form new connections.

VetTech,fdnzpb5,t1_fdnyr7p,1578596128.0,"I will never understand it either. And he’s the sweetest boy ever. The owner is a physician assistant and the whole appointment was hell. Because, ya know, she does human medicine so she knows all the answers. I hope he turns out alright too. As of right now there is no definitive reason why he’s in the condition he’s in. There is just so much going on it’s hard to tell what’s causing his symptoms."
VetTech,fdnyicw,t1_fdny3zd,1578595434.0,"It’s hard to tell in the image but also trace anaplasma! He’s alive. He’s in hospital right now. Haven’t started immiticide yet. We are working on getting him stabilized first. He’s got foul breath, mouth ulcerations (it looks like stomatitis), and excessive drooling. He initially had a temp of 104 but now it’s down to 101. He’s a good boy. An “outside dog”, the woman insists he’s NEVER had a tick. But he never comes inside. I hate people."
