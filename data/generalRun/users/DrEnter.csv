You've probably had a few coronaviruses in your lifetime.  Up to 20% of what we think is just a ""common cold"" is probably a coronavirus instead of the more ""common cold"" caused by a rhinovirus.  Most of the time, they are pretty similar and more of a nuisance than anything else.

2019-nCoV seems to be a bit more dangerous than typical, more along the lines of SARS and MERS (also coronavirus variants).  We still don't know the exact method of contagion.  Hopefully, it won't be as contagious as [SARS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amoy_Gardens) nor as deadly as [MERS](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4631129/).

Most pensions are not managed by Unions, but either by independent organizations or the companies themselves.  Here's a good example:  https://articles2.marketrealist.com/2017/12/analyzing-boeings-pension-plan/#

technology,fdj5wvo,t1_fdi8dfk,1578459336.0,"Both of your arguments are some serious ""fair weather"" thinking.

If you think you are going to be able to get 15-20% more than a few times you are fooling yourself.  Even in the Valley, that's only going to last 4 or 5 transitions before you start to look pretty unappealing to a hiring manager.  Personally, if I see someone with 5 years of experience spread over 4 or more jobs, I'll pass (in fact, I did that very thing today).  If you can't stick with a company for more than 2 years, why would I want to spend 3-6 months getting you acclimated to the organization when you are going to leave after a year?  Not to mention the fact that once you have a family, those transitions are not nearly so easy.  It's better for a lot of people to get 5-10% more to start, guaranteed CoL increases and 5-15% merit-based yearly raises on top of that--and yes that is absolutely the kind of thing that a union gives you.  Also maybe worth noting that most companies won't even let you participate in their 401k plan until you've been there 6-12 months, so I guess if you leave every year you aren't saving much.

Pensions do invest in index funds, as well as a lot of other things, including things most investors don't have access to.  But honestly, those details are unimportant because your pension is **guaranteed**:  You can't outlive your savings (like you can with a 401k or IRA) and you aren't subject to losing your retirement due to market fluctuations.

https://www.forbes.com/sites/mattcarey/2017/06/05/5-ways-a-401k-isnt-as-good-as-a-pension/#3eafbf0a567f

One last detail worth mentioning:  I've worked for two places that gave pensions (only one long enough to vest it), but both of those (the U.S. Gov. and HP) **also** gave me a 401k/TSP.  As the HP hiring manager put it, the relative cost for the 401k was nothing next to the pension, so they saw it as a low-cost added benefit (I think they only matched up to a 3% 401k contribution then)."

I live in Atlanta.  A lot of work was done in the last 35 years to establish an urban tree canopy in the city.  Problem is, almost every tree that was planted was an oak tree.

To see why that's a problem, I'll give a personal example:  We bought a house a few years ago on a 50 x 200 foot plot of land (normal for an old in-town lot).  The house took up about half the lot.  Over the 15 years we lived there, we had to remove 8 mature oak trees due to tree health issue, tree death, or imminent threat to property.  Now, 8 trees may not seem like a lot, but take this into account:
> According to the Lady Bird Johnson Wildflower Center at the University of Texas at Austin, live oak trees should each receive at least 180 square feet when initially planted. They should be 40 to 50 feet away from all other trees. Allow an additional 15 to 20 feet between the live oak and your home, driveway or any other structure.

Starting to get the picture?  We couldn't remove those trees _until they died or started to die_ or _unless they directly and absolutely threatened the house_, but there were far too many of them for the amount of space available.  In fact, those 8 oak trees were all the trees on the lot, and every one of them died:  7 because they were too close to each other and one because it was basically planted in a hole surrounded by concrete (the alley behind the house and the drive way), effectively starving it.  Everyone was in such a rush to plant trees, no one was thinking about doing it intelligently or with any variety.  We replaced those oaks as they died with more appropriate trees for the lot and spacing:  A magnolia, a non-fruiting cherry, two plums (I love plum trees), a peach, a pecan, and a birch.  They are all still doing a lot better than those (then 20 year-old) oaks."

My wife never watched it and isn't a huge sci-fi fan, but she is really enjoying it.  I don't think there is a single other sci-fi series with such well-developed characters.
