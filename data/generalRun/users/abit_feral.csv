gifs,ffezmrg,t1_ff8ltda,1579871488.0,So a chief of the fire department said their fire season is from Feb to March. These fires started in October! That's 3 months ahead of what they expect. That is a whole season length of time. Do you see where I'm going with this? Climate change and global warming has everything to do with These fires. Yes and I do agree with you us humans are 100% to blame. Not literally lighting the fires. Because remember Scotty M made that whole arson story up to avoid the media's attention to the actual problem that he doesn't believe in which is fact climate change.

declutter,fcc5m02,t1_fc96nhy,1577594677.0,"Clutter and hoarding is actually a mental disorder. There is a lot of anxiety/ adhd I involvement. My areas have always been messy and I love to clean and tidy up but I could never figure out why my areas were constantly messy. I've been recently (I'm 33 F by the way) diagnosed with anxiety/add and having messy areas is part of the symptoms. The  mess becomes to much and I can't deal with it. Yes having a minimalist lifestyle helps but your husband has to accept some things about himself before he work on himself. As for you, pressure causes resistants. Yes he will declutter a little so you don't leave but it won't last and you be unhappy again. Support your husband and help him."
