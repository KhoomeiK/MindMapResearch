unity,fel83np,t1_fekpovy,1579216102.0,"Sorry, I wrote some bad stuff as I was on mobile and short on time.

First, there is a bug with your clamp lines. Here:

    0 GetComponent<Rigidbody2D>().position = new Vector2(
    1   Mathf.Clamp(GetComponent<Rigidbody2D>().position.x, 
    2     boundaries.xMin, boundaries.xMax),
    3   Mathf.Clamp(GetComponent<Rigidbody2D>().position.x, <<
    4     boundaries.yMin, boundaries.yMax));

Note that you are clamping `position.x` twice, but you actually want `position.y` on line 3.

Next, what are your `boundaries` xMin and xMax actually set to? Are they set to -0.12 and 0.12? This is why I ask what happens if you remove the clamp lines. If that fixes your problem, you know the issue is with those commands.

If no clues there, then perhaps something is blocking your rigidbody? Are there any other physical objects in the way?

If not that...then I do not know and I hope someone else can help.


Finally, I want to explain my comment about `GetComponent` calls. I think as you are beginner learning this is not necessary information, but it is good to know that `GetComponent` is an expensive function to call many times each frame. This is not a problem with just one object, but if you have many many objects all with their own `FixedUpdate()`, they will slow things down. So the easy way to solve this is to do what's called 'caching' the reference to the Rigidbody2D component when the object first spawns. This means, we store a reference to the rigidbody on the object so we don't need to search for it any more with `GetComponent()`. That's as a simple as:

    private Rigidbody2D rb2D;
    private void Start()
    {
        rb2D = GetComponent<Rigidbody2D>();
    }

You have now 'cached' the Rigidbody2D component reference inside your script as the variable `rb2D`.

From then on you can simply use `rb2D` instead of `GetComponent<Rigidbody2D>()`, and it is less work for the CPU to retrieve. Instead of asking ""Do I have a rigidbody2D and where is it?"", it now says, ""Here is the rigidbody2D."""
unity,feke19x,t3_epmjzd,1579198089.0,"You’re clamping position.x twice.

What happens if you remove the clamps? Does it work then?

Using getcomponent so many times each update is bad form. It’s more efficient to get it in Start() and store as a variable, then use that variable later instead of recalling getcomponent.

I'm sure that Fly Damage Over Time has some buggy interactions with the gas clouds. It's like the gas clouds retaliate at the end of the *next* turn once they are hit by a fly, and its very confusing.

Here's what happens:

- fly hits enemy through cloud
- cloud decreases in size or disappears
- at the end of the *next* turn, you get attacked by the cloud (even if the cloud has disappeared)

howdidtheycodeit,fd8lrea,t3_ekawse,1578219864.0,"Explained most simply, it's using a constructive solid geometry API to manipulate the geometry of the world in real-time:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructive_solid_geometry

Moving objects like crates or spheres are not stored as geometry but instead as entity types/positions/rotations.

The photos themselves are just images representing the stored geometry data.

Here are a bunch of APIs available on GitHub in C#: https://www.bing.com/search?q=csg+csharp+api&form=EDGEAR&qs=PF&cvid=5dd8844d3e21481fbad51ebd36da0ccc&cc=GB&setlang=en-GB&plvar=0"
howdidtheycodeit,fd8l0ah,t3_ekawse,1578219597.0,"(*edit* oops I replied twice, and thought I'd deleted this post. I'll leave it here though.)

I would guess, locate an API for constructive solid geometry manipulation, which you would use for carving the photos into the world.

Perhaps something like: Take photo, store image of the perspective, use the CSG to capture the scene bounded by a trapezoid (the camera frustrum) and store the data. Any movable objects, don't store their geometry and instead store their position/rotation/type/etc within the data.

Then when you place the photo back into the world, take that stored geometry data and first carve out the trapezoid from the world where you're facing to make room for the new geometry, and then add in the contents of the stored data to the scene, again using CSG to 'add' it to the world geometry. All movable actors then get spawned and positioned at their relative positions."
