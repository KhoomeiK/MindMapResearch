Especially if it's something wild like that and not her throwing him a party for his birthday or something like that. My boy gets confidentiality. My boys girl doesn't."

He needs to speak up and let his boy know what's up. If YOUR girl was texting another guy telling him she can't stop thinking about how funny and cute he is, you'd want to know."

It creates this dating atmosphere where ghosting or cheating are both simple and easy, so having and maintaining a monogamous relationship is X amount more difficult because people have this idea that they have options and everyone's replaceable at a drop of a dime, because now they are to a degree."

French,ffbw0g6,t3_esjzl2,1579784628.0,"If you're using it for a hobby, it is somewhat. Especially if you live somewhere where there's not a lot of native speakers living. But that doesn't mean you shouldn't do it if you're doing it for the interest in learning languages.

If you're using it for professional reasons, then it depends what you do with it. The more rare the language is the more its worth, so a language that's not so widespread, like lets say Rundi, is more lucrative endeavor than learning Spanish or french. Not to say you couldn't do anything with it, but a less widespread language 

I at one point wanted to be a polyglot; a person who speaks 4 or more languages, but after learning a bit of french (my attempt at a 3rd language) and realizing you lose what you don't continuously use, I realized that that FOR ME, it wasn't worth the time put in, because 5 months after the classes i could barely recollect anything more than a handful of phrases."
