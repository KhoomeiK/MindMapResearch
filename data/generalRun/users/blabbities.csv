My dude. When I read this I thought you were about to say 3 years. 3 months! Dont worry man. 3 months is nothing. It literally took me decades to even truly understand programming (no thanks to stupidly complex jargon use in programming or OOP concepts didn't help).

I can't really add more than I'm sure others have said. Though, you definitely have to think of programming as tortoise rather than a hare. There are a truly truly.ton of things that need to be understood/built upon little by little for the click to happen. For some it's easier for others like me it's decades worth of hard.

I will say that what really helped me was to A) be jobless so that I could set a month to completely dedicate uninterrupted my focus on several python stufying and mostly B) *ATTEMPT* (because I failed initially) to build something independently that I needed.

So I'd be highly suspect  independent repair laws would have any burgeoning affect on this for shops. If need be l it is generally desolderable as well and replaceable by a Technicians no problem. My HTC Desire Z suffered from a manufacturing defect in the emmc and that was the only replacement. A few variety of LG devices from 2010-2015ish had issues where the the cpu needed to be recalled or there would be a slow death. What was funny was LG would at first deny deny deny your device repair if you didn't have any more warranty coverage/bought it second hand. Thus I had to hunt a local.independent repair shop with BGA equipment. All easily accesible. What isn't easily accessible to repair is as you said perma bonded batteries to the chassis (without access to something like a sonic.

That isnt a desktop support role. That sounds like pure helpdesk. The time I worked Desktop Support. I was literally at their desktops as a dispatch. That sort of pure helpdesk you're right...probably wont teach you much since you are just a glorified ticket assigner lol. Though, when I actually did Desktop Support. I learned a bit. Granted. Alot of my desktop support that I credit with teaching me what I needed was done in the military and therefore as stratified teams I had a lot more flexibility because we wore multiple hats (mainly ACLs on switches, networking, firmware upgrades, and AD)

Though, to be honest even when I worked desktop support (deskside wise) outside the miitary I learned a lot of shit that comes in handy later. I wrote a separate reply before reading comments here. Though, I mentioned one IT dumb girl friend of mine who comes from no IT background. Do you think she would know how to deploy patches, how to access the registry, how to review system logs, where to check for common malware persistence, windows ACLs, windows NACLs, Group Policy control, securing DS, even just recognizing rogue services is useful etc, etc. It's a big big big task in Security field to be honest. Previous experience in IT does really help....(and if not that being a very fast learner).
