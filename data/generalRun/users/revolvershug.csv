AskReddit,ffv21c4,t3_ev8yi4,1580253871.0,"My ex-husband is going to be 40 soon, our entire relationship he said how his mother is such a great cook. He was an Italian from Brooklyn, so I assumed, little Italian lady must be a great cook... She. Was. AWFUL. The literal worst & my grandmother has been voted ineligible to bring food to family functions, so I have met some pretty bad cooks. I'm sure he still thinks she is the best, I guess its what you grow up with."
