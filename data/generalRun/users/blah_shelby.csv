I believe part of the issue the younger generation is having is we’re being told that it’s OUR fault we don’t have the same opportunities as previous generations. They had it so much easier and then they tell us we just aren’t working hard enough, when that isn’t the case, it’s just a different world now."

unexpectedoffice,fdvhic2,t1_fdvb6i3,1578747515.0,"I believe there are two concert episodes. The second or third episode of the first season where Red tells Eric not to take the car out of town so naturally they try to go to a concert (Van Halen maybe?) but the battery dies on the way so they trade Jackie and Kelso’s tickets for a new battery with the mechanic who brings his bf to the show. And then somewhere towards the second half of the whole show, there’s the Ted Nugent concert where Fez and Hyde sell counterfeit shirts that are spelled wrong and Donna leaves Eric behind to go backstage. I’m thinking it’s probably the latter since that one makes more sense for interaction with a janitor."

They had police at their door multiple times and the poor kid was labeled a freak for the next 2 years. He didn’t even brag about the guns, one of his friends mentioned it in a “joking” way, it got overheard, and spiraled out of control. Yes it’s a serious issue but we can’t be accusing everyone of being a threat."

CasualConversation,fdn770c,t1_fdmq17x,1578579162.0,"I’ve “run away” from my parents twice now. The first time I was 18 and lived with my bf at the time until he turned out to be abusive, so I left him and rented my best friends room from her parents since she had left for college. Had to go back to my parents after a while because I was struggling to afford anything at all. 

The other time was 2 years ago, I already had an apartment but my parents were still supporting me for the most part, I got really sick and they continuously accused me of faking it (it’s a long story that I won’t go into) so I turned off my phone and stopped answering the door. I didn’t talk to them for a year and a half, during which I survived by putting everything on credit cards for a couple months (don’t recommend at all) and then moved to a new state and started a new life. 

I now have a better relationship with my parents than ever before because they treat me like an adult individual instead of just their child."
