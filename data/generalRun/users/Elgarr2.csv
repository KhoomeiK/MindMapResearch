You are right, leaving it a couple of years to see how it is then would make sense, if the UK has made a massive mistake and shouldn’t have left, but only then will you be able to tell after 2021 when the deal is either sorted or if we crash out, but at the moment as this hasn’t been done before no one knows. Everyone from both sides claims it’s either the best thing or worst thing while at the same time not having a clue themselves as they don’t have the power of foresight!"
worldnews,ffzf2s5,t1_ffzemdr,1580375833.0,"But they are pro UK more.
Sturgeon would find another reason to want another vote if she lost again, and again and again, it was once in a lifetime, why don’t people get that.
She claims because she got a large majority that was a mandate for a 2nd ref, it wasn’t people just hated labour, Ruth Davidson had stepped down, which only just under 2 years previous had taken massive chunks from them. So many things people looking from the outside in don’t know or realise.
When you voting, so many vote for the individual leading not just the policy, that’s why labour was destroyed this time round, also why the tories lost the seats they had won in Scotland under Ruth.
If u go to to many Scottish websites and forums so many are sick of the idea of another referendum and want them to actually get on with sorting out Scotland first, because in their eyes if they can’t do that now, being able to do it when an Independant state when they already have so many powers and don’t is going to ruin the country."

I have to say though, I get tired of hearing  this argument about it’s the safest way to travel compared to cars
If you put as many helicopters/planes in the sky as there is 4 wheeled vehicles  on the road it isn’t.
I hate flying and my father was a pilot (no he didn’t die flying)to those who think otherwise let’s see a few million planes flying nose to tail and see if it’s the same. No way, on earth or having pilots who have just passed their test without someone who can take over in case of an emergency, so many factors they don’t account for!
