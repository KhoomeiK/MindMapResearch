belgium,fgfqadi,t1_fgfkcwb,1580745184.0,"That just doesn't make sense. That's like saying if you vote for a party that is for stricter energy regulations for building houses, you are voting against CD&V. Hell, I didn't vote VB and yet I'm against the cordon. And I don't think I'm a special person.

I think it's just dumb when you are voting for a party for the sole reason it is not an other party."

As for the Walloons, I don't know... Any Walloons here that can confirm Dutch and German sounds the same?"
belgium,fgercbq,t1_fgbmq52,1580707337.0,"Not sure if you are talking about Wallonia when you say half, or just half of Flanders (I'm going to assume the latter, because we'll be in a whole different ball park if we are going to discuss the differences between Flanders and Wallonia). 

More than half of Flanders didn't vote VB. But, more than half of Flanders didn't vote CD&V, Open VLD, Groen, Spa and PVDA either. Not even half of Flanders voted for NVA. So, not sure what your point is here...

By the way, it is not VB versus the rest, there are 7 parties worth mentioning and they can't get along (proved by the fact they can't form a coalition). The left doesn't want to work with the right, the right doesn't want to work with the left and the middle doesn't know what they want."
belgium,fgbp7n3,t1_fgbmq52,1580664682.0,"More than half the country didn't vote for CD&V, or OpenVLD, or Groen, or SP.A, or PVDA, or even NVA. It's not VB versus a group of likeminded parties, there are 7 parties worth mentioning, and they all have different views and values, and they all represent different portions of the population. And the non-VB parties proved they can't get along by not being able to form a coalition even though combined they make up 75% of the population.
Most logical coalition would be NVA and VB, they would represent the 2 largest groups of flemish people and make up a total of about 60% of the population.

It just doesn't make sense to ignor the second biggest group of people."
belgium,fgawzks,t1_fga711e,1580656325.0,"I agree on that last part and Tom V.G. falls in both categories...
But the traditional parties will have to find a way to work with them. The more they try to ban VB, the more votes VB is getting. People are tired of all the problems with migration and traditional parties are more concerned with their own agenda then finding solutions. The signal has been given last election, but still they can't get beyond throwing shit at eachother and not accomplishing anything. If they can't figure out something now, I fear VB will keep growing until they have enough to form a gouvernment with a smaller partner and then shit has hit the fan."
belgium,fga7vsj,t1_fg9q38j,1580647914.0,"If you wanna judge on populism, 90% of politicians will fall into that category. Just look at the cordon sanitaire: 3 years ago, it was as firm as ever. VB gains some popularity and all of a sudden, all the other parties start talking about breaking the cordon.

And indeed, hate groups and neonazis will flock to VB, but same can be said about communists and the PS. Extreme groups tend to flock to the party that is most on their side of the spectrum. I would say VB is as legit as PS."
belgium,fg92zjs,t1_fg920gw,1580633567.0,"Don't be sorry, it's a perfectly understandable sentiment. VB is a bad party imo, they are the ones that don't like immigrants and are frequently compared with nazis, but I feel they have grown from being a hate party to being legit, though still having some extreme viewpoints (not nazi extreme, but still very polarized)."
belgium,fg90wb2,t1_fg909l9,1580632889.0,"How is VB threatening the democracy? Not meant to sound angry or anything, just a genuine question.
If they fuck up, people should/will vote differently next elections, no?"
belgium,fg90n9h,t1_fg8z711,1580632757.0,"Where is this coalition you speak of? Last time I checked, we still don't have a gouvernment. It's not just VB vs non-VB. The left doesn't want to work with the right, the center changes it's mind every day, and every party is busy with their own priorities. The voters have given a clear signal in the last elections, but instead of finding a constructive way to work with VB, the traditional parties are still trying to keep them out of everything.

belgium,fg8wixq,t3_ex98ep,1580630725.0,"Though I don't support VB views for the most part and I think they are too extreme, I hope there will be new elections and I hope they win enough to form a gouvernment on their own. It seems like the whole purpose of democratic elections is gone. It used to be about 'letting the people decide', but when the people decide VB should be a part of the gouvernment, the 'traditional' parties will do whatever they can to circumvent them ever taking part in leading this country. Let them run things for a change! Either they fail miserably, everybody learns and we can find a better solution. Or, they will actually do a good job for the majority of the population and then they deserve to lead.

And I know it won't be good for a lot of people when they lead, so this next sentence is going to sound harsh, yet I firmly believe it. If I don't like a party and they win the elections, I can either suck it up and deal with it, or I can leave and go somewhere where my views fit better with the rest of the community."

I did a skydive the week before and forgot my jacket when I went home, so I was going to pick it up. When I got there, there were a lot of cars park next to the entrance road, so I was getting suspicious. I drove to the small parking lot next to the main building, where I parked the week before and there was a guy standing at the entrance that I recognized as the guy that did the administration for my skydive. I just did the man-wave (raising the hand with your index finger extended slighty more than the other fingers) and nodded, and he looked a bit puzzled, but didn't stop me from driving through. I entered the building through the side door that linked it to the parking lot, and people were asking who I was, etc...

Now before anyone tears me a new one... It is rape if you force someone to drink with the intent of having sex with them after they are too drunk to comprehend what is going on. It is rape if you drug someone. It is rape if someone says 'no' whilst drunk, even though they might not have the clarity to resist you."
