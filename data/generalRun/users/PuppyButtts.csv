personaltraining,fgo87uk,t3_ezdgtu,1580962217.0,"I don’t have any fatigue in my lower back from squatting. People tend to try to go too low, and they also tend to over-arch their back when squatting. Try to get a neutral spine and only go to parallel. Film yourself to see what you look like until you get it right. If you still have lower back pain you might want to lower the weight and strengthen your back more,  or try to stretch more to improve mobility. Good luck"

relationships,feyj6mx,t3_eqw1r9,1579446170.0,"I have stardew and marry people, my sister even dowbloaded “10,000 husbands” or whatever and our SO doesnt care. HOWEVER this is how she feels and you love her. Is it really a big deal to NOT be in a relationship with Merril in game to save your real relationship? Maybe tell her that you will stop doing it but maybe also say how the character reminds you of her. 

I know its bigger than this, but tbh an in game relationship is less important than a real relationship. Once you stop the thing with Merril, maybe talk to your girlfriend about it more in depth when she isnt so upset by it. Ask her why it bothers her and since she has played the game, hasnt she done the same thing? Try and make it relatable. “You like the game also, dont you want to see the whole story? I wouldn’t mind if you got together with so-and-so male in game because its just a game that we both play.”

EDIT: people are talking about red flags, but you have to be the judge. Is this the first time she has been jealous, or does it happen a lot? Is this just some weird 1-time thing she doesnt like, or does she get mad even when you have to interact with women on a daily basis like at work?"
relationships,feyhrg1,t3_eqvljs,1579445753.0,"Uhhh I would want to know that its happening. Literally asap before i pay for wedding stuff. I would just want you to call me and be like “hey I need to talk to you, its about (ex) and very important. I can tell you now or we can meet up, your choice.

Edit:be nice to her and just say it how you would want to hear it. Explain that you were outraged when you found out and that you told him to tell you, but then took matters into your own hands when he wouldnt because no one deserves to be lied to and cheated on.  Etc etc. let her know youll answer any questions"
