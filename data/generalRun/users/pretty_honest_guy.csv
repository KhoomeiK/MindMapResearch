WGU,fdoxqlx,t3_emajch,1578615286.0,"The 84 is great. Whatever you do, DON’T wing the OA for C278 if you are barely competent on the PA. If you fail the OA the retake plan is horrendous. It took me 2ish months to do the retake plan and a majority of the questions in the book don’t even pertain to the OA."

HumansBeingBros,fcxeq14,t3_ejcfdt,1578060978.0,I learned the hard way that you don’t call the cops if you get into accidents in some countries. I literally had to bribe the cop to not arrest me for “wasting his time”.
business,fcn563r,t1_fcn4p22,1577803552.0,Decorah is actually the only spot in the state I like. The Loess Hills are *okay*.  Every time I’ve gone to southern Iowa it is a shithole.
business,fcn3gbe,t1_fcn0uja,1577802207.0,"Anyone that argues Iowa has forests is bullshitting you. Iowa just has patches of miscellaneous garbage trees and smells like hog shit. We also have regressive politics and have a governor that vetos MMJ bills due to her alcoholism(fun fact she’s had 2 DUIs as well.)

Source: unfortunate Iowan."

Economics,fckoaoy,t1_fcko0za,1577729649.0,"I wish I was joking but a friend from high school collects SSDI because “working makes him depressed” 

I totally understand the need for SSDI. My FIL was an accountant and had a massive stroke. He literally cannot work anymore."
Economics,fcknp11,t1_fcknkht,1577729274.0,My coworker went into the SSA and said there were able bodied people driving newer cars than him begging for more disability money.
Economics,fckngqs,t1_fckn37y,1577729131.0,"I’m not shitting you, my wife works for an investment firm and she said the people that will actually be able to retire and receive benefits are cashing out retirement accounts just to buy vehicles. 

Here I am thinking, well shit. I’m just trying to save and invest enough that I’ll be able to make it off my own funds til I die. 

Hardly any of my friends have even considered saving and investing."

todayilearned,fc6dxfz,t1_fc67rfg,1577478286.0,"The ONLY thing Toyota needs is a diesel/1 ton truck(350/3500 equivalency). 

That being said, tundras in my area have an astronomical resale value. There was an old body style one with 300k+ on it that sold for $7-10k."

todayilearned,fc6dhm4,t1_fc6545u,1577477996.0,"I will never fuck with a piece of American garbage again. Between the turbo, wheel bearings, radiator, AC, and awful gas mileage, all on a car with roughly 60k miles on a Cruze I owned I’ll never touch a piece of shit Chevy product again. I have a 2017 Chevy 2500 and this this is also a piece of shit. Literally 15k miles on it and the stereo crashes constantly, the tow mirrors extend by themself, inaccessible interior lights have burned out. 

American is garbage."

Source: I wanted to save a stupid large amount of money when buying my wife’s engagement ring. Turns out Canada has a large market but in the Midwest they are unheard of."
godtiersuperpowers,fc33xdg,t3_eftg31,1577380857.0,I’d find the worst sidewalk/street and walk on it. Then all the people that are disabled can live full lives again. Added bonus would be you’d know who is faking disability.
CrappyDesign,fc2si3d,t1_fc2rx1j,1577372750.0,At the time I had the google device I didn’t own a smart phone. I was late to adopt the smart phone.
CrappyDesign,fc2rlbz,t1_fc2rbrl,1577371977.0,"Unless the google streaming device has changed in the last few years I loathed that thing. Iirc I had to have a separate device with the apps on them to watch TV. 

I will say one thing, with the Roku TVs. They are dirt cheap and the apps stay updated. My parents purchased a name brand smart TV and a year or so after having it they couldn’t use the apps because the manufacturers didn’t update the apps and essentially bricked their own tv."
CrappyDesign,fc2qods,t1_fc2qlpg,1577371181.0,I haven’t had any issues with my roku’s. What do you use?
CrappyDesign,fc2nf5l,t1_fc2mzg1,1577368085.0,More protip: just get a roku and use your phone as a controller and keyboard.

madlads,fbxqv5k,t1_fbxqlhh,1577197972.0,Thank you for that info! I’m not a networking guru(yet) My last networking class was a Cisco class in 2009 so things have made a few leaps and bounds since then.
madlads,fbxljjb,t1_fbxk5tf,1577192899.0,"You had to do a bit of digging for that. I feel weirdly accomplished. Also, $420 TSLA calls indeed paid out. We may be a bunch of artistics but we know how to ~~lose~~ gain all the money!"
madlads,fbxgso9,t1_fbxd5kb,1577186693.0,"No, that’s exactly how it works. On my 5 year old router I can name both bands different things. 2.4ghz could be a completely different name than 5ghz. Actually, it is."
delusionalcraigslist,fbwt7fj,t3_eeugda,1577158785.0,I literally saw this on Facebook this morning. I don’t know if it was a joke or not.
