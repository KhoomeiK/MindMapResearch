You could always feel the trains passing but this was different — it felt like one big jolt and not a small rumble as usual. I always felt like one day the house would collapse with the constant rocking from the trains. 

Damn, dude, I can’t even imagine. They’re not even comparable and scary is scary ya know? It would be completely horrifying to hear a bear roar and not know where it was or if you were in danger while mine was more like a “what the fuck just happened?!” Wouldn’t have even known if it hit me ya know. The ‘looking over your shoulder’ thing is arguably more of a nightmare. I’m glad you’re okay!"

todayilearned,fe6fbj9,t1_fe6eqqv,1578889191.0,"Ha - they were grateful but also like OK lady hold on a sec we don’t have time for lemonade! Omg yes I remember the texting thing being huge, too. I feel like it was a big turning point in texting while operating machinery"
todayilearned,fe6dwyz,t1_fe6bogp,1578888055.0,"That was her fence! I remember when the first fire truck came. They couldn’t get to the site because it’s a weird area.

I remember just waiting for my girlfriend to get home from work and not really recognizing the significance of it until i looked outside and saw the street full of firetrucks and people in the back yard.

Her mom rolled up her sleeves and ran outside to round up the animals and, of course, try to offer everyone home made lemonade"
todayilearned,fe6baee,t1_fe6067b,1578886054.0,"Wow, this is crazy. 

I was dating someone who’s parent’s owned a home along these train tracks at the time. This happened essentially in her back yard. If i remember correctly, her mom was actually the first person to call this in. I’ll never forget the noise it made."

AskReddit,fcss5f2,t1_fcsr10x,1577923738.0,"Hey dude, I feel you. I’ve had the same question in answering this.

I was diagnosed with “manic depression” and have struggled with a lot of negative incidents in my life and I’ve had it for as long as I can remember. Some of it more justified than others.

I don’t know the answer to your question and I don’t know if we’ll ever know if it’s “worth it” to be alive. After all, there is no book that tells us for sure. We could have a destiny, we could all be puppets. No one truly knows.

What I do know is that when we do die, it’s all over. It’s gonna happen regardless so I feel like it is worth it to stick it out and see if we can figure out the answer. 

Right now, we have a choice in what makes something “worth it.” And while I’m in a depressive episode currently, you’re here making an impact on my life by answering a silly question on Reddit. You know?

You do make a difference in the world, even if it’s small and I don’t know if that’s comforting, but you’ve improved my day, and to me that means everything today. So, I would like to think the answer is yes. It’s worth it and my hope for you is that you feel the same!

Cheers, friend! I’m here with you."

AskReddit,fcsnjd7,t1_fcsnggj,1577920439.0,I love this answer so much
AskReddit,fcsn0e8,t1_fcsljnl,1577920059.0,Fair point. What if it had all your future in it?
AskReddit,fcsmvp8,t1_fcsmng7,1577919965.0,"I feel like even when movies are spoiled for me I appreciate the details of them more. 

In any case, I’m glad we’re in the world together and I have no choice but to do the same so I hope the suspense is more of a happy thrill for you, friend"
AskReddit,fcsmmwo,t1_fcsm778,1577919799.0,"Well, yes, among other things like: do we actually ever meet grandpa again and when am I going to make it out of this hole I’m in?"
AskReddit,fcsmckp,t1_fcslq8v,1577919611.0,"Yeah, I feel you. This is where most people I ask this question go. As someone who doesn’t care about spoilers, I feel the opposite. I mean some things would give me anxiety, but I almost feel like if I knew the story I could appreciate things more? I don’t know if that’s silly"

orphanblack,fcbror4,t1_fcbr027,1577590218.0,"She’s unreal. I can’t imagine getting into character who is pretending to be someone pretending to be someone else. She’s easily one of my favorite actresses!

I remember the last rewatch i did i intro’d a friend to the show and every time we wanted to watch an episode we’d just scream “TATIANAAAA” to each other"

Damnthatsinteresting,fbsyht2,t1_fbo3b0j,1577063576.0,"I had something similar to this, and it probably did drastically change the way my smile was. My top jaw ft inside of my bottom jaw, so they had to widen my jaw and then get my teeth to move into place.

However, even if you had a before and after photo of me, it was in my formative years. I was 11 when i got them on and 14 when i got them off and i changed so much in a number of other ways that you can’t actually tell the difference between the transformation they did to my teeth because it’s so gradual and it just feels like a natural “she just grew up” if that makes sense!

You’d almost have to do a projected visual of what I *would have* looked like to really notice the difference"
