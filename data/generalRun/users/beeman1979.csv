educationalgifs,fdtenrf,t1_fdteean,1578715671.0,"Ah, sorry.  

No idea honestly.  I know a lot of beekeepers that just like their boxes to be painted.  But these same beekeepers realize that paraffin dipping is a far better protectant than paint alone.  

Beekeepers are a weird bunch.  Firm on traditional methods, cheaper than pig farmers."

educationalgifs,fdt7f7y,t1_fdqs646,1578712903.0,"If you were only dipping in paraffin to control AFB I would agree, just burn it.

But all wooden bee equipment needs to be protected from the elements.  Traditionally this was done with paint, which is crap and requires a lot of maintenance.  Then guys tried dipping in different sealants but it was so so.  Paraffin wax is becoming more prevalent, especially in Canada.  Low cost, low maintenance, long lasting.

I dip all of my new boxes once.  I re-dip my brood supers whenever they come home to be scraped/sorted/etc.  My honey supers are re-dipped as required, which can be 10-15 years."

educationalgifs,fdriqom,t1_fdriebt,1578685132.0,"Bees can suffer from American Foulbrood (AFB), European Foulbrood (EFB) and Nosema (which is a fungus that lives in their guts and causes dysentery).  By dipping your boxes, lids, bottoms in high temp paraffin it will micro-encapsulate the spores.  The bees won’t eat at paraffin normally so they can’t get infected by said spores.

When it comes to infected frames, all you can do is burn them and put knew ones jn"
educationalgifs,fdribzm,t1_fdri13n,1578684949.0,"Bee hives sit outside exposed to the sun, and if you use beeswax or low temp paraffin wax you’ll find the sun liquifies the wax even when the ambient temperature is cool.  

That isn’t ideal when you are trying to work the bees and everything slips out of your hands while trying to move stuff lol.

Also, if the wax is melting off it isn’t providing much if any protection to the equipment."
educationalgifs,fdri33r,t1_fdrgw0v,1578684805.0,"I feed the bees 6 gallons of liquid sucrose in the fall and that will last them all winter.  I used to winter them on honey but when it’s -20 to -40 for weeks on end it’s hard for them to soften the honey enough to consume.  

In the spring you have to make sure they are Queen right, healthy, have ample pollen and sugar stores, etc."

Also, when you’re trying to clean used boxes that are covered in wax and propolis (bee glue made from honey, tree sap and wax) said cleaners won’t do the job.  You need something that will melt the wax and propolis off as well as coat the boxes. 

As for an AMA, I had been asked to do one many years ago but that was long before I knew what Reddit was!"
educationalgifs,fdrh51m,t1_fdrfiqm,1578684503.0,"Lol, don’t think that.  Some beekeepers prefer painting or staining their boxes.  I love paraffin wax, the look of natural wood is preferable IMO and the boxes last forever.  Painting can chip which presents a hazard to the honey, and they require constant repainting.  I have yet to have a box rot since I went to paraffin!"

If you keep bees commercially (don’t confuse that with factory farming) it takes a lot of work to build the bees up from winter to prepare for the main honey or pollination crops.  Generally we work 280-340 hours a month during the season, and then we sleep all winter."
