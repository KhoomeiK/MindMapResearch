Child rapists aren't dangerous in prison, because they don't have access to children, and they're more vulnerable to attack because of their crimes and their usually effeminate personality needed to perpetrate the crimes in the first place.

MurderedByWords,fep3yzu,t1_feottb2,1579311607.0,"Well, okay, if we wanna call every historical figure a piece of shit without actually acknowledging the context of their time, let's go ahead.

""George Washington was a racist piece of shit because he owned slaves"", even though he basically grew up with them, inheriting his father's slaves when he was only 11. He felt, in what foreshadows the Civil War, that slavery could not work in a unified country. He didn't speak publicly about slavery, in support of or against it, and made plans to free his slaves upon his death, but was unable to directly, so set them to be freed upon Martha's death. She freed them before her death, but because of legal complications they remained enslaved. 

To read more: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Washington_and_slavery?wprov=sfla1

""Thomas Jefferson is a racist piece of shit because he had slaves""

Yes, and he had children with one of those slaves. He wrote that slavery was a blot on society. In the years during the Independence movement, he was profoundly ambiguous on his stance toward slavery, and then underwent a period of ""immense silence"" on the subject, like Washington. 

Hell, even Abraham Lincoln said in one of his debates with Douglas that negroes were inferior. To quote the transcript:

""I will say then that I am not, nor ever have been, in favor of bringing about in any way the social and political equality of the white and black races, [applause]—that I am not nor ever have been in favor of making voters or jurors of negroes, nor of qualifying them to hold office, nor to intermarry with white people; and I will say in addition to this that there is a physical difference between the white and black races which I believe will forever forbid the two races living together on terms of social and political equality. And inasmuch as they cannot so live, while they do remain together there must be the position of superior and inferior, and I as much as any other man am in favor of having the superior position assigned to the white race.""

He later changed his mind, and expressed that publicly; however, the emancipation proclamation was not necessarily a freeing of slaves in the spirit of equality as much as it was to enlist them into the Union army. 

Times have changed, and there is significant evidence that the majority of presidents and major figures, especially early ones, could be labeled as racist in today's context. 

But that's not what it was like 200+ years ago. There is also significant evidence that many, if not all of them also had doubts about the institution, but they - Washington and Jefferson specifically - chose to remain publicly silent as they presumably realized that it was unethical, yet did not feel that sacrificing their political power was worth it to try to change it when they would lose their influence to do other good things, and nothing about the issue of slavery would be addressed or improved. 

If anyone else would like more information, I'm likely going to do more extensive research on this topic in the future."

todayilearned,feodga0,t1_fenqhgk,1579298681.0,"That's debatable. A lot of people *would* call delivering mail bombs insane, but it depends whether you're operating on a popular, clinical, or legal definition of insanity. 

A lot of people accept the popular definition simply because he's portrayed as a lunatic who mailed bombs to people and isolated himself in the wilderness. (I mean, it's true he mailed bombs and isolated himself in the wilderness)

The clinical definition is:

""mental illness of such a severe nature that a person cannot distinguish fantasy from reality, cannot conduct her/his affairs due to psychosis, or is subject to uncontrollable impulsive behavior""

He was diagnosed as having paranoid schizophrenia, which does blur the oines between fantasy and reality. 

However, he successfully persuaded his lawyers against an insanity plea, and was subsequently found competent to stand trial.

Also, schizophrenia without schizophrenic actions is usually not seen as insanity, even if it's diagnosed. It's more a matter of the time period and interpretation of his behavior as to whether you want to call him insane. He used a myriad of forensic countermeasure in creating his bombs and successfully eluded the FBI for years.

Again, it really comes down to interpretation."

todayilearned,fenxlo3,t1_femvnj3,1579292318.0,"Well, if it doesn't make sense, then you don't know much outside of his manifesto. 

He was arguably one of the 5 or 10 smartest mathematicians in the country at one time, and one of the smartest people in general. 

I won't go through his entire story, as a lot of background is available on Wikipedia, but imagine that you were one of the smartest people in America, and that you thought that we were progressively coming closer and closer to, in essence, self-destruction by proxy via technology. Now, this was 30 years ago, so it was actually relatively easy to cover your tracks if you knew how to, and he knew how to, and he knew that if he systematically gained attention, by both increasing the frequency and intensity of his bombs, he could release a manifesto of his views that would have the ability to influence public policy, or the views of the general public, with pretty much the exact same reasoning as any other criminal manifesto writer. The only difference is most manifestos are written by uneducated or illogical people. 
Take Elliot Rodger's, for example. 

Among the conclusions he comes to are: he is deserving of women's attention; the only way he can get a woman to have sex with him or love him is if he wins the lottery; pushing girls he didn't know off of a deck at a house party while they are dancing is an appropriate use of force for things they've done in the past. 

Ted Kaczynski knew exactly what he was talking about, and if you've read his manifesto, you know that today, it seems significantly undermined by both the typos and unusual punctuation and capitalization, as well as the outdatedness of his examples. However, he wrote it on a typewriter, and in however many thousand words, you're bound to have some mistakes. And yeah, many of his points are very easy to agree with, because he wrote it well for his circumstances. 

In summary, he felt he had to make a point, knew that he could elude the FBI, knew how to maximize his media coverage, and get his ideology into the mainstream for people to read and think about. I bet you wouldn't do that today, but the main reason for that is because you're much more likely to be caught. 

His original intentions were to not kill anyone, but that changed after the attention the media gave him started dwindling, so, already invested in his operation, it seemed illogical to back down, and killing someone by mail bomb is much different than shooting someone directly, so he was unaffected by it. 

Just a fascinating story overall."

MurderedByWords,fep3yzu,t1_feottb2,1579311607.0,"Well, okay, if we wanna call every historical figure a piece of shit without actually acknowledging the context of their time, let's go ahead.

""George Washington was a racist piece of shit because he owned slaves"", even though he basically grew up with them, inheriting his father's slaves when he was only 11. He felt, in what foreshadows the Civil War, that slavery could not work in a unified country. He didn't speak publicly about slavery, in support of or against it, and made plans to free his slaves upon his death, but was unable to directly, so set them to be freed upon Martha's death. She freed them before her death, but because of legal complications they remained enslaved. 

To read more: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Washington_and_slavery?wprov=sfla1

""Thomas Jefferson is a racist piece of shit because he had slaves""

Yes, and he had children with one of those slaves. He wrote that slavery was a blot on society. In the years during the Independence movement, he was profoundly ambiguous on his stance toward slavery, and then underwent a period of ""immense silence"" on the subject, like Washington. 

Hell, even Abraham Lincoln said in one of his debates with Douglas that negroes were inferior. To quote the transcript:

""I will say then that I am not, nor ever have been, in favor of bringing about in any way the social and political equality of the white and black races, [applause]â€”that I am not nor ever have been in favor of making voters or jurors of negroes, nor of qualifying them to hold office, nor to intermarry with white people; and I will say in addition to this that there is a physical difference between the white and black races which I believe will forever forbid the two races living together on terms of social and political equality. And inasmuch as they cannot so live, while they do remain together there must be the position of superior and inferior, and I as much as any other man am in favor of having the superior position assigned to the white race.""

He later changed his mind, and expressed that publicly; however, the emancipation proclamation was not necessarily a freeing of slaves in the spirit of equality as much as it was to enlist them into the Union army. 

Times have changed, and there is significant evidence that the majority of presidents and major figures, especially early ones, could be labeled as racist in today's context. 

But that's not what it was like 200+ years ago. There is also significant evidence that many, if not all of them also had doubts about the institution, but they - Washington and Jefferson specifically - chose to remain publicly silent as they presumably realized that it was unethical, yet did not feel that sacrificing their political power was worth it to try to change it when they would lose their influence to do other good things, and nothing about the issue of slavery would be addressed or improved. 

If anyone else would like more information, I'm likely going to do more extensive research on this topic in the future."

todayilearned,feodga0,t1_fenqhgk,1579298681.0,"That's debatable. A lot of people *would* call delivering mail bombs insane, but it depends whether you're operating on a popular, clinical, or legal definition of insanity. 

A lot of people accept the popular definition simply because he's portrayed as a lunatic who mailed bombs to people and isolated himself in the wilderness. (I mean, it's true he mailed bombs and isolated himself in the wilderness)

The clinical definition is:

""mental illness of such a severe nature that a person cannot distinguish fantasy from reality, cannot conduct her/his affairs due to psychosis, or is subject to uncontrollable impulsive behavior""

He was diagnosed as having paranoid schizophrenia, which does blur the oines between fantasy and reality. 

However, he successfully persuaded his lawyers against an insanity plea, and was subsequently found competent to stand trial.

Also, schizophrenia without schizophrenic actions is usually not seen as insanity, even if it's diagnosed. It's more a matter of the time period and interpretation of his behavior as to whether you want to call him insane. He used a myriad of forensic countermeasure in creating his bombs and successfully eluded the FBI for years.

Again, it really comes down to interpretation."

He was arguably one of the 5 or 10 smartest mathematicians in the country at one time, and one of the smartest people in general. 

I won't go through his entire story, as a lot of background is available on Wikipedia, but imagine that you were one of the smartest people in America, and that you thought that we were progressively coming closer and closer to, in essence, self-destruction by proxy via technology. Now, this was 30 years ago, so it was actually relatively easy to cover your tracks if you knew how to, and he knew how to, and he knew that if he systematically gained attention, by both increasing the frequency and intensity of his bombs, he could release a manifesto of his views that would have the ability to influence public policy, or the views of the general public, with pretty much the exact same reasoning as any other criminal manifesto writer. The only difference is most manifestos are written by uneducated or illogical people. 
Take Elliot Rodger's, for example. 

Among the conclusions he comes to are: he is deserving of women's attention; the only way he can get a woman to have sex with him or love him is if he wins the lottery; pushing girls he didn't know off of a deck at a house party while they are dancing is an appropriate use of force for things they've done in the past. 

Ted Kaczynski knew exactly what he was talking about, and if you've read his manifesto, you know that today, it seems significantly undermined by both the typos and unusual punctuation and capitalization, as well as the outdatedness of his examples. However, he wrote it on a typewriter, and in however many thousand words, you're bound to have some mistakes. And yeah, many of his points are very easy to agree with, because he wrote it well for his circumstances. 

In summary, he felt he had to make a point, knew that he could elude the FBI, knew how to maximize his media coverage, and get his ideology into the mainstream for people to read and think about. I bet you wouldn't do that today, but the main reason for that is because you're much more likely to be caught. 

His original intentions were to not kill anyone, but that changed after the attention the media gave him started dwindling, so, already invested in his operation, it seemed illogical to back down, and killing someone by mail bomb is much different than shooting someone directly, so he was unaffected by it. 

Just a fascinating story overall."

From the story:

> Suicide byÂ crocodileÂ of a woman inÂ Thailand occurred in the country's capital last Friday, and there is disturbing footage of the incident, said local police. According to authorities, the recent suicide by crocodile footage shows a 65-year-old woman inÂ ThailandÂ who decided to jump to her death into a crocodile pit and end her life in one of the most terrible and public ways.

> According to the BBC,Â local police said the incident of the suicide by crocodile happened at a reptile farm inÂ Bangkok,Â Thailand. The name of the elderly woman is Wanpen Inyai, and unfortunately, there were witnesses who watched as she jumped into the crocodile pit at theÂ Samut Prakarn Crocodile Farm and Zoo on Friday.

> According to theÂ Bangkok Post, the CCTVÂ footageÂ showed the elderly woman even leaving her shoes on a walkway before jumping into the crocodile pit at theÂ zoo.
Thai police were able to confirm the Inyai's death of suicide by crocodile on Tuesday afternoon.

> According to police, when they arrived at the scene of the suicide by crocodile incident, they foundÂ zooÂ keepers and staff trying their best to keep the crocodiles from eating Inyai alive, but they were not successful.

> The pond was reported to be up to 3m deep and it contained hundreds of adult crocodiles, according to the BBC. Eventually, the woman was torn apart despite the police and staff's efforts of saving her by using long sticks.

> According to police, Inyai's family members had noticed her depressed before the suicide by crocodile incident. However, it was unexpected that she would be walking into the reptile farm and jump to her death into the crocodile pit.

Yeah, I'd usually say that's unexpected

> Inyai's sister, Sunan Tharmna, said Inyai had not been speaking to anyone days prior to her suicide by crocodile on Friday.
Her family apparently also tried filing a missing persons report after she disappeared, but they were told to wait 24 hours byÂ Rom Klao policeÂ since it was required by law, reports the Atlanta-Journal Constitution.

> The Friday suicide by crocodile incident isn't the first of its kind. In 2002, a woman committed the same type of suicide at the same farm. According toÂ The Bangkok Times, another suicide also took place a decade before that.

They put additional safety features in place shortly after."
