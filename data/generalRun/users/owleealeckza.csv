television,ffqsyeo,t1_ffqqd7u,1580142924.0,"I actually have because I've been struggling with health issues for over a decade. In January 2015, a neurologist (who never did any tests & spoke to me for less than 5 minutes) told me all of my problems were in my head & I had to find an entirely different healthcare system to get a neurologist to actually do testing on me. I had to wait until September 2015 to see the other one, but never once did I think ""oh I should believe some random shit that's never been truly studied & proven"" I'm not willing to risk falling into worse health by entertaining bs, especially when I wasn't even sure what was the problem.

I had to watch my mom struggle with boxes of pills back when doctors were far too willing to write prescriptions for anything at all, not even that pushed me to think ""hm maybe I should believe all this pseudoscience that doesn't work for other people"" & I was even further turned off by it when my mom's friends tried to get her to use magnets & other shit to fix her health problems. I became very against pseudoscience after dealing with my mom's health when I was 16. Opioids made her physically worse, then pseudoscience made her mentally worse.

If you are not old & experiencing dementia, but you are a an adult & only know a lot about 1 subject yet can be easily fooled, I don't think you're very smart, you are just very informed about 1 subject.
