kpophelp,fen2tjh,t1_fen1zii,1579275723.0,"No, Sunhwa (I believe it was) explicitly posted on her personal page of Twitter (I believe) to state how she disliked one member in particular, saying they didn't work well together. Hyosung (their leader) tried to do damage control, but Sunhwa doubled up by saying very clearly that she meant what she said. She was the first to leave TS and Secret never rekindled. The other members left too, but they celebrated their anniversary with just the 3 of them.

Yeah, it's really sad since Youngji has no chance to do anything else in the kpop world currently... At least she has other opportunities

Edit: I googled it. Hana made comments on a program about how Sunhwa was dissatisfied with the world when drunk, and Sunhwa responded to these statements via Twitter in a really harsh way, basically saying Hana was bullshitting. As if Hana had broken her trust. Hyosung tried to tell everyone they misunderstood Sunhwa's tweet but Sunhwa doubled down after that"

IncelTears,femo1e2,t3_epy660,1579264277.0,"In my year/major there's about 450 people. Some people will always find their way to stick out by having to mention things all the time, or wear their hobbies on their sleeves (literally, looking at you hentai bag kid).

In my tutorials there's 40 people max. We are literally supposed to interact for the tutorials to work. Either by doing experiments, comparing answers or group assignments. How on earth do you not interact with any of your classmates for 3/4 years? People with personalities this thick stick out. Even now I can visually remember the dude who tried to convince people IQ was a valid method for deciding who should get a job or not."
kpophelp,femkpkq,t3_epqnqu,1579260410.0,"For me it's 100% EXID and Highlight.

If it wasn't for Junghwa and LE's friendship the group wouldn't have made it past debut. If it wasn't for Hani asking Hyerin and Solji to join the group EXID literally wouldn't exist. People don't understand how deeply in shit they were when they broke through after Up&Down's promotions had already ended. Not many groups can stick together after the shit they went through, and I haven't heard of any other group who had a member go on hiatus for 2 years and still be just as close when that member comes back.

As for Highlight, yes as Beast they weren't as close to Hyunseung, but the 5 of them literally went out to make their own company. Their moms are closer with eachother than to their sons (according to Yoseob). 

TVXQ! currently as well. Changmin took his service earlier to be there at the same time as Yunho, they scheduled their breaks together, and are literally always there to support eachother even though they lost 3 members. 

Rainbow has been mentioned a lot and I just want to re-mention them for obvious reasons. 

For groups that don't go along, have you ever heard about the tragedy of Secret?
Although 3 of the members may still meet up, the falling out with the 4th member was a little too public for comfort (unlike 4Minute or SNSD OT9 where the members never explicitly mentioned their dislike for the other member that got excluded) when she literally posted about it online.

TRNCG and groups similar to this one as well, where members are clearly in distress and some can't take it anymore, but once they go public and/or file a lawsuit the other members go against them and paint them out to be the selfish black sheep. 

You also have groups like Kara where the other members just kind of never acknowledge eachother's existence again (until something bad happens...)"
