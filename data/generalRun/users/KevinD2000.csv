unpopularopinion,ffjmbei,t1_ff56m83,1580001545.0,"Wrong. This only applies to small game devs and smaller music producers. 

Doesn't apply to movies or AAA games when 99% of the people involved get paid regardless on how it performs."
unpopularopinion,ffjlyxd,t3_erpjpt,1580001307.0," NO, I disagree on the music part. The only time it IS a crime with a victim is when it's indie games with a small team of devs. 

Movies, AAA games both already got their pays. Developers get paid no matter if the game sells millions of copies or sells 10. 

Same with movies, all the directors and actors get paid if the movie becomes a number 1 seller or bombs. 

Me pirating the movie takes away from the multi billionare companies from making money."

If the criminal is going to die, he is going to die. I'd rather not add a dog to that list."

Much of the country dislikes Biden and Warren and the left knows that, but they're still going to rig it to ensure one of them wins. So its either Creepy Uncle Joe or Elisssssabeth Warren. If they got smart and nominated Bernie Trump would lose."

Much of the far left has been calling for impeachment since 2016, that this trial isn't about a call or anything but the fact that Trump is Trump and is also a Republican, that they couldnt handle losing."
