Also, for the ink I chose Diamine Emerald Green, because FUCK it's a gorgeous color. I'll definitely end up getting Oxblood once I have the funds for more frivolous spending lol. I also plan on getting Monboddo's Hat... and Noodler's Habanero and Waterman Serenity Blue.

If it isn't noticeable, I fall hard into hobbies. I don't want my bank account to explode though."

Learnmusic,ffk6umr,t3_eu2caw,1580017790.0,"Your breath needs work. Try to practice some breathing exercises, and look up where and when to breath from some classical vocalists on YouTube.

Occasionally your enunciation falters a bit. It's better than a lot of people, but  still, make sure your consonants are always crisp.

Also, I can tell the song is a little bit below your range since there are times when you try to hit low notes and you end up sliding from one note to the other instead of hitting the note directly. Try a song that has a slightly higher range, and make sure that when you're hitting a note you're not sliding unless that's a vocal effect you're specifically going for.

Otherwise, keep up the good work. Every once in a while you're a little off from the note you're trying to hit, but you're clearly better at hitting the notes you're going for than most people are, and with practice and patience you'll be able to break those habits. Have fun with your music."

konmari,fcvs392,t3_ej3gl0,1578008838.0,"The KonMari method has definitely had a profound impact on how I approach all of my surroundings, and consequently, my life. The difference between one's thoughts and surroundings is important, however. What you've already mentioned is great for you, but make sure not to take it too far.

For example, thinking about the fact that I want to get a job absolutely does not bring me joy, but it's something that I want for myself, and I'm not going to push that aside. My approach to my thoughts is to understand my reaction to them and determine whether or not I'd benefit from adjusting it. If something stresses me out and I determine that it's unnecessary, I get rid of it. But, if something stresses me out and it is something that I choose to approach, I go at it, and I determine how to adjust my perspective appropriately in the process.

Yeah, I want a job, and it stresses me out because I'll be losing free time, and my family has a good financial foundation, so I'm not desperate - however, I prioritize the fact that I'd rather build discipline rather than sit on my ass for the rest of my life, and I know that not being able to support myself on my own won't sit well with me for much longer. It may not bring me joy now, but it will in the future.

I'm not sure if I'm rambling for the sake of it or if this is something that will benefit you or anyone else who happens to read it, but you did ask for our opinion, so this is mine. I'm glad you've gotten such benefit from the KonMari method. I'm of the party who thinks that everyone would benefit from organizing their life a little bit."
