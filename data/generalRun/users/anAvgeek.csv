AskReddit,feltacf,t3_epsfg6,1579230394.0,Yesterday. I feel like school is pileling up and my parents are up my ass about it and they think that by getting mad at me it’s motivating me but it’s destroying my drive to do shit but look reddit and sit on my ass. I just can not pay attention I’m school. I try to and I want to but I just can not. I will find anything to do but my work and I feel fucking stupid because I have such low grades and everyone else is doing good. And it’s been a year and 2 months since my grandmother passed away and I still can’t get over her death. Mostly because my parents wouldn’t let me see her in the hospital and I just wanted to say goodbye or that I loved her and I couldn’t. I just wanted to see her once before she left us forever and I feel like I could’ve done more to convince them to let me see her and I hate them for that.

AskReddit,fefnbtb,t3_cgje7v,1579060075.0,So thereâ€™s this kid in my math class who freaks out over everything and he went to go to the bathroom so I took his spring out of his pen so it wouldnâ€™t work and he came back and was getting visibly frustrated and silently but angrily got up to throw it away. About a minute after that I got up to throw something away and said â€œ hey look a perfectly good penâ€ put the spring back in and used it. He told me it was his once I sat down so as I was walking back over to give it to him I took it back out.(he was pissed) TL;DR I took the spring out of a pen.
