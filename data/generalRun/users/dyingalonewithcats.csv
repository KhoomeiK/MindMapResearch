surgery,ffg170q,t1_ffg00w3,1579896235.0,"Well, vendor backpacks and other non-essential items may harbor bacteria. But, as another poster mentioned, there are other things that come into the OR that *definitely* come into contact with the outside world. Phones, pagers, a surgeon’s eyeglasses, etc.

The three unsterile parts of the human body are the respiratory, GI, and GU tracts. If someone in the room passes flatus during surgery, is the room contaminated? If the patient drools a little around their ET tube, is sterility sacrificed? If a female patient has her period during surgery (or vaginal discharge in general) and it drips on the OR table, is the room no longer clean?

You‘re not acknowledging that the biggest risk of SSI comes from bacteria on a patient’s own skin (NOT their clothes). So yeah, maybe an extra barrier (like underwear) could help. There’s your example."
surgery,fffxnmf,t1_fffxb7p,1579894051.0,"With that logic, you could claim that a surgeon eating a bowl of spaghetti in the OR prior to scrubbing in and operating is safer for patients, because there’s no documentation to refute it.

“Patients entering the surgical suite should wear clean gowns, be covered with clean linens, and have their hair covered.”

Residency,ff42uwm,t1_ff3zcbz,1579554339.0,"I agree with this. Residency is unfortunately a 24/7 gig, in that if someone texts you a question, it’s professional to respond to them within a few hours (or the next day if it’s late at night), unless you’re on vacation in the middle of nowhere with no cell service. Obviously, you should be able to enjoy yourself and not feel 100% tied to work, but if this was an attending texting you, would you ignore them and be upset that they bothered your Netflix binge? No, you wouldn’t.

The same can be said about texting between residents, whether they’re chiefs or seniors. It’s about creating a culture of collegiality and professionalism. If you’re scolded for texting someone a question, you’re less likely to reach out to that person for anything in the future, be it dumb didactics questions or issues regarding patients.

Look, OP, I’ve been there. Under scrutiny where I was afraid to ask a question or get an answer wrong because I thought I was on the chopping block. I was actually told by two chiefs and a faculty member that I should never ask for help because all it did was make me look weak (screw patient care, amirite?). And, no surprises, it made me perform worse. There’s some pretty good literature to support that, too. But you need to be in a place where you’re allowed to reach out to your colleagues, whether it involves working on communication skills or learning who’s got your back. Otherwise you’ll drive yourself mad questioning others’ perception of everything you do."
Residency,feozyw7,t1_feood9q,1579309071.0,"Definitely. Here's the abstract:

## BACKGROUND:

There are notable disparities in the training, recruitment, promotion, and evaluation of men and women in surgery. The qualitative assessment of surgical residents may be implicitly gender biased.

## METHODS:

We used inductive analysis to identify themes in written evaluations of residents. We also performed a content analysis of words fitting previously defined communal, grindstone, ability, and standout categories.

## RESULTS:

Differences in themes that emerged from evaluations of male and female residents were notable regarding overall performance, references to the future, professional competency, job domains, disposition and humanism, and overall tone of evaluations. Comments about men were more positive than those about women, and evaluations of men included more standout words.

## CONCLUSIONS:

The more positive evaluations of men may handicap women if they are seen as less likely to perform well based on these evaluations. These differences suggest that implicit bias may play a role in the qualitative evaluation of surgical residents.

&#x200B;

Obviously it was a qualitative study, but it looks they had good saturation. Just interesting to see this actually published, and not just whispered between residents."
medicalschool,feokf0x,t1_feojrka,1579301441.0,"Maybe I read your comment wrong - do you mean why are they being hired as independent providers within the private practice? Or why are they being hired by private practice physicians to do the intern-level work?

I was responding to the latter situation - private practice docs would like to lessen their load and avoid the scut of seeing routine postop checks, removing sutures, doing wound care, weeding out consults, etc when they can train a midlevel to do so.

If you meant the former, hell if I know. Decreased costs? Need? Lower acuity environment? It’s a good question."
medicalschool,feoj3p4,t1_fennuaf,1579300831.0,"Midlevels, in my mind (no offense intended to ANYONE who is a midlevel), have taken upon a job of being a perpetual intern. Interns are physicians, but no one expects them to run a service. They always have to go to the higher-ups to get approval for things other than simple decisions (ordering medications at night, seeing consults, pulling lines/drains, doing basic procedures). But coming up with a treatment plan? The intern might know what‘s typically done, but it’s the attending’s job to truly make the call.

To allow a midlevel to essentially obtain attending status by becoming independent goes contrary to the intended role and scope of midlevels.

Once again, no offense to NPs, PAs, even interns. That’s just my understanding of intended roles. To be able to run the show, you need to get a higher degree."

medicalschool,fengnpx,t1_fenfk5d,1579284281.0,">I am curious what the opinions are in this subreddit regarding how previous employment plays into your perception of clinical hours as it relates to competency. According to a study called Exploring the Factors that Influence Nurse Practitioner Role Transition with a n of 352, average years of RN experience before role transition was 13.75.

There is a very real difference between scope of nursing and scope of medicine. For instance, decisions in medicine are often made based on clinical experience, whereas nursing is a lot of algorithms that may or may not make sense to the person following them as is required by their hospital."
