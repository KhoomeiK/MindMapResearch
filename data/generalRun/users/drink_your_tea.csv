veganrecipes,ff9gvnn,t1_ff9815k,1579712747.0,"> **Ingredients** 

Base: 

* 1 1/2 cups pitted dates 

* 1/2 cup rolled oats 

* 1/4 cup cocoa powder 

* 1/4 tsp salt 

* 1/2 tsp vanilla extract 

* 1/4 cup raw pumpkin seeds or tiger nut flour; can also use almond meal 

* 1/4 cup unsweetened shredded coconut 

Middle: 

* 3/4 cup coconut butter - butter, not oil 

* 3/4 cup natural icing sugar; see note 

* 3 tbsp non-dairy ‘egg nog’ or canned coconut milk 

* 1/2 tsp vanilla extract 

* 1/4 tsp turmeric powder 

* 1/8 tsp sea salt 

Topping: 

* 1 cup chunked non-dairy chocolate bar or chocolate chips 

* 2 1/2 tbsp regular coconut milk canned, regular, not lite 

-----------------------------

**Instructions** 

1. Prepare the Base: In a food processor, add the dates and rolled oats and pulse several times until coming together and slightly crumbly. Then add the Cocoa powder, salt, and vanilla, and processed through until the mixture starts to become sticky. Finally, add the almond meal or tiger not flour and coconut, and process through until the mixture is very sticky and will hold together when pressed with your fingers. Remove mixture from processor and press into a brownie pan (8” x 8”) lined with parchment paper. Place in the refrigerator. 

1. Prepare the Middle Layer: For this layer I use my mini-processor, since my processor is 16-cup. If you have a smaller processor that you used for the first layer, go ahead and clean it out to use again for this middle layer. Otherwise, use a mini-processor. Add all ingredients to the processor and pulse/process through until just combined. Try not to overblend as the mixture will heat and become oily. Once combined and smooth, transfer to your brownie pan, spreading evenly over the first layer. Place back in refrigerator. 

1. Top Layer: if making the chocolate bar/chips topping, prepare a hot water bath. To do so, use a small sauce pan and fill with hot water. place a heatproof one that will fully cover the top of the saucepan and prevent steam from entering the bull. Add the chocolate chips and the coconut milk and set over a low heat. Stir through as the mixture melts together once fully melted together and smooth remove from heat. Pour the chocolate topping over top of your bars, and refrigerate until set. 

1. To serve, simply cut into 16-20 squares/bars and enjoy. Extra bars can be frozen, if they last that long

Baking,ff4c1tw,t3_erjox1,1579560084.0,these are so cute and playful! great job!
birdpics,ff38xmu,t1_ff37r39,1579536478.0,"ooh, stunning! i have a real soft spot for cardinals - i worked on a research project with them one year, and it made me a lot more aware of things like beak color and age and the like. they're old favorites of mine and i really enjoy seeing them done such justice, especially the young little guys! (adult males are always photographed and are always handsome, so it's so nice to see the less colorful individuals also in the spotlight.) such a treat to see the brilliant feathers coming through the less conspicuous 'baby' feathers. judging by the amount of red on this guy's breast, he will definitely turn out to be handsome male!

edit: wait, did you take these pictures recently? i'm guessing if that's the case that you live pretty far south - it is crazy to me that this bird recently left the nest (within the last 2-4 weeks as a casual guess)! that means that your cardinals would be breeding year round, which blows my mind. that definitely never used to be the case!"
birdpics,ff3451r,t1_ff2zstt,1579533205.0,"it's a juvenile. the black beak is diagnostic for a young bird - [here's a picture](https://image.shutterstock.com/image-photo/northern-cardinal-family-male-female-260nw-461311201.jpg) showing a young bird, with black beak, still being attended by its parents, who both have red beaks. [the beak will fade to red](http://danbusby.ca/gallery/var/albums/Landbirds/20111023_NOCA_1009.jpg?m=1425851031).

 it's hard to tell sex at this point, but i'm leaning towards it being a male. its head still is mostly juvenile plumage, but there is some red visible around the eye, and the amount of red coming into its flanks points to the possibility that it will be a male. females will have [red wings](https://media.gettyimages.com/photos/female-cardinal-perching-picture-id151915113) but still have tan or buffy flanks. [dull females](https://nhpbs.org/wild/images/northerncardinalusfwrobertburton.jpg) won't have any red outside of their wing, tail, crest, and underwing coverts (not visible when perched). [really bright females](https://www.hbw.com/sites/default/files/styles/ibc_2k/public/ibc/p/MATTS_BIRDS_3_049.JPG?itok=zRR9h0w5) can have red even in their breasts and their faces, but no hatch-year bird will ever develop this much color! the amount of red the feathers show is in part driven by diet (carotenoids) and it takes time to build up. because of all of that, the red on the flank and in the face makes me think this is a young male, not a young female. and even the most gorgeous male can still have [surprisingly muted colors](https://i.redd.it/b3x1uxyqfy721.jpg) on his back, so the 'dullness' seen here is not necessarily indicative that this bird is a female!"
birdpics,ff2wkox,t3_ercgr4,1579526859.0,"yes, that's a juvenile cardinal! it will finish molting out its head feathers and its beak will gradually fade to red. lovely shot!"
whatsthisbird,ff2n3ft,t3_er4n8x,1579514238.0,"for the western palearctic, [this one](https://www.birdid.no/bird/quiz/) is my favourite. you don't have to have a login to use it; only certain categories (like sudden death) require one."
