AskReddit,feuv7qm,t3_eqies2,1579390305.0,"I was with a friend at a convenience store. I go in and grab something, there’s an old lady with a walker, so I hold the door open for her. By the time I walk three seconds to my car, she was gone. 

My friend didn’t see her get into a car either, it would’ve taken longer than that due to how slowly she walked and she wouldn’t have been able to get far in those couple seconds nor would she have had time to put the walker into a car and drive away.

This happened two and a half years ago and still mystifies us."

If they attend the wrong one, they would be being fed a false gospel and led into believing that sin is not sin.

Therefore, I would not mind a distinction between all of them, to make it obvious where they stand.

The fact that the culture and world has infiltrated into the church so deeply that many churches are calling sin not sin is sad, but it’s been going on for a long time and is not at all surprising.

The true church is made out of all the true believers in Christ, not the buildings or denominations."

There’s a very angry and mean goose at a nearby lake that will launch itself at unsuspecting individuals and attack with all of its might. That critter has left black bruises through my blue jeans in the past.

I remember once when I was fishing with an elderly lady named Alma. That old, cruel, mean goose followed us up to the pier. It started biting, not just pecking, my leg. I tried to push it away, it wouldn’t go. It tried to launch itself at Alma. I got between her and the goose.

Yep. That didn’t make it happy. The only thing that saved us was a gentleman coming up to the dock and bouncing his basketball. Apparently, it’s afraid of vibration.

I’ve tried to push it off of the dock before and have succeeded, only for it to swim back to the entrance and come back to assault us.

I wouldn’t wish injury on any animal, but now that this evil goose has lost an eye, he’s much less dangerous as he can’t see one side, so he’s easier to sneak past.

I have a photo of this demon goose from Hell if someone wants me to find and post it."

worldnews,fbz5tdx,t1_fbz4982,1577235976.0,"The Greek translation of these Leviticus passages condemns a man (arseno) lying with (koitai) another man (arseno); these words (excuse the pun) lie side-by-side in these passages in Leviticus. Paul joins these two words together into a neologism, a new word (as we do in saying database or software), and thus he condemns in 1 Corinthians and 1 Timothy  what was condemned in Leviticus.

The most credible translation of what Paul is condemning in 1Corinthians6:9 is a person doing exactly what Leviticus condemns: engaging in homosexual sex (a man being a “man-lier”). Far from dismissing the relevance of Leviticus, Paul is implicitly invoking its enduring validity for our understanding of sexual sin, and drawing on it as the foundation of his teaching on homosexual conduct. He is saying, “Remember what it said not to do in Leviticus 18:22 and  20:13? Don’t do that!”"
worldnews,fbz5l5g,t1_fbz4982,1577235771.0,"Arsenokoitai is a compound word: arseno is the word for “a male,” and koitai is the word for “mat” or “bed.” Put the two halves together, and the word means “a male bed”—that is, a person who makes use of a “male-only bed” or a “bed for males.” And, truthfully, that’s all the information we need to understand the intent of 1 Corinthians 6:9.

The word meaning “bed” carries a sexual connotation in this context—the Greek koitai is the source of our English word coitus (“sexual intercourse”). The conclusion is that the word arsenokoitai is referring to homosexuals—men who are in bed with other men, engaging in same-gender sexual activity."
