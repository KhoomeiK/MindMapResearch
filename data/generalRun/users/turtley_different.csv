However, Kenobi points to 70% isopropyl having higher efficacy because water facilitates alcohol penetration deeper into the cells. Whereas 90% isopropyl does damage to outer walls but fails to penetrate and thus can leave robust organisms alive.

If true, we don't have a convincing reason to use 90% alcohol in any application.  I assume the answer is that pure alcohol EVENTUALLY kills (almost) anything and 70% alcohol is completely resisted by some subset of critters.  But I would be interested in seeing expert discussion."

1) old guy is swinging WAY too hard for sparring

2) old guy keeps going after the other guy has given up. Not okay

3) younger guy has no form.  15 secs into the video where he takes the knockdown hit? He steps in with both hands down, leading with his right elbow pointed forwards and right-glove pointing backwards as he goes for a left-hand hit.   Awful, awful stuff.

Basically, everything here is concerning."
NoStupidQuestions,feunj60,t3_eqgp33,1579388262.0,"Well, I wouldn't be so sure about the higher education part...  US undergrads are less expert in specialised fields, although their generalist education is better.

American undergrad courses are good, certainly, but it still takes 6-8 years to get a US PhD where a European PhD takes 4.  Some of that is the different teaching requirements in the PhD, but a lot of that is US undergrad students having a lower education level than their EU counterparts.  In part, this comes from American students not specialising until partway through university (if ever) where Europeans can be focused on a single track from age 16.

&#x200B;

However, comparing the undergraduate experiences of Cambridge (UK) with Yale, Harvard, and UPenn, I can say that Cambridge science courses are much MUCH harder than the Ivy League.  Although perhaps that is an edge case more telling of Cambridge natural sciences being a living hell than it is a meaningful general university comparison."

explainlikeimfive,fegntqw,t1_fegd3l8,1579098261.0,"Yes.  

The key strategic concept here is basically ""return on capital"" or ""how much money does Netflix generate per dollar they spend"".

If Netflix can get loans at 10% interest rate, and Netflix thinks they can generate more than $1.10 in value (per year) for each dollar they spend on content, then it makes financial sense for Netflix to continually get more loans to finance expansion.

In the short term, that looks like keeping up with debt payments and invoices as you say.

(PS. The end state to this kind of expansion is when a company has so much debt that any kind of reduction in the company's growth rate will lead to them failing to meet repayments and getting into to trouble with creditors.  Because of that higher risk, creditors increase the interest on new loans. At the same time Netflix is predicting lower growth rates for itself as the company matures and eventually Netflix naturally stops requesting new loans)"
aww,fedx6q1,t1_fedu6st,1579021783.0,"*""inarguably slightly uncomfortable"", not ""arguably"". But yes, perhaps.

I'm not angry watching the video or anything; I don't think the dog is in a terrible place, but it is some degree of nervous and uncomfortable (which you can call distressed or not according to your personal benchmarks).

That said, some dogs will suddenly bite when showing this behaviour (if trapped), so estimating mental condition of the pup is hard."

explainlikeimfive,fdkpeox,t1_fdkjtk8,1578508393.0,"If body heat was easily available as a side-effect of doing stuff, there wouldn't be any cold-blooded animals.

Mammals are an evolutionary trade-off where we choose to have hot bodies where all the cellular chemistry gets to happen at a fixed temp (and faster because of the high temps), making us capable of sustained activity at a higher rate than lizards and amphibians, in exchange for spending energy on keeping a constant, hot body temp.

By contrast, lizards and amphibians get to save energy but are relatively slow and have a spectacularly complex set of varying enzymes to make cellular chemistry work at different temps."
askscience,fdfxcz1,t1_fdftj4t,1578372810.0,"The first paper suggests that given how awful people are at taking daily TB pills for 9 months, it is better to give them different IV drugs in a clinical setting for 3 months so the patients at least get a valid course of treatment.

Seems more like a research paper that agrees that not taking drugs correctly for >6 months was a problem and is exploring ways to work around the high non-compliance risk."
askscience,fdfn6sw,t1_fdfkcgs,1578365577.0,"Doctor's recommendation is an important caveat. Also I think the person you are replying to is oversimplifying the known evidence, and we absolutely have NOT proven that ""shorter is better"". We have instead started questioning the value of long treatment times that err on the side of keeping you on antibiotics after the infection is no longer dangerous.

We sure as fuck know that failure to reach killing concentration of antibiotics promotes certain resistance pathways.

I would fear that ""when you feel better"" is not a sufficient indicator of when the antibiotic is no longer needed. It is, for example, a famously terrible way to evaluate TB progress, and would get you dead if you were on HIV medication."
IAmA,fddnwso,t1_fdcz3qn,1578319068.0,"In case it helps, as the OP states, the overwhelming majority of medical professionals are hardworking, dedicated and compassionate.

Specifically, while unanticipated deaths at 3am are a somewhat rare (compared to other causes of death) there are still a LOT of them, so that any given patient dying that way is overwhelmingly likely to be natural causes.

I imagine it's a hard suspicion to live with, so I just want you to know that even when hitting these flags it is almost guaranteed to have been natural causes."
