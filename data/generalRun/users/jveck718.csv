trashy,ffaybqd,t3_eses02,1579747319.0,"We live 10 mins outside of the “nests” for “Birds” when they were in Raleigh. Hubby and I wanted to test them out so we were downtown and checked a couple out. They were fun so we we decided to take those two home plus another since we have 3 kids.  Fully planning on returning them in a few hours. Well, there wasn’t a third one immediately available where we were. So we scoured downtown and saw some here and there. Found one that wasn’t surrounded by people (cus we were gonna heist it). Pulled the minivan up to a lone bird on the sidewalk. I didn’t bother checking the screen cuz I didn’t know anything about anything. Threw it in the back of the Town & Country and got the fuck out of there. On the way home, one of them was chirping. Figured they were getting far from their home and were sad. Laughed the whole way “OMG it knows it’s being kidnapped!” “He’s trying to call his momma!” Until we tried to ride it and it said it was already in use/locked by another user. (Didn’t try to hack it to unlock it. Just thought “Poor guy probably stopped to take a dump and us dumbasses are like, ‘there’s the last one! We’re all good!’” And threw it in the back.) Then after an hour or so of riding only the two birds that were useful, we went inside the house. My daughter comes downstairs and said two guys in a black car stole the scooters! Fuck!!! After googling, I realized these people  (hopefully they were the people) get paid to track down scooters and charge them for the night and “release” them back to their nests. All’s good and well except we had left the “previously detained” scooter in the van and they didn’t grab that one. So we ended up having to drive that lone guy back to a random nest. Moral of the story: they’re fun and try them before they get thrown in the river!"
