horrorlit,ffyu5xt,t3_evy1ue,1580355216.0,"Speculative Fiction is a much broader category than that. It pretty much encompasses all of fantasy and science fiction. Plus any supernatural horror. So, for example, every episode of Black Mirror would be speculative fiction.

But I do get what you're saying. They're not from the past two years but some of Paolo Bacigalupi's work might interest you. Namely The Windup Girl and The Water Knife. They both deal with climate change and futuristic technology (Cli-fi some call it.)"
horrorlit,ffyp57f,t1_ffykaq4,1580351742.0,"We need a bot that just auto recommends McDowell in every thread. It's going to happen anyway. But yes, I second this recommendation. His writing kinda feels like King too, I think."

horrorlit,ffo5lmz,t1_ffntim7,1580074417.0,"You're right. At the very end Danforth saw something that basically broke him. They both already saw a shoggoth, so it wouldn't make sense for that to drive him mad.

 But Lovecraft's whole schtick is stuff that's beyond our comprehension. It's some kind of entity that exists outside of time and manifests itself in a way that we can't properly perceive because we simply have no context  to understand this kind of thing.

But if you want an actual answer, I think the most common theory is that it was Yog-Sothoth."

The second book is really one of my all-time favorites from King. It's a pretty huge departure from the first book. You'd really be doing yourself a disservice if you didn't at least try it."
books,ffgsadu,t1_ffg91ke,1579913771.0,I don't think that's fair to say. The first book is very different from the rest of the series. I think it's fairly common for people to not really dig the first book but love the rest of the series.

It's not really the focus of the story, but one of the families has a history of its members seemingly dying, only to later wake up in their graves.

Also, it's just a fantastic book, which is why it gets recommended so much."
horrorlit,ff1qqsq,t1_fewfmlr,1579484098.0,"Tor released a free audio collection back around October called Come Join Us By the Fire.

horrorlit,feltm5s,t3_epu2j0,1579230626.0,"Yeah, I really liked the end. Big Jim's fate could have been a bit more satisfying, but I really dug the concept of where the dome came from as a whole. And while the rest of the cast is pretty one-dimensional, Junior is one of King's best characters.

A lot of my King opinions are at odds with the rest of the fandom. I also love the ending of The Stand and feel that, while it isn't terrible, the ending of 11/23/63 is the ending of basically every time travel story ever. 

Also, I hated the end of Pet Semetary. I wanted to throw my book across the room."
movies,fejjshd,t1_fejbovz,1579177191.0,"No shit. People were upset when Tropic Thunder was coming out back then. But it came and people saw it was satirical and not actually hateful so now it's not thought of as a big deal. But, of course, there are a bunch of people that missed the point and still think of it as some edgy movie that they ""got away with"", nevermind the fact that South Park was doing shit that would make Tropic Thunder look tame ten years before it came out and ten years after."
