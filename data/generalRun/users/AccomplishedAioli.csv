AskAnAmerican,felebom,t1_felawew,1579220169.0,"definitely. i‚Äôm full korean but i look kinda mixed/chinese/japanese - when i visited seoul all the makeup sellers kept trying to sell me stuff in chinese or japanese and when i replied that i was korean there definitely were some looks haha.


it was much less prevalent in the heavy tourist footfall areas like myeongdong but i get a lot of double takes in busan when i speak in korean (in the south)"
AskAnAmerican,feldp6r,t1_fel9u74,1579219752.0,"yeah definitely could see it happening - but as you say in your edited post it definitely is much worse for darker skinned people.

i‚Äôve personally never seen discrimination against white people - koreans are weird in their view of white people, it‚Äôs almost like a weird fascination in how some people view them as superior or an ideal to strive to."
OopsDidntMeanTo,fekxulc,t1_fekcmj8,1579209848.0,it‚Äôs so fucking ugly i hate that 69 print gucci uses with that oatmeal vomit colour on their clothes too
AskAnAmerican,fekubfi,t1_feksm6b,1579207758.0,"it‚Äôs difficult to distinguish between koreans/chinese/japanese - as a korean myself it‚Äôs getting harder and harder as chinese and japanese women are embracing more natural/or korean style makeup/fashion, and it‚Äôs not like they check your nationality at the door BUT men who look like they‚Äôre from SEA are commonly discriminated against (vietnamese/cambodian etc).


basically it‚Äôs gatekeeping based on looks and skin colour which as i said in the comment above - is disgusting and indicative of the outdated + discriminatory mentality Korea has as one of the worlds most ethnically homogenous countries regarding looks"

AskAnAmerican,fekpkvb,t1_fekpc3m,1579204962.0,"i meant in the case of foreigners (aka all non koreans), usually yes only whites are readily allowed/welcomed into clubs"
AskAnAmerican,fekl2ze,t1_fekbeyn,1579202285.0,"it‚Äôs kind of an unspoken thing - clubs don‚Äôt advertise themselves as no-foreigner but basically if you aren‚Äôt white you most probably will be turned away by bouncers. aka black/middle eastern/indian/southeast asian etc.


it‚Äôs pretty disgusting and a good example of how common physiognomy and racism is so prevalent in korean society. it isn‚Äôt just limited to foreigners though - if you don‚Äôt meet a certain standard of looks bouncers will turn away ‚Äúugly‚Äù and ‚Äúfat‚Äù koreans. pretty yucky stuff"
