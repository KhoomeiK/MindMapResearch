LiveFromNewYork,ffphvjb,t1_ffldolx,1580095431.0,"Interesting. This is kind of baffling to me because Netflix is usually pretty aggressive about pushing their original content, but I'd never once heard of it until today. Usually I get the reference to whatever SNL is parodying, but this time I had no idea."
dankmemes,ffpfy7c,t1_ffp8hov,1580094081.0,When I checked it they had a thing at the top saying it was being rapidly edited because the subject was recently deceased. I guess they just have a system in place for when it happens.
