Games,ffzt2b0,t1_ffzpwbs,1580392084.0,"Well, I definitely think part of the reason why Microsoft stopped reporting sales is because they lagged so hard behind PS4 in the first 2 years, but at the same time, I don't think that's the whole story. They stopped reporting sales within a few months of Phil Spencer becoming head of Microsoft, and his strategy has always been to focus way more on software rather than hardware. He couldn't care less if you play Gears of War on Xbox or PC, which is also why he allowed several Xbox exclusives to be ported to Switch. It's entirely possible that a big part of the reason why Xbox sales aren't reported anymore is because they just straight up aren't important to Microsoft at the moment - or at least not as important as, say, Game Pass subscribers (which they do report on quite regularly)."

Games,ffzshuk,t1_ffzpu7t,1580391619.0,"Keep in mind that the 64 million number is for early 2019, and yes, at the time the number of sold consoles was definitely way under 64 million - otherwise we have to assume that no people use their 360s and every single Xbox One ever sold continues to be online to this day, and that's just not realistic. Though with that said, Xbox has made great strides with Game Pass and All Access, and I'd definitely be willing to wager that right now the numbers are somewhere between 60 and 65 million - definitely not 40 million, like is sometimes reported. 

As for the PC thing, I believe linking your Live account is optional - it's also possible to just link your regular Microsoft/Windows account and play through that. It's how my non-Xbox owning friends use Game Pass PC."
Games,ffzndyw,t1_ffzjwuz,1580386929.0,"We absolutely can't know for sure, but there are ways we can make an educated guess - for example, as of January 2019 there were 64 million active monthly Xbox Live users. For the same period there were 103 million active monthly PSN users with 106 million sold PS4s, so if the correlation is similar on Xbox (and there's no reason to think it isn't) then as of early 2019 we can assume that Xbox One has sold about 60 million consoles. Honestly I have no idea how many units it moved since, but I would be very reluctant to put the number above 65 million, and even that is a bit of a stretch. With Animal Crossing coming out Switch will see another surge of sold units, so it's definitely going to surpass Xbox One sales in 2020."

It is a *fact* that in the long term piracy increases earnings. In fact one of the best-selling games of all time, Witcher 3, which is routinely on the list of Steam best-sellers, launched on GOG with no DRM. And yet a lot people bought it, some of which pirated it first. Obviously it's not hurting sales. And again I refer you to the studies I linked which support this point across the board. 

It is a *fact* that some developers upload their games to PirateBay specifically because they know the extra exposure will give them more profits. [The developer of Danger Gazer saw a 400% increase in revenue after he uploaded a DRM-free copy on Pirate Bay](https://www.pcgamer.com/indie-game-dev-sees-big-boost-in-sales-after-he-uploads-it-to-the-pirate-bay/). 

It is a *fact* that some games are not available in some regions, and the only way those people get to experience certain games is through piracy. Or there are countries whose citizens are way too poor to afford videogames like more privileged nations, and piracy is the only way they can discover this art form.

These are OBJECTIVE FACTS that are backed by numbers and are not up for debate. 

And yet you're here basically telling me that ""piracy is stealing so it must be wrong"". Yeah, sure, piracy is stealing. I'm here and asking you, in the face of all these facts: So what? If a crime benefits basically everyone, how is that crime ""immoral""?"

You mean beyond the fact that [Steam alone earned $4.3 billion](https://www.statista.com/statistics/547025/steam-game-sales-revenue/) in 2017 *just* from their 30% cut of games sold on their store? Now, in case you're bad at math, that means in 2017 people spent roughly $14.3 billion dollars on games on Steam alone. Now, pretending that every game costs $60 (they don't, most games on Steam cost $30 and below), that means Steam sold over 238 million games. And again, that is *just* on Steam (ignoring Origin, uPlay, GOG, Itch.io, Microsoft store, Amazon, Humble and the *many* other places where you can buy PC games, as well as completely excluding console games), just in 2017, and with greatly inflated average game price. So pretending for a second that you're right and that people who pirate really are the majority, one has to wonder just how many people play videogames when just one platform can sell 238 million games in one year and yet *apparently* more games than that were pirated. Which, by the way, is data not supported at all by major tracking websites that don't get anywhere *near* that many downloads for games combined. The numbers are clear - your friends are in the minority, and most people buy games.

>I'm more inclined to believe the researchers than some random guys on the internet coming up with reasons to justify pirating media.

You know what? Absolutely fair enough. We can crunch numbers all day and yet it's still completely pointless if researchers claim piracy is bad for the industry, right? Shit, if *only* there was a big research commissioned by a major organization that's independent from the gaming industry like the EU to show us once and for all... Oh wait, [yes there is](https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2017-09-25-eu-commission-no-evidence-that-piracy-affects-video-games-sales). And they found out that not only does piracy NOT have a negative effect on sales, it actually had [""significant positive effects""](https://www.pcgamesn.com/eu-commission-piracy-report) on sales. These results are corroborated by [US-based researchers](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/vbwedx/online-piracy-can-be-good-for-business-researchers-find) in several similar studies, all of which have found that piracy actually has a positive effect on the industry.

The film criticism field is male dominated because more men want to be film critics. It's literally that simple. In the era where anyone with a blog or a YT channel can become a critic recognized by RT, sexism just isn't really an excuse anymore."

xboxone,fft1zo1,t1_ffserov,1580202768.0,Seems like wish fulfillment rumors to me. Whenever rumors start floating of a new edition of a game that fixes all the problems the community has with it it's usually bullshit. See also: MGSV Demon Edition.

xboxone,ffsakmi,t1_ffr7g35,1580177147.0,"Sometimes developers just try new things, and sometimes they don't work out. And sometimes they really do. The new God of War was made by the same director as the very first game, plus several of the key staff that worked on it way back in the PS2 era, but it couldn't be more different - in a good way."

xboxone,ffsa1dz,t1_ffr72qj,1580176792.0,"It's not exactly unheard of. Famously Xbox 360's specs changed last-minute (from 256 MB of RAM to 512) literally just because the first Gears of War looked like ass on the original specs - a change that reportedly cost a billion dollars. While I doubt there are any substantial changes to the architecture being done, a last-minute boost in specs isn't entirely out of the question for the PS5."

movies,ffs8fvr,t3_euw5fu,1580175697.0,"The way I see it, actors aren't paid millions of dollars just to act - beyond the obvious brand/name recognition they bring to a project, they also handle promotion, going on tours and premieres, appearing on talk shows, etc. It's grueling work, sometimes even harder and more prolonged than actually shooting the movie. If, say, a movie's composer started doing promotional work and showing up on talk shows and interviews, then he/she too should be paid a substantially higher rate.

I can see interviews/commentary being done after the fact as Blu-Ray extras, but since you mentioned ""promoting the movie"", I think that part's best left to the actors and director."
