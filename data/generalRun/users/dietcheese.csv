WeAreTheMusicMakers,ferr8zy,t3_eqezhn,1579357431.0,"As a composer who studied music in school, Iâ€™ll tell you something that was taught to me: most of the great composers created a TON of very average music.  Maybe 90% of what they did was so-so.  The difference is that they were prolific - they created a lot of material, so of course they would have more successes than those people who agonized over every piece.

The lesson is this:  just keep creating.  Make as much as you can, keep learning and producing.  But realize that most of what you create isnâ€™t going to be amazing and *thatâ€™s ok*.  It doesnâ€™t have to be, so donâ€™t worry about it.  Every day youâ€™re creating, youâ€™re getting better at what you do, regardless of how todayâ€™s ideas sound.

You have to dig through the crap to get to the good stuff!"

All I can offer you is my compassion and, as someone probably older than you, the knowledge that things can get a lot better than you currently think is possible.

Youâ€™re in therapy, which is a smart.  Stick with it and donâ€™t be afraid to change therapists if you havenâ€™t found the right fit.

If you can manage to make responsible choices over the long run, rather than impulsive or emotional ones, you can slowly change patterns, but it takes time.

Expecting him to change will be a terrible mistake.

I don't know how many relationships you've been in but, keep in mind that, even if he stays sober, those crazy initial feelings of love usually fade.  Then the relationship will be nothing more than a burden.

Perhaps most importantly, a relationship with an addict does not provide the stability a child needs. You're better off single.

You sound like a caring person and you clearly have a lot going for yourself, even if you don't feel it completely.  You may have anxiety (and what person getting their doctorate doesn't?) but you don't need to beat yourself up, like there's something wrong with you, just because you've made a few bad choices in the past.  Most of us make stupid choices as we grow.  But there's a better future for you out there if you can find the strength to do what's right for yourself and your child."
