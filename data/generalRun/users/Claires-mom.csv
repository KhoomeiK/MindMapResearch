dogs,ffkesw0,t3_eu2v9r,1580021583.0,"When I brought Jax home, they told me to mix in some scrambled eggs, cottage cheese, canned food, canned pumpkin (no spices), or plain yogurt with his food, if he didn’t want to eat.  They also said to make sure he had access to food at all times.  Are you feeding the puppy the same type of food she was eating before she came home?  If not, I would get some of her old food and gradually mix in the new.  It’s a whole new world for her, so maybe she just needs time to settle in."
depression,ffkatdh,t3_eu27rd,1580019752.0,"I have been where you are.  I know it’s hard to even imagine things getting better, but they will.  Please get help.  They can teach you ways of coping that make the dark times not quite so dark.  You are not alone."
depression,ffk8914,t3_etvxn3,1580018582.0,"I know that it’s scary, but they are there to help you. They need to know.  I have had suicidal ideation since my early teens.  It took me a while to tell my therapist but she acted like it was normal.  She asked if I had any specific plans, what kind of emotional ties that would keep me here...that kind of thing.  It takes a lot to get admitted to the hospital.  I self harmed several times a day, every day and even had worked out a suicide plan and never got sent to a psych ward.  They can help if you let them.  If you don’t feel comfortable with them or if they make you feel bad about yourself, find someone else."
MiniatureSchnauzer,ffk3jvw,t3_etvi5n,1580014719.0,I’m so sorry.
MiniatureSchnauzer,fegr2xk,t3_ep170l,1579100546.0,He’s adorable!  Congratulations!
dogs,fdrcsmg,t3_emqkwq,1578682600.0,I am so sorry.  Puppies and babies should never have to have cancer and die so young.  I am so sorry.
depression,fdrc0an,t3_emnl5m,1578682355.0,"When my doctor’s nurse called me to tell me that I had diabetes, I told her that I would rather have cancer because with cancer, you’re either going to die or get better.  I feel the same way about my depression and anxiety.  I don’t actively plan suicide, but if something happens and I end up dying, I wouldn’t care.  I know it’s horrible, but I wish that all those people who say to just “pray away your depression”, go out and exercise, eat healthy, meditate, do yoga, and on and on, will someday experience depression."
Empaths,fdr9r26,t3_emoenn,1578681494.0,"I am so sorry.  I know how much it hurts when your furbaby crosses over.  I truly believe that when it is our turn to cross over, they will greet us and we will be together always.  Give yourself time to grieve and don’t listen to the a**holes who tell you it was just a dog.  They have never felt the unconditional love a furbaby brings and I feel sorry for them."
rheumatoidarthritis,fdr5zkr,t3_emspj9,1578679951.0,"I was diagnosed in 2006.  My RA is rarely symmetrical.  When I first saw my rheumatologist, she said that she didn’t think I had RA until she did bloodwork.  She put me on methotrexate right away.  If possible, you might want to get a second opinion.  If you really do have RA, the sooner it is treated, the less damage you will have."
aww,fczec3n,t3_ejkabp,1578099275.0,I’m so glad that he got his dog back!  You can totally see the first second she saw her person and nothing was going to stop her.
OCD,fcze031,t3_ejkxkp,1578099065.0,"That surgeon was way out of line.  If all we needed was cardio, power foods, and to think positively, we would have done it years ago."
tattoos,fczcvot,t3_ejkmdq,1578098383.0,I’m so sorry.  I can’t imagine how much pain you are experiencing.   I hope you can find peace.  It is a beautiful remembrance.
depression,fczbva8,t3_ejnao7,1578097789.0,"I do too, especially since the people I vent to went through the same OPP.  I always worry that by venting to them, I am harming them.  I’m afraid that I will put them in a bad place.  My family tries to understand, but they just can’t  get it.  I think the only way to really understand depression and anxiety is to live with it."
dogs,fcy3hhd,t3_ej684e,1578074274.0,"I would keep your puppy and provide it with as many chances to be around other dogs so they know how to be a dog, silly as it sounds.  Any breeder who would sell a puppy that young needs to be reported, shut down, and thrown in jail.  The breeder that I got my puppy from wouldn’t let him go home until he was 8 weeks old.  She let me visit him as much as I wanted so that he knew me so he didn’t have a hard time when he came home with me."
OCD,fcy0dk4,t3_ej9ynq,1578072941.0,"I take 200 MG every night.  It helps me sleep and when I wake up in the middle of the night it helps me get back to sleep.  Everyone is different, but I don’t think you need to worry.  I understand being afraid of taking the med.  every time I start taking a new med, I’m afraid that I will have a fatal reaction.  I take a shit ton of meds and so far, none have killed me.  Just trust your doctor and take the meds.  Remember, your brain lies to you!"

dogs,fcxs988,t3_ej93p4,1578069671.0,"I’m so sorry for your loss.  I hope you can take some comfort that she was able to spend her last days with people who loved her instead of the shelter.  Even though she was yours for a short time, she will live in your heart forever.  

I would take all your vet bills to the shelter and see if they will reimburse you for at least part of what you spent and see if they will allow you to take another dog home with you.  If you aren’t ready to adopt a new dog, I would think they should let you have one when you are.

Take care"
depression,fct0xkp,t3_eip1gj,1577930026.0,"I have thought about suicide for as long as I can remember.  I thought it was normal and that most people had suicidal thoughts.  I finally got help after my life fell apart a few years ago.  I am in a better place, but I still have suicidal thoughts daily.  My therapist keeps telling me that they are just thoughts.  I don’t have control of the thoughts that pop into my head, but I do have control over what I do with those thoughts.  Please get help.  They won’t throw you into the psych ward for admitting  that you have suicidal thoughts.  Even if you aren’t clinically depressed, they can still help you reframe your thoughts so they aren’t as worrisome"

rheumatoidarthritis,fcsvp8t,t3_egt50r,1577926307.0,"From what I’ve read, different doctors have varying opinions on how much alcohol is too much.  My doctor told me to limit it to one adult beverage and to not drink every night.  To each their own."
Meditation,fcsvge4,t1_fcg79y4,1577926127.0,"I think it is pretty common.  When I talked to my therapist about it, she wasn’t surprised.  She just encouraged me to keep trying and maybe to focus on something else.  She also suggested using a glass bead or a worry stone so that I could keep myself grounded.  Good luck!  I hope you can find something that works for you!"
Meditation,fcbpme5,t3_egykks,1577589571.0,"Yes.  Hearing someone breathe is very triggering for me, even when it’s my own breath, so it took a long time for me to be able to meditate without making my anxiety worse or causing a panic attack.  There is no right or wrong way to meditate.  You have to do what works for you.  What helped me was focusing on something else, like a candle flame, music, nature sounds, or a rhythmic movement such as a walking meditation.  Walking meditations had the added benefit of burning off some of my nervous energy."
depression,fcbnjq5,t3_egzqgq,1577588894.0,"You’re not alone.  I’ve relapsed so many times. For me, the most important thing is to figure out what caused me to relapse so maybe the next time I start to grab my razor blades, I can stop and try something else.  When I do cut, I try to give myself credit for all the times I didn’t cut and  to not let my relapse become an excuse to fall back into my old patterns of self harm.  Take care of yourself."
rheumatoidarthritis,fcbbqj9,t3_egt50r,1577584920.0,"I haven’t noticed any issues with alcohol.  I have even been known to have a drink or two on my methotrexate day.  If it helps, I usually drink rum and coke, margaritas, or wine."
Anxiety,fc12ir7,t3_efhvg8,1577306404.0,"Yes.  Anxiety has totally ruined my life.  I dropped out of college because of my anxiety.  I never had sex or even a serious relationship due to my anxiety over contamination.  When I have to go to the store, I know that store security is following me, just waiting for me to steal something, even though I’ve never stolen anything in my life.  I can’t go to new places unless one of my sisters or my mom is with me.  As time moves on, my world is getting smaller and smaller and I’m afraid that I will soon be limited to the confines of my home.  I have wasted my life due to my anxiety and now it is too late to change.  If I didn’t have my dog, I don’t think I would still be here.  If you are suffering from anxiety, please get help.  Please don’t throw your life away like I have."
