Maybe you want to warn others like family or tribe, maybe your strategy is to seem scarier than the predator (predators constantly have to consider whether or not attacking something is worth the energy you expend - not all attacks lead to food, and if you get hurt and you are left without food after you are pretty much fucked), so this is a viable strategy), and some species also do diversions to lure predators away from more vulnerable members of the flock, maybe the given predator isn't a danger to you so there's no reason to be quiet because it's around; the Etruscan Pygmy Shrew is very much a predator, and a ferocious one too, but very few mammals or birds fear it or have reasons to go silent just because it's around, maybe you're a predator yourself and you'd like whoever is on your turf to fuck off.

fatlogic,fc9puxq,t1_fc8pg09,1577556390.0,"They don't.  Inuits don't live carb-free, that's a myth.

Traditional Inuit diets derive approximately 50% of their calories from fat, 30–35% from protein and 15–20% of their calories from carbohydrates, largely in the form of glycogen from the raw meat they consumed. This high fat content provides valuable energy and prevents protein poisoning, which historically was sometimes a problem in late winter when game animals grew lean through winter starvation. It has been suggested that because the fats of the Inuit's wild-caught game are largely monounsaturated and rich in omega-3 fatty acids, the diet does not pose the same health risks as a typical Western high-fat diet.

Lots of people in legal prostitution have been trafficked. Lots of them have come to the countries they are in on false premises and then been left with virtually no other option.    
Legal prostitution doesn't in any way mean that the prostitutes wants to be there.   
People also have a tendency to forget that not all people who do it voluntary actually want to do it, and that in it self is a form of forced prostitution.         
When it's out of desperation and it feels like the only thing you can do to avoid starving and/or dying and/or being homeless, etc, is it really voluntary?    


I believe that prostitution should be legal because it's the only way to properly protect sex workers. I don't want  there to be an abundance of it, I want there to always be social options so that women don't have to. I've stood on that ledge myself and it was a bad, bad place to stand.
