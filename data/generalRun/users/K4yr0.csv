depression,ff7u6pd,t3_cml6ni,1579658455.0,"Today there was an event from my former university in a club. It was called ""science arena"" and supposed to introduce the smaller fields of science to potential students. I'm a neet, don't know what to do, just feeling empty. Didn't really want to go in the first place because of bad social anxiety (sometimes driving for almost an hour and then not being able to open a door) but parents expected me to go.

Gps sent me the wrong way so I wasn't in front of the club but a few hundred meters away from it. Sat in the car for 15 minutes again (like I did so fucking often before I ""had"" to go social events cause locked cars are just nice safe spaces) before I left and walked an icy path through a forests with no lights while having no idea if this was even the right way. All while cursing my damn brain again. Even anxiety or depression or whatever isn't as bad as being so fucking stupid and doing incredibly irrational shit over and over again, often without noticing. 

Managed to find the club. The same club I visited as a student ten years ago. Where I had one of the worst experiences in my life. But who cares about that one thing from the past when there has been so much more shit since then. Even worse than looking at your past from today is imagining how your past self would've looked at this. Sorry dude, it only got way, way worse and it never stops. 

Guy outside the club. Managed to make some smalltalk. Left afterwards but couldn't  open the door of the club. While freezing I pulled out my phone (which has no reception) and pretended to write stuff while I waited if someone else was coming. When a couple came I could enter as well. 

Tldr ""science arena"": it was teachers from each field talking about it. Some stuff was kinda interesting and entertaining, others boring. If anything it told me how much charisma some people are having and that you should pick your major according to which professor is funny and can keep you awake. None of the fields were something I wanted to study though.

But _at least_ I managed to stay in one room with people. I am probably supposed to call this ""a success"" but stuff like that is killing me. I am so alone and so dysfunctional; other people go out to find a partner, I am ""happy"" if I can manage to stay in one room with young people (not even talking with them) without screaming inside. 

Afterwards there was a buffet and people talking with each other. Had nothing to talk about, scared of someone approaching me. This is usually the time I leave asap but I managed to stay a whopping 20 minutes before I left. 

When I got home I got berated from both parents that I was home so early already (even though the event was over anyways). They're absolutely clueless. Mom told me I just shpuld've done something with other people afterwards, absolutely no idea.

Small positive aspect of the evening: warmed my hands at a dying brazier outside, hands smell like smoke, campfire and childhood now."
depression,ff4ph6x,t3_ererwo,1579569303.0,"Yes, this is ""having no plans for the future"". Stuff just doesn't change that way. Often it will end up worse.

I guess this is similar to being poor and trying to get by with the little money you have. Trying to save something to get out of this situation but it's never enough. Being poor is fucking expensive and being mentally at the bottom is totally exhausting."
depression,ff4p9ap,t3_cml6ni,1579569148.0,Can't stop playing the waiting dog song from futurama in my head while I'm wasting my life.
depression,felmgpy,t3_cml6ni,1579225695.0,"A few days ago there was a package for me in the mail. I don't know anyone so I already suspected it was from my former therapist and I was right. I sent her a christmas card I made three weeks ago (just the card, without text) because I got so much time on my hands, I am so bored, I have no social contacts and idk. I'm still angry on her but none of this is making any sense to begin with. 

Anyways she sent me a small bottle with a liquid and a text that she was happy about the card and that she sent me the bottle if I might want to try out something. I guess it's called ""aromatherapy"" and afaik it could _theoretically_ work... at least it's not complete bogus like other alternative medicine. Fyi she is a fully licensed psychologist but also does some alternative treatment now and then but usually doesn't bother me with that. 

Haven't tried it yet. Not sure why, no energy, selfhatred, not doing positive things on purpose, not expecting anything, take your pick. If anything I'm more to blame for this whole situation cause I'm too stupid to go to a doctor and take real medicine. 

Pls no responses that just rant on my therapist cause that's just reflecting on me."
2meirl4meirl,feg5pvk,t3_eoxvan,1579078160.0,"And I'm afraid of my family, school or being in public. I basically only move between home and school. I don't do _anything_ on my own, my only goals in life are ""avoid anything that hurts"" and ""do what's expected of you"" (which is an eternal conflict). My greatest fear is anyone noticing that I'm ""not working"" or not being functional. Me being addicted to video games is probably still one of the healthiest parts of that life. 

Yeah, great times. /s"
depression,fecxz92,t3_eofgoa,1578989201.0,Nope. I'd settle for someone who just likes my presence though. I've been chasing after other people for years and still have no spcial contacts.
2meirl4meirl,fec14xf,t3_eo5ojb,1578965117.0,"""Apparently my irrational fears aren't _that_ irrational after all"" is just the worst. It makes selfdoubts ten times as bad."

depression,fe0ybsg,t3_cml6ni,1578820228.0,"""Well, you gotta start taking responsibility for your life and start working on it yourself if you want it to get better!""

_spends years and tons of energy trying to improve something_

""Well you shouldn't always try to do everything alone and on your own, accept other people's help.""

???

There's just _isn't_ any help, I'm so sick of waiting, sick of endlessly talking in front of people who are just silent and like ""yeah that's _your_ problem, dude"". 

All of this is such a dumb loop."
depression,fdkiyvp,t3_elqwy9,1578504734.0,"Social anxiety since I was ten, no friends my entire life, barely left the home between age 10 and 25. Not realizing I was ill until that point, starting therapy which didn't help and made some things worse. Multiple times in life thinking I wasted my life despite everything I did. Stuck in so many loops that may last years. 

Feeling empty all my life. No interests, no passion. Studied a crap major, like my (extremely controlling) parents told me to. My ""career"" basically doesn't exist. I'm years behind in development, both in internal maturity as well as ""where one is supposed to be in life"". Still can't do a lot of things average 18 year olds are able to do.

Spent so much time and energy trying not to have such a pos personality. Apparently didn't work cause still not a single friend. Doing really insane things, sometimes for years, while either not noticing or not being able to do anything about it. 

Tl, dr: wrong gender, weird sexuality, catastrophic social and professional life, abusive family, awful personality, wasted life. ""Not existing"" is my number one goal, if I had a button I would've pushed it by now. Still to much anxiety and too little energy to make an attempt."
depression,fdkhqtr,t3_eloddk,1578504115.0,"Both therapist and social anxiety: ""yeah but that party wasn't _that_ good to begin with, right? You didn't really want that anyways, you don't even really like parties, you're not the right kind of person for them. Which is totally okay btw, some people just prefer staying _alone_ and doing things on their own instead. As long as one is content doing this (or at least persuades them that it is) everything's fine!""

It just kills me when therapists tell me the same stuff my lying body has told me for years as well."
depression,fdkhb03,t3_cml6ni,1578503869.0,"Therapist: ""why don't you let your family help you? They'd like to, you know?""

Mfw my family has been so controlling I could've as well grown up in a cult that forbids any contact with outsiders. Me trying to get away from this for years, if I could I'd teleport to New Zealand and break all contact with my family"
depression,fd9gk1e,t1_fd6bgmc,1578233015.0,Thanks. Imo sometimes it's good to find precise analogies to describe complex conditions that would otherwise need a lot of explanations.
depression,fd64klo,t3_cml6ni,1578185443.0,Am I some kind of Dorian Grey-image for my brother? Cause the better his life gets the worse gets mine.
depression,fctus92,t3_cml6ni,1577960612.0,My whole family is a pyramid scheme. Get another child to fix the first one. If there would've been another kid coming after me I would've turned out fine.
depression,fcr51uw,t3_cml6ni,1577896877.0,"""I've got no interests.""

A shallow, boring person?

Or a chemical imbalance in the brain?

Both?"
depression,fcoboct,t3_cml6ni,1577828312.0,Desperatedly tried to do something today so I didn't have to spend time with my parents. But I'm absolutely exhausted. Only option would've been driving to the next city and walking around while having social anxiety. Another lose lose situation. Can't stand NYE.
depression,fckl7ky,t3_cml6ni,1577727750.0,"My ""plans"" (or rather the small hint of them) for NYE have vanished. Ofc I've procrastinated and avoided dealing with them as long as I could because it's negative and stressful alltogether.

Thought I could go to a bdsm party like last year where I at least know a few people and my social anxiety is tolerable. But this year there isn't any. 

I don't have any friends and have literally no idea where else to go. There've been NYE in the past where I ran alone through inner cities on the search of idk what, just being fucking out of my mind. Can't stay at home either cause my family is bothering me. It's lose lose all over again."
depression,fc5kt5i,t3_cml6ni,1577460275.0,"I _can't_ stay at home at New year's eve, I _have_ to go out and find anything where I can kill time until midnight is over. Something I can tolerate despite screaming social anxiety and no friends. 

Can't stand nye, I had so many horrible ones. Last year I've been at a bdsm party where I also knew some people and while it certainly wasn't easy it was at least not spending time with my family. 

Still, no progress at all since then."
depression,fbzydq8,t1_fbxkghe,1577268456.0,"No, we don't do that. The big rule in my family always has been ""dont ask, dont tell"". People rather swallow things up or retreat instead of having real confrontations.

Gotta pretend everythings fine!"
depression,fbxfa0b,t3_cml6ni,1577184371.0,"Social anxiety: being the kid who is afraid to play with other children and hides behind their mother - except while being almost 30 years old. 

Have fun trying to explain to others that it's an actual illness and not just being an awful, boring person. Plus being extra embarrassed of everything, all the time."
depression,fbumb7h,t3_cml6ni,1577116802.0,"One day before christmas and already a big argument with my mom. Trying to control everything. It's a big house but I feel like there's no square inch that's truly my own. I also get blamed for the most ridiculous stuff (""it's not clean in here"" -> ""that's why you always have allergies"" -> ""it's your own fault that you have allergies""). That's how it's been my entire life, no matter if it's physical or mental problems. Either you're able to fix it on your own or fuck you. 

Too exhausted and stupid to move out. Don't have any plan, only feel empty. Tomorrow all of us are gonna pretend being a happy family again cause that's something we've always been good at."
