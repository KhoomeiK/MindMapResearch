SuicideWatch,fefg8ew,t1_fefg38a,1579055673.0,thanks. I’m sorry you sympathize. You seem like a good person. You don’t deserve to suffer. I do deserve to suffer.
SuicideWatch,fdrnuuj,t1_fdrmm79,1578687194.0,"But if I declare bankruptcy, I’ll still be screwed. No one wants anything to do with someone who sucks at everything financial."
SuicideWatch,fd3tl54,t1_fd1sd9r,1578161526.0,"There has to be something wrong with me. When I give niceness, or kindness, I usually get hate, dislike and annoyance in return. There’s no point in trying. I’m destined to be hated and no one would care if I died. If anything, they’d celebrate. I’m a fucking piece of trash."
SuicideWatch,fd0wqs1,t1_fcwjyt9,1578124802.0,"I’m thinking about destroying my relationships with my family before I die. Not that I have much of one to begin with, but I want them to be as relieved as possible when I kill myself. I’m not preparing anything now, but I do have a plan in place."
SuicideWatch,fcslcl6,t3_eieayu,1577918958.0,Yes. Why was I given another year when it’s clear that I’m just going to waste it?
SuicideWatch,fc3fd8l,t1_fbze0ea,1577388571.0,"I left without telling anyone, but next get together I’ll try that"
