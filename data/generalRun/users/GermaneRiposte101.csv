Alas, his epic history of the world was not enough.

The issue of when to use 'cis' is, in part, context driven. If I was an environment where there were proportionally significant numbers of trans people then it may be appropriate to use the word 'cis' to describe myself: because I am no longer the usual, expected or typical.
