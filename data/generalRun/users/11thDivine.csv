That is just as retarded.

Because that is what this thread is all about, complaining that they don't go the long way to make him/her cum.

There is no abuse involve you moron.

You are the reason real abuse loses importance, because you scream abuse like a bitch to every little thing.

Any way this post seems similar to another recent one where a girl got dead drunk at a house party,has sex with her drunk friend and tries to frame it as a rape in the morning [https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship\_advice/comments/eoamyr/i\_22f\_was\_raped\_by\_my\_friend\_21m\_and\_now\_i\_dont/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web2x](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/eoamyr/i_22f_was_raped_by_my_friend_21m_and_now_i_dont/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x)"

If he says anything just put your finger on his lips,tell him to shut up,relax and just start making out with you taking the lead.

I mean,the more experienced person should and in this case its you.And no ,you don't ""tell"" him how and what to do,you ""show"" him by doing it to him and eventually he will learn.

Hold his face if you have to so he understands how you want it and to be in control of the pace"

The age difference is quite big but again depending on where you live it might be okay if they do engange in any sexual activity and there is nothing you could do about that.I think you should have seen this coming from miles away.

Anyway if you daughter does not like him then you should also see it coming that he might end up sexually abusing her so I think you should definitely split up if you value your daughter more than you or him"

I am not surprised her bf is angry and probably very skeptic because as she said,she did not tell him the full story, nor does she tell us the full story.

I am not hating anyone and if you look through my comment section as you probably did you will see i often take the woman's and man's side in issues when it is reasonable to do so.

In this case,this situatuion does not seem as black and white as you make it seem like."

You should feel scared for your stupid mind and realize that you're actually not that intelligent.
Anyway the guy got drunk too,that means he was also probably not in the situation to think clearly either and for all he knew she was most likely okay with fucking at that time so again you can eat shit.

Like where is she in this thread saying ""I should have been more responsible with myself""?No where,she literally slept in a burning house and complains she got burned by blaming the fire.
She's the kind of person that if police would tell her ""don't walk into dangerous neighborhood at night "" she would call it ""sexist and don't tell me what to do""
I have absolutely zero sympathy for these kind of situations.
