NoStupidQuestions,fff5tfw,t1_ffetjiz,1579876453.0,"Motels and Hotels are supposed to have a limit on how long you can stay, so some of these owners check them out and then re-check them in to make them appear as if they are new residents coming in on paper. So if police look at hotel check ins and check outs its ok but a lot of these ppl make $$$ from those who have bad credit or cant afford local housing costs. Theres a few documentaries on ppl who do this.

Other comments were more them being biased/giving you a hard time. Maybe some mild bragging since they felt they could do a better job than the person doing it. Some mild ageism ( if your younger than them) stereotyping. 

I think theres a line between Misinformed stereotypes and being outright sexist.

Advice,fewvrhc,t3_eqt50n,1579420250.0,"Its a common thing people disagree with, in all honesty its up to society and the laws of the land you live in to decide whether or not you believe in them or not. Whether or not you both agree on if they should die, you can both just acknowledge they were wrong, they deserve to be punished and that its out of both your hands.  

I think people deserve second chances, and murder is wrong myself but many see things as an eye for an eye. If someone raped girls on a college campus I understand why people would want them to die. Actions have consequences at the end of the day these ppl made a choice and some of these choices can lead to the loss of life."

college,feuyro6,t1_feuedu6,1579391275.0,Probably cuz they required a minimum gpa of some kinda there are some open enrollment 99% acceptance rate places that take anybody or placement courses. Your college record is linked to social security  for scholarship purposes so if you were getting financial aid or a scholarship that would also affect at this point though if you drop beneath a 2.0 you don’t usually get aid anyway. Fin aid is only valid up to a certain amount of semesters so technically not being enrolled would loose you one.

Legit, if you got 1 A, and 4 Fs admissions is going to not allow you into college unless you go in on probation if they even allow that, most places will throw you out under a 1.9GPA. Starting fresh as if you have not been to college is best bet, but downvote me if ya want, Im sorry the college system is messed up.
