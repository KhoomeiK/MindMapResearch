politics,ffi5uta,t1_ffhnxx7,1579965891.0,"You said it best, I’m not nearly as conservative as I thought I was. I believe that most people just don’t have the time dedicated to look into or read about what is really going on in our country, less so the world. I am fortunate enough to not have to work so I have that time. Instead of watching YouTube clips of Tucker or the Don’t Walk, Run guy I started looking for real journalism."
politics,ffi0mtu,t1_ffhkup9,1579961455.0,Thanks. I like your flair. Fuck Josh Hawley. Another vote I got wrong.
politics,ffi0dyp,t1_ffhjyhf,1579961216.0,"I had a big, long reply typed out to you. But instead I’ll keep it short and simply say ,”Go fuck yourself. You don’t know me.”"
TrueAskReddit,ffhhnlj,t1_ffgbdo6,1579935663.0,"Yea, it’s bad when pharmacist graduate and can’t find full-time employment. My wife has friends that tell her they have 3 PT jobs."

politics,ffhh1kl,t1_ffhaoy8,1579934897.0,"I think the older generation is too brow beat into falling in line to do anything other than not jump off the sinking ship. It’s like the Chinese health workers during the one child policy. All these years later they knew it was wrong, but they toed the (Communist) Party line because they’d been conditioned to do so."
politics,ffhgjxx,t1_ffh8nsw,1579934299.0,Username fuckin checks out big time!
politics,ffhg0tg,t3_etks9x,1579933673.0,"Never in a million fucking years would I, or anyone who knows me, ever believe that I am so ready to vote for Bernie Sanders come November. I have voted for the republican in every county, state and federal election since turning 18 in 2000, and I will never cast a vote for ANYONE with an (R) behind their name again..."
todayilearned,ffgizbi,t3_ethf27,1579907326.0,I’m more interested in his bringing the railroad industry to its knees and pretty much single-handedly throwing the country’s economy into a depression.
rant,ffg02fq,t1_fffvcqh,1579895546.0,"This behavior is not confined to the Chinese alone. Still using Disney as an example, you can find Italians, French, Brazilians and more who act in this same manner. So yes, absolutely I would feel the same, regardless where they come from."
rant,fffcoaq,t1_fff2feu,1579881045.0,"To be fair, it’s kind of hard to be tolerant as you watch a group of 40 Chinese tourists at Disney World damn near trample your wife and child to get a fucking Dole Whip."
TrueOffMyChest,fffcfhk,t3_etaq54,1579880893.0,"I don’t know why we need the fancy terms at all. You either like dick, like pussy, like both, or none at all. That seems simpler to me. But I’m a simple Midwesterner who loves pussy!"
Libertarian,fffavt8,t1_ffed9gp,1579879909.0,Fighting a recession caused by your predecessor will do that.
Libertarian,fffabae,t1_ffefrmr,1579879549.0,"What about him? The bailouts that happened under his administration HAD to happen. Yea, it sucks that we bailed out billionaire bankers and automakers. But if we hadn’t we would have seen another Depression, and that would have been devastating to the entire country. We would probably still be feeling the effects even now. But hey, any excuse to blame the black guy, right?!?"
Libertarian,fffa12z,t1_ffey9kh,1579879363.0,The U.S. sure gave shit when Gaddafi proposed that the African states move to a gold-backed currency instead of the dollar. It is naive and childlike to believe our government doesn’t bully weaker nations into submission at will.
Libertarian,fff9na5,t1_fff1nqn,1579879116.0,It’s hilarious that there are people who still like to blame Democrats for all the woes in our nation. They have a majority in the House and nothing more. The (R)s hold the Senate and White House. Any negative pressures put on our economy is squarely on them.
politics,ffb3jer,t1_ffb33g6,1579750869.0,"Not just the jury, but their elected position. Blatantly disregarding your constitutionally bound duty is seriously disgusting!"
TrueOffMyChest,ff7cshi,t1_ff74ynr,1579646556.0,"I never said they weren’t. Like I said, I’m all for personal choice in how anyone wants to live their life. That kind of lifestyle just grosses me out. But I don’t spend my time online gay bashing, or protesting gay or trans rights in real life. You can disagree with something and NOT be an asshole about it, you know."
TrueOffMyChest,ff745d1,t3_es0ddc,1579640750.0,"I believe I’ll get flamed for my opinion, but here goes. I personally don’t care what you are or what you like, as long as you’re not a pedophile. But transsexuals and even gay people just gross me out. Doesn’t mean I want to hunt them down carrying a torch or pitchfork as part of the mob, but I don’t want to associate with them either."

technology,fdo8w15,t1_fdo8eox,1578600910.0,I don’t think that they need more service. It is just that the majority of Americans don’t know how to do services on their own vehicles anymore.
NoStupidQuestions,fdnxbex,t3_emd0cp,1578594738.0,"I imagine if you are good enough with a rifle it’s not as hard as you think. Hell, here in the U.S. we have people shooting in competitions at distances up to almost a mile."
NoStupidQuestions,fdnvdwv,t3_emcs1u,1578593616.0,I only poop during or after a rain. I just drag my ass around the grass like a wormy dog. Can’t beat mother nature’s wet wipes!
