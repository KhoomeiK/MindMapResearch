Also, two weeks is amazing! Next time, try three weeks! And after that four weeks!"

depression,ffhc8so,t3_etlw2x,1579929601.0,"Do you feel safe enough to tell your mum or dad about your feelings? How you're feeling angry, about you thinking your mum hates you a little. About how you feel how your sister treats your cat and how your parents react on it? Of so, tell them. Let them know. In a relaxed setting. Not when you or they are angry. 

When I was younger (24 now, but let's say when I was 10-18) I was really angry. I had lots of fights with my father and my mum always told me to ""play nice and behave because you're older"" whenever I got hit or bullied or something.
I wish now I was verbal about my feelings, but it's something I had to learn and am still in therapy for.
But I've always known I could tell my mum anything about everything. I just didn't had the verbal and mental skills to do so. (Father is a different story and not relevant)

I really hope you figure it out. Maybe ask your parents for a therapist to help you with your anger issues? Or if you're old enough, look one for yourself, if you don't want your parents involved. There is no shame in wanting to not be angry all the time, there is no shame in getting a little help with that. You deserve better than to fight for some validation from your parents.

Best of luck to you!"
