AmItheAsshole,ff7dqiu,t1_ff6vovi,1579647195.0,"Once I threw out a bowl of chilli on carne that I made in cooking class in school. It was a Friday so I thought the cleaners would be changing all the general waste bags so all good. Monday when I got back to school, the minute I walked in the door I was hit with the worst smell. Apparently they'd sourced the smell to my weekend-old chilli. I didn't see it myself but man I heard it was crawling with all kinds of stuff. I was TA, should have brought it home to dispose of it, lesson learned. Op YTA, take out your trash!"

AmItheAsshole,fetb14z,t1_fepl3hr,1579373504.0,"Awh well then, definitely NTA. Lot's of married couples that I know have separate accounts and then a shared one they both pay into. It's a great system. Plus down the line if one of you should end up earning less than the other, it's not like you're gonna let your husband or wife fall into poverty. There's so many reasons this is a good idea. The main one is that most people don't want to be completely controlled by another person. My granny used to say ""a little freedom for alot of love"". So cheesy but true."
FoodPorn,fet4b3g,t1_fet3uy1,1579371712.0,We've got a franchise in Ireland called Centra. It's like a convenience store with a hot and cold deli. The hash browns are triangular and amazing.

AmItheAsshole,femuard,t1_feljjjk,1579269787.0,"Yeah, that's called grooming. Women can be an integral part of the process. Also maybe the husbands and wives all want to use your daughter in one way or another. I agree that further education isn't for everyone but at least let the kid finish highschool. And for the love of fuck, stop trying to live vicariously through your daughter. Disappointed in your own life? Do something about it. Don't fuck up two lifetimes just because yours didn't shape up exactly how you wanted."
