childfree,ffvbfff,t3_evdf7g,1580260166.0,"Seeing pregnant women doesn't make me feel sick, maybe slightly repulsed and really glad it's not me. I definitely don't find it beautiful or magical or anything worth awing over. It's a completely different story when I think of myself being pregnant though, I can feel my body tensing up and my stomach start feeling like I want to vomit. That's a big ol'NOPE. Every part of it is gross and not okay. I have always thought of it as having a parasite. A worm. Something that just should not be in there. And then, the aftermath... no. No. No. no. no. no. Nope. I don't want to hate my body. I don't want my body destroyed. I don't want my mental health jeopardized more than it already is."
relationship_advice,ffv9sdw,t3_eveqa5,1580259067.0,"As somebody with Bipolar, you're not doing him any favors by letting him go with his condition untreated. While he may seem like he's managing it okay without medication, he's not stable. You're allowing him to abuse you and I can promise, no matter how often he goes through your phone or he tracks your whereabouts, you're still going to be cheating on him (in his head). Those behaviors are not okay and are not excused by mental illness.  Urge him to get treatment. Respect yourself enough to leave if he doesn't."

Anxiety,ffv8kpc,t3_evei6i,1580258250.0,"They have to accept your paperwork as long as it's from a doctor, not one of those online scam things that say you can register it as an ESA for $29.99 or whatever. Make an appointment with your therapist ASAP and let them know this is what you're there for. Mine asked how my dogs helped - I have two and they both behave different when I'm in episodes so I need both of them with me at work.

Some doctors may require more than one or two appointments to establish a need but keep after it."
CICO,ffv7vf9,t3_evekej,1580257779.0,"In my experience it doesn't matter, it's really just personal preference. Maybe a larger meal in the middle of the day will ward of the random hungeries, or a larger meal at night keep you from snacking. Experiment and see which is better for you."

AskWomenOver30,fft7b80,t3_euv6gp,1580210727.0,I have used reusable pads in the past (haven't had a period in a very long time however) and I loved them way more than tampons or disposable pads. I bought mine of Etsy yeeeaaarrrssss ago. They're still in my top drawer for the future. I didn't have heavy periods though. They were light and lasted maybe 3 days max.

My co-pay with my private insurance is $35 (Blue Cross). My doctor's name is Dr. Johnson with the Birmingham VA Hospital in Alabama. In all I'll be paying nothing for the surgery or anything to do with it."
childfree,fft68jf,t3_euyhe4,1580209259.0,"Be straightforward about it. You're not there to discuss birth control options, you're there to discuss sterilization. Do you know which surgery it is that you'd like to have? Mention it by name. It's not about knowing more on the subject than the professional does, it's all about knowing exactly what you want for yourself and your life and that is something you DO know more about than the doctor. Good luck! I hope everything works out for you!!!"
childfree,fft5sqo,t3_ev3xho,1580208621.0,"I was just approved for bilateral salp recently (26 days, can't wait!) and I did so the first time I spoke to that doctor about it. I had seen him once before to have an exam but that was it. He didn't even look at my husband who I brought with me because I have always been told he'd need to give me permission. I told him what I wanted and why (""I have never and will never want to experience pregnancy or raise a child"") and he asked me how soon I wanted surgery.  He was ready to do it next week but I had to schedule it out a couple of weeks because of work.

I don't have any wisdom for the insurance though. I'm having surgery through a VA hospital and they'll pick up whatever my private insurance doesn't cover if there's any it doesn't."

Advice,ffsysxq,t3_ev2e6q,1580198243.0,If they're doing your exam they'll be the ones you can tell. I would try to bring yourself to mention it before the exam starts so they can be mindful while they're examining. You're really brave for wanting to tell somebody and get checked out.
loseit,ffsxs2r,t3_ev1hc0,1580196924.0,"It's all just strategies. Everybody has something that works for them to help them eat at a deficit. You're highly unlikely to go into starvation mode though so cross that off your list of ""what is going on here body"" possibilities. The first time I lost weight (164 down to 145-150) it took me 12 weeks to lose 12-13 lbs. This time (184-167 currently) I lost 10-13 lbs in the first couple of weeks because of all the water retention, since then I""ve been at a 1 - 1.25 lb a week weight loss.

WeightLossAdvice,ffsvla2,t1_ffsv9bs,1580194216.0,"Agreed. If you love chips, eat chips! Do you plan on going the rest of your life without them? Probably not. Find a way to make it work. There are healthier options out there it just takes a little looking to find the one that is best for you. If you want chips every day, allow yourself 1 serving of chips a day, prep that 1 serving into little baggies or containers,  fit it in your calorie/macro budget, have yourself a snack! No need to be miserable."
WeightLossAdvice,ffshsfm,t1_ffshexb,1580182024.0,Nope! Your body is gonna do its thing no matter what time it is. As long as you're in a calorie deficit you're going to lose weight.

WeightLossAdvice,ffshara,t3_euzn5v,1580181691.0,"Really, unless medically advised not to, you can eat whenever you want. Your metabolism doesn't know or care what time it is - it's concerned with WHAT you're putting into your body and not so much when. Try saving a little food for later and see if that helps your issue. I always get ""hungry"" (I'm not physically hungry, I just want to eat) after work around midnight, I save my protein shake for then. It satisfies my hunger and that craving for something sweet as it tastes just like a chocolate shake."

You need to up that for sure if you're looking for more defined muscle/to build muscle/to repair muscle.  

There's a thing called body recomp, it's not cutting or bulking but not exactly maintenance either - I've only casually looked it up so I can't tell you much about it but that's what I'd try to find more information on if I were you. You should be able to figure out what the macros (focus on those right now instead of micros) are for your goal. Outside of finding the right macros, in the gym focus on higher reps with lower/medium weight (more bodybuilding style of form and whatnot). You still need to push yourself though but I think that's common sense and since it's not your first time under a bar I'm sure you know that."
FitnessMotivation,ffscn6a,t1_ffsc9oj,1580178528.0,I'll just be getting to work around that time. I'll shoot you a message around then to see how it went! What's your focus tomorrow?

Drastically changed my diet in one day and lost like 10 lbs in 2 weeks - seriously. Water weight fell off fast. A month into it I had lost 13 lbs and then started working out.

Advice,ff4d9rb,t3_erkgiy,1579560883.0,"Is there an end to your financial struggles in sight? Like, in two months we'll be caught up - kind of thing? If so, you could reach out to local rescues and maybe some food pantries and see if they can help with food and litter for your babies. If it's going to be a longer term problem maybe you could find a foster or a couple of fosters to house them just until you're in a better situation. If it were me in the position I would absolutely try a gofundme and any other kind of fundraising I could. My babies are my babies and they come before all including my pride."
paypal,ff47s45,t3_erek8r,1579557398.0,I tried for 6 months to change my name after a legal name change and it would never happen so I had to delete my account and make a new one. I used the same email address not even 5 minutes after I deleted the old one.

Anxiety,fep4q1q,t3_eqa1dp,1579312086.0,Ah! I'm so excited for you! I've been volunteering full time with animal rescues around me for 4 years now and I've done countless transports for rescues all over the country and when I tell you that it has really improved my mental health I'm not exaggerating in the least. I've got my husband into it and I can tell it's helped his confidence and self esteem. You're going to love it!
loseit,feoqhmd,t3_eq1kpc,1579303985.0,I just had a whole giggle fit. I'm really happy you posted this. I've been having this same problem this week but I never thought to check into what I was eating until browsing the comments. I've always had a wonky digestive system so I figured it was just being a jerk because that's what it does.
