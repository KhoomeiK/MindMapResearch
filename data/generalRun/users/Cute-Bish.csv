Of course it won’t be easy but I have to think about it more..ur words helped me and I am sure it will again when I come to this post and read the comments again in the future ^ ^

As for my parents..I know it’s not healthy to look after them..after all they are MY PARENTS..they are the ones who should look after me but thr real reason that made me fight for them (other than wanting thrm to be happy again together) is my sibling’s safety..I am the oldest and the second to oldest is my sis who is only 13 years old..then come my little brothers that are still in primary school..anyways back to what I was saying..I wanted to keep my parents together so my siblings can still grow up in a “normal” family wish both paremts still living together in the same house..even if it’s a lie..I just want my parents to wait for divorce..at least till my siblings kinda grow up a little bit..we are already living in hell..I don’t want to worsen it to them u know..

I know I moght be forcing my parents to stay together and be miserable..But parents shouldn’t just think about themselves u know??

They have jobs..they have kids..they have responsibilities and etc..so maybe if they agree to wait..their relationship might heal back a little bit dusing the wait and then ACTUALLY get back together..

And for my parents..I had the same mindset of yours but again..guilt struck in..the thought that I could do something and help them but not doing it KILLS..it makes me feel super selfish and undeserving of the “getting a life in another country” thing..like I am out there being happy when my parents are fighting and probably living miserably (btw..They support what I want and Thry do actually want me to get out of here and love a better life..it’s just me who is overthing all of this heheh..probably because of the feeling of guilt)"
