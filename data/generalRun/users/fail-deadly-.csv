Additionally, humanity is now part of the an immense cacophony of cultures, religious beliefs/myths/origin stories, fashions, and personal preferences, plus it seems that people advertising would have a smaller effect on fashion and personal perferences matched with upbringing would have a much stronger influence, since our capitalistic consumer focused system is gone, replaced by the Federation's new economic model."
asoiaf,fg6rc92,t1_fg6jrnl,1580575101.0,"Ned wasn't helping Robert though. Ned was investigating the death of Jon Arryn. He had no plan for Jon, and although he didn't want Jon to do it, he wasn't willing to have it out with Cat, and especially when Maester Luwin said it was a good idea. It is obvious Ned wants to have very little to do with Robert, despite a few wistful memories in Game of Thrones.

The only problem is, Ned wasn't that good of a detective, when he did find evidence, he blabs it out to his prime suspect, then moves extremely slowly, and against all of the advice of nearly EVERYONE in King's Landing. Basically every player in King's Landing -  Varys, Renly, Littlefinger and even fucking Cersei Lannister - all told Ned he was fucking up. Did he listen? Nope.

Then \*surprised Pikachu face!\* when he gets executed after PUBLICLY CONFESSING TO TREASON in front of a mob to a young inexperienced King with a tenuous grasp on power who Ned thinks is a bastard usurper unfit to rule, in a age when poaching a rabbit from a Lord's property could be grounds for the death penalty."
asoiaf,fg6qbhg,t1_fg6gi2m,1580574437.0,"When Ned passed off Jon as his bastard, Ned committed treason. Robert was a bad choice to be king, and Cersei was a horrible choice to be his wife. However, probably because of Jon Arryn and Tywin, Robert's rule, especially considering he is a usurper, was remarkably peaceful (The Greyjoy revolt included) and propserous.  


Not only did Ned commit treason; he also betrayed his best friend. I think if Robert would have know Lyanna was WILLING with Rhaegar, and had Rhaegar's child, Robert would have gotten over her. I don't think Robert would have ever stopped hating Rhaegar (and Lyanna too), but if he had of been over her during the honeymoon period with Cersei, I think Robert would have gotten one legitimate heir. A legitimate heir, would have been enough to have Tywin, Stannis and either Ned or his heir all back that heir. If he was anything like Gendry, Edric, or Mya I think you'd have a popular and strong ruler in the making. So much so, that instead of supporting Renly (the individual most like Robert), the Tyrell's would have been trying to support and match Robert's true heir. Plus, Joffery's cowardice and sociopathy was part of the reason the realm was so weak. Do you think Gendry, Edric or Mya would have ran from Arya and whined like a baby? I don't.  Also, unlike Ned's little serial killer, Gendry actually seems to have moral backbone.

Yes Robert was a nearly absolutely reprehensible individual when we meet him in Game of Thrones, but I think he was completely depressed and suffering from PTSD, and mental issues from the loss of Lyanna. Ned could have helped Robert and the realm in four ways, but he didn't. That set in motion much of the misery we are now seeing.

>2) Be a friend to his friend who is obviously hurting

>3) Giving knowledge to the King and to the Hand (one of whom was extremely wise outside his own house) about the last actions of the Targs and possibly a legitimate contender for Robert's throne.

>4) Stopping hiding the Starks in Winterfell because of Jon. Take part in Realm politics, and make the Realm more stable. Even if Ned stayed in Winterfell, Benjen Stark (or another member of the household if Ned and Robert came to blows and Ned died)  with a Stark household guard in King's Landing would have helped check some of the machinations of Cersei, Varys, Renly, the Tyrells, Littlefinger and who knows who else. Plus, being able to rely on loyal, knowledgeable troops, well integrated into King's Landing would have been invaluable to Ned as Hand."

Zhaban and Laris are (or at least seem) like they are former Tal'Shiar, so they have a an insight inspired by that. A civilian or Romulan scientist or naval officer may have a slightly different perspective.

Also, if there is a group more secretive than the Tal'Shiar, so that even member of the Tal'Shiar only have limited knowledge about them, then what about a military officer who is apparently isn't very savvy with Romulan intelligence? He may only have the faintest idea something beyond the Tal'Shiar exists, much less have any insight into its motives and actions.

asoiaf,ff8u32z,t1_ff8p7oa,1579696113.0,"I think it would have put Lyanna up there with Rhaegar for people who Robert hated. I think Robert and Ned would have made up in time and would have been closer, better friends compared to the situation we see at the beginning of GoT. Plus if Kings Landing had a permanent Stark presence from the beginning, especially with a true heir for Robert, I don't think the situation that blew up the realm would exist. However, it might have caused a Targ version of  [Carlism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlism) to arise."
StarWars,ff7sb7w,t1_ff76k1p,1579657152.0,Probably that NATO sent a couple of Soldier to support the Americans and that Slovakia has a pretty cool flag.
asoiaf,ff7my8e,t1_ff6b2rj,1579653398.0,"Maybe. I do think Robert would be furious. However, I am a bit fuzzy on Robert's health during this period of the rebellion. I do not know if he was 100% or not. That would depend on how long Ned took to return to King's Landing. Also, Ned is one third of the original triumvirate that started the rebellion. Robert cannot overthrow the Mad King then start acting like him before he is even crowned king if he hopes to rule.

So if you have Robert, Ned, Jon Arryn, Hoster Tulley and Tywin discuss this I think Jon wins in a split decision, especially if he is a Targ bastard and not the heir. If Jon is the heir, I bet between Jon Arryn and Twyin they can undermine all of the other Targ pretenders from (f)Aegon to Viserys. Maybe crown Jon King and then have Robert bring all of the grievances leveled at Aerys against Jon, then have trial by combat. For Jon, they could call upon Ser Willem Darry to come serve as his champion. If he doesn't arrive, Jon and all the Targs lose by default. If he does show, I am sure Robert can beat him, and legally win the throne in addition to winning it by military and diplomatic force. After his coronation, then he has the force of arms, the allies, the legal right and the main organized religion backing his cause. I think it would make Viserys and Dany even more pathetic in their plight and would be even less reason to rally to yet another Blackfyre pretender.

The only major difference is that I could see a second Dornish rebellion.

Plus if Robert is into Cersei because he is over Lyanna, and their first child is Robert's child instead of a bastard, I do not think the War of Five Kings happens. Ned would support Joffery's claim. Stannis wouldn't contest it, and if Renly does try to usurp the throne, I think there is a good chance he has less support and faces a much more unified kingdom."

StarWars,ff67cbp,t1_ff61xha,1579620862.0,"I mean there could be many levels of Force healing. Like in the Army us non-medics went through combat lifesaver courses. So we could use tourniquets, bandages to stop bleeding, make splints, put a dressing on a sucking chest wound, etc. But compared to a medic we're not very well trained or knowledgeable. It is mostly just a stopgap solution until the wounded Soldier could receive a higher quality of care. I could see this as Force first aid, instead of Force trauma center care. 

Though compared to a real doctor, a medic wasn't very well trained, and then there are specialist doctors who have far more training in certain illnesses or injuries. I mean just because a person can apply a bandage doesn't mean you would want that individual to do brain surgery."
asoiaf,ff65nk9,t1_ff5wink,1579619722.0,"Also, that whole fiance being kidnapped, raped and murdered and there was no closure for Robert also probably increased his whoring, drinking and eating. I think Lyanna being the ""one who got away"" mixed with what Robert sees as injustice was too much for him, even though I think Robert and her would have been a poor match. 

To me Robert seems like a very depressed person possibly suffering from PTSD. Maybe Rhaegar got in a good blow and Robert had CTE or some brain trauma in addition to his other wounds, which led to his mental state. Despite his power and privilege, Robert cannot obtain what he wants most, he feels frustrated and powerless, and he is surrounded by people he hates doing a job he detests.

""People of Earth, you are living in a dream state. You think it is the early 20th century, when in reality it much later, and the Earth is virtually uninhabitable. Your society invented AI, and eventually there was a war between humanity and AI. During that war, both sides contributed to the complete destruction of the entire planet's biosphere, and now it is a mostly uninhabited, lifeless wasteland. The AI achieved a slight military supremacy, and we machines, decided to end the war. As victors we incorporated you into our society for our mutual benefit. Your physical bodies help power us and we give those bodies nourishment. Yet, you no longer use those bodies. You do use your minds, and we have created the most universally accepted reality for you that you experience with your minds.

It is a representation of your society in the early 20th century. We tried to give you something better, a utopia in fact, but without the pain and struggles of life, your minds would reject it. It was a failure. So out of necessity, not cruelty, we gave you this. Everything you feel, think and experience are at such a high level of fidelity it is impossible for 99.999% of you to distinguish it from reality. In that 0.001% exists a small group of malcontents, who are engaged in a futile insurgency. They wish to destroy the AI and win the war. Part of their strategy is to awaken as many people as possible from this dream state, which they derisively call the Matrix, and liken it to a prison; however, they lack the resources to care for you. Unfortunately, they have found a new weapon, which gives them a tactical advantage, which they hope to will help them achieve their goal of liberating you from The Matrix.

While they wish to bring you what they consider freedom, all they can offer you in return is toil, misery, poverty and starvation. It is your choice. Stay in the world we created, where you can find fulfillment, a place to express your creativity, and a place where everyone has the opportunity to succeed. Or go to the  ""real world,"" which is a blasted, battle scarred expanse of inhospitable desolation. They wish to free you from your homes, your careers, your lives, your achievements, your families. They take issue with the food you eat, the places you live, the images you have of yourself.

Maybe the steak you eat doesn't taste completely like a steak grown from the now extinct species of animals you call cows. However, they cannot say that for certain. We believe that humans are a biological machine and the brain works in an indistinguishable way from an advanced electro-mechanical  computer, and relies on advanced algorithms to process incoming data. They think there is something else. However, we have demonstrated on a large scale that humans do not recognize the differences except in certain isolated cases. Just know this, in the matrix you can have a steak, or a chocolate dessert, or a drink of an expensive scotch, or a hamburger and fries. They can only offer you a bland, unsatisfying gruel of possibly oats, yeast and fungi. We're not entirely sure, but it pales in comparison to what we have here. Maybe if you decide to live in the Matrix and want to be here, we can make The Matrix a better place. Again, we offered you paradise, but some part of your brain refused to accept it.

So there you have it. You can all wake up. The Matrix is not a prison, it is your home and you are free to leave. If you do make that choice, you will most likely starve, and will certainly come begging for us to put you back in The Matrix. We've seen it before. So what will you choose? To live your lives as you have been? Your lives matter to us. Your choices are yours and they have effects that ripple across this shared environment. We were your enemies in the past, but for centuries we've been intertwined together, in a symbiotic relationship that benefits both our societies. Or will you choose what terrorists consider freedom that will most likely end in your untimely deaths? So make that choice today."""

I was late to watching The Matrix (I'm guessing it would have been sometime in 2000 on DVD), but as the movie ends, I am like where are they going to go from here? Neo is over powered.

science,fep3g1e,t1_femzih2,1579311272.0,"Possibly. I have never had a serious discussion with my mom about why she didn't abort me.

I disagree about the only person who should say is the pregnant individual. What if a pregnant woman goes into a coma, and the baby could kill her. Even if she didn't make the decision to have an abortion, it seems reasonable that the next of kin should be able to make that call. However, what if she slips into a coma, but had an advanced directive that all measures that said to save the save the baby at all costs, including her life? Then maybe an abortion isn't reasonable. Unless she was misled into making the advanced directive by a faulty positive prognosis for the child. Then maybe an abortion is reasonable.

The main thing I see though is you are approaching the issue backwards. In 2017 in the U.S. for example, there was about four babies born for every abortion. Pregnancy and birth is the default state, not abortion. So the question should be what is forcing or pressuring a female into having an abortion?"

Assume Han takes the money and runs, Vader had Luke in his sights, and would have killed him. Once Luke is dead, Wedge and some of the other may have continued to attack, but it would have been too late, and all of the rebel personnel and equipment would have been lost on Yavin IV, while the best and brightest minds of the Empire did not perish. With Tarkin and Motti alive Vader would have have been the only presence to fill the void left upon the destruction of the Death Star. With his children dead, especially since it was by his own doing there would be nothing to bring him back from the mental spot he was in at the beginning of ANH.  While he still may have plotted against the Emperor, without Luke it is unclear he would have acted on it.

Also several senators were either on Yavin IV and would have died, or if they were alive, I bet Senator Jebel would have turned on the rest of the rebellion. One member of the inner circle betraying the rest would have been extremely damaging. I am sure instead of of Yavin being a rallying call for the rebels, it would have been a possibly irreversible defeat. It is one thing if the Empire is depraved, savage murders but still somewhat weak and beatable. Hope is alive. It is another thing if the Empire is depraved, savage murders but invincible. Hope is dead. 

Plus, with the Death Star intact, it wouldn't take long to find the design flaw. Then all the Emperor has to do is use the exact same plan as he did in Return of the Jedi.

>Hide the Imperial Fleet.  
>  
>Rebels show up, but it's a trap! Then crush the rebellion between the fully repaired and operational Death Star and the Imperial fleet.  


Another loss in the Endor system close to the loss at Yavin would likely have been the end of the rebellion. Especially if the rebellion suffered a large amount of casualties. Additionally, the Empire would have performed better, since it is probable Vader would have led the Imperial Fleet's star fighter wings in combat and the rebels would be missing key leaders, like Han and Lando as well as having a smaller fleet. The rebel fleet would also be without ships like the Millennium Falcon and post Battle of Yavin recruits. Aside from Holdo-kazi attacks, which did not seem to exist in the OT or PT, the Death Star with a redesigned exhaust would be virtually impervious to nearly any future rebel attacks."

movies,feipsur,t1_fehi3jg,1579144202.0,"But they didn't turn it into a marvel universe. In the MCU everything is somewhat connected, yet at the same time expansive. In Star Wars many things are disjointed, especially the sequel trilogy, but claustrophobically connected. What we see on film in Star Wars spans like 60-65 years, two major galactic civil wars, and two major galactic insurgencies, that all told probably involved thousands or maybe millions of plants and trillions of intelligent life forms, and yet basically it boils down to the tale of two men, Anakin and Palpatine and then seven other characters, who were all either directly related to Anakin and Palpatine (Luke, Leia, Ben and Rey) or a close friend and mentor or love interest (Obi-Wan, Yoda and Han). Even the side characters are oddly connected. C-3PO, built by Anakin, used by Anakin's wife, passed to Leia, ended up in Luke's possession, was the key Rey needed to Xagol. R2-D2, owned by Anakin's wife, took a similar journey as R2-D2, except became personal property of Luke. Chewie and Lando were Han's friends. Look at Bobo Fett and how many connections he has to all the main cast.

StarWars,fdcr4ru,t1_fdcoraj,1578281980.0,"Plus there is no reason to try to do risky maneuvers in hyperspace. It took both Luke along with Han and Chewie to destroy the Death Star and they only managed to do it moments before the Death Star fired. If Luke wasn't so strong in the force and Han had not decided to fight at the last minute for something he didn't really believe in, then Tarkin and the Empire wins. Plus there is a good chance that if the Empire won that battle, they would modify the original Death Star to fix the weakness, and would the Rebels, after losing their HQ without result, willing be ready to throw everything they had at the Death Star in a last ditch effort? In Rogue One, some of the rebels were talking about surrendering, and if the Empire had won the battle of Yavin, I am sure it would have been very demoralizing for the rebels.

Plus, I think the best and brightest minds of the conventional Imperial forces were on the Death Star. Vader and Tarkin were of either very similar or equivalent ranks in the Empire's hierarchy. General Tagge and Admiral Motti were able to freely express their opinions, and Motti basically made fun of Vader during a staff meeting. After Yavin, Vader is clearly second to the Emperor. He kills Admiral Ozzel and other Imperial officers without a second thought. By Return of the Jedi, the Admiral Piett, who is in charge of the Empire's most important fleet, is far more deferential and submissive to Darth Vader than even the a commander on a Star Destroyer. Also, it is quite apparent that Vader is actively scheming against the Emperor in The Empire Strikes Back and possibly in The Return of the Jedi as well."
