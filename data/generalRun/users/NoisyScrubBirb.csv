Minecraftbuilds,ffeonc9,t3_et459t,1579857648.0,"Honestly I would go for something with a bit more contrast, I normally use stone brick to edge my roofs, but out of the woods I'd say go spruce, it's a nice contrast without being too out of place"
instantkarma,ffdk45a,t3_esx88i,1579822571.0,"Didn't they confirm there was no one in the thing and it was just an inflatable reacting to the static of his trolley thing? I can't remember where I saw it but tbh it makes sense cos the inflatable doesn't move right for a human, it seems to me at least"

How big is that tall area or us the whole map like that?"
DayofDragons,fezy9nb,t1_fezd6jo,1579463179.0,Yeee unfortunately I bought it through kickstarter so they said contact the studio about it and I really can't be arsed so I'm just gonna wait and see
DayofDragons,fey4cxd,t3_eqocvk,1579440723.0,"Honestly I uninstalled the game and left the discord after the whole thing with jao changing his name and pretending hes someone else.
I really hope that it turns out ok and all this settles down but in the meantime I'm annoyed I can't get a refund and rebut it later
Oh well we'll see what happens"
buildapc,fepsco8,t1_feps7do,1579329617.0,"Yeeee, as much as I'd like to go for this one, I've just had a look and I might risk paying more on Amazon for something that's definitely gonna work rather than fb"

howto,feifxwu,t1_feifre9,1579137611.0,What's a drop ceiling if you don't mind me asking? Can't say I've heard of it before
howto,feifppf,t1_feifb7y,1579137457.0,"That does like an idea, I do sleep with a white noise app on my phone and it generally does work, but cos the generator turns off sometimes it's either dead silent or deafening at night since I'm hyper sensitive to sounds. I might try and just turn my app up louder tonight, see if that helps"
howto,feiezdd,t3_epbpun,1579136965.0,"So yeah, I've moved flats recently since my old flatmates were arseholes and since I'm now on the top floor the extractor for the bathroom fans in the building is right above my small hallway bit by the door, it's not going all the time but when it does its bloody loud and keeps me up at night. I've spoken to the caretakers since they know me but they've said its unlikely they can do anything but if they can they will. I was thinking though, would the sound proof sponge tiles on the ceiling in the hallway bit work? Are they as effective of keeping sound out as they are keeping it in?"
