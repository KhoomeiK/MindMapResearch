dating_advice,fdf6qh4,t1_fdf5km1,1578354581.0,Sorry to hear that you feel that way. I hope you can work past this and find the love and relationship that you're looking for
offmychest,fdeatmf,t1_fde8bub,1578334973.0,"You genuinely have! I kid you not I just spoke to an advisor at a university in Toronto that I'm interested in and started working on my application. Thank you again for sharing your story, congratulations to you, and I wish you all the best in your academic journey!"
offmychest,fde144z,t1_fde0r12,1578328807.0,"Thanks, I appreciate that. Ironically the guy she's engaged to is someone she had cheated on her bf with, lol. I guess things will inevitably unfold at some point."
offmychest,fddzjvy,t3_eki8ru,1578327765.0,"This post inspired me to go back to college and finish my degree. Thank you, you're my hero!"
dating_advice,fdcl6p2,t1_fdc3i5j,1578277647.0,"Trust me, I understand what you mean. I went through the same -- I got so frustrated wondering why weren't other people seeing the things I valued in myself? I had to do some digging and realized that there was still a part of me that had my value rooted in my perceptions of what people think of me, as well as taking their actions (positive or negative) and directly relating that to my self-worth. I had to deprogram that kind of thinking entirely -- it's absolutely exhausting and makes anyone feel like they're endlessly spinning their wheels in this new-age ""dating world"", so to speak. In general, I stopped giving a shit about whether or not people see ""value"" in me, because I already see it in myself. I know that any person worth my time will see it too. At that point it made it really easy for me to weed through people who I felt were a waste of time, which gave me more time to work on myself and take my time getting to know the people who I think are worthwhile. It's a process for sure, but worth it -- in time more genuine people started to come into my life. I hope this resonates"
dating_advice,fdbuwh8,t1_fd6vv55,1578262355.0,"I disagree. To me, self-love is valuing yourself enough to know what you deserve, establishing healthy boundaries, and having enough confidence in yourself to not let the words or actions of others erode your self-esteem. I'm not perfect by any means, but when I started loving myself a bit more my perspective (and experience) on dating totally changed for the better."
chicago,fcv39l1,t1_fcuyy3t,1577993746.0,"I second what u/testspecimen85 said. After perusing on menus, looking at taxes, and seeing these long wait lines, it's just not worth it. Seems like folks are better off hitting up their usual plug -- less expensive, no taxes, and they (at least mine) deliver so no waiting out in the cold for hours."
chicago,fcupxya,t1_fcuf11u,1577986145.0,"By any chance do you know if they had any pre-rolls left at least? Also, how are the taxes? I heard they aren't as bad out of city limits"
chicago,fcupqm0,t1_fculgz5,1577986034.0,Bring cash to be safe
chicago,fcuplhk,t3_eiamtq,1577985954.0,Does anyone have an update on MedMen's line? I heard they're completely out of flower. Do they have a check-in system similar to Dispensary 33?
relationships,fcrsojb,t1_fcro3aj,1577906098.0,Fair point -- I think right now I need to distance myself because I'm already feeling really uncomfortable around him
relationships,fcrsjzz,t1_fcro5eh,1577906051.0,"It's not to boost my own ego -- I just wanted to be honest and transparent about what's going on because she's my friend. I will distance myself from him, though. He doesn't seem to be getting the hint"
relationships,fcrse7q,t1_fcrrwow,1577905990.0,Because he broke up with his gf of 6 years only to go after her BEST FRIEND days later. It's super messed up in my opinion and totally inconsiderate of her feelings and mine.
dating_advice,fc4qbeu,t1_fc2p82w,1577424581.0,"I always swipe left on guys with no bio. I could care less about attractiveness, if there's no bio it's an automatic no."
AmItheAsshole,f8thl61,t1_f8tcszb,1574803552.0,"Thank you! It's just inconsiderate to everyone else who showed up on time. And in certain events where we start without them, they'll get upset about it because they were ""left out"". You wouldn't be left out if you showed up on time!"
