AskWomenOver30,ffktu4z,t3_eu0lox,1580028758.0,"Maybe figure out the source of your stress and see if you can outsource it?

No time to clean? Look into having someone come in and do the bathroom/floors/etc. once or twice a month. Buy another set of work or workout clothes so you don’t need to do laundry mid-week. 

Errands? Pay a little extra for services to pick up/drop off dry cleaning, groceries, drug store items., etc. Use online shopping to the fullest. Get meal delivery kits.

Drive time, parking, remembering to pack a bag making it too stressful to hit the gym after work? Try finding a club closer to your home/work, videos/online workouts you can do at home, invest in a piece of cardio equipment.

Vacations? Use a travel planner. Go on a tour. Copy the itinerary and recommendations from Rick Steeves.

Friends? Invite them over. Order pizzas, toss a salad kit, have other “open and go” convenience foods, use disposable items. Tell them to bring drinks. Or, go out and do family style so check is evenly split. 

Meditation? There’s free online guided meditation, or practice deep breathing. Start with 1 minute timed on your phone, get comfy, and just take deep breaths. Try to clear your mind. Work up to 5, 10, 15 minutes. Honestly? Walking is meditative for me. I focus on the rhythm my footsteps makes, and my breath naturally follows. 

These are just some ideas, but you catch my drift. Sometimes paying a little extra for convenience can really save your sanity and improve your quality of life. Hopefully this helps. 

Good luck!"

AskWomen,ffituy0,t3_etn8am,1579982583.0,"I used to think having a “strong personality” was the polite way of saying someone was being loud, overbearing, and aggressive. I’m pretty much the complete opposite of that, so it shocked me when a higher-up manager said I had one during a review. My surprise showed on my face, so he explained how he noticed I was kind of an emotional litmus test for our department. Even though I’m not a team lead and am typically very quiet, he said my moods noticeably affected my coworkers. If I was happy, the team generally was happy and more talkative/engaged. If I was out sick, the team was more subdued. If I was angry, the team was a little fiestier. 

I had a doctor’s appointment and missed the first half of a meeting he sat in. But when I came in, he said the team gave off a noticeably different energy. People were sitting up more, smiling more, more engaged, even though I was quiet during most of it. I felt kind of awkward when he pointed this out to me later. I don’t want my emotions to be that easy to read. I don’t want to feel responsible for my coworkers’ moods. So, I initially thought this awareness kind of sucked.

A few weeks later, I was out of office for 2 weeks. When I returned, people expressed the typical “glad you’re back” sentiments, but a couple of our clients added things like, “the meetings always seem to go better when you’re here” and “your team must really like you. They seemed a little bummed while you were out!” I’d normally write it off as lip service, but it struck differently. Now, I’m kind of keen to look into how I might develop this into a tool in work/life, like a subtle super power. My direct boss is already asking me to sit in on more meetings, which is great in terms of learning more and my career development...but also makes me wonder if he just sees me as a good luck charm.

So, my definition of “strong personality” has slightly changed to something akin to “influencer”. Someone who can affect people, whether knowingly, or in my case, unknowingly."

onebag,ffil6tj,t1_ffiemtk,1579976517.0,"I had stickler Ryanair personnel make me check a bag once.

It fit and compressed down, but they still told me it needed to be checked. Would have totally done it completely different given a second chance, but that’s how we learn. 

My advice: Don’t get a bigger bag and expect to squish it down. Even if it fits, they might think it’s too tight and force you to check it.

Also, double-check your bag dimensions after you stuff it full in case the fabric bulges/stretches out.

nutrition,ffbnb2i,t3_eslrag,1579773958.0,"My typical weekly routine:
- Steam dozen eggs (“hard boiled”, but made in a steamer), prep Sunday

My rarer “got plenty of time to meal prep” routine:
- Veggie frittata. Either eaten as-is or as a breakfast sandwich filling with ham between toast
- “energy bites”. Basically a base of mashed up dates plus whatever goodies, stashed in the freezer. I like adding peanut butter, chopped walnuts, and mini chocolate chips.

I like things I can make ahead of time and that are portable so mornings are a bit easier. 

Regarding smoothies—I love ‘em as much as the next person, but I don’t drink them with breakfast. I don’t live alone in a house, so I’d be a jerk waking up roommates or neighbors at 6am with the blender. Batch prepping and freezing doesn’t work for me either since I’ve found that only all-fruit smoothies were palatable. Anything with yogurt or nut milk separates and creates an unappealing texture upon thawing; and the freeze/thaw seems to make spinach taste more pronounced, which I don’t like.

Ask your uncle’s doctor for a letter explaining the severity of the case as a backup.

It sounds like it’s just been some caught looks, but no actual talking so far. And working in a more formal environment or place with stricter departmental divides could be a big obstacle outside of your control.

If you don’t know him at all, my suggestion is to just open the door, let him know you’re available for talking. This could just be a smile next time you catch his looks, a “good morning” next time one of you walks by the other. Introducing yourself next time you’re both in the office kitchen making coffee. If you have a question for someone in his department, use the excuse of “oh, hey, do you know where Person sits?” as an opener. And then it’s on him to continue, or not. If he doesn’t give you a “good morning” or initiate conversation next time you see each other, he’s likely not interested. 

Since it’s a work situation, keep your professionalism and take things super slow. Use your workplace as a way to get to know him without making any kind of commitment. Once you’ve actually had a chance to see what kind of personality he has, you should be able to make a reasonable assumption about his character. 

Honestly, no one but the rudest and most immature person would string you along just as a joke. I work in a male-dominated field and have seen up close how they act. A little insensitive sometimes? Sure. But douchey enough to pull that crap? Rarely, and they stand out like a sore thumb.

foodhacks,ff8ptkv,t3_es5wnx,1579690891.0,"Well, positive side:
- Yay! Hopefully you’ll feel oodles better, and just from avoiding certain foods. You don’t need pills/medicine!
- There are SO MANY awesome foods you can eat that still fit the bill! Avoiding wheat? Okay—carb out on rice, beans, potatoes, other grains! What? No fruit or vegetable or meat restrictions? So many smoothies and bowls of guacamole and grilled steaks in your future!
- There are SO MANY gluten-free and dairy-free alternatives available these days! Nut milks, cashew cheeses, coconut ice cream and yogurt! Yam noodles, soba noodles, zoodles, chickpea and rice pastas! GF bread, waffles, cookies, cakes, crackers, pizza crust, soy sauce! You don’t necessarily need to change what you cook, just make the necessary substitutions!
- There are SO MANY restaurants and products these days which label what is GF, vegan, etc. that you can walk into any restaurant or grocery store and find great-tasting prepared food that works for you!

Basically, rather than focus too much on what you can’t eat, try to focus on everything that you can. Start with your average week of food and list out your typical breakfasts, lunches, dinners, snacks, desserts, etc. You can probably keep most, if not all, of your favorite foods/recipes, just with some slight variations.

solotravel,ff8k0tx,t3_es572e,1579682129.0,"See if there’s an “Eat With”-type class nearby! I’ve done a couple and really enjoyed them. Not only do learn how to make the food, but it’s in a more relaxed atmosphere inside the host’s home and winds up feeling like a dinner party/extended family get together. You mingle while prepping the food, have group discussion while eating  together around the table, chat while helping clean up. It’s really catered to those who wish to be more social and meet new people. Comparatively, I’ve sometimes found it difficult to meet people on food/walking tours, especially if I’m the only solo traveler. Others can be more focused on learning/tasting/seeing instead of mingling.

Having said that, please also consider looking into the different hostel/AirBnB options on your next trip, since many do offer similar “creature comforts”, but with the added bonus of more social interaction. And, yes, hostels do seem to be mostly 20-30’s, but (a) I’ve also seen families and retirees and (b) don’t be ageist, since many might have the same interests as you.

I’ve done some longer solo trips abroad and have found that renting a room via AirBnB or staying in a hostel has been the best bet for me in regards to making deeper connections just because I get more face time with people.

I do my research, though. I try to stay with singles or couples who speak some English, and are only renting out one room. Or, with hostels, I either try for singles or 4-bed female dorms with bathroom en suite. Best bet either case has been to hang out in the dining area and strike up conversations during meals.

(Also, slightly tangential, but I like to carry a notebook with me when I travel. “Life” keeps me so busy that solo travel gives me the time to really appreciate what I’m experiencing and offers long moments of self-reflection. It’s nice to be able to write it down and capture those insights, moods, descriptions. I also try to capture the smaller day-to-day things that I’d like to share with my friends and family back home. The name of a peculiar local cheese I tried or how my host’s ivy plant invaded every single room in her apartment. Somehow, it feels a little less lonely thinking about telling it to someone.)

PlusSizeFashion,ff8aafg,t3_es6b4z,1579670719.0,"Firstly, just gonna say that you should wear what you’re comfortable in. Confidence is key. No need to flash a lot of skin or anything skin-tight to project “foxy lady”. If you feel cute and confident in it, you’ll project those vibes.

I dress relatively conservatively/preppy, but I like to be subtly sexy by wearing clothes that cater to my shape and play off the assets I like to focus on. I’ve also figured out what colors look good on me and make me happy. Perhaps that could be a starting point for you. 

- Figure out what shape you are, and then look up style tips for it. Use those suggestions to modify your existing closet and keep it in mind the next time you shop for clothes. Maybe it’s adding a thick belt onto your dress to define your waist, adding on a long scarf to create vertical lines, wearing the same color top and bottom for flow. Try different things and start training your eye for what looks good >>on you<<.

- Quality undergarments. I know some people have strong opinions about shapewear, but if it makes you feel more confident wearing that dress/skirt/whatever, do it! 

- If you’re not comfortable showing skin in public, consider some cute lingerie sets. Tease your husband with the thought that underneath your oversized sweater or jeans, you’re wearing something really hot that only he gets to see. Also, consider fabric choice. A soft and fuzzy sweater, velvet skirt, or silky blouse might spark a desire for him to get handsy. ;)

- If you are comfortable with showing off more skin, what area/s do you love most about yourself and want to highlight? A long sleeve, high-neck shirt with cold shoulders is sexy just for that little flash of skin. Maybe v-necks for a hint of cleavage, tucking in your shirt to show off your booty, high-low maxi to show off dem legs.

- Determine your complexion’s “season” for a start on what colors will look good on you, and think about the colors you feel really happy in. What color sets off your eyes? Wear more of those colors! Consider using those as a basis for a capsule wardrobe, sticking to just a few neutrals, a couple main, and an accent. 

- A capsule wardrobe has helped me curb spending and cluttering up my closet (less fast fashion, bold prints, impulse buys; more quality purchases that I really love and look forward to wearing), reduced stressful “but I have nothing to wear” scenarios (since everything pairs well with each other), and allowed me to invest in some nice accessories (I don’t feel bad buying the nice earrings or fancy purse because I can wear them every day, with any outfit, and they’ll last for decades). It’s not for everyone, but it really helped me be more critical about my clothing choices in terms of fit, function, and color. I would often buy things simply because Wow! It’s on sale and my size! (22W-24W) but that led to a stuffed closet of things I wasn’t thrilled with because they didn’t flatter me. 

Sorry for the long post, but I’ve been in a similar boat and just wanted to drop all the things that helped me out.

Best of luck!"

We all have a few regrets, but we can’t change what happened. We can only grow from those experiences and move on, or else waste energy on things that can’t be helped. Getting stuck living in the past while life continues on won’t make you happier in the future.

The yolks do hold the saturated fat, but also half the egg’s protein, almost all of its vitamins/minerals, and Omega 3’s per this article. Besides, it’s so much cheaper to buy whole eggs v. a carton of whites (at least at my grocery store), and it’s not as wasteful as tossing the yolks. 

Just an internet stranger’s opinion, but I think whole eggs, like anything, are probably just fine in moderation."

budgetfood,ff2mltu,t3_er5z7f,1579513474.0,"I second “ethnic” markets for cheap, good quality produce, and maybe some fun finds!

I have mixed feelings about Walmarts. Been to a couple which had a large selection of good-looking fresh produce, but also quite a few that basically only had green bananas and red “delicious” apples. If yours has everything you need for weekly shopping, great! Otherwise, seems like a waste of time to battle the Walmart parking lot and temptation of unnecessary side purchases, just to go to another grocery store later.

But, what really helped my budget was looking at what I was buying (at grocery stores and eating out) and assessing it for improvement.

1. What am I spending the most money on? Meats and cheese are usually my most expensive groceries, so I try to eat less of them and get my protein via eggs, canned tuna, plant-based proteins (tofu, rice ‘n’ beans, quinoa, etc).

2. Is there a difference in quality/taste between name brand and store brand for products I typically purchase? I want to save $ where possible, but without compromising taste. So, for example, I purchase Kerrygold butter only when I have company—for their toast, warm bread, baked potatoes, etc., but the store brand goes in baked goods. What I can buy in bulk, I typically do—nuts, chia seeds, rice, beans, spices.

3. What “convenience food” am I buying that can be made cheaper at home? When I eat out, it’s mostly at Mexican restaurants. So, I try to meal prep more Mexican dishes to avoid the cravings, or have ingredients on hand at home. I’ve also started making salad dressing, dips, sauces, pizza dough, pesto, ice tea, etc. because it is pretty easy and doesn’t involve much labor. But I still buy riced cauliflower and OJ because I ain’t got time for that.

4. What’s on sale this week, and how can I include it in my meal planning? This is mainly so nothing goes to waste (looking at you, slimy cilantro), but also lowering the price per meal."
AskFeminists,ff2h4yp,t3_er6wkk,1579505907.0,"Depends on the day/setting. Mostly just a flip-off if I have places to be. But sometimes I just stop and yell as loudly as possible, “NO! STOP! DON’T DO THAT! STOP!” a few times while pointing at them. They want attention? They got the whole street watching them now. 

But anyone else see that brief clip from some (South American?) tv show where they had cat callers’ moms dressed up in disguise walk by their boys? The boys would unknowingly cat call/harass their own moms, then the moms would take off their wigs/glasses and just give ‘em hell. Guys usually instantly showed contrition and apologized. 

Funny how mothers can be “holy” figures, daughters and sisters can be “virtuous” figures, but a woman in public is sexualized."
