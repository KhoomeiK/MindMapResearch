I always thought legends like Kobe were immortal and that we would hear their hall of fame speeches, see them in various league events, teaching the next generations.  Most importantly, watching Kobe on tv calling the rookies soft!

However. We have a freedom of speech and you are stating the truth in your reviews, they can’t silence you. They can bully you all they want, but they’d be stupid to actually pursue legal action against you. If they did, contact the media and they will disappear fast!

personalfinance,fdkhn9k,t3_elshda,1578504062.0,"(In canada), is the 20% guideline actually true? my wife and i use the same credit card account, we regularly spend up to 60% of the limit but pay off balance when they are due.  Our individual credit scores are well in the 800 according to the credit score service provided by our bank. 

so i'm not sure if the 20% guideline is true or if having multiple cards will help.  But in general, dont be afraid to take out loans, just as long as you can afford it and never miss a payment is a good formula to having good credit scores."
