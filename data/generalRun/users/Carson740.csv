Anxiety,fdpub5z,t3_emmt92,1578640778.0,"Be with friends. Breakups are hard as hell, and from past experience the thing that has helped me the most were friends. 

Friends don’t even have to be by your side. It could be through a video game, or a discord friend, or any way that you can take your mind off of her.

When I left my first girlfriend for being emotionally abusive, it helped to go to school the next day, and just talk with some friends. Not even about her, but just to talk to friends. It helped to hop onto a minecraft server and work on a project with someone. Distract yourself from her, and don’t contact her. The pain will go away, you just have to give it time. I’m sorry you’re going through this, but it will get better soon, believe me."
depression,fdptuc6,t3_emnff1,1578640241.0,"I understand your position. It’s hard to imagine that life can be good after it’s been so bad for so long, but that’s not true. Life has ups and downs, a lot of downs, but the ups are what make it worth it. Take a second to just breathe, and focus on it. Don’t think about anything else, just breathe. When you feel like you’ve calmed down enough, think about what it is in life that’s good for you right now. Now what can you do to enjoy it the best you can? Don’t miss out on something good because you’re worried it won’t be here forever, because the truth is it might not be, but you have it right now, so make the most out of it and be thankful for the time you have with it, regardless of if it’s going to go away or stay forever.

Head, neck, shoulders, arms, chest, legs, feet, focus on them as you relax them. Now breathe. In, and out. In, and out. Think about something that makes you happy. You like to hike? Imagine yourself doing that right now, looking into the world and seeing everything it has to offer. What’s there? Squirrels? Birds? What are they doing? What sounds do they make? Keep breathing, and let your mind drift to a happy place."
Anxiety,fdpt0tg,t1_fdprlnm,1578639328.0,"It made my anxiety more manageable while I was on it, but only with the help of coping techniques as well. I still had anxiety while I was on it, just not as badly as before. I was still depressed, but it became easier to fight back with it. I used it as a tool to help me learn how to combat these weaker versions of my demons, so that when they eventually grew larger, I would have a bigger arsenal. Like I said before, when I straight up quit it was hard as hell, I was really fucked up and to add onto that I had my anxiety and depression back in full force. It was a very rough time, but so long as you do follow your doctors orders and wean off of it, you’ll be spared the struggle I had to go through for being irresponsible. After the withdrawal calmed down, I was able to combat my demons. It’s definitely not cured, but it’s so much better than where I was when I was 15. 

The main goal of this medication is to make it easier to manage your anxiety/depression once you get off. It’s not meant to be used forever, it won’t work forever. So yes, it did make my anxiety more manageable so I could learn how to combat it when I got off

Anxiety,fdprgj8,t3_emkwtp,1578637670.0,"Girlfriend of two years deciding whether or not she wants to be with me. I love her to death, but it’s hard as hell to love someone with everything you have and not be shown that love back. I miss it a lot, I just want to hold her again."
Anxiety,fdpra4w,t3_emmilp,1578637486.0,"I’ve been prescribed Zoloft since I was about 15, and I probably stopped taking it completely around 17. I’m 19 now. Around this time, I was also on Concerta for ADD, so my mileage may be a tad different due to that. 

To be completely honest with you about my experience with it: it wasn’t bad. I was prescribed it, and told that it might take a couple of weeks for it to actually take effect if I took it daily like I was supposed to, and I found that they were right about that. I was a Sophomore in High School by this time so the real test was getting through the school days without being anxious about everything.

I was started on I think 25mg, then 50mg, and eventually 100mg. 25 helped, but I could still feel it coming on and it was still hard to control. I kept telling my doctor that, and he kept bumping me up. Eventually I quit cold turkey, which I can recommend you NOT DO. I suffered from some hallucinations, felt extremely sick to the point that I kept leaving school early, and it just wasn’t a good time all around. Please make sure not to quit without weaning off of it. It won’t kill you, but damn it isn’t a fun time. 

I’m fortunate enough now to not be taking any medications, even though there’s times when I probably should be. I didn’t really have any bad experiences while I was ON Zoloft, only when I just straight up quit. When I did quit, though, it was when I was comfortable enough to. I didn’t feel the need for it anymore, and that’s the entire point of you only being on it for 6 months. Use it as a tool to take control of your anxiety. Let it help you, but you have to do the work to maintain your strength, which is what you’ll be doing as you’re weaned off of it. I was stupid and quit without a doctor’s help, and it messed me up, but I’m lucky enough to have been in a place in life where I had learned how to combat my anxiety and depression, so once the withdrawal was over, I felt so much better.

TL;DR

I used Zoloft, didn’t have bad experiences until I quit cold turkey. Hallucinations and flu like symptoms due to that. After the withdrawal, I felt better and more in control. It’s not going to fix your problems, in the same way a hammer won’t build a shed. It’s a tool to work with while you find your own ways to combat your anxiety. When you’re being weaned off, which I believe it always the end goal, that’s when you’re going to be using those skills the most to battle your demons, but it’ll be so worth it in the end. I’m grateful for the help I had, I just wish I was smarter and more responsible with it, I urge you to be better than I was.

I believe in you, you’ve got this. If you have a counsellor/therapist, ask them about ways to combat anxiety. If you don’t, there are so many resources online it’s astonishing. Practice, and you’ll be better off as you’re being weaned off"

admincraft,fdjbwy2,t1_fdjap42,1578464673.0,"I think there’s still this idea that minecraft servers can still run on very low powered hardware, and that just unfortunately isn’t the case anymore. Servers require a lot more resources nowadays due to unoptimized chunk loading, new villager AI, and other stuff Mojang just doesn’t seem to want to bother working on.

There was definitely a time when you could run a minecraft server on an old computer and it would be just fine. I used to run a Hexxit server for me and a few friends off an old Compaq Presario CQ57, and it was perfectly fine. It wasn’t perfect, but it suited our needs and that’s all that mattered. Now if I tried to run vanilla 1.14/1.15 on that same hardware, I’m certain it would be a disaster. 

My point in saying all that is, nobody coming into the server space is wrong for thinking that it doesn’t require powerful hardware, because at one time that was completely true. It’s just that these last few versions have been so terribly optimized, that it just isn’t true *now*. Maybe one day Mojang will better optimize server performance so we can get back to those days, but I’m not holding my breathe"
