You should only use Zopiclone intermittently though. It builds tolerance and is habit forming."

AskMen,fes23d1,t3_eqev1u,1579360625.0,We met at a party at the local BDSM community. Apparently she saw me at the last party and didn't dare aproach me because she found me so hot. But this time she got the nerve up and we started talking. I left a bit before her and sent her a message on Fetlife. We ended up talking until 5 am or something. The next day we met up at a munch and I had her in ropes within the hour. That was almost eight months ago and she's sitting here besides me in the sofa.

2: Was put on Effexor some years before I was diagnosed. It fucked me up. Like really fucked me up. Worst episode of my life. Never again. Since then I've been very sceptical about SSRIs and SNRIs.

At the moment I'm only on Lamictal 100mg AM and PM as well as Valium and Zopiclone ""as needed"". I try to not use those more than necessery. Lamictal works for me. Sort of. It makes my depressive episodes fewer and less intense, but they're still there. If an episode gets really bad I have Quetiapine that helps during the worst periodes. But the side effects are bad for me, so I only use that if I really need it."
