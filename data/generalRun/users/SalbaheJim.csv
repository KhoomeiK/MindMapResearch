AskReddit,feboy6y,t3_eo83cx,1578961143.0,"If it were generally accepted that it makes no difference what gender you were born with physically, then telling your partner would likely be considered a matter of personal preference.

As our society does care about gender, any misrepresentation of your condition, whether born to it or surgically altered to it, should be disclosed to your partner.  There are a significant number of people who still see gender change as abhorrent and disguising.  A misrepresentation prior to, during, or after intercourse can be seen as a perversion and possibly as rape of your partner is normally unwilling to voluntarily have intercourse with someone they see as being of a gender to which they are not attracted.  People have assaulted and killed sexual partners who represented themselves as a gender attractive to their partners only to have it found later that they were once a different gender.

Deceit and bigotry can lead to tragedy and any good relationship must be founded on honest and open communication.  If you tell your partner that you're transgender and they reject you, it's best to know as early as possible rather than after a large emotional investment is made or physical relationship is developed.

Don't hide who you are and please keep in mind that, while our society is slowly becoming more accepting of gender identity and the LGBTQ+ community as a whole, not everyone is on board or accepting.  It's too easy to get hurt if you hide who and what you are, including your past, from those you care about."
