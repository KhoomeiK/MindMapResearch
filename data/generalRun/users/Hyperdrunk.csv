This year in the NFL the 49ers and Seahawks played the final game.  Winner won the NFC West and got to play at home in the playoffs, loser had to go in as a Wildcard.  We knew both were going to the playoffs regardless, but it wasn't a boring or meaningless game.  It was exciting and intense.

A+ Physical Skills

C- Decision Maker  
C- Accuracy Under Pressure  

As a person, you absolutely love him in your locker room.  A good person, leader, mature, focused.  He's got all the physical tools to be an elite QB, and can make every throw you ask him to make.  

However he's only decent at moving in the pocket, reading the field, and delivering the football to the right guy.  In a vacuum he's a fantastic QB, because if you look at him on the practice field you'll see him dropping back and delivering a 50 yard strike with pinpoint accuracy; however you see less and less of that in real games.

I think you're right, that someone will fall in love with him.  He's an A+ interview and will cause a GM to say ""this is the kind of guy that I want as the face of the franchise.""  He'll go out there in his workouts and deliver perfect strikes and all the Coaches say ""this guy's a stud!""

At the next level he'll need a coaching staff that will work on him being able to put it together on the field.  Being able to throw accurately to the right target when he's got a pocket collapsing around him."

nfl,ff08qnz,t1_fezt41s,1579466386.0,"Doing this could result in you guys not drafting a QB this year, having Fitz and Rosen as your QBs again next year.

This year fans had that goofy ""we know we suck, we're gonna load up and rebuild!"" energy... but a second year of that and the fans won't seem so light hearted about it.

Plus, you guys traded away a franchise LT and a starting CB... if you turn around and draft an OT and CB with 2 of your 3 1st round picks, and don't get a QB out of it, it'll feel a lot less genius.

So while a sacrifice of a 2nd 1st might suck for you guys, if it ensures your franchise QB you have to do it.

If the Chargers & Panthers both trade up in front of 5 for Tua & Herbert, an unlikely but possible outcome, you'll end up sitting at 5 looking at whether you want to draft a CB or an OT."

news,feuoncb,t1_feubl29,1579388537.0,"Historically speaking Nuns abused girls and Priests abused boys.  This same gender abuse was largely opportunity based within the Catholic church as Nuns ran all-girls schools, including boarding schools when they were in vogue, and were charged with producing compliant Catholic women ready to obey their husbands; and Priests had a constant stream of local boys serving under them as Altar boys within the Parish.  So Priests had young boys under their authority, and Nuns had young girls under their authority.  Hence the same-gender abuse and cover ups.

As time and society progressed the all-girls Catholic schools ran by Nuns fell out of favor, so most of their abuse (while well known) lacks documentation.  Meanwhile Altar Boys are still a thing within the Catholic Church today.  

My Aunt went to a Catholic school that had Corporal Punishment (bare-bottom spankings with instruments) by the Nuns as a matter of policy, and further abuse beyond that.  She has scars on her legs and butt from the whippings, and she tells of other abuse she endured such as one of the Nuns twisting her (and other girls) nipples until they cried and begged forgiveness if they were caught wearing underwear to school that was ""provocative"", being forced to strip to her underwear in front of the Nuns, being verbally called ""Sluts"" and ""whores"" by the nuns (Verbal harassment), and so on.  It's so embedded into her mentality that she doesn't really connect it to being sexual abuse, but rather just the way Catholic School was for girls in the 1960s.

These days, the jokes revolve around the more modern scandal with more documented proof of abuse.  Priests and Altar Boys.  I wish there was more documentation of what the Catholic Church did to girls as well.

--------

The more you look into the Catholic Church the more it's hard to believe it wasn't completely rejected by society.  My Aunt ended up marrying an abusive (Catholic) man and staying with him for 40 years because it was what she was supposed to do.  What she was trained to do by the Church.  It's so gross and disgusting that her life was essentially wasted because she happened to be Catholic."

news,fecwuum,t1_feb2lml,1578987827.0,"This is going to sound horribly elitist, but I'm going to say it anyway because it's true.

I used to drive an SUV for a Limo company.  I drove NBA players, local politicians, businessmen, people who were spending more than they should on anniversary nights out with their spouse, bachelor/ette parties, and proms.  I made between $100 and $300 a night and got to pick which nights I worked. 

It wasn't insane money, but about $1,000 a week on average.  The clients were always a little condescending, but because I wore a black suit and tie, acted professionally and courteously, and treated everyone respectfully they were mostly pretty kind and respectful and tipped well.

If you're going to drive, go that route.  Dealing with the type of people looking for the cheapest ride possible is going to result in a lot of assholes.  People looking to do things on the cheap are, for whatever reason, insanely entitled and bitchy to the people helping them.  Paying $13 for a ride and giving someone a 1 star review because their car was 2 degrees colder than you prefer or they didn't have a charge cable for you is some absolute bullshit.  They'll bitch about their boyfriend ""cheating"" on them while sending selfies to other guys and then act like you sexually assaulted them for glancing in the rear view.  It's ridiculous.  Seriously, why put up with it?

If you need the extra cash, whatever, but seriously just drive for a Limo company instead.  It took $100 in my city to get a license to drive others and the company I worked for paid for half of it.  Then the suit, shirts, and tie were on me, so it was an investment of sorts, but seriously, I was making nearly what I make now as a working professional and people who pay for an Exec SUV don't treat you like shit.  Like I said, a little condescending, but mostly pretty good.  Plus it can be fun to drive around minor celebrities, politicians, athletes, etc.  I'm not the sort of dude to be star struck or anything, so it was fun to joke around with people you see on TV (if they started the convo, never start the convo yourself).  

I don't get Uber driving.  I mean, I get it if you're literally just picking up some cash to make ends meet.  But I don't get it as a long-term choice.  Go a little bit higher class and drive for a Limo company instead.  

---------

Best tips, BTW, were Prom party parents when you delivered their kids home before midnight.  Half the reason parents hired me to drive their kids was because I was on a set schedule and would let them know if I was going to be late.  They were so so happy when their little ""Innocent"" kid came home before midnight without having sex on Prom night that they'd tip $100 on top of my rate almost every time, sometimes more. 

And since it's an Escalade, not an actual Limo, it's not like the teens were trying to hook up in the back anyway.  Occasionally they'd make out and the guy would try and feel the girl up a bit and/or she'd get a little handsy down south, but no one was having sex in the back seat while I drove and could see.  

Proms were the best.  Drive to the restaurant, drop off, park, wait and read a book for half an hour.  Take them to the dance, drop off, park and wait a couple hours, keep reading your book, take them home, drop off, and then you're done. Make $200-$300 and the most you had to deal with was an 18 year old asking you why he can't smoke ($500 immediate fee for their parents if they do). 

---------

I'm an adult with a real job now, but if you're going to drive, I really suggest looking into this.  I miss the easy money of driving proms, weddings, wine tours, etc.  It's 90% reading a book or listening to the radio and 10% making idle conversation and joking around with a passenger.  Boring, but profitable.  

Yet you have Uber drivers driving their own car, dealing with people who will argue over $1 more than they expected on their ride, and a review system where they punish you for shit that's not your fault.

Why are you dealing with that bottom tier shit?"

Conservative,fd7jrkp,t1_fd5x2wv,1578205603.0,"There's a a few things to unpack in the post above.

One, you are correct, that we need dramatically fewer human bodies to fight a war now than we used to.  Technological advances mean that many, if not most, duties and roles in the military have been automated since WW2, or even since Vietnam, and a good bit since the Gulf.  We used fewer than 200K troops in the entire Iraq invasion in 2003.  We used more than 250K troops on D-day alone in WW2.  

We simply don't have rows of men heading into the meat grinder like we did 80 years ago.  

---------

The second thing to unpack is physical fitness.  America is very sadly very overweight.  Roughly 3/4 (71%)^^^[\[1\]](https://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/the-recruitment-problem-the-military-doesnt-want-to-talk-about/)  of 18 year olds are unfit for service for a variety of reasons, but mainly due to weight.  Also due to criminal history, intelligence, and so on.  But for America it's a weight issue.

This isn't a Liberal vs Conservative issue.  [If you look at a map](https://i.imgur.com/S7bV6NN.jpg), Childhood Obesity isn't focused in Liberal States nor Conservative States.  

-----

This third and last thing is that if a draft is ever necessary, we'll have a lot bigger problems than politics.  We'll be united.  Because the only way we'll ever reach the point that we NEED a draft is if there is such a massive, catastrophic war that no one will be opposed to it.  I'm not talking about another invasion of another desert country.  Like I said in point #1, fighting a war of this nature doesn't require as many people as before.

After 9/11 we had lines of people being turned away by the military.  If we get attacked in a major way, people will turn out to volunteer again.  After that, if we STILL need to have a draft, then we're in such a world of shit that it's not going to be a political issue of Liberals vs Conservatives.

As a person, you absolutely love him in your locker room.  A good person, leader, mature, focused.  He's got all the physical tools to be an elite QB, and can make every throw you ask him to make.  

However he's only decent at moving in the pocket, reading the field, and delivering the football to the right guy.  In a vacuum he's a fantastic QB, because if you look at him on the practice field you'll see him dropping back and delivering a 50 yard strike with pinpoint accuracy; however you see less and less of that in real games.

I think you're right, that someone will fall in love with him.  He's an A+ interview and will cause a GM to say ""this is the kind of guy that I want as the face of the franchise.""  He'll go out there in his workouts and deliver perfect strikes and all the Coaches say ""this guy's a stud!""

So while a sacrifice of a 2nd 1st might suck for you guys, if it ensures your franchise QB you have to do it.

This same gender abuse was largely opportunity based within the Catholic church as Nuns ran all-girls schools, including boarding schools when they were in vogue, and were charged with producing compliant Catholic women ready to obey their husbands; and Priests had a constant stream of local boys serving under them as Altar boys within the Parish.  So Priests had young boys under their authority, and Nuns had young girls under their authority.  Hence the same-gender abuse and cover ups.

As time and society progressed the all-girls Catholic schools ran by Nuns fell out of favor, so most of their abuse (while well known) lacks documentation.  Meanwhile Altar Boys are still a thing within the Catholic Church today.  

My Aunt went to a Catholic school that had Corporal Punishment (bare-bottom spankings with instruments) by the Nuns as a matter of policy, and further abuse beyond that.  She has scars on her legs and butt from the whippings, and she tells of other abuse she endured such as one of the Nuns twisting her (and other girls) nipples until they cried and begged forgiveness if they were caught wearing underwear to school that was ""provocative"", being forced to strip to her underwear in front of the Nuns, being verbally called ""Sluts"" and ""whores"" by the nuns (Verbal harassment), and so on.  It's so embedded into her mentality that she doesn't really connect it to being sexual abuse, but rather just the way Catholic School was for girls in the 1960s.

These days, the jokes revolve around the more modern scandal with more documented proof of abuse.  Priests and Altar Boys.  I wish there was more documentation of what the Catholic Church did to girls as well.

The more you look into the Catholic Church the more it's hard to believe it wasn't completely rejected by society.

news,fecwuum,t1_feb2lml,1578987827.0,"This is going to sound horribly elitist, but I'm going to say it anyway because it's true.

I used to drive an SUV for a Limo company.  I drove NBA players, local politicians, businessmen, people who were spending more than they should on anniversary nights out with their spouse, bachelor/ette parties, and proms.  I made between $100 and $300 a night and got to pick which nights I worked. 

It wasn't insane money, but about $1,000 a week on average.  The clients were always a little condescending, but because I wore a black suit and tie, acted professionally and courteously, and treated everyone respectfully they were mostly pretty kind and respectful and tipped well.

If you're going to drive, go that route.  Dealing with the type of people looking for the cheapest ride possible is going to result in a lot of assholes.  People looking to do things on the cheap are, for whatever reason, insanely entitled and bitchy to the people helping them.  Paying $13 for a ride and giving someone a 1 star review because their car was 2 degrees colder than you prefer or they didn't have a charge cable for you is some absolute bullshit.  They'll bitch about their boyfriend ""cheating"" on them while sending selfies to other guys and then act like you sexually assaulted them for glancing in the rear view.  It's ridiculous.  Seriously, why put up with it?

If you need the extra cash, whatever, but seriously just drive for a Limo company instead.  It took $100 in my city to get a license to drive others and the company I worked for paid for half of it.  Then the suit, shirts, and tie were on me, so it was an investment of sorts, but seriously, I was making nearly what I make now as a working professional and people who pay for an Exec SUV don't treat you like shit.  Like I said, a little condescending, but mostly pretty good.  Plus it can be fun to drive around minor celebrities, politicians, athletes, etc.  I'm not the sort of dude to be star struck or anything, so it was fun to joke around with people you see on TV (if they started the convo, never start the convo yourself).  

I don't get Uber driving.  I mean, I get it if you're literally just picking up some cash to make ends meet.  But I don't get it as a long-term choice.  Go a little bit higher class and drive for a Limo company instead.  

---------

Best tips, BTW, were Prom party parents when you delivered their kids home before midnight.  Half the reason parents hired me to drive their kids was because I was on a set schedule and would let them know if I was going to be late.  They were so so happy when their little ""Innocent"" kid came home before midnight without having sex on Prom night that they'd tip $100 on top of my rate almost every time, sometimes more. 

And since it's an Escalade, not an actual Limo, it's not like the teens were trying to hook up in the back anyway.  Occasionally they'd make out and the guy would try and feel the girl up a bit and/or she'd get a little handsy down south, but no one was having sex in the back seat while I drove and could see.  

Proms were the best.  Drive to the restaurant, drop off, park, wait and read a book for half an hour.  Take them to the dance, drop off, park and wait a couple hours, keep reading your book, take them home, drop off, and then you're done. Make $200-$300 and the most you had to deal with was an 18 year old asking you why he can't smoke ($500 immediate fee for their parents if they do). 

---------

I'm an adult with a real job now, but if you're going to drive, I really suggest looking into this.  I miss the easy money of driving proms, weddings, wine tours, etc.  It's 90% reading a book or listening to the radio and 10% making idle conversation and joking around with a passenger.  Boring, but profitable.  

Yet you have Uber drivers driving their own car, dealing with people who will argue over $1 more than they expected on their ride, and a review system where they punish you for shit that's not your fault.

Why are you dealing with that bottom tier shit?"

Very few of them recognize that they still have much to learn and could always get better.

Drew Brees said something close to this, although much more kindly, last off-season.  About the reason he was so successful was because he always felt like he had more to learn, could grow as a player, and was willing to work with experts to improve his game.

news,fdtu0fr,t1_fdt13g2,1578722190.0,"The wage gap isn't a myth, it's just much smaller than people think it is.  At least according to the Freakonomics Podcast, when all benefits, personal choices, etc are accounted for it's roughly 4-7 cents per dollar.  So women earn between 96 cents and 93 cents per every $1 a man makes.

That doesn't mean it's not still a problem, but people still pretend its the quoted 77 cents per dollar mark when that isn't true.  And that's a systemic problem in the social sciences.  People glob onto whatever grabs headlines.  The headline ""sexism in the wage scale is decreasing, and closing in on equality"" doesn't get clicks or readers.  

Nor does it get people donating money to the groups who fight for women's rights.  Which is really what it's about.  These groups aren't run by idiots.  They know if they don't rally people for a bitter battle that they won't donate money, which means they will be put out of work. 

The thing is, there's plenty of good work that still needs to be done.  This misreporting of statistics is seen as a necessary lie so that they can do that good work.  If someone's not out there fighting to fix what's still wrong, then it doesn't get fixed.

I'm not saying they're right to do it.  I think if everyone is honest with the data that that means there will be less resentment and bickering and more work to to correct the wrongs in the world.  I'm an optimist though."

Conservative,fd7jrkp,t1_fd5x2wv,1578205603.0,"There's a a few things to unpack in the post above.

One, you are correct, that we need dramatically fewer human bodies to fight a war now than we used to.  Technological advances mean that many, if not most, duties and roles in the military have been automated since WW2, or even since Vietnam, and a good bit since the Gulf.  We used fewer than 200K troops in the entire Iraq invasion in 2003.  We used more than 250K troops on D-day alone in WW2.  

We simply don't have rows of men heading into the meat grinder like we did 80 years ago.  

---------

The second thing to unpack is physical fitness.  America is very sadly very overweight.  Roughly 3/4 (71%)^^^[\[1\]](https://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/the-recruitment-problem-the-military-doesnt-want-to-talk-about/)  of 18 year olds are unfit for service for a variety of reasons, but mainly due to weight.  Also due to criminal history, intelligence, and so on.  But for America it's a weight issue.

This isn't a Liberal vs Conservative issue.  [If you look at a map](https://i.imgur.com/S7bV6NN.jpg), Childhood Obesity isn't focused in Liberal States nor Conservative States.  

-----

This third and last thing is that if a draft is ever necessary, we'll have a lot bigger problems than politics.  We'll be united.  Because the only way we'll ever reach the point that we NEED a draft is if there is such a massive, catastrophic war that no one will be opposed to it.  I'm not talking about another invasion of another desert country.  Like I said in point #1, fighting a war of this nature doesn't require as many people as before.

After 9/11 we had lines of people being turned away by the military.  If we get attacked in a major way, people will turn out to volunteer again.  After that, if we STILL need to have a draft, then we're in such a world of shit that it's not going to be a political issue of Liberals vs Conservatives.  

-----------

I hate when people bring up the draft, because it's such a silly, flawed, debate.  We don't need the draft, and if we ever do again it won't be a political debate."

This results in the WR, with arms up and in the DB's chest, driving the DB off of himself beyond 5 yards down field. He does this while the pass is in the air, which results in the same type of penalty as would be thrown during a pick play.  WR is driving the DB back, while a different WR in the vicinity receives the ball.
