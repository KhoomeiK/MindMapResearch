news,ffvujr5,t1_ffvt3aj,1580273669.0,"I have no idea how this took such a weird turn. I was only trying to point out that it's hard for *most* people to maintain a full time job without a license to drive compared to taking away their hunting license --*for failure to pay child support*.  I'm reasonably sure there are people across the country who do not hunt for their food.  If one does, fine.   But if you *aren't paying court ordered child support to ensure that your children (who I'm assuming are with the custodial parent) don't starve and have clothing and proper shelter* then hand over that license and carry your ass to the grocery store.  And for the record, I'm most certainly NOT privileged.  I have indoor plumbing and a debit card but I don't consider myself all that bougie.  (this is one of the stupidest arguments I've ever been in).  Goodbye."

politics,ffjq81y,t1_ffjlkid,1580004177.0,"Part of the problem is that is shouldn't *have* to be clarified.  But when one asks for clarification on this, it's obvious your mind is made up so it's kind of pointless.   But I will say this:  if anyone serves at the president's whim, why was he so shady about it?  He had no good reason for firing her but even if he did, it could've been handled properly, out in the open.  Why was he screaming ""get her out take her out!""?  If he has the power to do that, why not do it in a professional manner and why is he yelling it at 2 soon to be convicted criminals?    The bottom line was she was screwing up his plans and he needed to get her out of the way, for *his* benefit.  But you keep seeing it through your rose colored glasses if that gives you peace."
