worldnews,ffefglj,t1_ffed5ow,1579845987.0,"Precisely because it's lunar New year and there will be a lot of travel so it spreads.

I don't know. The news was reporting they thought most travelers would be going from Wuhan to three cities, HK, Taiwan, and some other mainland China city. That's the only reason I thought about it.

I never said it was a good idea and obviously with what's happening would be an incredibly stupid plan."
Unexpected,ffebfsa,t1_ffea1bk,1579842105.0,I believe you have ways of dealing with people who don't learn your religion and it involves only asking them nicely once to do so. Then it's time to move on to other means.
worldnews,ffe9oag,t1_ffe7ikr,1579840559.0,Yeah and that's why it's conspiracy time! ... What if they released this virus to take care of their little Hong Kong problem? HK was one of the few cities listed as it being potentially spread to with the amount of people travel. A lot less suspicious to have an outbreak start somewhere else and then spread to your intended target.
nottheonion,ffc3z0u,t1_ffc1rpg,1579790961.0,Should have told her to talk to legal. There is a reason many companies do that even though in many states they don't have to. They don't want it challenged in court and then become a law.
politics,ffaifqr,t1_ffaecup,1579736488.0,It's not a legal trial so not all normal court rules apply. In fact they can change the rules of the trial whenever they want with a vote. That's why there are laws like obstruction of Justice but how do you prove that if they obstruct the investigation into obstruction?

maybemaybemaybe,ff63kj4,t1_ff5zmcd,1579618261.0,"For entering the US as a US citizen they can not turn you away. However, they can make things very difficult for you and they can take your phone/laptop to try and get in or clone it. This is still an area which is grey and had never really been contested in court. They can not refuse a citizen entry though.

As for putting you on lists, that is a thing for possible threats and they do collect a lot of information on everyone. However they don't have an actual file on everyone like China is trying to do. 

The difference with US data collection is it isn't immediately identified as you. For instance, since you wrote what you did about Trump they can run a search on your Reddit username and then their system will search and graph out all possible connections with all other data they have. So they build a file on you ad hoc."
maybemaybemaybe,ff5thkt,t1_ff5qs05,1579609640.0,"Nope but they can build a social profile of everyone they possibly can. Using that information they can ban people from entering China (which they already have).   Going beyond ""you"" they could ban people associated with you for activity you have done.

They can use the information to target potential ""assets"" for espionage.

Potential for accidental leaked information about companies and governments. Fitbit had an issue where it showed US troop patrol routes in forts/bases.

So you might not think this data collection is useful or don't care about your personal data but it is a real problem."

I'm not sure if they knew it was going to blow up but they knew it would start to tumble uncontrollably and break itself apart. So they decided not to have it ""self-destruct"" as they were pretty confident it would rip itself apart with the forces it would experience after the emergency abort and main engine shutdown."

As for regular jobs it can be handled in different ways. First is they just tell their employees not to come in. Second is they allow employees to take an unscheduled PTO day. Third is they don't give a shit and see it as an opportunity to write up, discipline, or fire people."
