montreal,fcmvo9k,t3_ehy1x8,1577794418.0,"Also ... the area near Pied-du-courant can be desolate at that time of the year. In the fair season there's a ""beach"", a boardwalk and lots of stuff, but all that is gone by October. Parc Lafontaine might be better for a walk. If you want to walk next to the river you get a better view in **Parc Jean-Drapeau** on Ile Ste-Helene or at the Old-Port (or even further West in Verdun / Lasalle). The river shore is cut-off from the residential areas by industries and the Port on most of its length.

*parc jean-drapeau, not talon."
montreal,fcmuuh0,t3_ehy1x8,1577793350.0,"Jean-Talon Market itself may be a little disappointing in January. It's in its winter configuration and this year a lot of fruit and vegetable stalls aren't there because the Farmers Market Board have terminated the lease of an important tenant (due to corruption, they were illegally subletting, acting as they were the owners of the numerous lots they rented under false names).

That said there's still about two dozens of shops open, including great bakeries (Joe la croûte has the best baguette imho) and Fromagerie Hamel's cheese shop. Maybe plan a walk om boulevard Saint-Laurent in Petite Italie just beside. There are nice restaurants and authentic cafés, cookware shops (quincaillerie Dante is an experience in itself) and specialized grocery stores. Milano is hard to miss, plenty of delicious Italian imports; Anatol is intense with its huge selection of spices and dried goods, the smells in that shop ... If you want to visit a depanneur I suggest Dépanneur Lalime on St-Laurent Blvd.

There's also a great Syrian restaurant just across the street north of Jean-Talon market (Montreal's North, which is more North-West) called Alep. You might need a reservation. They have another address just next door: le Petit Alep , for a more informal setting. I cannot recommend both enough.

If you are looking for a slice of Montreal neighbourhood's life, just go a block north of Jean-Talon on Rue de Castelnau . Local shops, local people. Nice coffee at Café Larue, incredible baked goods at boulangerie Du Pain dans les Voiles, Quebec beers wine and ciders available at Magasin Général. (A better option for a huge selection of local beers is Dépanneur Peluso on Beaubien street south of the market - or Brasserie Vice et Versa of you want to sit down) 

West of Petite-Italie there's a former industrial district that is under intense gentrification. Formerly known as Marconi-Alexandra , now a lot call it by its real-estate developer name: Mile-Ex. There's a cool hipsterish dépanneur with sandwiches: Le pickup ; a nice diner restaurant with locally-sourced ingredients:  Manitoba; and a 3rd wave coffee shop with one of the best brown-roast coffee in town: Dispatch (don't go to the location on the Plateau, worst -too cool for you- service ever, the staff at Marconi-Alexandra's location is so much friendlier)"
