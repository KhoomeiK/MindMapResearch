IAmA,ffipek2,t3_etr9mc,1579979419.0,"Thank you for this. I know I'm late but I desperately hope you or someone knowledgeable can answer this:

I have severe social anxiety but every single therapist I've been sent to always wants me to do cognitive behavioral therapy. I cannot seem to get across the concept that when I am terrified of actively being involved in the world around me, I hardly am in the mindset to do weird bodily exercises like breathing in patterns, or tightening and releasing muscle groups, or anything that makes me feel even more embarrassing and weird than I'm *already* feeling. I just can not get anybody to understand that this set of methods simply do not work for me. What should I do? Is this all there is? I've already given up several times because of this. 

(I'm poor af due to my extreme anxiety ruining my working life - currently working *extremely* part time but it doesn't pay and I have no insurance - hence the lack of choice)"

depression,ffhnf5g,t1_ffhh43i,1579943790.0,"Nothing will kill pain like that. I knew a guy who took loads of drugs and then set hisself on fire. 

He survived. 

*Almost an entire day.*

You know what they did to him, in the hospital, before he finally punched out? They took a wire brush and fucking scraped all the charred flesh off.

Think about that shit. What was left of his head was SCREAMING. 

I've looked into every method I could come across, and what I ultimately found is that every single method has some ***SUPER*** bummer drawbacks that are fucking horrifying. 

So. Fuck that.

But you know what *will* kill you with 100% certainty? Living. Getting better. Making the most, or as much as you can, out of what you got going. Figuring shit out. Finally getting some things right. Winding up relatively happy, somehow, even if it's not 100% of the time.

That'll kill you. Eventually. It takes longer, sure, but it feels so much better man. And it's a **for sure** thing. Bonus effects: fucking FLYING CARS finally. I assume."
