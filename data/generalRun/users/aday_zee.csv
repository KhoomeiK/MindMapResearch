rareinsults,fe5yavb,t1_fe5g8ho,1578877645.0,I think all the downvotes misinterpreted this guy's joke
nursing,fe3vo5u,t1_fdu0dqn,1578853272.0,"Not sure why this was downvoted. But anyway, thanks for the response. I don't think I'm going 
 in it for money because there are plenty of better money making fields out there. I like to think I'm going through it to help people but it's such a broad motivation that it can be applied to basically any job out there.  But anyway, I'm glad you found your niche :) This is kind of unrelated but do you think nursing has allowed you to have a good work life balance?"
nursing,fe3sz14,t1_fduxkh0,1578852612.0,"The bay area is really expensive. I always thought the RN salary there would just cancel out due to cost of living. I guess not then.

It sucks that sometimes good intentions end up doing the opposite of what they're meant to."
nursing,fe3r0r6,t1_fdvojw4,1578852043.0,"No don't be sorry! I love reading long responses. I'm trying to figure out if my personality aligns with nursing also. I know I'm introverted but I still like people and I want to be better at interacting with them. Sometimes I think that I would be best in a creative career but I can't think of any that I would want to do for the rest of my life or that would make same impact as I believe nursing makes. That's not to look down on other jobs. I've never worked a real job so I can't really say anything about it.

You said that your life is alot more balanced now. Do you think that's because you've expanded your interests out of nursing related things or is it just something with building confidence."
nursing,fe3ocwe,t1_fdydca9,1578851283.0,"I've always thought of working in the ER. I don't know how I am under pressure, though I'll probably find out sooner or later. So when you say you have a flexible schedule do you mean that you get to choose when you're working or just that since you work 3 days a week you have a lot of time off?"
nursing,fe3nldb,t1_fdzuf5k,1578851057.0,To get into health IT do you need a computer science degree? Any time I hear IT I think of software engineering. Also were you able to start OR right out of school or did you have to go into bedside first?
nursing,fe3kclk,t1_fe0b7uq,1578850080.0,Sorry it sucks so much :/ have you tried non bedside nursing jobs. Some people say that working somewhere a lot less stressful like a clinic or maybe home health was much better for them.

nursing,fds9kpm,t1_fds6fp5,1578697497.0,"Thanks for the response! You have an interesting perspective on it. I  see a lot of people saying that nursing has to be your calling or that you have to be naturally empathetic and compassionate but I guess that isn't completely true. I don't know how much resolve I really have, but honestly I don't think its much. I've  always hoped that resolve is just something I would develop."
nursing,fds8moc,t1_fds6jbs,1578696846.0,"Thanks for your response. I'm sorry that you've ended up hating it so much. I was contemplating the same thing. Whether I like the theory and science more than hands on patient interaction. One of my fears is that I end up going through nursing school and realising that I should have been a doctor. Just curious, do you know what specialty you want to be in after med school?"
nursing,fdryabk,t1_fdrulfb,1578691503.0,I've heard a lot of people say that working nights completely messes with their head because of their sleep schedule so they end up feeling like they get less time off. How do you deal with it?

Supernatural,fctfhab,t1_fcmbv2s,1577941587.0,I highly doubt Dean had it worse. Sam was in the cage which is worse than any other part of hell. Not to mention he was there much longer than Dean was. But more on Alastair would be interesting.

loseit,fcn0aks,t3_ei0gse,1577799473.0,"Have you considered joining any sports? A sport will have you being active and will motivate you since hopefully it ends up being fun. It doesn't even have to be with a school it can be with a local rec center. 

One thing I did to ease back into working out is to  gradually workout more often. For example, for the first month I aim to workout 3 times a week for at least 20 minutes on those days. Then the next month I upped it to 4 times and then the next month I up it to 5 times. Of course you don't have to workout that much but it was just my choice. If you create a plan like this it might motivate you to actually act on it. 

Also, if I were you I wouldn't focus too much on losing weight but just in making sure you're eating healthy and being active, mainly because you height and weight puts you in a healthy weight zone. Changing your lifestyle like that will probably result in weight loss anyway."
