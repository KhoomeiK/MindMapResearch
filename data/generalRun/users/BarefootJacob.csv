RATS,ffk38an,t1_ffj8p4w,1580014435.0,"Oddly enough we can.  Lyra is a Himalayan, so she has the distinctive brown nose.  Vienna is a hooded rex (hiding in the box in the top right!).  Pogo and Nimbus are both Albino, but Pogo is a rex so her whiskers and fur is curly.  Nimbus is also a runt so is smaller than the rest (and twice as cheeky!).

Dingoh has darker patches on her back, whereas her direct sister Dynamoh is lighter patches and a faint touch of tan.  Finally Cookie and Pryzma are direct siblings but Cookie has a slightly darker crown.

Granted, sometimes it's not easy!  With some of our previous mischief I struggled to tell three sisters apart.  All were hooded, with similar markings.  For the hooded rats their markings are pretty constant, but with the lighter coloured breeds their markings can change and lighten with time.  We had one who had light tan hooded patterns when she was young and lost it all and was completely white at the end.

I've encountered her attitude several times in my life.  Once when I came out to a friend he basically stopped talking to me as having sex with another man was, in his eyes, as bad as having sex with animals.  Then there are the 'God made Adam and Eve, not Adam and Steve' variety.

It's one thing if the comments stay verbal, but sadly they don't.  Bigoted comments and attitudes such as those displayed by your mom precipitate attacks on LGBTQI+ people, and also lead to mental health issues, self-harm and suicide.  You could ask her to Google the name Tyler Clementi and get back to you.

I would also like to say this to your mom: in the bible, Jesus is portrayed as a man of love, compassion and forgiveness.  If two men, in love, had gone to Jesus and asked for their blessing, do you really think he would have insisted they be stoned to death?

Again, well done and thank you for confronting your mom's bigotry.  You are, most definitely, not the asshole.

If someone is driving at the speed limit, they should leave enough room in front to be able to stop before hitting the car in front.  If that car in front is doing the speed limit, no-one should be overtaking.

In the UK some motorways now have tailgating cameras which measure the distance between cars and send automatic tickets to tailgaters.

A couple of other points for anyone really: there is no such thing as a slow lane and fast lane (certainly in the UK).  Check the Highway Code or ask the traffic police: it's called an overtaking lane.

Also if anyone drives into the back of you, insurers view them automatically as being at fault as (with rare exceptions) no circumstances under the tailgater would not be at fault.  Even if they claimed that your brakelights weren't working - they should still have left sufficient distance to stop."

I lived abroad for a year in China.  What worked to reassure me was always knowing how I could get home.  I would know which transit lines to use; if that didn't work I had my home address written in Chinese on a bit of paper to show to a taxi driver.  I also had my mobile (pre-smartphone era) and knew how to phone the police if I was stuck.

This really helped me keep a lid on my anxiety and enabled me to go off on my own much more than I would otherwise have been able to do.

In addition I would explore an area in stages.  So I would  start with a district say ten minutes taxi ride away.  I'd check out a shop one day and a cafe.  Next time, the same cafe and maybe a couple more shops.  The area gradually became really familiar and I could explore farther from my home area.
