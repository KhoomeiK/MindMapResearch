niceguys,ffahl4g,t1_ffa1kdy,1579735914.0,"I'm all about support, but the meme suggests fixing.  

I suppose the difference is whether or not the person who needs support is reliant on their partner to fix them.  Codepency.  Or, are they tackling that mountain themselves, and are grateful for the support they have?  Interdependency.  

What I see in the meme is codepency."

It would have been a slippery slope fallacy if I had said something along the lines of ""Since we're doing this, this is what will happen if we continue."".   However, what I said was; ""What are we going to do, start raiding homes and burning everyone's bibles next?""   

The difference is the former is a projection and narrative control while the latter is an example for food for thought.  

As for the Good Debate fallacy, I know it as the Tu Quoque.  I just thought you meant good debating with mutual reasonable people.  

You're right on that one.  It is a fallacy.  I did exactly that.  

There's also a fallacy called the Fallacy Fallacy in which, even though an argument is fallacious, it's valid and correct.  

You said

>I disagree mainly because the athiesm sub gets targeted quite a lot from trolls.

And I said

>Atheist activists in general are loud mouthed trolls. Just look at the Church of Satan. They troll IRL hilariously.

In other words, if atheists have every right to troll both inside and outside atheism, as long as you agree with their message, it is most certainly hypocritical.  

Especially if your argument is that OP should be banned because he trolled outside of r/atheism.  

And even then, if you are unwilling or too lazy to engage trolls you disagree with, and would rather forcefully silence them instead, I would call that weak and a lack of conviction.  

We ended this conversation because we obviously do not agree.  I asked, you accepted, I thanked you.  That was an agreement to disagree.  Civilized.  Like letting your SO walk away from a fight when they've had enough.  

We're not going to agree.  And that's OK.  It was a worthwhile conversation for a while.  I'm still 100% against r/atheism for the action it took.  You're still supporting them for their decision.  My argument was the comment was not ban worthy, and any infractions OP made was outside the sub.  Your argument is that OP is a troll, and therefore deserves to be excluded.   That's it as far as I can see.  All the long comments are debating the finer points, but we still disagree.  

And that's OK.  I'm still going to argue my position whenever I see it, and I hope you do the same.  It's your morality.  I'm pretty sure we both hope the other will eventually see the light."

What I'm reading you say is that his brand of trolling isn't welcome because you don't like what he's saying, and therefore, deserves to be censored.  The problem I have with that, is it goes against the very fundamental tenets of organized atheism.  We've been censored for centuries.  And for what, only to become the oppressor the moment we feel comfortable enough to do so?  

Disagreement should be fought with logic, skepticism, and criticism.  Not censorship and forced silence.  What are we going to do, start raiding homes and burning everyone's bibles next?"
banned,ff4xc0y,t1_ff02pkr,1579574694.0,"The thing about OP's history is that the only comment in r/atheism in the past 5 days is exactly the one that got him banned.  Which is not ban worthy.  OP has a 100% solid post here.  No bamboozle.  

So you're arguing that OP is a piece of shit for their racist trolling and horrible commentary *Elsewhere*, and therefore, the ban is legit.  

I would argue that is outside of the mod's purview at r/atheism.  

It's like supporting the police making up charges to fuck someone over just because they don't like what they've done elsewhere and on other occasions.  

It's up to the sub in which OP is commenting to take action for the comments in their sub.  

The ban is bullshit, and is a complete black mark on r/atheism, not OP."

banned,feyv8jf,t3_eqy109,1579450957.0,"The interesting thing about atheism is there are two sociopolitical types.  The type that do not believe in god, and the type that gravitate towards the polar opposite political belief system they were raised in after they left their religion.  

Sadly, I find that atheism has such a huge bias towards liberalism to the point that it's damn near taken over atheism.  

The problem with that is atheism is simply the lack of belief in god.  If you throw your political leanings into atheism with the purpose of using the atheist platform to further your political ideals, it alienates non-believers with opposing political viewpoints.  

The interesting thing about that is that conservatives need atheism far more than liberals.  

Am atheist, am liberal, but hate how you have to be a trump hating feminist in order to be accepted into the community.  Because atheism shouldn't be about that."

But at the same time, another person was responsible for the cat, and finding the the owner to return it.  

It's not like these ideals have to be mutually exclusive.  Ethics sway on either side.  And IMO, the person responsible for the cat was not the vet.  Forcefully involving themselves into a customer issue without consent is a huge moral ethics and legal issue.  Not to mention they might find themselves responsible for an animal they can't return to an owner.  

The customer very well could have asked the vet to take charge of the cat until the rightful owner showed up.   The vet would have been more than happy to do so.  Or at least contact the owner on the customer's behalf as they are the ones that read the tag.  

And then we have the customer who has OP's contact information not doing shit.  They're an asshole right now, and I hope this thread reaches them.  

But yes, the vet gets a pass by me.  For that matter, OP isn't out of the game either.  u/Kacke0525 has a lead."
YouShouldKnow,fdcslrx,t1_fdcq166,1578283145.0,"OK, maybe I should have left the last sentence out for the simple sake of communication.  

However, picture this.  

Someone brings an animal in for a checkup.  That person is in charge of said animal.  The vet has no reason to question said person.   Just to do the checkup.  

The vet does a checkup.  The vet goes to the customer, and gives them the information that's on the chip they read.   

The customer leaves with the cat.   

That's it.  The vet did everything right.   

The lucky part comes into play with the vet scratching their head for a couple of weeks, and decides to contact the owner that was on the chip.  

But it is in fact still the original customer's responsibility to return the cat."
YouShouldKnow,fdcs84c,t1_fdcqa00,1578282813.0,"No it's not!  Bleh.   

The simple fact is the people who found the cat have the responsibility to turn it over to the owner.  They got the information to do just that from the vet.   

Everyone is putting the responsibility on the vet.  It's not.  It can't be."
YouShouldKnow,fdcmjlx,t1_fdclti2,1578278621.0,"For sure.  The vet should have contacted you after reading the chip while the cat was still there.  Not sure what their process is regarding that.  For that matter, I wonder what the people said who brought it in?   And yep, those people are total jerks.  They were given your info.  Hmm?"
YouShouldKnow,fdciiuc,t1_fdci84x,1578275756.0,"This isn't a finders keepers issue.  

The vet didn't determine shit.  Only read a chip.  Which could be old information.  

And let's say someone did come up to you with a diamond ring they found.  Would you take it from them with the purpose of returning it?  

You're stuck on who has rightful ownership of the cat.  Which is NOT what I'm talking about."
YouShouldKnow,fdch760,t1_fdcgxzh,1578274809.0,"This is true.  Who's responsibility?   In this case, the vet does not have the authority to confiscate the cat and take over."
YouShouldKnow,fdcfbeu,t3_ekjllg,1578273495.0,"I'm sorry about your cat.  No fun.  

I think though that you are attributing more authority to the vet vs the people that found them.  

The way you write, your attitude seems to be that the vet should have confiscated the cat from the people that brought him in for the purpose of giving the cat back to you.  Aside from the fact that there's multiple problems with this, it's not the vet's place.  

The vet and the person who brought the cat in have equal amounts of authority as citizens.  In other words, the vet does not have more authority than the person.   Beyond that though, the person who brought the cat in is the person who is in charge of the cat.  

You're lucky that the vet contacted you at all."

wowservers,fd6xmks,t1_fcypf0t,1578196987.0,"X20 is a quick recap that allows you to lvl to 80 within a week, but also gives you time to sort everything before you get to 80.  Once you've given yourself a basic tutorial or recap, then you get to play endgame content.  

I would love a X20 3.3.5 PVE server considering the way I play is basically just running around collecting shit.  I'm so casual.  

However, to be fair, the way I play isn't the way most people play."
