news,fdd40to,t1_fdcva01,1578293863.0,"Current Iran would never be had we not stuck our dicks in the pot.

America is a nation of war. It's how we were formed and we have spent half our existence in a state of conflict in one way or another. We have even lost to Canada three times. The only thing we got out of it was a black eye and a smidge of land that is part of Vermont (possibly the crown of Maine if you count that where the only casualty was cow).

Iran general dude was a bad egg. All around. He's also from a region that has seen countless conflicts over thousands of years. From in-fighting among tribes, civil wars, regional conflicts, empires, and their culture demands blood for blood. We have stood by watching shit happen to us, allies, and bystanders. EVENTUALLY someone was going step up and do something. As a veteran who has been there, lost friends both American and indigenous, I'm glad this fucker is gone and I'm glad most of us aren't there. 

However there certainly could have been a better plan than to annihilate him at the damned airport. That's like walking into a packed Walmart and blasting a suspicious person in the face and walking out. There is a lot of open road out there and it's possible to have gotten him that way. But I'm also pretty sure he was headed to a location where he'd get lost in the crowds, intelligence probably confirmed it and said this is your only chance Chump. And so he took it. Like Obama did with Bin Bimbo.

This is going to lead to a war, no doubt, and it may finally mean we are getting out of there for now. Like when Vietnam went down. This was never something we would win.

Them pulling out of the deal with the REST of the countries is a problem, using this as an excuse to finally do so and not keep their word (and look good because they aren't falling for the tactics) is childish. And the other countries in the treaty should stand up as well. Maybe not in step with America, but why not keep Iran in check? They would never have signed on if they weren't worried.

And what's this other shit about Korea? When was the last terrorist attack on an embassy or ship by North Korea? We don't bomb them for two reasons, Russia and China. The other reason is because they can even get a missile to Japan yet, let alone get to the nearest US Embassy. Shit, they can barely make it across the DMZ.

War is coming, now is not the time to spit and scream for past actions. Now is the time to plan, and cast your votes. Don't listen to the news during the elections, don't believe the polls (which are stupid and not representative of the people, these polls generally only take into account .0006% of all Americans), and make sure you go and vote. Take the day off. Ground your feelings. Hope that a positive change is achieved. Someone who might be able to talk this shit down back to an uneasy dick-waving contest.
