Strongman,ff8h9bc,t1_ff66uu0,1579678413.0,"True and that's a good explanation for why he weighs comfortably more, but I'm not sure that'd make it a whole lot easier on his heart."
Strongman,ff5ss5z,t1_ff5okpl,1579608872.0,Not only that but he's been over 400lbs for a loooong time and hovered around 450 for a good while. Z hit 400 at his peaks but averaged around 370 more often. Carrying around that weight on a daily basis takes a lot out of a man!
todayilearned,ff2n2di,t1_ff2l9hn,1579514191.0,"Ah true, definitely in the range of 20-25 USD though."
todayilearned,ff2kg98,t1_ff2i7z6,1579510256.0,"Damn, I'm Aussie too and haven't seen cigarette prices in a good few years. $28USD on average for a pack of 20-25 looks about right. Absolutely insane taxes on cigs and spirits here."
todayilearned,ff2kc8x,t1_ff2hdds,1579510100.0,"Pretty much only barely. With a just-about fulltime job, no mortgage and no other major expenses other than food (ie without spending on jewellery, clothing etc) then you can ""sustain"" an opioid habit and barely continue saving money. Think around $1-1.3k earnings a week, and spending $300-400 on pills a week. Then you've got $600-1k to spend on the essentials and save whatever else. It's really not a situation anyone would really want to be in, but quitting's tough for sure."
todayilearned,ff2go8v,t1_ff2fvqb,1579505341.0,"Really $6-7 a pack is nothing compared to how much an opioid or meth addict will spend daily. I never used meth but would spend $75-80 on opioids (pills) daily. Luckily they're not that horrible for you physically (-they take a toll mentally though), but $6-7 (or over here, $15-20) a pack sounds like it could be a lot worse!"
Strongman,ff2623s,t1_fejp5n1,1579494820.0,Lalas for sure but I can't think of any others.

AskReddit,fenax8n,t1_fempeig,1579280774.0,Also he's a gay black man. Forgot to mention it!
armwrestling,fdvqwdc,t1_fdpn667,1578750486.0,"Because he achieved success against the other super-massive Eastern hulk a few years ago, and under Russian rules with a Russian crowd (-not that I think that'd affect Denis as strongly as other pullers).  
It's only natural to draw the comparison!"
news,fdq0ib3,t1_fdpyhuf,1578648798.0,"Yeah except decent videogames wouldn't have this as part of their story because it's too dumb and convenient that every little thing went wrong or got deleted. The writers would think ""nobody would buy this shit"" yet here we are.   
It's actually fucking insulting by this point. I'd actually rather they say ""yeah we turned off cameras and deleted whatever footage we did have because rich, powerful people would have our jobs or lives if we didn't play ball - so fuck you all, you bunch of apathetic peasants, go back to your social media and forget anything ever happened."""
listentothis,fdphdi9,t1_fdnvrso,1578628668.0,"Oh nice!  
I guess it's hard to compare as although all Steinways have a sort of general sound (as do Faziolis, Yamahas etc), they're still individual instruments and can wildly differ depending on upkeep. Pianists are undoubtedly really attuned to the difference in touch but I'd imagine you'd have a stronger ear for the differences as an audio engineer! That's a whole ocean I've dipped my toe into and it scares me at times!  
Ahh I'd love a Model D! I'm lucky enough to have an OB6 and it's one of the most naturally alluring sounding instruments I've ever played."
listentothis,fdnqu21,t1_fdnflqn,1578591070.0,"I'm jealous! I've never played a Fazioli.  
I was lucky enough to give my final Masters recital on a new Steinway D in a concert hall and it was an incredibly special (albeit terrifying) experience! It felt like what I'd imagine driving a Rolls-Royce or Aston Martin would feel like to a professional driver. Incredibly responsive touch, powerful and rich, resonant bass and crisp, crystalline highs. I'll never have a quarter million to blow on a piano (not on a musician's salary!) but those moments stick with you!  
Luckily some of the more gorgeous sounding synthesizers aren't nearly as expensive."
listentothis,fdnb80p,t1_fdmt8h0,1578582015.0,"A comparatively recent company of top level, really prestigious pianos. Think Steinway prices (six figures) but less popular and more Italian. Pretty sure they only have the one factory too."
listentothis,fdnaxna,t1_fdmn7r1,1578581829.0,"At this level it's practically expected, unless you're playing an ensemble work. Oddly enough a lot of technically demanding pieces, particularly ones with large and rapid jumps, force you to memorize them in a way as your eyes can't be frantically looking up and down as well as side to side for half an hour without accuracy suffering greatly."
synthesizers,fdjxigw,t1_fdjmik3,1578490629.0,"There are lots of beginner tutorials for all DAWs on YouTube, I'd recommend finding someone who teaches at a pace and clarity that resonates with you and follow them. It's also worth trying out demos for a few different DAWs early on because you'll find some are more intuitive for you naturally, and some work more naturally with different genres of music.  
I started very briefly with Ableton Lite but switched to Reaper pretty early and found it reasonably intuitive, so I've stuck with it ever since. But yeah, consult YouTube!"
armwrestling,fdjj6s3,t1_fdjdfvu,1578473281.0,"I agree but that's not at all what the video's about.  
Looking forward to see how he fares in this top 8, particularly against Ongarbaev and Babaev. If his shoulder holds up alright I think he'd stand a decent chance, though if I were a betting man I'd probably put my money on Ongarbaev to come out on top."
funny,fddhlpy,t1_fddfu62,1578312619.0,"It's cool that he's aging linearly, I feel like I'm aging exponentially faster."
Music,fdd1328,t3_eklhcx,1578290623.0,"After hearing only this song from Living Colour for around 15 years, last year I decided to do some digging and I'd highly recommend checking out more of their stuff to those who enjoy this song but aren't familiar with any of their others."

synthesizers,fd0f2dn,t1_fcyau4x,1578117890.0,"Oh it's really just for display and is a glorified dust cover.  
The studio looks a lot prettier when the synths are visible rather than hidden under rugs, and they're made of a sturdy plastic - but in the end they are just glorified dust covers like you said. I wouldn't use anything short of a hard case for travel."
synthesizers,fd0eqyf,t1_fcy1wjv,1578117769.0,"I see your point, and certainly must claim ignorance regarding the costs of moulding plastic, but just comparing the price of the Sub37 Decksaver, which is of similar size to the OB6 in length and width but more awkward in height, and seeing it at around 60% the price doesn't make sense other than pulling more money from people who seem to be able to afford it."
AskReddit,fcxnmvi,t1_fcxehgz,1578067229.0,"I hope not for the death. The guy's clearly an asshole thief but so long as the person buying the drugs knows what they're buying is genuine and knows the dose then it's their responsibility.  
Of course, chances are if the dealer was that much of an asshole he may've knowingly sold some other chemical under a different name."
synthesizers,fcxi5z7,t3_ej9s09,1578063532.0,"I really like Decksavers and the ones for my Sub37 and Microbrute work an absolute treat, but there's no way I'm paying $130AUD for a piece of plastic for my OB6. The price for the decksaver scales along with the synth, I suppose just because the musician should be able to afford to pay more if they own an expensive synth?  
They're lovely for display and are well made but it's a shame on the price."
Music,fcn3lzj,t1_fcmz84v,1577802336.0,Could you recommend me three tracks that you think accurately portray traditional acid jazz? Just asking as someone relatively ignorant of the genre and would like to hear more.
pics,fck6797,t1_fck5zko,1577717725.0,"You're saying that like it's a bad thing.  
Give me a silly crazy premise, stylized however a small studio wants to do it in bite-sized 10-15 minute episodes and colour me entertained!"
armwrestling,fcf0o85,t3_egsn02,1577625532.0,"Yeah Ryan's doing great things for the sport both in Australia and worldwide via YouTube. I don't think he's actually getting a ton of hate (compared to Michael Todd for example), just the same few people over and over. I typically see the same few usernames next to the hate, which is never really well articulated or couldn't apply to just about any other successful arm wrestler or social media personality.  
I don't really buy into the ""underperforming"" aspect of competition, unless you're already an established elite. Until you've performed at an international tournament, you're an unknown and can't really over or underperform. It's the best training opportunity, and short of getting injured and withdrawing, you either come out winning experience or you win experience plus reputation and some money.  
It's all uphill from here, unless the few trolls get to him, and I don't imagine he'll let that happen."
synthesizers,fbuqdgd,t3_eekk84,1577118688.0,"Seeing as we're in /r/synthesizers, check out [Alan Parsons Project - I Robot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vB8dweYCLes) if you haven't already."
