If you're after a more personal story with an arguably more developed main cast, then Era 2 is just what you're looking for.


Personally, I actually enjoyed Era 2 more than Era 1, and Era 1 is no slouch. That said, it was a different story with a well made cast, and Sanderson's writing skills have arguably improved leaps and bounds since Era 1.

The Empire has pretty much fallen at this point, and its great military minds have gone down with it (especially with Thrawn no longer being canon). The Rebellion drastically decreased in intelligence after the Empire's fall, just look at the New Republic and its idiocy. The First Order hasn't risen yet, but given their tactical prowess resembles the actual Nazis they're based on pretty damn well, they're no model for military competence... So yeah, I have no trouble believing that a single gunslinger is the greatest military mind in the galaxy."

Meanwhile, Kylo Ren and Rey are both hugely powerful in the Force, but each has their own weakness. Kylo is a loser who has never won an on screen fight in his life, and while Rey effortlessly mastered the Force, her lack of training in saber combat is noticable.
