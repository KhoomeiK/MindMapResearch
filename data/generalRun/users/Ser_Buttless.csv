getdisciplined,ffi0s20,t1_ffhykck,1579961593.0,"Thanks for your reply. It’s funny to hear someone say: “Oh you don’t need days off.” It sounds very much like me on many occasions :D 

I study genetics and love it but when I go on too many days in a row, my studying becomes ineffective. I was mostly looking for what markers people look for when deciding when to push oneself and when to step back and relax. I am not sure about the taking just a part of a day off. I am a kind of a person who needs pretty strict rules otherwise I end up weaving around them :D"
getdisciplined,ffi09y0,t1_ffhxcli,1579961110.0,"Thanks for your answer. How did I not think of drawing? Such a good choice as a mentally easy activity I kinda wanted to get into for a while. 

I see your point with the making of lists but I have been more successful with setting a target number of pomodoros for a day. I often misjudge how much work something actually takes. 

Yoga is great and I do practice it every day but for mental clarity I find the movement a bit too distracting. It sets up a nice session for a lot deeper meditation after the body strain."
productivity,fffji6x,t3_etb9f7,1579885303.0,"I always start by journaling or talking to a stranger.

In the morning I journal with set questions (How am I feeling? What am I thankful for? What am I proud of? What can I do better today than I did yesterday? What is the one thing which makes the difference today?) Plus I drink bulletproof coffee, which improved my life so much. Then do 3-5 pomodoros of 20 minutes while listening to brown noice.

After that I have a lunch, meditate and walk to a coffee shop. There I chat with a stranger (usually a pretty girl to practice overcoming fear of rejection) for a few minutes (which releases dopamine to help you get into the flow), jot down a few sentences into my journal again and start working for another 2-3 pomodoros. After that I return home to have a snack. If necessary I do a few more pomodoros there again."
numenera,ffbnu1p,t3_esqkma,1579774757.0,"Have a look at the abilities and cyphers of your PCs and try to create challenges where they can use them. Have an open mind to new creative solutions,

You can start with a simple ruin exploration but you can try to weave some story into it as well. I recommend creating a story with “Friend” is robbed by an “Enemy” who is trying to prevent a thing from happening. At the start of the game offer players to create “Friend” and “enemy” from their backstory in exchange for an XP. Personal stories make a world of a difference."
numenera,fey8xw8,t3_eqrvg2,1579442281.0,I use the Jade Colossus Map generator. Just flip through the tables to get some inspiration. It has worked quite well for me. It’s just important to keep in mind to try to use the ruins as a backdrop to what the PCs want to be doing/story they want to tell or to foreshadow elements you will use later on. Just yesterday I ran a game with enviroments I was quite proud of and the thing everyone kept talking about was how they ridiculed an NPC they met inside. The other day I explained the concept of a gate to an extradimentional space before showing how it’s used to smuggle people outside of an occupied town. Numenera is about being weird but not as much about being random.
getdisciplined,fey65gc,t3_eqlbcv,1579441311.0,"Hi, the one thing I am sorely missing (or rather would like to find in a habit tracker) is what Momentum did with their widget. Seeing the past 7 days at a glance was so motivating! That app was singlehandedly responsible for turning me into a productivity machine. Unfortunately it’s no longer updated and I am fruitlessly searching for a replacement. So simple yet so difficult to find :("
numenera,fdwxq6p,t1_fdwvb1v,1578763266.0,"Yep, exactly. It can stay on for weeks (tried) and come off easily."
CurseofStrahd,fdn6uli,t3_elm63o,1578578898.0,"This is great! She could be connected to Blinski and the robot he is trying to find. There was another artificer who made it, so PC could be by the same hands."
numenera,fd7t1wb,t1_fd7dvjd,1578209652.0,There is one way to discourage a new player from trying a tabletop rpg: Force them to make a character ahead of time.
selfimprovement,fcyr92f,t1_fcx7l88,1578085412.0,"Thank you, I appreciate the time you spent with this. 

You are right about nofap. It has helped me a lot. I have been on it for a good month now, tho have failed during Christmas due to coming back to old environment. It has helped me carve the time out of my day to talk with girls more and sometimes I even enjoyed it. 

It seems kinda silly now, looking back at the question. It mostly is that I don’t really care for the girls I meet. It’s not that I would be just following a script to get a phone number. I approach most girls in a Café, talk with them for a few minutes and leave majority without any intention of even getting a number. Sometimes it feels like I was judging them too harshly. It’s just so hard to tell when one backs out from fear with the “explanation” that she was not smart enough and when one seriously did not have a good time with them. 

The reason I want to change this are those evenings when I feel lonely and have no one to reach out to. Those times when I feel down and there is no one to help. As you can guess I do not have many friends. 

It’s funny how when one writes it out, the obvious answer finally makes itself clear. It also interesting how a different context of writing influences one’s thinking. I spend at least half an hour each day journaling, yet writing on reddit opened a new perspective.  

Thanks again for your help."

selfimprovement,fcyo9fr,t1_fcvy2lf,1578083772.0,"Good catch. I used to do that and since I turned to nofap, it helped a lot. It mostly does not seem like it’s worth the effort."
