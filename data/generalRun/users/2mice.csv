There are two systems of magic in fantasy books. 

One system - soft magic - doesnt explain the magic, like lord of the rings, game of thrones and apparently witcher.

The other system - hard magic - explains the magic system, an example of this is having someone from a different world or time use technology that we dont have yet, explained in a way that is quite believeable. Thats just one example out of hundreds. 

All i was saying is that if you have soft magic systems in a fantasy story its much harder to enjoy as an audience for A LOT of people. Thats why game of thrones is so succesful, it catered to everyone, including people who typically have no interest in sci fi or fantasy. This is because game of thrones uses the magic very sparingly. Ex: Dragons havent existed in 200 years, white walkers havent in 2000 years, most people think dragons never existed and basically everyone thinks white walkers never existed. Compare that to the first 10 minutes of witcher."

answers,fdsa6uq,t1_fds5lqy,1578697911.0,"For fantasy and many other genres good story telling is about making the absurd believable. Game of thrones succeeds at this because they only introduce little bits of absurdity - like magic, everything else that happens is believable; as a lot of the people and events were based on actualities.

This is why marvel pulled “it” off better than DC.

If you look at the marvel films, most of the absurdness like magic comes from the infinity stones. Cap america, spidey - could maybe happen, iron man - could happen, hawkeye - plausible, black widow same, hulk and thor - a bit absurd but we’ll see where this goes. Scarlet witch, ultron, vision, quicksilver, lokis sceptor, the aether; etc.. all products of the infinity stones.

Dc - everyone has crazy powers somehow and oh theres a magic box that does something and theres a whole race of people under the ocean somehow. Everyone can have superpowers if they believe in themselves!

I actually do enjoy the dc films too though mostly because of the style the films are done in - dark. And having batman being without absurd powers helps keep the thing together.

And i wasnt talking about the last season of game of thrones, as far as im concerned it doesnt exist."
