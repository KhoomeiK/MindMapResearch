DuggarsSnark,ff5qshr,t1_ff50lf6,1579606515.0,"With all due respect, a miscarriage of an 8 week embryo is not the same as infant loss. Beyond are not infants, 12 week Fetuses are not infants.  I think putting them in the same ballpark is offensive to parents who have lost infants. 

There are plenty of support groups on Facebook for miscarriages, and plenty for stillbirths. There are specialised counselling services also. Infant loss tends to have separate groups also. 

There is a whole world of difference in going through a miscarriage, and having to watch your literal baby die, plan a funeral, bury your child, pack up their belongings and look at their photos on the walls, tell all your friends and family why your child no longer exists, and everything else that I'm sure comes with infant and child loss. Miscarriages are painful and traumatic too, but they are not infant infant loss."

I don't want my child to tell us/a teacher/whoever that ___ touched Mary, I want her to be able to be clear if anything happens to her. Like people who use fairy or cookie or whatever (both common things I have heard people use with kids), it doesn't set off alarm bells of a child discloses someone touched her cookie.

I never understand why anti-choice people think Fetuses should get this magical special privilege that no other born person on the planet has. Can I decide to harvest Ben's kidney as and when I desire and instruct him he has to do it because that person has rights? The whole concept is  devoid of reason.

What they say is ""all humans should have rights!"", but what they mean is ""Pregnant peoples rights should cease while they incubate this prescious life, even though they may die gestating and birthing a fetus they don't want!"""
DuggarsSnark,ff2sd5r,t1_ff2358e,1579522061.0,"They'd probably first blame her because of what she wore, where she was, what she was doing, what time it was, and why she was there.

DuggarsSnark,ff2s607,t3_er4jwk,1579521790.0,"Pretty hypocritical since they don't advocate for comprehensive sex ed from a young age. Want to lower the number of abortions? Educate kids properly, abstinence only education doesn't work when people don't want to be abstinent. Easy and free access to birth control for teens reduce abortions. Extended paid parental leave allows some people who otherwise couldn't afford to take time off after giving birth the option to keep the Pregnancy if they want. There's an abundance of things they could promote to reduce abortions, but making them illegal just prevents safe abortion. It results in dead people and dead Fetuses, not exactly a great way to preserve life. 

I find this particular area of their beliefs to be morally bankrupt, at best."

DuggarsSnark,ff2olyy,t1_ff22dqo,1579516581.0,"I actually think its really important for people to teach their kids from a young age what consent and bodily autonomy are, it can help protect them from abuse (or teach them to speak up about it if their ""no""s are not respected) teaching the correct names for genitalia is important too. I wouldn't take my young child to a rally/march of any kind, but I don't like big crowds. I certainly wouldn't take them to a march that is showing support for human rights violations or looking to strip a certain demographic from rights over their own bodies that they are more than entitled to, because they rely on lies and misrepresentation."
DuggarsSnark,ff2odl6,t1_ff25k7b,1579516221.0,"They (anti-choice people) rely on people being uneducated about Pregnancy and fetal development I think. They also seem to forget that bodily autonomy and human rights are things that exist. They also tend to be confused about consent and how that works, that it needs to be ongoing and can absolutely be withdrawn at any time. 

I also notice that they tend to place the blame of an unintended pregnancy on the Pregnant person and say they shouldn't behave opened their legs if they didn't want to get pregnant. Never any mention of men irresponsibly ejaculating all over the place. I bet the duggars use a mixture of giving their kids dis/misinformation, and slut shaming.

DuggarsSnark,fet7c86,t1_ferv4n6,1579372451.0,"Since you bring up joy, what is the general consensus here of Pregnancy possibly being the reason they moved the wedding date forward? I know they went on a camping trip as their stag/hen do (I saw the episode on the TV recently). I think they snuck off into the woods at night and bumped uglies while no one else was awake. I think joy slept in one of those hammocks outside rather than in a tent with other people. That's what I'd have done, if I was young and horny and not able to do more than side hug and hold hands, and wanted to snog and/or shag my fiance in peace.

Parenting shouldn't be about having 100% control all the time, they have never witnessed a true partnership between their parents either, they are just ""trained"" to do as their father dictates. None of it is healthy, none of them know what a happy healthy relationship is. They all got thrown into marriage and babies at an age where most people are going off to college/university, exploring the world as young adults - they don't get to do any of that, and that's really sad. They have missed out on so much. Love, support, trust (chaperones), personal growth, a real relationship with their parents, it's tragic really."

Half an hour while I have a shower or run to the shop, after the baby is fed changed, and preferably sleeping? Maybe. I missed mine a lot when she would be with a grandparent for a few hours at that age. I can't help but think they can't possibly have a true attachment to their kids, and babies developing secure attachments is so important. Their kids developed those secure attachments to their siblings as their main caregivers while they watched their parents be uninvolved dictators - that's bound to cause some emotional damage."

AMA,fcycjvf,t1_fcsgne9,1578078039.0,"My opinion is that Jana is either gay, or doesn't want any/as few kids as possible. She could possibly be putting off marriage until she only has a few possible childbearing years left to limit how many kids she ends up with. I can't imagine anything worse than knowing at 18-22 I'd have to get married and begin having children possibly immediately, with no real way to control it, like using BC, or being able to say ""no I don't fancy a Shag tonight"" and that being ok. 

I hope it's putting off kids, and not that she's gay because it must be truly awful to not be able to come out and know your family will support you, rather than cut you off or send you to some sort of depraved conversion therapy. I assume if she doesn't want to be cut off from her friends and siblings she will need to wait until her parents are dead, and hope her siblings are open minded enough and love her enough to accept her. 

Do you know the duggars, or any of the other reality TV fundamentalists? I'm in the UK but recently watched a programme about the Plath family that are similar to the duggars, the programmes are so fascinating to watch."

I can't imagine being in a position where I eventually thought that that's a call I had to make, it must be extremely hard and I'd definitely hope my friend/family member would make changes before it got to that point. Obviously your sister choosing to cover for this man instead of taking evidence of this latest assault and using it to finally get the hell out with her kids was that last straw.

Maybe you can also allow her to slowly store a few things at your house, that she may want/need but that are hard to pack into what she can carry when she does leave? Maybe sentimental stuff, the children's favourite belongings, and bigger items? I mean he'd notice her leaving with random suitcases but not necessarily what she can stash in a handbag or carrier bag?

AskReddit,fca2agm,t3_egaw70,1577561984.0,"I (22f at the time) couldn't get into my apartment because I couldn't find my key, so I walked across the hall to our neighbours apartment (22m x3) and walked straight in (they just never locked the door unless they were all out), I walked into one of their bedrooms, turn on his light, and rifle through his wardrobe to find something to sleep in, grab a t-shirt. Take my dress off. Take my bra off. Put the t shirt on, turn around and leave again, go into the hallway and decide to snooze on the chair there and just assume my flatmate will wake me up when she sees me at the end of the hall near our door when she gets home. Well then I get woken up by the guy who's t-shirt I helped myself, he hands me my dress and just turns around and walks off. Well he sent me a text message with every single excruciating detail and I have never been more embarrassed, I was very drunk but I didn't think he was home because I'd seen him at the club ten minutes before I left to walk home. Apparently that's an adequate amount of time for him to get home and fall asleep in his bed. Anyway that was quite the awkward conversation with my boyfriend the next day."

offmychest,fc3e8nk,t3_eftlkn,1577387858.0,"I feel this. I have been between 7 and 8 stone since I was 13 and sadly for me, post-baby that didn't change (I dropped the small amount of weight I gained with Pregnancy by the time my baby was 12 weeks old and I was absolutely gutted), I can't do impact exercise due to injuries and used to swim 3x a week for my mental health. Then I got sick and I'm at the lowest weight I have ever been in my adult life and now can't even go swimming because I am so ashamed of how I look, I am eating until I feel sick every day and still not gaining. Having people pass comment on your body is inappropriate no matter what body type you have, but when you're skinny you're just supposed to act like it's ok to be critiqued and any small progress commented on - it just makes me feel ten times worse when I inevitably lose that small amount of progress. I also do not feel like I can actually complain about how I feel.or how I look because in the past all I have got in return is ""but people would kill to look like you"" or ""people choose to be anorexic so they can look like you, they just take it a bit too far"". I have never had an rating disorder but it is certainly not a choice, and they do not choose to ""take it too far"", people literally die from EDs like anorexia and it's because people come out with these asinine comments about skinny = sought after, that people resort to disordered eating after a long battle with loving their bodies and feeling confident in themselves, but feeling down because of said asinine comments that people hear everywhere. I'm sorry you have similar experiences. At school people would insist I had to have an ED and that's the only reason I could possibly be that slim (I'll tell you, being told you ""look anorexic"" for years doesn't do much for your self confidence, even when you sit in the same lunch hall as they do, eating your lunch), then as an older teen and adult I am told people want to look like I do. I'd give anything to be a regular size 8-10, finding flattering clothes would be so much easier than it has been for me. 

I still don't go to the toilet after I eat, even if I'm desperate, because I don't want people to assume I'm going in there to hurl (which was always their excuse when I'd ask ""do you think i shoved the chicken sandwich, bag of crisps, apple, and crunchie bar up my ass Sarah, because you were sat at the same table and I think you'd have noticed the food going anywhere except in my mouth"" after some bitchy comment about my body). Anyway, I feel.a bit better now I've had a good rant. Swear under your breath, and roll your eyes while making a sarcastic and equally inappropriate comment next time, maybe they'll reconsider next time."
