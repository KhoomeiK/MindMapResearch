gainit,ff89ua0,t1_ff83vsq,1579670294.0,"5'6"" 135lb here (basically similar to OP). I started benching 65lb 5x5 and 6 weeks later I'm now up to 100lb 5x5. Using a 1RM calculator and bearing in mind I could do at least 8 reps if I kept going, those work out to 80lb -> 125lb over 6 weeks, which I'm pretty happy with. Regardless, I agree that 155lb is an insane starting bench for someone of OP's size."

Fitness,feizx7x,t1_fdi8odj,1579152029.0,"> For farmer carries, I don't carry heavier than 50lb db's. There's no need to carry more than 1/3 of your bodyweight for your dumbbells. That means if you weigh 200lb, then 60-65lb would be the max needed. 

Do you mean 1/3 of your bodyweight per dumbbell, or total? I weigh ~60kg and do farmers carrys with 2x17.5kg dumbbells but was thinking of moving up to 2x20kg or 2x25kg. What do you think?"
taiwan,feifg3w,t1_feg6xqd,1579137279.0,"You make a valid point, but at the same time, this isn't really equivalent. Every single student in Taiwan learns English for like 8 (or even 10?) years, while 99% of students in the US don't study even a single word of Mandarin. It's not unreasonable to expect that after spending a lot of time learning English, they should at least be able to cope with basic interactions.

It's worth mentioning though that my experience does not match OP's. I've found that the majority of Taiwanese, even older people, know enough English to help me out with directions or have conversations. Maybe OP has a thick accent or isn't good at simplifying their speech to make thierself more easily understood."

As long as you get enough calories (a few hundred above what you normally eat to maintain weight) and enough protein (80g minimum but 100g+ is idea) you're fine.

gainit,fdpnh3f,t3_eml6yi,1578633714.0,"OK I did read your whole post and I have some good news for you, this shit is way easier than people make it out to be. There's only really a couple of things you need to do:

1) Buy a set of scales and weigh yourself once per week, in the morning, after toilet and before breakfast.  
2) Eat enough calories. Either use an online calculator and count your calories attentively, or you can simply eat a consistent diet and use the weekly bodyweight measurements to let you know whether you're eating enough or not. If you're not gaining ~0.5kg/week then you need to eat more.  
3) Eat enough protein. Anything over 80g/day is ok and will be enough for you to gain muscle, but you should aim for over 100g if possible.  
4) Go to the gym. Try to be regular and go 3 times per week, but if you miss a day no big deal. Just get back on track the following day. As for what specifically you should be doing in the gym, there is a huge amount of conflicting information on the internet but I'd say you don't need to bother reading any of it at this stage. Just keep it simple and do the following: 

- pull-ups 5x5 (5 sets, 5 reps per set)
- bench press 5x5
- deadlifts 3x5
- bent over rows 5x5

Rest for 3mins between each set. With only these four exercises you hit all the main muscles in your body. For bench press, deadlifts, and bent over rows watch some YouTube or look online to learn the correct form (or ask a knowledgeable friend), and START WITH THE BAR ONLY. Don't worry about looking like an idiot. No-one cares. The real idiot is the person who tries to lift heavy before practicing the correct form and ends up injured. Besides, you'll be able to progress and start adding plates to the bar after a week or two. I started with just the bar (20kg) and I'm now up to 60kg on deadlifts and 40kg on bench.

Each gym session, do the same four exercises above. It should take around 1 hour. On the last set of each exercise, try to do an extra rep or two. If you can manage it, then it's a sign you can increase the weight on that exercise. If you've finished all four of these exercises and some of your muscles don't feel exhausted yet, maybe do some isolation exercises to wear them out before you leave the gym. 

Do the above and I guarantee you will see noticeable progress within only a month."
