awfuleverything,fdhmsdl,t3_elchau,1578425961.0,Who the hell just has some extra meth laying around? And why TF would anyone think it's a good idea to give it to a 7 year old. I'd rather let my kid have some lactose vs some dealers meth. This disgusts me

dogpictures,fdecnrk,t3_ekw9zt,1578336121.0,What a cutie. Rest in peace buddy. Sorry for your loss
BeforeNAfterAdoption,fddz4ad,t1_fddxvqb,1578327472.0,She has always been a sweetheart from day one. But in the beginning she did attack my little bischin twice which was scary. I think it was jealousy and protecting her food. Now they get along good. She still is jealous and doesn't really like other dogs
BeforeNAfterAdoption,fddj5xc,t1_fddiw6i,1578314379.0,I think she was only at the shelter for less than a week when I found her.
BeforeNAfterAdoption,fddj4iy,t1_fddijk1,1578314338.0,That was actually from our generous Reddit secret Santa this year!
BeforeNAfterAdoption,fddhegx,t3_ekm84b,1578312376.0,"Sandy was adopted from ACCT Philly, which is constantly at maximum capacity. Please, please, please....anyone who is in the Philly area consider checking out ACCT and adopting. You truly will be saving a life. Once ACCT reaches maximum capacity the hard decision is made to euthanize perfectly healthy animals. Sandy has brought so much joy into my families life and I am beyond thankful to have found her."
BeforeNAfterAdoption,fddfm8x,t1_fdcq9wk,1578310096.0,Thanks. And she was still producing milk when we brought her home. No puppies were found with her
BeforeNAfterAdoption,fddfkbm,t1_fdd37ol,1578310023.0,"It's crazy, but after I got her I was so sad for her and couldn't even bring myself to take her back to the shelter to be spayed. And I can't bring myself to ever crate her or board her. I always thought she'd be so sad to go back there, so I payed out of pocket for the spay"
BeforeNAfterAdoption,fddduh4,t1_fddbp8l,1578307622.0,"I've had numerous dogs before her, and she is by far the bestest most loving."

BeforeNAfterAdoption,fdddq3z,t1_fdd4nuk,1578307444.0,She was a foster fail! She wasn't even spayed when we took her home. Unfortunately where we got her from is constantly so full with animals. My intentions the day I saw her was to find the one dog with the least chance to get adopted and save that one...I think I did pretty good!
BeforeNAfterAdoption,fdddjle,t1_fdczl41,1578307177.0,She is about 8 or 9 now and I pray for many more years with her.
BeforeNAfterAdoption,fdddeyz,t1_fdcnoiz,1578306986.0,Sandy.
