fantasyfootball,ffgit7x,t1_ffg5qd7,1579907213.0,"It's worth it to me. Be comfortable keeping Lamar in the 4th or the 3rd even. His touchdown rate will likely regress but you can count on around 3,200 passing yards and 900 rushing yards for the foreseeable future. 

In standard fantasy, 900 rushing yards is equal to 3,600 passing yards in terms of points (1 point per 1 yard rush, 1 point for 25 yards passing).  

His consistency was also amazing last year. He very rarely had an off week.

fantasyfootball,ffghwvh,t1_fffuaff,1579906618.0,"I'm in the same boat with this question. I have an auction keeper league in which I will likely be able to keep 3 of the 4 of Chubb, Cook, Hopkins, and Kittle. 

Kittle will only take up half of the auction value of any of the other 3 which would give me more room to maneuver the rest of my roster. So I am leaning toward keeping Hopkins and Kittle then choosing between Chubb or Cook. 

If Hunt is gone, then for me it is a toss up between Chubb and Cook. But I am leaning Cook because he will have the benefit of retaining his head coach and Kubiak will move to OC, so Cook won't have to learn a new system and the blocking scheme will likely be intact. 

This also may be a shot in the dark but I wouldn't be surprised if CLV drafts a direct Hunt replacement in the draft."
