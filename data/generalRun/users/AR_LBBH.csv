jeffreestarcosmetics,ffpqm9z,t1_ffnvdph,1580102277.0,He also said at least one cosmetic item per box (exclusive) so the big box probably had two exclusive cosmetic items.

Sounds absurd, but I am very blessed and grateful. I was homeless less than a year ago.

Majority of people “on time” actually ended up being late and not getting anything. Christmas launch was just a total mess. But good luck to you on the valentines boxes! Let’s hope we both get something.

immigration,ffm1gmy,t1_ffkc3w2,1580047055.0,So when I apply for spouse visa I should apply for B2 as well??  Or are you saying that to enter the US again he needs a B2 period? There’s so many different comments here I’m just confused lol.
jeffreestarcosmetics,ffm0dv5,t1_ffk7ikn,1580046556.0,"Honestly I’d recommend the same I just recommended her. If you can afford the big one, definitely go for it, but at the same time I’d wait until late Thursday night to make your final decision since jeffree likes to throw bones here and there."
jeffreestarcosmetics,ffm09c1,t1_ffkcoc4,1580046478.0,"Well considering that, if you really want to grow your collection AND get a good bang for your buck, either go for the biggest box or the smallest box (whichever you can afford.)  I’d personally wait until the night before Friday before making your final decision because he’s prolly gonna throw us a bone soon.

Just make sure to be like 10 mins early to the launch and don’t have multiple tabs open if you’re logged into your jeffree Star cosmetics account. I made that mistake the last two launches. I had 3 tabs of jeffree Star cosmetics one on my phone, laptop, and computer and I didn’t get the item I wanted at all because I didn’t realize every time you get in line on a diff device while logged in- it just pushes you back in the queue. I’m still mad about that. I could have gotten conspiracy and the big Christmas box if I didn’t do that."

I actually have a mild form of OCD, which is being absolutely obsessed with everything being a perfect square aka everything has to equal 4 or I get anxiety.  I also have high functioning GAD (general anxiety) which often causes me to be irritable and constantly over plan things down to the tiniest detail, which also causes more anxiety and more obsessive behaviors.

Not liking something because it isnâ€™t in order is not OCD and itâ€™s aggravating to see people still acting like OCD is some kind of personality quirk in 2020. 

I only have obsessive related OCD behaviors and it hinders my life I absolutely could not imagine moderate to severe OCD. I also couldnâ€™t imagine using OCD in context like that."

You have to spend an additional $1000+ on buying additional meal credits depending on if you eat two or three meals a day.

My calculation for the $4700 was with only two meals a day.

Needles to say, if I live on campus Iâ€™m more than likely only gonna be eating one meal a day to save on food costs + stock the mini fridge with snacks."

Then try to figure out your undertone. Do you look pink or red? Do you look yellow or golden? Do you look like neither, or are you olive looking? Stare in the mirror.

You can use calculators etc but your own eyes are going to be more accurate. If you donâ€™t know any of this information I highly doubt whatever youâ€™re using now for foundation or concealer is a good match, no offense.

Look at your veins, are they blue, green, or blue green, or even purple?

What color jewelry do you look best in? Silver, gold, or both?

You could also go into a Sephora or ulta and test a few different concealers and foundations.

Test concealer on the inside of your arm, and foundation on your chest since some womenâ€™s neck are darker or lighter than the rest of their body naturally.  If your chest is abnormally light or dark, obviously donâ€™t do that and match to your face and neck only.

I wouldnâ€™t ask an employee for help, the lighting is usually pretty crap in the stores, and youâ€™ll want to see it all in sunlight with a camera once it dries down. Just  remember the color names and brand."

ApplyingToCollege,feyabpw,t3_eqtmzq,1579442925.0,"Yes. I remember the first time we were asked what do you want to be when you grow up. It was 1st grade and I wrote that I wanted to be a fashion designer, a business owner, a teacher, AND a mom.

In a way Iâ€™m still going to accomplish all of those things. My partner and I are interested in fostering/adopting once were done with school and financially stable.  Iâ€™m learning to sew currently (I used to know how as a child but forgot)  and I like making little pieces to wear here and there.  Iâ€™m also going into science education (specifically environmental science if I teach high school) fall 2020.

My partner is going to trade school. He already has the skill, just wants the qualifications. Weâ€™d be joint owners with renovations. He does all the heavy work and I deal with everything else. Things might change for him later and we might do our ideal business plan if things pan out correctly, but the renovation/carpentry business is our safety business.  If the other plan isnâ€™t an option we have that to rely on and heâ€™ll do well.  His older bro is looking to retire soon and will give him the company if he does his qualifications. 

These things never really changed for me. At times I focused on only one thing, but it was always one of those things. I found my love for teaching in middle school thanks to my amazing orchestra teacher and science teacher.  They went above and beyond  and Iâ€™m really grateful for being one of their students."

I have full tuition paid at any college in my state, I also get pell grant and a $500 state resident grant to help out with living expenses and books/fees. The university also offers $500-$1000 grant depending on if I live on campus or not. The CC has a  $250 grant but the fees are much cheaper. 

They actually end up almost the same price with the aid I get. About $1500 difference, but work study will cover that. 

The university is 1 mile away from where I live. The CC I was going to go to is 5 miles away.

Itâ€™s just a matter of I never even applied because I screwed around my first two years of hs  and tanked  my GPA. 

I donâ€™t know if this mean that I actually am accepted or if Iâ€™m just reading it wrong or something, because like I said, I didnâ€™t even apply. I was gonna do it just for fun but there was a application fee so I never submitted it.

Regardless of if the next blood palette is green, purple, orange, etc, Iâ€™m not buying right away. Now let me explain- in theory it sounds amazing and I want it, but I already have 6 palettes I need to use, and has a makeup newbie Iâ€™m not really into those kind of colors yet. If there was a more neutral palette or all singles in the near future, thatâ€™s what Iâ€™m going for.

When it comes to mystery boxes... Iâ€™m 100% buying every single one he releases. Is there issues with most of them? Absolutely, but you have to realize no matter what is in the box, you are getting an amazing deal. Thatâ€™s why I always shoot to go for every size of box when he does mystery boxes. Youâ€™re getting a huge discount with the boxes regardless of any issues, and thatâ€™s why I purchase them. Iâ€™m also more inclined to purchase limited edition items even if thereâ€™s issues.  I actually use all limited edition items, and if itâ€™s not a fit for my skin tone, you can always just trade with someone for something that is, or sell it. You really canâ€™t lose with these boxes. Iâ€™ve kept almost every item from MB except a few highlighters that just would never look good on me.  Metal straws? I love them and use them daily. Pop sockets? Not so much but I have replacement for when mine breaks! Stickers? Not at all but Iâ€™ll put it in a picture frame.

jeffreestarcosmetics,fedjvx1,t1_fecs6m2,1579013373.0,I think this is exactly it. Thirsty doesnâ€™t hold up to his newer releases and alien just isnâ€™t popular enough. I suspect androgyny to possibly go but beauty killer might get a redesign since itâ€™s his first palette ever?

Parenting,fe88xax,t3_enz70j,1578923858.0,"Stop giving him milk all together, they really donâ€™t even need nearly as much as parents give them. If heâ€™s lactose intolerant and youâ€™re giving him things that actively hurt his stomach and make it difficult for him, then it really just makes no sense?

Give him a plant milk if you feel he absolutely needs milk.  Cows milk doesnâ€™t even actually provide us with nutrients we need, they have to blend it into the milk. 

Expand his diet with good for him foods, more vegetables, less junk, and less sugar. Add fruits and seeds that help with digestion, such as flax seeds, chia seeds, prunes,  **real** apple juice (the dark kind not the light piss color or yellow kind) raisins etc.


karo syrup also helps, start out with 1-2 teaspoons and adjust how much based on its effectiveness. Mix it into a drink.

But seriously if heâ€™s lactose stop purposely causing him pain by giving him lactose. Lactose doesnâ€™t just make you have diarrhea when youâ€™re sensitive to it, it also hurts your stomach."

EntitledBitch,fe65u8k,t3_enn2yq,1578882460.0,"I hate tipping culture so much as an American. It is so stupid imo. 

They should be paid standard minimum wage just like every other employee in the establishment and tipping them only adds to the culture. I wish I had it in me to just not tip, because the business is  required to make up the minimum wage if they donâ€™t get enough tips

I hate tipping the shitty server who said hi in annoying tone and never once checked up, but I feel like an ass if I donâ€™t.

Or at the very least pay servers minimum wage and then have tips be optional again. Then Iâ€™d happily tip the good servers and not tip the awful ones. Maybe theyâ€™d be inclined to actually be a better server.

Unpopular opinion but tipping an awful server is like an angry upvote from me. I donâ€™t want to but I know I have to. 

And honestly? I donâ€™t have the money sometimes.  I donâ€™t always have transportation and I donâ€™t always have enough for delivery. Sometimes I have just enough to buy delivery and not enough to tip and it makes me feel like shit. Sometimes I want to just treat my shitty poverty experience and I donâ€™t have really have enough to tip, but I still deserve a little bit of joy, but now itâ€™s so toxic where if you donâ€™t tip, or at least donâ€™t tip well youâ€™re seen as the most toxic piece of shit on earth."
technicallythetruth,fe63yp3,t1_fe5sg1j,1578881253.0,In practicality it sounds like such a fragile relationship if youâ€™d end it over being asked to sleep on the couch after an argument. Like no bashing or anything it just seems like such a small thing to divorce over.

Not that many people knew of Ryland when they first were publicly a couple. He received backlash for years for only being with Shane for the fame and money, and honestly I was one of those people. He seemed super fake in the beginning but Ryland isnâ€™t a bad guy and he really does love Shane and a lot of his fans have come to realize that, so He isnâ€™t as hated as he used to be."

Honestly itâ€™s no problem. It took me years to figure out that you canâ€™t fix anyone, and nobody can fix you. You truly do have to at the very least like yourself and be positive to maintain a healthy relationship. I always thought that I would find the man of my dreams (I did) and I would be magically happily ever after just like the movies and shows I watched. It never happened that way. 

We never got outside help because it was stigmatized by both of our families. Itâ€™s the best thing thatâ€™s ever happened to the both of us. Itâ€™s HARD as fuck, itâ€™s STILL hard but weâ€™re committed to making the marriage last and weâ€™re currently going through a rebirth stage and going slow. Weâ€™re falling back in love with each other and at times it feels like the first time all over again, except we have bills."
ZeroWaste,fdzr295,t1_fdzqhr0,1578793844.0,"If youâ€™re moving out of your parents place for the first time, you donâ€™t have anything. Or say youâ€™re homeless or whatever the circumstances are. If you donâ€™t have anything, then itâ€™s much better to buy quality reusable cutlery off the bat. If you already have things and then decide to go zero waste and throw out all the things that arenâ€™t zero waste, or buy zero waste items of the things you already have, youâ€™re doing the opposite of zero waste. I mean how hard is that to get? 

Thereâ€™s nothing wrong with getting a sturdy metal cutlery set or even bamboo thatâ€™s going to last you a while IF you donâ€™t already have cutlery. And buying them doesnâ€™t mean they have to be brand new either. 

Thatâ€™s the entire point. 

When it comes to ANYTHING zero waste, if you do **not** already have the item, itâ€™s much better to buy the zero waste item. If you already have the item, you need to reuse what you have all that you can, then recycle if you cannot reuse anymore, and then buy the zero waste options, instead of just throwing away what you have and â€œstarting newâ€ with zero waste."

If he disliked it that much I feel like he would have left much sooner, or maybe he honestly tried hard to compromise and deal with it and just couldnâ€™t anymore. Regardless of any of that, itâ€™s still hard to believe. Not that theyâ€™re lying or I think itâ€™s fake, that their relationship seemed SO strong, I always felt like it would have to be a huge cheating scandal or abuse for them to split."

it wasnâ€™t easy for us and weâ€™re still healing but weâ€™ve been able to break the toxic cycle and weâ€™re still on the road of recovery. We had to learn to love ourselves first and then fall back in love with each other. We were unhappy together because we were unhappy with ourselves.

Jeffree didnâ€™t really go into detail and itâ€™s hard to believe such a strong relationship ended just because he didnâ€™t want to be in the spotlight but I respect that and I know weâ€™re not entitled to everything, but I truly hope the rumors of cheating are not true.

In the last video they did together I could see that Nathan was more off than usual in the video and I was worried about their relationship then because he just seemed so unhappy to be there and more quiet than usual. 

I just hope that 2020 can be a better year for the both of them, they went through so much in 2019 and they just deserve a break for once."
