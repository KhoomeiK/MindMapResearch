todayilearned,fecmol5,t1_fecinl2,1578977723.0,"There are always new groves being found and often logged; for example Canada's second largest Douglas-fir was recently found as the only tree left standing in an old-growth clearcut near Port Renfrew, which isn't even a particularly remote part of the island. The ancient forest alliance tries its best to document exceptional unprotected groves to avoid them being logged unnoticed, I believe they have a whole page of the biggest stumps (which again, are not from the most remote areas). It is true that the Island's original forest was mostly logged, however that only proves that we should protect what's left."
todayilearned,feceoal,t1_fec7dzg,1578972121.0,"I don't see much protection out here on the island, the companies all have their annual allowable cut and cut whatever the fuck they want as more and more old-growth is auctioned off by the government.

In China, there are roughly  
53 million Chinese with schlongs bigger than 6 inches,   
115 000 Chinese with schlongs bigger than 7 inches,  
14 Chinese with schlongs bigger than 8 inches.

Not long ago the causes of disease were completely unknowable. How can we know that there is no combination of material that can create thought? Although there is still much to discover, we have progressively learned more and more about the way we think, how we arose, and even in creating our own ""artificial"" intelligence. Of course a list of materials won't tell you how someone thinks, especially since there is no real definition for what it even means to think. Who's to say we haven't already created thinking, learning, adaptive algorithms?"
