Stoicism,ffb9s5r,t1_ffb97x1,1579756520.0,"I am afraid stoicism is a way of life and not a tool or a technique. Here when I say ""observing"", its not because its bad situation. The situation can be good as well. Its a philosophy where you wont give the power for external things(either good or bad )to decide your mood/expression."
Stoicism,ffb9gg1,t3_esdw56,1579756110.0,"You could start with magnum opus of stoicism ""Meditations "" by Marcus Aurelius. Then you can move to Seneca's Letters.

I would not encourage reading Epicurus until you are on good grounds"
Stoicism,ffb7db1,t3_esc57h,1579753822.0,"One more take on this would be like understanding the main difference between ""judgement "" and ""observation"".

90% of the time, we do judgement not because we are shrewd but judging things and people gives our brain where to put them in hierarchy of importance. It happens like very fast. Say you meet a guy who you come to know is boss of your boss, suddenly next time you see him you automatically become polite, this is because your brain kept him up above the ladder. These are basic instincts.

Now what a real stoic would do is not judge things but observing the things. There's a difference here, when you observe the things, you are not letting the person in observance to affect your behavior. It means when you observe things you choose not to get influenced by them. 

When a stoic sees his boss's boss outside workplace, he just waves a hi or something and leave the guy to his own privacy rather than bringing drama to the situation."

CrazyIdeas,ff65sqb,t3_errw0e,1579619823.0,"I heard that in China if you are a traveler roaming in rural/remote areas then chances are that you pretty much end up getting disappeared. Nowadays a new trend has begun, it is much official way i suppose,  what would happen is that you would be kidnapped and false cases are booked on you and for fews crimes trials are not needed so you stand in a death row and then there you go, you are wanderer after death i.e., you become a donor.

They say that these rackets are powerful and that you could get nothing done against this judicially. The fact that you dont need a trial itself is explanatory on how system works there."
