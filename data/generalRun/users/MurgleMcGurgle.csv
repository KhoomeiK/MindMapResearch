GlobalTalk,ffta8hc,t1_fft7rj0,1580214160.0," > Because that’s going off the assumption that ASL only exists as a code of English, which is incorrect.

It seems you've taken offense to that person's question but this is a pretty big assumption. It's common for idioms to leap from one language to another. Saying ""bon appetit"" doesn't imply that English only exists as code for French, it's just a phrase borrowed from another language. English has borrowed plenty of phrases from other languages so it's easy to assume that other languages do the same."
