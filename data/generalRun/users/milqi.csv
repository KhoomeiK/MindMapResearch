We can get them to pay us....

>I don't want to hear it! the president said of dissenting information.

Trump seemed to have no idea what'd happened in Honolulu. ""Throughout,"" Garner says of the book, the president ""is misinformed and confused while at the same time utterly certain of himself.""
