AnimalsBeingJerks,felch09,t1_fcz87lg,1579218932.0,"I’m pretty sure that when one of my dogs who is a blue staff went to the vet when we got him from someone else when he was around 1-1/2. I’m pretty sure they asked about him having some traits of ‘aggressive’ dog breeds e.g his bigger bulkier body, the more pronounced dip in his head. Stuff like that to determine if he was a safe enough percentage to not be considered as a dangerous dog. But because my blue staff is a lot bulkier compared to a normal Staffordshire bull terriers as I also have another brindle Staff and despite being older he is a lot smaller compared to his little brother. 
It was really scary when I found out as I was scared for my poor dog that he may have been taken away and euthanised for being considered a dangerous breed. 
Simply because of people seeing animals with those traits being used, trained and neglected into acting out and being aggressive and I’ve seen first hand dogs raised aggressively. 
When I was younger I would go over to let’s say ‘Lisa’s’ house we would have to avoid a room upstairs as the dog was locked in the room. He was very scary he was a full Pitbull breed and he was an absolute tank and as a kid I remember he would growl if you came by the door. It was terrifying but one time he escaped the room when Lisas son who was the owner of tiger who had another friend over that day with his dog who was also the same breed who I think was called shadow? not to sure about that one. But I remember seeing tiger run out of the back door while I was at the end of the garden where the other dog was just sniffing about when tiger just growled they locked eyes and they were ready to tear each other apart as that was what they were taught to do. Honestly it was crazy to say the least the noise was the scariest bit...well second to seeing Lisa and her son trying to pull these two dogs apart. They’re malicious and not a breed you want to mess with if they aren’t properly trained or even just not being used to being around other dogs or people is not healthy for any animal no matter the breed.  Although a lot of people with these types of ‘dangerous’ breeds myself and most all of the people I ask agree with me that the majority of them are just the softest, dopiest, loving breed out there. I really do believe that the way you treat your animal definitely has a massive impact on their personality and if you’re nasty and negative to your animal then their behaviour reflects that 100%"
