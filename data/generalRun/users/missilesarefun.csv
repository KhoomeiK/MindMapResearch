Starblastio,fczpp0g,t1_fcz7wln,1578106401.0,"Alot of Starblast players dont like you and your group because not only are you stackers and ruin games, you do nothing to try and balance games you just hold each others hands and never fight each other. Join opposing teams ffs instead of blowing each other all the time."
Starblastio,fczp7zv,t1_fcx1ypn,1578106149.0,"Let me explain what a stack really is, Dimed is a stacker so he will be biased. A stack is when one team is loaded with really good players while the other team has none or few, this leads to the game being a boring one sided affair. 
Stacks happen intentionally or by accident. Not all stacked games can be avoided but players can take steps to keep the game fun and competitive, the Starblast community is small so any team or group can seriously unbalance the gameplay.
For example there is a group called ""the badgers"" or stackers as I like to call them. They always play with each other, this group consists of ~10-15 players, they are all really good and many are pros. They will stack games and just run through everyone instead of helping the game to be more competitive. They also have a habit of ruining games by flooding in on games that are ongoing and ruin hard fought victories.
So essentially a stack is a team that overpowered, it makes games boring for anyone who encounters stackers."
