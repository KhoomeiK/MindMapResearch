politics,fgtcrq3,t1_fgt53zm,1581102699.0,"My husband is an inventory manager at a big box store. The days they are closed are: Christmas Day. They are technically closed on Thanksgiving but they open at like midnight the day after so employees have to go in on Thanksgiving to prepare.

Hell, they can get favors from the alumni office itself that ought to suffice - they would not like the PR hit of an alum on the streets.

The premise of the OP is that they don't have access to anything their employee wouldn't have. So they can't use this."

I used to have a side business where I made custom hand made quilts. They were NOT cheap because a) I was damn good, and b) nice fabric is expensive, $9+ a yard at the very least. ""Why do yours cost so much when I can get a queen size one at Walmart for $30?"" :|"

AskProfessors,fgqq6p7,t3_ezz36d,1581029163.0,"I used to be a public school music teacher and now I am in teacher ed at a primarily teaching-focused (not research) institution.

**Pros of higher ed**: I do NOT HAVE TO DEAL WITH PARENTS (this is such an enormous plus that I want to give it three times the weight). I don't have car duty, bus duty, hall duty, breakfast duty, lunch duty, or any other supervision type duties.  I don't have to participate in dress up ""spirit"" days. I am not treated as the break or prep period for the ""real"" teachers. If I finish my class 2 minutes early I don't have to come up with a time filler. I can just let the students go, and not have to wait for them to be picked up by their classroom teacher like I did in public school. Most of my colleagues are great, though there is one department bully. Not having to write sub plans or turn in lesson plans.

**Cons of higher ed**: I don't know what my teaching load is going to be from one semester to the next. I might be given a new prep with 2 days notice, or I might lose a class at the last minute. Also the scheduling is ridiculous. I might have an 8 am class on the same day that I also have a 5pm class that gets out at 9pm, then off to see a student teacher at 8 am in a district an hour away. By the way, I currently have EIGHT student teachers in FOUR different school districts (on top of teaching FOUR classes). I filled out my travel authorization for this semester and I'm driving over a thousand miles this semester solely for student teacher supervision, and our mileage reimbursement doesn't really cover the wear and tear on your car. I made 10K more in public school (I taught in roughly the same geographic area where I am now, so it's not a cost-of-living thing). My state doesn't prioritize the maintenance of its public colleges and universities, so my building is currently falling apart and infested with mold. 

**Pros of public school:** I think I had more fun, at least with my youngest students (my upper level college students are fun, too) because most of them loved my class and eagerly participated. I made 10K more in public school. I had my own classroom that I could set up how I please and not worry about someone coming in and unplugging all the tech and leaving it a mess, stealing all the dry erase markers, or leaving chairs and stands scattered all over the room. I actually had a budget to buy stuff for my class. It wasn't big, but it existed (my budget for instruments and music is ZERO DOLLARS, and I haven't had a budget in the whole four years I've been at my current institution.)

**cons of public school:** all the damn DUTIES. Car duty, bus duty, lunch duty, hall duty, cafeteria duty, recess duty... there were years I felt I did more standing around and babysitting than I did actually teaching kids. Dealing with parents... God. I had less interaction with them because they  mostly didn't consider me a ""real"" teacher since I ""just"" taught music, but the ones who had a bone to pick were *vicious*. Lots of cliques and such among the faculty, and faculty pressuring others to buy MLM nonsense was frequent. Having to create substitute plans when I needed to be out was an enormous hassle."

TheSilphRoad,fgpctep,t1_fgok7nh,1581002185.0,"It doesn't take a lot of people to be a nuisance. Just a few who are real jerks.

Stop asking me why. I'm telling you what little I know. Nobody plays games in my classes, they are either ensembles you will get kicked out of or they are small seminars where you can't hide that stuff or they are literally out student teaching and are too busy. It isn't a problem for me. I PLAY THE GAME (NOT IN CLASS) AND LIKE IT. But I absolutely see why they want to stop people playing it on campus. People are making messes and blocking traffic and it's a nuisance. We have a small police dept on our campus. They don't have time to constantly be shooing people away for constant nuisance behavior. It's a waste of resources."
