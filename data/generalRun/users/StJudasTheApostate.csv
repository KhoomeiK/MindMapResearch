exchristian,fg1wsy8,t3_ewdkca,1580434391.0,"> One thing halting/nagging me is the purpose of life. I mean when I pull out Jesus, evangelism, eternal security, and the other usual suspects, I'm stuck as to what the purpose of life becomes.

First step is realizing that Jesus, evangelism, eternal security, etc are an artificial construct that has been placed upon you by others initially and consented upon by you eventually. That construct (i.e. christianity) is a foreign philosophy to the universal human nature and *you* found purpose of life in that, and now *you* have a choice to either continue associating that with how you perceive purpose in your life or to abandon it.

> If there are no absolutes (are there??) then it seems purpose is up for grabs. 

Sounds good to me.

> I have a hard time going with the ""whatever does it for ya"" solution because that opens the door for some pretty vile or sketchy or cultish or whatever purposes being okay

What is truly vile and sketchy and cultish is the god of the bible. 

> but that's all I can figure there is, short of some other absolute entity filling the void

Why limit you finding purpose in your life one absolute entity or another?"
