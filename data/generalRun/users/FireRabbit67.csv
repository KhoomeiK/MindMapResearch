Strategy 2 (Fire Squad Kachiyama)

Little to no treasures needed

Lineup: 4 relatively quick meatshields one being jiangshi cat, Rover cat, Octopus cat, cyborg. Anti floating cat (I used butterfly cat.) Fire squad Kachiyama (can be replaced by another anti alien uber). The last slot is up to you!! Bahumut is a good choice if you have him.
Items: They are not needed but if you want bring along a Cat CPU! It never hurts.
Start off by meatshielding and stacking paris. Continue to do this, when the peons are wiped out they should give you a bit of money so sent out some units to deal with Cli-One such as your anti alien/floating units and octopus cat to weaken.
If you have the money, send out a Fire Squad Kachiyama to keep him weakened. Keep spamming until the Ursamajor comes out. Let him kill Kachiyama and advance towards your base. Kachiyama should have come back by now, deal with him there with kachiyama and other good damage cats.
Focus back on killing Cli-One, spam and spam until she dies. If Elizabeth the LVIth comes out, thats ok! You have octopus cat to cancel the waves. Continue doing this until the base is destroyed. Congratulations! You beat chapter one moon and unlocked new cat-combo's! Now would be a great time to go and kill the perfect cyclone with octopus cat."

This was the last time I was ever gonna be at my old house since I was moving and we had the last stuff in the car, i reached across a log to grab my moms phone to take a photo of the butterfly since it was very picturesque, and stepped on some leaves. Thought nothing of it until I started feeling stings. I had the largest adrenaline rush of my life there. The property I lived on was a very wooded and beautiful area (stream running through down a waterfall to a lake) and there were smaller streams running through. I hopped over all of them at the fast speed I have ever ran in my life. I practically ran into my moms arms and she was trying to get all the hornets off of me and got most of, as only about 7 were still on me. I can’t even remember the pain, I think I stopped feeling pain at that point and I just felt numb and odd from the huge adrenaline rush. I raged to my new house and had to lay on a crappy futon for a while. We counted 24 bee stings and some smaller marks that could have been bites or maybe just partial stings(?) bees are fine though, it’s just hornets that suck"
