unpopularopinion,fet44x3,t3_eqh2c2,1579371658.0,"They should be taken *more* seriously than adults.

1) teenage years are some of the average human's most vulnerable years (body changes, hormones raging, social circles with peers become vital in parting with parents, and being rejected can kill self esteem), and being struck down here does more damage than as adult

2) any form of psychological damage in teenage years will likely be among the first experiences with complex emotional challenges, which means they will be less resilient than someone who gone through it many more times (say, an adult)

3) they are less mature (brain is still developing, and will continue to, until their 20's) than adults, and should therefore have even more support to get through it

4) the earlier you can address mental issues, the better. The more bad experiences you have, the easier it is for them to solidify and become a more integral part of the person, thus making it even harder to address

So yeah, I agree."
