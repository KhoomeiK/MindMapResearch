Veterans,feomycb,t3_eq06i9,1579302433.0,"I didn’t “witness” it but was almost on the receiving end of an army guy NDing a 203. It went through his tent, bounced off the post of another, and landed 3 feet away from me on the other side of my tent. They walked in and said “hey uh.... there’s a live 203 round outside your tent. You may want to leave”. So I got to sleep on a treadmill that night while we waited on EOD to get there to dispose of it"
YouShouldKnow,feidvbc,t1_feico2f,1579136214.0,"Eating them, especially wild game, is also a way of making sure they stick around as well as prevent them from over populating. You do you but imma keep hunting and eating them tasty animals.

There have been tons of species and environments that have been saved due to hunting and conservation. A lot of species in Africa would be gone if it wasn’t for hunting. The fact that it brings in tons of money makes people breed them and preserve them is a good thing"

MMA,fehvpnc,t1_fehvcy4,1579124811.0,So shove them in a bucket or something and go to town or what? I’m not quite envisioning how to do that without getting a bunch of dirt in it or something

I’ve always thought it was funny how a lot vegetarians and vegans say “I won’t eat meat but here is a recipe that makes it taste like the real thing”.  This burger also as waaaaaaaay more ingredients that just the beef burger. Cmon.... simple is better"
YouShouldKnow,fedync8,t1_fedtju1,1579022660.0,"Believe what you want but all I’m saying is look at the ingredients. Antihistamines are used almost exclusively in over the counter sleep aids. Most everything else is prescription. I’m not talking about nyquil, which has other ingredients like acetaminophen and cough suppressants, which should only be taken when you actually need them and not as just a sleep aid since it will destroy your liver if taken regularly. That’s why they came out with zzzquil (also to make bookoo money by marking it up) they realized people were taking nyquil when they weren’t sick just to help them sleep and zzzquil, although still a marketing scheme (scamish), is “safer”."
YouShouldKnow,fedktj9,t1_fedji6y,1579014012.0,Best way i found to fight het lag from a trip like that was to just stay awake the whole time and go to sleep at the normal time in the new time zone. Kinda sucks since you stat awake so long but it almost instantly resets your clock to the new time zone if you make sure you don’t over sleep

If melatonin works for you then take it but clinical trials have shown that it has no different affect than a placebo. It’s broken down before your body can absorb it."

Showerthoughts,fe8ph1i,t1_fe84v0k,1578928868.0,They OK sign below the waist is literally just a game- if you make the sign and your buddy looks at it you get to hit them in the arm. It’s essentially the “made you look!” Game. Some variations allow you to break the circle and if you do you get to hit the person that made it.

specializedtools,fdguep0,t1_fdgoent,1578408579.0,"They are different because we domesticated them but very specific breeding can cause them to grow extremely fast and pack on a lot of meat, even without/before hormones. The birds have changed drastically just in the last 50 years from selective breeding. You can see the same thing with other animals like the liger (tiger and lion mix), they are MASSIVE.

There is actually a specific mix of 2 breeds that causes the offspring to do that, in fact if you don’t slaughter them by a specific age they will grow so large so fast they can’t walk and may even break their legs from the load. Even with “free range”. So killing them quickly is actually being humane so they don’t starve to death from being immobile or catching diseases and infections from breaks and not being able to move away from their own filth."

AskReddit,fd36qiw,t3_ejro6w,1578155221.0,"Me and my sister had the best summer ever with my grandmother when I was 14, did all sorts of awesome trips. She asked us for a list of things we always wanted to do and we just went and did them. It was amazing. 

4 months later she passed away very suddenly. Looking back it’s like she knew somehow that she was going to die soon and wanted our last summer with her to be the most memorable. That’s been almost 15 years and those are still some of my fondest memories."
todayilearned,fd353c5,t3_ejwxed,1578154783.0,"People at my church always praise me when I take care of my kid, like take him outside if he is screaming or to change his diaper, or just holding him and making sure he isn’t ripping out moms hair. I think it’s stupid. “Wow your so great with your kid”. No.... it’s part of my job as a father. Don’t praise me for something everyone should be doing. Just because your husband sucks doesn’t mean I deserve praise for basic stuff. It should be expected. 

Between me and our family that came my wife didn’t change a single diaper for the first 2 weeks of his life while she was recovering and I changed every diaper in the hospital. 

Think about it. Do you want to be the only one taking care of your child? No. No one does. We all need help. So take responsibility for the life you helped bring into this world and help. There is also TONS of research that shows that having a good father figure and good discipline will prevent a lot of problems we have with children, teens, and adults."
