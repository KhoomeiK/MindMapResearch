aww,ff9r6ck,t1_ff9q8kp,1579719268.0,"You'll be less terrified if you know different types of snakes. There's plenty of friendly snakes that eat garden pests. Head shapes are your best friend with determining the snake you're looking at so you can tell the difference between a viper and a python. They're also very soft and cool to touch. The scales feel slick like plastic. The way they move is really cool too, basically like a micro scale worm dance but where you only move the muscles inside. Feels neat when they climb around your hands. Just start looking at cute snake pictures and videos, then see real snakes at your local zoo and learn about them. Once you're comfortable look up different snake types and which you should avoid in your area, chances are you've got a variety of garden snake you could observe. They don't really care about people usually. Eventually work up to a gentle pet on the snake's back. Sometimes you just need a different perspective. I was creeped out by hairy spiders but now I think they're adorable. Slick ones hell no but fuzzy ones absolutely. I'm almost ready to hold a spider after years of exposure. It's possible to overcome, some snakes yes be afraid but a good chunk are just adorable noodles."

Out of the four birds I've tamed, one wouldn't be tamed until we forced him to be held like a little ice cream cone, one was curious enough to ask to come out and play but needed to be forced to understand that scritches were amazing and that only took a week, one had taken four years to be ready to fully tamed (bathroom step up practice but still so scared, finally accepting coming out of his cage for love, he's still being worked with but he's the best mohawk baby), and the last one was already mostly tamed but is incredibly territorial and that will never change as it's just a quaker thing. 

You just gotta take the general knowledge of each video and personalize it. No two birds will be the same. If you do it when they're young babies it's easier, see bird #2 above his cere was still purple when training him, but it can be done with adults, see bird #3 who only started to let me pet his head after he got his mature beak marks.

The pilots did what they needed to in order to keep their passengers alive. So rather than have a few hundred dead we have a few that got hurt from a fuel dump. 

Don't worry about responsibility. Pilots have to be trained to do whatever they need to in order to land safely.

Now I hate what Disney is doing but I did go see Frozen 2 twice because my family wanted to see it.

How do I follow you into the unknown?"" Using a different influence to encourage a desire to change and a curiosity to seek change rather than politics, instilling the value of change (which most of the movie is about) at a young age will prove helpful to combat this absolutely batshit greedy boomer mentality we are faced with in modern society. 

The overall dumbest generation, the subject of awful social experiments, have money, lots of money, and these other boomers want it. So they're going to try these same social experiments again to create even more dumb people who fear change. Thanks to the internet we can call people out and force change individually so this tactic might not work unless they wall them in and actually abuse their kids.

It's emergency vet right away before she gets toxic shock and dies. Lots of calcium prevents that, funny enough you feed them eggs to keep that up. She loves dried egg mix."
science,fejay5m,t3_ep702c,1579164832.0,"When I cook food I tend to set the kitchen on fire. Not with the oven thank God but usually the stove. Once the microwave. I'm very low income and barely surviving when it comes to home cooked meals, I don't eat out, can't afford to. What I can do is my work's meal plan. They feed us a very healthy meal of our choice for only $3, cheaper than if I went and got the same things myself and made it at home. I'll be honest if it wasn't for my job I wouldn't be able to eat any leafy greens. (Not iceberg lettuce. They give us spring mix.) I can't buy things that perish super fast because of how alone I am."

worldnews,fej8lj2,t1_fej8igt,1579161577.0,Spreading information is doing something. A lot of people have no fuckin clue the conservative world is controlled by this one guy.
FuckBlizzard,fehn0fz,t1_fegpq7d,1579119843.0,Not asia but China is a possibility as other companies are pulling out.
raisedbynarcissists,fefy6yu,t3_eooitr,1579069196.0,Every time someone posts this it needs to be heard. All these poor kids who're suffering need to hear this every day. All you adults getting help need to hear this.
FuckBlizzard,fef6tcf,t1_fef6hk8,1579049546.0,"Yes but at the same time no. Overwatch is still my favorite game despite all of this so I'm being hopeful that out of all the companies pulling out of china Activision-blizzard will be one. I didn't delete my account but I haven't returned to the game at all since early October. My friends have even stopped playing because their best Lucio has stopped. Not the right reason but hey it's something. They've tried to convince me to return but one friend, Caleb, has been standing hard ground by my choice, saying I'm doing the right thing and shouldn't give in.

Edit To the downvoters:

The player count, money being made from loot boxes, server space, is still decreasing when you don't play. You don't need to delete the account. I spent far too much money on the game to just throw it away completely. The temptation isn't really there. The day blizzard returns to America is the day I'll start back up, tears falling onto my desk, my keyboard lights turned to green, white, and yellow for my favorite hero. 

To make this analogy into more simplified terms, just because there's a Chick-fil-A nearby my work doesn't mean I'm eating there, and it doesn't mean my company isn't funding housing for LGBT youth who were disowned by their families. My time, money, and resources are still going towards the good while evil sits on the corner saying ""just one chicken sandwich won't hurt"" yet I'm looking it in the eye, shaking my head, and saying, ""fuck you."" 

I believe in change, I'm still holding onto that hope despite the odds. But I'm much stronger than you think. I'm no stranger to cutting things from my life for good, I'm just playing Aaron Burr and waiting for things to get better before doing something stupid."
FuckBlizzard,fef3p0m,t3_eom5ou,1579047437.0,"It's not, the fanboys just move on to the next shiny thing. The kids with no moral ambiguity stayed, the people who care about humanity left and are watching blizzard with hopeful spirits that maybe they can play their favorite game again or they don't care about Activision-blizzard at all and want to watch it be destroyed, the humanitarian issues being the thing that broke the shelf. 

I look at my old shot glasses with sadness in my eyes. It makes me feel like a monster to own the original support set."
aww,fef383m,t3_eoqz19,1579047123.0,Awww beautiful lynx point. One of my favorites. Give him a good head scratch for me.

Bad_Cop_No_Donut,fecsqhh,t1_fecsl20,1578983172.0,Don't know where you're from but here that is how it is. It bars the poor from getting in.
Bad_Cop_No_Donut,fecsi98,t1_fecrclq,1578982928.0,I've been wrapped up in inner police drama for 2 years now. Hopefully my aunt divorces the bastard... Police academy is expensive and you do need to pay for it. One of the former family friends put a GoFundMe out to pay for a semester for someone else. Yeah they're not our friends anymore... Took the money and ran.
