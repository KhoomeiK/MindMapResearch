If you're a non local business not contributing to help the city heal don't use ""El Paso Strong"" for anything other than fundraising money and providing support for victims. Maybe I'm a bit cynical but this feels more like profiting off of tragidy."

todayilearned,fdbjsdm,t1_fdbe37f,1578258062.0,"It's not a lie really, it's just to keep a few separate small business form coming together and saying they are one with different locations to get a better discount.

The truth is Coke only cares about large business, that's where they make their money. Small businesses have to pay for the ""privilege"" of selling coke. 

I personally would like coke to have better pricing for small business because it would keep them out of my stores cleaning out my shelves, but I get why small business owners are doing it.

The price hike has been killer across the board but since most of the cost in coke is packaging and aluminum just keeps getting more expensive and 12 pack cans is the base  of the business everything went up. It sucks"
todayilearned,fdbdyzj,t1_fda4oii,1578256476.0,"I do large store ordering for Coke (ORM) so I can see what an outlet is paying per case. I also know that Pepsi has lower case costs than us. My smallest outlet pays $18 a case of 20oz but they have the smallest volume discount since its only a single store. So even if Little Ceasars is buying directly from Pepsi they are getting a pretty good volume discount, but I doubt they are actually buying straight from their local Pepsi. 

I've also worked at Papa John's a while ago, who did not get their soda from Pepsi directly but through Papa John's distribution. It's the one thing they got that did not have a large ""Papa"" tax, I can't rember the case cost cost but it was something like <15 bucks for 20oz cases. 
Papa johns bought from Pepsi in large quantities to get a max volume discount since it bought by the pallet and only required pepsi to drop at a single location.

Granted this is all going to be based on regional markets.

Yes fountain service is a great money maker, Little Ceasars is making a pretty penny on their soda."
todayilearned,fd9zffj,t1_fd9wc9b,1578239878.0,Bottled soda is almost pure profit. A case (24) of 20oz soda cost 12-15 bucks they sell them at $2 each. 2 liters cost $5-7 a case (8) and sell for $3  each.
