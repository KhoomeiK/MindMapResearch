MakeupAddiction,ffa857w,t1_ff9q2yh,1579729746.0,Did they really?? I don't see it anywhere
MakeupAddiction,ff8hzub,t1_ff8flhh,1579679361.0,"This is true, I've seen at least 3 different black women working there over the past few months... Imagine being an employee and not even being able to enjoy the gratis other employees are offered! This actually pisses me off more than my situation does"
MakeupAddiction,ff8bphn,t1_ff8bi61,1579672095.0,"I'll call and see if I can find out who to email. I'm not big on Twitter or Insta, so if anyone wants to @ them and link this I'd be appreciative"
MakeupAddiction,ff8bgfq,t1_ff8ajjz,1579671841.0,"I don't think so, but I can't honestly say for sure. Just from looking at the display, I could tell that they were all way, way too light for me so I didn't bother swatching/looking at the bottles too closely after that"
MakeupAddiction,ff8a79g,t1_ff89mt9,1579670634.0,How can I find the store manager's email? We don't have an Ulta anywhere near here but we do have several MAC stores. I'll just stick to shopping there instead.
