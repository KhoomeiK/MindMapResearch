politics,fffc4g0,t1_fff4ofk,1579880700.0,"Hitler and other ""evil"" leader at least gave of an image of power. Trump only projects weakness. The way he reacts to critizism just screams insecurity. His body language looks the like if he is about to be sent to a death camp. Its insane that anybody can see him as a leader. It has made me see americans in a completly different way. That they elected him to represent them just tells me they are completely broken."
