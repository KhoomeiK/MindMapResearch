Yes, Trump's presidency will be spared by this non-trial. But he will not be exonerated. Far from it. He will be remembered forever as a traitor, and those who supported him or enabled him (for six months, for one year, for three) will be forever branded as traitors along with him. They (you) will forever bear that mark. Traitors. Traitors to this nation that all of us call home. 

Donald J. Trump's name will supplant Benedict Arnold's in history books of the future when the subject of ""treason"" crops up.

Whether we keep the Peace Corps in China or not, these atrocities will continue to happen. Without the Peace Corps, however, there will be one less voice guiding students toward independent thought, inspiring curiosity about the outside world, and offering an understanding of what it means to be ... non-Chinese. All of this sounds pretty cheesy and simplistic, but in some of these megalopolises out in the center of the country (where the population is 99.99% Han Chinese (as it was in my hometown of 1.3 million souls)), these sorts of interactions are invaluable.

That said: Peace Corps volunteers tend to go through a great deal more ""filtration"" than people who accept private gigs abroad. There is a rigorous screening process; they want to know all about your education, your work background, your medical history, your aspirations. It is sometimes a six-month to year-long process, all told. I, on the other hand, have landed gigs in South Korea that took a grand total of six weeks to secure, application to visa. (This, of course, is no longer the case -- but standards remain comparably low in parts of China.) 

This is not to say that one type of person is intrinsically better than the other, but the Peace Corps does a pretty excellent job of screening out people who are not likely to do an effective job. Volunteers also pass down traditions: one volunteer builds a community; the successive volunteer inherits that community and builds upon it, and so on. This is not always (or often) the case at private English academies.

peacecorps,femmw26,t1_femihpz,1579263056.0,"I definitely agree that China's worked its way up into a position where volunteer English teachers are no longer needed. That's been the case for a while. That said, Peace Corps volunteers tend to be much more integrated into their communities, relative to individuals who venture to the Mainland to save some cash and pay off student loans, to get out of the country for a year or so, or simply because they stumbled across a job posting online and went for it -- not that there's anything wrong with those arrangements, either.

The caliber of people I had the pleasure of serving with in the Peace Corps meant that our students and our communities were interacting with human beings who were a cut above. Of my cohort of 75 volunteers, I would still consider about forty or fifty of them good friends, a few of them my very best friends -- and with perhaps two exceptions, they were all truly wonderful, compassionate, and dedicated people.

That pesky Peace Corps application process ensures that most volunteers are the cream of the crop, and often bring a great deal of travel experience to the table: so these are individuals who know how to make things happen, how to integrate with a community (no matter how exotic), and to make more of their service than the bare minimum requires. The vast majority of Peace Corps volunteers I met were natural cultural ambassadors. In terms of bridging the gap between Chinese and American cultures, a group of qualified and highly motivated Peace Corps volunteers is going to do a great deal with their service -- and develop much stronger connections with their communities -- than someone who shows up in a strange town with no real Peace Corps culture, where (even if they are determined to branch out) it can be insanely difficult to forge the sorts of bonds that help facilitate that all-important intercultural exchange.

Perhaps it's time for Peace Corps to move on, and I've heard rumblings that it's becoming less safe (politically speaking) for PCVs in China -- so the decision to scrap the program may have more to do with China's more recent political changes. Nevertheless, it's a bittersweet farewell to a unique service opportunity and a program that helped (for twenty-three years) bridge the gaps between two of the most distinctive cultures on earth."

Abundant free time. Reasonably comfortable accommodations. There are the usual challenges of acclimating to a new culture -- exhausting in their own right, but not exactly a forty-hour work week. 

After you've gotten in the flow of it, though -- all that shite about *the journey and not the destination* and what have you -- I find that you begin to stop guilt-tripping yourself, and begin to accept the fact that socializing, becoming a fixture of the community, taking on aspects of the local culture and satisfying the curiosity of the people around you when it comes to your own cultural idiosyncrasies: that's a big part of the job. In certain countries, that *is* the job. An especially nebulous job, but a job nonetheless.

This, of course, is all very different in countries where you *are* administering vaccines to screaming babies.

I can understand people holding the position that the Peace Corps never belonged in China in the first place. My comrades and I discussed this quite a bit. There wasn't much structure to it; most of us taught without textbooks, and trying to reach fifty students per class with whichever lesson plan you managed to cobble together over the weekend isn't quite ideal. At the same time, because so many cities are experiencing population booms -- the rural poor making their way into the metropolis -- you wind up being someone's ""first foreigner"" pretty much every day, and to be able to leave a favorable impression is a powerful thing that shouldn't be underestimated."

When I was twelve or so, pogs were all the rage. (I'm sure this dates me a bit, but I imagine I'm in similarly ancient company.) My sister and I would badger my mom and dad constantly for pogs. It was a pre-adolescent status symbol thing. You couldn't just have twenty pogs, after all. You needed several tubes of them. And then you needed slammers. And then you needed *expensive* slammers. And so on.

On one particularly greedy afternoon, my sister and I coerced our dad into driving us fifteen miles across town to a specialty pog shop at the mall. Even as far as pog splurges went, I knew that this was a bad one. My dad wound up spending sixty bucks on us, all on pogs, and I wound up feeling dirty all the way back home.

When we arrived back in the suburbs, my dad pulled up to the driveway and all four of our animals - orange cat, tortie cat, tuxedo cat, and *basset hound* \- were out running around the front lawn. None of them had ever really escaped with any success, and there they all were: the cats squatting like Russian hats here and there across the lawn, and the dog wagging her tail and sniffing their asses. 

A wind storm had somehow kicked a couple of doors open, resulting in the mass exodus. For a twelve-year-old, realizing that all of one's pets could have run away forever was about the most anxiety-inducing thing imaginable. I never nagged my dad for pogs again. It made me feel filthy. Today, buying anything of worth makes me feel that way. And I'm still left to wonder just how long those animals bumbled around in the front lawn like goofs, when (by all laws of pet-dom) they should have scattered to the four winds.

alcoholism,fdlbpsf,t3_eluy01,1578520617.0,"I'd be curious to see the statistics (if any exist) with regard to the number of deaths that result from alcohol withdrawal. Perhaps these fatalities are lumped in with the ""alcohol overdose"" deaths, but alcohol withdrawal -- to my mind, at least -- should be regarded as its own category. It is not simply ""drinking oneself to death."" It is a cluster of (horrific and sometimes lethal) symptoms that occur when a chronic drinker abruptly quits drinking without either tapering safely down or receiving proper medical care.

Alcohol withdrawal -- based on a lot of the questions that pop up on this forum and others -- is a condition whose dangers far too many at-risk drinkers appear to be unaware of. It is also -- based on my own personal experience -- something that some ER physicians and detox facility employees (including nurses) do not seem sufficiently equipped or knowledgeable enough to properly treat.

Either way, alcohol withdrawal is a public health crisis. Problem drinkers need to be made aware of how to detox safely and effectively. The staff members of our hospitals and detoxification facilities need to take withdrawal more seriously than it is currently regarded. The attitude I've encountered is: ""You've gotten yourself into this mess; you deserve to suffer."" Addiction is addiction; at least 10% of Americans are substance abusers. We need to treat it like the mental health issue that is, or keep repeating the mistakes we should've learned during the abortive War on Drugs."

1. We have somehow managed to make Iran -- one of the most sinister regimes on Earth -- look like the ""good guys,"" because they showed restraint and deliberation where our leadership demonstrated extreme impulsiveness and incompetence.

2. We have somehow managed to unify Iranians -- and the rest of the Shia world -- against us, when mere weeks before, those same Iranians were storming the gates and threatening to topple the regime. 

3. Trump (and his media outlets, and blind followers like yourself) are rebranding this a victory, when we (less than 24 hours ago) were attacked with extreme precision by Iranian ballistic missiles that could, easily, have caused mass casualties.

My second thought was different: though I had embraced the idea of my own death, I began to think about the people I would leave behind. My parents, for one, would live out the rest of their lives as shells of themselves. My sister, my friends -- even the Georgian villagers I had come to know and (to some degree) love over the preceding ten months -- would all be devastated by my loss, and I owed it to them to survive somehow. I might be content with, even soothed by death: but I knew that nobody else in my life would be.

And then the movie reel kept rolling. The car flew off the cliff, rolled several times, and I began cursing up a storm. I clunked my head on the ceiling and was momentarily dazed. The windshield exploded and I wiped shards of glass from my eyes. Then it grew quiet. There came a sudden rush of gravity that seemed to pull my stomach up into my esophagus and we landed upside-down in a ditch.

I spent several minutes, ass on the ceiling, prodding myself for the internal wounds that I figured would be my undoing. But there was nothing wrong with me. Not a scratch. The driver had survived, too. He helped me crawl out of the wreckage. The car looked like a smoldering cigar.

For the next few hours, I was abuzz with a kind of electricity: pure excitement to be alive. Of course, that fades over time -- you get back into your routine and resume taking days, weeks, months, entire years for granted. But every once in a while, I crawl back into that mental space and remind myself why I'm here. And that is comforting for me.

AdviceAnimals,fdb14vz,t1_fdasoqd,1578252551.0,"Trump is one man: his worldview is grounded on hate. If you would like examples of this, I can certainly pick one from a 39-gallon Hefty brand garbage bag full of quotations, policy decisions, and personal behaviors that more than aptly demonstrate his nature as a hateful person.

To paint all who oppose Trump as hateful is a much harder claim to advance. You're asserting both that all who oppose Trump are on the left -- quite a few of them happen to be proper fiscal conservatives or ex-Republicans -- and that all those on the left subscribe to an agenda based on hatred. How would one even go about demonstrating this assertion?

The actions of one man -- demonstrated over a lifetime -- are much, much easier to pin down. Trump is a hateful person who advances hateful policies, and his supporters (as I said earlier) are, at best, tacit supporters of hatred."

I am not a hateful man. I am not a Christian, but I adhere to certain Christian values: not hating others is one of them. Nevertheless, I cannot support Trump because his worldview is one grounded in hatred, the deliberate stoking of tribal fears, and dividing others by way of attracting a particular type of person whilst rejecting all who disagree.

The fact that a great number of people strongly disagree with Trump does not mean that they _hate_ him or hate those who follow him. Trump, on the other hand, very deliberately espouses hateful ideas and draws those ancient hatreds out of others.

Again, you are welcome to disagree -- but I believe there is something fundamentally different about Trump's approach as a politician, the ideas embraced by his followers, and what an ethical outlook on the world ought to be."
