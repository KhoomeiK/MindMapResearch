todayilearned,fdrme5b,t1_fdqw6zr,1578686556.0,That's very nice and a perfectly fine show of gratitude. I'd say some airline miles thrown in would also be a nice little bonus.

todayilearned,fdqvbj6,t1_fdqrpe0,1578675396.0,That's so cool. I am sure the doc was excited to help. Do they get any official thanks or acknowledgement from the airline?

todayilearned,fdbljj4,t1_fdbf2ej,1578258512.0,One of the greatest jokes ever written.
specializedtools,fd6vhfc,t1_fd623ke,1578196242.0,"It's so fucking good. I know there is a real debate to have regarding what's best show ever, but for me it is The Wire. I have seen the others that are frequently mentioned too, and while fantastic this show is on another level. It can almost feel like a documentary, or even exploitative, to be entertained so to speak by what takes place in the show.

Also Season 3 and 4 are for my money the two best consecutive seasons in any show ever as well."
gifs,fd6oaji,t1_fd46kim,1578193732.0,"The 'jumps' @ ~1:33 if anyone's looking just for that.

I can't link easily, on mobile, if anyone wants to take to the time to post it directly I'm sure even folks lazier than myself would appreciate that."
politics,fcrcb0q,t1_fcr6pns,1577899905.0,"Yeah this thread is full of a scary amount of cognitive dissonance. If you want quietly believe in some magical sky fairy, so be it, but to even begin to mock others who believe in a slightly different version of a magical sky fairy just comes off as incredibly ignorant and even a little insane to a total nonbeliever like myself. It ALL is completely made up garbage, it's just that the degree to which people are willing to go for that belief happens to differ."
movies,fbuj1a3,t1_fbubk6y,1577115235.0,"This exactly. One opened near me and I was so pumped, but what a disappointment. Shitty, Applebee's quality food at twice the price, and literally nothing else that actually makes the Alamo Drafthouse experience what it is. Typical corporate rip-off that will fail and be blamed on the Alamo model just not being expandable, even though they've never actually tried the real model because that takes time and effort."
