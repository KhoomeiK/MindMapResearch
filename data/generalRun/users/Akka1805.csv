That really condenses the amount you write down and if you do it right it should just be the core stuff that ends up in your notes. I don't know how well it translates to humanities subjects but I got a 40 raw so it definitely helped me.

Also, the study design. Your teacher might emphasise some stuff more for SACs but for exam revision stick to what's on the study design and make sure you know it as well as you can- it really helps for more content-heavy subjects to know what you don't need to worry about that might have been put in your textbook as extension or whatever."

Remembering the graphing stuff like the equations for hyperbolas and their asymptotes might be useful too but I think that's about all I'd really prioritise.

aaaaaaacccccccce,feid00j,t3_ep86qw,1579135629.0,I was vaguely aware of this but I continue to use that emoji in innocent contexts - my friends are used to it by now I think 😂
nutrition,feibsby,t1_fei9jrk,1579134818.0,"Yep, proper (strained) greek yoghurt is very low in lactose so the majority of people should tolerate it."
FODMAPS,feefmsl,t3_eoqg35,1579032772.0,"I think antibiotics generally don't have high FODMAP additives, but they're notorious for changing the balance of different bacteria in your gut which might explain your symptoms?"
BitLifeApp,fecwpc1,t1_fecodtx,1578987644.0,"That might be because they used to implant a whole lot of embryos at once when they did IVF in real life under the assumption that not all the embryos would actually make it long enough to become a foetus. Hence, once the success rate became higher there were a LOT more twins and triplets born via IVF - I think they've stopped implanting so many at a time now do this reason."
lingling40hrs,fecmwbp,t1_fecak52,1578977881.0,"Yep, I'm an alto and though it took a lot of effort to extend my range that high I can sing most soprano stuff plus my lower range which sopranos don't tend to have."
FODMAPS,fecmmt3,t3_eog10n,1578977689.0,"It's at least 3-4 hours between serves with the same FODMAP, so as the other person said you should be fine if you're just having 3 meals a day with no snacks between - if you eat more frequently than that then stick to the 3-4 hours."
HydroHomies,fe6p9zo,t1_fe6jj9j,1578899124.0,Idk if it's the same casing or not but I've seen/heard of things like this being used for patients with dementia who wouldn't otherwise get enough fluids. They're flavoured iirc to be more like jelly rather than plain water.
infj,fe6hflv,t1_fe6h23v,1578890998.0,"There's looping, where instead of mainly using your dominant and auxiliary functions together (introverted intuition and extroverted feeling for INFJs) to mainly your dominant and tertiary functions (tertiary for INFJs is introverted thinking). For me that would mean I tend to stay inside my head more and become more logical rather than empathetic in my outward behaviour. So in a way yes but you just use the functions you already use in a slightly different priority. Looping usually happens when you're under stress btw if that helps."
infj,fe6gmaw,t3_enz093,1578890291.0,I second the suggestion to look into the cognitive functions- it's definitely possible that you behave in ways that are more similar to a lot of INFPs but you can't be a combination of two types: you have one type based on which cognitive functions you use and how you use them.
MealPrepSunday,fe5jf04,t1_fe4l9gq,1578870165.0,You could probably use crumbled tofu or textured vegetable protein instead of quorn mince.
vegan,fe5bxz7,t1_fe4zpy3,1578867473.0,Ugh i feel that. It's not an allergy for me but I can't eat dates and literally every raw vegan dessert and a lot of snack balls/bars where I am are primarily made with dates and/or cashews which I also can't eat. 😥
Frozen,fe0npqd,t1_fe04rvs,1578816497.0,I think it really depends on the crowd that day - the only sing along I've been to was bohemian rhapsody and a fair few people were singing there.
vegetarian,fe0dr3l,t1_fe0dj99,1578811121.0,"Yep, calcium does do it but milk protein also inhibits absorption of both heme and non heme iron which is why I specified dairy."
vegetarian,fe0789u,t1_fdy9jlv,1578804887.0,"Dairy also interferes with iron absorption, so if you consume it that's another thing to keep in mind."
actuallesbians,fdzrjrp,t1_fdzmico,1578794129.0,I'm not trans but I first properly worked out I was attracted to girls when I was maybe 15 or so? I know that's still on the younger side but it's definitely older than some people who talk about crushes they had in primary/elementary school in other kids or teachers.
FODMAPS,fdsdop8,t3_emrviq,1578700290.0,I'd say almond milk should be low FODMAP at higher serves due to how little almond there is in it by weight/volume but this is probably something you'd have to do the maths for or just trial and error to find your tolerance if you're not in the elimination phase.
FODMAPS,fdpvq5d,t1_fdpsja3,1578642471.0,"It's based on the percentage of people with IBS who don't react to a given amount I think. Iirc green means something like 95-99% of people will tolerate it, yellow means 50% and idk what red is supposed to mean."
FODMAPS,fdpu60c,t1_fdpj0yn,1578640613.0,No you don't. I've seen suggestions to limit your fruit to 2-3 serves a day but there's no reason unless it's medically necessary to limit your overall vegetable intake.
fatlogic,fdmol66,t1_fdmnna2,1578558196.0,"Insulin is a hormone that you secrete to signal your cells to take in glucose, which lowers your blood sugar levels. If you're consuming a lot of sugar/simple carbohydrates frequently your blood sugar levels will rise quickly and stay high, which means you have to produce more insulin."
Fitness,fdmmdsn,t1_fdmlui2,1578555479.0,150 minutes is the bare minimum and it's really only so low because the government bodies who make these guidelines prioritise how achievable it is over what's necessarily optimal.
mildlyinteresting,fdlixux,t1_fdlcdf3,1578525036.0,I mean at the end of the day it does have electrolytes in it so maybe that's why? I've only ever really seen hydralyte (similar ratios of sodium and potassium I think but far less sugar) at pharmacies where I am in Australia though.
fatlogic,fdga0rr,t1_fdfulv4,1578386540.0,I don't think the person in the screenshot claimed they were simultaneously those things though... I read it as meaning they were anorexic and then after the process of weight restoration became obese.
fatlogic,fdfx9hl,t1_fdfvfnq,1578372727.0,"Yes, as part of the body shutting down any body processes that aren't absolutely necessary to get you to the next day are shut down or severely slowed so you can have anorexics legitimately gaining weight on say 1200 calories. That's part of what contributes to refeeding syndrome - if the body is so used to having to get by with the minimum amount of food it can throw everything out of whack when you start consuming normal amounts again."
mbti,fd87tob,t3_ek8fpr,1578214928.0,I've seen this clip used to try to articulate what Ni is like and while this is exaggerated obviously it is a pretty good visualisation imo XD.
fuckeatingdisorders,fd87e2u,t3_ek9hag,1578214755.0,"Jeez, I would have dismissed it as her not knowing your situation if it was just the book but those comments and patting your belly... Good on you for being able to laugh it off!"
tumblr,fd5oh7k,t1_fd5a3bj,1578179683.0,Pregnancy isn't the only risk of unprotected sex but whatever I guess
antidiet,fcz7awp,t1_fcyx2jg,1578095121.0,"Look, I agree in the vast majority of cases they aren't necessary but if someone has a chronic illness and eliminating one or a few things has enough of a benefit for them to outweigh the risks that come from restricting their diet then I'm not going to shoot that down."
antidiet,fcyd94x,t1_fcxn2je,1578078395.0,"For sure, I just personally don't think every single form of restriction is necessarily bad for every person. Obviously people with a history of eating disorders/those who are susceptible probably shouldn't be doing something like that unless it's something like a flat-out allergy though."
antidiet,fcwwdfk,t3_ejcbj6,1578040418.0,If it's actually legitimate like say avoiding nightshades because they worsen symptoms of a chronic illness I'd say that's alright as it falls under self-care rather than the typical weight-loss or 'detox' stuff. But there are diets that will try to sell you on the wellness aspect that aren't really backed up by evidence so if you're trying to treat a medical issue just make sure anything you try is legitimate.
Frozen,fcws58v,t1_fcvqvds,1578035418.0,From what I heard this scene wasn't going to be in the movie at all but then people liked it so they added the ice sword
Showerthoughts,fcpl4nw,t1_fcpeai4,1577866705.0,"Queen Victoria's husband was made prince consort too and they were cousins- it's because the title of king is higher than even that of a ruling queen, hence the wife of a king is queen consort but the husband of a queen regnant is prince consort."
Showerthoughts,fcphryp,t1_fcpbzye,1577864665.0,Queen Elizabeth II became queen in the 1950s and is still the monarch. Because her husband has the title of Prince consort and not king there hasn't been an English king since the creation of the internet.
IsItBullshit,fcp43au,t1_fcou4pr,1577849849.0,"That only happens if your weight has gotten dangerously low, like in a famine or with anorexia nervosa. As you're losing weight your BMR will get lower because it takes less energy to maintain the necessary functions of a smaller body. But the majority of people don't need to worry about 'starvation mode', where the body starts shutting down."
FODMAPS,fccomi9,t1_fcci25p,1577600818.0,"I'm pretty sure you can react to different polyols in different ways, just like you might tolerate some fructan sources but not others. I think with GOS, lactose, and fructose though you generally will react uniformly to the same amount of those FODMAPs in different foods."
FODMAPS,fca7bff,t1_fca2yl2,1577564133.0,"It shouldn't really take more than a week or so to actually see improvement if you react to FODMAPs, I believe the reasoning behind the 6 week recommendation is that most people will take a little while to really get the hang of it such as other people in this thread saying they had slipups reading food labels at first."
BitLifeApp,fc52gbp,t1_fc4zbye,1577439650.0,Before you do it you get like 10 popups you have to click through saying stuff like are you REALLY sure you want to kiss your cousin on the lips etc.
tumblr,fc4qcpy,t1_fc4brf6,1577424615.0,Yeah it's not the most common phrase but I'm from Australia (northern victoria if that matters) and I've definitely heard it before.
starterpacks,fc3hmml,t1_fc3gpg9,1577389991.0,It's from a movie called the polar express.
fatlogic,fbz5cad,t1_fbz4h4j,1577235555.0,"This has already been happening- idiot and moron used to be official terms but people started using them as insults, same with retarded in recent years."
