His involvement in the babies' lives was 100% his choice - I always had barriers set up so he could get away from them - he never used them. He always wanted to be with the babies or me.

I'm not sure why you're accusing me of ignoring my best friend...."

The twins are alive and well - they will be 16 in 5 months. And still miss Dev, who was put to sleep when they were in 5th grade."
aww,fepikb9,t1_fephgoc,1579321410.0,"Dev died 5 years ago. My husband made us get a new pit mix puppy around 6 years ago because Dev got his head stuck in a giant pretzel bucket when we weren't home, ate all the salt, seizured, and fell down the stairs (based on all the evidence). 

He ended up living (which I still cannot believe, since the vet and I both secretly thought he was dead upon arriving at the clinic. The vet injected him with epinephrine, but admited to me later that it was for my benefit, since the dog was dead.   


I knew Dev was dead, so I left him at the clinic and went home and bawled my eyes out all night. The next morning, I called the clinic to confirm that Dev had died. The receptionist went to check, then came back to say he's awake. I went, ""No, Devlin <insert last name>."" She said, ""Um, yes, he's looking right at me,""

We've never driven anywhere so fast in our lives. He had severe neurological issues for months because of the sodium poisoning and the heat stroke, but he lived another full year and a half.

But after that event, my husband made us get a new puppy because, after watching me suffer through this, he said, ""You need to bond to another dog because when Dev actually dies, you are not going to be able to handle it."" So he went out and got another dog. He tried to involve me, and I wanted nothing to do with it, because it felt like replacing Dev. So he picked out a puppy, and he went and brought her home.....

....and she loves me. 10000%. Wants nothing to do with anyone else, just me. The person who didn't want her because I felt she trying to replace my Dev. 

And now she's my inseperable buddy and it will probably kill me when we have to make that call."
aww,feph415,t1_fepgyph,1579320346.0,I totally understand. I don't think the missing ever goes away. :'(
aww,feph0bk,t1_fepgtqt,1579320267.0,"Right? The phone call setting it up (which, in my opinion, was the worst part, because it felt like actually making a date where you plan to kill your dog), then the days leading up to it where you spoil him, then the trip to the vet and holding him in your arms. 

And then the trip back home where you bury him. And now I'm crying again."
aww,fepft5p,t1_fepfhb8,1579319417.0,"I held him as the vet injected him, too. And I'm so glad I did. It sucked, feeling him relax and die in my arms, but the last thing he saw was me looking down at him, loving him and holding him.

And this was over 5 years ago, and I'm finding myself choking up again."
aww,fepfkzl,t1_fepepto,1579319262.0,"lol - I have worked with animals my entire life. Domestic, livestock, wildlife... I volunteered at nature centers since I was 10. Trained in English Hunter-Jumper since I was 9. Taught riding lessons and taught kids how to not get killed by their horses since I was 16. Worked for 4 years as an unlicensed tech for an emergency vet hospital, including being the head of controlled drug inventory. Worked for a Nature Center for three years, including outreach programs to expose inner-city kids to actual, real animals. Have a bachelors degree in biology with an emphasis in wildlife biology.

Of course I know not to allow kids to remove a prize from an animal's mouth. However, Dev would not allow me to keep them separate. He'd jump the barrier - with his treat - and lay down by the babies again. 

I had always hammered into my kids' heads the body language of a dog who's uncomfortable. Dev always made me out to be a liar - no matter what I said, he acted cool with whatever they did. I had to look up videos of dogs exhibiting stress signals to teach them what to look out for."
aww,fepewgd,t1_fepd8ct,1579318785.0,"I've worked with animals (domestic, livestock, wildlife) my entire life, so my kids know exactly what Dev was. And what our current pit mix is, and, since she's a very nervous dog, how to watch out for her and protect her and others."
aww,fepcngv,t1_fep9r9w,1579317254.0,"He was. Way more amazing than I can describe in these posts. 

When my kids went through night terrors, he was there. He would crawl into bed with them and let them squeeze him around the neck. 

He let them roll Tonka trucks up and down his body, and wagged his tail whenever they said his name.

Whenever any of us were upset, he laid his big, blocky head on our chest/knee/foot/wherever and would look up at you like, ""Hey. This sucks. But I've got you.""

When we got kittens, he tolerated them using him as a climbing perch. We used to laugh to see him walking through the house, all stoic, with a tiny kitten using his hind leg as a perch while he pretended it wasn't happening."
aww,fepc5g0,t1_fepbs6m,1579316919.0,"lol - sorry.

Although, I admit to thinking about that while I wrote it.

....I'm evil.... :)"
aww,fepc091,t1_fep9v9o,1579316822.0,"I worked for an emergency vet clinic when I was in college. He was brought in one night because the guy's ""stupid wife insisted,"" with a foreleg broken in three places; simple fractures in the radius and ulna, and a spiral fracture in the humerus. 

I was the tech in the room that did the vitals. I took his vitals, and a preliminary assessment of injury, and asked a few questions. The man told me his wife made him bring him in because he'd been hit by a car (no road rash anywhere on the body). The little 4 year-old in the room yelled, ""Nuh UH! Daddy threw him against the wall!""

The man went stiff, I pretended not to hear it, just kept examining the puppy while I thought. I finally looked up and said, ""He's got some internal injuries, I'm going to take him in back where we can monitor him more closely. The doctor will be in shortly."" (Admit to lying - I just wanted to get him out of the room and away from the man. I wish I could have also gotten the girl away from him, but that was beyond my power).

We x-rayed the puppy, and while we were doing that, the man snuck out the door. Presumably so he wouldn't have to pay (literally and figuratively) for abusing the puppy. 

I ended up adopting him, since this was 20-some years ago, and pit bull mixes at the humane society at that time had a dismal rate of adoption(and subsequent euthanasia). 

He was amazing. Such a good boy. I really struggled when we had to put him down. He probably should have been euthanized months before I did it, but I loved him so much I had extreme difficulty making that call. I kept hoping he'd die peacefully in his sleep, where I wasn't the one deciding when."
aww,fepb2ic,t1_fepaulx,1579316194.0,"lol - be careful of expecting that you'll always be your dog's highest priority and end-all? 

And it was adorable. And Dev was still my best friend. It was just surprising (and amazing and heart-warming) to watch his priorities change when the babies came home."
aww,fep8is1,t1_fep7s9d,1579314523.0,"He probably will. I didn't realize how much Dev apparently wanted some kids to watch over. 

I finally had to make the call to euthanize him at 15 and a half. It was really rough on all of us. But he had congestive heart issues, severe arthritis (to the point where I had to carry him up and down the stairs every day), cataracts, and nerve loss in his bowels where he didn't realize he had to poop until 4 seconds before he was actually doing it. And then he'd run toward the door (and of course, not make it) and then wilt and act so ashamed even though I kept telling him it was okay while I cleaned the carpet (since the vet had warned me this was going to happen due to the advanced arthritis)."
aww,fep6ykw,t3_eq9wl8,1579313524.0,"Be careful.  

My pit was super attached to me during my pregnancy, and then when the kids (twins) were born, he totally threw me over for them.  

They took precedence over everything.  His entire life,  he slept on my bed.  After the twins were born, he slept on the floor of the nursery.  If they were crying, he nudged me toward them. If they were dirty during the night, he woke me up to change them EVEN IF THEY HADN'T WOKEN UP THEMSELVES.

They could take rawhides, bones, or food out of his mouth. They dressed him up like a superhero and he would wear hats or capes for hours.  

God, I miss that dog.  :("
