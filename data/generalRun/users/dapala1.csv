explainlikeimfive,ffaukvd,t3_esi2if,1579744836.0,"Why is conditioning never at least a partial answer to these questions? 

I think the amount of ""pain"" and/or ""shock"" we decide to experience are learned responses. Like when you see a toddler fall hard and it takes a second for them to figure how to respond. Outward emotion is not different then the pain you feel. It's just responses you're brain is triggered to deliver. And that makes up your ""end user"" experience. 

In most cases, a very tragic incident will trigger a ""shock"" response and your brain will take a sec, or more, to figure out how to tell you how to respond. Sometimes it will be with with pain, or just numb shock. 

It's like stubbing your toe, our brains just know it hurts like hell when we should be comfortable in bed."

Your right, any bank can decide that's not normal and flag the IRS if they want, but that would be very very extreme. But I'm talking about the IRS doing an audit. If any of us could make that kind of extra scratch gambling it would be wise to just claim the income and not chance it anyway. But if I win an extra $3000 then I'm just letting it slide."

It's easy as hell for most people here to dodge those taxes because we don't make enough money to flag the IRS. Its pennies to them. And the IRS literally doesn't care how you made the money, illegal or not, they just want tax the money they can see.

If you make enough money where the IRS is looking at you, well, that's a problem I want to have."
