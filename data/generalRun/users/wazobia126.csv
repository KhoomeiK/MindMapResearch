movies,ffdrxmb,t1_ffdphat,1579827434.0,"It was widely reported after the movie was released. 

Edit - Zoe Kravitz also commented on it. I think the feelings were mutual. She did laugh about it in an interview, and said it was no big deal...if you read about the production of the movie, you'll realise it was gruelling long shoot in a desert, with no traditional script for actors to fully grasp and understand their story arcs...instead it used a lot of storyboard format. I'm sure it would be easy for two egos to clash in that type of environment
