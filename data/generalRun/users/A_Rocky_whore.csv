A TIF got mad at me the other day because I said 'excuse me ladies' to a group of women in the mall, I thought she was just a butch, and her friends tried to tear into me. College is such an echo chamber of crazy, I'll miss it but I'll be glad to be done at the same time"

GenderCritical,fevpi1p,t3_eqp1a7,1579399997.0,"We're the same age, and I feel really hopeless a lot of the time when looking at my peers. I go to an ultra woke liberal arts college, and the pronoun plague is everywhere. Those ""I'll go with you"" buttons are also popular. Could you imagine, being such a handmaiden that you take it upon yourself to offer to go into the bathroom with a man and harass the women in there that feel uncomfortable? I don't have any encouraging words, I'll just say hopefully they grow out of it or we'll see the trans movement implode on itself within our lifetime."

bipolar,fetaio7,t3_eqjduw,1579373345.0,"In my experience it just goes away, normally by the time I pass out. I won't sleep for days, and my body gets to the point where it just passes out where I am and it kind of resets. I have clonazepam to take during these episodes, but I never take it because I think I need to be alert and ready to fight (my delusions are mostly paranoia and involve someone breaking in to kill me/stalking me)"

There's going to be an influx of TIMs qualifying on the woman's time, so they'll have to move the goalposts to a point that  almost no real woman could hope to achieve.
