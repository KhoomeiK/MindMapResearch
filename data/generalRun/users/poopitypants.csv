Your pup is probably a fair jumble of breeds if I had to guess. There is a particular breed she looks like that I can't remember the name of right now (gonna try to figure it out!) but I believe they're more common in the UK.

changemyview,felayja,t1_fekj0u5,1579217933.0,"I think the big problem here is that perhaps you don't appreciate the difference between dog breeds. 

Worked with dogs closely for a long time, and can confidently say that for being the same animal... The personality of different breeds shines through brightly. Companion breeds are not all the same, and are very different from working breeds.

Having a relatively predictable set of behaviors is what's important for a lot of families. When, after working with pups for quite some time, I finally was in a position to get a dog of my own I knew the most important thing would be to pick a breed or dog mixed with a breed that would be compatible for my lifestyle. I considered finding a shelter dog, but I was worried about becoming one of the many people that also rehomed a dog because of compatibility issues and I swore to myself I would try like hell to never let that happen. Me and SO picked a breed we decided worked for our needs (one from a Craiglist ""I don't want this puppy"" ad and one from a breed rescue), but a couple we were thinking about simply didn't have rescue options- if there were any, they were very old dogs (my SO was not up for doggy hospice care) or only across the country. If we had decided one of those breeds fit our needs the best, we would've had to find a good breeder and pay out the ass, but it would've been worth it to make sure we ended up with a dog that would never see the inside of a shelter.

My friends recently adopted a pup from a rescue and found that the sweet mixed breed dog has very high anxiety, needs meds that are hard for them to afford, keeps them up otherwise (which is a bad combo with  their medical issues), and is in general a difficult dog. They love her and are doing their best, but they weren't able to predict her problems and they are struggling more because of it.

Companion breeds aren't just looks. They have very big personality differences, and needs. We shouldn't be breeding dogs just for looks, especially when it sacrifices their health, but we should be breeding dogs to fit lifestyles for potential dog owners and destigmatizing the idea of (well-bred) purebreds- and just combinimg it with PROPER RESEARCH. If humans stepped up and stopped biting off more than they could chew, especially out of ignorance of breeds, there would be less dogs in the shelter."

This is much more complicated than a regular old marriage, so you should take your sweet time to think about it. I know exactly how much it sucks to spend that much time apart, we didn't visit for a year and a half once and it really takes a toll on you. We spent four years apart before we got married and closed the gap. But... This is a very big deal. Your boyfriend will have to take you on as a possible liability (and you can say, I would never purposely put him in a bad position now, but you could do so through no fault of your own)- if he can even afford to. If he can't prove he makes so much per year, or make up the difference with 3x the assets, he will have to put you as a potential liability in someone else's name. It costs a fair bit (I believe it was in the neighborhood of 2k for us) for all the paperwork, and we didn't hire a lawyer. It cost us some big headaches dealing with a massive bureaucratic machine- trying to get answers and updates from the service centers is a fun ride, and if you get a little thing wrong on your paper work (like writing none instead of 0 or some dumb thing) you could be delayed months. Since our relationship was mostly online and we didn't have a traditional wedding we spent ages collecting and printing proof of our relationship- there was probably about 200 pages in that box? Yes, box, cause it sure didn't fit in a regular envelope.

What I suggest you do for now is a lot of research. Consider alternatives, like going to school in the US. Collect pictures of your vacations, and receipts from things you've done together. Make sure to keep your boarding passes if you visit again. Browse visajourney- don't take their word as gospel, only trust .gov resources completely, but there's a lot of information on there that can help you get started and see how the process went for other people."

aww,fcun298,t1_fcuki9v,1577984513.0,"Yeah, that's fucking awful.

And this does happen to kids, and I think the nanny dog myth is part of the blame. Nanny dogs don't exist, a spokesperson for Staffordshire Bull Terriers made it up and said it in a magazine in the 80s, and people attribute it to pit bulls now and every fur mommy dog parent who adopts a pit seems to think they can leave their child alone with them, or don't need to teach their child how to give the dog space or understand a dog's cues.

I do believe there's an issue with apbt in the US being overbred and by underqualified people (looking at my local Craigslist listings is depressing alone), and with that it seems logical to think that backyard bred dogs could have neurological problems.

I don't believe that the pit in your question literally showed no signs before attacking, simply because it's /incredibly/ rare short of, like mentioned above, neurological problems, for a dog to hide all possible warning signs unless they had been trained to. I've seen many a video of a dog that ""showed no signs"" that *did* show signs. I've broken up many a dog fight where a less trained employee wouldn't have caught on that a fight was about to start. Signals can be subtle, but it's *super* rare that they're non-existent. However, I definitely wasn't there and can't actually analyze squat, only share the potential that your friend could have misread subtle and surprising signals.

Edit: just reread that the dog was 17, dogs do get dementia. My boss's dog put a mean hole through her hand because she was 16 and not all there."

aww,fcujftu,t1_fcuexpo,1577982378.0,"Edit to add: the dog in OP isn't even a pit (apbt anyway), it's an American Bully, which ideally is low drive and low dog/animal aggression, although there's a fair amount of variance since their breed beginnings weren't a collected effort if I remember correctly. They were bred to have the looks and build of a scary stocky pittish dog, but the personality of a companion dog.

----

Take the time to do some research that isn't from biased websites (in either direction honestly, pits are a very polarizing subject and you'll find a lot of false information in the good and the bad).

First, when I say pit I mean the American Pit Bull Terrier and any directly related dog (Amstaffs are genetically the same, for example). Using ""pit"" as an umbrella term for many unrelated breeds is about as useful as using ""lab"" to include pointers, herders, and all the different retrievers- they are vastly different breeds that may just look vaguely similar but function very differently.

Apbt are between 30-60 pounds typically, although their breed standard is very loose on looks and size (so there's a large amount of variance in appearance). They come from a cross between terriers, for the animal aggression, and bulldogs, for the tenacity. This is why you're right about pits grabbing something and not letting go- this is a bulldog trait, and I can attest to this having worked with dogs for 7 years and trying to take away toys from possessive bulldogs is so damn hard.

So, a pit's original purpose was to be dog aggressive for blood sport, although they were popular in America and used for many other practical purposes. Dog fighting dogs needed to be friendly to people however, as dogmen didn't want to be hurt by their own dogs and the dogmen often were in the ring, with their dogs. They had to hate dogs, but love people.

Blood sport fell out of fashion, and dog aggression is still definitely in the genes of many apbt and their mixes. It doesn't mean that every apbt will /express/ those genes, but there is always some potential, especially if they're not properly socialized from a young age, or overstimulated. This is why you get so many bad dog park stories around pits. Plenty of pits do fine, and some pits do fine until they hit sexual maturity, and some pits are just meant to be solo dogs and prefer their humans and that's it.

But you have to know very little about dogs to think they're the strongest. I understand if you mistakenly think they have the strongest bite force as that's a prevailing myth (rotties and German Shepherds have stronger bites, and so do a number of less common breeds). But apbt are just very strong for their size. Many dogs are stronger than pits. Pits are just a combo of strong and stubborn and focused that can be very intimidating in a possibly small package.

Sorry it's long, I just don't want you to think or continue sharing that pit bulls are literal hell on wheels."

henna,fcp7qg9,t3_eibvq5,1577853277.0,"I love this style! How did it feel to give someone else's hand a little makeover?

A heads up, it looks like you're using a shelf stable pre rolled cone. You should look into mixing your own henna! It's a really fun part of the hobby, and you get to know what's in your henna :) That's the downside of these shelf stable henna cones you find everywhere, there's no regulation on their labels so they often just flat out lie about ingredients, and sometimes they can have substance you proooobably don't want on your skin. The big one is PPD (which is what black henna is, there's rarely much of any henna plant in black henna, if any at all) and that has a lot of health concerns, but even the brown ones can have crazy things like kerosene and gasoline in them to keep them shelf stable, or make them stain your skin immediately. Real/pure henna stains start off bright orange, and turn darker over the course of 24-48 hours! And they will stain different parts of your skin at different levels :)

Anyway, the health concerns are def the biggest reason to try and make your own henna but honestly it's pretty relaxing to do, smells great imo (especially if you use the appropriate essential oils, certain kinds make the stain darker), and it's fun to see peoples reactions when you tell them you made it yourself.

I'm so glad you're having fun with this! Keep posting your progress, and consider joining some Facebook groups! Henna Hub is a great one, and The Henna Society as well. The first one has a TREASURE TROVE of information in it's files... It'll blow you away!"

They require a big cage and a friend (shouldn't really have a rat alone), and have short life spans (2-3 years). It's sad, but the positive part is that they are a short time commitment.

They need time to play outside their cage every day, but could be left alone overnight without much issue.

They have unique personalities, are very unlikely to bite, do not run away once they understand their cage is home (doesn't take very long for them to realize that), some are pretty darn social and like pets and to interact with you, and can be taught tricks/to come by name. Plus, they don't poop when they're running around outside their cage once they reach maturity! I had one that loved to ride around on my shoulder and burrow in my hair.

It's not something people consider seriously usually, until they meet a friendly rat and realize that they're more than their stereotypes. Also, pet rats are a diff animal than street rats :)"

Same, it was definitely risky and we both understood that it may not work, but it was our only option to live together and we both understood and accepted the risk. Just hit our 5th anniversary and doing good, I think the line of communication we absolutely had to build from years of talking online really helped :)"
DnD,fc8qnoq,t3_egqofk,1577540235.0,"For me, I am a pretty new dm and don't get it as bad as you do but so far exposure therapy is working better than I thought. I ignored the group's cry for the next game for almost 2 months, before I finally gave in and held a session last week or so. But every session it gets a little easier, and I figure out how to handle my players, and what engages them vs what doesn't.

It seems like a common thing that dm's underestimate how well they've done in a session. The more I talk to people about this, the more I realize that it doesn't take much to give the players a good time. That we're too hard on ourselves. Don't *harshly* railroad, let them have a little agency and reward creative thinking, and they'll enjoy it."

immigration,fc7k9p7,t1_fc7cu3v,1577510135.0,"So I actually married someone from overseas that I met online (on msn!) a long time ago!

My advice: There's no point in marrying right away. Take a few visits, meet the guy, see what's up. Spend some time irl! We did 4 times before we married the fifth time, and we had a much bigger distance :)

Trust me, it's worth it. It really fucking sucks to be in this sort of ldr, I wouldn't wish it on my worst enemy. The loneliness can get to you. But I'm really glad I got to know him at least a bit irl before we made any serious decisions. Which was very good- having signed on as his sponser for his green card, I'm on the line for potentially a lot of money if he ever decided to fuck me over. I'm not sure how Canada does it, but there may be something similar in place on his side of things. And man, it's much harder to divorce than it is to just break up.

Get to planning y'all a visit already! Find a date that works and stop being nevermets! It will be so amazingly exciting, and hopefully be your best vacation you've ever had! If the marriage can't wait for at least that, it sounds like a red flag"

I think they're ridiculously cute- bat eared apbt are the best"
dogs,fbw7tvi,t3_eensbo,1577142908.0,"My husband really wanted a second dog to keep our first dog company and I cautioned him greatly on the idea. I wanted a second dog because damn I love dogs, but he didn't want another for any reason except for our first dog.

But we found a good solution for this kind of fix. We examined our situation, decided we were very capable of keeping two dogs, and the biggest factor at play was just finding a personality match for our first dog since that's the main point. 

The solution... Foster to adopt. Our first foster was not a great personality match, but our second foster was, and I'm so happy we went this route. I worked in the pet industry for some time and saw people get a second dog ""to help the first"" in one way or another, and there were plenty of times it backfired partially or completely and the two dogs didn't get along or amped eachothers anxiety higher or whatnot. By fostering we were able to have a ""try before you buy"" and it was sooooo valuable.

Just sharin!"
