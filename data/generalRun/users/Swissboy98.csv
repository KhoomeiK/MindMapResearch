Decriminalizing means no punishment except the drugs getting taken away. But it is still illegal. It also means no regulation and no stores to buy it from.


Legalizing means well it being legal and regulated.


Drug policies are based on one of two experiments.


**Experiment 1:** You put a single rat in a cage with nothing to do and install 2 water bottles one of which is normal water and the other is filled with a water and drug (of your choice) mix. Sooner or later the rat drinks from the drugged water. And it starts drinking more and more of it until it overdoses and dies.





This experiment formed lots of drug policies. It also got heavili criticized because rats, like humans, are social animals. Furthermore doing nothing all day long isn't good.



Which leads to experiment number 2.


You still have the 2 water bottles. Except this time you have lots of rats in a nice cage with lots of things to do. Essentially rat heaven. And suddenly you don't get addicted rats and you don't get rats overdosing on the drug. You do however get a drug fueled orgy.




And then there is the giant human drugs experiment in the 60s. Better known as the Vietnam war. Lots of American soldiers in Vietnam used drugs. And we aren't talking weed here. We are talking about opium, heroin and the like. This sparked fears of the US being overrun by drug addicts when the war ends. Except that didn't happen. The GIs left the hell that was Vietnam and just stopped using the drugs.




All of this leads to the conclusion that

1. Happy people who lead a good, fulfilling life and who don't have undiagnosed mental problems don't become addicts.

2. Addicts don't need punishment. They need help. Help which they definitely aren't getting in jail.
