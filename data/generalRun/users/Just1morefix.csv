 My grandparents had a 300 acre avocado farm in California. Growing up my parents, siblings, and myself would visit and lend a hand in the Summers. I can still close my eyes and smell the rich, loamy soil. Needless to say we had the freshest, ripest avocados you can imagine. Warmed by the sun, I would often pick a beauty and with my penknife cut it open and indulge in the fatty, delicious fruit. Now, you can well imagine how many pits collected over time. Hundreds upon hundreds. So under my grammy's tutelage, we would clean, dry and then polish each oversized seed. Then gramps would carefully drill a hole straight through the pit. We all would then use fine quality line to string 5 or 6 together, spaced out and knotted. Our homegrown and homemade anal bead sets were the talk of the town. And I think everyone of us still remembers our introduction to the ""Pit Pull""."

WhitePeopleTwitter,fgniahd,t1_fgndsqi,1580945463.0,"I think it is a loaded term because its current connotations distract from what can be learned from its core ""meaning"". Most people associate brain washing with Patty Hearst, POW, Manson and the Family, and other notable cults. When we talk about brainwashing in this context it means a brutal, systematic coerced brain change. So, colloquially brainwashing exists as a ferocious bugaboo and fodder for Hollywood. 

  But brainwashing can teach us about core aspects of psychology, self, identity, belief systems and conditioning. I believe the plasticity of neurology coupled with language and individual differences allows for subjective interpretations of reality. We effect and are effected. I think the use of the word brainwashing, can get in the way of the realization that competing realities are constantly impinging on your consciousness. It is not brought on by torture, chanting, isolation or love bombing. It is not always done in ashrams, prisons or cults. Competing realities transform our thoughts constantly. We are bombarded by messaging from outside our comfortable and safe brain cage. He who controls the metaphor, controls reality -- or at least its perception."

WhitePeopleTwitter,fgmrytb,t1_fgmo3iv,1580930841.0,"Brainwashed is a tricky and loaded term. I like to think of language as a spell we succumb to. Communication is key to our species but there are inherent drawbacks. Our words shape the way we perceive and act in the world. We are entranced by our own words in that we forget we are shaping reality with our specific history, emotions, beliefs etc. If the word brainwashing is pejorative, I think hypnosis is an interesting model. We are hypnotized by a neurology that is particularly *our own*. We don't see the world exactly like any other being. So there are billions of competing word spells that can mesh or conflict with and override your specific belief systems. 

The culture and commerce particularly have a vested interest in being able to overcome your brain states. By implanting artificial needs and fears, they hope that you will accept part of their word hypnosis. Then engage in incorporating their beliefs, and indulge in acquiring the products that will ""ultimately satisfy"" your bottomless needs and quell your every fear."

WhitePeopleTwitter,fgmlf6v,t3_ezcxad,1580926961.0,"There is something to be said about that belief. Once the major survival needs are met and one starts accumulating luxuries a paradox begins to form. The more you have the more you want. And at the same time when daily suffering and true misery vanish, we tend to focus on every detail that we perceive as not *perfect*. Most of us cannot simply be grateful for what we have, for it is not enough. If we see the glass as half empty we tend to focus on and even invent adversaries and problems. 

  Some of us thrive on fixing problems so are continually observing their life through that lens. I'm not saying those in the West don't have real problems, there is no escape from illness, death, need, pain etc. But  in vanquishing true daily existential threats many become in need of a battle to fight or a cause to rally around."

""Bosch was a pessimistic and stern moralist who had neither illusions about the rationality of human nature nor confidence in the kindness of a world that had been corrupted by human presence in it. His paintings are sermons on folly and sin, addressed often to initiates and consequently difficult to translate. Unable to unlock the mystery of the artist’s works, critics at first believed that he must have been affiliated with secret sects. Although the themes of his work were often religious, his choice of symbols to represent the temptation and eventual ensnarement of humans in earthly evils caused many critics to view the artist as a practitioner of the occult arts. More recent scholarship views Bosch as a talented artist who possessed deep insight into human character and as one of the first artists to represent abstract concepts in his work.""

 ""When the Nazis overran Poland in World War II, Lazowski yearned to find a way to fight back, to protect human life, and he seized upon a paradoxical instrument of salvation--the German army's profound fear of disease. While German industrialist Oskar Schindler, whose heroic story was told in the movie ""Schindler's List,"" employed bribes and influence to protect as many as 1,000 Jews who worked in his factory, Lazowski slyly used medical science to save the lives of thousands of Jews and other Poles in 12 Polish villages. He and a fellow physician, Stanislaw Matulewicz, faked a typhus epidemic that forced the German army to quarantine the villages.

Thanks to that quarantine, many of the villages' 8,000 men, women and children likely were spared the fate of being deported to prisons, slave labor camps or death camps, where Poland lost a fifth of its population. ""
