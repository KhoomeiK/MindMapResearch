I hate the way some people hide their true selves behind a mask of cynicism. It's like it's uncool to love something or someone unless you're in a long term relationship and posting on Instagram. Admitting a crush is seen as a sign of weakness which makes love a treacherous minefield.

Many customers would ignore the bit at the end and name a transaction they did that morning - fail. 

Another more obvious one was ""Can you tell me the name of the insurance company you pay a monthly direct debit to?""

However in most companies, the managers really don't care about degrees. They value performance. Many bosses even look down on degrees unless they're directly relevant to the job.

The most important thing in the business world is connections. Connections are far more valuable than any degree. Sadly ass-kissing and snitching also seem to be desirable traits in many offices."
