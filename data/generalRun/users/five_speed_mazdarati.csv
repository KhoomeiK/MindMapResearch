BuyItForLife,fepufbk,t3_eq7r63,1579331678.0,"I’m not sure how to point this out without ending up in /r/iamverysmart but Thermos is a brand name just like Stanley is. It’s become a generic like Band-Aid or Kleenex. 

I think the proper term is a vacuum flask, which are made by both Stanley and Thermos. 

Thermos may not be a copyrighted/trademarked/whatevered word anymore so maybe I’m just being pedantic."
