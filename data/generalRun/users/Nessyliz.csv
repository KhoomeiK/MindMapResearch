I love their Fortify oil too but I can't afford all the things all the time so I stick with the cheaper Teddie Organic's Rosehip Oil. Had a bad reaction to the vitamin C but that's just my skin being super picky about vitamin C formulations. Only one I've ever found that works for me without irritation is the Mad Hippie one.  

Now I'm thinking I might have to treat myself to the Fortify oil again because it is really nice. See, this is why I can't talk skincare/beauty! Too tempting!"

SarahSnark,ffthx9r,t1_ffth3s6,1580221004.0,"It was a game changer for me before. I use acids (Stratia's mandelic acid and a weekly forty percent lactic acid peel from MUAC) to control my acne so I always struggled with dry patches before introducing a moisturizing toner. I actually use the classic [Kikumasamune](https://www.amazon.com/Moisture-Lotion-Toner-Kikumasamune-Women/dp/B00ECQCVK0) lotion under my body moisturizer too, and this sounds really braggy but I swear I constantly get compliments on how soft my skin is! It puts the lotion on the skin..."

SarahSnark,fftg9m0,t1_ffs6vs3,1580219690.0,"You probably are already using one but just in case you're not, I really recommend using a moisturizing toner under your moisturizer. I thought it would be all useless hype (but I had to try it because you know) but turns out they're really great. I swear by the Klairs Supple Preparation Toner and it's really good for all skin types. I have kind of a crazy moisturizing routine but I live in Wisconsin and never get dry skin in the winter so that's something! I use: Klair's, basic Clean and Clear salicylic acid moisturizer, Stratia Liquid Gold (it's amazing), rosehip oil, and then I sometimes add a very light layer of CeraVe Healing Ointment.  

Using the ointment or even Vaseline over your dry areas at night could really make a big difference too. Just make sure you have moisturizer underneath."

Like yeah, if you go onto a snark thread about someone and lay a ""truth bomb"" about how the snarkers are obsessed and crazy and shit, you're gonna get downvoted (not by me even, like I said, I'm happy to engage with dissenting opinions, but other people). It just makes me laugh. I do wish people would be polite, for sure. I guess it goes both ways. I wish people wouldn't automatically downvote and attack people with dissenting opinions, and I wish the people with those opinions would state them in a more nuanced, less blanket-statement ""y'all are all crazy"" way."

[Someone on Blogsnark](https://www.reddit.com/r/blogsnark/comments/ereojh/this_week_in_wtf_january_2026/ffcy2ym/) was questioning that the sub seems nastier to them lately. I don't think that's true, but whatever, we all have different snark lines, and I don't see any harm in talking about it. Here's my question to you guys. Why does everyone take downvotes soooo seriously? Everyone's like: ""You can't say anything positive, you'll be attacked, blah blah blah..."" but...it isn't some sort of Reddit right to be agreed with and upvoted all the time? Listen, I understand civil discourse and I think everyone should make an effort to be polite, and I get that it sucks to feel attacked and all, but damn, it just really seems to me that people take downvotes SO FREAKIN' SERIOUSLY.

This is so true! I'm one of those people actually (though I'm in the moderate range, not light). But I don't go around saying that because I know I don't actually have a huge overeating problem, just a mild one, and exercise really DOES allow me to eat without close monitoring.

xxfitness,ff6370s,t1_ff62thl,1579617989.0,Oh yes you are right! I do use them interchangeably but lately I've found myself thinking of it as strength training more (probably from always being on fitness subs and seeing the term more) and it is true people automatically assume lifting weights if you use that term.
xxfitness,ff62ah6,t1_ff61rl6,1579617325.0,"I try to say it really neutrally like: ""You could try strength training"", I don't actually tell them they have to or whatever I promise! I'm actually not talking about the gym at all, I'm a huge proponent of bodyweight fitness, (and stuff like gardening and being with kids, the women in my life do do that and walk which is GREAT and I'm not knocking it at all). I'm not a lecturer or a person who talks about fitness IRL *at all* unless it's brought it up but it's so hard when a person is complaining about something that you know a few bodyweight variations would go a long way toward helping, kwim? They don't have a bad reaction to it, they just have no reaction to it and the conversation moves on, which is fine because I'm not gonna be that person that pushes things, I guess this is just a rant to get it off my chest really. I suppose I just wish more people realized how great it is but it's something they have to come to themselves. 

I actually hate gyms and do all my workouts at home, primarily bodyweight fitness (and some dumbbells but they're not necessary, I just like them). 

ETA: I see my comments might be coming across as harsh to people. This is really mostly happening in my head, it's like when a person complains to you about not being able to lose weight and you know it's just calories but you also know it's pointless to try to say that. I guess I just feel *internally* frustrated that I know a cure for things but there's no way to get people to see it without being that evangelizing annoying fitness person.

Older (sixties) women in my life complain to me about feeling weak as they age, and I tell them (without lecturing, I just mention it) that the only cure for that is strength training and it's always just completely ignored, and it bothers me internally because it's SO important for women to do some form of strength training. I never get to go into it or even mention trying planks or anything because they never bite. It's obvious strength training is intimidating to people and they think they're incapable of it, even though they're absolutely not. AHH! I just hate how they talk about the deterioration of their strength as if it's a totally inevitable thing.

I've only ever had one person (friend in her late twenties at the time) in my life listen to me about it.

I highly recommend a once weekly 40 percent lactic acid (spot test first to make sure you react well to that ingredient) at home peel for scars/maintaining clear skin. It's actually a very gentle acid and it works really well! (Just be sure you don't exfoliate the next day and always wear sunscreen.) Oh yeah, and sunscreen too in general but I'm sure you're already doing that. 

[This](https://www.makeupartistschoice.com/products/muac-40-lactic-acid-peels) is the peel I use, highly recommend. No I'm not an ad. ;) I tried the higher concentrations of acid but they irritated my skin so I've been holding steady with forty percent for several years, always had amazing results! If you don't have experience with acids like this, be forewarned, they hurt, you don't have to leave it on the whole recommended time, you can build up to the recommended time. Even a couple of minutes will make a difference. 

ETA: Just read the comment with your awesome skincare routine! You got this on lockdown! I still totally recommend at home peels for scars, it REALLY helped mine. Our routines are extremely similar. Salicylic acid worked well for me but adding in the peel gave me truly glowing/micro-clear skin. The important thing is just no actives the day of/no actives day after."
xxfitness,fdz6fz2,t1_fdxma5k,1578787127.0,"I'm glad you did it too! Congrats! I'm so bad about working out when hungover. I either just skip it entirely or try for five or ten minutes and give up, though the last time I was hungover and had four hours of sleep I worked out and had the best workout ever, which was really fucking weird."
fatlogic,fdtpszk,t1_fds7re5,1578720329.0,"Yikes, that was pretty disgusting and disturbing. I think most people would be turned off by someone pushing food into their mouth while kissing, but she does not seem to get that at all. Nasty."
fatlogic,fdtjpn9,t1_fdrh0pt,1578717745.0,I developed an eating disorder because I was terrified of/hated being an adult woman and all the sexual attention that that brought. Not the only reason but a big one. Really blew my mind when I figured that out. Just wanting to disappear.
SmolBeanSnark,fds4y9g,t1_fds4lni,1578694454.0,Hi!! I lurk/comment a bit! I had to hop off the drama train because I realized it would truly take over my life to keep up with it but I still find CC so snarkable of course! And she hasn't paid her rent for months TWICE this year. SMDH.
xxfitness,fds02ql,t1_fdrid9t,1578692254.0,"I'm breathing deep and physically imagining dragging my belly button as far into my spine as a I can without full on ""sucking in"". Then I keep it there while I continue breathing steadily. For me consciously focusing on breathing helps me from getting too tense."
SmolBeanSnark,fdqua0n,t1_fdqeqo0,1578674998.0,Well your friend sounds like a genuinely okay person that means well. Caro could have every single person in her life remind her to pay rent and she *still* wouldn't do it because she'd rather spend the money on herself however she wants. I really don't think it's a mental health thing for her. I think it's a selfish brat thing. I know that's very harsh but all evidence points in that direction.
SmolBeanSnark,fdqmdmp,t1_fdqm9yk,1578670101.0,"Oh yeah, I totally agree. I thought they made it pretty clear from the beginning this was the direction they'd go in, with Archie not going into the royal life and all."
SmolBeanSnark,fdqm4cq,t1_fdqjvb6,1578669934.0,"I just use the plain low fat Greek kind from whatever brand is on sale! I look at protein amount too and try to get one with a high amount of protein. I love having it on hand because I use it in everything, sweet and savory. I will say it's still pretty tangy even with adding chocolate. I personally like that but I know some people add honey to sweeten it up. That or even a sprinkling of sugar would be good I'm sure.  A lot of times for breakfast I'll have greek yogurt with banana, almonds, and chocolate chips, and it's amazing! Good with Cool Whip on top too. (And Cool Whip is pretty low calorie.) Definitely curbs a sweets craving. 

Anytime you can get protein in with a snack it's a good thing. Will really help keep you satiated and with your fitness goals. So if you want cookies...take a cookie and crumble it in yogurt! I swear by yogurt. It's SO good for you for so many reasons. 

ETA: If I did pick up flavored yogurt I'd go for the Key Lime kind. That stuff is amazing and goes really well with chocolate chips too. I just get the plain kind for versatility. I'm thinking of making my own lime yogurt."
SmolBeanSnark,fdqllxi,t1_fdqli3e,1578669602.0,Yup. And Caro doesn't get the difference between fiction and real life so she bought the whole spiel hook line and sinker and went to try to live it. And she wasn't the only one by far!
SarahSnark,fdqjy0b,t1_fdqjhke,1578668489.0,"Haha yup. Apparently she's so mentally ill that it's wrong to be glad she's kicked out of her super expensive West Village apartment and has to live with Grandma in Florida for not paying rent AGAIN. Cry me a river. I'm sorry, she's a selfish grifter, not some mentally ill person that needs to be in an institution or something. These types of people are a dime a dozen. I don't understand why so many people ALWAYS gives her the benefit of the doubt. 

ETA: I'm not ""gleeful"" she potentially got kicked out of her apartment, but she's not homeless or anything, she's living with her grandma in Florida. She's fine. So I don't feel sorry for her for actually having to face consequences to her shitty behavior."

SmolBeanSnark,fdqf8mx,t1_fdnnl2h,1578665146.0,I really like mixing chocolate chips with greek yogurt. The yogurt is healthy and filling and the chocolate is delicious and not too much because it's just a sprinkle. And there's a nice crunch factor too!
SmolBeanSnark,fdqf381,t1_fdq4er2,1578665029.0,"It's the dumbest take too since Harry and Meghan aren't completely renouncing their royal status and still plan to profit off the Sussex name. (I don't have a dog in this fight or care, just pointing out facts.)"
SmolBeanSnark,fdqevf1,t1_fdqbt3n,1578664861.0,She's a snob living out her delusional Carrie from SATC alternate reality.
SmolBeanSnark,fdqetfz,t1_fdq9139,1578664819.0,She's an entitled grifter with a shopping addiction. Lots of people like this out there. Lots and lots of people that just...stop paying rent and do whatever they want with the money they make/have instead. My mom's sixty-year old brother just had to move in with her for this reason.

xxfitness,fdnfk2x,t1_fdmkhjf,1578584736.0,I don't get cravings for food too bad during PMS but my energy is so low and I get completely lethargic. I try to workout because that helps a bit but I take it real easy and don't beat myself up for not meeting personal bests or progressing. Sometimes I take an extra rest day and don't sweat it.
fatlogic,fdlvd73,t1_fdjbl05,1578533377.0,"That is absolutely the idea and it can work really well for people that don't overeat that much to begin with and really just need to cut out a superfluous snack/meal. Or people that binge eat at certain times, whatever. You can build your fasting window during that time to exclude all temptation. 

But it's still all CICO in the end and people need to realize that. It's just a tool."
