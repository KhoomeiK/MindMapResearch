Blep,fep29v9,t3_eq3o7t,1579310525.0,Hahah! Why does it look cuter when they are mad?
aww,fellq9j,t1_fel3ubv,1579225187.0,"Lol, I think you missed the puppy on top of it."
aww,fdtau24,t1_fdsl2n3,1578714174.0,"I agree, but can we all agree that the person/people who would spray paint TRASH on a dog (most likely commit horribly abuse to it) and dump it, are horrible people who don’t deserve to even be considered normal?"
socialwork,fdrxc1j,t1_fdq02bn,1578691156.0,"I think this is something you learn more about once you are in the profession, but you kind of have to trust your gut and the professional code of ethics/ conduct. As well as what you are comfortable with sharing. My rule of thumb is that is something that helps the client and I relate, helps them feel comfortable, and/or helps them gain something from the session. In addition to that, don’t over due it and make the session about you. If you aren’t sure it is appropriate, don’t share it, and if needed universalize it by saying something like “I think many people experience...” rather than “I have done that too.”"
socialwork,fdrwxvm,t3_emlu02,1578690926.0,"I had a therapist once that was exactly like this. She never gave any self disclosure and it kinda of annoyed me. Like I don’t want to know inappropriate details of your life, but give me something. I think it kind of extra irked me because I am a social worker and I would have liked some kind of professional acknowledgment. She was a great therapist, it just rubbed me the wrong way."
FuckYouKaren,fdrw00w,t3_emvcyt,1578690588.0,"I knew one. She wasn’t a Karen-y kind of Karen, but very immature and some majorly annoying habits. I think there a more Gen-X Karen’s anyway. But let’s be honest, every generation has their spoiled, entitled Bitches."
aww,fdrutkp,t3_emqh05,1578690133.0,Omfg! I am melting!!
aww,fdruogv,t1_fdru81c,1578690050.0,I knew as soon as I saw it. I love my Catahoula. I would adopt another one in a heartbeat.
aww,fcw5zq4,t1_fcuriai,1578017942.0,I have heard of people having their dogs pet napped from their yard and sold on Craigslist. Especially if it is a pure bread/popular breed- easy way for someone who is desperate to make money.
socialwork,fcw5eho,t3_ej7h76,1578017554.0,"What state are you in? In this profession that makes a difference. I agree with volunteering as much as you can and try to get varied experiences. My program required us to get 30 hours of volunteer experience before we could even apply for the program (yes- a BSW program). But, I got a lot of hands on experience and started build connections with other professionals. You’re reputation and ability to follow through is almost everything in this field. Don’t be afraid to try out different things and start figuring out what you like and don’t like. And yes, enjoy the ride and learn as much as you can. Welcome!! :)
Edit- also be confident in yourself and don’t let anyone tell you that social workers are less than any other professional. We are the shit- so educated, so versatile, so helpful. Don’t sell yourself short."
clevercomebacks,fcw4iqs,t1_fcuxgai,1578016968.0,"I have one, but I don’t usually need it."
clevercomebacks,fcufgjz,t1_fctzawe,1577979678.0,"Agreed! I flip mine over to prevent it from distracting me from my work or life. Unfortunately I use mine for work, so I have to check it throughout the day, but otherwise it’s on silent or DND. My family also know that if it’s important, you call me otherwise I will respond when I get around to it."
aww,fcp2l3r,t1_fcp2dd3,1577848538.0,Go grandma! I love to hear it when people live a full life and defy stereotypes.
aww,fcoxza5,t1_fcoahew,1577844680.0,Happy birthday in advance and props to you for embracing technology!
socialwork,fafmil8,t1_faf9wr5,1576026508.0,"Not sure how long you have been in the field, but I recommend you try out some different things. Don’t give up yet. My last job made me want to quit this field too, but I feel learned a lot from the experience and it really made me search for my values and desires as a professional. I think finding the right agency, field, and likeminded professionals really helps."
