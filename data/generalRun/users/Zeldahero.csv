Many topics are discussed in Enoch's book, some of them include things like the Nephilim, corrupt angels, a great flood, and a highly advanced wisdom and warning for humanity. Some of you did not know, the Book of Enoch is an ancient manuscript containing the life and teachings of Enoch, a biblical character and Noah's grandfather. It was associated with God.  


Enoch was appointed by God as his messenger and in return, God imparted knowledge to him. His mission was to spread knowledge throughout the world. Finally, Enoch escaped from his enemies and arrived in the kingdom of God."
