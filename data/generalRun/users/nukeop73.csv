canada,fdnx2n0,t1_fdntxww,1578594598.0,Yep. I agree. If it wasn't for oil the US (and the UK) wouldn't be giving a shit about the middle east. You're just a dupe if you believe otherwise.

I sympathize but honestly can't put myself in your shoes. ...But from certain more positive threads I've read on reddit, we are currently living in the safest and best times in the history of the world.  It's hard to believe with all the negative media, I know .  It's really all they do.  A scared world is a profitable world.  But if you really take the time ( currently for you not easy I'm sure)  you'll see the truth emerge through all the shit.   I hope things get better."
