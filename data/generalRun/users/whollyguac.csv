 Where football excels is in it's complexities. An offense is capable of running hundreds of plays from multiple formations.  The time in-between plays is spent strategizing and analyzing the other team in order to react, whearease in baseball it's mostly dirt kicking and chew spitting.

Players range from 175lbs to about 400.
