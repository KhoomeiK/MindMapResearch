That never happens, but then here come Christmas it snowed a few days before yay! White Christmas! Wrong. It all melted from rain and sun on Christmas Eve. One year it snowed in July. But snow is really magical when it’s falling it blocks out all sounds making the world sound silent and at night if it’s snowing it will be bright you can see everything it’s like a grey lamp is on its so crazy. Also the snow never lies. You can see whether something or someone has walked acrossed your yard etc snow is amazing and I don’t want to live somewhere where it doesn’t snow"

BorderlinePDisorder,fdj45vm,t1_fdito7v,1578457962.0,Thank you for that honestly and my mom is a special education teacher and they both understand mental health issues but they will over react to it and then in a week or two say I’m not doing things the way I’m supposed and to not use my bpd (if I do have it) as an excuse even though I never would have. I did talk to my psychology teacher about it though and she gave me one of her books that has a few pages on it to read I read through it multiple times and I really feel like I have it so I tried leaving the book open to the page that has the symptoms and sticky notes by the symptoms with six of them saying yes this is me one says no and one says sometimes and I thought maybe they would bring it out ask who’s it was (I have siblings) and I could start the convo that way but they ignored it for all I know
