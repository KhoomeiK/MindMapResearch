If she was fighting off a URI the stress of meeting a new cat with a Queen attitude might've made her illness last longer than it needed to. In my experience it seems like fixed males are easier to integrate in a new house whereas multiple females you often have one taking a dominant role. Right now at my house we have my cat Pixel and Sophie whom my folks took in. Pixel is 2 years old now so she is testing the Queenship with the resident Calico now and then, but Sophie can still kick her tuckus. They don't have any actual real fights, just hissy fits where Pixel annoys Sophie lol.

I don't sweat the kill vs. no-kill shelter. For me a kill shelter is just a shelter that needs help from the community in order to be a no-kill shelter. To be considered no-kill, a shelter has to have a certain % of the animals that enter the shelter get adopted. Besides adopting out their animals, they can reach this % by refusing to take in animals they consider to be unadoptable or sending animals that have been in the shelter too long to a ""kill shelter"". Those shelters usually are funded by government grants besides private donations and so they don't reject as many animals as some private no-kill shelters might. They can and do become no-kill shelters all in their own right though with donations from the local community, volunteers and fosters, and programs the shelter comes up with to entice people to adopt and get the community involved.  Hannah Shaw aka kittenxlady on youtube has a great [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpaKT6v_mAw) about it.   


The shelter I foster for is considered a no-kill shelter I believe we had a 98% adoption rate last year. It is also a Humane Society shelter so it reached that goal because of community involvement, the awesome volunteers, and wonderful donors. They have taken in cats and dogs from hoarding cases, animals that have been abused, one kitty came in last year with a degloved paw/arm that had to be amputated. Everyone who volunteers or works at a shelter I like to think chose to because they want to help animals. Yes, even if they are doing it for mandatory community service.    


If people want a kill shelter to be a no kill shelter, then they should roll up their sleeves and figure out what they can do to give the shelter a helping hand up.

I see it more as you can pet a secure pet. 

An insecure or vulnerable animal needs touch in order to thrive. So for me ""touch bonding"" is as much of a duty as is feeding and making sure they go potty. A fun one for sure, but still an important one. So I differentiate it from petting. Maybe I'm silly but it works for me. :)"

learningtocat,ffd897z,t1_ffd70fn,1579815345.0,"Basically what its called. Bonding with another being through the power of touch. Humans and animals do it all the time. When moms give birth, they put the newborn baby on their mommas chest for skin to skin contact for the first touch bond experience. [Hugs are good for your health you know](https://www.healthline.com/health/hugging-benefits#1). :)

When you see kittens with their momma, you see momma licking them all the time she is with them, that is stimulating them with touch as well as grooming them. Her body, her licking, and her purring is giving them that bonding experience. When you have orphan kittens you have to simulate that for them since they don't have a momma. I keep their bin under my desk so every now and then I would run my fingers over them to give them the experience of being fussed over even if it wasn't feeding time yet."

learningtocat,ffazabe,t1_ffavnyo,1579747956.0,Thank you! It's been quite a journey. Xerxes who is featured in this video was a singlet who didn't want to bottle feed at first. He and Damona were the first two bottle babies that I brought home from the shelter a day apart. I tried to feed Xerxes every hour for about 7 hours that first day.

learningtocat,ffaok7k,t1_ffamisv,1579740817.0,"What I do is redirect their play to appropriate toys. So if they are biting and scratching my hand I would make a loud noise like ""OW that hurts!"" which startles them out of their mindset and take my hand away. Later I bring a chaser toy or a plushie and play with them and they learn that those toys are the type that are ok to beat up. Cats are predator animals so ""play"" with them is prey. You can't really punish a pet, they don't understand why they are being punished for something. But you can give them positive reinforcement. If you only use your hands to pet them and feed them they associate your hands as good things and not prey to stalk and kill. 

If you have a cat that whose behaviour is ""wild"" in regards to destructive in the house then he might be bored and not be getting enough stimulation during the day or he might be scared and be feeling insecure territorially. Cat behavior is really their way of communicating to their guardians. If they are messing outside the litterbox, fighting, marking, attacking people or other animals, that is their way of saying there is something off either with them medically or with their environment."
