detrans,ffjm2en,t3_etzhg0,1580001373.0,Giving a kid hormones pretty much guarantees they’ll be paying a therapist their whole life.  It’s in their profit motive.  “It’s very hard to get a man to understand something that his paycheck depends on him not understanding”
JustBootThings,fffugr5,t1_ffftimz,1579892051.0,The military is a perfectly valid option that graduating high schoolers should be made aware of.  It’s a hell of a lot better than $200K in debt to go to Full Sail.
TrueOffMyChest,fffu6c9,t3_et5f4s,1579891871.0,"Is this the first time in history where people have been *trying* to enter the oppressed classes, in order to have greater political power and their voices be given more weight?  Orrrrr have we made an error with our classification of “oppression”."

detrans,ffdh484,t1_ffbdmi9,1579820739.0,"It's a placeholder for the legal advocacy groups whose interest it's in for more people to be transgender.  I'm sure there are medical and psychological lobbying groups who push it too, I just picked the ADL because they're one of the most visible and widely known legal groups.

I used to have this misconception that if someone is discriminatory to you, the legal process itself allows you to punish the discrimination.  That this stuff happens automatically; if something unjust happens a team of lawyers will automatically be willing to help you.  Boy oh boy was I wrong, this legal support only happens if correcting the injustice fits the agenda of those in power.  The legal groups that will eagerly help you sue if a doctor is too slow to prescribe hormones will leave you totally out in the cold if you want redress for a doctor recklessly giving hormones to a depressed 13 year old.  They serve agendas, not justice in and of itself."
detrans,ffdfcht,t1_ffbihzi,1579819697.0,Because there's a systemic effort from those in power to sell confused children a lie that will lead to a lifetime of pain and regret and in many cases suicide.
todayilearned,ffakfg2,t1_ff91cn6,1579737948.0,"Officers get better food and quarters, but have to work *longer* hours than their troops and put themselves in greater danger.  It’s not “the Boatswain’s gunnery mate goes down with the ship”."
worldpolitics,ffagako,t1_ff7mrqa,1579735065.0,If you’re from Virginia that is demonstrably untrue.
detrans,ffacnw1,t3_esj2sn,1579732416.0,"Because a team of ADL lawyers will sue their tits off for transphobic gender discrimination if the doctors do anything besides total enabling.  It’s funny/sad to read /r/detrans posts crying “why did nobody tell me?!?!” and a year prior in their post history they’re talking about disowning their stupid racist bigot relatives for not being supportive enough when they came out.

These detrans people, who correctly feel broken and lied to and want their voices heard, are in for a hard lesson on what it’s like to advocate for an identity that *doesn’t* carry the agenda of those in power.  If they thought their voices were marginalized before as trans people, the trans regret people are going to find out what that’s really like."

tucker_carlson,ff7afgo,t1_ff6sk34,1579644594.0,">the african american community as a whole can't qualify

Of course they can.  The more money going from white people to their own people the better, they'd see zero downside making you also cut a check to a Jamaican who got here last week.  The whole ""hurr how do you define a white person?"" thing is just a game they run on you because you're the only one dumb/weak enough to believe it, they don't believe it themselves.  Black people have zero trouble deciding who's a black person."
washingtondc,ff7a3qw,t1_ff79qec,1579644328.0,"Racism doesn't require intent, it's an institutional system of laws and norms that put a disproportionate burden on black and brown bodies which these overpolicing laws do.  Look up the arrest records, it's almost exclusively people of color.  A latinx single mother working three jobs doesn't have the luxury to spend an hour cooking dinner at home like a white man does and that's if she even has the option to buy groceries since capitalism and redlining produces food deserts that force her and black folx to buy processed food from corner stores and fast food joints.  Try having empathy and educating yourself on the systems of oppression that dominate our white supremacist culture."
TumblrInAction,ff782w0,t3_erwh6j,1579642964.0,I run in circles that include a number of dirty kids/crust punks.  Some have offhandedly told me about people who have offered them money to go to political rallies.
tucker_carlson,ff77cq2,t1_ff76d33,1579642563.0,The actual conditions of the country are that you are *never* going to get black and Hispanic people to en masse tuck their shirts into their Dockers and start carrying around well-thumbeds copies of FA Hayek.  You are *never* going to le logical and rational prove to them that they don't want your money or more people like them in the country to enhance their power to get your money.  There is no political way out of this.
TumblrInAction,ff76h1g,t1_ff6xgl2,1579642066.0,"Look up the rape rates of African-American GIs in liberated France or Russians in the east.  American soldiers had higher rates of sexual assault *in the US*, than Germany did in the foreign territories they occupied.  Relative to the Germans, the soldiers they fought were in fact savages."
tucker_carlson,ff75uw4,t1_ff75i6a,1579641725.0,Lol I typed out the same comment as you.  It's really cool how quickly these (absolutely bulletproof) talking points and stats are spreading.
tucker_carlson,ff75nxu,t3_es17g5,1579641616.0,There are opinion surveys of enlisted US WW2 GIs; something like 95% of them opposed immigration and a similar number believed that Jewish people had control of finance and the media.

PoliticalHumor,ff72wgl,t1_ff71b0y,1579640040.0,I don't consider actively making your own citizenry less safe to be a service.  Without our military in the Middle East there'd have been no 9/11.  No Boston Marathon bombing.  No Garland shooting.  They aren't running terrorist attacks Argentina or Japan.
PoliticalHumor,ff715sn,t3_ertxgu,1579639059.0,"People who talk about ""serving"" are a joke.  99% of them just did it for free college and money with benefits, and chose the military because they didn't have a better option to attain those. Not that there's anything wrong with that, but it's no more selfless than another job for attaining those.  And more selfish than doing so in a way that doesn't kill a million Arabs and lead to a flood of migrants and terror attacks in our own countries just to placate Israeli neuroticism.  Without our military presence in the Middle East there would have been no 9/11.  You make the country less safe, not more."
