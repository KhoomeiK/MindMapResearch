SuicideWatch,ffhkahf,t1_ffhj37c,1579939176.0,"The thing is, you wont be able to reap the benefits once you commit to it. Chances are the only effects you’ll have on others afterwards are negative towards them. 

You seem to be articulate enough that I’d imagine you have a lot to offer others when you’re in a good frame of mind."

I don’t know how I found myself in the sub Reddit, most likely purely by chance. I had a long day at work today, and an even longer day at home before hand. I wouldn’t say it’s the shittiest moment I’ve had in my life, but it certainly feels like that when you’re experiencing it in the now.

One of the things about attention, is that every human is wired to receive it as positive reinforcement. Everybody wants attention with the exception of those crazy few that live alone in Alaska with their dog in isolation. 

The thing about attention from others is that some people don’t always receive it while others receive it and excess. It’s disproportionate, and it’s incredibly unfair. But it’s the way life is. One of the things about incredulously, crazy, life altering situations like suicide is that they’re pretty much guaranteed to get positive feedback. 

Attention is an addiction. much like most addictions, receiving it and small dosages from time to time can really benefit self esteem and lighten regular hardships. Receiving high dosages at one point, and then not at all afterwards could lead to with drawl situations.

Personally, I felt that even though I don’t get a lot of positive reinforcement on a regular basis, looking for it makes it worse than finding it rarely. 

I guess what I’m saying is, it’s nicer just to go out and do what you normally would do and let the positive attention come naturally, rather than looking for it. It’s worth it in the end just to be patient"

Its inspiring to remember that they represent an incredibly small fraction of the population however loud and obnoxious they are.

If you have the determination to make it through months of training, not to mention stay up for a week straight essentially doing non-regular exercises, you can probably grind your ass through a degree summa cum laude. The fact that he got into Harvard med school not to mention a mass general residency is insane, but I can’t imagine any admissions person would see his resume and go “maybe we can find a better fit.” No way
