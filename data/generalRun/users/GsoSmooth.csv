Games,fd5xxei,t1_fd5s6rm,1578182897.0,That's what I like too. I'll never replay a game as big as the Witcher. But RE7... Or Bloodborne I could do.
gadgets,fd5tesn,t1_fd2zbqu,1578181302.0,"Man, I get that people don't want to have to buy multiple systems to experience all the games, I know I don't buy more than one, but exclusive games are important. Having good exclusive games sells systems. It provides incentive to these companies to make good games. Microsoft and Sony wouldn't help developers nearly as much if there wasn't the same competitive atmosphere regarding exclusivity. IMO. Nintendo makes good games exclusively for their systems because it sells the system. They wouldn't sell much if you could buy Zelda on the PS4. Sure they'd probably sell more software, but there would not be the same drive to make as many games as they do."
Games,fd2bfbl,t1_fd2b7iw,1578144747.0,I'm also an RPG fan and as much as I loved persona 5 it was really long and I stopped halfway in the middle only to resume a year later. Same with the Witcher 3.
onguardforthee,fd2b2aa,t1_fd0u924,1578144565.0,Is it bad that I want to try that?
Games,fd27vtc,t1_fd24moc,1578143076.0,For me it's less that I prefer Indies and more that I prefer smaller games. Lots of respect for games like resident evil for not being 100 fucking hours.
Games,fd27dej,t1_fd25ywy,1578142842.0,"I would say that ""glimpses of a great game"" do not make it the most underrated game of the generation."

delusionalartists,fctm7iq,t1_fcta9qv,1577948588.0,It's a spectacle of computing no doubt.
canada,fcoj9l8,t1_fcnqim1,1577833608.0,It's just natural life expectancy. It is assumed that by that point a certain percentage of panels will have failed or will be inefficient enough to warrant a full replacement. But 25 years is industry standard for most electrical equipment. Most power generation facilities need pretty significant upgrades every 25 to 30 years as well.
canada,fcoj20e,t1_fcn4hja,1577833452.0,"Biggest issues with nuclear is that it's all or nothing. They are such insanely expensive projects, that take a ridiculous amount of time, that it's impossible to get the ball rolling on one without being extremely optimistic on the numbers. Otherwise no authority would ever bite on one. I'm pretty pro nuclear, but their initial costs and ongoing costs are far greater than any other project, and because it's done so rarely, it's really hard to compare. Makes it hard to argue for it as there isn't a huge stack of relevant nuclear projects to debate with."
canada,fcoihxo,t1_fco9sup,1577833046.0,The prices are caused by the agreed upon price the renewables got in FIT (feed in tariff) programs. They were really only given out for a year or two as it became very clear they were overpaying. But now we're kind of stuck. These contracts are from about 10 years ago.
todayilearned,fclm2tv,t1_fcl1tgt,1577750976.0,Not unusual. In Canada and us you ate supposed to report your tips as taxable income. Usually the cash tips.go underreported though
todayilearned,fcllywm,t1_fclkti9,1577750899.0,I do see tip jars all over though. I feel like it won't be too long u til it is half expected in Australia. But also the bar service is horrible.
todayilearned,fcllpgz,t1_fcl1jpe,1577750722.0,In Thailand it's not required but is accepted. I have been asked straight up for a tip there too. It is genuinely appreciated.
