alphacentauri,ff9ivok,t3_eqzrgq,1579713961.0,"u/Oopthealley and u/AlphaCentauriBear might have gotten b to me.  I think I was looking at tiles all wrong after 20 years of single player play.  Maybe you can correct how I am reading things now.  I viewed City production (and forests) as a matter of production within the confines of the city.  After reading posts as far back as '99, the question I should have asked was not about forests, but about production.  Production should be viewed through the spectrum of extending outside the city limits with supply crawlers.  These are kind of an interior version of a worker (one resource) with benefits of not being limited by number or range.  With that in mind, forests are ideal based on your descriptions not because of one resource, but because workers can get all resources with relatively small investment from terraforming.  These leaves terraformers available for other projects (boreholes) that produce a more robust return for a crawler (6+ minerals vs 2 for a forest tile).   So, workers don't have to tend the fields for the highest nutrient returns; that can be done by a crawler on a tile developed outside the city with a lower investment (no need for solar collectors). 
So, as I try to transition from the Dark Ages, my question is how souls I transition the number of cities/colony pods I develop?  I would easily make 150-200 cities exploiting virtually every inch of land.  Instead, I can use crawlers to support far more developed city centers with higher production and yields.  How many of these cities should I look to have? Or rather, what type of spacing should I use? Any suggestions on trawlers for land locked cities looking to exploit sea-based resources.

I really appreciate your expertise and patience in really causing a fundamental shift in how I view the game"

history,ff7tzj9,t3_es14ev,1579658318.0,"I read Reminiscences by Douglas MacArthur like 3 times as a kid.  That is what happens when your grandfather is a farmer that served in the South Pacific.  During the buildup, of the '30s, I don't think he was in the US Army.  He got an extravagant job setting up the Philippines army.  It isn't fair to say he did nothing after he was brought back in the Army.  He went into pretty great detail on how woefully supported his troops we're by the US government.  He drew on his long history of fighting in the Philippines from his younger years in the military and tried to set up guerilla warfare.  They often had WWI-era weapons, and would set up caches along the jungle, often with the intent of firing their old rifles until out of ammo before dropping it and running.  
In all, the Japanese routed countries with far larger armies (China) and defeated other Western powers (British).  The way he framed it, he was stuck with what he had and tried to make the best out of it. Given his history of the Rainbow Brigade in WWI to the invasion of Inchon, the guy seemed to have a really good history of seeing what others didn't.  It kinda makes me think he didn't just shit the bed in the Philippines.  But, that was stuff I read 30 years ago, and maybe history judges him differently now"

alphacentauri,feznn78,t1_feziyvm,1579459393.0,"Thanks! It is something to think about.  I think the early cap on farms to 2 nutrients really makes this attractive.
With tree farms costing 120 minerals, how established does the city and forest have to be to justify the terraformer time and building cost?  Is it viable for new bases in the far flung reaches of the map trying to establish away from the core?"
alphacentauri,fezm1ol,t3_di0au9,1579458855.0,"I usually send a terraformer in to put a condenser down early in less desirable locations.  Usually by the time planetary transit is an option, the best locations are taken. 
That leaves the B and C options.  These are not bad areas, but lack clear benefit without enhancement.  These can be quite beneficial in later gameplay with Cloning Vats and Ascetic Virtues coupled with increased output of fungus squares.
Ideally, when I start, I will get a scout rover for a deep search.  I like to build early formers, depending on techs, from my first city with the idea that one or two will build roads to the next most desirable locations.  It is a bit of an investment early, but it increases travel by 3x. Once I can make condensers, I usually plop one down along the route (I usually do hilly terrain bc I rarely make mines).  
I have also gotten more heavily involved with raising terrain.  I have taken some bad locations and turned them into a list oasis in a few turns (I almost always double up on boreholes and raising terrain).  One of the benefits, bringing it back to condensers, is that you can often get a square outside city limits, which becomes nice late game. 
Also, don't be afraid to overlap cities in very late game.  Once they get to the numbered bases, you will likely only reach population limits with Cloning Vats.  At that time, I just focus on Recreation Commons, Network Nodes, and have complex/dome.  My last game finished had many of those cities at 20ish by virtue of lush green everywhere covered with farms.  
As one user pointed out, I should focus more on using drop pods more in gameplay.  Hope that long response helps"

Wellthatsucks,fe3k86f,t1_fe1yiwi,1578850036.0,"In all fairness, the word QI and CHI are vastly different in pinyin for both their meaning and pronunciation.  To say the spelling of the word in English is the standard is silly, because the word is a character that had been romanized.   Each vowel has an added ""mark"" that changes the tone (the inflection of the pronunciation).
 
CH, SH, and ZH have there own set of rules when followed by I.  CHI ( like chirp without the P), SHI (like shirt without the t) and ZHI (like jerk without the K) are some of the hardest things for westerners to learn. QI, on the other hand, is pronounced like the ""Chee"" you are expecting.  (As a sidenote, my heart always breaks when people pronounce the surname Zhang as Zang).

I like to think it is Chinese language with Chinese rules, and we accepted their romanization meant to standardize and simplify communication.  To that end, the spellings you present are different words.  I hope that makes you more comfortable with using words from Chinese (Mandarin or Cantonese) such as LI, YEN, QI and WOK

I watched in Iraq as a complex ambush unfolded in the night on the middle of our 3 trucks.  It opened with an RPG that went through the windshield, cutting into the driver, smashing through the bones of the gunner's left arm, and impacting next to the JAFO's head.  The Gunner has a Mk-19, and the ammo from the kinetic energy of the underated RPG set it ablaze.  This took a fraction of a second to initiate the attack.  The driver feel out of the truck and was shot and screaming, the JAFO lay face first in the fire, and the gunner couldn't charge the ghost round of the Mk-19.  He picked up an M249 SAW in the burning heap with his one functional arm and preceded to fight off 20 bad guys while the medic (me) tended to the wounded in order to get everyone out.  I cannot begin to tell you the size of that dude's balls, especially when the extent of his injuries became obvious in the aid station that would ultimately mark the end of his days in combat.

Back to your point about WWII, I have often wondered how many victories/defeats or lives saved/lost lay on the souls of these superhuman efforts.  It was mesmerizing to watch.  You saw someone literally defy what I would think is possible.  If it was a movie, I would have said it seemed fake, and yet...

AskReddit,fbidx1h,t3_ediqd6,1576898215.0,"I guess mine is three pronged, and I have no reason to feel one of the pronged has more weight.  I would start by saying I was always skeptical.  I came from a fairly religious family, so it wasn't for a lack of exposure.

I spent my ""college years"" deployed to Iraq.  I remember thinking of I ever found religion, it would be there.  Instead, I found chaos and hate.  When people try to identify enjoy as the devil, it was so easy to instead see it as the actions and feeling of man.  I can say I did things I was not proud of while there. Over my year, I saw a consuming pattern of acts driven by growing hatred and resentment.  I didn't have to look to some religious source: we lived through constant IEDs, I saw my best friend killed by a sniper, I watched marriages collapse.  I didn't need to offload the reasons because it was very obvious to me that we were reaping the product of a crappy job in a crappy place.

As I left that world and transitioned to student, I fell madly in love with a nanoscientist.  She ran a lab just outside the university I took grad classes at.  I would read anything with nanotech to impress her, talk with her, etc.  Her specially was the new field of graphene.  Every day, she would go to work and manipulate carbon atoms at their very fundamental levels to create monolayers carbon.  We would talk about it like we would talk about making dinner.  She would share electron scans of these matters like pictures from a holiday.  There is a sense of power from this that didn't involve a diety.  The fundamental fabric of our world was being manipulated by a girl who just as easily made tea for me.

My future did not like in material science. I would go on after that to become a physician (sadly, med school and the nanoscientist's dream job on a different coast would end that relationship).  I would do a lot of nifty stuff with anesthesia, both in the OR and in ICUs that people treated like a miracle.  It was mundane physiology and pharmacology to me.  I knew I couldn't help everyone; I knew some people would pull through despite how bad it looked. I saw every type of person come through, really sinners and saints, and all the same rules would apply to them.  

I kinda wish I could be religious. It would be nice to push off the stress of daily life to some grand plan from a loving creator.  I just see it as a culmination of choices, both good and bad, mixed in with things we can control and not control.  It is very difficult to walk back from that realization"
