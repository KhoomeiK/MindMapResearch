your list is pretty exhaustive.

The only thing i can think of is to figure out the motivation / inspiration. The reason why we all write in the first place. Hopefully the need to write is internal agency and not external expectation. 

To fix it - IMO - we could 

for BO - make it a habit. commit to it. show up to write everyday. 
for BI - see it as a craft. work on each element of this craft."

The writers block unpacked. It can be categorized as '

blocked inside (BI) / blocked outside (BO)

BI

* Broken - Something feels broken
* Uninspired - Character / Plots / Beats
* Sucks - The writing
* Monster-in-the-middle - Mushy middles.

BO:

* Life - too much living - too little writing
* Environment - Spot / Weather / Material
* Hard - The writing is laborious
* Ideas - None or too many. Empty or cluttered mind."

is one path more scenic?

or takes too long? or is too short?

has too many distractions or none?

We have to construct such a path for each of our readers and pick one for them to ""see and experience"" as they read."
