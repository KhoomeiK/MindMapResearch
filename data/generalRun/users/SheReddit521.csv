Birmingham,ffpl87g,t3_eui60l,1580097797.0,I dislike their food but when the tacos are $2 it's a quick and cheap bite (especially since dos hermanos closes at 3)
vulvodynia,ffpa66j,t1_ffp6kd8,1580089988.0,I believe mine was caused by injury too when I was a kid because my first tampon killed as well. I slipped on a bunkbed ladder and landed right on my crotch. I'm a far way to having kids though.. do you think because it just stretched things out so much..?
books,ffotwwz,t3_eubud2,1580081773.0,"I use to frequent the movies but ever since my husband bought a 65 inch tv and we invested in a good sofa I never want to. It's expensive,  dirty and people always bring in screaming children even for PG 13+ films at night. I'd rather wait for the movie to come out on Amazon and sit home with alcohol and my own snacks."

television,ffn2imf,t1_ffkkvbh,1580061297.0,I've had Midwife recommended to me many times and I've tried to watch it mamy times but just couldnt get into it. Does it take a while to develop? (I've only made it into the 2nd episode)

povertyfinance,ffjyy86,t1_ffjr7c0,1580010810.0,I always get that vibe at high end shops but have to remind myself the employees there probably make minimum wage lol.
povertyfinance,ffjyphh,t3_etvb0f,1580010618.0,"I've asked that question to so many lenders, even for houses that are way under my budget.  You can often negotiate the closing cost or have the seller pay it if you find something during the inspection. If you can even shave off $100 off of it hey a penny saved is a penny earned. No one has ever been condescending. It's a few thousand dollars you are often looking at;  I think it's very wise to ask what the closing costs are"
vulvodynia,ffh91ua,t3_et2dpe,1579926618.0,I believe mine was caused by an injury too because I always had trouble with tampons and riding bikes hurt after long stretches when I was a teen. When I was a kid I slipped on a bunkbed ladder and landed right on my crotch. I believe maybe we have nerve trauma because like you nothing works. I just got a vestibulectomy but wont know if it's worked until a couple of months...

KimiNoNaWa,ffh5z1b,t3_etcxd6,1579924043.0,It's really hard to watch other films similar to this since it's a hard one to top. I really liked silent voice but wasnt really into garden of words or 5cmm
KimiNoNaWa,ffh5qro,t1_ffftl65,1579923859.0,I though Garden of Words was so strange. I couldnt get over the foot fetishes and the fact she was like 30 and he was like 15. If it hadn't been for those 2 things I wouldve loved it

vulvodynia,ffgbkf4,t1_fffm1e1,1579902626.0,Your regular obgyn sounds like she doesnt know what this is and thinks its in your head; which is why she is suggesting therapy. That's ridiculous. Along with dilators you can hook your thumb in with some lube. stretch on one side then downward toward your butt (it will feel like you're pooping lol) and to  the left and right sides. Hold each stretch for 30 seconds and do it a few times every day. Your right PT is expensive and that's what they spent most of the time doing for me.

vulvodynia,ffebhg6,t3_et4shf,1579842148.0,"Hm, I've never heard of going to a chiropractor for this. Ask around for a gynecologist, specifically a pelvic pain specialist. Typically course of treatment,  after bacteria and fungus are ruled out,  are antidepressants, trigger point or botox injections, physical therapy (Also find a pelvic specialist, not just any schmuck - treatment usually involves stretching the vagina/vulva, heat therapy, stretches, etc, - this was the most successful for me but just lessened pain and didn't make it go away), and finally a vestibulectomy which removes vulva skin (not sure if it's worked for me yet, still recovering from recent surgery, which wasn't as horrid as I thought it would be) . I've been to two specialists in Boston and Birmingham AL and this is the course of treatment they usually run through. However my current doc said he just went to a vulvodynia conference and the newest research says most of it doesn't work besides PT and vestibulectomy. Best of luck, it totally sucks."

Birmingham,ff7g1zx,t1_ff79ock,1579648720.0,"That house you showed as an example was particularly amazing; from my daily search and alerts it seems most of the flipped homes sit on the market for a while and will probably end up selling in the 150-200 range.

corgi,fevvmce,t1_fev1dji,1579401979.0,"Unfortunately that's the tradeoff until the AKC bans tail docking. Most reputable breeders show because they are concerned with improving the breed. Most who do not are backyard breeders and just want to make fast money, so sure they will leave the tail on for you to get your money. Keep asking the show breeders if they know someone and you might find that unicorn who breeds for health but doesnt show."
