bipolar,ff2uvob,t3_ercpds,1579525091.0,"First and foremost, donâ€™t smoke weed again. Itâ€™s not doing you any favors.  Second, getting a correct psychiatric diagnosis isnâ€™t as straight forward as we would all like to think. Most doctors in practice come from different education and different life experiences which influence their clinical practice. Since psychiatric conditions canâ€™t be diagnosed using quantitative measures, there is more room for error. My advice is to quit smoking weed and start seeing a therapist. The therapist will get to know you much better than a doctor during a hospital visit and will have a much better idea as to how to help you. Try not to get hung up on the label of bipolar. It might stick, it might change, the label isnâ€™t what is important; getting better is."

intermittentfasting,feqzxi6,t3_eqcsvg,1579347939.0,"GI nurse here. I go over instructions with people on how to reduce acid at least 10 times a day. You probably have something called a hiatal hernia. It basically means your stomach is bulging through your diaphragm and pushing acid into your esophagus. The cells in your stomach can handle acid but the cells in your esophagus cannot, so youâ€™ve got to reduce acid in your diet. Coffee is highly acidic. I get not being able to completely cut it out but you need to reduce it. Other things that are bad for reflux are cooked tomato products, onions, garlic, alcohol and NSAIDs.  

Some things our practice recommends is drinking alkaline water (ph of 9 or higher), aloe vera juice, 1 tsp of apple cider vinegar with 8 oz of water 2-3 times a day and deglycyrrhizinated licorice. The other things we recommend are weight loss (good on you for starting that process), sleeping with your head elevated (you can put lifters under the two bed posts at the head of your bed), and waiting 2-3 hours after eating before laying down. Hope this helps!

Edit: we also recommend avoiding spicy and greasy foods and eating whole grains. Turkey bacon is a good alternative to pork. Much leaner."
