An alt-righter calling for violence is not the same as an oppressed group calling for violence. 

also I'd like to go back to this thing you said:

>""I'm not sure if you realise this, but every group doing these massive calls to violence thinks they're the ones ""morally in the right"".""

Do you think there is such a thing as morality? I think the answer is yes otherwise you wouldn't have answered with: ""That's really easy; the allied forces."" So obviously your conclusion should be that you *can* be on the right side of morality. Okay maybe you have a problem with people thinking they are? Fair enough, but surely a lot of the time some people know they are morally right and are also correct in that regard.

Also this is the second time you refer to killing people but I don't want to kill people. Of all the violent ways you can act that is the most extreme one. Protesting, blockades, destroying property are all violence too. Maybe you punch the occasional cop but you don't have to kill people on day one. 

What's your opinion on all the times there have been social revolutions by those who lived in an unjust society in history? Should they have debated their oppressors in the free marketplace of ideas perhaps?

Sure you could argue that nuclear is better and more reliable than wind/solar and we should build one anyway. But realistically we’ll never convince anyone to build one, or maintain one. Especially since the demand for wind and solar is only going rise as people become more climate conscious and the production of green electricity becomes cheaper and cheaper. 

I’m not against nuclear inherently at all. I just don’t see us building a new reactor any time soon.
