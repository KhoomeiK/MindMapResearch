offmychest,fcmqf08,t1_fcmab1x,1577787087.0,"I called and they said they may not have enough to make an investigation out of, but they'd start by checking for previous records. All I know for now unfortunately"
offmychest,fcleico,t1_fclea41,1577745942.0,"Thank you, it's not an easy thing to do"
offmychest,fcleems,t1_fcle1ox,1577745876.0,"He has passed. He was never in their lives though. Jail, and mental health issues."
offmychest,fcl653g,t1_fcl52e7,1577740636.0,You certainly sound like you've come out on top in the end. I appreciate your kind words more than you know!
offmychest,fcl5tw6,t1_fcl5ofb,1577740447.0,She was very lucky to have someone brave enough to stand up for her
offmychest,fcl314w,t1_fcl2g4a,1577738714.0,That's definitely how I choose to look at it! I would want my friends to do what they could to help me if I needed it. I need to be the friend I would want to have. As tough as it is.
offmychest,fcl2nvq,t1_fcl0bm1,1577738486.0,I appreciate your response. I hope I can get her the help I know she and her children deserve
offmychest,fcl2ipa,t1_fcl1zbo,1577738397.0,I'm so sorry you didn't have anyone you help get you out of there sooner. Definitely makes me feel like I could be helping change lives for the better
offmychest,fckzsr5,t1_fckxn8o,1577736716.0,You're absolutely right. I need to remember this
offmychest,fckzpcl,t1_fckysao,1577736656.0,Thank you. I really didn't know how much I needed to hear helpful words today
offmychest,fckxhl7,t1_fckufrb,1577735298.0,That's awful. I'm sorry you were essentially punished for doing the right thing. Family is a messy affair
offmychest,fckrcbo,t1_fckgcr1,1577731521.0,Trying like hell to. You can't help those who don't want it though ðŸ˜ž definitely been a hard lesson to learn.
offmychest,fckr565,t1_fckp9fx,1577731398.0,I actually just called and they said they may not have enough to investigate. That they start by looking at whether either of them have any prior reports made. I will definitely try to stay in contact with her and find out if anything else is going on. I will definitely call them again with anything else that comes up
offmychest,fckntg0,t1_fckll2e,1577729352.0,"This was so helpful to read. Thank you. I know it's what's needed, but it's always going to be in the back of my mind. I know if she found out she wouldn't forgive me. But that isn't really what matters at this point."
Frenchbulldogs,f8qdrdz,t3_e1ksrp,1574716102.0,"The thing to realize here, is that NO reputable breeder would sell their dogs to a pet store. Buying one from a place like that is always going to have risks. That said, you can get an unhealthy puppies from breeders as well. You just never know. Doing your research greatly lowers this risk though. In the end it is up to you to weigh the costs."
