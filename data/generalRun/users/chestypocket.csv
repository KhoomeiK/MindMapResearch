These movies are famous for their post-credits scenes and Disney owns and continues to distribute this content!

NetflixBestOf,fgrvqdg,t1_fgrhyeq,1581059389.0,"I resisted upgrading from my ancient Roku player for years because it still had the old version of Netflix that didn’t auto play previews. The newer device in the bedroom had the updated app, so I eventually just stopped watching Netflix on that TV. I’m glad to know I’m not the only one that felt this way, and I’m shocked it took this long to disable that feature, considering it seems more disruptive than useful to a large portion of their users."
TooAfraidToAsk,fgrvfox,t1_fgq8egh,1581059059.0,"I’ve struggled with isolation due health issues, and have learned to make the most of small interactions with people I don’t know or am not close to. Being kind to the person taking my order at McDonalds or the delivery guy or a neighbor can make a real difference in someone else’s day, and it makes me feel more positive as well. And making an effort to interact with people when you don’t necessarily have to (choosing the human instead of self checkout at the grocery store, ordering at the counter at Chipotle instead of using the app and grabbing your food from a shelf) gives you more opportunities to have these interactions.

Maybe those people won’t ever know your name, but if you can make them smile or hate their job just a little less, you’ve made a difference. And you’ve kept in the habit of talking to people, so maybe that will make it a little easier to build and maintain friendships when the opportunity arises."

therewasanattempt,fgqhrt4,t1_fgopxo8,1581024429.0,"I don’t know if this helps, but there’s been a great deal of effort put into trying to erase or revise this history so that it doesn’t seem so bad. There are a lot of arguments that the civil war wasn’t over slavery, that slaves were treated well and were happy, that freed slaves had plenty of opportunities to improve their lives, etc. Black history month is a way to shine a spotlight on the fact that this stuff *happened* and was really terrible, so it won’t just become a legend that your crazy paranoid uncle tells and nobody believes.

For an example of how much of this history is covered up, read about the [Tulsa Race Massacre](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tulsa_race_riot). I grew up 3 hours from Tulsa and have visited many times, I have grandparents that were living at the time it happened, took history classes every year I was in school, and my dad is a history buff. But somehow I only learned that this happened *last year*, from a podcast, at age 35. I never learned in school that lynching was a thing, and only recently learned how prevalent and open it was, after researching the topic myself. School only lightly touched on the civil rights movement and glossed over the entire period between the end of slavery and the civil rights movement. I truly had no idea how badly black people were treated or how open and violent racism was (and continues to be) until it became newsworthy again after the Michael Brown case. That’s a LOT of history to be completely oblivious about, and learning about these things made me so much more sympathetic to the struggles that my black friends and their families have experienced. Learning these things has, I think, made me a better person. But there are a lot of people that still want to pretend it didn’t happen, or want to believe that it’s all fixed now, so we need to continue to go out of our way to acknowledge this horrible part of history in our country so that we can all continue to improve."

It was the first big store in town where you could get most of your (non-food) shopping done all in one place, and they felt like a big important city. We shopped there a lot in the 80’s and early 90’s, but by then it was going downhill. I don’t think they ever made any improvements to the store from the time it opened until it closed down around 5 years ago. I still had warm and fuzzy memories of shopping there (and getting Little Caesars pizza back when it was really good), all of which were dashed when I tried going back as an adult.

news,fg09pyx,t1_fg08yj7,1580403233.0,"This is standard practice as a last resort for our electric company. The day the electricity will be cut off, they knock on your door and give you one last chance to pay. You don’t pay the person directly, they just watch you make the payment as usual through the website or phone service you normally use and then make a note of the confirmation number. If I’d ignored the person, I would have come home to disconnected electricity and a big disconnect fee that had to be paid before I could get it turned back on. It’s a kindness to have that one last chance before they just shut it down.

And it was my fault for not watching the mail. They’d tried other methods of contact, but I wasn’t keeping up with it, so that’s on me. Just warning others that if you’re going to ignore mail, don’t also ignore those other methods of contact and watch your bank statements to make sure autopay is working like it should. There are other reasons to keep up with bank statements as well-for example, a suddenly-higher-than-usual water bill may alert you to a water leak in a hidden area, so if you aren’t paying attention, you could be wasting money and ignoring a serious and damaging problem with your plumbing."

But a word of caution-I learned the hard way that the notification that autopay failed and you still owe money looks the same as a bill. I didn’t pay enough attention to my bills bank account, so didn’t notice that my electric bill didn’t autopay for three months (once the first one failed due to a bank error, they canceled autopay entirely). I finally found out one morning when I was rushing to get out the door for work and a person from the electric company showed up at my door saying they needed payment immediately or they’d shut off my electricity.

AskReddit,ffqvivy,t3_euoqp6,1580144594.0,"I still love weird pen colors, and I tend to choose an specific, unusual pen color for specific duties. At work, I use purple to differentiate my paperwork from everybody else’s, specifically because I receive paperwork from lazy coworkers that don’t fill everything in correctly, so I like it to be obvious what I’ve done and when I’ve done their job. This prevents questions later on due to screwups, because I don’t get blamed for someone else’s notes. I also have to hand my pen to customers frequently for signatures, and I almost always get the pen back when it’s an unusual color, because they recognize that it’s not their pen. I get very attached to my pens and hold grudges for a long time against people that steal pens.

In general, I’m a very organized person, and I rely on tidy and often color-coded filing systems. I even do this with my hobbies. I love color but have no talent for art, so it has to be practical instead."

I went in a worked 4 hours, packaging ready-to-eat foods and stocking shelves, and then suddenly and without warning vomited all over the prep table. It was only when I went up to the store manager with vomit dripping down the front of my shirt that they let me go home. The next day, naturally, I was back at work. Still sick, but not so sick that I was visibly ruining product.

It was such a culture shock a few years later when I got an office job with actual sick pay. Every other job I’d had would talk me out of staying home if I tried to call in sick, so I’d call in to this job sounding terrible, laying out all my symptoms and try to bargain with my boss, not realizing that the culture in that office was just to send an email saying “I’m sick, won’t be in”, and it would just be accepted with no questions asked."

I don’t get paid unless I complete the delivery and I am required to at least attempt it within the timeframe my contract stipulates.

I can tell you that roughly 80% of people don’t answer the phone when I call them. And probably 50% of those also have a voicemail box that’s either full or not set up, so I can’t leave a voicemail. It’s incredibly frustrating, and even more so because the addresses are taken verbally, so there are a lot of errors and I really need to confirm the house number before I drive across town (or across the state in some cases).

I usually send a text after attempting a call, and usually receive a call from them within a minute or two, so I know they’d just decided not to answer. Often it rings once and goes to voicemail, so I know they actually declined the call. I waste at least an hour a day making phone calls and sending texts, and I do not get paid for that time.

PSA-If you know you’re expecting a delivery, please answer unknown numbers or at least make sure your voicemail is working! It’ll make your driver’s life much easier. Some of the older drivers I work with don’t text, and sometimes their deliveries get delayed for days because the customer won’t answer the phone, doesn’t have a voicemail option, and the address printed on our order is incorrect."

MaliciousCompliance,feninqj,t1_femqoy5,1579285513.0,"This sort of thing drives me nuts. I used to work at a grocery store deli, and when I started, the store had only recently stopped donating the leftovers to the soup kitchen because of the liability in case someone claimed they got sick from the food. So instead, we would significantly mark down the leftovers an hour before close. Once people learned this, they started coming in an hour or two before markdown and either hid food packages around the store and returned them to the warmer just before markdown, or they would just stand by the warmer, stake their claim on the packages they wanted, and not allow any other shoppers to buy them. A few people would even come in 1/2 hour before markdown, demand that we make fresh food, and then slip it into the warmer so it would get discounted with the rest of the stuff.

Not surprisingly, after a few months of this, the store stopped allowing markdowns and everything went straight into the trash at the end of the night. The first couple weeks afterward was a steady stream of people crowding around the deli counter yelling at me as I dumped bin after bin of perfectly good food in the trash. Some of it was the stuff they had just demanded that I make fresh. If I hadn’t been such a timid little teenager at the time, I would have been thrilled to point out that they were the reason it was all going to waste."
