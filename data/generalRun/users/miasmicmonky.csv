The first time he said no, I don't have time, they said if you can come by tomorrow we will pay a sum of money and have continued to do so since. Not sure why they want it so bad other than the fact it is fairly rare in the US."

tifu,fb5vnfu,t3_ebgr9q,1576535210.0,I always clean my monitors with a damp microfiber cloth. I have had several where anything any harsher than alcohol as ruined them. Never apply hard pressure. Just lightly wipe away then dry with a spare cloth. Works perfect every time.
