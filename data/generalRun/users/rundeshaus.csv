Heads of states of parliamentary republics -- also called president, for the most part -- are usually impartial when in office and have no say on day-to-day politics. When was the last time you ever heard anything from the German president Frank-Walter Steinmeier, for example? I am German and all I ever hear from him is vague platitudes that few people can disagree with.

The Commission is nominated by Council and confirmed by the directly elected Parliament. Very similar to a parliamentary system like the UK. The European Parliament has the right to dismiss the Commission.

The Council is not elected separately from the members' national governments because then the Council wouldn't care what the government of their home country had to say, meaning the members would lose sovereignity.

europe,ffe8x4j,t1_ffcfq9y,1579839933.0,">3rd is to balance the consideration of small states,

The EU already has that. Germany, a country of 83 million people, has 96 seats in the European Parliament. Malta, which has 0.5 million people, has 6 seats. Smaller countries have way more MEPs per 100 000 people, like WAY more. Any EU law must pass the European Parliament (which is directly elected by EU citizens).

In the Council, every member has one vote, and every law has to pass both the European Parliament and the Council. The Council is made up of members' governments and any bill needs the approval of 55%, 72%, or 100% of members representing at least 65% of the population. In other words, the bottom 12 EU countries, which make up just 6% of the population, can block anything and everything. Not that they'd want to, EU bills are usually unaminous or very close to unaminous most of the time anyway, at least in the Council, not so much in the EP. This system ensures that small countries have a say but ALSO ensures that the small countries can't pass something that the bigger countries may not like, as there is a 65% of population requirment.

>It also forces the parties to fight for votes from swing states who don't really like either party.

It also disenfranchises people who vote for a popular candidate in their state. You vote for X? Pointless, he already got 60% of votes in your state, you might as have well stayed home, he would have received the same number of Electoral College votes from your state anyway. You voted for Y? Pointless, he only got 40% of the vote, meaning he lost your state, so you and the remaning 40% might as well have stayed home because he receives the same number of EC votes regardless -- 0. Roughly the same goes for Congressional elections -- in proportional systems, like they are used in Germany, for example, ensure that every vote has an impact on any election. Under proportional representation, as opposed to the first-past-the-post system the US uses, practically every voter hat least one, usually more, representative they actually voted for.

Germany diverted from the semi-presidential system it had in the Weimar Republic because the president's power was seen as too large and authoritarian, so a fully parliamentary system was established that ensures that no single person has that much power again.

While the Americans did pretty much draft the Japanese constitution (though the Japanese still had input, obviously), the main reason why they implemented a parliamentary system in Japan was because the Japanese Emperor couldn't be the de facto head of state otherwise. In presidential systems, the head of state and head of government are the same person, in parliamentary systems, they are separate titles held by separate people, head of state being the Emperor (in Japan's case) and head of government being the Prime Minster.

todayilearned,felp6tn,t1_feljvoo,1579227563.0,"There were two bills: one from the government and one from the opposition. The government's bill wanted opt-out, the opposition wanted opt-in, but required that government agencies ask people if they want to become organ donors every 10 years, e.g. when people renew their IDs (everyone has an ID here).

The head of the Green party (one of the parties that backed the second bill), argued that ""the state doesn't own your body, society doesn't own your body, you do."" I.e. the government has no place to presume consent and that people should choose for themselves. The government's bill failed, and the opposiiton bill was passed."

Selbst der Gesundheitsminister Spahn (CDU), der auf diese Widerspruchslösung pochte, räumte ein, dass so ein  Gesetz ""einen nicht geringen Eingriff des Staates in die Freiheit des Einzelnen bedeuten"" würde. Wenn es aber eine klare Alternative gibt, die auf diese Freiheitsbeschränkung verzichtet, warum nicht das als Gesetz verabschieden? Was der Bundestag dann ja auch getan hat; alle 10 Jahre soll nun direkt gefragt werden, ob man Spender werden will oder nicht. Keine Beschneidung der Freiheit, Zahl der Organspender wird steigen. Zwar nicht so viel wie bei einer Widerspruchgslösung, aber damit muss man leben, wenn man kein potentiell verfassungswidriges Gesetz verabschieden will."

Edit: also, electricity prices will be reduced by 60 euros per year per household in 2021, and the price will be reduced again every year from 2022 to 2025/26. This, among other things, is supposed to offset the price for the CO2 tax that will be implemented by 2021, whose price will rise annually.
