Normally you should complain about how common they are on Cdays. So much so, that your buddy has more than enough to trade them to you. Because that is not how shiny pokemon should be."

TheSilphRoad,fdq22hu,t1_fdq0hxh,1578651033.0,"Du hast ihn falsch verstanden. Er meint nicht, dass der cooldown timer für eine sinnvolle Aktion zurückgesetzt wird, sondern der timer, der dir nach 30 min einen Punkt abzieht. Denn sonst würdest du zwangsweise nach ner halben Stunde immer einen Punkt verlieren, weil du erst danach wieder Punkte für die Interaktionen erhältst. Wenn du aber vorher eine unproduktive Interaktion machst, hast du wieder 30 min bevor dir ein Punkt abgezogen wird. Du verlierst also keinen Punkt bevor du wieder produktive Interaktionen machen kannst."
