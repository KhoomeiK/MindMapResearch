tumblr,ff8mski,t1_ff8j3mq,1579686350.0,Dresses were only 'made for girls' after people realised they could make more money if they couldn't hand down clothes from boys to girls and vise versa. Babies always used to wear dresses regardless of gender because it was easier to change nappies.

Can you call the police when you have access to a phone?"
depression,fdw3ss5,t3_en7336,1578754775.0,I don't know where I first heard the idea but its that you've operated in this headspace for so long that you dont know how to operate outside of it.
infp,fdslrqk,t1_fdslghc,1578704842.0,Fair point. By now I've threatened to commit mass murder so often I think they've gotten used to it.

tumblr,fdggezj,t1_fdgeuvu,1578395643.0,"You can still make it more fun/interesting. I completely despised English and maths until I got into year six. My teacher made it a hell of a lot more fun than just throwing a textbook at us and telling us to answer questions. And for the lessons where we had to do something more dull we wouldn't care because we knew she would make the other lessons better for us so we got on with it.

It can have a great impact on a child. That was the only class in school where practically no-one acted out. Before that teacher came in, year six was known for acting up the most."
tumblr,fdbha01,t1_fdb4dbp,1578257402.0,"I think your teens complaining about not getting the food they like has less to do with the children themselves and more to do with how they were raised. 

Source: my mum raised me and my brother (now in his 20s) and the only time one of us complained about the food we were given, it went to the dog. The rule was and is, if you dont want to eat it fair enough but dont expect me to make you anything else."
