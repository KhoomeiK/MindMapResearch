If you're really stressed about it, okay, do it but try to limit how much you wear and how long you wear it and clean your skin after properly. If you wear Troiareuke A+ cushion foundation that's 99% skincare and 1% makeup, it will be so much better for your skin than regular foundation. However it's really recommended to not wear makeup but it's up to you."

niceguys,ffr06rw,t3_eur9wl,1580147569.0,Probably cause this guy is a known creep and they're working together to make sure he can't harass this waitress.

longhair,ffqg9ix,t3_eueyoh,1580133713.0,"You can do everything right, but your hair has an end lengh. It's genetics. It's not going to grow past that point. Instead of worrying about how to grow it more, look into maintaining the lengh you have now, keeping it alive, thick and healthy."
longhair,ffqfxhp,t1_ffozt9w,1580133428.0,Hair does stop growing once it reaches its end length.
