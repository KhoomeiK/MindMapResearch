Additionally, you can go to the provost or equivalent (this may or may not be be your ""academic dean"" - some places combine the two).  You could also see if there is anything HR can do. I know you're not an employee, but chances are it's something they ought to know anyway and it's their job to protect the University from legal issues."

AdviceAnimals,fcxxszw,t1_fcxcnh6,1578072012.0,"Yields make sense because the incoming traffic is required to yield to the traffic already on the highway.  While ideally nobody should stop on a ramp merge, sometimes (or, in Jersey, very often) traffic is so heavy that there is no other choice."

AdviceAnimals,fcxjlui,t1_fcx6cfb,1578064540.0,Eastern PA is where I encountered the stop signs and short onramps. Maybe you're further south than I was?
AdviceAnimals,fcxj8yp,t1_fcxa7gu,1578064292.0,"Yup, exactly.  I remember when I was first learning to drive, I was coming up to 22 somewhere in the Lehigh Valley...I want to say maybe somewhere in Allentown? There was this long-ass onramp that provided plenty of room to get up to speed, then right before it merged onto the highway there was a stop sign. Just...why??? I hope it's been fixed since then."
AdviceAnimals,fcwli8n,t3_ej9f49,1578028974.0,Love to. If only Pennsylvania would build onramps that are more than 100 feet long and didn't have stop signs at the end.

todayilearned,fcuvh6w,t1_fcusxut,1577989376.0,"Yes, you're right. It's been so long since I've watched it, but it wasn't their homeworld; just the planet where they met them again."
todayilearned,fcunnj6,t1_fcujao2,1577984858.0,"They did. SG-1 came to their planet through an introduction from another civilization.  Then they discovered that the address had been locked out due to previous O'Neill's warning note, and Daniel went into their archives and, figured out what was going on.  They escaped and IIRC buried the gate behind them."
todayilearned,fcumk2a,t1_fculg5e,1577984222.0,"Yes! They really just started dressing him in shirts that fit better.  I remember first noticing in season 1 where he's imprisoned in an underwater lab or something, and when he escapes his wet shirt clings to him and showed all that bulk that had been hiding under loose shirts."
AskReddit,fb3gufu,t1_fb3c695,1576472723.0,"That IS why they picked the term.  It has nothing to do with race or slavery, despite those who think it does and will try to convince you of it."
