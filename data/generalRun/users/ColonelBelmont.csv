todayilearned,ff5urm2,t1_ff5sxww,1579610960.0,"My urologist (my fucking *urologist*) tried prescribing me anti-anxiety meds because on the 3 occasions I saw him I seemed very anxious.  
  
The first time I met him he told me I might have bladder cancer.  
  
The second time I saw him he was running a tube up my dickhole to take a biopsy to see if I had any bladder cancer.  
  
The third time I saw him he was telling me the results about whether or not I had bladder cancer.  
  
On those 3 occasions,  I was pretty fucking anxious. He actually started our 3rd appointment with ""Before we get into all this test result business, I want to talk to you about your anxiety...."" Dude went on for a solid 5 minutes before I interrupted him with ""Each moment that you don't tell me my test results is directly compounding my anxiety. What were the results of biopsy?"" He says, ""Oh, yea it's negative. You're fine. Anyway, this is no way to live. Do it for yourself, and live a better life."" regarding getting me on anxiety drugs. I did not.  
  
Point is, dude literally was testing me for cancer at his own direction, and still wanted to tell me my problems were mainly psychological. For a dick doctor, he sure was a dick doctor."

You're only worth what someone's willing to pay you. If you can only ever get a job that will pay you the minimum required by law, making yourself more valuable is the only way that'll ever change."
worldnews,ff43nub,t1_ff3plcl,1579554833.0,"On the other hand, if you put in some extra effort in having a different job, career, and/or company that is more lucrative, you could very well earn more.  
  
But, it's all about priorities. If you like your current income/personal life balance that you have, then why mess with a good thing. If you wish you could earn more money but know it will never happen at your current place (or in your current field, profession, etc), you already know the thing you'd have to do."

67 miles in 3 days is seriously impressive to me. I know that probably doesn't seem crazy to hikers, but to me it might as well be 200 miles.  
  
Anyway, thanks for the analysis and for sharing your experience. This is really great information and perspective to read."

CCW,ff16vaw,t1_ff0a8q6,1579475826.0,"Sure I totally get that. I have a body type that allows for perfect concealing of a Glock 19. But I use a holster that is no more than it needs to be to be comfortable and secure. All the add-on stuff that people have on their holsters is more what I'm talking about. Claws, mag holders, whatever that thing is in OP's photo. Half these kydex holsters seem twice as wide as the gun itself. How does that wrap around a hip and feel comfortable while being concealed? It must or else they wouldn't be popular, but I guess it just doesn't happen to work for me. Oh well."
