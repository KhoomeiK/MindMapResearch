Absolutely insane stuff. I kind of miss oddball stuff like that."

Yeah, I'd likely end up disappointing him by trying *not* to ask too many Star Trek questions, and then annoying him with too many Reading Rainbow questions. Or just totally freeze up. And I'm not at all the sort to fanboy; I would just self sabotage the conversation by attempting not to annoy the man, and wind up doing exactly that."

Games,ffs591v,t1_ffroqwm,1580173461.0,"Knowing Google, there's a team of engineers headed by some walking ego who wants his name in in lights that is already planning to release their own version of Stadia, because perish the thought that they work on  ""someone else's"" project.

It'll have most of the same features of the current product, but some of the better ones will be mysteriously missing, or implemented in worse or more awkward forms, all the better to split it amongst other pieces of equipment no one will buy.

Yes, I'm bitter about the impending death of Google Play music and their completely asinine insistence on destroying Hangouts and replacing  it with something inferior instead of telling their engineers to simply maintain and update the product they already have."

atheism,ffs4l5b,t1_ffs35tu,1580172989.0,"I've always wanted to meet LeVar Burton. I watched the very first broadcast of Reading Rainbow in, I think, 1983. I still remember it vividly! 

You have no idea how stoked I was, still as a kid in 1987 or so when he showed up in Star Trek: The Next Generation. And then he even did an episode of Reading Rainbow on the set of TNG!

Overall, he just seems like a such a caring and good natured soul. Certainly one that is involved in a great many of my earlier happy memories pertaining to Media."
atheism,ffs1i3h,t1_ffs14ln,1580170847.0,"I'm sure he'd be quite humble and dislike being placed on any sort of pedestal. But he so deserves a bit of veneration, the better that his example not be forgotten."
atheism,ffrzu3z,t1_ffrz2tu,1580169702.0,"Great examples both! My personal take is that Mr. Rogers was the embodiment of what we should all strive to be. Mr. Ross and Mr. Irwin were wonderful as well, just in a different way than Fred was."
