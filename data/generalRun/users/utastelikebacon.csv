I think it might fall under the scope of what you’re talking about in this post, because you’re right there are no “alternatives”.

NoStupidQuestions,fdwl0wn,t3_en7lo0,1578759819.0,"This is a really good question, one that I’ve been thinking about quite a bit lately.
So my guess is a couple of things:
1. As others have pointed out , thoughts happen pretty quickly, much faster than when you have sharethem(that includes speaking/writing them), so you have the opportunity to cycle through many of them before you land on a good one, whereas when you write one down it, you’re invested in that one, good or bad as it is.
2. Your thoughts in the brain are riddled with biases, many of which are biased themselves. The “filter” for bias is probably when it becomes shared, ie it’s said or written.
3. You don’t have to research/provide evidence for the original stuff that you think of, but you do when it becomes shared ie said or written. Researching is a incredibly time consuming process. I’d say it’s one of the most time consuming processes for anyone well informed. Followed secondly by organization. When you don’t have to have evidence for your ideas(because you can just “believe” in them) you are freed up ALOT to delve in much more thoughts(point 1 mentioned earlier.         
TLDR: your Unshared ideas are so much better than your shared ideas because of 1.speed of thought, 2.lack of biases, 3.less need to have evidence(cause they’re personal)."

worldnews,fdcdfly,t1_fdbs63q,1578272200.0,"I attribute boomer almost exclusively to the Republican Party. Here in FL, where (retired) boomers are a majority in the voting age population, most of this state votes republican (previous governor was (r) rick Scott, and now current is trump lap dog (r)Ron desantis. You may remember him from his [hilarious campaign ad](https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/ron-desantis-trump-ad-704926/) back in 2018. 

Anyway Baby boomers are overwhelmingly Republican voters, and they vote like it. They’re also majority viewership of the television based show, Fox News , so it makes sense.

Dark humor is fucking a privilege. It’s one  that we’re allowed to have because we all agree this sub is dedicated towards a higher purpose, humor. 
Unfortunately recent political groups have begun blurring the line between this delicate balance of intent and making it harder for everyone(especially those outside the sub)to distinguish between us that are here for the humor, and those that are here just to vent their genuine distasteful beliefs. Don’t make r/darkhumor one of those things you have to say, “this is why we cant have nice things”"

science,fd6fy6j,t3_ejwjcf,1578190399.0,"I honestly think the surge in conservative right over the past few decades leads to an spiral effect, which inevitably leads to more and more conservative ideology through necessity. You get used to people only caring about there own well being and saying “not my problem”, and within that context, eventually you get tired of trying to spread the wealth(often your wealth) with liberalism and ideas of communal prosperity when progress is it’s always being thwarted due to conservative greed and self centered thinking. In the end up being more conservative yourself out of necessity for survival .  At least that’s how I’ve felt these past few years about social issues."

FunnyandSad,fd4eyas,t1_fd10gbb,1578166931.0,"Lol I know I have depression, but not on anything at the moment. Always feared it would fundamentally change who I was and diminish my drive for entrepreneurship, which is a big part of who I am.        
My thinking goes something like this, part of what motivates me to do as much work as I need to do to start a business is my desire for change, which is spurred by my distaste for being poor, which is grounded in the way the world works and how everything in my country requires $. I fear if I take anti-depressants I’ll become complacent and lose interest in work. And for the poor and the entrepreneurial, life is literally nothing but work.  With hopefully a bit of success somewhere after a while. Here’s to hoping thats the right kind of thinking."

Can’t the public just mount a lawsuit and drag him into the dirt?"
