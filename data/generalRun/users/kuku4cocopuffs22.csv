Edit (adding this): 
But I've seen kids who pick on the weak because they see their parents doing the same thing, so they grow up in a household thinking that it's normal to treat others like trash. And then there are kids that are praised by their parents no matter what they do, so they aren't taught the difference of good actions or bad actions or they tend not to care what society thinks of them because they know that their parents will do what ever they can to protect their kids from being punished. This is why I believe there are teens who find it fun beating up on homeless people.  

Then there are their society's views on animal abuse, as in either the normalization or the laxity of laws regarding animal abuse. Like animal abuse is so common in Asian countries, that they have no problem posting up vids of them doing it (Google animal abuse in Japan, for some really messed up stories). While in certain middle eastern counties ( I think Turkey being one example) animals are treated well and feed by the community. 

And then there are stories of YouTube channels where people will abuse animals just so they can make vids of them 'Rescuing' them so they can get views and/or praise from viewers."

Based on what the spokesman said, I think she got invited because she works at the White House, which she only got the position of because  her dad gave it to her. So I would agree that Trump being her dad got her that invite.
