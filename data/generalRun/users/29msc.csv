offmychest,ffcx5wh,t1_ffcjuvi,1579809119.0,">Sometimes they just send a generic rejection letter.

If you're lucky enough to get a rejection letter at all. Applying for jobs last year I sent in maybe 30 applications. None of them were through indeed or another search engine, all were either through the company's own website or via email. I got generic rejections from maybe 10, and only 1 personalized rejection. The rest, just nothing."

You have no true cycle at on *any* pill. You’re basically keeping your body in the luteal phase. The luteal phase is the part of your cycle (the third week in a standard 28 day cycle) just after ovulation where e&p are high (in order to suppress additional ovulation) and your body is like maybe we’re pregnant? so is waiting for either (1) a growing embryo to trigger the additional pregnancy hormones or (2)  the e&p start to wear off, triggering menstruation. 

If you’re on a cyclical pill where you take a week off, you’re basically going from luteal-menstruation-luteal on repeat. If you take your pills continuously, you’re just always in the same state of high e&p, like an eternal luteal phase. In that case, you never deplete the high levels of e&p like you would on the off week, so you’re theoretically more protected in the case of missing the pill. 

Buuut if you’re at the point where you’re taking it continuously, you might as well get an IUD. I agree with you, best decision I ever made. 

To note: some health professionals say that if you’re on a pill, you shouldn’t go more than 3 months without a break, which is why even the long-term continuous pill packs are for 3 months. However there’s no evidence that suggests that this is necessary, or skipping a period for many months at a time is harmful. We are built to go 9 months without it anyway!"
birthcontrol,ff9e47u,t1_ff9bndt,1579711035.0,"It doesn’t. The only reason they make BCP in 4 week cycles is to mimic natural rhythms so you can bleed every month. In a natural cycle, there are 4 key hormones that fluctuate in conjunction with each other and direct your body to do whatever it’s gotta do. 2 prepare for / trigger ovulation so are higher in the first weeks of your natural cycle, and 2 (estrogen and progestin) are higher after ovulation, and stay high in pregnancy. These latter 2 are what make up BCP— so the high levels of e&p are what essentially tricks your body into thinking it’s pregnant. High levels of e&p suppress the ovulation hormones, so you never ovulate. It’s not that your body knows what week is what, it’s that the further along you are in your BCP pack. the more of a buildup of e&p you have in your body. That’s why it’s riskier to miss pills in the first week— because you’ve already depleted the buildup from the last cycle during the placebo week, so now you need to start building it up again ASAP to prevent the ovulation hormones from kicking in.By the third week however, if you miss just one, you likely have enough of a buildup that you’d be ok."
birthcontrol,ff979t5,t1_ff96sq6,1579706497.0,"Of course, I know having to take Plan B is incredibly stressful. Definitely use this as an opportunity to look into better, more reliable forms of contraception!"
birthcontrol,ff96ats,t3_escrq3,1579705859.0,See my comment on your other post!
birthcontrol,ff964qt,t3_escwwg,1579705745.0,"Most likely, you will have some spotting within the days after. Your next cycle will likely be irregular, since the Plan B is essentially postponing/restarting your cycle. But after that, you should be back to normal.

The good news: Plan B is really just a mega-dose of the normal BCP, so it doesn't have some sort of permanent effect on your cycle or fertility like some myths say.

Edit: just saw your other post. Yes, those 7 days were your period. You may be slightly off your normal timeline for one more cycle, but most likely you'll be normal from here on out."
birthcontrol,ff95vo0,t3_esd2kk,1579705574.0,"Sadly, not really. You just have to let the hormones pass. Typically your next period will be delayed, as your cycle has been essentially postponed/restarted, but after that you should go back to normal. There are of course other things, like stress, exercise, and diet, that can *also* affect your cycle, so just try to stay healthy to get you back on track as soon as possible.
