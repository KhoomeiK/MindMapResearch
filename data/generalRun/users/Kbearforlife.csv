personalfinance,ff20shw,t1_ff1v6j7,1579490755.0,"Okay I am *very* glad someone else pointed this out. I almost worked for one of these agencies. AVOID THEM AT ALL COST!!!!! I say that as a fellow Redditor, not just someone who had a bad experience.


I was in the process of getting hired at one of these front companies. The whole process felt like a sham to begin with. ""Make 35k/yr no experience needed."" While normally I do my research before and understand that if something sounds too good to be true it probably is, I couldn't find a single thing off. The agency had a very professional website. Their workers looked rather competent, and even spoke very effectively on the phone.


So I go to the interview. First red flag, the H.R. email sent to my spam folder. Huh. Odd, but not immediately a disqualifier. Gmail can absolutely be finicky at times. I show up. I basically get told that I am the best applicant they've seen yada yada. Tons of other people in the room. Oh we can't wait to tell you about this amazing opportunity!

So I got real with the ""Owner."" He was around the same age as me and I smelled rat from the start. I look him dead in the eyes and ask him what do you guys ACTUALLY do?

He goes on this shpeel about Alternate Energy. I tell him to drop the sales act and just tell me what the position is. Door to door blanket sales. The worst part? 

They ask to see your Electric bill so they can get a certain number off of it. They then, for whatever reason, have a ""verbal agreement"" that you are willing to switch over. The companies start charging you less than your bill is upfront, so you generally look like your getting a good deal. The fine print of this, is year long contracts with increasing rates, usually towards the end of the cycle. 


While this seems highly illegal, unethical and downright wrong, there are companies in the Midwest that *absolutely* are doing this and it is an absolute shame. The owners usually cash out and move to another area. They change their names slightly and *always* show their teams on vacations at random places. 


It's a big fucking sham.

Edit - I see a few others are posting their horror stories below. FUCK these people, I wish I had better words. They are scammers all the way who prey on old folks more often those who would just pay it and not fight back. Also, check the stories out in r/AntiMLM when they come up time to time for further info about these shills."
Futurology,fevxfjy,t1_fevqez1,1579402718.0,Thanks for the response. I wish I had something more constructive to say. I think your points are very valid. I want to piggyback on your mention of the Media being a harsh pseudo reality of disinformation. I can't even watch the news anymore - and when I do I become an instant cynic. Glad to see I may not be the only one that feels this way.
Futurology,fevmbd1,t1_fev5ezt,1579399045.0,"This is a brilliant read. I appreciate your insight and analogies. But that leads me to a question that I think we all have in our minds; Haven't we already passed this tipping point up?


What can the typical American do about a mass corporation? Our voting systems have been proven to be quite ineffective, and yes I am registered to vote myself and do. What I do not think, is that I have any sort of impact on the grand scheme. Sure, casting a ballot is one thing, but unironically finding that usually those with large Capital somehow manage to come out on top is disheartening to say the least.

It was just so unexpected. And at the same time my mind went...well if there is an exploit going around specifically one where you can spawn a one shot pistol somehow, you can see how gamebreaking that could potentially be. I was sort of worried at first - like here we go then hackers finally squeezed there way into one of my favorite releases of the last few years. Turns out....just devs having a good ol' time. <3"

IAmA,fcwpa1e,t1_fcw1opd,1578032426.0,"Wow. I feel this on a spiritual level. Since you decided to talk about your interaction with Latinos - I figure I should share mine.


In 2013 I worked in a Rehabilitation Center (drugs/alcohol.) The place was owned and operated by Latinos. Out of 30ish employees I was the only ""white"" guy. Polish to be exact..

I initially was daunted. I had a hard time understanding a lot of the clients strictly because I did not speak any Espanol. By my third or fourth week there - I had this crazy idea to possibly just start learning their language. It was definitely rough - and whatever source proved that learning different languages as you get older is definitely difficult. I found that speaking the basics - and *trying daily* it not only became constructive for myself - but constructive for the *clients.* A year or so in - I could speak Espanol in what I like to call broken sentences - whereas I could say something and they would understand it. I also found that listening to conversations and body cues also entirely helped me out. It was a gain-gain situation, leading a lot of the folks calling me La Pollocko to my actual name. It was at this specific moment that I realized I made a great judgement call by actively trying to learn it. Eventually, the conversations in the other rooms and in the halls became less of indestinctive chatter and more or less automatically translated in my head. I worked there for about 3 years before I went back to Uni and now I think it it safe to say that I can speak *a lot* of Spanish. I still need a lot of work to do within it - and the dialect differs greatly between certain ethnic groups, but this was entirely invaluable to me. I came from working in Roofing and not being able to understand a lick of it. Failed it in High School - but something about seeing peoples faces light up as I attempted to speak it boosted my ego tremendously. On top of this - I got to learn some very very very good dishes.

Okay in all fairness the DSM variants are absolute monsters. I had a group of friends who all bought this specific type of motor I think it was Talons, Plymouth and Eclipse, all GST or GSX, and those fuckers pushed so many horses with such little investment. I will never forget screaming around in those cars - definitely hits a soft spot for me. Most of those cars blew up because idiot friends decided to push like 22-30lbs of boost through stock manifolds and whatnot...but those cars are *really* fast and *very* fun to drive."

IAmA,fc26dsp,t3_efpfqf,1577342460.0,"How do you feel about the new Polaris RZR Turbos? I used to work in a Motorcycle Shop - and found them to be absolutely terrifying. I also found that the frames were really, really weak in comparison to their 4x4 XLT Models. I know that they decrease the weight overall - but I still can't wrap my head around how going 60mph in one of those doesn't feel like a deathtrap.


edit - oof - I meant RZR not Ranger! I think you picked up on that though lol"
