But what good of a life will a kid have when the parents don't even want it? I personally would say; only abort if it's a medical threat.

Delete all the barriers around the edges that I marked in red, and place them on the spots that I marked blue and it'll solve it. The reason it happens like this is because the game thinks it has exited the habitat area. Even though it's unable to walk out of this area it'll happen. With habitats like this always mark the outer perimeter instead of how you did it here.
