TumblrInAction,fefuoh5,t1_feel10d,1579065772.0,"Bubby, I never said we shouldn't have a military, obviously we need a military, but our spending is way too lopsided in its favor, and we're involved in way too many interventions, that we really don't have good reasons to stay in right now. It's just keeping troops there forever trying to be the so called ""world police"", when we have so many problems at home. We have things like N.A.T.O. for a reason, spending over half the federal budget on the military is just not justifiable when there just isn't a threat to mainland u.s. 

If we wanted to be the true and moral ""world police"" we wouldn't ally with the Sauds, completely ignoring their spreading of Wahhabism all across Asia, and somehow caring about Islamic extremism, when it's done by the religious sects the Sauds dislike. 

So much of the justification for war has been because of how horrible and repressive the dictatorships in the middle-east are, when were the ones to overthrow Iran first in 1953, as part of a long power struggle with the U.S.S.R. In case you haven't noticed the cold war is over, and so much of our shit is spent on overthrowing leaders which while it's good their dead, only creates more chaos than before. I'm not at all saying we should be completely isolated,  but we don't need to keep throwing shit at bumfuck backwater countries when we know another year of military intervention won't stabilize the situation. I know that was an incoherent rant, but I just can't believe you thought I was arguing for fully removing the military. I just think we should maybe leave Afghanistan before we look at Iran, and maybe we don't need to defend Saudi Arabias oil pipelines when they are a barbaric theocracy and we have the resources to move away from depending on them for oil."

I'm only just now starting to get comfortable around women, and get to know people, even then literally fucking everyone treats me like ""little buddy, so cute what a child"" when I work half the day with my tradeschool program, and, do a lot on my own. Still your family was definitely abusive, and your mom sounds like an evil person for treating you that way, I'm sorry you had to go through that. Don't worry about being a virgin man, just try to talk to people more be it men or women.  The more comfortable you get around people in general the easier it gets. While you obviously know plenty women can be narcissistic, and self-centered bitches, I've seen plenty myself remember that plenty still definitely aren't and you just need to find them. If you actively search out the quiet types, and show confidence above all you'll eventually find someone. Remember that personality is over body, and you'll be much happier in the long run with people you can talk to rather than those who'll look good for 30 years tops. You got plenty of time man. Start off getting better socializing in general, then start joining clubs or groups with your interests, then look for people in those clubs you can be friends with, then either try to go out with them or, become such good friends you could ask them if they know anyone good for you. See how it goes from there, good luck man."

He didn't take us outta the middle-east, he continued jacking off the Saudi Monarchy, and he only increased wealth inequality, along with bringing more jobs oversees than Obama did.

Just recently he killed the Iranian general, and act of war when there was no plausible threat to the u.s. mainland, and before that we broke the nuclear deal with them, then placed sanctions on medicine entering Iran which is illegal under international law. That's all I can think of right now anyway. But yeah I don't judge you as a person, for liking him, you've just haven't seen the right information."

Since when? It's part of the social contract that people if needed should defend their society. It's like paying taxes. If you enjoy the benefits of society you should have to defend it when needed.
