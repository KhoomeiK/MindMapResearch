ExpectationVsReality,ff1wdwn,t1_ff1qsbx,1579487690.0,I cook often enough but only buy spices as I need them. I don't think I have cumin or paprika in my cabinet.
AskWomen,fey98h8,t1_fexul4n,1579442404.0,"Haha, I meant I am able to understand when friends aren't available. Didn't even remotely say I'm as experienced as an actual mom. Though I have cared for infants, I know it's very different than being a mom every second of the day. 
Side note: I would have loved to have been a mom. It's what I wanted to be when I ""grew up"", just didn't happen for me. Thanks for that reminder."

AskWomen,feiegcn,t1_fehls6d,1579136608.0,"I'f you're already having trouble with a new guy making time for you, do yourself a favor and just cut him out of your life. He's already shown you he's not able to be the partner you want."
DecidingToBeBetter,fei074v,t1_feh6qq3,1579127447.0,"I have a similar ex- friend who keeps trying to become friends again. Even argued with me one time when I wasn't into it. I don't think she actually misses my company, she just wants to keep tabs on me and know my business. Also, she's a coke whore."
aww,fecckyl,t1_feb8m8t,1578970775.0,"Sometimes women don't have symptoms, maybe she was one of them. Getting chlamydia just means she had sex with someone, its not her fault. Don't shame people for having sex."
solotravel,fecagm0,t1_fec5lx6,1578969574.0,Agree. I enjoy scrolling to relax. You don't have to be *doing something* the entire time you're traveling.
AskWomen,fe2n40u,t1_fe2kne1,1578840788.0,"This is what it means. ""Don't talk shit about me"". She thinks you're an ok person  just doesn't want the romantic part anymore."

aww,fds2sw8,t1_fdrsnvi,1578693507.0,My cat (as a kitten) used to suck on my bun at night. It drove me crazy trying to cover it since I can't sleep with my face covered.
DecidingToBeBetter,fds2il6,t1_fds2f87,1578693332.0,You can also invite friends on walks to combine socializing.
DecidingToBeBetter,fds2f87,t3_emu33t,1578693275.0,"Yeah, changing your eating habits will be more impactful than going to the gym (and eating the same way). Can you walk to work or school? Fitting in walks instead of an hour of gym time (which is never an hour when you factor in travel to/ from and walking in, etc) would probably be more beneficial and help with your time crunch."

AskWomen,fdiwrnr,t1_fdiupv4,1578452801.0,I've always enjoyed having alone time so maybe it's like being a night or morning person? Nobody really knows why (usually) but some people like alone time and some people don't. What im trying to say is don't be too hard on yourself if you don't become a person that enjoys being alone.

MadeMeSmile,fdftm4d,t1_fde5xnc,1578369895.0,"Ugh, I no longer find this cute. I know i don't look under 30, you know I don't look under 30 so we both know I am definitely not under 21. It's annoying, not a compliment (when it's not a policy to card everyone)."
CatSlaps,fdfp8mh,t1_fdek0zu,1578366928.0,That first one was perfect.
angrycatpics,fdbzyr5,t3_ekfbkj,1578264528.0,Looks like my late honey. Give him some extra pets from me!
solotravel,fdbzlyd,t1_fd9zhja,1578264354.0,The only time I wish someone were with me when I was in barcelona was when i couldn't decide whether or where to eat. Got over that in 20 min when I found a place I liked!
solotravel,fdbz24k,t1_fd9rvgi,1578264065.0,Have to pee again? Sure! Not hungry? No need to eat on someone else's schedule! Can't sleep and want to get up and explore? Nobody to wait for!

Catswithjobs,fc91yxk,t1_fc7ki0x,1577545731.0,It's possible I was a little meaner. He doesn't usually listen to my lounging suggestions.
Catswithjobs,fc7fmi3,t3_egbz2o,1577505974.0,"Weil, now I feel bad for yelling at my cat when he was ""helping"". I told him to ""go sit over there"" and he did with such a pout."
WhatsWrongWithYourDog,faspgfo,t1_faor4lq,1576329861.0,"Agree. I said ""what the fuck is this thing"" and had to scroll back up to see it was a dog."
