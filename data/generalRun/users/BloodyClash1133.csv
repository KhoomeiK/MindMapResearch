depression,fengs6b,t1_feng03p,1579284356.0,Oh yes. It is hard. But we depressos are fighters - we don't feel like and maybe don't know but we are. But if you feel uncomfortable to talk about stuff you don't want to then others may notice that. What you can do is force yourself less but also don't stay away from others too much. You are a likeable person (at least from what i can read) so sooner or later people will come to you
depression,fenf1qx,t3_epym4o,1579283297.0,:D 74 people before me already did but i also want to say HAPPYYYYY BIRTHDAAAAAAAAAY
depression,fenexde,t3_eq34i4,1579283222.0,"I hope you know that it's not YOUR fault and that not YOU were the one being selfish. This sounds like your parent had problems for a longer period but still it was selfish of your mother to leave you hanging like that.   
It's just that the timing of that explosion between them had a very bad timing and you were just in the hitting spot.  
The other side: whatevery other people say about things you wear will be forgotten soon (if there will be anything negative at all) and you have every right to express yourself. Many people at that age just don't understand that not everyone can live in the strict society conventions but you can't judge them for that and you shouldn't take it personal. It's just their small world.  
You would hate yourself more if you just live up to their expectations and as soon as you are older you will be admired for your strong will.  
:D it's hard for me to remember how it was to be a teenager (it feels like it's a 1000 years away) but i know it's not always easy but try to think how all this will vanish 5 years from now.  
Also don't judge your mother too much - maybe she was hurt in that moment. Maybe something between her and your father stole all her attention for you....  
To finish it: BETTER BE A TUXEDO GIRL THAN BEING A DUMB BARBIE !"
depression,fend3mh,t3_eq35om,1579282112.0,"Talking about suicide for most of us is the loudest cry for help we are able to do and denying help you offer is normal. He needs more pratical help than theoretical. I mean he needs help that doesn't look like help but something coming from the heart.  
Accepting help in that situation makes him weaker as he already is. At least that is what he may think. Being there is the best a friend can do. It may be hard to stick with him sometimes but it's not intentionally.  
So deep in pain it's super hard to be rational and that's one reason why many of us lose their friends. ""Normal"" people just don't understand that.  
Maybe somtimes you could force him to go out so he won't drown too much into that ocean of self hatred. But when he says he wants no one BUT YOU then this is actually a good sign. It means he trusts you and he is not lost.  
Best help is help that doesn't look like help. Hope you can get him back on track"
depression,fenc4zr,t3_eq2r8s,1579281522.0,I think that's a wall you built to protect you but keeping this wall up is very exhausting and cold. You should at least try to lower it a bit. I know that the world is mean and merciless but building a fortress of cold is not the way to go. Did you ever think about getting a pet ?
depression,fenbvrz,t1_fenba5m,1579281366.0,Yes. Most human - unlike animals - always expect something or have thing in mind. I have a cat and that's all i need. :D she is as lazy and grumpy as i am
depression,fenbo7m,t1_fenafiu,1579281238.0,You are. Judging by what and how you wrote it would for many of us be fun hanging around with you
depression,fenbkcb,t3_eq2rpo,1579281172.0,"It's not a question of accepting or not but a question of patience. Someone who is NOT intelligent would have written all that different - so that is not correct. Some people are late bloomers and that's fully ok. In germany we say ""there's a lid for every pot"" and you will find yours - just don't push it.  
:D and the crafting stuff; same here. I love woodworking but i can't even saw a straight line without expensive machines. But building stuff to organize things or like in my case i started making a remote controll holder and some stands for my monitors ... that looks awfull but i call it art and it fits my needs perfectly.  
Just take your time (in crafting and in love things) and it will come to you. The time to accept being alone should only come at a higher age (i'm 44 now and even imagining having a relationship is pure horror for me)"
depression,fenaovp,t3_eq2rzs,1579280627.0,"I only can guess that it's super hard to be in the depression spiral while you have to focus on exams. But the problem is the more you think you will fail the less you can focus on it. Maybe it would help telling yourself you will do the best you can and show the world that you can do it. Your brain it trying to trick you into failure so don't let it win (i know it's easier said than done but you have something to work for).And that there are people who have worse stuff doesn't make yours better. Maybe you can go outside a bit and try to get your head free then try study a bit and when you feel you can't do anymore get some more fresh air. Just let the studying be your distraction from the downward spiral and tell yourself you can care about that after the exams.

And no matter how it will go: you are definately NOT worthless - that's just your brain lying to you  
I will press the thumbs for your exam and wish you all the best"
depression,fen9sz4,t3_eq2y22,1579280080.0,:) sure you are super excited and hope he (or she) will make you super happy. It's a win / win for both of you. He needs someone he can love and you need someone who loves you without any conditions. Wish you all the best
depression,fegqa1q,t1_fegcqbl,1579099997.0,And they look suspicious :D
depression,fegq7nv,t3_ep0uj5,1579099950.0,I got all my teeth pulled out when i was about 36 and now artificial (the cheapest kind) and they feel like my own and even better i can eat everything with them (which i couldn't before). But right: your dentist should be more sensitive. Just wanna say that losing teeth is not the end of the world and having not perfect teeth doens't make you a worse person
depression,fegpdm0,t1_feg5dp0,1579099372.0,Like that kind what people get when they suffocate ?
depression,fegp9pz,t1_feg6jfc,1579099298.0,"Migraine is even much worse than ""just"" the headache :( sorry for you"
depression,fegp6xf,t1_fefy67n,1579099244.0,Same here. It's this kind of headache that feels like needles behind my eyes
depression,fegp3qi,t3_eoxun3,1579099182.0,I think we also built a wall of self pitty (i don't mean this negative in any way) and imgagining to live without the depression we don't know what to do. That's another trick of depression to keep us in. Our walls are so thick that we are afraid to not need them anymore because we don't trust the world anymore
depression,fcuz62p,t3_ej069u,1577991424.0,"You're no piece of shit or anything like that - you are just one of us. A depressed living who needs at least a bit of warmth. 

I really hope things will turn out better along this year so...happy new year (and i mean it)"
depression,fcrpwg7,t3_eihb2v,1577905031.0,Same here. I so often want to give my life to someone who is worth living. So many good people die and i still stay alive
depression,fbeasix,t3_ecw8xl,1576782011.0,":D to me christmas only are two day with non opened shops. But you are absolutely completely right:  If they would care we won't be alone.

Wish you all the best over christmas and will light a candle for you !"
