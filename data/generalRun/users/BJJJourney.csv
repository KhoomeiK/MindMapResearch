trashy,ffwzlmt,t1_ffwiqjh,1580314559.0,Wouldn’t be surprised if this was an undiagnosed case of autism. Her mannerisms are not what someone would be doing in a normal social situation.
wallstreetbets,ffwxmvl,t1_ffwxfeh,1580313325.0,Hurry go buy puts on DIS.
wallstreetbets,ffwttzs,t1_ffwstj8,1580310853.0,"When all you do is buy FDs any movement either way, nor matter how small or big, can absolutely trash your portfolio. Regular investors are buying shares or options that make sense."
wallstreetbets,ffvx1pv,t1_ffvwd08,1580275893.0,Yup gotta isolate 1 person. Having multiple people in the hand makes your chances of winning go down. Lots of dumb shits call small bets down no matter their hand.

wallstreetbets,ffqq5h1,t1_ffqovaj,1580141049.0,Yeah might as well hold them at this point lol.
wallstreetbets,ffqpsix,t1_ffqpfxe,1580140807.0,Why not just bag hold at that point?
todayilearned,ffo64k9,t1_ffnt5kg,1580074483.0,"I work in management for a customer service center. I know what metrics we pull and develop KPIs for them. We also do a lot of quality checking on the employees through audits, customer surveys, and training. I know exactly what everyone up to our CEO looks at and why they look at it (this is a global company that operates in just about every market). Our QA department is primary tasked with audits and follows up with management to bring employees back up to par. HR typically isn't tasked with any sort of quality management for any company unless that HR department has created creep on scope, which means management isn't running properly (need new PMs or HR needs to get their responsibilities in check by the C suite)."
todayilearned,ffnm830,t1_ffndb0j,1580067759.0,"Yeah, that’s illegal especially if it is a protected class. FMLA is there for a reason. Stop spewing bullshit that isn’t true."
wallstreetbets,ffnb8gk,t1_ffn9i7b,1580063874.0,DIS about to get around $155-$160 before earnings.
todayilearned,ffnaed6,t1_ffn6v19,1580063669.0,"Every company is different. In customer service it is very easy. Call and email audits. Customer surveys. Employee reported quality problems (you would be surprised how many of your coworkers are snitching on you). Continued training on materials and new processes.

From a project management perspective it is very easy to see the ones producing shitty work or not keeping up. Only way shitty employees get away with it here is if the PM absolutely sucks at their job."
todayilearned,ffmtpwf,t1_ffmswy3,1580058771.0,They need to go talk to HR then. With a doctors note you can get away with a lot of shit.
todayilearned,ffmrxv6,t1_ffmhvs0,1580058303.0,Why the fuck are people showing up with the flu?
todayilearned,ffmqfq0,t1_ffmio1x,1580057888.0,Most large companies that deal with customers are going to have a QA department. Just because you don’t work with them doesn’t mean they are not there.
todayilearned,ffmpiys,t1_ffmd2hi,1580057573.0,Yeah none of you work in management. There are easy and validated ways to check quality of work.

politics,ffmi7mt,t1_ffm5w3f,1580055041.0,They already do. There are algorithms that literally trade the news headlines.

PrequelMemes,ffg5ypm,t1_fff9gpw,1579899173.0,Years ago a bunch of newer AAA Xbox and PS4 games could be had for $20 due to black Friday and holiday deals. You could buy them and then return them for a full $60 credit at Walmart.
mildlyinfuriating,fffuc1a,t1_fffid0p,1579891970.0,I know this stuff requires permits. My point is that no one gives a shit about permits unless the buyer checks on them and even then they can still buy the house without them.
mildlyinfuriating,ffffek8,t1_fff1kzy,1579882774.0,You don’t need a permit to make modifications. Permits only become necessary when you want to sell a house and even then they are only applicable if the buyer checks on them. This was just a lazy remodel.
MMA,ffd1xtm,t1_ffcigkh,1579811809.0,They aren’t dives. Promoters want specific guys to get a win so they pair him with this essentially untrained guy to get a win. There is always a chance that the can wins but it is so low that if he does win the guy he beat likely isn’t going to get another shot in that promo.
MMA,ffd13hc,t1_ffcalns,1579811337.0,There are lots of regional guys that will take any fight knowing they are going to lose just to take a paycheck.
wallstreetbets,ffcav01,t1_ffc8b1g,1579795455.0,Why tho?
wallstreetbets,ffca82u,t1_ffc94ry,1579795058.0,He would make $11. When you sell a credit spread you want the value to reach zero. Means you get to keep the credit.
wallstreetbets,ffc9s58,t1_ffc9jdd,1579794779.0,Make sure you account for taxes...
WGU,ffa2sra,t1_ff8z2i2,1579726745.0,I feel like you need to communicate better with your mentor. Mine had absolutely no problem with my plans or adding additional classes before a weekend. You also need to prove to them that you can hit the goals and deadlines you set together. Missing those or not communicating will lead to delay problems.
wallstreetbets,ff9zffw,t1_ff9yqpr,1579724782.0,"If people are sick, economic activity will presumably get slower.SARS really fucked the market up when that happened."

gifs,ff81ugf,t1_ff7oqv6,1579663785.0,Fires are completely natural and actually needed in some places. The problem is when these fires start from man made actions or events. Fires are not inherently bad for the planet.
worldnews,ff42agi,t1_ff3plcl,1579553987.0,"You are likely correct and I think that is where people make their biggest mistake. Work your ass off and if it doesn’t pay off in your current company rewrite your resume with all that experience and things you have done then apply somewhere else. You will likely get a bump in pay if you do get an offer. After working for a shitty manager for years I finally realized that I need to go out and get these opportunities and pay because my current situation wasn’t going to lead to that. After I landed a new job and being promoted in that job in under a year I made a new rule for myself, start looking for new jobs every 2 years. Only way I will stay where I am at is if I am completely happy with my job and pay or I have a clear path forward with the current company."

WGU,feymy2a,t3_eqlidu,1579447749.0,Usually between 48-72 hours. Just move on to your next course. I did have one come back in less than 2 hours the other day. That was the only time that has happened through about 15-20 tasks.
wallstreetbets,fetkd13,t1_fetj5v5,1579376315.0,"It’s not, it is technology development company. The Plexus you are thinking of is a scam."
wallstreetbets,fetk8ki,t1_fetfsl1,1579376277.0,Different company. They basically take ideas from their clients and create the product and bring it to market. One stop shop for some businesses that have lots of technology based product but don’t specialize in product development like the health field.
mechanicalpuzzles,fen4a8h,t1_fen06zw,1579276647.0,I was actually really surprised when I opened NEWS. It is pretty easy to see how it works once you get it open though.
WGU,femyefe,t3_epykks,1579272797.0,"Even if you do extremely well on the PA it is still worth it to review the questions, even ones you got right. Then do a bit of studying in the weak areas or concepts you didn’t fully understand and got lucky with a question. The OA and PA lined up in this course the difference is some of the questions approach a concept from a different angle or ask about knowledge in the concept that requires some studying."
mechanicalpuzzles,feluha1,t1_fel3e1j,1579231239.0,I can get it in to two different positions but can't figure out how to move from either of those.

WatchPeopleDieInside,fdeofum,t1_fdds44s,1578343294.0,I like how the guy that took blind fold off was the only rational one thinking here. He saw this guy was going to go way too far and his bro was about to get dicked down. The guy’s new wife laughing the whole time being glad she isn’t the one sitting in that chair.

IdiotsInCars,fdczzxb,t1_fdct0xd,1578289492.0,Not true at all. Police don’t have to be called at all unless a statement is needed.
IdiotsInCars,fdczvmb,t1_fdcw11j,1578289377.0,We were told to get the fuck off the road if your car is functional. Sitting there because of a fender bender is retarded and puts everyone at risk.
WatchPeopleDieInside,fdcfp9t,t1_fdcfcqr,1578273761.0,"Trust me I try every chance I get. Had multiple 5 hours flights in a row recently where I tried to upgrade to an emergency row seat on them all, they were all fully booked with no upgrades available. Got even desperate on the last flight and tried to upgrade to first class but that was booked too. It is nicer when my wife goes on flights with me because I can use some of her leg space."
WatchPeopleDieInside,fdceqvb,t1_fdccrag,1578273100.0,"Not saying you should or shouldn't recline but as a guy that is 6'4"" no matter how much reclining I am doing I am not going to get my knees to not be in the back of your seat."
wallstreetbets,fdb5uqr,t1_fdav8de,1578254124.0,This stuff is always priced in. Wouldn’t be surprised if it drops a point or two. BTFD and you should be good as there will be another melt up leading to earnings.
AskReddit,fd4p2wk,t1_fd3ksq8,1578169615.0,Just walk over to a random table and take a little bit of chips from everyone at the table. Everyone would think they just miscounted their chips.
todayilearned,fd39p47,t1_fd2mldz,1578156088.0,Sounds like a lot of marriages fail because the dad doesn’t take care of the child. Moms go through a lot of shit in those first couple years and if they don’t have support can cause a fuck load of resentment.
nextfuckinglevel,fcxfpnd,t1_fcwiciu,1578061738.0,That is a good way to go about it but people literally don’t buy homes because of poor paint choices. Such an easy thing to fix but a lot of people don’t want to mess with it even if the current homeowner says they will change it.
nextfuckinglevel,fcwc6sb,t1_fcw586p,1578022017.0,"Typically stuff like this will not help you sell a home. While you may get lucky and find that exact family that loves it you are effectively narrowing the market to sell to making your chances of selling much lower. It is the same reason pools don't add value to your home, a lot of people don't want to maintain it or have no desire to use it."
nextfuckinglevel,fcwbx43,t1_fcw7ild,1578021841.0,"I don't think the problem is building the treehouse itself, it is the idea of it being inside taking up a large area of space. For the majority of people this is an irresponsible decision simply because they don't have the space to afford to something like this. Once the kids are too big it is a wasted space and takes a major effort to remove."
wallstreetbets,fcvadk1,t1_fcv9nip,1577997965.0,The biggest problem is that no one throws their phone out the window. As soon as one red day comes everyone panic sells locking in losses. The fear of it never going back up even after a small red day is massive.
wallstreetbets,fcustnp,t1_fcurope,1577987812.0,The problem with getting off it makes FOMO even worse which makes you just get in a really bad position. Take what you have and then don’t look at that shit because it might make you cry.
wallstreetbets,fcusmma,t1_fcurpzy,1577987706.0,There is a fuck load of resistance at 160. If it does break 160 should be fairly easy for it to run up to 165ish.
baseball,fcrnvae,t1_fcrbs54,1577904270.0,You can buy entire sets of replica rings like this for under $100. This is not authentic and I am not sure why so many people here think it is or would be.
cursedcomments,fcnbgdd,t1_fcmuyp8,1577808042.0,Pretty sure the concept is for very short flights. Trying to be in that position for more than 20 mins would absolutely suck but a lot of people could probably do it for up to an hour if it meant saving a bunch of money on a flight. As a human that is 6’4” I don’t think I could even do it for 20 mins though.
wallstreetbets,fcmdndo,t1_fcmal75,1577771531.0,The person exercised them at closing on Friday(?). Market took a dump today which allowed this guy to cover the call by buying today as these were naked calls. If the market went the other way he would have lost money on those 15 calls.
wallstreetbets,fcma498,t1_fcm9cjm,1577768392.0,He bought the 1500 shares this morning for around $415 each and sold them for $430 each.
todayilearned,fcl2sjw,t1_fckk097,1577738566.0,You can make adjustments to sights to bring your accuracy where you want without changing anything that is making you precise. Why would I not want to hit something exactly where I am looking?
wallstreetbets,fcl1qg6,t1_fcl1dlr,1577737914.0,Sell. My calls all got obliterated today.
wallstreetbets,fckqnm2,t1_fckpvpx,1577731096.0,It is one of the few stocks going up today and it is cheap. Of course everyone on WSB with their $100 RH accounts is going to buy it.
wallstreetbets,fc9hrp3,t1_fc8mi1s,1577552862.0,Doubt the fractional stuff will be for options. Just buy debit spreads. You can get in to AMZN for less than $100.
