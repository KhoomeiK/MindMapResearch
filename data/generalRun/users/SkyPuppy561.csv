AskWomen,fgr9dy0,t1_fgogqio,1581041343.0,"No you’re just judgy. My husband is amazing and caring and always tweaks his sexual techniques for me. The last two times we got busy, it was all cunnilingus and he got me off real hard in like 30 mins and he didn’t really want anything else because he’d already masturbated that day. I was happy and enjoyed the rest of my evening.

I’m on antidepressants that I’m sure have lowered my libido, but you wouldn’t have known that, now would ya? When you assume, you make an ass out of you and me. Furthermore, I relax by vegging out on the couch and eating snacks. My evening is incomplete without that. So if sex takes too long and it’s already close to bedtime, I crave my winding down routine and start resenting sex for taking so long. Not everyone’s brain works exactly like yours."

AskWomen,fgpz91f,t1_fgpz00a,1581014852.0,Yes! I watched a Youtube video saying not to order coffee aboard the aircraft because the water is less than ideal in cleanliness.
AskWomen,fgpymyg,t1_fgpyhg7,1581014513.0,Indeed. I don’t like their regular coffee because it’s over roasted. That’s why I get Americanos. Though even at Airports I try to get some local fare. There will usually be some cute bakery that sells coffee.
AskWomen,fgpxmd8,t1_fgj8rbf,1581013961.0,Honestly I usually do prefer my local coffee shops. Starbucks usually comes up during road trips though

I’m so tired of hustle culture. Looking at you, Sandra Bullock in The Proposal (or whichever one Ryan Reynolds was in)."
