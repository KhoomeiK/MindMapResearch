Also a bit random, but you hear him all the time in commercials as the Red M&M and as the bee for Honey Nut Cheerios."

HydroHomies,ffbh2w5,t1_ffbg8cq,1579764986.0,"Coconut milk is different. It's made from the grated pulp of the coconut, and is usually used for baking.

The liquid inside of a coconut is called coconut water. It's basically water. Which is why you should watch out for companies that try and market it as a sports drink or vitamin drink or any other crap like that. There's nothing in it but water and a few grams of sugar and fiber."

The PS1 output a 480p resolution image. Some PS3 titles were in 1080p.

That's the difference. It's not consoles vs PC.

It's consoles vs consoles from two generations prior."
movies,fewnnsm,t1_few4rb9,1579415971.0,I think he means specifically the DVD format. DVD is a 480 resolution picture. Blu-ray is 1080 and 4K is 2160. Like who in the fuck hell is still going to be buying a DVD at 480 resolution 11 years from now?
therewasanattempt,fejemik,t1_feihc15,1579170372.0,It wasn't the recipe to Coca-Cola. It was a vial of a new Coca-Cola coffee soda. She thought Pepsi would pay her money to learn what Coke was putting out on the market in the near future.
AdviceAnimals,fehtpm6,t3_eoyr16,1579123674.0,"Yes. They do want you to leave their site.

I'm all for adblockers and don't have a Facebook. But can we stop this whole circle jerk about people leaving the site over it is any different than some Karen demanding to talk to the manager and telling Target she's never coming back.

The sire doesn't want you. It actually costs money for them for you to be there. If they can't monetize you they want you gone; and they do not care, even a little bit, that you're leaving or never coming back."
unpopularopinion,fea3pqv,t1_fe9y9pq,1578944044.0,"Those are enforced by the theaters themselves. The MPAA ratings are just guidelines. It would violate the First Amendment for law to prohibit showing R rated movies to under 18s.

That also applies to NC-17 movies.

unpopularopinion,fea2yzx,t1_fe9et6r,1578943814.0,That's the theater's policy. It is illegal for the government to pass laws mandating age based movie ratings. This even holds true for NC-17 ratings.

todayilearned,fcxsqwx,t1_fcxfaid,1578069965.0,"Also it's only factoring in the base cost to the owner of the vehicle. And not the wear and tear on the infrastructure.

 You pay taxes on your gas you buy now to raise money to pay for roads, highways, bridges and the like. 

By the time fully autonomous electric cars are around and doing this everyone is going to have to find a new method of raising those taxes. And the idea now seems to be to tax the vehicles based on their mileage. Your car driving around constantly all day while you're at work is going to very quickly become very expensive."

PewdiepieSubmissions,fctnog8,t1_fct37is,1577950444.0,"That's outdated research. The current idea is that it arrived from the hundred thousand laborers the British and French brought in during the first World War. As there are records of many of them arriving from Northern China with respiratory diseases. It is believed it spread from them, to soldiers, back to their countries of origin through Etaples. A small French commune in Calais, a major hub into and out of Europe for the Allied Powers, packed with tens of thousands of soldiers they didn't have room for."
relationship_advice,fbx0vpw,t1_fbw3ynq,1577165159.0,"Lawyer usually won't matter.

Courts take the position of doing what is in the best interest of the child. This means both ""parents"" providing for the child.

Even if the father was deceived and its not their child, courts will still require them to pay.

Go google the topic and find thousands of pages of people frustrated over this exact thing. Even with lawyers. It's almost impossible to wash your hands of a child you've already established paternity of."
