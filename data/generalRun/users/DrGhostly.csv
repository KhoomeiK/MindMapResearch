anime,ff8d3qk,t3_es79w3,1579673534.0,"Sakurasou no Pet Na Kanojo (The Pet Girl of Sakurasou) is a solid one if you haven’t already IMO - all six characters get development along with a seventh to a point. It’s as much about figuring out what to do about your career as a high schooler along with relationships.

Another one I really liked that didn’t get a second season was Bokura wa Minna Kawaisou (The Kawai Complex Guide to Manors and Hostel Behavior). Very nicely drawn and decently animated anime with admittedly trope-ish characters but the more you get to know them the less trope-y they get.

Golden Time is another good one, written by the same author of Toradora. One thing annoyed me about that show but it doesn’t ruin it. Great anime to get into about college kids in their freshman (/sophomore) year AND the romance happens before the second half starts).

Part of it was a friend of mine cosplaying as Marceline and Marshal Lee for one con a few years ago kind of as a joke (we were both tall and had natural black hair). The genuine excitement - especially from little kids - kind of made me realize this. All we did was dress like them, dye our skin and make paper mache guitars.
