Guitar,ffjpfvm,t3_etv10v,1580003653.0,"I have this problem too, so much.

If anyone wants to work through this, the best advice I can give from experience is to play through riffs you've written in the same key, and see if you can stitch them together in any reasonable way. You might have to make some faster or slower than intended so that everything makes sense in terms of tempo, but I've come up with some compositions that I think, somehow, turned out okay as a result."
Guitar,ffjowto,t1_ffj1vjc,1580003299.0,"T h i s right here. If you don't live near any well-known stores in the music merchandising industry, you're likely not able to try many left handed guitars before you buy them. There are cool lefty guitars out there, sure, but it's more profitable for stores to only stock very basic options for left handed players since they make up such a tiny part of the guitar sales."

Guitar,ffh9kd4,t1_ffh99ye,1579927071.0,"It's possible that it's too thick, but if not it could still be fixed.

I am no pro, but whenever a pin doesn't want to stay down for me, I look for some kind of tool that has a rubber-coated or soft handle (like a pair of vice grips) and tap on the pin a few times with the soft handle side of the tool. That should hopefully do the trick.

EDIT: just read the other comment left here by another user, it is worth mentioning new strings can just be un-cooperative. Hopefully something in this comment section helps though!"
Guitar,ffh939j,t3_etm04g,1579926653.0,"My first inclination is that your new strings are a different gauge (thickness) than the previous ones. With different thickness, the tension on the strings once they've been wound will be different, and all kinds of little changes to a guitar's performance can happen as a result.

I wouldn't suspect THIS much, but if the string gauge is different enough, your guitar's neck may be at a new angle due to the change in tension--hard to spot at first, but easy to feel.

I'm rambling. TL;DR: if you purchased thicker or thinner strings than you previously were playing with, that may be at least part of the problem."

depression,ffb0hed,t3_esmd7l,1579748764.0,"In a mental health context, it seems to be somewhat common and it's kinda worrisome; I say that as someone who used to do it a lot.

In terms of the general population, it may not be as normal. I want to piggyback off that by saying that doesn't make anyone who has the urges bad, or worth less than anyone else. It's a coping mechanism, if a maladaptive one."

EDIT: forgot to add, this is *very* low, so if by any chance you are changing to this from something like the Standard E tuning, you may have rather flappy strings."
Leftyguitarists,ffag619,t3_esi0v9,1579734981.0,"It depends on what you want to play stylistically/what kinds of sounds you'd prefer.

The Contemporary has an HH pickup setup, which gives it a superstrat kind of vibe--possibly specializing in higher gain and heavier kinds of music. Clean tones will be a little warmer and fuller than that of the Classic Vibe.

The Classic vibe is SSS and they will get you bright and poppy clean tones, and some bluesy/classic rock vibes with gain. It's arguably more versatile due to the nature of having three pickups, but I haven't had enough strat experience to really say if that's so."
Guitar,ff9vs54,t3_esemwa,1579722584.0,"My flair probably gives it away, but I feel more like getting something at an affordable price point and modding it up if I feel the need to make it play or sound better.

depression,ff9q52c,t1_ff9mkl0,1579718481.0,"You're welcome, always. It's also worth saying that it's okay to be sensitive. Some people just internalize things differently, and an occasional unfortunate result is that someone in our lives may not mix well with people like you or me.

These situations take some understanding, from both parties involved even--I don't know the context of course, but for example a close friend of mine had not known anyone to be as open as I am about mental health, and it took them some time to adjust to me, but they came around eventually.

If I were in this situation I would give him an ultimatum that he's either got to change his tune and get a bit more understanding or I'm moving on from him. That's most likely because I have little patience for things like this though; there could be some other option for you because you give off the vibe of being rather patient.

Something I have learned with time is that having a partner is so very difficult with a mental illness. I had someone who said they were worried about me, even when we spent time together, and thinking about the way I was at that time, they were probably fair in saying that.

That same person was determined not to let me go, and still hasn't, even though we've found that being friends is better for us.

I'm feeling older than I truly am, and pretty tired, but something really deep inside can't give up the hope that there must be someone who not only fights for me, but wants to spend their future with me. I sincerely hope you have this feeling too, and if you aren't sure you do, that you are able to find it someday soon. Even the troubled ones deserve to be loved imo."

It was the first non-solidbody electric I had ever played and I was hooked on the idea of owning one from that moment. I have a semi-hollow now, but... it's not that Streamliner.
