A 2008 car isn't as safe as a 2018 car, so I wouldn't expect a 2008 car seat to be as safe as a 2018 car seat."
Minneapolis,feymbr2,t1_fewowx9,1579447527.0,The only reason I like Mesa so much is because they made me realize my current favorite pizza--bbq chicken and pineapple with a little onion. Was this a late-night-and-I'm-starving decision? Absolutely.
trashy,feooxgg,t1_feo130s,1579303305.0,"This is exactly how it works. Usually, the company who owns the product rights will have an agreement with Target to provide display models, display shelves, testers (for perfume/lotion/etc) for $0.01. The total cost of those products (since it costs money to create display products) is worked into the cost agreements between the vendor and retailer. If there isn't a price it can't be properly ordered or invoiced, hence the penny price."

FierceFlow,fegoqto,t1_feg9i0u,1579098927.0,"That's about accurate for hair growth, actually! Average growth is ~3/4"" every six weeks which is ~6.5"" a year."
childfree,feglxhw,t1_fegfnx2,1579096798.0,It's almost like different people like different things. I was also happy to fish but after an hour or so I was done unless it was a very active spot. I'd just wind up with my line in the water right over the side of the boat watching the panfish nip at my empty hook.

AskReddit,feay00b,t3_eo3q9l,1578953383.0,"Right now, I'm at work. Nine hours ago, I was in bed. Depending on when the ""you are now naked"" condition kicked in, I would either be extremely embarrassed but ultimately okay (I have an outfit of yoga clothes in my desk and have a blanket wrapped around me right now) or perfectly fine, if confused when I wake up."
parrots,fdwhf6h,t1_fdwbjl2,1578758724.0,"Not for noise. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWvbfFJZ248 It's an old not very high quality video, but lays out some of the downsides of parrot keeping (with audio clips of different species!) Even budgies can be similarly [noisy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o48aqrO9IZM). Parrots are intelligent and beautiful and can be very affectionate, which draws people in, but most people don't have the capability to care for them. They're loud and messy and can be [dangerous](http://www.parrotforums.com/attachments/macaws/10029d1390791305-bad-macaw-bite-please-help-image.jpg): those beaks are meant to crack nuts and seeds and can do a lot of damage. If they're sitting on your shoulder and freak out, your head is right there for beaks, claws, and wings to hurt.

If you can find a parrot rescue, you can get your bird fix there without signing up for 15-80 years of bird commitment. (That's the other thing--are you prepared to write your will to take care of your bird? I spoke to an older lady who did that. She got her birds in her 20s and is in her 60s now. Her cockatoo is going to outlive her.) Even sparrows live 12-14 years; finches have shorter lifespans, but sparrows/finches aren't as smart or affectionate as parrots. I live in an apartment and can't take care of a bird--plus, all my pans are nonstick and that's poisonous to them--so I've been looking for a rescue where I can volunteer."
parrots,fdw91n3,t1_fdvq6ag,1578756317.0,"Chickens. Seriously, all parrots are very noisy. When I was a kid, a family a block away (~220 m) had parrots and would put their cages out on the porch in the summer. Sometimes we could hear the parrots from inside our house with the doors and windows shut. You live in an apartment. Do not get a large bird."

fatlogic,fdqejne,t1_fdpr9wo,1578664609.0,"I watch documentaries while I'm climbing! Listening to David Attenborough's voice is very soothing when I'm sweating and want to die. War and sometimes history documentaries get me pumped--it's like listening to intense music. Science keeps me focused on what I'm listening to, not what I'm doing. I just find something that looks interesting and will cover the whole workout time."
childfree,fdp4ber,t1_fdor1xz,1578619677.0,"Do you know of any threads solely focused on noise cancelling? I don't care much about music sound quality when I'm traveling, but almost all headphone recommendations are focused on sound quality."
