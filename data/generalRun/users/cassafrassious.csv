babies,ffcfzy3,t3_esptd1,1579798649.0,"The newborn stage can be ROUGH! If you have a coparent I highly recommend taking shifts. One of you go to bed super early- like 6pm, and get up after around 6 hours while the other does baby duty, then switch for the next 6 or so hours. (Obviously, if you’re breastfeeding your partner will have to bring the baby in to eat, but they can handle diaper change and burping while you go back to sleep afterwards)"

Nurse,ffc2fix,t1_ffc229b,1579789850.0,"You can feel that way, and you’re entitled to your opinion. I find that my patients are happier and that we operate more like a team when I give them some information about me when they ask. If I took offense every time a sick person was rude to me I’d do nothing except be offended and not a lot of care would be achieved. So I choose to let the lack of manners, as you put it, go, and focus instead on moving our nurse/patient relationship forward."

If we’re short and you’re out sick then I’m thinking they failed to plan staffing contingencies not blaming you (unless you were sick all night and called out at, like 6:59...just make sure you call early enough and there’s no part of it that’s your fault)

Nurse,ffbprtn,t3_esnxdi,1579777621.0,"I’m 32 and this is my second career, but I have a serious baby face. I still get this a lot from patients. I try to remember that they’re in a situation where most of their autonomy has been stripped away from them, and they’re just trying to comfort themselves by ensuring I’m qualified to be their nurse. I usually share a little about myself (using my judgement and depending on the patient) because I think it’s therapeutic for them to have a connection in which, on a personal level, at least, we’re equals and I’m not in charge of them."
nursing,ffbpfbw,t1_ffb9qqd,1579777119.0,"Nursing school was hard. The first year on the floor was HARD, and I felt often that maybe I’d made a mistake. Floor nursing is not easy. Now that I’m getting my sea legs, so to speak, it’s not as bad. When I look at the big picture, this is so much better than life before. I work fewer hours for more money than before. I do not feel that crushing monotony that weighed me down in the office- mentally and physically. I am challenged to really think at work. I have a lot more time with my family, and being able to run errands on random weekdays is really nice. Juggling my schedule is more difficult, but hasn’t truly negatively impacted me. Importantly for me too, I’m proud to share what I do now.

So, tldr: yes,  I’ve had regrets; but, they were short lived and my life is greatly improved on the whole now"

Just because you had this epiphany isn’t going to give it to her too. And, while you have a strong argument, it’s only a theory that has yet to be tested at this point. You and your wife need to rationally get on the same page before you make any changes with the kids’ schedules."

Make sure they know that their behavior is unacceptable and that you love them always. Your relatives may or may not be crappy disciplinarians- but try not to judge too much without the context of experience"
Parenting,fet6uzf,t3_eqikgk,1579372319.0,"If I recall correctly the most important thing about that “3 day” method is when you do it because the kid has to basically be at least half way there already on their own. But, there’s really not a “normal.”

My daughter basically just transitioned to underwear one day after her pull-ups had been dry for about a month. Asked her to keep the characters on her underwear dry and clean and no issues...for about two weeks. Then we had to do it all again. It took about 3 go-arounds to stick with her.

Your son is probably not going to shit himself daily in college, so just take it one day at a time. He’ll get there."

There can be a whole slew of ethical and moral questions. If I’m removing lifesaving measures on my father am I morally the one responsible for his death? Is it a sin to choose your own death? What if dad said he wanted to fight this until the end? Is this the end he meant?

The conversation needs to be more commonplace when we’re healthy. The reality of death needs to be destigmatized and more openly accepted. Doctors in particular need to have frank discussions with their terminally ill patients about what end of life options they have and what those look and feel like. It’s too much to make someone decide, or worse- decide for another person in the heat of the moment. Emotional people are just flat out not rational people."

Sure the methylprednisolone they’re getting inhibits the production of proinflammatory cytokines by activating receptors on the nuclear level which disrupts their synthesis, but all the patient can absorb right now is that this solu-medrol is going to help with the swelling and open up your airway."

They’re middle of the line for Americans, and like I mentioned, as a former biller, I’ve seen policies like the one we have leave people destitute. I think that Medicare for all will improve benefits nearly across the board. I think that in terms of affecting my job I don’t think it’ll change much. Probably a little more emphasis on things like pressure injuries and cautis and that’s a good thing. I see the acuity of our younger patients going down on the whole, but still lots of boomers aging so plenty of job security in acute care."

We already pay for the emergency care the people who fall through the cracks get, and it’s way more expensive than paying for their preventative care would be. Studies show that universal healthcare costs taxpayers less than our current system. It won’t be perfect, but just like I say about food stamps: I’d rather accidentally help a bad person than accidentally hurt a good person."

They were something that really put me out of my comfort zone at first. If you think you’re seeing one then get the patient in a safe position, tell another nurse, take vitals, put O2 on,  Most patients with seizures in their history will have a PRN medication like IV Ativan to quell them. Call a rapid response if you think you need to. Just talk to the patient, I’ll usually hold a hand or rub their shoulder and say something like. “Okay, patient, I’m right here with you.”

Things can get rough when you’re missing a holiday, hungry, watching our bullshit medical system bankrupt or otherwise screw over a patient or coworker, or dealing with a life threatening issue. However, working three days out of every 7, not having to cram all of my personal stuff and family time into the evenings and weekends, and the occasional feeling that I improved someone’s quality of life counterbalance that. I also get to look out of a window every day. I never saw the sun when I worked in an office. If I learned something from going back to school for this it’s that very few people love their work all of the time, and everyone’s back starts hurting at a certain age- being on your feet using your body and getting paid decently to do it is a treat in our society even when it doesn’t feel like it is."

Nurse,fddhgax,t3_ekj0tz,1578312438.0,"I would not just pick up overtime in my first year. I’m coming out of my first and it was so taxing without taking on extra shifts. Being a new nurse is absolutely draining and it sounds like your mom doesn’t have the experience to know that.

I have not looked into a masters or anything like that yet, but I’ve heard they want at least 2 years experience anyway- so if that is true then you have time to save up. As for getting out of bedside quickly- there is value in time on the ground. No one wants a manager who lacks experience. 

Finally, from personal experience coming from an office job to bedside I know that sedentary labor breaks your body just as quickly or quicker than manual labor. I value being on my feet and using my body daily. You will get shit on by somebody (metaphorically...and sometimes literally) no matter what level of nursing you are in.

I had a “friend” who I really enjoyed hanging out with in certain situations, but who treated me like a second class citizen at school. I called him on it and he really seemed to be trying to do better. It was high school and we were all self conscious and trying to fit in- I chalked it up to a learning experience and tried to be forgiving. After that in gym class one day we were casually playing basketball when told me that a bunch of guys were making fun of me in the locker room, but because we’re friends he said nothing. I told him a friend would have said something against it. 

In such a simple moment I lost all desire to maintain that friendship. It was like something that had been a source of joy in my life turned to ash. It really hurt me, and it still hurts looking back more than a decade later. In a single moment he had confirmed my worst fears about how others saw me and uncovered that there were fewer people in my corner than I had thought. I often wonder if he ever truly understood how much his lack of support and action undermined my sense of trust in others."

I felt like I was an office drone. It was the same thing day in and day out. Just sitting at my cubicle in a warehouse room with no windows. My back started hurting from all the sitting. My eyesight started declining from staring at the computer all day. I was not proud in any way of my career. I saw my dad work a physically demanding job and I saw that he remained so much stronger than his peers without having to go to the gym or workout. I thought: this is crap. I want a job that works for me like that and I want to feel like I did something worthwhile at the end of my day.

It’s just enough to keep my mind occupied without adding stress and it does not allow me to continue focusing on my fear. 

Once I’ve conquered my fear I’m left with just a healthy little bit of anxiety that fuels me and keeps me on my toes.

But I also use the term fat for myself. I’m fat. That’s a fact. It used to be an insult to me, but I definitely feel a sense of identity in it now. I’m fat. I work out. My labs look great. I am still fat- and note that I did not say ugly."
