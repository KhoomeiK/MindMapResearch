MUD,ff5602n,t1_ff3f76i,1579581207.0,"For cases like Armageddon where most of the bad talk is done off platform, I dont think a poll is necessary. Polls should only be used as a way to see what features the players want, not as a way to judge controversial statements. If your game is marred with griefers and people who keep posting incriminating stuff about it on reddit then maybe theres something else going on that keeps causing this to happen.

Ignoring that use case, a good way to encourage people to join a poll is through in game rewards. Perhaps if you participate in a poll your rewarded with increased luck for finding items for 30 minutes while playing. Lots of ways to go about it, and players will almost never complain if their efforts to improve the game are rewarded in someway by the developers."

MUD,ff2ut5x,t1_feyn3ht,1579525013.0,"I suppose its important to find ways to figure out if the vocal minority really is the minority. A good way to do this might be to hold a vote over the course of a few days so that everyone gets to participate. Even if you ultimately dont go with what the vote churns out, atleast you'll know what the community is feeling about a certain feature of situation.

Not only that, but the community will feel like the developers are listening to feedback. Sometimes the transparency in listening is all you need to thwart even the loudest of voices. If you show that your listening then theres no need to scream at you, right?"

MUD,fel5puc,t1_fekroko,1579214625.0,Heavy change is always going to be unpopular. I'll always stand by it though.
MUD,fekh6om,t1_fekcg9v,1579199963.0,"Players are only vocal about changes because they are passionate. If a change leaves the entire community sour, then its the developers responsibility to figure out why that change wasnt well received and what they want to do about it.

If the developer makes a decision that causes a majority of players to leave, its not the players fault for leaving, its the developers fault for not listening. Defaulting to ""If they dont like it they can go elsewhere"" is a great way to expedite that process in my opinion.  


edit: spelling."
MUD,fef4adr,t1_fecrqta,1579047839.0,"I agree 100% with this. I think if MUDs want more attention then they have now, then its going to have to sacrifice some of the things that were used to.. For example.. almost all MUD clients look like legacy-ware and still use tel-net as a primary connection."
