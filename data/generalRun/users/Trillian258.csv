It's kind of a mouthful of a name though. I ended up just calling him ""Sparta"" most of the time. My SO liked to call him ""Sparty Party"" lol"
todayilearned,fefaccf,t1_feexsz1,1579051909.0,I read that book when I was eleven. It had an everlasting impression on me. I read his other books but don't remember them as well.

How dare people using sarcasm not make sure everyone understands by adding the /s at the end of the comment!?

ETA: He never really taught us anything anyway. He would mostly make us do sing a longs with him (???) Like De colores (spelling?) And ""La Pulga de San Jose"" which btw I still sing to annoy my SO üòÇ"

todayilearned,fdgxh7v,t1_fdgur2l,1578410733.0,"Also can't landfills sink if there is a large enough earthquake? Sometimes Sandy or unstable landmasses that were built near the ocean can ""liquidate"" during an earthquake. At least I'm pretty sure I remember that from my earth science BS degree Lol"

MuseumOfReddit,fdcxf0g,t1_fdcuu56,1578287144.0,"Quark meets those qualifications against his own wishes.

 There is an entire episode based around his cousin trying to get him exiled from Ferengenar for not being ""Ferengi"" enough. He says stuff like ""I know you have been compassionate! You pay your employees fair wages! You helped so-and-so!"" And Quark tries to lie cover up all the good deeds he has done. 

Obviously I don't remember it word for word but yeah. His entire character arc is how he becomes a better person in general."

IncelTears,fczem8x,t1_fcwnors,1578099467.0,True and thanks for showing me that sub!!!
LetsNotMeet,fcxmhdy,t1_fcxjcg1,1578066477.0,Yes I completely agree! I also think the people at the party who know who he is should be made aware of the fact that he stalked OP and threatened him. They might not realize JUST how psychotic the man is.
LetsNotMeet,fcxm6gh,t1_fcxf877,1578066275.0,"..... I'm absolutely baffled. No one at the party seemed to be as alarmed or weirded out as you guys? I don't understand. Why didn't anyone else say something to you? He clearly had been going around telling everyone. I don't understand why everyone at the party seemed to just shrug it off. Especially after the bathroom incident.....

ETA: perhaps you should tell your wife's family and have them let the party hosts know about his behavior. Because he's obviously dangerous and the people who threw the party don't seem to be aware of that fact. Did you ever find out who he was in relation to the party goers?"
IncelTears,fcw836b,t1_fcw1lge,1578019301.0,I fucking love xena and Hercules. Grew up on those shows. People hate on them and call them cheesy but honestly it's some of the best television IMO. Sam Raimi is the best. I also grew up watching all the evil deads as they were my dad's favorites. I didn't even realize two things I loved so deeply were created by the same dude!

entitledparents,fcr8jqd,t1_fcqzk9x,1577898342.0,"It really sucks that he went looney tunes because his earlier works are absolutely fucking amazing. His books were my favorite back when I was a teen (~2002 - 2006). 

Then he started going in that weird overly religious (and hateful) direction and it really sucked. When someone you once looked up to turns out to be awful its just a little soul crushing."

AmItheAsshole,fcmvbl1,t1_fcmblje,1577793967.0,"Dude if she's crying over something like this, that means she is making her husband's love like a competition between her and her daughter. That's really, really bad. Imagine how that would play out as the girl gets older? Imagine how she might be treated by her mother if her mom thinks she needs to compete with her? 

It's a serious thing dude."

relationship_advice,fbz9tlw,t1_fbyr7v7,1577239619.0,"Yes this is exactly what I was thinking the entire time I was reading this post! And then the follow up comments OP left just cemented it all - that disgusting douchebag is abusing his position of power in that ""Church,"" targeting vulnerable young women (girls?), AND he has you totally brainwashed to the point where you seem significantly more upset at your GF than him!!!

Perhaps she did cheat on you with him, but who knows how she felt! Maybe she felt like she couldn't say no because he's the PASTOR. Maybe he manipulated her? He's clearly manipulating you, OP, and whoever else attends that Church. Maybe he raped her and she's too humiliated to tell anyone? That is very common among rape survivors. The fact that he has a significant amount of power over her makes her a victim, point blank. 

I mean unless it was all her relentlessly pursuing him... But I highly doubt it after finding out about the other women he's abused."
AskReddit,fbwsf9f,t3_eetf7i,1577158199.0,"When I was still pretty effing little, like maybe 7 or 8, a couple of my girlfriends and I would make out and dry hump when playing ""house."" I'm a girl. At the time none of us really understood why we were doing it, it just felt good I guess lol. 

And yeah, I did grow up to be bi. I don't think my friends did though. Haha."
