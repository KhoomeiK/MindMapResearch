Psychonaut,ffdkrj8,t1_ffdjfk2,1579822962.0,"This thought drove me insane for two months after i started dealing with panic attacks and anxiety until i realized that the very concept is impossible. I could get into it more myself if i were better at explaining things, haha. Hopefully the article explains it well enough."
Psychonaut,ffdiwo9,t3_estlr7,1579821826.0,[Heres](https://stray-ideas.blogspot.com/2011/08/why-solipsism-is-impossible.html) a good article that explains why its impossible for 'you' to be the only one that exists.
assassinscreed,ffazadi,t1_fekds53,1579747958.0,"They use the word 'terrorist' in the description of Snakes character bio, so i doubt it, lol."
nomoreheroes,ff5n9j5,t1_ff5n061,1579601434.0,I never got the chance to properly play 1 or 2 (Watched both online and fell in love with them regardless) so i've been dying for a Switch port myself honestly. Seems pretty likely considering we already have NMH3 coming and it would be a perfect way to get more people into the series.
nomoreheroes,ff5mxwx,t3_ersar2,1579600948.0,"Yes. No deal between them has been confirmed yet, however."
afterlife,ff5afzl,t1_ff58sla,1579585185.0,"Not all of them even report seeing religious figures/places, however. Most claim they were simply floating above their body or 'transcended' to a place where time as we know it doesn't exist."

PS4,ff4dp8z,t3_erf4eo,1579561167.0,How many games have been delayed this month
metalgearsolid,ff2ahum,t3_er70i5,1579498706.0,Cool how he grew some hair while he was at it
smashbros,ff02u8f,t3_eqwfey,1579464577.0,"To me, the character themselves is just as, if not more important than the moveset they're given. This is literally a game about 'video game all-stars,' how could you not care?"
smashbros,feqqhmr,t1_feqo4m5,1579344908.0,"And wielded a chainsaw sword. Say what you will about Corrin, but atleast he stood out a little bit. (tho if you ask me mostly in a bad way but thats besides the point)"
smashbros,fepllui,t1_feplctg,1579323722.0,Yeah. Though if it were just Marth and/or Ike they'd definitely stand out compared to the rest of the cast. But since there are already so many Fire Emblem characters none of them feel unique anymore.
PS4,fepjydn,t3_eq9e3z,1579322445.0,I've spent countless time just web-swinging around the city in this game. One of the only open-world games i've genuinely enjoyed thanks to how well they implemented this mechanic.
smashbros,fep42se,t1_fep3c6z,1579311675.0,"Still a relatively small group of people compared to the overall Fire Emblem fanbase. Not only that, but like i said, they seem more interested in the character for what they represent than the way they're designed or written."
smashbros,fep1509,t1_fep0bqu,1579309809.0,"I realize every character has their fans. Im just speaking for what i perceive to be the majority. But hey, maybe i'm wrong and people do have a genuine connection with the character."
smashbros,fep0x4l,t1_fep0frd,1579309673.0,"Like, as a character? If so, thats great. I should've clarified and said *most* Fire Emblem fans. Atleast, i've never encountered anyone whose particularly fond of Byleth as an actual character."
smashbros,fep01a1,t1_feozm6o,1579309112.0,"Same. I have nothing against Fire Emblem or even Byleth as a character, but there are billions of far more interesting choices out there. Fire Emblem or not."
afterlife,feovt7s,t1_feouvx8,1579306492.0,Aight then.
afterlife,feoulng,t3_ep1780,1579305780.0,I seriously thought the title said Howard Stern.
afterlife,feoufp3,t1_feoqram,1579305679.0,Not sure i follow you?
smashbros,feou3xe,t3_eq6zq6,1579305550.0,Truth be told i don't think even hardcore FE fans are that hyped for the character himself rather than his moveset and the game he represents. Nothing about his/her visual design particularly stands out as unique or recognizable and they don't have any personality or dialogue to speak of.
smashbros,feod2fh,t3_eq0ypq,1579298456.0,The only thing i had any hype for in this direct other than Cuphead. Makes me wish we got Ezio as a fighter with a remix of Venice Rooftops.
PS4,femf9g3,t3_epmi0s,1579252435.0,"damn, everythings getting delayed"
afterlife,femb3nm,t3_epx80m,1579246757.0,Would certainly be one of the best case scenarios of the afterlife.
nintendo,fekvjnk,t3_epjsqp,1579208480.0,Because this game didn't have enough Fire Emblem

nomoreheroes,fd58qr0,t3_ejzo7c,1578175258.0,kinda wish they stuck with the first idea.
afterlife,fcpxh2h,t3_ef9hov,1577874252.0,I remember hearing about a few cases where blind people could 'see' again after having 'died.' But i'm not totally certain about the legitimacy of those incidents since i've only heard about them from a few Youtube videos. So who knows.
