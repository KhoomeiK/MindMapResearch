Handwriting,ffy5nwx,t3_eumlxv,1580339026.0,"I actually think your handwriting is kind of cute. However it has no rhythm and the letters all angle different directions, which can make it appear ugly or goofy when multiple words are on the page. As people have suggested, practicing italics will help you keep all your letters angled the same direction and I'm sure your cute handwriting will improve drastically when multiple words are looked at at a time"
