fatlogic,fe0mo10,t1_fdxhh8w,1578816163.0,"Since losing weight my 14s (which are huge holy hell how did I fit these to the point they were tight once?) have become my travel jeans. Whenever I'm in a car or something for long periods of time, they're ideal bc I have a preexisting knee injury that makes sitting long periods in tight jeans painful. The 14s are fucking massive on me but they're loose enough nothing pulls on my knee."

fatlogic,fcqbypq,t3_ei3zsk,1577882985.0,"Rave: I've been in Israel for almost 2 weeks at this point and I am at least 90% sure I've been losing weight after hitting a stall point before leaving. My Jean's are all looser, and part of it has to be the amount of walking I've been doing just to get around and see things (over 20k steps yesterday according to my fitbit)"
