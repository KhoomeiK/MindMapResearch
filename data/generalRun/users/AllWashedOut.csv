Are potatoes expensive in your country? Potatoes have a lot of vitamin C. (Eat the skin to get all the vitamins.)

I don't know as much about calcium. There are some plant sources (beans, nuts, spinach) but they may be as expensive as dairy. It seems like low calcium doesn't kill you directly. But it makes your bones more breakable.

It might explain why Americans are tall though. I read that immigrant children grow taller than their parents here because of all the calcium."

If that works for your case, look into 'nut pockets' but replace the nut with a magnet. For example,  [https://www.3ders.org/articles/20141127-formlabs-shares-designs-to-add-screw-threading-to-3d-printed-objects.html](https://www.3ders.org/articles/20141127-formlabs-shares-designs-to-add-screw-threading-to-3d-printed-objects.html) 

Basically you leave a pocket that is parallel to the faces you want to bond but accessible from a different face. After printing you just press the magnet in, and optionally seal it with glue. There will be some layers of plastic between the magnets."

None of the foods you mentioned have much vitamin c. That could be a more immediate problem than cholesterol. Low vitamin c for a month can lead to bruising, bleeding and fatigue (scurvy). One of my friends temporarily lost his hair from it. See if you can get a fruit or juice occasionally. Or a vitamin supplement pill is even cheaper where I live (1/5 the price of an egg).

But dried beans cost 1/2 as much as chicken where I live, so I guess our prices are pretty different."
asknutritionists,ffpt0g3,t1_ffk0n57,1580104611.0,"Got it. Since price is important, you may want to read up on vegetable proteins. They're usually cheaper than meat or eggs.

For example beans or peas are protein rich. You just need to eat a grain also to 'complete' their protein mix. Rice and beans is the most affordable combination. 1 cup of rice and beans has as much protein as an egg.

Lentils stew is also good. The base is just lentils, tomato, and as much spicy pepper as you like. Then I add any old leftover vegetables I can get: onions, potato, garlic, carrots, celery, corn, whatever. Salt, paprika, or cumin make it better but are optional."

Next time you go to a doctor, ask if they will check you cholesterol levels. You're probably fine.

There are other cheap things you can do related to cholesterol. Olive oil or canola oil might be better than butter or lard when cooking. Exercise is good. Smoking is bad. Too much alcohol is bad."
