Interestingly, I reread an article from 2018 where it stated that a poll showed 65% of Americans approve of spanking by parents (not necessarily with a belt or switch). I can’t speak to the validity of that poll but it stuck out.

Personally, I was spanked. Even once or twice with a belt. I don’t hold anything against my parents for that. And I’m not a parent myself so I can’t honestly say what I would do.

nfl,ffd7oz0,t1_ffd698k,1579815028.0,"Haha I knew my comment would invite some flak.

I actually lived in TX for 5 years and my brother lived in SC 5 years. All three styles of BBQ have their advantages.

The vinegar/mustard sauce of SC is delicious. I think you’d be hard pressed to find a better pulled pork sandwich than in SC. 

Central Texas owns brisket and sausage. Anyone who says otherwise instantly loses my trust in their opinion. The sausages in German towns like Elgin, new Braunfels, etc. is unlike anywhere else. TX is so big there is like 3 other distinct types of BBQ. Barbacoa in South Texas is amazing. I don’t know the other styles that well.

KC owns burnt ends and ribs imo. Also, I tend to prefer the sides from KC more (such as sweeter beans), but that just boils down to preference. 

Depending on where you come from you can talk shit on any other place with the right ammo if you know how to hit their sweet spot. For instance, KC BBQ tends to have thin sliced, leaner brisket and it generally requires some sauce. The fattier parts of the brisket are used for burnt ends. From a Central TX point of view you can talk shit that Kc doesn’t know how to do fatty brisket so that it stands on its own so they chop it down into burnt ends and sauce them up more. That hurts to hear as a KC BBQ fan bc burnt ends are incredible and one of your BBQ staples. 

I’m curious if anyone disagrees with my assessment cause I’d honestly like to learn more about BBQ haha. 

I’ll admit idk shit about Memphis style BBQ"

CollegeBasketball,ffc91lj,t1_ffbx5bn,1579794312.0,"You’re a very difficult person to reason with particularly because you misrepresent what I say so consistently. You have also “moved the goalposts” —now you seem to be interested in whether the coach took the “logical, standard, ‘right’ approach,” which I think we both agree he didn’t, whereas your initial comments proposed his actions may have caused Love direct harm. Really, the burden of proof lies on whoever would claim he caused harm. But we/you got so hung up on my word “grab” and things continued to derail from there. 

An example of misrepresentation: you said “if you really want to keep pushing the idea that maybe he actually helped...” That is simply not what I said. I said I cannot say for certain whether his action actually put Love in a worse position. Which I can’t. I’ve also said I believe he was *trying* to help, not that he “maybe actually helped.” I’ve said explicitly I don’t think he did a good job of it.

The question whether or not Love was in a better or worse position after the shove is the most relevant question to supporting your initial claim. You provided a couple examples of things that should be evaluated (e.g. he could have been stomped). I provided some alternative considerations—one being the space created between the two players—and your response was  an appeal to me to use common sense, which doesn’t seem like the path to the “highly logical and reasonable certainty” you seek. 

You then also chose to twist what I said into a hypothetical where coaches are trained that the next best option is to shove a player to the ground.

Following these misrepresentations with condescending and affective language like “come on man, just looking for some common sense” is also annoying and seemingly inconsistent with the spirit of your comments. To say things like “I’m sure you are smart enough to understand...” does not bolster your argument in any way. You just end up coming off like a jerk.

These discussions do interest me. I admit my final comments calling your focus silly and making assumptions about your level of concern were unfair. I understand you seem interested in seeking truth, and I do appreciate that. 

In short, I don’t think you are holding yourself to the same standards you seem to expect of others.

Setting a precedent is a great point too. I get that it can act as a deterrent and ultimately could benefit the safety of the game. Then again, idk if someone in that state of anger would think back to the precedent or not, maybe... but the idea is made with good intentions and the relative harm, what I feel is an extra ~4ish games, is pretty inconsequential in the grand scheme of things.

I stayed at the same hotel as TTU at the Big 12 tournament in 2007. For some reason the hotel was sponsored(?) by Fanta. Fanta cases everywhere. 12 packs Built into big structures in the lobby. It was shangri-la to 7th grade me who packed my Xbox to stay up late in my hotel with my buddy Peter after the games.

It was my first time at a tourney and first time I could see the legendary Bob Knight in person (my dad always made jokes about him). Sadly, TTU was bounced in the quarterfinals, right before I arrived. I wasn’t going to see that coach go crazy if we played him the next day. Oh well.

But as I was checking in, I see the TTU team start to exit the hotel. And slowly I hear the faint grumblings of a tirade that, as it becomes clearer, is stuffed with just about every word my parents tell me not to say. I can’t even really comprehend anything but the *motherfuckers, Goddamns* and *bullshits* bouncing of the weird marble fountain of our Embassy Suites. I knew what was coming..

Bob Knight rounds the corner. In the flesh. First time ever seeing him in person, and he is in peak form. As he passes by, he takes one quick breath, not more than 10ft away, grabs himself a 12-pack of Cherry Fanta and launches right back into it on his way out the door. The sliding door closes, the lobby in silence for a few extra seconds..

When I finally pick my jaw up off the floor my mind immediately goes to: “Dad, can everyone have free Fanta? Or is everyone just scared of him?”

No need for the chair. 

There’s no way to judge his intentions objectively. But we can say for certain he didn’t swing at anyone with the chair. I do think that part matters (at least, if he did swing his punishment would deservedly be more harsh).

I think calling for him to be kicked off the team is much too severe. A suspension is obviously warranted.

CollegeBasketball,ffafuet,t1_ffa3edt,1579734762.0,"Re: grabbing their player

It certainly seemed like most all other coaches involved adopted a similar approach (e.g. Bill Self grabbing two players by the collar, Coach Howard grabbing Silvio). 

To me, that simply makes sense. To grab an opposing player means you lay hands on someone who does not have a trusted relationship with you, and would potentially escalate the situation further. 

To attempt to get between two players in the midst of a brawl without making physical contact seems quite unrealistic as well. How would that work?

Certainly I have no scientific evidence of this, but my experience suggests that the majority of the time grabbing/holding back and calming their own players is the way coaches intervene in physical confrontations. This along with my interpretation of the video evidence is the basis for my assumption the coach was trying to grab his own player. I believe it to be quite reasonable. 

...

Do I believe it significantly contributed to Love being on the floor? Yes, I do. 

Can I say for certain Love was in a worse position after that? Not really. I mean, we may be able to agree that his action actually did create a great deal of space between Silvio and Love. It also pushed him back  towards a wall of fans, a security guard and a police officer that were actively working to deescalate the situation. 

Maybe if he didn’t do that, and Silvio and Love were in closer proximity for a few more seconds, Silvio would have been able to pick up and swing a chair at his head. Who knows?

On the second part: I acknowledge it is not a perfect or optimal problem solving solution (i.e. heuristic, exactly what I called it). I pose the question whether there is a viable alternative theory—is there? You offered maybe he was trying to grab someone from the other team.. did it look like that to you?

I’d agree with your last point: execution matters and good intentions don’t justify bad actions. 

I acknowledge he didn’t do a good job helping, but I also don’t think his actions made the situation much worse. I think it’s silly to home in on that issue."
CollegeBasketball,ff9oujy,t1_ff9lzyg,1579717555.0,Haha well we can certainly agree the dude was out of control.
CollegeBasketball,ff9klry,t1_ff9jarp,1579714984.0,"You’re right I’m making an assumption about his aiming to help. What is the harm in that assumption? Is there any viable alternative? 

Heuristics are an imperfect, but sometimes perfectly appropriate method to solving problems. In this case I lean on the idea that college coaches are mostly good people and care about the athletes. 

Call me crazy, but I still have little doubt that guy was trying to help by separating his team’s player from the fight."
CollegeBasketball,ff9j5i7,t3_ese6kc,1579714124.0,Thinking someone should be removed from the team over this is stupid imo.
CollegeBasketball,ff9iz9k,t1_ff9fu11,1579714020.0,"Ah, that’s exactly what this thread needs. More politics!"
CollegeBasketball,ff9itvx,t1_ff9epff,1579713931.0,"Eh... he was trying to help and grab his own player. It was a shit show. I don’t see anything wrong with his actions personally. 

I know our coaches got in the middle of it. Bill has hold of McCormack and Garrett by the collar. Coach Howard grabbed Silvio. Other coaches were involved—most trying to get in the middle. If one of them had accidentally fallen and pulled a player down in the process I would not have seen it poorly.

Now if a coach does anything to an opposing player.. my threshold for inappropriate action is probably very low."
CaregiverSupport,ff89lwf,t1_ff7zt9k,1579670072.0,"It hurts me to read all you’ve shared—I even creeped on your past posts because your other comment about children hit me hard. 

I don’t know a lot, but I know this is NOT your fault for asking for the laundry bag. Not that it means anything coming from me. Do you have anyone at all who checks on or cares for you?

I hate to hear that you feel your life is infinite suffering and that your life is over. You have meaning and purpose, more than most. But I don’t think you have the joy and recognition, and I’m sorry for that. It’s simply not fair. 

If you want or need a friend, I’m open to being a friend to you. You could text me if you want."
CollegeBasketball,ff88vid,t1_ff88g0w,1579669410.0,I can’t see clearly. Coach Howard certainly *tried*. So whatever that is worth.
CollegeBasketball,ff874st,t1_ff82rx2,1579667896.0,"I like WVU for what they bring to the court. It’s some tough ass basketball and it makes everyone in the league better for having to play them. 

The game threads do get toxic but it kinda mirrors the physicality of the game so it’s kinda fun still. But yeah the douchebags from both sides always show out in KU/WVU threads."
CollegeBasketball,ff85mum,t1_ff837iy,1579666653.0,"No one said they were equal..

You could definitely still fuck someone up with that garbage can btw (Not the way it was used). 

And if you are going to make such a fuss about the object in question.. he picked up a metal folding stool haha."
CollegeBasketball,ff84s3k,t3_es6k02,1579665980.0,Haha this didn’t make anything clearer to me but I appreciate the effort.
CollegeBasketball,ff830dq,t1_ff80wvz,1579664640.0,"Actually it appears to have been one of our coaches, Jerrance Howard (all time hilarious dude btw)."
CollegeBasketball,ff82102,t1_ff81c38,1579663920.0,"I agree with you, I just feel the chair detail will get overblown and overshadow a lot of the discussion about the brawl(maybe?). Whether that noise impacts the investigation and punishments.. I have no idea. But I can’t say I have a lot of faith that punishments will be fair across the board.

I didn’t see anything from anyone that would constitute being kicked off the team though."
CaregiverSupport,ff7za80,t1_ff7w0aw,1579661938.0,"Losing hope for children is just terrible. I remember we have gone back and forth. It was a battle to collect before treatment that would render my wife infertile. Almost didn’t make it. Then we successfully froze 2 embryos, so we felt like we have kids waiting for us. Then she had an early relapse post BMT, which leaves little hope for a cure. I’ve felt that loss more than once and I still have a fading glimmer of hope—her sister has said she would carry our embryos but I just don’t know. Will my wife even be around? Can I ask that of my SIL? So idk where I am with that now.

I’m sorry for your circumstances. It does matter how you are.. I hope you know that deep down. But I totally understand you might be saying that just to vent too."
CollegeBasketball,ff7ymw2,t1_ff7vp26,1579661483.0,"You’re right about that. I think last second dunk and my mind goes to EJ in 2013.

Brannen was 2016 and Barry Brown got revenge for that last year, which I completely respect bc he watched that happen as a freshman. Kinda cool to get payback on your way out."
CaregiverSupport,ff7yg09,t1_ff7y7ya,1579661348.0,Haha who said anything about free?!
CollegeBasketball,ff7ydpe,t1_ff7wt1y,1579661304.0,"u/moxthebox that guy was me. And I stand by it. 

You guys are not remembering things correctly! 

EJ made that dunk on ISU in 2013, not KSU. 

The incident you guys seem to want to remember was Brannen Greene’s dumbass in 2016. Idk what fans stand by that... bill even called it dumb as hell in the post game. Barry Brown got us back for it last year—he said he did it for revenge from the incident his freshman year (which I totally get)."
CollegeBasketball,ff7xzs2,t1_ff7w6c3,1579661037.0,It was Brannen Greene in 2016. Barry Brown got us back for it last year.. he said so explicitly in the post game.
CollegeBasketball,ff7xk9t,t1_ff7vfum,1579660738.0,"You’ve misremembered. 

Elijah dunked at Iowa State as time expired to score a total of 39pts. It was *his* game and I wouldn’t fault him much for that. You can think what you want about that. 

The one that was bad against KSU was Brannen Greene in 2016 when we beat you by like 18. 

Fans hardly defended it—even Self said it was some bullshit in the postgame. Barry Brown got us back for that last year. He even said it was in retaliation for what happened back in his freshman year."

CaregiverSupport,ff7vzkg,t1_ff7uafg,1579659671.0,"You’ve helped inspire me some. I want to go to a gym but I can’t because of exposure to first stuff and my wife is immunocompromised. But it’s also a convenient excuse because I’m sure I could do things at home. I feel like I need a trainer (and a therapist) to hold me accountable. I used to work out a lot with weights, but as I got older I transitioned to a lot more outdoors stuff and some boxing. Now I can’t do those things and I’m a bit at a loss. It’s hard to admit it’s my own lack of motivation.

My main activity now is just taking my dog out. We go 3 miles a day normally and some days we have time for a 5-6 mile hike. But that’s all I’m doing. I hadn’t considered extra risks of caregiver stress and that’s sort of a tough thing to come to terms with. How did you learn about that?"
CaregiverSupport,ff7v8zy,t1_ff7ulna,1579659168.0,"You’re right. Plus there is no way to know without trying. Thanks for the push. I’ll see what I can do. We are in ICU with the Flu now (ugh), but hopefully things will get better soon and I can focus on myself."
CollegeBasketball,ff7uvbe,t3_es54pn,1579658917.0,"I coulda maybe argued Silvio’s first punches were self defense...

CaregiverSupport,ff7toml,t1_ff7s774,1579658108.0,"Thank you for sharing with me. I especially appreciated your last point about the Friend’s who are scared to reach out. One of my best friends has barely talked to me since my wife’s diagnosis. I struggle with what that means, part of me thinking it’s what you described. But our friendship is a two way street and I should reach out to him as well.. sometimes I just don’t want to. Idk. I take days to respond to texts sometimes. 

Is there anything you like to do to blow off steam?"
CaregiverSupport,ff7t04r,t1_ff7qgnt,1579657634.0,"Haha I know what you mean about movie preference and book preference changing. Some stuff is just much harder to watch now. 

I have a question about therapy: if you only were able to go to a few sessions with one provider do you think there could be much value there? Or do you think it’s something that takes lots of time? I know there’s no right answer there... anyway I want to do it, but we may move for a clinical trial in the next couple months and I don’t want to start and quit something real quick like that."
CaregiverSupport,ff7sgna,t1_ff7qwom,1579657260.0,"From what I know, you’re not a bad son. I have had feelings like that before (“if you’re going to leave me, why not go ahead?”). And I feel that same guilt. 

Sometimes I feel better when I think about Sam’s speech to Frodo at the end of The Two Towers (forgive my nerdiness). Paraphrasing: the stories that are great are worth remembering *because* of all those moments where someone could have given in, or turned back. But they don’t because they believe it is something worth doing.

It sounds like you are doing something you think is worth doing. Even if it is a terrible struggle. 

Idk. I know how you feel and I’m sorry."
