depression,fg6qja1,t3_ex67l8,1580574580.0,"Sometimes when I start feeling a little better, I realize how scary life is. And hard. I realize that even without depression, there's a million miles left to go before I'm a well-adjusted person. And the road ahead is unfamiliar, it's uncertain and it's hard. 

I think depression allows me to effectively give up. To put myself on the sideline of life, and accept that I can't do all those things. Being blanketed in darkness that is familiar and safe, that I can hide in. When I'm depressed, I have nothing to lose, and no one can truly hurt me. It takes courage to leave it behind."

depression,fg6nu4r,t3_ex603f,1580572754.0,"Accept that there is no point, I guess. Accept that indeed your life is shit right now, but that this fact is inconsequential, per se. It does not warrant action, it just is what it is. 

Pray it gets better."
depression,fg6n4tg,t3_ex609q,1580572262.0,"I remember how much it sucked when I noticed I wasn't even in power of simple things like when to get up in the morning anymore. No matter how hard I tried, I just couldn't fix my sleep schedule.

I still struggle, but now I have a day job. So  I have to get up in the weekdays. Weekends are spent catching up on the lost sleep."

depression,fg6lt0j,t3_ews1jl,1580571321.0,1. I'm too tired. I literally can't afford another person the energy it takes to be with them. Just let me be.
