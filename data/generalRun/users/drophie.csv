dogs,ffhoyw3,t1_fffaawv,1579946159.0,"> The dogs that we separate him from, he will attempt to go back to bugging over, and over again, every time we go to the park. The owners that are good with us allowing a correction, he gets corrected a couple of times, and then learns to be cool and plays properly. 


The problem I have with this is how you’d handle submissive older dogs, basically. Back when I used to go to dog parks, I had endless issues with dogs like yours because my dog doesn’t give corrections. It’s not her thing, she doesn’t like doing it, and frankly it’s not really her responsibility since ideally every dog at a dog park has good manners already (they’re not intended for socialization). That obsessive chasing behavior is really freaking annoying and from this post it kind of sounds like you’re blaming it on the dog your dog is bothering, when in reality it’s your dog that’s behaving in a way that’s disruptive and not fair to the properly socialized dogs at the park. It sounds like you’re removing your dog from the other dog, which is good, but I’d consider if that’s truly the other owners problem or if your dog just needs some better training from his humans (like a solid leave if) before he’s allowed at the dog park again."
dogs,ffhoml0,t1_fff8w29,1579945628.0,"This is lovely, thank you for sharing. Anecdotally, I have an adult dog who actually gets incredibly stressed out by having to correct her asshole little brother - she’ll do it if he pushes her far enough, but at that point 1. the puppy should have stopped the behavior 10 minutes ago and 2. my older dog has been fretting over what she’s supposed to do for a while, so when she actually does correct him it’s way too late and not always proportional. Supervising and breaking up play may feel a little helicopter-y, but initially it’s super important to make sure that your dogs have a healthy play dynamic. It’ll ensure your older dog isn’t getting bullied and the younger one is behaving appropriately."
dogs,ff670ru,t3_erv5qp,1579620646.0,"We just got off three weekends in a row of showing, and Fizz picked up another major - he’s got 11 points and just needs 4 singles to get his championship. That being said, we came away from last weekend in particular with a LOT of work to do in the ring. For one thing, his behavior on the table during exam has progressively gotten worse and worse - he refuses to stack, leans to the side, sharks bait out of my hand, etc. It’s clearly anxiety, so I need to be more diligent about stacking him up and feeding him on all the surfaces. Additionally, we need to practice keeping his head up in the ring - he tends to forge ahead of me and try to put his head down. Again, training issue that I need to work on. His free stack is also kind of weak, but that’s a problem I’m actually going to solve in conjunction with the table issue - he hates being hand stacked and is much more natural and relaxed walking into a stack instead of me doing it. I’m going to try to shape a free stack on the table over the next month and a half. 

His next shows are at the Louisville cluster in March. We’ve got plenty to work on til then!"
dogs,ff2p20j,t3_er7hfz,1579517268.0,"I was paged for this thread - I have two well-bred Boston terriers, one that’s a super rad pet and one that I do conformation shows with. Both my dogs have flat faces - my older dog has about a half inch long muzzle and my younger one’s face is pretty much entirely flat. I have not had any significant issues with either dog. My older dog does dog sports and hikes with me regularly - my younger dog is a little young for sports just yet, but I plan on doing agility with him when he’s old enough. I do make sure they have access to water and try to keep them inside when it’s a million degrees, but otherwise it’s just like having any other dog. 

The key is to go to a responsible breeder who is appropriately screening their dogs for health problems associated with brachycephaly. For me, that meant going to someone who is cautious of nares width, is x-raying tracheas for hypoplasia, and is generally observing how her dogs are affected by their muzzles. The care my breeder put into her dogs shows: I was recently hanging out with a friend at her grooming shop, and many of her clients own poorly bred small white fluffy dogs. These dogs had muzzles much longer than my dog, but were pretty much universally struggling to breathe - obesity, soft palate problems, and other issues caused by irresponsible breeding and animal care cause these guys way more health problems than my flat faced dogs will likely ever have, because their breeders actually cared about making sure their dogs were healthy. While there’s not ZERO effects, both my dogs live happy, normal lives with no major health problems related to their respiratory system. 

If you’re interested in learning more, stop by a local dog show! The Boston terrier folks in the ring would be more than happy to talk to you about the breed and how they are working to breed the healthiest animals possible."

[Loans from pet stores are dressed up predatory lending](https://bailingoutbenji.com/buyer-beware-predatory-pet-leasing/), much like taking a payday loan, and you’ll end up with huge interest charges and balloon payments on a puppy that is prone to serious health problems. Do not pass go, do not buy a dog from a pet store that you can’t afford."

Do you live in the United States? Because here you don’t need to have any particular training to have an ESA. I have one and she’s well trained but very much just a pet. I just show a letter from my therapist to the airline when I fly, that’s pretty much it."
dogs,fernkgx,t1_feni5f7,1579356157.0,The Instagram service dog community is a wealth of bad training methods. Dogs being used in place of mobility aids is my big pet peeve - you’ll see Goldens and Labs who are basically still puppies at 8-10 months old being used in place of a cane or walker for a fully grown adult. Then these puppies wash because of orthopedic issues and handlers wonder why! Even a fully grown Lab or Golden is going to be borderline for mobility work because they’re on the small side.
dogs,femzpic,t1_femyez4,1579273693.0,"If your dog needs 2-3 hours per day of structured exercise as a small companion, it’s either an extreme outlier or you haven’t adequately taught a settle. That is not at all normal.

What about Boston Terriers? I have two and while I understand the hesitance towards short nosed breeds, the extra precautions are really minimal and my dogs really don’t struggle at all (both of them are well bred dogs). If it’s insurance you’re worried about, I have insurance on both my dogs through Healthy Paws and congenital issues are covered including issues related to brachycephaly. Otherwise, they fit your bill well - quiet, usually fine around cats, up for walks but aren’t going to kill you for exercise, cuddly, very biddable and trainable, and generally just fun little dogs to live with."
dogs,felcah6,t1_fekpm8m,1579218814.0,"The entire metro area has similar laws and comprises 50 percent of the population of the state, so about half the state is affected by  that sort of law.

My point was more that this kind of thing does happen and when it’s in major metro areas, it affects the culture of pet ownership in the area. Colorado is rabidly adopt don’t shop and when high concentration areas perpetuate that, absolutely does have a statewide affect. See [this state law](https://leg.colorado.gov/sites/default/files/documents/2020A/bills/2020a_1084_01.pdf) that was introduced last week, which sounds great on the surface but would actually cause some serious problems for breeders if it goes into effect.
