infertility,ffilhmq,t1_ffiiqn1,1579976725.0,"My cousin had one recently for her 3rd kid. I was ""out of town"" that day with plans I'd already made. 

I spent the day shopping and hanging out with my husband instead. Going wasn't worth the emotional wreck it would have been for me. My cousin wouldn't have been there if the roles were reversed, so that's how I justified it.

I don't blame you for not wanting to go to another one ever again. I won't either."
JUSTNOMIL,ffikvw1,t1_ffi2qhl,1579976311.0,"This isn't necessarily true. IUI is often used for same sex couples, and many use a sperm donor. IVF is typically only used if there are difficulties, regardless of whether it's a same sex relationship or not."
infertility,ffgluao,t1_ffglo0i,1579909232.0,"I, personally, would just do IVF then. It's more money, but the chances of success are much higher."
infertility,ffghx7j,t3_eti0ti,1579906624.0,"I think it depends on your circumstances. My insurance covers treatment, but we basically HAD to do IUI first to try less invasive/cheaper options first since all of our results are normal and we are in the unexplained category. Now that IUI hasn't worked, we will be doing IVF. I felt like IUI was more of a formality since we had a cumulative 30% chance of it working over 3 rounds.

If you don't have to worry about insurance, I'd go for IVF. You could try 1 round of IUI if you wanted to. I don't believe it's expensive, at least at my clinic, because they don't do daily ultrasounds, injectables, etc. It's like $300 or so total per try because we just had Letrozole and then I came in the day after a positive OPK. 

I think it comes down to money and how patient you are. I'd find out the costs at the clinic you'd be using for both IVF and IUI and decide from there."
QuadCities,fffag3p,t3_et9u6j,1579879634.0,"I haven't had an experience like this, but I've been less than thrilled with their customer service. They're always short staffed when I would go in (mostly on weekends, and there were maybe 2 people working even though it's always busy). 

I suggested once on their Facebook page that they maybe have another person or two at the Milan location so the employees aren't so stressed and so there isn't a line out the door. They responded telling me that I should just do everything online...which isn't always possible depending on the situation.

I left my account open, but I switched banks. It's not the worst place ever, but my current bank is much better and more helpful."
QuadCities,ff66qp5,t3_erkmt2,1579620462.0,"Charlie's Tax Service is pretty awesome. It's out in the country between Reynolds and Taylor Ridge, IL. They've always done a great job and aren't expensive."
QuadCities,feksqdr,t1_fekrhul,1579206820.0,"He's just filling in from what I've heard. They're short a weather person since Cedric left, so I think Ryan is helping with vacations and relief for the others having to work extra."
offmychest,feknwhp,t3_epj0b1,1579203968.0,"I have always been this ""friend."" It's gotten a bit better now that I have some better friends, but I still find it happening more than I'd like. I think it's more my personality than anything.

I had some pretty crappy friends all through school that used me and treated me badly. I constantly was left out of stuff that everyone else was invited to, etc. It took a huge toll on my self esteem that I'm not sure I'll ever fully get over."
QuadCities,fek7pth,t1_fek2c2i,1579194351.0,"They said something about ""on a programming note"" but I don't remember if their wording said he was no longer on air or no longer with the station."
QuadCities,fek7k0u,t3_epk2nd,1579194253.0,"I don't know specifically about Matt, but nothing would surprise me with KWQC. 

They're very inconsistent with what happens when people leave. For some, there is a big party, social media post, etc. For others, it's a two sentence email to the staff and a very general statement otherwise (seems to be the case here). There's never a rhyme or reason as far as whether it's someone quitting/getting fired or leaving on good terms or not. 

My best educated guess based on what it was like when I was there is that he left or got let go and KWQC is trying to be under the radar about it.

I hope the person that said he's still there and just producing is correct though! I'm basing all of this off of how it was when I worked there a few years ago and how I saw them treat myself and others."
stilltrying,fehtka8,t3_ep1897,1579123592.0,"I didn't have to do injections or anything with mine, and you already have some great advice about all of that! The only thing I'd add is that they told me to come for the IUI with a full bladder. Between that and being so close to ovulating, it was extremely uncomfortable. I was afraid I'd pee on the nurse doing the procedure.

You have to wait for them to come in, talk to you, do the procedure (which doesn't take too long) and then I also had to lay for 10 minutes before getting up...all while really needing to pee.

They did tell me it's harder for the person doing the procedure to know if they're in the right spots if your bladder isn't full though. So chug some water the hour or so before the procedure."
TryingForABaby,fdw52zd,t1_fdtbmh1,1578755165.0,"Ugh. I'm sorry. I try to tell myself that they mean well and just don't know what to say, but it is a total let down, isn't it?  Maybe she will come around and be supportive for you still."
Choices,fds52qg,t1_fds4lwn,1578694534.0,"Nope! You're fine! I realize that the topic probably doesn't bother anyone else. I don't hate PB for it, but it is frustrating to me that they wasted resources on a book like this rather than other ideas (or sequels that people want like for Hero)."
Choices,fds3d2c,t3_emxhby,1578693696.0,"I mean, I just hate it (and refuse to play it) because I think the whole storyline is stupid and insensitive. I'm infertile and have been trying for 3years to have a baby. The last thing I want to do is play this book. But it seems like everyyyyy time I open the app, I'm greeted with this book on the header with a huge graphic of a pregnant person.

I guess maybe that's irrational too, but I just think there are so many better topics they could have picked rather than making this like an episode of Maury."
trollingforababy,fds2s4k,t1_fdrrhka,1578693494.0,Reddit literally suggested a group similar to this one except for pregnancy based on me being part of this sub. I was sooooo annoyed. I am NOT the target market for that bullshit. Some of these companies need to reexamine their algorithms.

AskRedditAfterDark,fdrmbyc,t3_emuhxq,1578686522.0,"I mean, I've been trying for 3 years to get pregnant, so not afraid here. Plus, it's better without a condom. If only I'd known I was infertile years ago, I could have saved lots of money on condoms though."
AmItheAsshole,fdrks9v,t1_fdqz83q,1578685878.0,"I feel the same, and I'm severely hearing impaired! I wish I'd thought if this idea myself, to be honest."

TryingForABaby,fdrcpv8,t1_fdrbty4,1578682551.0,"Mine is super aware of everything too. I take the good with the bad though. I know she wants the best for me, and she's always asking for updates and even gave us some money that we can use for treatments.  I'm glad yours is being good though!

Maybe it's because I'm over it all and just done with being nice, but I've started being less nice when people say insensitive things. I'm not rude, but I'll be direct and I won't just laugh it off, especially if they're habitual offenders. At this point, it's no secret to anyone that we are struggling to have a baby, and I have no patience for insensitive comments. I feel like if they care so little about my feelings to say something dismissive or dumb, then I don't care if I make them slightly uncomfortable... especially if it will make them think twice next time."
TryingForABaby,fdqy9a6,t3_emtewd,1578676641.0,"Yes. I see it happen a LOT. it's like they forget it ever happened.

My mom had some difficulties with fertility -- multiple miscarriages, me, and then a stillborn. She did all of this through medicated cycles, but it still took lots of time. I thought she would be sympathetic.

Now, she is supportive in her own way too, but also finds a chance to let me know about every person she hears about who is pregnant or had a baby (think random Facebook posts of people we barely know). She also bingo'd me 3 times in one conversation when I called her after my first appointment with an RE after 2 and a half years of trying. 

I'm not sure what it is, but people just seem to forget how much it sucked once they have kids."
trollingforababy,fdo0ywl,t3_em9075,1578596872.0,"Ugh. Maybe I'm just bitter, but I have an issue with people that identify first and foremost as a mom. It's like they lose ALL other identity of themselves. On Facebook, even in groups that aren't technically for just mothers, half the posts starts with ""fellow Mama's..."" and then I'm out."
infertility,fdnfvb8,t3_em77js,1578584927.0,"I usually don't even attend baby showers, much less host them. I'd just give a vague response about not having the time to take on such a commitment. And then make sure you are ""out of town"" or ""busy with work"" or something the day of the shower.

I threw one for my best friend early on (it had been a bit over a year of trying, and she started trying at the same time as us and was successful pretty much immediately). It sucked enough then. There is no way I could do it now after 3 years."
confession,fdnbtoa,t1_fdm87fw,1578582403.0,"Same.

I was obsessed for years with them. Now, at 28, I'm still dead set on meeting Billy at a Comic Con sometime and getting some of his artwork. My 13 year old self would be so excited if I ever make that happen."
infertility,fdkct4d,t1_fdjpy96,1578501156.0,"My OB sort of had a ""one size fits all"" method of treatment for oral meds. She was convinced I wasn't ovulating at all because she always had me do my blood work on CD21, but I don't ovulate on CD14 (I'm later too).

My OB is a fantastic OB, but it was super frustrating. She led me to believe I had PCOS, wasn't ovulating on my own, etc. Turns out I was ovulating the whole time.

My point is that you might want to consider an RE to get more specialized treatment if you don't feel your OB is listening to you and isn't taking it as seriously as you'd like. I wish I'd gone to one sooner. 

Also, I've been on both Clomid and Letrozole, and I've never heard of needing to get used to them to ovulate. If I didn't ovulate as strongly as they liked, my dosage was always increased the next cycle."
infertility,fdkc27c,t3_elqul3,1578500707.0,"Just had my progesterone blood draw last night for my final IUI. Thanks to a fantastic friend, I'm prepared for what is next with IVF (she's currently just a bit farther ahead in the process since she slipped doing any IUI treatments).

I'm ready to get a move on it. My appointment with my RE isn't for a month yet, so I'm going to need to find a way to pass the time. Feeling like I'm not doing anything productive makes me feel crazy."
callcentres,fdhee9f,t3_eldk2d,1578420879.0,"I had a client have my look up her kids to make a payment. First one is Stormy. Okay, I've seen that before. Next one is Rainy, and the third was Cloudy (or something similar and weather related). Not sure how I kept a straight face to be honest."

TryingForABaby,fdhc6u9,t3_ela6z8,1578419770.0,"February marks three years for me. It sucks. When we met, my husband had said he wanted to be a dad by thirty (obviously before we knew we'd have any issues). He turns 30 in March, and that also makes me feel like a failure. We are unexplained, but I suspect Endo.

Just know you aren't alone. I hate the milemarkers like this too."

They are aware that I'm hearing impaired. It's definitely not anything I've ever hidden, and I did have to move desk spaces when I first started because those around me were loud speakers and it was hard. My boss asked if they would work after testing them during one call, and since that call was okay, I said sure. But I've found it REALLY depends on who is on the other line. I think I screwed myself by saying it was okay at first though."
