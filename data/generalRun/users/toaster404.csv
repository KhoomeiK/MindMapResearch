cycling,feo8ntg,t3_eq4ipo,1579296654.0,"So much depends on the specific environment.  In my area, northern Virginia USA, I will not ride on many of the roads, and generally take rather sheltered routes.  Including stretches of root strewn single track, sporting on a fixed gear track bike.  But I must go through various urban settings.  Each has its challenges.  In Old Town Alexandria I usually take the lane, stop at stop signs, and seize control of the situation through generous use of hand signals, direction signals to other vehicles, and clear decisive positioning on the road.  I know escape paths from my most used routes, so I can dump a following jerk if I need to.  My cross bike will handle cobblestones better than a car!

In the more modern Crystal City area, I have to be much more submissive. Speeds exceed what I can sustain, and the longer sight lines and less frequent stops make it easy for drivers to overlook a bicycle.  So in spite of fewer stops, I am less able to maintain a relaxed pace.  Arlington has an excellent bike system, but still seems somewhat baffling to motorists.  Is clear that Arlington is not encouraging additional car traffic.  DC itself varies from easy and excellent to terrifying, and clearly takes specific local knowledge. 

It is all better than southside Chicago!

worldnews,fe83qdh,t1_fe7xrtf,1578922174.0,"This seems a bit much of a stretch.  Was the loss of of an airliner the reasonably foreseeable result of the assassination of a foreign general?  Just a bit too distant.  What is that case? Paltsgraf?  Something like that.  The fireworks at train station.  

Tension has been rising and falling over the years because of general western Persian conflict.  It goes back and forth.  That is the water Iran swims in. Think Xerxes.  Darius.  Onwards.  Into this setting, Persia introduces a fairly modern missile system with the usual safeguards.  But their civilian and military command and control systems are knowingly marginal at best.  That looks like negligence to me. Add poor training.  That sets up the local context. 

On the transport side, airlines have the responsibility to keep their passengers safe.  Civilian airliners broadcast who and what they are, have distinct transponder responses. There's also the IFF system for identifying aircraft as hostile or not. 

During one of many periods of heightened tension, the Ukranian plane takes off. Neither the airline company nor the Iranian civil aviation authorities had any business letting that occur given the inadequacies of the air defence network.  Yahoos with dangerous toys.  

That's another part of the context. 

As to the dvent itself, the air defense network had duties to track what non military aircraft to expect.  The listen for identifying signatures of aircraft. To use the IFF system.  To have suitable launch safeguards in place, including avoiding giving sole launch authority to a relatively low level individual.  

While adhering to a higher standard and using all these safeties doesnt assure no shootdowns, not adhering makes the risk incredibly higher. 

Even in the KAL 007 shootdown, higher authorities were consulted and it was a deliberate process.  

I put most blame on Iraq, one can argue about partitioning that blame, but some on the airline for flying in that context.  

Maybe a tiny whisper to the US, but I cant sed anyone in US military or government contemplating that all the systems to stop folks from shooting down airliners would fail, especially after the expensive lessons of MH17 and the Vincennes shootdown."

RedditForGrownups,fd64135,t1_fd5xj6r,1578185227.0,My mother's rosey memories do not match mine. Nor her recollection of the tension and conflict she and I were exposed to. I remember beauty and terror.

violinmaking,fd35pnr,t3_ei1ea8,1578154982.0,"I will evaluate and compare to what I use. The Strad forms have the rib height on them, about 32 mm. That is historically the Cremonese inch.  I have a ruler with that. Cut ribs to 1 inch wide. Lay out top and back to be on 1/2 inch centers. End up with a violin 2 inches thick, less saw kerf. Which is what we see.

I use circles and ratios, too. Am about to lay out a scroll. I will photograph and post, compare to this. 

On train, cannot do now."
todayilearned,fd32nkq,t1_fd1eip6,1578154210.0,"Structuring the materials in nested outline form. I was working on the material all the time, and jumped at every opportunity to speak. This was early in weird processing, so I had to be frugal.  

I also highlighted and contoured the material in the outline as I would a musical score. Imagined just hitting the high points.  Ran through those a few times before every talk.  

Another element tied to having a hierarchy of importance and clear organization was just providing enough information in a framed discussion.  I aimed to talk for 12 minutes of a 20 minute slot. Carefully, and with pacing.  Then a similar treatment of questions. I never learned much talking, so I like lots of space for listening."

An opera singer I spent some time with said he felt he really didn't know the libretto well unless he could be woken up at 2 am, dropped into the opera at any point, and instantly pick up without a flaw.

When I used to give talks on more or less the same subject regularly, I would outline several different versions for different purposes and lengths.  I eventually developed a standard format for making that body of talk possibilities.  Came in very handy.  For example, I gave a course on the spur of the moment for 4 hours on several related subjects I'd given talks on.  With no specific preparation.  Even I was surprised.  And I had 10 minutes notice that I had 5 minutes with a VP in a mega corporation.  I used 3.  Contract resulting was in 5 figures.  

Lots of power in having your act together on material and presentation.  Lots of time in developing that act!!"
