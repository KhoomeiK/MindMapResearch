Even if each member of this Jewish slaveholding elite had owned 714 slavesâ€”a ridiculously high figure in the American Southâ€”the total number would only equal the 100,000 slaves owned by Black and colored planters in St. Domingue in 1789, on the eve of the Haitian Revolution.â€

No idea. But given the choice to lock people up for something they haven't done isn't very just.

Same way as you give anyone therapy for a mental illness. Though the specialist is a good point. I have no idea 


I don't have the answers. All I know is that if you threaten to lock people up for some trait of theirs, they're going to hide that trait.
