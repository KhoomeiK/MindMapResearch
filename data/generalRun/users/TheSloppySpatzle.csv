Talented dancers and novel performances are pure entertainment in themselves, and the women are great at conversation and can tell you some wild stories. People who go to clubs just to get unfulfillingly horny are missing the mark. Obviously you’ll probably get turned on, but a quality club should offer more than blueballs. 


Bonus anecdote. I went to a club in Portland where they had a “stripper karaoke” - you’d have to maintain your composure singing a song while the dancers show off their skills and may mess with you to try and throw you off."

TheHighChef,ffpoxkh,t1_ffpoafk,1580100742.0,"The product photos are mostly photoshopped oil into empty carts or hue-adjusted with a color overlay - something nearly every company does due to there being no legal restrictions on that - so that tells me nothing about the carts you buy. 

There is a very wide variation of colors oil can present itself in, depending on strain, extraction, and concentration. I’ve seen a broad spectrum in multiple states with legal medical and recreational programs. 

This hue is completely normal and I found it typical of CO2 extraction carts, especially when 60% THC or below, and especially if there’s a cutting agent such as MCT, which seems to speed up oxidation. Higher THC carts also tend to run clearer due to less room for tannins and chlorophyll, but they still darken with regular use - even if not even halfway through a cart, at times - to a deeper amber hue.  

Anyways, OP you have nothing to worry about with this color. Clear does not equal pure, just make sure you’re purchasing from reliable sources - ideally the legal market with third-party lab tests to clear out molds, pesticides, and heavy metals - and you’re fine! That’s all from me about the normalcy of color."

TheHighChef,ffpnrtw,t1_ffplxg9,1580099766.0,"Color has nothing to do with the purity or overall quality of cannabis oil vape carts. Oil naturally darkens when exposed to repeated heat or stored in a warm environment because of lack of preservatives. As long as it’s not kept in direct sunlight and the coils aren’t repeatedly overheated (could alter taste) it’s fine. I’ve managed at 3 dispensaries & visited many nationwide and this is normal, especially if you have oils that are less than 90% THC concentration."
DisneyWorld,ffpmrmm,t3_euh88w,1580098957.0,"The first half of the inversion is immediate, 4 seconds in or so, in pitch-black dark - and you honestly can’t tell you’re upside-down until the lights of the sign at the bottom of the inversion glow to give you perspective of where you are. It’s a big loop. The second is a heartline corkscrew, which means the track twists but doesn’t loop - it feels like doing a cartwheel in one place. 

My little sister had her eyes closed her entire first ride and never knew it inverted twice until I told her. They’re very smooth inversions and they do not feel like drops - you will have so much fun. I’ve ridden R&R with *so many* coaster-nervous people, including my sister, who ended up laughing the whole ride and wanting to go right back on as soon as it was finished."

Seriously. I’ve seen firsthand with family & friends and read endless stories of those who “compromised” by having children when they didn’t want them but their partner did. Do you know what the end result is? 90% of the time, an unhappy couple, a burnt-out reluctant parent, and a child who is smart enough to know they were not wanted. 

To sound harsh, rarely does “maternal instinct” take over for someone who is steadfast on not having children. OP, don’t get carried away by people’s feelgood stories of “Well it turns out once I actually had my own child they became the most important thing to me and I am so fulfilled!” you will see around when you’re questioning going with his whims but really don’t want children. That success is the exception, not the rule."
