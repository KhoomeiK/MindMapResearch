noita,ffmrmx2,t3_ethpba,1580058222.0,It looks like the falling lantern might have been what set it off.  This is why I put a high priority on the explosion immunity perk.
noita,ffmnnf8,t1_ffln2bx,1580057003.0,for me it's about 20 seconds.  It depends on the memory budget you give it.
noita,ffmnd28,t1_ffm7u59,1580056893.0,"That's what I did in desperation once.  I had to get past a crap-ton of enemies while I was on my last few HP, so I kept jumping into the morph juice until I changed into the phantom worm.  I almost ended up like you.

mildlyinteresting,ffhgp2t,t1_ffheuns,1579934470.0,What a coincidence.  How ironic.
CrappyDesign,ffgzql4,t1_ffgkuaq,1579919257.0,If this was China it would most likely be spelled Ocuppied and Onucupied.
Skookum,ffgz982,t1_ffgtgzs,1579918896.0,"It's aisle, btw.  Isle is another word for island."
Skookum,ffgz3k9,t1_ffg1pbv,1579918777.0,">Misumi catalog

Ooooooooh, not bad at all."
Showerthoughts,ffgyb6d,t1_fff9xrs,1579918190.0,"Yeah, people use it that way.  It bugged me at first, but then I realized that kind of thing happens with language over time.  It's not a terrible word, after all.  Not like eargasm, or manspreading."
nottheonion,fff6tlq,t1_ffenuls,1579877184.0,Turns out I just get paid less for doing the same amount of work in less time and end up saving a lot less. Yay.
SmashBrosUltimate,fff5py2,t1_ffews9f,1579876382.0,*Magnesium* chloride
Showerthoughts,fff4y2s,t1_fff4h6e,1579875811.0,"Yes, as well as boughten.  They are a part of the dialect in certain places in America."
AskReddit,ffc3dbn,t1_ffbetqy,1579790535.0,"I upvoted your comment, so I think I'm entitled to at least 2k.  PM me.  Just kidding,  invest responsibly and keep people honest by not tempting them. Ignorance is bliss in this case."
prusa3d,ffb5fb9,t1_ffa95cs,1579752272.0,Also using the powder coated sheet makes it really easy to get PETG parts off.
WanderingInn,ffas2q8,t3_esf118,1579743176.0,I'm just hoping someone can make a hang-glider and show that guy in Pallass what's up.
WanderingInn,ffarhu7,t1_ff8sbcs,1579742790.0,"It seems like it's not hot, otherwise wouldn't it burn her? Or maybe it's like Ceria and her ice? I think it will end up being a mystical and abstract power rather than a damaging one."
WanderingInn,ffar0ry,t1_ff8wbqx,1579742467.0,"Well, remember her Kamehameha joke? Pretty sure she actually got it after all (jk)."
WanderingInn,ffaqv2y,t1_ff8xe52,1579742360.0,"Yeah, and I thought there was some agreement earlier to not steal business from the runners guild? Maybe that went away at some point."
WanderingInn,ffaqmrq,t1_ffa7jjq,1579742205.0,Maybe that's just coincidentally what they call magical death rays like the one Magnolia used.
WanderingInn,ffaq9y9,t1_ffagenv,1579741968.0,Just be glad you didn't take a few more years to discover it. You might have died. I'll admit to being a bit sleep deprived a few times while working my way through it.
videos,ff5fh3w,t1_ff57r4y,1579590579.0,"It's the same way with a lot of groups, i.e. cults."
WanderingInn,ff1dqop,t1_ff0aq6b,1579477869.0,"Yeah, I recall video games that had a protection event like that which were many times more difficult than other tasks."
prusa3d,ff0xagp,t1_fezqfbo,1579473197.0,"If you put it on stealth mode, it will be a lot quieter.  I always run on that setting."
prusa3d,fezdy8l,t1_fezbbtm,1579456358.0,"I did that same print in the same way after I built mine, but it didn't have that issue at all.  Strange.  Did you change anything while it was printing?"
prusa3d,fezde53,t1_fexngyw,1579456186.0,I think that was all I ate during the ten hours it took me to build mine.  It was a very good thing he included them.
EngineeringPorn,fezat72,t3_eqvyio,1579455460.0,Polished marble? Pshaw.  Who wants to eat off of that?  All of my overly complex transforming tables are mahogany inlaid with gold.
minnesota,feplxnq,t1_feozbpt,1579323980.0,"Broskies, maybe?"
ExposurePorn,feplb41,t3_eq65i8,1579323496.0,Thanks for uploading such a large version of this.  It's a very inspiring image.  I'm going to need to get out with my new tripod to do some long exposures soon.
Xcom,fep3tf0,t1_fep3gtu,1579311512.0,"A double negative doesn't not mean positive.  See? It's just easier to use one positive instead of two negatives, unless there is some reason to use double negatives, like implying that you mean a third option that is not stated.  Which I couldn't see in their comment."
OnePunchMan,fep1rx2,t3_eq4yfk,1579310211.0,Isn't it overgrown?
Amd,fep1c7w,t1_femkmo3,1579309936.0,Or a refurbished one.  Good as new for half the price.
Xcom,feowl6b,t1_feobuy4,1579306963.0,"You can't say you won't?  Why the double negatives?  Just your style, or is there some added meaning here I'm not seeing?"
