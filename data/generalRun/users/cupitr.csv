leafs,ffijvn0,t1_ffiifhe,1579975613.0," Uniform numbers in professional hockey date back to the old National  Hockey Association, one of the leagues that pre-date the NHL. The  original intention was to help fans identify players and to help  officials to credit statistics. An added benefit was that they could  generate revenue selling programs that listed the players by number.  This continued until the 1977-78 season, when the NHL began requiring  nameplates added to the uniforms. A revision to this rule was required  shortly thereafter when the notoriously cheap Harold Ballard, owner of  the Toronto Maple Leafs, begrudgingly complied by adding the nameplates  in the same color as the uniform. He didn’t want to lose the program  sales, so the NHL had to be specific that the nameplate was to be in a  contrasting color.
