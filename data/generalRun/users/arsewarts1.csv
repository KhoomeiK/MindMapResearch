I am not claiming to know the perfect answer but I think a middle ground between paying a singular fee and a subscription should be on the table. Almost a buy out model.

BrandNewSentence,fgmddfw,t3_ez3jt9,1580922392.0,"At one point a felony was a designation of crime so bad you gave up your basic human rights that included voting. A misdemeanor and other lower level designations were used for a bulk of the crimes. But since the 60s the national government (specifically the executive and legislative branches) have been in a lock to steal as much power as possible. This produced MANY unnecessary legislative and over site organization but also extended the concept of a felony taking in new crimes of less seriousness as the federal government desperately grabbed for more power. 

The concept of taking away rights or disenfranchisement dates back to early English law and can be found in the Constitution and Magna Carta. It’s not intended to “keep criminals down” but to be reserved for a small fraction of seriously terrible crimes.
