netflix,fdc781n,t3_ekbdbr,1578268462.0,"I liked the show despite many plot holes. 

For instance, the people following Al Masih trying to enter from Syria to Israel.  They try to get in through a hole (not a plot hole - a real one) in the fence and soldiers show up to block them.  2 weeks later, instead of patching up the hole and calling it a day,  Israel is keeping a military battalion in front of the hole. That is just dumb.

Another hole was that the suicide bomber was able to easily make it (with all the explosives and a suspicious looking handler) from Jordan to the West Bank mosque where he blew everyone up.  From what I understand, the only way to cross is through the Allenby bridge over the river Jordan - and it's heavily militarized.  

Yet another one is that Jesus shows up to demand that US withdraw it's troops from everywhere and that will usher 1000 years of peace.  That's just lazy writing.

Also, apparently deities love Adidas track suits.

Are you just straight up stupid?  The article you linked is talking about the war between Israel and Gaza.  Gaza is a separate entity.  No one is occupying is them.  There isn't a single Israeli there (except for the hostages they are holding).  They have been shelling Israel for the last 15 years - that's why you have occasional wars when Israel gets sick and tired of Gaza bullshit.  

> I was referring to the holocausts, which took place 75 years ago, not an ongoing genocide

Now you are just up lying.  You stated: ""what is happening in Israel today can probably be classified as genocide"".  

> Israel claimed, without providing any evidence, that it was a missile site, and proactively attacked it. Not defensively. 

Exactly what evidence would be acceptable for you?  I would really like to hear an answer to this.

> How can you trust anything the Government of Israel says...

See...that's where you go from ""I am criticizing Israel"" to ""I am criticizing Israel, because I hate them"".  And that is because you choose to ignore pretty much all available evidence.  

Human Rights Watch (a notoriously anti-Israel organization) [stated](https://www.hrw.org/report/2007/06/30/indiscriminate-fire/palestinian-rocket-attacks-israel-and-israeli-artillery): ""Palestinian armed groups also at times endanger civilians by placing their rocket launchers near residential areas in Gaza"".  This is common knowledge and has been happening since the beginning - but not to you apparently.  Hamas themselves [says](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2014/09/hamas-quietly-admits-it-fired-rockets-from-civilian-areas/380149/) so - apparently that's one thing that they agree with Israel about. [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2014/07/31/why-hamas-stores-its-weapons-inside-hospitals-mosques-and-schools/) explains why Hamas stores ammunition and rocket launchers in mosques, hospitals, etc...  UN itself [found](https://www.unrwa.org/newsroom/press-releases/unrwa-condemns-placement-rockets-second-time-one-its-schools) that Hamas stored rockets in one of its schools.  Not once, but even second time after it was caught the first time.  Or is that doesn't convince you - here is some [live footage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE3feo_b8Cg) of rocket launchers in a civilian neighborhood.
