You're pretty close. My stance would be: ""The State does not allow  religious exceptions, period.""  (certain forms of this approach might be in discussions in Trenton).  

What I read in the bill (which I had issue with) was the State could accept some religious exceptions, but exclude others based on written statements of practitioners, clergy, etc.  I have a feeling the latter may be struck because it is too easy for the ACLU to bring up an ironclad court case.  However, if they just say 'no vax, no Public School,' while rights of privacy could be brought up, said Religious Rights are not violated per se, so long as Private & Home Schools are equally offered in the State. 

Broadly (beyond this issue), I take a classical Libertarian approach to US Law: where Citizens' Rights are defined in the Constitution and scoped and/or limited through SCOTUS and Federal Statute and Code. 

The rest is retained by the States and the Citizens.  While the State's offer certain rights, they typically offer Privileges (like Public School, Marriage / Driver's Licenses, Mass Transit, etc.)  

So for me, whenever I hear a State potentially peering into a Citizen's Right, I typically become cautious and look at the fine print."
newjersey,fdyb80y,t1_fdw1g0q,1578777962.0,"1 / 3.  I see potential problems with the below, IF it goes through as documented in the Bill’s summary (relevant language listed & linked below).  I see a situation where a parent seeking an exception claims they practice ___ religion and then the State could be allowed to say that said faith does not uphold said doctrine regarding Vax.  In my eyes, the State has NO RIGHT to interpret a Citizen’s religion.  The State CAN, however, determine what is Legal or Not.  

For example: The State can legally refuse issue Polygamous marriage certificates (as Marriage is a Privilege, Religion is a Constitutional Right).  However, the State cannot argue that they won’t issue the Polygamous License because Mormonism, etc. does (or does not) support Polygamy because of x, y, z.

In essence, I believe the interpretation of Religion is a Citizen’s Right.  Where I stray with the NJ anti-Vaxers, is that I see Public School as a PRIVILEGE (and NOT a RIGHT).  Thus, the State can make laws as applicable regarding who may attend its Public Schools.

Regarding #2, I’m not too clear on how NJ School system works.  My municipal statement was a suggestion but certainly may not be pragmatic (and in some cases might be addressed in the amended Bill) so take with a grain of salt.

From NJ A3818 Summary… “The bill requires the documentation for a religious exemption to specifically … an explanation of the nature of the person's religious tenet or practice that is implicated by the vaccination, and how administration of the vaccine would violate, contradict, or otherwise be inconsistent with that tenet or practice; -- information that indicates that the religious tenet or practice is consistently held by the person, which may include, but need not be limited to, expression of the person's intent to decline any vaccination; -- a statement that the religious tenet or practice is not solely an expression of that person's political, sociological, philosophical, or moral views, or the person's concerns related to the safety or efficacy of the vaccination”"

If the Citizen's seek pro-Vax, I believe they should leave it up to the municipalities (no vax? No public school) and leave Religion out of it.

The straws USA sells should end up in landfills or burnt in co-generation plants.  https://www.epa.gov/ocean-dumping/learn-about-ocean-dumping"

newjersey,fdhe1bj,t3_elbuoh,1578420690.0,"Vax-aside, the language in this Bill is concerning because it grants NJ the ability to make determinations about a Citizen's religion based on frequency of practice and/or moral views (actual language below).

I believe this is giving the State to much rights that, if passed, can be used as precedent towards other areas.  Instead, NJ should just write a law that allows Public Schools the right to refuse Students who have not been vaxed and leave religion out of it.

""This bill clarifies the State policy governing exemptions from mandatory student immunizations. Under the bill, provisions in the State Sanitary Code, or provisions otherwise set forth in statute or regulation, which require the immunization of students at a preschool program, an elementary or secondary school, or an institution of higher education, are to provide for an exemption from such mandatory immunization based on medical or religious reasons. In the case of a medical exemption, the bill requires a written statement submitted to the school by a physician, doctor of osteopathy, advanced practice nurse, or physician assistant that indicates: (1) the vaccine is medically contraindicated for a specific period of time; and (2) the reasons for the medical contraindication, which are to be based on a valid medical reason as determined by the Commissioner of Health (Commissioner) by regulation. The student will be exempt from the immunization requirement for the period of time indicated in the written statement. In the case of a religious exemption, the bill requires the student or the student's parent or guardian, if the student is a minor, to submit documentation explaining how the administration of the vaccine conflicts with the bona fide religious tenets or practices of the student, parent, or guardian. A religious exemption may not be based on general philosophical or moral objections, and a religious exemption may suspended by the Commissioner during an emergency as determined by the Commissioner. The bill requires the documentation for a religious exemption to specifically include a signed, notarized, and sworn written statement that includes: -- an explanation of the nature of the person's religious tenet or practice that is implicated by the vaccination, and how administration of the vaccine would violate, contradict, or otherwise be inconsistent with that tenet or practice; -- information that indicates that the religious tenet or practice is consistently held by the person, which may include, but need not be limited to, expression of the person's intent to decline any vaccination; -- a statement that the religious tenet or practice is not solely an expression of that person's political, sociological, philosophical, or moral views, or the person's concerns related to the safety or efficacy of the vaccination; and -- a statement that the person understands the risks and benefits of vaccination to the student and the public health, and acknowledges that the student may be excluded from attendance at the student's preschool, elementary or secondary school, or institution of higher education, as applicable, in the event of a threat or occurrence of a communicable disease or condition that, in the opinion of the Commissioner, requires unvaccinated students be excluded from attendance. The bill prohibits a preschool, elementary or secondary school, or institution of higher education from exempting a student from a mandatory immunization unless the student, or the student's parent or guardian, if the student is a minor, complies with all of the applicable requirements set forth in the bill. The bill provides the Commissioner with expedited rulemaking authority in order to provide such guidance to school and public health authorities as they will need to implement its provisions on a timely basis."""

kratom,fdcnbzh,t3_ekjw51,1578279181.0,"like you, I used to chase Kratom tea with cigarettes (for the times I both smoked and drank the tea).  


1 year ago, I quit cigarettes cold turkey.  I began using Kratom early on as a quitting tool at nights (3g-10g, pending tolerance).  I took breaks (no kratom, nicotine, nothing)  for day or 2 off, every other week.

When I'm on Kratom (time of dose - 6/7 hours), my desire for Nicotine diminishes [Pro].  However, when I'm itching for Kratom, my itching for Nicotine dramatically increases too.  In this way, it amplifies the cravings [Con].  

It is hard to say one way or another because early on (for myself), Nicotine withdrawals were bad.  I couldn't think straight for about 5 weeks.  The Kratom did nothing for this (either good nor bad) [Neutral] but it did calm me down and gave me a ""reward"" to look forward to [Pro].   So for the latter it is worth a try, but quitting smoking is not fun and really needs physical confidence and spiritual determination.  In time your mind + body will level out at its own pace.  

Still, continuing smoking, is worst of all.  Much strength in however you approach."

Certain people just do not get ""happy.""  That isn't to mean that they are eternally ""sad"" or in ""pain""... but the condition of ""happiness"" is simply beyond and not a measure to aspire to.  

I think a better approach is ""satisfied"" or ""dissatisfied."" If you are dissatisfied, find out what needs fixing and work towards a better future.  That you can do while working a 9-5, traveling the roads, waiting tables or living in a camper van.
