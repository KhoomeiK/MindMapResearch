FortNiteBR,ffkwab7,t1_ffkw3mn,1580030165.0,"180s, while very unpopular, can be quite useful in some situations, if done quickly. The person in the clip was just spinning around building walls and stairs, while fucking up every 2 seconds."
FortNiteBR,ffkw19f,t1_ffjnxea,1580030031.0,"Yeah that’s cool, but the kid in the clip can’t do 90s either"

AskReddit,fff14zb,t1_ffexet4,1579872812.0,"Fucking hell since when is hugging someone is considered assault. Yeah I wouldn’t hug random people on the train, but it sickens me how people compare HUGGING to BEATING PEOPLE UP. I’m not saying what the guy did was good, but it’s not fucking assault"

assassinscreed,ffcbsvs,t1_ffcbpty,1579796049.0,"Yeah, I know it’s reversed. It happened because reddit’s formatting is weird, because I pasted it in the correct way. Is it an accurate translation though?"
