Anyways, it was like 2 AM and I was driving on the freeway somewhere in Oklahoma.  There was a semi in front of me and a vehicle in front of the semi.  All of a sudden, both the semi and vehicle start moving fast to the right shoulder and I think it's a deer or some sort of animal.  NOPE.  I saw fucking headlights and I pull over to the right too, milliseconds before a head-on collision going 75 MPH and who knows how fast the other driver was going.

Both the semi and the other vehicle in front of him pullover, but I keep going as I have a ton of adrenaline.  I find the nearest gas station and pull into it so I can chill out of a minute.  I call my buddy who is still awake and explain to him what happened.  Finally, my adrenaline goes back to normal and I decided to find the nearest motel and call it a night.  

So I go back onto the freeway to the nearest motel and a car FLIES past me going god-knows how fast.  I think it's the same car that almost head-on killed me earlier.  I keep driving, almost to my motel and I see the same car pulled over on the far left - off the freeway road, onto a fairly large shoulder.  He had his lights completely off and his car was off too.  I think he was trying to avoid the cops or something.
