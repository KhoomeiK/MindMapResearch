Edit: I used Jenny Journals 'How I make stickers' as a reference when I started out."
bettafish,ffss3h2,t1_ffsrgv1,1580190440.0,"I bought cultures on ebay of both microworms and vinegar eels. The brine shrimp eggs and hatchery from Amazon. You could try shaving tiny bits of frozen foods, too. See what she prefers. Cultures take a while to create a decent amount. Just remember to take out any visible uneaten foods.

 I would wait a few days if you just got her to give her time to come of hiding at her own pace to see if the flow is bothering her or not. As for the pump, if it's just a bubbler, Petco has a tiny air line valve that has one little knob on it to adjust air flow if it's too much."

Beans, rice, canned meats (chicken/tuna), and pastas are good to have on hand. I've gotten bread, tortillas, ramen, juices, and some canned goods at Dollar Tree, but still keep an eye out at markets."

TwoXChromosomes,ff4ga2l,t1_ff4fyta,1579562896.0,"Because I was an active duty soldier at the time of having both of my children, the health insurance provided by the government covered 100% of the cost so I personally didn't have to pay the 163k and 94k. Having children without those benefits in place would've been unfathomable. There'd be no way  without a good job that also offered amazing health benefits."
