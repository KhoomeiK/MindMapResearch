fatlogic,ffk2rbo,t1_ffjsi7d,1580014016.0,The Cheesecake factory averages around 1200 a slice. I looked up stats for cheesecakes at 5 other chain restaurants where I live(Canada). 600-800. Not even close. What. The. Fuck.
fatlogic,ffin388,t1_ffhzvhd,1579977831.0,"I honestly do not understand HOW? I've never been to the cheesecake factory but I like to buy a cheesecake from Safeway and eat a slice every couple of days. It's 520 calories. A lot, but nothing an active person can't eat and work around macro wise. But one THOUSAND? Ehat the actual FUCK is in that? Pure butter?"

And again, voices are not characters. Saying the message is ""You are not alone"" falls apart when we have no idea what these ghosts are even doing, if they're actually helping or just providing moral support. She doesn't even know most of them and they're not foreshadowed in any way whatsoever. Luke just got one phrase from Obi Wan letting him know what he must do in order to make the impossible shot, if we think that's the same thing that happened to Rey than that's still an example of her winning just because she's strong."
StarWars,ffckh99,t1_ffcjzm0,1579801378.0,"Dude. It's over. It's not going to beat any of those movies. Many theatres have already pulled it, it's been overtaken by 1917. And another Star Wars movie could have easily beaten those figures. Nobody thought The Avengers' numbers could be best by another Marvel film. Then after the other films set it up so brilliantly Infinity War smashed records, and because Infinity War was so good, Endgame blew everyone's expectations forever. If The Last Jedi was a great movie, than it would have set up The Rise of Skywalker to gross over 1.5 billion at least. It wasn't."

StarWars,ffcjce8,t1_ffciusu,1579800694.0,"Out of all the Disney movies released this year. The one marketed as the grand finale to possibly the biggest franchise in history(Maybe overtaken by Marvel now), a literal cultural phenomenon, is bottom of the pack."
StarWars,ffciusu,t1_ffciazl,1579800400.0,"Dude. This year almost EVERY big movie crossed a billion. This was the final movie to STAR WARS that came out in time with no competition, with shit tons of marketing released for it. Hell with marketing it's break even point was likely around 700 million. A billion dollars at the box office, getting beaten by Joker and Aladdin when TFA made 2 billion easily is a failure. Also, the rotten tomatoes reviews are incredibly sketchy

It makes zero sense why the rotten tomatoes reviews have 40,000 more reviews than Avengers Endgame which grossed 2.5 times as much, why the reviews sound so sinilar to each other, why the actual percentage has never changed one point from 1000 to 100,000, or why the metacritic user score is 4.9, IMDB audience score is 6.9. But Rotten Tomatoes is 86%. That's fucking sketchy."
StarWars,ffci04j,t1_ffchqn8,1579799879.0,Sure. Plenty of stuff could of gone wrong behind the scenes. But what everyone sees is a plane crash. That's a bad thing.
StarWars,ffchwnu,t1_ffchpbi,1579799820.0,It was literally set up with Han and Luke having a conversation with Luke calling him out and saying that there's more to him than money. Then Han comes back duento that conversation.

StarWars,ffcgquw,t1_ffcgisq,1579799107.0,Lol. Point still stands. Shitty writing is shitty writing. You haven't said a word as to why it's not shitty writing. Just made attacks. I can't fly an airplane but I'm pretty sure I can still criticize a pilot who crashed his jet because he fell asleep on the controls.

Guess literally everyone on the planet should talking shit about season i of Game of Thrones then. Because most of them arenln't screenwriters."
StarWars,ffcfzhl,t1_ffcfpbx,1579798641.0,That's still a victory from being more powerful than him. Having a bunch of voices encouraging you doesn't change that.
StarWars,ffcfp1u,t1_ffcfj82,1579798464.0,You can enjoy whatever the heck you want to enjoy. It doesn't make it well written. I love Dragon Ball Z but I'm not pretending it's a masterpiece of storytelling. I like it because it's got cool fights and serves as good workout motivation. I've always thought Star Wars should be better than that or at least attempt to be.
unpopularopinion,ffbltpf,t1_ffbk6sm,1579771672.0,There are 1.1 BILLION cattle. You missed 3 zeroes. The amount of land needed to feed those cattle and then feed humans with that cattle(Creating a loss of energy in the process). Is enough to feed the globe. We currently produce enough food to feed 10 billion people.

IncelTears,fc05v26,t3_efdrgs,1577279939.0,"If I'm being honest the Allied powers killed as many civilians as the Nazis. The Holocaust and rape of Nanking were horrifying. But so was Churchill starving millions of Indians to death, and the US genocides against the natives in the 1ith and 19th centuries, and they've not been short on causing suffering after the end of WW2. And that's before the Soviet Union's horrific crimes. I'm not endorsing fascism by any means. Just giving reminders that our capitalist(And the Soviets' Communist) Liberal Democracies can also be horrific and oppressive systems."
