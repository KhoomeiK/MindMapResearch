relationship_advice,fey30rj,t3_eqqipw,1579440095.0,I know exactly what you are going through. Due to a childhood of looking after my family I was scared of being vulnerable in front of people because I thought it made me look weak. I now have a fantastic boyfriend and over the last few years I slowly let my guard down. He makes me feel totally safe but independent and strong at the same time. I even cry in front of him which is a big thing for me. I still struggle with letting people help me do stuff but I'm working on that. You just have to take it slow. It might take a long time but your boyfriend sounds like a great guy and I bet he would love to see the other side of you. Good luck! :)
