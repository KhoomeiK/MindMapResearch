bipolar,ffhcnoa,t1_ffhbwch,1579930014.0,"Ah gotcha. I also go through periods where I lose interest in everything (including all the things I just mentioned). I literally feel nothing, just empty. Thankfully (I guess) when I have those periods I'm usually mentally exhausted and so I sleep a lot (16-18 hours a day). It would probably really suck to be unable to sleep and unable to find interest in doing something. 
One of the things I found that works for me (gets me to feel something) is to play horror games, because I am a huge chicken and abject terror is a good way to get my heart going. Unfortunately it doesn't engage all your senses. Prior to meds I used to be a lot more antsy (unable to sit still) so i would pace a lot (several hours a day) while reading or listening to music- sometimes I actually miss it lol walking in circles is soothing. Sorry I can't help very well"
bipolar,ffhbomk,t1_ffhaqho,1579929049.0,"I'm not sure I can suggest anything you should do just because I don't know what you like. But I can definitely tell you what I do. Usually during my periods of insomnia from hell I find a project to obsess over. The past few days it was this drawing (spent almost every moment working on it). Previously I decided to reread the entire Harry Potter series. Prior to that it was working on and fantasizing about writing my own book and creating my own comics (my goals in life). I also like to study, especially anatomy. (Can you tell I also have Adhd, so many projects lol) Or there's just the good old time waster of watching youtube videos (recently I have been obsessing over watching people play horror games, especially visage, or and blair witch). And of course video games (handheld ones). Sorry that was a lot of word vomit, pretty much I just obsess over different things I enjoy (art, reading, writing pretty much). I also have 2 beasties (dogs) to cuddle. 
That probably did not answer your question lol but I hope you find something you enjoy doing to pass the time (quietly of course)"

bipolar,ffh92ub,t1_ffh84v6,1579926642.0,Thankyou very much
bipolar,ffh8xv9,t1_ffh6mzg,1579926523.0,"Thankyou so much. I posted and deleted the progress pics so many times over the past 2 days, I figured I was annoying people lol"
drawing,ffh5iko,t1_ffh4sd2,1579923680.0,That picture is both cute and creepy. I love it.
drawing,ffh4n9b,t1_ffh4a9g,1579923001.0,Lol good and thankyou. I did use a reference for the hair (if you type in anime hairstyles you'll see these blank manikin looking things with just the hairstyles so that could also be it). I posted it a lot the last two days (and deleted it alot when noone seemed to like it lol)
drawing,ffh46to,t1_ffh43oj,1579922645.0,No I didn't. I have been posting it a lot the past few days with progress pics (like a crazy person) though
dogpictures,ffg1glu,t1_ffg0z8z,1579896396.0,I'm so sorry you had to make that decision. That's what we ended up doing too. They gave us the option to perform a series of surgeries to try to remove it (the size and position made it difficult) but there was no guarantee he would survive or that it wouldnt grow back. He was also septic on the day we put him down (tumor was so huge parts of it were dying due to lack of blood flow and necrotic tissue entered his bloodstream causing infection)
dogpictures,ffg0uhm,t1_ffg0o0s,1579896021.0,Thankyou. It was devastating to watch him deteriorate so fast (took only 4 months).

aww,ffbip7n,t1_ffbimdf,1579767133.0,Thankyou. I was looking through pictures and thought he was adorable (looks so goofy)
aww,ffbibaq,t1_ffbi8kt,1579766610.0,He died from cancer 2 months ago
bipolar,ffbf3je,t1_ffbenbh,1579762546.0,"That's the reason why I said certain family members instead of saying specifically which one because I know they mean well and I love the hell out of them so I'm not mad, it just makes me a little sad trying to explain the experience and having them seemingly dismiss it (I know they don't mean it that way but in the moment it hurts) I know they're just worried about me. And I definitely agree with you about exercise (I love exercise). I walk 40 minutes to an hour almost every morning with my dogs, lift weights and do yoga. Although admittedly lately I haven't been as consistent as I used to be (due to several down periods). I'm getting back into it though. I definitely function better on meds as well so when they tell me that I need to get completely off the drugs it can make me feel defeated that it feels like i can't function without them. 
I agree with everything you said I just wanted to clarify that I didn't hold it against them. I was recently diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder (previously bipolar 1) and I was feeling a little upset so I called them to talk about it and they completely dismissed it (told me not to let the doctors convince me I was schizophrenic) which made me sad which led to the post lol sorry this was so long"

masseffect,ffab9at,t1_ffab3yo,1579731516.0,Thankyou. In my version it looks like he has small goofy legs lol
gaming,ff7tfqf,t1_ff7szt9,1579657936.0,Thankyou I will definitely try that
gaming,ff7rgm4,t1_ff7rdk4,1579656566.0,"I always manage to make simple, stupid mistakes which usually ruins it"
bipolar,ff5p2a9,t1_ff5osrh,1579604136.0,I think that's one of the reasons I fell in love with it. His beautifully grotesque faces are soothing to look at (for me)
zelda,ff4g96i,t1_ff4fxbh,1579562878.0,Thankyou
gaming,ff4g865,t1_ff4fy9z,1579562860.0,Thankyou. I'm usually really slow when I draw so anything that takes me under an hour I consider quick lol
gaming,ff4g5ax,t1_ff4cti3,1579562806.0,Thankyou
bipolar,fcqk6pj,t1_fcqgusy,1577887441.0,No not at all sorry. I love to draw other things (especially anatomy) but I've never really drawn fur before. And this is my first time drawing fur in colored pencil. Thankfully since I do like to draw the skills seem to be transferable
bipolar,fcpqx5l,t1_fcpqaiw,1577870200.0,"Thankyou. I'm not quite ready to start making them for other people yet, just because this is my first attempt and I would like to practice for about a mlm month to make sure I can do it well (and make them beautiful) but I will definitely post when I am ready. If you are still interested by then (if you happen to see it) i would love to make one for you. First i want to make sure I'm good enough so that people get a drawing they love"
bipolar,fcpiorm,t1_fcph9km,1577865306.0,Thankyou so much
bipolar,fcpil66,t1_fcphc3c,1577865247.0,"Thankyou. When I was a 9-5 bitch (love it) I was extremely suicidal (I worked in retail and restaurants and the stress made me snap) so I'm hoping this works out.
Happy new year"
bipolar,fcpibvu,t1_fcphzxt,1577865089.0,Thankyou so much. Right now I work really slow because I'm so afraid of ruining it. So I'm hoping to practice for a month or two to gain more confidence and speed. I don't want people to have to wait a long time for their drawing just because I'm nervous lol
bipolar,fcpi4jw,t1_fcphh1a,1577864951.0,"I'm not quite sure what I should charge yet (I have to do a little research), this is actually my very first try at drawing a dog portrait in colored pencil, so I'm a little worried I won't be able to do it well. But I'm going to practice for a few months (I'll see how well I'm doing after a month and hopefully be able to start then)  and then start trying to do commissions. I want to make sure anyone who asks for one gets the best I can possibly give them."
bipolar,fcpc1ay,t1_fcpb3pw,1577857747.0,Thankyou so much
bipolar,fcpa7pq,t1_fcp9sgt,1577855888.0,I'm not sure yet. Right now I'm just trying to make sure I can do it well. So I'm trying to learn a few new techniques to make them look the best that I possibly can. I'm also really slow at it lol because I'm constantly paranoid that I'll ruin it. Hopefully after a couple months of practice I'll be faster and more confident
bipolar,fcp9d48,t1_fcp90o4,1577854964.0,"Thankyou. I did a very light sketch underneath. And right now I'm doing the underpainting (in a new technique I'm trying to learn). I'm using water soluble colored pencils to lay in the light and dark areas as well as the general fur direction, once I'm done I'll go over it in water to create a color map, then I'm going back over it in regular colored pencil for details."
bipolar,fcp8741,t1_fcp7xzz,1577853732.0,Thankyou so much. Happy new year
bipolar,fcp7s8i,t1_fcp7r04,1577853327.0,Thankyou so much
bipolar,fcp7rqp,t1_fcp7gq6,1577853313.0,Thankyou. I hope so because I'm really excited about it so I hope it works out (meaning I don't sabotage myself)
bipolar,fcp7q7c,t1_fcp7kc8,1577853270.0,Thankyou so much
bipolar,fcp71c1,t1_fcp6zy8,1577852595.0,I don't know why this made me laugh so much but it did lol so thankyou
