I’ve been all over with the military but never lived outside of towns that had several major shopping options. This town has Walmart and Lowes. Seriously, those are the big box stores they have. Everything else is 40+ minutes away. This town is dying slowly and maybe the intersection of the UBI could revitalize it. It would allow for more small businesses to open and even create a more DIY friendly commerce as well as bring life into the dying mall they have. 

Rural America is dying and the leftists just don’t seem to care because their proud and red, not progressive and blue. Yang is probably rural Americans final hope, while trump helped, he hasn’t stopped the bleeding that’s going on."
