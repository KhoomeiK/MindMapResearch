motivation,feofk8z,t3_epx5ne,1579299515.0,Alright let's do this.

What are you doing after you decide hobbies are too much work?"
oddlyspecific,feectoj,t1_feeb14n,1579031116.0,"This.

The hardest part is getting up to begin doing something.

Once you forced yourself to do that the rest is smooth sailing in my opinion."
DungeonWorld,fe7rpfn,t3_enyla5,1578918453.0,"I like the Front. 

Some stakes questions popped into my mind when glancing over your Front:

-Will Grease steal the soul gem? What does he do with it?

- What is the connection between Briars Signature weapon and the Forever Kings soul gem? Can it shatter the gem? Why can/can't it?

- Can Bjorn put the souls of the population of Valis to rest? At what cost? 

- Will Quorra accept the offer to join the Trodden Upon?"

motivation,fe72lug,t3_eny1f5,1578909094.0,"You really need just to keep going.

Don't think you are a failure. There are many many more people going through similar situations than you think.
When I dropped out of university in my mid 20's with little to no perspective my biggest problem was the shame of being responsible for my own situation, which I tried my best to keep secret from everybody. 

It took a while to accept my situation, open up to my family and friends and start really working through it.
There were times when I thought it never would get better but it eventually did."

Thank you very much for writing this."
DungeonWorld,fbbeo35,t1_fbbcpny,1576698870.0,"A picture just popped up in my head:

The druid desperately trying to get a bite out of a giant kraken which attacks the ship they're on in the middle of the fight.
Also: giant kraken duel."
