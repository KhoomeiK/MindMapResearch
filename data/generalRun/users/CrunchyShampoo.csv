AskReddit,ff8selb,t1_ff8r44e,1579694263.0,"He’s always been kind of scary, in an asshole sort of way. He reacted to mistakes I’ve made badly, making me scared of doing or saying the wrong thing. He doesn’t understand anxiety in his kids, (my siblings and I) and sees it as disrespectful and ignorant. He once made fun of my stutter when I was having a bad panic attack, and he tried to talk to me and just wouldn’t stop and I felt really overwhelmed, and interrupted him. (Bad idea)he’s controlling with my mom and with me, and he refuses to get therapy for himself when he clearly needs it. I’m not saying he’s low key abusive, it’s just a major problem in my household Sorry if this is picky, I need a rant once in a while."
