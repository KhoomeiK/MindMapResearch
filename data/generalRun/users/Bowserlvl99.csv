PewdiepieSubmissions,ff9tx0h,t3_esc32t,1579721201.0,I don't think metric users have a clue how far a mile is either. Both would be screwed.
Tinder,ff0lsoj,t3_co0qff,1579470098.0,If you are looking for a serious relationship I highly encourage this as an opener. Just be honest with all your deal breakers.
Psychic,ff0lhz2,t1_fez48mp,1579469992.0,This. It gets stronger with practice and believing it's real. But ya I believe all people are subjected to feeling each other's spirit whether they are dead or alive and whether they know it or not.
depression,ff0kgjy,t1_fewvv5z,1579469718.0,Ya I haven't been intimate or had sex with someone for years. I feel like I am missing out hugely on the human experience. I don't think I've ever been appreciated the way I like to admire other people I like. I live with my mom who is super passive aggressive and only acts like she loves me when I get fed up and angry with her. Other than that she acts like an apathetic selfish brat. I don't have a specific religion necessarily but I do believe in God. It does bring me some comfort to think God or guardian angels love me. I really wish I had someone in this world to feel that with though. Try to practice self love too if you can. It's a bit of a crutch but it's better than nothing. If you believe you are worth loving it shines out to other people too and they see it also.
depression,ff0huuo,t1_feyfak4,1579469008.0,"I just don't consider genuinely horrible life circumstances that reduce your joy to nothing an illness. Depression caused by a bad perspective that can be changed could be considered an illness but to me that's dangerous because people try to fix it with medication. Theres a strong push to call everything an illness by the medical industry to increase drug sales. However long term negative hopeless outlooks could cause the symptoms of pure physical depression and it might be difficult for some people to determine what is causing what. You want to be very in tune with your thinking. For me pure physical depression results in disinterest, sleep and low ambition. But the negative perspective depression is accompanied by sadness, hopelessness and anger a lot more.   


As far as stress goes yes I meant over worked physically or mentally. If i've used my brain too long and intensely for anything it becomes hard for me to be happy until I rest. If i've been exercising too hard for too long it's hard for me to be happy until I rest. If my diet is off or I'm on some weird medication it's hard for me to be happy or energized. That side of depression I would 100% say is an illness and should be treated by a medical doctor. The other type of depression I would treat with therapy."
depression,fewue98,t3_eqt1ct,1579419639.0,I have something like that too. My 2 best friends left town. Then the sorta friends I had at the time couldn't handle my depression cause they were a party group. I've never felt like my family loves me and I've never had much of a romantic life. Just 2 girlfriends that I put way more effort into the relationship than they did. They never seriously wanted me the way I wanted to be with them. The only thing that keeps me going is hope for my own loving family or new relationships. That only works as long as you believe it's possible though. I hope you find some fulfillment. It's hard to get up everyday not being able to share joy with other people.
depression,fewjzf6,t3_eqelf5,1579412245.0,God damn I don't even know how you get through that. Unbelievable. I hope you find or have found happiness. Good luck.
depression,fewjc2i,t3_eqm9ao,1579411766.0,Ya I wonder about this sometimes with talentless people that also don't have money. That must be really freaking hard. I'm sorry. I can play guitar and surf really well but I'm depressed over relationships and career. I'm not sure if I will ever meet someone who just likes me for who I am. I've never really hit it off with a girl while I was poor. I'm kind of bitter thinking that all of the sudden I'll be way more desirable when I have more money regardless of my personality. The only way I can make enough money for a family is by working a disgusting amount of hours in a dangerous job. How would you even go about having a relationship with a family when all you do is work and sleep. Personally I just feel like life sucks. I would never want to die though I'd rather just grind it out cause we only get one shot at this unless there's reincarnation but then you still come back anyways right? I also believe that we carry our spiritual development in this life over into our reincarnated life if it's true. I personally just want to watch the world and still bitch about it hoping it will change. Can't do that if you aren't here.
depression,fewh6me,t1_fev3zqg,1579410517.0,I think waves of depression can be from phyisical factors. I know I can have a hard time thinking happy thoughts when I'm physically stressed or low on energy. Happiness takes a certain amount of homeostasis to sustain. It requires calm nerves and some mental clarity. But the serious depression for me I is more life circumstances and belief based. So in my personal case I agree with them.
depression,fewgo20,t3_eqnbva,1579410272.0,Who the F thinks that? I must be really out of the loop...Did depression become trendy cause famous people are tweeting about it?
numerology,fepsy11,t3_eq8kqc,1579330192.0,"I'm sure questions like this are very common among people in this aspect of life but they don't usually talk about it. Me personally I don't know exactly how or why both of them would work but they do. It's like trying to ask who has the right religion? Maybe one is right, maybe a couple are right. In my experience though God and the divine interacts with people of every religion regardless if one of them is right. The only religions I have a hard time believing are when the theology teaches eternal hell. I won't get into it unless you want but that's my personal belief.   


It's like asking why are there 2 major zodiacs and which one is the correct one to follow? Maybe they're both right and one applies to you if you are spiritually tied to one culture over the other. There are actually tons of versions of Western astrology. It has been based on the lunar Calendar in some cultures which would add a full month to some years to get the Calendar back on track. No idea how they handle a leap year that big for their Zodiac system. Or what if my rune stones conflict with my tarot? What if my astro chart isn't working with my tarot or scrying. I would go with the one that speaks the strongest to you spiritually. Use your intuition to draw you to the one that seems accurate for you."
Psychic,fep873z,t1_feovaqp,1579314318.0,"I have the forehead pressure too. Mine began off and on about a year before I started actual contact with spirits. It mostly came out at night when I was playing video games. Now it is with me all day every day. It's strongest about 3 inches deep behind my forehead and it radiates out to a point on the forehead itself. Sometimes It stretches from the back center to the top of my head. I assume it's just an active 3rd eye Chakra. That symptom seems pretty common around these parts. Fun Fact: I got an MRI scan to see if they could detect any abnormalities causing it, possibly tumor or something. They found absolutely nothing. They said I might be hallucinating it. Generally when I get physical sensations from spirits they aren't hallucinations and I can see the actual result in the mirror like my face muscles being pulled. If my mind is ""hallucinating"" it then it is genuinely triggering nerves and muscles to create the hallucination. I'm not sure if MRI's actually detect brain activity or just scan for brain physical structure. I think the neurologists know what spiritualists consider it but they won't say anything suggesting it or research the 3rd eye because this culture is a bunch of Science purists. To even mention ancient spiritual beliefs that have some basis will cause you a lot of problems unless you are already a holistic style doctor.

But this particular experience I wrote about with the pulsing hemispheres of the brain to rapid fire pass out level is something I have only experienced once and I don't know anyone else that has even heard of it. I'll check out that article in a minute. It sounds interesting."
kabbalah,feobnmk,t1_feo9sup,1579297781.0,"Well according to the Sefir Yetzirah there is a sacredness and power in each Hebrew symbol and sound. The Hebrew language itself then is supposed to have a lot of spiritual power from the foundation of its letters. I've read from some people that you won't get the FULL experience of Kabbalah unless you are reading it in Hebrew and trying to uphold the law of course. Some how the letters and language are supposed to penetrate your conscious and soul and bring you understanding. That's why I was wondering if you knew Hebrew. I haven't personally read the Zohar as it is 10,000 pages or so and I'm just beginning to learn about this stuff this year. I'm just reading a guide book that explains how to read the Zohar. It uses some significant quotes from it and spends a few pages discussing their more complicated and hidden meanings."
Psychic,feo687g,t3_eq5405,1579295679.0,"This is something I'm working on right now. I use to try to communicate by assisting blocked messages. I'd use my personal context, the feeling I was getting and what was said prior to fill in gaps and keep the communication going. This lead to me doubting if the messages were from me or them. Recently I started practicing just letting the blocked messages happen. It's starting to make the voices louder and more active. The blocked messages that happened before now become nonsensical endings to sentences or a nonsensical barrage of images. It's almost like there is a reason for the block sometimes. Or maybe I just need to keep exercising this way of communication to open it up. All I know is communication with spirits is very finicky and mysterious. You'll likely find that what works for you personally is only partly shared with other people's experience.

In a nut shell. Be patient for them to talk to you. Don't feel like they are obligated to actually guide you every time you show up to talk. They might want to but sometimes in the grand scheme of things they may not be able to give you what you want at the time. You have to remember they are connected to a sense of futuresight so they can solidly predict how you would take any message from them. For a million and one reasons sometimes saying nothing is more helpful to you than just giving you answers. Just be hopeful for a message and don't feel let down if a clear one doesn't come."
metalguitar,fenvou1,t1_fen31y8,1579291633.0,"One of my biggest problems with his videos is that he has almost identical tone to the album. Albums are usually heavily engineered and it's hard to make some of those sounds with single guitars. I don't know how he could perfectly match their tone unless he is hiding his guitar track way behind the original. I personally don't want identical tone so I can hear that it is your original playing. Plus I remember in his through the fire and the flames cover, part of the song uses a wah effect and he is clearly not pumping his foot. It's cool to watch. The frets are quite possibly nailed on time and not sped up. But for someone actually striving to be able to play songs end to end I feel like his videos don't give me an example to strive for. It just feels like a visual show."
TechnoProduction,fekgnwo,t1_fejuqw9,1579199655.0,Ok gotcha. I didn't specify exactly what style of techno I was interested but more like house and trance. Not the aggressive or machinery industrial techno. I really love the whole genre of house and trance and it really is their invention. It came on machine first and I was wondering if that style could be adapted to live instruments.
TechnoProduction,fekfvej,t1_fejl6ph,1579199179.0,I'm just not sure there could be a scene for that type of music and live playing. Theres a handful of guitar based songs I know that have a similar feeling but they never make me feel like dancing. They still make me want to head nod or head bang a little.
TechnoProduction,fejj3yt,t1_fejfeo7,1579176443.0,That second video straight up blew my mind. That guy is in so deep with his synthesizer control. No freakin computer....
TechnoProduction,fejinlu,t1_fejfpd0,1579175920.0,Holy shit that's a heavy video.
TechnoProduction,fejidtn,t1_fejelyr,1579175590.0,"I was personally looking to adapt some of my favorite trance, or house style music to a live instrument. I really really like the positive energy in that music. But ya, Some aspects of metal to techno would work too I think. Especially the idea of the solo. I think probably a good half of metal solos sound forced into the song or drawn out but some artists just frekin nail their short time of pure spontaneity. It's such an incredibly colorful moment when they do it right and it captures the feeling of the song. I personally would prefer lyrics weaved into the solo. I don't think it's necessary to drop the singer entirely. 

I should probably drop the metal analogy. You're right most musicians on the professional level play perfect regardless of style. It's just metal has a reputation for being very technical and that hard pursuit reflects the intensity of the music topics. I just really want to see a lot of techno styles played with instruments so people can show they live it. That they can connect to and control the song live."
TechnoProduction,fejcfny,t1_fej9rri,1579167055.0,"Hmmm so the mathematical or ""iterative experimentation"" is a very interesting concept to me. I mentioned I'm a bit of a spiritualist and part of spiritualism of all religions is sacred geometry and numerology. Judaism is heavily linked to this and indirectly so is Christianity and Islam. But I do believe there is some serious legitimacy to mathematical patterns of music. Thanks for the heads up on that. You say it's more about iterative experimentation. How deep is the history of this in techno music? As far as machines pumping out mathematical patterns. I would still argue the perfect consistency is still a very important aspect of the attraction for most people but the mathematical pattern generation is very interesting to me. Personally most of my patterns are internally derived or I hear them in songs and I can soundly say the way I hear them in my head aren't perfect patterns. I am very spontaneous when I am inventing rifts and my internal music is CONSTANTLY changing but still based around the same structure I guess. Although sometimes I literally just cut riffs off in my head to cut to the next section. It just feels right sometimes. It seems like these are 2 schools of approaching as far as perfect dynamics or perfect structure of expression. I myself have always strongly focused on perfect dynamics rather than perfect patterns. Probably because metal always integrates solos which are generally a mind frick to get lost in but still sound amazing."
TechnoProduction,fejbyt1,t1_fej9cjl,1579166343.0,"The ""imperfections"" or when perfect ""in the moment spontaneity"" are way different on an electric guitar. You can affect the volume, rhythm, attack  or legato and even the tone if you bend it slightly or press harder on the left hand. It's not quite the same as pressing a button. Even palm mute amount changes it a lot. I know keyboards do their best to recreate this with loudness of pressure but it's not quite the same. But ya I'm leaning in the direction of keyboards and electric drums over pre programmed samples."

metalguitar,fej8rhb,t1_fej5vyv,1579161794.0,I love obvious imperfections in the beginning of each take and how I can hear your guitar tone way louder. It totally sells me that it's live.

metalguitar,feid31d,t1_feibzp7,1579135685.0,No channel yet just getting into recording right now. I've just been recreationally playing for years but I'm moving to an apartment and I have to keep it quiet so I'm gonna start running my guitar through my computer head phones with the music. I figured why not start recording. And I need to get polished to play in a band if I want to play loud so I'm trying to clean my playing up. I'll post on here if I make any decent vids.
metalguitar,fei7qll,t1_fehyvd1,1579132157.0,I've seen that Rolland one. I have a hard time getting into the ones when they do the cuts to different cameras. I'm just wondering how much rest did they have between riffs. I like the covers like the first one though. It's probably a lot less impressive to average people that don't play instruments though.
metalguitar,fei7lnm,t1_fei31a5,1579132070.0,"I noticed I played like shit the first few times I tried recording because I was thinking about how I would look after the recording. I couldn't lose myself in the sound connected to the feel of my hands. That focus on the visual display sucked the life out of my playing. Maybe if I played live shows I'd get over that cause the visual display can be a huge part.   


The camera changes are always highly suspect. But this debate aside wtf was that section at 3:00 minutes in that video. I always thought those sections were tremolo picking but it's looking like they were trading off down picks between two guitars. Never seen that before. Definitely gives the track a unique sound."
metalguitar,fei6jmb,t1_fei315p,1579131392.0,"Ya I need to stick to live shows as the standard to compare. I remember the 3 best bands that noticeably stood out as near perfect playing were In Flames, Lamb of God and Iron Maiden was pretty damn good. Most other bands I've heard shabby dynamics for a few riffs and straight up mistakes. The shows are still amazing though and I have tons of respect for their ability to even compose the music even if they can't pull it off 100% of the time. But I'm on a quest to find the true legendary metal monsters out there. I know they're out there but they're as rare as Bruce Lee in the martial arts world.

AskDocs,fdmsyjd,t3_em4044,1578564251.0,I get kinda crampy from alcohol if I haven't eaten for a while. If you are on a low carb diet or a very low calorie diet it could do this. Not having carbs dumps the electrolytes in your body hard. Also if you have skinny arms and less muscle mass you might be more susceptible. Make sure to have some bread and a little salt and a variety of vegetables to get those electrolytes back if that's the problem.

I don't even bother anymore.  Swamis point on a big day is gross too. I thought about taking it on cause i've had a few good sessions out there.

kabbalah,fdjmk9f,t3_ehao8a,1578478132.0,"I've always associated 666 with the octave scale. It was invented by Pythagoras in 500 B.C. using a mathematical formula for the frequencies based on 12 half steps and has been generally the most recognized system of music. In it the 7th half step is the most harmonious with the tonic as it the half way point in frequency from the low tonic to the high tonic. The 6th half step is the least harmonious and evil sounding. It is also known as the ""Tri Tone"" which just shouts 666 at me. I find it really interesting that this system of music was discovered long after the ancient religious system of numerology was established. It's almost like a natural existing confirmation of ancient numerology as far as I can tell."

Right now I'm just reading guide books about the Zohar and I read the Sefir Yetzirah in English. I'm very interested in studying Kabbalah one day. It seems like such a huge undertaking though. Do you read it in Hebrew? How much have you read so far?"
OccultConspiracy,fdjkf07,t3_ektikk,1578475018.0,"I think there are 2 separate forms of morality. Natural morality and religious morality. Natural morality to me is a natural process of becoming an aware loving person. You reason your way into why you wouldn't harm someone without cause. I suppose the basis of that is love and empathy. You reason your way to taking care of yourself and treating yourself well which would be self love. Religious morality are all the zanny rules surrounding theology, ceremony and traditions. I could agree that we might be able to do without the religious specific morality that the religions don't have in common. But the moralities that the religions do have in common are typically the natural moralities. To me they aren't doctrine but just the mind and path of a loving human put into words.

I agree that morality in the form that most people obtain it from religion is ""cut and dry."" However the truth is that morality is a complicated organic thing. If we were to attempt to document all cases of moral decision making it would take thousands upon thousands of pages that no one could be expected to read in a life time nor should they if they won't even encounter all of those situations. The Talmud of the Jewish faith is a good example of this. That is an expansion of the laws found in the Torah. The Torah is like 300 pages and only about 150 or less is actual laws. But the expansion of application, exceptions and interpretations of that law is over 3000 pages long. I don't think it is considered divine or complete either although some of it is. Morality should never be considered ""cut and dry"" but the distributors of morality like to convince their followers that it is. It helps the sheeple to feel comfortable in their stupidity and follow."
OccultConspiracy,fdjjsk3,t3_elponj,1578474120.0,"Interesting. I don't personally believe in an eternal hell. I used to. I do think the evil congregation at the top probably do. If they don't there is definitely a huge motivation to convince the world of it. I never understood the idea of Satanists. If hell is eternal torture why would they want to be there? Do they think they get to be masters in hell and Satan will be some self indulgent ruler? Or do they just loathe goodness so much that they don't care? Christianity doesn't paint a picture where Satan gets to rule freely in hell forever.   


Anyways I'm kind of interested where you get your ideas about the Kings of the past. Is it based on a conspiracy with historical evidence? Or is it just the messages you receive? I personally believe the world has always been ruled by secret alliances and agendas at the top. It is the foundation of the secret societies that exist today and their roots are ancient. It's convincing about why and how it would work. But I don't think they are immune to internal strife. I'm surprised blind people can't develop schizophrenia. I thought schizophrenia included auditory hallucinations. Why would they not be able to develop that? I think schizophrenia is mostly spiritual, part personal health and part technology. I'm so sure we will be able to interpret the EMF given off by the electricity of the mind and translate it into images and sounds one day. A more impressive trick would be memory retrieval which to me is far more enigmatic than the active loud part of the mind. I personally hear voices, see visions and feelings but I haven't been meditating for a while so it isn't strong right now. I don't like to call it schizophrenia because people lump it in with muttering confused homeless people that can't live a normal life. That is a whole nother level. Good luck in your journey.

surfing,fdig1a2,t1_fdg360i,1578442077.0,"Good for you. Do you think you represent the majority of girl surfers? I am very aware that girls can overcome this but it's harder. No matter how big of surf you tackle it's a bigger struggle and requires more bravery for someone weaker regardless of gender. I have seen girls in big surf. Theres just usually less. And often when it gets really scary for my standards I see literally no girls. Why are there only 2-3 girls that take on jaws seriously. It's just harder and more dangerous. It shouldn't be taboo to say that women are physically weaker on the average and therefor probably more intimidated by big surf on the average.

And why did you have to translate a situation in a physical sport to a career choice? We don't live in the stone ages anymore. There are plenty of jobs for intellectual women that in fact pay more than physically demanding jobs. Does someone really have to explain that to you? That clearly your example is extreme and not at all what I was intending by that comment. 

Not sure what being white has to do with this. And I think we can do without remarks of genitalia assassination. You're kind of proving my point. Even the girls that do surf in scary waves might be overtly aggressive themselves. Toxic masculinity isn't just for men. Girls can be masculine too. For some reason strength tends to yield ill tempered people more often than kind and stoic. Or maybe there are the same number of ill tempered up and down through the strong and weak. But the strong feel bold enough to display anger while the weak have to rely on passive aggression."
surfing,fdeqazt,t1_fdeovho,1578344380.0,But apparently it was worse decades ago when the surfing population was less. Scarcity of waves is just one factor in this. And surfing is much worse than other sports in this regard too. Football and hockey might be exceptions but the aggroness is usually only on game day and it's a direct competition contact sport. So it makes sense in those.

Property value is too intense and we have to compete with the world's talent for jobs. I'm not sure how the Native Hawaiians manage to stay on the island with those prices. Is there a special deal or do you just own the land? Are they slowly kicking you guys out too?"
surfing,fdejxao,t1_fdehu5j,1578340605.0,I have been attacked once and in the same instance they threatened to kill me. Probably because I kept burning him so hard with my words after he didn't successfully beat me up so his friends came over. I'm not interested in standing my ground for surf anymore. I just ignore and paddle somewhere else.

If you can't oh well. I'm not trying to break into the boys club. I just want to catch waves with out worrying about someone hassling me for even looking at a wave that's in range of them. The ""boys"" club looks like theres a few guys I could get a long with but they have to play buddy buddy to an even bigger handful of jerks to be in it. To be honest I don't have problems with this every day. I'm as respectful as possible and if one of the ""regulars"" has his eye on a wave I don't even paddle for it cause he might get pissy. I realize this isn't the overt attitude of every session and every spot. But there is always some underlying vibe when you paddle out to scope out the patience of everyone around you to make sure there aren't any psychos. In a crowded line up theres always one. He's usually just a cocky wave hog when he's getting waves. But if he isn't getting enough to keep him tired he gets the rage. It's just really common in surfing. I actually don't get much hassle anymore cause I'm so cautious about the etiquette. But I've seen how pissy these people get if they can't get a wave. It still happens to other people. They look like they're gonna go home and beat their families cause they didn't get a good enough session or missed the wave of the day. I know that kind of rage cause I grew up with it and they have that psycho rage look over waves.

As far as people doing just general douchey stuff like taking a wave from in front of you or paddling at you like you aren't there to put you out of position they do that at almost every spot. I just need to go to the more underground hard to catch on a good day spots. I know a few."
surfing,fdd2y1s,t1_fdd00u7,1578292643.0,Someones well studied. On the note that surfing is male dominated I believe probably for two reasons. In general sports are male dominated but only slightly on the high school level. But I think there is a huge disparity in extreme sports especially with those uncontrolled man vs. nature scenarios. The bigger the waves get it becomes more of a survival situation the smaller and weaker you are. It's just not fun at all when you're thinking about drowning. Plus they ride bigger boards for paddling a lot so they get thrown around. I think we'll see more women in the future but I doubt we'll see an equal proportion in bigger surf.

Theres people that snake or drop in on you, try to paddle you out of position like they are going to paddle right into you while the wave is coming, people that risk running people over for a good section, people that full on run you over for a good section without even trying to weave (rare), the verbal fighters and the physical fighters (rare).

I remember at Salt Creek someone attacked me for calling him an F*in B*ch because he just paddled out and parked his ass right in front of me to steal a wave. I literally would have had to run him over to go. After he attacked me and we fought for a bit in the water I started to leave so he wouldn't break my board or something. I said a few words like ""you're nuts"" ""I can't believe you would attack me over that when you clearly were wrong"" and I said ""You are talking to me like you want to kill me"" and one of his friends said to me, no lie ""I fuckin would kill you."" At that point I said you're out of your mind and I just left. Standing up for yourself just causes problems with these types of people.

I'd say most good surfers are ""territorial"" meaning they are going to hassle you even when you are clearly on the inside, a solid surfer and haven't had a wave for a few sets no matter how long i've been surfing there or how new they are. I see tourists act like that all the time if they are with their posse. They just want to keep on the conveyor belt with them and their buddies.

surfing,fdce0x6,t3_ekghx4,1578272602.0,"I never had that problem I don't think. If the pivot is tight and fast it's like the nose wraps so hard back to you that theres a solid pressure on the front foot. BUT I just looked up some pictures of pros and they all seem to have their front heals much closer to the rail than what you do. I think this has to do with the lean of the body not being symmetrical for left and right leaning. It's technically not symetrical in any direction because even though the body is symmetrical on the left and right side the actual surf form isn't symmetrical. It might be a lot easier to get pressure over the front toes than the heels and therefor the foot being perfectly centered  physically isn't identical to the center of balance.  
Heres a few examples:

Other Ideas: Your heal might be too close to center on the back foot too. It would feel like you aren't getting enough lean in the board so you are trying to compensate with extra pressure on the front heal.  It might just be a problem with flat sections. If you have a nice steep, fast and powerful section it might be different. I've done hard turns with my front foot totally disengaged. It's not ideal but if your back foot is up a little forward and upper body motion is right it just sort of happened to me. Do you feel like this is messing up your turns a lot? Or are you worried about the aesthetics? I'd have to see it in motion. I go with whatever technique makes me more controlled, fast and powerful. It really opens your form to tons of variety for the millions of different sections, boards and athleticism out there."
Synthetic_Biology,fcpwhw4,t3_dm2rle,1577873654.0,"I represent the perspective of people that are very skeptical of this field. I would say don't even touch anything that wants to modify something from birth. Hereditary genetics are so sacred. The balance of the world is at stake when we mass produce GMOs and for the most part it isn't that critical to helping the world. There are probably other solutions to hunger than GMOs. Given how little we understand about how genetics work it seems extremely dangerous. Right now we have the understanding of a computer programmer that copy pastes incredibly complicated code but they don't understand how it works. They just know it does because they've seen the result. Anything outside of the ""from birth"" spectrum is far less feared and rightfully so."
organic,fcp5dlc,t1_fcoimga,1577850999.0,I'm on an iodine rant right now cause I just ate a bunch of raw sea weed a few days ago to try an iodine detox. I never felt that kind of clear easy mental energy in my life. Usually I feel a lot of mental stress and pressure when I try and think fast but this was just like breathing. I have a feeling this was my thyroid activating. It also breaks down THC and morphine really hard. I can only imagine what else it breaks down. I literally couldn't get high on weed after overloading with iodine which might explain why some people can smoke weed more easily than others. I normally get super high energy and paranoia from weed but I literally didn't feel anything. I suspect this might be why asian cultures are traditionally more academic than American too because they have a lot of sea weed in their diet and it might be easier for them to push their kids. It's sad that a lot of sources of sea weed and fish are unsafe because we dump all our industrial waste into the ocean. I have a feeling once all this knowledge gets out there the future is going to look a lot less synthetic and industrialized than what we thought it was going to be.

Iodine Rant:  
I found out the other day that our main sources of iodine in western diet is fish, iodized salt and non organic dairy. Some how they iodize cows in the inorganic process. If you have organic dairy, and sea salt or Himalayan salt, and you aren't eating fish daily you are probably not getting enough iodine and might have thyroid problems from it. The only natural sources of iodine come from the ocean. Sea weed has ultra high levels of iodine to the point that it's dangerous if you have more than a nibble of some kinds. Fish has some iodine. Terrestrial grown plants only have iodine if the soil is close enough to the ocean to absorb the iodine from the sea breeze. It seems by nature we are meant to depend on the ocean heavily. Apparently raw kale blocks iodine uptake too >\_< Iodine is also critical for protecting us from heavy metal absorption."
