The definition of a dirty joke is one with a sexual subject matter. It has nothing to do with swearwords.

Groucho was obviously using the definiton of a dirty joke, ie. One of a sexual nature. There is no reason to assume he was alluding to swearwords. 

The person I replied to initially was saying that Benny Hill was the embodiment of a comedian as described by Groucho.

I said that Benny Hill, especially as depicted in the OP video, was in fact the embodiment of the kind of jokes that Groucho was making fun of.

You then seemed to disagree with me and now you are disagreeing with yourself."

funny,ffbsfdp,t1_ffbrrq7,1579780993.0,"...

The definition of a dirty joke is its contents, generally sexual in nature. It's easier assume Groucho was using the term in its definition rather than for something else. A visual joke is still a joke, and can also be dirty.

I guess we could assume Groucho meant something other than what he said, but why?"

A dirty joke refers to the content of a joke, not the words used. In the OP the joke is about someone grabbing a tit. That's a classic dirty joke."

television,fe52xvw,t1_fe4swdk,1578865193.0,"But they are right in that speedos are becoming less and less common with younger generations throughout Europe.

I can certainly also see changes in my own country as well as others.

For example the ludicrous American notion that breastfeeding in public is inherently indecent. I've seen this spread.

The same goes for stuff like creationism, anti-vax movement (there are also certain anti-vax in some immigrant communities but they are often more religious in nature than that particular brand of anti-vax).

The idea that only the UK is susceptible to this is wrong.

It's worth pointint out that speedos specifically are more hygenic than loose fitting swim wear most of the time, and countries like France have outright legal measures preventing people wearing loose fitting swim wear in some places, but that's a law in place to prevent this sort of cultural osmosis (as well as trying to stop tourists of course)."

You also keep misrepresenting my arguments.

I never said nude beaches are being outlawed.

There are generational shifts in what's considered normal. This includes stuff like speedos going out of style, smoking being considered gross quicker than it otherwise would have, rap being popular, drinking Coca Cola, eating at McD, and so forth and so forth.

You can pretend like America isn't influencing Europe across the continent, deliberately or otherwise, or that it's having no effect.

You can pretend like a generation (and more) didn't grow up with Disney.

You can pretend American movies aren't regular top earners in European countries, you can pretend like American games aren't being played by Europeans to a much greater degree than vice versa.

You can pretend like Apple, Microsoft, Facebook, or any other American firm doesn't influence Europe.

But in the end it'd be pretending."
television,fe3k2xx,t1_fe3ewie,1578849986.0,"That Europe is changing it's norms doesn't mean that suddenly nude beaches disappear. Cultural osmosis happens over generations. Maybe you are too old to have noticed the Americanisms affecting younger generations.

The idea of Europe as an impenetrable bastion of culture that won't relent to barbaric Americanism is... well. It's at least counter to reality.

I can guarantee that approaching young people across all countries.of Europe, you'll find that many of their commonalities are American in nature."
television,fe2rxd8,t1_fe27t0u,1578842238.0,"I feel like you are adressing points I never made and missing some I made by a mile. 

My claim essentially boils down to:

USA generally exports more culture to any single country in the Western world than it adopts. This includes attitudes at times.

Some countries are more ""resistant"" to this than others, often due language barriers and size of population.

The whole ""it's a fantasy"" has nothing to do with what I said. My claim wasn't that people are running around the streets trying to be John Wayne or Iron man."
television,fe07yyh,t1_fdzri5y,1578805499.0,"It's not about consciously emulating them.

If kids repeatedly see something in movies, they are more likely to adopt it, and it becomes the future cultural norm. American values, ""speedos are gross"" being one of them, will eventually seep into their minds to some extent.

English proficiency certainly facilitates the osmosis, but even without dubbing is a thing. Sure, the bigger the country and their population, the more insular they can act, to some extent isolating themselves from some of this (Germans and French often seem like they have their own internet, though less now than in the past).

Then there's the more deliberate part of American culture/politics being consciously exported. See for instance people like Steve Bannon lending his ""support"" to far right European parties."
television,fdxp3th,t1_fdxnhzy,1578771410.0,"Because USA is the dominant culteral entity of the Western World. We watch a lot of American series, movies, play American games, listen to American music, follow American politics. Cultural osmosis is gonna happen."

Ironically the only people pushing a far right islamist agenda in the US are largely far right Christian politicians.

Ridiculing muslims in the US is essentially turning a minority into a punching bag and enabling racists.
