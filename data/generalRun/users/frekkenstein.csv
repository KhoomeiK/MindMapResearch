ForwardsFromKlandma,fficdqw,t1_ffiay9i,1579970517.0,I’ve got a good friend who jokes about not having a father and invites people to make fun of him. Not sure if that’s a coping mechanism or what. But he just put himself through nursing school and killed it. He’s incredibly smart and straight.
ForwardsFromKlandma,ffgq5mo,t1_ffgprnx,1579912231.0,And... not black? I get a feeling they were also jabbing at black fathers whom they assume are always absent.
ForwardsFromKlandma,ffg8b7w,t1_ffg88nu,1579900628.0,That’s awesome to hear.
ForwardsFromKlandma,ffg7nwh,t1_ffg7jos,1579900225.0,How did they respond when he came out? I’m genuinely curious while trying to not make assumptions.. :/
ForwardsFromKlandma,ffg1kt7,t1_ffg1hdg,1579896471.0,I dunno. Probably a bunch of dudes about to go out and wanted a group photo.
ForwardsFromKlandma,ffg0zr6,t1_fffu0oc,1579896111.0,Is that like a 100% chance? If so I have some news to give a lot of friends.

insaneparents,fffnjdz,t1_ffemqoa,1579887782.0,"I worked in the ER for a few years. I was always told Tamiflu doesn’t fight the flu, but treats the symptoms. I’m not sure why they would tell this mother her child would die without it. Can someone explain?"

shecame,fezkwkl,t1_fex2kqy,1579458413.0,I dunno. But I’ll give her a hand if she needs it.

Learn. Your. Money. Even if you have a joint account and they handle it, learn all the passwords to accounts and log in at least every pay day.

Also, date someone longer than 2 weeks before marriage. I made that mistake the first time. I’m waiting 6 months on this marriage.

RoastMe,fdjwx83,t3_elgyde,1578490122.0,It’s ok. You’ll have less beard to clean cum out of during station sleep overs.
happy,fdg38w7,t1_fdcigiz,1578378363.0,Thanks! It’s definitely been a long road I never thought I would navigate and come out alive. There were some touch and go moments for sure. But I have had an amazing support system to pull my ass along; reddit being one of them.
