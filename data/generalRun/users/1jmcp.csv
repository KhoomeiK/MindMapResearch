DOG,fh6nutc,t3_f1h5or,1581302127.0,"What a precious face.  Your love for her comes blasting off the page. Weather through the week as best you can, as no words or happy memories will soothe yet. But Zoie will always live within you, and would hate to see you in distress, so make it brief...   You’re not ready for this yet, but so many dogs need a loving home.  You’ll have a great time taking your next dog to Zoie’s favorite places, and telling stories of a legendary dog."
