Our pain and what it reacts to, and on a larger scale our needs, are individual.   Take the list as suggestions if she doesn't know what she needs (but note usually a firmer matress is better and don't buy without her!).  We can't assess her cause of pain to know what helps and even then we won't necessarily be spot on.

Definitely look for hybrids that are indica dominant.  They won't make you sleep, might even give you energy, but won't make you anxious!  Talk to the people at your dispensaries and fill them in on what you're dealing with.  I usually vape mine, but you could just buy a half gram preroll of what they suggest and take 4-6 hits off it and see how you feel .  It won't be enough to put you in a panic attack but enough to see some pain benefits. Also if you notice any increase uneasy feeling you know that's not your strain and you're only out $8 or less usually. 

That's how I started out figuring out what works for me.  I'd buy 2 or 3 prerolls at a time and pay attention to how I felt.  Some strains did nothing for me at all, a few were outright winners!

I imagine it will be similar, you'll learn some coping skills, learn ways to maybe communicate with your mother in a more effective way, and learn to reframe your trauma (I'm assuming you've experienced trauma because that's usually the root in these experiences. If I'm wrong, I apologize.  Also, this isn't me prying into your trauma, that's for you to disclose or not at your comfort).  

I know what it's like to have a strained relationship with your parents.  My biological parents are very much narcissists and my step parents both enable the bios and exhibit narcissistic personality behaviors.  It's... Challenging.  I'm 35 so I was able to completely disconnect from them several years ago. Best decision I could have made.  I know that's not an option at 15,but you do have options if you're dealing with those types of parents.  I would highly suggest r/raisedbynarcissits if you feel your mother may be that way and even if not they have resources for dealing with the situation in a more peaceful way until you're able to leave.  Distance helps a lot.

I'm proud of you for sticking it out.  Life can be really really hard sometimes and if feels like it piles on.  I would highly suggest you lean into the hobbies right now as you're in a vulnerable state.  Maybe take up a drawing style, or painting, or crafting, or knit/crochet.  Artistic/creative hobbies are great because they occupy your mind greatly. Especially learning a new skill. It can be awesome during times of intrusive thoughts.  Athletic hobbies are great for high stress/high anxiety because they boost endorphins and supply a safe release.  I used to go for a run anytime I felt overwhelmed and it helped a ton.

RBI,ffeok05,t1_ffek76r,1579857504.0,"That's alright, I don't use fb right now. I still have a profile, but I don't use it.  I was just trying to see what was going on outside of that picture (it's been posted all over Reddit so I knew what you were talking about).  I was hoping to find screenshots on Google but not a ton of luck. Her name isn't particularly unheard of, the spelling is a little off. 

 Honestly, I don't necessarily know that the person in that picture is the same person posting gross cp type stuff.  I saw variations on the first name come up with the last name and I'm wondering if it's maybe someone setting out to ruin someone's life.  It sounds like you've seen more than me, so of course correct me.  I don't see anything wrong with taking a bath with your preschooler.  I see it as a possibility that she took a bath with her kid, tried to turn to grab her phone or anything else and he used her butt as a foot rest, she thought it was funny and posted it or sent it to someone or even it went to cloud storage. Someone could then take that picture, make some profiles and put the gross caption about sexual contact.

As for the daughter, if that's an actual picture of her child and if she's also identifiable in the picture, it could be out of context. I know it sounds crazy and I wouldn't say anything but I have had to send a doctor an unfortunate picture because of a problem with my child when the child was very young. The doctor asked for 3 specific things in the pictures, sent through the patient portal to determine if an immediate appointment was necessary or if we could schedule in a few days.    My child's father and I weren't together at the time, but when we reunited he came across the picture in my cloud storage.   Appropriately, he was angry and confused.  I had to explain and show him the emails. I just didn't even consider cloud storage.

Obviously it depends on what exactly is in the pictures and the staging I guess.  If the child had any rashes especially, I would assume that's the context.  Even in mom Facebook groups people often post censored pictures to play guess that rash basically if traditional treatments aren't working.    

My hope really is that this someone trying to destroy the reputation and character of the woman in the picture.  No matter whats happening, whoever is posting those captions and images doesn't need to be around anyone's child.   It could even be a father of the child/ren trying to obtain custody, much like how some mothers will falsely accuse fathers of molestation."

RBI,ffbaw4q,t1_ffbadph,1579757905.0,"So basically what happens when you're dealing with commercial delivery scams is a company sends you boxes of whatever with tracking provided.  They may do this once or multiple times.  Eventually they send an invoice.  This invoice will include every tracking number for every package, or several individual invoices.   The hope is that the company just pays the invoice, assuming it's a different regular delivery or just because it looks legit.  If they don't pay, the scamming party will send a demand letter and the invoice again, now the company checks the tracking numbers and sees these are definitely delivered packages to their office, so the odds of paying increase. If the business still doesn't pay, the scamming party may threaten legal action.  Lawyers and court costs would be much more than the invoice, so again odds increase.  They don't actually sue the business, but they will escalate the threats of legal actions and either eventually get paid or give up.

With personal delivery scams, it's usually more minor.  You order something and get an empty box, but not much room for recourse because tracking shows a delivered package with the appropriate weight (because you can put any weight on a package when printing shipping labels at home and it's only ever caught if the package is heavier than it should be, not lighter).

You try to make things right (much more than just a verbal apology) where it won't cause harm.

ChronicPain,ff5brxx,t3_erow6h,1579586501.0,"In my experience, the level you need is really personal.  For instance, if you have a healthy nervous system you will be fine with a less intense unit.  If you have nerve damage or spinal cord damage, you may need a more powerful unit.

A TENS unit it meant to interrupt nerve signals, essential interrupting the brains ability to recieved and process pain signals.

It WILL NOT stop full body pain.  It *can* lessen localized pain of certain types.   You typically have 2-4 electrodes and you place them on either side of the specific pain.  In theory, it will interrupt the pain signals from that area.  In reality, it will block *some* of the pain signals in that area


Also, for anyone considering a TENS unit, consider the price of the electrodes. They are adhesive and will need to be replaced regularly (how often depends on usage but expect every 3 months minimum if using 3-5 times a week).  Most can be ""washed"" with cool water and friction from your fingers rubbing off body oils but you cannot use soap. Soap will make the adhesive ineffective. 


I use the Omron Max Power Relief, it's got much bigger electrodes than I'm used to - which is great unless you're treating wrist/elbow pain - and they have a longer life. They're supposed to last 5 months. I suggest keeping an extra set on hand just in case.  I have a spinal cord injury and some localized nerve damage as well in other areas.  It's powerful enough for me and it comes with several modes.  Each mode deliverd a different type of pulse.  It has a 15 minute cycle and automatically shuts off.   It takes trial and error to find the right mode and intensity to treat each area."

I'd also like to add that I'm glad you went back and paid, as it probably wasn't your techs child.  Depending on if she's hourly or independent, she may have been forced to pay for the service out of her check or just lose the income for the time used on your service.  Definitely good that you paid either way as it was the right thing to do."

I would have never bought this palette because drug store eyeshadow is usually such shit.  This dude though... If it didn't smell fruity it would be perfect.
