depression,fcorowt,t3_eibb6g,1577839738.0,"Last summer I was on vacation in Germany. I have a bad posture and Im sensitive on the subject. While I was returning from the market near the hotel, there were 2 kids on the other side if the street (I was waiting for the traffic light) who looked directly at me, made a bad posture and started making faces and laughing at me. It ruined my whole day and still bothers me. 

It’s not only that, when somebody walks past me on the street I can see that they laugh and sometimes turn back and point at me (if they are with a friend). Sometimes I feel like Im the town’s freak."
