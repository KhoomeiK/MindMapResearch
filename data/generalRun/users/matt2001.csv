Since buying my model 3 about 1 year ago, I put 20,000 mi on it including a coast to coast 10,000 mi trip last summer. This is something I would have never considered in a traditional auto."

exmormon,fegx223,t3_eounef,1579104450.0,"I wonder if they study Immanuel Kant in philosophy? He wrote this in 1784.

\-----------------

Immanuel Kant

""An Answer to the Question: What is Enlightenment?""

(Was ist Äufklarung?)

(30 September, 1784)

**Enlightenment is man's release from his self-incurred immaturity. Immaturity is man's inability to make use of his understanding without direction from another.** This immaturity is self-imposed when its cause lies not in lack of reason but in lack of resolution and courage to use it without direction from another. Sapere aude! ""Have courage to use your own reason!"" -- that is the motto of enlightenment.

**Laziness and cowardice are the reasons why** so great a portion of mankind, after nature has long since discharged them from external direction (naturaliter maiorennes \[those who come of age by virtue of nature\]), nevertheless remains under lifelong tutelage, and **why it is so easy for others to set themselves up as their guardians.** It is so easy not to be of age. If I have a book that understands for me, a pastor who has a conscience for me, a physician who decides my diet, and so forth, I need not trouble myself. I need not think, if I can only pay -- others will easily undertake the irksome work for me. That the step to competence is held to be very dangerous by the far greater portion of mankind (and by the entire fair sex) -- quite apart from its being arduous is seen to by those guardians who have so kindly assumed superintendence over them. **After the guardians have first made their domestic cattle dumb and have made sure that these placid creatures will not dare take a single step without the harness of the cart to which they are tethered, the guardians then show them the danger which threatens if they try to go alone. Actually, however, this danger is not so great, for by falling a few times they would finally learn to walk alone. But an example of this failure makes them timid and ordinarily frightens them away from all further trials.**

teslamotors,fedd9ju,t3_eol3tx,1579008251.0,">Our research shows that non-exhaust particles have the potential to be as detrimental to our health as exhaust emissions. Brake dust is a major component of air pollution, contributing up to 20% of traffic-related particles. This number is only expected to increase as policies and technologies being introduced focus only on reducing exhaust emissions. While reductions in exhaust emissions are an important aim for public health, our findings show that we need ways to reduce non-exhaust pollutants, like brake dust, too.

It would be interesting to compare electric vs ICE autos for the amount of emitted brake dust. I hardly use my brakes at all in my model 3."
