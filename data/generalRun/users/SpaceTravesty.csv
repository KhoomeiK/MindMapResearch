One of those key differences being that Biden did what he did to advance the policy interests of the US as opposed to helping himself get re-elected or to help his family.

It was the expressed policy of the US at the time (not just Biden’s personal desire) that the prosecutor in question be removed because he was intentionally hindering anti corruption efforts. Biden was acting as an agent of the president and advancing a legitimate US interest. Trump, on the other hand, was asking for a PR statement to help his re-election campaign. Trump explicitly asked for a public statement that Biden was being investigated, rather than an actual investigation, and even though Biden had already been exonerated.

Another key difference is that presidents are Constitutionally limited in why they can withhold aid authorized by Congress. Trump’s withholding violated the Constitutional requirements. Biden’s did not.

To my understanding, that's how a wide variety of discrimination cases work. It's a little different than a lot of other lawsuits, which are usually brought by private parties. Discrimination lawsuits are often brought by enforcement agencies (like the EEOC, for example). The defendant either starts working with the enforcement agency to settle, or they argue in court that the law doesn't apply to them for x y or z reason. If they lose a court case against the enforcing body, with the judge ruling that the law does apply, the enforcement agency will still often give the defendant the opportunity to make things right via a consent decree. I'd be tempted to call those former cases ""settling"" and the latter ""losing"", though I suppose you could refer to the latter as both. My former statement would thus have been more accurate had I said that the case was lost by Netflix, not *just* settled by them.

If you're interested in this type of thing, the EEOC publishes a selected case list that is quite informative. You can see that there are many cases on the list where the judge rules against the defendant on at least part of the case, and then a consent decree is entered into. A lot of the cases themselves are pretty interesting too.

>However, as exciting as that rollercoaster of a story is, it’s moot now. I found this:

Does that law explicitly carve out an exception to the ADA requirements?

You’re misconstruing my statement. The courts do decide libel cases, I agree. I want Facebook to be brought before courts, here, because I think Facebook’s actions facially, obvious meet the criteria for libel liability, and I think the courts will decide as much.

The reason I mentioned Facebook being informed is that such knowledge is part of the legal framework courts will use to decide whether Facebook’s actions are libelous.

When a statement is about a public figure, part of the legal framework is “actual malice” - ie, the defendant knowing the statement to be false or showing a reckless disregard for the truth when making the statement.

If thirty seconds of googling shows the statement to be untrue, ***and if Facebook has been told multiple times that the statement is untrue***, but they continue to make it in exchange for money, that’s likely to meet the actual malice requirement, making the statement libel."

No I’m not. I’m saying Facebook should be subjected to the exact same court system as their client when they make themselves party to their client’s act of libel by accepting money to amplify it.

If you paid me to go around shouting slanderous comments through a megaphone, and I knew the comments were slanderous (because I had been told) and kept doing it (and especially taking money for it), I could be sued for slander same as you. Facebook is engaged in the digital version of that same defamatory act. They are accepting money to spread defamation that they know is defamation. That is a tort, and they should be held accountable for it."
news,fdnelbf,t1_fdnb6sr,1578584147.0,"It’s not a good thing that they’re accepting money to spread libel. That’s ridiculous.

They need to fact check the attack ads they get paid for, or at least do a good job stopping them when informed they are libelous, or else face consequences for committing libel for hire.

It might be different if they were just letting people post their own political content on their own pages for free, unregulated, but they’re accepting money to plaster untrue attacks all over other users’ feeds."
news,fdne2ys,t1_fdnd3kp,1578583833.0,"I mean, Facebook does have the responsibility to take down libel that it is accepting money to circulate, once it has been duly informed that it is libel.

Problem is, it’s a tort, not a crime. So they only get held accountable if people sue. If we made mass paid libel a crime, they’d stop in a heartbeat."
