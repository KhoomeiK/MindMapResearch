It's not a problem that ""I have"" with it, i don't have a conviction or prejudice, i just merely describe what it is objectively in the real world. In that sense, you're really arguing against reality itself, not some guy that has some beliefs. What this means is that no matter the outcome of this conversation and which one of us the ""jury"" deems right, nature wouldn't magically accept homosexuality as a normal part of life, because, as  i've already illustrated in my example with the 2 distinct populations, the homosexual group would still just go extinct."

Whether actual homosexuality is genetic or not is very irrelevant. Cancer, diabetes, countless of other conditions are also genetic, but you don't consider them normal, do you?

And yea, homosexuality does exist - humans do it, monkeys do it. How the hell should i know what's in the mind of a monkey - they probably see a fuck hole and go for it. With humans - we have higher intellect and can make conscious choices. For example - don't eat turds like dogs do. Are you going to argue that turd eating is perfectly normal, cuz some animal does it?

Both populations benefit from equal and perfect conditions like weather, food, etc. One of them will perish in \~70 years, other will thrive and carry on for many, many generations spanning thousands or hundreds of thousands of years.

So while it is a choice of being gay, and that by itself is none of anyone's concern - it's their choice, that doesn't necessary mean it's the sanest choice a rational being can make. Therefore, it's only natural for that person to have a hard time being something that really doesn't work out in the long run. And yes - this country is far more intolerable and primitive than the rest of the civilized ones, frankly - it's a retarded country, but even in a place like Sweden, Canada, or USA (sans Alabama/Texas), where he will find tons of support and nourishment, the outcome for him will inevitably lead to the termination of his bloodline and 0 legacy."

\> Good puppetry captures imagination

Huge practical benefit of puppetry is for actor performance. I can't imagine how hard is to act against a guy in green spandex and dots on his face compared to something that looks like the actual creature."

Not saying that this this Yoda is ultra real or better than puppets. Point was - CGI trumps practical if done right and by great talents, which in the case of the Mandalorian was obviously not the prime objective. Most CGI sucks and can easily be outdone by practical, yes."

television,fcncdh7,t3_ei3wjy,1577808663.0,"No, you don't. There are awesome examples of incredible CGI characters which no puppetry can ever match. Problem with baby Yoda was that it's a TV show and its budget can't possibly compare to that of feature films, thus, the awesome talent that can pull a believable performance is out of reach. It's simple as that.

Then again, never even for once i took issue with the level of CGI in that series as the story being told was just so great that it took you in.

In summary: stop nitpicking this that are good enough just the way they were made."
