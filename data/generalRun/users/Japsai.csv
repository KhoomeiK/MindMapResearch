Particularly as the other points have some descriptor to show they are unpleasant. 'icehead', 'derro'. In that context, 'indigenous' as the sole descriptor on that point, becomes the undesirable part. And that is not cool"

facepalm,ff5u3cc,t1_ff5tupn,1579610281.0,"Yes agreed. But we're nowhere near there yet. Currently there is a massive bias *against* women in some of these organisations, and that needs to be addressed by a variety of means. If one day we have a level playing field, the *actual* number of women or men won't matter. Do you really think the current overwhelming imbalance of males to females in senior roles is just because men are intrinsically better at the jobs?"
facepalm,ff5tq4g,t1_ff5t39o,1579609893.0,They had had only men. They were previously looking for the best *man* for the job and had to be told off and sent to find a woman this time. How else will they learn?
facepalm,ff5tlsn,t1_ff5tabv,1579609765.0,"Sometimes. And sometimes they get branded soft for showing a 'feminine side' and sometimes they're reviled and labelled 'iron lady' for showing 'masculine' traits. Sometimes they're just called a witch, because it rhymes with bitch, but isn't as offensive to print."
facepalm,ff5tdom,t1_ff5sw2a,1579609523.0,"Three things.

One: any company wanting the best talent is idiotic if it excludes half the talent pool. Getting the biggest talent pool matters
 
Two: studies show over and over (please don't make me find them, it's late here) that diversity leads directly to increased profitability. Getting many different types of people with different perspectives and ideas matters in a tough industry

Three: it's not about women not 'stepping up'. It's about the climate that makes them feel unwelcome and unable to apply. And about male hiring managers (and even female hiring managers sometimes) sub-consciously valuing a male over a female by default because of perceived reliability and the false attitude that stereotypically male traits suit senior positions better. Addressing unconscious prejudice matters."
facepalm,ff5ss09,t1_ff5acc8,1579608867.0,"They had an unwritten exclusion policy in place long before they looked to hire a woman. That's why they had almost no women in management.

 It's why they tried to rectify the situation. Clearly they weren't ready to change that policy. It's changing a little now and they have over 20% women senior roles (still dire)."
facepalm,ff5sgcc,t1_ff5op9b,1579608511.0,"It really isn't. Until we have equality the idea of 'female privilege and entitlement' is ridiculous. 

What has always happened is that there has been an exclusionary unwritten policy that means women haven't got the job. Quotas aren't a sole solution, but sometimes you need to start with a blunt instrument just to kick-start the evening the playing field. To clear a path through the prejudice so that skilled women get the jobs they deserve. Once you have some women seen to be doing a great job the culture starts to change and you can relax the quotas.

Of course the first women in management positions in an organisation have an uphill battle as the boys' club closes ranks. Other measures are also needed."
