solipsism,fdafcc7,t1_fd91din,1578245455.0,"I largely agree with what you are saying.  Solipsism has a very limited practical application.  I endorse it as an interesting concept on the basis that it is the foundation to most eastern religions (for Hindus, the world = the Maya), and many western philosophers have reached similar conclusions. 

Btw, by “solipsism” I mean that the world is imaginary, or at least that the way the world is constructed for us by our brains is arbitrary.  Anyone who disagrees with the foundations of science (our 5 senses give us an accurate picture of the world) are labelled ‘solipsist de facto’ and I accept the label."

solipsism,fd6yu1u,t1_fd1rd03,1578197409.0,"I think the best argument against solipsism is exactly the one that you are using; solipsism is a linguist irregularity.  You and I are different people, and if we define you and I as the same person our conversation will quickly become confusing.  Likewise, there is a difference between things that are imaginary (Santa Clause) and things that are real (my neighbours giant Santa ballon).  If we are to say that the world is imaginary, we will have to redefine other aspects of our world with the risk that people might end up thinking Santa is really real.

This is my response: “Language doesn’t change reality” - Ayn Rand.  Just because a certain way of speaking is inconvenient in our present mindset doesn’t mean it is unworkable in all scenarios.  Russellian set theory has never been refuted.  What’s more, If we examine the rules of language closely, Wittgenstein will show us that “the solipsists are correct, only there position cannot be explained, it can only be shown.”

Also, as Bill Hicks will tell you, 5 grams of dried magic mushrooms will squeegee your 3rd eye crystal clear."
