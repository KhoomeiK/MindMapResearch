The Karoo's are better, but then again, I have not tried any other."

Kayaking,fcybg2w,t3_ej9jzj,1578077658.0,"I bought a kayak through a group buy from Alibaba.  A guy took orders and filled 5 20ft containers.
The company has a good website, but the cost of freight when buying only one boat means you can probably get something that you can look at and test before buying where you live, and for a similar price.
I am quite satisfied with my boat, it came with a rudder and a seat plus the oar.  But it is a bit flat so it starts filling when it is choppy.
