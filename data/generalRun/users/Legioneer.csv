CallOfDuty,ff8leju,t1_ff84rr2,1579684203.0,"The Zombies community currently isn’t thriving, but that isn’t because BO3 wasn’t good. It’s widely considered the best Zombies game, it’s just that playing the same maps for 4 years (knowing the game will no longer be updated) gives major burnout.

The community regularly drops off during Treyarch’s off-season, but with BO4 being the general disappointment it was and MW not containing a Zombies variant, the community hasn’t had much opportunity for growth, compared to the golden days of BO3’s season/Chronicles. The YouTubers took off, but only after the BO4 hype died, which doesn’t say anything about BO3.

If you think the Zombies mode in BO3 needed Chronicles to “save” it, you’re insane. The community was the biggest it had ever been, and Chronicles just made it even bigger (and turned BO3 into the definitive Zombies game)."
CODZombies,ff3cm61,t1_ff32ur9,1579538483.0,"Completely agree, that maps always deserve a few tries before judgements should be made. 

I respect your opinion about the map. I didn’t find AO highly entertaining either, so I can understand how you feel. I feel that way for most BO4 maps honestly."
CODZombies,ff320p1,t1_ff31awa,1579531599.0,"I didn’t say I thought it was the only time you tried it. It’s just that you were using a specific example where that **was** the only time you had tried it. I don’t personally feel that saying you were bored by round 6 on your first attempt really says much about the map. 

I find being consistently bored with it regardless of how much you play it (which is your experience of the map) is much more of a problem."
CODZombies,ff300zi,t1_ff2wfx3,1579529987.0,"I can understand being bored by it, but I’m not sure that playing one game of a map and making it to round 6 is giving it a fair chance. I know I personally find a lot of maps’ early set ups to be boring as hell, but I like almost every map once I get past that point."
Australia_,fekdcn3,t3_ephown,1579197676.0,"They found Naegleria Fowleri, an amoeba that lives in warm and slow flowing freshwater. You might see warnings about it posted around hot springs and natural spas. 

If water containing N. Fowleri were forcibly injected up the nose (especially in children), it can travel up the nasal nerves to the brain, where it will attack the nervous tissue, causing severe inflammation (amoebic meningitis).

Symptoms are similar to other forms of meningitis (specifically a severe headache, fever, and stiff neck), occurring around 5 days after water exposure. 

The condition is essentially certain death, as the amoeba has bypassed all of your brain’s natural defences and leaves your body with no way to fight back.

N. Fowleri is actually surprisingly common in warmer bodies of water across the globe, but infection is exceedingly rare. Still, it is best to avoid getting freshwater forced up your nose, especially in the summer months when the amoeba is more active."

facepalm,fdhj0q8,t1_fdhitmv,1578423672.0,So they are aiming for sheep to die (assuming “not existing at all” is extinction). Forgive me for not finding that to be righteous and moral.
facepalm,fdhhn3m,t1_fdhgsn8,1578422837.0,"Yes, which is why we need to keep shearing them (though living like that for 6 years in Australia of all places doesn’t really help PETA’s point about heat exhaustion). 

I appreciate you addressing the actual point that PETA and the initial commenter we’re making, and not going off on a tangent like the previous commenter."
facepalm,fdhgt6n,t1_fdhbq1x,1578422339.0,"The moral benefit is entirely subjective though. Animals we farm tend to be prey, so morally I’d find it questionable to send them off to their death in the wild, or drive them to extinction. I think there are a lot of refinements that could be made to the industry, and I’d consider them to be much more of a net positive morally.

Though personally, I don’t find the concept of farming (looking after an animal and using it for a service) as inherently immoral. Obviously in practice it can get quite bad, but fixing those problems seems more reasonable than tearing it all down, personally."
facepalm,fdhf53s,t1_fdhar5v,1578421335.0,"I’m not against gradually phasing our the factory farm industry through reduced demand. However, you’re crazy if you think that a dairy producer shutting down is “sparing” those animals. They’d either be sold for a profit (alive to other parts of the dairy industry, or as meat) or die from predation/starvation/dehydration after humans stop providing for them. 

They will be killed for their meat regardless of whether we do it, or some other predator does. They are prey."
facepalm,fdhe5h7,t1_fdhb637,1578420749.0,"Of course. But this person was specifically criticising another person for “missing the point” while going off on this tangent (as if it was the “real” point PETA was making). PETA’s statement was pretty clear, they think that the wool produced by domesticated sheep kills them. 

That was the core idea, and to chastise someone for talking about that instead of a side point is missing the point yourself."
facepalm,fdhcojp,t1_fdhc0yf,1578420012.0,"You realise that the comment I was responding to has no option that didn’t result in all sheep being killed, right? So yes, in that response, I do have the idea that the person I was responding to was advocating for killing every single sheep. Maybe not in a single day, but seemingly relatively quickly, given they didn’t want to breed any more sheep into the farms.

What you’re advocating is very different, though it still relies on the gradual removal of the sheep industry, which (while that isn’t a problem) is going to take a while. It’s actually pretty similar to my proposal, which was essentially “phase out meat, then refine wool to minimise impact over time”."
facepalm,fdhbieo,t1_fdhapat,1578419413.0,"Stay realistic? These people are talking about completely dismantling the entire wool industry, but my proposal of still using the wool and keeping the sheep to old age (there’d need to be some way to incentivise it, but I find that fairly reasonable as a hypothetical) is unrealistic?

I think killing all the sheep now (like was proposed) is vastly less profitable than continuing the wool industry without the sheep meat industry, but maybe you don’t agree with that."
facepalm,fdh9r77,t1_fdh9kn7,1578418441.0,"You realise I am not the same person that has been responding to you previously in this chain, right? I’m just saying that I disagree with your assertion that they are missing a logical step in their assessment of PETA’s position."
facepalm,fdh9j4u,t1_fdh8ajl,1578418304.0,"“Killing them” is the logical progression of their advocated position. Those are literally the options they provided me. Both Option A and Option B result in sheep being killed, and they are clearly advocating for Option B specifically (as they are arguing against Option A and presented Option B as the alternative).

The benefit gained from no longer farming sheep is also less than the cost, and would therefore never be done, so what exactly is your position here?"
facepalm,fdh8x4s,t1_fdh8698,1578417936.0,"But you are telling this commenter they missed a logical step when they didn’t. PETA cannot simultaneously claim that overgrown wool on sheep is killing them, while also being anti-shearing (or pro-releasing to the wild) unless they are aiming for sheep to die. Is that not true?"
facepalm,fdh7rt6,t1_fdh70fl,1578417220.0,"Surely having farmers not squeeze every single penny out of their sheep is a more realistic goal than the complete and utter destruction of the wool/sheep meat industry? 

You keep talking about “if people stop buying wool and meat, this would happen” but when I provide my own hypothetical (with better outcomes for everybody) you’re suddenly concerned about what’s realistic? Some kind of monetary incentive to run a sheep sanctuary that looks as/more appealing than the profits from mutton would be all it takes, even assuming that everyone is purely motivated by money."
facepalm,fdh6i7l,t1_fdh698l,1578416430.0,"I just find it laughable that in your quest to improve the quality of life for sheep, you advocate killing them all as your only option. Why not advocate farming them ethically, shearing them for their wool, and simply not killing them for meat when they get too old? That’s another option surely?"
facepalm,fdh6885,t1_fdh55yn,1578416258.0,">The idea would be to steadily reduce flock sizes by reducing breeding, until the breed is at a lower population level capable of sustaining itself naturally. 

But PETA specifically argues that they **can’t** sustain themselves naturally as they would need to be sheared to stay alive. If they really believe that, they logically shouldn’t support your plan."
facepalm,fdh5tt3,t1_fdh5kgs,1578416013.0,"First of all, that’s a very large if. Secondly, that doesn’t exactly change what will inevitably happen to the sheep we currently have if that situation were to arise (either die at our hand or because they are domesticated animals that would likely not thrive easily without assistance). You are against sheep dying, but seem to be arguing for a solution that kills them anyway."
facepalm,fdh5f5y,t1_fdh3yqn,1578415765.0,"Farming a sheep for meat and farming for wool are different ethical questions that are not equivalent. But, even then, the same reasoning could be applied if people were to stop buying wool. It’d not be profitable anymore, and they’d be killed. I don’t see that as a good solution, do you?"
facepalm,fdh1ifa,t1_fdh089m,1578413346.0,"If (hypothetically) people stopped buying wool, I can’t imagine that would end well for the sheep we currently have.

They’re protected against predators and disease, and have lifespans similar to their wild counterparts from my quick google search."
facepalm,fdh0y3d,t1_fdgzs1d,1578412988.0,"There you go, actually discussing the issue at hand rather than a random tangent. I’d still have to argue that PETA seems to be specifically referring to heat exhaustion related deaths here (as opposed to what I agree is a much more common concern of flystrike), so they’re still not really making the right point here.

It’s also notable that flystrike is most easily preventable by human intervention like regular shearing, and so it comes back around to the issue of “this is why shearing sheep is a good thing”."
facepalm,fdgzghd,t1_fdgxbon,1578412039.0,"I feel like it’s you missing the point. 

Even if the production of wool is a highly unnatural, selectively bred trait, PETA is alleging that this amount of wool causes discomfort to and kills the sheep. That’s the main point PETA is making, and the main point of contention the comment you are replying to has with them, yet you don’t comment on it at all.

Why aren’t you focusing on that, rather than on a passing mention of whether selective breeding is “natural” or not?"

thanosdidnothingwrong,fd2x85p,t1_fd2smd8,1578152555.0,"You are proposing the US essentially shut down all diplomacy in the area because terrorists want them to.

>America is already bombing civillians, this will just get more attention when you inevitably do it. 

So Russia and North Korea can already say what you were worried about them saying. And they would be dumb to suggest that, as they're perfectly aware that war comes with civilian casualties (just ask Russia about Crimea).
