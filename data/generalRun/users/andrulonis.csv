EscapefromTarkov,ff7dsvb,t1_ff79lh1,1579647236.0,"Thing was mostly about those small containers for items that you can fit Into 2x2 alpha so a wallet, keytool, docs case etc"
EscapefromTarkov,ff73e2h,t1_ff6uijw,1579640321.0,fine just wanted to know estimated value is it like i need to grind for it for 1M or is it affordable on the spot thanks

EscapefromTarkov,ff5cx95,t1_ff4gcz6,1579587709.0,What can you fit in a Docs case? Cause i think when i get to flea market i would like to buy both keytool and the docs case (how expensive are they?)
EscapefromTarkov,ff5cute,t1_ff4gnhd,1579587637.0,I believe all are for 4 slots so i can fit them

EscapefromTarkov,ff3xz32,t1_ff3c5wl,1579551298.0,Is there any list of such items from when you could get them? Or maybe are there any available to obtain right now? Or idk codes that sb has for them or however it works? Would be just nice to get a bit headstart each wipe thats why
EscapefromTarkov,ff3xtoq,t1_ff3aey4,1579551206.0,"Yeah, pretty much what you do, and then buy some lodouts for 150k max and you will be fine or use the scav loadout parts you get to minimize money spent"
EscapefromTarkov,ff38e3i,t3_eou68u,1579536118.0,"I know the wipes exist and are like 3 months apart. But are there any items that you can actually keep like a christmas ones? (I didnt play then so i dont know what that was or how it works, i only heard there is something like this)"
EscapefromTarkov,ff389nt,t1_ff37j4y,1579536036.0,"I am kinda new as well so i may actually give you some hints „on the level” as i find some tactics nice. Do a scav run, if you have a nice weapon like mosin or some AK just slap a nice cheap optic on it, add a helmet if you dont have it already (the penis one as i heard how people call it) buy the headphones from ragman and i guess some armor if you dont have it already as well. You can load some hard ammo to it so you actually can kill a high loot guy. I guess thats everything. Also you can use a balaclava so your white ass face doesnt stick out so much if you play on very treeish map"
