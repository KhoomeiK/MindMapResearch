imaginarymaps,ffnhm5u,t3_eub56s,1580066095.0,"So, how did I do? I improved my [previous](https://www.reddit.com/r/imaginarymaps/comments/etxlqf/my_first_attempt_at_a_sortofbutnotreally/) map a bit so that it'd be readable, also I've added capitals (their names are based on in-game provinces names') and also drew borders between countries. I did make smaller changes too and most islands are ""attached"" to who they are supposed to. I really hope I didn't miss anything. And I also hope that you'll like it!"
imaginarymaps,ffm2jcw,t1_ffju3gw,1580047520.0,"Yeah, now I'm planning to do that. I just thought that *maybe* there is an easier way. Maybe it's better that there's not."

imaginarymaps,ffjkppd,t1_ffjiyvi,1580000447.0,"Thanks for the templates, they look rather good (I will definitely have to find maps of the whole world though, I won't resist). I suppose, there isn't really an ""easy"" way of doing all that, at least not fast because it's not that hard really, just time-consuming. I'm probably gonna start a more ambitious project then, which is trying to make the borders from my game more realistic and make the actual world map. Curious how long it's gonna take.

By the way, what's the best way of doing borders? I mean mainly the colour, white or black is better?"
imaginarymaps,ffjeku2,t1_ffja2y4,1579996616.0,"Okay, first of all, thank you very much for such an in-depth comment. It definitely helps *a lot*. Now, I do realise that EU4 map isn't really that accurate depiction of the actual world map itself but ""transporting"" this kind of thing seems rather too hard for me (at least at my current stage of knowledge). Unless there's an easy way I don't know about (but I doubt there'd be).

I actually tried highlighting map a bit and it's ultimately better, so that in itself is rather good already.

One question about borders: can I make them with just a few ""clicks"" or do I actually have to literally draw them? I had to draw the ones for Prussia-Sweden itself to be able to distinguish it from the rest of the world but it took too much time and wasn't really effective. Is there a way of just doing it real quick? 

Same goes for cities/capitals, can I easily make them accurate or I have to choose more or less the locations myself? (I'm sorry if those questions are stupid but I really don't know much, yet, about this kinda stuff).

I know that borders look sometimes even hideous in these kinds of scenarios and I was thinking about ""correcting"" them but didn't know how exactly yet. But that's something I definitely will look into.

And well, I had trouble with that naming, somehow. I mean, I did a map based off of the very game which included only Prussia-Sweden itself but I tried to make it in German so, later on, I was confused as to what's the proper way of naming and this didn't sound *that* strange.

Thank you again, also for the recommendation of the sub. I didn't know that it existed so it's gonna be useful, definitely. Thank you."
imaginarymaps,ffj5m9t,t3_etxlqf,1579990993.0,"Hello, I've never posted here before so that's my first time. What I have posted here is a map of my last Ironman game of EU4 where I played Brandenburg -> Prussia -> Germany game and ended up doing this thing up above. I'll explain the title - I wanted to make this as realistic as I could with what I had (which wasn't much) and I realise it's not as readable but white font didn't seem ""realistic"". Now, the question I've got is: should I change it to a white font (well, some countries that is, like Portugal for instance) just so it looks better or maybe do something else? Basically, I'm asking for what I could do to improve this map in general. It's not the best and I really want to improve (this and also myself)."

eu4,ffhwvm8,t3_etqitl,1579957478.0,"R5: I won't be really going into much detail here. I played as Brandenburg into Prussia and eventually Germany game. I wasn't planning on unifying Germany at first so borders look a bit weird. I call it Prusso-Sweden for, of course, roleplay purposes but also because I got Sweden under PU in 1518 (somewhere around that date) and integrated them over 200 years later (they were really useful ""ally"") but they became integral part of my empire so I decided that instead of calling it Germany I'd ""form"" a dual monarchy consisting of Prussia and Sweden. The colonies were named like that because Prussia is still the ""main"" part of the empire. I didn't get much colonies as I didn't have the time for that. I never had any colonists. And while conquering India I finally learned what high overextension actually means. If you have any suggestions how could I improve the map itself (I think the font size mught be too wee), let me know. Also if coat of arms is any good (more in logical sense, I don't know much about heraldry and stuff)."

PS.

I also have somewhat weird view on the world - all the democracies and the governments look really weird and it's even ""unnatural"" to not have any monarch (it feel like I was literally taken out from 19th century Europe to 21st century one and I can't understand a thing). Also, the hatred towards the Germans without any particular reason (that reason could be WW2 but that's some time in the past anyway).
