investing,ffkjw7y,t3_eu1krj,1580023983.0,"Why would you sell it to a hedge fund if you are so sure if this strategy? Why not invest your own money (if that is possible)?

I don’t want to discourage you but I am like 99% sure the method you are talking about is already been used. It would be really hard for me digest then fact that some good data point is lying unnoticed out there and experts haven’t seen it already. If this is the case, go ahead and tread yourself. All the best dude.

TwoXChromosomes,ff4zkp8,t1_ff4ag1g,1579576271.0,This is a fucking joke. I hate American healthcare so much. There is no way you can justify costs of childbirth being 10k. Even in third world developing countries the costs are not this much.

It’s a shame cause many of them really liked Warren and she was their first choice but I think now take place has been taken by Bernie."

nyc,fe3802m,t1_fe2jddl,1578846853.0,Yeah I totally agree with you. Let’s start with the biggest welfare queens - the banks.

IndiaSpeaks,fdu2fie,t1_fdtxbpf,1578726321.0,"China’s economy is ~5 times the Indian economy. Also China has 228 supercomputers in top 500 while India is only 2. China is respected cause he has numbers to show. 

Take your head out of the ass and look what is happening here. You are not hearing about domestic awards cause they are not prestigious. Think of it as Usain Bolt vs Anil Prakash. There is no bias. I mean it’s peer reviewed world. You do something, you get verified by people all over the world. India is doing tremendous in space but we are lagging in other parts and there is clear data to show that. 

Also Nobel prize is awarded by Sweden and historically USA has dominated it. Let me tell you, USA and Sweden are very different."
IndiaSpeaks,fdtw8th,t1_fdtvxzt,1578723228.0,"Well I work with a lot of Chinese people and I wanna tell you that they don’t think about us. They compare themselves with USA. 

While Nobel is not perfect, what should be criteria in your opinion to gauge the achievements?"
IndiaSpeaks,fdtvcn1,t1_fdtub5o,1578722800.0,Yeah you are right. We are not focusing on our best universities. We are not giving them enough money.  Also we are politicizing 2nd and 3rd best universities of India. Aisa karoge to kya Khaak Nobel milega.
nyc,fdttw5t,t3_emz5ag,1578722132.0,Idkw but this is irritating me too much.
IndiaSpeaks,fdtsz8o,t3_en2n5o,1578721725.0,"Comparing Nobel with Shanti Swaroop Bhatnagar prize is like comparing Indian football team with Brazil’s football team. They are on another level. We should feel ashamed that our scientists are not winning enough awards. 

I just saw another post praising us Indians on discovering zero. If our ancestors come now they will be ashamed at our position in the world. Unhone itna bada kaam kiya but human bhi wahi baat Bolke seena Chauda kar rahe hai. 

We should definitely celebrate Nobel prize winners much more than national award winners. Don’t be salty that their political views don’t match yours."

india,fddxhu8,t1_fddx6nr,1578326366.0,You are absolutely right. Universities in US are much safer than in India. People don’t understand the gravity of this situation. I mean they won’t because they have been brainwashed to believe that JNU students are anti national. Lack of police action shows who is behind this attack. Sad day for Indian democracy.
india,fddtdfy,t1_fdcsggj,1578323482.0,This is not something special about RSS. Majority of the conservative parties tend to hate education sector cause they are liberal (which makes sense cause most of the students are young and they have new thoughts on how their world should look). For eg same talking points are used by conservatives here in US where they think all universities are liberal heaven.
nyc,fdccz4u,t3_ekecjq,1578271897.0,I only speak to them if they are asking for directions. Otherwise if a no from me dawg.

dankmemes,fcugk25,t1_fcug49h,1577980439.0,I tried watching his videos but to me he comes out as someone who is not genuinely interested in debate but interested in defeating their opponents. Then I saw his tweets on climate change. I found some of those tweets downright lunatic.
dankmemes,fcsroxn,t1_fcse1mf,1577923403.0,"They are like poles apart in US. If you are from US and think that Democrats and Republicans are similar then you are not paying attention. I don’t blame you just saying that even slightest attention to facts will prove how clusterfuck Republicans are here.

Edit: not from US. Just deeply interested in US politics."

india,fcsjond,t3_eifhqy,1577917919.0,"All the best dude. I really wanted to become an engineer. So I did what you are doing right now, studied on all festivals/vacations. Cleared JEE (mains was called AIEEE in those days) in second attempt with not so good rank(~3000). I didn’t get CS in IITK which was my dream. Anyways got into a IIT somehow and forgot about CS but destiny is sometimes very funny. Somehow my research in maths had some overlap with CS research (linear algebra related). Destiney played its role and I got to work with worlds top CS people in one of the FAANGs. I even recruited people from MIT, Stanford, CMU etc. 

So don’t think about what other people are doing. Try to get into one of the IITs. The exposure you get there and friends you make their are worth all the effort."
