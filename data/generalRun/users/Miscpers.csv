puppy101,ff780fx,t3_erye9s,1579642926.0,That's such a cool story. Props for listening to her as well. Well done pupper!
DeadBedrooms,ff3sqgl,t3_erhsq2,1579548038.0,"Just to play devil's advocate, the HL also vowed to be there for better or worse. Worse could mean.....no sex. Be that for a multitude of reasons.

Just to elaborate on the above, I'm not claiming people should stay married regardless (of no sex, cheating, etc) just because they vowed to. As many have pointed out, it's more complicated than boiling it down to vows.

I saw a post the other day where a husband had given one account, and failed to mention any of the reasons as to why the wife was LL. It makes me nervous that there are more instances from HL posters that disregard important factors contributing to the situation. I understand there will be scenarios where the HL partner will have done everything they can to be understanding and the LL partner might have resisted and not wanted to help themselves, the situation, or their partner...but I'm just wary,  particularly after that post I mentioned. There are always two sides to every story."
puppy101,ff0xeai,t3_er152x,1579473236.0,"Similar,  but he's not very good at solo play/entertaining himself at the moment.

6.30am        Wake up , outside for toilet, breakfast
6.40 - 7.15ish   Cuddles on the sofa while he chews his favourite toys
7.15 - 7.30   Walk round the block so he can go to the toilet and lots of sniffing,  exploring time
7.30 - 7.40    Treat ball 
7.40 - 7.50    Short training session/reinforcing basic commands
8am    Back to his bed, also given treats/kong. I go to work. 

Midday -   Dog walker comes, takes him for a walk and gives him lunch

5.30  - garden for toilet and tea time
6 - cuddles and playtime 
7PM- walk round the block for sniffing and toilet.
The rest of the evening I just alternate between treat ball,  playing, giving him a chew, etc. He sometimes naps but not as often these days as he grows and gets more energy. He also just tends to sleep most the day when I'm at work so doesn't need naps in the evening. 
9.30pm - bed time"
puppy101,feemz1h,t3_eoray1,1579037029.0,"He was actually pretty well behaved considering! He did the commands when I told him, and focused well when it was our turn to do something. It was just when the trainer came round and asked him at the start of the class to sit using a different command than he's used to (that was what prompted the ""he's going to be a handful"" comment""), and during the inbetween bits when we were waiting for our turn...but he wasn't barking, wasn't whining , just alternated between pulling on his lead to get to other puppies and pacing around a bit. Nothing too over the top, at least that's what I thought. So I'm just a bit baffled why out of all the puppies she said that about him?? :-(
Probably being over sensitive! Just really want to get it right."
puppy101,feem7kr,t1_feelw1t,1579036585.0,"That sounds ideal. I think what I was missing was just SOME kind of personalisation.  I'll give it a few more weeks and hopefully things will improve.

The main reason I'm taking him is to try and get him used to focusing when there are lots of distractions. If anything hopefully it'll be good for that."
MilitaryWives,feaydou,t3_eo9l3m,1578953509.0,"That sounds tough.....
Honestly, I can lose my patience a bit when I've been home alone for months and he nitpicks at something when he comes back, so I admire the fact you've not completely blown your lid about this issue yet.

I'd suggest if he's away and you need to make a decision about something, just make it. If he has an issue with it when he comes back, that's kind of tough. It's completely unrealistic to expect you to wait around to make a decision like whether to buy a specific lamp or not....

If he cares THAT much about the decor for a place he's not even going to be at that much, I hate to say it but then maybe he should change his priorities so that he's home more. Or loosen up a little and realise that you're the one living there 100% of the time so should get to feel comfortable in your own home. 

It's not like you don't comprise for his job....he should compromise over a few bits of furniture for Pete's sake."
relationships,fe6qyrp,t3_env0bu,1578901249.0,"Maybe not....but sounds like he might have IBS, and so digestive issues are a bit more of a common occurrence and something he's used to dealing with. 
If you've asked him not to overshare multiple times and he continues to ignore your request, let him know you're seriously considering ending the relationship because you're losing the attraction.
I like being comfortable enough in a relationship that you can openly talk about anything when necessary,  but wouldn't want to be talking about gross stuff constantly every day multiple times a day. I don't mind talking about it when there's an issue (which, if he has IBS, might actually be multiple times a day every day)...."
puppy101,fe5ion2,t3_ennk9s,1578869950.0,"Honestly, pretty much my whole time is dedicated to the pup when I'm not at work. I spend an hour and a half with him before I leave doing my best to bond and tire him out, then I spend 4 hours in the evening doing the same. Sometimes in the evening he'll nap for a little bit, but as he gets older the naps are less frequent. It's taking longer and longer to get him to settle, but usually by around 8/8.30pm he'll chill next to me on the sofa. Then I put him to bed at 9.30pm because I'm usually exhausted and need the half hour of me time in bed before I go to sleep.
I imagine it's a bit easier if there are two people sharing the load. With one person it's quite full on when they're puppies. My partner and I took 5 weeks off between us when we first got him to help build a routine and help him settle/get used to being left alone. My partner works away a lot though so most the time it's just me at home."
dogs,fdqe3ss,t3_emqkwq,1578664264.0,This is really sad :-( Sorry you're going through this.
dogs,fdqczch,t3_emnqy7,1578663355.0,"Pooper. He now responds to this as well as his actual name, if I call ""Pooooooper"" he comes running all happy and wiggly.
He had a bad stomach for about 2 weeks, and is still pooping an awful lot. We're going to try a different food next. Hence his nickname."
MilitaryWives,fdonjmh,t3_emgrvp,1578608785.0,"Keep yourself busy.
It's ok to rely on friends and family,  they love you and will want to support you.  It can do wonders having a nice day or evening out somewhere with a friend when you're feeling down. 
It's also ok to feel down and miss him, but don't let it beat you. Do what you need to do to get through it - spoil yourself with ice cream, cry, go out for a run or punish yourself at the gym. Then pull yourself out of it and get back to being busy, and distracting yourself, and looking forward to the good times you'll have when he's back.
Before he leaves, it might help to plan a few things to do together for when he gets back. Doesn't have to be exact dates as you might not know exactly when it will be, but have some activities or a place you both want to go to as a goal and something to help cheer you up when you're feeling down. 
It helps me to remind myself I'm my own person and I have my own life. Life doesn't stop when he's not here. I can cope. I try and put a positive spin on it - I have the best of both worlds, an amazing husband and we have the best time together when he's here , and then when he's gone I get to completely do my own thing (obviously within reason...silly things like watch whatever the heck I want on TV every night, and go out and see all my friends and spend lots of time with my family etc)"
puppy101,fdep43h,t3_ejqmxj,1578343680.0,"If I need to distract him while I eat or do a chore I use a ball that let's out treats if he rolls it around. I usually put some treats in that won't easily come out so it distracts him from anywhere between 5 minutes to around 15/20 mins.
If I'm cooking, a raw carrot or ice cubes are also good distractions"
puppy101,fdeojy1,t3_ejrtmk,1578343358.0,"We usually put our 4 month old to bed around 9.30pm
He has his tea between 6pm-6.30pm"
puppy101,fden535,t3_ekvvig,1578342528.0,"I get ready in my car! I can just about squeeze in a shower at 6.30am before I go downstairs to let him out and give him his breakfast.  I put my work clothes and everything else ready by the door.  Then I play/ train with puppy until 8am, put him in his room with a kong, quickly change in to work clothes on my way out and do my make up  in the car when I get to work"
dogs,fd4r2yi,t3_ejyiyu,1578170246.0,"He doesn't. He's only a puppy so isn't trusted out in the house unsupervised yet.  He's usually still sleeping in his bed at 6.30/7am until he hears us start to get up, and at that point he waits patiently at the baby gate until we get downstairs to let him out and give him his breakfast.  (I spy on him over the doggy cam)."
relationships,fd3a6jr,t3_ejxen4,1578156268.0,"It's dangerous going on holiday with friends. You never know how people will behave in new/different scenarios.
We went on a couples holiday with some friends once. Learnt pretty quickly we won't be in a rush to do it again any time soon. Nothing awful happened but we found out we have very different holiday styles and preferences that weren't very compatible (for example they didnt get out of bed until 12 - 1pm, whereas we liked to be up early making the most of the new country and the day......we only had one car between us so it made things pretty difficult....)

You have three options as far as I see it;
1. Suck it up and just deal with it for this trip, and then don't go on holiday with her ever again
2. Just be open and honest with her, tell her how you feel and suggest some things she could do that would help improve things for you
3. Just hang out with your other local friends/stop hanging out with her on this trip, then refer to the second part of number 1."
puppy101,fchq62p,t3_ehaayi,1577652961.0,"In that case it's probably because she's still so little and doesn't have full bladder control yet! I wouldn't worry too much, sounds like you're doing all the right things, the rest will probably come along with a few more weeks and better bladder capacity/control."
puppy101,fchdrh0,t3_ehaayi,1577649584.0,"What do you mean by ""she only goes in the right place when we are there""? Where do you put her when you aren't there? Is she crated or just left to free roam?
Puppies at 12 weeks shouldn't be left unsupervised unless they're crated/in a safe fenced off space. If you do that, it should help to minimise accidents.
I also had very high expectations but it does take a lot of time and patience. I've literally been watching my puppy like a halk when he isn't in his little room for about a month now, and he's only just stopped having accidents. It's been about a week now with no accidents but it's taken a lot of effort to get there and I make sure I take him out after eating, playing, naps, and then about every 40 mins to an hour inbetween if he's out and about in the house. He's just over 4 months now.

Top tips:
1. Keep puppy crated or in a pen unless you can be there to supervise
2. Learn puppy's cues and take them out the instant they start to sniff/circle etc
3. Lots of praise and a treat when they do get it right
4. If they have an accident, say ""no"" firmly and then take puppy outside. Clean up when they aren't there. 

Those are just a few things I picked up from here, and from researching."
puppy101,fc8xcpl,t3_egk4ap,1577543587.0,So cute! Glad you came through the other side and it's all worked out so perfectly :-)
relationships,fbvxu8q,t3_eeq5b1,1577137650.0,"I'd (F28) appreciate this! I sometimes struggle to know how to cheer people up or to know what to say, so I actually would genuinely find a list like this helpful if my partner ever felt like giving me one haha
The annoying (but not really) thing is he's usually amazing at consoling me, so I feel worse about not being able to do the same.
Go for it! And if he doesn't seem too keen pass it off as a joke"
