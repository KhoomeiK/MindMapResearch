Niflheim, the gigantic glacier of the north, slowly drifting south east cutting a gorge out of the mountain range as it passes. Within it, a network of thousands of natural tunnels, and hidden deep within it, Sebastian's tribe and his family home, Blackthorne Manor

&#x200B;

There the Blackthornes, Sebastian's parents, toiled their entire lives drilling into the deepest layers of the glacier. There, they found their boon. The remains of a Tarrasque.

&#x200B;

An ancient evil, an immortal beast of destruction, left beaten and torn apart in ancient elven ruins buried under miles of ice.  


They named her, Katha.  


The sages, in the hubris, removed it from the glacier and attempted to return it to it's former strength. But it was too much to contain, it broke out, and rampaged across the mountain range, making its way to population centers in the south. It left a trail of corpses in it's wake. Including Sebastian's sister. All of this unbeknownst to Sebastian, his parents ashamed of their mistake.

&#x200B;

They, recaptured it again and took it to the one place they were certain it could not escape from, the demonwoods. A forest out of time, where no man nor beast can ever escape entered.

&#x200B;

But this was yet another mistake of naivete. The demonwoods makes all beasts grow to enormous proportions, Tarrasques included. She grew to be 600ft tall, purple and with a small forest and ecosystem of dinosaurs on her back.

&#x200B;

As well, the experiments the sages had done to it to regenerate it's body, along with the growth of the demonwoods, gave it the ability to reproduce. The Blackthornes castrated it, hoping it would could not lay more, took the only surviving egg and fled deeper into the demonwoods before hiding within a containment orb until their discovery.

&#x200B;

Inside, the child, or more accurately, the clone, tarrasque was trained to be tame in hopes it would defeat it's mother. They named him Dutch.

&#x200B;

Following their trail for two years, and nearly being killed by Katha before learning it's origins, he finally found his parents. 

&#x200B;

Over the last month, Sebastian worked tirelessly to collect the resources to arm and improve the castle on top of Dutch's head, to give him the edge he'd need to beat Katha. Cannons from an Inquisitor warship. Dwarven ballista. A Ministry cannon that fires a beam of molten gold. A specially built glider to land on Katha's back.  


The plan was simple. Dutch is too small and tame to defeat Katha on his own. And the sages suspect Katha is incapable of truly dying now. Dutch along with the cannons and the help of Sebastian's friends, would need to weaken Katha enough (under 1500 HP) to capture her inside a containment orb. But the orb must be placed on the head by hand. So they are forced to land on Katha's personal forest of dinosaurs which have evolved to defend their master. From there they will have to fight up to the head and contain her once and for all.  


(This was such a fun session even though everyone became very afraid for their character's lives on turn order 8 haha. They have finally weakened her enough and landed on her back. Let's see how they handle the dinosaurs!)"

He conducted his campaign because the only way people would do something about it was if the people themselves conducted the change. But to do that, he would have to disseminate his manifesto in a way that would keep the capitalists from censoring it (because it absolutely would've been censored by the anti-communist establishment).
