Also, no professional dentist will ever judge you for your dental problems. I have seen teeth far worse than yours and I tend to tell me that them coming in for treatment means that they have recognized the problem, which is always the first step toward improvement.

Go see a dentist soon. No one can diagnose you on here with that picture alone. Go get yourself a full dental examination with xrays and things will get in order."
