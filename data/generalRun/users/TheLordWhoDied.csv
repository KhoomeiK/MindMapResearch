AskReddit,fcxh5co,t3_ejdlbw,1578062804.0,"Maybe this doesn't fit here as it isn't about loathing, but it is about going from caring about someone deeply to just feeling like ""ugh. I don't really wanna talk with you anymore"". There's this person who used to be my teacher for 4 years up until 2014. And she became a very important adult to me. And has stayed in my life since then. I felt like she was the only one who understood me. I could tell her anything. And she helped me communicate when I couldn't by myself, she helped me calm down when I was having panic attacks, she helped me every time I moved to a new family. And I wrote to her a lot, about how I was feeling, because she was the only one who really understood and listened.   
But by 2019 we had grown apart a lot, and I didn't really confide in her like I used to anymore. Because I had tried so hard to confide in the people I had around me all the time. But she was still very important to me. But in fall 2019 I wrote to her, about how I was feeling. But this time she was very rude, didn't listen to me at all, and said some things that hurt me. And I understand that she might've had a bad day. But she's never been like that before. And since then she's been stating things that are just not true, saying things about my past/present problems that are really fucking weird. Like she will always have a special place in my heart for the help she gave me when I was younger. But man, wtf happened to you."

Because why should he die, when he has been fighting so hard, when he has a loving family and children to watch grow up, why does it have to be him when I just have sat here for so long wishing nothing but death for me. I truly wish I could just take all the pain away. Not only for him and my best friends family. I would trade places with anyone about to die from sickness. In a heartbeat. Not because I want to die. But because it pains me so much to see all the hurt from everyone who is left. It pains me that someone who wants to live has to die."
