Those who lose the weight are terrified of going back to how they felt, looked and acted before shedding the weighted blob they packed around.

witchcraft,ff8s91h,t3_es17sr,1579694081.0,"At first glance these really seem to be explainable by natural feelings, emotions and coincidences. 

When you are depressed, yeah, you feel heavy and weighted down. Like you’re not yourself. Sometimes getting outside and in a different environment it can elevate your mood...for a while. 

If you have a history of anxiety, that pressure you feel on your chest is super common. I get it. Have for years. I would be slow to accept any unverified causes just due to your roommate...visions of apparitions are dubious at best. 

I am sorry to hear about your friend’s loss. It’s often surprising how situations like this occur. Again, very common and honestly probably coincidence. 

I know, in this sub, this might not be the perspective you wanted but I thought I’d try.

Orisa/Rein: Work corners, focus on taking space from other main tank or establishing sight lines for DPS and supports. 

Winston/Ball: Work high ground angles for initiations on attacking team or try to set up angles for my team to attack from. This can also be distraction play (think Ball slamming and/or killing a support before the “fight”, or touching the objective enough to cause the other team to turn) 

Along with this I try to maintain some form of synergy with my other tank. Whatever it is. Because it’s THEIR job to potentially take advantage of the space I’ve taken or empower ME to hold/claim space.
