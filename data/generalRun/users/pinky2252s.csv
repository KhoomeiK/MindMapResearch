He says ""I dont believe in derogatory words"". This coworker is black. I highly doubt if I called him the ""N"" word he wouldn't have a problem with it.

And yeah he did start yelling, but I guess ignore that part? You dont hear his shaky adrenaline filled voice yelling?"
Roadcam,feoju7r,t1_feohtcx,1579301145.0,Definitely not in most states. Yes a private company that owns the lot can tow a vehicle that violates any rule of the garage. But does that mean its illegal? Not usually.

Downvote all you want, its 100% true. Both can easily get charges for arguing like dumbasses. Might just be a ticket, but OP already said he would get in trouble with his job so he's 100% an idiot."
