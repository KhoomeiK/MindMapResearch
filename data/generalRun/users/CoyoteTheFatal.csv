UnresolvedMysteries,ffi2aqx,t1_ffhhoo0,1579962986.0,"Yup absolutely. I have a very vivid memory of when I was like 15 and I went hunting with my dad on his land, which I’ve been going to since I was 5. I’d been up in a stand and as the sun set, I started heading back to camp. I’d forgotten my light, so I was just following the trail. But the brush had grown up recently and I’d lost the trail (and to be clear, had no way of contacting my dad). So I just kind of stumbled in the general direction I knew I was supposed to go. But it got harder and harder as I couldn’t find the trail and the sun had almost completely set and I started to get really scared I wouldn’t be able to find my way back, and it’s not like I could contact my dad to tell him. I finally found a familiar area and knew my way back from there, but I was terrified for a while. And this was a place I’d been going to for 10 years. It’s easy to get lost in nature."

I got really depressed a few years back, and I started to take a lot of care in how I looked. I bought a nice wardrobe, started trying to look “good” (which similarly was an experience learning how to do that). And I’m not gonna say I’m less depressed when I dress well, but I can say that I know I would feel worse about myself if I was wearing a t-shirt and sweatpants. There’s a lot on adding self-confidence when you feel good about how you look. And it sounds like you’re definitely there! So again, congratulations!"

People in the comments recommended they edit it out, but they just made a joke and completely ignored it. So I doxxed this kid. Obviously knew their name, but found their Facebook, Pinterest, Tumblr, and a couple other social media accounts. Found info like what school they went to, etc. Kid was like in 8th grade by the way. I found some article by their local newspaper about when the kid won class president in like 5th grade. They had no control over the fact that got published. Well I sent all this info to the kid from a new account, saying “look, I don’t know you, I don’t care who you are, I’m not going to do anything with this info, but you put your name out on Reddit, and this is what I was able to find in like half an hour. Heed the warning everyone else mentioned and be more careful with giving your name out online.”  I felt really creepy doing it, but the way I saw it, it’s better me than someone with malicious intentions. It’s a lesson you gotta learn someway. The kid ended up deleting their account. I felt kinda bad about that too. But I still stand by my point"
