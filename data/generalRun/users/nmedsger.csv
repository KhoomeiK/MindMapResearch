So as long as you have them returned to any station within  15 minutes, you’re good.  You can also get up to 4 bikes on one connect card.  

We started riding them to the next closest station, and grabbing beers at the closest bar.  Then, we do it all over again.  We call it the “Bike Lane Bar Crawl”!   It was pretty intimidating to ride a funny bike on downtown streets but, 10/10 will do again."

oddlysatisfying,fdc4fdw,t1_fdc1cv8,1578266906.0,"In 1974 the US government had the back of citizens when it came to misleading packaging and advertising.   They found that bacon packagers had started stacking the bacon in packages to make them appear less fatty, and in return, making the consumer believe that it was better than other choices.  It’s because of this that there are little windows in bacon packages that allow you to see the back side of the bacon. 

Now, our FDA allows companies like Tampico to package their product just like real juice as long as they put “flavored juice drink” somewhere on the product, even though it may contain only 4% of real juice.

The same thing happens with other things like cheese.  For a product to be labeled and sold as “Cheese” it has to be 100% cheese.   Then, there is “pasteurized processed cheese food”, which only has to contain at least 51% cheese.  And finally, there is “pasteurized processed cheese product”, which can contain only 1% cheese, and is mostly an edible plastic, literally.

Big business in the US has bought the government, and has used this to mislead a majority of Americans who are either uneducated in the matter, or literally have no other alternative.   A boring dystopia indeed..."
