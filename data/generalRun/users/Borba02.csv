""The Service Fee on UberPool trips is based on factors such as whether you match with additional passengers and how much time on route is shared between passengers.""

They took 35% from me tonight on a trip where I picked up two groups from the airport. If I would have hit the stop additional trips button after the first request my service fee usually is 10% for a pool ride without additional pax. Would have made $34 from the first person. I ended up making $36 total because they matched me with a second pax and they were able to bump their service fee. Would have gladly traded that $2 extra I got for the additional 15 minutes of driving."

If you're landscaping company but you don't do gas lines and you have to reroute one for a job. You contract that job out. So Uber has to define itself, is it a software platform or a ride hailing company?
All these changes are the signs of death throes and they're going to be temporary because I don't think these changes will satisfy the bill's requirements."

Worst comes to worst as soon as you're uncomfortable you can offer to let them out at the first open and public establishment. If they protest, remind them that they are on camera and if the previous option isn't acceptable then you will be driving to the nearest police station with them on the phone and emergency location sharing on.
Drop off early and call Uber support immediately to be the first one to start the dialog. Offer video evidence and or police report.

So sorry you had to go through this. Even though rides are slow right now. I still refuse to pick up low rated passengers for this reason. Fucked up people are out there so please take the preventive steps to protect yourself. No job is worth your security. You are in charge of how that ride goes.
