BattlefieldV,ffhybdq,t1_ffgpgc3,1579959114.0,"If Dice removed the time constraint, then I would rather the weapons be available as Chapter Rewards than weekly TOW rewards. The grind doesn't bother me as long as I can do it on my time."
BattlefieldV,ffhy13t,t1_ffhtz6k,1579958809.0,"Braddock could've explained his reason for why he believes it's not, but instead he just gave a rather rude response and said there's no point arguing. That makes me believe that Jeff knows he's lost that argument and has nothing substantial to back up his claims. The details coming up that he commented on at the end must not be that good either judging from his response."
BattlefieldV,ffhxclr,t1_ffhrijg,1579958029.0,"I don't like the idea of weapons being under a system where real money is involved unlocking them. I have no problem with people spending extra money on the game they love and support, but I'm more concerned of what Dice will try to sneak behind a paywall in the future. Take for instance there are some Rare cosmetic items being bundled with Epics and are only available for boins. Their reason for that is that those are bonus items for buying the Epic bundle. I hope they don't start hiding primary weapons behind a paywall and calling it a bonus for buying that bundle. I feel like they sneaked in some lower tiered weapons into the Chapter Rewards system so they can say people enjoyed that and now they have an excuse to make weapons available for money. I like the idea of being able to unlock the weapons without time constraints. I don't mind doing the grind when I can do it on my time."

BattlefieldV,ffhccqr,t1_ffgqrhy,1579929711.0,"They need to make money. Since players enjoy getting new guns, I guess Dice figured they would try to cash in on that and make weapons Chapter Rewards. Sure BF4 did it with selling shortcuts, but that doesn't mean they have to do it with BFV. If Dice wants to copy BF4, I would rather them copy how one could customize their weapons, progression, team balance, and other gameplay stuff BF4 did well."

BattlefieldV,ffbqr0u,t1_ffbq3cf,1579778947.0,"They did have a disclaimer at the beginning, but they would never follow through with communicating why something happened.

BattlefieldV,fepldfh,t1_fepdqbo,1579323545.0,"I remember when the roadmap had stuff in it that didn't happen right away or at all and people seemed to be more upset that Dice wouldn't say anything as to what was going on. For instance the 5v5 fiasco. They could've told us they were having problems getting it to work or whatever it was, but instead they chose to ignore everyone. Then there was Al-Soondan being delayed which people didn't seem to be too upset since Dice caught it before it went live, but then they stopped talking about it. I feel like it was not about Dice changing things around, but more so that when they did make a change, they didn't communicate it very well which they don't have to, but when they kept saying how they wanted to communicate more and be more transparent with the community and then a week later they are doing the exact opposite of what they said they were going to do I think that's what upset people the most.

That's when I said that Dice should include a disclaimer and state that these are just ideas that may or may not happen. Well now they are being silent and people are getting upset about that so shouldn't that mean Dice should start communicating more? I'm starting to think  EA doesn't want to release information that may trigger a negative response and cause the stock prices to drop so they tell Dice to make up some excuse as to why they can't say anything."
