>If the claims of attachment theory were true, then Norwegian children would all be delinquents, as 92% of them are raised in a government daycare starting from the age of two, and 70% of them are raised in a daycare from when they're one.

But that's an important difference. Secure child attachment can certainly be developed in two years, and definitely in 2. Twelve weeks, common in the us, is far higher, and significantly raises the probably that kids will bond to their peers, rather than an adult figure. (Recommend ""Hold on to your kids"" by the two authors I referenced earlier. 

My contention is not that daycare breaks attachment - [studies show it doesn't](https://www.nytimes.com/1996/04/21/us/study-says-babies-in-child-care-keep-secure-bonds-to-mothers.html). But rather that we need parents to take the primary role in care to develop secure attachment, rather than leave kids in daycare without the right support structure."

>Like it happened countless times throughout history?

I imagine you understand that it is governments that have been trampling on individual sovereignty for millennia.

I have massive problems with both. I dislike compulsory European models because I don't think it's moral to force any person to participate in and pay for any program they disagree with.
