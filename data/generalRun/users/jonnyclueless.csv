HAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!!!!!!!"
politics,ffjsqm7,t3_etxb0f,1580005931.0,I think so many people are missing a bigger issue here. Trump went on live TV insisting he did not know Parnas. Here is a recording of them talking business together over dinner. More lying and obstruction.
videos,ffjkqio,t1_ffjjjxf,1580000462.0,"Yes he did make the claim. And it's obvious to everyone why he didn't write any citation for anything. The video makes that crystal clear. 

Again, using your logic, there is no such thing as an enforceable traffic violation. But we can test this very easily. All you need to do is tailgate a police officer and in court claim you did no such thing. Using your logic there would be no evidence since you believe the officer's testimony in traffic violations is not admissible and that the entire legal system has been illegally fining drivers for many decades now. Just tell the judge what you are saying here and see how well that goes. 

Many police do not have cameras. And of course your logic also means that police could not issue traffic citations prior to having cameras. Radar guns also do not have anything to tie a specific car to a citation. They give a reading that the officer records. We take the officers word on that reading. Which according to you is not admissible. And we haven't even gotten into any of the infractions that don't involve speeding, such as tailgating. 

I would pay anything to watch you try to make this argument in court. 

Anyways, good luck. I got a real good laugh out of this. And I chuckle at the thought of you trying to argue this in court. Kind of a Sovereign Citizen light."
videos,ffjhp9k,t1_ffjacjp,1579998461.0,"Yes there is evidence of the officers claim. The officers account. Using your logic, nothing an officer charges someone with is enforceable and is by default a lie. Imagine trying to use your tactic in a court of law. ""Your honor, there is no evidence I did what the officer said, therefore the officer is lying.""

Sorry, but it doesn't work that way. The infraction is not determined by what the defendant says, it's by the officer who is trained and sworn to determine. If you have proof the officer is lying, then you will need to present that. Otherwise their testimony is valid and without which there would be no ability for police to ever uphold any traffic violations ever."
