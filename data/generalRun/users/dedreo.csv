My dad passed, I spent 5/6 of my life living near him, sometimes living with him, and he had a daughter from his earlier life on the west coast (she met on summers during her teens, then maybe a dozen more visits later in life). He also had a live-in girlfriend of 7 years. 3 months before he died he completely changed the will to where I got nothing but 1k. That was bullshit. Had to fight it, now I just no longer have a half-sister in my mind, but her whole family (which is not there fault), and some old lady now living on the last bits of the family farm that was in my family for 150+ years, because she literally withheld many truths during deliberations because I was asked only very specific questions by the lawyers.  
My dad, and his parents, would've only wanted fairness. That is not what happened. I got a chunk, but nowhere near fair, and I will literally threaten them to get off my doorstep for trespassing (and give them time to leave) if I ever open the door to them again.  
Similar thing happened to my mom when her dad died. Suddenly the step-mother changed her will, all her blood heirs get everything (including some land oil rights, and time settlements for asbestos). Took a legal fight at it, until finally realized it wasn't worth it, that is not family.  
If your siblings are cool, definitely look into gifting them afterwards, especially if they are cool with things as is."

The post about Grazul...maybe. I don't have Grazul, but the abilities (other than shutting off status) seems...kinda lacking, even though it's fast, I haven't blinked twice at facing a party with one, unless they have a next character that I know will build off of the ability."

Nowadays, I've revisited Star Wars: Dark Forces, Deus Ex, Hexen, Abe's Odyssey, and others; and since I have no original nostalgia, I'm half afraid I'll just look back and think ""wow...this was it?"" like I did with the prior titles that I did used to play (and somehow lost the magic that was present the first time around), and now think when I try to play again."

I really loved the 'idea' of Margaret, even though she hasn't aged as well as many HoTM I've seen; maybe I was still kinda new. Yea actually double-pulled Seshat (heard about it, first and only time it's happened to me), still have one at 1-1, but hope to change that....well, one day, lol."

But literally, by definition you can't know they are bots unless you doxx them, which is asking to increase the potential for a situation to escalate.  So yea dehumanize them, even when they respond; historically that works out in the long run, because after a while you don't have to even think there's anyone that thinks that, or if they do, they don't deserve an actual thought to their opinion because they aren't human beings anymore."
