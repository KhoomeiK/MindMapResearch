singularity,ff7b5y1,t3_es1x66,1579645246.0,"The singularity is actually the third technological singularity humanity has undergone. 

The first was the neolithic revolution 10,000 years ago (agriculture, animal husbandry, writing, etc). 

Second was the industrial revolution that started about 250 years ago. 

Third is the machine intelligence revolution we are in the early phases of now. 

Each one saw rates of social progress, economic progress, scientific progress, etc occur many many times faster than in the previous age. Also population exploded with each revolution, growing by a factor of 10+ or more times. 

So what will happen in a post singularity world? Who knows. In a way thats like a tribe in Iraq 20,000 years ago wondering what the world post agriculture will be like, or someone in Europe in the 14th century wondering what life after the industrial revolution would be like. For the latter, I'm certain they'd never expect China to be a global superpower. 

Automation will be hard transition IMO, but the end result will be a post scarcity society. However there will be a multi decade transition period of high unemployment and radical politics (communism on one side, fascism on the other) to deal with the unemployment. 

I think 'democracy' run by AI is the next form of government. AI that is programmed to place human well being first will be placed in charge, and it will use trillions of sensors and endless data points to determine what the best next move is. Humans will have the ability to overrule it, but eventually that probably won't be necessary as it will ideally be in line with what people want. 

Not sure about one world government. I doubt it, because there are massive cultural differences and people don't like each other that much. A more likely trend is libertarianism combined with a huge social safety net. 

The biggest beneficiary of the coming age will be China, in part because China takes it seriously. Also China needs it most due to their aging population and the one child policy creating incentives for automation. Also China is a nation that is more open to bioengineering which will also give some advantages."
