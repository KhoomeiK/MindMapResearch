I can't remember if aluminium was an element that could bond to itself or not.

But what I learned is that there's three major parts of being disabled that affect your quality of life, and, in increasing order of how miserable they can make you, they are:

1. The actual fucking disability

2. The mental bullshit it brings with it when your life changes (which may or may not be there to stay, depending on whether it's degenerative or not)

3. Other people.

No matter how bad your disability is, once you accept it, you're mostly fine. People think that disability is worse than death but human beings can adapt to *anything*. I've been in agony, puking my guts up and too tired to roll over in bed while busting for the loo badly enough to seriously consider pissing the bed because I was *that fucking tired*, and all I could feel was ""yup, it's Tuesday."" No big deal. That kind of stuff, if you throw an able-bodied person into it in the deep end, would fucking break them, but once you're used to it you don't give a fuck.

Other people, though? Will make your life a fucking *nightmare*. It's not the normal human things that make life a nightmare, though -- it's the way they interact with your disability and, therefore, with you. 

Being a paraplegic is no big deal. Yeah, you'll have your crisis about how much your life has changed and it might take months or years, but eventually you'll get over it, grab a wheelchair and zoom off.

Other people, though? They'll fuck you six ways from Sundays -- they'll put up stairs with no ramps, they'll make elevators out of order so you have to wheel another kilometre up a busy road to cross it, they'll cut your benefits so you can't afford your accessibility tools, they'll fuck with food labels and braille and captions and anything they can think of. (They probably made your wheelchair cost several grand, too, so ""grabbing"" one is a lot harder than I make it sound.) And the entire time they will pester you with questions while also subtly needling for you to prove things to them. It is so fucking exhausting.

Able bodied people think the worst part about being disabled is the disability. No fucking way. The worst part is *them*. And it's exactly because of that lack of empathy you mention."

AskReddit,feqgggx,t1_feq3t24,1579341580.0,"Ironically, I stopped being miserable when I got too sick to worry any more about it. I knew that if I accepted my illness, I would be happier, but I couldn't do it. It took my illness beating me into submission and forcing me to let everything go before I could.

AskReddit,feqg92l,t1_feq6m0h,1579341490.0,"Being sick made me a more honest person. I used to be really paranoid about what my parents thought of me, for example, so I always carefully cultivated my opinions and every word I said around them.

When I was at my worst, I was so sick that even worrying about what they thought took too much energy. I just started saying what I thought. Instead of feeling responsible for their responses, I was too tired to give a shit so I just let them deal with it themselves. They're freaking out because I disagree with them about Brexit? Whatever.

It's a double edged sword, because my illness made me *extremely* cranky and I became very bitter and could be very, very nasty, especially online. It literally took me years to undo *that* habit, but I'm a lot better about walking the line between being honest and being an asshole now. I'm not always tactful, but I remember to make the effort to be so more now, and I'm continuing to improve there.

AskReddit,feqf3qo,t1_feqb8yx,1579341159.0,"Slowly. **Very** slowly. It took about two and a half years to get from my worst to where I am now. 

Went from being bedridden to not needing to lie down during the day in about 4 months, but it was much longer before I was ""normal."" I was still very, very fragile and the slightest bit of pushing would send me spiralling for a few days or weeks. I had no resilience at all, it was like I was made of glass. 

That was in 2017 -- beginning of it I was sick as a dog, towards the end I was normal... as long as I acted normal. If I did anything out of the ordinary it was like being hit by a truck. I could go all day acting like a normal person, but if I did something as simple as running to catch the bus, or cleaning my room, bam, I was back in bed again. I felt like an old lady. A paper doll that could stay upright as long as you don't fucking touch it.

In 2018 I finally began to build some resilience. I could push myself a little and I was able to take it instead of breaking, and I had developed some damn good instincts to tell where that line was. It wasn't until I felt my resilience start to grow that I realised I was actually getting better, and I let myself hope that one day I'd be normal again.

Today, I'm 99.99% normal.

Every now and then I do something I haven't done since before I got sick, and my body will *freak the fuck out*. I rode a bike, gently, for 10 minutes last April and almost passed out. But when things like that happen my body quickly realises nothing is wrong and it'll stop happening in a matter of days. Within a week I was gliding around on that bike like I was flying.

I think it's like turning on a rusty tap. At first all this shit comes flushing out. Every now and then I'll turn on a tap that I haven't since before I got sick, and the shit needs to be flushed out before the water runs clear. I've turned on every tap I can think of so it's very rare that something knocks me on my arse now, and even if something does I know I'll be fine by the next day. I exercise, so my body's used to physical stress enough I don't think anything will surprise me any more.

The last tap, and final test, will be full time work, once I've got my degree. Will my body be able to handle weeks on end of full time work? 

We will see.

I have a few things left over from it, though. I cannot tolerate caffeine any more -- everything stiffens up, I feel really sick and exhausted. I still wake up constantly during the night, I think I've only slept through it once in the last four years. I get shoulder pain when I'm hungry. I have a crick in my neck. I cannot touch or massage my neck (the muscles of which are extremely tight and tetchy) or I will get blinding headaches and stiffness in my wrists.

But those things are very, very small prices to pay. And they remind me to take it easy, and never put my body under so much strain it falls apart like it did a few years ago. 

They remind me it can come back whenever it wants.

Not blind, but when I was 23 I got very, very ill with a neurological condition that was never diagnosed. From the prognosis of disorders that are very similar, I truly believed I'd have it for life.

I was extremely lucky and privileged that it was temporary. It lasted years, but it was temporary.

But the worst part was being in the middle and *not knowing that*. It was thinking things couldn't get any worse, then having them get worse, and having that process repeat often enough that I dreaded the next symptom appearing. I knew it was going to happen, I just didn't know what it was, or when it would come, or how badly it would fuck up my life, just that it **would** happen. And it always did.

Most places close at 5PM, those that don't don't go for much later, so nipping to the shop after dark in summer is pretty much impossible short of heading to a servo. 24 hour places are very rare. Lockout laws means nightclubs are dying so feeding is harder than before. On the bright side, if you're friendly enough to have a haven in Nosferatu territory, you can just nip out into the underground shopping centre during the day and nom on a worker in one of the maintenance corridors without seeing a glimpse of sun. Nossies are really the only Camarilla clan that can cope with summer, due to already being used to being cooped up all the time. Few homeless compared to American cities, but numbers have been increasing over the last decade.

On the bright side, we have a population of:

**Nosferatu** -- Near the underground shopping complexes and tunnels, also found near train stations. They're used to not being able to go to any of the 24/7 stores so Sydney doesn't bother them as much as it does the rest, so you'll find more Nossies than other clans.

**Kuei-Jin** -- Considerable chunk of them, causing tensions with the local Camarilla. They're often messing with the local Chinese Kine, of which there's a significant population.

Those are the two main groups. The Camarilla are present, of course, and mostly favoured than the Anarchs due to Australian penchants for rules, but foreign Camarilla better not make the mistake of thinking that means they can flaunt their rank -- tall poppy syndrome isn't just an Australian Kine thing. Any Camarilla that doesn't pretend to be ""one of the guys"" will quickly get smacked down.

**Armidale, Australia** -- 1/10. No Nosferatu. A small pocket of Kuei-Jin. Easy enough to get a feed on Friday and Saturday nights, but the rest of the week is -- well -- dead, and there's no underground shopping centres or anything that's open at a decent hour."

But the difference between the mother in this story and the woman that the OP of this particular thread is that the mother came, ultimately, from a place of love for her trans child -- she just expressed it with anger, fear and distrust. She wanted what was best for her child, and that compassion allowed her to find a *better way* to achieve that goal through love and support instead of that anger and fear. It was win/win, for both the mother and her child. The shop owner was compassionate so that the child could have a better home life, and it worked.

That woman OP was talking about, though? Not the case. Smack that shit down. It was completely fucking unnecessary, there was no win/win scenario. It didn't come from misguided love, it didn't come from wanting what was best for anyone.

The high road is for building connections and helping people find a better way. It's not an excuse to be a doormat."

Why the hell would an employer pay a disabled employee to work from home when they could get a smarter, more efficient employee? Nausea and migraines are relatively easy to deal with when it comes to disabilities affecting your work, you just ignore the pain and keep going. What do you do when the inflammation is so bad it essentially turns you into Dory? You try to work, to compensate, but you piss off your boss so much from your pain-inflicted dumbassery and get fired, like I did. You really think employers are going to let someone work if that person affects their bottom line? 

Just because your buddies can do it doesn't mean LAOP's wife can. Disabilities are not one size fit all. Every single person's abilities and symptoms are different even across the same disorder.

You've obviously never personally dealt with this, and *it shows*. Like holy shit, your comment *reeks* of privilege and ""my best friend is black so I'm not racist."""
Supplements,fel15ff,t3_epm4pl,1579211819.0,"When I was on dexamphetamines and later vyvanse, I had this problem really badly to the point I developed a neurological disorder and eventually had to go off them entirely because I was in so much pain. 

My advice:

* Increase your magnesium. It gets pissed out, so the worst you have to worry about is heart palpitations if your electrolyte balance is off, and nausea if you take too much at once, or the runs. Basically, take 400mg every time you have a meal. If you get heart palpatations, make sure you're having other electrolytes too. Topical magnesium is also good - it'll be really itchy at first but your body will get used to it. IF YOU HAVE HEART CONDITIONS OR LOW BLOOD PRESSURE, TALK TO YOUR DOC FIRST. 

* Something to experiment with is high dose B1 - you have to work up to it, but fibro patients sometimes take 2g a day. If you're developing what I did, it might help cut it off at the pass. Just be aware it'll fuck with your folic acid levels, so pick up folic acid too and if your legs are crazy at night take some of that.

* Get iron levels checked. Low iron makes ADHD worse, and if you're taking high dose magnesium it can conpete with iron for absorption anyway. If your iron levels are low, increasing them might mean you can cut back on your meds when your iron levels go up.

* If you have anxiety issues, get that treated ASAP or this could get worse. Take breaks from the meds if you can. 

* Eat. Eat, eat, eat. Your appetite is lower than usual, yes? That can give you nutritional deficiencies which will make this worse. Food is fuel. Lots of leafy greens and anti inflammatory foods.

Supplements,fekz8ef,t1_feiip1g,1579210679.0,"I've tried GABA for other reasons a few years back, but it didn't work for me at the time. But this is a different issue, one I didn't have back then.

So I dug up my old GABA supplements and, after checking the expiry, tried it out before bed last night.

I dreamed all night. I remember waking up after a couple of hours of dreaming like I usually do towards the end of my sleep. Most of the night I had a dream that I was in a line to take the bus, but the line never ended, although it was constantly moving, and it twisted for miles and miles underground. Or I was trying to type something in to google and either always typed it wrong or Google gave me an answer I knew was wrong. 

I also woke up constantly, but I do that anyway. But when I did I'd wake up wide awake, but conk out seconds later, which is new - even before the iron supplements I'd either wake up half asleep and go back to sleep, or I'd wake up wide awake and not go back to sleep for hours, even if I popped another melatonin. Weirdly, every time I went back to sleep, the bus dream continued - usually I don't pick up dreams where they left off, and when I do it's usually in the morning when I'm sleeping in. 

I'm awake earlier than usual this morning. I am sleepy, but I don't feel *exhausted*, and that's all I wanted.

So thanks so much for this. :) I'm going to keep doing this and see where it leads."
