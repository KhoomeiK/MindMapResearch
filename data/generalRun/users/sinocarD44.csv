I had a zit the size of a half dollar on my butt once. Apparently that follicle got infected or something. The only reason I noticed it was I went to scratch my butt and it bled a little. Later that night, I had wife examine it. She was quite excited to pop it. Me too to be honest. 

Well, she gets to work and the first pop not only blasts onto her face and in her hair, it unleashes a smell that I catch a whiff of 3 feet away. She says ""Now I know why your ass has smelled funny lately."" I'm thinking to myself ""Thanks for telling me I smell funky!"" However, the relief quickly wiped away that thought. The zit itself was this gray-black abomination that I couldn't help but examine like the lost text of an ancient civilization.

She proceeds to work on my posterior for a good 45 minutes. Boy oh boy, let me tell that was a good time for me. I even got a snack and a mirror to watch her work. She kinda didn't appreciate me not sharing but she didn't wash her hands. My tail or not, got to wash them hands.

Unfortunately for her she got tired before it all came out. So I shower and feel my heiny. Unfortunately for me the zit zone had shrunk to about the size of a dime. Unfortunately for her, what was left in there was a mini brick of a zit. Getting that sucker out the next night took three hand, some tweezers, and a couple beers. But it certainly felt good when it was done.

So yea, the pressure relief is an awesome feeling. So much so, that to this day I wish I could recreate the Butt Zit of 2013."
