People claim they don't get their stuff, say its broken, don't read the description,  etc. Almost every transaction has issues. Latest guy yelled at me because I can't control when USPS updates their shipping status"

JoeRogan,ffiyjx5,t1_ffiq3jr,1579985883.0,It's better to think about it and make an informed decision. I'm quite cynical myself but I've come to a conclusion who who I'll support
JoeRogan,ffifei1,t1_ffi091x,1579972563.0,I appreciate your response. You seem rational and level headed. May I ask who interests you this election cycle?
JoeRogan,ffhgg3e,t1_ffg894g,1579934171.0,"I see what you're saying about the economy but one can very easily debate that it is not doing well. Stagnant wages, people work more for less, increasing costs that dont keep up with wages, wealth gap continues to grow, most barely have any money in savings, tax cuts don't cover the increase in services as public services are cut , etc.  Stock market gains mean nothing to your average American. Job growth is nice but can also be picked apart to see that many people are having to work multiple jobs. Tariffs are being paid for by American consumers. Our infrastructure is falling apart. We continue to throw money at failing industries"
UpliftingNews,ffhg7xx,t1_ffhd109,1579933903.0,I'd disagree. People work more than ever before for far less. Throw in food deserts in impoverished areas and the need for fast dining options in stressful lives and we have a recipe for poor health. Most people barely have time to themselves and definitely not to exercise or be health conscious

trashy,ffg5g5b,t1_ffg0xyf,1579898856.0,Text book pricing is the real fraud. Hundreds of dollars for a book you have to use all of twice. And when it is barely used and in perfect condition you get pennies on the dollar back.
