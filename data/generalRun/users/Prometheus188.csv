Montreal is to the Liberals, what Alberta is to the conservatives. It’s a liberal stronghold. Hell, even Quebec as a province is usually a Liberal stronghold to varying degrees. The NDP just borrowed Quebec for 1 election. The support was always temporary (albeit in hindsight). 



2011 was a perfect storm. The Bloc was deeply unpopular, as was separatism, so for the first time in a long time, Quebec overwhelmingly wanted a Federalist Party.
