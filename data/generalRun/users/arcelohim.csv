Mulan. A remake of a former Disney movie based on Asian myth. There was a comedic relief dragon dragon. This beloved character does not make a return in the live action remake.

I wouldn't complain as much if Disney had a slavic princess to give some more diversification. Instead Slavic roles are still relegated to bad-guys and the hired help in media. The best thing Disney has in terms of representation of Slavic culture is The Night on Bald Mountian. Would be cool if they made a movie with a theme park ride tie in."
