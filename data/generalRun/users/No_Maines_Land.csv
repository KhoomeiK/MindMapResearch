You've listed a while bunch of reasons why the USA would be in favour of mostly status-quo and stable governance in Canada. Would they not act on that vested interest? I've never claimed that act maliciously or against our interests, only self-servingly.

Since American motives and objectives mostly align with ours for now, influence would be pushing for stability. For example:

The US has an interest in Canada keeping it's Navy and airforce small to push their claim of an international NWP.

The US has an interest in keeping cheap crude flowing to them, and should pressure against westward pipelines.

I don't like the term ""pro-freedom"" personally, as I find it is a poor summary and having too many meanings.

Are you for maximizing individual freedom for those who can garner it, or maximizing the freedoms of all Canadians? We have a cheater of rights and freedoms as we recognize freedom isn't singular. An increase to one freedom can reduce another freedom.

For example, increased taxes obviously reduces personal economic freedom. If those taxes go into say, para-transit, then they can increase freedom of mobility for those with the least.

Another example, since it's fresh in my mind, is carry firearms without purpose. On the one hand, allowing open or concealed carry obviously increases personal freedom for anyone who ones a firearm; since they don't need a reason to carry it. It may also increase freedom of personal security for some people. Conversely, people carrying guns everywhere reduces freedom of personal security for those without a firearm.

In conclusion, I'm sure you do have a strong sense of political purpose, but I do not think ""pro-freedom"" is a good way to express it. Also, the yanks have gone and charged the term freedom with a specific brand of nationalism."
