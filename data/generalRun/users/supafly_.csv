worldnews,fcz1mup,t1_fcyzuqp,1578091850.0,"A fair point.  I never brought up the Paris agreement because I knew that was never ratified.  I kinda figured something as important as an agreement that meant terrorists weren't developing nuclear weapons would have been a slam dunk, but there I go assuming again.

I think my broad point stands about US foreign policy though.  It's pretty unprecedented for a President to grab office and immediately start pissing over the previous admin's policy, especially when dealing with agreements signed by other nations.

We should have stuck by the deal if for no other reason than we managed to get Iran to the table and sign something.  Maybe it wasn't the be all end all, but it was a step in the right direction.  Now there is little chance to bring them back short of overthrowing their government.

It just pisses me off to no end that this chucklefuck in office is trying his damnedest to start WW3 and is too stupid to realize it."
worldnews,fcz109y,t1_fcyyd7z,1578091507.0,"I'm sorry, you're right.  I just can't in any way justify in my mind that Trump losing face doesn't equate to the US losing face.  He's the President and in the eyes of the world he speaks for us.  It's pretty obvious when interacting with people from other countries that they don't divide us by R's and D's (nor would I expect them to follow US politics that closely) and take what he says as what ""we"" say.  

But again, you're right, I made it personal and I generally go to great lengths not to.  I apologize."
worldnews,fcyxrol,t1_fcywq8s,1578089418.0,"> You shouldn't blindly support a one-sided treaty because the previous administration put it into place. 

No, you should support it because it's part of US foreign policy and if you want to change the agreement there should be negotiations, not one side unilatterly declaring it a ""bad deal"" with NO other detail and tweeting(!!!!) that we're not abiding by it.

> But I disagree with your perspective on Trump rapidly eroding that clout. He sure has pissed away his own credibility. But regardless of that, America itself has become stronger in a number of important ways, mainly economically and militarily. 

I don't even know how to respond to this other than telling you you're delusional.  To me it's pretty obvious that our allies are rapidly losing respect for us.   Trump got literally laughed at multiple times by NATO leaders.  Once openly while he was giving a speech.  This did not happen to us before Trump."
worldnews,fcyvqs5,t1_fcyumor,1578088131.0,"It worked pretty well to keep them from building nukes... well, until the aforementioned pissing anyway.

So is that US foreign policy now?  Only negotiate treaties to be effective until the next general election because the next guy might not like the guy that came before him?

You don't just get to ignore treaties because you made them with bad people.  We made treaties with the Axis powers after WWII.  Would you break all of them because Stalin was on the other side of the table?  Your argument is beyond asinine.  If you can't talk with an enemy in good faith, you WILL lose all international credibility.  Credibility that the US has gained in the wake of WWII and that we've slowly been pissing away since the cold war and rapidly pissing away since Trump."
