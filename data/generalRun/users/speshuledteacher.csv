sleep,fgikni1,t3_eyn528,1580824398.0,"Please make sure you have a working carbon monoxide detector, people die every winter from CO poisoninG because appliances that use gas, including heaters, stoves, etc are not burning the fuel completely.  Dizziness, especially that lasts for hours, sounds like a symptom of carbon monoxide poisoning more than sleeping too hot.  Being too hot tends to wake me up early, not late.  Fatigue is another symptom of CO poisoning.
  
Once you are SURE that you are not slowly poisoning yourself, if it were me I’d invest in more blankets and keep the window cracked.  You could even use something to fill/cover half the crack if it is still letting too much cold air in."

education,fghsb3e,t3_eyklr3,1580792439.0,"Many schools prefer in school suspension since out of School suspension usually does more harm than good.  It doesn’t teach kids to act right, or teach them anything really, and in many cases absentee parents don’t supervise kids anyway so it ends up being a vacation.
  
  For truancy some schools may resort to this, but often they go another route.  I have chronically truant students.  At first parents are asked to come in and meet with admin and sign an attendance contract.  If attendance improves significantly, awesome!  Nothing else happens.  We even send awards home for kids improving attendance.  If they don’t, it can be escalated.  Eventually truancy can be referred all the way to the district attorney in some cases.  I don’t know what happens when it reaches that point, but it can’t be good.  
  
In some areas it can also be referred to CPS as educational neglect.  If you have a concern that family are not getting kids to school please reach out to CPS, you can do so anonymously.  Missing out on education sets kids up for lifelong hardship.
  
Schools care about attendance because a large amount of funding is based on it.  We have to pay for the supplies, instructors, etc whether a kid is there or not.  It can be hard to predict truancy and budget for it so excessive truancy can cost schools money they don’t have."

HealthAnxiety,fg8a1e0,t3_exa8xe,1580613570.0,"Stroke home diagnosis is so simple it has an acronym-FAST.  You are not having a stroke, but everyone should know this acronym, it’s simple and can save a life.
  

F-face.  Smile, does only half your face show it in the mirror?  Is half your face saggy and non responsive when you try to make facial expressions?  That’s what happens with a stroke.  
  

A - arms.  Raise both your hands up above your head, reach.  Is one arm not able to reach all the way up and looks different than the other arm?  Like more than barely?  That’s a stroke symptom.
  
  
S-speech.  Is your speech slurred?  
  
T -time.  If the other three registered positive for a stroke get to a hospital immediately.  A stroke caught during the first hour is highly treatable and often results in little to no lasting damage.  
 
  
You are not having a stroke.  Blood vessel in your eye may be from screen time, I get em when I play on my phone and computer too long.  They don’t go away for a while, and I have some I’ve had over a month because, again, too much screen time.  Those are all anxiety symptoms."

I’d find weird disjointed rhyming word lists on her desk after every day, meanwhile she spent the rest of the day setting off kids, taking no initiative, and not following basic directions.  She’d prompt kids to raise their hand and then continue even after I had selected another kid so the kid she was prompting had no reason to raise their hand anymore.  And Santa, for some reason every list had Santa.

Joint, point, fade, blade, grade.  Head, red, said.  Santa.  Plot, bot, go, show.  Birthday.
  
WTH, every day I found these lists and wondered what exactly she thought her job was."
Teachers,ffe1iwt,t1_ffdz3lz,1579834279.0,"I was horrible to my mom.  Not regular teenage horrible.  Truly despicable, hateful, lying, sneaking around, trying-like-hell-to-ruin-my-life horrible.  No matter what, I knew my mom loved me, and that I could always come home.  Now my mom is my best friend.  Love your boy, keep teaching him right from wrong even if you don’t think he’s learning it, and hold out hope.  It took a long time, but I don’t think I would have turned it around without my mom’s love and knowing I could always come home."
Teachers,ffdyd4a,t1_ffdxvv2,1579831991.0,"I was an asshole.  Smart, lazy, smart-ass that thought I could do whatever I wanted and knew better than everyone else.  I had a decent home life and no excuse, just my own issues.  I’m not an asshole anymore (at least I don’t think I am.). I’m polite, kind, try to see the good in everyone, and work hard.  Still have all kinds of issues, but now they only effect me and not those around me for the most part.  
  
Point is, don’t write off those kids who are just assholes.  I know it can be hard, but some of them will grow up to be assholes, and some of them won’t."

You could also pair a specific touch and sign combo to a treat to begin a training session and a hand sign to the end so that he knows to pay attention to you and the treats will keep flowing until he is signaled otherwise.   
  
Hand signals are great for all dogs, regardless of hearing."

Your speech pathologist can use the PECs software to make pages with pictures the kid likes like peppa pig, cars, etc.  have them print 2 of each set, 4 pictures to 9 per page is a good place to start.  Cut out one set, laminate both and add Velcro.  You can now start teaching matching same with something the kid likes to do."

specialed,ff1l2zd,t3_er43ug,1579480919.0,"You could do a few things with the French to make the professor happy.  I agree it is in no way useful to incorporate French into your lessons beyond teaching them to say hello, but here’s a few things you can do which shouldn’t confuse them too much.

Incorporate a greeting in French to circle time or calendar.  You say it, students say it back.  You might also see if there is a short hello song in French (bonus if you can find it in French and English) for circle time.
  
You could also do a word of the week or word of the day in French (I recommend doing the same word in English and giving credit for both.  Keeps the prof happy and could teach some new, useful English vocabulary or encourage polite language like please and thank you). Sudents get praise, token reinforcement if they use that, or something special like you saying “wonderful” in French in an over exaggerated voice if they use it during the day.  
  
Finally, you could label cabinets or areas around the room in both English and French."
Dogtraining,feia9fy,t1_fei942j,1579133798.0,"Ok thanks.  He does enjoy the dog park when other dogs aren’t in his space, and his warning growls do seem to work so I’ll drop the correction and stick with the praise.  I can add treats on walks, and at the dog park too if there’s only a few other dogs so I can make sure other owners don’t mind me treating their dogs too (he’s ok with getting treats along with other dogs, no growling or guarding with that). I don’t want to stop All together since he really enjoys it, I’ll just be more selective and only go at off-peak times when there aren’t many dogs."
Dogtraining,fei8tjh,t1_fei7p3s,1579132847.0,"The growling is a lot less frequent and often doesn’t happen at all if I have the ball.  If there’s no ball involved he is fearful and tries to get away on and off leash.  He doesn’t guard the ball unless he gets to it when I throw it at the same time as another dog, and even then the other dog can get the ball and he’ll give up.  If he sees another dog is going to beat him to the ball he gives up and doesn’t even try and starts looking for a new ball or runs back to me."

Community college was cheap, had to do a few remedial math classes to get caught up.  if you get good grades transferring isn’t hard.  Ended up getting my BA and then a teaching credential.  If you want it and work for it, it’s definitely not too late to turn things around without too much added work, and totally worth it."
copic,fdw35he,t1_fdw0r83,1578754592.0,"Not exactly.  I would test this out before doing it on a piece you care about.  The purple you create will not be the same as if you had mixed the red and blue, it may have more of a muddy or grey appearance.  Also, you won’t be blending purple.  It may look purple on the paper, but the red remains dry so you are only really blending the blue with the new color."
copic,fdtym4h,t1_fdtugnz,1578724394.0,Layering is great for creating shadows and depth and can be done on dry ink.  Generally if you want a gentle blend between two colors where one fades into the next seamlessly is when you want wet on wet.
specialed,fdt3p61,t3_en17hf,1578711510.0,"I wish it was that easy for some of my kids.  It’s not right for many, obviously, but I have to fight tooth and nail to transition kids out of my class and into gen ed with a 1:1.  In the younger grades it can be appropriate for some kids even if they don’t get the academics at all, just for the peer modeling, social skills, and self esteem.   I’ve had kids who will make the same or greater academic gains in gen ed even if they are far behind, and then they don’t pick up biting, crawling under the table, and all kinds of maladaptive behaviors.
  
And for some kids, of course, it is the worst possible thing you can do to them and their peers."

addiction,fddq6jj,t3_ekr9i2,1578321013.0,"Alan Carr’s book “easy way to stop smoking” has helped a lot of people.  Nicotine is hard to kick.  
  
Ecigs are easier to temper than traditional smokes, set a schedule for every drop in level, and use an alarm on your phone for when to vape so you don’t just end up vaping more to compensate for less nicotine.  Once you hit zero hang out there for a Few weeks, that way when you do quit you are just quitting a habit, not an addiction, it will be easier.  
  
Talk to the people at your local vape shop.  Not sure about juul, but in general if vaping is hurting your throat you are doing something wrong (power level/heating element mismatch, dirty coils etc)"
