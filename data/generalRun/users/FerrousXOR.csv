gaming,fgjqc8l,t3_eyrbms,1580849310.0,"This isn't really a call for help. But like... Sometimes when nostalgia helps I tend you just cry. I remember coming home when I was in middle school from the last day of school before my summer started and I had just borrowed a copy of FF7 that friends had finished. I let them borrow Small Soldiers(Irrelevant but worthy of praise.) I remember how it took me the better part of a whole fucking week to get out of Midgar. I clicked and read everything and honestly replayed certain saves before OMFG AWESOME... Like I loved the XIII follow up or with all the small crappy cg cutscenes and flashbacks. I literally spent hours going back on saves so that I can get schooled in the mythos that is FF7. 

When FF8 came out you best believe I did that even MORE!!!! There was a fucking card game, weapon building, magic gathering, magic boosting, gf pairing for each champion to best suit their needs to help you in the end. So much shit to do

I can tell you that the gaming spirt and story telling of yore via gaming has died out a bit but it's alive in well in indie games and people trying to build their gaming universes. 

With all that said... I won't be able to buy this game since I can't afford it nor will I have a console for it. I have a pc and it'll be a bittersweet when I finally get to play the port from it.

I wish those wanting the true experience to really invest a school summer vacations worth of time playing the older games. There is no rush to play through ART. Square made and has continued to make extraordinary universes. Ones where we needed JEEVES to help us with and find others to break down the stories

Death by W-Summon+Quadra Magic+Your Favorite Summon so you can watch that sweet cut scene 8 fucking times. For me is B-Zero!!!"

Also i just realized something... I don't ever remember being told I had to get the newest book. I was like dumb and never asked. fuck. I was part of the problem. WTF HAS CHANGED IN THE LAST PRINT TO THE NEW PRINT THAT I NEED TO FUCKING KNOW THAT WILL MAKE MY LEARNING EXPERIENCE BETTER?

Shit give me money. PM me for my resume lol legit doing my own thing now because it seems everyone here wants Sonos to do something about it but in the end they are just a sociopathic corporation interested only in profits"

I hope someone here wants to join me on this endeavor"
sonos,ff9qvv1,t1_ff9oqj5,1579719033.0,"So then why would anyone anyone buy a bundled system for individual speakers? At that point you can just buy a small receiver to hook up to the speaker of your liking that will have and or outperform the capabilities of the SONO's system all while giving you the choice to use the SPEAKER you want. Only difference will be that hey it ain't gonna look like a sono but then idgf in my opinion. I rather just have small receivers that connect any speaker that I prefer the one center system via wifi/bt/younameit but get the same capabilities without ever having to worry about losing my speaker too. 

Answer to this shitstorm is two parts:

1.) Modular addon that gives speaker of choice the capabilities an enclosed sono system gives

2.) Start a kickstarter? Ain't no reason someone else cant create it and facefuck the rest of the competition that has these slimy practices.

Fuck it! lol Guess imma put my degree to work aside from teaching peeps how to STEM

Keep can eye out for FYPOT - Fuck Your Planned Obsolescence Technologies (TM/Patent pending since I just made this up but will be going through with it. 2020 is gonna be my big fuck you to this slimy practice)"
sonos,ff9nhky,t1_ff9kkoe,1579716688.0,"Then what is it that needs to be updated and or is making the devices not work exactly? Like obviously you have a receiver then the speakers. I don’t know about Sonos and I will look into them when I get home from work. 

I’m not a super audiophile or anything but I have a Harmon Kardon receiver I got as a gift and it’s from 2003. I also have a Yahama receiver my brother bought me(for his benefit, because of the new features which in my mind wasn’t worth it seeing as I still have a network cable attached to it.)

All my speakers I have are secondhand. I just don’t understand what really is breaking on the SONO stuff that warrants buying all new equipment from them aside from the software issue. If there was an inkling that they would have done this type of underhanded obsolescence  then everyone in this thread and subreddit that are from them are actually part of the problem and not the solution. 

Anyway I want to learn and know. I would really appreciate any info. I’ll be googling stuff as I have and now I’m on their website


(I have electrical engineering degree and my resume reads as THIS BOI IS COMPETENT AF.)"
sonos,ff9byfl,t3_erzg66,1579709481.0,"I hope this makes it to the front page. There is no reason bluetooth speakers should become obsolete. Did a new technology emerge that makes all other speaker components obsolete or is the software that it's paired too?
