I don't like communism either, its a very faulty method of government that makes corruption way to easy.  But what does that make you if you become abusive over it?

I have known plenty of people who just don't care about how they treat others.  There is no justification for someone's bad or abusive behavior and there is nothing wrong with hoping people who act terribly get the consequences deserving of those bad actions.  In this case, negative reinforcement of the extreme kind was used.  He didn't do it to be mean, or terrible but as a reaction to someone else's behavior."

So far my theory is that there is a fear culture among police.  Despite having the authority, the weaponry and the training cops are taught to fear for their lives.  Some of it becomes racial as they are taught to be fearful of minorities while others are projected from one cop to the rest.  So far this is my theory.
