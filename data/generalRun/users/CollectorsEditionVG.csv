Some one has to get the resources..  we built a fucking dyson sphere, automated mining ships arent beyond the scope of our civilization.

They would also require immense power... unlimited power provided by your friendly folks at Dyson sphere. 

Like fuck, it's not hard to use your brain and think about it. 

If there is a bias in anyone arguement it is yours since you cant actually come up with a logical arguement and have to resort to stupid things like ""communist utopia"", ""you're biased and nitpicking""

Heres the truth, you have no idea how anything works, you have zero clue on what capitalism actually is, you assume that anything that isn't capitalism is instantly communist, and cant bear to think that your narrow world view might be destroyed. Capitalism isn't the future, neither is communism. Chances are that if we become an interstellar species we'll revert to feudalism again because that's how our species works. Short term future is well become a capitalist feudalism hybrid where corporations rule. Eventually we'll breakdown and overthrow those rulers and turn into something different maybe socialism, maybe something beyond that, who knows... but in a world of unlimited resources and energy capitalism could only exist by making artificial limits for those unlimited resources."

Therefore it is not unrealistic for me to say that Creation is just a bad engine and so that has an effect on anything developed on it. By your original statement we would both be wrong."
Showerthoughts,ff3ofsb,t1_ff3hbrq,1579545412.0,"That's correct, but supply will dwarf demand by multiple orders of magnitude. While demand won't stop, it will be satisfied completely and in abundance. Supply and demand model of Capitalism relies on over demand and under supply to make prices go up. Over supply and the prices fall. Using Dyson spheres to create a theoretical limitless supply of energy means that there will always be an over supply of energy and therefore practically worthless. The same goes for physical materials. If we have the technology to create a Dyson sphere then we have the tech to create massive super structure like planet crackers, able to mine and entire planet with minimal effort. Coupled with FTL travel we now have an almost unlimited supply of physical materials. Meaning that even the rarest material on earth could be in over supply and then also worthless... but let's go further. Lets take star trek as a best case scenario and use their replicators. Based on what we see in the shows, replicators appear to create things from nothing... or rather they assemble and combine elements on an atomic scale building it up into an object. Let's say the replicators do that by taking modifying available elements and adding or removing protons. Essentially any material could become any other material. So by cracking a planet and harvesting everything on it you would essentially just need to reduce everything down to its base atomic structure, theoretically you could split the atoms down to protons, electrons and neutrons and then recombine them into what ever you wanted. So now that you can create anything you want at any time what would be sold? Why would they sell it? Why would someone buy it? There would be no demand for products because people could simply make it themselves at home, by using a replicator... which could be made at home with a replicator.

I just want to say that while I wish I could say that your post is bullshit, it's not. Most men dont give a shit about being fair partners, and they have a very warped view of what men are meant to do. My mother raised me so that I never needed to rely on a woman for anything. I was taught to cook, clean, sew, shop, etc. In my house I cook; clean, take care of our dogs, prepare lunches, do all of the DIY stuff, read to our daughter, do her hair, play with her, take her to the doctor, etc. My wife does most of the same things too apart from DIY, taking care of the dogs, and cooks twice a week.

Taking care of your home is a ""manly"" thing to do, being responsible is ""manly"", cooking is ""manly"", but most me dont see it that way. My FIL sees me cook and always asks my wife ""you sure he's not gay""... this is a guy who survives off of toast and ordering in if his wife isn't there to make him dinner. How the fuck is that manly... men should be able to take care of themselves and their family, not have to rely on their wife to do it.

Article 2(4) of the UN charter states:
All Members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state, or in any other manner inconsistent with the Purposes of the United Nations.
[link](https://web.archive.org/web/20160421122334/http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/un/unchart.htm)

Since the General was killed in Iraq Iran cannot claim territorial integrity, nor can they claim its a political independence issue. Ergo they will be in violation on UN law if they go to war with the US, subsequently, any leader involved will be subject to war crimes charges.

Also per the 1907 Hague Convention (Convention Relative to the Opening of Hostilities ) in order to declare war there are a few rules. [Link](https://avalon.law.yale.edu/20th_century/hague03.asp#art1)

Article 1: The Contracting Powers recognize that hostilities between themselves must not commence without previous and explicit warning, in the form either of a reasoned declaration of war or of an ultimatum with conditional declaration of war.

Neither has done this... ergo not a declaration of war... also

Article 2: The existence of a state of war must be notified to the neutral Powers without delay, and shall not take effect in regard to them until after the receipt of a notification, which may, however, be given by telegraph. Neutral Powers, nevertheless, cannot rely on the absence of notification if it is clearly established that they were, in fact, aware of the existence of a state of war.

No notification has been given to Neutral states that a declaration of war has been issued... ergo NOT A DECLARATION.


If this had happened on Iranian soil, they would have had a good excuse to go to war and the UN would have little choice but to support the decision, HOWEVER, since it happened on Iraqi soil it would have to be Iraq that declared war. Iran could theoretically declare it if Iraq was an ally state, however, they are not viewed as allies in the international community.

In regards to the US declaring war, they must follow the same rules, the president also cannot just declare war, it must be congress as they are the only ones who have power under the constitution to do so. An attack on a target in Iraq will fall under the Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Terrorists which was signed on Sept 14 2001.

International war laws aren't that complicated. A single action, unless committed on sovereign state ground of the affected country, is not an acceptable reason to go to war."

worldnews,fcycy5f,t1_fcxl786,1578078256.0,">We cannot assassinate another countries military leaders without expecting it to lead to a war.

Sure because the US didn't do that all through the fucking cold war. This is not the first time that it's happened, and it won't be the last.

It also isn't a declaration of war and people need to get over it. Iran is not as big a player on the world stage as people would like to make them out to be. Even if war did start, who is going to come to Iran's aid... Russia? Nope. China? Also nope. Ok, Saudi? That a no from me dawg. Iran has very few allies who would be willing to raise arms against the US. There will probably be a rise in extremist action in places like Iraq, Syria and probably Israel.

People need to stop being so god damn reactionary. This isn't the start of WW3, this is not the start of a new war. This is an international incident that will be dealt with through official channels while extremists attack military outposts, fighting the same proxy battles they have since Desert Storm.

I'm not a trump fan, I can't stand the guy. Killing a general publically is not a smart move, it just causes more tension, however, it's nowhere near as bad as people are making out. Trump is probably thinking this is a power play, flexing his ""muscles"". The world will look at him not as powerful but as unhinged. Either way, other countries will be more cautious when dealing with the US, including allies."
