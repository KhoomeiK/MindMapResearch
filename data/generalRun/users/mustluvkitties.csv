My parents are my ROCKS. And they are as much my parents as anyone elses are to them. And I love them, and I'm normal! Lol"
aww,fee9jd0,t1_fee4tsh,1579029194.0,"Yes! I am the exact same situation. 
 My parents are the only ones ive ever known-just like kids whose moms gave birth to them! They also made it  very clear it was a decision out of love.

I still have the book ""why was I adopted?"" along with the inscription from mom and dad inside the cover. I treasure it. 

Tip: dont go to the adoption subreddit. They are of the belief that any adopted kid couldnt possibly turn out normal and feeling unneglected. This is not true and it does nothing but shitkick my self esteem. Save yourself

Many congratulations! Spend your time loving that baby!"

Guys kept dropping the sign and working, boss would yell. We'd all talk about how silly it was. Boss would say that's exactly the time they'd get a fine. Rules are rules."
