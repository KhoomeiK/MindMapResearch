TwoXChromosomes,fgvf7os,t1_fgtyw5r,1581147763.0,"When my wife and I are in the car going places, it’s normal for whoever is passenger to open a drink bottle or something for the other person. Whenever I close my drink myself and ask for it again later, what I thought wasn’t too tight because I only rotated my wrist to close it will end up being a full arm twist from her to reopen it. I find it endearing, makes me feel like I’m still her big strong husband but i do notice it and if I remember I’ll usually leave the drink less tight than usual. However, frequently she’s the only one who can open things for me. The reason why is I have very calloused hands, like naturally calloused, not just because I frequently use them for rough work. So the problem with this is they don’t grip very well sometimes. Couple this with me being borderline having carpel tunnel syndrome and my grip strength being greatly reduced when it’s bad and sometimes she gets a good laugh at me that I can’t open something she can."

aww,fggds31,t1_fgfcn8x,1580759753.0,"Well technically the AKC doesn’t recognize any breed as a pit bull. A few other organizations do but the AKC is usually the standard though. It’s usually used as a generic term for multiple breeds since some of the breeds are difficult to distinguish between if you’re not used to doing so. It kind of sucks because it means that breed specific legislation (BSL) doesn’t have to specifically call out the breeds, instead they call out the grouping.

And, as I like to mention this whenever I can, multiple studies by the NIH into the effectiveness of BSL have shown it is anywhere from detrimental to dog bite rates to barely effective at reducing bite rates if. The ones which show it as being effective in reducing bites usually fail to include if there is a corresponding trend in non-legislated dog bites."

But what does suck is getting out of the gym and driving home and hitting traffic. When your legs feel like jello your clutch control can suffer. Personally though, I love driving manual. It just feels more intuitive to me than automatic. With automatic if I need more power to the wheels to accelerate faster I have to wait for the system to recognize it and downshift.

pitbulls,ffn8qh5,t3_eu5l9y,1580063133.0,"There’s several study’s by the National Institute of Health which all have varying results of whether Breed Specific Legislation (BSL) results in a reduction in dog bite injury hospitalizations (DBIH).  Several have found the legislation to be ineffective and increase dog bites from non-legislated breeds, others have found they lower bite rates from legislated breeds (the studies which report this usually fail to include the change in DBIH due to non-legislated breeds). I haven’t found a meta analysis on the subject yet but overall what I’ve seen is that there is no statistical difference between the frequency of bite occurrence between legislated and non-legislated breeds. Any dog is just as likely to attack if not properly socialized and the only form of legislation I’ve seen would be similar to Virginia’s laws which require that no dog may be discriminated against based on breed and sets out specific requirements to be considered a vicious dog. It also sets out specific requirements to have the dog removed from the vicious dog list, namely passing the canine good citizen test."

Dogtraining,fdrut88,t1_fdqi8xr,1578690127.0,"A good dog trainer doesn’t even cost close to $300 an hour (probably varies by area though and I’m in VA). The trainer we go to does classes for about $150 for a six week class. They also offer daycare at $20 for a whole day and an extra $20 to do “workouts” where they work on the parts of the training the dog is weak on. Like I was having some difficulty getting my dog to heel at the right position because too far ahead and his off leash hand signals won’t work because he can’t see them. We had them do a workout and told them about that and after maybe 2 sessions his heeling position is pretty on spot (he gets too excited sometimes and wants to go faster than me at his natural pace). 

The point is that if you think training is expensive it doesn’t have to be and there are plenty of quality training facilities that don’t charge an arm and a leg. Also, not training can be even more expensive in the long run."
Dogtraining,fdqhr52,t1_fdpmyqj,1578666979.0,"As a pitbull owner, I feel really bad for those dogs. My pitbull was really rowdy the first month we had him until we took him to classes and daycare. He craves interaction with other dogs and loves his training sessions but he was a hot mess for a while, getting into stuff, digging, and chewing things. The training helped so much and he’s so happy. He also doesn’t bark unless he’s told it’s okay to. Our class trainer helped us train that with him too."

environment,fdlomth,t1_fdk0xt6,1578528808.0,"I wasn’t referring to any specific event. The fact is, the global temperature has been rising faster than the historical record indicates is normal even during it’s most extreme shifts.

Overall hotter temperatures lead to shifts in global weather patterns. They lead to increased droughts and increased tropical storm intensities.
Now, for the fossil fuel companies. The effect of CO2 on increasing temperature has been known since the 1800’s, Shell and Exxon knew of it’s effect from their own research since the 1980s. Regardless of the true level of human impact on global climate, to brazenly move forward pushing a product you know expels CO2 and other pollutant gasses rather than developing and promoting the alternatives to that product is negligent at best and at worst is malicious. To say that the product fossil fuel companies produce hasn’t contributed at all to the increase in temperature and the effects it has on things like wild fires, hurricanes and other disasters is naïve.

And yes, it’s not the product that’s evil it’s the way you use it that causes damage. Yes fossil fuels have been used for very good things. But to not warn the public of the potentially dangerous effect of your product on their world when you know of it is wrong and blatantly malicious. They did their research in the 1980s and that info wasn’t ever released by them. It was, in fact, leaked. They knew the potential impact of rising CO2 levels, they knew their product contributed to those rises and they blatantly hid it.

So. Yeah, they didn’t start the fires but they sure as hell contributed to the level of destruction they caused."
