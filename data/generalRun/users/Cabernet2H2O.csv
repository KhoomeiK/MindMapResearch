I live in Norway so we all have good locks of course. And I did once loose my key and needed a locksmith in the middle of the night. A reputable locksmith came, drill in hand, and had the door opened and lock replaced in ten minutes. I would not have paid him for wasting time on picking for who know how long.

I do however tjink it's possible to use them in a somewhat good way and that is for practicing basic principles. Set it to ""the lowest unbeatable level"" for you and just practice stuff like avoiding undefended pieces, opening principles etc.

Your goal could be not to win the game but just trying to keep everything defended while developing your pieces. Just that simple thing is harder than you think but of vital importance. Practicing this on a game that doesn't matter makes it a lot easier to focus on a single aspect since loosing has no consequences what so ever. And when your defence inevitably crumbles you can just start over.
