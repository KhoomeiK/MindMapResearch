ketogains,ff7soy7,t3_elthfh,1579657420.0,"You'll probably get a lot of anecdotes here, but the scientific evidence so far suggests that a keto diet has either a **neutral** or **somewhat negative** effect on endurance exercise performance depending on how intense you are competing. This conclusion seems to hold true for both elite and recreational athletes.

Glucose is the near-exclusive fuel of your muscles at real-world race intensities, but your body is far less efficient at converting fat into energy  than it is converting carbs, putting a hard limit on how effective you can be during an endurance race or sport.

That said, if your goal isn't to be competitive but just to complete it, you certainly can do that. You just won't be as fast as someone who has ample stores of carbohydrates to convert.

**Edit:** you can't just add carbs on a race day. When you body becomes more efficient at burning fat, you actually become less efficient at burning glucose, due to a reduction in an enzyme called PDH which assists in converting glucose into energy. That takes quite a while to adapt and re-adapt."

Just like everything, there are exceptions to every rule. Generally speaking, adding muscle is considered to be inconsistent with losing fat - one requires a caloric surplus, one requires a deficit. 

One of the exceptions, however, appears to be in novice or deconditioned lifters, where all bets are off. 

So it possible to add muscle mass while at a calorie deficit during keto? Sure, if you are just starting out with lifting and stumble across the right mix of calories, protein and “noob gains”. But it isn’t efficient and certainly isn’t sustainable over anything beyond the short term."

todayilearned,ff4ffc1,t1_ff469pk,1579562318.0,"I'm not sure the notoriously humble Gretzky is the best authority on his own skills. 

No doubt scoring was a bit easier to come by in the 80s, but don't forget that for many of Gretzky's years, if you eliminate his scoring, the rest of the pack doesn't look THAT different from today's scoring. 

Take 1983-84, for example. Gretzky led the league with 205 points. The next highest scorer was Paul Coffey, who had 126, and then Michel Goulet who had 122. 

If you took Gretzky out of the picture in 1983, the list looks pretty darn similar to last year's scoring race, where Nikita Kucherov had 128 points (and would have led the league with that number in 1983) and then McDavid at 116. 

This year there are going to be the same number of 100+ point players as there were in 1983. 

The point is, it isn't enough to say ""well, scoring was easier in the 80s"". It was, but when you take Gretzky out of the equation, it isn't THAT much easier. He was just so, so much better than everyone else."
