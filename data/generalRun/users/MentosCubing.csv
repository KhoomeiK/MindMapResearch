Also, it's a frickin joke, this is like bashing Wile E Coyote for not immediately falling when he runs off the ledge even though THAT'S THE FRICKIN JOKE"

slavelabour,fezl4wd,t1_feyv98a,1579458496.0,It can export in both PDF and PNG!
slavelabour,fezivkm,t1_feyoqfw,1579457785.0,"It has limitations, but yes, it can save in PSD! It will separate everything into pixel layers just fine, but I'm not sure how it does with text layers, adjustment layers, masks, or smart filters (""live filters"" in Affinity).

It has the options to attempt to save as a PSD in either the most accurate way possible or the most editable way possible. I don't know much about the feature (I don't have Photoshop, so I can't re-open the PSD in Photoshop), but I'd be happy to give it a try!"
DDLC,feyebft,t1_feybswr,1579444311.0,You do good work. I salute you.

facepalm,femq7o2,t1_femfi00,1579266376.0,"This is not child abuse. It serves the purpose of preventing the child from catching the illness in the future, since catching it in the future could be much worse for the child.

That's like a dad yanking his daughter by the arm to save her from an oncoming bus, then getting accused of abuse because he left a mark on her arm."

TeenAmICute,fels8ni,t3_ept2l8,1579229657.0,"Yes, I'd say you're quite cute. 

But that filter is horrible. It's like the app brought the brightness slider as high as it would go without any regard for losing quality, then added a Gaussian blur, then put a bunch of hearts on it, then ran it through a noise filter. Then scaled it down to like 480p. It's distracting as fuck and I can't get over it."

NoStupidQuestions,fe86kcz,t3_enyv72,1578923111.0,"Well, think about it in reverse.

If you take a lasagna and cut off the top half of it, do both halves still count as a full lasagna?

The top half might, but I'm sure as hell not eating the bottom half by itself. You know why? The bottom half has no thick layer of cheese on top.

Once you add that thick layer of cheese on top, it becomes its own lasagna. If you have a thick layer of cheese in the middle, you have two lasagnas. Or one really good but also quite atypical lasagna that was designed for the sole purpose of contradicting my answer."
