SuicidalPeople,ffp42eg,t3_eubrev,1580085719.0,"I can relate to you. I always have a hard time communicating with others when I am sad because I completely shut them out and if they don't understand, they just get annoyed. It's good to see that you're aware of everything, you sound very clever.
Stay strong, we'll make it through."
ForeverAlone,ffp380i,t1_ffne34k,1580085371.0,"This is true though. I know someone who isn't attractive, looks like a nerd and doesn't dress well, yet everyone likes speaking to him. Why? Because he doesn't give a shit. Confidence is attractive.

Confidence is one I'd the only reasonable I've ever been on a date."
TrueOffMyChest,ffp2a2n,t3_eu6lxy,1580084727.0,I just turned 20.. The amount of times I fantasise about leaving and living somewhere alone in a forest or on a farm is scary. I really dislike the current way of living.
amiugly,ffp21h4,t3_eu7kq9,1580084593.0,"You're not ugly. Just average. You're also too skinny, you're at a nice weight! The only thing I would say is maybe get contact lenses or try some other frames and maybe play around with your hair. But honestly those aren't necessary you look fine as is :)"
