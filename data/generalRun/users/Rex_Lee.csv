videography,fejvovj,t1_fejvk86,1579186927.0,"Yes, you can get raw output via SDI to either atomos 4k or the odessey 7q recorders - as long as the camera has the 4k update"
videography,fejv1ya,t3_epjoba,1579186508.0,"I bought one last year, and I have been shooting the crap out of it.  It really puts out an amazing image, one that doesn't get enough credit. People talk about the 8 bit internal codec, which is true. But it will output 1080/4k raw via SDI.  I picked up a used Atomos Shogun 4k recorder and shoot in ProresHQ most of the time, and it puts out a really great image with a lot of color information. But let me be really honest, the internal footage is really good as long as you expose it right.

Some things I love about it coming from mirrorless and DSLR cameras:

1. The image. Very detailed, but still somewhat filmic. Especially if you are shooting in something like ProresHQ
2. The built in ND filters. Man, this makes it so easy to keep my aperture where i want it. I don't know how I lived withthout this.
3. 2. xlr preamps on here are great. The sound is really solid. I rarely bring an audio recorder to a basic shoot anymore, unless I know I am going to need 4 channels.
4. The autofocus. I know, but hear me out.  It has this button you can push, where even if you are in manual mode, it will find a face and then autofocus.  Then return to manual focus.  This is surprisingly handy.

What I don't love about it:

1.The ergonomics. If it is not going to be on sticks or on a shoulder rig, I pretty much won't use it. I'd rather use my A7SII or my little A6000. Just not the most compact, or run and gun friendly rig out there, by far.

2. Specifically, the positioning of the built in monitor. Why the center rear? It makes it awkward to use with a viewfinder from a should position. It seems like it is meant to be carried with two hands and the camera op looking down into the viewfinder. I kinda hate this design. I get around this by rigging up an external monitor to the left of the camera, where it should have been.

That's pretty much it. My advice is, if you are shooting commercial or production stuff, this thing is great for that. I would even shoot narrative stuff on it. But if you are shooting dynamic handheld stuff, this is probably not your best bet. Oh, forgot to mention that it will do continuous 240fps  at 1080 with an external recorder, and 120fps continous, internal."
