VHS,ff7d0ja,t1_ff7b946,1579646710.0,"As an American born in the 80’s (grew up in NY), I’ve always associated plastic cases with Disney movies and a handful of other releases.  Cardboard slip cases were the norm otherwise."
Cringetopia,ff3v5rh,t1_ff3uhg7,1579549540.0,"I mean, to be fair, they did dismantle the Roman Empire."
Buffalo,feypd02,t3_eqx7rw,1579448637.0,Joe’s a great guy.  You should check out his book store across the street if you haven’t.  Always very helpful.
Buffalo,feukgnx,t1_feukbhw,1579387359.0,Thank you for saying something that makes sense.
Buffalo,feubkbo,t1_feubara,1579384967.0,"Rain and then more snow, for hours.  What about everyone that has to use the roads in the meantime?"
Buffalo,feu8bcv,t1_feu7nlh,1579384131.0,"In this weather and to those of us that have to work every Saturday and worry about our loved ones getting home safely, it definitely is."
Buffalo,feu727l,t1_feu0l7i,1579383775.0,"Fair enough.  Still unnerving to have totally untreated roads during rush hour,"
Buffalo,feu6fsq,t1_feu64rf,1579383563.0,Lucky.  All I’ve been seeing is spinning tires and accidents.
Buffalo,feu5ef7,t1_feu1z2g,1579383302.0,"I’ve lived in this city for a decade.  I usually see them out earlier and more frequently in much milder weather.

ETA:  work on the West Side, live in Black Rock.  Haven’t seen one all day."
Showerthoughts,feo86uw,t1_fenp1df,1579296390.0,What a twist.
VHS,feo7eux,t1_fenlla8,1579296155.0,I assumed you had picked it up.  Oops.

science,fel3bhi,t1_fel2482,1579213151.0,"Anecdotal evidence:  we called them “Coydogs” where I grew up (Delaware County, NY).  They were everywhere."
facepalm,fel24u6,t1_fel20hg,1579212413.0,Fair enough.  “OK Millenial” also would’ve sufficed.
AmItheAsshole,fel1b3a,t1_fekucm9,1579211912.0,"Agreed.  I’ve changed my life significantly with far less.  That said, if step daughter is relatively well off, as OP mentioned, 13k wouldn’t be terribly significant.  The young(er) woman is being an entitled dickhead."
facepalm,fel0kof,t1_fel0a73,1579211479.0,You can tell it’s funny because of the way it is.
Whatcouldgowrong,fehqpv8,t1_fehkxhx,1579121980.0,"Yes.  Respect the dog.  My pitties shove their faces into ours when we’re not giving them enough attention, and they love to be smothered (and they do the same to us).  I’ve also had dogs as a child that would have NEVER tolerated that level of physical contact."
Whatcouldgowrong,fehq0lb,t1_fehkh3q,1579121577.0,"This is partially why foster programs exist.  Not all dogs are ready to be adopted by the general public, and many good people take them in, train/socialize them, and give them time for rehabilitation."
Cooking,feek6te,t1_feejwth,1579035410.0,You’d just want to make sure you give it a good shake once or twice a day to prevent that.  Still a lot less effort/mess than making a fresh batch every time you need it.
Cooking,feej8ir,t1_feej3ce,1579034860.0,"Yes they are.  Just like fish and salt are the ingredients of fish sauce, which is used as an ingredient in other foods/recipes (as is a vinaigrette when used as a marinade or part of a salad).  Point being: ingredients can be comprised of sub ingredients."
facepalm,feej1n7,t3_eojl5n,1579034749.0,This explains why I’ve never actually seen a rock.
Cooking,feeijs1,t1_fee00nk,1579034460.0,"At any restaurant I’ve worked in that makes their own dressings, we’ll usually make a few quarts at a time (at least).  If you emulsify the oil properly it will come right back together after a few solid shakes.  I would say a half a quart would last you a week or more depending on how much you use at a time.

ETA:  are you (very) gradually adding the oil to the vinegar while mixing?  Makes a big difference in the long run."
Cooking,feehqyg,t1_fedxgj6,1579033997.0,"How is it not?  Oil and vinegar are ingredients.  When you mix them together, the combination is an ingredient.  When do you ever eat/drink a vinaigrette by itself?"
Cooking,fe6gx6w,t3_ent1dk,1578890552.0,All I can say is that it’s a better scenario than too much salt.
food,fdyfmrd,t1_fdydkef,1578779265.0,"Is the tomato usually cooked in the broth or do they just give you fresh tomato with the other stuff (bean sprouts, Thai basil, etc)?"
food,fdybr6y,t1_fdxxtnb,1578778055.0,"Yeah... what?  I’ve had a lot of variations of pho in a lot of places, but none have ever had tomato or avocado."
meat,fdry968,t1_fdrb8hk,1578691484.0,"You don’t need flour to get a good sear.  Use a heavy cast iron pan or Dutch oven, coat base of pan with canola oil/other oil with high smoke point, and heat until almost smoking.  Dry brisket really well with paper or kitchen towels and season with kosher salt and cracked pepper before searing.  You’ll need extra time on each side without the flour, but it’ll be delicious."
Showerthoughts,fdrk3dm,t1_fdqiwqd,1578685632.0,I want a car that screams “AAAAAAAAGGGGGGGHHHHHHH!!!” with increasing intensity as you accelerate.
Buffalo,fdnshks,t3_emc2m9,1578591934.0,"I’ve used it for Wegmans, BJ’s, and Restaurant Depot.  The only place I’ve ever had issues with is Restaurant Depot as it’s a nightmare to navigate and many of their items are improperly listed."
Buffalo,fdidjgf,t1_fdi7w1k,1578440459.0,"What area do you live in?  I’m in Black Rock and my backyard’s essentially been a swamp for most of this winter.

Edit:  that went over my head."
Buffalo,fdhhkfd,t1_fdhgvgt,1578422792.0,"You could be right, but I prefer to believe that some insomniac hoarder is rounding up old Christmas trees and storing them in their attic."
Buffalo,fdhf92o,t1_fdhe8u8,1578421402.0,"I was asking why you, specifically, were driving around with a backhoe after midnight, implying you were the culprit.  Where are you hiding the trees?"
Buffalo,fdhdw36,t1_fdhcyea,1578420617.0,"Why are you driving a vehicle with a backhoe around the city after midnight?
PS If they don’t want it back, I’ll take it."

Buffalo,fd50jly,t3_ek2kw7,1578172964.0,"A.  Walk around Allentown and look for signs.  There are a handful of people that rent out non-apartment spaces.  

B. Check out Wasteland Studio.  May cost you slightly more, but it’s a cool building with lots of spaces and a house recording studio.  Owner’s a good guy as well.

ETA: you’ll really want to do some footwork and physically look around.  A lot of great spots are unlisted."
Buffalo,fcz3e5c,t1_fcz2tne,1578092854.0,"And you are very much unaware of my background.  I grew up in one of the poorest counties in NYS.  I lived, for years of my adult life, deciding whether to pay bills or buy food.  Fortunately I’m no longer in that situation.  
That said, I was offering an alternative solution to OP, not having mentioned financial difficulties, that would circumvent a lot of confusion regarding various forms of state ID’s."
Buffalo,fcz1opc,t1_fcz1brb,1578091880.0,"If you have a job that is requiring you to travel frequently via flight, $145 is more than likely not going to put a dent in your savings."
Buffalo,fcz010d,t1_fcyyy46,1578090874.0,"Were finances ever mentioned as a factor in the original post?  There are benefits to having a passport that extend beyond its 
$145 price tag."
Buffalo,fcymghr,t3_ejkhfu,1578082740.0,"I don’t know the specifics regarding Real ID, but we do have a passport agency downtown that’s pretty quick and painless if you fill out the appropriate forms beforehand.  Main benefit being that it’s valid for 10 years.

ETA: I realize this isn’t particularly relevant in regards to OP’s question but when is it a bad idea to have a Passport?"
facepalm,fcylqil,t1_fcxcx7b,1578082340.0,They have potential.

Cooking,fc6jguz,t1_fc5y8s8,1577482042.0,"I’ve worked in restaurants for two decades and have never heard of this happening nor experienced it in the kitchen.  Maybe it’s because I’ve only cooked seafood (or cooked in general) in landlocked cities.  
Looked it up to verify: very true, apparently"
