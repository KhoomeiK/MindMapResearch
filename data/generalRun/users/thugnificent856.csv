todayilearned,fff3eil,t3_et86zx,1579874638.0,"One of the women who escaped had a son who came to my High School to talk about this uprising and he traveled with a group of actors who put on a play about it. The play was very bad and at one point I remember one of the actresses forgot her lines and was cursing to herself as she walked off stage. The most memorable part of the play though, was when the prisoners were making soup for the Nazis and while serving it to them, they all had smirks on their faces. One of the prisoners whispered to the audience, ""I peed in the soup"" and the crowd went wild."
