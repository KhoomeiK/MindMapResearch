RWBY,fff555r,t3_eszfu6,1579875955.0,"Having a timeline doesn't inherently create plotholes. What causes plotholes are the following:

1. Having an established timeline, but then wanting to claim something happened offscreen that there clearly isn't enough time to have happened.    
2. Having an established timeline, but having similar activities seem to take wildly differing amounts of time. For example, if an uneventful trip from point A to point B is stated to take a few weeks, but then the characters travel back to point A in a matter of days with no clear reason how they would be traveling faster, or why the initial trip wasn't using that method.    
3. Trying to shoehorn a timeline into an existing work that was not written with a timeline in mind. Just how long were the girls studying at Beacon before the finale of volume 1 for example? Who knows, the writers didn't seem to care, and trying to establish a timeline for the first few volumes in retrospect is just bound to create some logical inconsistencies as a result."

Frankly, something being 8x effective, like a Fire attack hitting a Bug/Ice/Grass type, isn't complex at all. ""I'm super effective against all of them, so it does even more damage,"" simple.

The complexity actually comes from the cases where things cancel out. People already have enough trouble remembering ""Wait why is my Fighting move only normally effective against Crustle? Oh right, bug resists."" adding a third type into the mix to have to remember which of those types do and don't resist the move you want to use adds complexity far more than stacking on yet another super effective does.

Correct me if I'm wrong, but I *think* your complaint is that in AC, when something requires you to wait for the next day, that means you have to wait for the next real world day, while in Stardew if something requires you to wait for the next day, you can just go to sleep and it's the next day already.

Comments:

0-mana: The standard expected use case judging by all the other comments already here. Per the author, a 1/1 Worthless Imp is summoned an dies in the battle, leaving Wilfred as a damaged 1/2 minion. This is above curve for a 0 mana minion and has some scenarios where the extra minion that was momentarially summoned matters, but as this is a class card I think this is actually fine. I'm also not entirely convinced that you would always go for this play over the other options earlygame.

1-mana: There's a good variety of outcomes here just from the evergreen set alone. Blood Imp dies without doing any damage, turning Wilfred into a Dire Mole, which did see play in zoo decks, while Voidwalker leaves him as a 1/2 with a bonus 1/2 Taunt which is very good indeed. Blood Imp becoming a 3/1 feels like the low roll among those possibilities. Standard cards add the Witchwood Imp which dies, but triggers its deathrattle. On an empty board, Wilfred becomes a 1/4 which is better than the blood imp case, and if you have other minions out something else could get hit with the buff instead. Wild adds in Malchezzar's Imp which trades the Taunt from Voidwalker for the potential to draw cards if you discard any, which works in discolock specifically but isn't generally going to get use. Still, all of the cases where you play this as a 1-mana card are at least above curve in terms of the stats you get.

2-mana: If there's ever a standard rotation with no extra 2 mana demons, this would guarantee a 4/2 which is above curve though a bit fragile. Void Analyst isn't as impressive stat-wise, but if you have demons in your hand the deathrattle can turn into a decent amount of value. Vilefiend is our first lifesteal card on the list which presents the interesting case of getting some immediate healing from the clash. In wild we double the possibilities, adding in another lifesteal and another taunt case, while also adding Tiny Knight of Evil which is just a low-roll and Wrathguard, which is another 4/2 but with a downside, including immediately *taking* damage from its effect.

3-mana: Both evergreen possibilities are just summoning a 3-mana demon with 1 damage and no battlecry, with Void Terror being a lowroll and Felguard being a highroll. Standard adds Nethersoul Buster and Doubling Imp, both of which are low rolls as they have positive battlecries. Wild adds yet more low rolls in Void Ripper and Howlfiend. Unlicensed Apothecary and Street Trickster are each a bit of a wash depending on how your deck is built. You do get a 1/9 chance of highrolling hard into Imp Gang Boss however, which is the only scenario where this card ends up summoning 3 bodies. On average I don't think it's worth the risk however, there are a lot of bad outcomes at this mana cost, at least compared to other options.

4-Mana: We're starting to get to the point where most options kill Wilfred, and so they become just summoning the given demon with 1 damage and no battlecry. Negative battlecries like Pitlord and Lakkari Felhound are highrolls in this case, while positive battlecries like Witchwood Piper and Portal Keeper are lowrolls. Sneaky Devil I personally find to be *hilarious* as it buffs up Wilfred enough for him to kill it, leaving him at 1/1 as the ultimate lowroll here.

5-Mana: Oddly enough this is just the ""Summon a worthless imp"" case again in standard at the moment, while there are a few possible outcomes in wild. Doomguard is the standout highroll of course, and Despicable Dreadlord and Floating Watcher have effects that can be taken advantage of. Even Malchezaar isn't a terrible body and that's the lowroll here, so as long as you're in wild, 5-mana seems like a good play, just don't accidentally try it in Standard right now.

6-Mana: Mostly you just get some decent bodies here, Illidan is arguably the highroll, but unless you have some 0-cost cards to play after Wilfred your opponent has the chance to take him out. Mad Summoner is the clear lowroll, and Void Crusher isn't much better. Some of the bodies are technically bigger than the 5-mana ones, but I'd probably try to spend the one extra mana first to get the 5-mana pool instead.

7-Mana: In Standard you just get Siegebreaker, our least recognized demon ever since it was that one that got added into the Classic set to replace Doomguard, a decent body with Taunt and an aura that buffs other demons up isn't horrible at least. Wild adds Fearsome Doomguard, which is just stats, and Abyssal Enforcer, which is just less stats as it skips the battlecry.

8-mana: Fel Lord Betrug is the only option here even in Wild, which means you have the interesting situation of being able to run Wilfred as a second copy of Betrug, granted that this is a copy you can't spend 2 mana after playing.

9-mana: YOU FACE JARAXXUS! ...or Sathrovarr, who is a hilariously bad lowroll by comparison. Wild adds Voidlord and Mal'Ganis as highrolls and Krul as probably still better than Jaraxxus, so playing this at 9-mana is much better in Wild than in Standard.

10-mana: Jumbo Imp isn't exactly a good card at the best of times. Not horrible as a topdeck I guess, but if you have other options you're not playing this as 10 mana.

-----

**Final Thoughts**: I think the case of playing this as 1 or 2 mana in the earlygame is very good, and probably a better use of resources than playing this as a 0 mana 1/2. 3-4 mana have too many lowroll possibilities to be worth the risk in my opinion. As stated, it's currently worthless at 5 mana in standard, while being *very* good at 5 mana in Wild, and at 6+ mana it's mostly just giving you some below-curve stats with the notable case of always getting Betrug at 8 mana, which can be interesting if your deck already plays Betrug, and worthless if it doesn't. So while there is the flexibility to go for some other options, this seems to be best as a 1 or 2 mana earlygame play, with 5 and 9 mana looking like significantly better options in Wild than in Standard."

stunfisk,fccpqgc,t1_fcak0mj,1577601188.0,"I've seen Vileplume with Torkoal as a strategy. Drought triggers Vileplume's Chlorophyll, and Vileplume uses After You to let Torkoal get fast Eruptions off, basically as a trick room alternative."
stunfisk,fcasi7l,t1_fcaq512,1577575748.0,"Unfortunately I'm not very knowledgeable about Singles. I know that Smogon's formats have pretty much all banned Dynamax in Singles at this point so if that's where you plan to play, I'd suggest looking at rain teams from last generation for inspiration. Battle Stadium Singles still allows Dynamax of course but it's an especially niche format now since official tournaments will all be using doubles, and Dynamax means that it won't really resemble Smogon's format anymore."
stunfisk,fca9oe7,t3_egtufn,1577565243.0,"Your friends are right that Swift Swim is a lot more relevant than Hydration for doubles, bearing in mind that as important as outspeeding your one opponent is in singles, it's even more important to outspeed *both* opponents in doubles. 

Status effects are usually using Burn to reduce an opponent's attack (which doesn't really apply to Lapras), or Paralysis to slow your opponent down (Lapras is already slow enough that your opponents probably wouldn't bother). Poison isn't very prevalent in doubles simply due to the pacing of the matches, stalling out *two* opponents is a lot harder than stalling out one, and having a second pokemon out yourself often isn't as useful for poison stall strategies. Finally, while there are some Butterfree and Vileplume running around with Sleep Powder, it's not the most common or reliable strategy, and since Hydration only cures the status at the end of the turn, they can still succeed in preventing your Lapras from doing something for a turn, effectively flinching it. 

Additionally, Water Absorb enables Lapras to act as a counter to Dracovish if you successfully predict it using Fishious Rend into one of your other Pokemon, and in theory it can be used to get heals from a partner using Surf, so it's generally more useful than Hydration.

Rain teams in doubles universally run Pelipper because as you said, being able to set the rain with an ability is invaluable. The new speed mechanics also present the opportunity to switch-in Pelipper at the start of the turn to set rain and activate a Swift Swim. Max Geyser can be useful for fighting for the weather against other teams that are trying to set Sun or Sandstorm, but if you're going for a ""Rain Team"" as opposed to ""A team with some Pokemon that benefit from rain"" you don't want that to be your only way to regain the weather.

If you still want to try running Lapras in a hard rain team, I guess I'd try a set like this:

Lapras @ Assault Vest    
Ability: Water Absorb    
EVs: 252 SpA / 252 Def / 6 Spe    
Bold Nature (+Def, -Atk)      
- Surf/Hydro Pump    
- Weather Ball/Hydro Pump    
- Freeze-Dry      
- Thunder

The nature, defense EVs, and Assault Vest combine to let Lapras live through some things your opponent might expect to be OHKOs, and then if the rain is up, you can retaliate with a perfectly accurate Thunder, a Weather Ball that's almost as strong as Hydro Pump without the accuracy issues, or just straight up a Hydro Pump itself if you prefer. Freeze-Dry hits targets like Dracovish and Gastrodon for 4x damage to counter them, as well as opposing Pelipper and Ludicolo if you end up in a rain mirror. Surf is an option for a spread move, as well as a decently powerful Max Geyser if you Dyanamax the Lapras, and if you're on a rain team then your partners probably don't take too much damage from it themselves. Hydro Pump is another option if you're running Weather Ball as mentioned. In addition to Weather Ball being almost as strong as Hydro Pump in the rain, it can become a surprise asset against opponents that set up Sunny weather as a powerful fire type attack, and if you Dynamax Lapras, it gives you Max Strike as an option to use.

If there's another Pokemon you want to run that you want Assault Vest on, you could switch to either a +SpA or +Spe nature and invest more into speed to try to attempt to outspeed some more things. Getting a Tailwind off from either Pelipper or Whimsicott can help with that goal, but 60 base speed still isn't much to work with. One of the moves can also be replaced with Protect at that point if you find that opponents like to target down your Lapras, and so protecting it can help your other Pokemon get their attacks off.

As for other Pokemon to include in a hard rain team, Palpitoad and Barraskewda are other options that get Swift Swim. Barraskewda is already a very fast Pokemon and has the option to use its Propeller Tail ability instead to get around enemy redirection, such as opponents trying to use Follow Me to protect their Trick Room setter. Gyarados doesn't inherently benefit from the rain beyond boosting it's Water attacks, but it's still a generally good water type pokemon that does get that benefit. Pokemon that can get fast, strong Thunders off can also be worth considering, such as Jolteon, Heliolisk, or a special attacking Dragapult. Raichu is also an option that can come with Lightning Rod to help direct electric type attacks away from your water types. Pokemon with strong Hurricanes can also be considered in a similar fashion. Dracovish is also worth mentioning, it doesn't get a speed boost in the rain but the rain does act as yet another attack boost for its Fishious Rend attack on top of Strong Jaw and going before the opponent if you give it a Scarf.

Oh right, bug resists."" adding a third type into the mix to have to remember which of those types do and don't resist the move you want to use adds complexity far more than stacking on yet another super effective does.

From a *balance* perspective, making sure that these don't create any Triple Weaknesses/Resistances is still a good idea, but it doesn't mean it's less *complex* just because you're avoiding the triples."

Comments:

0-mana: The standard expected use case judging by all the other comments already here. Per the author, a 1/1 Worthless Imp is summoned an dies in the battle, leaving Wilfred as a damaged 1/2 minion. This is above curve for a 0 mana minion and has some scenarios where the extra minion that was momentarially summoned matters, but as this is a class card I think this is actually fine. I'm also not entirely convinced that you would always go for this play over the other options earlygame.

1-mana: There's a good variety of outcomes here just from the evergreen set alone. Blood Imp dies without doing any damage, turning Wilfred into a Dire Mole, which did see play in zoo decks, while Voidwalker leaves him as a 1/2 with a bonus 1/2 Taunt which is very good indeed. Blood Imp becoming a 3/1 feels like the low roll among those possibilities. Standard cards add the Witchwood Imp which dies, but triggers its deathrattle. On an empty board, Wilfred becomes a 1/4 which is better than the blood imp case, and if you have other minions out something else could get hit with the buff instead. Wild adds in Malchezzar's Imp which trades the Taunt from Voidwalker for the potential to draw cards if you discard any, which works in discolock specifically but isn't generally going to get use. Still, all of the cases where you play this as a 1-mana card are at least above curve in terms of the stats you get.

2-mana: If there's ever a standard rotation with no extra 2 mana demons, this would guarantee a 4/2 which is above curve though a bit fragile. Void Analyst isn't as impressive stat-wise, but if you have demons in your hand the deathrattle can turn into a decent amount of value. Vilefiend is our first lifesteal card on the list which presents the interesting case of getting some immediate healing from the clash. In wild we double the possibilities, adding in another lifesteal and another taunt case, while also adding Tiny Knight of Evil which is just a low-roll and Wrathguard, which is another 4/2 but with a downside, including immediately *taking* damage from its effect.

3-mana: Both evergreen possibilities are just summoning a 3-mana demon with 1 damage and no battlecry, with Void Terror being a lowroll and Felguard being a highroll. Standard adds Nethersoul Buster and Doubling Imp, both of which are low rolls as they have positive battlecries. Wild adds yet more low rolls in Void Ripper and Howlfiend. Unlicensed Apothecary and Street Trickster are each a bit of a wash depending on how your deck is built. You do get a 1/9 chance of highrolling hard into Imp Gang Boss however, which is the only scenario where this card ends up summoning 3 bodies. On average I don't think it's worth the risk however, there are a lot of bad outcomes at this mana cost, at least compared to other options.

4-Mana: We're starting to get to the point where most options kill Wilfred, and so they become just summoning the given demon with 1 damage and no battlecry. Negative battlecries like Pitlord and Lakkari Felhound are highrolls in this case, while positive battlecries like Witchwood Piper and Portal Keeper are lowrolls. Sneaky Devil I personally find to be *hilarious* as it buffs up Wilfred enough for him to kill it, leaving him at 1/1 as the ultimate lowroll here.

5-Mana: Oddly enough this is just the ""Summon a worthless imp"" case again in standard at the moment, while there are a few possible outcomes in wild. Doomguard is the standout highroll of course, and Despicable Dreadlord and Floating Watcher have effects that can be taken advantage of. Even Malchezaar isn't a terrible body and that's the lowroll here, so as long as you're in wild, 5-mana seems like a good play, just don't accidentally try it in Standard right now.

6-Mana: Mostly you just get some decent bodies here, Illidan is arguably the highroll, but unless you have some 0-cost cards to play after Wilfred your opponent has the chance to take him out. Mad Summoner is the clear lowroll, and Void Crusher isn't much better. Some of the bodies are technically bigger than the 5-mana ones, but I'd probably try to spend the one extra mana first to get the 5-mana pool instead.

7-Mana: In Standard you just get Siegebreaker, our least recognized demon ever since it was that one that got added into the Classic set to replace Doomguard, a decent body with Taunt and an aura that buffs other demons up isn't horrible at least. Wild adds Fearsome Doomguard, which is just stats, and Abyssal Enforcer, which is just less stats as it skips the battlecry.

8-mana: Fel Lord Betrug is the only option here even in Wild, which means you have the interesting situation of being able to run Wilfred as a second copy of Betrug, granted that this is a copy you can't spend 2 mana after playing.

9-mana: YOU FACE JARAXXUS! ...or Sathrovarr, who is a hilariously bad lowroll by comparison. Wild adds Voidlord and Mal'Ganis as highrolls and Krul as probably still better than Jaraxxus, so playing this at 9-mana is much better in Wild than in Standard.

10-mana: Jumbo Imp isn't exactly a good card at the best of times. Not horrible as a topdeck I guess, but if you have other options you're not playing this as 10 mana.

-----

**Final Thoughts**: I think the case of playing this as 1 or 2 mana in the earlygame is very good, and probably a better use of resources than playing this as a 0 mana 1/2. 3-4 mana have too many lowroll possibilities to be worth the risk in my opinion. As stated, it's currently worthless at 5 mana in standard, while being *very* good at 5 mana in Wild, and at 6+ mana it's mostly just giving you some below-curve stats with the notable case of always getting Betrug at 8 mana, which can be interesting if your deck already plays Betrug, and worthless if it doesn't. So while there is the flexibility to go for some other options, this seems to be best as a 1 or 2 mana earlygame play, with 5 and 9 mana looking like significantly better options in Wild than in Standard."

Battle Stadium Singles still allows Dynamax of course but it's an especially niche format now since official tournaments will all be using doubles, and Dynamax means that it won't really resemble Smogon's format anymore."
stunfisk,fca9oe7,t3_egtufn,1577565243.0,"Your friends are right that Swift Swim is a lot more relevant than Hydration for doubles, bearing in mind that as important as outspeeding your one opponent is in singles, it's even more important to outspeed *both* opponents in doubles. 

Status effects are usually using Burn to reduce an opponent's attack (which doesn't really apply to Lapras), or Paralysis to slow your opponent down (Lapras is already slow enough that your opponents probably wouldn't bother). Poison isn't very prevalent in doubles simply due to the pacing of the matches, stalling out *two* opponents is a lot harder than stalling out one, and having a second pokemon out yourself often isn't as useful for poison stall strategies. Finally, while there are some Butterfree and Vileplume running around with Sleep Powder, it's not the most common or reliable strategy, and since Hydration only cures the status at the end of the turn, they can still succeed in preventing your Lapras from doing something for a turn, effectively flinching it. 

Additionally, Water Absorb enables Lapras to act as a counter to Dracovish if you successfully predict it using Fishious Rend into one of your other Pokemon, and in theory it can be used to get heals from a partner using Surf, so it's generally more useful than Hydration.

Rain teams in doubles universally run Pelipper because as you said, being able to set the rain with an ability is invaluable. The new speed mechanics also present the opportunity to switch-in Pelipper at the start of the turn to set rain and activate a Swift Swim. Max Geyser can be useful for fighting for the weather against other teams that are trying to set Sun or Sandstorm, but if you're going for a ""Rain Team"" as opposed to ""A team with some Pokemon that benefit from rain"" you don't want that to be your only way to regain the weather.

If you still want to try running Lapras in a hard rain team, I guess I'd try a set like this:

Lapras @ Assault Vest    
Ability: Water Absorb    
EVs: 252 SpA / 252 Def / 6 Spe    
Bold Nature (+Def, -Atk)      
- Surf/Hydro Pump    
- Weather Ball/Hydro Pump    
- Freeze-Dry      
- Thunder

The nature, defense EVs, and Assault Vest combine to let Lapras live through some things your opponent might expect to be OHKOs, and then if the rain is up, you can retaliate with a perfectly accurate Thunder, a Weather Ball that's almost as strong as Hydro Pump without the accuracy issues, or just straight up a Hydro Pump itself if you prefer. Freeze-Dry hits targets like Dracovish and Gastrodon for 4x damage to counter them, as well as opposing Pelipper and Ludicolo if you end up in a rain mirror. Surf is an option for a spread move, as well as a decently powerful Max Geyser if you Dyanamax the Lapras, and if you're on a rain team then your partners probably don't take too much damage from it themselves. Hydro Pump is another option if you're running Weather Ball as mentioned. In addition to Weather Ball being almost as strong as Hydro Pump in the rain, it can become a surprise asset against opponents that set up Sunny weather as a powerful fire type attack, and if you Dynamax Lapras, it gives you Max Strike as an option to use.

If there's another Pokemon you want to run that you want Assault Vest on, you could switch to either a +SpA or +Spe nature and invest more into speed to try to attempt to outspeed some more things. Getting a Tailwind off from either Pelipper or Whimsicott can help with that goal, but 60 base speed still isn't much to work with. One of the moves can also be replaced with Protect at that point if you find that opponents like to target down your Lapras, and so protecting it can help your other Pokemon get their attacks off.

As for other Pokemon to include in a hard rain team, Palpitoad and Barraskewda are other options that get Swift Swim. Barraskewda is already a very fast Pokemon and has the option to use its Propeller Tail ability instead to get around enemy redirection, such as opponents trying to use Follow Me to protect their Trick Room setter. Gyarados doesn't inherently benefit from the rain beyond boosting it's Water attacks, but it's still a generally good water type pokemon that does get that benefit. Pokemon that can get fast, strong Thunders off can also be worth considering, such as Jolteon, Heliolisk, or a special attacking Dragapult. Raichu is also an option that can come with Lightning Rod to help direct electric type attacks away from your water types. Pokemon with strong Hurricanes can also be considered in a similar fashion. Dracovish is also worth mentioning, it doesn't get a speed boost in the rain but the rain does act as yet another attack boost for its Fishious Rend attack on top of Strong Jaw and going before the opponent if you give it a Scarf.
