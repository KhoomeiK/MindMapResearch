Paranormal,fejfiut,t1_fbd2snt,1579171734.0,I know this may be a late reply but no go ahead if anything ill check it out. Whats it called?
spirituality,fegdary,t1_fegcvbc,1579088589.0,"Okay so by that logic. Are you vegan? Is every product you buy like clothes, phone, etc... Sourced ethically. By buying these things produced in sweat shops and shitty work conditions you are funding suffering. Riddle me that one. Did you buy your clothes from an ethically sourced company? Lastly, You right that reality does cause suffering cause I've been in that same situation. Turns out the first girl I tried opening up to had a tinder and was hoe. So you right it does cause suffering when hoes cheat. If anything its just objective reality lol."
spirituality,fegcphy,t1_fegcijo,1579087874.0,Its a song lol. Get over it. Not everything has to be 3rd eye woke super spiritual woke. That would be great but you have to realize a lot of different realities exist and peoples life don't get played out the same. Shame that you judge a man based off one song when you have yet to listen to all his music and yes he does go over real issues. Don't judge a book by its cover
spirituality,fef13fo,t3_eot7g9,1579045696.0,Listen to Tinder by Azizi Gibson. Good luck lol
AskReddit,fe9p99j,t3_eo3q9l,1578940266.0,Well I guess im fucked. im taking a shit at the gym
veganfitness,fdqc7sb,t1_fdqbzb8,1578662716.0,It gives it that nice creamyness to it and adds a lot of flavor to it. First time i tried chickpea tuna was when my friend made it but without hummus. Once i tried it with hummus there no going back lol. I know it seems contradicting adding more chickpeas to chickpeas but its flavortown lol. Also forget to add but also adding 1 Serrano pepper and some salsa valentina makes it smack.
veganfitness,fdq9fx9,t3_emq68c,1578660166.0,"You should make chickpea tuna with that. Just mash the chickpeas. Add in some avocado, lime juice, hummus, and some black pepper & garlic.b"
relationship_advice,fdguo83,t3_elbjjo,1578408767.0,"So let me get this straight.... A bunch of grown men are worried about what you wear when you go out? I mean do these guys really have nothing else going on in their life that they go out of their way to ridicule someone cause their just a jealous bitch. Honestly would just ditch the ""friend"" group you got. No real friend or matute adult just ghosts people and ridicules others for being different. That just sounds like some middle school drama typr bullshit"
relationship_advice,fdgu0l6,t3_elbrdv,1578408296.0,Tell your dad if he ever touches you again it will be the last time be touches you. After that just call the cops. If i was you i would of already done it. Honestly i don't like to call people fools but you are just running into a situation which could get a lot worse cause no mentally stable person is gonna do some outright creepy shit like that to their own daughter.
relationship_advice,fde6gss,t3_ekp31f,1578332228.0,Tell your dad if he truly cares about your sister why would he want her to go with a man who can't even commit to a relationship? I thought he wanted a man. A man doesn't cheat only fuckboys and children do. And if hes so worried about ex boyfriend maybe he can date him cause it seems like your dad can't keep their dick out of his mouth
cats,fddt4m0,t3_eksg1x,1578323305.0,Idk why but this reminded me of this rick and morty scene https://youtu.be/yj63wHMYNGk
spirituality,fd2gusg,t3_ejwaz9,1578147030.0,"I feel like you are just overthinking things and creating a problem that isn't even their to begin with. Will people judge regardless? Yes, however that doesn't neccessarily mean their judgement matters. Unless its constructive i don't give it any energy. I've been where you at before when I first woke up i got my first job in a restraunt and weird thing is just like you i noticed it. I'm not a shy person but it definitely made me step out my comfort zone the first few customers cause even at 1st my co worker who was teaching me got busy and a few customers were lined up and everything in me was screaming take the initiative lol. Which after a few more customers lined up i did and then guess what it wasn't even as bad as my mind made it out to seem. Even people commented on how nice and good of an employee i was when i had only been there a few days lol. People notice and pay attention. Heres what i need you to do... Realize where on a rock in  the middle of space floating through an infinite galaxy and your telling me your really gonna worry about what others think? Now I know it easier said than done but once you start you realize it ain't that bad and stepping out of that mindset will not only help you grow but connect  with the people around you. In simple terms there isn't even a problem there to begin with but only the one you created"
TwoXChromosomes,fcvi5vc,t3_ej1ro6,1578002595.0,Holy fuck tell your husband to grow a pair. What kind of man let alone a father let their kids be treated like that without saying anything. I don't give a fuck who did it. No one deserves ro treat innocent children like that and no offense but the way you wrote this out. It sounds like the dad is a pedophile and honestly i would stay the fuck away
tarot,fcvel7s,t1_fcve9j5,1578000469.0,Ok now i have to get it lol. Death is a vacuum I'm done. Very coincidental how after i saw this deck i saw a friendly big stray dog outside and had my cats with me. The dog was super friendly but when i brought one of my cats closer they looked like they had just seen the devil lol. They had this look like don't get me near that monster. Ironically the dog was super nice. But OMG I can't wait to get this deck
tifu,fcvdqa3,t3_ej0e2y,1577999958.0,This happens to me all the time in public lol. I used to be like oh shit but now I'm like eh... Can't do nothing about the good meme pages posting an e-thot every now and then. Not to mention some of those memes are definitely NSFW. The only one that has got me good was those memes that play porn on a random clip all while i had it connected to my Bluetooth speaker.
tarot,fcvdhiv,t3_ej2yky,1577999813.0,I love that deck gonna have to order it. One of the main reasons being I love cats and I love how the devil is a dog.
witchcraft,fcuytob,t1_fcuy45h,1577991236.0,Well if someone elses mindset is gonna effect you thinking logically that sounds like a you problem. I feel empathy but I'm not gonna sit here and say what she doing is even remotely right. Im here to bring judgement not worry about whatever fantasy you wanna live in. Wouldn't by your same logic though being compassionate might sway her to not listen. It might be that mindset which keeps her there. I'm not saying her being abused is right. By no means that piece of shit should be in jail but if shes not gonna bring that judgement towards him why even bother posting? Why even bother caring?
witchcraft,fcuxn7m,t1_fcuwpo5,1577990583.0,"Ok well would you prefer i sugarcoat and hold her hand while I'm at it. I thought witches considering they fuck with magic would be okay with hearing the truth. She was even warned. That would be like my parents telling me not to touch the hot stove and still did. What did i expect  would happen? It doesn't take experience to need to know something you are doing is wrong and dumb like OPs decision. Im tired of a lot of communities involving magic, 3rd eye shit, etc... Seem to think that life is all fun and games. It really is that easy. I've known girls who stayed with their abusers cause they threatened to kill themselves which guess what after they left their abusers they didn't. Ironically i gave them all solid advice and yet they waited until it got so bad to finally leave. Had i been more upfront maybe they would of tooken the message but then again thats how soft society has become with speaking objective truth. Or here ill take some of your advice. OMG OP im so sorry that you were warned beforehand about your actions and still went ahead and did it. Even went as far as shifting someones spiritual path all to be selfish cause she was in heat like a dog. Actually i take back I've seen dogs that listen better. And now shes getting abused and even with all these signs in front of her all she is worried about is hopefully reversing the spell because still her intentions are selfish and still wants him. Otherwise she would of just called the cops, stayed the fuck away from him, & settle this in court but then again that would make too much sense right."
witchcraft,fcuo65a,t3_eiy2nd,1577985148.0,I mean i don't mean to sound like an asshole but just dump him its that easy. And also you probably got some karmic dues that you are gonna have to pay after this cause of what you did. Who knows whete this guy might have been had you not did what you did? Right now safety first. Like seriously get out of your emotions and start thinking rationally

spirituality,fcsgst6,t3_eilvd5,1577916314.0,"A dead hawk is a serious symbol. Hawks are known for having beautiful eyesight. They can see their prey from miles away, swoop down, and take it up in their mouths, killing it. They are also known for being keen and cunning. Therefore if you see a dead hawk it means that you feel like those faculties which make you special are dying out. You no longer feel that same amount of fervor that you had before and you do not feel as strong as you used to in the face of all of it. A dead hawk means you feel like you can see your sight going away and you do not like it. From what wrote this sounds like it could relate to you. Also want to add i can do a free oracle card reading if you message me. Anyways, I've been in those shoes before not same scenario but definitely very similar and just stay strong and keep moving forward. Regardless the sun will always set the day. Peace and blessings and hope all goes well. 🙏"

cats,fclyl83,t1_fclh5vo,1577759651.0,"I would of but when my dad got there not too long after his body was stiff and I couldn't feel his heartbeat anymore. He completely stopped breathing and I feel his last gasps that he had where simply his heart tryna keep beating and pumping his body. I could tell it was too late and he passed away. Honestly, haven't cried like that in a while. He was finally recently getting really close to me. Rip Turok the Dinosaur Hunter Dec. 30 2019."
cats,fcl8iy2,t1_fckz13t,1577742117.0,It just happened right now too. He's gone and I can feel it.
cats,fcl8fq8,t1_fckz13t,1577742059.0,"Fuck.... He passed away. I was about to take him to the vet and waiting for my dad to get home in like 20 mins cause I don't have a car. I was getting ready and changing over from my work clothes and next thing you know I find him looking even more sick so I start rushing and as I go to check on him he looks worse. His whole body stopped moving and the only thing I could feel was his heartbeat going faster and faster and then boom he just let out a last gasp for breath and after that I tried feeling him, calling his name, & nothing.... No response... Rip Turok The Dinosaur Hunter."
cats,fckxvec,t1_fckwt2e,1577735532.0,I'm calling some up right now and letting them know my situation. See if they can help. If it comes down to worst case scenario I would be willing to give him up cause I don't want to risk him dying.
cats,fckxo1f,t1_fckxass,1577735407.0,"That's what I was thinking. I really grew close to the little guy these past 2 months since I found him. It just trips me out cause yesterday has was perfectly fine. Running around and even slept on my thighs yesterday. I'm looking around my area right now for shelters/vets, human societies and gonna call them up and let them know my situation. If worse comes to worse I guess I just have to be willing to give him up. I want him yes but his health is more important than my wants right now."
