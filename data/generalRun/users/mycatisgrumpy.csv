PoliticalDiscussion,ffi5u7u,t3_etbq3p,1579965878.0,"While a sugar tax can be effective, it's just slapping a band aid on a more fundamental issue. The heart of the problem is that unhealthy foods don't have to be cheaper. It's a result of a farm subsidy program that incentivizes farmers to produce corn for high fructose corn syrup and corn fed beef. Essentially, with farm subsidies which make those the most profitable crops, the department of agriculture is subsidizing sugary snacks, soda, and fast food hamburgers. Changing the structure of agricultural subsidies, as I believe numerous European countries have already done, would give incentives for farmers to produce more healthier food, and naturally make healthier food cheaper and unhealthy food more expensive.

bestof,few3il4,t1_fevql8u,1579404831.0,"Paraphrased from Wikipedia and her website: 

-She spent 30 years as a law professor teaching classes on financial law, bankruptcy, and contracts at prestigious schools

-As a law professor she conducted groundbreaking research focusing on the the causes of middle class bankruptcy, research which changed her own views and led to her becoming an advocate for the working class

-She served as chair of the Congressional oversight panel overseeing TARP program

-As a special advisor to the secretary of the treasury during the Obama administration, she was instrumental in creating the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau

-She's the author of numerous books and academic papers on the subject of, among other things, middle class bankruptcy and medical debt

So no, she doesn't have a degree in taxing rich people, but she's been studying finance and economic policy her entire life, and before winning a Senate seat was already a nationally recognized consumer advocate and expert on bankruptcy and financial law.

So, In my opinion, she is possibly the single most qualified elected official to take on these issues. Which she could still do as a senator if Bernie wins. Just saying :D"
bestof,feunpwo,t1_feuku55,1579388322.0,"I see that you'd still support her for president, and I thank you for that. But I urge you to read Warren's resume. She's forgotten more about economic policy than most politicians will ever learn, and she has a consistent history of fighting for regular folks. A wealth tax would certainly be tricky to implement and to enforce, but if she gets into office and she thinks it will work, I'm more than willing to give it a try. I may not agree with every detail of her policy, but I can't deny that she's an expert on the subject."
bestof,feuk9nk,t1_feuha2m,1579387287.0,"You could well be right about Warren's greater ability to push her policies through Congress. I'm still supporting Sanders because his political beliefs are closer to mine, and what can I say I'm an idealist. I gotta try. 

On the whole I think it's an important reminder that there aren't any perfect candidates, and even well meaning ones can occasionally step in the poopy. I think we'll have to agree to disagree at this point, but I must say this has been refreshingly civil, and I'd be absolutely honored to support and cast my vote for Warren in the general election."
bestof,feu9u14,t1_feu7g6a,1579384574.0,"These are all valid points. But as a counterpoint, Bernie has been in politics longer than most of us have been alive. I've often been impressed by his near supernatural ability to dodge gotcha questions. It's possible that he did a quick mental calculation and decided that his least worst option was an unequivocal denial. Trying to qualify or add nuance could have likely added more gasoline than anything.

But again, that's pure conjecture on my part. In the end I think Bernie's consistent history on the issue speaks for itself. And really, even if he did flat out say that, (which I highly doubt,) it's still a valid opinion. I mean, lots of people don't think an elderly Jewish socialist could get elected either. I disagree with both, but in the brutal world of realpolitik they're valid opinions which don't reflect poorly on the people who hold them."

AdviceAnimals,fe6h1j2,t1_fe6f7xg,1578890656.0,"There are a lot of facets to the problem, but that's certainly a big part of it. Unlike many countries, in America it's taken as a given that a home's value will consistently rise, and every home owner plans their future around that. For most people a home is the single largest part of their financial portfolio. And for that reason, and because homeowners are far more likely to vote, anything that even has a chance of lowering home prices is political suicide. 

And don't even get me started about the bloodsuckers controlling the rental market and the NIMBYs that prevent any kind of growth because they'd apparently rather see the streets of their bucolic little town clogged with homeless people than see a high rise apartment building."
