UBC,ffjlwyh,t1_ffjb3ua,1580001270.0,Could be an emotional support pet that was legitimately allowed in there but who knows
UBC,ffjlv0d,t1_ffjgfpl,1580001235.0,"Sometimes they allow emotional support pets! I knew a girl that had a cat in Gage Apartments - she just had to go through tons of paperwork and get approved, but it’s possible"
UBC,ff8ocab,t3_es8494,1579688713.0,"If you’re down for piracy it’s literally so easy to get it. That’s what I did for one of my classes, took 15 minutes to find a good one and download"
acting,ff8nze3,t3_es1xts,1579688171.0,"I would definitely let your agent handle this one, they’ll probably just send an email briefly apologizing and ensuring it won’t happen again (and maybe some sort of excuse that is better than not seeing the email). It’s not the end of the world, but definitely won’t sit well with casting. They get literally thousands of submissions and they picked you to be one of the few that actually makes it to the room, so for there to be an unexplained no-show, is a waste of their time and could’ve been used for seeing someone else for the role. I really think the best move is for your agent to smooth things over here :) it happens!! And it’s just one casting office, definitely won’t warrant blacklisting... which is basically saying you’re done in the industry."
timotheechalamet,ff844wb,t1_fezv8pu,1579665486.0,I started reading it and honestly I didn’t like it and had to put it down like halfway through cuz it was ruining the story for me. The movie was 10X better and that’s coming from someone that always says the opposite.
AdventuresOfSabrina,ff7wgi7,t1_ff5q58r,1579659992.0,"I like that so much better than shows with like 22 episodes. I feel like then there’s less “filler” plots to just get something in there for the sake of time, and this way we get to the point instead of waiting for something to happen"
riverdale,ff7v1hj,t1_ff76ct4,1579659030.0,"Totally agree with that! Never looked real, but I think it looked a bit more so in the first seasons- so yeah totally weirder now"
riverdale,ff728v7,t1_ff61fde,1579639665.0,"I mean... they’re still in high school, they’re not NBA players. If anything this is the most realistic part about the show"
riverdale,ff724x1,t1_ff6zjnk,1579639604.0,"It looks super unnatural, I think before it looked more realistic redhead imo"
GetStudying,ff5gm7h,t1_ff591zp,1579591983.0,Totally didn’t get that you were promoting them! Just saying I think overall it’s better to catch some sleep than none at all even if it’s like 3 hours or so. I think in theory all nighters seem like a good way to cram but I just wanted to mention that I think sometimes people forget that sleep is necessary to retain info. 2 days in a row would be death haha
GetStudying,ff3jrcc,t1_ff2lqxq,1579542533.0,All nighters are horrible ideas. Your memories consolidate while you sleep and if you get no sleep you’re essentially erasing all the work you did earlier. You NEED sleep to be able to remember what you learnt. There’s tons and tons of studies on how detrimental all nighters are for test performance
timotheechalamet,ff0prbm,t1_ff0khkn,1579471139.0,SAME!!
timotheechalamet,ff0k1a8,t1_ff0j1m0,1579469572.0,"I hope they scrap Find Me for the sequel movie and just take it a whole new direction. I haven’t even read it because I don’t want it to ruin anything, and apparently Elio’s father’s story line just makes no sense. There’s no way they can ruin such a great character in the movie or I’ll riot"
timotheechalamet,ff0i74z,t1_fezvdm9,1579469129.0,"+ everyone says Find Me ruins the story, I almost would advise against reading it"
acting,fettuuo,t1_fesvpb6,1579380014.0,"I second this. Also I’ve pursued acting WHILE getting my degree (non acting related degree), and it’s one of the best decisions I’ve made. I feel like I have a safety net, it kept me busy, and let me stress out a bit less if I didn’t book something."
TheSocietyNetflix,fethga0,t3_eqj5wn,1579375518.0,Lol no
UBC,fdspsip,t3_en0cjr,1578706371.0,"Totally true, it’s pretty easy and saves you some money. Basically you’ll just input the iclicker number under the class you’re taking"
UBC,fdspoey,t1_fdsj0xx,1578706330.0,You’re literally asking people to make it crappy. Overall I’ve found it fairly reliable if there’s a bunch of reviews as opposed to just like 5-10
UBC,fdspkij,t1_fdshvjm,1578706290.0,Wait what? Didn’t know they changed this
UBC,fdp4dk8,t1_fdne4hq,1578619715.0,Explain? Genuinely just curious
UBC,fdp49ix,t1_fdoc76n,1578619642.0,"Usually no, the membership is for both terms for most clubs"
UBC,fdi7cqk,t3_elh0xt,1578437033.0,"Took a first year class as an elective and that first intro class where students are asked to introduce each other and say what they’re studying what year they’re in blah blah, everyone was shocked I was in 4th year"
Oscars,fcwnocp,t3_ej7scv,1578030873.0,"I actually really liked how it was just showing their lives and some mundane aspects of it. I didn’t really mind that there wasn’t one big story throughout but just a bunch of little instances. It was like being thrown into life at that time.... and really leaving with a bang considering the ending. 

One of my favourite scenes is when she goes to the movie theatre to watch herself and we get to experience that pride and emotions as she watches herself on the big screen - sure, it wasn’t “exciting” but that’s what made it so pleasant to watch in my opinion."
bulletjournal,fcwm9q2,t3_ej9phd,1578029620.0,Love this!! Reminds me a lot of The Great Gatsby font- so fitting for the roaring 20s
UBC,fcwlqt1,t3_ej9o0v,1578029172.0,"As a girl, I’d definitely split the bill. It’s 2020. We’re students, and it’s the first date. It’s a nice gesture to pay the bill for someone, but I don’t think it should ever be expected."
UBC,fcwlnw8,t1_fcwju1a,1578029104.0,Ok boomer
callmebyyourname,fcvvxgg,t1_fcv7dqp,1578011307.0,"Agreed. Honestly for me, the movie has been the absolute best, more so than the first book."
bulletjournal,fctguyj,t3_eisdcn,1577942850.0,I can hear that picture
bulletjournal,fcsxrxa,t3_einh2f,1577927787.0,Ah love this! Great Gatsby vibes!
TheOrderTV,fcp3lov,t3_eid4c3,1577849424.0,AHAHAHA OH MY GOD
riverdale,fclx98h,t1_fclu0yp,1577758703.0,More like poor continuity from the show
TheSocietyNetflix,fcj84sr,t3_eh1g0q,1577679678.0,"Did Dewey really have to kill Cassandra?? why? Because she was a “bitch”? If anything, that’s what seems rash to me. They don’t really have the means to keep him incarcerated and it would be easy for him to escape and go on a killing spree because they didn’t treat him how he liked. I think it had to be done to keep the town safe."
politics,fcj7d52,t1_fchaf6t,1577679097.0,I’m in psychology and can confirm we’ve already done case studies on his personality when learning about narcissistic behaviour!
UBC,fcijx2p,t1_fciah4f,1577663791.0,"That’s what I thought too. I have no idea what to do honestly. But the website lets you pick what department you’re in etc., and book with that information and your student number too I think, so I might book one soon- but again there’s soooo many appointments left I don’t think it’ll be an issue"
UBC,fci76rs,t3_eh3r6z,1577658546.0,"What the heck I didn’t even know they had to be booked so far in advance

Edit: wait... I just checked Artona which is apparently where a lot of people go and there’s tons of appointments left?? Like literally still 15-20 appointments left per day from January-March"
riverdale,fcbfkg6,t3_egurow,1577586246.0,I think you mean MarMaduKe
acting,fcbfbuh,t3_egyvkd,1577586161.0,"It would be really difficult. Auditions come in really short notice. Literally the day before you’ll get told you have an audition the next day at 11am. It’s hard to just skip work for it and there’s rarely any chance to reschedule an audition and if you’re consistently declining, no casting director will even bother offering you an audition in the first place. That’s why most actors take jobs with flexible hours or jobs that take place in the night.
Realistically if you’re not gonna put your all into acting while you’re pursuing another reliable career, not too much will come out of it. But that’s my two cents."
im14andthisisdeep,fc4hmvh,t3_eg0gee,1577416916.0,This one isn’t even bad?? Why are people posting every single thing on this sub now
