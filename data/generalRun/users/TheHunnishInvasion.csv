history,ff5m8ow,t1_ff5bhao,1579599864.0,"Not sure I'd say ""same government"" since 1066. England has had numerous civil wars in that timeframe. Several monarchs were overthrown.  In fact, civil war was quite frequent in the Medieval era.

What you can say is that Britain:

(\*) Hasn't been successfully invaded by a continental ruler since 1066

(\*) Has had cultural continuity since 1066

(\*) No major political upheaval events since 1688; mostly political evolution since that point

Being an island has allowed it to maintain more cultural and geographic stability than continental Europe.

Wikipedia has a partial list of [English civil wars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_English_civil_wars), but frankly, even that list is missing several. For instance, Henry IV took power in 1399 after a civil war in which he deposed Richard II."
AskHistorians,fexe29s,t3_eqsj8z,1579429485.0,"I'm not an expert on this subject and can only provide a partial answer. I'm more familiar with the history of Roman Britain, as well as economic history, than I am the overall Roman Empire during this timeframe. From Britain's history, however, there is a sense of Roman economic decline and the Empire being spread too thin.

One issue for the Romans was the rise of the Sasanian Empire (neo-Persian Empire) in the early 3rd Century. This forced the Romans to send more troops eastward to protect against this new threat. In Britain (and likely other Germanic frontier regions), this meant a significant reduction of Roman troops. While this doesn't necessarily explain the 'decline in status', it does at least showcase that new threats were forcing Rome to pull back from some regions (lacking the resources to fully protect everywhere), thereby making the Roman borders more vulnerable. This would put more economic strain on Rome.

By the 4th Century, Roman Britain had become much more vulnerable to Germanic ""barbarian"" raids. The Empire was often forced to pay off these barbarians in gold bullion. This resulted in currency debasement and higher inflation.

By the late 4th Century, coins weren't being minted in Britannia any more and shipments of coinage to Britannia were becoming less frequent. The Barbarian Conspiracy of 367 was an interesting event that took place in this timeframe. Several barbarian tribes simultaneously attack Britain at the same time from multiple fronts. The Roman troops at Hadrian's Wall also rebelled, suggesting coordinated action.

The Romans sent Flavius Theodosius to deal with the threat. He had successfully managed to quell it by the end of 368, forgiving the deserters and getting many of them to fight for the Romans once again. So while the Romans were successful at re-estabilishing control in Britannia (for the time), the neglect of the frontiers continued; payments to troops became less frequent and many of the troops in Britannia may have simply taken matters into their hands.

While this does not directly answer the question, the evidence in Roman Britain, suggests that the Roman Empire was spread thin military by the 4th Century, and this resulted in frequent payment to ""barbarian"" invaders, which resulted in currency debasement, and a decline of payment to Roman soldiers.

Whether this decline of payment was part of the ""status decline"" is left for debate, but it's certainly probable. What I can't comment upon is other factors that may have led to the decline in status; or even much outside of Britain, as I don't have much familiarity with the eastern part of the Roman Empire during this timeframe.

twilightstruggle,fdum8ks,t1_fdrgfk3,1578735184.0,"From my experience, it's probably about 50-50 between luck and skill. Between 2 evenly matched opponents, luck will probably decide 75% of games. An elite player, however, can still win a good chunk of games with worser luck.

That said, I'd break down the most important luck elements as follows:

1. Score card luck - MOST important
2. Event luck (e.g. ABM, Brush War, Junta, Destal, VoA, etc)
3. Ops luck
4. Die roll luck

The interesting thing about luck IMO is that it's players that focus on the luck excessively often think the die rolls are most important; or maybe the ops. But score card luck is by far the biggest driver of variance. It can easily swing games 20+ VPs; I've found examples up to 40 VPs.

Yet, it's all very difficult to quantify; and I created a system to do just that, but every game is so unique it's difficult to set hard and fast rules. While die roll luck is the least important of the ""luck elements"" IMO, there are also huge exceptions to the rule, such as die rolls that give presence or remove presence. Don't know how many games I've lost because a die roll where I needed to roll merely 2 or better to give me access to SA / CA / Africa, ended up being a ""1""! And then that one roll ends up accounting for a 20 VP swing over the course of the game.

I know Papa John's very well and I doubt it only cost $1.10 in food and packaging costs for a supreme pizza even 16 years ago. From their 2005 financial statements, food costs were about 24.2% of sales. $8 would have been a low price point for a supreme pizza, even in 2004, so food costs were probably a bit higher in this instance (e.g. 30%).

My guess is that a large supreme pizza would've had food / packaging costs in the $2.00 - 2.75 range. Still low, but not anywhere near $1.10.

What's weird about this stat on Little Caesar's is the labor costs. For an $8 large supreme pizza from Papa John's in 2004, I'd guess food / packaging costs around $2.40, labor costs maybe $3.00, and probably about 80 cents in contribution margin / profit (with the other costs being things like rent, utilities,advertising, etc).

Not sure how Little Caesar's is so low on labor. Feel like maybe they're shifting some of the labor and overhead costs into food for that stat. $3.50 seems to be on the high side for food given the low-quality ingredients LC's uses, while $0.60 for labor and overhead sounds absurdly low. Even if you only have 3 staffers making min wage, that's still about $30 per hour in labor. You'd have to sell around 60 pizza per hour to get that down to $0.50 per pizza; and that's totally ignoring food prep time, cleaning, etc. And 60 pizzas per hour is a ""weekend evening rush"" number; in reality, most stores aren't averaging anywhere near that many pizzas per hour. So the profit margin for LC may be right, but it's almost certainly higher labor / overhead, and lower food cost than that figure claims."

And then there are some scary things that are way more common than you'd realize, such as pedestrians getting killed by cars. It's been on the rise this decade as well, likely due to smartphones (distracted drivers or distracted pedestrians; either way).

Nominal prices = / = real prices

Nor is this even the most relevant factor. All-in costs of production are much more important here. If it costs $30 to produce a barrel of oil in 1970 and the price is $40, but it costs $60 to produce it in 1985, but the price is $50, you're still worse off as an oil producer in 1985.

I'm not an expert on Soviet oil production in the 1980's, but just based on my knowledge, I suspect that other oil producing nations gained a larger competitive advantage over the Soviet Union over time. Which means the Soviet oil would've been very expensive to produce relative to its economic value."
history,fct8rg3,t1_fct207b,1577935900.0,"That's a narrow view of how natural resource production impacted the Soviet economy IMO.

First oil isn't the only thing we're talking about here. We're talking about a wide variety of metals (palladium, copper, platinum, silver, etc). You could characterize most of those markets as being in a ""bust"" phase for much of the 80s and 90s, but oil is the one where it's easiest to find good data on (and was also the most important).

Next, there's a bit of a chicken and the egg problem going on here. Were Soviet exports a small percentage of the GDP because the Soviet Union was so awesome at producing stuff internally or were Soviets exports low because the rest of the world didn't value anything the Soviets produced very highly?

I think the latter is much more plausible. Exports were only 4% of GDP in 1985, because the Soviets didn't have much of anything to export beyond low-value (at the time) natural resources. And they were bad at that, as well, and couldn't compete very effectively with Saudi Arabia and other oil producers.

This is an interesting chart on GDP per capita in the Soviet Union compared to some other Western countries:

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy\_of\_the\_Soviet\_Union#/media/File:Soviet\_Union\_USSR\_GDP\_per\_capita.png](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_the_Soviet_Union#/media/File:Soviet_Union_USSR_GDP_per_capita.png)

Note that the Soviet Union was wealthier than Japan and Spain around 1950 but fell far behind both by 1980.

What's really going on here is that the Soviet Union had misallocated capital for decades, overproducing oil and other natural resources and underproducing agriculture and more value-added stuff that Soviet consumers demanded.

So I think focusing only on exports is problematic. If you're going to eschew exports, you have to create value internally, and the Soviet economy failed miserably in this regard.

If we imagine a weird, completely implausible alternative scenario where oil prices skyrockted to $200 per barrel in the 1980s, it's likely that Soviet exports would've skyrocketed and more wealth would've flowed in likely delaying the collapse. But the oil / commodity bust of the 80s and 90s essentially boxed the USSR in with no real good options to escape.

Mind you, the real problem was the underlying Soviet economic system, but the oil / commodity bust was the spark that ignited the tinderbox IMO. The Soviet economy was so heavily reliant on natural resource production that it couldn't withstand a sustained global downturn in mineral and oil prices.

In essence, all the talk about the Soviet Union being a ""closed economy"" is a bit of rubbish. It was part of the global economy whether the Soviet politicians liked it or not. Soviet consumers were aware of the growing wealth in other places compared to lower standards of living in the Soviet Union. There was no scenario where this wasn't going to lead to major turmoil.

You can also that this misallocation of capital impacted everything in the Soviet Union over the long-term. The USSR was held together through military might, which was in decline, as a result of declining wealth in the USSR relative to Europe, East Asia, and the US."

history,fcsqye4,t1_fcsnblr,1577922873.0,"I'm not saying that economic decisions of key policymakers didn't have a major impact on the Soviet collapse; they absolutely did. I'm simply saying that given those decisions, the global oil / commodity bust ended up being a major (and often overlooked) trigger of the Soviet collapse.

We can certainly argue that Soviet economic policy was short-sighted (it was) and that centrally planned economies typically fare very poorly versus market economies (they do), but my point is that the oil / commodity bust of the 80s and 90s had much more to do with triggering the Soviet collapse than anything that Reagan or Gorbachev did (two figures who are commonly central to the debates around the Soviet collapse). And said collapse was set in motion decades before via poor economic policy decisions. The impact of those policies was partly hidden during the oil boom of the 70s, but fully exposed in the 80s and 90s."
history,fcse3r6,t1_fcs6lm1,1577915243.0,"I'd strongly disagree with this as someone with expertise in financial / economic history.

One of the major (oft-overlooked) reasons for collapse was the oil / commodity bust of the 1980s / 90s. The Soviet Union (and modern day Russia and many of the central Asian successor states to the Soviet Union)  were / are heavily reliant upon global commodity prices (i.e. oil, gas, metals, etc). Oil prices peaked around 1980 and entered a roughly 2 decade long bust cycle before things flipped around 2000.

As much as people focus on political events in the USSR and US, I think way too little attention is paid to the fact that the Soviet economy was heavily reliant upon natural resource extraction and its collapse while, perhaps not ""inevitable"", was certainly made much more likely by the commodity bust cycle that ran from 1980 - 2000.
