TrueOffMyChest,fe5iv5m,t3_enrpda,1578870031.0,Being tipped is exactly what you expect as a server since you're not being paid adequately by the employer. I'm not saying you're wrong about getting rid of it and servers being paid fairly by the business. But since we do live in a culture where tipping is the norm and that is how these people pay their rent and feed their kids then tipping should be expected.
