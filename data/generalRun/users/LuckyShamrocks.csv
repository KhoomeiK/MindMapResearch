AskReddit,ffk8ed7,t1_ffk3wpd,1580018649.0,I agree that it doesn’t need to be a blood relation to still be family. I know things like surrogates and adoption are hugely expensive though. Adoption has giant requirements too and things like age and medical history can disqualify you. Fostering however allows you to make such a huge difference and impact and with much less restrictions.

BeautyGuruChatter,ffig9gg,t1_ffifok5,1579973153.0,That is wonderful to hear and I'm glad you're taking steps to make that happen for yourself. I would also suggest a hobby as well.

MakeupRehab,ffidymb,t3_etpqoq,1579971585.0,I'm already seeing progress this month for my 20 in 2020 project. I'm so glad that was continued this year. I did categories instead of products and it's helped me so much keep tabs on what I have. I set a big number goal in using up products and it's still early but already I have several empties. I'm really happy and if I keep it up I may just actually reach my target number this year. I dare say I may even be able to not have anything stored in my closet at the end of the year.

BeautyGuruChatter,ffic246,t1_ffi6o44,1579970300.0,">  Hoping this year brings great change for me, my brain is tired of the ""what ifs"" and I'm ready to be happy too.

If you are really ready and do want great change then you have to make that happen. It's not just going to fall in your lap. You have to make those changes and those new goals and get that new mindset. Work for it. Make a plan and go after it. You got this."
BeautyGuruChatter,ffibqmy,t1_ffhqpmb,1579970083.0,"The point is she's transitioning herself and isn't going to ignore what she already has. If people choose to buy something that is their choice and not on her. She's not responsible for others spending. Also she may not know of a CF dupe right now even. If you are CF it is your responsibility to buy that way, not hers. Nothing is stopping people from looking up things themselves. Besides she just bought a Lancome foundation in the video before that so she's not even sticking to it fully herself yet.

Edit: I just watched this and she clearly says in the first minute she will say what is and isn't CF in videos so people know for themselves, that the foundation is the only thing that isn't, and she's still going to talk about stuff she has that isn't as she uses it up. Plus I looked and it has been discontinued for a while and only a couple shades are even left in stock on their own site. She has this in the description too ""From here on out, all products that are NOT cruelty free will be a regular, non-affiliate link, meaning I will reap no benefits from your purchase of that product."""

BeautyGuruChatter,ffhawx4,t1_ffg9nsr,1579928308.0,"She said Becca had her tell people. Their nice apology only came after the backlash and lies and being caught red handed. I agree about everything else but that situation being handled good by Becca. They fucked over people on purpose and lied about it until they issued what you linked, which they still admitted no fault in and haven’t to this day."
Gymnastics,ffh1019,t3_etgafu,1579920213.0,It’s pathetic Bela was given so much power and control. He was abusive and left body after body in his wake. They knew what he was doing too and no one listened or cared. For them to continue on with the same old with Marta all for gold medals was bull. They both destroyed so many lives and still no consequences for them. So I won’t hold my breath that the organization now suddenly cares about these girls one bit. Their past has said for decades that they don’t.

BeautyGuruChatter,ffg2p7v,t1_ffg2m2o,1579897167.0,Yeah sorry. It'll relieve a lot of the pressure though.
BeautyGuruChatter,fffv9o6,t1_fffu2sv,1579892551.0,I don't think it's delight really. I don't think anyone is overjoyed and getting off on it. Just not surprised it happened really due to her past repeated behavior. Also being proven right isn't the same as delight either.

BeautyGuruChatter,fffrqbw,t1_ffeomhd,1579890361.0,The way Becca handled that was Jaclyn going on snapchat and making up a bunch of lies and blaming some factory for it all and claiming she knew nothing and Becca forced her into everything. Also lying about their being 2 palettes and her lying in the video how great it all was. I really don't think Becca nor Jaclyn handled any of that well.
BeautyGuruChatter,fffrf4c,t1_ffezsjs,1579890167.0,She fails on her own just fine without anyones help. And the fact is collab after collab with her has been ripe with scandals and issues and now her own launch too. How many times are people expected to really forgive her? How many times are we supposed to believe she is changing anything? How many times are we supposed to take her word for it with no actual actions being done? Redemption is possible but for that you have to actually WORK for it. It's not handed to you because you say oopsy months later. If she ever did any actual work for forgiveness and stopped with the bs and lies and blame game maybe she could have a shot....but none of that has ever happened. I can only believe someone is learning so many times before I just don't believe them anymore.

I don’t care if it’s a billionaire. If they want to work at a fast food place they still should get what every other employee is. What’s in his bank account is no ones business. 2 people should be able to take advantage of them both working and having that extra money otherwise you are in fact punishing them. You have to do this across the board otherwise you’re screwing people. The people I mentioned before and then some. The only fair thing to do is treat each employee the same.

MurderedByWords,ffe5ltt,t1_ffdxqnd,1579837309.0,"3. She should be making at least minimum wage as well. Just because her husband is working and makes enough for their basic needs does not mean she shouldn’t make the same amount hourly. Any other way would be unfair. 

4. The point was to be able to support a family BUT that does not mean that you had to do so. It wasn’t only applicable if you got married, were a man, had kids, owned a home, etc. Why? Because it’s unfair to others. One person should be able to support a family comfortably but that doesn’t mean everyone in the house should make less because of it. Your work, your skills, your time, etc are not any less valuable or worthy just because you have a partner. 

6. While you can have 2 dual minimum wage jobs with 2 people in a house it’s important to note not every job is 40 hours. So not full time. Many jobs purposefully only hire below full time actually. 

7. Minimum wage is not rare. Not by a long shot in fact. And see point 6 as to why many are not making full double incomes. Hours matter. And you just did a giant leap that again makes no logical sense. One person SHOULD be able to support their family. It shouldn’t be 2 parents needed to work at least full time for basic needs. You’re also ignoring all the people doing it alone. Or things like emergencies happening like death, disability, or divorce, etc. The point is to have it be an option to have 1 party supporting a family but that’s not a requirement. 

8. That’s not why we have low minimum wages now. 

You explained it fine before but I simply disagree. You act as if people who are both working don’t deserve to benefit from that with both incomes. That they should not have more money coming in vs a single income family. That’s just...absurd. It’s punishing people who would choose to both work instead."

Now if this is allergies I don't know but that's a conversation to have with a doctor. Also causes of acne can change over time which is why something that formerly didn't work could work in the future. Isn't that wonderful? lol. I will say though look into the ingredients of the topicals and see if there's anything that matches up maybe.
