WTF,ff6iadc,t1_ff3s1j0,1579627793.0,"Hahaha, seriously. I’m confused what questions he has.

Where is this? Somewhere it snows.
Why did he try to crash into him? He lost control on ice and couldn’t stop.
How did the guy know the car was coming? He heard a 3 ton car sliding behind him probably extremely loud and took a look.
How did he avoid the car? He jumped.
Why is he on the road? Appears to be fixing a flat tire.
That about sums it up op must be very confused."
