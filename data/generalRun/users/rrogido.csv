AdamCarolla,fdt4off,t1_fdruyob,1578711874.0,"Seriously, though. The number of times I've had earbuds in and heard Adam yelling at Drew about some noise I can't hear when the show is being pumped directly into my ears is mind blowing. But you can hear Adam eating or the dog making noise when I've got the show on a bluetooth speaker across the room. He's been gaslighting Drew for decades at this point."

GamersRiseUp,fclyp3c,t1_fckimrg,1577759727.0,"This is exactly what happened in The_Donald. It was satire at first, but it attracted people that didn't get the joke and thought it was serious.  Same here."
AskMen,fc6xfva,t3_eg5sq0,1577491988.0,Nine Inch Nails.....Just Like You Imagined. If I have to die in battle I want to go just after the crescendo with the lights going out as the piano plays.
