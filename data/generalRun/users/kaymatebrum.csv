I offered a lady, who was in the supermarket queue who only had one item, to go in front of me. She thanked my husband. I'm just invisible. I don't know whether it's because he's taller, whether they don't like my face, or what it is. It hurts though, a lot."

The one thing that helped me was using micro tape, the papery sort, not the plastic stuff. I used to put a tiny bit of tissue or cotton wool over the abcess/boil whatever its called (I used to call them gremlins) and secure with the very soft micro tape. It stopped the friction against clothing which I found agonising. Make sure the area is hair free before applying. Have a soak in the bath to remove it. The micro tape is very cheap from chemists. Hope this helps."

Hidradenitis,fdq3nj5,t1_fdq2xlg,1578653280.0,"I think it did help. It certainly made me feel a lot healthier anyway. I was in my mid 50s when I stopped and the hs was beginning to not be so aggressive as I got older. I still have the odd flare up, especially in the summer but nothing like it used to be.
Do ask your gp for help, they'll probably have a cessation clinic to help you along the way. I liked champix because you take the tablets and continue smoking, which made me feel safe. You give yourself a date to quit, I chose the last date within the period , but I had to bring it forward. I just thought, right, I'll give up today and I did. I left a packet of cigs in case I got desperate and chucked them away after a year without ever having another one. I just had no interest in them at all. You'll do it, I know you will."
Hidradenitis,fdq2t5w,t3_emp3ou,1578652086.0,"I too suffer with hs.  I gave up smoking after many, many years. I got champix on prescription from the gp and it honestly worked like magic. Worth a try as you're in the right mindset, ie, you want to give up. Good luck."
