thebachelor,fek2gs7,t1_fejsui0,1579191196.0,"I agree it was a disgusting comment. I do think she didn't have a chance to see the world differently though being raised in a brainwashing environment. She's certainly learned that phrase and didn't come up with it on her own. 

Will be interesting to see if after all the intense attention dies down if she improves her worldview and more importantly moves away from the evangelical world she lives in. I doubt she will as the judgment is harsh from those people and they are her loved ones. But she is being given a chance to open her eyes and learn.

Obviously there is plenty of insincerity and but that doesn't make a person not real. In fact it can often show that they just don't want to be a jerk and are in an uncomfortable situations.  So they are saying something that is nicer than they really feel and their body language belies them. Does that make them a less good person? In this sub it does.

I'm just tired of real being better than fake. When that often means being rude to others unnecessarily. Or getting grief for saying kinder words than you really feel."

That is the 1 reason people should be there.  Sure she was a little aggressive but my goodness the negativity toward her is overblown.

In fact as she was being attacked by Kelsey, she was kind and forgiving in her response, all things considered. She never was rude or even called Kelsey out for being pretty insane. But most people here are more kind to Kelsey (who has extremely low emotional intelligence) and Victoria F (and we know what she is capable of).
