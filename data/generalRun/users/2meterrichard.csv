DiWHY,ffq3ssu,t1_ffq2xw6,1580118882.0,"Fun story. Mate of mine was house hunting shortly after the housing crash.  There were plenty of foreclosures to pick up at bargain prices.  Most of the houses he saw had almost all the electrical and plumbing ripped out. A lot of precious owners weren't happy (and rightfully so) about their foreclosure that they'd just take as much as they could with them.  One, who was in the middle of a bathroom remodel, poured one of the concrete bags, down the toilet, and flushed.  When another mate who was a carpenter looked at it, he said the would fuck up the pipes all the way to the city level.  He didnt buy the house.

He goes outside the law because GCPD's hands are tied or it would be outright dangerous to try and arrest.  Let's face it. I don't think even the national guard could take down Bane without a huge cost of life and collateral damage. (which I'm fairly sure they've tried.)  He may go outside the law to get to the seriously dangerous psychos like Joker or Zsasz but instead of killing them, he's ultimately merely delivering them to authorities for their due process. He saves more lives by putting himself in harm's way to arrest those that normal police can't (or won't.
