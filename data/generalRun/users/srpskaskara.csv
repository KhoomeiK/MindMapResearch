fatlogic,ffx6z45,t1_ffwocu2,1580319054.0,Honestly I don't think the average sedentary person in the West actually walks that much. It's 5 kilometers per day which is not a lot at all but if you're riding public transportation or driving to work and then going straight home from work... You're not going to even hit that.

My grandmother has had Type 2 diabetes for decades without complications and she never had to inject insulin, only take tablets. 

But that's because she follows the dietary guidelines to a t. 

And that's the problem for FAs because they feel any dietary guideline is oppressive and meant to shame them."
