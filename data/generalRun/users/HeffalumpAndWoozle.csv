Thanks!

Thanks again!"
Newfoundlander,ffy2e1f,t1_ff96huw,1580337249.0,"We are looking for a little brother or sister for Heffalump, and I love the pictures on the Kloofbear web site. In what city/state are they located? I couldn't find an address on their web site, and I am trying to figure out how far away it would be for us - we live in Maryland."

rosehulman,fblw9ys,t3_edss0c,1576971940.0,"I recommend that you contact the admissions office and ask them what you can do to improve your chances for admission. However (and I don't have inside information) I suspect that the person below who encourages you to get a good recommendation is accurate. Also, I suspect the math portion of the SAT and/or the math/science portion of the ACT would count for a good bit."
