You want to see a bad ass go to work?   Watch him,  a professional in post production (utterly last budget consideration) consult a director on a better way to tell a story — enter Hans.   His gift is in how he works a room — his clients and a story.     He is the only composer who can make a director re-think picture lock."

It was also easier to sneak around as a teen vs tell them the truth.    Mentioned to them once that I realized when I was younger I started raising myself because with some of those typical growing pains in those awkward teenage years — I needed CBT not prayer and blanket bible verses that meant fuck all for my situation.

All this coming from a bunch of people who loathe their bodies outside of the holidays.   People made fun of me “cause I’m trying to be healthy”. — I’m not super overweight but I don’t want to feel and look ordinary — I want to be extraordinary.

I never have a single fucking issue until current company won’t shut the fuck up and paints you as life’s curmudgeon.   Except the other 364 days a year when I hear “meh I put on weight” “I hate mirrors” from them.
