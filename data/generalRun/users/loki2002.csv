PoliticalHumor,ff9zx4o,t1_ff9yz27,1579725070.0,"> No. But it's pretty stupid to expect the Senate to do something House refused to do, despite having all the power to do it. 

They didn't refuse, the called witnesses. The witnesses were prevented from showing up. The only reason the Senate won't call witnesses is to obstruct the process. Trials have witnesses and they cannot even claim to be having a fair trial without them.

> Impeachment isn't a legal process, it's a political one.  

Not relevant to what we are discussing; a trial has witnesses. I cannot think of a trial in any form be it through the justice system or through a private entity that doesn't allow witnesses. 

> instead of making a good reason for impeachment in the first case. 

Abuse of power and obstruction of Congress are very good reasons for impeachment. The President is not a dictator and is answerable to the people representatives which he has ignored for far too long. To think otherwise is to not want to live in a world where the Executive can be held accountable."
PoliticalHumor,ff9vij2,t1_ff9usi0,1579722408.0,"They did and Trump wouldn't let them testify. Either way, that is irrelevant. The impeachment in the House is essentially a Grand Jury inquiry which means they only need to hear enough to decide whether charges are appropriate and what they should be. Exculpatory information isn't included and the defense doesn't get to question anyone or present evidence. Although, the Dems did offer Trump the opportunity to have his lawyers present which he declined and Republicans were at every hearing and given equal time. There is no scenario in the justice system where a judge would not allow a witness simply because they were not used in the Grand Jury process. 

The Senate is not restricted by what the House did or did not do. They are conducting a trial and trials come with witnesses. It goes against all logic and common sense to not allow witnesses especially when considering something as important as removal of a sitting President. The only reason you wouldn't want witnesses is to rush through things in favor of the defendant."
