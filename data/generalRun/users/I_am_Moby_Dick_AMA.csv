I felt like my brain was stuck in like 3rd gear and I couldn’t get it to shift up no matter what i tried. I was on a **stupid** dosage though, they had me on 650mg at one point so I just felt like I was swimming through porridge the whole time. It took me a while but I managed to get them to drop it   to 150 and it’s now a lot better, but it took about five years to get the dosage down to that."
