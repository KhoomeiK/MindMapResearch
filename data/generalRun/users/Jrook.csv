So when the department of defense was created it replaced the department of war and navy so the Marines remained under the Navy.

And of course the air Force was made seperate and that occurred before the creation of the department of defense. 

So if you think of it like a family tree the  Marines were always a child of the Navy, and the army was the child of the war department. During ww1 the army had a child called aircraft.

After ww1 the war department had 2 children, army and airforce. The Navy still had the Marines.


After ww2 the department of defense had 3 children, the army, navy, and airforce. The Navy still had the Marines as it's child.
