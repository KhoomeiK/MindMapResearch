SuicideWatch,fdtnsct,t1_fdtbfe7,1578719460.0,I've been had the want thing down since 2016. I guess I was waiting for the survival instinct to be eroded . So everyday it's a pick and choose thing if I want to continue or go.
SuicideWatch,fdpuhid,t3_emj9tg,1578640986.0,This is why so many of us are still alive. Attempting and experiencing it becomes terrifying.

Anger,fdj2zkw,t1_fdirbvu,1578457091.0,Thanks i hope so too and I fully expect the anger to come back as soon as possible but one thing I guess that I pulled out of it was basically sadness and grieving for some people that ended their lives last year. But the sadness is way better to feel than rage. The rage feels like a demonic entity .
