CCPA has more exemptions, such as needing a company to be large enough, or being non-profit. CCPA also lets companies sell children's data (with consent), or exceptions for certain type of data (medical, etc). GDPR also applies to anyone doing business with people in Europe, while CCPA only applies to Californian citizens (residents?).

They are similar though, so while I might prefer the GDPR covering me than the CCPA, they are both good enough that it's a massive benefit to consumer privacy."
