AskReddit,ff7j9ld,t1_fec5vs8,1579650858.0,I think everyone misinterpreted what I said. I was backing up the comment I replied to that sexual preference is something we don't have control over so like the guy said if he's not attracted to a particular race doesn't necessarily make you racist. Just like the common bigotry that homosexuality is a choice and something people have conscious control over and that way of thinking is something social justice is challenging the outdated norms and bigotry.

Just because you live in a bubble comprised of your own validations doesn‚Äôt mean those that disagree with you are simply motivated by hate which is what you‚Äôre implying. The fact transgenders have such a high suicide rate is the exact reason why we should discuss the moral implications in an unjust world. I bet you‚Äôre quite happy to abandon a transgender that isn‚Äôt happy with their reassignment? Would you label them a bigot? For discussing alternatives to the narrative? There are bigots here don‚Äôt get me wrong, but they don‚Äôt have much voice because it‚Äôs nothing we haven‚Äôt heard before and adds nothing to the discussion. You accept that there‚Äôs one narrative and anything that challenges that narrative is an enemy of narrative (like blanket labelling everyone a bigot). It‚Äôs so obvious how deluded you are. You come here clutching pearls, secretly hoping no one challenges the moral implications of blindly following the narrative. You seem to have conveniently forgotten about LGBTQs that the left disowned, that visit this sub looking for some semblance of sanity. You say you censor bigoted discussion but it seems to me that it‚Äôs employed to quash any difference of opinion in most situations.

I say all this as an anarchist loving punk rocker that extols the virtues of DIY culture, and freedom expression whilst giving perspective to hippocrites in hopes they realise how bias skewed their logic is. I‚Äôve stopped trying to point out hypocrisy in leftist rhetoric thinking.  I at least thought the left would be happy to discuss objective politics and a contradicting agenda, in order to stop suffering of others, but it‚Äôs clear that morons exist on both sides (make sure to cross post this to enlightened centrism ü§´)  questioning and exposing those that use emotionally charged situations that loosely fit the rhetoric to push your agenda (of which more and more seem to be violent, or motivated in some way by hatred of the other side of the compass).
