LeopardsAteMyFace,ffd9iai,t1_ffcd2ck,1579816066.0,"There will probably be an FTA with the US, Australia, NZ, Japan and Canada within 2 years. Plus the continuity agreements with about 18 countries that have been signed already. These things aren’t game changers, but I just have to point out you’re talking nonsense."

The issue here is that no one in the thread understands tariffs, inwards processing relief or the function of free ports. They’re just all shouting about how much they hate Brexiteers."
LeopardsAteMyFace,ffd95b6,t1_ffcfyr8,1579815855.0,I don’t think you know anything about trade deals. Please cite a single FTA anywhere that requires ‘open borders’. Mode 4 commitments in FTAs which cover the temporary movement of business people are very limited in scope.
unpopularopinion,ff9tmgs,t1_ff9kp89,1579720999.0,"Ok, well I’m UK based. Here is a useful summary from a Guardian article (https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/jan/22/how-do-i-help-rough-sleepers-homelessness-money-begging-street)

UK homelessness charities are almost unanimous on the question of giving money: it is better not to. Some charities acknowledge the intended kindness, others are vociferous in saying don’t.

Thames Reach, which has been working in London for more than 30 years, says its outreach workers and the Metropolitan police find 70-80% of people begging on the capital’s streets are taking class A drugs such as crack cocaine and heroin, and in Birmingham all 43 people arrested in a crackdown on begging tested positive.

Across the country, four in 10 say they have or are recovering from a drug habit, and a quarter from a drink problem, says Homeless Link, the umbrella body for the sector. Charities and police also report that six in 10 people begging had a home to go to.

Not only does money often fuel addictions to drugs and drink (usually super-strength lager and cider), it also delays people seeking or accepting help with addiction or other health problems and moving off the streets, according to Thames Reach’s online advice, which says: “Giving to people who beg is not a benign act. It can have fatal consequences.”"
unpopularopinion,ff9ij98,t1_ff9602p,1579713753.0,"I can’t speculate as to most people’s motives but if you look at what expert groups who support the homeless say, it is consistently that giving them money is detrimental in most cases."
unpopularopinion,ff8pm3m,t1_ff66675,1579690602.0,"Numbers are hard to come by because of the nature of the problem but estimates of around 40% of rough sleepers are regular alcohol abusers and a larger proportion are irregular alcohol abusers. Similarly large numbers of them struggle with other mental health issues and drug abuse. 

People don’t really understand homelessness generally. I worked on the issue in government for a while; it is complicated."
YouShouldKnow,fezrc6m,t1_fey9y34,1579460666.0,"Haha, yeah sure thing buddy. Elgin vs. Ottoman gunpowder magazine: 

‘Greek architect and archaeologist Kornilia Chatziaslani writes that ""...three of the sanctuary’s four walls nearly collapsed and three-fifths of the sculptures from the frieze fell. Nothing of the roof apparently remained in place. Six columns from the south side fell, eight from the north, as well as whatever remained from eastern porch, except for one column. The columns brought down with them the enormous marble architraves, triglyphs and metopes."" About three hundred people were killed in the explosion.’ 

Tell you what, come see them for free in the BM and see if the damage seems comparable to this."
YouShouldKnow,fexspz5,t1_fexlu4w,1579435549.0,"I’m very comfortable arguing that the Elgin Marbles being on display, for free, to millions of people is better than them being ground into building materials or being blown to pieces by the Turks - which is what happened to much of what he didn’t take."

ENLIGHTENEDCENTRISM,fdl5t8d,t1_fdl0ke7,1578517541.0,"But it isn’t that simple; I worked in the justice system in the U.K. and we had a self identifying trans woman, who had raped two women (that has to be with a penis in the U.K.) then sexually assaulted two female prisoners, with her penis. A large proportion of women prisoners will already be victims of sexual violence and more than half domestic abuse victims - they have good reason to be scared of men. 

But many trans activists will insist that it is a fundamental breach of a trans woman’s rights to be placed in a male prison. Personally I think in some cases it is inhumane, but given the above I don’t think there is a clear answer. 

Who is right?"

But beyond that there were loads of things he did which suggested he was antisemitic. His ‘friends’ from Hamas, the vile antisemitic mural, the slow balling of antisemitism cases in his party. 

This stuff was reported in the Guardian, not just the ‘right wing press’.
