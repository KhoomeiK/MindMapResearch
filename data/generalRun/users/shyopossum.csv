I was young when the story aired but I still remember the news coverage in vivid detail because of how horrific the whole incident was."

ExNoContact,fepvgx4,t3_eq51z4,1579332754.0,"I personally don’t like the “if they blocked you, you’ve won” mindset because there are so many valid reasons for blocking an ex on social media, especially if they are trying to go no contact. 

Ive blocked every ex I had right after our breakups because seeing anything related to him would trigger a downward spiral. I’m always able to unblock and even reconnect down the road once I’m healed from the breakup, but there shouldn’t be any shame in blocking someone when you need to cut off a toxic connection."
