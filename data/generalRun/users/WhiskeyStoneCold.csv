You're probably safe if you want to put a few thousand away but I'd strongly recommend you do this through a Roth IRA or other tax advantaged retirement account if that fits your interests.

It sounds like your father was describing a thing called a ""mutual fund"". That’s a very common thing to buy into. You can buy them and place them into pretty much any type of retirement account.

I would recommend doing a quick Google search for ""fiduciary financial advisors near me"" or checking out Dave Ramsey's Smart-Vester Pros near you. They are chosen by their willingness to educate their clients. I can say that I'm very happy with my guy and the performance of my Roth IRA that he manages.

1. What is your age and what country are you investing from? This impacts our advice because laws and options change from country to country.
2. Do you have an emergency fund started? We're looking at 3 to 6 months of expenses. Do this first because, as you mentioned, your funds will become illiquid. 
3. Is your father a fiduciary or planning to work with an investing professional who is fiduciary? Being a ""fiduciary"" basically means that they cannot legally make any financial moves on your behalf unless it's believed to be inn your direct interest.
4. If not, what brokerage company does your father plan on working through? There are some programs that I wouldn't want to touch whole some are very respectable. This also impacts what funds you can even begin to invest in."

You're paying more, by percentage, the more you have in your account with Acorns. In terms of of the management fees it may be much more frugal over time to use free services like M1 Finance (the one that I use for my taxable account for what it's worth) or Robinhood and purchase broad market index funds (S&P 500 types or differently sized cap ETFs from Vanguard or Schwab. In terms of gains, it pays to go through a fiduciary to invest as well, which is what I do for my Roth IRA.  

In terms of the ""upcharge everyday purchases"" model that Acorns uses, I'm not a fan of that either. I can see there pocket change getting invested as a pretense or passive permission to spend frivolously, which defeats the purpose of living frugally.

I'm so sorry if this deflates your enjoyment of investing in this platform.

Considering that we can ferment with the urine of diabetics and there are teas and coffees that rely on the raw materials being digested by animals first so this is, theoretically possible, however I have doubts that the brewing would producer a high ABV unless they can control the air flow or really pack in the fish/droppings into the batch.
