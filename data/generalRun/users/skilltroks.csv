 • I notice that a certain frequency of beeping alerts (microwave, seat belt indicator, etc) sounds slightly ""pulsed"" (like when two sounds are very slightly off frequency) is this something I can tune away, or just deal with it? Ask your fitter about that. They can possibly adjust the program(a)

 • Are there generic apps that people use with their HA's? I have one that came with, but it's pretty useless. 

 • Are there accessories that are must have? (I have a UVC drybox, soft and hard case, cleaning tools) electric dehumidifier.  Nothing fancy is needed. Mine was less than $25. I use special disinfectant wipes (made for hearing aods) to sanitize and clean mine.

 • Any other advice for a newb? Everything can be adjusted. Too loud? Tell fitter. Too quiet? Tell fitter. You most likely have a billion appointments to fine tune everything. YOU need to tell the fitter if something doesn't feel/hear right. Hearing loss in so individualistic, what works for one person, is definately not going to work for the next.

DM me if you have questions.  I've been wewring hearing aids for 16 years."

I remember my first hearing aids. It's freaking nuts how far technology has come! There's now hearing aids that monitor brain health and automatically calls a friend/family/911 if you have tripped and/or fallen. Bluetooth hearing aids won't an option 15 years ago, neither was phone apps! It's wild."
explainlikeimfive,fcww2yx,t3_ej0hd1,1578040056.0,"I have wore hearing aids for the last 15-16 years (since I was 16, 31 now). A lot of people have explained this a lot better than I have, but wanted to chime in anyway. 
Like others have said, hearing aids just don't make sounds louder. Little microphones are constantly going on and off and making the sound...sound right. Example, high pitched sounds are really hard for me to hear. My current pair of hearing aids have a program that take those high pitched sounds and bring them to an octave I can hear. An audiologist tests my hearing, and programs the hearing aids to my level of high pitched loss. Same goes for lower, bass sounds. 
Probably not the place of this, but I really need to get it off my chest: I firmly believe those who buy an OTC hearing aid are going to have a bad time. ""Professional"" hearing aids cost a lot (don't get me started on that), but they are custom programmed and fitted for me, and not my mom."
