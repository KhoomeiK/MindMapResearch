todayilearned,fdyh0xh,t1_fdyfpke,1578779674.0,Other people have pointed out it was his bodyguard who was the shooter. But yea being associated with murder is bad. I find the discussion around this incredibly interesting though!
todayilearned,fdygn3x,t1_fdyfsvx,1578779580.0,But that's exactly what I was hesitating about. I definitely don't disagree with you but I do wonder how much good someone has to do before the bad stuff they've done can be forgiven? I'm not saying I forgive his actions but he has done a lot of good in the recent past. What are your thoughts on this?
todayilearned,fdyein5,t1_fdy8c7k,1578778899.0,thanks!
todayilearned,fdyegfz,t1_fdyatzb,1578778877.0,"That's why I hesitated. And thank you for mentioning these incidents. I wonder how much good someone has to do to counteract the bad? Also, how do people like Ice Cube factor into this discussion?"
todayilearned,fdyd71v,t1_fdyb9bp,1578778496.0,"No OP but I'd have to say success to me is feeling content with life. I don't expect to be happy or kind all the time but feeling content with what you contribute to the world feels like a successful life to me. Smoking weed regularly can absolutely be a part of that but it does complicate the process of getting there. That being said, I would consider myself ""successful"" for my age and I have been regularly smoking weed since I was 19."
todayilearned,fdy7387,t1_fdy4r52,1578776783.0,It's strange to think of him as a role model but he kinda is....
funny,fdxin69,t1_fdxgs7u,1578769063.0,thank you!
HistoryPorn,fdxi4a7,t1_fdxejdl,1578768890.0,Creed is easily one of the best written characters ever.
history,fdxbodd,t1_fdx9kcw,1578767240.0,yummmm?
nursing,fdxb7ad,t1_fdx86q4,1578767101.0,"I may have just gotten lucky, as well. I try to say it with a smile and a bit of a timid tone? At the end of the day, it's ok if my clients aren't happy with me all the time but having basic manners is important. It may be relevant that I'm in Canada so things like please and thank you are a part of our 'polite' culture. 

When I first moved to Canada, I was surprised to find out that responding to ""thank you"" with ""mmhmm"" is considered incredibly rude. Things are just a bit different here,  I guess."
nursing,fdx7u0v,t3_en9voo,1578766159.0,"I routinely ask my elderly clients to add ""please"" to their requests/demands. It's not a big deal, just a gentle reminder to them and I've never had anyone respond negatively back. Yes, they're having a hard day but that doesn't stop them from adding one word to a sentence."
todayilearned,fdx1z38,t3_en7fi2,1578764494.0,The thermometer used to find the average body temp was faulty and the 98.6 degree thing has been disproven. There's a great podcast on the subject but I can't recall it at the moment.
AskReddit,fds0567,t3_emul4p,1578692295.0,We met on Bumble (32 and 33). I’ve tried dating apps and didn’t take them seriously but it just felt different with him.

worldnews,fdrvly8,t1_fdruats,1578690364.0,"Factually, with Adam Conover has a great episode about the TSA with citations for every claim they make. Basically the TSA is useless and only provides the illusion of safety."

pics,fdrow0i,t1_fdrolrm,1578687574.0,Especially this King. He seems pretty normal.
todayilearned,fdpm06c,t1_fdpe5wi,1578632399.0,"Cool, really good to know. I’m not sure what is done to that particular version of naproxen but it works for my clients taking them long term.

Edit: they can’t take opiates because of addiction issues and other options weren’t explored because the naproxen helps."
vancouver,fdplw0w,t1_fdphjry,1578632298.0,"Not seen, just reported by several clients over the past few years. I didn’t see a pattern until recently but it’s not something I could realistically report."
vancouver,fdpb7lp,t3_emgng8,1578624288.0,Can people start calling the cops on all the West Van moms driving drunk with their kids in the car?? I’ve had way too many young clients tell me they’re scared to have their own mothers drive them around because they start drinking in the morning.
todayilearned,fdp8ji8,t1_fdp7ihs,1578622509.0,Working in nursing has taught me a lot of doctors just want to make people feel better/stop complaining. It’s easier to give someone lots of pills than to encourage them to use distraction/meditation as well as appropriate medication. I totally get it though. Humans aren’t great at waiting for things and I’m absolutely guilty of that as well.
aww,fdp86yf,t1_fdoinng,1578622271.0,He looked incredibly careful picking the baby up too! Doesn’t seem malicious.
todayilearned,fdp5mwa,t1_fdp462n,1578620558.0,"I’ve seen a few specials about these programs and the inmates are always very gentle and respectful with the animals. I absolutely love the idea and highly doubt anyone volunteering for the program would intend to hurt the animals. Prisoners are people, not monsters. I just wanted to validate the other persons’ response because they aren’t totally wrong. 
Great to know so many people are involved in the process though!"
aww,fdp2et2,t1_fdp1v60,1578618382.0,Cool cat fact!
aww,fdp2aap,t1_fdo22iw,1578618296.0,"I feel ya. I’m assuming he moved back in the beginning to encourage the kitten to hop over to him? He’s so gentle with the other kitty, I’m sure he’s just as sweet with the disabled one."
todayilearned,fdoyqid,t1_fdoyb3w,1578615935.0,That’s true... I would hope someone is watching closely and would step in if the animal was in danger.
todayilearned,fdoxz5i,t1_fdotruf,1578615439.0,"You’re totally right. Vicodin should only be used for up to 3 days, in most situations. Then if ibuprofen isn’t covering the majority of the pain after that, there needs to be a reassessment. 
We also need to stop setting the expectation that pain is bad and shouldn’t be felt at all."
todayilearned,fdoxfnq,t1_fdoi6kk,1578615086.0,What a fun assessment tool!
worldnews,fdlz79o,t1_fdlw8lv,1578536009.0,Much love to you and your family.
