sportsbook,ffgt22u,t3_etjcsx,1579914335.0,"It's the difference between a ""site credit"" and a ""cash credit"" on a lot of sites. Site credit isn't tangible cash, it needs to be played a certain # of times over before it's redeemable, commonly called a rollover amount. The book is anticipating most people to lose their site credit before they ever have the opportunity to cash it out. A cash credit is more often given on a case-by-case basis (ie: a good-will credit) and is less commonly given out in promos, but a cash credit is money given directly to your balance. Most books offer a separate account balance page that lets you view your ""actual balance"" and your ""site credit balance."" On most other pages they'll add your site balance into your actual balance, which sorta misleads and conflates your true bankroll.

Also, some books will offer a ""free bet"" which is usually a bet at a set amount that you can place on a line of your choice (usually some price restrictions apply.) The winnings of that bet turn directly into tangible cash balance, but you do not receive the initial stake back. (ie: $10 freebet @ +100 would return $10, not $20.)

Always good to pore through the terms. Personally I opt out of any site credit. It only serves to obfuscate your true balance and play outside of your means in order to turn it into tangible cash. Books wouldn't offer it so freely if it was profitable for the patron. I'm all about free bets and cash credit where they're offered though."

sportsbook,ffgie9o,t3_et31y3,1579906935.0,"1:40 is the average length of the anthem. I think last year it came between 1:42-1:47.

It's actually interesting because if you (realistically) time yourself singing the national anthem you'll probably get somewhere in the 1:40-1:50 range. It helps to know who's singing it because you can try to predict whether they're going to put a lot of embellishment on it (which adds to the time). Embellishment appears more prevalent with female singers than male singers, as male singers will usually flourish by starting low and ending high, without much improvisation in between. Female singers tend to add more vibrato and will hold higher notes for longer, as well as add improvisational bits to further demonstrate their range.

Take that for what you will, my book hasn't posted lines yet on anthem length but I'll probably sprinkle it, along with Gatorade color and some other fun props. The max is usually pretty low anyway.

ETA: Here's Demi Lovato's past performances singing national anthem:

* [2008](https://youtu.be/PHRwF2x44us): 1 minute, 53 seconds
* [2011](https://youtu.be/HC-J4Y-49Po): 1 minute, 49 seconds
* [2015](https://youtu.be/W5tRiz6gA_U): 1 minute, 58 seconds
* [2017](https://youtu.be/dkTyqIyJ8Zs): 2 minutes, 11 seconds

The line of 124.5 seconds actually seems pretty sharp here, but it seems to be largely based on her most recent 2017 performance. That said, I think this is the largest event she's sung the anthem for. Solely speculating on the grandeur of the event it wouldn't surprise me if she took more pauses and had more flourishes than she normally does."

sportsbook,ffaej4n,t3_esh2bh,1579733788.0,"I'm not sure why anyone would trust any of these ""pay-for-picks"" touts on Twitter or Instagram or wherever. They always obfuscate their ROI and there's always the ability for them to delete bad picks and then block/delete the comments of anyone who noticed.

And if you're going to pay for any service.. Why not use the ones that the sportsbooks *actually* use? DonBest and other ""Odds Provider"" companies *do* offer packages for their lines, and if you know the odds provider of a given book you could theoretically find a competitor odds provider and look for an edge, or utilize the information against a book if their traders deviate from the predictions the odds provider has given. There are a shitload of other avenues for getting an inside edge before you boil your way down to ""the guy on Twitter who says he has a 65% ROI.""

Maybe it's because buying someone's picks requires zero effort, you just get their ""picks"" in your e-mail or whatever and then you go and place your bets blindly, without doing any research or looking into the validity of the pick, but then what's the point? Sportsbetting is supposed to be fun. The majority of people who bet regularly won't end net+. Why kid yourself with these touts and pay more on top of your losses?

Adding to that, even if someone has a model that's net profitable most people don't follow their pick providers 100% of the time, and if you're not directly replicating the moves of your pick provider you're theoretically not going to end up with the same ROI (for better or for worse.)

These are generally called ""sure bets"" and there are some tools that'll help you find them, but obviously you'll need access to the books that are offering the odds you need.

Definitely wasn't trying to trivialize it, I said multiple times I appreciate acts of kindness like this, it's still uplifting. I just had to draw the distinction between ""wipes out her debt"" and what is effectively ""paid for her last classes.""

The story can still be happy and uplifting without being some miraculous ordeal. My criticism is more to do with the writer than the event itself."
UpliftingNews,fcx1i3a,t1_fcwzywa,1578047038.0,"I looked at claiming my associates degree because I took a few years off before my final year of college (during which time I sorta figured out my career goals and worked.)

I didn't get it, but I looked into it a little bit. I could see it being a good plan midway through college theoretically, if you wanted to work while still in school and needed something to show that you'd at least completed some schooling, with the caveat that you would be finishing in x years.

And yeah, it's a bit immoral, but I guess theoretically you could lie. As long as you're not absurdly young for having completed college you could probably just say you got your BA without actually having it. Most employers understand that college degrees don't necessarily make a good employee, and many jobs are more ""training-based"" than ""past-education"" based anyway. Plenty of incompetent people with formidable degrees, plenty of smart people with no degrees in their specific field, etc.."

My one objection is with the way the headline frames it. ""Wiped out her debt"" makes it sound like he paid off all her student and credit card loans. I'd prefer it if it were:

>An Uber Driver got a college degree after one of her passengers **paid for her final classes.**

A $700 balance for the remainder of your classes does not qualify as ""her debt."" I'm sure she has a credit card and probably student loans and all sorts of other shit. The man didn't pay off her student loans, he just covered the remainder of *one* college course.. And the end result isn't even a ""full"" degree, it's:

> That allowed her to register for classes, ultimately earning an **associate degree** in criminal justice.

Not trying to belittle what she did, or the generosity of the man that gave her the money, but this is obviously a clickbait title. An associates degree, after all, is only 60-65 credits.. At most an associates degree should take 2.5 years."

Front door caused a panic, cat freaked out while I was holding it and engaged full-claw scramble mode, while still in my arm. In a matter of about a second I went from totally fine to profusely bleeding out of my hand and arm. Had to wear a gnarly bandage for a while less to stop the bleeding and more because it just looked too gruesome.

So I guess the lesson here is to not hold a cat when there's a risk of panic, because they'll try and scramble away with claws fully extended and it'll fuck you right up."
Showerthoughts,fcjb9pw,t1_fchrn1m,1577681979.0,"I actually looked it up a bit just out of curiosity, there's a bunch of really nice information on [OurWorldInData](https://ourworldindata.org/life-expectancy). It doesn't project much, but judging from how life expectancy has gone up sort of dramatically and then kind of leveled off, I would expect to see a plateau. It seems like there is sort of an ""upper limit"" to life expectancy, though a sociologist might be able to project it better. Like, I'd expect the ""highest"" average life expectancy to sort of level out at 90-100 years old in richer countries and stay maybe the same/moderately increase in poorer countries.

Not saying you're wrong by any means, I'm sure at least one child born in 1989 will live to 2100 (assuming no nuclear holocaust), but I think we're sort of at the tail end of ""maximum life expectancy.""
