loseit,fe67632,t3_ennq98,1578883313.0,"I'm also on my weight loss journey, i was 300 pounds on the dot a couple months ago, i've lost 29 pounds so far, so i'm still an obese fuck, but here's what happened just from losing 30 pounds:

Walking got SIGNIFICANTLY easier.

Breathing got easier.

Sleep quality is better.

I don't get tired as easily.

The way i'm losing the weight is just by not eating like a fat fuck, i cut out bread, soda completely from my life, i strictly drink water, coffee, green tea and sometimes tizanes, and 90% of the time i only eat breakfast and dinner and snack on a fruit or two a day.

I don't exercise anymore because i'm moving to a new house but i will sign up to the nearest gym as soon as i've moved, in the meantime i walk from 5 km to 8 km a day, it's not much but it keeps me active.

So fucking DO IT, can you imagine how we'll feel after losing 100 pounds+ if losing 30 is this fucking good ? let's get this shit done."
