minimalism,ff8ht1g,t3_erz9ms,1579679113.0,"I don't know if you're still reading the replies, but if you are, I'd like to add my two cents:

**1)** It's okay to feel this way. Life is and always will be a process. 

**2)** These items you regret giving away (and it's okay to feel regret) probably feel more precious for you not having them. It's kind of like stories about ""the one that got away"" -- the items and people we feel we've lost let us create a ""perfect"" world in our minds in which having that item or person would've created a happier, more fulfilling life. (And in our thoughts, we do not experience the scratchy itch of what we imagine to have been the perfect sweater.)

If you don't see the item get old and crack and die a natural death, it will always be perfect in your mind. Same with people. The things we miss are stuck in time. Imagine each of those items fading, cracking, losing a corner. You might've even grown bored of them.

Do you feel this attached to the sentimental items that you do own? Do you even remember the sentimental items that died a natural death?

**3)** Of course, nothing brings these things back. They were sentimental. But if they truly meant so much to you, you could attach your feelings to the general idea of those items (""I like bookmarks that have my name in hieroglyphs because I have a fond memory of my parents getting me this"") rather than attaching yourself to that specific item. 

So, maybe, in the future, you could try to attach yourself to your preferences when you find something you love (""I like teal carpets. When this one fades/cracks/burns/floods/gets unusable, it would be fun to find another teal carpet."")

rather than...

(""This teal carpet was my grandmothers and it is irreplaceable and I will never forgive myself if I grow tired of it and want to donate it."")

This third one has helped me a lot. I painted our lamp to be a certain mixture of warm shades, and I have been worried about breaking it (it was already old before we got it). But then I decided, I'm going to use it until it breaks or cannot be repaired, and then I can find another lamp of a similar shade that will be equally precious. It's the shade and style that I've grown to love, and my specific lamp is just a representation of it.

**TL;DR:** It's okay to regret giving away sentimental items. Let yourself feel it. Then, after you've given yourself time to grieve these items, think about how the things you miss are stuck in time. Of course they're precious -- they never faded, cracked, or got old. After that, in the future, try attaching yourself to your general preference rather than a specific item so that you don't get stuck grieving sentimental items for so long that it hinders moving on. (Which is also okay.)

It's a process."

Your description is spot on. You'd have to have enough self-awareness to understand in which areas you're perfectly fine with being the slightly out-of-style outlier and in which you want to/need to/would like to follow a style. 

For example, I keep seeing people follow the rules of some mantra of a (""timeless"") capsule wardrobe for a year and then ditching it because they got bored. You're allowed only 22/33/37/40/etc pieces of clothes and you like expressing yourself through clothes, what did you think would happen? Now, for those who do not care about clothes, a capsule wardrobe is a brilliant solution because getting dressed adds mental (decision fatigue) clutter into their lives. It's okay to have a capsule wardrobe. It's also okay not to have it.

minimalism,fdag0z7,t1_fd9q3p9,1578245606.0,"And even if they do, the problem is that your taste changes and what's ""in style"" changes. ""Timeless"" stuff is only ""timeless"" if you could time travel back to 1920 or 1820 and the product/experience is the same. 

It's currently crazy popular to call everything ""timeless"". Neutral colours are currently considered timeless and ""classic"". All the homes are white-walled and covered in shades of beige and grey. People who follow interior design currently have a ""classic"" wall of miscellaneous framed pictures and a round mirror. 

There's nothing wrong with these styles, but to call it ""classic"" or ""timeless"" is trying to appeal to people who curate their homes to a specific style. (The one currently in fashion.) Which is fine. I like it, too. But time has shown that none of this is timeless."

**Summary:** Multiple studies have shown the tendency of affluent people to have diminished empathy, especially in situations with extreme wealth inequality. The author suggests that while psychopath(ic traits) may be perfectly suited for some of the most profitable occupations, ""the experience of being rich"" teaches the wealthy subjects to be, for example, less alarmed by photographs of sick children. Being rich provides insulation from the world's inconveniences, such as having close neighbours in an apartment building or staying in a hostel. Noisy, risky, inconvenience- and stranger-filled situations will become a rarity for someone who can afford not to have those situations in their lives. 

Moreover, affluent people are more frequently approached with pitches, pleading, offers and requests -- which might, over time, also teach them that interacting with the ""regular"" folk will result in inconvenience and every-day emotional distance might be easier. 

Exceptions to the rule, although rare, do exist. And fortunately, other studies have shown that there is an antidote to this behaviour: when wealthy people are reminded of the advantages of community and cooperation, they were just as egalitarian as poor people. Our ancestors probably benefited from social altruism, but ""decades of ""greed is good"" messaging has sought to remove a sense of shame from being a beneficiary of outrageous extremes of wealth inequality.""

And finally, ""Selfishness may be essential to civilization, but that only raises the question of whether a civilization so out of step with our evolved nature makes sense for the human beings within it."""
Foodforthought,fcnsr3i,t1_fcnsm8r,1577817710.0,"""Of course, there are exceptions to these tendencies. Plenty of wealthy  people have the wisdom to navigate the difficult currents their good  fortune generates without succumbing to RAS—but such people are rare,  and they tend to come from humble origins. Perhaps an understanding of  the debilitating effects of wealth explains why some who have built  large fortunes are vowing not to pass their wealth to their children.  Several billionaires, including Chuck Feeney, Bill Gates, and Warren  Buffett have pledged to give away all or most of their money before they  die. Buffet has famously said that he intends to leave his kids “enough  to do anything, but not enough to do nothing.” The same impulse is  expressed among those lower on the millionaire totem pole. According to  an article on [CNBC.com](http://cnbc.com/),  Craig Wolfe, the owner of CelebriDucks, the largest custom collectible  rubber duck manufacturer, intends to leave the millions he’s made to  charity, which is amazing—but nowhere near as amazing as the fact that  someone made millions of dollars selling *collectible rubber ducks*.

Do  you know someone who suffers from RAS? There may be help for them. UC  Berkeley researcher Robb Willer and his team conducted studies in which  participants were given cash and instructed to play games of various  complexity that would benefit “the public good.”

Participants who  showed the greatest generosity benefited from more respect and  cooperation from their peers and had more social influence. “The  findings suggest that anyone who acts only in his or her narrow  self-interest will be shunned, disrespected, even hated,” Willer said.  “But those who behave generously with others are held in high esteem by  their peers and thus rise in status.” Keltner and Piff have seen the  same thing: “We’ve been finding in our own laboratory research that  small psychological interventions, small changes to people’s values,  small nudges in certain directions, can restore levels of egalitarianism  and empathy,” said Piff. “For instance, reminding people of the  benefits of cooperation, or the advantages of community, cause wealthier  individuals to be just as egalitarian as poor people.” In one study,  they showed subjects a short video—just 46 seconds long—about childhood  poverty. They then checked the subjects’ willingness to help a stranger  presented to them in the lab who appeared to be in distress. An hour  after watching the video, rich people were as willing to lend a hand as  were poor subjects. Piff believes these results suggest that “these  differences are not innate or categorical, but are malleable to slight  changes in people’s values, and little nudges of compassion and bumps of  empathy.”

Piff’s  findings align with the lessons passed along by thousands of  generations of our foraging ancestors, whose survival depended on  developing social webs of mutual aid. Selfishness, they understood,  leads only to death: first social and ultimately biological. While the  neo-Hobbesians struggle to explain how human altruism can exist, other  scientists question their premise, asking if there’s any functional  utility to selfishness. “Given how much is to be gained through  generosity,” says Robb Willer, “social scientists increasingly wonder  less why people are ever generous and more why they are ever selfish.”

Decades  of “greed is good” messaging has sought to remove a sense of shame from  being a beneficiary of outrageous extremes of wealth inequality. Still,  the shame lingers, because the messaging runs up against one of our  species’ deepest innate values. Institutions seeking to justify a  fundamentally anti-human economic system constantly rebroadcast the  message that winning the money game will bring satisfaction and  happiness. But we’ve got around 300,000 years of ancestral experience  telling us it just isn’t so. Selfishness may be essential to  civilization, but that only raises the question of whether a  civilization so out of step with our evolved nature makes sense for the  human beings within it."""
Foodforthought,fcnsm8r,t1_fcnsfno,1577817636.0,"""Psychologists Dacher Keltner and Paul Piff monitored intersections with four-way stop signs and  found that people in expensive cars were four times more likely to cut  in front of other drivers, compared to folks in more modest vehicles.  When the researchers posed as pedestrians waiting to cross a street, all  the drivers in cheap cars respected their right of way, while those in  expensive cars drove right on by 46.2 percent of the time, even when  they’d made eye contact with the pedestrians waiting to cross. Other  studies by the same team showed that wealthier subjects were more likely  to cheat at an array of tasks and games. For example, Keltner reported  that wealthier subjects were far more likely to claim they’d won a  computer game—even though the game was rigged so that winning was  impossible. Wealthy subjects were more likely to lie in negotiations and  excuse unethical behavior at work, like lying to clients in order to  make more money. When Keltner and Piff left a jar of candy in the  entrance to their lab with a sign saying whatever was left over would be  given to kids at a nearby school, they found that wealthier people  stole more candy from the babies.

Researchers  at the New York State Psychiatric Institute surveyed 43,000 people and  found that the rich were far more likely to walk out of a store with  merchandise they hadn’t paid for than were poorer people. Findings like  this (and the behavior of drivers at intersections) could reflect the  fact that wealthy people worry less about potential legal repercussions.  If you know you can afford bail and a good lawyer, running a red light  now and then or swiping a Snickers bar may seem less risky. But the  selfishness goes deeper than such considerations. A coalition of  nonprofit organizations called the Independent Sector found that, on  average, people with incomes below $25,000 per year typically gave away a  little over 4 percent of their income, while those earning more than  $150,000 donated only 2.7 percent (despite tax benefits the rich can get  from charitable giving that are unavailable to someone making much less).

There is reason to believe that blindness to the suffering  of others is a psychological adaptation to the discomfort caused by  extreme wealth disparities. Michael W. Kraus and colleagues found that  people of higher socio-economic status were actually less able to read  emotions in other people’s faces. It wasn’t that they cared less what  those faces were communicating; they were simply blind to the cues. And  Keely Muscatell, a neuroscientist at UCLA, found that wealthy people’s  brains showed far less activity than the brains of poor people when they  looked at photos of children with cancer.

Books such as *Snakes in Suits: When Psychopaths Go to Work* and *The Psychopath Test*  argue that many traits characteristic of psychopaths are celebrated in  business: ruthlessness, a convenient absence of social conscience, a  single-minded focus on “success.” But while psychopaths may be ideally  suited to some of the most lucrative professions, I’m arguing something  different here. It’s not just that heartless people are more likely to  become rich. I’m saying that being rich tends to corrode whatever heart  you’ve got left. I’m suggesting, in other words, that it’s likely the  wealthy subjects who participated in Muscatell’s study *learned* to be less unsettled by the photos of sick kids *by the experience of being rich*—much as I learned to ignore starving children in Rajastan so I could comfortably continue my vacation.

In  an essay called “Extreme Wealth is Bad for Everyone—Especially the  Wealthy,” Michael Lewis observed, “It is beginning to seem that the  problem isn’t that the kind of people who wind up on the pleasant side  of inequality suffer from some moral disability that gives them a market  edge. The problem is caused by the inequality itself: It triggers a  chemical reaction in the privileged few. It tilts their brains. It  causes them to be less likely to care about anyone but themselves or to  experience the moral sentiments needed to be a decent citizen.”

Ultimately,  diminished empathy is self-destructive. It leads to social isolation,  which is strongly associated with sharply increased health risks,  including stroke, heart disease, depression, and dementia.

In one of my favorite studies, Keltner and Piff decided to tweak a game of  Monopoly. The psychologists rigged the game so that one player had huge  advantages over the other from the start. They ran the study with over a  hundred pairs of subjects, all of whom were brought into the lab where a  coin was flipped to determine who’d be “rich” and “poor” in the game.  The randomly chosen “rich” player started out with twice as much money,  collected twice as much every time they went around the board, and got  to roll two dice instead of one. None of these advantages was hidden  from the players. Both were well aware of how unfair the situation was.  But still, the “winning” players showed the tell-tale symptoms of Rich  Asshole Syndrome. They were far more likely to display dominant  behaviors like smacking the board with their piece, loudly celebrating  their superior skill, even eating more pretzels from a bowl positioned  nearby.

After  15 minutes, the experimenters asked the subjects to discuss their  experience of playing the game. When the rich players talked about why  they’d won, they focused on their brilliant strategies rather than the  fact that the whole game was rigged to make it nearly impossible for  them to lose. “What we’ve been finding across dozens of studies and  thousands of participants across this country,” said Piff, “is that as a  person’s levels of wealth increase, their feelings of compassion and  empathy go down, and their feelings of entitlement, of deservingness,  and their ideology of self-interest increases.”"
Foodforthought,fcnsfno,t1_fcns83m,1577817537.0,"""I was in India the first time it occurred to me that I, too, was a rich asshole. I’d  been traveling for a couple of months, ignoring the beggars as best I  could. Having lived in New York, I was accustomed to averting my  attention from desperate adults and psychotics, but I was having trouble  getting used to the groups of children who would gather right next to  my table at street-level restaurants, staring hungrily at the food on my  plate. Eventually, a waiter would come and shoo them away, but they’d  just run out to the street and watch from there—waiting for me to leave  the waiter’s protection, hoping I’d bring some scraps with me.

In  New York, I’d developed psychological defenses against the desperation I  saw in the streets. I told myself that there were social services for  homeless people, that they would just use my money to buy drugs or  booze, that they’d probably brought their situation on themselves. But  none of that worked with these Indian kids. There were no shelters  waiting to receive them. I saw them sleeping in the streets at night,  huddled together for warmth, like puppies. They weren’t going to spend  my money unwisely. They weren’t even asking for money. They were just  staring at my food like the starving creatures they were. And their  emaciated bodies were brutally clear proof that they weren’t faking  their hunger.

A  few times, I bought a dozen samosas and handed them out, but the food  was gone in an instant, and I was left with an even bigger crowd of kids  (and, often, adults) surrounding me with their hands out, touching me,  seeking my eyes, pleading. I knew the numbers. With what I’d spent on my  one-way ticket from New York to New Delhi, I could have pulled a few  families out of the debt that would hold them down for generations. With  what I’d spent in New York restaurants the year before, I could have  put a few of those kids through school. Hell, with what I’d budgeted for  a year of traveling in Asia, I probably could have *built* a school.

I  wish I could tell you I did some of that, but I didn’t. Instead, I  developed the psychological scar tissue necessary to ignore the  situation. I learned to stop thinking about things I could have done,  but knew I wouldn’t. I stopped making facial expressions that suggested I  had any capacity for compassion. I learned to step over bodies in the  street—dead or sleeping—without looking down. I learned to do these  things because I had to—or so I told myself. Textbook RAS.

Research  conducted at the University of Toronto by Stéphane Côté and colleagues  confirms that the rich are less generous than the poor, but their  findings suggest it’s more complicated than simply wealth making people  stingy. Rather, it’s *the distance created by wealth differentials*  that seems to break the natural flow of human kindness. Côté found that  “higher-income individuals are only less generous if they reside in a  highly unequal area or when inequality is experimentally portrayed as  relatively high.” Rich people were as generous as anyone else when  inequality was low. The rich are less generous when inequality is  extreme, a finding that challenges the idea that higher-income  individuals are just more selfish. If the person who needs help doesn’t  seem *that* different from us, we’ll probably help them out. But  if they seem too far away (culturally, economically) we’re less likely  to lend a hand.

The social distance separating rich and poor, like  so many of the other distances that separate us from each other, only  entered human experience after the advent of agriculture and the  hierarchical civilizations that followed, which is why it’s so  psychologically difficult to twist your soul into a shape that allows  you to ignore starving children standing close enough to smell your  plate of curry. You’ve got to silence the inner voice calling for  justice and for fairness. But we silence this ancient, insistent voice  at great cost to our own psychological well-being.

A wealthy friend of mine recently told me, “You get successful by saying  yes, but you need to say no a lot to stay successful.” If you’re  perceived to be wealthier than those around you, you’ll have to say “no”  a lot. You’ll be constantly approached with requests, offers, pitches,  and pleas—whether you’re in a Starbucks in Silicon Valley or the back streets of Calcutta. Refusing sincere requests for help doesn’t come  naturally to our species. Neuroscientists Jorge Moll, Jordan Grafman,  and Frank Krueger of the National Institute of Neurological Disorders  and Stroke have used fMRI machines to demonstrate that altruism is  deeply embedded in human nature. Their work suggests that the deep  satisfaction most people derive from altruistic behavior is not due to a benevolent cultural overlay, but from the evolved architecture of the human brain.

When volunteers in their studies placed the interests of others before  their own, a primitive part of the brain normally associated with food  or sex was activated. When researchers measured vagal tone (an indicator  of feeling safe and calm) in 74 preschoolers, they found that children  who’d donated tokens to help sick kids had much better readings than  those who’d kept all their tokens for themselves. Jonas Miller, the lead  investigator, said that the findings suggested “we might be wired from a  young age to derive a sense of safety from providing care for others.”  But Miller and his colleagues also found that whatever innate  predisposition our species has toward charity is influenced by social  cues. Children from wealthier families shared fewer tokens than the  children from less well-off families."""

One of them, Hal Steger, lived with his wife in a million-dollar house overlooking the Pacific Ocean. Their net worth was about $3.5 million. Assuming a reasonable return of 5 percent, Steger and his wife were positioned to cash out, invest their capital, and glide through the rest of their lives on a passive income of around $175,000 per year after glorious year. Instead, Rivlin wrote, “Most mornings, \[Steger\] can be found at his desk by 7. He typically works 12 hours a day and logs an extra 10 hours over the weekend.” Steger, 51 at the time, was aware of the irony (sort of): “I know people looking in from the outside will ask why someone like me keeps working so hard,” he told Rivlin. “But a few million doesn’t go as far as it used to.”

With a net worth of around $10 million as the founder of [Match.com](https://Match.com), Kremen understood the trap he was in: “Everyone around here looks at the people above them,” he said. “You’re nobody here at $10 million.” If you’re nobody with $10 million, what’s it cost to be somebody?

Foodforthought,fbbjjig,t3_eciaex,1576701776.0,"To those who get can't get behind the paywall:

""IN MARCH A Boeing 737 MAX  aircraft crashed in Ethiopia, just six months after a similar accident  in Indonesia. Nearly 350 people were killed in the two disasters, which  revealed a flaw in the MAX’s flight-control system and  put into question a vast industrial enterprise. Airlines are relying on  the delivery of thousands of MAX planes over the next decade or so. Boeing was expected to make up a large share of its future profits from the MAX. The firm is one of America’s biggest exporters and at least a million people work for it or for its suppliers.

Since March Boeing’s response has been an ugly mixture of remorse, evasion and swagger, as it has gambled that it can get the MAX,  and its business, rapidly back in the air. On December 16th that  strategy ran out of runway when the firm announced it would suspend  production of the stricken plane.

Boeing’s  defiance began with its decision to stick with its chief executive,  Dennis Muilenburg (although he was replaced as chairman in October).  There has been no public, comprehensive, independent investigation by  the firm into what went wrong. In its place there have been leaks galore  and reports about software problems and corners being cut.

Even though the MAX  is not allowed to fly, Boeing’s factories have continued to churn out  new planes that sit on the tarmac while customers are unwilling or  unable to take delivery of them or make full payment. The firm signalled  to Wall Street that business would return to normal soon enough and it  continues to pay a dividend, despite burning up $3bn of cash last  quarter. Boeing had indicated to investors, suppliers and customers that  the MAX would be flying by the end of 2019, even though this is a decision it should not be able to determine.

Boeing no doubt wants to protect its  workers and defend itself from a barrage of lawsuits. But the industry’s  lack of competition lets it get away with poor behaviour. In the short  run the other half of the passenger-jet duopoly, Airbus, cannot increase  output so as to offer customers an alternative source of aircraft.  There is a queasy sense that Boeing has played a game of chicken with  regulators. In stoking expectations that the MAX will be  airborne again soon and keeping production humming, it has presented  regulators with an unenviable choice: either to let the MAX back in the air whether or not it is ready, or to damage the industry and the American economy.

Boeing’s strategy has backfired. America’s Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), the tarnished regulator which at first declined to ground the MAX,  has found its backbone under new management and said that it is not yet  ready to rule that the flight-control problem has been fixed. In the  past foreign regulators have followed the FAA’s lead, but  a majority of Boeing’s sales are now made outside America and  authorities abroad no longer want to play wingman to the FAA. Both China and the EU have indicated that they are not yet happy. The number of idle, new MAXes  piling up has grown to 400. Boeing’s strategy has strained its  balance-sheet, with its inventories reaching $73bn and gross debts  $25bn.

It is time for a different  approach. Mr Muilenburg should be removed and the firm’s board of  directors beefed up. If Boeing does not do this voluntarily, its owners  and regulators should insist. Production of the MAX  should resume only when the firm has received approval from regulators  around the world. Boeing needs to shore up its balance-sheet, so that it  has the resources to invest and to help tide over crucial  suppliers—which means eliminating its dividend. And lastly it needs to  come up with a medium-term plan for life after the MAX,  in the form of a next-generation aircraft, perhaps one that relies on  hybrid-electric propulsion. Over the past decade Boeing has skimped on  research, development and capital spending, investing only 7% of its  sales on average, compared with around 10% at Airbus. Once the 737 MAX was the future. It is time for a new pilot and a new course."""
