todayilearned,ff730qp,t1_ff5hk8r,1579640108.0,"That's not a great argument. The environment isn't even a concern outside of how difficult it is to walk to school. What you may be saving by having kids walk to school is just a drop in the ocean anyways. You already have kids up as early as 6am, you don't want to add on a 15 or 30 minute walk at the start of their day. And while a walk is certainly good for their health it's not great. If you really care about their health it needs to be in conjunction with teaching them how to eat healthy. It should also include more rigorous exercise. It would be better they get their exercise from a gym class, or afterschool sports. You might be able to redirect some traffic away from the roads, but you'd do the same by running buses. Unless your school is already built away from public roads you aren't going to eliminate enough traffic to make it safer. Even then this is only going to work if you haven't already built the school, or are willing to tear down and move. I can at least say the school districts in my area are going to have tons of traffic whether you have a school there or not. My school did have ""walkers"" from elementary up. But that was only a handful of kids who basically lived next door. The point being is being able to walk to school every day is an exception, and should not be the rule."
todayilearned,ff71zgp,t1_ff5gk9t,1579639523.0,I have to agree with you. I think a lot of people are only able to look at this from their own perspective and not realize that simply walking to school every morning isn't really practical.
todayilearned,ff71cki,t1_ff56hx7,1579639169.0,"This is the real problem isn't it? My highschool had sports, as I think most do, but even then you only ever heard about the football team and the band. You had to know a guy to get into anything else. Personally I would've been fine with spending extra hours at school if it was out of the classroom. Schools don't need to be just nose to books every hour."
todayilearned,ff709xx,t1_ff5fuf3,1579638540.0,"My high school wasn't that bad but still started somewhere around 7:45am I think, and ended around 2:45pm. If the sun's not up I don't see why I should be. 

I don't know about other schools but a 40 minute lunch is just not enough. You could bring your own lunch, but without so much as a microwave options are limited. Middle school broke the cafeteria up into 4 sections, and you had to wait for your section to be called before you could get in line for food. If it was your turn to go up last you spent almost the whole lunch sitting there hungry and waiting. There were times where they were corralling kids out of the cafeteria maybe two minutes after the last kid got his food. High school was just a free for all, but at least there were different lines. You could opt for a soggy chicken sandwich and have a shorter wait. But the time you have to actually eat depends on how far away your classroom is, where your locker is, and how fast you can push through a crowd without getting noticed by teachers."
todayilearned,ff63qms,t1_ff5scwt,1579618381.0,"Yes and no. The symptom is generally described as having a lack of interest in activities you used to find enjoyable. It's more like saying I know I love doing this, but I literally cannot feel enjoyment. Boredom is saying this doesn't appeal to me in the first place. With depression what you think and what you feel can be two different things. If I had to guess I wouldn't describe what you're feeling as a type of clinical depression. I think it is part of growing up to not feel or react as strongly as you might use to. But of course that's based on very limited information, everyone is different, etc. I would say if that is the only symptom then don't worry too much. You may just be looking for something new to enjoy. But if it does concern you it's always worth asking your doctor during a checkup for more details just in case."

It seems like every game is released unfinished, and we're expected to wait or pay more hoping that it'll get better eventually. And he's not entirely wrong about it being forever bad. Not every game is going to get the opportunity to redeem themself. If you're a high profile game like Battlefield or Rainbow Six, you're gonna have people following you no matter what. So if you do fix the game people will know. But there are so many other games that burned their bridge on launch, and now it doesn't matter how good the game became. No one is interested. Star Citizen is getting in that zone. Will it even matter if they eventually make the game good? Or is it's failure always overshadow them?"
todayilearned,fek3amp,t1_feir1t0,1579191704.0,"People forget what it meant to have a state religion. If you practiced a different religion, or didn't practice the correct way you faced severe punishment. The founding fathers were religious, but understood that the state shouldn't be the one dictating what you believe. This was actually giving religion more freedom, not restricting it. Now your government official could be from any faith, if any at all. And even if they clashed with your beliefs they weren't allowed to interfere.

I suspect it has to do with the current movement of ""all religion bad"". People are trying their best to outlaw it in any way they can. So they try to convince people that instead of being free to practice any faith, it means you can't practice any. In a sense they want to turn Aethism into the state religion."
todayilearned,fek1u0h,t1_feikaxy,1579190805.0,"The church is not allowed to hold  any sort of office in government. Basically the church doesn't get to make the rules. What you are suggesting is that government officials are not allowed to be religious which goes against the freedom of religion. The government is allowed to be religious. There is literally nothing that says they can't be. The separation only means that they cannot be a representative of a church or a religion as a whole. If for instance a state decides that morning prayer in school is a good thing, then they can do that. Good fucking luck but there isn't anything that says they can't try. If they tried to say we need to introduce morning prayer because the pope or the local church asked us to, then that violates the separation. Again the government is permitted to be religious. It's one of our most fundamental rights. The key being you need to be an elected government official. You don't have any power simply for being the head of a church. If you want that power you need to be elected like anyone else."

todayilearned,feig91p,t1_fei4eag,1579137820.0,"You're trying to understand it backwards. According to christianity God made man after his own image. He wasn't thinking of creating sexes, he was just making man. So naturally since men were the original made after his own image it's reasonable enough to say that what we define as male would fit God as well. Women were then made with a part of man, Adam's rib. So female pronouns are close since they are both creations of God, and Adam himself was made after the image of God, but it would put it as sort of one more step behind males.

Of course it's also just a limitation and quirks of human language. You don't refer to an individual as ""it"". It's also because we was more of a father than a mother. He was the protector, and provider. Though he was caring and loving the male traits were more pronounced. Really God isn't either sex since, like you pointed out, he's so far above it. For our own use in language though it makes the most sense. And don't forget it's just one of thousands of interpretations of God."

Not that league is like that, but just to show that people do enjoy repetition. And the game doesn't stay the same. Honestly I stopped playing long ago because they keep changing it so much that it's nearly a completely different game. It's both a strength and a huge weakness. On one hand there are people who want change for the sake of change. They don't care if it's balanced, fair, or fun so long as things keep changing variety is enough.

I've heard every bit of advice like I should listen to happier music. To an extent I don't blame them for not knowing. If you are a normal person who is sad it may be true. But someone who is depressed, or worse suicidal, that goes far beyond being in a bad mental state. It's physical too. You can't tell someone they just to need smile, think happy, go for a walk, or get out of bed. It's not so much they don't want to but they literally can't. That's why it's so important that people stop giving advice on what they should do and be the ones to do it. For instance instead of saying talk a walk, say come take a walk with me. You want them out of bed you need to give them a reason. Call them and ask them to come for breakfast.

Honestly it's hard to hear but people don't know jack shit about helping someone who is suicidal. This is a person who is so thoroughly convinced there is nothing left. You can't just tell them they're worth it and expect that to convince them. You need to understand where they are coming from. This may be years or a lifetime of experiences that make it seem like there is no love and no hope. Do not tell them it gets better. Don't tell them people care. Don't tell them they're not alone.

If you want to help you need to be able to prove it. It takes action not words. Some of these people may just be physically starved and a hug may be enough to help them step back. But since every person is so different you need to listen and understand what they are feeling. Never ever tell them they are wrong. Don't try to convince them that what they think isn't true.

If the government is investing then whether you are performing or not you can be on the chopping block at any moment. It's not just the hospital they are paying for but every other service and investment. If any of those are failing, or costs go up elsewhere in their budget, then they may decide that you don't need as much as they gave you last year. An investor may only be driven by profit that's true, but at least you can guarantee your funding if you perform well enough. That's good for patients because they are going to find more efficient ways to take care of you. Jacking up prices isn't very profitable since someone can choose to go somewhere cheaper. Sending people away uncared for wont work because good luck getting them to come back. But they will make sure you wait as little as possible since more patients means more profits. It's not perfect but america easily has the highest quality healthcare. And even better the most choice in who you trust to take care of you."

No incentive to take care of you. Plus they get to decide how much money your hospital is allowed to have. Better to pay a little extra than be dead. A whole lot of good money is gonna do you 6ft under.

cscareerquestions,fc45zsq,t1_fc3sdvl,1577407539.0,"I'll keep that in mind, thanks. I decided to go back with one of those free learning sites. Using freecodecamp atm.

When it comes to java programing it was difficult to recall how to really set up a program, and what files and folders are all necessary. There's a lot of fluff that is needed to just get a foundation and it was never explained what it was. Either that or the ide just puts it there automatically.

Putting all the pieces together and understanding the backend of why it's all there is something I'm struggling with. Maybe that's course material for a higher degree, but either way it's a first for me. From what I can gather ""full-stack"" refers to the whole package of an app, including all the other programs or languages used to put it together. Is that correct?

Any suggestions on where to learn about hosting?"

gifs,fc0u1hq,t3_efhp9x,1577299687.0,Gross to see the response from people in this thread. An animal acts out and the first response is to just kill it. Shows how little people understand pets. Cats are assholes and they'll maybe tear shit or knock over your stuff. But animals do NOT attack people unprovoked. It's impossible to know how this cat was raised just from this gif. But that cat saw some reason to fight. The guy was being an absolute spastic. Unless you have an extremely docile pet it's never a good idea to scream and flail around like that. Let's not start killing every pet because they have a bad owner. I need to see some real proof that this cat is simply naturally violent for no reason.

I've never had any professor refer to a repo before so I still don't know what you're referring to. As for school projects, like I've said, I've never built something that can function outside of an ide, is that considered good enough?

And I've already gotten contacted by revature. Didn't seem them out but it has been literally the only option so far. Haven't gone anywhere with it though.

Right now I think my biggest problem is what do I do from here? I don't know what a repo is. Is that something employers look for or is it just something nice to have? I feel lost as to where to spend my time learning. What specifically should I be able to accomplish? There are so many different formats and systems in use I don't want to spend six months studying for something that maybe only a handful of employers will use. What's a good place to start?"
