MedievalCats,ffi5jmd,t3_etmtd3,1579965656.0,He’s a little confused but he’s got the spirit.
happy,ffb5ssl,t1_ffau8h6,1579752558.0,Oh it’s wonderful that you had that. I hope things are going much better for you now. Good job kickin ass

happy,ffal305,t1_ffahx40,1579738444.0,"That’s definitely how it feels for me too, friend lol"
happy,ffab3e2,t1_ffa9dgl,1579731423.0,Absolutely. I’m making sure he knows just how much I appreciate him on a regular basis.
ImaginaryLeviathans,ff9muia,t3_es2omt,1579716306.0,I am absolutely in love with this. It’s so well done and the style is awesome. I suggest that watermark it or something similar. You deserve full credit for it.
PraiseTheCameraMan,ff060jc,t1_fezyamx,1579465580.0,That’s definitely what I would do.
Bondedpairs,ff02636,t1_fezhxyp,1579464431.0,We want to see them all. And more as they grow.

TuxedoCats,felbbpt,t3_epkt4h,1579218176.0,"My tuxie plays fetch and he’s a great guard cat, so yes."
realwitchcraft,fel5e3y,t3_epek9y,1579214426.0,"Weather without a doubt. Then object placement. Then life events. Typically in that order. 

For example, I’m trying to do a career change into something that has a very long process (Like two years). After I did the first test and it went very well, as I was walking back to my car it started snowing.  Huge, fluffy snowflakes, my favorite weather in the world. I thanked the world for the encouragement. 

Next, I bought a motorcycle from some dude off Facebook. His “saddle bag” was an ammo box because he’s in the Air Force, I was in a Navy combat command for a few years so these specific ammo boxes are the same type I used. I figured I’d leave it because it reminded me for the good times I had. Get home and actually look inside of it and there’s object that 100% pertains to the career I’m trying to go into. Again, I thank the world for the reassurance that I’m going in the right direction. 

A few months go by. I got a promotion at my current job. I don’t dislike this job but I’d really enjoy the new career. 

Another few months go by, I haven’t heard anything back from the new career in a while now so I figure “that’s ok, I’ll chill in this career.” Shortly after, at work I get notified that I’m getting laid off. Awesome. That evening I get a call from the new career saying I can move onto the next step. The universe knows what it’s doing by showing us all these signs, we just have to listen.

Weather is definitely my go to though. I don’t believe there’s any real “bad” weather though."

SecurityClearance,fdon601,t1_fdom4gx,1578608558.0,"Thanks for the response! It was the Seabees in the navy, in the Expeditionary Combat Command, if that’s helps. I’m fairly sure that at my current job I’d need just confidential rather than secret. If there isn’t a way to find out definitely then that’s ok. I figured I’d try my luck here."
frens,fdo8056,t1_fdo7w1j,1578600481.0,I did! I didn’t want to have to mark it nsfw because of doggie dick lol

Have fun!"
Vent,fdkf0w8,t1_fdkcupy,1578502483.0,"I don’t want to chat with this dude at all. I’m polite to him when he does talk to me but I make no effort to keep the conversation going. He sits like three feet away from me and his buddy sits on the other side of him. The only time he says anything to me is when it’s super slow and his buddy isn’t there. For example, after seven hours of being in the same vicinity and having said nothing to me, his buddy is gone and there’s not much to do so out of no where in the silence the dude goes “so, how are yours dogs?” I smile and say “they’re great, thanks.” And go back to what I’m doing. Five minutes later when it’s still just him and I in the area he goes “oh man it’s so boring right now.” I reply that it sure is boring. A few minutes later he asks if I had a nice Christmas. Once his buddy gets back dude is talking with him and didn’t say a word to me for the rest of the shift. It’s not my job to help this guy pass time with small talk because his buddy isn’t there."
SweatyPalms,fdk9xn9,t1_fdjnkvm,1578499387.0,"Same. If I ever get on a ride that’s actually intense I just laugh the whole way through. It happens in the real world too. 

I was in a mall before it opened so everything was dark. Creepy already. A man I didn’t know was going the same place I was so he was following me (I’m a 5’3” woman). Extra creepy. He was going to be late so he was coming up quick and then all of a sudden we hear this demonic child laughing out of no where. So I started laughing. (Turns out those tiny rides kids sit in can have motion sensors that never get turned off.)

Then this last Halloween I was out trick or treating with my kid and accidentally turned face first into the chest of a big guy dressed as a super creepy clown. Again I just laughed and walked away. 

I read somewhere that some people laugh as a way to convince our body that everything is fine. “It was just a prank, bro.”  Or to show others that we’re not afraid and therefore should not be attacked."
loseit,fdj9cg4,t3_ell4ec,1578462229.0,I’m 5’3” and 205lbs trying to get back to 155lbs (body fat percentage is about 26% for me) and it feels so impossible. It’s soooo easy to over eat AND under eat because we have such a small window of acceptable calorie ranges. And then those calorie ranges are only for losing like 1lb in a week and half because a smaller calorie limit is under eating. It’s such a pain in my big fat ass.
Anxiety,fdj8fuu,t1_fdj760s,1578461433.0,Good! Enjoy the laughs and cuteness!
Anxiety,fdj6p3s,t1_fdj5z2k,1578459974.0,"Thank you, friend. This sub and you (and others like you) have helped myself and many others by just validating the anxiety without trying to fix it."
Anxiety,fdj6cmu,t1_fdj5ifs,1578459691.0,"Thank you. I hope you’re finding semi healthy ways to cope. It’s very hard to see these men and women walking into such a shit show. Especially because these are OUR people, our friends and family."
DeathByMillennial,fdj0i8m,t1_fdiyzum,1578455338.0,You have time to figure it out and do what you want. Don’t settle and don’t give up.
Anxiety,fdiyl7a,t3_elm4sm,1578454018.0,"Thank you. I wasn’t crying until now. I’m at work (a Boeing company and I’m new-ish so I’ll prob get laid off within a month or so, yay). I’m a veteran and internally panicking for those currently in the military. It does help to know that I’m not crazy, just anxiety ridden. Let the obsessive refreshing continue."
politics,fdipdxq,t1_fdiozdv,1578448056.0,I imagine that some poor White House official had to take his phone away and watch him so he doesn’t make this worse at the moment.

LuLaNo,fd0639k,t3_ejlouu,1578114181.0,This being 400 items on two racks really puts the huge closets/showrooms that some “sellers” have into perspective. Poor #bossbabes. So much debt.

witchcraft,fczkxls,t1_fcwt1zy,1578103490.0,That’s exactly what I’d like to do! I’ve heard of smudging but feel like it takes too much of the positive along with it. Do you have any suggestions?
depression,fcpcymo,t1_fcpcij1,1577858763.0,"I hope you find some relief soon, friend! That sounds like a bitch to deal with, especially with a non ideal therapist."
depression,fcpc060,t1_fcp9hv5,1577857713.0,Thank you. Logically I know that if I feel better then I can get back to enjoying eating well and exercising like I used to. The trail and error of different medications is intimidating. I’ve been in therapy twice and neither went well (I think mainly due to incompatibility.) Hopefully something works.
depression,fcp9rqv,t1_fcp9gk2,1577855418.0,Thank you. It’s reassuring to know that the doctor probably won’t just tell me to lose weight with diet and exercise and that’ll fix my mental issues.
depression,fcp89ly,t1_fcp7m3y,1577853800.0,"Thank you, friend. Logically I know that if I feel even a little better anything would be worth it and I might even actually get back to legitimately eating well and loving exercising resulting in losing this weight. It helps to hear real perspectives like yours."
