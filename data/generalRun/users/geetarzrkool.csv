aikido,fgk3ems,t3_ewvbcn,1580856657.0,"Ol Saotome is a strange bird. If you've ever been around him, there's no doubt that he has some skills, especially as a younger man, but he's also raging alcoholic and kinda full of shit. 

He claims to know all the ""secret ways"", but can't/won't/doesn't show them much, and he certainly has never put his money where his mouth is and gone toe-to-toe with anyone to put his ""secret ways"" to the test. I'm quite sure a competent BJJ bluebelt could have their way with him.

Also, he's old and physically tiny and always has been (<150 lbs.). You could literally pick him up and throw him across the room without much effort at all, and there's really not much that he could do to stop it :/ 

All that being said, I've trained with him many, many times and he does have a sort of ""vibe"" about him that is intriguing, if not intimidating."
Guitar,fgk28zq,t3_eyxbi0,1580855986.0,"A notched straight edge with both Fender and Gibson scale lengths is very useful, as well. As others have said, a Capo is very nice to have. You can use it to clamp down strings at the first fret so you can remove the neck/bridge of a guitar without have to remove the strings. A little bit of metal polish is great for bringing back the shine on metal parts and frets too. 

Avoid steel wool, or any other harsh, metal abrasives. You can use various grades of sandpaper instead."
Guitar,fgk1h2t,t3_eyxy88,1580855545.0,"No worries. Your guitar is fine. As you may have noticed, there are SPRINGS on the back of the guitar which are there to counteract the tension created by the STRINGS. Ideally, the two forces are equal and the bridge stays in place. 

However, when the strings are removed, there is no longer any STRING tension, so the SPRINGS draw the bridge tight to the body. This is referred to as a ""decked"" tremolo. Some folks prefer this set up as it still allows for you to push down on the trem arm to lower the pitch of the strings, while keeping the guitar in tune when/if a string should break mid-song. Otherwise, loosing the string would cause the SPRING tension to take over and pull all of the strings out of tune, which is no fun in the middle of a song. The ""downside"" of this arrangement is that you can't pull up on the trem arm to raise the pitch of the string, but you can still bend them with your fretting hand, if need be. 


Another factor to consider with tremolo guitars is the string gauge/thickness. Thicker stings create more tension, while thinner strings create less. Neither is better, or worse, but you do want to keep the gauge consistent when you change the strings or you can/will have issues with the trem. If the new strings are thicker, there will be more tension than before on the strings, so they will pull the bridge up off the body more than usual. Conversely, if the new strings are thinner there won't be enough tension to raise the bridge off the body at all, so it will remain ""decked"". 

If you want to be able to both push down and pull up on the bar, you'll want to set up a ""floating bridge"". To do this install the strings as normal and tune them to pitch, you can then tighten/loosen the SPRINGS on the back of the guitar to achieve the desired amount of float. Fender recommends about 1/8"" off the body at most. 

Finish install all of the new stings. If the strings are the same size as the original, everything should be just as it was. If they are thicker, the bridge will likely be raised off the body a bit more than normal in which case you'll want to tighten the screws on the tremolo claw on the back of the guitar. Make a few turns, then re-tune and re-check the height of the bridge until it is where you want it.

If the new strings fail to raise the bridge at all from the bod you'll want to loosen the screws on the back. That will decrease the SPRING tension and allow the strings to pull the bridge off the body a bit. 

Don't worry nothing you do involving a sting change will void the warranty and there are zillions of vids online that can walk you through the job, as well."

Speaking of ""Great moral questions"" and ""asking you anything""? 

What about the 10-15 million ethnic Germans that were killed *after* the war? Does that count as a ""Holocaust""?

What about the Holocaust that's being carried out against the Uyghurs in China? (""Never again!""....to us, but do whatever you want to them) ""Let *my* people go!"" (....but keep all the rest as slaves, eh Pharaoh ;)  .

What about the continued displacement of the Palestinians (Canaanites) from their homeland by modern Jews?

Why are/were the ""official numbers"" for the Holocaust so wildly variant and inaccurate until the ubiquitous ""6 million"" figure was arrive upon? I won't get started on the significance of ""6"" in the occultic, Saturnine aspects of Judaism....Lets just say that ""6 million Jews"" have apparently been killed many times over. 

Why do so many folks like to use the wildly inaccurate term of ""genocide""? There were millions of Jews before the war, millions of Jews during the war and millions of Jews today, after the war. At no point was a ""genocide"" even close to occurring. 

Why no ""Remembrance Day"" for the Native American Holocaust and genocides, which undeniably took place? I mean, it takes a lot of chutzpah to complain about a Holocaust and a right to your own Homeland, if you live in the US on soil that belonged to Native Peoples from the beginning of time. How about we restore their homelands first? 

I could go on, but....I think this is a good start. 


As for bombing Auschwitz, it would've been more trouble than it was worth from a logistical stand point and wouldn't have made a significant difference to the war, overall. Don't be so naive as to think that we joined WWII to ""save the Jews"" anymore than the North fought the US Civil War to ""free the slaves"". We're not that nice.

Guitar,ffnknyu,t3_eua43g,1580067264.0,"You'll find these duplicated notes pop up a lot in most guitar chords and they're used to add extra color/texture to a chord and to allow you to use more strings so that you can produce a fuller sound. You'll also find that different shapes for the same chord will produce slightly different combinations/orders of chord tones. Which shape you choose is a matter of taste, preference and physical ease of use. It's more work on the front end to learn multiple shapes for the same types of chord, but you'll have a much more thorough understanding of the fretboard and you'll have many more tonal options at your disposal.

I would buy a pre-loaded Strat pickguard and just drop it into place. You can find them all over eBay, Amazon, etc...for very little money ($25-$50). The biggest expense is the pups, so I would see what sort some of your favorite players use and see if you can get something similar."
Guitar,feyetuu,t3_eqwt5o,1579444525.0,"Passive pickups required no external power source and use natural, electromagnetic induction to produce a signal from a copper coil and magnets while active pickups use a small microprossesor (computer) and an outside power source (usually 1-2 9V batteries) to create the signal, which is generally slightly amplified before going to the amp (i.e. a preamp). 

Active pups are prized by folks who want super clean tones with lots of definition between the notes. This is why lots of bass players use them. They can keep the lower notes on a bass from becoming muddy and allow you to tweak the EQ settings before they go to the amp. Lots of high gain metal players like them for these reasons, as well. They can help retain clarity and note definition at very high gain/distortion settings. The Cons are that you need a battery to power them and some players think they sound ""cold"", ""soulless"", ""too neutral"". 

Old school pickups are just a series of magnets with copper wire wrapped around them. They don't amplify the signal in any way, or require an external power source. Their sound/tone comes from combination of the types of magnets used and the amount of copper wire wrapped around them. Using different combinations can create vastly different sounding pickups. Because they also rely solely on induction, they more accurately reproduce the dynamics of your playing, rather than passing the signal through a preamp first. 

As for you why the passive pups seem crunchier than the EMGs, there are several reasons, but it's mostly due the unique frequency response of the two designs, as well as their overall output. A tube amp will also behave differently to these two signals, as well."

personalfinance,fe374qu,t3_enpdh4,1578846571.0,"The general rule of thumb is to pay off the loans with the highest interest rate first, then the next highest and so on. As you've seen, only paying the minimum amount is a fool's errand and only benefits the lender. If you want to get ahead of the curve, you'll simply have to pay more each month. That may mean that you can't put aside a full 30% into savings for a few years, but thems the breaks, and it's far better to suck it up for a few years to pay down the worst of the loans, rather than dealing with nagging, unnecessary debt for years. 

Thankfully, no single loan is all that large, so you may even be able to 1 or 2 off in a lump sum with a bit of luck. Consolidation is also an option, but be sure to read the fine print as they aren't always a great as they may seem. They're not ""helping"" you for nothing."

If he wins, he was a brute, or a bully and if he ""loses to a girl"", then he's a wuss. Also, if she's a true purple belt going against someone with presumably no formal training, then she better beat him, so again it's not as impressive as it may seem."
aikido,fdn0hbi,t3_em0c4c,1578573437.0,"Sure. Assuming you have a decent teacher (and most on the seminar circuit are), then there are lots of cool tips and tid-bits you could pick up at an event. Just be prepared for things to be rather different than most other forms of MA training. As cliche as it may sound, you're generally training with a partner in a co-operative manner, rather than ""rolling"" for fun, or ""sparring"" with the intent of trying to best your opponent. Most teachers will usually pick a few topics to focus on at each even, as well. 

If you've never done any Aikido before at all, then the movements will feel new/strange/odd, but if you take them for what they are and just try your best to mimic what others are doing, you'll start to see the method in the madness,so to speak. 

Aikido is not the greatest, or most effective ""martial"" art in the world. However, there are some true pearls of wisdom in terms of technique and tactics that are well worth learning."

Of course, it helped being over a foot taller and 80-100 lbs. heavier than most of the folks you train with, but he does know Aikido. Sadly, he's gone completely bonkers in his later years and is pretty much human garbage at this point."

Hard to criticize ""warmongers"", when you willingly choose to go fight wars on their behalf. 

That being said, we need to get off oil ASAP and out of the Middle East even faster. Starting first and foremost with Israel. The greatest threat to the region and the US, in general."

explainlikeimfive,fdmuw9q,t3_em7x8j,1578566940.0,"no, but there is no draft and no one is getting conscripted into anything here in the US. of course, you could also get your millionaire daddy to bribe a doctor to say you have medical issues, like bone spurs for example. it worked for our current president, anyway. 

There are actually legitimate ways to get out of it, like some religious exemptions, but if the real draft ever gets reinstated then you either have to flee the country, or get put in jail. Thankfully, the draft is wildly unpopular to everyone and there is about a -100% that it will ever be reinstated again. we simply don't need that many humans to fight wars anymore thanks to ""muh drones""."
