AmItheAsshole,fel021v,t1_fekzgux,1579211171.0,"Yeah I don't think she does things to be vindictive, I think she tries to do what she thinks is right. Just most of the time it backfires on, well me.

It use to really bother me, but as I've gotten older kind of grown to accept it as being ""normal"" for this side of the family. My dad use to be my go to for these questions, but he has health things and don't want to add to his stuff.

Thank you again for the reply!"
AmItheAsshole,fekypgd,t1_feky9vk,1579210363.0,"I don't want you to judge her. I have been singled out or left out of family things in the past. Try not to let that feeling linger so usually just accept and move on. But, even with all that still love my Grandma. I thank you for your reply, and am planning on lunch when she gets back from her trip.

My mom is pretty cool, but naive to social situations. So she finds this normal and doesn't understand my wariness.

Thank you for the reply

AmItheAsshole,fekxos4,t1_fekx9ic,1579209752.0,"Like I said I just hate the funds aspect. Like I love spending time with her and doing that stuff, just hate this I'll give you something if you come visit. But I will talk talking to her about it and seeing what comes from that. Thank you!"
AmItheAsshole,fekxeat,t1_fekx6ux,1579209577.0,"I guess it is because of the money aspect. I hate the idea of being paid to visit her. I don't mind visiting, but would prefer not to have money there. Honestly I would feel better about the whole thing if she kept her money."

college,fcmmp6y,t3_ehsw3s,1577781873.0,"Absolutely, my campus has an underground tunnel network that connects to an island in the middle of the campus pond. If nothing else a great way to get around in the winter. No idea what it's actual use is, but it's a fun way to travel. There are also a couple of roof access points in different buildings, and one gets you into a campus green house. Just fun things to find."
college,fc6zzzy,t3_egevcc,1577493891.0,"Peppermint is your friend. The human mind is wonderfully flawed, but scent is one of our best senses. While you study keep peppermint tea or mints nearby, the smell will help you to associate the smell with what you studied (typically used before a test or final). Then have peppermints with you when you're taking the exam. Also, before testing (30 min or so) eat a banana. Bananas have tryptophan as well as vitamins A, B6 and C, fibre, potassium, phosphorous, iron and carbohydrates. All things which can help with mood stabilizers (though some of this is placebo) it will help reduce blood pressure and can help with stress levels.

It doesn't sound like homework is where you struggle, but I can say when I have study groups I perform better across all subjects.

When studying have chegg or quizlet ready as a study guide, do the questions in the chapters that weren't covered by the homework, check your answers with those websites. Look up your courses question banks, to get an idea of what might be on the test. Go to review sessions when you can and if available they are available. Tutoring sessions are another useful resource. I know work might cut into those last options, but take advantage when you can!

The questionable way is ADHD meds, they will increase focus. Some risk of dependency. Don't condone it, but it is there."

I'm just stating that this generalized race blanket you are attempting to spread is misinformed and bigoted. It is literally impossible to be racist against your own race. You can dislike even hate your own race but you cannot be racist against it.  But the fact remains no one made this about race, but you.

As for myself I am not 12, I haven't lived with my parents in several years, I have lived in multiple countries, and several states...damn there goes being sheltered."
