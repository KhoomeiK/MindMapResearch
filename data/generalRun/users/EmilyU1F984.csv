Damnthatsinteresting,fglleby,t1_fglkveo,1580903200.0,"https://www.bzfe.de/inhalt/fruchtsaefte-31653.html fruit *juices* may only contain fruit juice, no refined sugars.


Glucose is glucose, whether it's purified or not. 

Cloudy apple juice has a GI of 41
Coke 63.

That's both a medium GI.


And what I explained in my comment before is exactly how the GI is defined. 

Pure Glucose is set to 100, everything else depends on glucose concentration as well as how tightly it bound.



Don't fall victim to the naturopathic shills telling you sugar somehow gets healthy, just because it's 'natural'.


It does not. Every bit of glucose and fructose over the recommended values of around 20 to 40g a day is unhealthy. 

Sure excessive calories in form of coke is slightly worse than apple juice is much worse than raw wheat.

But they are all bad. No matter the source. Excessive sugar uptake is not healthy.

If someone were to drink just a liter of apple juice, they'd be past the recommended amount.


Whether something is natural or not does not mean it's in and way safer or worse."
Damnthatsinteresting,fglkebg,t1_fglk5km,1580902028.0,"Yes, but I'm saying fruit juice or smoothie with or without added sugar is still nearly as bad as drinking coke, and not a good replacement of you are drinking only soft drinks.

Our fruit juices are not allowed to have added sugars, otherwise they can't be sold as fruit juice, but fruit drinks.

And proper, direct pressed apple juice still has 10g of sugar per 100 ml.

And virtually all of that sugar is dissolved in the water of the juice. Just like any molecularly identical added sugars would be.


So yea I'm totally fine with even banning added sugars from fruit *juice*, but the juice will still not be a healthy beverage for drinking 2 litres of a day."

Damnthatsinteresting,fgljzl2,t1_fglizuv,1580901523.0,"The last part is only true when the fruit is still whole.

A perfectly pureed juice or smoothie will have nearly all of the sugar just in solution like a coke would.


The only benefit is the fruity drinks contain some vitamins and minerals.



And added sugar would need to be labeled for more than a decade in stuff that's naturally containing enough sugar.

Stuff in the US is drastically sweeter than here in Germany though.



The sugars in fruit are also just glucose and fructose, they are just contained inside the fruit cells and will only be partially released by chewing. + you got some fiber as well, though for juice that's mostly removed anyway.


What's worst is that I can't buy vanilla coke anymore. They only sell regular coke with sugar around me. All the other variants contain various, disgustingly off tasting sweeteners. 

Vanilla coke hadn't even been available in diet before, so I just got my once every few months bottle. Had to give it away :(."

Basically like cooking a soup or stew with fatty ingredients, you'll get oil eyes on the top that you can skim off.


It's what happens to fresh untreated milk right from the udder, that's why milk is typically sold 'homogenised' which is just milk being blended to make uniformly small droplets, which stops the fat from seperating from the water for quite some time.

You can buy 'organic' milk that's not homogenised, and there'll be a layer of butter at the top, so you'll have to shake the bottle.


The same happens for fresh cream as well. The one from the cooler: There'll be a layer of butter at the top.

Most cream has additives though to prevent this. The most common one is carrageenan, a polymer extracted from seaweed. Which stabilises the cream emulsion by basically coating the fat droplets and preventing them from merging and then rising to the top, as well as lowering the density of the water-phase, as to make the lipid phase and water phase have similar densities, so the fat doesn't want to rise to the top.

It also makes the whipped cream stay in shape longer as an added benefit.



Milk is basically a mixture of fat/lipid droplets in a solution of sugar (lactose), protein and various vitamins and minerals in water.



Carrageenan is also the most common stabiliser in the typical low quality grocery chocolate milks.

They use the cheapest grade of milk available, the ones with all the fat removed. Which means there's nothing for the cocoa/chocolate powder to dissolve into, meaning it'll seperate very quickly if no stabilisers are added.

'real' chocolate milk using homogenised full fat milk is much more stable cause the lipophilic cocoa molecules dissolve into the fat droplets.

As for therapy, as far as I'm aware DBT still has the best cure/control rate and has the most data bavking it up as effective.



As for the gender imbalance: It seems that most men suffering from BPD don't end up in hospital/psychiatric care but rather in prison.


But yea, unless we find something like genetic markers for the diseases, BPD and cPSTD will be near impossible to differentiate.

Just like the block of depression symptoms is very likely several disorders with very different biochemical foundations.
