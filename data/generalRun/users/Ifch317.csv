Thanks for telling your tale. I hope you and your family are happy in Austin. I lived there as a student and loved it. It has a very different vibe than the rest of Texas and certainly different from NYC."
financialindependence,ffhkcky,t1_ffhhjqc,1579939259.0,Agreed there are a lot of angles to keep up with and any of them can have hazards. I hate losing an item I have in stock. I just completed an overhaul of my inventory system before leaving for Japan.
financialindependence,ffggvne,t1_ffejxlr,1579905950.0,"Last year I spent 4 to 20 hours per week working - usually around 10 to 12 hours. I traveled for 12 weeks and did not work at all  Three seasons, I go to garage sales on Friday mornings for ~3 hours. I usually pop into thrift stores close to the library or grocery store when I am there anyway (30 minutes twice a week). When I put in longer hours it is listing items. I will photograph stuff for a couple hours and then create listings for another couple hours. When I have stuff that is all related, I tend to try to knock it all out in a few sittings so I can keep it organized.

I did mention that a once in a lifetime find accounted for 3/4 of my income last year. I put more time & energy into the eBay store last year then I expect I will do in the future. Partly because I had such valuable materials to sell (literally like printing money), and partly because I was newly retired and the effort was a good transition activity. If I make $10 to $20k in 2020 with about 1/2 as much effort, I will be happy.

I always have my eyes out for items that are not valued by their current owner that could be valued more highly of presented in a different market. For me, it is a treasure hunt and the treasure is opportunity for interactions with people, the challenge of capturing the beauty of an item in photographs and words, the joy of learning about something I do not know and the financial gain of buying something for a small percent of it's sold value."

We earned good salaries and moved to make better salaries (though we did not pursue endless elevations at the expense of quality of life - no travel during the working week and we wanted our kids to graduate high school in the same community they started elementary school in). 

We put away money and treated the ups and downs of the market like it was Monopoly money. 

We got lucky in health, in jobs, and in comparability.

When we didn't really know what we were doing with money, we were not too spendy. We took loans to buy new cars, but only twice (Honda Civic and Hyundai Elantra) and drove them to death.

My money was in the Wellington fund (balanced mostly US stocks and bonds). She had more international development index. We maxed every year and eventually were able to contribute IRA as well. We also were paying off $70k of student loans, paying for a house and raising two kiddos. I never looked at retirement accounts as anything but ""Monopoly money"" until 2015. That is when I started reading about retirement and how to access funds and how to leave work early. We got more serious about saving. At age 56, I was eligible to take early retirement at my job, and I took it. My wife continues to work now. I live frugally, but enjoy my days much more than when I was in an office. I travel cheaply (backpack hostels, etc) and hike and snowshoe at home. I don't know if what we saved so far will be enough, but I would rather live affordably and have more years of freedom than work five more years to be able to be casual about money."

financialindependence,femplaf,t3_epv1n6,1579265805.0,"In the first two weeks of dating, my wife and I discussed money and established that we were both on the same page. 

We earned good salaries and moved to make better salaries (though we did not pursue endless elevations at the expense of quality of life - no travel during the working week and we wanted our kids to graduate high school in the same community they started elementary school in). 

We put away money and treated the ups and downs of the market like it was Monopoly money. 

We got lucky in health, in jobs, and in comparability.

When we didn't really know what we were doing with money, we were not too spendy. We took loans to buy new cars, but only twice (Honda Civic and Hyundai Elantra) and drove them to death.

Now with some money put away, we still behave as if $10 is a lot to spend."

My money was in the Wellington fund (balanced mostly US stocks and bonds). She had more international development index. We maxed every year and eventually were able to contribute IRA as well. We also were paying off $70k of student loans, paying for a house and raising two kiddos. I never looked at retirement accounts as anything but ""Monopoly money"" until 2015. That is when I started reading about retirement and how to access funds and how to leave work early. We got more serious about saving. At age 56, I was eligible to take early retirement at my job, and I took it. My wife continues to work now. I live frugally, but enjoy my days much more than when I was in an office. I travel cheaply (backpack hostels, etc) and hike and snowshoe at home. I don't know if what we saved so far will be enough, but I would rather live affordably and have more years of freedom than work five more years to be able to be casual about money."
