For me, the issue is...if it ISN'T caused by humans, then sure, it'll likely normalize. There will be some changes, however, we're still going to have to innovate to adapt to the new normal.

If it IS caused by humans, then we're either on or boarding a runaway train we likely won't be able to stop."

EatCheapAndHealthy,fdhjzc0,t3_elc8s8,1578424260.0,"So, I'm going to take an approach that's a little bit different. I myself struggle with cooking sometimes, I either get busy, or if I'm sick, or just plain feeling lazy.

Look into cheap*er* alternatives than just eating crap food constantly.

Do you like Chipotle? It's not the *Best* but it's better than McBurgers, a burrito bowl for $7, get fajita veggies, or chicken, if you ask for extra beans/rice and portion it out, that is easily 2 meals or 3, depending on how you portion it out. It's quick, and arguably one of the better fastish food options.

Another thing you could try are salads, several heads of romaine lettuce, a nice salad dressing, and some pre-cooked chicken strips, or nuts, or some kind of trail mix (Target has a nice blend of cranberries, sunflower seeds and pepitas). --- Altogether, should run about $10-15, and should make enough for 5-6 salads, about $2-3 per serving.

Lastly, there's always frozen meals, the nicer $3-4 meals on sale are often about $2, or $2.50 if you keep an eye out for deals.

None of these are the extreme savings you'll get by cooking at home, balancing meals, etc, but these are my go-to's when I'm struggling and can't or won't cook for myself to prevent me from eating fast food constantly."

I was in the water, about knee deep just kind of wading and had a bad feeling.

JapanTravel,fc47u5v,t1_fc417db,1577408966.0,"Idk, I've mixed feelings about the TeamLab exhibits. I went to Borderless first and was convinced to check out Planets, I'm so glad that I did. 

I feel like I would've enjoyed Borderless significantly more if it were less crowded, probably cut down by at least half. Hard to really find a sense of exploration and wonder when the main flower hallways were wall to wall people. :(

I sat on Breath of the Wild for a year because I hated the joycons, finally played it a couple months back when I picked up a Pro controller.

That said...only Nintendo with their overpriced nonsense can get away with selling a controller for $56 ON SALE."
