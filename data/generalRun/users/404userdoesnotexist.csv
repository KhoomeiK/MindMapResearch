Personally though I largely ignore these parts and enjoy his writing anyway."
Damnthatsinteresting,fdlj5uf,t1_fdl29tq,1578525179.0,"Well, yes and no. Bushfires are indeed normal and do help with soil quality and allow regrowth. It's quite common to see burnt tree trunks on perfectly healthy trees as a sign of one of these fires having burnt shrubbery and low growing plants around them.

These fires we've been experiencing however are burning far too hot and quickly for this. Instead of clearing the ground for new growth they're destroying everything which lies in their paths. This is not good for the environment, as can be seen on Kangaroo Island where there is nothing but dead trees as far as you can see."
dogswithjobs,fdj9m2l,t1_fdiputu,1578462465.0,"Australia and Canada have very different climates. Australia is much drier which creates faster burning fuel and is also of course significantly hotter.

I'm not an expert but I'd imagine Canadian fires would be easier (although still difficult) to predict and contain.

It's the speed and unpredictability that gets you. A fire may have a 5km front which then changes to a 100km front racing toward you at 20km/h, as is often the case with grassfires. When you then have 100 livestock, there's nothing you can do."

depression,fd2fgkk,t3_ejwd6z,1578146450.0,"I don't have any advice, it's all bullshit anyway. Just know that I'm 19 as well and this is exactly how I feel. Don't want to be with anyone despite the loneliness, don't want to go to festivals or party or live it up while I'm young or any of that shit.

Any time I do talk with someone it makes me feel shittier, so i do nothing. All day, I just just waste time mindlessly until it's over.

Also recently deleted what i was using to talk to the only two people in my life. It's just not fucking worth it - none of it is."
depression,fd2egsp,t3_ejwuty,1578146054.0,What's in your head?
depression,fd2ecna,t3_ejwrlx,1578146003.0,"I get the feeling all the time. Mostly after hanging out with people actually, which is something I've been trying to do recently.

When I'm with people or someone I feel okay but afterwards is just awful. I don't think it's cause I wish they hadn't left, but it's more like the realisation of how I'll never really connect to anyone. Hanging around people when you're not really with them is exhausting."

There are these kinds of posts on every sub ever, they're as much about attention as anything else."
fakehistoryporn,fc3qi00,t1_fc3ozja,1577396085.0,"Mate, all I said was that Australia is not one of the worst countries, which it isn't. There's no need to even mention ""genetic inferiority"" or to make patronizing comments like ""hunky dory üåû"", no one likes to feel like they're stupid, doesn't matter if they are or not.

It's a shame cause I actually agree with you. Australia's citizens are relatively very well off and we absolutely should be a country on the forefront of climate action. And as for China I don't think they're very much at fault at all because in many ways they're ahead of everyone else in reducing their emissions.

It's a global issue that we all need to collectively agree to fix. It's just not that simple."
fakehistoryporn,fc3ka4i,t1_fc39v8h,1577391667.0,"One of the most polluting countries on earth? That is just wrong. We produce three times more carbon per person than global average, but so do MANY other countries and with much larger populations than Australia. Yes we have a shit government, I voted for the other guys and can't speak for the idiots who didn't. But one of the worst countries on earth we are not."

Yee this is a rant and not meant to show a balanced perspective but there's very likely more to this."
