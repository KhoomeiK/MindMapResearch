Dash dance as fast as you can, then as slowly as your character can

Do a dash dance that combines the two to go from one end of FD to the other, then back

If you can, go to frozen pokemon stadium, and dash dance between the various markings on the ground. Transition from dashing in one half of the pokeball, to the whole thing, to the other half, for example

Also on that stage, start in the middle of the pokeball. (Turn around in place to see where your pivot point is, and center that). From there, do wavedashes at as many angles as you can, see where you end up. Then practice getting the specific lengths on purpose

Practice every combination of dashes and wavedashes, you'll slide a little during your jumpsquat if you're dashing when you start the wavedash.

Pivot wavedash out of your dash dance to avoid the sliding mentioned above (this one is good for grabbing ledge)"

I think my main issue with the writing is that too much of the dialogue is about the act of literally climbing the mountain. Some parts of it still work, like the line where she says ""she'll just go home and be sad (or do nothing?) forever"", I can't remember the exact line but I remember liking it. But in reflections, when the mountain is supposedly forcing her to confront Badeline so that they can work out their issues, the dialog is still about climbing the mountain in the first place, not their issues.

I also get really frustrated, because I think that the idea of talking to part of your brain like it's a separate entity is super helpful. But, the actual conversation between them at the end of reflections just doesn't seem healthy. Madeline essentially says ""cmon, you know you want to"" and that's it, there isn't enough consideration for Badeline's feelings and reasoning, it just comes across as Madeline strongarming what she wants like she's been doing the whole game.

Another part of the problem might be that Badeline isn't actually in Madeline's head during the whole game, so we don't get to hear how they talk normally, without the mountain's influence. The game could definitely be rewritten so that Badeline dips in and out of Madeline's head, spending half the time saying nasty things to her in Madeline's own voice. Then, while Badeline has snuck out to chase her or to physically sabotage something, Madeline isn't saying those things to herself. Badeline is already inside her head again at the start of Reflections, so this idea is sort of there, but it could really be expanded."

My thoughts:  
* M2K keeps maining mewtwo, still is a god

* Fast characters are still overrated during crucial periods of growth, just like how fox seemed to beat puff and peach for free in our timeline

* Sheik gets less hate, because she's no longer the only good midfaller without a sword

* Wobbles wins that Evo due to ICs buffs, but wobbling is banned with no controversy

SSBM,felge96,t3_epgfmx,1579221557.0,"Mini ""MultiMod at work"" review:

* We weren't using those characters anyway, so I turned on SD remix. The changelists are exhausting to read, but at a surface casual level, characters aren't shockingly bad like in vanilla melee. I've tried Mewtwo the most, he's fun; I can't wait to be disappointed next time I try him in vanilla. My coworker is a bad Luigi with or without the changes, and Marth still has a sword, so the buffs aren't annoying from that end.

* Scar has told a story about brawl's launch, where he stomped someone as ganon, but they were able to hit him first, so he immediately quit the game. This is how most moves on most characters feel in melee without SD remix (especially Zelda's neutral B); it's a miracle that any of the characters are good. It feels like melee characters were designed by different teams at different power levels, and SD remix characters are all just pulled up to that top power level by the same team.

* The extra stages are kind of boring but seem fine. I used to think custom stages had bad camera settings, but we've actually just all memorized where the top platforms are. The camera pulls in super close and low on every stage if everyone's on the ground.

* QoL features are all great; neutral spawns, invisible nametags when you teleport, quick rumble switch, salty runbacks, salty runbacks to a random stage, skip results, etc. We were playing vanilla on a gamecube before this, and that was a mistake.

* It's nice to just leave the Wii running compared to the GameCube spinning its disc. It also seems to have a setting to fade out the screen so you don't get burn-in, which was a big surprise. It's the FIFA players at work who don't shut off their damn game when they're done, but that's theoretically a good feature

* Didn't disable wobbling or enforce ledge limits because no one's doing that shit at work anyway; didn't freeze stages since the extra stages are all frozen anyway."
