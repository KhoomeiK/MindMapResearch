formula1,ffejybg,t1_ffdnci7,1579851132.0,You would still lose speed due to increased friction and decreased traction (wheels potentially spinning).
PublicFreakout,ffejo7r,t1_ffedxsc,1579850787.0,Dude. It’s a bit for a radio show. He’s not trying to change the world for the better.
PublicFreakout,ffejj39,t1_ffed2tu,1579850612.0,He’s a radio personality. Of course he’s a cunt. It’s a bit.
PublicFreakout,ffejhmf,t1_ffe4pok,1579850561.0,It’s for the lulz. Not to change society in any meaningful way. Jeez.

PublicFreakout,ff3eukm,t1_ff3ddlc,1579539633.0,What crime did she commit? Screaming at people and telling them they’re going to burn in hell isn’t a crime.
PublicFreakout,ff3eoro,t1_ff3a1xc,1579539545.0,"Yeah dude, it’s called free speech. You can pretty much say anything and the most that cops can do is escort you out or detain you.

You created a fictitious situation and claim that it’s what would happen if she were a Muslim? For real?"
IASIP,ff34pia,t1_ff307q0,1579533614.0,Yeah she’s had work done. Hollywood pressures and whatnot.

nba,fe2y7c0,t1_fe0dufv,1578844159.0,"Thanks goodness the Lakers low-balled and Lue was too proud to accept. He’s not a good coach (in my opinion) and we’d be watching the lakers try to figure it out again all year. The Lakers needed a defensive minded coach who could implement a winning defensive strategy and lineups. Lue was not that guy. Lue was the guy to bring in if they wanted Lebron to be the de facto coach again. I’m glad Lebron seems to not be micro-managing the team as much as he has in the past (albeit out of necessity when he does micro-manage, he’s just not very good at it)."

nba,fdxdoul,t1_fdxckz9,1578767698.0,So $44 million includes his sponsorship money?
nba,fdwusi5,t1_fdu87j2,1578762505.0,But look how many points he’s scored! He’s obviously a score first player. Definitely not a generational talent with multiple all-time skilled and possibly the GOAT. Certainly not that.
nba,fdwumsc,t1_fdtuyrz,1578762451.0,"The numbers don’t lie. He’s a prolific, all-time passer, he’s only a well-above-average scorer."
