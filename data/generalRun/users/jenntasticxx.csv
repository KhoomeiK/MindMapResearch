nottheonion,ffq0d1r,t1_ffnehly,1580113545.0,"Gotta give a shout out to my local theaters (Celebration Cinema if you're curious). Tickets are around $11, pop and popcorn are of course pricey ($4.50 for a medium pop, which is actually pretty huge) but you can get a $45 popcorn bucket that includes coupons for other food they have, a $20 giftcard, and it's good for about 6 months. It's fantastic if you go a lot, especially because you can use it once a day and you get a free refill with it, which you can get in a separate bucket at the same time, so you really get two buckets. If you live near the theater you can just drive up there and only get popcorn too. We definitely get our moneys worth. 

They also have a ""cheap theater"" that plays movies that just left the regular theater for only $6. And they have T.A.C.O Tuesdays (Tickets Are Cheap On Tuesdays) and movies for $6 at the regular theaters."

So I assume this is basically saying that as long as I am allowed to do my normal job, any other special perks can be taken away if they're not part of my job description?
