Documentaries,ffcm7ne,t1_ffck31a,1579802423.0,"When you start breaking down exactly what is or isn’t a Muslim country by the decrees of biased and opposed religious clerics you’ve run into a problem. 


It helps to say that Bangladesh is a Muslim country in this instance because sex and religion are both fundamental forces in society and more often than not religious attitudes drive sexual behaviours. 


If we were discussing the spread of AIDs and lack of contraception in a Catholic country it would make sense to describe the country as Catholic because Catholic religious beliefs regarding condoms are relevant to this conversation. 


For Bangladesh describing them as one of the few Muslim countries with an open and visible red light district is relevant to this conversation as Islamic beliefs regarding sex will no doubt affect how Bangladeshi society decides to handle the issue."
Documentaries,ffciu2x,t1_ffchyu7,1579800388.0,"Your point is fundamentally flawed because it assumes that a sinner is not a Muslim. 


Bangladeshi’s read the Quran, they pray, they fast Ramadan they perform the Hajj. The majority of the population is Muslim. It is a Muslim country.

Documentaries,fey8xcf,t1_fey0vc6,1579442274.0,"Arguing for the removal of broken laws against the sex trade that harm sex workers is not advocating for the mincer. In a perfect world no one would be driven into the sex industry, or any industry for that matter, out of economic desperation. 


Until that day the best we can do is create the safest system we possible by creating regulated markets. Not by further marginalising the most vulnerable. 


You say it yourself, sex is one of the fundamental driving forces in society. You really think making it illegal is going to stop people from selling and buying it? 


A wig, body organs, sex aren’t equal.  I am not saying they are. What I am saying is that in the terms of human desires and their ability to create potential markets of exchange they’re similar. As long as there is supply and demand there will be a market. If you try to eradicate it, all you do is force it into the shadows. It happened with alcohol. It happens with drugs. It will always happen. 

These underground markets are not equal in their scope for harm, but they are all driven by the same fundamental human nature which cannot be changed.  The solution is simple, you just allocate the necessary resources of policing and regulation proportionately to each markets as required. 


The only person being presumptuous here is you. You project your own feelings onto sex workers, potential organ sellers, and even the rest of society at large without any consideration that just perhaps not everyone follows your own broken chain of reasoning. 


Your stated beliefs reveal that you care not about actually helping the vulnerable but merely forcing your own view of the world upon others. I’ve already given you some sources for reading which I hope you check out, but since you don’t seem to want to expand your narrow views and learn I can no longer carry on this conversation."
Documentaries,fexwt01,t1_fexuo45,1579437747.0,"You do not get to decide what other people are allowed to do with their bodies when they are harming no one. In many instances we can already sell plasma, blood, and hair for profit and I do not see people being kidnapped and strong-armed into selling these parts. If you’re argument is ‘well those are renewable’ I can regrow part of my liver but I still can’t sell that. 


There is no formal logical coherent argument for the ban of a regulated trade in certain organs. It’s just fear and scare mongering by reactionists. If you’re open to a philosophical discussion look up Janet Radcliffe Richards arguments on the subject. 


The presence of the Eastern European women in the Germany sex industry is simply a matter of supply and demand. Taking issue with their labour and not that of other immigrant workers in dangerous jobs like construction is simply due to your own biases and moralistic views on sex work. Every study not driven by an agenda has indeed found that decriminalisation and regulation helps sex workers and improves their quality of life."
Documentaries,fexpqql,t1_fexo742,1579434536.0,"This is some slippery slope logic BS. Iran actually has a regulated market for the sale of kidneys and by all appearances most studies have found it incredibly effective. 


A black market for organ sales does already exist, just as a black market for any goods in low supply and high demand exists. The only thing criminalisation does is push these markets further into the shadows making any harm and exploitation beyond the reach of the law to regulate."

Asking for a paternity test is simply asking for evidence that the baby is truly his. It’s asking to assuage the nagging fears and doubts he will have. These happen involuntarily and childish notions of love will not eliminate them.
