Now, all Star Wars references is other Star Wars movies."

PoliticalDiscussion,ffe01pc,t1_ffchv2g,1579833209.0,"I'll add another point, his supporters already knew he's a scoundrel, they baked all that in when they voted for him the first time. But they seem to think he's only lying and cheating the other side and not conning them too. Millions of them have fallen for his routine completely and think he really is a billionaire real estate mogul, and Trump badly wants to keep it that way. His supporters are so deep in his thrall now that it probably wouldn't matter if the truth came out, but earlier in his political career it might have."
