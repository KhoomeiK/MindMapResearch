WagWalker,ffi1s2r,t1_ffi0qps,1579962524.0,"Yup!  It sucks.  I have to constantly apologize and explain to the owners why we ""teleported through yards and over houses"" since it won't track curves or corners or accurately anything (just a straight line) unless the app is open to the walk screen.  I do have all settings (which I'm sure you do too) for location set to always ect and nothing helps.  It's broken in the app only."
WagWalker,ffi1c04,t3_etjleg,1579962112.0,Absolutely zero sound.  Everything is set to sound and enabled.  Also don't get push notifications for the majority of walks.  Working great.  Have an iphone too.
WagWalker,ffi0yfs,t1_ffg9moi,1579961762.0,"Same for me on both fronts, I have ZERO sound too on push notifications.  I miss all the notifications.  Text messages I always had sound.  Clicking on the push notifications leads to nowhere.  It's so broken.  

I have sound enabled for the Wag app and everything for notifications enabled.  GPS tracking is also broken for me.  It doesn't properly track my walks."
WagWalker,ffi0jal,t1_ffgw4so,1579961360.0,Thanks!  They may come yet if you do the same.  I have over 1k walks and some of these are from owners I walked a few times before but they didn't immediately say that.  It just let me know that they were reading them and did appreciate them even though they just left 5\* previously.  So it's totally possible those 5\*s you get with good tips are from people who appreciate the reports even if they don't explicitly say
WagWalker,ffgjyfe,t3_ethbp9,1579907965.0,"I would just be honest and let the owner know that the dog reacted and accidentally bit your leg.  This should be enough of an obvious notice to the owner that this is a serious problem where she needs training ASAP.  However, considering the dog bit you, I don't think you're being rude or overstepping suggesting or telling that the dog needs help.

Also sounds like redirected aggression and that's dangerous.  I walk leash reactive dogs.  I have two regulars who are very dog reactive.  However, they do not redirect to me.  I do work with them on it but the fact that the dog you had went from 0 to 9 within a couple seconds is very concerning.  I wouldn't walk her again, personally.  It isn't worth the risk.  If you do continue walking her, take it very serious and be hyper vigilant about where other people and dogs are.  You can't let your guard down on this dog."
WagWalker,ffgj344,t3_eta81o,1579907395.0,"Would be nice to know but I always just write thorough reports to be safe, include 1 video (2-3 for an hour walk), and 1 picture.  I currently have 54 Excellent report card badges.  Some owner compliments from reports:

* ""the report cards are the best!""
* ""She provided updates and a video throughout and left an extremely thorough report card with lots of good feedback!  Will definitely use her again."" <- they didn't tip though lol
* "".....I think the best part is in her report card, she referred to her umbrella as the thin little octopus in the air.  Definitely recommend!""
* ""Great report!  Loved the care she showed!""
* ""Love hearing about your adventures, thanks as always!!!""
* ""Sent us great feedback, sent sweet videos, and loved Huck so well!""
* ""My dogs look forward to her every time and she always does a great job and lets you know what they did and where they went.""
* ""She is amazing!  Always takes such good care of my pup, and the updates she sends always make my day!""

\+ more.  Those are just some of the report related reviews but it's enough to let me know owners do care and do read them and it's worth it : )"
WagWalker,ffg4xrr,t1_fffbev5,1579898547.0,"I don't believe so.  I use my GPS for two other apps- one dog walking and one fitness and it tracks beautifully.  The only issue I have is with the Wag app.  It's consistently won't track properly and only since one of the more recent updates (the past couple months). 

I have an iOS too and an approved apple phone.  Signal is fine and I'm in a populated city."
WagWalker,fff1fak,t1_ffd6qwr,1579873049.0,"This is a almost useless update.  Who cares.  Owners can bait and switch tips (it isn't finalized until the end of service).  This won't make much of a difference.  I would rather:

1.  Have timely text notifications back so I can see and hear when my preferred clients request me and stop missing walks from push notifications - and then not even know I missed it.  Heck, any text notifications back.  Not having them at all is worse for the walkers.
2. Fix the very broken GPS tracking that doesn't honestly let the owner know how far we walked the dogs.
3. Have some sort of Bonus feature back like what we had with the $1 bandana."
WagWalker,fff0zqy,t1_ffeyv1g,1579872689.0,Yup.
WagWalker,fff0s88,t3_et4haa,1579872512.0,"Another issue with just the push notifications is that we now have to keep the app constantly open during the walks since the GPS is broken.  I typically like to put my phone in my pocket with it open so it *actually tracks* the walk.  When I do this, I don't get sound for push notifications.  They pop up and go away silently.  I'm missing walks.  The only way to still get walks is to stare at the app constantly while walking dogs on the walk- which isn't safe.

OR

Close the app completely like I used to do and let the GPS read that we only walked .8 miles in 30 min (when we did 1.5 miles) and have to explain to the owner, again, the app is broken just so I can still get notifications for walks.

There isn't a good choice here.  The latter being annoying, but safer.  Before, I could put the phone in my pocket and still get preferred walker texts SOUND notifications so I could book those walks.

ETA: also don't get any push notifications from dogs I haven't walked before or am not a preferred.  Dogs in my area, I'm not notified of...which is nice...not."
pettyrevenge,ffbzlfb,t1_ffbx9o6,1579787680.0,Of course they can.  I live in an apartment complex with multiple buildings and it's a gated community.  Cops have access to get through the front gate and can drive around to various apartment buildings.  Many doors are ground level and next to the parking lot.  He could just drive up to one of the apartment buildings and be right in front of an apartment door.
WagWalker,ffbz467,t3_esgqrf,1579787302.0,"I hate them too.  I have one client whose lockbox is kept outside and it is completely rusted inside of it.  The numbers stick, the latch sticks from the rust.  It took me 12 minutes to open it the other day and I have to use keys to pry it or my nails break.  I contacted support and told them that the lockbox is no good.  They told me, rather than them, to contact the owner and ask him to request a new one.  I guess that's my job too.  Thanks.  I asked via messaging but never heard back.  One of these days I won't be able to open the thing and the dog won't get walked or I just won't have the time to mess with it."
WagWalker,ffbys1t,t3_eshf5y,1579787030.0,"Walkers: ""We *need* notifications to get to us sooner since we can't accept walks.""

Wag: \*deletes text notifications\*  ""It's okay, you still have push notifications just like before where you can only see one at a time and for one second before it goes away or gets replaced by another.""

:l  Yes, Wag, yes.   That's exactly what we need.  Was wondering why it was even harder to get walks yesterday or figure out who asked for me (preferred clients-it's in the push but easy to miss, just like the push notifications are easy to miss and those are *hit or miss or also delayed*).  Then they kept getting buried under other push.  At least for my preferred clients, it was easy and helpful to be able to click on the text notification or, at least see, that they requested me.  Now I've no way of knowing if I missed their walks for the day or week and less of a chance of getting it booked."
WagWalker,ffb8ei1,t3_esmm4k,1579754887.0,"Wake up at 7:30 or 8 depending on what walks I have that day.  My weekly private clients are typically at 11-11:30 Tues/Thurs, 12-12:30 Tues/Thurs, 12-12:20 Mon/Wed/Fri, M-F 1:20-1:50 and 2-2:30.  Then I fill in the gaps with regulars from Wag and other private requests usually taking on 6-9 total bookings a day.  Sometimes I'm done by 3:30 and sometimes as late as 6.  Just depends.  

Weekends I tend to pick only who I really want to walk.  I rarely work Sunday (maybe 1 walk if I like the client).  Saturday I may do up to 4-5 bookings if I feel like working or need to."
WagWalker,ff7fthw,t1_ff6ua3o,1579648564.0,Not me...I'm out LOL... All yours C:
WagWalker,ff7fow9,t1_ff6cmtg,1579648479.0,"Yes.   The notifications are delayed by sometimes up to 15 minutes.  On a good day, 2-5 minutes.  By then the walks are normally long gone.  Heck, in my area, by 10 seconds they are often gone."
WagWalker,ff7fii5,t3_es1zg6,1579648361.0,This is so adorable!  I love the polka dot leash too!
WagWalker,ff7ff7k,t3_erzy4o,1579648301.0,"Wouldn't stress too much over this.  You explained it to the owner.  I do the notifications at least one time during the walk.  I try to do it at the area they did it in but sometimes I either a- forget, b- it isn't safe currently (reactive dog sees another reactive dog), c- I had gloves on and am walking two dogs and it's a process or d- it's raining and I'm more concerned with the safety of the dogs on the walk with the umbrella than getting out the phone to mark.  Dog's safety is #1.  Just mark it by the end and say in the report card how many times ect."
WagWalker,ff7ezlf,t1_ff6helm,1579648015.0,It's confusing and irritating for me when owners cancel walks last minute and we get nothing while Wag pockets 100% of that $10 cancellation fee.
WagWalker,ff5venh,t1_ff4shwa,1579611578.0,More than I would've done.  I don't offer to pay for gear that breaks.  It isn't my fault and it wasn't yours either.  You can dispute it if you get a bad review on that.
WagWalker,ff5v8dh,t1_ff4yfqq,1579611412.0,"I think this part confused me then:  ""If you choose to provide equipment to Pet Care Providers, Pet Care  Providers have the right to refuse a pet care service that involves a  retractable leash""... I see what it was saying then.  I guess I assumed we could reject using the the leash and use a safer one, but I see they mean we should just cancel those walks.  Thanks!

Doubling up leashes it is then."
WagWalker,ff4paw8,t3_erlmyk,1579569180.0,"I'm sorry Izzy.  : (  Hope it works out since this could, literally, happen to anyone.  Dogs get out of wire crates all the time."
WagWalker,ff4oz98,t1_ff49gz2,1579568952.0,"We can use our own leash instead of a retractable leash (it's in our contract) just due to the nature of retractable leashes being insecure and a liability.  ETA- no we can't lol, Wag acknowledges it's insecure and a liability and the owner is a fault if their dog is killed or injured in the event of a malfunction or I guess it runs into traffic.  

What they could do, I also do this sometimes, is double leash.  If I feel a harness isn't secure or a leash is ...complete shit...I will use my backup leash in conjunction with their harness, leash ect.  I keep the backup leash secure to my person and loose so the primary gear in use is the owner's.  It's just an extra safety measure I like to do in those rare instances I don't trust the harness the dog is swimming in or the leash that is chewed up and being held together by threads.  It's about what's safest for the dog."
WagWalker,ff2x1cu,t1_ff22227,1579527311.0,"OH dear, you've had some bad luck!  If you go under Help in the app -> My Account -> type dispute review in Quick Search then the link will automatically pop up.  It says 30 days.  Not sure when the incident occurred.  I'm stubborn and would go as far as contacting support to ask if you still can since you were new and didn't know any better (under 10 walks).  They may be willing to help you.  It is Wag support, however but doesn't hurt to ask!

I've had other poop stories too XD.  Including another where it went from inside the kennel to up the back wall (gross), another where the dog covered his HUGE poop in a blanket to where the blanket was shoved in the back so when I went to reach inside the blanket to make his crate soft again...you guessed it... : /  another where this rich owner fed her dog ALPO.  No joke.  Extremely fancy expensive apartment and she requested I feed him every time this black tar from a can.  Looked the same coming out as going in and there was numerous of that."
WagWalker,ff0r5qv,t3_eqk0yp,1579471518.0,I'm pretty established in my area and am in the South.  Most people tip (including when I first started at least over half).  Currently it's 80% or more that tip.
WagWalker,feznxp0,t3_eqzmqu,1579459493.0,Weekends are slower anyway.  You'll have better luck during the work week.  Wake up early (assuming you are able).  Requests start going out 6-7 am sometimes and definitely by 8am.  Especially Monday- some book for the week then.  Change your distance to a little further if you must.  I did this at the start just so I could get some walks on my profile.
WagWalker,feyqd0q,t3_eqpy1k,1579449269.0,"What a bitch.  I'll just say it with you.  I'm often around 15 minutes early and I especially like to be that early when there is inclement weather.  Anything could happen and it helps to be that early to put on rain or snow gear and to give yourself time after to wipe down paws and dry the pups.  15 minutes is nothing.  Your ETA should announce that sufficiently to the owner.  

Dispute the review.  Won't hurt to and can likely get it removed.  I also haven't ran into many owners like that.  Most just tell me that they will finish drying the dog or they grab a towel and help dry them with me or they thank me profusely for walking in such weather as well as drying the pup.  I don't understand this type of person.  I would've been upset."
WagWalker,feypqc8,t1_few9eyc,1579448890.0,Could be looking for a female walker if you're a guy.  I've walked a few dogs who require a female walker due to bad experiences with men.  Only thing that makes sense to me.  Otherwise who knows!
WagWalker,feypj31,t1_fevtq4o,1579448756.0,I make exceptions for my favorites and the good tippers too.  : )
WagWalker,feypfnv,t1_feyc7ub,1579448689.0,"Yup!  There's always a pretty good reason it's not being taken.  I get curious too but I've learned it isn't worth it.  I've walked a dog like that before...it was constantly gagging itself from pulling so hard following by coughing.  I felt horrible for it.  Couldn't save it from it's own stupidity or lack of training.  

hahahaha, it's a good thing you couldn't flip them off!  I can only imagine then.  I've had owners honk at me too (which I only learned later).  I ignore people honking by default too.  Also hate being honked at in general.  Always makes me jump."
WagWalker,feyol7z,t1_fewb23w,1579448360.0,"Mystery solved at least!  Sometimes I wonder if the owners realize they caused this and maybe that's why their dog isn't getting walked?  But man, this is why I wish we could see the walker notes first."
WagWalker,feyn2wf,t1_fev6it5,1579447806.0,"Common pattern I've noticed too... owners don't realize how much energy Golden Doodles, Golden Retrievers, and American Labs have.  Most I've walked pull horribly too"
WagWalker,feymtzn,t1_fevxfrz,1579447701.0,"Oh wow, what a pita.  Did you dispute that rating?  I'm sure if you contact support you can easily get that removed.  You didn't do anything wrong to deserve 3\*s and the owner never contacted you until after.

My first walk didn't go smoothly either- It was raining at night and I couldn't see the numbers for the apartment buildings.  Went to the wrong building.  Then finally found the right building (the one my gps didn't bring me to) to walk into basically a Diarrhea explosion in this dog's kennel.  Smelled like something died.  It was death inside that apartment and an unholy mess.  I opted to immediately take the dog out and she pulled hard, in the rain, and balancing an umbrella near impossible.  I spent I don't know how much time when I got back cleaning up the nasty death water poo while holding back throwing up myself.  Just grabbed whatever I could from under the sink and used all the paper towels so then I had to use a towel since I couldn't put her back in that.  Couldn't reach the owner and just hoped what I did was okay.  Left the poop toys and towels on the kitchen floor.  Fortunately I did get 5\*s and I think just a $4 tip (I thought that was a lot then lol).  I was easily there an hour total for that walk."
WagWalker,feykxkz,t1_fev2mut,1579446949.0,"Maybe one day when we can actually see walker notes before accepting walks.  What they show currently is absolutely no valuable information.  98% of owners haven't filled out that info.  Even if it was owner notes, they are often less valuable than the walker notes about the dog's behavior."
WagWalker,feyknna,t1_feuzsr5,1579446858.0,"Thanks ya, exactly.  Seems enough walkers have had enough"
WagWalker,feufqfr,t3_eqjo33,1579386052.0,I've gotten 4\*s for being too honest in a report before.  I said something about their dog biting and playing tug on the leash and I redirected the behavior and got dinged for it.  Many owners don't want to hear anything bad about pookie's behavior.  Just something I've noticed that some owners will give you 4\*'s for things like that.
WagWalker,fer7rnx,t3_eq9cy0,1579350892.0,May want to make sure you have the leash in your hand even for just a picture
WagWalker,feohmd9,t1_fenrrjg,1579300318.0,You won't have to foot the bill.  I doubt there will even be a bill.  I'm sure the owner has a key.  They should have at least two keys extra.  If she gave you 5\*s I'm sure she's not concerned at all and it'll be fine.
WagWalker,feohawh,t3_eq25wp,1579300124.0,I want to clip his nail *so bad.*  Goodness that's long.  He looks super sweet though and very lovable
WagWalker,feoh45k,t3_eq3liv,1579300002.0,"I do.  Only with established clients though and, ideally, ones I know on a personal basis.  I always be sure to leave everything as I found it.  If the seat is up, I leave it up.  Down, I leave it down.  I speak to the dog every time with my ""I gotta pee"" song so the owners know just in case I'm on camera what I'm doing and why.  Have the bladder of a small child I swear and staying hydrated is important.  With so many walks I don't always have time to go to McDonalds or a gas station unless I would like to be late."
WagWalker,femtyok,t3_epr42w,1579269523.0,"You have a right to feel however you feel.  Trust your gut.  Every time I didn't, I got in trouble.  I'm also camera shy so not sure I would've posed with the dogs for a photo ($5 bribe or no).  It's just something I'm not generally comfortable with.  It isn't part of my job.  

There is an equal chance he's just odd.  He could've forgotten about the tip, he could've lied about the tip.  Who knows.  You're safe and next time, if you don't feel safe or okay doing something, just leave : )"
WagWalker,feejp3x,t3_eolo3x,1579035126.0,"That's nothing.  I got 4 stars 6 months later.  Still confused but whatever, life goes on : )"
WagWalker,febofd3,t3_enw6lk,1578961027.0,"Have a dog and he's lived most his life in apartments (he's 12 now).  Border collie mix.  I think, more than anything, it depends on your dedication to exercising your dog combined with the dog's own personality.  I've almost always lived near many parks and we've had trips to those including off-leash areas.  I've ran with him most of his life.  I do miss having a yard but dogs aren't like us.  They live in the present.  He isn't sitting there in the apartment going ""man, I really wish I could lay in the yard again.""  He's sitting there going, ""pet me, feed me, give me treats, look at me!, can we go for a walk please?""  

Having a dog with a more laid back disposition helps (mine is).  He doesn't have anxiety being left in the apartment and just sleeps when I'm away.  Has never destroyed anything in the apartments and I have always gotten my deposit back.  The error with most people and yards is that they let the dogs out to ""exercise themselves.""  It doesn't work like that and I think it's a healthier life for dogs to go on structured walks to get exercise and socialization.  

You can absolutely have a perfectly happy and adjusted dog in an apartment in the city.  It's all about matching the right dog to the environment and putting in the work."
WagWalker,fe864g2,t1_fe65zdk,1578922945.0,They will see 5 stars on your profile when you have a 4.99 star rating...it shows as 5 stars.
WagWalker,fe85gk8,t1_fe6opay,1578922804.0,"It does reflect it.  4.99 is an excellent rating.  You don't need a perfect rating because life isn't perfect and life will never be perfect.  You're not perfect, the dogs aren't perfect, and we all know the owners aren't either.  Look at the Olympics....they don't usually get exactly perfect scores.  I have a 4.99 rating and I'm extremely happy with it.  I think the bigger issue is how you feel inside"

WagWalker,fdz22vw,t3_emzs8z,1578785851.0,"Could it be lipomas?  Sometimes the fatty tumors can develop sores if they are large enough or rub against a body part or the floor.  Certain breeds are more prone to them- labs, beagles ect but can happen to almost any dog as they age.  Usually there are multiples.  My own dog developed 7 or so (where I had 4 removed) and the others have stayed extremely small or even shrunk since changing diet."
WagWalker,fds7iq8,t3_emx1ye,1578696115.0,Yup.  Happened to me yesterday.  I saw a 30 min walk pop up at 2:30 when I already accepted an on demand (owner actually texted me before instructions for puppy - 20 min walk mind you).  I let them know I'll be leaving by x time and be there by y time.  They say okay.  I'm walking to my car to head over and cancelled.  :l  Thanks.  Could've taken that 30 min walk but I made nothing.
WagWalker,fdpbqww,t3_em8j9m,1578624660.0,"Not sure.  I request 1-3 covers a month, I'd guess, on average.  Have over 1300 walks.  I wonder if it's % based.  5% or more of your walks ect.  Who knows...

I get it though...I've requested covers for being too hungover, sick, locked keys in car (that was a fun time), took a walk with a regular that paid more vs one that didn't tip me ever, read notes that said move very slowly with dog...weary with strangers...was for 2 German Shepherds, going on vacation and walks were booked months in advance so multiple covers then due to schedule change, having actual schedule conflict issues of forgetting appointments ect....

Try not to request covers often but life happens and it's a $8 and $12 walk.  Equally important is to not do it last minute.  The more advance the notice, the better."
WagWalker,fdpamo8,t1_fdofvsc,1578623895.0,"I agree.  This is such a bad idea..... It can be equally bad for these ""trainers"" too.  I can only imagine the newest ""dog trainer"" who isn't a dog trainer getting in way over their head on an aggression case.  

I don't think Wag! needs to be ""expanding"" when there are so many current issues with the company that need to be addressed (such as with Walker certifications.... just to start....)

Any trainer worth anything isn't going to take this low pay to train dogs."
WagWalker,fdp9qd1,t1_fdo4yxa,1578623294.0,"Oh I cried like a baby when two of my clients dogs passed last year (September and October).  One of the owners told me when I was out on a walk and it was difficult for me to focus on work that day.  I get really attached and it's hard not to.  You get to know them rain and shine...spend countless hours with them throughout the year.  How can we not care?  They become our little friends too and my heart always goes out to the owner.

I bought cards for both of them and wrote basically a novel.  I mean, I just filled it up with every happy memory I could think of (or my favorites).  Funny memories are good too and the owners were both touched by the gesture.  Just like what you just wrote (things of that nature)."
WagWalker,fdn106n,t1_fdmkh9k,1578573945.0,Same.  I thought they'd release walker notes since those are usually A- more accurate and B- more detailed and C- the ones that warn of us of the dogs that bite.
WagWalker,fdlj5et,t3_elzzy0,1578525172.0,"No.  He needs a professional trainer not a walker.  It also isn't even a good idea to open a crate when a dog is being loud, obnoxious, pushy ect because then you're just reinforcing this behavior.  His reward is that he is let out of his crate for barking and pawing aggressively at the door.  It's a bad idea all around (even if this is related only to excitement).  To do it properly you'd have to wait for him to relax, be quiet, and then open the crate.  This is assuming it's excitement based and not just aggression.  Really he just needs to be trained and worked with."
