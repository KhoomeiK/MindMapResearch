ProgrammerHumor,ffkio3h,t1_ffkgkio,1580023397.0,"I don't want to sound like an asshole, but the majority of my fellow classmates are borderline computer illiterate. When installing python, PATH is by default unchecked. So a lot of them do not know how to add PATH themselves and this it is too much work and effort for them to even look up a video on how to do it themselves. But with anaconda, spamming left click on 'Next' basically does all the work for you. the And on top of that, we were never taught how to download and install libraries because Anaconda had them all, including Jupyter Notebook which is what was used mostly in class.  
So it doesn't surprise me when Professors opt for Anaconda instead of becoming tech-support for an entire class.  


Anecdote - For our Java course this sem, we had to install Java JDK, obviously. It was interesting to spend 2 hours in class browsing Reddit and spectating the class struggle to follow my professor (who btw was very patient and nice) into the jdk directory to get the path for PATH.   
Again, I don't want to sound like an asshole but even if they started to use the computer for the first time 2 years ago when they enrolled in CSE, they should be able to do simple things like this but they are just not motivated enough to learn computers."
ProgrammerHumor,ffkein0,t1_ffk7de2,1580021455.0,"I am a student so my perspective on this might not be what you are looking for, but here it is anyway. 

I have a shitty 4th Gen i3 with 4GB ram which struggle with most of the shit my university asks me to run. Last semester for our Python course students had to run Anaconda because it's easier to install for students lol. I gave up pretty much instantly because of the 5-10min wait time for it to load. 

Then I was introduced to VS Code which takes no longer than 3s to open up. Here are a few things I like about this in no particular order -  
1. **Integrated Shell**  
2. **Intellisence**  
3. **Debugging**   
4. **Integrated Git**   
5. **Extensions**. Now I can get an extention to view my sqlite3 database without a heavy 3rd party software.   
6. **Supports a lot of languages** - Since I have to work on multiple languages, I can switch between my organised folders without losing my previous work state in just 3 clicks.    
7. Extension on the previous point - every language I work on, it has extentions to fully support it + compile the code in VS Code itself.    
8. Another extension to the previous point - I have to use just one editor/compiler/attack helicopter which I can get used to, without having to remember to color code, shortcuts, and quirks of different editors.    
9. Almost **infinite customiziblity** - you need a new key combination for a weird set of action, sure! You can set key-binds to practically everything you can do with your mouse.    
10. **Custom snippets** - I set up a custom snippet for my java course which started just a couple of weeks ago. I start to type 'start' and hit Enter and I get my starting template to start the code. Enter the name of my class, hit tab and I am in the main method. I start to type 'print' and boom, I have System.out.println(""""); with my cursor between the quotes. A lot of quality of life feature you don't get with constantly having to switch between editors.   
11. **Ctrl+Shift+P** - I forgot what it's called but it's a useful thing to ask VS Code to do shit by typing instead of searching for it in menus."

civ,ffild6j,t1_ffih2ma,1579976639.0,May I suggest you to meet our lord and saviour the coal power plant? -  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=im9kcCuo5x8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=im9kcCuo5x8)
civ,ffil9ly,t1_ffif9sm,1579976571.0,"Yes, absolutely. In my opinion, with regards to my playstyle, there is no reason to switch to anything other than coal power plant unless I am running in coal deficit. Here's why - 

Coal power plant is the only building in the industrial zone which gives you major adjacency bonuses. With a well planned industrial zone, I get a minimum of +4 for 2 adjacent aqueducts and another +1 from adjacent districts. That is +5 adjacency guaranteed. Now with policy cards, I can double it to get +10. So I get +10 production each in at least 2 industrial zones. On top of that you can build workshops and factory to increase the production. Now comes the big daddy of all multipliers. Coal power plant gives you production equal to that of your adjacency bonus. You have now just made +20 production on a single industrial zone. Now you get +10 for the bare minimum. You can stretch this to +20 depending on how lucky your spawn is and get a total of +50 from each one of your industrial zone.

Depending on the situation, you can get a lot more from your coal power plants (+10 in this case) as compared to oil (for +3) and nuclear (for +4 and -however much to reset it's age).

india,ffijawr,t3_etpkb0,1579975219.0,"Two questions, how far are you willing to go? and how far will your parents go? 

The choice you are going to make is a difficult one. Whatever choice you make, it is going to define your near future (or maybe even far), for better or for worse. Talk to your parents about this. It is not only just what you say, but also how you say it matters. They shouldn't think that you making a decision based on a fantasy or something.  Don't be afraid to tell your parents what you feel about them, add on extra resentment to your feelings if you feel like it.

I'd like to assume they are someone who loves their daughter more than 'log kya kahenge' bullshit. At least, it was the case for me and my sister. The ultimatum to choose between their son and not talking to them for over 2 months plus not staying in home for more than what's required to sleep, brush, and shit sure showed them that I was serious with my threats. 

Indian society sure does teach their children to be a headless chicken in pursuit of their parent's dreams. If you think you need your parents, in the future, maybe consider for a second that you probably don't need them. I am going to go out on a limb and drop an unpopular opinion - you are not obligated to love your parents. You are not obligated to do shit for them. But they, on the other hand, are obligated to look after you. If they treat you like human, you treat them the same way just like any other person. If they don't, you don't either. I would 100% advice you to be as blunt as possible with your parents now. Tell them exactly how you feel not just about your career but also about your relation with them in the future, even if it sours your relationship with them now. Personally, it made the relationship between me and my mother a lot stronger than it was even if they went into the gutter a for a couple of years in between."

IndianGaming,ffhc169,t3_etg1xu,1579929395.0,"I moved my PC from TN to PB in 2AC. It was work but in the end it wasn't difficult. I wouldn't advice that you do this, but how I've done this is that I picked up the largest suitcase we had laying around, wraped my case in a thick wollen blanket and put it inside the case. The fit was perfect and that thing wasn't moving around. Now on the flat face of on the now case I placed my monitor facing down. I had some more space to the side where I filled with some more blankets to protect it from moving around and filled in the gapes with lose items. CPU cooler, keyboard, mouse, and headphone found their place in other bags. 

I just had to be extremely carful as to where I was keeping the suitcase and nothing was the be placed on top of it so as to not crush the monitor. The total weight of that large suitcase was in the ballpark of 25kgs. My PC is still quite old and I don't mind risking damage in transport. I also travel with just the internals of my PC biannual on an Airplane. Weight of that plus all of my cloths doesn't exceeded 7kgs. For a budget flight 15kg-7kg=8kg is more than enough for me to pack more stuff."

I don't think it is unfair to assume this problem of chasing around fleets will be solved if we had to worry about enemies popping up anywhere, or just going around my defences with other FTL in the game.

Literally doesn't make any sense."
india,fccxo58,t1_fcbpr2i,1577603892.0,"People just love to make excuses. They will have no issues claiming our 'superiority' over Pakistan while dismiss any claims saying otherwise. It suited their narrative to say that people are coming to India from Bangladesh because of India's better economy. But that argument fails when Bangladesh has a better economy than India. 

Comparisons will be made as long as it suits your narrative. The real bad guys (not even in a comic way) is the Chinese government and we never see people comparing ourselves to China. Why you may ask? Because xyz excuse differentiates India from China and that makes comparisons irrelevant. 

Everything you say in your comment is parroted a million times over without really understanding why it happens. You say as if our slowdown is a norm whenever we have a large economy. Our economy isn't even comparable to the largest economies around the world. Did they also suffer from slowdown while they were growing? Are they all an exception and we are going down the 'correct' path?"
india,fc2afam,t3_efsape,1577348535.0,"Gandhi. Inexcusably the most Indian of Indians is praised for his protest against the British to get what is right the the Indian people. 

Now conveniently, they praise him for his protests but want the most severe of punishments possible to those who want their voices heard, just like Gandhi? Make up your mind people. If you want fascism, just say so. That way at least everyone will know what you stand for and what we are fighting against. No need to hide behind the veneer of democracy while striping away personal freedom and rights."

Edit: I promise I'll take a bath tomorrow!"
CGPGrey,fc0775k,t1_fc06hv5,1577281499.0,"Nope. The new Commander of the Final Order fleet understood what they were doing and he ordered for the ground control tower to be disabled and switched to the control tower on his ship. We are only shown that the control tower was just disabled. It could have been destroyed at a later point during the battle, which makes the entire 'land the ground forces and use explosives to destroy it' plot completely useless."
CGPGrey,fc02ih4,t3_efeqm0,1577275277.0,"I have two concerns about the last battle scene where the Final Order faces the Resistance. 

1. They had one control tower for all of these ship with no redundancy, (which is fine I guess?) but it is never destroyed. So theoretically, when the capital ship is destroyed, they could have just switched back to the ground tower for their navigation.
2. Why did they need ground forces at all? Couldn't a well aimed strafe from the best pilot in the galaxy destroy BOTH of the control towers?"
