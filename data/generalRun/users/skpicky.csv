pics,feuom3g,t1_fesgu40,1579388524.0,"American nurse here.  In the hospital we use kg, milliliters, centimeters, and Celsius.  Has caused more than one issue when people mix up centimeters with inches and kg with lbs.   As in, people have gotten the wrong dosage of a medication that is prescribed by weight because the pharmacist or nurse or doctor used the wrong system.

Example: giving a dose of a medication that is 10/mg/kg.  If you're 100 kg, you get 1000mg.  If you're 100 pounds, you get 1000mg when you should get 450mg.   Double dose.  With the right medication, this can be fatal."
