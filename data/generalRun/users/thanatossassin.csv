DarK,ff68mxc,t1_ff5pv46,1579621718.0,"A few of us neighbor kids were over at his house playing Sega when it dawned on us that he had a bunk bed, but didn't have a brother. So we asked him about it and he said his parents got it for him so he could sleep on top. I told him it must be nice not having someone underneath; my brother slept on the bottom bunk and he was a dick about it, kicking from underneath and pushing up the platform all the time, and we'd get in fights and get in trouble. He replied, ""Oh I don't know, I sleep on the bottom."" 

That was seriously one of the greatest laughs I've ever had in my life. We were all dying and out of breath, and it was never a sad story for him. He had plenty of friends and honestly anytime someone spent the night, we didn't have to sleep on the floor. Hell, we got top bunk!"
