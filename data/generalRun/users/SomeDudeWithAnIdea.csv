If he didn't fit into the plan or the plan fit around him, everything goes down for them. That's why they are loyal. If it wasn't for the enormous stakes for them, Trump would already have been deposed. He was a club they used a couple times, and then it didn't work. Now, they need him to extend this to a point where they can work with a new republican. As soon as a new plan can be made that they can afford, they will jump ship. As soon as he causes more problems that the plan can withstand, they will jump ship. It's not loyalty, it's keeping the life support plugged in."

Lets call the protag ""x"" the woman ""y"" and this new guy ""z."" 

""It's unfair I (y) was changed for the worse at random. Even worse, people like him were changed for the better and only treats others like trash. Now, a 'cursed human' can't even live life without harassment, violence, disorder, because men like z go around, claiming some righteous cause. What's worse, actually good people like x not only say nothing; but actively help, encourage, and outright kills cursed for them.""

Now, if you choose not to go this route, that's fine. Go nuts, it's your story you are god of this story. Another way to go that doesn't include z is just blessed and normal people being vitriolic, hateful, even racist. Their behavior justifies her behavior, and vice versa. She can't live normally ever again, if she steps foot in a populated town, she will be killed. Go as far as Jim Crow Law like laws: I.E. police can strip search you for signs of being cursed so you can be executed, if you're found to be cursed at any point you can be shot by any responsible citizen and they will be cash rewarded, et cetera."

Piccolo (especially later in his life) has plenty of experience in training others, strategy, and mastering his Patience. He easily has the most varied attack strategy, trying to use various angles to throw opponents into a tailspin. Not to mention, if thrown into the pokemon universe as a vacuum he would be one of the first to connect together type advantages as a concept.

Now, here's the best part. Piccolo is practically the absolute best mixture of what a good trainer would need to be: observant, experienced, intelligent, and physically capable. I guarantee you he wouldn't just resort to fighting types either. He already has very good psychic abilities, thus a deep connection is possible.
