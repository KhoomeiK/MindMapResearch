bipolar,ffdmvdt,t3_esymu6,1579824261.0,"For me, the meds and the depression combined had a very similar effect. I was taking Zyprexa I basically spent Five Years on a couch sleeping and after that I could not get my s*** together. When I switch to Lamictal and started practicing DBT things got better. When I finally quit drinking and the Lamictal started working correctly it got much easier, you can so rebound on this. I cannot stress enough how horrible drinking affected my mental state, but you might not drink at all so don't take that part 2 heart if it doesn't fit. Anyhow I just wanted to say that the doctors put us through a lot of Hoops trying to dial in on the correction and maybe an adjustment needs to be made, especially if you notice such a huge difference in your capacity. Good luck my friend"

bipolar,ff4pd24,t3_erf9p6,1579569222.0,I totally get that.
bipolar,ff4p3eq,t3_erj3a7,1579569033.0,"For me I don't consider it so much as a weight as it is a handicap, like a bum knee after an accident that will never recover. I'll always walk with a limp, my other leg can get stronger oh, I could walk 2 miles a day on that good leg and nurse the bad one if I just Pace myself. It's all about self-care DBT and pigging out on ASMR tracks. For me anyway. If I don't self-care like crazy I slept backwards oh, so I set myself Google reminders to keep myself on track with a personal self-care schedule.. otherwise I can't maintain the up for more than 2 days. Anyhow, I've been taking Lamictal and Gabapentin. This has me going pretty well the Lamictal keeps the Cycles really slight and the Gabapentin gets rid of the anxiety and when I call the fear anoia. Good luck my friend holla"

bipolar,ff4oa5k,t3_erbit5,1579568460.0,"Well, quitting drinking help me sort a lot of stuff out but I can really say as far as the bipolar part goes my best success so far has been studying DBT and listening to ASMR inaudible tracks on YouTube. There is a lot of different applications for ASMR so don't be disturbed if you see weird stuff, there are some really useful people out there doing good things using ASMR stuff. Check out Charlie Swenson Ford EBT and Heather Feather for ASMR."

bipolar,ff2yy6t,t3_erav37,1579529070.0,"No, but you should try listening to ASMR tracks in languages you don't understand. You can talk back to the voices and confess any problem you have. And then just shut the whole thing down when you're done."
bipolar,ff2yuyc,t3_erdcp4,1579528992.0,100% agree with the symptoms. Is a Praxis stole years of my life. It took three months for things to get normal for me again after finally getting off all of it. Which I had to beg for with my P dog.
bipolar,ff2yt2d,t3_er14q5,1579528945.0,Consistency is the struggle for me. I can do perfectly well with self care and management for two days and then I forget to do it more. I started leaving notes for myself as reminders on my Google Calendar so I wouldn't forget to do the things I needed to do everyday. This helps a lot
bipolar,ff2ypy7,t3_er6zsk,1579528866.0,What did you shoot the photo with?
bipolar,ff2yo2e,t3_erbit5,1579528820.0,We all love you friend you are doing your best keep up the good work you'll get through it. I didn't get sorted until I quit drinking. If you Google medicine efficacy And alcohol you'll find that our meds are depleted to an efficacy of 25% when consumed with alcohol. Good luck and hold fast
