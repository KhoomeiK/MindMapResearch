Well, for what i see he needs work, and you seem like a person that you want itto do it. I think that reading and being patience you could do it. He is ok with you, so you are his person....But he need to learn not to be so crazy about you, and know he is not in danger anymore. Sometimes they don't get along with other dogs, but they could get normal that they could get along with people . 
they need exercise (if you jog or something they would be a wonderful jog buddy, or even with a bike, jrt participate in agility, with all that, because they are uber intelligent) Oh yes, The shedding, we call it JRT Glitter (you will live with that, vacuum all the time!"
dogs,few7633,t3_eqr9sk,1579406295.0,"If you want go and request to join this group  in facebook groups/221475788009945/  (jack russells)  

  there we could give you (or even you could search for old posts about advice)  I was a first dog owner when I got my jrt (it was a 3 day old dog, that need it surgery, and well i had to learn read, understand the breed)   

Even you could put this same question and we will answer, no judgement (ok probably lots would say yes stay with the dog!)  But I am very straight fwd, there is nothing wrong if you think that you are not prepared to do the job, or don't have the time (BTW most people say that JRT need a yard, that is in theory, I had 2 and lived in apartments, but they were very active because they went everywhere with me or my mother, so they were doing something all the time)  

&#x200B;

Google russell rescue (to see if you have this rescue in your city or state , they are very good and they will find a new person that could take the dog, but of course that is in case you think about it and make the decision)   Aniway if you want pm me and I could chat about it. I know the breed I love them I won't tell you is easy. But the job of having these little white dogs is AWESOME"
dogs,few56ld,t3_eqr9sk,1579405557.0,"OMG. Well if he is a JRT and a rescue, and you are first time owner. Geez , well you have the right attitude. However, I have had JRT and rescues. That is not an easy task. As a matter of fact, most of the times JRT go to rescues, with foster parents, and people that know the breed. Have you read about JRT? they are a High energy dogs. I know that you should not tell personal information. There is a group I belong in Facebook and we are JRT owners.

Sometimes could take even 90 days for a shelter dog to get to a point that trust you and so on. You have no idea about his former life. 

JRT as a 'general rule' should not be in houses with kids that are less than 6 yo, cats, or chiken. Of course there are always exceptions.  Either you try to find a rescue that would take the dog from you, and they could find a foster that can work with him, and adopters that would be good for him. the other thing is that you take and do the job readabout it and do the job. JRT are so loyal, they are wonderful dogs, but keep in mind that he is afraid and he needs work and socialization."
