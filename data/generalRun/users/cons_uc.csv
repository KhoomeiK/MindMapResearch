Hair,ffppa2a,t3_euiqbt,1580101045.0,"I also have wavy hair that I used to absolutely despise. I would straighten it every day, blow dry it after a shower, and if I let it go natural it looked like trash. Here’s what I have learned:

Heat tools are terrible for your hair no matter what you do. Even blow drying your hair does a larger amount of damage than you’d think. Wash you hair once a week at max. Condition you hair every time you wash it. Preferably brush your hair daily. Get your hair trimmed regularly if you can, that will help growth and keep split ends at bay. I’m bad about trims and I almost always have split ends but I still get compliments all the time. I also went over everything I do to my hair with a hair stylist and she informed me that everything I’m doing is probably the best you can do for your hair without expensive treatments."
succulents,ffmfxhd,t1_ffmf9v6,1580054136.0,"I’m definitely not an expert and I don’t really know, hopefully someone can help a little more. I don’t think it can hurt but I think it’s better to water from the top for these because you don’t want them sitting in and retaining moisture. If you’re waiting for the soil to get completely wet from bottom watering, they’re going to sit in that water for a while which can easily allow mold or rot or a number of other things to grow in the soil. Personally I would say that if it isn’t necessary to bottom water then don’t. Again, I hope someone corrects me if I’m wrong."
succulents,ffmd1ly,t1_ffmckpk,1580052621.0,"Don’t bottom water. Water from the top until it runs out the bottom. Mine gets indirect light all day and I water every two weeks, maybe less. Also there’s a bunch of different kinds of aloe so maybe this kind just has skinny leaves!"
succulents,ffk7c08,t1_ffjzlnr,1580018123.0,"Could also need some water. The leaves get super thin when they’re thirsty.

Edit for clarity"
vegan_travel,ffk59fx,t3_etkpn9,1580016296.0,"If you’re in Fort Lauderdale or Miami, there will definitely be vegan options aplenty. I’m about an hour north in a smaller-ish/less dense city in palm beach county and we have a decent amount of options."

unpopularopinion,ffi419s,t3_etlqxk,1579964458.0,I only ever hear mine if a room is dead silent and even then I can tune it out. I must not have very bad tinnitus because it’s never really bothered me.

houseplants,ffgk0vn,t3_ethwha,1579908011.0,"Juniper, but not sure what kind. I had a bonsai of one of these when I was younger. Super fun."
houseplants,ffgjozk,t3_ethzfu,1579907794.0,"Since you got it specifically from Lowe’s it’s probably a good idea to repot it.  I’ve found that when a plant looks really full that there sometimes is more than one plant in the pot and it’s hard to tell just looking at it while potted. They also overwater like CRAZY because they generally don’t know what they’re doing so check your roots and maybe give it some new soil. Best of luck to you and your new dream greens!

Edit: can’t read. Or type apparently."
plants,ffgj6ot,t1_ffgajur,1579907460.0,All of the “coral cactus” plants are grafted. The top I believe is a type of euphorbia and is usually this very pale greenish color with red/pink edges. The edge color shows up more with more sunlight in my experience. I can’t remember what the bottom part is.
plants,ffgiy2r,t3_eti2d5,1579907303.0,"Rotate it. The plant will grow towards the light, if you rotate it then it doesn’t get the chance to be the leaning tower of smell-good, and instead becomes the Eiffel flower. 
(I am sorry for the bad jokes)"
witchcraft,ffgirkd,t3_eti2za,1579907181.0,Nope. You can pick a chunk of asphalt off the ground and use that if it’s what speaks to you. I find it easier to use incense and candles for spells because I already had that stuff in my house. Plus Walmart has like 97 cent candles in all kinds of colors. Sometimes all I need is a piece of paper. It depends what kinda witch you aspire to be.

Stretched,fffwl3m,t3_etf20d,1579893384.0,"I used tapers to get to this size, then found this sub and learned that’s a big no-no (whoops) so I wanted to make sure they look ok. I’m getting super impatient to move up to the next size, is there anything I can do to make it go faster or do I just need to keep waiting?"
plantclinic,fffvzw0,t3_etboiw,1579893012.0,"Repot it, and then basically ignore it. Couldn't tell you the last time I watered my ZZ. Other than that, it'll pretty much deal with any other condition. They do better with more light but I think they'll tolerate lower light too."
plantclinic,ffft9j2,t1_fffpwgb,1579891309.0,If it's easy to pull it out then you can. Basically just wait until it's ready to come out on its own.
AskReddit,fffs4nc,t3_ete4w7,1579890604.0,"I was essentially a child and didn’t understand the concept of doing things for myself. Tried to break up with a guy after a year, he essentially didn’t let me, so I cheated on him for another year, then finally cut it all off. The worst part is, he was fully aware and consented to me cheating on him. It’s gross to think about and I would never do that shit again."
AskReddit,fffqr5q,t3_ete5gf,1579889759.0,"I personally believe that a fetus that is not capable of life outside the womb is not “alive,” and I also have no control over laws that are already in place. Morally speaking, it is seemingly worse (according to society standards) to kill a pregnant woman than a non-pregnant woman, so it makes sense in that regard that they are charging you with a double homicide. Does it actually make sense? No. It does not."
