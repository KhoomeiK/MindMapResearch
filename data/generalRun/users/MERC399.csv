Please review [this link ](https://www.reddit.com/r/Chameleons/comments/1k9gvx/a_word_on_heat_sources_and_burning_your_animals/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) as it covers lighting, burn recognition, and burn treatment written by the person i learned the most from."
Chameleons,ffcstss,t3_esl3en,1579806547.0,"Looks like you're using the light fixture that set up came with.. I 10/10 reccomend removing that blue light and replacing it with a 60w white Incandescent bulb. For UV lighting I reccomend either the reptisun bar lighting with a 5.0 linear bulb OR a thrive (petsmart brand) bar light with the linear ""tropical"" light.  

Also that is an adorable little friend"
Chameleons,ffcsllr,t3_esue3b,1579806412.0,u/flip69  I'm terrible at telling based on pics.
Chameleons,ffcsife,t3_esuqrg,1579806359.0,"Location and appearance tell me it's a burn. You dont really need super intense heat lamps. In fact if kept in a typical household (that's kept to human comfort temps) you can use a simple 60w incandecent frosted white light bulb (the kind you use in a lamp). It puts out a moderate heat in a more comfortable gradient. 

Are you familiar with treating injuries such as this with a cham? We can offer advice there as well or if youd like you can take it to the vet for a total checkup. Personally I recommend a bi-annual check up schedule for new owners as hands on veterinarian (the herpetologist kind) can spot any issues you yourself or even us here may miss."

Catholicism,ffc6chq,t1_ffc4dc7,1579792569.0,Theyd have to remove me. I'm not a stickler for TLM or NO preferences.. but when it comes to communion I cannot stand a) the body of christ touching unconsecrated hands (like my own) and b)  I dont think I could physically bring myself to do anything other than kneel until the tabernacle is closed.

AskAPriest,ffb7dyr,t1_ff7lfa9,1579753840.0,"You know I think some of the great doctors of the church have sat down with your exact concerns and decided to spend their lives sorting out what is historical record, what is parable, what phrases are used to represent other things, and so on.  

Your passion noted here for the way it works is clearly present, and I would suggest you may want to follow up on this book by book, and see what has been decided by church officials and why. Essentially, it sounds like the start of a spiritual understanding quest. You should follow it and see what you learn.. who knows you may learn something new that benefits the church as a whole?  

Up to you."

Chameleons,ff8wvz7,t1_ff8uki4,1579698742.0,"Mood in a sense is the majority reason. The way they change their colors is a lot like the way we flex our muscles. Whenever they're tense, they tend to be darker colors, and when they're the most relaxed, they tend to be lighter colors (for example when I clean my girls cage, she is dark green, but when shes fully asleep shes lime green). 

Other factors include hormones related to mating. Females (veilds specifically) develop some kind of marker indicating her hormones are in the right time such as golden or yellowish streaks around her body. 

Coloration/mood pairs tend to vary by species and morph but are easy to figure out with time spent working with said cham."

Chameleons,ff8b3bs,t3_es1355,1579671485.0,"Frankly, if she can build a solid stable den out of it, it should be fine. Obviously you wanna avoid anything containing herbicides, pesticides, fertilizers, etc (basically anything other than dirt). And you wanna make sure its non abrasive to her (ie no little rocks intermixed). 

To test, bring it up to operating moisture and use your hand to dig a tunnel down into it. If it holds up nice and stable, it should be fine. Some folks use plain potting soil, or dirt from outside that they trust, or some even use the coconut fiber based substrate from the pet stores.   Whatever it is, its gotta support her digging a den, spending many hours inside, and then burying her clutch without collapsing into her."

Catholicism,ff6sl8x,t1_ff6rg70,1579634016.0,"Honestly I wholeheartedly agree with you. I looked up the bishop after reading this story and he read like a solid well built man. Assuming we are correct, then we absolutely need to treat this baseless accusation as an attack on the church as a whole in an attempt to destabilize the efforts to stamp out the corrupted clergy."
Catholicism,ff6oycz,t3_erw9wr,1579631842.0,"> The Vatican has ordered an investigation of a sexual abuse allegation against Brooklyn Bishop Nicholas DiMarzio, who was previously named by Pope Francis to investigate the church's response to clergy sexual abuse in Buffalo.

If they find evidence of it... would they now have to reexamine every case DiMarzio had a hand in?"

So that means Francis does trust Scalfari and maybe the things Scalfari said are accurate after all. If Scalfari had been spreading lies, I don’t think Francis would do another interview with him.

Plausible, but personally I think hes just giving him a fair shake regardless of past issues. Perhaps something happened behind the scenes where Scalfari apologized and promised to do better, or something like that? Hopefully time will tell us"

Chameleons,ff5rdm0,t3_erp71w,1579607254.0,"Pardon automods double post. Anywho, I reccomend against anything like that unless you are highly familiar with bioactive habitats. Even then, you have to remember it does have inherent hazards such as the one stiofan mentioned and while yes they are hazards wild chams deal with regularly, they are some we can avoid in captivity. 

Also might I add that is one chunky girl. After she lays, I'd recommend setting your calendar to prepare ahead of time for her next lay and drastically reduce her intake to about 1-2 dubai roaches to reduce her egg making capabilities so her next lay is reduced thereby reducing the stress and potential for egg retention."
