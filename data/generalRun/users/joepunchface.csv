bipolarart,fehwjzz,t1_fehpxlk,1579125286.0,"There is a wonderful amount of irony in telling someone to meditate on the wrongness of their opinion when they were the one directly involved in the exchanges in question and you were not.

To clarify the points that I felt were incorrect in your assessment of the situation:

1. I was not banned after I ""kept pushing."" A mod messaged me directly in a very sassy way, as I directly quoted, I argued that maybe banning people was not the best way to inform someone of their first offense of a rule that exist in no other sub I have ever been a part of, then I was banned by another mod with no warning, no offer to change my original post, no anything. Just banned. Childish and authoritarian, as I said.

2. I did not post my picture anywhere. I linked to an external site where there happens to be a half picture of SOMEONE's face. I never said it was mine. In the time that it took for the mods to ban me, I was able to find pictures of most of their faces with a simple look at their comments in other subs. That seems incredibly hypocritical and asinine to me.

Yes, I am argumentative. Because I believe that my opinion is valid and grounded in reality.
None-the-less, all that I have gained from trying to interact with these communities is a bunch of busy bodies trying to tell other people how to live their lives and I don't have the time or the patience for that. Thus, I've deleted any posts I've made in any bipolar subs and I will find other people to connect with.

I've said it time and time again in relation to this ordeal. I did not instigate any of this and I genuinely only wish for the best for anyone struggling with any sort of mental illness, but I will not just bite my tongue and submit when I disagree with the status quo.

I extend the same well wishes to you and hope nothing but the best for you."
Mindfulness,fdyj3te,t3_endate,1578780326.0,"I'm reading it too and thought the exact same thing! To the point that I almost gave up on it, but I think I'm going to try to push through and see if the content lives up to the very pompous seeming intro."
bipolarart,fdf5svp,t3_el2c63,1578353967.0,"I think you have the hardest part down, you have really great sounding tone and a voice that has genuine emotion and is very interesting to listen to. And honestly, I don't hear a lot wrong as far a hitting notes accurately. I'd love to hear you singing along to a backing track. Not that this is bad a Capella, but I know for me personally, hearing my voice with a backing track gives me a lot more confidence than without. 

Just my useless input. I'm an objectively awful singer, but I like singing too, so I do the best with what I've got.

Keep singing and keep sharing it! Just the act of creating is wonderfully cathartic, but having the courage to put your gift out there is magical!"
YouShouldKnow,fdexzfn,t1_fdex4w1,1578348982.0,"Very good point, but for me, as a beginner, they've been helpful in developing the routine and introducing me to some of the exercises that are pretty universal.
But you are 100% correct, relying on an app is a good way to lose sight of what you're doing the mindfulness meditation for in the first place."
bipolar2,fdeuu6n,t3_el0cau,1578347069.0,"For the sake of transparency, this was my letter to their mods after being banned for violating their (in my opinion, unnecessarily authoritarian) selfie rule:

""This is the first sub I have ever been banned from in the 7 years I have been on reddit.

I find it shameful that a mental illness sub would have a zero tolerance policy. Especially when it is a mental illness where those that suffer are used to being talked to like we are children that can't handle our own lives like the fully functioning adults we are.

Furthermore, the lead up to me being banned very much seems to be based upon a mod not liking my response to their ""warning.""

If this is how this sub is going to run, I'll accept my ban happily and move on to more welcoming, loving, and understanding subs. I would hope however, that cooler heads would prevail and someone else would look over this interaction and tell me if I was, in fact, in the wrong. I have enjoyed my time here and have benefited greatly from my interactions with other sufferers. I would be quite disappointed to lose access to that support over something so benign.

My full interaction with one of the mods here:

Mod:

I have had to remove your recent post. This a completely anonymous subreddit, but the link you posted has your name, your family's names, your location, a photo of your and a child... I could go on. We can't allow that at all on here. Posting a photo/link to a photo of your face is usually a bannable offense, no warning given, but I literally had a seizure about 40 minutes ago and right now I don't want to be wandering around the house trying to go find my laptop so I'm messaging you from my phone instead. Please, don't do it again.

joepunchface:

I have posted links to my Bandcamp page multiple times and no one has ever said anything. Obviously that is not my real name and the photo in question is intentionally vague and anonymous. I think you are overreacting.

Mod:

That's probably because your other posts weren't checked and slipped through the net. Either way, rules are rules. Arguing isn't exactly going to help you.

jopunchface:

Wow. You sound like a joy. Message received. I'll stop posting in the community. I'm very disappointed, but rules are rules. I guess I'll have to see about having those rules changed to be a little more common sense.

Mod:

Thanks for such a kind message. I was trying to be nice by not banning you for something is usually a ban without warning...

I didn't say stop posting, just no more links to that site, or posts containing personal information.

As for changing the rules, that won't happen. They are there for very good reasons but if it makes you feel any better by all means message the mods. I'll reply on there telling you the exact same thing.

joepunchface:

Your dominance has been thoroughly proven. No need to belabor the point. All the best.

Ban came about 10 minutes later.

As I mentioned in that discussion, nothing on my bandcamp page is real, save Portland. A cursory search of just about anyone's comment history is usually enough to get a pretty good idea of where they live, roughly speaking, so I find it a bit asinine that I would be banned for linking to my own personal bandcamp page with that info on it. Further, my decision to reveal my town on that page is my decision to make, as an adult that is fully aware of the dangers of having personal info on the internet.

I hope you will reconsider my ban, and possibly look at your policing strategies through the lense of common sense.

If not, I wish you all the best and genuinely hope that you will continue to thrive in-spite of our shared burden.

Sincerely,

Joe Punchface""

I was later informed I was not banned by that same mod. That makes me even more disappointed in the way their sub is run, but luckily there are other places to connect with fellow bipolar folks."

YouShouldKnow,fdetd9d,t3_el0bpi,1578346195.0,"As someone that practices Mindfulness as part of how I manage my bipolar disorder, I have looked into a lot of the Mindfulness apps out there. I find it extremely shameful how some of the biggest apps are structured to be incredibly costly for the end users. Especially while they preach trying to make Mindfulness accessible and beneficial to a broad audience.

Conversely, I am absolutely delighted with Smiling Mind thus far. Their app has a lot to offer and they are a non-profit whose mission is, in my eyes, wonderfully in line with the spirit of Mindfulness."

Did it work right of the box as a midi keyboard? Just plug and play and it works well with GarageBand? Other than this arpeggiator issue?"
