EngineeringStudents,ff4qi0f,t1_ff37vqy,1579570008.0,"The test I took was computerized, so it was a computerized reference manual. Which conveniently made it searchable as well."
ElectricalEngineering,ff264pl,t3_er4v8a,1579494880.0,"One other thing you might consider is the possibility of using PWM for your speed control of the motor. If you go that route, then the device you're using will need to handle the high switching speeds."
EngineeringStudents,ff22y20,t1_ff1slcj,1579492369.0,"Rho doubling as radius in cylindrical coordinates because for some reason some authors don't want to just use 'r', and as density in literally everything pisses me off when they conflict with eachother."
ElectricalEngineering,ff1078m,t3_er1onv,1579473984.0,"Digitally controlled power converter can be fun, but I guess it'd really depend on how much the computer eng guy is into control.   


Also, not a direct answer, but as an idea if all parties are willing, if the project leans heavily in one direction, have the person who is less of a technical expert in that area focus their work contribution towards administrative stuff. It's not glamorous, but it is important and challenging work all the same."
EngineeringStudents,ff0lbo8,t1_ff0c77t,1579469928.0,"The TI-36X Pro was allowed for my FE exam, and while it isn't anywhere near as powerful as the TI-89, I can still compute definite integrals with it."
Automate,feufw29,t1_fet5f15,1579386108.0,"I think that early adopters of automation still have better defined frameworks for what they do and don't need from the automation and its limitations. To go back to your PC example, which I like by the way, early adopters were still in a better position to continue advancing with the newer more standardized technology. It still takes some knowhow to be able to implement the better stuff smoothly, and some experience to know what you're really going to be ending up with."
incremental_games,fes977h,t1_fep23y8,1579362787.0,"I do, and while some of the meta-posts I find questionable, when it comes to actually voting on links to games, there is strong correlation between votes and quality."
summonerschool,feo7aon,t1_fenic73,1579296093.0,"Tactically easy, but strategically, using Garen roam to the best advantage I doubt that most people get anywhere near 100%."
Classical_Liberals,feo713e,t1_fenunmq,1579295934.0,"Yes. There's already implicit acceptance for a lot of the socialist and welfarist programs already put up by the Democratic Party. ""Good parts of Obamacare"", among other things... At this point it's just a matter of getting upset if some immigrant is the beneficiary of some government program rather than being upset about the program itself. The ultra-nationalism, the favoritism with various industries/businesses, all at the price of limited government and individual liberty. Tell me fascism is not the road that the GOP is headed down."

Classical_Liberals,fenuefn,t3_eq0ocw,1579290913.0,"At this point, I think there's more hopes for the Center-Left of the Democratic Party to form the base of a classical liberal coalition.  


As other commentators have noted here, the Republican Party is doubling down on ultra-nationalist borderline-fascist ideology. They'll have to start losing lots more elections before they reconsider.  


The Democrats are still flirting with European-style Socialism, but I'm confident that they're more radical adherents will not gain significant political traction and that the Democrats will be the first to realize that appealing to the moderates/center will be the strategy for political success."
btd6,felb3ky,t1_fel0wf2,1579218026.0,"There are two ways to pop leads on this challenge to my knowledge. The Monkey Intelligence Bureau upgrade on Monkey Village and a sufficiently leveled Quincy has explosive arrows. Leveling Quincy is probably the easier approach of those two, and the one that I took.

It's possible that all the Monkey Knowledge upgrades for heroes makes leveling Quincy faster even more trivially easy.  


Edit: And I'm honestly lost on which versions of Bloons that Super Monkeys can pop leads with which upgrades. I don't know if this version has any."
incremental_games,fehcpqg,t1_fef2v9h,1579113856.0,"For what it's worth, I strongly agree with you and also hold the strict definition of incremental game.  


That said, the incrementalism is strong in Gemcraft, and also just due to the strong adjacent development between tower defense and incrementals as web games, the overlap is so huge that I would expect incremental games players to be big fans of Gemcraft."
EngineeringStudents,fegdduh,t1_fee37xg,1579088690.0,"As much as I'm hearing that story, I feel heavily validated in being a lazy sack through high school."
incremental_games,fee2s1o,t1_fecxve6,1579025203.0,"You're missing the point of my reply. Changing how people post on this subreddit doesn't create more games. If anything, it results in fewer games."
summonerschool,febuky0,t1_fe7xxv0,1578962891.0,"Those people are idiots, even by meta-slave standards. Volibear is a solid A-tier pick. They shouldn't be fussing until at least B-tier and probably even C-tier."
summonerschool,feboyxp,t1_fe9bm12,1578961151.0,"If I'm playing any character with Manaflow band, and am reasonably confident that I can use distance or cover to protect myself from the counter-attack, you bet that I'll cheese the tri-bush to get that first stack for free, even against comps that have a much stronger level 1.  


Edit: Less meaningful but still worth mentioning: a spellthief's edge proc can be had too."
summonerschool,febnfu7,t1_fe8wfto,1578960662.0,"Warding the bush itself is almost always a waste, but warding the stream showing entry into the bush just before buff spawns isn't.  


Primarily, it gives an opportunity to poke the enemy bot if they do choose to be cheeky with the tri-bush. But secondarily, it lasts long enough to provide a reasonable amount of coverage should the enemy jungler attempt an early gank on bot."
incremental_games,feb4zhu,t1_fe4xdmn,1578955464.0,"This has everything to do with the quality of games available and has nothing to do with the posting habits of people on this subreddit.  


Very few people have the chops, dedication, and time available to make a complete quality game. So, newbie game developers making their first incremental, chances are it's gonna be crap, but sometimes the feedback they get can help them rework their original idea, or go into a second game that they make. In rare cases, they may even move on to making one of those quality games. That's what we have to gain when new developers post their crap.  


And what's the alternative? Fewer people posting new games? What's the upside to that?  


I think upvoting and downvoting moderates the sub well enough in that regard. Valueless trash gets downvoted to the bottom, stuff with potential gets upvoted and healthy discussion."
Foodforthought,fdqpfg3,t1_fdq2dlw,1578672033.0,"Yeah, all those different low skill jobs have their tradeoffs. Custodial is messy, construction is tough, but both give a lot more breathing room away from management."
incremental_games,fdhp4uo,t3_eimgh5,1578427358.0,"I really enjoy the unfolding of the research tree, but literally everything else in the game is bland as can be.  


The tower defense portion just doesn't have the level of interactivity to hold any serious interest. I'm not sure if production buildings ever reach a point where they provide anywhere near the amount of resource income you get from the tower defense portion. The Masonry building is basically mini-cookie clicker."
RocketValleyTycoon,fdhnzwf,t1_f9rr1no,1578426684.0,"That's a very optimal build you got going there. My Mars build was hella sprawled. I probably averaged maybe \~10% resource utilization per zone, since I was constantly burning keys as soon as I got them so I could continue to rope in city rewards. I only started to really jam pack everything in some areas when it came to the ridiculousness that is methanol production. I feel like even reasonably optimized, you can't avoid dedicating an absurd amount of trains solely for methanol production and transport."
btd6,fdggbol,t1_fdg8r4b,1578395522.0,"I see absolutely nothing wrong with forcing expensive heroes. A well crafted DC should even encourage the use of uncommonly used heroes to maximize novelty. And most importantly, all DC's should be easy enough to complete without MK or the use of any heroes."
slatestarcodex,fd0glln,t3_ejs7mq,1578118492.0,There are some words I misspell that I wouldn't even notice if I didn't have a spellchecker constantly reminding me that I do. Indestructable(sic) is one such example that I feel I'd have gotten away with a lot longer otherwise.
slatestarcodex,fcyk6ly,t1_fcxv6rn,1578081483.0,"Eh, one can regularly try-hard with a lesser raw cognitive capability and easily come out well above the average redditor who has probably never tried hard at anything in their life.  


I'm reminded of a general education English course that I took in college, and in peer reviewing papers I sawthat some of the international students who didn't learn English in their childhood still outperformed some of our American peers, simply on the basis that said Americans were lazy sacks who knew that they didn't need to perform better. I'm reasonably convinced that raw intelligence was not the primary differentiating factor, either."
FreeSpeech,fcvlisw,t1_fcvbmsp,1578004676.0,It's less a federal issue than a state/municipal issue.

slatestarcodex,fcviltu,t1_fcka4ai,1578002868.0,"I think the biggest difference is between people who are already intimately familiar with the subject matter (either from doing earlier surveys or just being familiar with Scott Alexander's style) and can understand precisely the questions and answers with only skimming, and those who aren't."
slatestarcodex,fcvi7yh,t1_fcnxy6o,1578002631.0,"I think part of the confusion is that most people with CS degrees don't actually perform computer science, they just heavily apply it. For whatever reason, they lack the distinction that science and engineering have, although they have divided out their technician equivalency well enough."
slatestarcodex,fcvhomk,t1_fcmauxw,1578002304.0,I'm one of those in between weirdos who starts to see it but lacks the mental focus to maintain a coherent image. So it flickers a lot as I'm trying to switch my focus between the shape detail and the color detail.
college,fcn07eu,t3_ei1qt5,1577799391.0,"My freshman year, I could only take very few classes associated with my program because of a lot of stuff being heavily gated by math and science prerequisites, so knocking out some gen ed courses was a no-brainer.  


That said, my sophomore and junior years, that was no longer a problem, and I took classes exclusively devoted to my major, making for a really chill senior year with 3 gen ed classes which was important since it left me more time to 1) devote to my senior project and 2) start sending out job applications."
starsector,fcmpuj6,t1_fcm1hqs,1577786284.0,">It can be hard to use because of its low flux stats - you pretty much have to find a good time to vent in the middle of the fight.

This is where multi-ship maneuvers shine. Mobile, high flux, low flux-cost shielded ships to fly in and tank while the Onslaught vents, and ideally swoop back out before they're overwhelmed are a good way of handling this. The Apogee is perfect for this role, and it even has an Active Flare Launcher to keep dangerous missiles away."
electricians,fcm81eh,t3_ehnzgx,1577766688.0,"Other people have said what to study, but as for where, [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/) is the best free online resource available for learning/practicing/mastering arithmetic and basic algebra."

Foodforthought,fckt93f,t3_ehmcg3,1577732695.0,"Investing in education was a lot more promising before the Department of Education popped into existence and made everything associated with American schooling gradually worse.  


Abolish the Department of Education, recognize that Betsy Devos and nobody else for that matter should be in charge of all schooling in the US. Bring back local civic pride in one's schools."
ElectricalEngineering,fcj2b6j,t1_fc9becl,1577675513.0,"The intro was just dealing with gain equations and basic amplifiers, followed by op amps although a lot of that was quick review from concepts learned in circuits.

Second section was semiconductor theory with a whole mess of equations associated with stuff like carrier concentration, diffusion/drift currents, p-n junction stuff.

Third section was the various models for diodes, MOSFETs, and BJTs under different conditions. My professor personally liked to test this knowledge with questions involving the overall circuit behavior of circuits with the devices placed inside of them, but I don't know how common that inclination is.  


The math was almost entirely algebra, but with a messy pile of equations. The occasional derivative/anti-derivative, commonly best handled as s or 1/s in the s-domain. I didn't really need to compute Laplace transforms directly, as much as just understanding how certain electrical components are modeled in the time, frequency, and s domains and smoothly transition between them."

navy,fc8i1p7,t3_egnbsl,1577535358.0,"I had to spend a couple extra weeks in bootcamp because of those fuckers.  


I developed gigantic blisters on the backs of my ankles, and I was showing up to sick call nearly every other day, just constantly getting corpsman dishing out the standard ""blister pack"", sometimes the occasional LLD chit, and then sending me on my way. After about \~3-4 weeks of that routine, one corpsman finally realizes ""I should probably have a doctor take a look at this"" as he sees the literally golfball sized blisters on the backs of my ankles.  


The doctor actually chewed me out with ""why didn't you come to us sooner with this?!"" I got set up to be sent to a hospital off base so they could operate on the blisters. There were no duty drivers available at the time to send me, so they no shit called an ambulance for me. That's a pretty embarassing ambulance ride. But it finally got taken care of, and I got put in the broke people division for a while to heal back up.  


When I got back on base, somebody, I don't know what their position was (maybe even civilian?) gave me these corkboard heel inserts that were supposed to help mitigate future damage. The RDCs in my original division sympathized: they were aware that if I had just been allowed to give my feet a salt bath on occasion, my feet probably would have never gotten too bad.  


When I arrived at A school after graduation, my very first purchase was a large tupperware container and salt, and man was the sensation godly. Guess who volunteered for submarine duty after that whole experience?"
