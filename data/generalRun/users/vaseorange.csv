family,fe3g66f,t3_enhby5,1578848991.0,Your mom should stop because she knows you are uncomfortable with it. As a mother of three I have touched my daughters butts (never breast). One of my daughters hates it so I don't do it to her. The other daughter doesn't care and laughs but after this post I think I will stop. I have never touched my son's butt.

family,fdp3yhv,t3_em2mht,1578619436.0,For my children it was a test given in elementary school. Being gifted doesn't excuse a child from having good behavior. Sound like his parents are looking for excuses rather than dealing with underlying issues. When two of my children were tested gifted the principal said to me....I have good news and bad news for you. Good news your child is gifted...bad news your child is gifted.
