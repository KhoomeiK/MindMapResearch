AskReddit,ffbk177,t3_esbsrj,1579768986.0,"""Just ignore the bullies. They will eventually stop""

No. They won't. Nobody would stop bullying someone who doesn't stand up for themselves. It's weak. People bully the weak. That's the rule. If you show them that you don't stand up for themselves, it makes them want to bully you more"

offmychest,feeeibi,t1_feee6gt,1579032103.0,might be just feeling too attacked to read into this properly. but i just cant stand hearing shit like this
offmychest,feee9u2,t1_feddh3b,1579031966.0,stop being so damn ignorate to how other people cope just because you dont cope the same way
offmychest,feee6gt,t3_eog7oh,1579031910.0,"then simply just dont interact with those people? my sister also had a tough childhood and she has similar mindset, used to tell me that she hates pessimistic people. its her way of coping. some of her good friends told her ""look. most of them have depression and hate their life"" and she understood she was wrong thinking like this 

i understand her way of thinking. surely, being raised like shit shouldnt stop you from living your live. its only a few years from the decades you have to live. however, those few years can mess up your brain, make you feel like shit. you would know, actually, you SHOULD know how terrible that feels. 

not every person has your mental strength, being told (especially from someone who also went through a shit childhood) feels dismissive and devaluating. *you cant stand living because everything reminds you of how powerless you were in life a few years ago? well. you are a damn loser!* <- it feels like this. you may not mean it that way, but surely many people here feel so. you have no right to tell other people on how to live their life. if they cant flick themselves together, thats where they stand. they need help. thats all it is."

It gives people other choices to say other than ""stop crying"". It's a good step to the better direction, other than the offensive one that nobody wants to hear when they're sad."
