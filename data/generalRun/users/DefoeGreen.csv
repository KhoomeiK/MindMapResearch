Teachers,fdwbhun,t3_en5mrr,1578757028.0,Like others have said focusing on the big picture helps getting through paper grading in terms of comments. As far as grammar goes I always stick to 1 or 2 types of errors throughout the essay. Too many corrections and I think it freaks out the kid and then your work doesn't mean much. Also most if not all of us don't get paid enough to go through and correct every single grammatical error.
aww,fdju4dg,t1_fdja765,1578487555.0,"Lol, sorry. I rushed the post cause I realized it was only a couple of hours old and actually had a shot at some visibility. Ironically, I teach high school English."
aww,fdjtyhn,t1_fdj8lbl,1578487397.0,"My fiance has  Spina bifida and can't really use her legs well below the knee. She'd love to learn how to swim but her disability disallows it. I try to take her to a bunch of physical activity stuff like rock climbing, ice skating, and bicycling just to show she can do some of those things."
aww,fdixnsw,t3_elkcgh,1578453388.0,I had a similar experience with an Air BnB host dog in Pennsylvania. The dog followed us everywhere and guided us to the local pond that we got clearance to swim in. I pushed myself swimming across the pond and triggered what I think was an onset asthma attack. I started panicking but suddenly the dog was under me and I found my second wind. I really do think that dog saved my life since my fiance can't swim and could only watch. It's almost as if they're there to make sure the guests don't die or get lost. Wonderful creatures.
asianamerican,fd3be98,t3_ejrr48,1578156597.0,"My fiance whose from the Phillipines and speaks fluent taglog says that it has a lot to due with subconscious self hate of being asian and the desire to be white. After meeting her family and being the the Phillipines multiple times I can see why she says that. 

Speaking from a Chinese person who wasn't taught Chinese as a kid from my immigrant folks from Hong Kong was that we didn't live in an asian neighborhood and they thought it might get in the way of my education which I was struggling with at a very young age. So a lack of obstacles and overall lack of necessity. Might apply to this situation."
AskMen,fcxsn5m,t3_ejhq4r,1578069906.0,"If my wife lets me, probably volunteer. I know many of my high school seniors will be drafted and I can't help but think I should be there besides them or other scared kids like them. Someone's gotta make sure they get out alright."
education,fcit9ee,t3_ehcha4,1577669269.0,"Well chances are if they're functionally illiterate they probably have some sort of learning disability or some other major issue that prevents them actually learning without struggling immensely. Could be undiagnosed disability or even a matter of a language barrier. It's difficult to call without any real info. 

While being unable to read makes it extremely difficult or impossible to be employed in some jobs it doesn't stop them getting jobs once they've learned to cope with it.

Example: I taught a 10th grader who could not read above a 3rd grade level, but possessed pretty sharp analytical skills. He learned simply to have others read things for him as stated in his IEP or use a text to voice app on his phone. He will be able to find a job, albeit with some difficulty, but it doesn't mean he doesn't deserve a diploma because he's highly unlikely to be able to read beyond 3rd grade."
