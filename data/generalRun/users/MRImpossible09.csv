Who cares, he paid for it, it was his milk, and these chicks decided to just drink it. Both parties were pretty human avout it, no one raised their voice. It's not thay it's chocolate milk, it's thay they thought it was fine to take someone's stuff from their fridge and just drink it. When you're invited to the party, some basic respect for the hosts house and belongings are always expected.

bloodborne,ffdnzrp,t3_esq11a,1579824939.0,"I would love a story sequel. I have the idea that it could either be a prequel (similar to previous comments) or a sequel, set a few decades in the future (think 1870s-1900) that is either set in Yharnam again with different great ones appearing or another location that is replicating what Yharnam tried (and while was more successful and that has led to more weapons, powers, etc it also means different and more powerful enemies because they still failed). The hunters have been recently revived and while their is no hunters dream, you are first tasked at the beginning of the game to figure out how to get to this hunters dream. Sounds pretty normal, right? Theirs a catch though. If the secret ending from BB1 is to be believed, then since the Hunter you played as in BB1 is now a great one, he recognises you are a hunter like he once was, and he wishes to aid you. This could be taking the form of an ally that you can meet a few times (someone like Solaire, who everyone recognises and loves) or he uses his powers to teleport you or guide you to other locations. Idk, I haven't really brainstormed the whole idea n the great one old Hunter could also be the last boss called ""the last Hunter"" (like a previous comment has said) so, idk. I love the idea of a BB sequel though, because there is a loy of ways the game can continue"
