I wanted to slap that fucker and tell him I've done more in the last 12 hrs than he will do all week. I settled for ""oh I work nights"""

When asked how that even works the response was that they poked a hole in the side and drained it then drank that. All in effort to stave off DTs. When asked why they didnt just go get some booze, responded ""its sunday"""
nursing,feh6cja,t3_eoz2jr,1579110071.0,"i used to work in kitchens, ive dated sooo many waitresses. but that was in a restaurant, its such a different environment than healthcare. i cant even explain how boring healthcare workers are in comparison, thats not a dig, but maybe age-related more than anything. kids kind of fall into restaurant work in a time where everything is a good idea and the rules dont matter. with healthcare, you have to mean it and have a plan. but yeah, i lost a job once cause of my philandering...

todayilearned,fclut15,t1_fclc341,1577756989.0,"Nurse here; burns are really fucked. They cause an inflammatory response that can get confused and then become systemic, even in a localized burn. Your fluids drain out of your blood vessels because of the inflammation chemicals then it's a thing called ""3rd spacing"" where you have low vascular volume and hence shitty circulation and organ perfusion, causing your heart and lungs to have to try and compensate by working harder. Meanwhile all that fluid is between your cells, not inside the cells and not inside the circulatory vessels, so you swell up like a balloon, which can actually pinch shut the arteries which are already compromised. Then you get the equivalent of like frostbite where tissue dies. It's a hot fucking mess. The really crazy part, and this is relevant to the post, is that it's a delayed reaction. That inflammation is like 18-24 hours after the initial insult, which is why this dude died, asymptomatic at the clinic because it was later that the swelling would take place. Again, its fucked"
