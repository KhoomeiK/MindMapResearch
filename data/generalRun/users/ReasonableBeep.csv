Yeah those only validate the train passes, not the busses. Obviously I get stopped and I knew there was no way I’m not gonna get a fine since I read that tourists do this often so they don’t buy it anymore.

They ripped off the bag, grabbed her by the hair, and started sawing at her neck. She didn’t seem to be making any sound cause she never opened her mouth but it was also on silent so I don’t know. I tried closing my tab but you know how sometimes your computer freezes but the video keeps playing until it closes completely? I ended up watching these men basically hold up her head like Medusa before it finally got off my screen. I’ve never seen so much blood before but somehow I don’t think I was traumatized by definition, it was shocking yes but I forgot about it until now. I’m pretty sure I was in shock cause I couldn’t get myself to physically get away from the sight but I’m definitely more careful cautious about what I look for online."

Iâ€™m getting off the bus thinking â€œIâ€™m such a good tourist, I validated my 7 day pass 5 days ago at the train station in termini cause thatâ€™s where the guides told me to validate itâ€. Yeah those only validate the train passes, not the busses. Obviously I get stopped and I knew there was no way Iâ€™m not gonna get a fine since I read that tourists do this often so they donâ€™t buy it anymore. Im about to cry but then they realized that the ticket validation machine on that particular bus was broken so they just let me go. I think it also helped that I was a solo little 19 year old Asian girl who looked 15. Looking back gives me chills though, I was really out there taking the bus for 5 whole days without a validated pass."

AskReddit,fej2dw1,t3_ep9ur1,1579154353.0,"Iâ€™m late but I have the memory of an ISIS beheading burned into my memory. I think I was like 15 and came across a viral video on Facebook of all places. There were like 5 men with their faces covered, all holding huge automatic guns and they had a women kneeling between them with a black cloth bag on her head. They ripped off the bag, grabbed her by the hair, and started sawing at her neck. She didnâ€™t seem to be making any sound cause she never opened her mouth but it was also on silent so I donâ€™t know. I tried closing my tab but you know how sometimes your computer freezes but the video keeps playing until it closes completely? I ended up watching these men basically hold up her head like Medusa before it finally got off my screen. Iâ€™ve never seen so much blood before but somehow I donâ€™t think I was traumatized by definition, it was shocking yes but I forgot about it until now. Iâ€™m pretty sure I was in shock cause I couldnâ€™t get myself to physically get away from the sight but Iâ€™m definitely more careful cautious about what I look for online."

The data they collect can provide genetic information, and maybe Iâ€™m in the minority but frankly I donâ€™t think Iâ€™d be too concerned with what they would do with it. There is so much research out there that can be done with the genetic database 23andme provides that would otherwise be unavailable to studies due to the sheer amount of data they would need. Is it that people just feel like theyâ€™re being cheated out of profit coming from the use of their data?"

AmItheAsshole,fdi49go,t3_elbslx,1578435462.0,"NTA Idk if Iâ€™m being biased by adding details that may not be there but it seems like OP and their family have given this kid more support than most people would receive with this behaviour. The kid clearly needs some tough love. Having a learning disability does not make every person a dependent cripple, And judging by how OP gave the kid choices â€œgo to college or workâ€ shows that heâ€™s probably capable of both. Iâ€™m betting that OP would have financially supported the college decision too since theyâ€™ve got the financial means to. At 20 the son is now an adult and that means youâ€™ve got to act that way, he needs to understand he is not a trust fund baby and will not be treated like so. His mother not receiving rent may have been her own decision but the fact that they canâ€™t have alcohol in the house without him touching it shows that he probably wonâ€™t  have the self control to handle himself at his own wedding, where he wants copious amounts of it."
