Until I flip a switch and flip a solenoid to send the exhaust to a second pair of pipes hidden under the skirts that are unmuffled and have full flow the switch also adjusts the air fuel ratio to avoid pre ignition and and other misfiring issues. I put street racers to shame, I have a supercharger and a performance intake manifold. You’d never know by looking at the car on the outside because it looks the same as all the rest"

politics,feijqtf,t1_feiiyuy,1579140132.0,That right there. You’re one of the reasons this world doesn’t communicate. Maybe free speech is good. But who wants to start conflict. Maybe freedom of religion is good. But who wants another dark age. Maybe freedom of the press is good. But who wants more slander and defamation. Open up your eyes and see the state of the world. I don’t give a fuck if you don’t give a fuck. You’re just an insignificant blip in the vast amounts of people complaining about their “misfortune” in the form of not giving a fuck
