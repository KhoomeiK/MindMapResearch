> This is Reddit.  People expect you to defend your claims.

Except I didn’t make the claim smart guy. The other guy made a claim, it’s up to *him* to defend it. Maybe learn how basic argumentation works."
worldnews,feog4wv,t1_feobmkl,1579299621.0,"I don’t need to defend against a stupid, talking point strawman. If I say “socialism is about stealing other people’s stuff” nobody would expect you to try to seriously defend such a stupid, reductionist statement."

Music,fe8wp6m,t1_fe79zae,1578931915.0,"Wasn’t criticizing anything my guy. I was responding to someone saying you need ridiculous timing to be able to loop like that. You for sure need good timing to be a great musician like he is, but the looping aspect can be learned relatively easily. That’s all I was responding to."
Music,fe4m8id,t1_fe4ixpu,1578860795.0,Huh?
Music,fe4m635,t1_fe4k1fj,1578860772.0,"Oh for sure. It definitely takes a lot of practice and skill to do everything on the fly like that. I was just commenting that he’s not hitting the loopers buttons perfectly on time, because of the quantization. But he’s definitely extremely skilled and talented."
Music,fe4evqp,t1_fe4dd9p,1578858543.0,"Not really, all the loops are automatically quantized. That’s why you can see him hit start/stop on a loop at the beginning of the measure, and it won’t kick in/stop until the beginning of the next measure."

Libertarian,fc78n3a,t1_fc77wjx,1577500442.0,"It absolutely is. We are biological creatures. We are social creatures. Our biology affects our behavior, including our social interactions. 

Nobody that thinks she’s that much more merited. Kylie Jenner has millions more demand than poor Americans. She is what people want and spend their money on. It’s literally democratization of the consumer."
Libertarian,fc75xxm,t1_fc7481r,1577498420.0,"And there’s plenty of people who support the ability and opportunity to own private property, preferring it to the alternative, despite some of the inherent issues it may cause. 

Inequality in and of itself is meaningless. It’s biological. What we should be concerned about is how to increase standard of living for everyone. That’s the inherent flaw in communal-style property systems."

And this is where far leftists lose the plot. As choosing which job you work at is equal to choosing a “master” to serve."

> which has never helped do anything except raise homicide, suicide, and violent crime rates. But you call that freedom.

You seem to be ill-informed. I’d do a little research if I were you."
todayilearned,fc6vmfr,t1_fc6qbyh,1577490652.0,Freedom is a good in and of itself. It has nothing to do with nationalism. Quite the opposite actually.

todayilearned,fc6f9ra,t1_fc6cyih,1577479192.0,Ah I see. In that case yes you’re right.
todayilearned,fc6adap,t1_fc69b8r,1577475948.0,And? There is still a major difference between putting restrictions on the government and putting restrictions on the people *by* the government.
todayilearned,fc6a8ug,t1_fc69e9z,1577475865.0,You can acquire guns in Japan. They are not completely banned.
todayilearned,fc68lv3,t1_fc66615,1577474782.0,"Huh? He said ban, not place restrictions. I don’t know of any countries where guns in general are outright banned. 

But that’s not the point anyways. One is placing restrictions on the government, the other is placing restrictions on citizens. They are not comparable whatsoever."
todayilearned,fc65ai8,t1_fc64ef4,1577472597.0,"The difference is the right to arms is a right of the people. The government as an entity has no rights. The government is *granted* power by the people. If they screw up, we have the right to change their operations."

*non-violent* drug offenders. Just thought I’d add to show exactly how wrong that guy is and how broken the system is at the moment."
todayilearned,fc62mag,t1_fc616do,1577470865.0,"Nope. Execution statistics for innocents are around the 4% level. So no, there’s not a “thousand psychopaths” executed for every one innocent person executed. Your bloodlust does nothing for true justice within the system."
