AskWomen,ffdf2sr,t3_esod02,1579819534.0,"Not a bad experience, but definitely a weird one: I went to get my IUD checked after I got it put in, and got scheduled with a doctor I don't usually see.

As I'm sitting pantsless on the table, he comes in *without knocking*, aggressively gestures for a handshake, and says ""Hi, I'm (insert name I've since forgotten)."" He ended up giving me an ultrasound tour of my lower abdomen, and kept commenting on how full my bladder was. After like ten minutes of this i finally had to ask him to wrap it up so I could empty said bladder.

Overall it was pretty harmless, but it made me feel a little weirded out for the rest of the day. IUD was fine, by the way."

tifu,ff3kkl4,t3_er6ia8,1579543023.0,"Something kinda similar happened to me at an old job. I was the tailor at a police uniform store, and one night I was working on a shirt, as one does. I put my hand into the sleeve to turn it inside out, and ended up pulling out a spider web. I was definitely grossed out, but didn't think much of it until about an hour later when I felt a tickle on my neck. I went to scratch it and ended up making contact with a MASSIVE black widow spider.

I chucked that fucker onto my desk, asked my manager to kill it, and got the fuck out of dodge."
