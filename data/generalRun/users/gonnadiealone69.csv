Perhaps if you focus on finding just one friend you can be yourself around, you’ll slowly learn how to seek out what you want. I don’t believe you’re single because you’re not capable of finding a girlfriend, I think you’re single because you haven’t found one you want yet. 

Being able to sort through potential options, identifying people for what they are right away, is something you can learn by getting to know many people. 

You don’t have to make friends or exchange information with anyone, just go out of your way to professionally and casually talk to as many people as you see in a day. Eventually you’ll be able to see patterns of who is who, and you might be able to find what you’re looking for a bit easier with that kind of experience under your belt. 

Now, I could be wrong, I’m just a stranger on the internet. But I’ve successfully been able to identify which strangers I can use a holocaust joke on from practicing like I mentioned."

You can integrate your professional skills into your personal life, it takes time to get it right but that’s exactly what I did and it worked out just fine. It took a year or two, but I was able to apply professionally learned social skills in my personal life just the same. Don’t get me wrong, I’m not perfect at finding the line. Most of my friends don’t know the extent of my true personality due to how polite and on queue I am with them. But I’ll take feeling a little lonely over being extremely lonely. 

It’s good that you volunteer at a museum, that’s an excellent and fun way to improve yourself. See? You’re headed on the right path, you just have to be patient.

TrueOffMyChest,fdgo7so,t3_elbeyw,1578403789.0,"Wanna know a secret? 50% of the people who walk into my salon are men.

They read our men’s fashion magazines and actually pick out things they want to wear, and they talk about their Kohl’s cash. All of these men, except for maybe two, are straight. 

Whether men are willing to admit it or not, they take extreme measures to ensure they’re a cut above the rest. Since no one is willing to admit this, it makes men who don’t do these things wonder why they can’t naturally look like that. 

As far as your job situation, that can easily be fixed. For now, I’d say take a part time job serving to build up your social skills. You wouldn’t believe how much you can learn about saying the right things when your tip depends on it.

There’s nothing wrong with having standards or wanting the potential mother of your children to lead a healthy and productive lifestyle. 

Whether these people are willing to admit it or not, they too have unarguable standards that are make or break for them. Society today is so focused on being “politically correct” that they are refusing to address the mental and physical problems associated with being overweight. Apply the same concept to what they want or don’t want out of a partner to obesity and apparently it’s a crime. 

Her health and lack of mental fortitude affects your lifestyle, your happiness, hers, your future children, and so on. In my opinion, you’d be a terrible fiancé if you didn’t bring up these concerns. 

People who are willing to let somebody cut 20 years off of their life and teach their children to do the same just to be “politically correct” or “accepting” aren’t the helpful saints they think they are. 

If she is unwilling to take care of herself, then you should leave her. She will only continue to do the opposite of what you suggest if you stay with the same mindset, which you have every right to have. 

Before I get attacked, there’s no excuse, take it from somebody who used to be morbidly obese with nothing but excuses due to the way I was raised and lack of self-will. I’ve maintained a diet for years, and when I was initially losing weight I went to the gym 3 times a day everyday until I was healthy enough to resume work. Since then I’ve battled Multiple Myeloma, birth control reactions, depression, and stress while still maintaining my weight because I’m aware that my health is the most important factor in my life.  

You deserve somebody who is willing to put in the same effort as you are. There are billions of people who are, unfortunately, the ones who aren’t are the loudest, making the ones who do difficult to find."
