And as other people point out, if you have a genuine emergency that can't wait you're going to get bumped to the front of the line. So if say a gunshot victim shows up, he's not going to wait 11hrs behind someone with a sore back.

Clinics have more and more started to turn people away very early in the morning because they're at capacity for the day. The problem isn't really people going to the ER that don't need to, the problem is the entire system is overwhelmed, under funded and under staffed. This is a systemic problem with healthcare."

For every hostile, nerd raging user that just nitpicks for the sake of it, there's another user that dismisses every single criticism as nitpicky nerd rage.

There are users here who genuinely don't like certain aspects of the newer Trek content. But when they articulate that, no matter how civil and thought out, they're dismissed as nitpicky basement dwellers. A term OP uses in this very thread. Is that not hateful and divisive?

For example, there's a lot of things I don't like about Discovery though I enjoy the show overall. I don't feel comfortable discussing those things though because it brings nothing but hostility and dismissal of my opinions. Somehow this is acceptable on this sub.

Then you get posts like this. OP has basically lumped anyone who isn't head over heels in love with the new content as ""comic book guy stereotypes"" and doesn't get called out for it.

If I were to start a post about how some users are blind fanboys I'd be downvoted into oblivion, if the post wasn't removed outright.

There's extremes on both sides, but the general consensus around here seems to be that only the people that voice criticism are in the wrong. And the mods seem to not only allow that attitude, but support it.

The major one is that it was clear the Dominion wasn't going to stop with just the Federation. They wanted to subjugate everyone. From the little we know about the Tholians that same desire seems unlikely.

Next, the episode makes it clear that what Sisko did WASN'T alright. He's clearly disgusted with himself, and he admits several times in his monologues that he's committed some major crimes.

And I think the big difference here is a fundamental difference in cultures. The federation is limited in it's actions by the prime directive. As far as we know the Romulans have no such provision, so from their point of view the morality of the situation is entirely different.
