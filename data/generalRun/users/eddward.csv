Not being lapdogs (which is untrue, it depends on the dog) is a lot different than going up to a dog and laying on it. 

And when they don‚Äôt want cuddles, you shouldn‚Äôt give them is true regardless of breed. 

So, you‚Äôre kinda going back and forth across some statements and then agreeing with me.  That  you have to base it not on the breed, but the dog and how it‚Äôs acting.
