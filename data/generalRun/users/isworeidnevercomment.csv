AnimalsBeingBros,ffck5be,t1_ffbceyq,1579801179.0,That’s why we always have more than one dog. They can keep each other company whenever we go out.

Other cultures have very different relationships with animals than we do. It makes me sad in a lot of circumstances but this guy looks like he has it ok."
AnimalsBeingBros,ffbauby,t1_ffb1q3t,1579757850.0,"Scroll up. I agree a home would be our standard and I would take him in a minute. But it’s not how it’s done there, instead, the entire community takes care of him. He gets fed, washed, and loved. By their standards, he is very lucky."

If you’re doing the same things (or going to school) then neither are you. If you’re not, then I can see why she would be concerned about you."

boulder,feer9wr,t1_feeoa70,1579039519.0,"No, a lot of people do not. The pay and lack of respect means we are seeing fewer teachers. Combine that with all those who try it for a few years then realize they can’t make a living and quit, and there is an absolute crisis in terms of number of qualified teachers. I truly do not understand folks who do not want to pay for education. I don’t have a small child but I’ll pay my share because I don’t want to live in a society full of idiots."
