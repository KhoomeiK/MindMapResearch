PublicFreakout,feyxvz1,t1_fexr7am,1579451788.0,">They're going to be by far the most important metric for understanding driver quality. What else matters if people aren't dying or getting hurt?

County A is poor and generally has cheap, unsafe cars in the road.

Country B is rich and has the safest vehicles available.

They both have the exact same number of accidents. Twice as many people die in country A.

See how flawed that is? Correlation does not equal causation. There could be war in a country affects those numbers. And surprise surprise, the darkest countries on that map are in the middle of national conflicts! Unless you went out there and collected the data yourself, you have no clue what is considered a death due to accidents in the road caused by other drivers, wildlife, natural forces, war, drunk, etc. That map means absolutely nothing.

Lmao. You’re cute.

So everyone who laughed at that Family guy clip is racist. Got it."
