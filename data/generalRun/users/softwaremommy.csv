AmItheAsshole,ffiyvr9,t3_esxxno,1579986120.0,"One more thing OP, if you’re in the US, giving a baby up for adoption is NOT grounds for removing the other two children from your custody. Don’t let that threat deter you from doing what is right for your family. 

Source: I’ve spent 10 years battling my ex in the court system over my son. The lawyers have all been very clear about what is required to remove a child from custody. The fact that my son’s father has abandoned 2 of his other children (not put up for adoption, literally abandoned), isn’t considered. It’s not relevant to how he cares for my son."
houseplants,ffirmo9,t3_ettyq2,1579980981.0,How did you get one? They sell them at my favorite nursery but say they are more of a novelty than functional. I wonder if there are different types or something?
houseplants,ffirhrj,t3_etrzev,1579980884.0,What do you use to dust her?
AmITheAngel,ffiivyq,t1_ffiikcp,1579974939.0,"Yeah. I know there’s no way to enforce it, but I think it should be mandatory, and not just because I only care what adults think. There are definitely times when I’d want to know a young person’s opinion, and other times when I’d like to hear from the older people. It would be super helpful."
AmITheAngel,ffig6y7,t1_ffiect4,1579973106.0,Because that whole sub has become overcrowded with teenagers that haven’t come to realize the world doesn’t revolve around them.
AmITheAngel,ffig39m,t1_ffiecls,1579973035.0,Yep. Probably the only actual adult in the comments section.
AmItheAsshole,ffidd7e,t3_esxxno,1579971189.0,"I’m so sorry you’re going through this, OP. I can’t imagine not being overwhelmed in your position. Try not to listen to these assholes that want make it sound like you’re the problem here. You are very clearly doing your best, in an unimaginably difficult situation. 

Is there ANY way you can get some sort of therapy? I know your schedule and money are tight, but taking care of yourself is the ONLY way you’re going to be able to take care of your kids. They need the healthiest version of their mom. It’s not just for you. It’s for them. Please get help."
AmITheAngel,ffibwyp,t1_ffgplfz,1579970204.0,"Yeah. I don’t think it’s fake either, especially after reading her replies. It’s really sad that she doesn’t have anyone helping her, when she’s clearly on the brink of a breakdown."
AmItheAsshole,ffibbn4,t1_ffhwbef,1579969795.0,"Yes, regression is a huge deal. That’s the first thing they look for. Listen to the doctors."
AmItheAsshole,ffiazoe,t1_ffho1qh,1579969565.0,Read the whole post. The problems with the first two didn’t start until she was pregnant.
AmITheAngel,ffiakl2,t1_ffhr1pf,1579969278.0,Yeah. It sounds like she has major psychological issues and no one is helping her.
whitepeoplegifs,ffi9qhb,t1_ffi9ieg,1579968693.0,That’s a really good point. It died the day it ended.
whitepeoplegifs,ffi9ogt,t1_ffi9gqo,1579968653.0,But then there’s no plot resolution. Otherwise I would.
whitepeoplegifs,ffi8ywy,t1_ffi7c6g,1579968157.0,"It really did. I can’t even recommend that people watch it, if they haven’t seen it. The ending made the rest of it not even worth watching."
AnimalsBeingMoms,ffgwhut,t3_eti7e7,1579916836.0,"This is my life. Trying to give the kids a bath, while deliriously tired. Then collapsing on the couch with them crawling all over me. Then kids are up before dawn, running a muck and rolling around fighting.

...we’re more similar than we realize."
WhitePeopleTwitter,ffe8v0k,t3_esx7jf,1579839885.0,"Sadly, not many people get to do what they love AND make a good living. Most people have to pick the lesser of two evils: 1) do what you love, while struggling financially, or 2) do what you can tolerate to make a decent living. 

Some days, I wonder what my life would be like had I chosen to swim with dolphins, instead of work in a cubical. But I mostly think I made the right call...for me."
WhitePeopleTwitter,ffe8el6,t1_ffdqor6,1579839514.0,"Meanwhile, you and your mastery of the English language, must be raking in the dough."
