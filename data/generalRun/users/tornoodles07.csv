offmychest,ffcispr,t3_essd64,1579800364.0,Nothing wrong with keeping them away. People who don't vaccinate their children are selfish. They put other babies at risk who aren't old enough for vaccines and people with weak immune systems like chemo patients and the elderly. You are only trying to protect your child.

offmychest,ff1nje7,t3_er4vww,1579482135.0,Its not selfish at all because this isn't your responsibility. Don't let people walk all over you just because they are family. You deserve to spend your free time doing what you want!
offmychest,ff1n09r,t3_er527t,1579481876.0,I can relate to a lot of what you are going through. I often have the same thoughts myself. Please know that you will find someone who cares about your interests. I'm sorry that the people in your life ignored your feelings of being depressed. You matter in this world. Don't let other people determine your worth.

offmychest,fc2xui5,t3_efvdyw,1577376909.0,That's awesome! I've definitely been there. Some people don't understand how much that means to someone who feels like the odd one out.
