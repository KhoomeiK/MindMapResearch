bindingofisaac,ff7fvde,t1_ff7c8p4,1579648598.0,I am too 😏
bindingofisaac,ff6z3fq,t1_ff6ut8u,1579637850.0,Too high?
WTF,ff5z31z,t1_ff5uzi0,1579614829.0,Probably just some fun on an unused/test queue.
investing,ff2pu3j,t1_ff2oimr,1579518437.0,Rebalance?
interestingasfuck,ff0ibn6,t3_eqyfw4,1579469160.0,Its***
apexlegends,ff0i7q1,t1_feztn1r,1579469135.0,Yes it does. Not even fair.
pcmasterrace,fezquze,t1_fezpz81,1579460502.0,"Yeah I'm mostly joking.  I usually try to keep things tidy though, and if I'm looking for something recent sort by date modified."
apexlegends,fezqblm,t1_fezhe86,1579460311.0,Idk.  I think the more stuff they try out the better.  Fresh is good even if sometimes it's a miss (although I've had a ton of fun with the new modes).  I would love a permanent Kings Canyon lobby though.
apexlegends,fezpz5y,t1_fezk8d5,1579460197.0,Wraith nerf?
apexlegends,fezprjv,t1_fezmcjt,1579460129.0,"Forced third person would nerf him pretty good lol.  It's so hard to see around him, and his ADS shield makes it so much worse.  And pinging enemies with ADS shield up is like pinging a window where it doesn't go through."
apexlegends,fezphx0,t1_fezochi,1579460032.0,"Just do hip fire stuff, shotties and prowler will make it fun."
trashy,fezoy1n,t1_fezn8e8,1579459838.0,Think he's referring to the Confederate comment. Not a ton of not-American Confederates.
drunk,fezoife,t3_eqz10q,1579459692.0,Cheers! Develop good habits early 😉
pcmasterrace,fezo8i4,t1_feznb94,1579459596.0,What kinda MONSTER doesn't know where they're saving files and is relying on Explorer to find them? 😤
battlestations,fewbd61,t1_few4a5o,1579407914.0,😊😤
apexlegends,fewbc1x,t1_few7w4u,1579407902.0,Lol yeah I spose
apexlegends,few49fq,t3_eqqetz,1579405151.0,How does this happen?

WTF,few3odr,t1_fevsro5,1579404896.0,"Yeah that's prob exactly what's happened here.  I've done the same, and you learn that lesson quick."
movies,fetyvmp,t1_fetbd9h,1579381446.0,Man I love Igby Goes Down.
OP1users,fetbb7q,t1_fet85ex,1579373589.0,Op1.fun is a great place to start.  There are so many user uploaded sounds.
listentothis,fen08rt,t3_epzbww,1579274051.0,"Hopefully save someone a search:

CD Projekt Red announced on Twitter that the highly anticipated game, which was set to drop on April 16, 2020, but has now been pushed back five months to September 17, 2020."
apexlegends,fejyjle,t1_fehy5ck,1579188764.0,That's not true at all though
OP1users,feis2nd,t1_feilcfm,1579145769.0,Sweet! Glad you didn't have to endure weeks of customer service and shipping :)
OP1users,feid3ta,t1_fedlge8,1579135700.0,Honestly I just play around and then delete the tape haha.  More just looking for inspiration.
OP1users,feiakmh,t3_ekdg7f,1579134005.0,"I liked it, and that rainbow rock is sweet. Roy G Biv man!"
OP1users,fei9v7v,t3_ep6ss3,1579133533.0,"Nah it's probably not defective.  Mine was similar, but just one key.  They pop right off, use like a butter knife or something.  Put it back in and pop it on with some force and see if that helps.  I've had mine for over a year and play quite a bit and that problem hasn't come back."
networking,fefbicp,t1_fef5wds,1579052677.0,What data do you poll for?
networking,fe8bqqi,t3_eo2j6k,1578924596.0,The Sinefa marketing materials are very vague - any idea how that actually works?
OP1users,fe8a57b,t1_fduw2mg,1578924117.0,Thank you for the awesome content!
sysadmin,fe7zdfi,t1_fe7j11v,1578920804.0,"I'm not sure it's fair to say unoptimized... If you're using it to process a lot of data, it just needs more memory."
OP1users,fe650ml,t3_efcxgn,1578881925.0,Dude this is awesome!! 👌🔥🔥
OP1users,fdtvsac,t1_f9wxbds,1578723014.0,REMINDER 2 post 🙃
OP1users,fdtmgqu,t1_fdtkvcz,1578718893.0,Fair.  I have watched all those as many as I've found - just missing *something* but not sure what.  Was hoping someone here was really into that and had some kind of trick.
OP1users,fdtcuvv,t3_empelr,1578714951.0,"Yeah this was excellent, thank you for sharing!"
Stance,fdt43sw,t1_fdt0xes,1578711658.0,There is 0 percent chance this is not on air.
AskReddit,fdoz0n0,t3_embv3x,1578616117.0,I don't see Return of the Mack anywhere wtf
madisonwi,fdnwzx6,t3_emaq6a,1578594553.0,So that's into Sunday morning then?
personalfinance,fdj9w93,t1_fdj8vt2,1578462718.0,Look into it and do the math. You can get an idea of living costs and salaries in other places.
politics,fdj6xgc,t3_elku7e,1578460164.0,Reading this and watching the end of the Apollo 11 documentary really puts into perspective how different a time we're living in.
OP1users,fdijucf,t1_fdigost,1578444520.0,"Thanks for putting something together on those buttons.  I never use them!  So from the video it seems that you can only use one event, and each button holds parameter values; it can't be two different effects?"
videos,fcx9dkp,t1_fcwir59,1578056301.0,Haha I had the same thought.
HollowKnight,fcua2kw,t1_fcu9hy9,1577976130.0,Good luck! It wasn't really THAT bad but it is tough.
HollowKnight,fcu7oe6,t3_eixib5,1577974505.0,Is that path of pain?
AskReddit,fcmd95w,t1_fcmbffe,1577771160.0,South Park did a good school shooting episode kinda recently
politics,fcl82ik,t3_ehp5b1,1577741831.0,Donated!
sysadmin,fckjdbw,t1_fcjkq0b,1577726611.0,"Yeah I'm thinking specifically of MS Teams, since that's what I do primarily lately, which is encrypted by default. Admittedly, I know less about networking.  If there's an IDS literally inspecting packets doesn't it terminate encryption somehow so that it can inspect the data?  Wouldn't that impact speed and reliability?"
talesfromtechsupport,fcke27x,t1_fckdd6t,1577723247.0,What I don't get is anyone in the job market today would be completely unemployable if they were so dumb they couldn't remember three steps to do X task.  How did that work 20 years ago?  It was just ok?
sysadmin,fcikk5r,t1_fcicf4z,1577664109.0,Tunneling real time media traffic will really impact the quality though.
todayilearned,fchtjj9,t1_fchltds,1577653958.0,Aw my data is just as nice as yours 😒
sysadmin,fchp08z,t1_fcf56ic,1577652625.0,I'm not understanding how this is new though.  Isn't it pretty obvious that just because something is on your internal network it isn't implicitly trusted?  There has to be more nuance to this than what I'm gathering reading here.
sysadmin,fchoa8b,t1_fcg89qu,1577652360.0,"An AD domain kinda covers a lot of what this is about - when a user is printing to a printer in your environment, are they allowed to anonymously print or does it check for auth and permissions?  Can anyone plug in a laptop and use your network, or are there restrictions?  Can any user log into a server?  What if they manage to get on the right vlan?"
sysadmin,fchn04n,t1_fcfkn4u,1577651974.0,Until you need RTP everywhere that responds poorly to packet sniffing.  What would be a good way to have both?
todayilearned,fchkimf,t1_fchirlg,1577651294.0,Somewhere in that range is the exact right amount though.
todayilearned,fchjowu,t1_fchc2uo,1577651120.0,"Crazy how much our data is worth, isn't it?"
OP1users,fcganby,t1_fcg91z6,1577638087.0,Ah that's a bummer.  Thanks for the info!
OP1users,fcfwdvy,t1_fcfkztt,1577634311.0,"Oh interesting.  I already have that kit lol.  If I have that installed, can I use the filter on other sounds too?"
OP1users,fcez2gp,t1_fc2r8bq,1577625068.0,Wait where do you find filter?
buildapcsales,fc6y59k,t1_fc6x7s0,1577492511.0,Yeah they did.
buildapcsales,fc5ahz1,t1_fc4nked,1577451079.0,I literally put mine in the washing machine with a little detergent on low spin.  Cleaned it perfectly.  My pad is 36x48 inches so idk if I could even lay it down in the tub lol.
AskReddit,fc4gs94,t1_fc3c6uu,1577416216.0,"Wait what do you mean ""them?"""
buildapc,fby2a8w,t1_fbxxnhr,1577206358.0,"Ah no worries, and thanks for the great idea!"
