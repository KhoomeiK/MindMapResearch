Not all podcasts are purely entertainment, there are absolutely ones that require journalistic integrity. Anyone who interacts with victims or family members directly, or does first hand reporting has some ethical responsibility. Anyone who presents themselves as a journalist or reports on behalf a publication, absolutely. But they can still conjecture about the law and be wrong as long as they're not presenting themselves as authorities or journalists. What bullshit memes started like this?

The Dollop does plenty of research but still don't know everything. I don't go to them for legal analysis, it's a fun and light show. The Dough Boys aren't even particularly knowledgable about food. It doesn't matter. The shows stand on their own merits.

Plaigarism is still a concern as is it in all entertainment. Literally any conjecture that doesn't venture into slander is fine, even about the legal system! 

You're talking about your personal standards that podcasts should adhere, not actual standards. That's fine, listen or don't listen. There is 100% nothing wrong with a host conjecturing and not looking it up - if it only takes five seconds and you care then *you* look it up.

I haven't broken a heating element yet after hundreds of uses, but I have hit temp control issues that require a complete rebuild. Only happens due to oil boiling over the side of the cup. 

The ti cup comes with a heating element, and the v4 itself comes with a second quartz bowl/heating element combo. I'd just buy a few spares and you wont have to worry about it for a year or two. I got the 3 pack of Ti cups since I have two v4s, and so I'm pretty set with heating elements."
TrueCrimePodcasts,ffbmdhc,t3_esmsvn,1579772519.0,"Man the bar has changed so much. Back in my day, having a decent microphone basically made you overqualified. 

There are entertainment podcasts and there are journalistic podcasts. Sounds like you very much prefer one over the other. I don't expect Kieth Morrison to have an initimitate knowledge of the law. ""I'm not clear on this distinction"" is a pretty reasonable thing to say, and I don't need every podcast to explain everything to me. The only responsibility is to entertain, and if they're failing at that it's a different issue than not having adequate information. Does it *really* matter to my overall understanding of the story how someone can be charged with two degrees of murder? 

Listen or don't listen, no one needs or benefits from a rant about who should and shouldn't make a podcast. Is there a lack of shows such that you *need* to listen to these? I don't like comedy podcasts that don't involve professional comedians, but I'm not condescending to amateurs for doing something they enjoy just because they're not doing it at a professional level."

You can stop using the word diversity and use the term *scope* if you want. It's a different ordeal to role out a national program across the continental US than it is across finland. That's not controversial or weird. Diversity doesn't necessarily mean race, it can mean a rural person with no neighbors for 20 miles. It's very hard to enforce a school program in NYC the same way that you do in the middle of Alaska. 

Not trying to suggest that Finland is a monolith where everyone lives in the same suburban culdesak, just that the practical makeup of the countries *does* make it different. Diversity isn't an excuse, but *scope* is a factor."
