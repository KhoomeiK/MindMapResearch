are you aware of how people make billions? how does it make him a shitty person?

such as? apart from what he's doing now?

>To be honest, I don't think Gates will vote for trump, but to say he couldn't is more than optimistic.

it isn't more than optimistic. it's realistic. he went on to clarify statements after the media made a hooplah about how he would vote for Trump saying how he will vote for the more PROFESSIONAL candidate, even if they don't agree with some of their policies (i.e. tax plan). you bought into the media frenzy if you think **refusing to answer who you will vote for** means you are going to vote for Trump."

it doesn't make for a poor business. office staff do not need, and are not expected, to be able to explain medical conditions and their associated procedures to the common layman."
AmItheAsshole,fd02xlj,t1_fd01x6x,1578112851.0,"it isn't difficult to hypothesize methods of communicating. that isn't my point, i'm highlighting that you are hypothesizing something that might not exist. it is not improbable that this particular veterinary OR does not have an intercom.

furthermore, if we're going to go down this wild ride you insist on - do you really want a receptionist to explain a medical procedure to OP? the last thing *anyone* needs is some kind of misunderstanding resulting in OP refusing the procedure. you generally don't rely on receptionists to describe medical conditions to people. it isn't a part of their job description, and there is a reason for that."

worldnews,fc63pqi,t1_fc6372d,1577471571.0,that's a whole lot of hoopla. I straight up said I don't agree with the wealth. maybe people like me are pushing that it's tied in assets so... people understand that's what it is? crazy concept to call a duck a duck?
worldnews,fc60wc6,t1_fc5z2k0,1577469790.0,"I was replying to someone claiming he could make sizable returns if he invested his fortune in extremely low yield assets. well, that doesn't make sense because his fortune is accrued wealth in the form of an investment already. 

I don't agree with his wealth, and don't believe stating the fact that it's tied up in Amazon stock diminishes the value. realistically, people are going to need to understand how this entire thing works if there's going to be any intelligent discussion. 

if you want to talk obfuscation, posting about an investment fair handing out wealth certainly doesn't help. let's stay factual, yeah?"
