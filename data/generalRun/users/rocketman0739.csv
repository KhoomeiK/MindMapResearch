I don't know of any, but that's not a requirement for a submarine."

WeirdWings,ff8avgj,t1_ff80n05,1579671274.0,"That's all very well, but the point of my post was responding to the commenter who thought radials were very oil-thirsty. No matter how distinct radials and rotary radials actually are, they're close enough that that commenter conflated them, so it's useful to explain what the commenter was (in a garbled manner) thinking of."

*Unable* but *inability,* interestingly enough."

grammar,ff5gp2a,t3_erpj0b,1579592084.0,"“I don't know either” is just fine and means that _you too_ are ignorant of something.

“I don't know too” might mean that, or it might mean you are not _also_ aware of something.

So in the first, the other person definitely doesn't know, while in the second they might know. I would recommend never using “I don't know too,” since you can always be clear by saying either “I don't know either” or “I don't also know.”"
