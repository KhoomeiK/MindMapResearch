intermittentfasting,fd3dyfl,t3_ejyhm4,1578157377.0,"Artificial sweeteners in those drinks will still cause your insulin to spike, which is the opposite of what IF is supposed to do, so I would stick to water, and green tea if you need caffeine. Some people still drink coffee, which is fine, just gotta watch the sugar; real and artificial sweeteners cause your pancreases to go bananas and release too much insulin."
AmItheAsshole,fcqrd07,t3_ei40zr,1577891003.0,"NTA. If not having social media deters any woman from wanting to date you, then she just isn’t the woman for you. It’s rare to meet someone whose life isn’t consumed by several different social media platforms, so I say hold your ground, it’s absolutely not necessary to have social media profiles, and it’s ridiculous that not having social media presence, would ever be viewed as a red flag. The real red flag is a person that puts so much stock into social media, that they would write someone off just for not having an Instagram or a Facebook."

JUSTNOMIL,fcl5wbj,t3_ehmhf8,1577740488.0,"NTA. Absolutely unacceptable for any adult to ever put hands on a child. You need no justification for your actions, at least your kids know that their mother will protect them from people that hurt them. You did the right thing, definitely showed more restraint than I would have."
SuicideWatch,fcir7qf,t1_fcgnutw,1577667891.0,Thank you. You’re very kind. I found your words to be soothing. I appreciate you.
AmItheAsshole,fciqs1q,t3_eh8f8j,1577667595.0,"NTA. You have every right to share your last name with your husband. The idea that you should have to ask your father or brother is outdated and sexist, you’re not less worthy of passing on the name just because you are a female! You are the one in the family that will bare children, not your brother, his future wife will, so why is she worthy? And why doesn’t your brother have to ask permission to share the name with another person? These standards are arbitrary. You live your truth, it isn’t going to hurt anything but their ego if you and your fiancé carry on as you plan."

SuicideWatch,fcge39q,t1_fcg9k2g,1577639029.0,"Hi. Thanks for the response. My husband knows how I feel, he’s aware that I have suicidal thoughts, but he doesn’t know about the self harm. I’m afraid that it will scare him, he already gets fearful when I express that I’m having suicidal thoughts, and I know that’s a normal response, and it’s ok, but it just makes me feel so bad, knowing that I made him afraid, so I have been holding back recently, with how much I tell him about what I’m dealing with day to day.

I have a really great emotional support dog. His name is Wallace, and he is an Australian Shepherd, having him is extremely helpful. I’m forced to get out of the house, and take him for walks, so I spend time in the woods, every day, running or walking with him, and that’s a very good distraction. I also journal, do yoga, and regular meditation, but sometimes, it gets so heavy that I just can’t, and I’ll turn into the couch for days at a time."

Breathe man, it will be ok for you. Smoke a bowl or something. Wink wink."

But you know what, at least you had the courage to put yourself out there, imagine how much worse it would feel just living your life not knowing how she feels? Getting rejected burns, but it builds character. One day you’ll ask a new crush out and she will say yes, do not get discouraged."
toastme,fcfx5vn,t3_eh0wxx,1577634552.0,God damn gorgeous face. Shaped like a beautiful heart with big bright eyes. A treasure to behold.

toastme,fcfwpto,t3_eh264s,1577634419.0,"You’ll be alright. I was 21 when I had my first child, the best thing you can do is to make sure you have a support system in place. Don’t try to do it alone, ask for help when you need it."

AmItheAsshole,fcfv94c,t3_eh3i79,1577634052.0,"I will say, that if you intend to marry this woman, I do think you should consider telling her, but make it known that it’s private, and she is not to share your financial info with anyone else, not even family. So maybe think about your relationship and what your intentions are there, as well as thinking about the money issue."
AmItheAsshole,fcfunr8,t3_eh3i79,1577633884.0,"NTA for not telling anyone about it. It would be completely different if you were hoarding it all and not supporting your child. You are golden as long as you take care of that kid, maybe set a chunk aside for the baby, to give to them when they graduate school or whatever. As for the girl friend, it sucks that she has to stop her schooling, but it’s not your responsibility to pay for that for her, she can get financial aid, like everyone else. 

Probs for the best to keep it a secret, especially since her dad sounds like a bit of a hack, and since y’all aren’t married, she especially doesn’t need to know."
amiugly,fcfjwwi,t3_eh1dqd,1577630687.0,"Definitely not ugly. Quite pretty, actually. Perhaps consider playing up your features, like your lovely eye shape and pretty lips, by wearing winged eyeliner, mascara, and lipstick or a tinted lip balm. Your natural hair looks way prettier on you than straightened hair, so maybe consult with a really good hairstylist that has lots of experience with texture, because the right haircut could totally change your life. Lol. Also, eyebrows. Learn how to fill your eyebrows in a way that looks natural, but lends a little more definition of shape and fullness."

The last picture is nice too, but I think you should keep a clean shaven face until you can grow a full beard. Also, fitted clothing is best, so try not to wear things that are too baggy."

BlackPeopleTwitter,fc6uujh,t1_fc6q6lc,1577490085.0,"Ummmm I don’t think you understand. I’m not saying that you can’t be declared dead because your heart has stopped functioning for an extended period of time, I’m saying that death isn’t official until brain activity has ceased, and if your heart hasn’t been pumping for awhile, your brain probably isn’t getting enough oxygen to function anymore. The brain only keeps going for like 3-6 minutes without oxygen or after the heart stops beating. Lol.

AskMen,fc44s4r,t3_eftcl3,1577406625.0,"Don’t do anything that you have seen in porn, unless she asks you to.

You can probs keep it relatively simple the first time, make sure there is a decent amount of foreplay, it takes women a little longer to get physically aroused and feel ready for sex, than it does a man. So like after you make out for awhile, and do some cool hand things, like finger her, but don’t like finger bang her pussy, ok, like it’s cool to slip some fingers inside, and go at that for a sec, but your main focus should be the clitoris. Find it. Love it like it is the best most amazing thing you have ever touched, and when you’re done touching it with your fingers, try using your tongue, if she’s cool with it, and lick it, suck it, whatevs, but don’t bite it or anything, unless she’s asks you to, haha. Anyway, just make mouth love to your girls clit, that’s all, and maybe she’ll give you a beejer for a minute, and then things will progress in a blur of hot sweaty buttsss and toddies, and before you know it, you’ll be doing the sex. Start slow, and don’t be scared to ask her what she likes and don’t be afraid to tell her what you like. Always ask for consent before doing something new, like don’t try to put it in her butt without asking first, just rude. You’ll be fine. Just communicate and don’t over think it. Good luck!"
AmItheAsshole,fc43t7c,t3_efz1kb,1577405900.0,"NTA. First of all, you are only 4 years older!!!! It’s not like she’s 20 and your fucking 35! And age shouldn’t matter when one person is verbally abusive to another person. Your stepmom is a shit mother, who should have used her daughters gross behavior as a learning moment, one in which a parent might lend a bit of wisdom to a child, regarding how ones words can severely damage another person. Your sister sounds like a grown ass baby, and she should be embarrassed by herself, and ashamed that as an adult, she is still a bully, and a coward. They deserve each other and you deserve better, even if you did go full on murderer with your clap back, killing your sisters inflated ego. Bravo. Text back and just say  “k byyyeeeeee.”"
