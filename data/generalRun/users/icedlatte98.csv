depression_help,ffecd8r,t3_esogi3,1579842955.0,"Hi there. I struggle with the exact same thing. It’s so frustrating because I feel so good sometimes, but I know I’m just going to fall right back into that dark space. I try to handle one day at a time. Thinking too much about how I will feel tomorrow or next week only makes it worse. You can also try journaling how you feel, see if there’s any triggers, and test what helps in those moments. I always reach out to a friend or family member or I meditate, things like that. Hope this helps!"
depression_help,ffec4zt,t3_esk0py,1579842744.0,"Hi friend- as a girl who ended it with her depressed boyfriend, I felt a lot of guilt. I have my own mental health issues and him pushing me away more and more was too much to handle. I knew I needed the space to deal with my own state and let him sort himself out too. It’s been 2 months, and still a solid amount of the time I want to die or fall asleep and never wake up, but it gets better. I always think of the phrase “this too shall pass.” It feels horrendous, but it’s just a whole bunch of neurons firing off in your brain trying to protect itself. Let her have space and give a lot to yourself. You don’t need someone else to get through this dark time, you just have to be your own best friend. Good luck and if you need anything I’m here."
Mindfulness,ffe6ma1,t3_esumtr,1579838085.0,The app headspace! I can’t say enough good things about it. It has really helped with my anxiety and my acceptance of uncertainty.
GreenEyed,fem0d70,t3_eptezl,1579235728.0,Your eyes are so pretty! Also what foundation do you use your skin looks amazing!
FemaleHairLoss,fei2htp,t3_ep8adw,1579128841.0,"Go to a dermatologist and get your blood checked- mine turned out to be low iron levels (21f) and now I’m on an iron supplement and my hair is growing back, supplemented by rogaine and spironolactone. Since you’re so young, it’s hopefully just a case of unbalanced vitamins, nutrients, hormones etc."
Anxiety,fegrdcq,t3_ep2lcn,1579100747.0,"Well done! The first day is so scary but you did it! 

I also live with anxiety and I mentor first year students, so if you need someone to talk to or some advice (I’m now a senior) hmu!"
FemaleHairLoss,fegnyl3,t3_ep22du,1579098360.0,Maybe it’s seborrheic dermatitis? I have it on my face and scalp and my dermatologist told me it can contribute to hair loss! I just use an antifungal shampoo and it helps.
Lizards,fdig3xt,t3_elj276,1578442125.0,I love this!!!
SchittsCreek,fdh4ath,t3_elclll,1578415075.0,Is this a homage to queen?! Love that!!!
depression,fd6lwvd,t1_fd4v5k5,1578192907.0,"Coming from the other perspective, as in I was the one who broke up with my boyfriend over this same issue, believe me it hurt just as much. I’m an absolute wreck over it- I tried so hard to help but I think I made it worse by trying to inadvertently “fix” him. He won’t talk to me now and I feel so guilty, but I also know I have my own problems and I couldn’t handle his and my own. I hope you find happiness and if you want someone to talk with, I’d be happy to. Best wishes"
depression,fd6jk0r,t3_ek3uky,1578192014.0,"Hi there- I’m going through a similar breakup, but there was no cheating. It’s made me feel deeply depressed and given me constant anxiety and panic attacks so I hear you. The only thing I can say is it’s been more than a month for me now and you just have to take it day by day. It’s similar to grief where it’s a process that comes and goes in its difficulty. It also might feel better to be mad at her, but in my opinion, I feel better keeping positive thoughts rather than adding anger to my sadness. Hope you are ok tonight my friend :)"
depression,fd6iwx6,t1_fd5wdyr,1578191733.0,"Hi friend- sounds similar to how I feel. But finding a good psychiatrist/therapist is so crucial. You should look into other people near you since it sounds like they’re more detrimental than helpful. If you can get that sorted, I promise that will make a difference. Good luck!"
Needafriend,fcllffh,t3_ehm671,1577750532.0,21F and same! So much going on. Feel free to DM
relationship_advice,fbzomre,t3_ef9m1k,1577254161.0,"This is super similar to what I’m going through, but I’m in the no contact/healing phase. I broke up with him due to his personal issues/mental health struggles to take the pressure off. I’m hoping he reaches out when he is ready. Obviously you are ready now, and should absolutely reach out. If he says no, then you know it’s not meant to be for now and maybe try being single for a while to make sure you know who you are. If he says yes, then great! Either way, you get something good out of it. Good luck!"
