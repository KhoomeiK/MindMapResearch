For the old adventures, their cards are craftable, so I'd assume the same, or at worst a temporary lockout period.  Just open your collection and see if you can craft it."
hearthstone,ffthh65,t3_euoi8e,1580220662.0,What about biology project.  Should do the same on 10 mana.
CompetitiveHS,ffsm5zl,t1_ffqyohx,1580185199.0,At what rank is it working?
MaliciousCompliance,ffsjavk,t1_ffs81lj,1580183084.0,"I had a kind professor advise me of something similar when you go up to defend your thesis, or generally go up to present research before a critical audience.  He said to leave something small out so that a rather obvious question could be raised that you have already answered, then you look really good having a solid response on the spot.  He called it a ""bear-trap""."

CompetitiveHS,ffikeff,t1_ffgb7t2,1579975975.0,"Check the wild rogue section of www.hearthstone-decks.com a couple players piloted it to legend and decent ranks in legend a few months ago.  It's a pretty fringe deck and wants patches, though ive personally climbed to rank five with a highlander burgle deck that didn't have patches."
CompetitiveHS,ffigqvs,t1_ff8xsse,1579973484.0,He's also basically garbage in wild atm.  Odd warrior is a tier four deck if that.

Its the only chance i ever get to abuse bwonsamdi + spirit, and i would never play big preist on ladder(not to mention I'm missing many of the cards).  Enemy ai can be pretty dumb.  Shudderwok and cutlass rogue are my other go-tos."

I eneded up with less than a quarter of a rope for my turn.  Game was close, that handed the win to my opponent."
aww,ffhcgsz,t1_ffh9hzo,1579929825.0,"Teddy Roosevelt, a Form President of the US had a famous saying "" Walk softly and carry a big stick"".  It reffered to his foriegn policy of being peaceful, but sending a strong military presence (ussually navy warships) near a country or region he was negotiating with.  Sort of a be nice to them, but let them see you could beat them up if they try to mess with you or don't give in to your demands.  

It was a pretty bad joke on my part tbh"

mildlyinteresting,ffew0q1,t1_ffe8u8d,1579867898.0,"Its a translation thing.  In English, Limes are green, and Lemons are yellow.  The only times Lemons are green is when they are under-ripe.   Es algo que confusa a todos mis amigos de Mexico, pero le juro que es asi.  Por lo que he visto no se usan los ""lemons""( son amarillas) en Mexico, pa bebidas y comida in mi experiencia siempre son ""limes"" (verdes).  Saben similares, pero distintas."

insanepeoplefacebook,ffbyln3,t1_ffbxiai,1579786883.0,"The rightwing media in the US loves to portray Nordic countries as these places that are being ruined by all the Muslims immigrants they are letting in because of naïve leftwing politics.  Anytime an immigrant commits a crime they jump on it to say that the immigrants just can't supress their barbaric tendencies, despite how nice the socialist lefty Europeans are."

It's born true for me, I'm decently conversational, and just moved to an area with a good amount of Dominicans, 10/10 don't understand.   I think the equivalent for English would be a thick Irish, Jamaican, or Cajun accent, where even as a native speaker i struggle."
nba,ff9n2u4,t1_ff9ine1,1579716443.0,"To clarify from other posters, there's two videos.  One is from someones cellphone recording the beating, the other from a cop who got there later.  The beating is in broad daylight in the middle of the street, guy was kicking and stomping on D. West.  There were at least four cars stopped, noone got out to help, the cellphone person had a bunch of inappropriate emojiis on the vid about how Delonte must have made someone mad.  The cop's video wasn't any better, he has him handcuffed asking him questions in a very condescending manner.  People are garbage."

wildhearthstone,fdwtwjz,t3_en9el9,1578762307.0,"Brawl is a classic card, so you will also be able to use it in standard.  On the other hand, if you're patient you'll likely eventually open a free one from a Tavern Brawl Classic pack.  I loathe crafting classic cards for this reason, in the long run you're pissing away dust on stuff you'll get free.  Rat is used in a ton of wild decks, so thats where my instincts point, but I don't play dmh so I couldn't say for sure.  All those cards seem pretty core."
