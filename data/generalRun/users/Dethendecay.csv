**and then i thought:** but wait, is diversity our strength even? surely a country full of 330 million republicans or 330 million democrats or white people or black people or gay people, surely they would be a *strong,*united country. just not a better country.

so in the past 5 minutes, i’ve drawn a different conclusion. diversity isn’t a strength, rather it’s a calculated weakness. but it is good, and it is a better way of life.

i am curious how agreeable this stance is. i’ve always heard diversity is our strength; nothing close to what i just said now."

i’d tell her to stand her ground, that you’re proud of her for coming this far. but i’d also try to stress how big of an age gap it really is. 3 years during your teen years is pretty big. and also it’s soon to be illegal. just realized that, you might wanna stress that also. encourage her to date her age. the idea of dating a senior as a freshman/sophomore is romanticized in their heads i think, but almost always results in peer pressure."
