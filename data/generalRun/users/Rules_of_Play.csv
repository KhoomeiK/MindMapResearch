sexaddicts,fdn00ex,t3_em3aff,1578572966.0,"I really wish I could give you the best advice and tell you the right thing, but I really don't know. I guess the best advice a 21M with a mild sex addiction could give you is to focus on your personal growth and working on yourself is truly the key for you. Helping him will be hard and I wish I could do more to help you both. I can only imagine the pain you're going through, but everything will be okay in the end. As long as you have a base pillar holding you up made up of your own self love, you will be okay. Please, never stop working on yourself. The last comment I saw is true. He needs to go to SAA. Again, I wish I could do more. I don't know your faith system, but if it helps, I'll keep you both in my prayers."

sexaddicts,fcvrqmt,t3_ej3hhc,1578008611.0,"I've never found cold turkey to work for me. Being realistic and understanding that sex is a beautiful thing that is not something to give up, but enjoy in loving circumstances kept me going. And  masterbation is okay and even healthy in moderation. Ease off of it and in time, keep a steady comtrol. I've found it to work best. The first step was admitting you have a problem. And you did. You're actively taking steps to better yourself and if no one else, we as a community are proud of that. Stay strong! We're all cheering for you."
