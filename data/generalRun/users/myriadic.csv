They published three major papers between 1939 and 1940 on children's self-perception related to race. Their studies found contrasts among African-American children attending segregated schools in Washington, DC versus those in integrated schools in New York.[25] The doll experiment involved a child being presented with two dolls. Both of these dolls were completely identical except for the skin and hair color. One doll was white with yellow hair, while the other was brown with black hair.[26] The child was then asked questions inquiring as to which one is the doll they would play with, which one is the nice doll, which one looks bad, which one has the nicer color, etc. The experiment showed a clear preference for the white doll among all children in the study.[27] These findings exposed internalized racism in African-American children, self-hatred that was more acute among children attending segregated schools[citation needed]. This research also paved the way for an increase in psychological research into areas of self-esteem and self-concept.[8]"

you have no idea how long that will take. just because the longest recession in the last ""x"" years lasted ""y"" years, doesn't mean the next one won't be double that

when you're getting older, especially after you retire, it's harder to go back to work if you need to, and even harder during a recession. that's why you want more bonds as you get closer to retirement, which is exactly what a target retirement date index fund does"
financialindependence,feafbjy,t1_fea9ymk,1578947986.0,"> No it's not. It's setting up a specific -amount- for bonds/cash quantity and sticking to it for bond/cash quantity instead of percentage based on worst case analysis of stock market downturns versus spending needs.

it sounds to me like what you're suggesting is only keeping a couple years worth of money in bonds and having the rest in stocks. assuming you have 1M for retirement, and you need 100k to survive 2 years, that's 10% in bonds.

this means that, if the stock market dropped 50%, you'd lose 45% of your portfolio. maintaining a certain ratio of bonds isn't just to ensure you have enough reliable income to get you through a market downturn, it's to limit the losses from a downturn which

as for during a recession, the whole point of having bonds is safety. if you're just spending your bonds, then you're depleting your safety net faster than planned

also, target retirement date funds constantly buy the dip, in order to maintain their bond/stock ratio, which it sounds like you want. unless you're constantly monitoring stock/bond prices, a target date fund will do it much more efficiently"

> Plus there were target date funds dated 2010 where people wanted to retire in 2010 and they automatically pulled cash out of stocks and into bonds while the stock market was down causing permanent locked in losses.
