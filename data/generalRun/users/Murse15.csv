Nurse,ffi3vpa,t1_ffhabs4,1579964330.0,"I'm an ICU nurse, and I find rules are a little more lax in the ICU environment. I've been rocking a full beard (down to my chest at times) since day one. I don't like to have it that long because it's a pain in the ass covering it during sterile dressing changes, so I usually keep it shorter and well groomed.

As for tattoos, I have a few that hang out of my scrub tops and have had no issues. One of the guys I work with is former military as well and has basically a full bodysuit. When he started he just kept them covered with long sleeves, but now they're on full display.

Nursing school is a different beast, though. I had to have all tattoos covered and no facial hair (except a mustache, but I looked like a pedo so I shaved that shit). You're military, so you're used to tight dress standards. Get through nursing school, then play it conservative at first, then fuck it and see what happens.

Cover them up during interviews and clinical, then show off your artwork later. Good luck and thank you for your service."
CCW,felw3sf,t1_fel8hnh,1579232400.0,"I use a Light Tuck with my M&P 2.0 compact and it works very well. I like tge ability to adjust the ride height up and down, as well as the cant. The wing never did much for me since I don't carry appendix (unless I'm in gym shorts and using my Dara), but I love it for what it is; great holster for a fair price."
Missing411,felswtv,t1_fekfsyo,1579230130.0,"Yeah, I saw that and even though I know it can be explained, knowing the stories makes it super creepy."
Missing411,fejisbq,t3_epc6be,1579176073.0,"I thought I was in the wrong subreddit when I saw your name u/trollygag. I always loved reading your input in r/longrange, and if you have input here like you did over there, this is going to be an awesome shift.

Thanks for stepping up."
Missing411,fejinra,t1_feixnkc,1579175925.0,Where you thinking of r/stairsinthewoods? I loved that series too.

gundeals,feh4b56,t1_fegkly0,1579108857.0,"I got this exact gun package for my everyday carry (full size FNX was too big), and I'm pretty sure I paid a solid $100 or more even after rebate. This gun is awesome IMO. I would say it is a buy it now price."
IntensiveCare,fefnwrv,t1_fef54wn,1579060472.0,"I have used all these meds in the ICU I work in, but I've never seen it broken down so well. We need more docs like you willing to teach. Thank you!"
deerhunting,fdxuk30,t1_fdxlzlq,1578773050.0,"There's limited public land, but if you bow hunt you don't even need to enter a lottery. You can get a combo antered and antlerless tag over the counter at any sporting store."
ILGuns,fdswly4,t1_fdqany2,1578708893.0,"I have a friend in the same situation where his FOID was revoked and we were going to have him sell them to me for a dollar, but from everything I've checked si ce his FOID is already revoked, this would be an ILLEGAL SALE since he technically doesn't have a FOID anymore.

His instructions from the ISP were to turn his guns in. That seems fucking ludicrous to me. He would be better off having a boating accident on the way to turn them in."
bowhunting,fdsv5c2,t1_fds8kyc,1578708347.0,I love my Metcalf. Helped me pack a friend's moose out of the Alaskan back country. My MR was by far the most capable and comfortable pack. I was the only one that didn't need to stop and readjust my pack during the pack out.
deerhunting,fdssii7,t1_fdsgrty,1578707376.0,"Damn! Got me beat. I'm right in the heart of the CCFP, but I drive like 1 to 1 1/2 hours to my spots (all public land, no permissions unfortunately)."

deerhunting,fdm670y,t1_fdljivp,1578540769.0,I've seen some monsters in those forest preserves. Man I wish they would let us hunt there.
bowhunting,fdebmtj,t1_fddbuvl,1578335480.0,Nice! Stay safe with those fires brother!
bowhunting,fdcrsj3,t3_ekebe0,1578282476.0,"Mystery Ranch has a huge line of hunting packs, and I love my Metcalf. It's a huge pack, but I use it for multi-day hunts as well as day hunts.

When I compared my pack to my buddies' Cabela's frame packs and a ""hunting"" backpack (I forget what brand), the MR was well above and beyond what they had. Also, it hauled meat like a champ!"
Hunting,fd9ci9t,t1_fd98mz8,1578231491.0,"I know the Illinois one was January of 2019, so was the Missouri one this past season then?

Edit: you're right. The Illinois one was Pope and Young, and the Missouri one is Boone and Crockett as well as overall."
Hunting,fd9c9la,t1_fd74eue,1578231438.0,It looks insane. I would probably just stare if I saw it in the woods. I would totally forget to shoot hahaha.
PimplePoppersDelight,fd723wc,t3_ek54ow,1578198493.0,Why did the popper not instantly wipe off the other person's pus off their finger?! They just let that shit hang out!
Hunting,fd6wwue,t1_fd6uapy,1578196752.0,Illinois has the largest non-typical at 320 5/8.

medicine,fcz2a3f,t1_fcyz1e1,1578092219.0,"You eventually de-cannulate them though, right? I know at my hospital we will leave the grafts and some of tubing in case we need to place ECMO again, but we take them back to OR soon to remove the grafts."
medicine,fcz1zjx,t1_fcywd7i,1578092056.0,"I'm an RN in a CV-ICU, and I routinely pull CTs. My surgeons would have my head if I did something like that."
Waterfowl,fcyxopg,t3_ejjmf7,1578089365.0,"Great photo and dog. Is that a golden?

Edit: just realized the hair is way too short to be a golden."

YouShouldKnow,fckfg30,t1_fckdh7u,1577724135.0,"That's an interesting take on the health care setting aspect. You're probably right about us only seeing the ones who need help rather than the ones who have overcome their problems. I look forward to checking out those sources.

My big problem with the way this thread was trending was that it was condemning AA and claiming harm. AA has helped many people, and I believe it can help many more. I think people should explore all avenues in their search for help."
YouShouldKnow,fckekz6,t1_fckde19,1577723583.0,"Hahaha OK. You're clearly very defensive for some reason, and have given up on a rational discussion. If you're struggling with addiction, I hope you find the help you need, whichever form you prefer."
YouShouldKnow,fckczwf,t1_fckap64,1577722564.0,"Why are you so angry? If you cite something as evidence and that source has no reference to where that information came from, especially when talking about a ""science based recovery"", makes it pretty much invalid.

As for my anecdotal ""evidence"" at the end; if you look at my username, which you latched onto in the middle of your response, you would realize that I am a nurse. So it's a little bit more legit than just your everyday Joe since I see and work with these individuals everyday.

You can do whatever you want, but don't try to steer people away from a program that could possibly help them with their addictions."
YouShouldKnow,fck9sg0,t1_fck769y,1577720394.0,"I don't buy that AA hurts 90% of people. There were no citations of evidence of the facts that this guy was claiming. Without evidence, it's literally just his word.

I'd be more than happy to read the evidence, but I have seen AA help a lot of people."
