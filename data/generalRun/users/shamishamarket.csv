learnmath,fc946cm,t3_egrtwg,1577546751.0,"You could just do what you did, and when you don't get a whole number, subtract off the integer part of the answer and then multiply the remaining decimal by the modulus number (in this case, 6) and that should get you the original number mod 6

edit: Also, a much easier way to solve this would be to note that 603*6004+60005 can be written as (600+3)(6000+4) + 60005. Then, you get the terms 

600\*6000 + 600\*4 + 3\*6000 + 3\*4 + 60005.

Take mod 6 of each number and then add up those remainders to get mod 6 of the whole expression. The first three terms are all clearly multiples of 6, the fourth term is 12 (also a multiple of 6), and the last term is 5 more than a multiple of 6, so your answer in total is 5."
