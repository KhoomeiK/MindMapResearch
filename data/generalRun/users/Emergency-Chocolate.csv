No one should go around quitting their jobs or rioting or deciding that the governments collapsed and the end of the world as we know it is nigh in the absence of information and I don't think anyone is advocating for that.

Maybe it's because I'm from Florida and only moved to another state recently (and am used for people buying out Walmart for storms that honestly aren't that dangerous as long as you use common sense and are far enough inland you won't get flooded) but I honestly don't get the people who are like ""its just the flu""- if it makes people feel more safer and more secure (and therefore less likely to quit their jobs in a panic because they feel like the end is nigh) let them discuss the little things their doing now for that ""just in case"" and their plans for if the worst case scenario comes to pass let them.

VeganActivism,fecpe4t,t1_feckdx7,1578979904.0,"Which is great- when you have the time. For a lot of people it literally isn't possible.


If you want people to realize that going vegan isn't more time consuming than being not vegan you have to show them that. Identify the barriers that are stopping people from going vegan (time, expense, taste,ect) and show them how low they are. 
Saying ""It just takes 10 minutes per meal"" doesn't help, saying ""It usually takes the same amount of time (or less) to cook vegan food than it does to cook nonvegan food"" does.


All acting like they're selfish/morons/horrible (even online) does is start an adversarial relationship between them and veganism. At this point getting people to go vegan is a PR/marketing issue."

books,fecis0i,t1_fec87hh,1578974928.0,The Cat in the Hat is clearly an allegory for stranger danger and not letting random strangers into your home just because they seem nice.
VeganActivism,feci7wg,t1_feceqj0,1578974535.0,"True. I apologize- I should have taken more time to consider my wording earlier. I agree with you 100%.

The root causes of things people consider barriers- ""veganism is a sacrifice in taste"" likely arose because many people aren't vegan by choice so being vegan is a sacrifice they make because they can't afford animal products and ""veganism is expensive"" likely arose because the fact that only people who can afford to be it by choice are people who aren't poor gets combined with the fact that things like beyond burgers are super expensive- are mostly artificial.

Reframing things that people likely consider a negative will help remove the barrier to entry.

Right now the fight to spread veganism is just a massive PR campaign. I see a lot of people attacking nonvegans online and I can't help but feel its counter productive and actively hurting the cause in the long run.

Right now just about everyone knows going vegan is better for the enviroment so instead of alienating potential vegans like so many in the comunity seem determined to do we need to focus on teaching them that doing so isn't going to be the huge sacrifice they think it is- teach them fast, easy, cheap, and tasty recipes (many of which they already cook) and that will be a huge help to get the ball rolling."
VeganActivism,fecat12,t3_eoaw7i,1578969769.0,"So now the best way to handle this is to convince them being vegan is easier (less expensive and more convenient) and better tasting. 

I'd imagine that the best way to do so would be to focus on the bottom and work our way up- start with helping low income workers make the transition (teach them that they could save $X by cutting out animal products and still get the taste, teach them recipes that are fast, super cheap,easy, and keep well, ect) and slowly work our way up.

If lower income people start going vegan to save money and time that negates two huge barriers of entry for people who are middle class and up, making it easier to get them to go vegan.

\[And while obviously not every low income person is going to go vegan, especially since its easy to say you can save money when you can buy in bulk, every little bit helps\]"
VeganActivism,fec8zjk,t1_fec4hr9,1578968763.0,"The thing is that a lot of people don't have the time. Half an hour a day (10 minutes a meal) doesn't seem like a lot to you but 3.5 hours a week is a huge amount of time to a lot of people. Thats an extra 14 hours a month they could be spending at work, or with their kids, or working another job, ect.

In many cases how convenient something is can be a huge barrier to entry- make it convenient, easy, and cheap for the lower level consumers and the higher level ones will eventually follow.

Knowing the barriers to entry and working to lower them is the best way to solve the problem- not, you know, railing against the millions of people who are struggling to stay afloat and who have too much on their plate to even think about adding more it and helping alienate them as a result."
