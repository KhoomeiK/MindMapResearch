AskReddit,fefzdei,t3_eou6il,1579070457.0,I'm a Winx now.
Honeygain,fe6uzfo,t1_fe6opnz,1578905726.0,Ok thanks. I was just worried.
Honeygain,fe6ogaa,t1_fe6o8w6,1578898138.0,"I’m just worried that even if I delete the app Honeygain can access my data, or use WiFi to connect to other devices in my home."
CrazyIdeas,fdim2pu,t3_elk0yl,1578445935.0,I love this idea
AskWomen,fdeyqzw,t3_ekvi2h,1578349457.0,"I absolutely hate my first name. It was my grandmother’s name, which I always hated. Plus I find it’s pretty vulgar and it doesn’t go well with my last name. If I wasn’t afraid of hurting my parents' feelings, I’d go change it tomorrow."
depression,fcs2dvn,t1_fcs0lb5,1577910421.0,Thank you for your kind words. I wish for you the same things. And sorry if I sounded rude.
depression,fcqw6jv,t1_fcqengq,1577893133.0,"Don't worry about your english C: Mine is waaay worse than yours. Btw, I live in Southern Italy. I hate to live here because:

1: There’s no work. I don’t have a diploma, but there are even graduates who can’t find it. That's why so many Italians go away from there.

2: Because Italy has become full of old people, who at least where I live are for the majority subliterate and only the generations born after the Internet are not completely idiots. This is reflected in the media. Italian TV is horrible: you go from pure trash to propaganda for old people probably inspired by the book 1984.

3:  Because if I ever have kids, I don’t want them to grow up here.

4: Because the Italians, as already said, scream and make noise. A lot of people like it - I don’t. Hearing twelve people screaming at me all at once makes me want to rip my eardrums out.

5: Because we have the Vatican and other criminal organizations.

6: Because I want to go away. Do I have to have a reason?"
AskReddit,fcqcygr,t3_eic8yl,1577883539.0,Absolutely.
depression,fcp0grh,t1_fcoxose,1577846711.0,I may have picked the wrong word. What I want is to get out of the area where I currently live. And it’s mainly because I can’t stand the constant noise and disorder and especially the way people think here. I’d like to live at least for a while in a place where people don’t scream.
Italia,fcijpf4,t1_fciab77,1577663689.0,"Probabilmente hai ragione anche se questo non é un film ma proprio il remake della serie animata, e se l'articolo dice il vero questa cosa non solo verrà trasmessa su Italia Uno a ora di pranzo ma avrà anche una nuova sigla di Cristina D'Avena (bleah). Poi si lamentano che i giovani non guardano la TV. E comunque non vedo come trasmettere roba nuova significhi rischiare: c'è n'è di roba migliore che la Mediaset potrebbe far doppiare senza rischi, tipo HunterxHunter 2011o magari Mob Psycho 100."
Italia,fchczfa,t3_eh5euj,1577649347.0,Io non capisco. Ma se invece di doppiare roba del secolo scorso e di cui tra l'altro esiste già la versione italiana spendessero soldi in qualcosa di moderno gli succederebbe qualcosa di brutto?
toastme,fc2qw7h,t3_eft0fg,1577371374.0,Just remember that Shrek married the princess. I wouldn’t call it an insult.
family,fc2n8hx,t1_fc2m4vy,1577367893.0,I am 23. I never finished high school because my parents couldn't afford it and now it will cost me more than 4000 €. My parents told me clearly that I have to pay for it by myself but I don't have money and I can't find a job because of my anxiety. I don't have skills that can help me to make money. How am I supposed to get out of this?
italy,fc1bvp2,t3_efg8fk,1577314130.0,"Se lo facessero per questa si creerebbe un precedente e potrebbero essere costretti a dover restituire tutte le altre opere italiane presenti in Italia, con conseguente svuotamento del Louvre."
