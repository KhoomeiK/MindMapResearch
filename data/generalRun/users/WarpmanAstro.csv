gaming,fgkkozq,t1_fgk2exz,1580867801.0,"But they’re only partnered with them in all the games NOT based on Japan. Kanto, Johto, Hoenn, and Sinnoh have separate PokéMarts; even in the remakes. The *real* scam is that the Western PokéWorld has convinced its populace that Pokémon Centers need to be financed by PokéMart Inc.; a multinational conglomerate."
nintendo,fg6h7e1,t1_fg6fpup,1580567877.0,"This. Big selling points of the Vita and PStv were Remote Play from the PS4. And IIRC, PSP could remote play PS3 towards the end of its own life cycle."
TechNewsToday,fg426zy,t3_ewgzfw,1580494608.0,They should have put their files inside of PC-FX consoles. *Nobody* wants to touch those.
AskReddit,fg0a4zg,t1_fg02z11,1580403484.0,That’s how you get a one-way ticket to sleeping on the couch.
scifi,ffubqj8,t1_ffthaey,1580238629.0,"Reminds me of how people nitpick that time machines have to explain how they also move through space as well, because simply going back in time and not space/time would leave them stranded in that exact spot in the universe before/after the Solar System would have physically been in that spot."
scifi,ffub60y,t1_fftlj41,1580238291.0,"As the old saying goes “Terry never *killed* anyone, but a lot of villains in Batman Beyond certainly *died*”."
nintendo,ffuan0n,t1_fftz8jl,1580237974.0,"I’m willing to bet that Bank will be shut down at the beginning of Year 2 of Home. That’ll have been enough time for everyone to have gotten everyone moved over, a full year of the SWSH expansions, and enough time for people to have played whatever game they’re releasing in 2021 to have decided on getting Home."
TechNewsToday,fftiyg2,t1_ffrxaao,1580221777.0,"Well, the people making the Atari VCS have been parading around their little plastic nothing for 3 years now and nothing to show for it, so..."
movies,fftih4e,t1_ffscsod,1580221422.0,"Easy:

John Carpenter’s The Thing - “The Original”*

2011 The Thing - “The Bad CGI One”

Frozen Hell version - “The New One”

(note: I know *Thing From Another World* is technically “the original” as its the first adaptation of *Who Goes There?*, but it’s got a different enough title.)"
AskReddit,ffpau60,t1_ffn2r0g,1580090452.0,"I vaguely remember hearing a legend that the English monarchs have the power to bestow long life on one person. Her uncle, Edward VIII gave young Elizabeth his. Out of spite, she used hers on herself."
todayilearned,ffkvclq,t1_ffktoub,1580029648.0,"People were already living on The Isles before the Celts showed up during the Iron Age. AFAIK, there's not a name for them (other than what they're called in what's left of Celtic folklore that mentions them), so I went with Aboriginal."
todayilearned,ffk3jss,t1_ffjxiwd,1580014717.0,Which means these deer were probably driven extinct by the Aboriginal Irish that are whispered about in Celtic Folklore.
murfreesboro,ffezuxy,t3_et9rvd,1579871696.0,The new Student Union Building at MTSU is a pretty great place to play D&D.
pokemon,ffcssej,t3_emvxog,1579806524.0,"Kofangel’s point is spot on. People don’t like to admit this, but there’s a WHOLE lot of people waiting to transfer their Pokémon from Pokémon Go into the game, because it’s literally the cheapest way to get a full Pokédex.

Ironically, completionists will probably end up being mad that the Gen 8 Pokémon won’t all be in Gen 9, forcing them to just buy it anyway."
todayilearned,ffbtz3v,t1_ffb7v13,1579782659.0,"Yeah; at the first type, you probably don’t want to be pointed out as not being a *real* blonde by a cackling Riddler, and in the other, you probably don’t want Batman tapping you on the shoulder to ask you to put on a Bat-condom."
MovieDetails,fevy82d,t1_feo9yg7,1579403053.0,It’s the reason why they have a laugh about having a suit that Bruce can let him turn his head in The Dark Knight; all film Batsuits up until that point had been constructed with the massive cowl that restricted head movements.
AskReddit,fevuhp2,t1_fetop97,1579401667.0,The moment when Spider-Man’s uncle gets shot *ABSOLUTELY* feels like you turned the page to a full page spread of the moment the shot hits him.
todayilearned,fedkd8j,t3_eokwn6,1579013704.0,Was this the same accident where he was in a coma and came out of it when someone addressed him as Bugs Bunny to ask how he was feeling?
osr,fedk0q7,t3_eolmu0,1579013467.0,"In my experience, players tend to take low rolls negatively as it is, so tables like this (while interesting) make them feel unduly punished for something they can’t control.

They *are* situations where a player would be okay with it (cursed items, side effects of severe illnesses), but they’re very few and far between."
AskReddit,fedjord,t3_eojnoy,1579013230.0,What is the Canadian view of Britain? Americans see them as a mix of overseas cousins/former rivals/soft spoken nerd to our outspoken jock. Is it the same or something different for y’all?
murfreesboro,fediewr,t1_fecr6jy,1579012326.0,"Ezel and Abernathy. They’re the two dorms right next to the Womack Apartments. The second and third floors are chained off, though. The weirdest thing about them is that I was *never* given a straight answers as to *why* they’re abandoned when I was at MTSU. I’ve heard everything from cracked foundation to money laundering scheme."
murfreesboro,fedi1jb,t1_fed85nt,1579012055.0,"Middle Tennessee used to be Meth Central at one point, so it’s not too surprising."
pokemongo,feda21s,t3_eo9h13,1579005259.0,"Welcome to being a player of a Gacha Game. I know Americans are pretty unfamiliar with how Gatchas work, but even if this actually became a lawsuit that went to trial, all that would happen is that Niantic would have to show the actual shiny rates, which Pokémon are shiny, the actual egg draws, and maybe even a “guaranteed” shiny per event. The only monitory compensation would be that every player gets a one-time-only Adventure Box for free."
rpg,fddop66,t1_fddmuoq,1578319762.0,"You should definitely change out how damage works depending on what sort of story you want to do. If it's just straight-up horror, I'd say HP could still work, but you drastically lower it and add stakes. You're right that it would be hard to have a Lvl 10 Dwarf Barbarian be scared of the likes of Jason Voorhees without seriously jacking him up to absurd levels, but that doesn't necessarily mean that HP should be thrown out to accommodate it. 

A system where players cap out at 10 HP and take penalties to other stats when they take damage would made for pretty intense moments. Large man with machete becomes a lot scarier when you know that being at 5 HP means that you can't run at full speed and you take penalties on skills needing concentration."
rpg,fddjuf9,t1_fdcun6c,1578315114.0,It’s just a bit lame that RPGs are catching flack for a thing they innovated first. It’s like disliking musicals because music numbers remind you of children’s movies.
AskReddit,fddiag9,t1_fd9xj7q,1578313413.0,I’d forgotten about this travesty. Not even Capcom Europe’s Megaman Legends 3 tweet would have gotten this much ire.
DSPDiscussion,fcok6jx,t1_fclcap4,1577834286.0,"Wouldn’t be surprised that he believes that. He probably heard once back East that waiters don’t have to pay tax on tips, so he’s been running with that logic."
