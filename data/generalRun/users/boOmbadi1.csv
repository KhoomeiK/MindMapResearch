softwaregore,fezya9t,t1_fezvn1g,1579463187.0,"Not a native English speaker here but IMO “to fail sb.” would more be like “jdn. enttäuschen” (i.e., to let down sb.), while “to fail” is “versagen” (depending on the context, if you fail a test, then it’s “durchfallen”, etc.).

So if you let down yourself, you could write “Ich habe mich selbst enttäuscht.” Though I would respond you shouldn’t be so hard on yourself, because Deutsch ist schwer."
