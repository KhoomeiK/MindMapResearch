AskReddit,fey4b2j,t1_felu8ol,1579440694.0,"This idea, while nice, is flawed. You can agree it isn't hard to understand why you didn't exist before being born, but the same logic goes for when you die. Your body is your entire connection to the world. It dies? You die. Your consciousness too. 

The world didn't become the way it is, full of life and beauty, by mistake. It did because of statistical likelihood. Given enough time, a great deal of circumstances will occur in a chemical sense. Given enough space, some places in this universe will have the right toolset of temperature level, elements at hand, and tranquility in the solar system to evolve the life we have today. Millions of planets must have failed, but we don't know about them because, well... They failed. 

I understand your perspective, but I think this place is more likely than you think."
AskReddit,fey1rw0,t1_feltjps,1579439666.0,"This is true. This is kind of unrelated but what is mysterious to me is how you find a brain. You and me both didn't exist for a super long while, and never had any connection to this world until one day, we did. It's not strange in the sense that you understand the process (creatures are born and a consciousness is created), but the assignment of consciousness is so trippy to think about. The idea of finite consciousness in the world is flawed because you can create living things at will, but who gets to be what isn't even a defined question because it makes no sense, yet. What stopped ""my"" consciousness from becoming an ant? Nothing. Just pure chance; statistics.

I'm bad at explaining my thoughts but consciousness is the most wacky thing I know, and I'm not religious or anything in the slightest."
