politics,ff0959e,t1_ff047wr,1579466540.0,"Politics isn’t so black and white (no pun intended). There isn’t an objective good or bad party. You choose based on which one fits your personal values best. So, nobody is an idiot simply because they prefer one side over the other. That being said, it is idiotic to support a party that conflicts with your supposed values.

I don’t know your cousin, but him being a legal immigrant does not conflict with him being a Trump supporter at all. Trump supporters aren’t xenophobes. They just want illegal immigration stopped. If you disagree, then that’s fine. The repercussions of overlooking illegal immigration must not bother you if that’s the case.

It is my opinion, and that of many right-wingers, that the Democrats use minorities simply for the advancement of their own party. They have not provided any real benefit for those communities and the fact that people prop them up as champions of minorities is ridiculous. They don’t care about immigrants. They don’t care about minorities. They care about themselves.

So, while I don’t consider leftists to be idiotic for supporting the Democratic Party, I do think a great number of them are idiotic for supporting them for reasons that aren’t even true, and equally idiotic for hating Republicans for reasons that also are not true."
