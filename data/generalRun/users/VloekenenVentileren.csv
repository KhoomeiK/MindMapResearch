Super sweet guy but had absolutely no sexual moral compass. He'd misinterpreted body language and see that as a green light to initiate sex. He did not understand a no, because saying no had never stopped anything sexual in his childhood either.

Please let that last sentence sink in. 

Anyway, dad stays in jail, since there's footage of him fucking his 1 year old baby. Mother gives birth in jail and then gets released, because no evidence against her. She gets back four of the kids, including the newborn and decides to visit her son who lives with us. Who, we gathered by this time, she had pretty much sexually abused from his birth. We absolutely love this guy but he's a broken husk because of what she did. We can't leave him alone because he'll rape fellow patients. Not out of malice, just doing he does not understand how sex works in any way. 

Mother visits and she's the piece of shit you'd imagine. The newborn gets zero attention from here the entire time she's with us. The kids is 6 months old or something and you already see he's not quite right. He screams non-stop while he's there. Can you imagine how we, careworkers for the other son are feeling? We loathe this women, we don't even won't to let her in. But we're professionals and we receive them. We're glad when she leaves. 

A day later I (social worker) get a phone call. She feels mistreated. We weren't nice to her. She's pissed. I just had to sit there and take it and blurt out my standard 'well, it must not be what it looks like, we were busy' sort of bullshit sentences when I just want to shout out: ""YOU MESSED UP ALL NINE OF YOUR KIDS AND PROBABLY MOLESTED MOST OF THEM AS BABIES.

AskReddit,feyjoh5,t3_eqx8mr,1579446413.0,"Honestly, eating disorders are shit. Every-time I see family trying to get involved (in their very meaningful way) it just backfires like hell. It doesn't help that those with an eating disorder will lie and manipulate like crazy to get their way, so family and friend are often left feeling like they were cheated, their trust broken. They get angry and frustrated and that in turn leads to the person itself feeling shit, queue more eating disorder and the whole cycle repeats itself.

I think eating disorders are really deceptive, in that it looks like someone is perfectly normal, they just don't eat as much, while in fact their whole psyche is sick in a way that's not straightforward nor easy to understand. It's easier to see someone is sick if they are raving on the street about werewolf vampires that drive electric cars as a part of the Illuminati ploy to conquer earth, but an anorexic is just as ill mentally.

Getting them better is better suited to a team of professionals, while family should stay involved in a low-intensity, non-therapeutic way. Just being there, letting the other person feel loved and not fall into the trap of being angry or frustrated when something doesn't work out. Remember that you are dealing with a very sick person, whose mental health will make them do stupid shit that will hurt you. This is easier said than done."

Look, you don't have to convince me of anything. I'm not a green puppet. I simply do not feel very comfortable with the idea that we're stocking nuclear waste for the next 10.000 years. That being said, realism is needed. If they have to stay open for a while longer, so be it. I get that closing them could emit more carbon etc. than letting them run. But we all have to be honest when we ask ourselves if enough steps are being made at a political and economical level to close that divide."

I'm guessing I'm the opposite of you on that matter, then. I do not feel comfortable leaving nuclear waste for future generations. Also, safety seems to be a problem in Belgium with nuclear reactors and one can only imagine what a nuclear leak would to in a high density populated country as Belgium. 

The sad part is that the pro-siders have a point, closing the plants will lead to higher prices and more emissions. But I do feel that's because nothing is being invested in green energy.   
In the end electricity is a business like any other, and we know the politicians are slaves to economy. We won't be closing them in 2025, I'll bet anything on it."

I myself am expecting the nuclear reactors to stay open for longer.  There is a lot of lobbying for it (radio ads and the likes) and the more right wing parties are definitely for it. I'm pretty sure the necessary informal deals are already made, five years is not too long away. Basically we won't be investing in green energy now, so when 2025 comes around, the politicians can say we are not prepared and closing them down will raise the electrical bill for everyone, raising public pressure against closing them."

thelongdark,fenb5w4,t3_eq2b25,1579280923.0,"Basically, you have an internal sleep clock that is pretty much 24 hours long. When you get sleepy is part of your internal clock (think morning people and night owls). What caffeïne does is  crossing the blood-brain barrier and binding to adenosine receptors, which are sleep inducing neuro-transmitters in the brain. The caffeine takes up a space, so to speak, but caffeine does not tell your adenoside receptors that it's time to sleep. The trouble is that you keep on making adenosine and it builds up. When the caffeine is out of your system, all that adenosine you have built up hits you full force.   
There is no escaping the adenosine.

Apart from that, you need sleep. Just pulling an allnighter is detrimental to your health and your ability to learn and memorize. Let's not even talk about days on end without sleep, you'll be a wreck from the first day on."
