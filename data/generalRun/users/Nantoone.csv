StarWarsLeaks,fgjapwo,t1_fgilctl,1580840280.0,"That script is really badly written. And RMB says the real script was one of the best scripts he read. And from the excerpts he read, it sounded really well-worded.

>Something HAPPENS to Ben

That is how the ""leaked"" script describes Ben's moment of redemption. Like, come on. Anyone who's read a book knows that isn't good writing."

edmproduction,fgf1rpo,t1_fgf1a7l,1580719737.0,"You could do that, there's sample packs that include slightly varied hits of the same instrument. If you're talking about different samples from different sample packs, you can do that too but you'll want samples that sound very similar. Having your different samples all being recorded the same way, in the same room, on the same drumset gives it the cohesiveness you hear in Porter and Madeon's songs."
edmproduction,fgf12x2,t1_fgf0oyd,1580718735.0,"Changing which samples you use. If you record 4 slightly different hits of the same hat and use those to make your hat line, it will give so much more life to it than using the exact same sample."
edmproduction,fgeaf9s,t3_exzdxc,1580695058.0,Probably the same way Madeon does it. He recorded a bunch of different hits in a studio he visited in Europe. But you could definitely find sample packs that include the same thing. The key is to have many different versions of the same hit. That's what gives it the variance that makes it sound real.
StarWarsLeaks,fgddar5,t1_fgdavxn,1580681309.0,Colin Trevorrow was originally going to write and direct Episode IX. This is concept art of the film he was going to make before he got fired and J.J replaced him.
GTA6,fgcxpew,t3_exs8ps,1580677139.0,"In the first portion of the game, you'd be a young father and small-time criminal in Liberty City in the 80's. Through a series of circumstances, you get caught into coke running and eventually move to Vice City as you begin to climb the drug ladder. Eventually, a competing cartel corners you and forces you to give yourself up to the authorities. You lose your money, your business, and your family.

40 YEARS LATER

You now play as the son of the character you played in the prelude. As an adult, he's a crooked cop in Liberty City, doing the same crimes his father once did. However, things change once you receive a sign that your father could still be alive. You travel to modern-day Vice City, pushing coke between Columbia and VC to climb the ranks once again, as you tread over the past, uncover old dirt, and realize your father may not be the man you thought he was."
