Ok, now that you've cut 30 billion, how are you going to cut the other 1,970 billion dollars?  Even then, cutting 2,000 billon dollars wouldn't bring spending down to levels seen in the 20th century. It wouldn't even be half of what the federal government spent in 2019.

worldnews,ffqw29x,t1_ffqcpdk,1580144944.0,"It is absurd to suggest that more taxes is the only way a nation can be great.  During most of the 20th century we had MUCH less government spending, so you're right, we should go back to that.  Of course you didn't consider overall government spending, did you? You just thought you'd cherry pick one tax rate and think you had a point. 

So now that we've agreed government spending is much too high and we should go back to how it was 50 years ago, the government is going to have to cut a lot of spending. My question to you is, what do you want to cut to get back to how it was back during the 20th century?  Or are you prepared to admit that referencing the old tax rate on the wealthy isn't relevant at all?"
