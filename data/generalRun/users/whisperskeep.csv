2- have u tried urban fantasy? like the dresden files? i can't follow harry potter or lord of the rings cause too heavy at times, but fantasy based on the here and now better grasp  like i love playing pathfinder but i have to stop and Google a lot of visual to follow 

8- can u recall what your family look like or s.o when they arent around u? or can u only give a base description.  like for example my husband has blue eyes and usally a beard, and my son is blue eyed and blonde...but that's all i can give you unless im looking right at them

sorry just happy i found fellow people like me, been alone with this for over 10years. my family sees in 3d and can't comprehend this. when my mom tries to get my opinion on how x will look in x location.  im like i have no idea, it looks nice? but thats it. meanwhile they can literly take an imagine and flip it and rotate it in thier mind. its amazing and im jealous"
