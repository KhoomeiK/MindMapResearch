AskReddit,ff1lr7e,t3_er3coe,1579481258.0,People crawling in small spaces. I read an article about a guy getting stuck in nutty putty cave and was stuck in such a small place they couldn’t get him out and he ended up dying there. They almost got him out but they pulley thing broke and wedged him even further in. My hands were sweating and my heart was pounding the whole time I read it. I don’t know what compelled this guy to crawl into such a small space!

AskReddit,fed9swl,t3_eohro9,1579004998.0,"Cats!! Also I’m a huge introvert, I rarely talk to people so this gives me a chance to practice talking to people. I always get really nervous when I actually reply to something and see that someone commented back. The first 5 seconds of opening the response is me being like “please don’t be a mean comment, please don’t be a mean comment”. But So far I’ve had really kind replies and that is giving me the confidence to one day try to talk to people around me."

toastme,febtco6,t3_eoai6b,1578962471.0,I’m 36 and just asked my mom if I could move back in with her. I’m also divorced and also sadly widowed. My life is not even close to being ok. I know how you feel. You are a great lookin man and I’m sure you will find a girl that is perfect for you. Don’t give up. You got this. It’s hard to make it on your own these days and asking for some help is perfectly fine. You’ll bounce back before you know it!
cats,febom67,t3_eo8moa,1578961046.0,Which one is the friendliest and most lovable? Which One is the trouble maker? Which one is the leader or boss of them all? I’m just Curious about their different personalities.
cats,feblqzs,t3_eoadag,1578960104.0,What a gorgeous kitty!!
toastme,fdzwgje,t3_en6mkm,1578797454.0,"Dude, you just described my life. I went through everything you did too. How did you get off the dope? I’ve been taking Kratom for the past year and it helps but I can’t seem to just walk away completely. I’m doing better now than I ever have before. I now have a place to live and a job and I’ve cut back to only doing it like twice a week. Anyways, enough about me this is your toast. Great job dude!! I’m so proud of you. It’s not easy pulling yourself up from the depths of hell. I truly wish you the best and hope you never have to go down that road again. People like you really inspire me and motivate me. It’s so beautiful to know that there is hope out there. I cannot even begin to express how proud I am of you. And jealous too. I hope one day I can say the same thing! Keep doing whatever it is you’re doing. It’s addicts need to hear more about people recovering. Thank you for your post."
UnresolvedMysteries,fdsw6i7,t1_fdmw5n5,1578708728.0,"I didn’t mean that in a negative way, I meant the way he was in court came off in such a negative way that it didn’t help his case at all. As of today I think they are innocent. I wasn’t trying to come off in a negative way about it. With that aside, you actually got to meet him? That is incredible. Did he talk to your whole class giving a speech? What was that like? I’ve heard he is a very kind person and everyone who has met him has said nothing but good things about him. What did he talk about to you guys?"
AskReddit,fdn2ko6,t3_elzbiv,1578575393.0,I think it’s absolutely beautiful. It sparkles when light hits it and there is a peaceful and quiet feeling when there’s a lot of it. I use to live in Ohio where I was born and raised and 2 years ago I moved to Florida and I didn’t think I would miss it this much. Christmas just isn’t the same without it. I miss wearing comfy pajamas and having a big fluffy blanket being curled up on the couch drinking hot chocolate next to the fire place and reading a good book or watching movies during blizzards. I don’t miss having to clean the snow of car though before work and shoveling it though and having to drive in it. But other than that I love snow and I miss its beauty.
TrueCrime,fdn1r5z,t1_fdmlqth,1578574647.0,"I just read Jaycee dugards book and I read the whole thing in 1 day. I couldn’t put it down. It was a crazy ride. I feel so bad for her, but on the other hand I’m really happy that she was kept alive and as time went on he stopped raping her and even though it was a really fucked up situation, she loved her life as best as she could. It blew my mind that she was I think 30 something years old when she was finally found. She could have left so many times but they messed with her head so bad that she just accepted her life as it was. The fact that she kept positive and found ways to pass Time was just incredible. And when she had to give birth twice without being able to go to the hospital., the whole book was just great, and I love how it was written. I’m so glad she got her life back and was reunited with her family."
UnresolvedMysteries,fdlng6g,t3_els9ak,1578528003.0,"Man, I have bounced back and forth so many times on the west Memphis 3 and as of right now I think they are innocent. I thought they were guilty for a long time but honestly, I think it was the step dad and friends. I don’t think those kids were capable of what happened to those boys and jesses confession is what I think the result of low iq. That case has haunted me for years. But I still don’t like damions whole attitude. But then again I don’t know if I could blame him for the way he is. I would be bitter too. Those boys deserve justice. All of them."

UnresolvedMysteries,fdfu3gx,t1_fdfi0tl,1578370249.0,Wasn’t she a black belt or something in karate? I know a gun to your head will stop you from trying to defend yourself but this girl could definitely defend herself. This case puzzles me too and I would love to know what happened to her.

UnresolvedMysteries,fd66g48,t3_ej0d8v,1578186194.0,"I also think Delphi will eventually get solved. I think the police know way more than what we know. 
As for my long shot case I’m going to go with Blair Adams. I just feel like this wasn’t a case of mental health issues, that he truly was being followed to be murdered. It’s so frustrating to know that he will probably never get the justice he deserves."
