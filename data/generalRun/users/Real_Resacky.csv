theology,fcaq13h,t1_fcaooro,1577574301.0,"I don't think the devil can kill you, he can try to tempt you to let go of your soul, for a wager, a deal of some sort. If you allow the presence to get strong enough it can hurt you physically.

Teleportation as super natural occurrences, I believe demonic spirits can have this influence on the physical plane, there have been bibically written occurrences where Jesus helps people so deep in sin that they are possessed by demonic entities

&#x200B;

The concept of evil entities trying to do physical things is a very superstitious one that doesn't have a lot of theological backing as it is even discussed in science with hauntings and haunted houses/ghosts. But just know that one doesn't go from one day to the next being controlled or tortured/killed by the devil. They have to be dwelling in sin before this influence gets so powerful"
theology,fcanv7s,t1_fcamty3,1577572984.0,"This is from what I read in my sources

But the concept of the soul, theologically, is that the soul is a part of God, and God gave free will to our souls, making us in our own sense powerful to create and manipulate on the same plane as God. It is up to us what we do with our soul, if we wish to give it away to the devil in exchange for material goods then you very much can, as you can also be tortured or manipulated into giving it away, which is why witchcraft has a lot to do with sacrifices because animals souls are pure as they do not have freewill. This is why its emphasized to have a strong relationship with God, to not be tempted by these sinful natures

This can be seen as blasphemy because we are not God and we cannot behave like God but we have the same potential as God, but we only have a portion of the unlimited power he has.

Tying this with Christian doctrine: 
When you confess your sins and accept Jesus you activate in essence the unlimited power through Jesus of God, which is why priests and the disciples of Jesus were able to do some of the miracles that were performed of Jesus"

Context: the Devil is the concept that was mostly conceived by the catholic church solidifying his main role as some evil power, people misinterpreted this to being that he is the one that does the punishments in hell and that he is the one personally corrupting people to their downfall, as it is not stated in the bible, though he has been mentioned in jewish scripture and in Hebrew as ""sa-tan"" as it stands in literal translation to ""go against"" or ""the opposition""

Christianity: They believe the ""satan"" is a fallen angel from God's kingdom that which corrupted 2/3 of God's angels with him to try to create their own paradise on which they can rule themselves (This depiction of Lucifer the fallen angel varies depending on deviation and isn't supported by the catholic church as it has no mention within the bible and is mostly folklore). Later on earth the Satan introduces temptation and the first sin onto which mankind by eating the forbidden fruit, through Eve, then Adam.

Judaism: doesnt depict the devil as an evil figure and states that satan actually rules along side God, as he needs God's permission to act and do certain things, The devils role Jewish theology is that the devil is humanities accuser, of any wrong doings that humanity has committed and isnt worthy of God's grace. Note: Jews believe that God created everything, including Good and Evil, and that one shouldn't worry for satan's temptation as long as they stand with God and their self-improvement

Similarities:  A common example of both theologies referencing the devil is in genesis and the book of Job, where man commits the first sin and then The devil telling God to test the faith of Job to prove his authenticity towards his love.

Islam: They do believe in the devil, i also dont know much about islamic theology, but they refer to him as ""Iblees"" Or ""Shaitaan"" they basically believe the same foundational teachings as all Abrahamic religions do, they believe that he is an opposition of God wanting to tempt man into sin, he refuses to bow down to Gods creation, Adam, and gets demoted or sent down to earth, he accomplishes his goal in making man sin and the story of the Quran goes from there. Note: they do NOT believe this version of the devil to be an angel as their depiction of angels is that they have no free will and will always obey Allah, they believe the devil to be a mix between man and animal"
