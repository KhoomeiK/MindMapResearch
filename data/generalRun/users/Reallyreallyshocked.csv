I always try to help people out for free at work because I like to and it's usually something quick and I hate when they force me to take a tip. I hate gifts, even on xmas and birthdays, and I just want to help out! A smile is all I'm fishing for."
TooAfraidToAsk,ffvde1p,t1_ffu7ntx,1580261484.0,I work in the service industry (mechanic) and I'll do free things for people all the time if they are nice and if I can. I just don't want their money and I like to help/do nice things. A thank you and a smile is all I want in return and I hate when they try to tip me. I always will do quick things outside and they ask where the front is so they can pay and I tell them to just drive away and act natural haha

instantkarma,ffstru7,t1_ffst5yo,1580192175.0,You're not wrong but there is no good argument against universal health care. The deserving people getting helped will out weight people doing dumb things always. I can't even wrap my head around the fact that people can't afford to get limbs put back on or that people have to pay so much money to have a kid.

MechanicAdvice,feei2w1,t1_feddddb,1579034189.0,Okay. You will get some wear from the rear camber for sure and maybe a bit of wear from the fronts. Normally in the front you start to see wear around -0.8 to -1 degree camber. But if you rotate your tires it might not be too bad. Check tires periodically to see how things are going
MechanicAdvice,fecqn8j,t1_fecgtn9,1578981040.0,"It could be a tire pull but if it isn't you can compensate for the pull by adjusting the alignment. The lead should be slightly to the left or at 0 but it's 0.1 to the right. Could cause a slight pull to the right. You want lead to the left to make it want to pull left, which compensates for road crown which slants towards the ditch, making the car go straight. To adjust lead you will need cam bolts installed in the front end to adjust the camber."

The day after being able to smell it I would start to feel sick. Haven't had the flu since I was a kid (about 13 years) and I almost want to get sick so I can see if I can still smell it.
