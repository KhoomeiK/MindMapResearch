Just because of this unreasonable hate. Internet gives you opportunity to say anything. People don't even know the actual struggle to make such songs. Internet where songs having beautiful models and porn in them makes people think this should be in any music video. And they also think that giving useless hate comments make them feel cool and gives them attention. The more you give those idiots attention, the more and the louder they bark. This is the reality that every creator has to go through. They have to learn to not to give attention to them, and all we can give them is love and appreciation that will make them motivated and loved. And not feel bad about hate. They will feel that the hate is much less than love. That will make them feel loved."
