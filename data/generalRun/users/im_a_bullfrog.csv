AdultSelfHarm,ffvtx0h,t3_eve3yq,1580273144.0,"I cleaned up several times, and relapsed at 13, in my twenties,  and in my thirties.  . Every relapse shows that you are capable of stopping, because you DID stop for a period of time.

It's all good, just keep moving forward."

That kind of thing makes me spiral out of touch and be super upset, too. Sometimes I walk away (if I can) and wash my face or something before I come back to deal with the task."

CPTSD,ffs18a1,t3_euug6u,1580170662.0,"My experience was not as serious as yours, but I feel like I have been in charge of SOMEONE since I learned to cook, at about ten or eleven years old.

I miss relationships that can never be now. I miss a home I never had. I've had dreams where I ""felt"" what I never did. It's a strange sensation."

EDAnonymous,fff7j7e,t3_et7lrh,1579877682.0,"I sleep eat. And let me tell you, sleep clean-up-after-yourself is not really a thing. Youd likely have bowks, silverware,  food wrappers, etc either out or in the trash.  Just do a quick check"
