WritingPrompts,ff5d6f0,t3_erpai1,1579587986.0,"Arthur rubs his numb hands together, a futile reflex that did nothing to fight off the relentless cold. Staring into the tiny flame helped more, helping his mind escape the failing prison of his body. There was nothing to see looking up; the cloud cover never truly parted anymore. Nothing of note looking around, either; the endless snow had erased the whole world and left it blank. A whole city lay dormant around Arthur, and yet it was little more than irregular shapes beneath the snow cover; some buildings had actually collapsed under the endless snow, only for their wreckage to be reburied and forgotten. Those that remained could at least serve as shelter, if shelter had been on Arthur's mind. But for now, there is nothing but an old man alone with his paltry flame, and the memories he sees as it flickers closer and closer to oblivion.

He had only been 17 when the Rozenkhov Incident occurred; even halfway across the world, Arthur was always adamant that he had felt the shockwave from within his classroom. The media debated for years what had occurred: a secret military experiment gone wrong, or perhaps a colossal industrial accident. But debate as to the ""why"" faded as the implications of what had occurred became clear to scientists: by the end of that year, the average world temperature had dropped by 3 degrees. By the end of that same year, Arthur had asked out the woman he would one day marry. She said ""no"".

In the years that followed, the world underwent an upheaval unlike any in human history. With hard evidence that a extinction-level event was currently underway, governments worldwide closed entire industries in order to devote resources to chasing a solution to the problem. Any nation that did *not* sign on quickly found itself torn apart from within by its own citizen, desperate to avoid extinction in a decade or two. Arthur had managed to avoid the worst of it, attending a prestigious university that isolated ""the best and brightest"" from the negativity the apocalypse brings. Many students from that university would end up critical to the Phoenix and Ark projects; Arthur, on the other hand, majored in kinesiology with a minor in sleeping around. ""The end of the world"" did wonders for Arthur's social life, and he openly lamented when Restoration projects were announced. Elsewhere, the temperature kept dropping. The Amazon forest suffered its first cold snap.

It wasn't until Arthur's generation hit the workplace, the first generation that had been trained specifically to address this threat, that things began to look up. The Phoenix project was particularly promising: an attempt to reverse the Rozenkhov Effect itself, completely ""curing"" the world. With every country making their resources available, the project came together quickly under the management of the International Restoration Directive. Arthur managed to find employment with the IRD thanks to connections with his classmates, as one of the countless manual labourers needed to actually construct technologies that had never existed before. Seeing the Freeze from within the eye of the storm changed Arthur, who felt small and powerless against what was coming. He developed a drinking problem during this time period, regretting how his wasted youth left him with no skills that could meaningfully help the world. He watched the activation of the Phoenix Project from a local bar; the girl who had turned him down in high school was also in attendance. Both had been deeply changed by the cold years, and their new selves found they had much in common. As the temperature slowly climbed, they had their happiest times. They date for nine months before eloping on a July weekend, under a bright sun.

The IRD continued to monitor global temperature patterns, for any signs of trouble. Eighteen months after the Phoenix Project, they found it: the decline had already begun again, and this time there would be no attempting the same trick twice. The timeline was indeed longer now; they had bought themselves another three or four decades of time before terminal temperatures were reached. But the end was coming, and it was inevitable. Arthur terminates his position with the IRD, unable to handle the pressure of being associated with the project. He is provided the customary six months of therapy on exit.

Two years later, the IRD goes public with the controversial Ark project: the wholesale evacuation of Earth via a fleet of sleeper craft that would colonize a new world. It sounded like absolute science fiction, and the world did not respond well to the idea. Riots broke out internationally, as well as numerous attacks made on the IRD headquarters. Under siege, the IRD fights to sell the idea with facts: with their designed plan implemented over the next few decades, they believed that 82% of the Earth's human population could be saved along with a genetic archive of every species of plant and animal that had ever been identified. As horrified as humanity was with the prospect of evacuating their planet, the growing cold slowly stifled the riots more than anything else. That year, Arthur's wife gives birth to twins. He spent the rest of that night awake and crying, staring out at the snow.

The years begin to blur; the priorities of the world change entirely when the whole world was going to be left behind. Societies worldwide began to shift away from prioritizing personal gains, and borders behind to dissolve in the face of  necessity. Everyone does their part for the worldwide Ark project, motivated by the fear none dare voice: *What if I get left behind?* Arthur's wife dies of hypothermia after going outside in the middle of the night in her nightgown. A year later, Arthur burns the note she left behind to warm his hands on a particularly cold night. The twins are schooled in Ark construction exclusively.

Many years pass, and the snow begins to pile. Finally, the IRD gives the announcement that the target temperature had been reached and the arks would begin to launch. Group by group, people would recieve the notice that would take them to a new world. Arthur recieves his notice within a month, as does one of his twins. No amount of pleading with old friends can change the number of seats on the ark, so Arthur insists on trading places to keep the twins together. He is not the first nor the last to make this trade before the final ark launches. Arthur assures them that his name will be drawn again for sure, and he would find them on the other side.

It took two years for all the arks to launch. The IRD had artificially inflated the number of arks available in public communications, meaning nobody was aware that the final ark had launched until it had already cleared orbit. When the realization struck that they had been left behind on a world stripped bare, the remants of humanity on Earth went berzerk. Arthur barely survived the first few End Days, heading out of the city as IRD headquarters burned behind him. A man tried to jump onto Arthur's car as he drove away, sliding off ineffectually. He would end up the last human Arthur would ever see.

It was a full year before Arthur even attempted to return to a city, having discovered a well-stocked cabin to call home. He prepared for the worst, but found only silence; the riots had reduced the city to violent gangs raiding broken buildings. They had not been naturally selected for their cold weather adaptation skills, and as a result none of the ""winners"" survived that first lethal winter. Arthur moves into the city, spending time to properly insulate an old apartment and move useful supplies in. He spent his days looking through the photo albums left behind by the family that used to live here, wondering what they were like.

The final years passed. Arthur had not seen any sign of life besides himself since the riots, and his apartment filled with personal items that he scavenged from abandoned homes. It helped him feel alive, to be full of their stories even if there was nobody left to tell them to. Supplies become scarce as far as Arthur could safely travel, and the weather got steadily colder. A whole city's worth of fuel, and Arthur finally ran out. He understood what that meant.

And so Arthur now sits outside, burning the last of his fuel in a tiny gas lamp. It provides so little heat as to be meaningless, and Arthur feels his eyes get hazy. The cold isn't stinging so much anymore, and he begins to feel warmer than he has for years. He sits down in the snow in front of the little lamp, lifting the old photo book from where he had sat it down. Shivering violently, Arthur clutches the book firmly to his chest. ""You can't have this one,"" he whispers to the tiny flame. Seemingly offended, it flickers one last time and vanishes, leaving Arthur alone in the dark. Arthur closes his eyes and lets himself slowly fall sideways into the soft snow, sighing in relief. He is tired of the cold."

They stayed for in-game *years* in this alt timeline, to do ""the right thing"".

When they finally realized who he was meant to grow up to be, they had a real RP turn where the party put together how much of this kid had been established in the God of Murder's personality over the past two campaigns. That this kid they wanted to save, didn't have anyone who had saved him in their timeline, and the result was the most tortured and unhappy god that could exist.

...so they told the kid. They explained everything, the time travel, and everything ""he"" would grow up to do. And then they asked *him* the big question, which had not been what I was building towards: how could they *save the God of Murder.*

It changed the campaign entirely, and infinitely for the better. By the end, they convinced the God to stand down during the final battle by appealing to the child he once was. The plan he had put into effect couldn't be simply stopped, but he ended up trying to help them stop his own plans even at the cost of his own divinity.

In the end, the ex-God was a mortal who apologized for everything before leaving because he wanted to abandon his entire identity and try and lead one happy mortal life without his dark deeds looming overhead. There were heartfelt goodbyes, with the ex-God being so thankful... and after we were done, one of my players realized that the ex-God had also referred to things that only happened in the alt timeline.

NintendoSwitch,ff1zg0z,t1_ff1wbj1,1579489780.0,"The original version of Bloodstained on Switch was as close to unplayable as I would call a technically released game.

As it stands now, it sounds entirely playable. But also unquestionably inferior still, with a low total framerate that is noticeable and somehow also text glitches are being reported that weren't coming up before. Whether or not the input lag issues are completely fixed seems unclear still.

This is not a game that will be enjoyable with hitches and drops. Smooth gameplay is intended, and it's something you definitely want for this game. At the very least, I'd take a look at some in-game footage (any version) and imagine what it would be like trying to smoothly jump &amp;amp; dodge with *any* remaining degree of dropped frames or input lag."

I still came up short.

Now that time has passed, it's not the same complaints I have as when it launched. Are the graphics weak? Absolutely. Are the facial animation dismal, and does every asari have the same fucking face? Yes to both.

But I now realize that those are only symptoms of it being pushed out the door without the polishing work being done. And in this one, specific case? I've come to support that decision, which isn't something I thought I'd ever say about an EA management call like that. But that game was so flawed *in its core design* that no amount of polish was ever going to fix it. A story that didn't hold interest with characters that had no depth, all in a place that players held no attachment to... continuing a series that sold that immersion above all else. Critically tedious gameplay.

For the Mass Effect universe, the Enterprise has a number of technologies they don't: one huge one? *Sensors.* It sounds mundane, but ship detection in Mass Effect was limited to heat signatures. Starfleet sensors, on the other hand, can perform particle analysis at thousand kilometer ranges. That changes *everything* right there.

Don't forget transporter tech! Fuck shuttles, everyone is beaming now. And god help us when they combine that with mass effect fields somehow in use for weaponry.

Warp drive would be huge; it invalidates the mass effect relays entirely.

So you now have a Normandy SR3 that can fly straight to you no matter where you are, beam an eezo warhead directly onto your ship, and immediately fuck off before you're dead.

The SR2 has a *lot* less to offer Starfleet, from a technical perspective. *However,* the big ""if"" is eezo itself: if Starfleet got ahold of eezo, they'd do shit with it that would make a turian bend their knees backwards. They have abilities to manipulate objects on harmonic and elemental levels that no known race in the ME Milky Way ever had.

todayilearned,fepewot,t1_fepeha2,1579318789.0,"Blockbuster Online was heinously mismanaged; it was considered competition internally for the storefronts. Horror stories would abound of areas where Online was adopted, *so they'd lay people off in stores.* So every Blockbuster store, the fucking face of the brand, had every reason to undercut their own company's project. They'd be told to advertise it, and the area manager would throw out the flyers. And when it first launched, it also sucked. Hard. It was a few more years by the time they realized that Online wasn't a side venture but rather the future of the business... but by then, it was *way* too late to dig out of the customer perception hole they'd let their own stores dig for them.

Don't get me wrong; Blockbuster was *also* hated. But nobody really trusted Netflix at first either, and the idea of *waiting* for DVDs seemed absurd. Blockbuster may have been hated, but the system still worked at that point.

It's not until Netflix took a big enough bite out of them that they started scrambling *hard* to catch up, because it then became apparently Blockbuster hadn't been making enough money to stay operational *before Netflix even got involved.* And that's when the average person realized the whole thing was sinking and they bailed en masse."

But by the time Blockbuster started actually chasing Netflix, it was very well known that they were in huge financial trouble. Random people coming in would ask if the place would still be there when they came back to return anything; these weren't exactly ""business savvy"" types.

Nobody expected Blockbuster to do anything but fail. Any success was seen to be transparent and temporary, which it actually *was* so there was no strong counterargument. A better deal now that would lead to you getting fucked later isn't actually a better deal. People picked the ones who might stay open, and lo, they were right. Blockbuster was already selling off assets at that point; the damage was already done. All those ""deals"" just made creditors happier."

They had racked up *so much operating debt* that they would have had to claw back more customers from Netflix than they had on most good years. All their options were cheaper because they were all taken at a loss, trying to salvage market share. But it never could have lasted: operating all those stores was too costly. Even if everyone *had* jumped to Blockbuster and saved them, those deals would have all dried up the instant Netflix died.
