There is no absolute law in US, there is just subjective law, decided by specific persons at specific positions. If the FBI, which is responsible for exactly this topic, decides to not pursue, then no one else can. There is no way you get around that. That is why the law doesn't count in US. You can't enforce the law, you can just hope those responsible are taking it serious. If not, bad luck, you lose."
movies,fdjcs3k,t3_elgsup,1578465555.0,"So does that mean that all TVs are delivering the same result for the same settings values? Do the filmmakers make a special setup for every single TV or how does that work? I recently switched my huge TV to another huge TV and I got a complete different picture, no matter what settings I do, I can't make the picture like the old one. I don't say its worse, i just say its totally different. I have no idea how this ""technical"" should work."

The gin says, ""I give you 3 wishes"", and the guy said ""I want to have one arm like the other"" and *puff* both arms disabled, then he says ""No no other around!"" *puff* and now the arms are twisted around, still disabled! ""I think i am going crazy"" *puff*"

europe,fdgo8xk,t1_fdgcfv6,1578403816.0,"There is no paradox, there is only one if you make it. Of course you can't tolerant the intolerant. Simple as that. But you dont determine the intolerant by race or color or anything, it is determined by them ACTUALLY DOING intolerant actions, which is prevented through LAW, so there is no freaking paradox, beside if you imagine that the concept of LAW is a failure and we need to rethink how LAW works...... It is so stupid to say ""we tolerate the intolerant"" if we dont do that. If you break the law you go to the prison, we dont tolerate that you are intolerant. What you talk about is the subtile racism that one guy of group X makes a crime so being tolerant to people of group X is supporting the intolerant. Like the classic nazi strawman argument. Really sad that there are still adults on this planet who need to understand that."
