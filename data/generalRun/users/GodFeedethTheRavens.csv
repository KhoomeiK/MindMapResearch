Wolves would be a far more relevant study - highly social and intelligent animals without falling into the subtle cues humans might give them."

The point is that when researching this kind of thing, one must be aware of certain biases and oversights in the testing that might lead one to false conclusions.

But you already knew that."
todayilearned,ffxh8fc,t1_ffxfu98,1580325098.0,True.
todayilearned,ffxbxop,t1_ffxaqh2,1580322002.0,"Having looked into this before,

Alex was certainly an intelligent and interactive parrot; capable of, in the very least, remembering a number of vocalizations and having some association with those vocalizations.

But making claims as to Alex's individual level of sentience, and comparing those capabilities to humans developmental psychology is a bit premature. By my understanding, there wasn't 'enough' evidence to prove that Alex simply wasn't extremely well trained - Like the famous 'Counting Horse' that could seemingly calculate simple and complex mathematics on demand and answering with taps of his hooves all the while the horse was simply trained to tap it's hoof while its handler was looking down at the hoof.

So it's not that Alex wasn't a smart parrot rivaling young humans in cognitive ability; it's just that there wasn't enough evidence to prove such."

He can be such a know-it-all asshole and I didn't want him breathing down my neck about my build or playstyle.

news,ffutln8,t1_ffumscg,1580249095.0,"Imagine being told all your life that you're given every advantage in life over literally everyone else because you were born white and male - and achieving absolutely nothing. No education. No job. No wife. You come face-to-face with the mirror of reality to examine why you're such a failure.

And you come to the conclusion that it's because of minorities and women."
