noveltranslations,ffhc99d,t3_etgryl,1579929614.0,"There is still a lot of anger and resentment over the Japanese atrocities committed during WW2, and Japan's response (even today) on their use of comfort women during war is a very sore subject, especially with Korea. There's also the fact that Japan forcefully annexed Korea and would violently suppress the protests/independence movements.

Koreans have actually put statues commemorating comfort woman in front of Japanese diplomat buildings, and Japan demanded they take them down.

>The first iteration of the statue was unveiled in 2011, outside Japan's embassy in Seoul, sparking objections and demands that it be removed from the Japanese.

>In January, Tokyo recalled two top diplomats from South Korea after an identical statue was erected outside the country's consulate in Busan, on the grounds that the action breached a 2015 agreement between the two countries intended to settle the ""comfort women"" issue.

>Japan also halted talks on a planned currency swap and delayed high-level economic dialogue as part of an ""initial"" response to the statue, chief cabinet secretary Yoshihide Suga said.

This isn't limited to Korea either, the japanese/people of Japanese descent is to try and whitewash history,

>Approximately 20 Japanese Canadians showed up at the monthly parks, recreation and culture commission meeting to protest the prospect of a statue commemorating ""comfort women"".

>Peter Kohno, who has lived in Burnaby for 30 years, delivered a written statement to the Burnaby parks commission.

>""I am here to request that the municipal (sic) must not get involved in foreign affairs as a city,"" he wrote.

>The statue would create resentment between Korean and Japanese Canadians in the city, he added, and the city might be liable for anything that happened due to what he termed a ""political time bomb.""

>If a comfort women statue is justified, then the city should also erect statues for Vietnamese women raped and killed by the Korean army during the Vietnam War, and Japanese women raped by American soldiers after the Second World War, he wrote.

TheGreatWarChannel,ffbay4w,t3_esm4b9,1579757965.0,"Runners were widely used during WW1, though it was a very dangerous job. It's actually how Hitler got his Iron Cross.

>Even though field telephones were widely used for the first time during World War I (1914–18), they relied on copper wire lines, which were often damaged or unreliable, or simply unavailable as troops advanced. Radio technology existed, but was generally regarded as too insecure for frontline use. Hence, most armies still made extensive use of runners.

>On battlefields dominated by automatic weapons and trench warfare, as well as the first widespread use of artillery and air attacks, runners faced one of the most dangerous jobs: they had to leave the relative safety of a trench, bunker or other shelter, and carry messages to other positions. For the same reasons, officers could not be sure that their message had been delivered until a runner returned to their unit. Runners were frequently decorated for bravery: for instance Adolf Hitler, who was a runner in the Bavarian Army during World War I, was wounded twice and received both the Iron Cross first class and second class during the war.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runner_(soldier)

The other methods have problems as well.

> “A matter of life and death: Battles are won and lost on the strength of an army’s ability to communicate on the battlefield. On the Western Front the British Army hoped wireless radio and telephones would keep its rear-echelon commanders in touch with their front line troops. But when the shelling started these lines of communication were all too easily broken or intercepted, and carefully laid plans could quickly descend into chaos. In the thick of battle officers in the trenches were often in need of a Plan B.
> 
> **Telephones and telegraphy**: The telephone was the preferred means of communication in World War One. Its immediacy allowed commanders to give orders directly to those on the front line. The telegraph, meanwhile, was incredibly effective at sending a message over distance, but each one had first to be written out, transmitted and then transcribed by the receiving operator. Both telephone and telegraph were lighter and more portable than radio, but depended on landlines which were unreliable. Lines broke for many reasons, including the clumsiness of soldiers and enemy fire, and it was not uncommon for signallers to fix 40 cable breaks per day.
> 
> **Runners**: Red badge of courage. Soldiers employed as runners had one of the most dangerous jobs in the war, as they had to leave the relative safety of the trenches and cross open ground. Exposed to enemy sniper fire, death was a constant threat. Runners were comparatively slow, often reaching their destination with messages that were out-of-date and inaccurate. But they were able to read maps, think on their feet and adapt to the changing circumstances around them. Speed and fitness were key, and as runners often worked in pairs the value of comradeship was highly prized. Many were decorated for their bravery. Runners wore red armbands but, as infantrymen, were required to carry weapons. They were, though, excused from carrying the full rifleman’s kit. When telephones lines were down it often fell to man or man’s best friend to fill the breach.
> 
> **Dogs of war**: Around 20,000 dogs served during World War One. Until the War Dog School of Instruction was set up in 1917, they were mostly family pets donated to the war effort or strays recruited from pounds. Dogs were sent out during barrages or under machine gun fire when conditions were considered too dangerous for human messengers. Faster and lower to the ground, they were less likely to be shot and could cross most forms of terrain. Trained to return one-way to their keeper’s station, they could cover 10-15 miles in one to two hours. But the companionship of dogs was so highly valued in the trenches that men would often offer to deliver messages in their place.
> 
> Visual Signalling:
> 
> **Flags**: Lightweight silk flags were portable but needed daylight and good visibility. Messages were easily intercepted by the enemy, and flags fell out of use after 1916.
> 
> **Lamp**: Signals could be sent 24/7, but attracted enemy sniper fire. Lamps needed oil, gas or a battery, but were easily transported between locations.
> 
> **Heliograph**: Flashes of sunlight were sent as signals using a mirror. Heliographs were cumbersome and only useable in daytime, but with larger mirrors were visible up to 100 miles.
> 
> These three forms of signalling were each based on Morse code and required a trained signaller and a trained receiver, with a telescope, pencil and notepad, at either end. Visual communication was more immediate than conveying messages by runner, but by its very nature could give away the position of your unit, and signallers often found themselves exposed to enemy sniper fire.
> 
> **The problem with radio**: Radio, patented by Marconi in 1896, was still in its infancy during World War One. It was used throughout the war, but it would be years before it became truly reliable and secure. In 1914 the Army’s longwave wireless sets were heavy, fragile and expensive. They did become smaller but not as small as the pool of operatives trained to use them. As radio transmissions were extremely vulnerable to enemy interception, elaborate codes had to be used, which slowed everything down.
> 
> 
> **Limited Communication with Aircraft**: Aircraft flew “contact patrols” to observe the forward movement of troops. They were only fitted with transmitting wireless sets, as receivers added too much weight to the airframe. Aircraft could also drop messages near a headquarters or friendly position. Troops on the ground used various methods, such as signal lamps, panels, and flares, to send messages to aircraft.
> 
> **Unresolved Problems**: Despite these tools, communication often broke down between the attacking infantry and their headquarters in the rear. When this happened, commanders did not know the location of their troops and were unable to support them with accurate artillery fire, ammunition, or supplies. This failure in communication was never fully solved during the war.” [4]

>In 2003, the governments of the US, Britain, and Spain proposed another resolution on Iraq, which they called the ""eighteenth resolution"" and others called the ""second resolution."" This proposed resolution was subsequently withdrawn when it became clear that several permanent members of the Council would cast 'no' votes on any new resolution, thereby vetoing it.[1] Had that occurred, it would have become even more difficult for those wishing to invade Iraq to argue that the Council had authorized the subsequent invasion. Regardless of the threatened or likely vetoes, it seems that the coalition at no time was assured any more than four affirmative votes in the Council—the US, Britain, Spain, and Bulgaria—well short of the requirement for nine affirmative votes.[2]

e: It seems there wasn't really a national flag.

>Austria-Hungary did not have a common flag (a ""national flag"" could not exist since the Dual Monarchy consisted of two sovereign states). However, the flag of the ruling Habsburg Dynasty was sometimes used as a de facto national flag and a common civil ensign was introduced in 1869 for civilian vessels. Until 1918, the k.u.k. War Fleet continued to carry the Austrian ensign it had used since 1786; and the regiments of the k.u.k. Army carried the double-eagle banners they had used before 1867, as they had a long history in many cases. New ensigns created in 1915 were not implemented due to the ongoing war. At state functions, the Austrian black-yellow and the Hungarian red-white-green tricolor were used.

>Austria was represented by the black-yellow flag. The Hungarian half of the state, on the other hand, legally had no flag of its own.[210] According to the Croatian–Hungarian Settlement (art. 62 and 63), in all joint Croatian and Hungarian affairs, symbols of both Croatia and Hungary respectively had to be used. For instance, whenever the joint Hungarian-Croatian Parliament held its session in Budapest, both the Croatian and Hungarian flags were hoisted on the parliament building in Budapest.[210][211][212] In Vienna, in front of Schönbrunn Palace, the black and yellow flag was flown for Cisleithania (Austrian half), while both Croatian and Hungarian flags were flown for Transleithania (Hungarian half).[212] Hungary proper used a red-white-green tricolor defaced with the Hungarian coat of arms, sometimes used to represent the entirety of the Lands of the Hungarian Crown.
