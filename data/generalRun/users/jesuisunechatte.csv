Blep,fffzskw,t3_et90ko,1579895377.0,Please be careful of that collar. It will be a straggle hazard. Collars should never be that loose on a cat or dog.
cats,fep58yt,t3_eq2zrv,1579312419.0,"I have been fostering for 7 years, 3 of which I was in college while fostering. I personally do not adopt to college students unless I feel like they understand the pet is for life. And I am reassured that the parents of said college student is okay with the cat living with them after graduation. I see it happening too often where college students will irrationally adopt and then end up having to dump their pets back at the shelter because they graduated and their parents won’t let them bring the cats when they move back in with mom and dad. So my question to you is what are your plans after graduation? Clearly you have gotten this pet against your parents wishes. What’s your plan when you HAVE to move back home?"

TwoXChromosomes,fdkkxpb,t3_elmfsz,1578505708.0,"I am so proud of you and you have inspired me! I am completely the same way, I never speak up at the doctors even when I feel like I didn’t get the care I needed. The doctors always come in and sees me for no longer than 5minutes. I recently had to go in for multiple ultrasounds and I had to go see an OBGYN for endo pain that started to develop a year ago. She examined me for about five minutes and told me to just deal with the pain and left. I paid $200 for that exam and on top of that I paid $400 for those ultrasounds and was told to just fucking deal with the sharp stabbing pain in my abdomen. All that money spent and nothing was resolved."
