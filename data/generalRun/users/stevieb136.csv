motivation,ff5r9hn,t1_ff5quje,1579607116.0,"Trust me I completely understand the struggle. I coach clients on a daily basis in a very similar situation as yourself. It’s about starting small, maybe find time for 1 session per week or find activities which you enjoy doing and find time for that once or twice per week. Once this becomes a habit and easy to sustain, build on it, add another training day and so on. You only need to exercise or train 2-3 times per week for around 1 hour with good nutrition to see fantastic results. Good luck. 👍🏻"

WeightTraining,ferj7x4,t1_feri0fw,1579354582.0,"Because resistance training is more taxing and requires more energy. So if you do your cardio first especially if it’s HIIT, then you will be using energy which could be better utilised focusing on progressive overload with your compound lifts. If you’re training correctly, putting emphasis on compound lifts then doing these first and cardio after is a more effective way to structure your programme to ensure progression."
bodybuilding,feql8gb,t1_feqkpks,1579343125.0,Body recomposition is something many people struggle with. I made this video for those people to make the process really easy to understand.
WeightTraining,feq0rt4,t1_fepoywo,1579335714.0,"20-30 minutes is just a guideline. It could be 10 minutes HIIT or 15-20 minutes LISS. It’s entirely up to the individual and the time that person has to train. When I personally was leaning out, I would train 3 days per week, 45 min - 1 hour resistance training and finish with my 20-30 minutes cardio. This was only around 4.5 - 5 hours per week spent in the gym, which isn’t excessive, and I got great results. I do have a video on my YouTube channel on how to structure your training programme and split if you’re interested."
