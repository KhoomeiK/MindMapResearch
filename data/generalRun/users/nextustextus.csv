Specto was a good one for me. And there was another one that almost everybody had used at one point, but can't for the life of me remember the name right now. And I had a smattering of other add-ons for sports and documentaries etc, etc. I think the main thing that bugged me was that when an add-on did fail, I didn't always know where to find what I needed to replace it..

Edit: I just don't relish the idea of going back to Kodi just yet, although who knows in the long run, cause in the end I'm gonna follow the sources. I just don't understand why there hasn't been some improvement in android app department as far as the lesser watched shows. There's gotta be sources out there somewhere. And from what I'm reading, Real Debrid isn't much better as far as that goes, in that it just gets you tons more links for the mainstream shows but still not much for an old episode of ""All in the Family"" for instance 😉"
