AsABlackMan,fdjyj2f,t1_fdih3wc,1578491455.0,"That is not true. Black panther definitely made it more popular and yes black people can be racist and prejudice like everyone else. There are plenty of black people!e who were looking into there roots long before. I have seen them spoke to them debated with them.  My family did the DNA test thing way before black panther. That movie just made it into a thing to do at that time. Besides even of it was a stupid movie that inspire someone to look into there heritage so what. It is our right. If it takes a movie for foolish black people to realize where there family came from so be it.

 I am sorry that you had to deal with racism. You have to remember black Americans have been cut off from Africa. I my self grew up Christian. My dad is a pastor. African culture is evil to them. They think its all black magic and voodoo. Its getting better but this religion has done a number on black people. I only realized this after i let that go"

AsABlackMan,fdgv1lc,t3_el6m8g,1578409030.0,"Although it is true, it is still ignorant. Most Africans dont know the history of black Americans. I know that from working with a few African immigrants in the past. They think we just tossed our heritage to the side. They dont realize it was literally stripped from us. Even now we get shit about it. Black people are the only group in this country like this. We just want to know where we came from. We dont want it to end with slavery."
unpopularopinion,fdgp6du,t1_fdg7ztx,1578404605.0,"I should not have said ""come from"" that is wrong. I would never say I'm from Africa. I would say America. Still black people seem to be getting more push back then any on this.  Even white people in America don't seem to want us to refer to our African history. Other people in other countries don't realize what America is. A country of immagrants. Or descendents of. They probably don have to track down their family history. That's a blessing."
unpopularopinion,fdg3tdp,t3_el2zao,1578378954.0,True. Black people were brought here as African slaves and stripped of all culture and identities and made to conform. Now we can't refer to our African roots at all and at the same time be ridiculed for being proud of our blackness(not saying you are doing that now. My opinion is that we as black Americans dont want our heritage to end with slavery. We want know where we came from. No one is going to stop us from doing that. Everyone in Americans gets to know and claim and even be proud of where they came from but black Americans.
