Three times.

Everybody against reforming SCOTUS says we shouldn't politicize the judiciary branch. Well, guess what? It's been politicized for at least the last 20 years."

politics,fg1heok,t3_ewdbvg,1580427154.0,"It was wrong for the House managers to take the stance that all the evidence given through the House inquiry is enough to convict, because Trump's council keeps hammering that point as a defense against allowing witnesses. They should be saying ""we drafted articles of impeachment based on the testimony available at the time, but more has been revealed since then and that information needs to be on record in this trial""."

Of course, if you have the ambition, you can grow it yourself, but that takes time and money most don't have to spare.

Dispensaries are popping up everywhere - I have 4 within a 10-mile radius of me - but most have to stick to medical use only until adult-use licences are easier to obtain."

Can you tell me any reason why anyone would need to own an assault weapon aside from wanting to kill as many people as possible in the shortest amount of time?

And don't say ""go to a shooting range"", because then we might as well be talking about a fucking Nerf gun."

Has anyone ever taken more than 50 lives from the 32nd floor of a hotel with a bolt-action rifle? How about more than 40 in a nightclub?

Assault weapons are dangerous and unnecessary. They have no justifiable reason to exist outside of military applications.

You know what else is dangerous and unnecessary outside of military applications? Grenades. Rocket launchers. Landmines. All of those are banned from sale to and possession by civilians (unless they're deactivated), and have been for years. Has that led to every type of weapon being banned?"
