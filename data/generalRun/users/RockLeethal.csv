fireemblem,ff7q0ss,t1_ff7pdel,1579655559.0,"I feel like making it a monthly thing would be interesting. Or better yet, keep durability, but make all the relics regenerate a bit every month (10~ durability?).  They do appear to be 'living' weapons, stuff like Aymr and the Lance of Ruin in particular. Helps keep the balance of the game but makes the relics actually something you want to use (I don't think I ever used the special combat arts except at the end of my VW and CF runs)."
fireemblem,ff7p7j3,t1_ff7lrwx,1579654985.0,"6 times would be far too much, as thats the equivalent of using up your entire weapon each battle. 1 or 2 seems far more reasonable."
WatchPeopleDieInside,ff7h0fu,t1_ff6g7u3,1579649345.0,"depends on the teenager. some people can do a few laps around a parking lot or deserted backroad and figure it out in a few days. others might cope with stress and sudden changes on the road badly, others might not, much like with adult drivers. As long as it's in a safe environment, it's better to teach them earlier so they aren't in their mid twenties unable to drive (if owning their own car is something they would ever want or they are in a place where getting your license is more necessary)."
WatchPeopleDieInside,ff7g3v6,t1_ff6svcn,1579648753.0,"thanks for putting the feeling into words. I used to be punished or yelled at when I was upset if my parents were pissed, told not to 'mope' or 'pout' so I learnt to force a fake smile (because anything less was being mopey in their eyes) and just shrug it off entirely. Didn't help that I never had any kind of meaningful connection with my dad with anger and control issues who has never taken the time or effort to try and build a relationship with his son. 

My current girlfriend is pretty perceptive and has pointed out that when I'm pissed or upset my face just freezes into a stony neutral expression, and how I try to avoid stressful and tense situations, because there was no confronting my parents growing up - any word uttered while they were pissed (which again, was often) was considered an affront or act of defiance to them and they'd be quick to mete out punishment or escalate the shouting into screaming. I don't even know how to confront my own emotions because I've never really had any kind of parental figure I could talk to or vent to, so I've always just bottled up my emotions. 

I've been thinking a lot lately about how I'd never want to be a parent like that, but did anybody? It's scary that I might become a shitty parent like that in the future."

fireemblem,ff5kjmc,t1_ff4va2a,1579597300.0,"maybe they only have a limited amount of ""dragon mass"". So when they fully transform, all their reserve dragon mass is used to maintain the big body. But they can expend say, a quarter of it to stretch their arm out real far."
