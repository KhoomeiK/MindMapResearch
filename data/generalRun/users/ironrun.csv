college,feyo4tt,t3_eqx0jh,1579448113.0,"If you're going to be a STEM major, make sure you take these APs:

Statistics
Physics
Calculus AB/BC
Possibly chemistry - this one is definitely necessary if you're going to medical school

All of these classes are pretty much universally needed for a STEM major, so taking them and getting credits will benefit you greatly in terms of graduating college faster. I won't say other APs are useless, but often they don't count for credit.

Edit: Language credit might also be required for you to graduate. Maybe check at your dream schools and see if this is common, then decide whether taking language in high school will be beneficial. Spanish or French classes might be a good filler course to take with some other APs to lighten the load."
genetics,fektn47,t3_epm0k2,1579207358.0,"Ask your PI if they have any projects they've put on the back burner. They'll probably have something you're interested in that relates to the research you've already been conducting. No harm in checking it out and your PI would likely be happy to get something off their plate - but you should be cautious that they're not just trying to pawn off work to you. Make sure you know exactly what the project would entail, that it interests you, and that it meets he grant requirements before agreeing."

college,fdirypx,t3_elbvr8,1578449708.0,"I took 19 credits last semester and have a research position which is about 30-40 hours a week, so I was pretty much in the exact same boat. My only ""saving grace"" advice is to study all your subjects every night after class. Even if you aren't assigned a books' practice problems, do them for each chapter. When test time rolls around, you should be reviewing for a few hours to prepare, not learning anything new.
This is the single most critical thing I learned last semester (I'm also a freshman) because I hadn't realized you're expected to study on your own time. I'm pissed no one mentioned it and I had a harsh awakening when preparing for my first rounds of tests.
Best of luck."
