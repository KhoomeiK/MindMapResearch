aww,ffm4kif,t1_ffllefw,1580048408.0,"I was put into an med induced coma-type thing once after a very major surgery. I didn't know they were going to do that & coming out of it after 24 hours was weird. I expected to  wake up in the recovery room, but instead as I was first able to see, I saw my mom sitting at the foot of the bed but she looked veeerrry tiny & far away for awhile. It was a bit surreal."
aww,ffm2hcz,t3_eu2mde,1580047480.0,"Gorgeous stoned kitty & LUV her name. I know I'm being nosy (can't help it) but exactly why did she require dental surgery? Had to have one of our  cat's prolapsed rectum put back in once, but not not anything of a dental nature."

I think it would be quite entertaining to see an eagle try to make off with an elk carcass. Obviously, I'm easily entertained. Lol!"

Awwducational,fenemlw,t1_femzyfg,1579283038.0,"LOL! I can't help thinking about the humans frantically looking for their car keys & their money- maybe even accusing another nearby human of filching their things & getting into a heated arguement, or even a knock-down-drag-out bcuz of it. The scenario in my head is quite hilarious. Obviously, I'm easily entertained."
Awwducational,fenc09v,t3_eq1iae,1579281441.0,I saw one of the BBC nature docs abt. birds & they showed all the work a Bowerbird goes thru to win a female's affection. It's amazing how creative those little guys are!
whatsthisbird,fenaz44,t1_fen0hcv,1579280807.0,"OMG! My daughters had a Quaker parrot for awhile in the 90's. It was very noisy with a harsh, raucous call. My girls & I liked the bird they named Erin but my husband insisted that we find Erin a new home. Until u said ""Quaker"" I didn't recognize them as the same. The thing is tho, in my memory, which is shoddy at best, Erin was a darker, richer green & not quite as big. However, Erin might have been a juvenile. I dont think we were ever told her/his age."
whatsthisbird,fen9wqz,t1_fen00vr,1579280145.0,"Thanks for the link. It was an interesting read. The birds are beautiful, & I'm sure, fun to watch. It boggles my mind how they managed to acclimate to New York winters & the lack of food during that season. I'm glad they found a haven on their own, where they can thrive & are not another invasive species disrupting the local environment."

Yeah, they aren't the cuddly-wuddly type really ate they!? If u do try to pet it or scratch it behind its ears (if u can find them- its tricky), they leave a puddle of ocean water, sand & no-see-ems."

No offense, but I cant stand that term for a men's sleeveless undershirt. I just think there could be a less violently graphic name for it."

AccidentalCamouflage,fdn6g4h,t3_elncj6,1578578584.0,That breed (I know the name but can't spell it) is so beautiful. One of my doctors has one that follows him to visit each patient. Such a sweet dog. His/her  (I've never tried peeking so I'd know- perhaps I should)  name is Trek. Though going to this particular doc is kinda stressful so I really look forward to seeing Trek.

cute,fde6wko,t1_fdds4zo,1578332503.0,"Such a good looking dog! When we lived out in the country several eons ago, our red & white Husky got to our ""blonde"" cockapoo. When our cockapoo was in heat we usually kept them apart but that time she hadn't shown any signs of being in heat yet. Anyway, the results of that tryst were the craziest looking pups. The litter looked as if ""Nature"" had some odds & ends spare parts lying around & decided to cobble together a litter that inherited their father's adorable Husky derpiness. The only things they had in common was they were all a rich black (go figure) with white patches & every one had a white tipped tail. There were 9 pups. Some had blue eyes, some brown & there was at least one with a brown & a blue. We had been speculating about their looks during  Sunshine's pregnancy but we were completely surprised that they all were mostly black. Though they looked like they had been pieced together with spare parts, we had no problem finding them good forever homes. Were there any other all white ones besides ur gorgeous girl?"

Ever since I was quite young I have enjoyed being around senior citizens & I like to listen to their stories. So many things they have experienced in their long lives. I was always extremely close with my paternal grandparents. They raised me a large portion of my childhood, but they died many years ago. Now I'm a grandparent of 2 young boys.
