Most don't want to decipher what ""renaissance"" or ""baroque"" or ""romantic"" individually mean, how they are different from each other. Pictures are eye food, and while some will ponder on the fine details of the use of different kind of pepper, some are content with wolfing down popcorn. Personally, i'm that way with food, but with pictures it breaks my heart a little. I fully understand it, but it breaks my heart."
