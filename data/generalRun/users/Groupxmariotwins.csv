As aforementioned, PETA is not me and I am not PETA. However, the actual backlash from non-vegans about PETA is generally misconstrued and disingenuous. There's a lot of disinformation out there because it helps people with their cognitive dissonance towards vegans.

todayilearned,ffe5ole,t1_ffe59kx,1579837368.0,"The context you think is there is not accurate. I know what you are trying to get at it. You can humanely kill something, perhaps because it is dying and crying out in pain for a release, but you cannot humanely 'slaughter' something. The key word is slaughter. Because we are quite literally bringing them into existence and then taking them out of it, all without consent (forced breeding and taking of their life, slaughtering). The critical context is that we are killing them for our own selfish purposes. You cannot tell a person that I want your life but it's ok I'm going to do it in a way that decreases or eliminates suffering and somehow give ourselves a pat on the back."
todayilearned,ffe4zab,t1_ffe49ha,1579836838.0,"There's a difference between being killed in a way that provides less pain and claiming 'humane slaughter'. Also, context and intent/motive is a thing. You cannot humanely kill anything that doesn't want to be killed or doesn't expressly give you permission to do so.

So, for humans, we can humanely provide death with dignity (like in Oregon), but humane slaughter is an oxymoron."

Edit:

> So where does this banana statistic come from? Is it just complete nonsense? Well, no. We do in fact share about 50% of our genes with plants – including bananas.
So what’s the difference between sharing 50% of our DNA with something, and sharing 50% of our genes with something? Well, rather surprisingly, genes – the regions of DNA that code for proteins – only make up about 2% of your DNA. So sharing 50% of our genes with bananas means we only actually share 1% of our DNA with them – not 50. So what’s the rest of our DNA for if only 2% makes proteins? Well, about 8% of our DNA is made up of gene regulatory regions – these act like switches to control when and where the genes are turned on and off. But the remaining 90% of our DNA is thought to be mostly non-functional – it’s often called ‘junk DNA’."
