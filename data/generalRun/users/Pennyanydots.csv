dogs,ffcn6b8,t3_esudfc,1579803012.0,I had a panic attack in front of my dog and hurried her into her crate. She whined the whole time and when i let her out she immediately curled up in my lap. The next time i had one she was out and stayed glued next to me. I don’t know how she knew to. Now if i’m having a panic attack or overwhelmed she’s starting to be right there to comfort me. I just make sure to tell her how good she was afterwards and maybe try to do something nice like take her for a longer walk or give her a big scratch. In my experience she was not afraid but every dog is different. Because her crate is her safe space we took it from there.
dogs,ffagfhs,t3_esjp5u,1579735156.0,"I would make sure your dog has enough excercise and then look at alternate confining solutions. My dog is a bit of a climber and an explorer so she’s confined when i go to work, but her crate is for a much larger dog. She’s a m gal in a xxl crate. She panicked in the m crate. You could also try puppy proofing a room or an excercise pen."
dogs,ff9ub36,t3_esge46,1579721497.0,"My dog loves the kong genius mike, its a tube with openings on either end. She destroyed the kong gyro but we’ve had a lot of fun with the kong bamboo ball."
dogs,ff9m2ai,t3_es2tbn,1579715841.0,I told my dog every night that we would figure things out. Forcing myself to say it helped me power through.
dogs,ff7anzw,t3_es1n7t,1579644793.0,I adopted a 9 month old who was a stray from a rural area and i live in a apt. Different situations but i can tell you how i got her adjusted. I confined her to a small puppy proof area. She got to come out when we went on walks and if she did her business she got to play in the apt for a bit before being confined again. eventually she got the hang of it. I also have a walker who comes in the middle of the day to take her for a potty break. The real key that i found was immediately putting her on the schedule. Even on the weekends. Until she was fully settled in the routine.
dogs,ff77bp7,t1_ff76tza,1579642548.0,Maybe this is just me but i always update the shelters/transports where my dog came from. I am happy to stay in touch with anyone who helped her to become my dog. Either way i hope she shows up and you can see her on occasion!
dogs,ff768ek,t3_es10m5,1579641932.0,I actually lost out on two different dogs because someone got them first. I went back to the shelter one last time because the third puppy was still there. Then my dog headed me off in the waiting room and it took about 30 min. Have you heard of GoNorth animal transport? They bring up dogs from the south to northern shelters but i think similar outfits list them on petfinder and bring them up to adopters. My dog is from Tennessee.
dogs,ff75gbv,t3_es12i1,1579641494.0,It’s very sweet what you’re doing. Maybe the family that is adopting her will stay in touch or if all your dogs get along you could have playdates etc.?
dogs,ff6xdri,t1_ff6x4sx,1579636845.0,"The first time i googled giardia i saw that dogs can be asymptomatic, it blew my mind. I feel like if I say giardia around my dog she gets bloody diarrhea."
dogs,ff6w6ie,t1_ff6vclh,1579636136.0,Definitely wash everything. That was something my vet stressed. Also be careful when picking up poop. Humans can get it. Wash your hands if you don’t after picking up after the dog. I also gave my dog a bath after the dewormer treatment. She likes to groom herself and i didn’t want to risk her getting it again. My girl was lethargic because we were up most of the night running downstairs for her to poop. But she perked up and started feeling better. Definitely call your vet though if he’s acting strange just to make sure it’s normal.
dogs,ff6v65c,t3_erzpcx,1579635540.0,"My dog had it, bloody stool and everything. I put her on a bland diet and then transitioned her back to her normal food. I washed everything (kongs in the dishwasher, soft toys in the wash etc). The bloody stool went away shortly after starting treatment. Keeping her away from other dogs so she didn’t them get sick was hard. Oh and i put her pill in a bit of peanut butter or wet food to get her to take it."
dogs,ff6gb4j,t3_erp341,1579626573.0,"Leave it. My dog was a stray before I got her and she was hunting for her meals. Her skills go far beyond chasing, she’s alarmingly good at catching. I live in nyc. We don’t need rats and pigeons in our apt. So teaching her to redirect her prey drive is the most important thing at the moment."
dogs,ff6fwfk,t3_errham,1579626320.0,"My dog would do this. I had a walk with her that lasted for 5 hours once. Now i take her to her spot and say “make”. If she makes we keep walking, if she doesn’t we circle the block and come back to the spot. Basically i am training make as a command and her reward besides praise is continuing to walk to new and exciting places. There was a point in time when I was taking her inside after refusing to pee for 5 min and then back out. We still occasionally do walks that last for hours but there’s less of me crying and begging for my dog to go to the bathroom so overall they’re a lot better."
dogs,fetiis5,t1_fethsnt,1579375797.0,"I'm glad to hear she's eating! If the vet says she's fine and it turns out that she's mad at you or exhausted, for me it took my dog about 5 days to forgive me and get back to normal. Which was an incredibly long five days! But she did eventually forgive me. In the meantime I let her have her space and whenever she came to me I would reward her."
dogs,fethflu,t3_eqkdr2,1579375511.0,"It definitely can't hurt to get in touch with your vet. I wound up at the vet the first time I boarded my dog when she wouldn't eat for two days afterwards (or look at me). the vet did a bunch of tests and determined everything was fine with her physically, then she put her food down and my dog ate everything. It turned out she was just mad at me. honestly though I'm super glad I went to the vet and made sure she was okay."
dogs,fesnire,t3_eqitwe,1579367120.0,When I was figuring out what my dog liked I would look for variety packs or bones in different flavors or places where there were samples of different flavors. I didn't buy any bags or things in bulk until I figured out what she liked.
dogs,feokyl0,t1_feojzt0,1579301560.0,"Yeah my dog had a sensitive stomach and was also new to her food, she hadn’t been in the shelter long when I adopted her, so I just used her food for treats. It was all new to her anyway."
dogs,feojwgn,t3_eq7j98,1579301180.0,"I adopted my dog at 9 months and started training the first day she was home. I started with a routine and crate training and the basics. I used her food for treats (i would take a portion and use for treats, not overfeed her) but eventually I started training her with throwing her toys. Like if she wanted me to throw something she had to sit etc."
dogs,felt9ec,t3_eptq2k,1579230376.0,Definitely not but as someone who works full time and has a dog you can have the happiest dog and people will still say the same thing. I got a 9 month old dog and she settled right in. I will say as someone who works 8-9 hours I have a walker who comes midday. I don;'t think my dog necessarily needs it (she can hold it) but that's what works for us.
dogs,fek2e5a,t3_epjpxx,1579191151.0,"I feel guilty for sure! My dog alternates daycare and being at home with a walker who comes midday. The funny thing is that even when i am home, half the time she wants to nap in the other room! She’ll get up if i go to pet her and like want her space. She only wants to snuggle after she’s had her “me” time. But i still feel horribly guilty."
dogs,fehsaae,t1_fehj8q6,1579122872.0,Also even if the vet can’t see her they might be able to talk to you (or their staff) and give advice on what to do in the meantime.
dogs,fehhs3u,t1_fehh1ca,1579116803.0,If she’s still having diarrhea it might be too soon. I gradually went from bland to my dogs regular diet over a period of like 1-2 weeks. My tylan perscription was for 10 days along with a probiotic. The diarrhea didn’t come back.
dogs,fehgqtz,t3_ep6t0l,1579116199.0,Obviously go to the vet. My dog got tylan powder for diarrhea that wouldn’t go away. In the meantime what about a bland diet? My dog gets boiled chicken and rice.
dogs,fehas8k,t1_feha7ib,1579112713.0,I’m taking a trip in march and i’m going to remind myself of my dogs behavior! I’m also planning on asking her walker to feed her just in case she doesn’t want to take food from me. Hopefully i’m not going to wind up back at the vet to get a diagnosis of “she’s mad at you”
dogs,feh9pqk,t1_feh9jud,1579112070.0,Omg. I’m glad she was okay! I got dramatic when my dog wiped off the bed. She yelped and then was walking fine but I freaked out and bought her stairs.
dogs,feh99rt,t3_ep5ems,1579111800.0,"I boarded my dog for two days, she wouldn’t look at me for five and she stopped eating for two. I rushed her to the vet and after ruling things out, the vet put her food in front of her and she ate everything. Turned out she was just mad at me."
dogs,feh6kuo,t3_ep51hq,1579110210.0,It took me about a month to start! The first two weeks I was very removed and then two weeks later it started slowly. I would say it took me a good two months to settle in and fully bond and three to be very bonded. I was super resentful and I think i spent the first two weeks sobbing nonstop and gaining like 20lbs. Now though it’s a lot better. I told my dog every night that “we will figure it out” and i found saying it aloud every night helped me learn to believe it.
dogs,feex2mr,t1_feew7tf,1579043089.0,Totally makes sense. She might be upset but it also might be good for her short term if she’s in danger when it comes to eating things. You could test it out over a weekend and see how she reacts. I did a test run with my dog and her crate before I left her to see her reaction and if she hated it. I had her confined and I went into the other room or out of sight.
dogs,feevz1p,t3_eosv25,1579042394.0,Could you try confining her a different way? For instance my dog is 30lbs and is in a crate sized for 100+lb dog. Its very big for her but she freaked out in the appropriate sized one. Now she loves her place and goes in every morning and is usually playing with her toys when I come home in the evenings. She has a walker but the big crate also works for us so she doesn’t get hurt or destroy things.
dogs,feer3cr,t1_feeqwnj,1579039412.0,I had the opposite problem! I had to train my dog using toys because that was all she cared about.
dogs,feeqnl6,t3_eoqloi,1579039156.0,congrats on your pupper! Have you started any basic training? That can also be tiring if you run through some commands. Maybe she just needs to relax into her home too.
dogs,fedogms,t3_eom67u,1579016419.0,"Totally not weird, or if it is I am in the same boat because I did it. I especially wanted to check in about confining her when I was at work and her prey drive. The trainer was fantastic, I learned some great things and got reassured of the things I was doing correctly."
dogs,fedlxf7,t3_eoibbe,1579014765.0,"As long as the vet says to start, i can tell you that i started by letting my dog sniff the brush and lick the toothpaste. Then when she put it in her mouth for more toothpaste, I began to move it gently and then we worked up to full on brushing. I got her peanut flavored toothpaste which she likes."
dogs,fedlo12,t3_eoj61b,1579014588.0,I looked for independance primarily since I work full time. When i met my dog in the playroom she immediately started playing with her favorites. Then she would come over to investigate me and get some pets and then back to playing. I knew I was going to be gone for most of the day and even with a walker coming I wanted to at least know she would be okay without me. I felt equipped to deal with her fear of elevators and terrible leash skills but the family who saw her before me vetoed her because she was too difficult to walk.
dogs,fedl85z,t3_eoma2z,1579014290.0,I have them for my medium sized dog after she leapt off the bed and wiped out. She was fine but i got them. I showed her how to use them once and now she uses them every time she’s going up or down the bed. I got mine at Petco.
dogs,fe9whfy,t3_eo7w69,1578942068.0,You could try puzzle toys. Put some food in one and show her how it works. My dog was a stray and kind of meh on a bowl too but when I started feeding her out of toys and made it a game she started eating everything.
dogs,fe9qkip,t1_fe9p1k1,1578940593.0,I think the trainer will be very helpful. I also tried making a list of things that were/weren’t working to see what could be done. For me not sleeping was a big one. I figured out to take off her collar so it was quieter and to work on her having to be quiet for a minute before I would come into the room so she couldn’t whine her way out.
dogs,fe9ftp9,t3_eo18e1,1578937196.0,"There is a lot of great advice here and i can tell you from personal experience I was still thinking i lost my mind getting a dog with a full time job after having her for 7 weeks. Around that time I started to think about what I needed too in order to make it work. It will get better, you all need to settle and adjust."
AmItheAsshole,fe98j9q,t1_fe97t8x,1578935359.0,"I’m glad to hear he likes treats! My girl had no idea what to do with them. New on a leash is hard, but it’s great you’re finding what works."
AmItheAsshole,fe963im,t1_fe8wpkg,1578934678.0,Good plan! Do you know what he likes? My dog isnt into treats but loves squeaky toys so sometimes i’ll bring one on my walk to redirect her attention. Also for like general socialization maybe go to a dog park and see if anyone looks friendly and would come out for a 1 on 1? Milo is very cute and very lucky to have you!
AmItheAsshole,fe8vxxv,t3_eo5s63,1578931580.0,NAH it doesn’t hurt to ask. Just if they say no don’t take it personally. Honestly a new puppy moved into my building and the owner asked if we could have a playdate when they saw the dogs interacting and I couldn’t say yes fast enough.
dogs,fe5ybx3,t3_enwikn,1578877663.0,My dog came from rural tensassee to nyc prior to adoption. I helped her through adjusting to the city. It was fine. moving from one city to another will probably be an even easier adjustment. you could also try some kind of crate training so your dog has a home they can take with them.
dogs,fe44bp5,t3_enr3mf,1578855692.0,"I have this leash from found that i am in love with. My dog is a stray from a rural area and i live in a big city so there is a lot of stimulation. The leash doesn’t mark my hands up, it’s super adjustable and has two double locking clips. Sometimes my dog goes full hunter and I use a halter for full control. She hates it so i mainly use a front clip harness. Also i have a whale shaped poop bag holder which, while not necessity, makes me smile when i have to pick up poop."
dogs,fdsa5am,t3_emys7n,1578697882.0,"I have a leash that has two double locking clips and can be put in any kind of configuration (waist, short, long loop). I thought that having one leash was fine but this is such a useful thing to have a multi use leash"
dogs,fdko05i,t3_elwf7v,1578507550.0,I switched from an easy walk to a ruffwear front range harness (https://ruffwear.com/collections/dog-harnesses/products/everyday-dog-harness-front-range). I use the front clip and it gives me that extra control for when we need to go somewhere. My dog used to slip the easy walk over her head too. She hasn’t done that with this one.
dogs,fdkgb2e,t3_elqali,1578503261.0,I adopted a dog who was a stray and horrible on the leash. The no pull harness wound up injuring her. In addition to hiring  a trainer and watching stuff on loose leash walking i also found that carrying a squeaky toy helped. She doesn’t care about treats but if i squeak the toy in my pocket most of the time she will focus on me and not on what she’s pulling towards. When we get back into my apartment building she gets to carry the toy up as a reward. If your dog likes treats that’s probably easier but ive had great luck with the squeaky toy.
AmItheAsshole,fdk9m82,t3_elt826,1578499189.0,"NTA, could you give them something like “happy new years” to be divided among the staff? It’s not right what they’re doing but it could help smooth things over. I take my dog to doggy daycare too. I was told that giving anything even a little looks better than giving nothing."
dogs,fdeqz68,t3_el08d2,1578344780.0,I boarded my dog and she did a lot of the same stuff. I freaked out and took her to the vet only to find out if someone else put her kibble down she ate it. She was mad at me. If you’re concerned obviously go to the vet (i did) but after about a week my dog was back to normal.
dogs,fdcgmym,t1_fdceq11,1578274417.0,"If it's of any help, my dog got over being mad at me. I kind of went back to how I was when I first adopted her, got her on a schedule and let her come to me/rewarded her when she did. It took about a week but she is very sensitive."
dogs,fdcebpd,t3_eklnn1,1578272808.0,not the same but I boarded my dog at her doggie daycare and the familiarity really helped. I made arrangements ahead of time to give her a blanket she likes to snuggle with at night that also smells like me. She had a great time playing and slept hard her first night home. She was still mad at me for a bit afterwards but it was her first time being boarded period by me. But I think the familiarity of the place helped immensely.
dogs,fd69k5g,t3_ek4rw0,1578187604.0,congratulations! I also went to the shelter to talk myself out of adopting a puppy and my dog climbed into my lap in the waiting room. My dog's an ex stray and was from rural Tennessee (I live in the big apple). Two things that helped us were immediately getting on a schedule and crate training. Sort of. She's a medium sized dog with a giant crate because the medium sized crate freaked her out but confining her was immensely helpful to housebreaking. Id also figure out what he likes. My dog is kind of indifferent to treats but loves praise and pets. So when she was new and scared of elevators I was on my knees in there telling her how wonderful she was to get her to go in the elevator. The last thing I'd say is if you have to hire a trainer go for it. I had grand illusions of self training but realized I was out of my league and called in a professional who helped us out greatly.
AmItheAsshole,fcyn62t,t3_ejkij2,1578083173.0,NTA. The only other thing I would say is pushing to speak to the vet so nothing gets lost going through a third person. You also might want to find a new vet.
AmItheAsshole,fcymxtr,t3_ejj56b,1578083034.0,NTA and it’s gross she kept pushing. I have a dog and a family member who is allergic. Thankfully she was super patient and we figured out what works when we’re in the same house but if it didn’t i would feel it’s my responsibility to figure out what to do with MY dog.
dogs,fcxpgvi,t3_ejasbs,1578068399.0,This sounds wildly unfair to the dog and your wife. I’d seek help with that rather than trying to win the argument before things get worse.
dogs,fcv5bq7,t3_ej2auq,1577994959.0,My dog sometimes gets super hyped after a walk so i go through 5-10 minutes of training to kind of mentally stimulate her and tire her out. If she’s still bouncing around i sometimes give her a massage to help her settle.
dogs,fcuh4xy,t3_eiudgl,1577980835.0,"I boarded my dog for two days and she was ignoring me and refusing to eat for days afterwards. I freaked and took her to the vet and she tried feeding her, my dog ate everything. It was my first time boarding her and she was not pleased with me. A few days after that she was back to her normal self. In the meantime i gave her space and would let her come to me. I rewarded her when she did that."
dogs,fclfopx,t3_ehti20,1577746711.0,"I say no, step away, cross my arms and turn my backً. when we were potty training i would say no, leash her and tie her to a chair and then do it. Just immediately break the moment and behavior. I would only ignore her for like 10-15 seconds but she knew what she had done  wrong and if she wanted to keep playing she couldn’t do it again."
dogs,fcl35ak,t3_ehpj7h,1577738786.0,"My dog stops dead outside my building because of the construction site across the street. I worked the “leave it” command with her so she knows to look at me but also i bring a squeeky toy, her one true weakness. Whatever her fave is. She also doesn’t care about treats but if i say leave it and then reward her with the toy she focuses on me instead."
dogs,fckg0rg,t3_ehoag7,1577724501.0,"He might think you’re engaging making noise etc. i stand up, cross my arms and turn my back when my dog nips. Immediately stop anything that could be mistaken for engaging. Also i echo everyone and strongy reccomend you stop spanking him."
dogs,fch8t4z,t1_fch1r03,1577648323.0,"My dog's a mutt, so not because of the breed. I did it because I wasn't sure if she would be alright as I work full time and she was a stray who never had a home before."
dogs,fch15tu,t3_eh9bf9,1577646226.0,I work full time and have a dog. My biggest suggestion is to simulate your schedule from the beginning to see how the dog does with it. When I brought my girl home I immediately hid in the other room aka went to work to see how she would do. She was fine but it put me at ease to see she was okay.
dogs,fc9utbz,t3_egpjd2,1577558538.0,Honestly it’s not fair to get a dog you think you shouldn’t get. I was comitted to making it work with my schedule and my dog. I figured it out but if you are against it then just don’t get a dog until you are ready.
dogs,fc5iuzp,t1_fc5eg1g,1577458806.0,This made me tear up! My girl was also abandoned in Tennessee and wound up in a kill shelter before being sent up north. She almost went home with someone else but they decided she was too unruly on the leash to handle. So i scooped her up and she’s just the best girl. The first time it rained when i got her she freaked out and then tried to pull me over to any kind of overhang to stay dry. It broke my heart. I got her a raincoat so she can stay dry while we work on her leash skills.
dogs,fbki4va,t1_fbje0d1,1576950729.0,I found my dog's first shelter's info in her medical form and then got their contact info from their website.
