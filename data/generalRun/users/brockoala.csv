starcitizen,ffnnukp,t1_ffm6fas,1580068304.0,"I think they don't despawns very fast, they just some times sink through the floor because of the lag or something. At [17:05](https://youtu.be/oOuV1FKSSJk?t=1025) I died and dropped a pistol, it looked like it sunk through objects and I thought it was lost. But then at [59:30](https://youtu.be/oOuV1FKSSJk?t=3570), it was found again and looked like it never sunk. 

So my theory is: Weapon sinking through floor is just a physics desync/miscommunication between the server and our game client. On the server they don't sink at all and physics were simulated properly, but that information wasn't passed to our client properly and we saw it differently in weird ways. After a period of time, when we revisit the place where it sunk, it would re-appear because by that time our client made another ""refresh"" request to the server, so we can now see their updated and correct positions."
