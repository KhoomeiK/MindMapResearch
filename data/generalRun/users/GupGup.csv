fatlogic,ffd6ixv,t1_ff74t92,1579814383.0,"I know nothing about celebrities or pop culture, and I could probably rattle off a couple dozen famous or internet-famous people who are morbidly obese, as opposed to the two women I know of who are skeletally thin (Eugenia Cooney and Arrow de Wilde).

edit: And it seems like Eugenia has finally gotten some help, so I guess she's off the list. And Arrow de Wilde has Marfan syndrome, contributing to her skeletal-ness."

Since half of Americans drink at least one can a day, plus all the other sources of added sugar in processed foods and snacks, it's easy to rack up hundreds of calories without any nutrition."
fatlogic,ff7p147,t1_ff73jzx,1579654862.0,"My high school's daily lunch options consisted of chicken or spicy chicken sandwiches (basically a microwaved fried chicken patty on a bun), nachos with ground beef and cheese sauce, french fries, a fruit cup, plain or chocolate milk, and maybe some warm corn. I just checked their menu, seems like they're offering some more veggies and fresh fruit. But without actually eating in the cafeteria I can't be sure how much better the food might be."

You're just wasting time that could be spent actually doing something, like exercising. Get your routine done and go home - you're taking up space that other people could be using."

Who wants to deal with doctors and hospitals and getting bills in the four-figure range for something you could avoid by just eating some more vegetables and getting some exercise a few days each week?
fatlogic,fdo4ba6,t3_embv46,1578598645.0,"Britney Spears, who has never been overweight, and has spent her entire life dancing, fell and hurt her knee over a decade ago. You can see quite clearly the difference in her performances from before and after that injury, even years later. She was never able to really recover from that. Seems like Lizzo has only become popular and started performing these big shows in the last year. All it takes is one rolled ankle, and she'll probably have mobility problems the rest of her life."

fatlogic,fdnjnla,t1_fdn6fpz,1578587203.0,"In small amounts sugar can have the same role as salt, which is to make the other flavors more pronounced.

edit: I've seen people complain about sugar in pasta sauce, but if you make some at home without any sweetener, it's incredibly acidic and a little bitter from all the tomatoes. Even Italian grandmothers will add some honey or brown sugar to their sauce to cut the acidity. Adding some fat, like melted butter, also helps smooth the taste out."

UIUC,fczavje,t3_ejfv13,1578097206.0,"Airbnb is a good place to look, since you're coming in later in the semester. You can find some nice rooming houses in Urbana where all the big trees grow."
fatlogic,fcylzlg,t3_ejil8p,1578082475.0,"Carrie Fisher was 5' 1"". If 35 pounds was 1/4 of her weight, then she was 140 pounds. THAT is a lot for someone of her height. I'm surprised she hadn't lost weight sooner on the advice of a doctor. 105 pounds for someone that short is perfectly reasonable."
fatlogic,fcvb3bs,t1_fcun5ox,1577998385.0,"Seems like she's only become popular and starting doing these big shows in the last year...let's see how long it lasts. Britney Spears lasted about 30 years with intense dance training and performances before her body got too worn down to continue performing. Hell, she fucked up her knee during a fall over a decade ago and never really recovered. All it takes is for Lizzo to roll an ankle, and her dance career is over."
