I'd give him his half.  Not because I had to, or but because it's the right thing to do.  It doesn't matter if he had skipped the funeral, or hadn't contacted me until he found out about the money.  Dad was more wrong for disowning him in the first place.

I would research the best way to transfer the money to him, is there less fees if there is a lawsuit without any lawyers involved and just explaining the situation to the judge and not contesting it?  Or is there always going to be a large cut going to the state because it's a transfer of wealth?"

It was rough, though.  Even the official strategy guide wasn't much help in getting all the secret characters or the best ending.  I would write in to Nintendo Power just to get the information I needed.  They graciously answered my questions (some of them ended up in issues of the magazine, which 10 year old me was proud of), but always ended with the suggestion that I buy the official strategy guide.  I did, that's why I had to mail you this specific question.    


Also, being evil is super easy, but there's hardly any content for players going down that path, just two potential allies, one of whom requires you to have started the game going down the good path before reaching him.

There's a phrase in art, ""rule of cool""- even if it isn't practical, if it improves the image (in the eyes of the artist and/or client), it's permitted.  Exposed skin on character art is a contentious issue, artists can lean one way or the other, but will typically go with what the client wants."
relationship_advice,fec9niu,t1_fec5xr2,1578969129.0,"Get started with weight training, muscle will help you burn more energy- it will make the scale go up in the short term, but the number isn't the issue, it's the fat.  You don't have to become a power lifter, but if you have access to a gym, or a set of dumbells at home, you can make progress.  


Also, cut out sugar entirely.  Not carbs in general, just sugar (whether it's table sugar, high fructose corn syrup, or honey).  The biochemistry of sugar digestion creates byproducts that signal for the storage of existing fat and the creation of more fat from the energy available in the body.  Needless to say, this all makes losing fat more difficult.  The only exception is fruit (not fruit juice, eating whole fruit, like an apple), the fiber literally blocks your body from accessing the a portion of sugar that is within it, and fiber is also good for you."
