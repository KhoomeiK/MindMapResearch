8 years of living here and I don’t think I’ve once been threatened by a homeless person. Been offered lots of drugs, but never threatened.

I don’t know if you have limited experience around the homeless or just lack empathy, but you should rethink your position on this. The majority of our country is one car repair from being homeless."

Cringetopia,fd42dqt,t1_fd3dd2t,1578163731.0,"“Some”.

And therein lies the gray area of taking into your own hands, the ability for a stranger to reproduce. Pedophiles would never come forth before hurting a child. If the punishment for NOT hurting a child is the same as if they do, why wouldn’t they?"
Cringetopia,fd39dbj,t1_fd37shm,1578155987.0,"I’m glad that you’re an industry leading professional. You should speak with the other leading psychologists and give them the update, they’ll be happy to hear you’ve cracked the code! 

Do you not understand the difference in what I said and what you said concerning trauma? I didn’t say all childhood abuse victims end up pedophiles, I said that is a BIG reason why pedophiles turn out the way they do. Your inability to see the difference may be the reason you’re being edgy.

Do you remember in the 60s when homosexuals were being chemically castrated? At that point in time they were considered equal to pedophiles. 

Forcing someone to undergo chemical castration because they have thoughts that can’t be changed without therapy and psychiatric help is incredibly callous and shows that you are either a teenager, an edge lord, or both."
Cringetopia,fd31sdh,t1_fd2tvil,1578153902.0,"That’s not really a humane practice.

Nor does it kill everyone’s sex drive flat. Most of these people aren’t having these thoughts because of a high sex drive. It’s usually sexual abuse from childhood or some other trauma. It’s much deeper than just wanting sex.

If we don’t give any real options to people who have these thoughts, then they will never reach out for help."

progun,fcnbwmp,t1_fcn9hnh,1577808351.0,"I’m an American, and you REALLY shouldn’t bring up rape statistics right now. Also let’s see a source on your wild claim.

We do not have a good record for that, as a country. I’m a gun owner too, but carrying a gun will not stop you from being raped. It CAN stop it, if you’re prepared to end someone’s life, but not everyone wants to put themselves in the position of be raped or kill a man.
