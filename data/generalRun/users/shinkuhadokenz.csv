But sanji and pagaya didn't survive his strongest attacks. He didn't go all out against luffy in the beginning either. If he wanted to kill them, he could've. 

As for admirals dodging his attacks, well he shoots lightning. Which travels at 1/3rd the speed of light (if we can use real physics)
If random characters can hit admirals with their punches and what not, then you can guarantee that enel can hit them with his lightning. 


If we give him an upgrade post time skip, i think he could be admiral level for sure. His power was arguably already admiral level pre-time skip. It was just rendered useless against luffy alone.
His lightning power is insane.

As for his bounty, maybe his starting bounty would be 500 million which is very high. But bounty gets raised based off the havoc you create, so it's really impossible to draw any conclusions from it.

The problem with people like you who severely suffer from TDS, is that you make up lies. You call it a KKK rally but it really wasn't one. 

It's also funny you keep calling me a trumper when i didn't even vote for trump. 
And yes i have no idea what you said or thought about obama, but were you anti obama? Were you as vocal about his atrocities as you are about trump's? I highly doubt it.
The people on the left love obama and keep praising him, despite him killing a ton of innocent people. 

So if you do talk shit about trump for his actions in the middle east, you're only allowed to do so if you did the same when obama did it. 

The fact that you started to curse and name call me, shows you suffer from TDS and can't handle a normal debate. Seek psychiatric help. Trump will be re-elected lmao.

Lmao right. And hillary clinton had 99.6% chance to win the presidency. 
Well let's see who will win this year.

Also i'm not blindly defending trump. But if you make an accusation, then you need proof. Simply saying ''he defended a kkk rally'' when 1. it wasn't a kkk rally. and 2. good people actually do exist on both sides of the rally.  Doesn't work. Just because you might think everyone on the right might be nazi's, doesn't make them so.
 
But again, trying to have a rational debate with someone suffering from TDS is like trying to show a blind person colors. It's futile. 

Anyways have a good day. I'm curious who you think will win the election this year cuz the democrats truly have awful candidates and the economy is stronger than ever. There's no way trump is losing.

Oh and why include obama? It's called not being a hypocrite. People like you were silent during obama or even praising him when he was dropping bombs in the middle east, but now trump takes out a terrorist general and it's omg he's declaring war, orange man bad. 
Have some self reflection."
AskReddit,fdpfmi3,t1_fdpf1lk,1578627371.0,"1. So when he says ''there were good people on both sides'', was he wrong? Was everyone in that rally a bad person and a KKK member? No.
The fact that you can't see this is further proof that you suffer from TDS.

2. He clearly states if she wasn't his daughter, he would date her. Saying that she's attractive enough. But that since it is his daughter, he's not dating her. 
Someone can have a great looking adult offspring and not see them sexually because it's their offspring.

3. What country did trump try to declare war on? Obama drone striked a ton of people, including a full hospital yet i don't hear you cry about that. Yet he invaded libya and made a bigger mess of the middle east.

Again, you suffer from TDS and it's highly obvious. But i don't expect someone like you to think rationally after my reply.
So you can continue to hate trump and overblow everything like you're currently doing.

But Trump will be re-elected so it will be a long 5 years for you.
I wish you good luck in the years to come.
