movies,feesv9k,t1_feer48f,1579040487.0,"I wonder if the 50+ count is confirmed by the germans? Stuff like that can be greatly exaggerated when only coming from one side. Example being the attack on Berlin, where the Soviets claimed around 400.000 killed on the german side, while german research put it about 80-100.000.

edit: I read about it, apparently the germans were continously hit by artillery fire which Murphy called in. I don't remember if that was featured in the movie. Maybe I would have believed the final scene more if it was.

edit 2: Read some more about it, seems like the [germans didn't see him](https://www.historynet.com/audie-murphy-one-man-stand-at-holtzwihr.htm)

>The billowing smoke from the tank destroyer, combined with the constant roar of battle, prevented the Germans from detecting where the machine-gun fire was coming from. According to Murphy, With all the crackle of firearms and big shells exploding all around, they probably didn’t even hear my machine-gun fire, much less guess its point of origin. Although the smoke provided some concealment, it also interfered with Murphy’s visibility, which allowed some enemy soldiers to creep up unnoticed on his right flank. He wrote: When I first saw them, they had stopped in the drainage ditch directly in front of me and were frantically discussing something. I pressed the trigger and slowly traversed the barrel–the bodies slumped in a stack position."
