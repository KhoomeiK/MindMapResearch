depression,ff2lb0d,t1_fey2kuk,1579511491.0,"I ment i also have to go to the dentist finally, also i'm worried if i acted weird last time i saw a friend and thinking about what her friends think. I'm having a big Problem to impose on someone...i don't want to bother anyone and don't want to get asked questions or that i have to explain myself. All weekend long i was overthinking about that..but since Yesterday i'm soo tired that i slept all day...
Whish you all the best!"
depression,fexz2el,t1_few58cp,1579438590.0,"Your last sentence is exactly what's going on in my head right now...
Do you feel better during the day or better in the evening?"
depression,feuq7my,t3_eqndfm,1579388965.0,"Sure deal with that too..also afraid to get unexpected calls/visits and paranoid of getting recognized that i am at home...also doing them calls/visits. Afraid of going out, bc i don't want to meet someone who could see how shitty i look or someone from my ex work. Thinking about social situation and if i acted weird or offended someone, same with mails i did not replied (should i have ? And if so, when? Why didn't i reied immediately)
So it is nice to just sleep and dream...it's like you carry a lot of heavy suitcases around all the time and can finally drop them. Best is, if you dream sth. interesstint and keep thinking about the nice stuff and kind of dream on..."

depression,feum2iu,t3_eqndke,1579387836.0,"Ha, it was my worst year too. Feels like 2019 was in a dark fog-total waste of time,  don't know if it ever will change. I feel like i aged in that year 15 years. 
Also have the same conditions as you have...

BUT it was also the first time i actually  went to the doc and started medication."
depression,fesj37v,t3_eqi4cl,1579365728.0,"Been there..i searched the whole city online for permanent make up solutions like lashes and eyebrows, facials, ect. Same for hair..thought of braids, dreads, perm, ect. Watched a lot of YouTube tutorials and so on... Although i did not made it out of bed to actually go there and have things done, maybe you can do it!
 It took me months to go to the hairdresser, which did a wonderful job, she also had beautiful perm lashes, so i got an appointement with her lashlady. Felt really good afterwards and gave me definitely a boost. 
Wish you all the best! 

Oh and i just wanted to tell someone: today i opened the curtains for the first time in  2 years..it is snowing."
