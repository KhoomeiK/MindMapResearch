I was 14 and my dad’s friend went out to a bike night and was drinking. He got back on his bike and went racing home, no helmet. The police said he hit a guardrail at 80+mph, but thankfully didn’t hit his head. The medical term they used for his lower right leg was “exploded”. They did everything they could to not amputate, and he almost lost it several times over the next two years. When I was 22, I visited and had to mow his lawn because they had to rebreather the leg and fix it again. I’m now 34 and he’s mostly alright. He has been on 100% disability since the crash.
