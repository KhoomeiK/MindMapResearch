AskReddit,ffhahi4,t3_etmcej,1579927907.0,Probably because I usually cancel at the last minute anyway so they may as well cut out the middle man.
AskReddit,ffgfirb,t3_ethflz,1579905084.0,"My lisp. Granted, it's not so bad now except when I'm drunk, which doesn't happen that often."
TrueOffMyChest,ffgfdz6,t3_ethfni,1579904998.0,"I understand. My brother is in that phase right now with our mom and I went through it, too. Now, what I mostly feel for her is pity. Behind all the awfulness is a really damaged human being. I have no idea if that's true of your mother or not. Some people are really just awful."
AskReddit,ffgexxn,t3_ethfoc,1579904719.0,"The current proceedings are a trial. What the House did was an indictment, where the charges were made. Now, it's the Senate's duty to weigh the charges and act as jurors. The Senate trial is currently in the opening statements phase so that means each side gets a chance to lay out their case, just as a lawyer would do in a regular trial. Next, the Republicans will have a chance to make their opening statements. This is how an impeachment trial works.

ETA: I think I should have said the Trump's defense team, not the Republicans. It's not the Republicans' duty to defend the president. Everyone in the Senate is supposed to be an impartial juror."
AskReddit,ffge0gq,t1_ffgdhss,1579904135.0,"You're a good, kind person."
AskReddit,ffgdxva,t1_ffgddza,1579904090.0,"It doesn't affect them, not directly, but it's called being a decent human being and having empathy for others."
AmItheAsshole,ffgdr74,t3_ethgfb,1579903975.0,"YTA and the fact that you're defending this behavior and think that it's okay because ""he's just a little bitch"" is concerning about your general character. By 14, you should be fully capable of empathy and you appear to have none. Your friend, on the other hand, does. You could learn a lot from her."
cats,ffeii8g,t1_ffeigic,1579849381.0,"I love her name, too. One of my girls is named Thistle. I love botanical names for cats."
cats,ffeigic,t3_et6jtu,1579849324.0,She's stunning. Congrats on the new family members!
AskReddit,ffehlq4,t3_et6mwn,1579848329.0,Ask what they're wearing.
AskReddit,ffe66g6,t3_et4fgi,1579837747.0,Too much saliva. Too much suction. Dry lips. Bad breath. Overly aggressive tongue.
Showerthoughts,ffe5t1u,t3_et4fs1,1579837462.0,"Yeah, no. There would still be rich people if there was no poverty. It's not like light and dark. If no one lived in poverty, if everyone had adequate housing, food, clothing, and medical care, there would still be people who had more more than adequate everything."
puppy101,ffe4tyb,t3_et4gdd,1579836727.0,"I think the best way to handle this is not to just let her out on her own. When she needs to go out put on her leash and go out with her. Even if you're just going into the yard instead of for a walk: leash and outside with her. When she poops everybody gets to go inside.

It's been helpful for us to work on training our puppy to potty on command. You can only do that if you're there with her. It definitely takes time and work."
puppy101,ffb7e1c,t1_ffaaqpq,1579753842.0,It would be great if the birds learned to tell him to leave it.
puppy101,ffb7b4h,t1_ffaazd6,1579753763.0,That's what we do but we set up situations for training. I use a treat she likes as the bait and a treat she loves as the reward. Drop the just okay treat and wait for her to go for it then tell her to leave it and give her the really great treat.
puppy101,ffb7764,t1_ffayyqe,1579753659.0,I thought this was literally one of those things that just suddenly clicked for her but it turns out that my husband has been seriously working on this with her. The two of them were home alone last weekend while I was out of town for a funeral and he really got her to understand it.
AskReddit,ffa7xc2,t1_ffa7t8e,1579729623.0,"Yeah, exactly."
AskReddit,ffa7t6l,t3_esikpz,1579729559.0,Most of my friends. The friends I didn't make through gaming I've met through music. Music has given me a sense of community because I know everyone when I walk into certain venues.  Music has also helped me through bad times and helped me celebrate good times. I really can't imagine life without it.
AskReddit,ffa7hhb,t3_esikmc,1579729376.0,"Positives: it creates jobs for local residents, expands the local economy, exposes both the traveler and the local to people and ideas they might not otherwise encounter.

Negatives: tourists are often exploitative of locals (e.g. sex tourism), there are often environmental impacts (e.g. cruise ships), over-tourism is a real thing and makes life worse for both locals and travelers and can lead to damage to cultural sites."
