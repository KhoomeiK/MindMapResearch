I love the fact that the characters feel so alive in this game, with all their own quirks and goofy quotes and everything. It makes it feel more like they're actually *there* instead of just cards."

It seems like a pretty good game if you distance it from the two franchises it has smashed together, because it has literally nothing I like about SMT and not much I like about FE either, but I don't like idols so I'm still on the fence about getting it."

It has literally nothing I like about SMT, seemingly very little that I like about Fire Emblem, and it focuses on teenage idol pop singers, which I hate.

I will say, though, that if I understand correctly, Tiki is a Vocaloid in this setting, which is really clever."

I don't think I'll actively try to summon them when I still haven't gotten ~~Altena~~ a single focus unit from the new Genealogy focus, but a lot of people seem super hyped about this, so that's good."

fireemblem,fefxcwt,t1_feef5x2,1579068328.0,"One time I had a very funny dream that they were going to put Kratos in Smash Bros.

There were a lot of generic developers in a meeting room, discussing it with each other and showing off how Kratos was a powerful character in the game, and how the Nintendo developers had come up with a really good moveset for him. But then, they showed that there would be a Palutena's Guidance segment on him. The Sony developers wanted the Kid Icarus characters to be afraid of Kratos, but instead, the Palutena's Guidance dialogue was mostly about Viridi making fun of Kratos for being bald, and the Sony developers got so mad that they refused to let the Nintendo developers put Kratos in the game.

And that's why Kratos isn't in Smash Bros, according to my subconscious brain."
