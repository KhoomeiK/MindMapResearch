AskReddit,fe0mpt2,t3_enktw6,1578816185.0,I had a panic attack once in October 2017 for over ten minutes while sitting alone in my room and Google said exercise for some reason so I did 50 jumping jacks. Itâ€™s 2020 now and Iâ€™m still exercising I never regret a workout.
eczema,fdqyvay,t3_emo4em,1578677012.0,"So thereâ€™s a lot of changes I made over the years to help with my eczema.

Switched from carpet to lamented flooring, hard water to filtered water showers, ate less dairy, wash my hands and face with water and no makeup, no soap for showers only hair, scentless detergent and two rinses for laundry, trimming nails down, only wearing certain fabrics

Changes Iâ€™m considering for this year too: following the Holistic Food Pyramid, disinfecting surfaces more

Like others said, please go to a dermatologist. Eczema is the worst and Iâ€™m so sorry this is happening to you."

eczema,fdmkmme,t3_em2no9,1578553443.0,Happy for you! Maybe the Holistic food pyramid might interest you.
eczema,fdj50yc,t3_eli2kc,1578458627.0,"Idk thatâ€™s my bad habit too, my fellow eczema friend advised me to go cold showers but thatâ€™s missing out on a moment of shower relief. What helps I guess is making sure you have a filter so you are showering with soft water instead of hot water. Or if you have an antihistamine and shower at night, take the antihistamine before you shower and just discipline yourself."
offmychest,fdd78wn,t3_ekovjc,1578297920.0,"Yoo my best friend was like this to me all of 2019. I sent her a paragraph at 3am one night laying a boundary that she's no longer allowed to talk to me about ""x"" and with her own self reflection and whatnot she realized what she was doing was not okay and has been improving since. As they say, ""Good fences make good neighbors."""

bathandbodyworks,fdd2tqt,t3_ekf6c3,1578292511.0,"In early October I applied online for all the B&BW locations near me for a seasonal position and a manager called me to schedule a group interview at the Starbucks in that outlet. The other girl was MIA so really it was just me at that interview, I was briefly asked about my previous job experiences with multi tasking, an example of how I would greet a customer, handle some kind of conflict, I think I was asked why I chose B&BW. That manager specifically didn't need my resume or references and said nobody needs previous job experiences really because even a customer can sell a product to another customer. Felt good to get a call for a job offer on the drive home!

The scheduling is super random make sure you set your availability online at least 17 days in advance, don't quit your current job, and be prepared to work holidays and weekends.

It's January now and I haven't been scheduled to work so far (up to January 18 no days) so I should really ask if the season is over for me or if they are keeping me since I'm able to log in to the portal still."

Two of them involve two different friend groups resenting me for leaving back in 2018 and 2019, and the other one was having a tire stolen from my vehicle and a gang trying to hurt me.

TheGirlSurvivalGuide,fc3zuxq,t3_efwdjr,1577402928.0,"Fluoride is important to have in mouthwash and toothpaste (according to my dentist)! Brush, floss, and mouthwash. Going through ABCs 2-3 times helps time pass by for me.

Drinking enough water, skincare (washing and moisturizing face), and clean hands are just as important.

Ultimately itâ€™s the consequences of neglecting health and hygiene that have motivated me to stay on top of it. Root canal tooth pain, having a needle sink into the infected nerve, and the two day process for installing a new crown at the dentist is a physical and financial torture of its own. Filling for cavities also add up and cavities donâ€™t get smaller either.

Not sure what to say about showering, as long as you donâ€™t smell and feel comfortable you should be okay, because using too much shampoo or conditioner for the hair can be bad. It really depends."

What helped me was a Podcast that described replaying bad memories as our brainâ€™s way of trying to figure out what we can do to prevent this kind of pain again. Maybe there is a lesson to learn, maybe there isnâ€™t. Time will heal more than anything else, and even though the bond with that person is no longer there, you still have lifetime friends with you and yet to meet."
