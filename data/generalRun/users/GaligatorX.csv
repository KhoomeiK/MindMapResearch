I'm mourning my relationships with my family, that should have been supportive and life-long connections, but actually were harmful to me, so I've had to go nc/lc. I have an adverse childhood event score of 7, so my risk of suicide is quite high, among other things, and I need to be gentle with myself. 

I've also had difficulty sustaining friendships as my career has taken me around the world over the last 20 years, and as much as I have formed great friends, they are more concerned with the people on their doorsteps than a connection through the Internet, which is only to be expected. 18 months ago I moved across continents again, and knew no one where I'm currently settling, except my partner, who got cold feet and went back after just 4 months. 

I've now seen a pattern in my relationships with men. I've had 3 longterm relationships, and several other shorter relationships. I'm working on that. I've never felt my environment was safe enoygh/ideal for children, so I've never had children. 

So the issue of loneliness/being alone has been a big one.

I'm now focusing on making my environment permanent, developing beautiful friendships and exploring those hobbies we never get a chance to do. 

If I keep working on my self and continue with therapy, I might one day put myself in a position where I can meet a man who respects me, but I'm not there just yet, so I'll just enjoy my flat by myself, enjoy doing whatever I want, whenever I want and see what happens."

Maybe your sullen SD would benefit from therapy. It's unlikely she's coming out of something unscathed if your SS is coming out like that, she's just better at hiding it.
