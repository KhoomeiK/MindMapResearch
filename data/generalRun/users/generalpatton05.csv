With the amount I know, I think she’s right that you need to take time and go through the process of divorce. She also just heard from you after you terminating the friendship. That’s a big deal for the both of you. 

Be patient, let her take her time. And focus on you divorcing your wife. She’s, amongst other worries, probably assuming you see her as a great replacement for the pain or excellent revenge sex. It would be the perfect way to hurt your soon to be ex-wife. Make sure that’s not what you’re doing. And good luck!"
