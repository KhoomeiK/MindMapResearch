Delaware,fgstnuo,t3_f0bmba,1581092425.0,"I was about to head out the door when I got the warning on my phone, waited in the basement until the warning was done, and caught the shuttle. Apparently I was one of the only ones, because none of my coworkers are here lol"
relationships,fgslrtf,t1_fgsh71b,1581087466.0,"Yeah for real, she shouldn't be doing shit."
WTF,fgsg25n,t1_fgsdveh,1581083347.0,"It's kind of the opposite, more like ""no longer as depressed, tidy house."" I've even been getting into house plants! Modern medicine is truly a miracle."
OpenChristian,fgsftwl,t3_f07gfm,1581083166.0,"I don't feel like I know enough to speak on the theology, but my personal opinion is this. 

I truly believe in the sanctity of marriage, and that marriage should absolutely not be taken lightly. When you get married, you intend to be married forever. In line with this, I believe that it's wrong to rush to get married so that you can live together. I think that's not taking marriage seriously enough if you're rushing into it, and it bothers me that often that's considered the ""Christian"" thing to do.   In that vein, I think one of the responsible things you can do is living together and being together a decent amount of time before you get married. 

In my opinion, the thing that disregards the sanctity of marriage the most is rushing to get married to someone you don't *truly* know because you want to have sex/live together."
WTF,fgs9sfg,t1_fgs016z,1581077797.0,"This is true, it's happened to me too when I was in a really bad depressive state, and my apartment was a gross mess (still not as bad as that though). My sister, angel that she is, came to visit and deep cleaned for me when I was at work, and I've been doing a lot better since. Mentally and cleaning-wise."
AmItheAsshole,fgrni1e,t1_fgrgmu9,1581051550.0,"Yeah it's very weird that OP thinks women are like this. If my husband ever said something to me like ""Hey, I'm gonna ask my sister to tone it down a bit, so she doesn't outshine you."" I'd be floored, like what the *fuck* did you just say to me? 

I think other women are goddamn beautiful, because they are. Comparing yourself to other women like OP is describing is some middle school shit."

MakeupEducation,fgr1z89,t3_ezv8e3,1581036354.0,Um by 38 did you mean 28? My advice is to place your blush a bit higher up on your cheekbones to really accentuate how lovely they are!
AskAnAmerican,fgpzl25,t3_ezsxy9,1581015038.0,"I consider myself non-denominational Christian, but equality in a church community is something that is very important to me, so I attend churches that reflect that. I currently found a church that I really like which is United Methodist, and the two lead pastors are women. I don't think I would stay at a church if they didn't allow women to be ordained."

tifu,fgpov00,t1_fgpebjy,1581009109.0,"I have the same thing but with kiwis! Ive always loved kiwis, and I would eat them until my mouth was raw and sore. It wasn't until I mentioned this to my husband that I realized it might not be normal. I thought kiwi hurt everyone's mouth, and it was just so tasty that it was worth it."
DannyGonzalez,fgnf9jn,t3_ezh84f,1580943616.0,Every time I see her it startles me because she looks like an Indian version of my mom. Like literally a carbon copy. They're also both insane :)
badwomensanatomy,fgmtkq4,t3_ezbuqk,1580931776.0,"So *that's* why that creepy old man called me ""baby"" yesterday, he was only trying to help me!"
AskMen,fgmp0i0,t1_fgm1nlr,1580929106.0,"That sucks man, I'm sorry. One of my girlfriends tried that once and I shut that shit down. She was annoyed at my husband (for a very stupid reason) and she decided to complain to me about it. I told her straight up that I will always take his side, and if she has a problem, she can talk to him about it, not me. Pissed me off to no end, like hey, that's my favorite person you're talking about!"
