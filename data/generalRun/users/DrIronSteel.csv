Recently we had a near TPK when the party I'm in decided to go to a direction wolf Den when only 3 of us we're level 2.

As Soo as the decision was made, I new out if game our fates were sealed. But I rode that wagon into the gnawing mouths of my devourers.

The other two players who died with me and including myself would have it no other way.

We even told our DM we didn't min because while yes losing the PCs was indeed a loss, the outcome and the rollercoaster ride to the inevitable conclusion had gravitas.

Imagine seeing the 45 yr old Human Fighter getting up against the odds by himself 4 times in a row and taking 3 wolves down with him before he died.

He may never see the fay wilds or lead a Crusade into Avernus, but for 5-10 out of game minutes Fury was a fucking legend."
