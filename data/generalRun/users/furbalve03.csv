AP teachers have a new online student progress check called AP classroom that you should have joined at the start of the class. Teachers can assign checks on there so you can see what you need to study more.
Khan Academy's website has a lot of info on most AP classes. Depending on if you have internet access and on the class you're taking, this might be the best option.
Lastly, there's a site called Albert.io that has study questions. Some of the site is free but to get full access you have to pay."

A strong new teacher mentor program.
