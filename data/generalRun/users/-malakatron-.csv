Suzuki foundation surveyed 800 cyclists in January in toronto declaring it unsafe is reason enough to defund the CBC and their bullshit agenda.  If this agenda can be funded, as any other broadcaster must achieve, then great.  Public money funding this circlejerk nonsense must stop. 

The notion that they had all hands on deck for the pride firings that day and this story took a backseat was too much.
