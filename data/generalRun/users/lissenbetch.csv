Edmonton,ff1vtu8,t3_er3d7g,1579487321.0,"Sometimes it's bad luck, sometimes it's poor judgement that leads to shitty things happening (like leaving keys in a van in a sketchy neighbourhood..). Don't stress worrying about what will happen next, last thing you need is a relapse!"
fatlogic,ff1oymy,t3_eqvvrb,1579482951.0,"I worked with a girl who claimed the 1200 calorie diet didn't work. She would go to Aquasize and eat back the calories she burned, however she claimed Aquasize burned over **2000 calories**."
Edmonton,fdhckr1,t3_ek9ajo,1578419958.0,They're all over the south east. They would wander the alley in Charlesworth!
HaircareScience,fdh26c0,t3_el785k,1578413765.0,"I've found Olaplex 3, and the shampoo and conditioner, work best when I've had an actual Olaplex treatment at the salon first. Having the treatment smooths out the damage and creates a smooth base to use the rest of the product line. The products are designed to maintain the bond that's applied at the salon."

You don't choose your skin colour. You don't choose where you were born. You don't choose your sexuality or even your gender. 

You DO choose what you put in your mouth. Fat is not a disability or a minority. It's nothing more than a symptom of overconsumption."

Edmonton,fcg4w2u,t3_eh2ana,1577636485.0,"I tip my hair stylist well at 20%, she does a fantastic job and I want to show her how much I appreciate her work. 

$400 for colour correction is pretty standard with a reputable salon. You don't HAVE to tip, but you should tip what you can."
Edmonton,fbfr66y,t1_fbfk8nt,1576818260.0,If only insurance companies would limit the rate hikes for the people who drive like this. Someone who has a clean driving record shouldn't be getting an increase because of people who don't understand what a red light means.
