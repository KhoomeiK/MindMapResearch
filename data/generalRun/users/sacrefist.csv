My concern with voter ID laws is that they convert a right into a privilege. You have a federal right to vote, but no federal right to receive an ID card from the state.

I've seen one case in Texas in which a fellow refused to divulge his SSN to obtain a driver's license, citing federal law at the time that made it illegal for states to demand a SSN. At the time, Texas conducted the then illegal practice of refusing to hand out a driver's license application unless you gave the state your SSN. He was eventually charged w/ the crime of driving w/o a license. In the trial, the state admitted the following:

1. The state received a valid & complete application for a license from the defendant.
2. Texas law mandates that a license shall be issued upon receipt of any valid & complete application.
3. The state did not issue the defendant a driver's license.
4. Texas law requires that all applications for a driver's license must be kept on file.
5. The state had no record of the application submitted by the defendant.

The jury still voted to convict, and the verdict was upheld through several appeals. Even after all these facts established in the trial, the state still refused to issue a driver's license, to this very day. One could argue the legality of deciding to drive w/o a license, but the case made clear to me that the state can deny a driver's license for illegal reasons or no reason at all. There are many federal protections for the right to vote, but few for a ""right"" to obtain an ID. We shouldn't make our voting rights subject to such whims."
