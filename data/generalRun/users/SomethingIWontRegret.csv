IdiotsInCars,fekmf0a,t1_fekl3p8,1579203081.0,"Yep, at 60 it takes very little motion to pop the bike out to the side."
IdiotsInCars,fekbbi3,t1_fein7ne,1579196475.0,"Even at parking lot speeds, if you turn the bars left when your bike is directly underneath of you, the bike will go left and out from underneath of you, and you fall on the ground.  You can't turn left by turning the handlebars left, unless the bike is already out to the right of you a little.  You either unconsiously wait until the bike wobbles to the right, or you consciously set the bike to your right by steering it there first."
IdiotsInCars,fekawka,t1_feimud1,1579196231.0,"Yep.  Same thing.  You steer a bike by countersteer.  The question is whether it's conscious or unconscious.  Unconscous you're using the natural wobble of a two wheeled system to initiate the turn.  You literally cannot turn right in a 2 wheeled vehicle, unless the vehicle is to the left of the center of gravity.  Conscious countersteering, you intentionally turn the bars a little to the left to move the bike over, and then lean and turn back to the right to make the controlled turn."
IdiotsInCars,fekahhz,t1_fejl90s,1579195986.0,"All steering is countersteering.  It's the only way of getting the bike out from underneath of you.  The question is whether it's conscious or unconscious.  You can see him pushing down with his right hand at the start.  It was subtle but enough at that speed to steer the bike to the left of system CG, so that he could steer it right.  It then whips through and then to the right of system CG, letting him steer it back to center."
IdiotsInCars,fek9wb8,t1_fei6a99,1579195641.0,"Yep - pushed down on the right grip.  That should initiate the countersteer turn to the right, really nice recovery back to centered afterwards."

I was in a spin class at my gym that required you to call ahead and reserve a spot.  I was working hard in a pretty intense class, sweat pouring off of me, and I noticed a larger woman in front of me.  Early 20s, immaculate matching workout outfit.  Sitting on the spin bike, turning over the cranks slowly with no resistance, while browsing her phone.  I thought, lady, somebody else could have used that spot.  There are some perfectly good benches over there where you can more comfortably sit and FaceGram or whatever."

Assuming you mean throwing a milkshake at someone, then yes, it's simple assault and/or battery in most jurisdictions.  Any intentional and unwanted contact can be simple criminal assault, and the assaulter is liable for any damage caused by the assault.

In the video here, suppose the person being sprayed in the face slips, falls down, cracks his head on the curb and dies.  That is manslaughter."

Whatcouldgowrong,fee5mei,t1_fee1ok1,1579026885.0,Ease off the gas while continuing to point the front wheels in the direction you want to go.  Hitting the brakes is bad because braking is front biased.  You want the rear to snap back and hitting the brakes while already getting sidewise will cause the ends to swap.
