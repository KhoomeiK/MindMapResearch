Maybe she'd get less estranging looks if she had one for each foot?"

Still, Fiona is absolutely adorable though."
AskReddit,ffm5ynx,t3_eu0agw,1580049115.0,"""I have a hard time identifying when I need to be improving my personal skills and addressing problems at work and when I should be asking for assistance.""

From where I stand; if they aren't getting paid to do my job, why should they be helping me?"

Art,ffi3jvy,t3_etgtj3,1579964056.0,"Phenomenal! I never really think about such a combination of hues and saturations going together like this. Heck, even if these colors were used in any other way, I'd doubt I would find it as well implemented as I do here! 

Love the subject and her sense of style. Really adds another layer of distinguishment without taking away from the work."
AskReddit,ffi3dk7,t3_etkqrx,1579963907.0,"Incorporate Background Music Mechanic to the universe. 

You'll figure out who you can trust real easily when someone starts talking to you 1-on-1 and either upbeat music plays, soothing instrumentals, or the most evil sounding cello."
Art,ffgjl0p,t1_ffgj6x6,1579907720.0,"That's fair, we need to respect the model's wishes! 

Now, I'm curious about the actual ""horrible"" signature behind this artistic piece. But, I won't pry. 

Ahhh ok, so long as you are comfortable with that call and have contingencies; I shall leave it be!"
Damnthatsinteresting,fffyb5s,t3_etawn2,1579894459.0,I wonder what kind of gun could make this bunker look like a whole chocolate cake after catching birdshot.
AskReddit,ffftb77,t3_et48og,1579891338.0,"What am I, an idiot? Sieze the moment! 

Whether it's the preamble to a long term relationship or just a fleeting opportunity, gently grab their face with both hands and kiss back! 

Then run those hands down their face and upper back and pull them in for an embrace without breaking the kiss. 


It might not be the best kiss they ever had nor the worst...But, they will remember it!"
AskReddit,fffqzfz,t3_et4ma8,1579889900.0,"I would ask each one how long has the Evil Clone been around.

Then tell them, ""Name three positive memories a friend/family member did for you that happened before Evil Clone was around."" 

Either the Evil Clone hasn't been around enough to experience gratitude, or they both ungrateful and both need to go."
aww,fffpdza,t3_etc81l,1579888910.0,"Too cute! But, I'm curious.

What are the odds that someone can use deepfake to swap the faces? 

Would it be cuter if those cheeks had a full head of red hair?"

Art,fffdb3x,t1_fffc3ex,1579881445.0,"I like the breasts portrayed here for reasons irrelevant to what first impressions would imagine. 

The detail in the ""physics"" of flesh resting against flesh. The illusion of something soft resting on a similar, yet more firm surface is wonderfully done. 

Probably another detail I should have applauded the OP for, they have a fantastic hand at portraying invisible forces as well as anatomy"
Art,fff4e9f,t3_et8tif,1579875401.0,"Phenomenal hyperrealism! The intricate detail put into her ribs and knees are the highlights for me. Realistic, but not embellished or ""perfected"" in terms of an Ideal Body. 

The mastery of shading values is very apparent here. 

I wholeheartedly support your decision to leave this work untitled; it's hard to devise a name that properly reflects this subject matter, let alone the quality that was put into it! 

Please remember to sign your work; else I'm forced to scream bloody murder when someone tries to steal/repost this! 

Would love to see more work from you!"
NatureIsFuckingLit,ffciznk,t3_esuffw,1579800480.0,"Reminds me of an old Looney Tunes scene for some odd reason.

Slyvester the cat was stomping up and down stairs rhythmically while tra-la-la'ing his heart out. 

Elmer Fudd was being kept awake by his antics and wasn't having it. 

Wish I could find that scene/episode."
AskReddit,ffcaa8y,t3_esr647,1579795095.0,"Keeping my mouth shut when I need to speak up. 

I spent years thinking some things in life were out of my control. Mainly due to having an authoritarian figure for a father; especially how he'd act around my mother and older sister.

Notice that trait can easily appear in my adult life; it's easy to ""follow orders"" sometimes without questioning things out loud. 

I'm not trying to be that guy anymore; doing it doesn't make me any better than the people who will get away with the crap they try to pull."
oddlysatisfying,ffbct0k,t3_esjz43,1579759953.0,It'd be satisfying if the clippings was one smooth strip. seeing inconsistent chunks is something I find mildly infuriating for reasons that are probably Psychiatry-Seeking worthy.

If I fucked up enough to burn my shit down in my sleep and fail to do damage control; I deserve to have my homeless dick in the news. 

If someone wants to come into my turf and fight to the death; You've shown me that you've got balls, I will both ironically (and otherwise) return the favor"
