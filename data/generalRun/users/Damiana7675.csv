depression,feee1e0,t1_fed1zdj,1579031827.0,"I know, I'm so sad. All I want is for things to be ok."
depression,fed1onl,t1_fed1kyj,1578994244.0,"Same here, I feel like I wasted my childhood"
depression,fed19rg,t1_fed0yw5,1578993638.0,Do you ever wish you could go back in time and change everything about your life?
depression,fed0wy9,t1_fe6iu5g,1578993127.0,"Same here, it hurts so bad. Are we just destined to be miserable or something?"
depression,fe6bhoa,t1_fe5y1sx,1578886201.0,That last part sounds absolutely amazing. To just have someone who will always be there and accept you with your flaws sounds perfect. That's what I want as well my friend. We can yearn for it together.
ForeverAloneDating,fdr85k6,t1_fdovoqw,1578680783.0,Same
ForeverAloneDating,fdon946,t1_fdktivl,1578608610.0,I believe so.
ForeverAloneDating,fdkptws,t1_fdjmwcf,1578508645.0,Much obliged
ForeverAloneDating,fdiwc8v,t1_fdiw50g,1578452518.0,I respect that. A man who sticks to to his beliefs even in the darkest of times. And I still think you're gonna meet your right partner someday.
ForeverAloneDating,fdiw14n,t1_fdivvy8,1578452315.0,You might just have to fight fire with fire and become a liar and sneaky person yourself. Make sure you two are on even ground.
ForeverAloneDating,fdivrk7,t1_fdivf5w,1578452141.0,"That sounds absurdly frustrating. How can you be an adult and not understand that trust is something you need to EARN? Like honestly, who trusts someone as soon as they meet them? I'm sorry my friend that sounds truly terrible. But there has to be at least one person out there that thinks the same way, but it looks like it's gonna be a long search."
trashy,fdiv1uu,t1_fdiq0is,1578451679.0,An excellent decision.
ForeverAloneDating,fdiuxyx,t1_fdi4qum,1578451610.0,"So what's the problem? Do you not put yourself out there, do you meet bad people, do your dates not go well? Besides I highly doubt you're going to be single for the rest of your life haha you've still got another 50-60 years left in the tank and hopefully that should be enough. We can figure this out together, us lonely folks gotta help each other out."
trashy,fdi7m0g,t1_fdi57qb,1578437171.0,Agreed. I'm still not sure why they feel the need to do that.
ForeverAlone,fdi7eh8,t3_elg358,1578437058.0,"I'm so sorry, I wish you nothing but the best of luck, and hope that everything will turn out well for you in the end. Just hang in there, you have us."
trashy,fdi5n08,t3_eleewm,1578436163.0,People like this are complete degenerates. I'm a busser and everytime so leaves a table looking like they actively tried to make it as messy as possible I want to forcibly remove their reproductive organs with a wrench. Like why? Why do this? Does it make you feel powerful or cool? Or do you just enjoy being a royal pain in the ass? Fix that shit asap.
trashy,fdi4p6s,t1_fdi2ndj,1578435687.0,What did they say?
MostBeautiful,fdi3nko,t1_fdhovom,1578435158.0,Your's truly is a fan of certain modern architecture but it kind of ties my johnson in knots when new buildings are placed among really old ones. It's my opinion that they should try to keep certain areas in the old style and build the new ones in a different part of the city.
ForeverAloneDating,fdi1ko6,t1_fdh1f6z,1578434110.0,"I hear you, it's a very unpleasant feeling and a constant nagging jealousy to anyone who does have it."
adderall,fayaix1,t1_fax440l,1576397525.0,"Whenever I'm on adderall I'm always designing and improving things in my head. Like I'll see a car and I'll think to myself ""how can I make this better?"" It's very strange."
