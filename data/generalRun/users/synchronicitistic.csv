It is true that short-term spikes in sudden cardiac deaths (SCD) has been observed short-term in individuals completing marathons.  The data is at [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3445091/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3445091/) and the short term rate of sudden cardiac death in marathon runners has been observed to be somewhere in the neighborhood of 1/100,000.  However, examination of people experiencing post-marathon SCD's revealed that in about 75% of these cases, there was an already-existing heart condition.

An interesting article from the American Heart Association [https://www.heart.org/en/news/2019/03/01/is-long-distance-running-good-for-the-heart](https://www.heart.org/en/news/2019/03/01/is-long-distance-running-good-for-the-heart) details how people who engage in extremely high-volume running (marathon/triathlon level volume) can be at risk for scarring of the heart muscle, and they interview a cardiac physician who was ultimately convinced to give up marathoning in favor of lower-volume running (running every day, but only 5-6 miles per day) on the basis of such observations.  However, the same physician points out that while there could be a link between extremely high-volume running and heart injury, the risk associated with a sedentary lifestyle is far, far higher.

Also, a 20-year study [https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/770349](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/770349) tracking  runners in their 50's versus non-runners of the same age was conducted.  The findings were that the 20-year death rate for runners was roughly half of the 20-year death rate for non-runners, and the runners' mean time until experiencing various physical disabilities was far higher than that of the non-runners.  The authors do point out this can of course be partially explained by the fact that the runners were fitter to begin with and they were also less likely to be smokers.

TLDR:  Extremely high-volume running does carry some small risk of heart injury and sudden cardiac death, particularly for individuals with pre-existing heart conditions, but overall the relative risk is small when compared with the health risks associated with sedentary living.

Who's to say that the geometry virus would have actually been able to destroy the entire collective?  Geordi seems to think it will, but what happens if the Borg figure out that someone has introduced a malicious program into the collective?  Perhaps they have to self-destruct a few hundred cubes and a few million drones (like the Queen was willing to do when she learned of the existence of Unimatrix Zero), but now consider how they look at earth and the Federation.

Before, earth was a quaint little distant planet and the Borg never really went out their way to try to assimilate it (2 cubes sent there over the course of roughly a decade).  From the point of view of the Borg, they can assimilate the planet at their leisure, as even after Starfleet greatly improved the overall capabilities of its fleet, earth nearly fell to a single cube.  If the Borg sent 100 cubes to earth, the whole of Starfleet wouldn't stop them, and so we can infer that the Borg are simply unwilling to commit so many resources to assimilating earth.

However, if the geometry virus was unsuccessful in disrupting the entire collective, the Borg could very well decide that the Federation was no longer a low-priority target and the next thing you know you've got a couple hundred cubes rampaging through the Alpha Quadrant.

I found that I had some of the same bad habits seen frequently on the show (admittedly to a much lesser extent) like boredom eating and being in denial about how many calories I was really eating every day.

I also had this realization that people don't wake up one morning at 600 pounds - they hit 200, then 250, then 300, then 350, and the show gave me the incentive to draw that line in the sand.
