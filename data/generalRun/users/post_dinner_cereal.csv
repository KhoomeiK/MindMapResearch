BattlefieldV,ff51btx,t3_ercqm8,1579577563.0,"Frustrating that the tanks look like they are still just metal coffins. Back in the day when seeing a tank filled you with fear and you need a sustained, coordinated effort to take it down, it was really exciting. Now a single soldier can just blow you up within a few seconds and get right back to camping. They actually detract from your team by taking several valuable infantymen away from the field and putting them in a giant target that serves no real purpose. 

Probs going to get downvoted here but I've been playing a fair bit of Battlefront the last two weeks and they should make tanks as strong as they in that game. Super effective in pushing a point and holding it, can be destroyed with a combined effort but it quite difficult. 

I think DICE needs to learn that tanks don't get support from infantry anymore, and need to be much stronger, and tbh more powerful. Always my **biggest** complaint since BF3 that Tanks specifically just aren't what they should be anymore."

Turned it over and there was a blue-ringed octopus on the other side, brightest colour blue (rings) I've ever seen in my life anywhere and no more than the size of a deck of cards. Flung it as far as I possibly could in a panic, and told my swimming instructor but no one really gave a shit because it's Australia. I'll never forget how small and how fiercely blue it was, beautiful but terrifying. 

Also for people in a panic about Australian wildlife: I've lived my whole life on a farm, swam at the beach most days of Summer for the last 30-ish years and have seen less than a dozen snakes, and only two good size sharks (that's diving regularly in both the Summer and Winter months, snorkelling, teaching swimming as a young adult etc). 

The idea that you're in danger from wildlife in Australia is wayyyyyyyy overblown, Americans and Canadians have got fucking BEARS AND LIONS, Europeans have Bears and Wolves, Africans have...all the above and more, Asians have giant Pythons, Bears and Tigers. For most of Australia there's nothing on land that wants to eat you, nothing that really can....unless you're in the top 1/5th of the country and then there's Crocodiles but that's pretty much it.

An even bigger version of the Welsh terrier is the Airedale, exactly the same characteristics....just a lot bigger again

Irish Terriers are just amazing. If you encourage them, love them, train them and spend time with them you will be rewarded with a dog that is insanely fun, brimming with kindness and a friendship that will soften your heart in the most difficult of moments.

If it was wet though you had a much better chance of surviving an artillery barrage on open ground, so Officers used to send them across the battlefield when it was muddy and wet, which just meant that riflemen could pick you off as you moved through glue.

My other great uncle was kill in northern France along with 60 other men from the AIF when a single artillery shell fell near them while they were sheltering behind a stone fence. He was a veteran by then and had been in a state of near constant war just shy of 3 years, served on the frontline on 4 active fronts in 3 countries. Survived being shot, snd gassed.

Singlish is also really easy to understand once you've been around it for just a few days, it's just mainly a very heavily accented English, it tends not to use plurals and often it's really direct and to the point...but not at all rude.

Quintessential 90's and a song I'd say is close to perfection"
australia,fdmbj7j,t3_elps8h,1578544750.0,"The biggest problem here is the *extreme averse to risk* that has come with modern day policy planning and Government in relation to fire management.

Here in South West WA we had an exceptional fire management strategy, that combined farmers, department of parks and wildlife personnel and DFES/DFES Volunteers to accurately reduce yearly fuel loads by at least 10% (8% is the minimum burn load in WA to significantly reduce the intensity of fires - [https://ab.co/39Rokxg](https://ab.co/39Rokxg)).

Then Margaret River caught fire and it was blamed mostly on the burning off nearby, even though there was significant evidence that the main fire front was deliberately lit. Those fronts linked up and it was a disaster. At least 32 homes were lost in a major tourist town, so the government increase the parameters for which controlled burns could happen (...fine weather before and fine weather after within a 7-10 day time frame...)

6 years later (2016) Yarloop burned to the ground with 190 homes lost and 3 people killed, no significant fuel load reduction had occurred in the national park to the North in 5 years (in the 130 years previous to that there had been yearly burning off).

Shitty, overly risk averse policy by Government, DPAW and the State Fire Service are to blame for that as a start.

I see a LOT of people on reddit this last month trying to prove that fuel load reduction doesn't help prevent bushfires. **It absolutely does,** ***when*** **a bushfire is already ongoing. It massively decreases the ember effect even in very strong winds completely preventing more bushfires from popping up**.  In most cases though burning isn't to stop fires, it's to give fire fighters, park managers and farmers time to set up defensive lines and control the blaze. It mitigates the intensity but won't stop it without intervention and containment."

There are so many bugs and inconsistencies I am actually convinced that Warlocks need to be completely redesigned from the ground up. Bottom of the pack in PvP since forever, but now they are beginning to lag in PvE as well.

Titans and Hunters have been given a trove of useful exotics, buffs, universally decent supers, strong reworks and neutral game abilities while Warlocks have so few decent exotics, if they aren't bugged at all, straight up nerfs to everything, zero effort reworks and entire trees with absolutely no neutral game and practically placeholder supers.

A lot of people talk about the melee speed but thing is you could fix the melee speed to be in line with everyone, and it would be fixing 1% of what's wrong with Warlocks atm. God forbid they actually do something about the melee anyway but my biggest fear is them fixing it and calling it a day when we have entire trees that are practically unusable because of bugs (looking at the entire arc sub class....wtfff) and a class fantasy that relies almost entirely on gunplay to keep up......for the ""mage"" class.....I mean what is actually going on at Bungie"

Absolutely stellar CPU, can't believe how good it is for the price point, and I'm in Australia where components are notoriously expensive. Not having 100% usage during damn *antimalware service executable* is the cherry on top as well....

I will say it does run a little warmer than I'm used to (that much should be obvious coming from a CPU from 2012) but it's spiking to 75°C under load, but averaging 65°C on HWMonitor. Not sure if that's ok, lots of subjective talk about what CPU temps are ok, anyone had any experience with the 3700x? are those temps ok?"
DestinyTheGame,fcgsup5,t1_fcg6dma,1577643672.0,"Tbh Warlocks need a complete redesign in PvP, given the current state of hunters and titans. The other two classes are leagues ahead in term of maneuverability, grenade dynamics and usefulness and multiple, highly effective builds based around strong, game changing supers. 

Warlocks are fundamentally hamstrung in PvP by their very design, and there will never, ever be a large scale redesign of the class in D2. Honestly you're just better switching to another class because if you wait, you'll wait forever.  I mean the only ""mage"" class in the game has to rely almost solely on gunplay to get kills and to push opponents, as opposed to titans and hunters that are given a myriad of useful supers and neutral play skills to consistently wipe the floor clean in PvP

Obviously subjective but Warlocks are so far behind the others in terms of enjoyment, fun and the power fantasy, they may as well be a place holder class imo. Struggle to think of another game where a class was so badly neglected to this point"

There is a front fan running air into the space where the card draws air from, not sure how efficient that is tbh. I thought a fairly aggressive fan curve might help that somewhat, but doesn't seem to be having a really significant impact

it's at 100% @ 80Â°C"

DestinyTheGame,fctau6h,t3_eikhjy,1577937577.0,"It's probably at the point where we actually need ""Season of the Warlock"" to fix everything about the class. There are so many bugs and inconsistencies I am actually convinced that Warlocks need to be completely redesigned from the ground up. Bottom of the pack in PvP since forever, but now they are beginning to lag in PvE as well.

Titans and Hunters have been given a trove of useful exotics, buffs, universally decent supers, strong reworks and neutral game abilities while Warlocks have so few decent exotics, if they aren't bugged at all, straight up nerfs to everything, zero effort reworks and entire trees with absolutely no neutral game and practically placeholder supers.

A lot of people talk about the melee speed but thing is you could fix the melee speed to be in line with everyone, and it would be fixing 1% of what's wrong with Warlocks atm. God forbid they actually do something about the melee anyway but my biggest fear is them fixing it and calling it a day when we have entire trees that are practically unusable because of bugs (looking at the entire arc sub class....wtfff) and a class fantasy that relies almost entirely on gunplay to keep up......for the ""mage"" class.....I mean what is actually going on at Bungie"
pcmasterrace,fct8skw,t3_eijkc6,1577935926.0,"Just upgraded to a Ryzen 3700x, from a i5-3750 (Ivey bridge from 2012). Absolutely stellar CPU, can't believe how good it is for the price point, and I'm in Australia where components are notoriously expensive. Not having 100% usage during damn *antimalware service executable* is the cherry on top as well....

I will say it does run a little warmer than I'm used to (that much should be obvious coming from a CPU from 2012) but it's spiking to 75Â°C under load, but averaging 65Â°C on HWMonitor. Not sure if that's ok, lots of subjective talk about what CPU temps are ok, anyone had any experience with the 3700x? are those temps ok?"
DestinyTheGame,fcgsup5,t1_fcg6dma,1577643672.0,"Tbh Warlocks need a complete redesign in PvP, given the current state of hunters and titans. The other two classes are leagues ahead in term of maneuverability, grenade dynamics and usefulness and multiple, highly effective builds based around strong, game changing supers. 

Warlocks are fundamentally hamstrung in PvP by their very design, and there will never, ever be a large scale redesign of the class in D2. Honestly you're just better switching to another class because if you wait, you'll wait forever.  I mean the only ""mage"" class in the game has to rely almost solely on gunplay to get kills and to push opponents, as opposed to titans and hunters that are given a myriad of useful supers and neutral play skills to consistently wipe the floor clean in PvP

Obviously subjective but Warlocks are so far behind the others in terms of enjoyment, fun and the power fantasy, they may as well be a place holder class imo. Struggle to think of another game where a class was so badly neglected to this point"
MouseReview,fc7vn75,t1_fc7ksg7,1577519825.0,"Thanks man, just googling switch changes and cleaning but seems a little beyond me atm. 

Tried to isopropyl the switch but it hasn't much fixed it. I read perhaps it's some corrosion on the small metal plate under the switch...might have to open it right up though. 

I'll consider the Naga, bit ostentatious for my tastes but I guess it's a small price to pay for the torture that is the double click"

He also lived in New Zealand for at least 3 years before the shooting, and committed to carrying the attacks while he was living there. 

I've seen a lot of outlets somehow blame Australians for the mosque shooting, even Erdogen throwing veiled threats at Australia, when in reality his radical right-wing ideology manifested during his travels through Eastern Europe, and Western Asia"
