benzorecovery,ff3lbku,t3_er3tz3,1579543484.0,yeah it lasts a long time. I found that exercise helped
depression,ff36srn,t3_erehbt,1579535050.0,At least you've identified concrete things in the external world making you unhappy i.e. your partner and job. Can you change them? Or maybe think about how you will really feel if you changed them. Honestly so many times I've left partners because all I want to do is get off my face and gangbang all day. Did it make me feel happier? Nope. It was momentaty and then I missed the stability of what I left behind. Therefore I've had to stop my brain thinking about things that will lure me to false excitement and find other ways to make me truly happy.
depression,ff2f0wp,t1_ff1koc5,1579503405.0,"man everyone on this forum should read his manifesto, he with 100% perfect accuracy explains why people are so depressed and nuerotic. The moment you stop needing to use your body to maintain your existence things go downhill."

insomnia,feyeohi,t3_equ34s,1579444462.0,yeah I know I've come across some legit sciece in the past. Insomniacs are hyper vigilant which often tranlates in being academically inclined and politicay aware too.
depression,fexa6pd,t3_eqtisc,1579427562.0,Honestly you did the right thing. He is using you as his emotional punch bag. His problem is attention defecit disorder and ennui coupled with narcissm. He thought he was going to get pity from you and your undivided worry for his wellbeing which he gets off on and gives him validation. Instead he got real world consequences and humiliation which will not sit well with his narcissm. I hope you don't indulge him anymore it is the only way either of you will get better.
depression,fex95hl,t3_eqtm7u,1579427106.0,put yourself in a real life or death situation. If you survive you will have a different perspective.
depression,fewyzwj,t3_eqtmzu,1579421658.0,so you mean the absence of romantic love is what is getting you down?
depression,fewsv5q,t1_fewqv2y,1579418986.0,so you are motivated but only to keep up appearances. Seems to me that's the key to understanding your depression. Do you have domineering parents? Are you in a high expectation environment or did you drop out of one?
depression,fewqfw8,t3_eqsyas,1579417947.0,who brings you your food?
depression,fetvarc,t3_eqlsbo,1579380408.0,"like most people in the western.world you live a sheltered existence. We were evolved to struggle hunt labour and fight, our ancestors confronted death on a daily basis. We weren't made for this world of infinite abundance air conditioned rooms and free wifi. The more we neglect our bodies and the struggle for existence the more we develop nuerosis and destructive compensatory behaviours. 

My advice to you is to push yourself into a real life or death situation. If you come out alive you will appreciate life like never before."
depression,fetcg7d,t3_eqk65q,1579373895.0,"Not gonna lie, yours is one of the few posts today that talks about something you have a legitimate reason for being depressed about. 

It sucks being at the bottom of the social hierarchy. A true shit sandwich. 

So what to do about it. You could try to be more outgoing and do things that will be pleasing to them but that is very difficult to pull off without them realising what you are doing and considering you even more of a bitch. 

Therefore you should look to make a deeper change in yourself, becoming tougher and more self confident. One thing I can recommend immediately is to start working out. I don't know how tall you are but assuming you are not a midget bulking up will put you above 95 percent of your gamer boy peers. It will get testosterone levels up which will improve your self confidence and it will make you more attractive to the opposite sex. Men respect other men who do well with the opposite sex. It's hard wired. Other than working out and making yourself more attractive you can look into other pursuits that are likely to earn you respect e.g learn an instrument or learn how to mix, learn how to drive or shoot or hell, grow marijuana etc."
depression,fet5dh6,t3_eqjnhr,1579371964.0,"I could tell you the standard psych BS but today is one of those days my mind is unleashed and I want to tell the truth. Here it is. Human beings were never meant for this world, abundant with food and consumer goods, air conditioned and with free wifi, absent of natural predators and the depredations of our fellow man. We were made to struggle and labour and hunt and fight. Everyday we let our physical bodies rot in bed or on the couch we only become more and more neurotic finding compensatory outlets in destructive activities. Now human beings barely even have to go to work, and so we fill our time searching for the only commodity that truly is scarce anymore and getting scarcer: attention. 
Social media is literally a life or death situation for many people as it is the only source of validation and reality that people have anymore. It's getting worss and worse by the day and everyone is only going to get crazier. Check out the rat experiements by B. Calhoun conducted in the 60's.  If you want to know where we are headed that is it."

Actually especially so."
benzodiazepines,feq38vq,t3_eqe0fq,1579336993.0,alchohol will 'help' in the sense that it will act on the gaba receptors but it won't help you heal. Try to rely on Kava and gabapentin instead.
depression,fen0s4z,t1_femzwqx,1579274408.0,"I don't think anyone expects political correctness to override ""evolutionary preferences"" when it comes to brute attraction but what people can expect is a modicum of civility when speaking to other people and also the engagement of the rational brain which would tell you infact everyone gets old and dies, maybe therefore the foundation of a lasting relationship should not be physical attraction which is fleeting and outside our control but that which can withstand the ravages of time and is a product of our will i.e. our character and spirit."
depression,femypre,t3_eq1b7y,1579273011.0,"yes it sucks but one day he is going to get old and feel exactly what he made you feel. It is the most arrogant and full of pride who will eventuallg get cut down the most. Also, it is very often the case that the people who are the most full of negativity are the ones who are suffering the most. He is probably externalising his own pain and inadequacy trying to find a way to cope with what he knows is his own doom."
depression,femp1oi,t3_epzwul,1579265283.0,was there a recent incident or change in your life that made you snap?
insomnia,femkfel,t1_femk3rw,1579260038.0,"yes just in the morning because it will make you feel wired (also be prepared for major bowel movements). For me personally it did work on the first day but I was taking mirtazapine at the time so I don't want to guarantee it however, gods honest truth, on the second day I discontinued mirtazapine and slept great and I have done ever since. In the studies it says it took the rats 4 days to observe significant gaba growth, so it will be a matter of days not weeks or anything like that. I would definitely be interested in your results, as far as I know only myself and 1 other person have tried this outside the lab!"
insomnia,femjx0i,t1_femjljs,1579259345.0,I would say about however much 10 level table spoons in the morning as soon as you wake up. This is the amount I needed to feel therapeutic effects. One or two cups won't do it. In rat studies they found that 0.1 grams per kilogram weight built up gaba receptors.
insomnia,femjhqm,t1_femfbaq,1579258746.0,"Coffee works by upregulating your calming receptors. Think about it,our bodies always tries to balance out whatever is applied externally by doing the opposite. That's how tolerance works. If you try to put yourself to sleep with benzos your body will adjust your brain to make it more excited and you will need to take more benzos to get the same effect. So by flooding your brain with a stimulant your body will react by growing more gaba and adenosine receptotors and you will need more caffeine just to keep you awake. Narcolepsy is treated with xyrem following the same principle. They can't keep awake in the day so xyrem a gaba analogue floods their nervous system at night which makes their body produce more excitatory hormones. 

I would try superdoses of coffee before flumazenil which you can get over the interbet but is expensive."
benzodiazepines,femc6vf,t3_epxgiw,1579248151.0,you're going to be fine and have the best sleep ever
depression,femc2vi,t3_epx0lo,1579248006.0,"I'm with you but before I leave I'd like to do at least one good deed, like take with me a really indisputably evil person."
insomnia,femah30,t1_fema15y,1579245970.0,"It's not a dumb question at all. In fact it's the key question as contrary to popular belief insomnia is a physical nuerological problem, not necessarily something that is in the mind and going to be resolved by talk therapy. 

Gaba A receptors can be restored. One hardcore option but expensive is Flumazenil. The second is exercise. Intense exercise (really intense) will grow more gaba receptors. Unfortunately not everyone can keep up the intensity and exercise also grows excitatory glutamate receptors. The last option which has really worked for me is superdosing coffee. I take superdoses like 15g in the morning. Coffee has been shown in many studies to increase gaba a, seretonin and adenosine receptors which are the main sleep hormones. Since I began superdosing in the morning I've got a solid 7 hour sleep every night. In rat studies they showed major growth in gaba a receptors after 4 days. I also noticed a major difference after 3 days."
insomnia,fem9va1,t1_fem7mow,1579245213.0,Both will degrade your Gaba A receptors which are the most important receptors for falling and staying asleep. Many people who use them just a few weeks go on to develop chronic insomnia. If you have the discipline just to use them a couple of days then OK but you will certainly have to tough out insomnia the night you don't use them. Stay strong!
benzodiazepines,fem29u8,t3_epvgam,1579237395.0,probably sleep for 24 hrs
insomnia,fem1om3,t3_epe5to,1579236870.0,This will not be popular but it's the truth. Caffeine is the main way I cured my insomnia. There have been many studies that show that chronic.usage increases gaba and adenosine receptors in the brain. My receptors were absolutely shot from benzo usage. I've been taking superdoses of caffeine every morning. By evening I can't keep myself awake. I thought it was ridiculous and just theoretical but I noticed the effects after the second day. It may also reset the whole hormone cycle making sure the ones that keep you alert get exhausted. Narcoleptics are treated using the same theory in reverse with xyrem which makes them super tired at night.
insomnia,fem17s9,t3_ep9x5z,1579236456.0,I had a year of.chronic insomnia at one point only sleeping once every 48 hours and overall averaged only 2 hours sleep a night. It didn't seem to be getting better. Then it did. I've been sleeping about 6 to 8 hours for the last 2 weeks.
insomnia,fem0xyt,t3_epi0tb,1579236217.0,Sleeping pills if you mean benzos and ambien will make any isnomnia problem FAR worse in the long run.
insomnia,fem0te9,t3_epf9cl,1579236107.0,"So the whole twitching happened before you ever touched a benzo? Maybe you had mild late onset epilepsy, however, I have no doubt that benzos and then.ambien made your symptoms much worse. Both play havoc with gaba a receptors which are also.implictaed in epilepsy. It's not your fault it is the conpletely ignorant doctors and medical system. I would try to wean yourself off of all medication and heal your receptors."
insomnia,felzzzz,t1_fek7d95,1579235421.0,I found it worked and so have many other people. It could be because we have Gaba receptors in our gut. Of course after a few days I built up tolerance and it stopped working but it was good for a few nights.
depression,fekldqa,t1_feki4hb,1579202462.0,ok up the intensity then go for 2 hours cardio...force yourself to do it and you will notice a difference
depression,fekj9dw,t1_fejk0zg,1579201200.0,If it isn't random should we rebel against the creator? I guess that would make us like lucifer. But rebellion would just end in failure as it is all predetermined. The only escape route is death but I don't even trust I could pull it off by my own hand...god would see to it that I end up a cripple.
depression,fekhxke,t1_fejfh70,1579200407.0,"Sounds like hormonal or metabolic  issues. Try this, do exercise for one hour, cardio, nothing too strenuous but keep your heart working for an hour. Do this for a week. See how you feel."

benzodiazepines,fe8u2gw,t3_eo1zpr,1578930861.0,ah ok. Still I wouldn't use benzos more than a couple of days...it's a long road back
benzodiazepines,fe8omuy,t1_fe78rvx,1578928696.0,"try to avoid anything gabergenic, this includes all benzos plus z drugs like zopiclone, imovane and ambien. They will all put you in a worse place than before you started. If you are really desperate for sleep you could ask your doctor for trazadone or mirtazapine,they are less habit forming and won't downregulate receptors. Personally if I could go back in time I would have begged my doctor for mirtazapine and never touched benzos."
benzodiazepines,fe77xon,t3_eo1zpr,1578911130.0,maybe for a few days you can reach 7 but then your gaba receptors will get down regulated and then you will have to up the dose or be prepared to tough out worse insomnia than when you first started.
insomnia,fdpshq6,t1_fdoacbg,1578638755.0,nearly 2 years however I've had some sporadic days where I took some to get some necessary sleep e.g before work presentation but I'd say no.more than 5 times since I quit daily use. I can still only sleep an average of 2 or 3 hours a night but strangely I have no symptoms of tiredness e.g blood shot eyes or eyebags and I have lots of energy during the day. I'm sure benzo use reset my baseline sleeptime and body chemistry. How about you?

insomnia,fdgcs78,t3_el7t95,1578390507.0,yes nightmares are a given for me on melatonin (when it actually works )
insomnia,fdg5kpu,t3_el3muw,1578380912.0,"It could be linked to your anxiety about body building. You know you ""must"" sleep to make gains so when you hit the pillow you turn sleep into a purpose that you have to carry out. This leads to ""trying"" to fall asleep, but trying by definition keeps you awake.

My insomnia got really bad when I was in modelling, the night before a shoot I knew I had to look good and get a restful night...without fail it would be those nights I didn't get a single minute. 

I would not care about whatever it is keeping you up or even care about sleep itself. I know it's hard though...especially if you end up TRYING not to care! Brains are weird."
insomnia,fdg4rym,t3_el64ih,1578379997.0,"Yes I tried it. When you ask people what does it ACTUALLY consist of they get evasive that's because all it is is obvious tips.

1) Don't TRY to sleep, only go to sleep when you feel genuinely tired. 
2) If you still haven't fallen asleep after 20 mins get out of bed and do something until you do feel tired.
3) Reduce anxious thoughts that stop you falling asleep by thinking through the conclusions, so what if you are tired tomorrow or your boss doesn't like your presentation. Think about how good you will feel doing x activity.
4) Reduce anxiety about actually falling asleep by knowing that you slept before and you will sleep again. And so what if you miss a night's sleep? It's not the end of the world.

This is CBTi. Great advice that will fix most anxiety related sleeping but not at all useful for people who have a physical or chemical imbalabce e.g ex benzo users or people who are genetic short sleepers."
