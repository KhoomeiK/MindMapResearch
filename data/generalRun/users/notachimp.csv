After you complete it you get rewarded with a small feeling of succes and achivement. It's a way they keep gamers playing games. It's great :)

Well they had a similar system at this supermarket I used to work for. One of our jobs was to note down tasks around the supermarket, like for instance moving some wares, refilling something or cleaning an area. After you complete the task, you cross it out. It kind of makes you feel like you've completed something that was assigned to you, so there's both a feeling of purpose, and succes.

So every now and then, I take a walk around my house with a notepad, and write down small tasks. The more you can disect the task the better, because it becomes more simple. Like instead of ""do dishes"" write down ""wash the tellers"" ""wash the knives"" ""wash the forks"". And as you get through each task you cross it off, and bask in the glory of your achivements :D 

Try it."

PsychologicalTricks,fdqlrfc,t3_emn65v,1578669699.0,"This is the million dollar question. I have this, and I'm still trying to figure it out. So far I have a couple of tricks Id like to think work, especially in stress and anxiety situations. One of them is acceptance, just let the emotions run their course, and know that they wont last forever, and will eventually stop. The other is listening to your iner voice, and if it's bombarding you with thoughts of things that might go wrong in the future, or near future, understand that this is all a fantasy, that your mind is playing a trick on you, because you can't possibly see in to the future. For me it helps to ""blank"" out, I try to empty my mind compleatly in these situations, because my past is subjective of how my sensory organs have viewed things, and therefor not necessarily the whole truth, and I can't see in to the future, so there is no point in imagining things. In the end you're left with the ""now"", and so there is no reason to think. Last but not least I try as hard as I can in those moments, to use humor.

PsychologicalTricks,fdqlrfc,t3_emn65v,1578669699.0,"This is the million dollar question. I have this, and I'm still trying to figure it out. So far I have a couple of tricks Id like to think work, especially in stress and anxiety situations. One of them is acceptance, just let the emotions run their course, and know that they wont last forever, and will eventually stop. The other is listening to your iner voice, and if it's bombarding you with thoughts of things that might go wrong in the future, or near future, understand that this is all a fantasy, that your mind is playing a trick on you, because you can't possibly see in to the future. For me it helps to ""blank"" out, I try to empty my mind compleatly in these situations, because my past is subjective of how my sensory organs have viewed things, and therefor not necessarily the whole truth, and I can't see in to the future, so there is no point in imagining things. In the end you're left with the ""now"", and so there is no reason to think. Last but not least I try as hard as I can in those moments, to use humor. 

Anyway thats just how I try to cope with it."
