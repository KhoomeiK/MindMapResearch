climbergirls,ffwso2i,t3_eu8q73,1580310066.0,"Not trans, but getting a mastectomy and implants in the next year or two so doing research. 

I would get a second opinion. 

I went to a UVA Surgeon (so probably top 5% in USA) yesterday and asked him about this specifically and he said that he would do over the muscle as it’s easier to care for if something goes wrong, but to be aware of any cuts on the chest post-op. Over the muscle means it’s literally right below the skin, so any cut that exposes the implant is considered infected and means another surgery. This is not a place that’s usually cut on people on accident, but I can envision some freak accident on a cliff or something cutting open the chest, so my plan for that is to buy more protective tops for climbing. 

He said that chest exercising (and I specifically mentioned climbing) wouldn’t be an issue. 

I will say, I don’t know how large you intend to go, but climbing with boobs do get in the way sometime, especially large ones. I have a quite large chested friend who quite literally can’t complete some routes due to her chest. So keep that in mind when choosing what size is right for you.

BRCA,ffrkfas,t3_eutt1s,1580159849.0,"I’m 28F and also recently tested positive. I’m so sorry you’ve gone through this. 

Combination BC can increase breast cancer but can reduce ovarian cancer. Something to think about especially if you get a preventative mastectomy. I don’t know about IUD’s effects on breast cancer but they do not reduce ovarian cancer. I am staying with combination BC and getting my mastectomy probably next year. 

A few thoughts that have grounded me since I tested positive:
1-nothing has changed about your body, only about your knowledge. You have learned about the gene, but the gene has always been there. Knowledge is power. 
2-this is not a cancer diagnosis. You are more likely to get cancer, but as of right now you do not have cancer. 
3-this is not a death sentence. You are more likely to get cancer, you are not more likely to die from cancer if you get it. (Ie-you’re not more likely to get a super powered cancer if you get cancer)
4-if you follow the preventative screenings and surgeries you can minimize your risk and catch cancer early. Catching cancer early is the #1 way to have a good fight against it and become cancer free again. 
5-it’s better that you know, because now you don’t have a good excuse to not get a Pap smear or a breast exam. Knowledge is power."

truechildfree,ffp6a9h,t3_eu2tw7,1580087309.0,"As an aunt, I can tell you the “activities with kids” are not activities I want in my life. At least not until they’re teens. 

Kid activities are (rightfully) focused at the kid’s development level. Think of it like a coloring book: very simple drawings for kids, very complex and intricate drawings for adults. 

Kid teeball? The achievement is running around the bases in the right direction. Kid ballet? Basically just a dress up energy burner. 

Then activities you can do as adults but also with kids? Waterpark? Only get to use the kiddie area and maybe the lazy river, and the whole time you’re exhausting yourself making sure they don’t drown. 

I’m not having biological kids. But if I were to ever adopt, I’d probably only seriously consider ages 10 and up. 

As far as meeting people, I’m in the same boat. See if there are local subreddits or Facebook groups for your area. See if people are posting events, or post a request yourself “hey! New to the area and looking to join a book club!” Join a church if that’s your thing, or hang out at areas you would enjoy that lend themselves to being social, like a board game cafe. My local city has a group meet up at the local board game place every week and I just went for the first time last week and it was perfect for me. I’m eagerly excited to go again."

relationship_advice,ffcmqga,t3_esufvn,1579802744.0,"I think I’m in a similar situation to your boyfriend. So I wanted to give you some insight into what might be in his brain. 

I’m a 28F and already married (3.5 years now, together for 8.5), but I graduated 5.5 years ago and my professional wheels have been spinning ever since. Similar to your boyfriend, I have had a few part time jobs. However they all sucked and none of them were fulfilling or challenging enough. I am currently a stay at home wife/unemployed. No kids and no future of kids. Not sure if it’s relevant but I don’t smoke, drink, or do drugs at all. 

I just moved with my husband to a new city. We did this for my mental health—which has improved significantly but still isn’t great, and he now travels for work a lot. So I am home alone most days and most nights with just my dog. Again, new city, so no friends here. I often go days without speaking to another person except my husband on the phone. 

The “plan” is for me to start my own online business. It is something that I think would fulfill me and that I would be good at.  That’s been the “plan” for several months. And I’ve made about 2 days worth of meaningful progress. I can explain away some of that time, maybe even a month or six weeks’ worth. But not 6 months. 

There’s a line from *Handmaid’s Tale* where a doctor says “The brain atrophies in isolation” and I’m really starting to feel it. I find myself scrolling through reddit and I look up and 2 hours have passed. It takes every fiber of my being to motivate myself to get up and do something. And I enjoy the “something” when I do it. But I feel literally glued to the couch otherwise, only doing what I have to (like walking the dog, eating, and showering). 

I am paralyzed with fear over putting myself out there and starting a business even though there’s virtually no risk as we are financially stable on my husband’s salary alone. This fear keeps me unmotivated. I look to the future with such hope. I start each day with a grand plan of what I will do—even if that plan has nothing to do with my business—and it rarely gets done or even partially done. It SUCKS. I *know* I am smart. I *know* I can do more. I *know* I am worth more. *So why can’t I get off of the couch?*

I can’t tell you if you should stay or go, but it sounds like this behavior is uncharacteristic for who he *is* despite it being his behavior for years. I think you love him, you’re just being pragmatic about your future. 

So what can you do to help? 
* Get him out of the house and into social settings if he’s like me and alone. This will stimulate part of his brain that desperately needs it and he will start to see value in himself as a person. 
* Give him small, achievable goals if he is struggling to do things around the house. If you want to focus on the professional, give him small, achievable goals related to his career. Lots of people have suggested non-doctor medical fields. Maybe have him research those. They won’t hurt his resume getting into medical school, and he might find a job that’s a better fit. 
* Remind him in a loving way of his past achievements. Not like a “man remember when you used to be so great” way but like a “man remember that thesis for your masters? That was kick ass”
* Encourage, but don’t force, Therapy. This is, unfortunately, something that he’s going to have to do on his own. You can take away some of the hurdles. You can look up doctors covered by insurance for him, you can call to see if they’re accepting new patients. Take away his excuses and make is less overwhelming. Also there’s a few text a therapist apps out there. That might be more comfortable way for him to start. 
* Let him know that GP can prescribe antidepressants in the US. It can be a lot easier that way for some people. 
* since he likes Reddit, try to find some subreddits that can help him. A new favorite of mine is r/nonzeroday 

If he is feeling similarly to me, he’s feeling very down on himself as a person. He needs to be shown that he’s worth something and that he still has potential to achieve his dreams, whatever they may be. It’s very easy to feel like there’s no point in trying because too much time has passed so it’s a lost cause now. But it’s not a lost cause and neither is he. 

So I hope this helps. I hope you’re able to come to a decision that makes you happy, I hope your boyfriend (and me) is able to get things moving and get back to his true self, because you don’t get a master’s degree by accident. He clearly had ambition and just needs to tap into it somehow."

Right now both kids are enrolled in afternoon activities that let them be picked up after work. 

They have made a really conscious and dedicated effort to build a support group around themselves. They call it their village, and it is primarily composed of people from their church and their fellow parents of the same age range (which have been found via work, church, and kid activities). 

They have prioritized what’s important for them for a balanced life, and most of it is out of the house. My sister sees a friend one night a week every week. They’re both involved with lots of things at their church, which often offers free babysitting during these events so they can drop the kids and do what they want. Often times it’s one parent watches the kids while the other does their activity as well. 

And they budget. They budget like I’ve not seen anyone budget before. They use a popular program called YNAB (you need a budget) and set aside money for babysitters and nights out. And they cut other things in their lives to make sure they have the funds for this. They budget their time as well, and can be a hard couple to get ahold of. 

I will say that they tend to do things out of their house, and neither one of them had too much of a hobby inside their house before kids. For example, neither is into video games or wood working. My sister is getting back into music, but at this stage in her hobby (learning the piano) she can share that with kids. I think that the hobbies being away from home has its advantages and disadvantages. You can’t pick them up whenever, but when you’re doing them you can be away from the kids for real. 

I think that it is totally possible to have a balanced life with kids, you just have to be very purposeful about it. It’s very easy to fall into the kid-spiral, and I’ve watched my sister climb out of it once she went back to work. It helps if you are rich, have free babysitters, or are an expert budgeter."

roanoke,ff2k43h,t3_er9itc,1579509787.0,"I can’t help you much in terms of groups but please try to maximize your visibility on the road. 

This means bike lights. You should get lights for front and back of your bike. These are usually LED and battery powered with an easy way to take them off to recharge or replace the batteries. Get the brightest ones you can afford. IIRC the step up from “cheapest” to “second cheapest” at target was a big increase in quality but not price. 

Next step in visibility is something for the side. People make lights that go in the spikes of the wheel or along the whole rim. These will make you much more visible as you cross intersections. 

Wear a helmet. I got a helmet with a light on the back for even more visibility. Your brain is important. 

Wear reflective clothing. You can buy reflective clothing tape or pins to put on you as well. This makes a huge difference in visibility to cars. 

When riding in the street, you need to obey the laws of traffic that cars do. This means stopping at stop signs and red lights, etc. This also means riding on the right side of the road, with traffic. 

When riding on sidewalks, you need to follow the same rules as pedestrians and give pedestrians extra space. You should avoid riding on sidewalks, but there are some areas where it will be safer. 

Get a good bike lock and lock through the front wheel and the frame of the bike. People will steal just the front wheel to be a dick. 

Riding a bike can be safer than walking as you’re less likely to be targeted by some crime but it can also be more dangerous in terms of being hit by a car, especially in these dark winter months."
