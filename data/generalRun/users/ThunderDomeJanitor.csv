She will often be a canon character's offspring — perhaps even the villain's for added Wangst — but this tends to raise further questions, like the character being too young for a child (occasionally resolved with a Kid from the Future) or being gay or asexual (occasionally resolved with If It's You, It's Okay or a Mr. Seahorse scenario — this is Fan Fic, after all). She may even be related to more than one character, or she may a character's clone (but better).
