findareddit,ff50ctj,t1_ff4zwyl,1579576844.0,Your suggestion to call mental health services was fine but telling someone not to call 911 because a cop with an itchy trigger finger might show up is asinine.  Do you have any idea how many 911 calls come in to even a small 911 call center in a day?  How many do you end up hearing about with a cop with an itchy trigger finger.  Not even a fraction of a fraction.  Getting professional help from a hotline is the best idea right now but not calling 911 when other options aren't available is not good advice.
findareddit,ff4zqkk,t1_ff4twxf,1579576391.0,You watch too much news and don't have the time in the trenches.  Making judgements on too little information.  If OP is that close to self harm or harming others 911 makes perfect sense if he/she isn't going to find professional help.  Looking for a sounding board on Reddit definitely isn't the best option.
IdiotsInCars,ff4tl4z,t1_ff4olfa,1579572128.0,It's the same exact argument drunk drivers use to justify their behavior too.  And both too often give the same outcome.  It's a shame really.

unpopularopinion,fep4gwt,t1_fep3vlf,1579311926.0,No apology necessary.  I didn't take the question as bash or anything.  We can all do things differently but I do prefer when there's a good reason for something myself as well.
unpopularopinion,fep3knb,t1_fep0m64,1579311354.0,"Why to which part?  If you mean why don't I give money to panhandlers and the like is because I'm in a rural part of NC (semi rural) with smaller towns.  We don't have a large problem with it but I've seen many times the folks that are panhandling here do it all day and then go get in a nicer car than I have.  I've been in Charlotte (closest large city to me) and actually witnessed shift change on a corner.  A van pullls up, let's out a fresh batch to work the corners and picks up the ones that have been there for a while.  Very bad taste in my mouth for it.  Now, if I see someone I legitimately think is in a bad situation, I have been known to follow my dad's lead and offer to go get them some food or some clothes but have only ever had one take me up on it.  My dad told a story of giving a guy some extra burgers from McDonalds once and he watched him throw them away when the guy thought he was gone.  I also was a member of the local FOP (Fraternal Order of Police) for years and helped with the Shop with a Cop program.  Two of those years we caught people returning the stuff we had just bought them to give their KIDS for Christmas and getting money back at WalMart.  I'm just very cynical I suppose.

If it was the part about glad to see some unpopular opinions for a change, it's because of the subs name and stated purpose.  This one just fit for me."

unpopularopinion,feoq9cw,t3_eq2knz,1579303848.0,"Finally, some unpopular opinions.  I was starting to feel like this sub had lost its way.  Personally, I don't give money to beggars/homeless/panhandlers.  But if I did and I saw them with a beer and a smoke afterwards, I'd be pissed.

firealarms,fei89au,t3_ep5jd0,1579132486.0,I used to hate ladders.  Took a job doing electronics repair for a school system a couple years back and it includes scoreboards (football stadiums and baseball fields) and fire alarms among other things.  I've slowly gotten over the ladder thing.  Still hate the transition from ladder to roof when I have to do that but 24 foot extension ladder on a hill is no big deal anymore.  The more you do it the easier it'll be.  In an open space though I'd probably have gotten a lift too  though.

I see you said you tried different numbers but if you try a smaller than required number, the circuit either possibly wasn't complete or you likely blew those LEDs.  If it's the number of LEDs required was wrong then once you took off two LEDs, your strip was off by one and then cutting every 3rd one was still wrong.  If I recall correctly, the whole strips runs off 12V correct?  If so, then every 3rd LED has a return path after it."
