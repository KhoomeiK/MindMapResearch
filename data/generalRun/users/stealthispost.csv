dogswithjobs,fctzk4g,t1_fctz0dx,1577967178.0,"> It is understandable that making the comparison that smoking is as bad to people with asthma as dogs are to people to allergic to them.

Thank you for acknowledging that. It's rare to see such civil discourse online, so thank you.

> But do you genuinely not believe that for some people, the one thing that they can depend on to keep their mental stability is with a dog?

I believe that people believe that.

I think we can agree that the sum total of the dog's effect on the person is that it reduces stress and increases endorphins.

It is a ""state-changer"" for people who struggle to change their own psychological state.

The list of state-changers is extremely long. Too long to list. Many of them would be inappropriate or harmful in a public enclosed setting, such as smoking, sex, dancing, singing and bringing a dog. Part of being an adult is modifying your behaviour so that you aren't harming others selfishly. Compromise is necessary for a civil society."
dogswithjobs,fctynh7,t1_fctxxzy,1577966042.0,"All I have to do is to swap ""dog"" for ""cigarettes"" for it to become apparent how absurd this argument is.

""Well, I can only fly if I'm allowed to smoke cigarettes the whole time to calm my nerves. It's my psychological requirement. It's not my problem that it makes other people sick. So maybe the people who have asthma can be moved onto a different flight.""

That is a level of callous selfishness that I cannot fathom in a civil society.

Also, if you think about it, it's really an extraordinary argument.

The claim that someone is psychologically unable to fly without a dog. 

On the one hand you have a person who is unable to fly *with* a dog due to physical health issues. On the other hand you have someone claiming that they are unable to fly *without* a dog. That there is literally nothing else that can help them to fly. Only a dog. As if dogs were the gold standard treatment for mental health issues for some people related to flying.

That is really an extraordinary and unusual claim to make."
