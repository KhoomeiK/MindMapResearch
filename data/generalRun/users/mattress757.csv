I think I made it known to my friends what had happened once I found out, but I didn't kick off, and I didn't point fingers. Luckily, once my parents found out, and I explained to them what had happened, they were nice enough to get me another one.

Regarding your story; That sucks man, I totally get that, and actually that reminds me of this exact case. I happened to be shopping with my dad (for other things) on the day that I knew this album released, so I was looking for it in the music store HMV with my dad, who loved to just browse these kinds of shops, with CDs as far as the eye could see. I couldn't find the album and neither could he, so we agreed they must have not got it yet or it must've sold out already.

So we complete the rest of our shopping tasks, and as we're about to leave, he pulls this album out of the bag. It was such a cool moment, this band changed how I viewed music, and now I had their new album on the DAY IT RELEASED! I felt so lucky.

To summarise I felt this whole thing was a ruse to get me to react, and cause a fight and drama, which he seemed to thrive off. He was jealous I got the album before him. From what I remember of him, that was enough motivation. This way he got to have the album, and disrespect me and my stuff, and make me seem unreasonable if I took exception at any point.

But yeah, I guess this is just my luck with lending people things. I'd have been fine with lending each of my friends the album individually, when it's getting passed around like that, people clearly lose respect for it."

And then I get it back. And it has this HUGE circular scratch in it. Plays the first few songs then the rest skip until the last track.

ChoosingBeggars,feexdak,t1_feew9w0,1579043278.0,"Right. And I'm guessing you think that's a bad thing? You are trying to imply that by being trans and shouting about it in their clearly irrational reviews, that they are trying to gain undeserved sympathy?  


I think that's pretty obvious, because that's the whole point of the whole review in the first place. He is entitled, so, they will use whatever quality about them they think they can. But to correct the original comment is to make it seem like them being trans is important and can also be taken as that's the \*key\* detail here. ""It's important you know this entitled person was trans because... well you can make your own mind up about that ;)"" is how it reads.  


It appears to me that people are forgetting that most of the people seen in this subreddit are not trans. I'd go as far to say I think its safe to assume most homeless people aren't trans or vegan or both.  


So to make an additional comment, as if to clarify the original comment saying ""homeless guy"", seems a bit odd if this was not what was intended."
ChoosingBeggars,feewl3k,t1_feevw8p,1579042779.0,"Well for one thing - it's really kind of shit for anyone to say to anyone else, no matter what financial state they are in, that their moral choice of what industries they want to support by consumption of said industry's product is irrelevant. This sentiment you are speaking is just plain ""I don't understand vegans so i don't give a shit about them.""  


Secondly I was specifically asking about why being trans was important since that's what's got the asterisk next to it, although I can see why being a vegan was also part of that correction now, because that fact was not mentioned in the original comment, which I think explained it fine. A trans vegan is as normal a human being to find themselves in a situation where they feel the need to steal as a binary omnivore in my opinion."
ChoosingBeggars,feevfi5,t1_feetssq,1579042062.0,"to be fair i feel like dogs deserve the same level of respect. I'd say its fine to call plants ""it"". That's about where the line is drawn."
