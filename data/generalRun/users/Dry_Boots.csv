Trump wasn't even blowing dogwhistles, he was straight up saying that shit out loud, and they loved him for 'telling it like it is'. Now we have innocent asylum seekers caged on our southern border, travel bans on Muslim countries who don't buy our weapons, and his people are happy as hell with his results.
