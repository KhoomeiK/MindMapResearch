Hopefully once it has mass adoption we can have a replacement for the SATA standard that carries data and power on the same cable internally like USB does externally. I get that M.2 is great but there are still use cases for internal components to need it."

OculusHomeObjects,ffh6c5p,t1_ffh5zs3,1579924332.0,"Personally I learned on Inventor, but Fusion 360 should be able to do most if not all of what you need. If I were to go about it I would model each item in the space, then put them all together in an assembly. You can export assemblies as solid model files or multipart models, so from there you would just need to follow the oculus object guidelines and skin them."
OculusHomeObjects,ffh536l,t3_eti92h,1579923345.0,If you’re not already familiar with 3D modelling you’d at least have to learn the basics of the first. There’s plenty of tutorials out there for everything from Blender to Inventor depending how deep you want to get and how much you want to spend on software. You’re going to be spending a lot of time if you’re serious about it so maybe getting yourself a 6-axis spacemouse would be a good idea too.

A relationship needs a firm foundation that you build on over time, so take time to find and do things you are passionate about together and separately.

Bridging connections and possibly frying your soundboard if you have one is bad... but if you have lithium rechargeable batteries this has the potential to short the batteries and turn your Saber INTO A GRENADE. 

Do NOT put loose metal parts into your Saber hilt, especially if you have rechargeable batteries."
