apexlegends,ff77a3p,t3_erqrma,1579642524.0,"This game is unplayable with randos.  I wouldn’t recommend this game to anyone unless they had a premade squad ready to go.  Absolutely unplayable due to poor matchmaking and no penalties for early quitters.  

Sad because I used to recommend this game to everyone, now I tell people to stay away if they’re new."
apexlegends,ff2gtod,t3_eqtupl,1579505522.0,"Hackers gone wild lately, holy cow.  Literally running in to hackers probably every 3rd or 4th game,"
apexlegends,fevkags,t3_eqef9v,1579398385.0,Running in to hackers every couple games.  Hasn’t been an issue like this since pre season 1.
apexlegends,fenuc62,t3_epola3,1579290874.0,"SBMM has ruined this game.  Everyone is either going to quit, continue making smurf accounts, or continue hacking.  To be honest, I actually empathize with the hackers now.  It’s almost impossible to get a decent pub game."
apexlegends,fenr85y,t3_epypgq,1579289666.0,"This game has been reduced to lobbies filled with hackers, smurfers and TTV sweat squads."
apexlegends,feji3z1,t3_epi5n9,1579175256.0,"Well, it seems there are a lot more hackers lately, especially in ranked.

This game now consists primarily of hackers and smurf accounts.

Time to take another extended break from this game."
todayilearned,fe5g3g6,t3_ensk1m,1578869037.0,"Isn’t this supposed fact a little culturally and racially insensitive?  Does the world really need to know/think that hip hop was able to flourish due to theft?

Assuming this is a fact, shouldn’t it be suppressed in order to protect the public from racial bias?"

apexlegends,fdm225p,t3_elh9ir,1578537950.0,Does Respawn have any clue how bad their smurf account issue is?
John_Frusciante,fdkzkxa,t3_elvfa7,1578514396.0,"I hope they allow themselves to go in a completely new direction with this new album if they so desire.  Wouldn’t offend me in the least bit, even if it’s not a sound I end up enjoying.  We have 30+ years of their music to fall back on if necessary."
personalfinance,fdhyysl,t1_fdhxcqb,1578432716.0,"The most offensive thing about your post is the leap of logic (or lack thereof) in assuming social security is expected.

You know what you’re doing."

personalfinance,fdhxpcl,t1_fdhpzy8,1578432053.0,And that is exactly what she does.  There is no debate whether she qualifies as w2 or 1099: she’s an IC and has no gripes about it.
personalfinance,fdhxi3j,t1_fdhqjsf,1578431950.0,"You (purposefully) neglected an important word: status.  Your attempt to posture is entertaining, but altogether unhelpful and obvious."
personalfinance,fdhx7e6,t1_fdhvdim,1578431788.0,"I appreciate the info.  I can tell you there is no way my mom will go the tax attorney route, regardless of how wise that decision may or may not be.  She’s going to bank on a CPA being good enough."
personalfinance,fdhwzxg,t1_fdhqvmd,1578431678.0,Thank you so much.
personalfinance,fdhwz6p,t1_fdhugvc,1578431667.0,"Thank you, this was a rational response."
personalfinance,fdhvpbc,t1_fdhqmi8,1578430997.0,You’re just posturing.  Save it for the forums over at Fox News or something.
personalfinance,fdhlt95,t1_fdhlith,1578425372.0,"My mom hasn’t been a waitress for 33 years.  I’m sure when she was a waitress her employer had her set up properly.  As for her claiming her income from tips, that’s highly unlikely, as is the likelihood of her filing her returns back then, even though I assume she would actually receive something in return (without claiming 100% of her tip income)."
personalfinance,fdhl7m4,t1_fdhkwsy,1578425007.0,When did I ever state that she feels entitled to receive social security?
personalfinance,fdhkkvk,t1_fdhkeq1,1578424620.0,100% not an employee.  This is explicitly understood between both my mother and the company.  It’s not an option to become an employee either.
personalfinance,fdhkccr,t1_fdhim91,1578424478.0,"Yes, interesting, but definitely not recommended."
personalfinance,fdhk6cd,t1_fdhjon9,1578424375.0,Thank you
personalfinance,fdhjsrv,t1_fdhjcaz,1578424150.0,My guess is they refer to her this way since they deal with “high end” clients who also end up eating from time to time.
personalfinance,fdhjij7,t1_fdhiry8,1578423976.0,"1.) I’m not worried about down votes 

2.) The questions were rhetorical in nature as my potential response was answered in the posts.

But in case you’re wondering, no, not married, but I don’t need a follow up response since the question of SS benefits was already answered."
personalfinance,fdhj8zt,t1_fdhiqfp,1578423814.0,"Everything is prepared on her own equipment and delivered at the same time everyday.  Without question she is an IC, as were the previous cooks who provided food in the same fashion."

personalfinance,fdh9m6r,t1_fdh94hd,1578418356.0,She nets $800-850 a week.
personalfinance,fdh9dqi,t1_fdh92hs,1578418213.0,"She definitely qualifies as an independent contractor.  

She isn’t like a line cook at a small restaurant.  The company actually considers her to be their “chef” (oddly enough my mom is actually an amazing cook and could almost certainly have had a successful career running her own restaurant)."

RedHotChiliPeppers,fdcb921,t3_ekfe4k,1578270819.0,This question seems like more of an attempt to bring up the topic of Anthony not being the greatest vocalist in the world and having the tendency to forget a line two from time to time.
apexlegends,fcq6ku5,t3_eiddug,1577879840.0,"Wow, so this game still is in the toilet.

I came back after a few months to play pubs with randos and this game is a mess.

Nothing but sweaty prebuilt squads as I try to carry a squad who dies and quits right away.  

I would not recommend this game to anyone who hasn’t played it before."
todayilearned,fcitkg5,t1_fcitj4u,1577669481.0,Bad idea
todayilearned,fciruvf,t3_ehady7,1577668335.0,"I used to work in real estate development assembling plots of land for larger developments.  While this couple was able to get their “lottery” price tag, I can tell you first hand this is definitely not how it always works out.  In fact, we had several cases where a seller refused to sell for anything near a reasonable price, so we simple developed around them, which caused their property to lose all potential “development value,” and they ended up with a piece of land which was worth less than the original “market value” at the beginning of our negotiations.

Case in point: being absurdly stubborn DOES NOT always work out in your favor."
apexlegends,f8o40la,t3_e12enk,1574661944.0,"Instead of leaving Apex upset and angry because the game is now utter trash, I will say thank you to the devs for giving me a lot of hours of fun, but it’s now time to move on to the next game.  Season 3 killed this game."
