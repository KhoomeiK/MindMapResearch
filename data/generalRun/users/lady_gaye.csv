fatlogic,ffd3syb,t3_erxxgo,1579812870.0,"Ahaha, I spent over 3 weeks in the ICU, and I'm pretty sure there's no-one in a 3 mile radius of the hospital that hasn't seen top and tail of me.  Every day, once I'd woken up from the coma, a nurse would give me a bed-bath; usually they'd ask if it was ok before they cleaned my hoo ha.  I was like, dude, I have a catheter in place, and a UTI will probably finish me off - clean away!

That said, it was a happy day they took the catheter out.  I have never been so happy to put on knickers.  And doing toilet-things in an actual bathroom rather than a room with 20 other people was an unexpected delight.

Sorry tmi, lol!"
fatlogic,fcu4g6l,t1_fcti9wx,1577972309.0,Kudos to you and your ethos!
