movies,ff8yecu,t1_ff8uujs,1579700044.0,"I'm a big fan of how Mann gets mood across in his films, even in the ones that aren't great.

Personally, I loved Miami Vice and watch it once every couple of years.  I consider it to be his last great movie.  I even enjoy the parts where it slows down in the middle and takes its time to establish Crockett's relationship.  It gives the ending a lot more tension and meaning.

Blackhat, as usual, had great mood, tension and cinematography, but a garbage antagonist, a horribly miscast protagonist and this really weird plot that's so heavily in bed with China that it comes off as a Chinese production instead of an American one.

There's no strokes of genius, no high IQ plays, just a whimpering crying heap of a man who merely finds himself in criminal situations more so than plans and executes them.

One of our Professors managed to wrangle some dollars to get our honors group a field trip to Savannah for a weekend where we went on a tour of the book locations.

At two points along the tour, we went into the actual people's homes from the book while they still lived there, met them and had a short Q&A session with both.  I remember talking to Mandy, I don't remember who the other guy was to be honest.

Savannah, at the time, was an anachronistic outlier in the south.  A place where southern genteelness hadn't died yet, at least among the wealthy aristocrats.

Myself and three of the girls that went on this field trip climbed the fence and visited the site of the bird girl statue at midnight one night.  Apparently some other people had done this too and security almost caught us.  It was a blast.

As for the movie:  I think it's one of Eastwood's weaker offerings.  Its far too ponderous, meandering and drags on for about half an hour longer, maybe even 45 minutes, than is necessary to tell the story properly.  I haven't seen it in over a decade, but I remember being mostly bored the last time I watched it.

todayilearned,fde9cag,t1_fdconqg,1578334033.0,"Unfortunately for the people on this plane, there are good reasons to have pilot control over these systems.  In fact, there's not much you don't want the pilot to have control over as evidenced by Boeing's recent issues with the MAX.

When the airplane takes control away from the pilots and decides it can fly the plane better, well, sometimes it's wrong and throws the plane into the ocean.

Other times you get massive pilot error like Bonin on Air France 447 who caused a stall in the plane by pitching the nose up for far too long because he panicked.

Let's say that the plane has a transponder that cannot, for any reason ever, be turned off by the pilot.  Then it fails, and a simple restart will fix it, but you can't turn it off.  Or it fails because of an electrical short and causes an out of control fire that the pilot can't stop because he can't turn it off.  Or maybe he turns it off, flies way off course and murders everyone before committing suicide.

All three of these scenarios are shitty, and all three of them require solutions that are contradictory to the other.

At the end of the day, nothing was going to save these people's lives if the pilot wanted to kill them all.  The only difference is that we'd know where the plane was when they died.  Doesn't change the fact they're dead."

One interesting thing about Army Band that I noticed in basic training, is that your enlistment rank is based off of how well you can play your instrument.  I went to basic training with a guy who *came into the Army with E-6 rank* because he auditioned really well.  They told him he could come in as an E-4 and he said ""Nah, thanks but no thanks, I can make that playing bars on the weekend"" so they offered him E-6.

Also, I don't really agree on 7th being bloated and slow.  Although I didn't like the atmosphere at my last store very much, if you had intelligent and competent players instead of elbow biting window lickers, then most games went quickly.

The players there were a really friendly, outgoing group and welcomed new players in with very casual training games.  We would be playing tournament games and laughing, having fun, creating little stories for the individual battles taking place and only very rarely did anyone leave with hard feelings.

Then I moved to another area and be-bopped happily into their store with my models one day and it was a totally different scene.  I distinctly remember someone saying ""What army do you have?"" I told him I have a couple different ones, but I play Imperial Guard mostly.  He says ""Oh, they're shit, I'll destroy that easily.""

I was a tournament winning player at the time with four 1st place wins in official Rogue Trader tournaments, and I systematically dismantled his army in four turns while playing like I did at the other store.  Having fun, yelling ""For the Emperor!"" when I charged and shit.

Good lord, you'd think I kicked his dog and spit in his mom's face.  He had a total goddamn meltdown right there in the store and, worse, other people in the store stuck up for his shitty behavior and attitude and said I wasn't being professional and taking the game seriously.
