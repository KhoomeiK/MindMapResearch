athiest,ff1vubr,t3_er49yk,1579487330.0,"The most fucked up thing about the story of Job is the beginning. Satan tells God he's been to and fro on the earth walking up and down on it.  God said hey did you notice my good servant Job. He is faithful. Satan said yeah but only cause of the good things you allow him. God said Ok then Satan, make him turn against me, only you can't kill him. Satan then killed the family, crops, cattle, inflicted him with sores until he was left alone, penniless, owning nothing in constant pain. But he remained faithful. Finally God said OK Satan better luck next time old chap. Then God turned into Oprah and shouted to Job you get health and you get family and you get your wealth back.  It's been a long time since I read the Bible I may be getting off track. The point is God allowed his subject to be tortured because of a bet he made with the devil. It's like the ORIGINAL, original Trading Places."

SkincareAddiction,ff0wa9q,t1_fez46u9,1579472867.0,"I read that azaelic acid was helpful for dark undereye circles. I got some from TO and wasnt using it much so I added it to my eye cream, a supposed dupe of Kiehl's that's avocado oil and shea butter. It's been a month and I think I actually see an improvement. It's hard to say because the circles themselves kind of come and go too but I'm hopeful."
SkincareAddiction,ff0sdrh,t1_fezju19,1579471838.0,I was going to suggest some hydration too but not sure if ok with damaged skin. How do you feel about rosewater/glycerin spray? There are several options to buy but I just make mine in small batches with diluted rosewater and glycerin. (an alleged fix+dupe) and spray before applying moisturizer. Toss after two weeks if not using preservative. It is very soothing and can really be used anytime.
SkincareAddiction,ff0no48,t1_feyycy9,1579470591.0,And no physical exfoliation ever. For acne BHA is better.
SkincareAddiction,ff0mkkf,t3_eqvc1f,1579470261.0,"A derm visit would help. This seems to be a combination of picking and scrubbing. I overdid the ""buf puff"" once and my skin looked like yours. Let me say in the nicest way possible, STOP TOUCHING YOUR FACE. I still have scars and I am in my 60s. When I did that to my skin, I stopped putting anything on my face except a hydrating cleanser, using only my fingers.  Splash with cool water, apply moisturizer  and sunscreen if you leave the house. I use all CereVe products. They are cheap, available everywhere, gentle and effective. 

Its gonna look bad for a few weeks and stay red maybe for months. When it heals, slowly add product as needed. Do you have acne? Maybe BHA.  Dry?  Try Hyaluronic acid. Oily? Water based products. Aging? Exfoliants.  Develop a simple routine, try to avoid the woo. Ignore the shelfies. All you really need is a cleanser, moisturizer and sunscreen. Miceller water is a great makeup remover but I wouldn't wear any foundation makeup until your skin heals."

Frugal,feklbq5,t3_epdh1y,1579202430.0,"I was 54 when my husband became medically disabled. I decided to try to retire as soon as I could, at age 62. We basically focused on eliminating all debt, trying to pay down our mortgage faster by adding $200 extra per month. We have taken 6 years off a 30 year loan just doing this.  Then I increased the percentage being taken out for my 401k gradually up to 20%. With it all in g funds, my portfolio is worth enough to pay off my mortgage. We are not rich but we have enough to live very comfortably  and take several vacations a year. 

Tldr, pay off debt while you are able to make money."

By far the most finicky is my helix. Hates everything except surgical grade stainless  steel. Every time I put a gold and diamond stud in it takes a week to calm back down.

LifeProTips,fef85oy,t1_febu0ik,1579050454.0,"As I mentioned I am an RN and have had asthma my whole life. It read never really under control until I saw a pulmonologist, had  full pulmonary function test and started a steroid inhaler, rescue inhaler and checking my peak flow, which is is a measure of your lung capacity. It can be estimated by your height and age. For example, for my height and age, it should be 425.  You need a pulmonary function test to determine YOUR best number. Your pulmonologist should give you a range of normal, be on alert and you are in trouble. Wheezing is not a reliable indicator. You should check your peak flow every day. I keep mine with my toothbrush and check in the morning when I brush my teeth. If I notice my number is dropping,  even if I feel fine, I start using my rescue inhaler every 6 hours. If it continues to drop I consider going to the doctor. The absolute worst I ever felt my peak flow was 150. My normal is 425-450, my take action number is 350."

You on the other hand are responsible for your children. Are they being loud? Could they tone it down a bit? 

You seem bitter about what you think your neighbor paid for his home.  If he paid $40k he was prob making $25k a year. Perspective."
todayilearned,feeh02r,t3_eop78t,1579033569.0,"When my mom was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer she seemed relieved. She said I knew there was something seriously wrong. There was no treatment offered. She said ""get me set up with Hospice and let me die in my own bed"". This was in February. I have a brother who was very ill, had a tracheotomy and a feeding tube, then had a stroke.  He was in a nursing home and having no other family,  mom was his guardian. Arrangements were made for us sisters to manage his care. We agreed not to tell him about mom's illness because he was confused and neurologically  impaired. She got her affairs in order, made a final visit to her childhood home and relatives until she  got too weak. She was confused off and on due to pain meds. About 5 months later she woke up lucid and clear headed. She told sister to go get our brother to visit. When he got there she told him she had been very sick and couldn't visit. Then she told him to mind his sisters. He told her he understood. After he left she closed her eyes and never opened them again. She passed two days later in her own bed, surrounded by family."

You can test it yourself at home using your peak flow meter, which you should be checking every day. You are not wrong though; studies have shown that diaphragmatic breathing is more efficient.

We got a fantastic deal on the house because the couple was divorcing so we got it basically for their balance. The house was valued at $23K more than we paid. So we have paid the loan down to 80%, contacted the loan company and were told the balance needs to be 77.5% of loan value. I countered with but we now have $50k in equity. They suggested we could have the house reappraised and refinanced, and by the way you could take a home equity loan to upgrade your kitchen..... Otherwise, you have to pay down another $3k before we will consider dropping the PMI. Grrr."
