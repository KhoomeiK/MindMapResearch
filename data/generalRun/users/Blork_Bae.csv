EngineeringStudents,ffe69gd,t1_ffdzu3f,1579837811.0,"Not true. I started research as a freshman and it's definitely possible. Depends on the lab, subject manner, and who you're working with."
college,ffbhz69,t1_ffbgp2t,1579766159.0,I agree with the Roth statement. Don't save anything in the Roth if you're planning on spending it.
ChemicalEngineering,ff7knwi,t1_ff6y9lh,1579651815.0,Thank you for the well thought out response! Another question I have is if you think skills from the O&G industry are transferable to other industries such as pharma or semiconductors. Do you know people who have successfully transitioned from the O&G industry into other industries? Thank you!
ChemicalEngineering,ff6vj9z,t1_ff66o66,1579635751.0,"Just curious. If you wanted to go to a T15 for an MBA, is that something your employer would help pay for?"
ChemicalEngineering,ff6v94e,t1_ff63d2n,1579635588.0,"I am also doing an internship this summer at a downstream location for a large OG company. Realistically, do you think this industry is viable and worth getting into as a young engineers?"
ChemicalEngineering,ff21z5k,t1_ff1dgyp,1579491631.0,I'm a student right now. What is the difference between statistical process control and other types of process control?
bioengineering,fdyxuay,t1_fdu4xpg,1578784675.0,"Hey, can you expand more on the job market for chemical engineers in norcal. I'm currently a chemical engineering student and I'm very interested in the pharmaceuticals side of the industry. However, I do not plan on going into RnD. I would rather be some sort of process engineer. Thanks!"
college,fcwvvon,t1_fcwl9l2,1578039805.0,I don't recommend this. Research opportunities usually require a one to two year commitment and by leaving early after the lab has taken the resources to train you might come off in a bad way and burn bridges.
college,fcwurp0,t3_ej3dps,1578038465.0,Mine only requires it the first year.
internships,fcmloud,t3_ehui63,1577780537.0,"Hi. I'm sort of interested, but the thing is I'm a chemical engineering student, not a CS major. I have extensive coding experience with Matlab, used to code java, and a little bit of Python. Am I an okay candidate for this program?

I'm definitely interested in the campaigns and use if data/statistics in a real world application, which is why I am so interested."
college,fcmlcnx,t1_fcmgxzi,1577780104.0,I also have this card!
college,fcmlc96,t1_fcmj3qa,1577780090.0,Same. BOA was my first credit card.
ChemicalEngineering,fccfjfg,t3_eh09eb,1577597810.0,"Yep I'm a second year and I've heard back from around four companies, most of which I talked to at career fairs. Of the 80 applications I've applied online, only 1 company got back to me. The rest ghosted or rejected me."
UCI,fbitqcu,t3_edmvsa,1576913832.0,"Took him last year. Discussions are for you to check answers to a worksheet that is posted online. Solutions are posted online at the end of the week, but questions are not worked out. I only went once or twice."
