 If that's not for you, try refocusing by journaling on positive aspects (the opposite of the fearful aspects).  You can also ask different questions that lead away from fear ...for example, ""What if this works out?""  leads to a different place than, ""What if this all fails?""  Different questions yield different answers and although there are things that cause us fear for sure, we can make a conscious effort to seek out the things that cause us joy, peace and positive instead.  

Which do you choose to practice giving more focus to? Practice till you get really good at being confident, rather than fearful, it's a practiced mindset. 

There are many paths to success, hope my input adds positively to your journey, whichever path(s) you chose. xo"

selfimprovement,fd4xe14,t3_ek1icy,1578172010.0,"When people poke (whether lovingly or otherwise) it usually only hurts if we have a wound there.  So if the comments bother you when your SO says them, there could things that bother you quietly inside anyway.  If that's the case then the remedy is not about trying feeling better when pple say it, it's working on being your best self so that there is no significant wound to poke.  Improve where YOU want to improve for yourself and your life.  When you do that for you, it will positively impact ALL your relationships as well. 

And whether you do or don't feel like there's a wound inside...(maybe you're just replaying her words in your head), then you'll need to practice redirecting your thoughts.  It'll be like a speeding car with a steering wheel stuck in one direction (sadness) and you'll have to  pull that steering wheel in the opposite direction till you're driving your own thoughts in your own direction (positive) regardless of what anyone else says. 
That's the real power we have over our own thoughts. Practice till you get it, like a baby trying to walk..dont give up. Use positive visualizations to help."
selfimprovement,fd4u3ro,t3_ejwlmv,1578171127.0,"You could start journaling about how good you feel...and the positive things that have happened. You can also list anything you think lead up to it,  like maybe you got more sleep or stopped talking to a toxic person or watched a few inspirational videos or took a break from work, ate several healthy meals, etc... whatever you did, enjoyed and felt, write it down in an appreciation journal.  This could help you focus more on the joy of getting these new feelings you've been asking for. It would be a shame to be right in the middle of your dreams coming true and miss it bc you're worrying about something negative that's not even really your current/NOW reality.  Stay in the moment, bask in it, milk it :-)  it seems like it's worth enjoying and doing on purpose. Happy for you. :-)"
selfimprovement,fantbx8,t3_ea36v0,1576250112.0,"Great thoughts and great question!! :-)  

Confidence is a feeling on self-worth and self-love that you want to share and pass on to others. Instead of competition, it's more a celebratory acceptance of who you are while encouraging others to feel the same - like a feel-good experience you want to share.  That's more or less how I see it and teach it.  :-) 

Narcissism is more like, all about me and then it all stops there, perhaps with a desire to be above everyone else with little to no regard for how others are doing/feeling. 

So we should learn to fearlessly love and celebrate ourselves  - while we contribute the best of ourselves, talents and abilities to the world...  and encourage others to do the same. Those are my thoughts. :-)"
