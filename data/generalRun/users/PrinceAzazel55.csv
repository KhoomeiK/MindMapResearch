Rapekink,felaqq6,t3_d4zzcj,1579217793.0,"If you are worried about how you turn him on and how you touch him.

I suggest this, give yourself to him. You trust him? Pleasuring you will be all he needs. You won't need to roleplay, let it be intimate. You're feeling uncomfortable, he can give you that comfort.

But don't be worried if you still feel off, tell him.

That may be an unpopular bit of advice but, trust and true passion, let him show you you're okay in his arms, and he enjoys it, you'll enjoy it too hopefully"
depression,fel95t1,t3_epojpp,1579216779.0,"I feel your pain, well except you have like a ton of certificates, I have none. Only one place called me back, thought about starting my own business"

depression,fel3lvb,t1_fel2227,1579213328.0,You're welcome 😊
depression,fel3k7r,t3_epoyc1,1579213301.0,"That's difficult to do, it took me about a year and a half of therapy to help. A key thing, find something that relaxes you, and just do it.

I like alone time, so relaxing to low music, soft scented and maybe video games. That I don't have to concentrate on much."
depression,fel340i,t3_epnbeo,1579213020.0,"I have younger friends, and nephews, and both have ended up with jobs before me, with help from my family. So I sit here while their life goes forward and I'm sitting still"

depression,feivp1c,t1_feii1ec,1579148492.0,"That sums up where I am in life now, I'm on here losing sleep over it, even eating at times (I get upset and trapped in my head, forget to leave my room, or just don't) I hate how I have to work so hard for nothing, while everyone around barely tries and thrives.

I mean I'm glad they are doing good, but what about me? Haven't I worked hard enough for something, anything? You know?"
ddlg,feiv0uk,t3_epdxpi,1579147961.0,No he is totally concentrating. That's a training pup face

ddlg,fdkih37,t1_fdkhw24,1578504491.0,"Especially during rough times, you just wanna talk and you don't have that support. This subreddit was a breath of fresh air from everything. I always smile. My friends gf called him daddy last night (I don't know how she meant it but) my mind instantly went here"
depression,fdkhuwp,t1_fc2v2uw,1578504176.0,"Yeah he was my boy, he would always run to the door when I got home, or be on the bed laying down for bed. He would talk to me and shake my hand. I just hope he's holding down the fort in heaven until I get there 😊"

BDSMcommunity,fblmj4f,t3_d7y17v,1576965154.0,"This spoke to me on an oddly therapeutic level, my last sub used aftercare as a method of control, and long story short, ""she gave herself to me so I should take care of her"" it was more guilt than anything.

I love aftercare, and my subs/pets/slaves. (I've been across the board lol) but she was bad"

ddlg,fbgq24b,t3_edb4hc,1576855936.0,"It takes patience, and a lot of it. I know it hurts, especially when you are used, I've been used by subs, not Littles  (not yet, and hopefully not ever) just remember this. The faster love starts, the faster it goes. It takes time to build a dynamic.

Talk to people you see often in the comments section. You don't have to try and get in a relationship, just be friends. Go from there and it will help you branch out"

ddlg,fbeuqg6,t3_eczzo4,1576794406.0,"Something is eating at her. You have to figure out what, but something is bothering her. Causing her to stress and get anxious when it comes up. I've had the same thing happen to me, I was in her boat. Talk to her."

Rapekink,fbdssqh,t3_djxapo,1576770516.0,"It seems very very obvious to me, also unhealthy. 

You are kink shaming yourself. You like to be manhandled and taken advantage of, he will happily oblige, he gives after care. That's great news.

You aren't sick or dirty or anything, hell vanilla sex bores me. You want to ROLE PLAY a rape scene, do it. If that's what gets you off. Talk about bdsm with him. It seems to fit your needs."
ddlg,fbdqxj5,t3_ecq8m8,1576769292.0,"This is where communication comes in. Tell him you want to regress, what to expect ect.

The good thing about GOOD Doms, is control and patience. He may be a bit stricter with you, maybe. But you'll be fine. Doms have fun with their subs, and daddies have fun with their Littles. 

I speak from plenty of experience on this."

That's a lame dorm, candles are awesome! 😋 just move that's the problem there. No access to them. Just buy a house 😋😋😋"
ddlg,fbdoeb5,t1_fbdnsg1,1576767577.0,"Crying can help, but if you go right back to work, you're still bottling it up... so you can go back to work. See? 😊 I stress a lot. If you do cry, let it ALL out, it's okay.

I need to practice what I preach more, but I do know it works. Especially the candles. Turn the lights off and have it lit up with just candles, it's so pretty and peaceful."
ddlg,fbdma3a,t3_ecsglg,1576766066.0,"I can't talk from a Littles perspective, or even a daddy's on this, but it has happened as a Dom before. I was being pressured and stressed, and just stopped.

Take a moment, it might be a small one like after working on assignments, and try to just relax mentally. You need to calm yourself down. I love candles  (wierd for a Dom, but it's good for sleep) lavender is relaxing. But try things like that first. Then slowly try to regress.

You'll be okay little one 🙂 always remember that okay?"

FOR BOTH OF YOU then don't. I understaffed wanting to make her happy, but self care is important too, mental health is extremely important. If it's too the point of that much problems, it doesn't seem SAFE to transition.

If you would like a bit of different advice on how to help on ""what to do then"" there are other dynamics you can get into that are similar enough. A lot even go hand in hand. But if you don't want any new things and want to go vanilla, say so until you are stable, and I believe she should support you"
