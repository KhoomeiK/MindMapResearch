AskReddit,fedcf27,t1_fedbdfv,1579007496.0,Moraly no you dont have to let them know. They can find out when sex is about to begin like most sexual partners. If it comes up in conversation befor hand i wouldn't recommend lying because thats not very moral. But you are not moraly obligated to let them know. You are not a sexual offender. Its ok to have some private shit.

WeightLossAdvice,fd4xyqx,t3_ek07vk,1578172216.0,It aids in the burning of calories while you are running. And even during recovery you body will still be using calories to repair the muscle tissue after a workout. I almost feel like it jumpstarts metabolism. This is why both diet AND exercise are recommended.
