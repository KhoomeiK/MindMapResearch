AskMen,fcvz7pr,t1_fcur61h,1578013466.0,"I was in a similar issue, I had an ex who was an alcoholic one day we got into a fight and she started hitting me really hard. I didn't know what to do so I just wrapped my arms around her and held her for a few minutes. I left and she called me and apologized so I went back over. Before I went there she called the police and said I was hitting her. Eight cops showed up, they were all getting in my face calling me a small man and threatening me. I told them that she was hitting me and I had to do something and I didn't hit her or hurt her. She declined to press charges. All the cops were hitting in her and telling her shes so pretty and shouldn't be with a scum bag like me. They took nothing what I said into consideration. I really wish I got their info so I could report them but oh well.

It feels like if a women is hitting you, you lose either way either you let it happen, you try to calm them down and you sound like a pansy to them or you get the slightest bit physical and now you're a woman hitter
