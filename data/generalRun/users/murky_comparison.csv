AskVet,ffemxym,t3_et6ep6,1579855112.0,"Your vet didn’t kill your pet during the neuter. Your pet passed, not by intention or will of your vet, while recovering from anesthesia. There’s a difference. 

I doubt the vaccines had a role in his passing. Unfortunately this is a risk we take when using anesthesia and pre-medications, even in healthy pets. If you signed a form authorizing him as a CPR, or if it’s stated in any form you signed, then yes that’s normal. Is it unfortunate? Most definitely, but services were still provided. You more than likely have no grounds to sue them, when signing documents you more than likely acknowledged the risk of putting a pet under anesthesia. If you don’t trust them, I would recommend not taking any more pets to them... but from what you’ve said there isn’t any indicated reason not to.

*If you really want answers to why he passed you can opt for a necropsy. But otherwise a number of things could’ve happened, probably at no direct fault of the veterinarian. The time in recovery is the most crucial and I believe I’ve read that it’s a common time for patients to pass."

AskVet,ffcaxkr,t3_espmpi,1579795500.0,It can be a number of things. We cannot begin to tell you over the internet due to the nature of skin conditions being difficult to diagnose in person without further workup. I’d advise you going to a veterinarian.

They’re not sending incorrect/false information though. They’re denying the authorization of a prescription to a 3rd party. That’s completely legal for them to do in the US. Again, can be commonplace for some clinics here. Chewy is reputable enough to where it shouldn’t be one of the sites for concern (*in my opinion, but I’ve still heard of clinics refusing to use them)."

You shouldn’t need to redo any diagnostics, and as long as your pet has a physical exam done by the new vet you should be able to ask for the new prescription diet.

Edit to mention: there are people who spout that “BS” because it’s true. Other than profit made form markup (like in pet stores or any other store), there are no kickbacks or benefits to selling Hills/Royal Canin. Unfortunately some clinics I’ve been to refuse to outsource food for the claims that you can’t ensure you’re getting the “real deal,” but Chewy is pretty commonly used that it shouldn’t be a concern.

If it is the actual catheter, like many have said it’s not an ER. You can take your pet straight to your vet when they open and a vet tech/nurse should be able to assist you, no appointment or costs should be associated with this. Some vets like to leave them in or it could’ve been a vet tech/nurse that forgot to take it out. Either way, it shouldn’t be painful and will be a quick thing to take care of."

Pets,ffaqwzi,t1_ffaqpld,1579742395.0,It’s ultimately personal preference. My pets are DNR due to their condition and how often it works (or doesn’t). But if for an anesthetic procedure it’s success is greater and that changes it for some (in and out of the field) but personally not for me.
Pets,ffaomcg,t1_ffanxcn,1579740858.0,This is pretty accurate. I believe human CPR success rates are actually better than veterinary last I checked. But what needs to be taken into consideration is the cause of the arrest. Chances are much higher if they’re due to anesthesia related complications.

Or depending on her size if they can send you with a liquid, if you think that’ll be easier than giving a pill.

*This can all be upsetting if you don’t expect it! Every time an owner leaves a pet in our care I always ask about CPR/DNR, even if we don’t expect it to happen. So thankfully we get them desensitized to it when it comes to the scary time of owners thinking about anesthesia.

Pets,ffajs0m,t1_ffaja1i,1579737477.0,"If she’s not clinical for it, then it becomes is it something that needs to be addressed? If she’s otherwise healthy and doing well? Taking an extra precaution with anesthesia is always recommended. Especially since the liver does so much! If you really want to explore the liver enzymes then you can ask about being referred to an internal medicine specialist. Increased serum liver enzyme activities is common in dogs and can be a diagnostic challenge. So your best bet may be a specialist but be warned they may recommend extensive diagnostic testing (like livery biopsy). It can be difficult to know how aggressively to work up these types of dogs; since she’s not clinical the workup may be more gradual. And for some patients the best course of action is to do nothing else."
Pets,ffaj2rd,t3_esk770,1579736959.0,"Having costs associated with CPR is completely normal. You’re paying for experts (just as an example I paid $100 for my online portion of my certification and close to $300 for my in person certification (travel expenses, etc.)) to go above and beyond for extraordinary measures to save your pet. This not only includes the expertise, but the medications and equipment used during CPR. It is an insanely hard thing to do, the energy is drained out of you (physically and mentally) when you do it.

Bloodwork can change, they offered you the gold standard of care... which you could’ve declined. However if there was a liver condition it could’ve affected her anesthesia and increased likelihood of adverse effects. So if you declined you would’ve been accepting that risk. Maybe consider pet insurance if costs associated with vet care are overwhelming as they can help greatly."

While the doctors should be checking, it can be an unfortunately easy routine to fall into especially when you trust the technician.

I think here you should look at how they acknowledged the mistake. A practice could’ve very easily not called you and waited for you to pick up and notice.

On top of already being domesticated, so there’s little to no argument for companion animals. The same relationship could even be tied to working dogs and their handlers. Of course this goes into breed and personality differences as someone’s average pug would be less likely to enjoy working than other breeds.

It’s a relationship that veterinarians encourage the fostering of and teach owners how to bridge the communication gap.

Then it sounds like you took her to a specialist afterwards. You can ask them to include a culture. But if they’re concerned about a bladder tumors, it’s for a reason.

As for it happening quickly, the blocking of the body of the bladder with a tumor can quickly lead to a build up of urine that will basically backflow to the kidneys and can result in hydronephrosis.

Make sure to [environmentally disinfect](https://vcahospitals.com/know-your-pet/giardia-in-dogs) as well as good personal hygiene to ensure your safety as well.
Veterinary,ff6xgvc,t3_erzztn,1579636895.0,Depends on what it’s being used for. It has a pretty wide therapeutic index. If you have concerns I’d advise you to talk to your veterinarian as they know your pet’s history better than any of us.
VetTech,fepp01l,t1_fel8du6,1579326550.0,Thanks for the update!!
dogs,feit7uk,t3_epdmhw,1579146588.0,"Where do you live? It might be a regional thing but I’m not aware of a preventative rabies vaccine that’s given IM in dogs. Normally it’s given SQ, that’s all I’ve seen it marketed for. Because of this I’m inclined to say it’s not from the rabies vaccines. Instead I would recommend a vet visit +/- xrays of her legs.

Edit: see you’re in the US. Thinking about it I think theres one brand that markets for SQ or IM use (can anyone confirm zoetis maybe?), but it’s really not given this way anymore for a number of reasons. I would still be inclined to look into the limping further, mainly since she was a shelter dog with a pretty unknown history. Otherwise, vaccine wise a concern would be if they hit the sciatic nerve. But again, further workup is more likely to get you an accurate assessment and maybe something to help comfort."
AskVet,feig0tr,t3_epbvr2,1579137666.0,These will not make his passing peaceful. You need to get him to the closest ER possible to ensure his death is a peaceful one. Depending on the disease process it can be a painful one that shouldn’t be one that a pet should have to go through.

Pets,fegzsn9,t3_ep4fs5,1579106149.0,"You typically just slide it over their head. Please be careful when letting her without it, if she licks or chews at her incision she can do some serious damage. I wouldn’t leave it off when she’s unsupervised (even if you’re going to the bathroom). It doesn’t take very much for an infection or for her to tear her incision open."
AskVet,fegx00x,t3_ep3upt,1579104414.0,"I would get him in, better to be safe rather than sorry. Pets don’t read textbooks and it isn’t unusual for them to not display all symptoms you may read online. So I wouldn’t do much symptom searching, especially with something like vomiting which spans over many disease processes."

dogs,fefcgwc,t3_eovgny,1579053312.0,Nothing you can check for at home. I’d be concerned about a UTI. You should go to the vet to get a general check up +/- a urinalysis to ensure there isn’t one.
dogs,fefc6zz,t3_eov9tn,1579053133.0,"It’s pretty common. Your vet can pretreat prior to administering future vaccinations and it would just be recommended they’re done on a day someone can monitor the pet just in case.

So not like one is more than another, we just mark them as 3 years due to immune responses after being consistently *up to date. Definitely won’t harm her!"
AskVet,fef8u24,t1_fef21u3,1579050908.0,Unfortunately this sounds like a really involved case that I wouldn’t take advice from people over the internet for. An internal medicine or veterinary nutrition specialist are your best bets for ensuring your pet is getting properly balanced nutrition and the best option for her/you.
AskVet,fef8bdx,t1_fef5v14,1579050561.0,"I also think they’re meaning WSAVA rather than FDA. But same thing K9Habber mentioned here, it’s not an approval process, just guidelines that diets follow."
dogs,fef7w6g,t3_eour9a,1579050275.0,"You can’t do anything really in this situation. You’re transferring to Vet B it sounds like, so just keep records with them from now on as well. Ensure you play a part in keeping your own records and being an advocate for your pet. Sometimes software gets weird, receptionists are training (don’t need experience to be one), etc.

Edit to mention if it was over the phone confirmation, Vet B receptionists can’t confirm nor deny without records in front of them. Until they get said records, they have to trust what Vet A said. Highly doubt anyone wanted to take advantage of you, or make you feel that way. Contrary to what people believe, we don’t want to vaccinate when they don’t need it."
veterinaryschool,fef1eul,t3_eotu2s,1579045908.0,"That will depend on the undergrad, I would make a meeting with your counselor or academic advisor to figure out a plan and see what courses cover your undergrad requirement of “upper division”.

Edit: assuming this upper division is required for your undergrad. If it’s for vet schools themselves, contact the schools you want to apply to and ask them. It usually means a 300-400 level class, but again, I would just ask them."
AskVet,fef13su,t3_eot517,1579045702.0,At this point I’d consult a veterinary nutritionist to ensure you’re doing a balanced diet.

dogs,fecs2sg,t3_eofho3,1578982467.0,"It’s definitely feasible. The best thing to do when formulating one is to discuss it with a veterinary professional (usually a board certified veterinary nutritionist). They’ll be able to perform a physical exam, talk about your reason for doing a homemade diet, etc. and from there they have either set recipes or they can formulate one to be tailored to your specific pet. They’re always happy to give you a few different ones if you’d prefer, but some will charge more if you ask for every one to be personalized. I’d be very careful when looking at online blogs or personal experiences, as often they can be skewed and lack the complete nutrition experience.

dogs,fecro13,t1_fecijq6,1578982043.0,"Not sure you and I are in the same sub. Homemade diets are encouraged under the supervision of a veterinary nutritionist. Not Karen’s dog blog, and if people are going to use Karen’s dog blog then WSAVA kibble *is* better."
AskVet,fecrak8,t3_eogia4,1578981672.0,"If the vet doesn’t own the practice chances are what they can do is limited. Unless I owned my own practice I wouldn’t put myself on a line (knowing nothing about hypothetical policies) to exchange services. If the vet is paying normal client prices, then chances are they’ll expect you to do the same. Especially since what is in cost doesn’t just pay their salary, but helps factor into overhead, technician salary, etc.

Edit: ask her where she works and take your pet in to see her if you’re fine paying normal client prices. Otherwise, look into low-cost clinics."
VetTech,fec5ykn,t3_eoe9ur,1578967184.0,You can contact your state medical board. Just be aware the chances of her losing her license are slim to none. More likely to be put on probation than anything else.

Veterinary,fealqe9,t3_eoad0e,1578950161.0,"I would say the first step would be to shadow a veterinarian at a vet clinic (try diversifying it as well) to start with. That way, you'll get an idea of what the profession entails and know if that's the career path you want to pursue. Veterinarians spend a lot more time dealing with people than the do with the animals. Knowing what a veterinarian does on a day to day basis is a good way to understand if that's truly want you want to do for life. To expand on the diversity: I would highly recommend experience has variety to it! There are many sides to vet med: small animal, large animal, exotics, wildlife, research, etc. and expediting the differences will give you a better/more well rounded idea of what it means to be a veterinarian and if any of them fit for you. 

Also, look into the high debt and mental health issues associated with this profession. Vet school is VERY expensive and it's not uncommon for new graduates to leave with over $250,000+ in debt from school which far outweighs the ratio to their income, unfortunately. And the [suicide rate](https://time.com/5670965/veterinarian-suicide-help/) is disproportionately high.

AskVet,fea0wbq,t1_fe9zhoa,1578943203.0,"Not exactly sure what’s being asked. But you can try to get in somewhere sooner if you’d like. Otherwise, waiting to test should be fine.

Trust your vet, they’re doing the best the can given the circumstances you’ve left them with. Ask questions in the future about how often they want testing for certain medications, etc. your vet isn’t being “stupidly dangerous”.

AskVet,fe9ofrl,t3_eo70bn,1578939972.0,"Heartworm testing at least once a year-2 years (maximum time I’ve seen) is highly recommended by the [American Heartworm Society](https://www.heartwormsociety.org/pet-owner-resources/heartworm-basics). If your dog did have heartworm then giving preventive can lead to rare but possibly severe reactions that could be harmful or even fatal. Your veterinarian is being responsible, 6 mos may be due to high exposure area depending where you live. 

“Annual testing is necessary, even when dogs are on heartworm prevention year-round, to ensure that the prevention program is working. Heartworm medications are highly effective, but dogs can still become infected. If you miss just one dose of a monthly medication—or give it late—it can leave your dog unprotected. Even if you give the medication as recommended, your dog may spit out or vomit a heartworm pill—or rub off a topical medication. Heartworm preventives are highly effective, but not 100 percent effective. If you don’t get your dog test, you won’t know your dog needs treatment.”

Edit: fix broken link"
veterinaryprofession,fe9nfyi,t1_fe9kur6,1578939735.0,All of these. I also don’t think the skills vary on specialty. There are many foundational skills that are important (sure different technical skills are needed depending on specialty). And this comment hit a lot of the foundation of what a successful veterinarian needs imo.
