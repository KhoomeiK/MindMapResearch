bipolar,ffx3cav,t3_evlqxe,1580316867.0,I agree about working meds into the body one at a time.   It’s what I’ve done.  I’ve got a Pdoc that doesn’t like prescribing multiple medications for me.  bupropion is the generic name for Wellbutrin.  It can cause some people to go manic so I am taking half the dosage for a week then full dosage afterwards.   My sister and my daughter take it so I should be good I hope.
bipolar,ffx2cbe,t3_evp3ut,1580316251.0,"After being med sick for six months ( took Abilify, Vrylar and Latuda ) suffered from severe anxiety, Akithisia, and nausea. I felt depressed and hopeless and wondered why was I even bothering with medication that was making my life worse?   Then I was prescribed Seroquel 14 days ago.  I now get 10hrs of sleep every night , my anxiety is all but gone and so aren’t the other two side effects    Normal feels good.  Normal isn’t bring detached feeling.  Going to start taking Wellbutrin in hopes of getting a boost away from baseline.   I would say hope exists I am proof that being a squeaky wheel to my Pdoc paid off."
bipolar,ffx0lcb,t3_evp04p,1580315174.0,Do you have a Bipolar diagnosis? Most people do very well on Lamicital.   Ask your doctor about Seroquel for sleep. Getting 8/10hrs of sleep is the cornerstone of treatment.  Also ask your doc about bringing on Wellbutrin.  It operates much differently than the SSRI You’ve been taking.
