TwoXChromosomes,ffbjqaq,t1_ffbc47e,1579768557.0,"The sexuality of someone's body is totally dependent on context. Hell, even genitals aren't always sexual, like when you're using the toilet. That's why wiping afterwards isn't considered masturbation."
TwoXChromosomes,ffbjgsu,t1_ffbd601,1579768186.0,"I mean, like you said, this wasn't about sexuality. Just because it's an erogenous zone doesn't mean it's an inherently sexual body part - that depends entirely on the context. Plus, both male and female nipples are erogenous zones, so if we're going to sexualize them we should at least be evenhanded about it."

AskFeminists,ff7j96n,t1_ff762p4,1579650850.0,This. Absolutely this. There are so many ways we could improve female lives if we gave a shit for 10 seconds.
TwoXSex,ff7arlg,t1_ff5l6k6,1579644882.0,"Before I had had sex I really hoped I would be one of the lucky few, but it hasn't happened for me. Still, how I experience my orgasms changes a lot, and depending on my mood and the type of stimulation I'm getting, there might be something happening there? Sex is weird and confusing."
TwoXSex,ff3e7ku,t1_ff32gg4,1579539285.0,"I just wanted to note that breasts don't have muscles, and are suspended by ligaments and skin. The muscles underneath are the pectoral muscles. I've heard that exercising the pectoral muscles can help saggy boobs slightly, but that seems a little dubious, and in any case the effects would be limited. Implants are almost certainly a bad idea, though. Really, for long-term health, self-acceptance is the way to go."
