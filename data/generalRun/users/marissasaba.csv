AmItheAsshole,fcty53l,t3_eiqbew,1577965374.0,Not talking to you over some money is an incredibly immature thing for her to do. Consider if you want a childish reaction from her every time you disagree for the rest of your lives. If my boyfriend got a ton of money I would wanna know but I would never expect any of it.

I had always been an A/B student, but I started smoking when I got to college and started getting C's and D's. I also just wasn't as into relationships with people who didn't smoke as I had been in the past. 

Since I've stopped, I've gotten almost all As. Definitely a downside nobody mentions."
