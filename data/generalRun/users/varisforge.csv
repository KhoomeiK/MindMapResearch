My entry into manhood was seeing Dolores O'Riordan with dreadlocks covered in gold body paint, dancing under a waterfall in the Cranberries song ""Zombie"".

I would take having a night of passionate sex with her (and her being alive again for a night) over unlimited bread rolls any day of the week.

politics,fgup01l,t1_fgub047,1581126094.0,"One thing I would add on this is to remind people to not fall victim to bullying tactics.

By this I mean, whichever Democratic person comes out in the lead is going to experience a smear campaign.

It will come from thousands of different sides as a general background discourse. 

It will come from Twitter.

It will come from Instagram.

It will come from Facebook.

It will come from Reddit.

I promise you, no matter who is elected on the DNC side, there will come a seemingly endless torrent of how horrible and fucked up this person is and every single little thing that they've ever done that might even be slightly questionable will be magnified to extreme proportions.

The goal is to build distaste in the voters, so that people will think, ""Hey the person I like who's a good person wasn't put up by the DNC and the DNC is shooting themselves in the foot"" and ""the DNC are bad people"" and ""The party doesn't know what it's doing anymore"".

This will follow around with the idea that  anyone other than Trump who is put onto the ballot is going to defeat Trump automatically, which is false.

This is exactly what happened to Hillary Clinton and it succeeded because we didn't see it coming.

The only way to defeat this tactic is to see that it's coming and what the purpose is and to go and vote anyway.

The DNC may fuck up.

They may pick the wrong person.

They may not pick the person we like.

But we have to have a president that is not fucking Trump in office, and the only way that's going to happen is if people plug their ears to the stupid crap that gets said about whoever the DNC candidate is and go out and vote Trump out of office by voting for the Democratic candidate in 2020.

We have to have more votes for the Democratic candidate than the Republican's get for Trump by a large margin.

If there's any wiggle room you know that the Republican party will tweak the vote to keep Trump in office so there cannot be wiggle room.

The votes have to be clear and decisive by a large margin to make sure that Trump is deposed.

Otherwise we're going to get four more years of this presidency."

gatesopencomeonin,fg3yg84,t1_fg3sv2f,1580492342.0,"No the problem is thinking that Christianity begins and ends with the Bible.

It's full of unclear meaning and contradiction because it is an assembly of books from that time period put together by somebody 1500 years later.

Even though it is used as the foundation and centerpiece of the Christian Church, It is not the end all and be all of what Christianity is supposed to be.

Anyone who seriously thinks about it would find that the actual point is, ""Be a good person, be nice to each other, help each other out and do your best because you are loved by the Creator of the Universe and your time on this earth is not the grand sum of time that you are going to be you"".

But telling people that doesn't quite have the same impact as hunting witches and slaying infidels and using the hastily assembled words in a book as an excuse to look down on other people because according to that book you're better than the person you are spiting.

There is a reason why Jesus said that if you have but the faith of a child.

Because kids get it right off the bat, they understand that that's the point of everything in Christianity immediately. You're forgiven because God never stopped loving you. You're saved because God would never let you fall. And if bad things happen to you, and you have some faith, you can turn them into things that cause good in the world if you want to.

That's the point of Christianity. Sure we're all going to get judged, but the only people that are in actual risk of hellfire are the people who not only lead sad, miserable, spiteful, hate-filled lives, but who also take that and use that to make other people also lead sad, miserable, spiteful, hate-filled lives."

Mozart was a genius who literally redefined the genre of music as he learned it and wrote it. He heard the melodies in his head and transcribed them with perfect accuracy, and would be inspired to write melodic themes based on events in his life.

His music is dynamic and fluid and engaging and quite brilliant.

Bach, on the other hand, created rules for how music should go.

He was still definitely a genius and he wrote some of the most well-known music in all of Western musical history. But he would come up with a plan, a system, and a process around a musical theme and then follow through those processes methodically and systemically without fail every single time.

It is not in the amazing virtuosity of his music that we find pleasure but in the way that it resounds with us and it imprints itself on us and it repeats itself and it changes and grows over time according to a master plan.

worldnews,ff76t9y,t1_ff74joj,1579642257.0,I was just saying that if we had too much wood we could still make fuels out of it and bury the leftovers so that it gets taken out of the cycle.

The big picture is that by providing adequate legal counsel and keeping the rule of law valid even for the worst offenders and people who have done horrible things, You don't go down the slippery slope of trying to decide who's done things bad enough that they don't get counsel or defense from the crimes they're alleged of doing.

Basically you defend everyone so that nobody has to wonder if they will be defended. It's another one of those little sneaky ""price of freedom"" things, and no matter what it's worth the cost."
