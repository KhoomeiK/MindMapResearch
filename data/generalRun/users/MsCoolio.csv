fuckwasps,fedh0s2,t1_fed5vw9,1579011292.0,"First of all (and probably the most important tip) don't use tap water for watering. Instead use rainwater or if you can't get any distilled water. Tap water has too many minerals with kill the plants. 
That's why I recommend a pot with holes in the bottom, so water the plant can't absorb will flow out. Alternatively you can get some kind of plate (sorry English is not my native language and I don't even know how it's called in German lol) and fill it with water. The plant will absorb the water it needs and after about 5min throw the water away. 
Then, they need a lot of sunshine, and high humidity. If you live in a country with low humidity it's not too bad. (except you have drosera than you have to have high humidity, so those sticky things can develop) 
That's all I can think of right now ^^ if you have further questions you can hit me up in my dms :)"
