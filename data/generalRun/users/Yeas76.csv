AskMen,ffhusrp,t1_ffh8ub8,1579954909.0,I read the summaries after each of those episodes too!!
AskMen,ffh3d0t,t1_ffgbfmd,1579921999.0,"First 5 episodes are pretty rough for a lot of people. I hate telling people to stick with it but it pays off.

Then pretend like season 8 never happened."
AskMen,ffe3g4x,t3_esruuu,1579835695.0,Haven't worn it since about 20 mins after I got married. Its actually in a drawer across the country.
classicwow,ff90bje,t1_ff85l2c,1579701578.0,"Play if it's fun or relieving stress. If it feels like work or making you stressed, take a break. There is no real race here. It took me 11 days played time to hit 60 just because I did what was fun but what helped me level."
todayilearned,ff86e1s,t3_erwne1,1579667272.0,"I remember is in school, we had to make a slogon/advertisement for a teacher assigned item. I got assigned asparagus, which up to they point in my life, I had no idea what it was. A friend explained what it looked like, so I could draw part of my assignment. Strange part was after the assignment, I saw/heard asparagus everywhere. To make it even more weird, it was in episodes on TV shows I had seen previously. I guess since my mind had just glazed over it before since I had no idea what it was."

classicwow,fespq8z,t1_faebi33,1579367721.0,"I've been 2h tanking all the 60 dungeons and SS/WW is my go-to opener before switching to def stance revenge/sunder etc.

It's a huge spike in damage that most DPS you run with will struggle to overcome."

news,fehv2x4,t1_fegxbvn,1579124450.0,That's that sub? BoringDystopia? When we are celebrating private citizens for something the government should be doing.
todayilearned,fean146,t1_fe96zci,1578950436.0,It's almost like in Asia the horn is a safety/communication device. Whereas in North America it's a form of punishment or an insult.
weeabootales,feahjvu,t3_env192,1578948860.0,"At some point you start demanding people stick to their corners of the world and not do what someone in their region did several hundred years ago. 

We live in a global society: ideas, fashion, culture and language should be shared. Waiting for someone to cry foul or victim because another person's half assed attempt hurts some western-guilt is a waste of everyone's time. Approach learning with respect and don't be an ass, which are generally the qualities that distinguish an adult from a weeboo."
classicwow,fe3kakq,t1_fe3c76u,1578850061.0,"I feel you brother. It can get a bit overwhelming chasing down 3 mobs with individual DPS on each spaced apart.

Not to mention, when they do cc, it's right next to where you are pulling so you can't AoE."

toronto,fe2qcgk,t1_fe21vwh,1578841690.0,"Thread was up within minutes but most of it was random comments. The one useful comment was still way ahead of the media.

What does this mean? 

1. Reddit best for news
2. Count on reddit to make a joke first

Love you guys."
toronto,fe1zbzf,t1_fe1z0xx,1578832678.0,"Cause of fire maybe?

New standards for disclosure?

We know nothing basically."
classicwow,fdxm8ts,t1_fdxdp5m,1578770552.0,"Haha, that usually works for a reasonable person. But we all know we have played with those people who can't see what they're doing wrong."
classicwow,fdxb3cb,t3_enac33,1578767061.0,"Tanking can lead to some stress. Ive gotten to running as DPS first before tanking a dungeon to get an idea of the flow. Worst is when some DPS take it upon themselves to dictate the pace, leading me to be a rage starved tank with no recourse other than to split focus between the mobs each DPS has individually chosen to target.

But rewarding for sure."

AskReddit,fdns77b,t1_fdmv85b,1578591767.0,"I started on a DBZ forum for PlanetNamek, where they had RP battles. It was basically story writing between people in the form of dragon Ball.

At one point, we organized a 3 Kingdom battle between 2 other boards."

Just who the hell do you think I am?"
oakville,fcx5dh1,t3_eiyzqm,1578051927.0,"They had one small part of it closed during rush hour over the last few weeks and it was chaos. A prolonged closure will be like when they were fixing the overpass, a complete zoo."

todayilearned,fcs2yh1,t1_fcrpu0f,1577910699.0,"When you compare the sub and dub, Goku is a totally different character, in my mind. Both are equally awesome in their own way, but very differently motivated."
