nintendo,ff379qr,t1_ff2y9i5,1579535374.0,Teenage mom's can either be the absolute best or absolute crap. For those of us with the great ones it's like we're much much closer to them. Ever have her tell you that you'll be in the home with her cause you're so close in age?
AskReddit,ff2v6k4,t1_ff1rjju,1579525418.0,That'd be my luck to have a smartass guardian angel.
AskReddit,ff1mly4,t1_ff1mfz2,1579481682.0,I've always found his obsession a little creepy tbh. I always read when Dumbledore said the line before as having a pity inflection.
AskReddit,ff1mdfh,t1_ff1lndv,1579481572.0,"It's alright, that's why I separated them like that though."
AskReddit,ff1lkv5,t1_ff1k4mv,1579481171.0,"""Said calmly"" is referring to Dumbledore in GOF, and the rage it instills in about 2/3rds the fandom in their exaggerations of how the movie did it. It wasn't that bad."
AskReddit,ff1jgd5,t3_er528l,1579480171.0,"Always.

Said Calmly."
AskReddit,ff12z2r,t1_ff0q8ce,1579474716.0,I know I've thought about that too for the last fifteen years. If I hadn't turned around I'd have passed that spot ten minutes sooner and that can wouldn't have been there. But maybe like Final Destination there would have still been a car making that turn as I was crossing.

C'mon be real you're swimming in poopy semen water when you go in any natural body of water."

todayilearned,fezoqox,t1_feyr363,1579459767.0,I binge watched seasons 1-5 of 24 this way in like a 10 day period one summer in highschool.
todayilearned,fezn93v,t1_feyl9e3,1579459264.0,My dad always threatened to remove all three systems if I ever got a late fee from Blockbuster as it was his card. Let alone try that trick.
todayilearned,fezlv4y,t1_feypz0e,1579458786.0,Those mom and pop stores of old always had the adult room in them too.
3DS,feyyzo3,t1_feys4is,1579452237.0,"That's what made the variety nice if you wanted to put the effort in to use who you wanted, typing be damned you could.  Or you could cut out the grind and type beat everything."
3DS,feyrxsc,t3_eqxkxt,1579449829.0,"Your point about grinding making the game easier in the newest iterations is kind of moot. You've been able to hard grind out to take out bosses since the first gen. How else did a Charmander start easily beat the first two gyms. You grinded and grinded and grinded. 

I don't think I ever went into a gym without at least a plus ten on the leaders levels across the board. That method lets you use who you want."
btd6,fey9b6j,t3_eqsllw,1579442434.0,I don't need a new tower. Just give us back the chipper!
wow,fey1g99,t1_fewn4nv,1579439548.0,That's probably because you were all grouped.  But I've seen a few mobs do this in the new content which is just stupid planning on the part of Blizz unless it's a glitch.
AskReddit,fexkpue,t1_fewip0j,1579432559.0,"So many times. I even had a printed sheet I'd out in the papers when a new customer popped up with my name and phone number on it. Asking them to call me first if they couldn't find the paper in case I had an extra. Almost never got phone calls, and had very very few complaints over the four years I did it. But so many extra papers."
AskReddit,fexjj9t,t1_fex5afu,1579432012.0,"Nope, but I like that one."

AskReddit,fev7n5f,t1_fev7c35,1579394143.0,"I had it happen in three separate houses. Even happened after I had come home from the Navy. My mom finally admitted she'd hear odd things in the houses too like me calling for her when I wasn't home.

Edit : I always wondered if it was a dead family member."
AskReddit,fev6l00,t1_fev5ian,1579393690.0,I've had this happen as an only child. I'd hear my name be called only to find out no one else was in the house except my dog. I always figured the place was haunted and trying to communicate.
classicwow,feuyhh6,t1_feu7ku4,1579391186.0,Pre-cata I believe that cave was the only pass between those two zones.
AskReddit,feuwgbs,t3_eqies2,1579390615.0,"I've two that tie together.

First when I was like 6 on an Easter Sunday I was at my grandparents Catholic Church and the priest would always have kind of a story time on the holidays with the kids. He'd have us come and sit all around the front of the church. Now I have a less popular biblical name (I think it is at least) and had never heard it said in Church before. So I'm playing with a plant on the side of the altar, with empty pews in front of me barely listening. When a lady I hadn't seen and didn't know says ""M"" listen to Father he's talking about the saint you're named after. Afterwards my grandmother was all excited and asked if I'd heard Father's lesson involving the saint. I told her ""yea the nice lady on that side of the altar told me he was talking about my name do we know her?""  Everyone in the family laughed and said those pews were empty for the entire mass.

Story two 

8 years later I'm getting ready to go stay at the same grandma's house. I left on my bike, with headphones and my cd player turned all the way up, to get books from the library and about a half mile from the house I hear a voice that's familiar but different tell me ""M you need your helmet on this journey."" I listened and rode back to grab my helmet. 

Almost to the library I went to cross a small side road and looked back at the same time a car started to turn into the road. I slammed my brakes and went over the bars landing on my helmet and the car stopping a foot away from me being underneath. Vehicle behind him was an off duty EMT that called the squad cause he didn't see my helmet when I went over. It took 45 minutes for my dad to get there through the massive traffic jam I caused but the officers and EMTs all agreed that had I not been wearing that helmet I would not have survived that impact with only scrapes and a shattered wrist. 

I'm convinced that those voices both times were the same entity. I don't know what she is but I'm glad as hell she was there. I've never heard it again but I know I'd be dead or significantly changed if not for that."
AskReddit,feunntk,t1_feujk1w,1579388305.0,It could be from those? Great another reason to hate them.
AskReddit,feunjv6,t1_feumd3g,1579388268.0,That's really what it would be. The time would usually match for me having walked the route. Honestly it happens often when I'm auto doing things and I like that a significant amount more than mini strokes.
AskReddit,feubasv,t1_fet5669,1579384932.0,I used to do this as a paperboy. Be walking the route and suddenly I'm a road over and my bags empty. Go check the houses and they all had their papers.
AskReddit,fel5wwa,t1_fej7658,1579214744.0,My mom insisted I have them removed before I turned 19 and went off their insurance. When I decided to join the Navy and witnessed how the Navy dentists were I was overjoyed that she had insisted. Even though all four were impacted and even following directions three of four went dry socket.

pokemon,fehw6dr,t1_fehe6r5,1579125072.0,I agree to that sentiment. Along with Articuno was always my favorite because of how it looked. This... I just don't enjoy

AskReddit,fe5z9ze,t3_enldb5,1578878263.0,Mumbo Jumbo. For some reason the dude just relaxes the day. Especially if he's being Bumbo that day.
BTD5,fdyi1go,t3_endfaj,1578780033.0,I feel the double cash mode in 5 is part of why the farms got nerfed so hard on 6.
BTD5,fdyg8xd,t3_endfaj,1578779498.0,"I've always had double cash on. Does it oversimplify things? Yea a little bit, but it also makes the game more enjoyable to me so to each their own."
btd6,fdyf3wi,t3_en96uy,1578779031.0,Did you just forget to upgrade him to 204 or is there a reason a total noob like me doesn't know?
AskReddit,fdydek3,t1_fdwrr4g,1578778571.0,She has one expression that's it. It's like the Darth Vader emotions shirt but with a real face not a mask. I loved the messengers before I realized she was the girl.
pokemon,fcusppo,t1_fcujxma,1577987753.0,Weren't those same with the ones who acquired dark and steel in gen 2 all monotype Pokemon though?

AskReddit,f71pwlh,t3_du3ehw,1573345504.0,Let it grow out for 3 years no trims or anything. Had it cut back into Navy regs to dress for memorial day. Happy I donated it but still 6 months later I still miss the long hair. Even still occasionally try to tuck hair that isn't there behind my right ear.
