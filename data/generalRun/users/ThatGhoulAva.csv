TwoXChromosomes,fffvxr6,t3_et1e9b,1579892974.0,"I've never been raped and I can't begin to imagine the emotional & physical trauma. You sound like the type of person who took a personal & traumatic experience & became a stronger person from it. That said, society's archaic definitions of 'virginity' & sexuality are absolutely ridiculous. In tact hymans, virginity checks, abstinence vows, our clothes cause boys to lose control....What, are you supposed to give your husband's family 2 cows, 5 pigs and 100 shekels for marriage because you're not a virgin (*sorry, I don't know if you're married so forgive the assumption*)

You had no say in the matter when you were raped. Years later, when you found someone & you **willingly** decided he was worthy of sharing your body, **that's** when you lost your virginity. You're not lying nor being deceitful in ANY way. I would wager most anyone who thinks you ARE lying either hasn't gone through the same experiences, innocently just doesn't understand &/or is just being a cunt.

Since you are open to explaining your feelings on the subject, do so with the first two types of people; Ignore the 3rd - they're not worth your time. You are never lying if you are absolutely confident in your belief, and personally I totally agree with you.

Stay confident & never doubt yourself.

(Edit: If these are your supposed ""friends"" making you doubt yourself, I think you need some better, more supportive friends. Less friends are way less destructive than this, and lots of us are always happy to talk on discord or the phone or online games!)"

iamatotalpieceofshit,felfsrv,t1_fekue98,1579221153.0,"You are obviously confused. Please explain where I said 2 wrongs = a right. Get off your outrage horse long enough to realize that no one was disagreeing  with ANYTHING said; rather it's a said state of affairs where supposed role models voice their disgusting opinions. 

I don't keep up on trash tv hosts,much less watch them. There's certain people (perhaps like you) who can get outraged when you finally decide what ""horrible"" thing these vapid, talentless window lickers did this time that everyone is supposed to be outraged over, as if it matters in the grand scheme of things

It's awful. She's a joke. She's trash that by your own admission has done worse but there you are  consuming more. I DO, however, know what the President does because he's #IMPOTUS and not (currently) one 1356 mid day talk shows for bored housespouses with ratings so low most people  (myself included) didn't  even know she was a factor until this. So if I insulted your role model,  I apologize. 

There is SO MUCH worse to worry about from a reality TV President.  Except he doesn't give a shit if you boycott  him. So 1) how in Jesus Jumping Fuck Cakes do you think two disgusting wrongs make a right? That's sickening  and 2) how the bloody HELL you think I'm  a fan of either HER or HIM ( terms used loosely)  tells me you missed the point so entirely  the whoosing sound was heard all the way from here.

PS Ill give you a hint: it was a rhetorical question on why one piece of trash is (rightfully so) called out on a tasteless & unnecessary calling of attention to a feature of a talented actor, & another had the incident practically swept under the rug and became president?

The fact a 2 sentence statement flew over you head, and the downvote bobbleheads probably didn't read or understand either post tells me to just shake my head, walk away.  Best of luck to you sweetie.

Oh ffs....the post history.  Anime, Wendy Williams and CoD. Block, bleach apply liberally and repeat."
iamatotalpieceofshit,fek4zn6,t3_ephn60,1579192727.0,So making fun of a unnoticable cleft palate makes you a blacklisted talentless hack ; making fun of a disabled reporter on tv makes you President. Cool.
guineapigs,fehi6o9,t1_feh57es,1579117043.0,"LOL I didn't want to say this, as the last male I had was back in college,  but Crater Head (he was a white crested and I'm not ashamed of his name!) was, um, obviously male. I swear he looked like he was playing leapfrog with two midgets. I really tried not to look. 

I would guess if a breeder told me they're female, I would tend to trust them. They popcorn, play, run, and hide so much, it's plausible. If it didn't happen so fast, then maybe I'd question it more as there's a lot more handling involved. But once you see them and know what they are, it's like....how the hell can you run with those?!"

nosleep,fe00w64,t3_enbtw3,1578800367.0,"You're creating a great story and with some development, your characters could be very interesting as well.

If I could make a constructive suggestion (and please don't take it as a negative opinion!), it would be to go back and read your paragraph & sentence structure. Ask yourself: ""does this flow correctly? Is it confusing? Does it need more explanation, description or should it be formatted differently?""

Look to eliminate run on sentences and use proper grammar, punctuation and spelling. Nothing pulls me from a world or story that an author is trying to create faster those issues. Some are easily overlooked, but others can be a barrier to immersion.

I say this with encouragement! I'm certainly not a writer (Apparently you need talent for that) or even anyone of semi-importance but I enjoy reading what writers create as they develop their craft. Keep it up! We will watch your career with great interest."
