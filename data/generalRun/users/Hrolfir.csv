If I don’t get a solid dream in my sleep I don’t feel rested and I can remember my dreams really well too for a long period of time.

I once had a dream where melting snow revealed a ruin and when I explored it I came across a blood soaked lich like monster and a girl who had committed murders in the area. Something woke me up and I was disappointed I didn’t get to finish it. I went back to sleep and was exploring woods trying to get back to it and was unable to find it.

Lucid dreaming is nice. Just need to realize dreams are dreams. Hard to do that in sleep though. I was plagued by nightmares as a kid and eventually was able too, just always remembered I had gone to sleep. It’s also near impossible to just ‘take control’ over a dream and do anything in them. I find I was up doing that. Just as much control in dreams as in real life, can only control yourself."

Sometimes you just get in a slump and need a break though the way you’ve worded it... a therapist may be a good idea.


Personal experience and what worked for me, may not work for you. I got real sick over the holidays and my mental state wasn’t right. I didn’t want to play, my performance was shit. It just wasn’t “me”. Hockey is one of the few things I deeply enjoy and it gives me an opportunity to get out and socialize and for me to start dreading it, simply wasn’t right.


Turned out I was seriously dehydrated on both H20 and severely lacking vitamins and minerals.

I grabbed Nuun tablets; Vitamins, Boost, and sport/active. I drank 1 Vitamin first thing in the morning, a glass of water after, then a Boost tablet once I started getting things going like chores, exercising, walking the dog. Once I finished it I would drink a couple glasses of water and if I needed anymore I would drink the sport/active Nuun such as before a game or mid afternoon.


I have felt bloody amazing after doing this. Given I don’t eat much and I needed the supplements badly. Just the amount I’ve focused on proper hydration recently,  mind and physical shape is better than it ever was before getting sick. It sound ridiculous, how could simply being dehydrated make you feel like crap mentally? It does and it’s one of the sneaky signs of it.

I’ve gone to Kennesky in person, great staff they repaired my pads free of charge when they saw me using their strapping system. Had to get the sliding surface on my G4’s patched."
hockeygoalies,ff4qcaj,t1_ff4bio3,1579569897.0,"All good! I really wanted to like the G4 straps because I though having my skate slide along the strap was great, the pad would be able to adjust itself for whatever I was doing in terms of lateral movement. That wasn’t the case, no give at all regardless of trying to break it in and alterations. Plus it being that wide and that tough, it’s even difficult to rotate your foot in the boot of the pad. The warrior toe strap causes way too much strain. The boot strap is the same though since I use a Lundy loop, I like the strap being that wide, and I can adjust it tighter as it wears down with ease. If the toe strap were made the same as the boot strap it might not be so bad. Who knows.

I do know Kennesky is a godsend for the toes on G4’s."
hockeygoalies,ff49rpf,t1_ff42coe,1579558640.0,"I switched to them myself and it’s been amazing. They have insane stretch and pull right back into position. I fought with my G4 straps, adding hooks, trying to increase the length and even contacted warrior and they told me to boil them and set them out to dry in a stretched manner. The straps are too wide and too tense. They don’t have much stretch to begin with.

A Kennesky cord elastic is just that, a cord with several strands of elastic in it. The grade they use is amazing and there is plenty of length to the cord to adjust. I use a 4.5 size skate (yeah, I have tiny feet) and I run it once through the toe of my skate, the. Back through in front of the trigger for the blade. Velcro it on top where me foot meets my shin.

I can pull the pad away from my leg at the boot, rotate it either direction and my leg is not forced to follow with the pad, however, once I release it the pad is forced to follow my leg and bounces back right where it should.

The G4 strap, no matter what I did, my foot was affixed to the boot of my pad and caused strain as well as preventing me from having a good attack angle while sliding.

The G4 strap, the way the elastic is woven into it is more of a horizontal pattern following the width of the strap as apposed to 8-12 strands of elastic stretching freely in a vertical fashion wrapped in cord rather than woven into it. The elastic being woven the way it is on the G4 strap is what makes it so damn tough to stretch. That isn’t necessarily a good thing. Yeah, it’ll pull itself back into place though it doesn’t even stretch far to begin with.


My old pads I sold to a goalie who wanted G4’s really bad and I provided the Kennesky toe ties I used on those and the old G4 straps I had. They decided to try the stock straps first and didn’t like the pads. Too much strain on their ankle, knee, and hips. Not enough give at the toe. The moment they tried the Kennesky ones, absolutely no complaints."

Sprained neck, bruised up collarbone and abdomen. I cried when it happened though soon as the pain stopped I couldn’t wait to get back on. I got lucky and part of it was me being only 8 at the time on how I walked away from it. These days I kinda have the same attitude of

When your leg is strapped to a pad like that it isn’t so much the knee in that position that’s the issue, it’s your ankle being placed at an odd angle tightening all the tendons up to your knee then your hip.

Never had an issue since and even when players don’t stop and fall on me, because my pads can rotate freely and still pop back into position I haven’t gotten seriously injured that way.

The G4 strap is way too tight and pins your toes against the boot of the pad. Not only do you loose a large amount of attack angle on butterfly slides, pad just contacts the ice way too soon using it, it’s bloody painful having your leg movements tied that tightly to the pad.

I’m in a same sex relationship and one of my relatives whom I love to death found out. We discussed it and where they said that they don’t agree with it or think it’s right, it is not their place to tell me what I do with my life. Just in their house they ask I be respectful of their beliefs and not flaunt it or shove it down their throat in attempts to alter their view and I be respectful of the way they live.

I agree with this as I’m the same myself. Everyone has a right to live their life as I have a right to live mine. If you don’t try to hurt, use, or mold people into something they’re not.... lets share a cold one and make a wonderful conversation of what interests each other and just listen. The worlds a big and beautiful place we all have so little time in so, may as well learn what you can and enjoy people you meet.

For example, I’ll use religion here. Yes a touchy subject. When I’m in someone else’s home and they say prayer or do whatever they do for their worship, I will respectfully remain quiet and ensure I do nothing to distract them from their proceedings. Ie; I don’t talk during it or mess around with my phone. Don’t scoff or laugh at it just because what their doing is not something I’d do. I don’t participate in it however. This is appreciated in wherever I go and people likewise treat me with respect for it. I also enjoy talking to people to learn more about it so that I can be more respectful in these situations. Plus it always makes good conversation when you listen and just ask for information. Helps people feel included, appreciated and not seen in a negative light. Just makes people feel good to be themselves.

Basically it isn’t in anyones place to judge. This doctor could have said “I’m sorry I don’t agree with this personally and I comfortably cannot refer you to people that can.” and been much nicer about it instead of making you feel like dirt and being an awful person. Don’t conform, simply respect others in a situation given.

Just because people don’t agree with things doesn’t mean anyone has to forget that we are all individuals and each have our own set of beliefs, ideals, and reasons for doing things a certain way.

People that verbally, physically, or emotionally hurt people I do not care for and will not associate myself with. My time is better spent on other things. Certainly not worth worrying over. You shouldn’t either :)

Find yourself another GP, and don’t be too torn up over it. Go to that PP two hours away, do what you need to in order to get the aid you seek if it’s important to you. Spend those two hours driving and know it’s better spent that trying to get help from someone who doesn’t want to help you.

You’ll be just fine, things will work out for you. Just keep your chin up and keep pushing forward. Know what you do is affecting only your life and your husband. Anyone who says otherwise and frets over this, protesters, doctors against it and whatnot.... it won’t effect their life in the end regardless of the result. This is for yourself and your husband.

hockeygoalies,fdecdnx,t1_fde29rp,1578335950.0,"It flexes horribly. Basically if you took a slow-mo shot of a puck going 60-90 mph striking the mask you’d see the mask flex at the point of impact. That then gets transferred right to your noggin on a precision spot resulting in various head injuries.

A kevlar mask or carbon fibre doesn’t flex like this. It may have small amounts, and I mean small, to prevent the mask from cracking on a shot. Because of this stiffness when a puck strikes these masks it doesn’t flex inwards at the point of contact rather it properly deflects the puck and the impact is spread over the entirety of your mask reducing what is transferred to your head if any.

If you think of the impact of a puck hitting a mask like a shockwave that spreads throughout the surface it’s easy to visualize the physics of it. When material absorbs and bends rather than spreads it out over a surface it gives greater energy transfer.

When looking at masks you want to make sure it has no flex or very little by taking each hand on the rear sides of the mask and pressing inwards. If it’s easy to bend, it’s not good.

Also the foams play a good part as well, the foam acts as a buffer to further reduce the travel of energy to your head. You want foams that are soft, though sturdy. Some foams are really tough against the mask surface and just a tiny layer of soft right where it sits on your face. As foam hardens over the years it does need to be replaced.

Your mask should sit flush on your face, cheeks contacting the front sides and chin comfortably in the chin cup/sling. The top edge of the opening of your mask should be about an inch or slightly less above your eyebrow.  Your face shouldn’t be squished though it should be clear the mask is held in place and is making even contact. This is for taking pucks off the front of the mask, you want it to depress evenly on your face to reduce chance of injury. Your eyes, if using a birdcage or certified cat eye should be looking through the second most top holes as well. I don’t recommend using a standard cat eye for this as it’s too much room for error. Once the fit is checked though, fee free to pop a cat eye on there of course!

The back plate of the mask should be snug and no openings at all to the back of your head between the mask itself. A slight overlap, where the rear of your mask cones past the backplate a bit is excellent.


If fitted properly, you should be able to grab the cage and move your head left to right without any loose head movement. Your head should be dragged with the mask while doing this. Also push down on the cage towards your face to make sure the contact is even.

Chin cups and slings are meant to act as a shock as well when players, sticks or pucks hit you in the face. Keeps the mask from depressing too far on your face and smashing your jaw and possible teeth out. If your chin cup sits right against the chin of the mask, it isn’t going to be doing anything for protection.


I hope this info helps!

I recommend OTNY for a custom mask. Affordable and you can even get it repaired there when it needs it. I use a Bauer NME VTX myself and where I love the thing and it’s done an excellent job for me, I even had it painted.... the cost isn’t worth it compared to a custom."

Up or downshift to respond to road hazards or adjust speed in a turn in response to traffic as well. Not something that should become a habit on every turn, just knowing the skill and being comfortable with it is a very valuable too to add to the motorcycle skill kit :)"

If using your own bike make sure you have frame sliders or a crash cage as even some of the most skilled riders tip during these."
motorcycles,fde5uuz,t3_ekppjy,1578331844.0,"Revving your engine serves zero purpose in accident prevention. Regardless of how loud it is, a car with its windows rolled up and music playing or a little old lady with hearing aids will not respond to sound. This fact is easy to forget on a motorcycle because we hear everything and use our hearing to help prevent accidents. Car drivers often disregard this skill or are so muted from people slapping loud exhausts on their cars that they think it’s just another car.

Slowly squeezing the break and going slower in a known problem area would’ve been beneficial and likely prevented this. It would add 2-10 seconds to commute time to break properly.

Glad you’re ok, hope you get everything fixed up and back on the road with some new knowledge and skills!"

Also make sure your helmet is properly fitted and full face as to reduce sound further. A good windscreen with the clip on the top, cannot think of what they’re called right now to save my life, will help as well."

hockeygoalies,fd7flpl,t3_ek6p27,1578203709.0,"If you want really good knee pads look into PAW, protective athletic wear. There is a facebook for it and a website. Fully custom to you, size and materials, amazing knee pads. Expensive though. Worth every penny in my opinion. One of my leagues has some previous team canada players in it and I’ve taken a slapper off of them. No pain, puck stopped, no bruise later! No annoying loose cap like on the warrior ones either. I did use warrior and they were nice, too bulky for my liking and the top cap would push against my pads and get hung on them. Was happy to have that problem solved.

If you see anything you want added or adjusted the lady who makes them will do what she can. I had mine bulked up a little on the inside of the knee for some extra precaution as I play with beginners as well in another league and some don’t realize you’re not supposed to dig in goalie equipment. Has saved my knees from sticks as well."

I use the knee pads myself and can’t say enough good things about them. Contact PAW on Facebook for any questions. They’re expensive though 100% customized to you down to the size.

He uses it to balance himself standing still or walking slowly he’s not in pain and surprisingly happy. Following me and my wife around the house, yelling to be picked up for cuddles, his food bowl being empty, or to be placed on the bed as he can’t jump anymore. Normal cat things! He thunders around the house when he’s running though... the thump of his hobbling is enough to wake the dead."

Baseball bat is about the best way to test impact though. Against a car or roadway, those impact testers going off isn’t good.

Only thing is that shirt was designed to be worn under other jackets for maximum protection. No one ever does. No idea how reliable the Stryker vest is though. Wanted to get one for summer riding, not so sure it and all of the elbow pads and knee pads are reliable enough. I got some Icon gloves and the palms stitching came undone from throttle use. It’s just separating from the rest of the glove and will do absolutely nothing in a crash now."
motorcycles,fck6epb,t3_egnxmd,1577717888.0,"No, they don’t block out the correct sound frequencies. The silicon tip increases sound transfer from the bike and road which mutes spoken word and allows vehicle engine noises as opposed to a foam earplugs muting the vibrations of that and allowing you to hear spoken word and other noises emitted from vehicles like horns, sirens and such.

Just sealing your ear isn’t a guarantee for ear protection. The worst noises while on a bike is wind and engine noise as is the engine noise of other vehicles. That’s the stuff you’re aiming to cut out.

Absolute best thing to do is install a Bluetooth helmet speaker and use foam earplugs. The ones you’d wear around heavy machinery in a warehouse are great and blocks out exactly what you need while allowing you to still hear your surroundings.


Sadly, those Bluetooth speakers are expensive. Currently I use the regular air pods, no silicon tip with just an ear hook to hold them in place. I have a good fitting helmet and all though it isn’t enough once I’m on a highway. I use them simply so I can make emergency phone calls if needed with ease or use siri to set directions for me and won’t use the pros because they block out too much of what I need to hear.

Anyways, what you wear is preference. Awareness is key while driving however and that’s hearing included. I not only want to see the driver coming up in my mirror, I want to hear how fast he’s approaching too."
hockeyplayers,fc4m5s9,t3_efvjxg,1577420778.0,"When I started I played as a winger, I loved ice hockey and honestly I naturally wanted to defend the puck and the goalie at the time would thank me profusely for some help in saves. Noticed that I rarely took my eyes off the puck and then started showing me stuff in the net. The stance came naturally and I found I really liked the perspective from the net as well as the movement. 

Anyways, start with wing and figure out what you really enjoy on the ice, you will fall in where you should be in due time, it just happens as you play!"
