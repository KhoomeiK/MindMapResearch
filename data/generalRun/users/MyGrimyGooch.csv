WRXSTi,ffs680i,t3_eur1xb,1580174148.0,"One good slap of the mat wrapping around in just the right way will yoink that thing right off. Wouldn’t risk it,had a mirror ripped off before and then crushed by the automatic track that pushes you through. Wasn’t in a newer car so it could’ve been old plastic but still, not ideal."
TalesFromThePizzaGuy,ffs4n5g,t3_eupcf9,1580173029.0,"Bro I just had a guy not tip me cause he didn’t get charged for a delivery fee. I said it’s fine it was our mistake you save money this time, no biggie. He acted like it was a bad thing lol."
ABoringDystopia,ffpbnyw,t1_ffp5zhc,1580091032.0,"Salt on the roads eat your underside alive. New cars will have rusted out framerails within 5 years in states that salt during winter. States without salting cars last 25+ before you even notice rust, and even then it’s usually minimal. Auto makers love road salting, means you’ll need a new car about every 5 years unless you love dumping money into old rusty car that practically needs everything replaced at that point. Watch the South Main Auto Repair YouTube if you want to see how rust affects new cars. Based in New York."
BeardedDragons,ffivgtu,t1_ffitp2i,1579983686.0,"That is 100% their shit. There food shouldn’t be stuck to them, it should be stuck to the roof of their container. If it’s stuck there then the only thing to get stuck on the worms is poop. It’s the same color coming out as it goes in."
BeardedDragons,ffisr63,t3_etkk25,1579981788.0,I bet he’d appreciate you cleaning the shit off it prior to feeding.

Overwatch,ffdr6mr,t1_ffdncd3,1579826937.0,"So if queues are 8 mins+ I should wait 16 minutes in hopes I don’t backfill again? For 400xp? I don’t want xp I want to play the game. 

Not worth it. Can’t be hard to pull from a pool of players that have only been in queue for 1-60seconds. Instead of letting me ride it out to almost the 10 minute mark."
Overwatch,ffd214n,t1_ffczufu,1579811860.0,You’re joking?

Overwatch,ffchqmj,t1_ffcfmsn,1579799718.0,"Tank main here! There’s a reason I only play dps on rare occasions,  cause half the time I end up backfilling a 99% lost match."

unpopularopinion,ff3ri2o,t3_er9ffh,1579547282.0,How is this remotely unpopular? Maybe popular with the women who can’t figure out who the real father is and couldn’t support a child to begin with.

AwesomeCarMods,fem8i9n,t3_ephr33,1579243624.0,"Really nice idea. Nice conversion it looks like.

Panel gaps are more than heinous on a white car though. So it’s gonna be a no from me."

But here I am, just coming back inside from hitting a bowl. Going on 5 years of daily smoking with less than a month sober total sprinkled in there. 

At least I don’t smoke as much as I used to.

See, there I go again."
Whatcouldgowrong,feixf7c,t3_ep47t7,1579149873.0,"yep got bit in the face by a rescued German Shepard as a young kid, I was just not leaving our newly adopted dog alone for any amount of time. I bugged the shit outta him until he had enough, no scars for me now, only a good scratch on the forehead at the time. Pretty sure the dog knew I was a fragile kid and just gave me a warning bite. Ended up rehoming him after that, but he was still a good boi."

Golf_R,fe0cvd1,t3_enjm2f,1578810167.0,"I’d see if somehow someway they’d allow you to source a south bend clutch and install that for you. They probably wouldn’t, but worth a shot.. But the clutch’s in both the R and the GTI are notorious for going out early. Dsg gang baby."
