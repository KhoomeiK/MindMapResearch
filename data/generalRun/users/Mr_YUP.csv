OurPresident,ffx4q61,t1_ffwzv22,1580317709.0,That'd be awful to be taxed on gross income. Having half the revenue taken away in tax before you can even pay for an employee or a debt is a nightmare no one wants to see.

todayilearned,ffmebpy,t3_eu5wt2,1580053276.0,They’re bad when no one has space to themselves. Just having long tables to sit at isn’t how open offices should be.
lrcast,ffm0kln,t3_eu1pm2,1580046684.0,I got to play only one mystery booster draft cause they had no tables open from like 10 am onward. I was able to get a lot of trading and it was fun to socialize but I was looking forward to playing more than one draft. That was also after standing in line for two hours waiting for a spot to open up.

MagicArena,fff415y,t1_fff37gt,1579875126.0,Black white life gain is surprisingly easy to get rolling if you don't deal with the pieces soon enough. I'm sure at the top tier it's got some weakness but at least up to Gold it'll just steamroll someone who doesn't know how to deal with it.

interestingasfuck,fen9o7x,t1_fen8hv9,1579279998.0,Reminds me of the first few weeks of Pokemon Go. You could see groups of people walking around and you knew exactly what they were doing. Find random groups and just start hanging out to catch pokemon together. A moment I am not sure could ever be recreated.

WTF,feld3uo,t1_felb6sg,1579219356.0,Yea that ones not clear. Maybe it was to set them apart from the rest of the humans in the world? Could be a bacteria when you’re older thing? Idk. That one is weird.
WTF,fel6lzl,t1_fel5rw6,1579215172.0,After a woman has her period she has to go through a ritualistic cleaning ceremony before she can have intimate relations again. Until she goes through that than she is unclean. If a man does than he is unclean and needs to go through a cleaning ritual and can't go to certain temple or do most social things.
WTF,fel1tse,t1_fekzwtm,1579212225.0,Religion also keeps the rulers in check so unless you like being ruled by a tyrant you should reevaluate the place of religion in human society.

WTF,fekvdmx,t1_feku365,1579208381.0,Yea if you look at a lot of the food and clean laws in Judaism they’re some decent sanitation practices. Shellfish needs to be cooked all the way so it’d be better to avoid it. Pork has parasites and needs to be cooked all the way. Touching dead bodies can be super harmful if you don’t wash yourself. There’s some weird stuff too like not even so much as glancing it seems a woman while on her period but humans are creatures of extremes.
gaming,fekkzud,t1_fekashr,1579202233.0,What’s the big deal with day 1 patches? They have a deadline to ship for physical printing and distribution but that doesn't mean they can’t still work on the game.
AskReddit,fejrms2,t1_fejfeqd,1579184128.0,I mean waving two sticks together while muttering and cursing followed by something appearing that did not exist before is textbook wizardry.

worldnews,fehx2wd,t1_fehu919,1579125583.0,That's a software thing and having a charger that is tuned to that specific hardware's capabilities is not a problem. Nearly all wireless charging is done with the [Qi Wireless](http://www.qiwireless.com/) standard and that standard seems to be sticking around for a good while. As long as you can still charge it I see no issue with a company wanting to sell a charge that's tuned for their platform.
worldnews,fehrof9,t3_ep6bpo,1579122530.0,Wireless charging for all phones is about to become a thing in a year or two. Give it time and don't pass any legislation and this will be resolved soon.
videos,fehkdry,t1_fehj2mw,1579118326.0,They did the same to Ross. He used to be a guy who was down on his luck with some more happening to pile on. By the end he’s just a punching bag for every terrible thing to happen to.
wallstreetbets,fehg4io,t1_fehd5m0,1579115836.0,They’re both good for different reason. The book has tons of good info they couldn’t get across in the movie and the movie shows you the reality of who they were giving houses away to

magicTCG,fegvvjd,t1_fegqeso,1579103700.0,Is this really how it works? Can you really flicker another player's creature and retain control of it like that given the wording?
todayilearned,fego6fh,t1_fegjocj,1579098520.0,Reading that book in elementary school really gave me an odd perspective. Didn't really understand all the ethical implications back then but it stuck with me through to adulthood.

blender,fdzaezr,t1_fdwsd54,1578788226.0,That could be a really great video. The banana explains why it went for $120K. The thought behind it and some history on the artist who made it. Then have it get eaten but then finish the video in the stomach of the guy who ate it and ask “isn’t this art as well?” Or something like that.
MagicArena,fdysqyh,t1_fdy7ulj,1578783211.0,The more I’m drafting the more I’m lining the format. Everyone has the same cards and having one or two rare cards really make an impact

AskReddit,fdndt4s,t1_fdnbj1r,1578583665.0,"small websites don't really exist like they used to. A lot of content is focused on sites like facebook, reddit, youtube, tumblr, pinterest, etc and they offer things to you based on what you might keep you on the site and not what might be interesting. It'd be cool if it shifted back towards that now that brands are more likely to work with small creatives with specific audiences."

eagles,fdk6auk,t1_fdk4hcl,1578497055.0,"I can understand the thought behind people wanting players to play through it because it's not an obvious injury. They aren't limping or showing obvious macro signs of injury. They can still walk and throw can't they? Most people haven't had a real serious concussion on the same level an NFL player might and do not know the reality of how bad it can be. 

We do need to take them serious but it's going to take a while for the general talk about them to calm down."
science,fdjunux,t1_fdjpqxo,1578488078.0,It’s also good to know where they are and what they’re called. Most of them have directions on them. “5 minutes away on your left” or “close to downtown just off Exit 1” is super useful
