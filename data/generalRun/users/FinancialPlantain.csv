While there are some who earnestly believe this, and in those cases it's often a stubborn belief in ""traditional"" factors that just can't be trusted anymore, a large part of it is that Biden is by far the corporate choice. Some want to dismiss any accusations of media bias as conspiracy theory but there are legitimate concerns with large corporate media groups wanting the candidate who best represents their interests in.

Then the people that watch CNN etc. mostly just believe it because they were told to by the media outlets they think are free from bias just because they're not Fox News or Breitbart. Those right wing counterparts are often much more aggressive and shameless with their manipulation, but by no means does that mean a 'liberal"" outlet (or any other outlet for that matter) isnt biased just because it meets the low low standards of thinking brown people are human and that children shouldn't be locked in concentration camps."
