sanders, on the other hand, praised venezuela for specific actions their government took on controlling and regulating the economy."
politics,fgtk6r1,t1_fgtdvt1,1581105568.0,"Bernie Sanders literally praised the Venezuelan government less than 10 years ago.

Call it whatever name you want, Venezuela is an example of exactly what Bernie wants for the US."

politics,fgmkrqs,t1_fgmfwpl,1580926576.0,"Thanks for your completely biased article that backs up literally nothing you said in your comment. Not only that, the article claims tax cuts will benefit the middle class.

How about your claim that the 95% of people in the US don’t own property? Or that wages haven’t moved at all since trump took office?

You are incredibly ignorant, and should take a bit more time actually read that articles and educate yourself on what you are commenting on"

While I am 100% in favor of legalizing marijuana both medical and recreational, the amount of fraudulent prescriptions for medical marijuana would make this proposal a very bad idea. I don’t think taxpayers should be paying for someones “medical” marijuana because they have “anxiety” or “back pain”"
