dogs,ffoqu3m,t3_euepcn,1580080574.0,"Yeah I have a friend who swears by Rover but my first experience left a lot to be desired. I needed someone fairly last minute a couple months after adopting my new puppy and not only was she available, she had stellar reviews. Showed up for a meet and greet and her house is a mess. No worries, it’s just a place for my dog to stay, not for me, and she’s watching multiple dogs so I figured mine would have a blast. Well she did, but she was returned without her harness. The sitter asked me to send her my address on the app and she’d drop off the harness in my mailbox. Well I sent my address but never got my harness back, even after following up and offering to just swing by her place to pick it up. Thanks a lot. I’ll probably board my pups from now on."

Your bf’s lack of empathy and flexibility is concerning. He doesn’t sound very committed. My husband and I have never divided chores 50/50. We both just pitch in when we can. If one of us notices that something needs cleaning, we do it. Sometimes I cook and do dishes, sometimes he does, sometimes we do everything together. I would think if he really cared for you, he’d pick up the slack until you’re in a better place. My vote is couples counseling to get to the root of the problem. It can be very helpful. I’m sorry to hear about your situation but also impressed by your resolve to work through it. I hope things improve for you very soon.

I didn’t work for almost 2 years(he went back a couple months before I did). We ended up returning and starting over in a low COL area and live much more minimalist after realizing how little we really need. We saved up for a few more years and bought our first house which doubles as an investment property. It was a fixer upper but now that the work is mostly done we feel like we made out like bandits. We took a huge risk and definitely came out ahead, I’d say. Now if we ever need to leave, we can just rent out our unit.

Marriage,ff9eelu,t3_eseenv,1579711218.0,"I think it can be hard, and everyone hits rough patches, but if it’s hard all the time, that’s a problem. I’ll say that my husband 100% makes my life better, but I never thought I’d be married because I’m a pretty independent, introverted person. It was definitely an adjustment in the beginning to have to worry about someone else’s wants and needs, and to learn to communicate my own. I do think that a lot of people do suck at communication, and if you don’t make an effort to improve (many don’t), then yeah, a lot of resentment is going to build, and that’s hard. 

Also, caring for a mentally or physically ill partner is hard.

If you approach every issue or setback with a team oriented mindset, and both partners are equally committed to the success of a team, then things are going to be easier. People are just different and many of us didn’t have such great examples of healthy relationships (my own parents divorced when I was pretty young), so it can be hard to know how to handle differences in a positive, productive way."

I’d start my own business or find a freelance/wfh type gig.

The PM job I had involved back to back meetings pretty much all day every day. It also involved travel. I had a work laptop that I used to get work done whenever/wherever I could. The time always flew by and it was really flexible too. If I couldn’t be in the office, I could call into meetings. It was pretty sweet! I regret leaving even though I make more now.

I’ve worked in both the public and private sectors and I definitely prefer the former.

I’d say keep looking into jobs and think outside the box. Maybe you could start out in a corporate 9-5 M-F type gig and then start working from home a few days each week. Or get some experience under your belt and start freelancing, start your own agency/firm, etc. You could be a consultant, traveling the country helping small businesses build their brand. So many possibilities.
