Because then we end up with people like you who are stuck under a rock and have no idea how even remedial cognition functions.

If you studied the brain, you'd grow up real quick from being duped by the infamous Republican battlecry of pulling yourself up by the bootstraps. Per usual, science is a bit more accurate than political slogans. Depending on how old you are, that ought to go unsaid.

School is expensive so I don't expect you to get a formal education, but shit, you're literally on the internet right now--stop splaying your ignorance and go correct your naivete. There are free online courses, YouTube crash course series, wikipedia galore, etc.

You don't even need to take my word on it. If you were to actually study the brain, you'll quickly find out yourself how fundamentally your worldviews will flip over. You can't stop that if you actually dive in--most of the knowledge is both unintuitive and counterintuitive.

If that's still true, then statistically speaking, when you read a naive/ignorant comment on this website, it's more likely coming from a grown ass adult.

People forget that the correlation of age and intelligence is largely illusory. It's a nicer story to tell yourself that stupid comments must be written by kids, but the reality is that the world is full of naive and ignorant adults. I'm pretty sure it'd be accurate to suggest that there are more naive adults in the world than there are kids in the world.

Most newer TVs (~5 years) have this under some related name. Motion plus, motion max, stream plus, or whatever they choose to call it. IIRC it basically takes two consecutive frames and uses an algorithm to create a new frame between them, a transitional frame, to create a ""better"" flow.

It's great for, like, sports. Feels like you're actually there. Absolutely horrible for drama though, it feels like you're behind the cameraman just watching the actors on the set. Some people dislike watching drama on psychedelics due to this perception, but Motion Plus will manage this all on its own, no drugs needed. Absolutely ruins the magic of immersion for me. 

However I find that most people generally don't seem to notice it. God forbid some people actually like it. But it will single handedly ruin my entire experience from the root if it's on while I'm watching shows/movies.

And I find that when I switch it off for other people, if they even notice the difference, then many realize ""oh wow I didn't even realize something was wrong, but this feels better thanks."" They turn that shit on by default, so if you don't know about it, you'll likely be stuck with it.

I think The Hobbit movies utilized this effect with their higher framerate? Either way, again, it's somewhat subjective. Seems like a preference similar to people/directors preferring film over digital, because they use similar arguments of how the latter ruins the magic of immersion while the former enhances it. But I think the Motion Plus feature is a much more significant dealbreaker for way more people. I prefer film over digital, but I can still watch digital. I can't watch Motion Plus.

I think it got its nickname, the Soap Opera Effect, because a few/several years ago everybody buying new TVs were suddenly like ""why do all my shows and movies look like a fucking soap opera now??"""

HunterXHunter,ffiqgyg,t1_ffh5suv,1579980169.0,"I don't think you need special circumstances in order to find gratitude for the hiatuses.

For example, I'm thankful for the hiatuses simply because I presume HxH wouldn't be as good if Togashi wrote any faster than he does.

Hiatus = Togashi being careful about the next chapters. The longer a hiatus = the more careful and intricate the following chapters will be.

I don't understand the fans who want Togashi to write quicker than the pace he's comfortable with. I don't want a HxH that's more shallow than it otherwise could be. I literally only enjoy the story because of how intricate it is, and I won't hold my breath in finding another writer who would claim that they could write anything of this quality much, if any, quicker than Togashi does, if at least accounting for a bad back.

I mean, as long as HxH isn't the only thing you have in life, the hiatuses aren't even a big deal. You just live life and one day you'll randomly hear about a new chapter, and that turns into an awesome day. In the meantime, there's a million stories out there, and I love exploring what else is out there. I used to think Berserk was the only masterpiece, then I found HxH. One day I'll find a 3rd contender if I keep looking long enough. But if all I'm doing is just actively waiting on new HxH chapters and shitting on Togashi for it, what am I really doing? (That isn't directed at you, but at most others I see in this sub.)

Fans hate the hiatuses, but as soon as you simply become patient then I fail to see any issues. Togashi writes at the pace that works for him. It is what it is. I'm grateful for the hiatuses, as I'm grateful for the quality that results from such hiatuses. And I'm truly baffled that this isn't a more common perspective."
HunterXHunter,ffipa9x,t1_ffhe4s6,1579979336.0,"Well, nowadays many generic shonen are also dark and at least try to be gritty. These are definitely no longer special characteristics that stand out for shonen.

I don't think HxH would be a generic shonen without those elements, though. What makes it go against the grain in the first place is the subversive storytelling--it follows very niche formulas and goes in the opposite of most common tropes.

Also I'd argue every arc, barring YN, CA, and SW was a fun adventure. And Gon was always the relative main character, with Killua being more of a main character than any other candidate (Leorio, Kurapika).

Gon and Killua certainly aren't main characters anymore, now it's Kurapika. But that's only a small fraction of the entire story thus far.

Sure, there is almost certainly shillery involved in every major media website that exists, including most subreddits on Reddit. That's not actually the argument you thought you were responding to. But the amount of people who think that they're seeing an advertisement, when some random geek is simply just posting about his excitement for a release about to come out that they've been waiting months/years for, is absurd.

Statistically speaking, 99% of what you see on here is just that. Someone like you or me talking about something we're interested in. Look at the traffic this website gets and that becomes a statistical certainty. Shills **absolutely pale** in comparison to people like you or me who flood this website with our presence.

Advertisers don't even need to compete with our natural word of mouth. And when they do, they aren't close to the numbers people exaggerate. 50% of what you see? Is that really the hill you want to fight on just to argue that shilling exists here?

Here's some anecdotal perspective, to boot. The amount of times I've been called a shill over the years when submitting simple sentiments is explicit evidence that many people on this site are blind paranoids and would call a tree in their backyard a shill. One example is that I once made a post reminiscing a game hint website, and got called out as being the website designer or an advertiser. FFS it's **absurd** how many people overlook genuine typicality and cry at the sky instead. And that's one of a dozen examples I could find in my post history over absolutely benign shit.

So next time you make a submission and get called a shill, make sure to raise your eyebrow extra high at the prospect that perhaps you're also one of the many who exaggerate shilling in place of what's just an ordinary sentiment by a random Joe.

This is clearly deceptive because you never got tipped to create that pressure for others, you tipped yourself to create a suggestive illusion.

But while it's literally deception, in order to substantiate the claim of unethics you'd have to argue further for why such practice is significant enough to warrant a moral argument. And good luck to anyone who tries to hit the ball home there. Best I can reach for is that the pressure is to take more of someone's money and that the pressure is artificial rather than genuine.

Based on the standard replies to submissions like these, I think you're way too optimistic. Most people saying ""move out"" don't respond further by saying, ""even though that's obvious and I'm sure you're trying."" They say ""move out"" and drop their mic, thinking they just gave the ultimate advice.

>if mom is a psycho when you're 18 there's a good chance she was also a psycho when you were 16. So that gives you 2 years to hopefully make some friends, come up with a plan, get a part time job, save some money.

This logic assumes they're already trying to move out. Which they probably are and have been trying to for years. Which makes the advice to ""move out"" even more irrelevant.

>Now if your parents steal all your money and don't let you leave the house or have a cell phone, then yeah, you're probably fucked. But then again if your parents steal all your money and you have no friends you aren't going to be able to move out at 18 or 20 either so you might need a plan B

That ""Plan B"" is more relevant to most people, as most people can't just simply ""move out."" So wouldn't it be more helpful for comments to be ""here's what Plan B should look like,"" rather than ""move out dude lol""?

That's the contention in this thread. No matter how you slice it, every single comment you ever see saying ""move out"" is just comment litter.

""It felt like the mushrooms gave me telepathy with aliens..  mushrooms are therefore magical plants!"" As opposed to, ""wow this drug made me anthropomorphize my thoughts as an alien, giving an illusion of communication with another being. What a cool delusion.""

Of course, if you're predisposed to schizoid type disorders, then knowledge won't necessarily keep your head on straight, as psychedelic use can trigger laden disorders.

Neuroscience is booming out of its infancy and we already know quite a few ways our brains function while influenced by psychedelics. You have more neural associations, meaning you have more novel thoughts (neurons that would never fire together during sobriety may connect while tripping). You experience ego dissolution, which strips the border of the self away from conscious experience. You have temporary synesthesia, where you experience sensory crossover. You have sharper perception. Etc. Etc. Etc.

In fact it's good to try and understand how it works. Because if you don't know that your brain is reacting in a way influenced by a drug which changes your cognition, you can easily fall into traps of delusion. Delusions are easy to buy into if you don't know it's a delusion. I shake my head when I see people take psychedelics and think stuff like telepathy becomes real, because that delusion literally only stems from ignorance about brain function.

Plus as we keep studying the brain and psychedelics, eventually we will reach a point (barring human extinction) where we understand it completely.

E.g., she gets punched for spitting, and then feels more righteously for spitting in the future because she got ""wronged"" for it and still feels like she can get away with it in most cases, and needs the relief of that.

As people eat consequences for their actions, they often get more bitter and care *even less* for consequences in the future. They bet it all on targeting a doormat who will just pushover for their abuse, because that's a boost that they need.

There's a reason that retributive prison systems have a ~70+% reincarceration rate and rehabilitative prisons have closer to ~20%, if comparing the worst/most regressive systems (U.S.) to the most productive (Scandinavia). You don't need to be a statistician to realize how mindboggling that difference is. Most people only learn and change when they're shown compassion and find an ""out"" to their behavior, especially when offered by those who would be justified to be much more aggressive about it. And most people regress further when persecuted for their behavior--the worse the persecution/consequences, the more the regression.

So, chances are she will spit again. She got the most ineffective lesson you can imagine. She'd have had a better chance of reevaluating her behavior if the guy just started crying and said she was mean, because then that'd have opened potential for remorse. Getting decked feeds retributive urges.

Of course exceptions exist to all these. This is just in general. This is unfortunately what's typical, and like most psychology, it isn't intuitive. You would think that the harsher you are, then the more of a chance a lightbulb will flicker over their head.
