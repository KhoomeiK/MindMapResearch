While Jordan's plotting is his strength, at least before he bloated the story with far too many parallel threads, character development is key.  I don't see these scene breakdowns as being adequate.

Would Roddenberry's Trek ever have an interviewer, and thus News company, like the one in the episode?

Would Roddenberry even let things come to this point?  He really wouldn't.  He always had an out.  It just didn't feel consistent with Roddenberry and TNG much at all.  

Mike and Rich weren't going to accept much in the way of compromises.  But even I felt like it was just a mildly softened Kurtzman show.  They needed a different approach to this show imo.  

I would have rather see Picard, who retired without issues, come out of retirement to fight growing fascism in the Federation.  This take seemed out of left field and unnecessary.  The handwaving supernova emergency just makes it rather rushed and convenient for the writers."

television,ffpw0zd,t1_ffpurrq,1580107903.0,"you can't satisfy everyone.  In the end people don't want lazy writing that ignores what came before.  Star Wars fans seem to come together on the Mandalorian and to some extent Rogue 1.

Trek has been completely retconned after JJ arrived and even his fans bailed on the films.  And he moved on to other projects.

In the end, you need to put the right people in place.  Kathleen Kennedy and Kurtzman really aren't the right choices for either franchise.  Favreau seems to be a solid choice in terms of maintaining the feel of the OT Star Wars universe."
television,ffpvqwj,t1_ffpuma3,1580107577.0,yeah they were completely constrained on TNG.  You can only tell so many kinds of stories when you are shackled like that.
television,ffpug4l,t1_ffpucg3,1580106142.0,TNG is far too idealized and naive for me.  The reset button after each episode also takes away a lot of its impact.  I'll take great drama over non experts preaching to me on complex topics.
television,ffpud14,t1_ffpefel,1580106049.0,I've seen them rip apart the TNG films but not a detailed analysis of the show.  their love of the Orville shows how stuck they are in one iteration of the show.

YangForPresidentHQ,ffptlt2,t1_ffl9e3u,1580105230.0,"UBI is a VERY hard sell until it is as broadly understood and accepted as other major issues.  Right now a large number of people will see it as welfare for all.  It's a great cause to stand behind, but it is not ready for prime time.  

As far as small businesses suffering by HAVING to pay $15 an hour.  I'd rather see subsidies for the ""necessary"" ones and let the non-necessary unviable ones die off.  They'd also need to provide STRONG evidence backing their claims.

Wages have not remained stable and it's time for the minimum wage to be boosted.  We can argue on the proper amount, but I don't see myself being convinced that these wages should be so low.

You and several others have made solid points, and yes the unemployment rate is deceiving and understated.  

I think UBI is a VERY hard sell and is probably a decade away from being viable in a winning election.  It's really too bad that Yang was passed over in favor of Steyer and Klobuchar.

Is there a reason why Sanders and Warren have not gotten on the UBI bandwagon?  Have they discussed it?  

I'm already concerned that their progressive plans, in total, may be too much for the center.  But that may not matter if they are going against Trump who should have massive issues in national debates this time around.

EDIT:  it looks like warren and sanders have at least answered questions on it.  but I don't think they have concrete plans or see it as worth advertising.  I'll assume it's because it hasn't gained enough traction with voters.
