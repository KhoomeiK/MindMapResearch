NancyDrewCW,ffealyq,t3_eavorj,1579841370.0,"I think the scene of the restaurant is a red herring. We learned from E10 the poison was fine tuned to slowly kill, and it is the same that killed Tiffany. Tiffany died way too quickly after food being delivered. Assuming the killer is not a chemist and made their own, it is someone with the opportunity to (A) know about Claire's killing (B) and to get a vial.

If Drew Crew could learn how long it takes to metastasize, you work backwards from the time of death of Tiffany in the Claw's parking lot to her final hours in her final day. If you can positively place her timeline, you may find the people with the best opportunity to poison her earlier. You cross check those people for a trifecta with the connection to Claire/highschool, motive and opportunity.

That being said, it probably all comes back to someone connected to Lucy Sable's death due to the highschool backdrop."

If several worked on it, that means you only really had to do a little work each for a big pay day.
