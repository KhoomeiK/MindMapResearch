facepalm,fdqcijl,t1_fdgmkg2,1578662968.0,Thank you!! That's exactly what I've been saying. This post is a face-palm.
facepalm,fdgqxyh,t1_fdgqhn4,1578406016.0,"These are the most environmental sound synthetic fabrics that exist right now. You can be an assh*le and pretend that exhausting and breeding non-natural sheep is okay or you can accept that there are better ways to fulfil our needs without hurting the environment and the animals 'THAT BAD"". Losing an argument isn't bad, especially when you're defending corporations that make millions and millions torturing animals and destroying the environment."

So many environmentally sound and not resulting to animal cruelty, synthetic fibers exist. But no you need to be ironic and act like you know everything."
facepalm,fdglqtj,t3_el9n2r,1578401575.0,"What they actually meant is that big corporations breed them to have more wool on them than they naturally should, so we can shave even more and use it. ""Normal"" sheep, of course, don't die from hyperthermia.
The problem isn't that we shave them and use the wool, it's that we exceed nature's limits and we exhaust the animals to make things even more easier for us.
Believe me clothes can be made from synthetic materials and not wool. If we want we can be eco-friendly and fulfil all our needs :)"
