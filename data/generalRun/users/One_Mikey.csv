rccars,fdbncjh,t1_fd9sa64,1578259081.0,"You cannot really off-road with an RC rally car since they're so low to the ground. Hell, even coarse gravel can be too much for one, and grass (save a golf green) would be totally undoable.  
  
I suggest monster trucks as a good starting point, since they can go anywhere, are forgiving to drive, and tend to be durable. If you're new, it's never fun to go to the park and get stuck in grass, bottom out on jumps, or fail on other obstacles that are trivial for a monster truck. Believe me, they'll still be a ton of fun on-road too, and you can tune them with stock settings to be stiffer and lower. Beyond that, you can get aftermarket suspension and wheel setups, but if you really get the bug, you can get a dedicated on-road car, or find middle ground with a stadium truck."

The turbo variants, the WRX and GT are quite different. The WRX is what you know and love, while the GT is a more plush and grown-up."
