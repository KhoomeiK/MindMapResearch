If you're looking to get any actual NA power out of it, you'd be looking at forged rods & cam regrind, & polish the headers, a lot of money for not much return. It's a great engine, it's just not a fast one. If you really want more HP w/out a turbo setup (not recommend for the 5S anyway), your best bet is going to be a 1M/3MZFE swap."

Don't know if it's still there but there was a really good doc about him on Netflix, where they followed him on his campaign, and over time through his cancer, leading up to leaving the Senate & shortly before he died.

I've been there before, too, and my best advice where the Target exchange is concerned is to hold on to it & use it to help motivate yourself to taking the necessary steps towards getting healthy. It doesn't mean that the girl from Target is going to necessarily be there when you're ready, but take it as a sign that someone else WILL be when you're healthy again & the time is right. For now though, just focus on what's directly in front of you & putting one foot in front of the other.

AskReddit,fcjiyu2,t3_ehg5ac,1577689415.0,"Backing out of a parking spot in a strip mall parking lot once when I see this guy running towards my car, I stop so I don't hit him. Next thing I know he runs up to my door, opens it, grabs me & yells ""GET THE FUCK OUT OF THE CAR!"" I realize he's being chased by police & I'm being carjacked. I'm bucked in, so he couldn't pull me out. Now, I love my car, but instantly I'm flooded with terror, immediately followed by rage. Also I'm on my way to a wedding in which I'm part of the bridesmaids so I'm like shit I can't be late. So I yell ""NO"" at the guy, and he's in disbelief. He grabs me again to pull me out, yelling again to get the fuck out of the car and in my mind I'm just thinking DO NOT LET HIM IN THIS CAR WITH YOU. So I yelled no again & plant my foot squarely into his stomach and push him straight the fuck out of my car. Cops run up, he takes off running again. As they're running after him through the parking lot I'm thinking ""I can head him off,"" so I start the car (I'd dumped the clutch when I turned to kick him out of my car) and tear off after him, swerving in front of him & basically herding him into some bushes where one of the cops literally jumps & pounces on the guy. 

After that I just kept going, because I REALLY could not be late for that wedding. Contacted the police the following Monday (non emergency closed on weekends) & they were like ,""Yeah, we've been looking for you."" They sent out a detective, I gave my statement and that was that. He went to jail for the other shit they were chasing him for, he never got charged (as far as I know) for the attempted carjacking."

web_design,fciy44d,t1_fcfg55l,1577672603.0,"This isn't entirely accurate. If OP is using it for personal reasons, i.e. portfolio, and isn't directly selling things from the site, or claiming any of the work that isn't his/her own as otherwise (logo, etc) then it's fine. Safest way to do this would be to not publish the work where it's publicly accessible, and have it only for private use such as sharing in an interview.

That said, as a designer who conducts a shit-ton of interviews, I would strongly caution against redesigning a large-name brand identity in any way shape or form, mainly because unless the redesign is fucking gloriously spectacular, the odds of measuring up against the years of design experience & marketing strategy that went into the original creation are slim to none, and will only prove to highlight your own inexperience. I've had young designers show me their take on some aspect of rebranding of a major internationally known shoe brand, for example. So far, 100% of the time it's only proven to me their lack of understanding or appreciation of brand identity, and a level of unfounded egoism to think that 6 months out of school, they're good enough to go and redesign something of that magnitude. So I would tread carefully here."
