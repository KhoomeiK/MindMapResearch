overclocking,ffhh0jv,t1_ffgj63g,1579934862.0,Be careful with the acetone. It can melt your pcbs away is they aren't coated like the CPU pcb
hardware,ffhdfhy,t1_ffgxxih,1579930795.0,Just saying: look at the scale. It's logarithmic.
laptops,ffdbl2q,t1_ffdb70v,1579817374.0,You're welcome. I just don't want someone to have his table/data/Hands burned
laptops,ffdau3z,t1_ffdaovh,1579816873.0,If you do be careful putting the existing model to waste.
laptops,ffdajzn,t1_ffd42x7,1579816694.0,"The problem is that as soon as this expanding process starts it will release more and more gas. Using it will make that process faster. Can you make a picture as soon as you are home to let me check if my suspicion is correct?

It might be okay if it held that long, but I wouldn't trust it any more."
laptops,ffd3z2r,t1_ffcxsod,1579812963.0,It might catch fire if it gets punctuated.
laptops,ffcxlqq,t3_ess1ul,1579809380.0,Bro ich the portion under your trackpad is expanding you might have a faulty battery! Be careful!!
laptops,ffbtqvt,t1_ffayrxm,1579782430.0,That's it. Weird artefact on the screen almost always point to a faulty VRAM chip.
Amd,ffad1ts,t1_ff3i7iu,1579732678.0,This is frickin game changing
NoMansSkyTheGame,ff9emhs,t1_ff98g0j,1579711359.0,When I see smth I try...
NoMansSkyTheGame,ff7fyyp,t1_ff7ee62,1579648664.0,I would gladly donate like 2-3 € to make him able to play. Who's with me?
overclocking,ff5oxw7,t1_ff4z130,1579603955.0,Asking the real questions.
overclocking,ff5oxjn,t1_ff5nkyt,1579603941.0,What if he has? Lucky guy there then.
overclocking,ff2ijg4,t1_ff2iags,1579507671.0,Do you know where exactly the SYSIN temperature probe is? Should be detailed in the MB manual.
virtualreality,fegapcx,t3_ep0rco,1579085229.0,Yes it would. I am playing beat saber with a 1060/3GB. Just don't expect full 16x MSAA and such things.
laptops,fe2vaa8,t1_fe0v02n,1578843267.0,I certainly don't agree with that. Just join the Razer subreddit and look a bit around about the issues and unreliable support they have. Also QC is meh.
Archero,fe1va1s,t1_fe1v7z3,1578831232.0,"I am from Germany, it works here."
Archero,fe0wa98,t1_fe0v9ho,1578819455.0,Google Surveys is an app that gives you surveys and rewards you with Google play money.
Archero,fe0m6k1,t1_fdzyh6w,1578815926.0,If you are on Android I recommend Google Surveys. It's a nice little boost and still free.
overclocking,fdxoddi,t1_fdxlpfd,1578771225.0,"Thanks for the explanation. As I am new at RAM of (coming from a laptop) I wasn't really aware of the situation with the binning of chips. 

Do you think G.Skill bins the B Dies and uses the best for the higher margin products, or may I have luck at the silicon lottery and get better dies with other sets?"
overclocking,fdx1fut,t1_fdx0utm,1578764308.0,"So you say I shall lower one timing after another just by one (f.e. CAS 16 ->15) and see if its stable. If so, is it enough to run that for the Main Timings, or do i need to to that for all subtimings too?"
overclocking,fdx0par,t1_fdx0g0s,1578764156.0,Is there any method i could try to evaluate at what my RAM does run at the best? I really want to squeeze any bit of performance out of it.
overclocking,fdx05w5,t1_fdwzyh4,1578763983.0,"From what I've read online, B-Die is expected to run very well. The interesting thing is that when I type this numbers I do not get the ""memory overclock failed"" message, it just refuses to POST at all."
Archero,fds6sf3,t1_fdrlg9y,1578695638.0,"You could also see it the other way around :)
The Meowgik players want him/her to be better because they spent their gems on it. Either way, both are pretty good right? So IDC that much at all"
Archero,fds6p22,t3_emt04j,1578695578.0,"And I always thought the downvote button shows that you disagree. Well, I see the point: the problem isn't the downvoting but the reason for downvoting.


BTW, I am a Helix player and never thought about downvoting Meowgik players..."
laptops,fdq6ljk,t1_fdq6dmg,1578657104.0,This is solid advice. Also we might look at display and build quality for longevity and obvs better video quality
hardware,fdq1gxd,t1_fdpujzn,1578650170.0,"The problem won't be hardware but rather software and or engine limits, as those are sometimes much longer in use and not updated in that site for longer than hardware."
Archero,fdmsypy,t1_fdkq8a0,1578564258.0,"I tried, didn't help. But thanks for the suggestion."

aww,fdlggm4,t3_elve36,1578523494.0,The dog really looks like he is in fear of the cat. Poor doggo what has she done to him?
Archero,fdkql5d,t1_fdkq8a0,1578509094.0,I will try asap
Huawei,fdjk80i,t1_fdjjrpo,1578474740.0,Bad Bot!
Huawei,fdji9bo,t1_fdji3wz,1578472026.0,"Well, I checked all apps, an AppAssistant is not installed on my Mate 20 Pro. I tried installing it via APK from APKmirror, but my system informs me that the app is not compatible with the system and the app crashes when I try to activate the game acceleration."
Huawei,fdi3cjv,t1_fdi2923,1578434997.0,Could you explain this further? I dont have an app called AppAssistant
laptops,fdgw33z,t1_fdgvy9a,1578409768.0,Laptops Draw Air from the bottom. Now try to breathe through your bedcover.
laptops,fdgdsxk,t3_ekzn88,1578392017.0,I will never understand how anyone could think it's a good idea to suffocate the laptop airflow by placing it on a bed.
laptops,fdg9ine,t1_fdeydjg,1578385854.0,Why in Earth would you do that? This calls for a mistake
laptops,fdexa9x,t1_fdd1i5f,1578348547.0,Wait a second... How did you short smth with battery and charging connector unplugged? The caps should discharge fast tho
laptops,fdex4mf,t1_fddbzu7,1578348449.0,Just say something about a Thunderstorm
laptops,fd2omjz,t1_fd2o8q0,1578150176.0,"Not all. My Aeros thunderbolt port is attached to a Displayport of the GPU which it needs to make the displays work. Also USB C is just the connector, thunderbolt is the protocol which is used for the connector. I assume you mean that you can use ""just"" the USB 3.1 specifications of the port which would work for standard USB devices but a Thunderbolt port also needs to have some hardware specifications, f.e. better power delivery and that stuff."
laptops,fd2ggox,t3_ejwxey,1578146866.0,"That's one use case. I use it with a Thunderbolt dock, to ""dock"" it when I am at home, basically connecting two 4k Monitors, keyboard mouse and Ethernet with one cable. It removes the hassle to use like 20 cables for that. It also can be used to expand the variety of ports that you have available."
oculus,fcwu14u,t1_fcwioth,1578037592.0,Then your problem has its source somewhere else. The error is very unspecific and can be caused by a variety of different things.
laptops,fcvuwfs,t3_ej58qg,1578010649.0,"Please consider reading the guidelines how to properly ask for help, there is some crucial information missing.

gigabyte,fcvun8y,t1_fcuurzx,1578010484.0,"Uhm yea, depending on the time zone you live in I might be willing to help. As I said I am from Germany and I have opened up several laptops and smartphones"
gigabyte,fcugv3c,t1_fcudfw8,1577980647.0,If it's dead you can't lose smth. And there are enough YouTube videos of a teardown for sure. First you need to figure out what is damaged
gigabyte,fcua1ng,t1_fcu9ry4,1577976112.0,Why not do it yourself as a little project?
gigabyte,fcu9k5o,t1_fcu9bjx,1577975767.0,Was this also the 15X v8 model? I found some blown capacitors when I went to add some ram. That was one of the RMA cases. Gigabyte replaced the Mainboard without hassle. The first time the Transcend ssd I got it with died suddenly after like half a year. I 9jlx buy Samsung ssds since then.
gigabyte,fcu7hun,t1_fcu7ftu,1577974386.0,Well and I always thought I handle it with care
gigabyte,fcu7bq6,t1_fcu6nvz,1577974280.0,Good to know. This is my third RMA call for that laptop and 2 yr warranty is really necessary

gigabyte,fcu4v5k,t1_fcu4nfu,1577972599.0,"Interestingly, my Aero 15Xv8 has a 2 yr sticker on the bottom. Is it already considered old?"
gigabyte,fctvn9q,t1_fctvijr,1577961871.0,"Well I thought I had 2yr of warranty on laptop and ac. The manual is not in reach atm (am at gfs location). The support said I only have 1yr on the AC adapter, so I checked online^^"
dbrand,fcmweex,t1_fcmmq3t,1577795319.0,I also have an in screen fingerprint sensor. It works quite well even without the weight
dbrand,fcmlnt9,t1_fcmlgy1,1577780501.0,"I found that with Whitestone the ""aid"" is making it more complex. There are some tricks and when I used the Whitestone for my Note 8 I only used the aid once, after that without aid was a better application. Also Whitestone and SGfreshidea use different types of UV glue, which leads to different properties, so my first application after the change failed gloriously.

I once let a guy at a phone center do that type of application. He wasn't trained, and filled my ear speaker with UV glue, and hardened it...."
dbrand,fcmk6n8,t1_fclssio,1577778632.0,Well after like 3 applications my fialure rate with the invisshield is very low.
dbrand,fclgqap,t3_ehthhb,1577747396.0,You can use the invisshield true fit from sgfreshidea or the Whitestone dome glass. Only be careful with the application.
laptops,fclfa8i,t1_fclf1ue,1577746450.0,"If you multitask a lot. That means multiple windows of your IDE, like 50 chrome tabs and such stuff. Also, it helps with the windows prefetcher and program starts. (My windows for example uses ~16GB of RAM just to prefetch data to the ram)"
laptops,fcleu47,t1_fclebxg,1577746156.0,"You should be able to put 32gb in there, although 16 are totally fine"
laptops,fcle82u,t1_fcle1xn,1577745757.0,That's definitely cheaper. If that Toshiba is still enough for your needs there's nothing else that makes more sense.
laptops,fclca92,t1_fcla9jb,1577744502.0,"Define upgradeable. I would suggest smth with a decent CPU (i7-8750H and up) with enough ram. As you don't plan to game you should be fine with the iGPU, BUT if you want to connect multiple other displays, a dGPU like an MX150 or a 1050 will not hurt. So smth like a X1 Carbon?"
laptops,fcl9nj5,t1_fcl9d2q,1577742824.0,"Nothing. It's DDR2 and a HDD. You might get a somewhat decent surfing machine with a SSD in it, but it does not seem worth it."
laptops,fcl9bmv,t1_fcl99h8,1577742616.0,Out of interest. What laptop has this been?
laptops,fcl989f,t3_ehsh70,1577742557.0,"Uhm, you shouldn't be able to remove the CPU...? Isn't it soldered?"

laptops,fckd8wf,t1_fckd6h0,1577722725.0,Just take a look at the Razer subreddit. There should be enough examples.

laptops,fck4fan,t3_ehmiiv,1577716279.0,"That is backlight bleed. It always looks worse on pictures. Go play some games in different lighting conditions, watch some stuff on Netflix. When it is disturbing to you you might be able to get a refund. Every thing bezzle IPS has some sort of backlight bleed. Some are better than others."
woof_irl,fcjvrzg,t3_ehk08d,1577707138.0,That is... Smart af
laptops,fcf8ohi,t1_fcf0uws,1577627590.0,"Yes probably, but the GPU will render information faster and fetch them faster. If you play competetively that might make an edge"
laptops,fce9uid,t1_fce72ly,1577618405.0,"You can either look in the Task Manager, where two GPUs should be listed. Start the Task Manager and the Game, play a bit, tab out of the game and look which GPU has load on it."

laptops,fcdiv3f,t1_fc9gz49,1577610426.0,If you undervolt it would be even lower.
laptops,fcdil5m,t1_fcbcf85,1577610334.0,"This.
Just use ThrottleStop to adjust the Power Levels for your CPU. This will automatically lower the clock but not disable the turbo boost. Lower the power to the level you need not below."
laptops,fcdhjyy,t1_fccj0ua,1577610084.0,I would use HWinfo for monitoring as it is the most precise with the best device detection. Also for undervolting ThrottleStop is better than Intel XTU despite being a bit more complicated. AIDA64 is more of a test suite than a Monitoring Programm.
laptops,fcdgcdd,t1_fcari4x,1577609792.0,"Actually you can benefit from higher framerates, because you can get a newer picture with more recent information. That's especially true for a multiple of your refresh rate, f.e. 120 FPS and 180 FPS.

Edit: Typo"
laptops,fc344z5,t3_efu6jl,1577380989.0,Use the external display to get the most fps. The internal monitor is wired to the iGPU and this creates an overhead and reduces Max fps.
