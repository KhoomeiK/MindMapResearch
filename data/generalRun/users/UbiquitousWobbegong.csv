Yeah, some kids are weird. They'd probably be a lot less weird if everyone involved them and their social skills developed as a result.

I realize that kids are stupid, and don't understand this concept.

When I was a wee youngin, and we'd just gotten our first ever internet connection, I was also really into Digimon. Not knowing what search engines were, and curious to see what I could find online, I just put ""Digimonpictures.com"" into the address bar and hit enter.

Now, I know what you are all thinking. No, I didn't get sent to a digimon hentai site.

Instead, it redirected me to a porn site for an actress whose stage name was Brittney something. I think the site was ""sexwithbrittney.com"" or something along those lines.

How my innocent request for digimon pictures made the internet decide I was ready to become a man that day, I have no idea. It even sounds like a fake excuse a kid would give a parent when they were caught browsing porn.

AskReddit,ff2zvl1,t3_er9gj0,1579529862.0,"They're both problems. The top comment at the moment says that they're divided by whether they're an ecological or economic problem, but I think both issues cause problems in each of those areas. Particularly in the case of population growth. 

A lot of people seem to think that jobs are created on a 1:1 ratio based on the amount of people you have. For example, most left leaning individuals who agree with letting in anyone who wants to come into a western country think that the new local market demand created by immigrating those people offsets the increased labor supply they bring with them. This is not the case.

They aren't necessarily ""stealin' our jerbs!"" or whatever condescending handwave many leftists like to use to ignore the issue, but they do have a noticeable effect on the economic and social situation of the places they immigrate to. For example, let's start with unskilled immigrants. They'll create some jobs due to market demand, but they'll also fill a lot of those positions. This is because most of the jobs created by low income population are infrastructure and cheap services, which are jobs typically worked by the low income population. So what happens if there is a surplus of low income workers? Supply and demand. It suppresses wages because there's no need for these companies to incentivize the jobs. The people will compete for those jobs even if they pay terribly and have a horrible work environment. People who are in the low income population need the work, they can't just wait until they find something worthwhile. This just benefits the wealthy who are already in a position to take advantage of reduced labor costs. It reduces the quality of life of the working class, and doesn't that kind of counteract the beneficence of pulling immigrants out of the third world in the first place?

Okay, so what about medium to high income immigrants? They're bringing along a quality service, so they're definitely worth immigrating, right? Well yeah, except for two problems. Firstly, what happens if companies can't just pull in someone trained from another country? Well, then they have to groom the existing population into the role. That means scholarships, increase benefits, and inflated wages to draw workers into the career. In other words, increased quality of life for native citizens.

The other issue with immigrating skilled workers has to do with what their place of origin is losing. Most higher education is subsidized by the government's of their locations, as well as the local companies who would hire graduates. In essence, these communities are paying to train doctors, nurses, etc, and then we effectively take those resources from them by giving the worker that they've invested in a better offer. It's great for the worker, but it contributes to a quality of life drain for the place they are from. How would you feel if you invested your money in something, say a high interest savings account, and the bank just decided to take chunks out of it without paying you interest? Do you think that's fair?

Granted, this is overpopulation on a local level that I'm talking about. On a global level, these issues scale. Technology increases production without increasing labor demand. As time goes on, labor demands are just going to continue to drop for this reason. If we also take reproduction into account, there's a compound reduction on the value of an individual's work output. 

Unless we find a way to redistribute resources in a way that doesn't make the wealthy flee, the only way we can maintain some semblance of economic equality is to keep population growth at manageable levels, and make it as easy as possible for workers to train into the fields where current labor demand is. To the first point, redistributing wealth is a dangerous road to tred. It's the path to authoritarianism, and empowering your government to persecute the wealthy will inevitably lead to systems that persecute the poor as well. So I think it's in our best interest to instead reformat the education system, particularly the higher education system, to efficiently find and fill labor demands, instead of the current system where you study whatever you want and too bad if you can't find a job afterwards.

If the current market demand in medicine is high, post secondary schools should be training healthcare workers, not artists or gender theory. If those kinds of courses are available elsewhere, fine. But starting careers should be the goal of secondary education, not siphoning money out of the parents and loans of idiot children who think it's a good idea to get an English major.

That's the best way I can see to keeping our population stable and prosperous. The ecological footprint of overpopulation is obvious, but the economic damage that can be done is just as scary, and less talked about."

AmItheAsshole,ff2bt8z,t3_er4rxt,1579499992.0,"Not enough info for me to say for sure, but I'll throw in an opinion anyway. 

Firstly, I think the whole ""after 18 I don't owe my kid anything"" attitude is... not healthy, to put it as kindly as possible. If you choose to bring someone into this world, it's your job to raise them to be a successful adult. You don't just get to give up because it's annoying and they're doing the typical teen rebellion thing. You especially owe it to them if you divorce your partner during their formative years, as this is a well known predictor for developmental issues.

Secondly, kids are going to have sex, and they're going to do it wherever they think they can get away with it. That's pretty typical behavior for any teenager who can attract someone of the opposite sex. It's understandable that you'd be mad about it, but it's also naive to think it wasn't going to happen in the first place. Especially since it sounds like she may not have been successfully instilled with the kinds of values you're wanting her to embody.

Raising kids is hard, but they don't choose to be born. You signed up to be a parent by deciding to have her and not give her up for adoption. To me, that means you need to be there to parent her come hell or high water. It's not our job as a society to put up with a poorly raised adult just because you didn't want to put in the effort anymore.

All of that said, I do think there is a line. But it doesn't sound like your daughter has crossed it. She sounds lost and directionless, and kids usually get that way because of a lack of parenting, or bad parenting. Unfortunately, it may be too late to fix this now, because passing into the age of majority without having been parented effectively means that she's got the power and inclination to ignore further parenting. But if you don't try, she's going to be someone else's mess to clean up, and none of us deserve to clean up the mess you made.

AmItheAsshole,ff23njk,t1_ff0tg1o,1579492915.0,"I'm a 400 lb guy myself, and while I think ops cousin was being a bitch, I don't think it's ever as simple as saying ""well lose weight then"".

To get to 400 lbs, you have to have a pretty fucked up relationship with food. There are a lot of factors involved as to why it's difficult for people with severe eating disorders to lose weight. Suffice it to say that ~85% of people who successfully lose weight just put it back on, and the people who successfully lose weight are a vast minority of overweight people to begin with.

I've been trying to lose weight for a decade now, and I have the intelligence and education to make all the right decisions, objectively speaking. But people with eating disorders have trouble thinking objectively when it comes to food, and it's a constant battle that most of us continue to lose.

I would love nothing more than to just lose weight. But exercise has a high probability of sparking inflammation injuries that make my life absolutely miserable for weeks on end, and my brain is trained to find binge eating more enjoyable than neurotypical people enjoy sex. Plus I'm in school right now, and am stuck in a house of unhealthy eaters until at least later this summer. It's like being an alcoholic in a liquor store.

If you read this far, thanks for listening. To summarize, losing weight is pretty damn hard even for those of us who have all of the tools to succeed. Most of us don't have those tools. I can't blame the cousin for being morbidly obese. I can blame her for being a bitch about it."

unpopularopinion,feu0ct1,t3_eqh2c2,1579381859.0,"As a former therapist, I'd like to point out that pathologizing teenage mood issues can be just as dangerous as leaving them untreated. Much of our reality is based on our beliefs. If you corroborate these kids' self diagnosis with an actual diagnosis, kids who may have grown out of their otherwise normal mood issues may instead solidify that perspective as true. 

As awareness of mental illness has risen, so too has the amount of normal people who suffer from symptoms of a mental illness just because they have convinced themselves they have it. Stress can create almost any symptom of mental illness, and the belief that you are mentally ill causes stress, which is enough to put some people into a downward spiral that maintains their symptoms.

All of that said, that doesn't mean there isn't a better way to help these teens. They need guidance that could take the form of objective-based therapy, instead of working out a diagnosis. Plenty of therapy is just about figuring out the friction points that are most upsetting someone's mental wellbeing, and coming up with strategies to fix them. We can do this without causing the damage that stigmatizing a young person with a diagnosis of generalized anxiety disorder, as an example, might cause.

All in all, I agree with you that teenagers can feel very strong emotions that are comparable to those of adults. The reasons may appear to be more silly on the surface, but that doesn't mean they don't psychically suffer just as much. But I also don't think we should have the knee jerk reaction of taking their self diagnoses overly seriously either. There's a healthy middle ground we can aim for."

However, over the past five or six years, I've really changed my mind on religion. I now realize that religion is a binding force, a force that keeps a society cohesive. By nature of the way religions create order among us, they also can be used by a radical minority to justify evil acts. But they also coral people who otherwise would have sought community and purpose in divisive political ideologies, as we now see with the unerring belief people have in Feminism, Climate Alarmism, Antivax and Flat Earth. 

A shared religion taught us all similar value systems, and made it easy to see everyone as a friendly neighbor. A lack of a shared religion has made us more politically divided than we've been in recent memory, and less charitable to those we disagree with. 

I now have a great respect for what religion used to provide our society, and what we've lost with the push for acceptance of atheism and a multi-theistic population. Most of us didn't realize the value that religion actually had on the framework for our social and political interactions. Most of us still don't."
Showerthoughts,fe0kzu4,t1_fdzfbg9,1578815294.0,"Unfortunately, the reason the minimum wage hasn't kept pace with the living wage is that a living wage is now too high when compared with the abstract value of minimum wage employees' labor. This has more to do with the abundance of low skilled laborers, and relative lack of demand for low skilled labor, than anything else.

If we take it as true that there is enough money to go around, and that all we would have to do is get the top 5-10% to pay more (I'm not certain this is true, but for the sake of argument let's say it is), the problem still exists that the relative value of minimum wage workers' labor is worthless compared to people who actually earn a living wage. Mechanization is slowly taking over those jobs. I think it's likely that the only reason mechanization isn't happening faster is that it's more convenient to pay the current minimum wages than invest in development to speed the robots along.

If we demand higher minimum wages through legislation, you aren't going to see a sensible reduction in earnings that gets higher as you go up the totem pole to trickle to the bottom. You're just going to see companies cut hours and benefits as close to the bottom as possible, and the people who are left will have to pick up the slack or get fired. The abstract value of those at the top is too high for businesses to lose those people to wage cuts, even if those people could take a wage cut and still be living comfortably. You're not going to get most of those people to see it that way, and they'll simply find a job elsewhere, even if they have to leave the city or State.

There's a serious issue with how inequitable the situation has become between the lower and upper class, but inflating the minimum wage isn't a magic cure-all. The situation is too complicated for that to work. Frankly, the solutions that *do* have a chance of working are complicated, and not always comfortable. Trump's trade war and reduction of immigration both bolster the value of low skilled labor. He's simultaneously inflating demand for local production, and reducing the supply of low skilled workers. That means big earnings for people who man the factories, and infusions of wealth among the poor pool at the bottom. Those people go on to buy more products, and hire more service workers. Maybe they start their own businesses because it becomes economically viable, and hire their own workers for reasonable wages.

But if all we do is raise minimum wage, the cost of living will simply rise with it, and companies will absorb the cost at the bottom without ever touching the wealthy. It's not the answer."

But if the core gameplay loop gently nudges me down a path where I accumulate the knowledge you want to impart, I'll probably enjoy it.

They end up in an echo chamber, if they weren't in one already, and as their view spiral out into their most radical form, the rest of the world seems to grow only more depraved as even moderates on their side of the aisle consider them to be insane.

If it weren't for the institutional support these groups gather during their populist rise, they wouldn't become such a threat. But that institutional support stays, first because of reasonable arguments, then out of a belief that the opinions espoused by that group still belong to the majority, and finally out of fear of stoking the ire of the outrage mob.

With Dave Chappelle and Ricky Gervais speaking against the radical left without fear, I think that last stage is finally breaking, and the pendulum is going to start swinging the other way again.

Showerthoughts,fdpknr6,t1_fdomaqo,1578631261.0,"What? Very little evidence? If money in advertising didn't lead to a greater than proportional return, no one would advertise. The point of advertising is to increase brand recognition, not necessarily spur impulse buys as soon as the ad is seen.

For example, you may run a furnace company. You set up an ad campaign. Most people aren't going to see your ad and immediately buy a furnace from you. But, when they *are* in the market for a furnace, they might remember that catchy jingle or flashy ad they saw with your business name on it. Or maybe you come up as a sponsored ad when they Google local furnace installers.

Advertising is about being in the public consciousness. If no one knows you exist, you make no money. If people think of you when in need of your services, then your advertising worked. 

And if advertising didn't lead to awareness and sales, no company would ever be able to make money except those already in the public consciousness, which is obviously not the case. The question with advertising is not whether it works, but what version of it is most effective. And the answer to that question is a set of moving goal posts that cannot effectively be answered, which is why so much of advertising seems worthless.

People use it as a shorthand to see if a game is still pleasing its audience or not.

You rightly hit the other concern on the head. Higher player population in multiplayer games is almost always a benefit. Even beyond the figure you gave.

Look at games like WOW or destiny 2. You technically only need your 20 or so people to play regularly and you can do all PvE content in WoW. But that isn't the reality of multiplayer games. You're going to have goals that differ from your regular group of players. Maybe they won't be able to be on at the same times as you all the time. Or maybe you lose people because of irreconcilable schedule problems or social differences. The more players in the games population, the easier you can adapt your social net to your changing needs.

It's true that this sees diminishing returns as the population count rises, but you'll undoubtedly have an easier time finding a guild with times of play and interests that match you with a higher player count versus a lower one.

morbidquestions,fd6xte9,t3_ejwbme,1578197052.0,"I don't have a solid answer on the statistical element of your question, but I will say that rape is largely about power and control. You can see that in at least a few of your examples of rape scenarios.

At least, this is true when rape is intentional. No one really knows the prevalence of unintentional rape (miscommunication) because neither men nor women report it reliably, and figuring out whether or not a reported rape was unintentional is a complex undertaking. 

Another confounding factor to your question is the difficulty of statistically quantifying wartime rape. The places where wartime rape is occuring in the modern world tend to not have good systems for collecting this kind of information. Not only that, but many rape victims either choose not to report their rape, or don't survive to do so.

Because of all of these factors, figuring out the representative percentages of the different types of rapes is practically impossible. The more you localize your analysis, the easier it becomes, but the stats will still be muddy because of the above points. 

I don't even feel comfortable hazarding a guess. Something like 80-90% of rape cases are inconclusive due to lack of evidence. And those are the ones that actually get reported.

I think our time is much better spent making people feel comfortable saying ""no"", rather than trying to make everyone treat each other well.

Having unhealthy relationships is a part of life for most people. We learn and grow from our negative experiences. They're part of what forms us into adults who know when something is our fault, and when it's on the other person. When to stay and try to make things work, and when to move on.

Having to navigate these negative experiences makes us into more capable people, even if they're not pleasant to go through at the time. You're doing what you should do by reinforcing the confidence of your girlfriend. Trying to educate the youth dating scene is always going to be a fools errand. Learning to appreciate your partner is just another aspect of growing up that some people have to do, and it's not something we can just instill into people with a lecture."
assholedesign,fd0vxhz,t1_fcyv4ej,1578124483.0,"True, but if the point is for them not to notice, asking for a perception role is going to go against that.

I personally don't see the point of this trap on its own merits. It seems to be purely designed to harm the experience of the players. I don't think trap stacking like this is a very sportsmanlike way to DM, and doesn't seem to challenge the players in a way that would be fun for them."
nosleep,fd09gxp,t1_fcy95m0,1578115615.0,They obviously have money. Just build a soundproof room under the house for them and hire housesitters instead of babysitters. Disguise the entrance so they aren't accidentally found. Easy enough.
AmItheAsshole,fd07d7v,t3_ejkij2,1578114732.0,"NTA. They should have asked you beforehand. I don't see why that was so difficult for her to understand. 

I recently had a similar situation crop up, where my dog needed teeth removed after being under for something else. My vet called me personally and explained the situation, and asked if I wanted to proceed with the extractions. I gave her the go ahead, and it was no problem at all.

Our pets are important to us. Getting our consent is a big deal. The only time I'm okay with them not getting my consent is if there's no time, and it's an emergency. I don't care if it's routine, I want to have a say in the way my dog is treated."
unpopularopinion,fcwr4pg,t3_ej3bby,1578034314.0,"Another unpopular opinion: skin color is included with this. You can sometimes make some reasonable estimations of people based on skin color, along with the other attributes you mentioned.

This obviously comes with the disclaimer that skin color does not make a person who they are, or what they are capable of. But certain cultural values tend to flow through racial bloodlines. There's a reason why certain cultural traits are recognizable among certain demographics, such as the physicality of Hispanic people's social interactions. It's not an excuse to pre-judge an individual based on skin color, necessarily, but it's a trend you can see and factor into your interactions. 

For all the talk about diversity and inclusion in the west, part of my training as a healthcare worker involved proactively recognizing that people who look different from me may be more likely to have different customs and beliefs that I need to factor into my treatment plan. In as politically correct a way as possible, we were basically told to judge people based on their race, and prepare for cultural conflicts.

Now, this isn't to say that we treat all black people the same, or however you may be interpreting it. It's just to say that skin color or an accent are indicators of a potential culture difference, and we need to pay close attention to insure that, if that difference does actually exist, we can mitigate it.

I hope I've explained this to the extent that it sounds as least-racist as possible."
trashy,fcw5xvf,t3_eiyrq6,1578017908.0,"Don't make it so climbable then. You don't see anyone playing on the Korean Veteran's War Memorial of Windsor and Essex, Canada. That's because it's just one thin vertical slab of stone. It's not meant to be climbed on, so it's not *designed* to be climbed on.

In comparison, this memorial looks like a nice place to have a picnic. 

Build it to suit its purpose, and we wouldn't have this issue."
confessions,fcw3d81,t3_ej0sz4,1578016203.0,"Shit, I wish. I have undiagnosed gastrointestinal issue too. Doesn't stop me from binge eating and regretting it later. Cheers to your wife. I hope she figures them out *and* keeps the weight off."
GetMotivated,fcw34ps,t3_eiwdw4,1578016044.0,"Intelligence doesn't translate well into sociability or other ""skills"" that make you attractive. I'm very intelligent (statistically speaking), though I don't often feel like it. I'm consistently in the top spot in a demanding medical science program. 

However, I have a binge eating disorder that I have yet to conquer. So I'm morbidly obese, and not very physically attractive. I go to the gym, and take all the steps reasonable to maintain my hygiene, but it doesn't change the fact that I have issues controlling how much I eat.

Just as annoying, my intelligence makes me no better at caring about people. If anything, it makes me worse at it. I care in general about people, but unless I know I'm going to be spending a lot of time with you, I won't even make the effort to remember your name. That's largely because names don't come naturally to me, and remembering personal details requires actual effort on my part, but either way it isn't a trait of a particularly social person.

Lastly, confidence comes in many forms. I am confident in my abilities when it comes to my area of study. I am confident in myself, and my ambition and life plans. I am not the kind of confident where I can meet someone new and treat them like I've known them forever. I'm not the kind of person who is good at small talk. I like to discuss controversial political topics, or higher learning of some kind, or construction/engineering. While those topics can be fun for other people, they're not always great icebreakers. 

Even if I do manage to break the ice, I know that my life is too busy to foster many relationships right now, so I have trouble establishing a bond with people. Where others seem to effortlessly start hanging out with each other and incorporating each other into their lives after meeting, I feel like even asking a woman out as a friend might be overly forward. I know lots of women don't want to spend time with men if they're not interested in the man for dating, and I end up letting that perspective paint all my interactions with women, even though I know that, chances are, they'd be happy to make a friend.

It's the overthinking of the act that makes it difficult. Forming bonds is something most people do through impulsivity, not deep thought. If I were to not think, and just put myself out there, I'm sure I'd have a lot more success.

A balance of intelligence and heart is needed to make an attractive man. Intelligence can help you figure out the ""heart"" element a lot more than the other way around, but it won't make you a natural at it. The emotional side of life isn't as simple as it seems."

witcher,fcvmik2,t3_eiycyk,1578005293.0,"Yen has always come off to me as a whiny child who acts impulsively, knowing the consequences, then gets upset when said consequences apply to her. I've never really understood why people like her that much. 

She's impulsive, cynical, doesn't trust anyone, and treats Geralt like he's her pet. She's arrogant as all hell, and while powerful, isn't anywhere near as smart as she thinks she is.

She's like The Witcher's version of Daenerys. Born with a gift that makes her special, then uses it as an excuse to be an arrogant bitch to the entire world and demand rewards she never really earns. 

In the episode where she's talking to the baby on the beach, she talks about how women are just vessels, and people just use them up until there's nothing left. How the fuck does she think lowborn men (and women) in that world feel? She got one of the best lives you could possibly have in that world. Most lowborn men suffer to scrape by, providing for their family, and then are thrown around like pawns in wars by mad Kings and Queens, with no choice in the matter or power to speak of. Women don't get much better of a hand, but it's not like they're the only ones suffering, and Yennefer sure isn't suffering compared to the rest of the population. She is the 0.01%, complaining like she's being taken advantage of. Bitch please."
