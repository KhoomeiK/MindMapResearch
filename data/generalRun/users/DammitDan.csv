PropagandaPosters,fflsgri,t1_ffk21hf,1580043551.0,Maybe they all just tend to marry people with similar values and vote like them because of those similar values rather than by patriarchal force.

explainlikeimfive,ffhhjru,t3_etaecf,1579935529.0,"They are typically killed, too. That's one of the many reasons it's important not to overprescribe antibiotics. Some common bacteria are resistant to antibiotics, but are usually kept to limited numbers by the population of good bacteria. But if the good bacteria are killed off these antibiotic-resistant bad bacteria can take over. 

One of the most well-known of this type is C. Diff., which is a terrible illness and can be incredibly difficult to treat, like the name, Clostridium *Difficile*, seems to suggest. Very strong antibiotics are typically used to treat it, and if that doesn't work, highly specialized antibiotics are then used. 

The highly specialized aren't the fist line of defense because of the concern with C Diff potentially becoming resistant to those antibiotics as well, and also each pill costs over $1000 US, and is taken twice daily for 10 days. That's over $20,000 for one prescription.

Moral of the story: avoid antibiotics if you don't need them, but if you start a course of antibiotics, you sure as heck better finish it. That's how resistant strains start."
