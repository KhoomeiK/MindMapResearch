leagueoflegends,ff3u9ln,t3_ereg31,1579548984.0,"Finished plat 4 last season. Mostly irelia but had to learn a good blindable AP pick. 

Holy fuck now that I’ve put ~100 games into him, he’s definitely a sleeper. Aery this season is really good for poke in lane w him and can go phase rush in tricky lane matchups. Decent lane bully + great team fighter. 

I’m surprised more people don’t pick him, but I get why. CSing while poking/not fucking your wave takes time to learn, using your empowered passive auto to apply stacks takes time. Kinda hard to get kills in lane, easier to pick malphite or morde if you need AP. I guess I really value the blind pickable nature of him and how he counters a lot of common bruisers."

leagueoflegends,fd9fq3v,t3_ekckz4,1578232706.0,"Lmao this is just a complaint thread. Half of these aren’t even valid. 

1) there are pings that you just don’t know of, is VC better? No shit. But don’t act like there aren’t pings for pretty much every scenario. 

2) your dodging story sounds highly anecdotal. I’m in plat and have never had this issue of excessive dodges in a row during my climb. If you’re really silver 4, you probably find a game within a minute or two. 

3) if you have last pick you have a minute to pick your champ and select runes. I make a new rune page every game... don’t know of anyone that buys rune pages or has issues with a minute to select runes. 

4) valid complaint. Suggest googling the champions

5) if you are up 100 CS on your laner yet still “behind” your laner, there’s something wrong with the way you’re understanding the game. A few kills on your jungler does not make up for 100 CS

6) again anecdotal. MOBAs are toxic. Just had another DOTA guy post a thread last week saying how much nicer league players were than DOTA."

News flash:

This isn’t India’s most popular dish domestically or globally. Go to the streets of any Indian market or street vendor or even a quality restaurant within the Taj hotel in Bombay and ask them for the most popular Indian dish. It’s not butter chicken. Locals aren’t eating butter chicken you misinformed baboon.

Yea I’m sure Indians love tomato gravy based chicken covered in butter with very mild spice. Sounds JUST like what Indians like eating."

todayilearned,fd6j5sg,t3_ejr5x9,1578191842.0,"Hey you white people. Butter chicken was developed because you all can’t comprehend complex flavors or spice. So they mixed leftovers with a lot of fucking butter and white people loved it.

I get your thick headed but didn’t expect this to go over your head. 

Point is baker is a pretty bum QB that supposedly has more developed skills in terms of pocket passing. Let’s not even talk about the offensive weapons at his disposable compared to Lamar. 

Lamar is learning how to be a good pocket passer and without having that defined ability is already a top 5 QB in the league. If baker gets decked he will go from below average to god knows what? If Lamar gets decked (man it’s almost like we never saw a smaller guy named Mike Vick play just fine for a long time), he’s still working on a skill set that will enable him to have a long career."
