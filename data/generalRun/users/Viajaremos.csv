fatlogic,ffvsjgg,t3_evap0l,1580272021.0,"The trouble is, our instincts evolved when we were hunter gatherers- but we live in a different world, so therefore we need to adjust. 

Our eating instincts evolved at a time when food was scarce and when we were constantly active. Eating what you could when food was available made sense in a world where you constantly needed energy to be on the go and you didn't know if food might later become scarce. Those same instincts can lead us to overeat in a world where food is plentiful for most and we are much more sedentary. We need to use logic to override our instinct.

Likewise, our urge to pee evolved at a time where presumably find a place to go would be easier. Living in a modern world where pissing yourself is unaccepatable and it can sometimes take awhile to get a toilet, we learn to override that instinct and hold it in."

Maybe the way to keep them from being bored is letting them have what they want, but keeping their abilities limited somewhat and giving them games to compete with? Give them board games to compete at, video games, or let them keep some physical limitations and have them play sports?

Or- why not let them volunteer in the new reformed version of The Bad Place? They could help architects designs the challenges and tests for the humans to improve their morality, or serve as actors in the fake versions of The Good Place that they use to test people? They could hop on down to The Bad Place, help the architects mess with the humans being tested to get them better, and then chill out at The Good Place for some R&R when they need a break. Sounds better than that door anyway."

This isn't true. I know keto and the like are controversial on this subreddit, but I can say from this experience that when I virtually eliminated carbohydrates, none of this happened. I didn't go into starvation mode. I didn't start storing fat, I lost it quickly and built muscle. My mental health didn't deteriorate, it greatly improved. 

I see the FAs mention eliminating entire categories of food like it's a terrible thing, but a lot of people have greatly improved their health by doing just that. The human body is adaptable- and if it turned into such a mess every time food was scarce or the food source was changed we wouldn't have survived. 

Honestly, I would bet all of them could lose weight relatively easy if they would just stop eating food with added sugar. But they don't want to admit that, so they make up this BS about how your body shuts down and freaks out if it loses any category of food."

-They demand that nobody else discuss their fitness, nutrition, or health goals because it triggers them
-When people do succeed in weight loss, they demand that nobody celebrate it or be congratulated 
-They demand that all clothing stores accommodate them by selling clothes for their body type, whether or not there is a market for them.
-They want to buy seats in economy class on airplanes and expect their seat neighbors to tolerate them spilling over into their seats
-They want to tell doctors who are charged with treating them how to do their job
