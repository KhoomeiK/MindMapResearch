Cut to a few days ago. Alert barking at EVERYTHING including people on walks, goofy fear period behavior, and worst of all, getting into conflicts with other dogs (mostly other young males). 

It seems like for every problem we solve, 3 more pop up. I am finding adolescence significantly more stressful than the bitey puppy phase. I'd rather deal with potty accidents than reactivity and snarling at other dogs..."

ETA: don’t scold her or get upset.. it’s hard, it’s embarrassing when your puppy barks at someone! Just say “let’s go!” in a cheerful voice. You want to create good feelings about the scary thing, and scolding just reinforces her idea that the thing is scary and bad."

dogs,fff32g4,t3_et9s97,1579874374.0,"I would personally recommend waiting until you are out of school. I know a dog might fit your current schedule, but the first few years post-grad are really difficult. There are huge question marks surrounding your living situation, work schedule, finances, etc. Looking back, I know that having a dog right out of school would have been hugely stressful and honestly, I don't think I could have afforded proper care.

Having said that, if you are truly determined to get a dog, please know that it will take a *ton* of time and training to have a dog who can relax and nap at your feet in a library or lecture hall. The service dogs you see settling so nicely have had extensive training, and are often bred for this type of work and have inherently calm temperaments. 

An English Cocker could be a good fit! Moderate energy but great running and hiking partners, super biddable, friendly but not overly boisterous. Their coat requires regular maintenance and you'll need professional grooming for trims (unless you want to learn to do it yourself), but they are not crazy shedders. 

Puppies are also a TON of work. I know you will be with your family and have the summer off, but just make sure everyone in your family is on board. It truly takes a village!"

>Why is your 7 month old puppy not going into their crate? Why at 7 months are they still bothering you?

Not sure if that is directed at me, but I clearly stated that my puppy IS crate trained? I quite clearly stated that he goes to sleep in there voluntarily.

Did I not realize puppy raising was hard? Of course I did. I knew the first few months would be difficult. I grew up with dogs and I knew exactly what raising a puppy entailed.

But bringing a tiny baby animal home who demands every second of your attention is *hard*. It is a massive disruption to your routine and schedule. I was constantly anxious about whether I was raising my puppy correctly and setting him up for success. Most people on this thread have had a similar experience. It IS normal.

Also, please do not suggest that I don't ""work with my puppy every day like I should"". I go way above and beyond what the average dog owner does, and my puppy is far better behaved than most adult dogs we come across."

He has been left uncrated for up to 3.5 hours with no accidents so far, and frequently his crate for about 5 hours with no accidents. 

That’s not to say your pup won’t have accidents, but it goes to show that they can usually hold it a bit longer than they do when you’re around. 

I don’t think you should discourage her or ignore her when she asks to go out at this point, unless you KNOW she doesn’t have to go and she just wants to go out to play."
puppy101,ffa6021,t3_eshj30,1579728557.0,"He is alert barking. He is approaching adolescence, so he is becoming more sensitive to his environment and needs some help reacting appropriately.

Here are the methods we were advised to use:

1) When you notice him perk up and listen to something, very quickly praise and treat. You want to reward him in that very short moment where he is hearing something but not barking at it.

2) If he starts barking seemingly out of the blue, say “quiet” or “that’s enough” and scatter a handful of treats. This should distract him enough that he totally stops barking. 

With enough repetition, when you say your chosen phrase, he will stop barking and look at you in anticipation of receiving treats. You can start requiring longer periods of silence before delivering the reward. You are essentially teaching a “cut off” word. 

Keep a container of treats handy in every room so you can be consistent."

I always likes to browse r/DoggyDNA to see peoples' DNA test results. Some dogs are mixes you would never, ever guess by looking at them."
puppy101,fdnm8kw,t3_em9lqj,1578588730.0,"First of all, GREAT name and Instagram handle.

Second of all, you may find it will just depend on your puppy. The first two puppies I helped raise with my family slept downstairs in the living room. They did fine after one night of whining.

My current puppy shrieked for hours on end in the living room. We tried for 4 nights, then caved and moved the crate into the bedroom. He did not make a peep once he could see us close by. (He does not have any separation anxiety). 

It also depends on where you would like the crate set up longer term. I actually wanted the crate in the bedroom eventually because our living room is small, so moving it was fine with me."
Columbus,fdnfw1d,t1_fdnfrw6,1578584939.0,"Omg, that is heartbreaking and very close to us! That was my worst fear this morning.

puppy101,fdgn7pj,t3_elaemx,1578402925.0,"He should be fine for an hour, and I would put him in the crate. Get him nice and tired out before you leave(and of course make sure he goes potty)  and give him a frozen stuffed kong to work on. 

Unless your living room is *completely* puppy-proofed, I don't think it's safe to leave a 12-week old puppy loose. 

The earlier you get him used to being alone, the better!"
Dogtraining,fdfjjz8,t3_el4ajm,1578363198.0,"Our family dog that I grew up with used to nibble and “nurse” on soft toy when she was younger. Not sure if she was actually mimicking nursing, but that’s what it looked like. She did it when she was relaxed, and she is a perfectly well-adjusted dog.

It kind of reminded me of cats kneading on blankets- just a relaxing, soothing behavior. I don’t think it’s anxiety unless she is displaying other anxious behaviors."

Dogtraining,fddvjvz,t3_ekoou8,1578325032.0,"No, not traumatizing. Sounds like a pretty normal first bath. Just continue to practice regularly and involve a lot of treats. You can keep it really short and positive by just wetting her down (no shampoo) with lots of treats and then letting her out. You can try smearing peanut butter on the tub wall, too.

ETA: you be already be well aware, but you will want to practice grooming and handling with her a TON because of her breed. They tend to be really sensitive about handling."

Seconding salmon oil for omega 3s. We mix it in his kibble at breakfast and he loves it.

reactivedogs,fcxp0nq,t1_fcxc7ki,1578068116.0,It sounds like their trainer/behaviorist has recommended they go see a veterinary behaviorist as a next step.
puppy101,fcxjjuk,t3_eihcne,1578064502.0,"Love this! My goals are:

1. Have more patience with my teenage pup. 
2. Nail down those basics (recall and LLW in high distraction environments)
3. Get him comfortable with the dremel so I can do his nails at home
4. Get our CGC this summer when he's around 1 year old
5. Start an intro sport class, either nosework, puppy agility, or trick training"
dogs,fcxe8tx,t3_ejfknu,1578060602.0,"I would start with muzzle training to keep your dog and those around him safe. The Muzzle Up project has a great [training plan](https://muzzleupproject.com/muzzle-training/) to help him become acclimated to wearing it. 

 I don't think moving is going to change his behavior at all. Aggression is really complex and this sounds like a serious case. Unfortunately I don't think the internet is going to provide the help you need. Seek professional help so that you don't risk serious injury to dog or someone else's. 

I would strongly encourage that you find a behaviorist (not just a trainer) certified through the IAABC or CCPDT. These are behaviorists that use science-based methods to modify behavior and avoid using aversive techniques. They may even recommend talking to your vet about medication to help keep him out of the ""red zone"" during training. 

You may not ever have a dog who is friendly or reliable around other dogs, but with the right help you *can* change how he responds to his triggers."

Dogtraining,fcuydkv,t3_ej15a3,1577990989.0,"Our family dog that we got when I was a kid has licked me \*maybe\* 5 times in the 14 years that we've had her. We taught her a ""kiss"" trick but it was just touching her nose to our face and she acted like it was the grossest thing ever.

My current puppy will absolutely stick his tongue down my throat if given the opportunity. He will pin my shoulders down with his front paws to lick my face. He manages to get his tongue in my mouth more than I'd like to admit."
puppy101,fcserff,t3_eimtpk,1577915501.0,"I agree that the behavior you described sounds like overtired restlessness. I think it‘s totally fine to enforce a nap when this happens. Try not to reward the behavior with more play time. 

You can also try just totally ignoring her and see if she doesn’t choose to settle down on her own after a while. Sometimes this works on my 6 month old, sometimes he needs to be crated. I try to give him the opportunity to *choose* to settle on his own so I can reward him. 

If my pup is up for more than 2-3 hours and won’t settle, I’ll enforce a 1 hour nap."
dogs,fcsdflb,t3_einfj7,1577914992.0,"It sounds like you don’t want a herding dog but do you intend to participate in any other dog sports?

All border collies need a job or they can become destructive or neurotic. That job doesn’t have to be herding- it could be agility, disc, trick training, rally, etc. but they need a TON of daily training and mental stimulation. They are very intense dogs.

If that sounds like too much, fill out the breed questionnaire to get some other breed suggestions!"

dogs,fco56xi,t3_ei8ach,1577824294.0,"Herding breeds and many LGDs can live fine inside, but the puppies could have a serious alert and guarding instinct. I would not expect a dog of this mix to like strangers and may even be aggressive towards them.

dogs,fcgziyy,t3_eh9bf9,1577645670.0,"Many (if not most) dogs live happily and healthily with owners who work full time. Gotta have a way to pay for all those toys and treats!

You just have to make sure you can adequately exercise and interact with them when you are home. A low energy companion breed would be fine with a daily walk and lots of playtime and cuddles.

If the dog would be alone for longer than 8-9 hours daily, I would have a dog walker come by midday so the pup can get a potty break."
