NoStupidQuestions,ffc70co,t1_ffc53pk,1579793001.0,"This is the right answer here. It could be done, but would cost way too much for the average consumer, so it's not worth it to produce. In addition to the window coating, it likely wouldn't last long after constantly being applied to steam."

uwaterloo,ff9qc6q,t1_ff99ris,1579718622.0,"Ah yes, teachers and their $90k salary is still too little. Why not just throw more money at them, it's not like they don't have a ton of other benefits, like 5.5 hour days, or 3 months of vacation (oh wait, they do)"
uwaterloo,ff9pn5r,t1_ff91w1g,1579718136.0,"Considering the shitty job they've been doing ever since the ion train opened, (always late, often by 11 min, or sometimes early by 5) I don't think that they deserve a raise. Maybe if they did a better job at being consistent, I could see it. But the rudeness of some, and the lack of punctuality in others, doesn't exactly inspire gratitude."

WatchPeopleDieInside,ff6d791,t1_ff6c4bo,1579624639.0,"In Canada, you get your beginner's license after completing a written test, and are allowed to drive as long as there's an adult beside you and they have their license.

After a year, you can take a driving test, and if you pass, you're allowed to drive by yourself, with some restrictions.

After another year, you can take another driving test, and if you pass, you have your full license.

Some people will take a driver's course, even though it's not required, because you get a discount on insurance."

IdiotsFightingThings,fec9bm7,t3_eo550x,1578968948.0,"Cock and ball torture (CBT) is a sexual activity involving application of pain or constriction to the male genitals. This may involve directly painful activities, such as wax play, genital spanking, squeezing, ball-busting, genital flogging, urethral play, tickle torture, erotic electrostimulation or even kicking. The recipient of such activities may receive direct physical pleasure via masochism, or emotional pleasure through erotic humiliation, or knowledge that the play is pleasing to a sadistic dominant. Many of these practices carry significant health risks."
