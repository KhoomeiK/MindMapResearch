Psychiatry,ffcv19q,t1_ffc8ute,1579807835.0,"I work in SNF and we’re legally required to report this kind of behavior to authorities *as abuse*, regardless of intention, unfortunately. I’m not saying he’s a criminal. I know people have needs and curbing the behavior - or ideally, just the behavior’s impact - is ideal. But I don’t want the nursing home to be opening themselves up to damages especially if they’re talking about it in a forum like Reddit.

Edit to add: when I say “regardless of intention”, I mean regardless of the accused party’s mental state. We currently have a patient who has a pattern of exposing his genitals/masturbating in front of others for the exposure and associated pleasure and we have to report each incident. Unfortunately, the poor guy *doesn’t even remember the incidents*. It’s heartbreaking and embarrassing for him to be told he’s not allowed near a certain resident because of something he has no recollection of doing (but was witnessed doing)."

In the meantime... depending on what facility policy is about medications/chemical restraint, you have some options. Least restrictive: no roommate, eliminate “audience” whenever possible, no meals in common areas. Can also try clonidine. On-label did hypertension but also ADHD (impulse control) and successful in a study of hypersexual behaviors in dementia patients. 

Wildest option: get the guy out of there. He’s inappropriate to the point of it being sexual abuse, not to mention creating a work environment of sexual harassment (healthcare workers are legally entitled to freedom from sexual harassment regardless of patient’s mental state).  If he’s not psychotic, is this an antisocial personality disorder? Traumatic brain injury? Reaction to medication?"
