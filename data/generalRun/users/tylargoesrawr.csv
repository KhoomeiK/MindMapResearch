I'm trying to make it roughly based off my life. he was pure evil. through my travels i find more people negatively affected by his presence, some even being my siblings related to the bastard. i also want to push the narrative that he killed my lover.

they were classic pally's of Devotion and broke their oath to pursue a dark ambition/evil power. being my father is in a high place my mother was attracted to him; it is unknown where my mother is as i was abandoned

I swear myself to Selune because i wish to do as good as her and live within her light.  


My character is living to be a better person than my parents were/trying to give a better name to Changelings as they're known for deceit and treachery. my fighting style is going to be protection and i'm going to be a spell-caster for most of the game.

my goal for adventuring is to avenge my lovers death and find my long lost mother  


ffffffffffff how does this sound roughly?"
