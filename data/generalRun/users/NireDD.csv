You paid out of pocket for it for one. And for two she shouldn't be entitled to things. She also didn't make it clear considering that you thought it was a joke and really shouldn't have been joking about her self getting married around the time your wedding and marriage falls through. It's rather insensitive of her in my opinion. 

She has no right to be angry with you at all. 


Further more, it just seems like bad luck on her part to wear a dress in that nature. 

Also screw your mom in the ""take your power back"" bit because you know, it was never your sisters dress and was never agreed upon to begin with. 

In forward most regards if you are a seamstresses to some degree why didn't she just help you help her make a dress? That could be family bonding..."

His mother mentioned that he'd once worn a trump hat to school and that got him bullied. Some how this group of children justified attacking him a week later.... (not that it is okay right then and there either...) but the fact that they attacked and beat him up is sad.

One nice thing though is that trump is gaining black voter support. He's done quite a bit for the community. Oh! And the wall is going up!

""Yes I fucked another man and now I want you to pay for his kid...."" 

I actually saw a situation with school friend where this guy was married to this woman who already has a kid. Okay, this is the funny part. She gets CS from the biological father and STILL wanted to take him to court for child support when she should just be lucky he was a good step daddy to her child that ISN'T even HIS. The messed up thing is that I'm sure it isn't legal to hit up two people at once like that. Talking about feeding and clothing and unconditionally loving a child that isn't his? She's ungrateful. I get it if their marriage didn't work out but a child should not be leverage regardless of father or mother. 

I don't exclude also that sperm donnors who donate sperm to sperm banks shouldn't have to pay child support either. If a woman decides to have a child like that she needs to be able to secure funds to raise said child."

AmItheAsshole,ff1isrn,t3_eqzf0e,1579479885.0,"NTA - not all of your kids will feel the same about their chinese heritage. Your child is allowed to be uninterested in his oriental culture with out being accused of being a racist or prejudiced individual. If the first two children like it, thats fine. But, your youngest shouldn't have to live up to some bar set expectations like that as long as they make good life choices, are mentally healthy, and make decent grades in school to secure a future like anyone else. 

I know that it probably has to be rough though on your wife that her child is out right rejecting her culture and maybe you and your wife should adress these issues together to come to an understanding so that it doesnt put a strain on your marriage. She should try to come to an understanding and respect his feelings, because not everyone will identify with their culture like that. It's not like hes throwing around racial slurs and saying ""man f*** chinese people"" or other derogatory comments towards the culture, just that he doesnt relate. I won't call your wife an ahole for being upset but I do think she's having an over reaction. 

Maybe she should put her self in your youngest shoes.

I understand culture is an important aspect of life for Chinese folks. But I also think as long as your youngest just acknowledges their heritage it should be fine. As long as he isn't shitting on or slapping it down you know? He may eventually come to grow into his heritage but forcing him to do something he doesn't want to in this particular case may cause him to rebell harder. 

In an apples to oranges comparison it's kind of like making somebody who isn't intrested and doesn't really enjoy pecan pie eat it. They don't particularly hate the pie, they're just not intrested in it. It doesn't make them a bad person for it though."

Research all of your options, don't put it down to being forced to live with Gma and Gpa. 

You've worked too hard to give up now. 

A gap year if used productively could benifit you in the long run, and you can probably try to get your hands on study material for classes to prepare while you work some grunt work like someone said in the comments.

She had one job, which was to supervise her child. The fact that that child has destroyed art that will earn you money and pay your bills is enough said.

You are right, you absolutely can't do anything about that. Law breaking is law breaking. I also wonder why she was stealing, especially when that would put you, and your father in a bad position. With out an awnser I would drop her and her family like hot rocks. Even with an awnser I still wouldn't tolerate that, considering that she was not considerate of how her actions would effect your relationship with her, and how embarassing it must be for you and your father in this case considering he is a manager and has an image to maintain.

Disregarding a sense of general caution is only going to hurt you in the long run. Encouraging women to be alert and vigilant is not victim blaming, it is encouraging them protect them selves as responsible adults just like anybody else."
AskThe_Donald,feum6vu,t3_eqg2ir,1579387875.0,"It's rough when I try to talk to my grandma who's super democratic. She gets mad and immediately doesn't want to hear anything anymore when I have or make decent arguments against accusations or points that she has made. Often times she tries to pull that ""I'm older than you and therefore I know more than you"" buisness when her arguments don't work (just like socialism doesn't work lol) or says that I just don't understand. She always wants me to watch the MSM which I don't trust or like. It dissapoints me tbh that somebody can deny something so deeply and ignore facts and logic over pure silly and dishonest lies. She's college educated and enjoys talking about her intellectual abilities but that only establishes that college is garbage and for brain washing. 

With as much rejection as I see from basic facts, and basic understanding of real world logic I honestly don't believe that anything is gonna make them see or understand. You can argue all you want but they will just make up more ""facts"" and decive them selves. It's easier than admitting. 

It always cracks me up when democratic or leftist individuals justify violence towards people who disagree with them and then say that violence is wrong, and can't see the hypocrisy of their statements. I ended up asking my grandma if a woman wearing a short skirt wasn't asking for rape, then why should people wearing certain people wearing certain supportive articles of clothing be eligble to be exempt from that same train of thought. Of course she found some silly excuse to make for those individuals who got assaulted. No matter who is wearing what, the clause was supposed to be that assault is never justified. 

As for media based in the conservative side of things... bullshit is bullshit and will always be bullshit. I prefer not to be peddled lies. I think in most cases, the right wing discusses amongst itself when events go down instead of just regurgitating the same linear beliefs in agreement. When a conclusion has been come to at least in my case with my circle, it is always only after discussion and thought."

Conservative,fefwe0x,t3_eot2y2,1579067376.0,"The concern right now in my opinion is the states they're actually targeting. Here below the mason-dixon line Florida is fighting for their 2A rights right now. South Carolina has already put in place 2A sanctuary laws I'm pretty sure for every county. Georgia is following especially after what Bloomberg's done to Virgina. By the way that's basically an infringement of the constitution. He did it with money. One small portion of Blue Virgina is controlling the rest of Red Virgina. 

We had idiots condemming the gentleman who prevented a mass shooting in Texas. Mind you the person who ill intended to shoot up the church sucessfully already killed 1 or 2 people before he was shot and stopped in his tracks. How many more people would he have killed if there were no people who were operating under concealed carry? How much of a sizable travesty would this be for the media to blow up and complain about then?

Most gun violence happens in gun free zones. Most shootings have happened in very gun restricted areas. Schools are gun free. The walmart in texas was gun free. People who don't care about the law and don't respect the law aren't going to be stopped by the law anyway. So stripping citizens of their right to carry is sentencing them to possible death. 

Stripping us of our 2A rights is the fastest and easiest way to enslave us. A country only seeks to strip its citizens of self defense if it plans to kill/enslave or do something to them that the people wouldn't agree with. But they now cannot stop because they cannot form a militia and march in arms. You don't bring knives to a gun fight.

The elites only care about them selves. They are deluded, because they don't know what its like down here on the ground so to speak. They've got security teams. 

As an american I should have the right to bare arms for the need of self defense against threats both domestic and global. And right now we are facing domestic threats.

From another POV; what about women defending them selves with firearms? A 90lb college aged gal taking on some 190+lb man who intends to do unspeakable actions against her in a theoretical situation? They want her to be defenseless? I sure don't. 

Gun rights are important. They should never be infringed. Criminals won't obey the laws anyway. They will always find a way to gain firearms illegally."

Her response about the snacks is especially rude considering then it would be 'oh so you'll just starve my kid?' Idk how long you baby sit for but by no means should kids go with out being fed.

You asked her specifically not to bring the kid over when her kid is sick. Lots of people don't want icky sick germs. I bet your kid didn't want pink eye.

This may come off as a bit exaggerated but tbh if she's excusing her dangerous actions then it could be a problem in the future. With your daughters additude I know both my mother and my step father (both loving responsible parents) would have revoked my license. I don't know why her mom is excusing her daughters behavior, but lives on the road aren't a game. Sever consequences could happen because of reckless driving. And just because some other people ocasionally recklessly drive does not mean your daughter should be doing it either no matter if its once or all the time. Once is still a chance for an accident. 

As for the ex wife, thats frustrating that she can't see how this can be dangerous. It sounds like she wasn't willing to compromise or even see the dangers of the situation to begin with. I have thought about her response to the situation and regarded her feelings
 And in this very small case talking to her might not have done any good. Children must be raised in an integrally sound structured environment. Now don't get me wrong it's not the same as being a helicopter parent, but on the opposite end of the spectrum you can't just be jolly ole buddies with your kid. It's the parents job to raise their kids. And raising your daughter you are.

Your wife calling you a pussy because you didn't want a medical condition to flare up and potentially spike you an episode of IBS is out of line. 

Then the way her family treated you was unreasonable. Now if you were rude about it, made a mess or a scene and threw a tantrum that would be a diffrent story.

AmItheAsshole,fdt4tu7,t3_emw6xl,1578711932.0,"NTA coming from somebody who's currently a stay at home and expecting. Sounds like you provided all the comforts of home to your wife for a long decent measure of time and now you are getting on in age and declining in health. It wouldn't hurt her to return the favor. 

I have worked minimum wage jobs before, and perhaps it's the experience of the job environment that is making her grouchy and resentful. 

I think it's ridiculous that she's lashed out at you for making a gentle statement about possibly getting a better job. A better job could mean more money for less hours and more time to be home.

While I understand the notion and implications of house work from your wife as well as raising kids, and I hope OP that you do help, (you seem like a decent guy) your wife should understand and respect your request unless she wants you guys to be poor and have no money. 

My husband has been nothing but kind to me during the duration of my pregnancy, I've been quite sick twice during this time and it's made things very difficult to do, especially being tired all the time. So when he asks me to do something (which is rarely, he leaves only very few and very light duty things for me to do), and I am able I do it with out an argument. Usually I pick up after him as much as I can and I try to show my appreciation in as many ways as I can.

Rolling back around on my train of thought, somebody has to bring money in. You guys still have a 9 year old son. The fact that she smashed your older sons furniture is concerning and sounds very childish and tantrum like- she shouldn't be setting those kinds of examples infront of the child.

What does she really have to be angry about if she got to do all the traveling and other things that she wanted to do? Right now your family needs the support. Right now your family needs her help.

Everyone has adult responsibilities. 

At least that's how I'm seeing it.

I hope that you feel better, I know this must be stressful. And I hope that you're able to get things sorted out with your wife. It's very frustrating to see people be this way to each other."
AmItheAsshole,fdszype,t3_emv42p,1578710137.0,"NTA. 

This is the worst deal in the history of deals.

You're paying out of pocket for everything excluding the initial purchase of the car, expected to pay for gas and basically give your parents your time free of charge for what is essentially work. You're their child, not their personal slave and your siblings for the most part aren't your responsibility. 

In my opinion I really feel like this was them trying to one up you and basically use you for the things they didn't want to do that are part of their ADULT duties. You get nothing out of this, infact, this is money lost. 

I could understand saftey concerns with friends and such, but the fact that they expect you to pay for gas for errands that they want you to run for them is extreemly unfair. They should pay for gas for errands  at least if not for your time mostly because driving your siblings around is time you could have spent at work or studying etc. 

(One friend is a distraction, just as much as a sibling can be a distraction, and you have two of them I think? So isn't that hypocrisy if you're carrying more than 1+ family member in the car?)

Further more, you don't keep any of your investments, in maintenance or in miles. So why should you invest in their circus. They want the vehcile for them selves after you go to college. That doesn't help you in any way at all. 

I think you've thought this through quite a bit op. I really think you should save up for your own vehicle and insurance. What they expect is very... demanding.

Of course if and when you do get your own vehicle, please practice safe driving. Make sure you save up an emergency fund for college too just in case vehicle wise something happens. College can be rough with the studying and such and you may need to study more and work less hrs. 

I hope things work out for you, and I wish you the best of luck!"
