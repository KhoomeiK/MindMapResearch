loseit,ffeoq85,t3_et3h36,1579857771.0,"Given that you’re at a healthy weight, I wonder how much of this is that your self-perception is off. 

It seems like you’ve internalized the things people have said to you about your weight through the years. And that’s still how you see yourself, even though right now none of it is objectively true. 

Hell, even now that I lost all the extra weight I had when I was about your age, I still feel like it has to be fake. That I’ll wake up one morning and magically be right back at my starting weight. My rational mind knows that’s not how it works. But the other part of me just hasn’t had the time to catch up. 

Also keep in mind that you’re still growing into your body. You’re going through puberty now, so objectively speaking, you’re the least attractive you’ll ever be. Take good care of yourself and you won’t have your dream body overnight, but it’ll all work out in the end."

Being on this sub has really made me realize how much I’ve taken this for granted. My mom is a software engineer but she worked from home. My dad has very flexible work hours and has always been the more involved parent. So they’ve both lived parts of the stay home parent lifestyle and the career person lifestyle and I got a very intimate view of the upsides and downsides of each one. Now, can I make important life decisions without having epic meltdowns? We’re getting there. But I do appreciate that I have agency. 

That being said, I’ve maybe been predisposed to not want to be a stay home parent. I had lots of friends growing up who had unhappy SAHMs. Their beliefs kept them continuing to stay home, but money got tight, and suddenly they were shit out of luck when it came time to find jobs. The other women in my family’s social circle who don’t work are young retirees.

I’ve never been able to picture a future where I didn’t have a career of some sort. I know that I’m not cut out to be a homemaker. Maybe it’s because I’ve had so much negative exposure to stay home parenting. But I’m glad that I had information to go off of beyond fearmongering."

I’m American, but I have a friend who grew up in one. His family goes back multiple generations in the church, and his parents even met there. His family doesn’t sound fundie, but according to him, the general public perception is that he grew up in a cult. I can imagine that being part of a well disliked minority doesn’t do them any favors when it comes to gaining them power. That and their main political competition is churches that go back for centuries. 

As someone who grew up in a church that was mostly converts, I’m not surprised that it draws mostly younger people there. It may be regressive, but it is countercultural by European standards."

It’s just that the time I now spend at the gym, I once used to just sit around and browse Reddit. 

As you can see, I still do that often. But I used to have *hours* where I didn’t do anything meaningful. I thought I didn’t have time, but what I really didn’t have was energy, whether it was physical or emotional. Exercise can help a lot with these things, especially if you start out very light.

But turns out, it didn’t feel so bad when I just started out eating smaller portions of what I did before. And then later decided I was going to eat healthier foods as well. And then even after that decided I was going to start exercising. Especially after I got to feel each incremental change improve my life. 

The reality is, people who live healthy lifestyles likely have been at it for a long time, whether they were born into it or adopted it later. And there’s really no shame in taking your time to get there. The best thing you ever did was figuring it out."

fatlogic,fefs98x,t3_eorlnp,1579063671.0,"Last week, I had a whole therapy session dedicated to how unhappy I was with the vanity pounds I gained over the holidays. At its root, it had nothing to do with looks. Especially not other people’s. Beyond the fact that it was visible every time I looked into a mirror. It was just about how it was the result of emotional eating, that happened because of my tense relationship with my relatives.

I think this also has quite a lot to do with it. Female dominated spaces are all about validating other people’s emotions, for better or worse.

But someone who needs to get fit but is afraid to take the first steps is probably berating themselves for letting themselves get like that to begin with. And looking into that critical voice can be the first step.

AskAnAmerican,fcof4v5,t1_fco9oea,1577830730.0,"Yeah, I have a European friend I met while he studied abroad in the US. While he was here, he deliberately took classes unrelated to his degree just because he could. Turns out, now he wants to make a career out of the thing he studied here. He’s lucky that his background is in business, it would’ve been a much bigger pain in the ass if it was something less universally applicable."
AskAnAmerican,fcoesth,t1_fcnawij,1577830498.0,"The brief study abroad courses I did in the UK was really fascinating in this regard. They were in international relations. The class material focused more on specific case studies, and used them to introduce theory. While similar classes in the US would have started with the theory, and used that to explain the more isolated cases. I had classes at home that were structured the British way, but the breadth first approach was more common. 

Exams were a thorough culture shock though. You would get a long list of possible essay questions, and you’d answer one or two, but give very detailed answers to them. It was easier to study for because you didn’t need to know anything beyond the specific questions you needed to answer. But when you take grades out of the equation, I’m a pretty big fan of learning for the sake of learning and the breadth approach is nice there."

AskAnAmerican,fcocoy2,t1_fco84px,1577829014.0,"That’s true if you’re talking about institutional racism. Slavery, killing indigenous people, etc. were a pretty big part of the founding of the US, and that nasty legacy does rear its head. But because of that history our national identity isn’t tied to a specific ethnicity. So I don’t think casual racism is as common. For example, as an Asian, most people who assume I’m not American are foreigners. 

Whereas, I think in other countries, the reverse is true. Many of them haven’t had ethnically grounded legal issues, but there’s a lot more of a “you can’t sit with us” vibe from ordinary people."

xxfitness,fcbwhxd,t3_egz9zc,1577591742.0,"I’m Chinese American, and am actually visiting family in Canada at the moment. 

My family never really idealized a specific body type, and are pretty supportive of my fitness goals. But my mom never lost her pregnancy weight and has a complex about it. My dad, my brother, and I have all successfully maintained weight loss. Whenever we talk about that she makes sure to inject comments about how she’s the fattest person in the family. When it comes to the rest of our weights, losing weight=eating disorder, and gaining weight=automatic morbid obesity. 

More damage was done to my relationship with food. My mom moralized about food excessively, and we couldn’t eat “bad” food around her without getting lectured. She also freaked out when we ate large meals, even when they were healthy, while not realizing the fruit and nuts she snacked on had calories. So mealtime always left me hungry.  I made up for that by overeating junk food when she wasn’t around. Even as I was losing weight, I didn’t start truly eating healthy until I realized that it could actually be enjoyable. 

As for my extended family, my dad’s side of the family is “naturally thin”. But they do equate food with affection, and have to have lots of it ready for us at all times. My parents themselves reject the Chinese thing where you have to refuse things you actually want out of politeness, but it’s very ingrained on this side of the family. So it’s difficult to set boundaries, and my gigantic appetite doesn’t help. My mom’s side of the family is better with this, but they’re all morbidly obese, save my mom who’s just out of the healthy BMI range. 

tl;dr: My family isn’t that bad about body image but is awful about food, and that’s been annoying as I’ve started taking fitness seriously."
