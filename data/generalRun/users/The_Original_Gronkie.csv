inthenews,fg1a3zg,t1_fg14zyt,1580423509.0,">I'm just saying real life phenomenon matching up with accounts from the Bible give it credence and it should be looked into and not dismissed.

That's very poor logic. Just because there may be a kernel of truth in some historical incidents, doesnt lend any credence to the many supernatural tales that make up MOST of the Bible. A thousand years from now, someone might read a story about a giant ape named King Kong climbing the Empire State Building in NYC. Just because there was such a place as NYC, and such a building as the Empire State Building, doesnt automatically mean that there was an enormous ape called King Kong. 

The physical world in Biblical times was exactly like it is now. It obeyed the same laws of physics and medicine as it does now, and people were exactly the same. Con men may have done magic tricks to fool gullible people, but that doesn't make them miracles. And writing these stories down centuries after they occurred also calls their accuracy into question.


>the kings of Arabia, Persia, and India; going to visit a baby Christ all on their own accord to follow a random star in the sky that hadn't been there before, all documented by their nations' historical records. 

I have never heard this before, and I won't accept it on your word alone. I would need to see secular third party sources for this. I wouldn't be surprised to find that the source for this ""fact"" is highly dubious, and is being wildly adjusted to fit the pre-decided narrative. Besides, one story calls them Kings, and another calls them Wise Men, so even the Bible can't agree on who these men are.

What we do know is that much of the origin story of Jesus relies on borrowing tropes from well-established pagan religions at the time, and those facts were applied to Jesus to make those pagans more comfortable in converting. 

For all your reliance on Biblical incidents being confirmed by outside sources, the only source that has ever documented Jesus is the Bible. No other account of him has ever shown up in any other historical or archeological record contemporary with his time. In fact, he actually stands out for NOT being mentioned. For instance, Pontius Pilate is well-documented, but nowhere in the records of his time in office does it mention anything like the death of Jesus. Likewise Herod."

At that point, he'll believe himself to be untouchable. He can do literally anything in the open with no repercussions at all. He'll openly invite Russia and China to help with his campaign, both in terms of interference and illegal campaign cash. He knows that Facebook is fully on board, and will be a willing propaganda arm for the Republicans. He'll encourage the governors and Secretaries of State of every Red and purple state to commit whatever election and voter fraud they need to. He may even openly offer pardons in case anything should happen to them, but he'll assure them that the Justice Department won't be investigating any reports of fraud or campaign finance violations.

He will cheat in every possible way because he knows that the ONLY way anything bad can happen to him is if the Dems take over. So he will do anything and everything to keep that from happening.

I once saw a RFQ for a violin with VERY specific requirements as to age, builder, price, etc. I was confused for a moment until I realized that the procurement officer had already struck a deal for a specific instrument, but had to put it up for competing bids. However, the only possible supplier could be the owner of that specific violin, who would automatically have the winning bid.

Source: I used to work for a company who trained people and businesses to sell to the government. They advised people to not even bother going through lists of RFQs because almost all of those were already done deals. The way to get contracts was to pursue relationships with military bases, embassies, and other government entities, then cut deals with their procurement officers, help them write the RFQs, and then put in their bid."

>Zero tolerance meant that U.S. authorities would criminally prosecute all adults caught crossing into the U.S. illegally.

They became the practice under Trump’s policy, which he suspended a year ago.

>Before Trump’s zero-tolerance policy, migrant families caught illegally entering the U.S. were usually referred for civil deportation proceedings, not requiring separation, unless they were known to have a criminal record. Then and now, immigration officials may take a child from a parent in certain cases, such as serious criminal charges against a parent, concerns over the health and welfare of a child or medical concerns.

As for the number of immigration judges that Obama appointed, you are welcome to use Google to answer your own question.

A big part of the Trump policy was that it was launched instantly and there was literally no preparation or plan. Children and family identities weren't being well-documented or tracked, and to this day there are families that will never be reunited. Everything this administration does is incompetent, and so is the tracking system for these children.

McConnell abused the filibuster for years because all he would have to do is tell the Dems he planned to filibuster so they would withdraw or drop the legislation. The Dems should have called him on it every time, and make some hapless Republican pull the short straw and spend the next 36 hours reading Dr. Seuss books into the Congressional Record. It wouldn't be too long before they'd all get tired of wasting the time, exhausting themselves, and looking like total idiots on the nightly news before they'd be forced to actually work with the Dems to resolve their issues. 

But McConnell is the biggest bully in the schoolyard, and like most bullies, he has a sixth sense of how to drill directly into the heart of his opponent. He knows the Dems are spineless weenies, so he takes full advantage of it whenever possible, and they let him. 

They should have issued the subpoenas, and when those subpoenas were ignored, arrested those witnesses. Let the Republicans go to court to get them released, not make the Democrats go through the courts to see if they have the right. The Constitution gives the Dems subpoena power, it does NOT give anyone the right to ignore the subpoena. The court challenge was up to the Republicans, and their people can sit in a prison cell until the courts make their ruling."

Funny how you aren't even close to correct.

Dow record high under Bush - 14,093 (10/12/07)

Dow on Obama's Inauguration Day - 7,949 (1/21/09)

Dow record low under Obama - 6,507 (3/9/09)

Dow surpassed Bush's record under Obama - 14,253 (3/5/13)

Dow on Trump's Inauguration Day - 19,827 (1/20/17)

The previous high under Bush was 14,093. Obama surpassed that on March 5, 2013, and continued to hit a series of highs throughout the remainder of his presidency until he handed off the office to Trump with the Dow at almost 20,000.

So your ""fact"" that ""Obama didnt have any record breaking stock market rises"" is clearly, flatly wrong. The real fact is that Trump performed a near economic miracle taking the Dow from a low of about 6500 to high of almost 20,000 during his administration. That's over 13,000 points, nearly doubling its previous high. No president has ever presided over such an enormous increase in the stock market in history."

You are stating a speculative assumption as if it were fact, and you are totally wrong. The family lives in a house so small that the kids each get one of the two bedrooms, and the parents sleep in the living room. Finneas' ""studio"" has a laptop and a few off the shelf pieces of equipment. He has an old upright spinnet piano, and Billie even says ""There's no soundproofing or anything."" There's a big window to the outdoors right above the piano. A bird singing outside would ruin the take. That bedroom ""studio"" is about as lo-fi as it gets, and the equipment is within the range of many, many teenagers in this country. He just spent his free time playing and getting good with recording and editing programs instead of the latest video game.

This album is the literal definition of a bedroom production, and that's why Finneas was given the Grammy for Best Producer last night, over huge names with numerous projects listed. Finneas had one project under his name, but look at what he created with such a limited amount of resources."
Music,ffqnx01,t1_ffqaivk,1580139525.0,"I just think metal is severely limited in expression. Lots of lyrics about darkness, death, blood, supernatural, ho-hum.

The subject NEVER changes, in fact it becomes a contest to outdo all the other bands singing about the same thing. 

Often it seems like the whole thing is just a vehicle to get to every metalhead's favorite cliche - the whole band (drums, bass, rhythm guitar) playing some complicated rhythm en masse, really really fast, and really really loud. Impressive, I guess, but it really just takes a bunch of rehearsal.

Neither artist was nominated for a Grammy, so I don't understand how or why that happened. 

Don't get me wrong, it was great! After all of these pretentious little Broadway style numbers with giant choreographed dance ensembles, Aerosmith came out and tore the place up with a good old fashioned rock show, but it didn't really fit. Maybe they just felt like they had to represent the rock side of things, although I think Gary Clarke  did a much better job of that (even though none of his Grammys was in a rock category)."

But it isn't the kind of music or album that I'm ever going to crave. I'll listen to it a few times, but it won't end up on my Go-To playlist.
