politics,fffffri,t1_fffd93e,1579882795.0,"It's not that we overpay them.  It's that we pay them what is required to incentivize someone to go through the insane process of becoming a doctor in the first place.  Honestly with the amount/cost of schooling and the number of hours doctors work, I'd say we're underpaying them.  If we provided their education for free and doubled or tripled the number of doctors available, then cut their work week down to like two 24 hour shifts, we could probably cut their pay in half and get better patient outcomes on the same amount of money."
politics,fffcl9k,t1_fffa1o8,1579880993.0,"The reason that healthcare is so expensive in America compared to other developed nations is not that there's something special about America that makes it that way inherently.  It's a collection of things that can be fixed by changing the system resulting in less total money spent and better patient outcomes.    


We charge people who want to be doctors hundreds of thousands of dollars to complete med-school and then they need to charge lots of money to pay their loans when they enter the work force.  This also creates scarcity of doctors further driving up the price and forcing doctors to work 80 hour work weeks and lowering patient outcomes.  


By having a complicated private insurance system, there's a bunch of extra overhead.  With single payer you'd eliminate most of that.  Additionally, single payer creates bargaining power.  Currently America operates on a supply/demand system so the inelastic demand created by life or death situations drives prices up.  A single payer system would address this by only paying what something cost to produce plus a margin.    


Basically, there's a lot of people getting realllly rich for pushing papers around in our system currently and artificially inflating the cost of healthcare while making patient outcomes worse.  I agree the system has to make the same that it costs but it really would be cheaper if we just got rid of most of the overhead with single payer."

The inability to be raw/honest around women is PART of toxic masculinity.  You will never solve toxic masculinity without including women in the discussion.  
You were already indoctrinated into it before you got to church.  Women are people too and they're almost identical to men.  Most differences are cultural and not innate.

&#x200B;

Thank you for taking the time to share your thoughts regarding the legalization of marijuana. I appreciate hearing from you.

Proposals to legalize marijuana for recreational use should not be taken lightly. I understand that many individuals believe marijuana use is benign. The fact remains, however, that marijuana use can result in adverse health consequences, particularly among adolescents. It goes without saying that a product which has adverse psychological and physiological impacts on its user can ultimately harm third parties. For me, it is crucial that we continue to educate ourselves on all the short-term and long-term health and societal consequences of marijuana use before we consider unrestricted legalization of the drug.

With regard to the legalization of marijuana for medical use, I believe this issue deserves serious consideration and debate, and I understand the policy positions on both sides of the argument. For me, it is crucial that we continue to research and understand the benefits and consequences of medical marijuana. That said, burdensome government regulations should not be an impediment to legitimate and responsible medical research. I understand that, in some cases, there may be medicinal qualities to marijuana and cannabidiol (CBD) oils. As Speaker of the House of Representatives in North Carolina, I supported giving some of North Carolina’s teaching medical centers the ability to conduct research on CBD oils.

You may be interested to know that in the 115th Congress, I was an original cosponsor of two pieces of legislation related to medical marijuana research. S. 1276, the Cannabidiol Research Expansion Act, would remove unnecessary barriers to research and allow scientists to study the biochemical processes, impact, dosing, risks, and possible benefits of CBD and other components of the marijuana plant. S. 1803, the Marijuana Effective Drug Studies (MEDS) Act of 2017, would assist with improving medical research of marijuana by reducing regulatory barriers. Please know that if legislation related to marijuana come before the Senate, I will keep your views in mind.

Again, thank you for taking the time to contact me. Please do not hesitate to get in touch with me again about other important issues.

Sincerely,"
