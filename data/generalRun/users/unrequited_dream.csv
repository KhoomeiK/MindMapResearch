news,ffnur89,t1_ffnnqeb,1580071106.0,"From the wiki 
> Eagle County Sheriff investigators first confronted Bryant with the sexual assault accusation on July 2.[1] During the July, 2003, interview with investigators, Bryant initially told investigators that he did not have sexual intercourse with his accuser, a 19-year-old woman who worked at the hotel where Bryant was staying. When the officers told Bryant that she had taken an exam that yielded physical evidence, such as semen, Bryant admitted to having sexual intercourse with her, but stated that the sex was consensual.[2] When asked about bruises on the accuser's neck, Bryant admitted to ""strangling"" her during the encounter, stating that he held her ""from the back"" ""around her neck"", that strangling during sex was his ""thing"" and that he had a pattern of strangling a different sex partner (not his wife) during their recurring sexual encounters. When asked how hard he was holding onto her neck, Bryant stated, ""My hands are strong. I don't know."" Bryant stated that he assumed consent for sex because of the accuser's body language.
