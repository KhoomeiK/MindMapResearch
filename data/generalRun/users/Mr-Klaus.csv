On a serious note: please do not feed or be friendly to wild animals, if they approach you, do what you can to scare them off. This isn't even about them being dependant on you, it's about their safety.

What happens is, these animals start seeing humans as friendly. Problem with this is, when a wild animal approaches a person, that person can feel threatened and this can result in the animal being attacked in supposed self defence.

Another scenarios is, these animals will approach hunters thinking they're friendly, and as we know, the whole point of hunting is to kill animals.

Samsung and Amazon have already admitted that they record convos and sell them to third parties. Your phone records shit when active listening is turned on.

The point that I'm trying to make is that all these forms of recording private convos 100% legal and these companies rely on ignorance from people like you who don't bother looking this shit up.

Some of the biggest brands and apps out there have some really fucked up privacy policies, for example, Facebook is even worse than Amazon and Samsung, they actually demand 100% of the permissions on your phone. This means that as long as you're using the Facebook app on your phone, Facebook has access to all your data, including your call records, text messages and browsing history.

In case you're curious, the advice I was going to offer you was to tell him to stop. Don't just tell him that it bothers you or that it makes you feel insecure, tell him to stop, period.

If he doesn't stop or gets defensive after you tell him that, then leave and move on, trust me, it's for the best.

Documentaries,fbt35ae,t3_ee8gax,1577067052.0,"Why is this propaganda allowed here? FYI, the numbers and intent used by these bigots has been proven as wrong by scientists.

These people get two key pieces of info wrong:

1: **Behaviour & Beliefs:** 

Muslim immigrants and their children are very different. A Muslim immigrant might still hold views from their old country. Kids born from these immigrants tend to be more like their host country's counterparts. 

Granted you'll find a few here and there who hold extremist views, but the vast majority tend to identify more with their host country than their parent's birth country.

2: **Birth rates:**

These propagandists are telling you that whites will be a minority based on how many kids immigrants are having. It's a science fact that the more wealthy the population, the less kids people will have regardless of race or belief. This is why people in poorer countries tend to have more kids than people in wealthier countries.

These propagandists are assuming that kids born from immigrants will have just as many kids as their parents. 

This is not true. Like I said on my first point, kids born from immigrants tend to identify more with their host country than where their parents are from. This means that these kids will have the same amount of children as the local population.

In other words, the non-white population will not increase through non-white birth rates because the children of immigrants will have the same amount of kids as the host country's white population. 

This idea that immigrant kids will have as many kids as their parents is the sole ""evidence"" that these propagandists use to back their ""whites will soon be a minority"" theory.

Lastly, don't trust worded statistics, only trust them when the numbers are included. They say that Muhammed is the most popular boy's name in the UK to scare you. 

They conveniently forget to mention that it was only used 7000 times, which is less than 1% of the kids born in the UK. This number doesn't even hope to make a dent on the population.

Furthermore, these propagandists are ignoring the fact that there are different variations to the name. In actuality, the most popular boy's name is Oliver, but these propagandists are combining the different variations of Muhammed as one name but not doing the same for non-Muslim sounding names."
