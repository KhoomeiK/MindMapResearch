There are lots of videos on how to make broth.  [Here is one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjDHii3Ngj8).

But if you don't have any homemade broth, store bought is fine.

To make tasty chicken soup, the more flavorful ingredients you put in, the more flavorful your soup will be.

So use a whole diced onion (or two,depending on size), a leek or two (well washed and sliced), lots of carrots (at least four, diced), lots of celery (at least four stalks and include some of the young leaves).  You can saute the veggies in a small amount of butter or oil first for more flavor.  Add your bay leaves and freshly ground pepper to the pan, too.

Then add your broth and simmer until all the veggies are semi-cooked. Add noodles or rice if you want a heartier soup and then simmer until they are done, too.

At the very last moment, check your seasonings, add all the chopped chicken meat and a large handful of minced parsley."

Life in prison without the possibility of parole is ample punishment even for a heinous crime like this one.

Anything else is just blood lust and revenge.  Wanting the death penalty is understandable, but it is a primitive response.  A civilized society should have a civilized response to crime.

That is apart from the fact that NO innocent people can be executed under this system AND it is far cheaper for US taxpayers to ban it outright."
