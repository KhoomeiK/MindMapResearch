wholesomememes,ffw44nm,t1_ffw3uhk,1580283493.0,"Teacher work life varies pretty greatly. It certainly has some benefits! But teachers (especially those in low income areas) are often run ragged with crazy hours and no overtime pay during the school years. And frequently will buy (and are expected to) school supplies for their kids out of their own pocket. Not to mention the incredible stress of seeing children in hopeless situations day in and day out. It’s a hard goddamn job for a lot of them, and that’s not lessened in the least by teachers who are treated well and paid fairly (which I’m sad to say is not the norm)."

Advance Publications did 2 billion in sales last year. They can fuck right off asking for charitable contributions from private citizens."

More than that, though, people hate So iLL because they market like a lifestyle brand trying to be the supreme of climbing.
