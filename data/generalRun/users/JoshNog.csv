BattlefieldV,fex4ebu,t3_eqj7ev,1579424137.0,"I know many people say they stopped playing when they didn't, but we are many that really did. I haven't played in almost 3 weeks, which is a first for me. I am enjoying SWBF2 again and having fun and not getting tilted is a great feeling. It's ironic I celebrate having fun in a game when it is the goal of every game."

MMORPG,fdmoddm,t3_em62j1,1578557922.0,MMORPGs started being successful and big companies saw the opportunity to suck the industry dry and new generations don't care as long as they have their shinny reward. Bad mix.
