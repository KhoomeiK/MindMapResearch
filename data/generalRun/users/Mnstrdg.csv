Start by very small increments, try fasting for 6 hours. If that works, try 12, and so on. Setting a goal to fast for 30 days is very difficult and can be discouraging because the goal is go far off.  

If you can, purge all the sweets, carbs, etc.  (Hard/impossible due to family I know.) I like to stock up on canned tuna.  If you feel the need to break-down, have some tuna (I like mine with hot sauce). It doesn't call to you like sweet stuff and if you do have some you are getting good protein and salts.

I'm on a low dose of Bp meds and have very bad tinnitus in my left ear from shooting. I've not noticed it getting any worse and have been using Moda, up to 200mg per day, weekends off, for well over a year now.
