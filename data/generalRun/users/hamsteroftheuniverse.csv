facepalm,fffno97,t1_fezlbo3,1579887863.0,">We know about the deaths of the apostles by the writings of early Church historians and the first fathers of the faith. These writings are noncanonical. They are not in any New Testament document, exactly as I said. 

*Church historians. As in religious text. It's why I specifically used the phrase ""religious texts"".

>And how do we know God doesn't exist?

Because its existence can't be proven. As can't the existence of miracles. The same way I ""know"", the Santa Claus isn't real. I find it quite humorous that you'd spend this much time on debating an issue you can't prove to be correct. Do you think you are the first person in the world that has finally figured out how to prove that God exists and that Jesus did miracles? The ego on you, geez.

As I said earlier, even if you'd be able to reliably show that historically the apostles did in fact die as martyrs you would still not have evidence on why they chose to die or what they witnessed happen themselves. You say mass hallucinations of that kind are rare? We still have people that claim to see ghosts, who swear on the effects of crystal healing and homeopathy, who are convinced that they actually witnessed a preacher heal someone live. I say they are commonplace. We have people actually dying because they rely on ""alternative medicine"". Should someone find the writings of these people a few centuries later and decide to pass them on as true events, there would probably be a person like you saying: ""Why they really have *died* for it, if the big pharma wasn't really a lie and homeopathy was the truth?""

I did notice that you somehow got mostly hung up on the fact that I said that Jesus's existence was debated more than you thought, so I'll close with that one. I do concede that how I framed my comment was disingenuous and would have better be left unsaid the way that it was. The historicity of Jesus is a widely accepted fact among historians, but you can find more info on the matter and the people involved etc at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christ_myth_theory"

facepalm,feyudsr,t1_feyhgbm,1579450638.0,"I haven't abandoned anything. My previous comment was further expanding on how you are going in circles. Religious texts built on other religious texts are not proof or evidence of anything. 

Also, the existence of Jesus is a debated issue even if the majority side on ""possibly"" (I'm not going to even go to the whole ""why would it matter since even if he existed, he didn't perform miracles and wasn't the son of God, since God or the supernatural doesn't exist""). You should know that some acknowledged historians also side on ""probably not"" but apparently you haven't investigated the issue on all possible directions. Although that isn't surprising since you seem to have a bias towards picking sources. 

You obviously haven't read on pretty much anything than religious sources. All the questions you've asked have already been answered numerous times. You just haven't wanted to go through them. Anything I say is very unlikely to make you go through them so that's why this is futile."
facepalm,fexj7ss,t1_fetnij5,1579431872.0,"Well, on top of that the death of James is in the New Testament, the historic evidence on if, how and why these people existed or died is very slim when you don't count Christian tradition and the Church itself or other religious texts as a reliable source. Which I'm sure you do judging by your other comments.

I'm going to give you an equally convincing reasoning: Why would Cornifi3ld make these claims knowing it was a lie? Why would anyone be a Christian if they knew it was a lie?

I'm sure continuing this discussion with you is nothing but a waste of time."
