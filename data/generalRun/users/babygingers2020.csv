I have had a REALLY hard time motivating myself to get up and moving in order to exercise this pregnancy, but the midwives at my birthing center keep reminding me I'm basically training for a marathon here so I need to be exercising daily. I'm just so used to maintaining a low weight without putting forth any effort and I know that makes people not have much sympathy for me, but it definitely makes it easier for me to hate my body now that its changing and expanding. I keep just trying to tell myself that what my body is doing is a beautiful thing, and I am beautiful because of it."

parrots,fcg8ms9,t3_eh6t1n,1577637644.0,"Someone is DEFINITELY missing him.. those are very expensive birds who only bond with one person. Put an ad out that an African grey was found, post it everywhere you can think of. Your city might have a lost and found animals Facebook page, but also join Lost and Found Birds worldwide Facebook and the admins will help you, they are great. This bird looks in wonderful condition so someone has been taking good care of him.

Edit: I cannot emphasize enough how important it is this bird get back to their owners. Greys are incredibly timid birds with a limited comfort zone and the bird will be terrified with suddenly all new surroundings and people and cage accessories. If you would like a bird of your own I encourage you to buy one as a baby so they can bond to you. These birds live up to 80 years and are lifetime companions.
Side note, please dont clip their wings if they weren't clipped when you found them. That happened to a bird of mine after flying away and when we got her back it took her a while to learn to fly and land again"

My goodness.. terrible on so many levels, I'm sorry. On a related note, my MIL announced to the family (complete surprise to my husband and I) that her Christmas gift to us was the new carpet and 5 gallons of paint that our going into our rental house which she owns. She neglected to mention that when she told us she wanted to have those things done, we offered to do all the labor so she didnt have to pay someone.
