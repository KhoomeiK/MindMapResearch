It's not really scary, but it's kinda weird and a little funny. So, my mom and I were having a walk. When we passed by an old man, I gave him a friendly wave and a happy, "" Hello! "" My mom didn't say anything, she only looked at me with confusion. She asked me, "" Honey, who did you say hi to? "" I looked at her, and said, "" The old man. Remember? "" She shook her head no."
