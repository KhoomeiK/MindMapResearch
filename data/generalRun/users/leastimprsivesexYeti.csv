The lions, tigers and other carnivores didn't eat every lesser animal and then fight for dominance among themselves? Do I really believe the earth is 6000 years old when we have living trees on earth that are much older than that. Do I really believe a man walked on water, or another was able to part an entire sea? What experience in my life to this point gives me confidence any of this is true?

i agree with you it is very hypocritical for celebrities to espouse action on climate change, but then take private jets.

However, with respect to fossil fuels, I assume you mean you believe Climate Change is a hoax?

Ask them questions.

One common point they raise is ""everything should be left to the free market except military and police"". The question then is, why? Why is collective effort and democracy necessary to prevent wrong-doing among police and military, but nothing else is?

Ask them other questions:

1. If the free market does it better always, are you saying we should have no legislated governing bodies for doctors and lawyers and other professionals? Literally any mommy blogger can hang out a shingle as a ""doctor"", and consumers will have no way to know competence and quality?
2. What about securities? Securities laws were created because unscrupulous people were selling sham or fake companies and scamming the life savings out of unsophisticated people (think your grandma).
3. What about anti-trust laws? They were created because the inevitable result of uncontrolled capitalism is monopoly or oligopoly. Peter Thiel devotes an entire chapter to this in his book Zero to One (he is an ardent capitalist and thinks monopoly is a good thing) . Without anti-trust laws, you end up in the same centralized place as under communism. No need to prevent this? And we are seeing it, Microsoft has been charged under anti-trust. Google, facebook, large agriculture, big pharma. They just under cut small players until they can't compete and then buy them.
4. What about the social safety net? They believe people who don't work are just lazy. This is true about some recipients. But most who are dependent on social services cannot work for one reason or another.
5. What about healthcare? The data is clear that a sole private system produces inferior health outcomes for the populous. Data shows best outcomes are under a 2 tier system (strong public system, with a private option). Why would we have a sole private system when the data is clear that it's inferior?
6. What about traffic laws? Do they believe people shouldn't require a license to drive? Any 16 year old can just buy a car without training and use our roads?
7. What about roads and bridges? These are necessary for society, but usually not profitable as they are hugely capital intensive to build.
8. What about R and D. Many tech breakthroughs (including the internet) were created by universities with public funding, and other government entities. The private sector doesn't like to invest unless its low risk. And R and D is far from this.
9. What about air travel rules? This is hugely complicated, and international. Air travel had very few restrictions rules when it was initially created, and it was an absolute mess. You need a cohesive system

I could go on. As you are walking around or driving today, think of restrictions (traffic lights for an example). Would it better if traffic lights were all individually owned? How would they be coordinated?

Literally every law we have is reactionary. They were created when something goes wrong in a legislative vacuum, and people say ""well, we don't want that bad thing to happen again. Let's make a law."""
