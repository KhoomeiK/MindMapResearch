AskReddit,ffat97m,t1_ffap1m9,1579743960.0,Welcome to Capitalism.
AskReddit,ffajbwg,t1_ffag17d,1579737147.0,"Yeah that's my whole point. People's ignorance to the lack of amenities is exactly the goal of sites like Expedia. They show the cheapest flights first and that's what people buy. That's why baggage fees became a thing at the major airlines. They had to reduce the base ticket price so that it would show up next to Southwest and Spirit.

My point is the customer is always right. And the airline customers want cheap tickets, and the airlines are supplying them - at the cost of legroom and service quality. The public gets exactly what they ask for, then whines about it."
AskReddit,ffa1knt,t1_ffa0zy3,1579726038.0,"Yeah I'm referring specifically to the U.S.

Changi is owned by the government of Singapore. It's their gateway to the world and tourism is huge for them so obviously the airport gets a TON of money.

And furthermore Singapore airlines is government subsidized as well so they get all the money they need to keep ticket prices reasonable."
AskReddit,ff9e8k9,t3_esbeba,1579711112.0,"So as someone who works in the industry I feel like it is important to make everyone aware of an important fact:

Improvements to airports have a direct effect on airline ticket prices - as well as availability of flights.

Airports are businesses like any other. I would equate them most similarly to shopping malls. Like malls, tenants pay rent to the airport to occupy space to run their businesses. In the terminal this includes things like restaurants, stores, lounges, etc. These costs are passed on to the consumer (travelers). But this also applies to their aircraft gates. Airlines pay for ""gate space"" similarly to rent.

The big difference between a mall and an airport is there is a LOT more land area and infrastructure to maintain, so the ""rent"" from terminal kiosks and airlines doesn't come close to the amount required for upkeep and improvements. Some of this cost is offset by things like tolls and parking, but a large portion comes from what is called ""Passenger Facility Charges"" or PFCs. 

A PFC is a charge that is applied to every single ticket purchased on an airline flight. PFCs are relatively consistent charges and don't change often.

The reason for this is airlines are competing with each other constantly for business and as much as everyone likes to bitch about small seats and lack of amenities on airlines, it's a direct result of travelers constantly just going into sites like Expedia and booking the lowest fare. If Atlanta, for example, increased their PFC share, it would put Delta at a major disadvantage compared to AA & United. Obviously they can't do that, since Delta basically owns that airport.

Some airports are owned by the city, some airports by what's called an Airport Authority. City-owned airports can use taxes to fund improvements but as you can imagine, most people aren't frequent flyers and don't like paying extra taxes for a service they only use once or twice a year if that.

So the costs of improvements at smaller airports is very hard to manage, and many smaller-market cities are only serviced by one or two airlines. Increasing the cost to the airline can result in them reducing the number of flights or simply pulling service all together.

TL;DR: Better airport amenities would be great, but you'd better be ready to pay more for an airline ticket."

Huskers,ff6bduh,t1_ff6ajbj,1579623486.0,"Honestly I think it's the other way around. I think Adrian's slump was a result of the o-line. After the first few games of bad snaps and awful blocking, he never really established trust in his line. People like to point to the plays where the line actually did their job as evidence that it was all on Adrian, but that's fallacy At some point you just get it in your head that pressure will be coming every play and that lowers your ability to read plays and make quick decisions whether you've got time or not.

That and it's pretty likely he was playing hurt most of the season.

I think he's got a good shot at a bounce-back this year if he's back to 100% healthy and the line continues it's improvement."
