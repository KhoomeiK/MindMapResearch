Anxiety,ffnnto1,t3_eu3izb,1580068294.0,"That might be in the area of what some call catastrophic thinking. I know someone who has it really bad and I used to have it when I was younger. For me it just helps to try to change my perception and be more positive. Even if something bad happens, there are still at times lots of things for me to still be grateful and happy about."
bikecommuting,ffkdtm7,t3_etxlgr,1580021127.0,"I just had someone honking at me today and haven't had that happen for almost a month now. I live in a small town in which it's best to take the lane. For some reason they are more likely to drive super close to me when I ride near the sidewalk. Seems weird but I think it's almost easier for some to view you at a disadvantage and it's just easier for them to almost hit you that way.

When someone honks at me, I just take up even more of the lane. If they keep honking, then I go slower."
Anxiety,ffjco8u,t3_etw6jl,1579995501.0,"People are more likely to die from the flu. Generally about 56,000 die every year from it. Not to have people get down about the flu. And the news is hardly going to treat it other than some garbage to sensationalize which isn't helping. Some are also drawing a connection between this and how supposedly every hundred years around this time there is always an epidemic happening which is pretty silly."
CDrama,ffizjx2,t3_etugzg,1579986610.0,It's not a historical drama but maybe Inborn Pair? It's based in Taiwan and 84 episodes. I enjoyed it very much.
TheeOhSees,ffihmvq,t3_etokr5,1579974085.0,"Still deciding on whether to see them in Columbus, would be great to see them and Habibi."
KDRAMA,ffagqs9,t3_esagqr,1579735363.0,"I get this a little after every show is over. I usually have to wait a couple days until I start another show even though there is so much that I want to watch but getting right back into something takes me a moment. It's worse when I'm going over every aspect of the ending and hoping there were no loose ends, lol. 

It's so nice being able to just drop into such a nice world that a show is in and it's sad when it's over because there is usually nothing else like it again. I just ended My Sassy Girl and I loved it, two days later I started Reply 1997 and back to being happy-ish."
wintercycling,ffaft0t,t3_es34ho,1579734736.0,I was happy to see two people with their bikes a couple days ago on the coldest day of the year here so far.
MarcMaron,ff9xfg5,t3_es7z0k,1579723601.0,Kyle Field of Little Wings. Stuart Murdoch from Belle & Sebastian. Patti Smith.
socialanxiety,ff3czly,t3_erawyl,1579538671.0,"When I was younger I used to never move my arms and I used to be so ridiculously self-conscious and awkward when I did just start using my arms eventually. It's only now that I am finally comfortable with it but it took me so many years. No matter what kind of crap I am dealing with it's nice that I can just walk and not feel like such an awkward freak about it, lol.

And I never knew that others with SA had issues with walking too."
LPOTL,feu9kky,t3_eqdpn4,1579384478.0,I never knew Nichelle Nichols had a brother that was in Heaven's Gate and died that day. So trippy.
burgerrecords,fee5e3c,t3_eogixr,1579026748.0,Never heard of that show before but it looks like fun.
LifeProTips,fe00f5f,t3_en95u7,1578800080.0,I never thought of this. Now I'm not so afraid of maybe having a kid at some point because this would be my biggest fear.
IASIP,fdqripi,t1_fdqco9j,1578673329.0,I just saw that episode a couple days ago. Weird considering I haven't seen the show in years.
socialanxiety,fdnvxxk,t3_em1qd6,1578593940.0,Almost as bad as the time a teach literally called me out and wanted to question me in front of the whole class why I don't talk much. So bizarre and creepy in so many ways.
Fitness,fdke6ce,t3_elqte7,1578501968.0,I couldn't sleep last night and wasn't able to go to the gym this morning. I am exercising now at home but I only have dumbbells that go up to 25 lbs. I can hold a couple of them together but it's not the same as all the equipment at the gym. So I'm doing a kind of short arms workout today and another arms day tomorrow at the gym.
socialanxiety,fdc8xr8,t3_ekej18,1578269427.0,"People are always shocked when they speak to me first and I can carry an actual conversation, it weirds out some sometimes."
gamegrumps,fd6x1un,t3_ek5w0z,1578196793.0,I can see why Jennifer dumped him.
KDRAMA,fd6b6pn,t3_ek150e,1578188303.0,"I need to watch it again. It's the first asian drama I ever watched. Beginning the rabbit hole of asian drama's for me only because it had the word bong in it and I was like ""what's this?"" I like weed so it piqued my interest, lol."
amazon,fcybe9s,t3_ehksqu,1578077633.0,"Four day late but that is so Amazon so why not. Ordered something Sunday, they said it would arrive Friday. It's Friday and it just shipped today. Now it's coming Thursday. Six dollars for shipping and I wish Amazon had a better competitor already."
bicycling,fcxnnne,t1_fcw8eu8,1578067243.0,"Check and see if there are any bike co-ops of some sort in your area in which you can volunteer if you have the time to be able to get a bike or you could buy a refurbished bike and able to support them. If you're in a city, there is more of a chance of there being one."
Exercise,fcw9jhl,t3_ej1w85,1578020264.0,"I just got a treadmill and do 30 minutes every other day or so and it has made my leg muscles way more pronounced and very good for my joints which I didn't realize was much of an issue until I noticed how much better my legs move now. And I also bike and do other leg exercises but just walking has been so great. I do walk very fast though, almost to the point of running for the 30 minutes."
doctorwho,fcw9033,t3_ej3ko1,1578019906.0,So many good scenes but that one was especially funny.
mentalillness,fcvuyil,t3_ej4xls,1578010687.0,"What he is going through sounds like schizophrenia in some ways. Maybe the parts that are similar to bipolar disorder. And as sad as it is, people can change so much and lose a lot of the energy and interest in things from before. It could also be a combination of issues which is making things worse for him. 

I hope you're not drinking too much or that it's making you depressed. And no matter what, it's still good that you had good times with him and had nice experiences and moments with him."
bicycling,fcvr5g9,t3_ej5zjk,1578008231.0,Today I was chased by a dog for the first time this decade. So glad it happened around 6 a.m. and not so many drivers out yet because I probably would have gotten hit if it had happened later in the day.
schizophrenia,fcvq1fk,t3_ej0yj5,1578007517.0,Maybe just say you have anxiety issues. So many people do and there are so many types of anxiety and symptoms. And more people are aware and empathetic of anxiety these days.
Exercise,fct6jkt,t3_eipz0s,1577934179.0,"I've been going to the gym for more than a few years and I still don't know how to use some of the equipment. There is so much to use that it's easy to find enough things to do for an hour/hour and a half tops.

I also just started checking out youtube videos more recently and found out that I shouldn't be using some of the equipment, like some of the leg machines. Also if there is anything your curious about doing properly, there are definitely video's. My problem is I still don't know what most of the names of things are."
mentalhealth,fcsmzqf,t3_eilnsq,1577920046.0,"That is great that you can hang out with others who are drinking and still hold off from doing so. 

I haven't had any alcohol for a little over six months now and it's a nice change. I can hang out with people who are drinking and not even notice barely that they even are."

fitness30plus,fcsk26o,t3_eint0q,1577918135.0,Incorporate more supersets maybe.
schizophrenia,fcrcjjq,t3_eii943,1577899995.0,"Since the recent situation with your ex, it will take some time to be able to trust again but hopefully every day it gets slightly better and better until you can again.

I'm trying to do a new thing where I am aware of what it's like to be more balanced in a way or general, and anything that isn't, like being too negative or depressed, that I shouldn't put too much stock in it and realize it's okay for my mind to be that way but I am not going to put much faith in it regardless."
socialanxiety,fcr0emr,t3_eidgoy,1577894927.0,"Lol, one of my new year's resolutions is to look at people since I rarely ever do."
socialanxiety,fcqztbk,t3_eijs4b,1577894674.0,"I don't know how often you should visit or call your parents but hopefully you do every so often. When I live in another city away from my mother she would call me once a month but it was always her doing that and I never did and it made her feel like I didn't really want to talk to her because I wasn't making an effort to do so. I feel like for some of us, we feel like our parents must have things pretty together and like we maybe don't need to be looking out for them as much as they usually do for us but they need it too. 

I have a bunch of siblings and all of us are always coming and going, sometimes visiting for holidays and calling the parents, sometimes not and I can see now that it makes them feel bad at times."
mentalhealth,fcp2t3i,t3_eid55o,1577848732.0,"I feel it with myself and try not to give off negative, toxic vibes but I'm not that good at it."
socialanxiety,fcp2mn6,t3_eia3xj,1577848575.0,The only thing I like about NYE is watching Don Lemon get drunk.
RoadBikes,fcovuj2,t3_ehw3hg,1577842977.0,I miss biking around San Diego. Especially Balboa Park.
LifeProTips,fcovrso,t3_eiai3v,1577842916.0,"It could be worse, instead of being at home or alone, you could be working. Instead I am watching My Sassy Girl on Netflix so I pretty much win at NYE this year."
mentalhealth,fcovcdd,t3_eibd6w,1577842580.0,"Feeling alone sucks. One thing that helps me is to try to not have expectations about this in general. Just living in the moment in a way. I think I started doing that more because I would always feel bad if things didn't go really well with whatever situation I was planning on being a part of. 

I wish I had a cat, that must be nice. :)"
socialskills,fcouh5p,t3_ei8i4s,1577841888.0,I plan on going to sleep by ten or eleven. I like waking up extra early to exercise. I'm also not really feeling it with any of the holidays this year.

Exercise,fco6pn4,t3_ei39jp,1577825123.0,I have to exercise regularly for similar reasons. It really does help.
CDrama,fcn63o9,t3_ehzawc,1577804254.0,"I loved this show so much. It's also where I first found about Doraemon. At first I thought it was just a character for the show, lol."
socialanxiety,fck9hu6,t3_ehir4w,1577720186.0,"I'm not sure if I have it anymore but what has helped me is to make sure I get the sleep that I need, to exercise regularly, a good multi-B complex vitamin that I take daily, eating healthier, meditating, to not assume negative things about other people like that they don't like me, and to get out more and do things that I would usually shy away from. Especially that last one and it's okay if I'm awkward with it at first, doing it a second, third, or fourth time really gets me out of my shell and makes it easier."
socialanxiety,fc9ej1c,t3_egqha9,1577551466.0,Then fuck it. It happened.
socialanxiety,fc9efgl,t3_egq5a7,1577551421.0,This is the worst thing about social anxiety for me.
