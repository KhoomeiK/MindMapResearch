It was like building up the MONSTER Brock, instead of the ""wins because he is Brock"" all over again but in he space of a few minutes. You suddenly had ALL THIS GOD DAMNED POTENTIAL ENERGY BUILT UP! Not only that you had it built up onto a person that could EASILY hand it off and in no POSSIBLE way be damaged by it. As a matter of fact that was the only problem I had with it. They didn't actually hand it all off. To me they tried to protect Brock in the end needlessly. They may be thinking of saving the ""Payoff"" for a later date, but I think you could have explained that away incredibly easily by saying Brock had just taken on almost 20 fucking people! You didn't need the low blow as well. It felt like it at the very least cut all the momentum in half. 



On the Keith and MONSTER! Lee feels like a legit monster/ freak now and suddenly We have a real monster among men again. They somehow went in and booked it right where they all three seemed like fucking equals in the ring! THEY ONLY WENT AND FUCKING DID IT! Brock didn't beat them. Instead he took advantage of them distracting each other and tossed them over and even that didn't look easy for him. People talk a lot of shit about Brock but there has NEVER and I mean it, been a ""monster"" that sells for his opponents as much and as well as Brock does. I don't feel like it is Brock's fault that Vince is the way he is. Brock happens to be the biggest sweatiest peace of meat out there so Vince has the biggest hard-on for him.

They had spent the last 3 years a devout follower of the trump church if I was trying to explain it. They were basically indoctrinated.



How the conversations over the last few years went; they would just comment on something in the news or a commercial or something like that in the world in a catch phrase straight out of the republican brainwashing handbook. Instead of saying anything attacking that or directly opposing it, I would offer something up like ""on the other hand, a x-mile stretch of wall was already built and cost $x already. This also doesn't actually deter any of the criminal activity that 'we' are aiming to prevent. Instead it just pushes it to where they are the only way to cross and they are instead even more out of sight out of mind so even less funds and resources can be used for preventing problems imo."" just a random example from a recent conversation I could remember. I had exact numbers for X then but don't remember off the top of my head atm.

It finally fucking clicked. It was actually sad. They had spent this entire time muttering under their breath about ""them"" and how we needed to make America great again etc. It worked.


At no point did I try and hard confront this person just always soft and conversational as I could be and as much as I could not make it super obvious I wasn't on an opposing side to them ideologically. We are family after all. I constantly just offered up a devils advocate kind of point here or there. Just my points instead always seemed to make a lot of sense and I tried to never attached any political party or anything to them. It literally took 3 years. From when they latched onto this bandwagon for seemingly comfort, to just about a week and a half ago.


It clicked for themselves and it was sad. I saw it in their eyes they realized. They talked to me about it and they almost seemed to reject it as it he had become this and wasn't always this way. So in that sense it is still dangerous. It's like they detached it from the rest of the party."

Just how hate-able a person she evidently is that they have been able to drag out using her as a catch all and just frothing the mouths of their base into pure rage over her. Literally at lunch YESTERDAY I heard an old man say ""he'll probably get a lot of votes too. I should just go vote twice like a Democrat!"" It was in response to an ad for a candidate. The guy had seemed to agree with EVERYTHING being said in the ad right up till the end where it said the candidate's  name and then the ""dreaded D"" popped up. Listing a few things he literally was making noises of agreement the whole commercial about; draining corporate swamp, lowering middle class tax burden, better social security protections and aid, never having taken a single dollar from special interests, for family values (man literally said out loud ""bout time""), fighting for the people he will represent not the billionaires on Wall Street. To every single one he grunted approval and as I said to one spoke literal approval. Then the Dem pops up and he says he might even have to vote twice like a Dem to keep him from winning. 



Now I am not leaving the name of the candidate off to keep from pushing him or anything. I'm leaving it off because before the ad I had never heard of him and after I don't remember him.

The very same feelings I was afraid of before, but the magnitude is just so much higher that it can't even be compared. I dare not even attempt to imagine. For you having been forced to go through this... I wish you happiness in whatever you do and I wish I could give you a hug. Just a good hard hug. 

I seem to say pretty often ""I hate people"". I seldom realize that in reality I do now. I hate what people are capable of doing to each other. To children and their families for fuck sake. Evil only exists because humans exist. Our ability to either dehumanize each other or actually carry out such acts knowingly is something I will never understand it seems.

If you jumo to that then you only have two levels of selling a move.

Some kind of disconnect. I didn't make the connection to that disconnect until getting more into some British panel shows. American shows and comedies pushed for more diversity about the same time if not a little earlier. (I'd argue earlier and that is why I viewed the lack of women as meh on British shows... Hold on I'll explain) The women that got pushed in American TV largely were NOT ready or not the right ones or just plain out of their depth. 



It was like they were purposely pushing less talented women to damage their image looking back at it with a conspiracy theory glasses view. I mean probably not. They were probably just in a massive rush to push women for ratings. This contrast though just made it obvious that the women that were on a show were there because they were women. Then when I started seeing women on panel shows on British TV I  never had that thought. I didn't always like their comedy, like Aisling B for example I just don't like her comedy most of the time but loved her on Taskmaster... different settings different results. Even not liking her comedy I didn't think ""she was pushed here because she was a woman"". I instead only thought I just didn't like her style, just like I thought when I didn't like any man's style. The difference is the women that got to the top in British TV are all talented and have substance it seems. 





Now the negative trend has largely righted itself in American comedy I'd say... not completely, but getting there, but British TV started off with their best showing. It was almost weird to see how they just went yup let's do it right. Of course not ignoring the obvious history there, but when the conscious effort was finally made."
panelshow,fdgl4xl,t1_fdffsc8,1578400993.0,"There are or were some panel show formats where less ""in your face"" characters could shine. Some of those thrived on basically making people taking their turns to talk or act. In sorta the style I'd offer up Taskmaster. Some of the funniest people are still the quieter and less well known comedians that I've watched on there. They get their chance to shine as much as the others and it shows. Doesn't hurt that Little Alex Horne and Greg's Dynamic is possibly one of my favorites in all of tv history. They really do a great job of highlighting funny moments of the comedians, and to date it seems the comedians that have been willing to go on have gotten that the making fun is just that, fun. That is to their benefit."

Something like that and establish that it was to make a name for the creator and then you come out with limited runs where people are more inclined to think they are the genuine article and you can either do the auction thing like you said HxH style, or demand higher and higher prices."
