rundisney,ff9ztqh,t3_esgp76,1579725013.0,"I’ll chime in. I love rDisney. I have been racing for over 10 years on both coasts. I have done every challenge multiple times. There has been a steady decline in the quality of the race courses. The courses used to be filled with more characters and human entertainment and spent more time in the parks. They used to be much more varied. Now many of them have the same route. Things like Everest Challenge, Tower of Terror 10 miler, nighttime Wine and Dine were all cool and I miss them. The pre race communication used to be much better and the shirt quality was better as well. You could also change corrals if you had a good reason. It is much harder to do that now. Other than that, however, I find the start line much more organized with more offerings like food and drinks to purchase, the expo faster to get through, merchandise tents at the finish and the medal quality equally as good if not better than in the past.  The bulk of the experience is the same. 

I also skipped this year to do another marathon, which I enjoyed just as much. But I will continue to go back and race at Disney because I love the parks, Already planning on Dopey again next year. I love the races, and I understand that they are huge and can only do so much. Would I like more food at the finish, sure. But Chicago, New York, Boston, all rush you out of the finish chute with a box or bag of food and you are on your own. Boston and NY and LA have busses and very early pick up times. So not much different. Big races are informal. That’s just the way it is.

My wish is for Disney to just to be more creative and spend more money on human entertainment like in the past. Add a bit more magic to the race course experience.

Keep Calm and keep running :)"
AskReddit,ff80ltt,t1_ff80foc,1579662884.0,"yeah, obviously there are way worse things in life to deal with, but it's annoying. Particularly cause I wore contacts for 10 years and then could no longer wear them. And Lasik will only fix the nearsightedness , so even if I got it, I would have to wear reading glasses. oh well at least I'm healthy otherwise."
AskReddit,ff7zztt,t1_ff7zaz9,1579662440.0,"So, I was near sighted for years. I wore normal glasses to correct it. -1.50 at the worst so nothing too crazy. Then as I got older my near vision started getting worse an worse to the point that i couldn't read my phone or stuff up close. As you age the lens in your eye gets thicker and can't focus on close up objects. I wear glasses that correct for my nearsightedness up top an the presbyopia on the bottom. Essentially a bifocal but with no line, The prescription just progresses from bottom to top. It can be annoying since the middle area is challenging. You need to tilt your head a bit up or down to get a good focus. The sides are a little warped too."

I would say they are at least as big as LA. Still, Revel Races, Rock and Roll, most Ironman races, and even the Salt lake marathon. I can list a ton of races where there is plenty of swag to purchase. I know that Disney attracts crazy people (the kind who would wait 5 hours for a popcorn bucket), but it alway seems like they run out of the same merchandise at every race and have loads of other crap that nobody buys, which you can then get at the outlets on I drive. Seems like they should be able to do better at forecasting demand for the simple race apparel in standard sizes. I noticed the last few years they had apparel for sale at the race start and finish, which I think is step in the right direction. Keeps away all the ebay sellers. Anyway, that's the least of my issues since I don't buy anything anyway."
