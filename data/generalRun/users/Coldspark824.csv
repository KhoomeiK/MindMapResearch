edit: i'm gonna update this with constructive feedback, starting harsh, then getting more helpful-

1) anatomy. Her left leg, The fact that you made her waist so small in contrast to her massive bazonga boobs makes her look like she's emaciated.

2) shading: a realistic stomach but anime face mismatch, smooth shading on her body, but then linework on her face and hands, you have light coming from different places on her skin than on her clothes which suggests A) you drew her naked first and then B) drew clothes overtop with different lighting for ??? reasons.

\-----------

Ok, positive things:  The color is nice and blended smoothly, but in places where you went in with a tiny brush and detailed her bellybutton roll, for example, makes this strange contrast in level of detail. You should try to make the level of detail consistent.   


Design wise, she's kind of on point, she's got the right clothes, right colors, right hairstyle, but you put so much time into those things and none into her face. That's not tifa's face.

Carefully look at where shadows and lighting highlights are and try to make them match. It might also help to change the color of the lighting slightly so she's not just lit grey. Especially also the fact that there's a highlight on her inner thighs like you've stuck a grey flourescent bulb under her skirt."
