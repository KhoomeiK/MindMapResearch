GrowingMarijuana,ff40r7b,t1_ff3melp,1579553034.0,I didn’t know it controlled the high that much but I have heard that the more amber they are the more cbd it has in it and less thc so it makes sense how potent you goes down.

GrowingMarijuana,fejzd2x,t3_epkmm7,1579189278.0,I don’t know much about growing but looks like while those stems were young potentially they got damaged leading to them to grow like that. Otherwise maybe a Nute it bug infestation?

facepalm,fejlu99,t1_fejlm73,1579179262.0,But to my friend... anything is possible through god and scientific observation is the devils work so please explain to me how to get that through to him.
facepalm,fej7wx5,t1_fej2p7s,1579160681.0,"Well... idk how that’s possible. But from what my friend has argued over and over he’s not “100% confident if the earth is flat, but it’s definelty not round” and gravity is caused by the disc world thingy floating up through space. But... he also believes the world has a dome over it and there’s nothing outside of the dome yet he doesn’t understand how those contradict eachother.

He also believes nasa is created by Satan and all other major forms of science were created by Satan to deceive us from believing in god. And he believes anyone who says the earth isn’t flat and is famous is just a shill who doesn’t believe the earth is round but wants to devote their lives to Satan to deceive us."
facepalm,feitmq9,t1_feihb4k,1579146895.0,"I have a friend who believes the earth is flat anytime I try to bring logic and facts he’ll usually cause an hour long argument with him essentially calling me a sheep for not being a free thinker, even though I argue him sometimes just using common sense."
