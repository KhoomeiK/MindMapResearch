SpideyMeme,feiz60g,t1_feixzpe,1579151363.0,"It is still possible to acknowledge the positive influence Uncle Ben had on Peter Parker without retreading his death.

Ben Parker is still a very important character that instilled in his nephew a sense of responsibility and moral compass long before Peter was bitten by that radioactive spider. It is that same sense of responsibility and moral compass that drives Peter to go out and risk his life fighting crime and saving lives as Spider-Man every day.

If the MCU thinks they can just sweep such an integral part of Marvel Comics' most famous superhero under the rug like they're trying to do now, it would be a major disservice to the character."

SpideyMeme,feholfy,t1_fehg48t,1579120757.0,"the character of Uncle Ben in the MCU deserves more than a suitcase that got destroyed off-screen (which, by the way, doesn't seem to have any emotional impact on Peter Parker at all)"
Spiderman,fehnwhl,t1_fehkzmy,1579120357.0,"You make a fair point. I personally don't know how they're gonna fix the constructive criticisms in the coming movies, but then again, I'm not a professional Hollywood writer. I just love Spider-Man and get really frustrated when they're consistently knocking it out of the park in terms of his character in the video games, animations, cartoons, and comics, but not in the MCU movies, which is arguably the biggest point of introduction to most people."
Spiderman,fehid8d,t1_fehcz2l,1579117150.0,"If Marvel wanted to outright replace Uncle Ben (who is such an integral part of the Spider-Man mythos) with Tony Stark, they have every creative right to to that, but that’s not what they did.

They kept Ben Parker in the MCU as evidenced by Peter maintaining the belief that “when you can do what [he] can, and you don’t. And then the bad things happen, they happened because of you.” (Which is such a contrived way of saying ‘with great power comes great responsibility’) LONG before Tony Stark even knew about the kid. That belief could’ve only been fostered by 2 loving parental figures like Aunt May and Uncle Ben, not Tony Stark who gave a 15 year old a high-tech, weaponized, easily hackable suit (that he only took away after Peter caused a public scene at the ferry) and not to mention literal death.

The other most “obvious” way I know Uncle Ben was in the MCU is the suitcase in Far From Home with Ben Parker’s initials on it. The one thing we’re shown belonging to Ben Parker in the MCU and what happens to it? It gets destroyed off-screen showing apparently no emotional impact on Peter whatsoever.

Tony Stark can be influential to Peter, but when the MCU does stuff like this, it tells me that they think Uncle Ben was less of an influence on Peter than Tony Stark is which is a MAJOR disservice to the character in the highest degree. I am hoping, PRAYING, that these gripes are addressed and fixed in the coming movies, but for now, Uncle Ben deserves more than what the MCU is doing to him now."
