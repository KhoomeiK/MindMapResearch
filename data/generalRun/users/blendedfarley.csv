I never did this. 

Someone used a personal anecdote to try to argue that people need to lock their doors. I asked a question to illuminate the fact that outside of their anecdote most people never need to worry about such situations.

>And to pretend that home invasion is something that is irrational is itself irrational.

Pretend that **home invasion** is irrational? What the hell are you talking about? I don't think you're equipped to have this conversation, buddy. Be safe, it's a scary world for people like you."
news,ff7bdkk,t1_ff73s7i,1579645449.0,"Why did you bother bringing up a personal story if your point is that you think no one needs such a story?

No, for almost all people in the US there aren't these these people. No one is trying to launch a home invasion against then.

It's really frustrating that you went through that whole story just to pivot to an entirely different point the second your first one was investigated."

I have no problem answering the question you just asked... but not if you ignore the one I just asked."

Nice talking with you buddy"
news,ff6thbh,t1_ff6sz5m,1579634545.0,"Cool, so we agree.

Would you agree that most people don't have a Steve or anything functionally identical to Steve?"
news,ff6se8f,t1_ff6rmeq,1579633899.0,"I didn't read right.

After you take your gratification from my mistake you can read my actual question.

If Steve were to no longer be a risk for home invasion, would you be **equally justified** in locking your doors?

To me the answer is no, you would be less justified."
news,ff6ruee,t1_ff6r1gq,1579633565.0,"Yeah I'm not a fan of Steve.

If you **knew** tomorrow that Steve was no longer an issue would you still be equally justified in locking your doors?"
worldnews,ff6qiyd,t1_ff6q8co,1579632780.0,"Man I actually feel bad for putting so much effort trying to explain the concepts now that you've effectively ignored them.

I'm happy that you can ride your bike, dude."
news,ff6q9ek,t1_ff6pu3i,1579632624.0,"Steve, the guy you mentioned, is the only person who has tried to enter your house right? You used your story to illustrate rational locking of doors.

I'm asking you without that person are you **equally** justified in locking your doors?

Now, you can say it isn't equally rational and still think you should lock your doors. There is no reason not to answer yes or no. I'm not here to do ""gotcha"" questions. I personally do irrational shit *daily,* including locking my door."
