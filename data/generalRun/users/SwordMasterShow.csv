I was confused because you were getting so angry at them asking a question, a question I didn't see any malice or anti-vaxx sentiment in, but I see why you found that sentiment. I saw it as just someone who had that experience and was curious about what others think, and tbh it probably would be more helpful for the cause of vaccination to just tell them the facts. If they ask for opinions, better they hear the factual safe ones than the bs dangerous ones."

dankchristianmemes,fc4qfh6,t1_fc4j8vz,1577424688.0,"Ok I'm not trying to be antagonistic with this, this is a genuine question for you because I'm curious. If the Bible is as you say mostly just stories of how to live a good life to please god, what makes you believe in God and not just live by those good stories? God and the benefits/consequences of belief and nonbelief are self-contained in the Bible, while the stories apply to life. I suppose I'm asking why you believe, which I know is a big question. But what makes you trust the Bible's layout of the existence of god and what happens if you don't have faith in him, over any other similar self-contained religion with good morals?"
