If they are actually struggling with their sexuality then I'd be more than happy to talk to them about it, but I doubt that will happen. I feel adding the ""I"" to the beginning of the community is just another jab at the community as a whole. I have a feeling they are just making fun of the lgbtq+ and being homophobic (like they normally are) so I dont think they count themselves as LGBTQ but more they want to jab the community for the 100th time (if that makes sense)"

IncelTears,feltrut,t1_felm4vt,1579230738.0,"When I say they are gay for Chad I'm am too not joking. You made a very good point with struggling with your sexual identity.

I have heard multiple stories of internalized homophobia with closeted gay men and women, and frankly anyone in the community. 

That being said though, I have never seen a more toxic community that are incels. I can clearly see that most of them are struggling with severe mental health issues and are more than likely in denial about being mentally I'll. 

I have way more knowledge about being mentally ill than I do about internalized homophobia (I have bipolar 2) before medication I was a very VERY toxic person. I said racial slurs i watched things on the internet that i wish i didnt. I was rude to a lot of people, just like these incels are. 

I feel that ""incel"" for these people isnt being involuntary celibate, but more of a group for hating everyone and everything. These people are obviously going through some shit and are not realizing that their behavior isnt normal and they actually need treatment/ help

So I feel the issue stems deeper than them not wanting to be gay or are in denial about being gay, but it's more that these people are in involved in a toxic community and are surrounding themselves with disgusting people and this is worsening their mental health."
