AskReddit,ffh6pft,t1_ffh5r93,1579924633.0,Being constantly hungry is pretty bad. Being abused by a loved one sucks. Being tortured is even worse. The holocaust was a fuck of a bad time. The Black Plague sure was a bitch. But nothing....*nothing* is worse than wet socks.
AskReddit,ffh43mu,t3_etlans,1579922574.0,"My grandmother was in the process of dying. She had dementia, and most days did not know where she was, or who I was. 
Her last lucid moment was with me. She said “I know I’ve been going and coming back. I know I’m going to go soon, and not come back. I hope everyone knows how much I love them.”"
AskReddit,ffh3uv3,t3_etlasm,1579922384.0,"Depends on the club. Look around. Is everyone younger than you? 
There are clubs that are full of people in their 30s. Other clubs, 40s. 50s, not so much. 
So I guess the real answer is 50, but again, it depends heavily on the club."
AskReddit,ffh3phj,t3_etlb3t,1579922271.0,"Accept the rejection. 
Imagine someone who likes you. You think they’re a good person, and they’re not ugly or creepy, but you’re just not attracted to them like that. They’re just not your type. 
Odds are, that’s how this dude feels. It’s just not clicking for him. The attraction may not be there. 
Accept this, and accept that it may happen many times."

AskReddit,ffglo9r,t1_ffgjebg,1579909118.0,"Well, empathy is a sensory perception, whereas compassion is an emotional reaction to that perception. So empathy =yes. HSPs tend to be more empathetic. Compassionate = probably, but it depends on the individual’s personality."
AskReddit,ffggq18,t3_eth957,1579905849.0,"Being physiologically less sensitive to the people around me. Like many introverts, I am also a Highly Sensitive Person (HSP). HSPs have a very high-strength “social antenna,” and are more highly sensitive to verbal and non-verbal cues such as tone, body language and facial expressions. Most people are able to pick up on these cues to some degree, but introverts and HSPs tend to be overloaded by these subtle social signals, particularly in crowded places."
