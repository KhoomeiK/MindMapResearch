>Remember that the US election isn’t between individual people. It’s between two systems. One system holds the traditional values of Western Civilization.

This is a deception. The values being espoused by Trump, in his actions and words, are not the traditional values of Western Civilization. Nor are they those of Christianity (thought some are). And liberals, flawed though they are, esposue some Christian values too. To pretend that the right espouses Christian ideals while the left espouses antiChristian ideas is nonsense. Both sides espouse some and deny others.

The connection between my political views and my biblical convictions is not straightforward. The connection between the bible and my moral views is strong and clear, but our laws do not exist to enforce moral behavior, though they are informed by it. We don't criminalize adultury, nor should we. We don't criminalize lying (in general, certainly we do in specific circumstances) nor should we. The purpose of our government is not to make people moral. It is to protect people from immoral actors to some degree, and to facilitate a society which further good ends for all. At least, that's how I see it. 

How my moral views affect the manner in which we achieve those goals varies depending on the specific issue and even on the current state and opinions of the society in which we live. The moral issues conservatives have with the liberal side are very valid; but in many cases, legislation is not the way to fix it (thought it is in some). 

At the same time, the critiques of the actions of Trump and some of the republicans surrounding him seem to me to be valid, and reveal a serious flaw in Trump and at least some of the leading republicans. These moral failings (informed by my biblical convictions) on their part are very serious in my eyes. 

Then, there are other questions, like what economic system is most effective at creating a good society? One which is moral and which has plenty for all? This is not relaly a moral question and so not strongly tied to my biblical views.

it's important that your SO be really on board with this though. You say you don't know where you're going. Is your SO up for moving with you? Will they find work, work that they want to do, when they do move? It's good that you'll have lots paid for already, but your SO will still have to pay for lots of things on their salary alone. 

How long will you take off when they are born? Is it worth waiting until after that point to start? You probably won't be able to give birth and take classes the same semester (maybe you could, but it's probably a bad idea). Will that set you back? Then maybe wait a year. But maybe it will be in the summer, or maybe you can take summer classes to make up for that semester. Are you okay with a lot of daycare from an early age? Or do you have family to help a lot? 

Groupwork may be difficult. Make sure you're upfront, and fair, with your group mates since you will be working on different schedules and some won't like that (and some will be great).

Now, I am all for open access for publically funded research, but in my field the public isn't going to read it anyway, so it's not so urgent as in other fields.
