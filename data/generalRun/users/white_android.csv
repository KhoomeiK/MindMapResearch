As for the questions about the new kit, I have no idea and it's sort of what I've been wondering since the product details say that some can't be cut and combined which would make me think that they also wouldn't work combined to another pair...

The main difference between hemp and weed is THC content. Hemp has so little THC content that you could smoke it all day and you aren't going to get high. It's historically always been that way. 

Weed however is all the cannabis that has a higher THC content. 


Other than that there's no difference other than what we call them. 


If you want more of an explanation, maybe research it. Because despite the name differences they're the same plant."
