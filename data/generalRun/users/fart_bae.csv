Sacramento,feiindm,t3_elutho,1579139407.0,"I personally know Charlene Jones and people like her deserve the chance to have a place to call home. She took in other people's kids that needed help and hussled to make sure all of them got to school on time. It amazed me how much she fought for those kids to have a good upbringing. She fell on hard times that set her back financially, but she always finds a way to find the good in things."
SanJose,feidkxs,t3_ep9l31,1579136019.0,"There is a monthly San Jose Skate Night that is super fun. They are having a fundraiser downtown next week at Pizza Flora if you want to find out more on the club. 
There is a meetup group called Biocurious that has a great group of really talented and smart people. There are various projects you can choose from and i personally like their cuttlefish project.  
Star parties all over SJ on the weekends if you are into astronomy.
There is so much to do in SJ, but you have to try some more out. I personally don't have the time to do events like these antmore, but i have done them in the past and had a really fun time. 
Best of luck to you!"
todayilearned,feicv7y,t1_fehgbqm,1579135538.0," It is great to pick a few things to be conscious about and not take on all of the worlds problems, but some people get sucked into this need to be pure and get a little overboard with it."
todayilearned,fehczkz,t1_fegn6r7,1579114012.0,"That was a weird response, so i am going to assume you interpreted my explanation completely different than what i intended. I wasn't trying to make any point on common ancestry, but rather expand on what you were saying. I still don't understand what you mean by vestigial gills, unless you mean morphologically in evolution , and not embryonic development."
todayilearned,fehcglm,t1_fegsetx,1579113711.0,I wanted to slap my friend when he started bursting my coconut milk bubble saying that the palm fruit industry is destroying forests.
todayilearned,feg3x2e,t1_feeyd8c,1579075796.0,I think its more because apple seeds are extremely heterozygotic. Sexual reproduction just contributes to genetic diversity in general. Even self pollinating plants can produce a genetically different offspring through independent reassortment. Apples just take it to an extreme level to mutate quickly
todayilearned,feg3fsu,t1_fefcm07,1579075205.0,"You are sorta right, and i see the point you are making, but there is way more to it. In human embryonic development, the pharyngeal arches (not gill slits) dont dissolve. All vertebrate embryos have pharyngeal arches, among other structures. The arches are transformed and important in making so many parts of the human body based on hox genes. ""Gill slits"" is a misleading term that a lot of science articles will use, but it is deceptive because embryos do not have gills and there is no slit. I just took a zoology class that covered this in detail. I am an evolutionary biology student and still learning this myself."

todayilearned,fdlzdr7,t1_fdl0fo0,1578536134.0,"I think modern rape cases have more evidence such as rape kits and also any electronic evidence. I think if a lot of people are saying the same thing, then it is most likely true. This was also seen with the Michael Jackson allegations, but i dont know enough to say definitively that he was a pedophile or not. The victim in the Ali allegations has a great source of evidence, the alleged son, so i really do hope that someone in Ali's family does a 23andme some day and hopefully Ali's legacy can face public backlash for his crimes.
The #metoo means something personal to me, so i dont take rape lightly. I wish every day that my rapist got justice, but i wasn't believed."
todayilearned,fdkngpx,t1_fdjiiar,1578507223.0,"Yes, but when making a definitive claim, you have to have facts to point to. If you dont have facts, then you need to make a claim that supports a level of uncertainty such as, ""Ali was most likely a pedophile"" and not ""Ali was a pedophile""."
todayilearned,fdkmxnk,t1_fdjioam,1578506900.0,"I understand what she said was reported, but claiming someone did something doesn't make it true. She has no physical evidence unless her son gets a DNA test. I hope with the technology we have today that the son can get tested to give his mom the credit she deserves, if what she says is true. 
I am not defending Ali, in fact,  i think he did have sex with underaged girls. I am just trying to be fair to everyone in this specific situation that is void of speculation and opinion when making definitive claims."
todayilearned,fdkmdzc,t1_fdjz7dc,1578506560.0,"I live in the south bay and 2017 was the year where it was 100+ degrees inside our apt. Our apartment was on the top floor and facing southeast with direct sun. We eventually bought a $700 non-energy efficient portable AC unit, but it only worked slightly if you sat near it.  We thought an evaporative window unit wouldnt be an issue since they are popular for older buildings and energy efficient, but they refused and gave us no reasoning for their decision."
todayilearned,fdjmpo5,t1_fddbx2w,1578478351.0,"We had to move from an apartment in the bay area because they would not allow us to have a window ac and the building was not properly insulated. I suffered heat exhaustion and on the hottest days we had to drive us and our cats 2 hours away to stay with my parents until the heat wave passed. We could not live in our own apartment and paying $1900/month. I am still wondering if i could have sued over that, but the laws need to catch up to make AC just as much a right as heating."

todayilearned,fdjicer,t1_fdji4s7,1578472140.0,"It may be because these were allegations and not proven in court. I am not saying you are wrong, but people want facts to back up claims like this"
todayilearned,fdjggm9,t3_elowuq,1578469741.0,"I have heard that probiotic supplements do not increase a healthy gut biome because biome is very specific to each person based on diet, enviroment, and genetics. Also, most probiotics are full of microbes that do not thrive in human stomachs and die off quickly. The best way to replenish your biome is to fecal teansplant with someone in your house who is related to you. Fecal transplants from anonymous donors are more for introducing microbes that have positive effects on mood stimulation. Most serotonin signals are produced by the gut, and not by the brain.
P.s.- biologist student and not a doctor or neuroscientist. I just really like this kind of stuff and find it fascinating that we hold a microcosm within us"
