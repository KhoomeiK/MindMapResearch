personalfinance,ff9rd50,t1_ff9r7qn,1579719415.0,It always says 21 days from the received date which is cool but I think that's more so a guideline... they normally process in batches right? So I was wondering if anybody knew something I didn't

My federal refund has been showing up on the IRS refund tracker website as ""Received"" which is the same as accepted. 

It takes some time to go from Received (Accepted) to approved. That's what I'm waiting for.

Just got an email that my state was accepted today 1/22.

So yes, my return has been accepted (sans 1 state refund)"

theLword,fei8zxd,t1_fe075ij,1579132963.0,"Yea exactly. I'm gonna toot my own horn here a little lol but I'm pretty feminine presenting with a little edginess & I feel like I get lusted over.

A girl in my dorm told everybody she might be bisexual and she really wanted to experiment with me. (I was in the art/*gay*dorm) anyways I saw her at a frat & she invited me upstairs, was being super accommodating & we had sex. Afterwards she wanted to keep hooking up.

I've had a ""straight"" girl all over me w/o knowing my sexuality (we actually hooked up & everytime she saw me, shed get all giggly and girly.

Another time, some girl told me the way I was looking at her was driving her crazy.

I was at a college party and went into the bathroom w a mutual ""straight"" friend to just use the bathroom & she just goes ""OMG I WANT YOU SO MUCH"" and she pushes me against the wall and tried to stick her hands down my pants & make out with me lol then apologized profusely ahhh awkward times.

One time I was out at a bar and in the bathroom, I tell this girl I really like her dress. The girl steps into the stall then she comes out and looks at me very seductively and asks me to untie her dress for her. I brushed it off but my friends were like WTF WAS THAT. Eventually that girl and I ended up dancing together and making out lol.

One of my really good ""friends"" (that I'm in love with lol) she actually came on to me. She literally texted me ""I want to kiss you"" while we were hanging out together at a comedy club w some comedians.

I'm also on the internet a lot and girls would randomly Snapchat me nudes lol, or send me anonymous submissions about how they wanna try stuff w me.

Idk wtf it is. I'm 4'11. I think I'm attractive. I'm dorky & goofy and really more on the feminine side. Yet I feel like I've had some Shane moments. Most of the more masculine presenting girls are chasing most of the time.

BoJackHorseman,fdz2fyt,t3_en9r52,1578785978.0,"Bojack is not only a great show due to its nuances, continuity (if something is mentioned, it is NEVER forgot), and humor but also just wow the characters. You'll be deep in an episode, entertained, then something happens and you are forced to think about it past the surface level. And you start thinking about yourself, and who you are, and who the characters are, and why anything matters at all. I relate with Bojack and Diane the most and I'm on my third rewatch and for some reason I'm just noticing how they are alike even though they manifest in different ways (I just really shipped them at first so perhaps I was blinded)

Piece of shit is one of my fav episodes. Jesus yes. The episodes after are also amazing. Bojack has no biases. Life isn't fair, you can have it all or nothing at all. You are you and nothing can change that. I wish I can remember the first time I watched or why... I just know I wasn't ready for what it became:

It's political, it's a comedy, it touches on emotions and ego, I LOVE this show."
