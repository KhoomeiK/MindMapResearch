If you haven't already, find a university calendar online and see if the ""break"" for university employees ended last week, before classes started.   


But that is just a guess on my part. As others have said, try not to beat yourself up over it. From the email exchange you had last week, it certainly does sound as if you were not expected to be in the lab until this week.
