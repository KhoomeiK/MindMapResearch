Not only that but I have to keep up pretty high levels of exercise just to maintain this physique and not enjoy food on top of that. Bleh"

EDAnonymous,feqrd7o,t3_eqerff,1579345142.0,I come here for motivation to not eat (I am at a somewhat healthy deficit) and also because food and eating or not eating is in my mind 90% of the day and this sub seems to relate best to that.
EDAnonymous,fepf12b,t3_eqb1b4,1579318874.0,Up your calories. Eat fats to stay satiated. Portion food out and gtfo of the kitchen. I usually binge when my cut is too low. I feel I can recommend this because it is in line with harm reduction as well as your goal
EDAnonymous,fep4vdl,t3_eq7czn,1579312180.0,"Very self conscious guy here. Been to many many gyms. Busy and empty alike. No one cares what you're doing. Wear headphones. Sometimes I take preworkout as a commitment because once that kicks in I basically have to exercise and can't chicken out if the parking lot is kind of full that day.

And also just force yourself to go. You'll see it's no big deal and it gets easier"
Music,feo96wc,t1_fenwnzb,1579296757.0,"Because I go to eminem for bangers to lift to and this record didn't have my head nodding or make me smile with funny metaphors. I disagree with him politically on guns so the shooting song was a huge turn off. Loved kamikaze just for the record.

Honestly I'm glad if everyone else liked it. I was in the minority enjoying the new kanye album. People like what they like."

If people can't exist in the world using media platforms without reading something that may sadden them or send them into a downward spiral then it's on them to stay off, which to this person's credit they did.

EdAnonymousAdults,fddf4wv,t1_fddd3ws,1578309441.0,Totally the same. I portion the nuts and bring them to work or living room. If I don't weigh them out and separate myself from them the nuts are all but gone.
EdAnonymousAdults,fddci9d,t3_eknkw4,1578305632.0,"I add salt to my black tea. I eat a ton of pickles. I also salt the hell out of my food. All of these have helped me with my low calorie diet. 

Oh and to help with my bingeing I spread a bit more fat intake in the form of almonds throughout the day to feel satiated, that has helped more than anything to stick to a deficit. I did raise my absurdly low deficit cut a bit to accommodate the almonds, but a cut I can stick to vs one i break bad and binge on every few days is a no brainer."

Don't get me wrong, bringing your own food is probably weird but the people in my life must love me more than their level of discomfort for my strange behavior. I think my food obsession has become almost a personality quirk to them. Good luck!"
