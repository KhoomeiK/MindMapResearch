His lawyers advised that they would bury him deep, deep, underground and to drop it, so he really didn’t make any money out of it. 

Now he could probably buy the entire company himself though."

The movie was a success. A giant one. I don’t know why people hate it so much."
movies,fdpsjph,t1_fdpcn3c,1578638813.0,"This is the weirdest opinion. “No lasting impact”?  Marvel has done what no one has ever done in the history of media. They made 82748723 movies in 10 years without a single box office flop that all tied nicely together and culminated in a two year, two film box office nuclear explosion that will probably never be replicated again in our lifetimes. They have changed the way that people make movies now. Everything is a shared universe with 90283 movies planned that all tie together. And, if you notice, not a single other studio has done this successfully.  

To say that Disney and Marvel will have no lasting impact beyond initial box office receipts is absurd on its head. They have theme parks and a fucking tv studio. Every other big studio has tried to replicate their success and failed disastrously.  Disney can’t even replicate it themselves with fucking Star Wars."

Part of the advice is that you’re supposed to “peacock”, or look extra special and spiffy compared to other men (your competition). 

He took the “losers” that were contestants on the show and then they all had to do ridiculous things like wear leather pants, loud flashy silk shirts, top hats, gold jewelry, 9 rings, ear and eyebrow piercings, fancy shoes, etc.  basically they had to be “fashionable” but only if your frame of reference was a club in Germany in 1996. They all looked so, so terrible."

Did we forget about whatshername, the person whose only purpose in the movie was to make you forget about that asian one and to ensure that you knew that finn and Poe were NOT GAY (all caps!). Just like female Poe was created so you knew, FOR SURE, that JJ abrams did not make them gay and they are not gay at all not gay."

todayilearned,fd5qrvm,t1_fd59ibp,1578180432.0,That’s how theranos and a lot of other companies get away with shady behavior. They hire people on H1-B visas that can be fired at any time. If you get fired you have to leave the country _immediately_. There is no grace period. H1-B visa holders will do a lot more to keep their jobs than people who aren’t worried they might have to move their entire family back to their home country where maybe nothing is waiting for them.

movies,fcwtvw1,t1_fcvpojz,1578037419.0,"That wasn’t really the point of their critique. No one thought “hurr durr I never got hate crimed this never happens”. This was 2005 which means all those critics grew up in the 90s or earlier. It was _not_ fun being gay earlier than that, no matter where you lived. 

The point is that this was yet another gay movie made by straight people with straight actors where everyone dies in the end and no one is even remotely happy. That used to be every gay movie and honestly is still like 90% of them. It’s nice that it was celebrated and it is good, but really gay dudes just wanna see a movie where the two leads are both together and not dead at the end of the movie."

With that amount of experience, they would be one of the most senior people in cloud devOps around. They could go to any big company and be making 300-400k plus a couple mil in stock every 3-4 years MINIMUM.
