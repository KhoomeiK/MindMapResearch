mildlyinteresting,feoyh38,t3_eq2hv7,1579308130.0,"So, in my city they sell hobo tiles with the symbols from Hobo code (like these, but many more) painted on ceramic tiles, at Heritage Park. We bought some for my in laws for Christmas this year as my father in law is a train conductor, and the hobo code was often used near train stations and in train cars. His meant ""GRUMPY OLD MAN LIVES HERE"" and my MILs was ""A KIND WOMAN LIVES HERE"". I think they're a pretty interesting part of history."

My friend has three incredible cats she adopted through my shelter that she takes to therapy sessions and it is incredible how intuitive they are to people's needs and boundaries, etc. So neat to watch, and even better to be on the receiving end. So glad you got that experience."
pics,fct5g37,t1_fct0bxu,1577933359.0,Exactly. My sister is getting married this summer and they opted for charcuterie platters instead of a meal to save money and I thinks its a great idea!

cats,fcmlarn,t1_fclldcd,1577780038.0,"I had a Boston Terrier (until recently when he passed) that despised closed doors. At all times he needed the option and the freedom to either enter or depart any room. He would beg to go outside only to turn around and beg to come back in, etc. He would groan and cry at doors inside and out pretty often. He also taught our other Boston how to scratch at doors to come in or out, which sucks be wise the paint comes off every damn time they scratch....."

They do need to be crated on planes or long bus rides like Greyhound Bus trips, etc. But city buses and ctrains are totally allowed as long as they are leashed."
