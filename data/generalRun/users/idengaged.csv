cats,ffaxige,t3_esi1r6,1579746785.0,I didn’t realize how much my first kitty needed a buddy until after I got him one. As soon as second kitty came home he stopped being aggressive with me. He used to randomly attack me and actually draw blood. I think he was just bored. He hasn’t harmed me since he got a new cat friend. Bffs!
cats,ffa0qay,t3_esapqz,1579725544.0,"She looks very healthy and happy as an outdoor cat with her very own human :) Good job, OP!"
talesfromsecurity,ff8z5ht,t3_erw2ur,1579700654.0,Just saw the title and thought this was from the subreddit for ppl having a baby in Feb. I related so hard for a minute.
ABraThatFits,ff0ilpf,t1_fezmn9d,1579469192.0,"I was told that it could negatively affect milk production and could contribute to clogged ducts and mastitis. I guess because of the pressure of the wires? I couldn’t tell you if that’s backed up by science, but I’ve heard that a few times as a soon-to-be FTM. Yeah the non-wired bras are heaven right now because they’re comfortable, but they definitely don’t make the boobs look as nice as a good-fitting wired bra."
ABraThatFits,fey2z7g,t3_eqptnq,1579440073.0,"Can’t really help with the sizing, but can help with the type of bra as a fellow 36 weeks pregnant person. I started experiencing the torture of bras around 20 weeks too. I didn’t think my boobs could handle bras without underwire (36k) but I was wrong. My fitter gave me three non-underwires and they are the best things that have ever happened to me lol. Highly recommend! You’re also not supposed to wear wires when breastfeeding (although I know that’s a little ways away still and you may not breastfeed)."
serialkillers,fey2gag,t3_eqv6l6,1579439838.0,"My husband bought this as a gift for me too! It’s pretty cool, but there are so many grammar mistakes in it it drives me crazy 😹"
belowdeck,femso03,t3_epuq21,1579268482.0,Ah yes it humored me to see his jaw twitch in anger.
ElvisDuranMorningShow,feeiarj,t3_eoid62,1579034317.0,I listen to the on demand channel everyday and skip the phone taps. They are always too cringy for me!
JonBenetRamsey,fe838o3,t3_endxix,1578921996.0,"Wow, just seeing the photograph writing on its own I  immediately recognize the handwriting... just from my memory of what the ransom note looked like."
ElvisDuranMorningShow,fdxplxc,t3_en1wba,1578771595.0,"I usually don’t care about interviews, but I really liked hers and it made me become more of a fan of her. She seems like such a fun, warm person I’d like to be friends with."
AnimalsBeingDerps,fdvif9w,t1_fdsfy0m,1578747732.0,"I actually do think about that from time to time, but it’s one of those things I just choose to ignore. Ignorance is bliss!"
AnimalsBeingDerps,fdvhgr8,t1_fdtcujo,1578747507.0,"Good fun fact! Yeah, I’m not really that concerned—just surprised. I love her too much to be that grossed out lol."
AnimalsBeingDerps,fdryagy,t1_fdrtb5k,1578691505.0,"I want to be relieved that it’s not my toothbrush she’s using, but for all I know she’s doing it to mine too on the other side of the sink."
AnimalsBeingDerps,fdry726,t1_fdrta8v,1578691448.0,"Haha she’s the sweetest girl I know, but she apparently likes to do this along with sticking her paws in drinking glasses. Water bottles only in our household. You may be on to something with the secretly chaotic thing."
AnimalsBeingDerps,fdry23b,t1_fdrrpyg,1578691362.0,For all we know she’s been doing this for 4 years! 🤦🏼‍♀️
loveafterlockup,fdh1ajh,t1_fdgsu7u,1578413208.0,I’m not really either haha! Never heard of the Botox lip flip!
pics,fdfppwr,t3_ekxdkq,1578367248.0,That cat is not Mexican! Cultural appropriation!!! 😹
loveafterlockup,fdfpjx9,t1_fdf40uo,1578367136.0,I think you mean fillers? Botox is not the same as fillers. Botox freezes to get rid of wrinkles and filler plumps. 😊
MurderedByWords,fd4ywh6,t3_ejyafh,1578172534.0,"Nice! But to be a fair, I don’t see a neck on Taylor either..."
ems,fd3ohyb,t3_ejysal,1578160291.0,I like this. But I still feel the need to say I’m at an 8 when I’m really at a 6 to compensate for all the drama queens that medical professionals deal with. I don’t want someone thinking my pain isn’t bad if I’m saying 6 because they think that must really mean I’m a 4 based on other people’s inaccurate responses.
gifs,fcqjon8,t1_fcq9yih,1577887200.0,"I disagree. I would probably have the same reaction. Shock,  then realize I’m being recorded and give the hand, and then hug/kiss."
cats,fcoprvg,t3_ei7ums,1577838330.0,She looks like an angel. Congratulations!
breastfeeding,fc6ayoc,t3_egehnq,1577476346.0,I’m definitely going to have to do this.  😩
Youniqueamua,fc4fnfm,t3_eg1860,1577415278.0,The lipstick application looks like a monkey’s asshole
ElvisDuranMorningShow,fbhdrk8,t3_edcxcu,1576871264.0,Aw man. It’s gonna be a rough couple weeks!
