But bleeding out slowly or burning to death aren't the only ways of dying from a gunshot or a bombing run. Some will die like that, but a lot will be dead in seconds or even instantly. However when you bury people alive, *everyone* dies suffocating slowly."

I dunno man, they seem pretty much the same to me. Just two people making definitive but jokey statements about an unimportant topic. Kinda feels like the sparkling guy just got downvoted because people disagreed with him."
WhitePeopleTwitter,feicfsv,t1_feic4ei,1579135255.0,"But the guy who wrote ""still > sparkling"" which is an even clearer example of what you're talking about, with even less room to interpret it as a joke, didn't?"

relationship_advice,fehovyj,t1_fehnmmk,1579120926.0,">If someone wants to prioritize their career over you, is that a healthy relationship?

At the time no, however priorities change over time. If one person wants to study and one person wants to work and they live across the country, I mean you could be looking at *years* of long distance. Even the strongest relationships struggle with that, and I think it would be unreasonable to expect either person to move for the other."
relationship_advice,fehny75,t1_fehlch4,1579120384.0,">if a partner were to spend all their time playing video games and neglect housework, their job, and their relationship, everyone would agree they were a bad partner.

Then they're not the ""right person"" part... OP's question inherently implies that the person is a good partner. The question was ""What if they're a good partner but-?"" And you're answering with ""What if they're not a good partner?""

>It's not circumstances. It's the way we handle those circumstances

That's just splitting hairs unnecessarily. The circumstances result in the inability to be together. Sure it's *technically* their decision to break up, but it's because of the circumstances."
relationship_advice,fehjt3t,t1_fegrmcu,1579117996.0,">If you have found the right person, timing is not a factor anymore

That seems somewhat disingenuous. People can have careers they aren't willing to sacrifice to spend an appropriate amount of time with a partner, sick parents they need to travel to be with, they could be long distance and unable to leave at the time, etc. There's so many reasons why someone can't be with someone due to timing."
relationship_advice,fehiqkd,t1_fegzyig,1579117366.0,">Without change, you will each continue to do the same things that pushed you away before.

...And that's the ""wrong time"" part of it. Plenty of things that push people apart are a result of bad timing. Studies, wanting kids, work, etc. Many things that change with time. Fate has nothing to do with that, and no one mentioned it or was thinking about it. You're arguing against a point that doesn't exist."

relationship_advice,fegqqsq,t1_fefdnsd,1579100316.0,"Being friends with someone for 5 years means you're very close. To then take a punt at dating and being shot down by that friend means they clearly like you a lot because you're close friends with them, but you're not good enough to be dated. There's an incompatibility that only gets drawn out once rejected, and I think that's definitely enough to crush someone so much they don't want to be friends anymore. It's also incredibly painful to be into someone who is not into you. You're reading into this way more than we can with the info given, and straight up making stuff up (The guy sounds like your typical “nice guy”) about this guy to make him seem like a dick."

As have I, which is exactly why I'm saying he's not special for making fun of the rich. He makes jokes about everything, of course that includes the rich."
WhitePeopleTwitter,fea1nkt,t1_fe9zbns,1578943415.0,"Then the same can be said about any jokes he makes about the rich, especially considering he's one of them. So he's either mocking the rich and the poor alike, or he's mocking neither and it's all satire. I'm good with both, it's all still funny, but you can't pick and choose which bits are genuine and which bits aren't. You can either say that he's a dickhead who pokes fun of everyone and says whatever's on his mind, and think that that's funny or good or not, or you can think that he's just saying what he knows makes him money and he's just doing his job writing jokes."
WhitePeopleTwitter,fea06zc,t1_fe9t48e,1578943051.0,"Exactly why it's ridiculous to say that he's some man of the people and isn't in his ivory tower.

I mean I'm not a physicist or a doctor so I'm just going off of what I've read, but as far as I understand, while there's more negative effects to staying in space long term - e.g. muscle atrophy, bone density loss - the only real effect of take off is the g forces, and the only real consequences of the g forces is the extra weight on you, and blood rushing out of your head which can cause you to pass out or die; however at only 3g's that's not likely, especially as I think astronauts wear g-suits to squeeze their body and keep blood in their head."

todayilearned,fe8gdq4,t1_fe88wuw,1578925850.0,"Hmm, well the biggest force put on the body during space travel is 3g's, which is about the equivalent of an intense roller coaster. However, Doohan was an old, overweight guy, and those forces are put on the body for about 8 and a half minutes. If Doohan weighed, I dunno, 150 kilos on Earth, he'd have to tolerate weighing 450 kilos for 8 minutes. Obviously the weight is distributed across his whole body, but he still has to survive laying on his back with 3 times his normal weight pressing down on him for the whole time. Which might well be possible; he was a tough guy. But I doubt it'd be great for his health."

Drinking lemon juice with water may increase the acid level of your urine, however, which is a sign that your kidneys are doing their job — ridding you of excess acid.
