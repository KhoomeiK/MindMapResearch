Thanks for filling me in, though!!"
religiousfruitcake,ffhh5yo,t1_ffhh3ad,1579935047.0,Honestly I don’t even know which game they’re talking about. I’m old and horrible
religiousfruitcake,ffhbess,t1_ffhbcu4,1579928780.0,I’ll check it out! Thanks :)
religiousfruitcake,ffhb7ay,t3_etihbk,1579928578.0,I’m not a gamer and I don’t subscribe to Steam or discord but I am willing to purchase whatever this is JUST to offset these assholes. For fucks’ sake.

Goddammit this whole thing is exhausting. Whiny cunts indeed."

Lmk if you ever need someone to talk to. PM me anytime."

WhitePeopleTwitter,ffgb49d,t1_fffsocr,1579902350.0,"I felt the same way :)

On the other hand, I love seeing lots of Mitch fans!! Miss that guy."
TooAfraidToAsk,ffga6fz,t1_fffwy65,1579901778.0,"I’ve gotten three news alerts today about this. It’s ridiculous. “Passenger from China lands at [local airport] and is being tested for Coronavirus!” Uh, okay? 

American media is the worst. The sensationalism is off the charts.

When a major pandemic *does* happen here, which it will eventually, no one is going to care because we’re worn out from all the fear-mongering."
MurderedByWords,ffed9mk,t1_ffecy93,1579843804.0,"Come on, friend. You know it’s not about “taxing bill Gates’ 100 billion” or anything like that— it’s about taxing the mega-wealthy their FAIR AMOUNT.

My family makes less than $60k per year and pay about 23% to taxes.

That’s all the democratic socialists are asking— that everyone pays their share. And that we all pay a comparable amount. Is that really too much to ask?"
MurderedByWords,ffec0v3,t1_ffebu7o,1579842637.0,"In my limited knowledge of what you’re asking for and offering, it seems like you’re a good employer. Sucks that you haven’t had good applicants yet, but with what you offer I’m sure it’s just a matter of time. I wish more were like you :)"
MurderedByWords,ffeasie,t1_ffe3nqm,1579841528.0,What is the partial pay they’ll get during the first year? This would by my issue with the job.

MurderedByWords,ffdnrml,t3_esy8ce,1579824802.0,"I guarantee that most Bernie supporters fact check.

We fact check his campaign, AND everyone else’s.

*That’s why we support Bernie.*"
MurderedByWords,ffdnlf0,t1_ffdmle0,1579824698.0,"Doing what, and where?

Sounds like you have a decent offer and haven’t found the right candidates, but that rate of pay is subjective depending on the COL and what the actual job entails.

Not trying to argue, just legitimately curious. I’ve been job searching for *two years* and doing odds and ends in the meantime. $13.50 in NC is really good, but wouldn’t be as competitive in an urban area, for example."
UnethicalLifeProTips,ffdmhs9,t1_ffawjrv,1579824031.0,Thanks for the encouragement! My kids are almost grown and I’ll be empty-nesting soon— maybe I’ll take up a new hobby! :)
