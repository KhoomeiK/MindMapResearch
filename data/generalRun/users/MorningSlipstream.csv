baseball,fglfuta,t1_fgk0q7h,1580895599.0,"You are greatly misunderstanding how much power MLB has over a team's hiring practices.  Spoiler: it's basically none.

Let's look at this way.  If MLB were to kick the Houston Astros out of the league right now, this very second, all of the following would still be true - all employees of the team would still be employees of the team, the stadium would still belong to the team and the city of Houston, the minor league clubs would still have development deals with the team (and would go with them).

Think about when Hinch and Luhnow got suspended.  If Crane hadn't fired them, they would still be employees of the team.  MLB can't tell a team they have to fire someone and they can't tell them who they can and can't hire.  All they can do is say that someone isn't allowed inside a facility the owner's have granted MLB the power to bar someone from."

BPD is a very difficult illness to cope with and it comes with a ton of incredibly huge hurdles to clear, but it's not causing your husband to do anything but feel a certain way and he's then choosing to respond the way he does because he doesn't know any better because, as you've said in another reply, he's not getting the help he needs to learn how.

I would strongly urge you to consider talking to your husband some more about therapy.  BPD is not an illness that should be left untreated and the way he's coping with it is not healthy, nor is the way he's treating you.

I say all of this because I have been where your husband is.  I've been the guy who cusses out and insults his partner on bad days, and looking back on it now, I feel terrible that I treated her that way.

In a way, this does actually answer what you asked.  Your husband is experiencing intense emotions that he doesn't know how to properly cope with so he's lashing out and isolating, which is not the way he should be responding.

As for explaining what to expect in the future, I usually start with letting them know that I'm a little slower to respond to some things than they might be used to because I'll spend a few seconds processing and redirecting my initial BPD response into something healthier before actually saying anything.  I've found that a lot of people initially think I'm ignoring what they've said when I'm actually just thinking, but once I explain this to them, they're more than willing to just wait for me to respond.
