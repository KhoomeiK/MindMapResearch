After soaking, gently sling them to get all the water out (excess water will rot/kill them.) Instead of adhering to a set schedule, don’t soak until the leaves curl inward a bit. Their water needs will depend on how much light they receive/home humidity (which will probably change with the seasons.) Good luck, and your display is beautiful!"

plantclinic,fepjrem,t1_fepgdfi,1579322301.0,That's a great question! The simple answer: too much soil vs. root mass is a recipe for overwatering issues/root rot. There are some more complicated answers (depending on the plant species) regarding how pot size impacts rapidity of growth (pot too big= slower growth/failure to thrive.) BUT the standard up-potting practice is to always plant at the same depth while increasing 1-ish inch in pot diameter.
