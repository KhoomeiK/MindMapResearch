aww,ffy8u2h,t3_evpx63,1580340819.0,the library here has a program kinda like that. a person comes by with a couple dogs once a week or so and they kids can read to them. its to help them read without feeling judged. i think its super cute. i wish i had this as a kid bc i was obsessed with dogs and reading and would of loved this lol.
CatAdvice,ffhd88v,t3_etmrfo,1579930588.0,"haha, yeah sometimes my cats can be a little too much. this is very true if im trying to do something like if im on my laptop they like to suddenly climb on my lap. or if im doing any sort of craft they like to get all up in my business lol. sometimes they lie on my lap and they look sooooo cute sleeping but i really badly gotta go to the bathroom so theres that internal struggle.

also dont even get me started when i gotta be at work at like 6am sometimes and they decided that my room is a race track and theyre playing kitty track meet and run around at like 3am."
AskWomenOver30,ffhd2lp,t3_etm61n,1579930432.0,"Well, i didnt want kids. but then my last relationship, i did eventually want kids with him because i thought he would make a great dad, and would be a good partner in parenting. and so i really did want a child. but then our relationship (which lasted 6 yrs) didnt last so im kinda glad we didnt have kids afterall. now, i dont know...i dont really want kids anymore. sometimes i do think about it. sometimes i do wish i had someone to show love to and pass wisdom and raise better than my mom raised me. but im also ok without ever having kids. 

i got a couple fur babies (2 cats) and thats good enough for me. but idk if my mind would change again if i ever met anyone."
aww,ffck8jd,t3_ess7xd,1579801232.0,awww my friend had a siberian kitty (who my username comes from) and he lived to be over 20 she adopted him around age 4ish? he was a great cat i miss cid.
AskWomenOver30,ffbezzq,t3_esgn27,1579762429.0,"I only really have one friend lol. but since shes working fulltime now as a cna and i work too, we dont hang out much and thats ok. we usually get together when we happen to both have a day off. sometimes thats not for a few weeks. outside of that we'll text each other here and there. i usually ask her what her days off are or say ""hey got a this day off if u do too wanna hang out?"" 

i realized that as you get older its harder and harder to hang out with people. sometimes you dont even feel like it, and thats ok. dont worry if you cant see them as much. just makes your time with them more enjoyable."
CasualConversation,ff0tz4o,t3_eqzg8o,1579472285.0,"as a cashier (not for aldi but for a grocery store) it is nice when the customer is also friendly back. i mean, tbh i dont rly care if they say anything or not. bc on the other side when im a customer im pretty quiet and will only say a couple words bc most of the time im tired and i got social anxiety. but im sure you made that cashiers day, sometimes when a customer doesnt say anything back ill think ""hmm did i say something wrong? they arent very friendly oh well"" but then i think ""eh wait im kinda like that too as a customer, and theyre prolly tired or non talkative"" and shrug it off.

bleh the only thing i dont like is when a customer is just rude to me like wtf???? im just a cashier i just ring your stuff up i dont run the store. its very limited as to what i can do."
aww,ff0sqd6,t1_feyocb8,1579471955.0,"idk how to train a cat to do that, some cats are just like that. my last cat a white stray i took in, she followed me down the street to 7-11 and would wait for me then walk with me back. shed also go walks with me around the block. i didnt train her she just wanted to. 

also, last place i lived this family took in a stray orange cat. and at first i wondered why there was this orange cat hanging around my front porch. finally i found out from the family that they walk this way to take thier kids to karate and so the cat follows them, waits by my place, and when they walk back he follows them back to their place i thought that was so cute.

some cats will come if u call their names. so maybe after ur cat gets use to their name try calling them and seeing if theyll come to you. if so you might be able to go outside and call their name to follow you?"
AskWomenOver30,feov4fy,t3_epyjrf,1579306087.0,"lol i really dont have any friends like i use to thats for sure. idk if its bc im in my 30s but i dont like being around ppl or hanging around them for long. i just get tired. like even my bff and i dont hang out for too long anymore. i think i just value my alone time and peace and quiet more since i work and various other things. 

as a teenager all i wanted to do was be with my friends id spend hours on the phone with them. now its like ill keep phone calls to a min and as needed lol."
AskWomenOver30,fefzvuo,t3_eoxbqm,1579071031.0,"kind..of. ok so before the current job i have now, i was working at another one. it was fast food. and i hattteeed it. just first of all fast food (i was in the kitchen) is hard enough as it is, but on top of that i had a boss that was nice outside of work but when she was at work just yeah.... anyways, i finally had enough of it when she scheduled me one day a week. like, i need a job to live off of. i need a job to pay rent, and food, etc...

anyways, as it just so happened. shortly after that happened like a couple days ago, i got a call from my current job wanting me to come in for an interview the next day. well i had work that next day. so i took a chance and i called up that night and just up and quit. just called and said ""sorry i cant commute anymore and i already got another job so im quitting"" so, i actually took a risk bc i wasnt sure if id get this job honestly, i just wanted out. 

luckilly for me it did work out, and ive been at my current job for almost 5 yrs. 

&#x200B;

anyways, if possible, try to save up enough money to last you a few months before you quit. or at least be sure you are finacially secure before quitting. that way in case you dont find a job you'll have enough money to get you through a month or two. but i would just start looking for a new job anyways, i understand having to work a stressful job that really takes a toll on your mental health because you have no choice, so i understand now why you need to stick with it. but you dont have to forever. and its better to find another job because no job in the end is worth your mental health. 

and dont worry about what your family thinks. in the end its your job, and your life, and your health. not theirs."
CatAdvice,fef1hgo,t3_eonynh,1579045957.0,Yea cats sleep wherever they please. But your kitten might sleep in her bed if she wants. Before i got my kitten i bought my big cat a bed and for some reason he didnt want nothing to do with it so i gave it to my neighbors and bought him another one and he loved it. So maybe thats it? Or try moving the bed by a window or on a chair or something. My cats love thier big bed when its by my patio window bc it gets alotta sun.
AskWomenOver30,feeyllx,t3_eoqwbb,1579044070.0,I dont even know if id ever be able to retire. Ive seen my ex bfs mom retire bc she was too injured to work and she barely gets anything from social security and that woman had been working since she was 15. Anyways i guess if i was fortunate to retire id like to just sleep in or bake more. Idk im 34 i have like 30 more yrs left i guess.
AskWomenOver30,fdpth09,t3_elq790,1578639826.0,"Exactly! Im 34 and I dont know why 30s are treated like ur about to keel over and your life has no meaning. I always saw these stupid articles like ""things to do before ur 30"" or ""places to go before ur 30"" like lol k sooo once i turned 30 not allowed any fun? ""Oh sorry i cant go to paris. No its not a matter of money its bc im now 30 im not allowed any joy bc im a spinster.""

30s isnt terrible or scary. I feel like i have a better grasp in life and my goals than when i was in my 20s. And that i understand things more."

AdviceAnimals,fdhizhj,t1_fdg9cmp,1578423652.0,ive seen a winter! i was so suprised. she was just as suprised to find out my name is spring lol. autumn and summer are the more common seasonal names though.

AskReddit,fdg5tnr,t3_el2az5,1578381201.0,white cell from cells at work. im not complaining tho.
AdviceAnimals,fdg5pp4,t3_el2ftf,1578381076.0,lol i think tho it would depend on the name. bc my name is Spring and i think thats hella rad. its unusual but its pretty enough and it seems like an actual name. so if ure going with an unusual or diff name pick one thats nice at least. (btw my full entire name is even radder but kinda afraid to put that on the internet)
internetparents,fccfoz8,t3_egx3ri,1577597858.0,"I think the first time i shaved was when i was roughly around your age? I started because i felt embarassed about it. tbh now i rarely shave my legs bc i wear pants anyways and im just lazy. 

i would though suggest not to get those super cheap big razors that are like a dollar or something. those yellow ones? yeah those'll nick your legs up and give you some serious razor burn. trust me i learned the hardway. 

also use shaving cream (or i have heard and tried this as well, conditioner like what you use on your hair, works as well....if you cant get any shaving cream)"
