""*I get so tired of everything being God's fault or Satan's fault*... Sometimes shit just happens. You didn't get cancer because of evil or good forces. You got cancer because you came in contact with a carcinogen and your body was incapable of fighting it off. No one did that to you. You weren't saved from a car accident because you had to go back and get your keys, the chips fell that way. A flood didn't destroy a town as God's wrath or Satan's joy, the town was in a flood plain and these are the things that happen.. it's not God it's life."""
