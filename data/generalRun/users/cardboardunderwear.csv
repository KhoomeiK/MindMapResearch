>... In 2009, Discovery agreed to air a one-hour special called Safety Third. On Safety Third, I talked candidly about mistakes we’d made on Dirty Jobs, and the unintended consequences of putting Safety First. I argued that many compulsory Safety programs discouraged personal responsibility in favor of Legal Compliance. I asked viewers to consider all the amazing progress that would have never occurred had Safety been valued above all else. (I also pointed out that if big companies really believed that Safety was First they would wrap their employees in bubble pack and send them home.) I concluded by saying that Safety Third was a lot more honest than Safety First, but ultimately, too important and too personal to be reduced to a platitude. But if we had to have one, my vote was for “Safety Always.”

>Well, hell. I might as well have suggested that we replace steel-toed boots in favor of flip-flops. Or outlaw hardhats. I got a nasty letter from OSHA, and a flood of angry mail calling me a “bad role model.” NASA was pissed. So were several Labor Unions, and dozens of Fortune 500 companies who took exception to my “irreverent tone.” I even got a snippy letter from PETA, though I’m still not sure why.

>Safety Third had ruffled a lot of feathers, but I was thrilled by the response.  I answered all the angry mail, and went to speak personally to those organizations and companies who were most offended. For the most part, skeptics came to agree that the underlying concepts of Safety Third – common sense and personal responsibility – were still worth talking about, and conceded that any resulting conversation which might lead to heightened awareness would ultimately be a good thing. Your piece, Dave, is now a part of that conversation, and I’m grateful.

From what I can read here he is advocating that safety goes beyond just regulatory compliance. It also entails common sense and personal safety. Seems reasonable to me.

When you're hauling ass downhill, sure it's nice to be able to pedal, but the reality is the energy you're putting in is miniscule compared to the drag, plus you have all that weight pulling you down hill.

So my recommendation is to go low.  At least 1:1 on your lowest gear or even lower.  Even if you have to sacrifice on the high end its a worthy trade."

bikewrench,fe28pdd,t3_enix4r,1578835674.0,"Maybe try this..

Put the bike on a stand.  Shift the rear to somewhere in the middle.  Shift to the lowest gear on the front.  Then pedal the bike and shift the front derailleur just by pulling the cable and see what happens.  If you can get it to go through all three rings then it will tell you that the FD works and it's maybe a shifter/cable tension issue.

If that's the case, I'd guess tension is too loose as someone else pointed out. (if it was too tight you wouldn't get to the small ring). 

So dial the barrel adjusters in all the way. Back them out one turn (if you're doing this without a tool to pull the cable tight maybe just leave it in) .  Loosen the nut holding the cable. Pull the cable as tight as you can then tighten the nut. More than likely the cable will still be too loose and you won't be able to get to the big ring easily or you will get rubbing. So dial out the barrel adjuster quarter turn at a time until shifting is restored. 

This assumes the FD is installed in the right place, your stop screws are set, the cable isn't binding, etc."

Regarding warming from additional CO2. Negligible.  Here's why: the vegetation that's burning will grow back in at most a couple decades.  It will recapture the carbon that was released.  This isn't a case like the Amazon where an entire carbon sink is replaced with farmland.  This situation is temporary.

theydidthemath,fdt8vxn,t1_fdsdevf,1578713448.0,"It seems to be the right order of magnitude though.

Labor cost doesnt make much difference does it.  Say there's three people each at 150K per year.  That still puts you at $1,700 for a day (assuming they fly 5 of 7 days) and there could easily be more than one flight in a day. And honestly you can't even count that unless removing that flight allows you to eliminate three jobs.  Its a sunk cost otherwise.

Terminal fees are also sunk aren't they.  All those fees are going to be paid as long as that airplane is flying whether there are people on it or not. Presumably that aircraft needed to be in those two locations.

Maintenance too.  But even if you included landing fees, and terminal fees and threw a number at them....say $10,000.  $10K against $70K is only a 14% error.  That's not diddle on that whole calculation.

Regarding occupancy you're right.

And then these planes haul freight also which is unaccounted for revenue. But there are also many many other costs that could be prorated into a single flight.  I'm guessing the OOM is correct.
