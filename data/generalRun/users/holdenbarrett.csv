Meditation,fgc89gn,t3_exe96l,1580670154.0,"Thanks for posting, Randomom, it’s fantastic to know I’m not the only one confused. I’m super confused on this whole “meditation” thing.

I believe the original Sanskrit word for meditation simply means to think over or to ponder over.

But this is not at all what the vast majority of people are talking about when they use the word “meditation.” It seems like people are defining mediation as something totally different. It seems like people are describing how to try to lay the foundation for making that “pondering” happen. So like, meditation is now just a description of all the techniques and methods to try to quiet the mind to PREPARE it to think over or ponder.

So then all this focusing and deep breathing and mindfulness stuff is purposefully to try to get to a place where there is enough silence in your head order to think over and ponder one’s, um, purpose...

It is becoming clear to me that many people in here think they have “understood” meditation and are therefore qualified to tell others about it because they can see and feel a difference in themselves specifically because of meditation.

That might not be what meditation is about though.

The majority of people here, maybe, are merely telling you about the patterns and beliefs that they have successfully become attached to in order to try to let go of other patterns and beliefs. 

Does that sound like the meditation that has felt confusing to you?

That’s confusing to me.

The thing that is tricky is that it probably seems to work! It probably feels much better to have these techniques and practices and methods and systems to rely upon than the methods and systems we usually rely upon all day, which are the methods and systems of prejudices, expectations and judgements...

But that type of meditation is simply tossing away one uncomfortable thing for something else that is more comfortable- 
is that type of meditation actually effective? Is it possible that simply following another persons ideas of how to meditate might actually harm you? I think it is a possibility. 

Randomom, you do not hold that pretense and so you are infinitely more likely to discover what meditation actually is.
 
Once you understand what meditation is, then I imagine all your other questions about meditation are instantly answered, and that is what makes it complete understanding, and not fragmentary knowing.

If you want more truth about what has become very confusing about meditation, check out 
Jiddu Krishnamurti."

Not having chatter is simply whe the brain is not engaged in solving. Coincidentally, this state of receptivity is a much more powerful place for the brain to reside than the lunacy of our constant chatter.


I still often have chatter but I understand what is happening when there is silence.


Your brain and nervous system able able to operate and function without the chatter happening and in fact the brain is highly sensitive and active when silent.

Here is what is not happening:
The brain is not purposefully trying to figure out and solve.
When the brain is purposefully attempting to solve this moment, it is using its past experience and knowledge to do that solving.
Solving is of the past, as it requires we rely upon what we already know to be answers-

this equates to chatter.

Every time. Thinking in the past has to be in the form of chatter.
But.
Observing this moment is completely silent.

There is a huge difference between solving and understanding.

New, thoughtful readers, concerned to find out the truth about life, will find here the tolerant understanding which was his hallmark.

Understand what comparison is.

I know that does not seem to make any sense or sounds like it will not do anything but I truly think it is the very best solution which will actually help you. 

In understanding what comparison actually IS, there will be instant transformation out of that comparison.
You want out of comparison, right, so you can enjoy this wonderful person?

Seriously, you will hear zero people say this and that is why it is worth just 10 seconds of your consideration.

Comparison has nothing to do with anything or anyone else but your own thinking process.

Just understanding what is happening when comparison is happening will instantly drop it, like a realizing you are holding poison.

Please consider it, you are getting the exact same advice over and over, let something else in.

Look above at the advice your getting. Every single person is telling you to do or be something different, to think something different, to add this or let go of that.

Not a single person has asked you to question what you think comparison even is.

How can you move forward if you do not understand what is even happening?
Seriously. How?

99% of people will tell you what to do. Look up there. They all think they know.

What if they are wrong?



Look, it makes no sense right? How do you question what something is without simply remembering what you thought it was yesterday?

Well, if you do understand the next move, how to question yourself instead of answer yourself,
you will not only transform your comparison but you will also transform many of the underlying beliefs which have made your need to compare yourself to others so incredibly important to you."

NitrousOxide,ffsmhjz,t1_fbfzk10,1580185454.0,"Below is truly a phenomenal description of just how far nitrous can take you out of you. This person went to the dentist and had this incredible experience:

""On this occasion it seemed to me that I passed, after the first few inhalations of the gas, directly into a state of consciousness already far more complete than the fullest degree of ordinary waking consciousness, and that I then passed progressively upwards (for there was an actual sensation of upward movement) into finer and finer degrees of this heightened awareness. 

But although one must write of it in terms of time, time had no place in the experience. In one sense it lasted far longer than the short period between inhaling the gas and 'coming round', lasted indeed for an eternity, and in another sense it took no time at all. In terms of time, however, the first phase of the experience was comparatively brief (though perhaps it would be more exact to say that it was comparatively unimportant): a confusion of sensations in which, while I was already hardly aware of my body, I was still able to think in the ordinary way, and with some surprise that I was not being made unconscious by the gas I was inhaling, but very much the reverse. For already I knew, I understood, I actually was, far more than I normally knew, understood and was. I put it in this way because I had no impression of suddenly receiving new knowledge, understanding and being. Rather I felt that I was rediscovering these things, which had once been mine, but which I had lost many years before. While it was altogether strange, this new condition was also familiar; it was even in some sense my rightful condition. Meanwhile, what was becoming unreal, slow and clumsy was the ordinary world which I was leaving behind, but of whose shadowy existence I was still vaguely aware; indeed it presented itself to me as being like the receding shadow which fades across the landscape when the sun comes out.   


""As for the emotional tone of this phase of the experience, I can only describe it as being compounded of wonder, joy, and a wholly peaceful *inevitableness* for which there is no name. This sensation, which yet had nothing to do with my already anesthetized senses, and to which our waking word-values do not belong, had an emotional depth which does not belong to waking sensation, so that it is all but indescribable. Meanwhile, the extraordinary feeling of the *rightness of things* increased, became more poignant, and was accompanied as it did so by a peculiar sensation of upward and bodiless flight. This sense of upward movement continued until it seemed to me that I was rapidly passing through what I afterwords told myself was a 'region of ideas'. The emphasis had shifted, that is to say, from the emotional to the intellectual.  


""But it was only when I had 'come to' and was again subject to time as we know it that I felt that I had passed through this 'region of ideas' so rapidly that there had been no time to form concepts, to grasp anything of this region's content and store it for later reference, though in the midst of the experience itself there was all the time in eternity; and, besides, concepts were quite unnecessary in that part of consciousness, since one could manage perfectly well without them; this was a condition of complete and spontaneous lucidity where there was not the slightest need to 'think'. One simply knew; and one knew not one thing here and another thing there, and all of them things quite unknown to ordinary consciousness; one knew everything there was to know. Thus one knew also that everything was one thing, that *real knowledge* was simultaneous knowledge of the universe and all it contains, oneself included. It was perfectly true, what one had read in the books; in reality (as opposed to the comparative unreality in which we live) the All is the One…  


""In the 'region of ideas' everything lived and moved; everything 'breathed', and breathed with that 'one breath' which is the universal inspiration and expiration expressed in the cardinal opposites of day and night, male and female, summer and winter. Indeed the wonderful and awe-inspiring livingness of everything seemed to be part of the interrelatedness of everything; within the one thing which the entire universe was, the multitudinous aspects of it enjoyed a living relationship both to one another and to the totality, and this in an extraordinary complexity which at the same time was an extraordinary simplicity. According to our ordinary way of understanding we are used to relating to one another only things between which a relationship is sensually perceptible or logically calculable. Here relationships were of a different kind altogether. Things were related to one another which to ordinary thinking would have no connexion whatever, and related to one another in ways which we cannot normally conceive. Things which we should call far apart, whether in space or time or by their nature, here inter-penetrated; things which we should call wholly different from one another became one another…  


""One knew and understood this different world as a spectator of it, recognizing it as the object of one's apprehension, but at the same time knew and understood it existed within oneself; thus one was at once the least significant atom in the universal whole and the universal whole…Meanwhile, the 'bodiless upward lift' continued. The 'region of ideas' gave place to another of which I can only say that in it everything came to rest in a perfection of light. Here, while all was certainly living, all was unchanging. Here *at the heart of the sun* stillness had it's being… And the light in which one found oneself and which one called 'the sun', was of an utterly indescribable purity and lucency. It was as if the gathering momentum of the 'flight' of the unconscious dental patient into consciousness, which had become faster and faster through the 'region of ideas', had now reduced those multitudinous ideas by an incalculable series of combinations and canceling to this final and perfect unity . In the 'region of ideas' one had understood that this must be so. Now it was so...  


""By now I was sufficiently aware in the ordinary sense to feel myself as something separate from this geometrical design which was a representation of the sum of things. I was once more able to think normally, to say to myself as the golden lines faded, 'So that's what it all means', and even as I said it to forget what it all means; I had 'regained consciousness' and with it an aching jaw and a vague impression of the dentist impatiently telling me to pull myself together. Yet a dim and apparently nonsensical echo of 'what it all means' did remain in my head. 'What it all means', I was urgently telling myself in the attempt to frustrate the swamping forgetfulness, is 'Within and within and within and...' repeated like a recurring decimal.

The act of thinking is basically another way of saying the act of answering. Thinking is basically just the act of solving.

But can life be “solved?”
Can you be solved?
Can this moment be solved?

We all rely upon our thinking to solve our problems, but this makes no sense because a problem can only ever arise in the first place when there is a reliance on our memory of the past to figure out the present.

How can there be the understanding of a problem today by using predetermined answers from yesterday? This is why answering and understanding are completely different movements.

How can we not be confused when we rely upon our memory of what has already happened in the past in order to understand what is now happening in the present?

So that is how all confusion takes hold and grows. There is a fundamental misunderstanding of what is thinking. 

Instead of asking how to think, how to solve my problem, again, the first question is, what IS thinking?


There are instant answers that thinking comes up with but those answer are always reliant upon yesterday and therefore cannot be truly “purposeful.” Purpose is a description of now.

what is purpose?

If you are asking questions that are already relying upon you having an answer, such as knowing what purpose is, there could easily be confusion if that answer is incorrect or incomplete.

So if you are asking what your purpose is, you are presupposing you understand purpose. 

So, the question of what is **my** purpose will always be confusing and not feel good since the interior of the question is not first understood. If there is not an understanding of purpose first, then how can you have an understanding of ""your"" purpose?

selfimprovement,ffjepqb,t3_etvf6k,1579996694.0,"Depression is a huge deal. I am absolutely in no way making light of your struggle when I say this, and maybe I shouldn’t say this at all,  but I’m going to. And I’m saying this in no way to attempt to sabotage you and your journey, though it may be hard to hear feedback right now which isn’t going to be positive.

I think you have dropped something and picked up something else, something less depressing.
Being less depressed probably feels absolutely amazing to you, freeing and fresh and different.

But when I read your list I can’t help thinking that you have successfully diverted your thinking from being extremely self-centered to less self centered.  (I’m using the phrase “self-centered” here not as conceited, but self-centered in the actual sense of the word).

For example, to purposefully try to surround yourself with ”good” people and not “toxic”people. I get the idea here, it’s quite a popular one. But does this truly deal with your depression? And also, wouldn’t it mean purposefully staying away from people who may be toxic specifically because of their depression?

And the idea of distracting yourself with positivity. Also very popular but exactly what is happening to you when you purposefully force your thoughts to go where they don’t naturally go? Are you actually feeling positive or just less negative?


Are you sure this works, or does it just work better than succumbing to negative chatter?

Working better than something broken does not actually mean it’s working effectively, it’s just no longer totally busted.
Are you absolutely certain you aren’t just rearranging life to better suit yourself and your beliefs?
I may be wrong but you absolutely better be right, otherwise you may just be right back where you were when your list becomes difficult or doesn’t prove itself everyday.

Possibly the issue is that you are questioning everything, but already applying answers.
If this is happening, basically there can only be conflict.

Does this make sense?

Possibly:
If you have an answer to your question, then you didn’t actually have a question. Maybe what you had was an uncomfortable feeling which seemed to arise from wondering about life but was actually from the fact that you think you already have the answer...

It is, imo, the quintessential human problem.

AskReddit,fffurhy,t3_etdyvd,1579892237.0,"Comparison is a method of thinking, it is not merely a description of a type of thinking. It is a huge deal. 

It cannot be solved or fixed. It can be understood.
Understanding comparison is the transformation away from comparison.

Think about it. How can you ever “fix” your comparison without at the same time needing to continue to use comparison?
How can you find out and discover some solution without comparing it against other competing solutions?
Again, It is impossible because comparison is a method of thinking not just a description of a certain type of thinking.

But, if there is an energetic drive to understand what comparison is, it will transform itself simply by understanding what it actually is.

(I still compare btw, but I can intellectually see how I can never successfully deal with it by trying to fix it, stop it, change it, or deny it. You just can’t stop or fix or solve something without, at the exact same time, using comparison to decide the best way of doing so. If you think you can, go into it and make sure, cause if your wrong, you’re kinda burying yourself in struggle.)"

selfhelp,ffb3ixo,t1_ff5ffx7,1579750860.0,"Also man, consider this.
Gaming is a stress reducer, like a really good one. Until it isn’t.
I went through a stage of getting better and better at Bullet Force, became completely addicted and had to uninstall the game only to reinstall it months later. 
But I had a very powerful insight once while playing and immediately uninstalled and have not gone back.
As fun as gaming can be, in the long run, it was not how I wanted to spend my time, even if I was stressed and needed a stress reducer.
There are other ways of quieting that chatter and stress, better ways.
It might be that you are turning to gaming in order to reduce stress. 
School can be stressful when you take it too seriously, and it can also be a real pain in the ass and annoying when you don’t take it seriously enough.
But school can be enjoyable, even high school, with balance.
You will find it, I’m pretty confident, you sound like a smart person who is looking out for himself. If you haven’t entered high school yet but you are reaching out to help get balance, youre brilliant.
The stress in your house can come down if you all speak honestly and with compassion, and I bet when it does, life will feel lighter and even things like understanding and completing projects in school will take on a new appeal.
Maybe instead of gaming next time you get the urge, instead watch a YouTube video of a guy named Alan Watts. You may be a bit young to fully appreciate him but maybe not...

The “meditation” people are typically talking about on here seems to be a set of beliefs and practices that seem to help loosen up the constant pulling the brain does.
But do these practices and beliefs actually do anything to untie the knot?

Loosening a knot through practice and belief, imo, is pretty much the opposite of the original meditation.

The problem is, people get stuck on the idea of not being purposeful. People just don’t want to give up their ambitions and intentions. They don’t like it so they choose something they do like.

Before you listen to the hundreds of thousands of people on here all saying the same thing, which is to concentrate, maybe check out a few voices which hold true to he original meditation, which is simply to ponder over.

Your question of how to do something without intention, that is a brilliant thing to ponder over.
