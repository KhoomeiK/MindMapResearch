tumblr,ffv2nvc,t1_fftz9et,1580254273.0,All my Spanish speaking life I’ve known a toilet in Spanish is called a “guater”. Only later to realize I was saying the English word water the whole time.

tumblr,ffg5b19,t3_etci5o,1579898771.0,Yeah idk about who y’all are talking about but ho boy does this apply to Sherlock! They would ve had a much better show if they’d respected the fans a little. They queerbaited them so bad then got mad at the fans for getting successfully queerbaited.

tumblr,fen8m13,t1_felz1fz,1579279352.0,"Since subjects (“I “) are generally not used in Japanese, it sounds more like “talking backwards I am” actually.  Cuz in English you can’t say “talking backwards am”.  Also look at the style of opening on Luke’s original outfit. They just thought Asian things were hella alien looking in the 70s and 80s. That’s why he also talks in zen coans- do or not do, there is no try."
menwritingwomen,fen5poa,t1_femissf,1579277552.0,The word maiden hood cracks me up. Do you mean that super awkward teenage phase where you’re not quite in control of your limbs? So sensual!

wholesomebpt,feejzp3,t1_fee3qpz,1579035297.0,"What if someone showed that thanksgiving meal with the caption ending as, “ladies and gentlemen, my wife!” You’d see the pride and happiness too. I think it’s just because of the negative connotations of hearing people say stuff like, “a real woman wouldn’t do x y and z” that people knee jerk react to the idea that you’re implying that’s a *real* woman. Like wouldn’t you cringe if you heard a white person start a sentence with, “black people are all...”? Just cuz we’ve heard so much racist crap we anticipate more. It’s like a trigger phrase."
