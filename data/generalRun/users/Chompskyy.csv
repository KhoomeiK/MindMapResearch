It's not like I'm going out of my way to stay in touch with her, you know? And right, if she's clearly into someone else, why wouldn't she let me know & make it clear she's uncomfortable having a date with me? That's sort of my logic, either her sister was exaggerating & it's just some dude she's met & hangs out with, I don't know what their deal is & as a result I really shouldn't even be phased by it, because she may not even be interested in that dude.

Pretty generic, but considering I don't know you or her, it's the best advice I can give. Best example would be like, ""Oh really? you play instruments? I totally just picked up this sampler last week and it's been so much fun messing with it, anyone who plays any sort of music can find so many creative things to do with it"", and then by about the last 5-10% of the expected date, gauge her interest to keep things moving & if she doesn't seem like she's in a hurry to GTFO then you would throw out a, ""Hey, if you're down we could relocate to my place, I've got some next level green tea & I can show you how to make some drum loops with the sampler""

Realistically she just needs *any* reason to be there, and it doesn't feel weird or unnatural to suggest you two do something that was introduced in earlier / previous conversation. Just happens to be that thing was seeded to bring her back to your place"

In fact, I would argue almost none of these politicians do. I wouldn't trust any bill on intellectual property being pushed by the state. Their interests clearly lie in money and not actual support of intellectual property. 

That being said, I chose not to dive deep into his quote on 'meeting leaders about intellectual property rights for artists' because I assume this is a broadly understood idea. The fact that politicians could give a shit about IP laws unless it directly affects their pockets.

I'd give it another 30 years before anyone young or knowledgeable enough on technology is in a political position to present an actually reasonable bill personally"

technology,ff9lqrc,t1_ff9kw69,1579715653.0,"Because it's irrelevant what the meeting was called for, the fact of the matter is that he made it clear how he feels about these guys. If you're putting down someone's ability as a job creator, that's totally fair in this context, but 

""one of the little creeps sitting around that table, who was a multi- — close to a billionaire — who told me he was an artist because he was able to come up with games to teach you how to kill people.”

Is easily one of the most unnecessary lines to have ever included in an interview. If he knew what was good for him he'd keep his true opinions about these things to himself. At no point in the quote I put was he referring to job creation. He made his point in the quote that you put up, and then he tried to what, drive that point home by calling the conference a bunch of little creeps that call themselves artists for making games that teach you how to kill people? Sounds like he's uninformed, because no one is making games that actively teach you how to kill people."
technology,ff9kd39,t1_ff9j1tg,1579714843.0,"Here's the direct quote so you can go ahead and decide for yourself how he feels:

“And you may recall, the criticism I got for meeting with the leaders in Silicon Valley, when I was trying to work out an agreement dealing with them protecting intellectual property for artists in the United States of America. And at one point, one of the little creeps sitting around that table, who was a multi- — close to a billionaire — who told me he was an artist because he was able to come up with games to teach you how to kill people.”

Hm, kind of sounds like he's calling all of the leaders in the meeting a bunch of little creeps. Just because he was referring to one doesn't mean his quote isn't insinuating that the rest are creeps. None of these games are teaching people how to kill, and it's one of the most ignorant statements I've ever heard in regards to violent video games. When have you ever seen a game release under the mantra of ""ok who do you want to kill? Your family? Your neighbor? Come learn all of the different ways you can kill them!""

Nice try playing the /r/iamverysmart role of intentionally going against the grain. I'm not saying people can't have their own opinion, but this is a direct quote, not misinformation."

It ranged from kindled relationships that logistically fell out, to old school friends I hadn't seen for ages. Was catching up and having an awesome time, when seemingly out of nowhere I woke up. Fell almost immediately back to sleep so I could reconnect with them but unfortunately, my brain doesn't operate like that. Full reset.

I'll never get to know what interesting lives they led after we all departed, it was a very somber feeling, even though anything they would've had to say would've been made up of my own thoughts. Still, it felt incredibly real and compelling.
