I'm somewhat new to FI (about 2ish years), and every time I talk to my friend about it or look on this sub, I come up with questions that I think I should've thought of a while ago. The one yesterday was like, ""If I retire at 45, how do I pull money out without penalty?"" I know. I should've thought about that a while ago. -_- He said usually people have a plan for passive income from 40 (or whatever the retirement date)-65. I was thinking about maxing out my 401k, but my current 401k is about 91k. And my personal stocks are about 21k. Roth IRA is at 30k and HSA is at 8k. The 65 year old me is probably happy, but the me at 45 is probably going to be like, ""Okay, now I have to live super frugally for 25 years."" I'd like to get started more in dividends and getting more into passive income. He said I could also pull out what I contribute into my Roth IRA without penalty before I'm at that age, but I kind of don't want to. o_o;"

They may start lower for entry level, but once you start learning how to code, you can move positions every 2-3 years and potentially get 20% increases every time. Depending on how good you are though, you may hit a plateau in salary. 

See if coding is actually for you. I work in tech, and I have seen a lot of people not get code. Many people may read some sort of an article that says that engineers and software developers make a ton of cash, so they go to school to pursue a degree, only to realize that coding is not for them. If I were you, I’d look into some sort of training before you get in too deep. Depends on what you want to do, but there are a lot of tutorials for it.

Anyway, besides that. Seeing everything I have at all time highs. It's making me happy, but I  think about how it may come crashing down when everything drops. Like, I mean. It's going to happen for sure, and I'm not going to time the market and pull, but it's just the feeling I think that everyone has. My friend was just randomly talking about how the US has been printing 90 bill in cash and the mortgage interest is dropping so low. I didn't talk about my worries, but it's just makes me think that I'm still somewhat of a newbie in finance, and I'm not sure if I'm mentally prepared. My long-term plan will always be to hold and keep contributing, but I'm trying to solidify that mentality for when it does happen. Does anyone else struggle with these thoughts? I'm not SUPER anxious about it. But it's just a little inkling that pops up once in a while.

By the way, there was a comment that resonated with me last, last January in this discussion thread. After the market bounced back up, it was something like, ""Now that we're all rich again..."""

femalefashionadvice,ff51qhn,t3_erh8y5,1579577868.0,"tldr: Don't over-pack.

1. I always pack only what I need. I pre-plan the outfits so that I don't have to think about what I'm going to wear with what. I don't recommend you put a bunch of random skirts, shirts, or shoes in your luggage that you ""might"" wear. This causes you to over-pack, and I don't know. Honestly, it's more stress. 
2. Packing organization. I'm honestly a little over-obsessed with packing. To the point where I just watch a bunch of [packing videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljX--MpJzBQ). I personally pack my clothing in large packing cubes. (You can buy these for like $5-10 on Amazon.) The even have the compressed ones that are amazing. I put my undergarments in smaller zipper bags. And I keep a large plastic bag that I got from the 99 cent store to throw my dirty clothes in. This REALLY helps not get your clothes mixed in with each other. And iono. It's just more sanitary and doesn't cause your clean clothes to be mixed in with your dirty clothes. Also, put bathing suits outside or in the bathroom to dry. Don't mix with clothes. Put your shoes in a bag. THIS IS IMPORTANT."

edit: Also, you might want to add smart goals to this. I am a turbulent person, and I overthink way, way, way too much. ""Not sweating over the small stuff"". That is actually really difficult for an anxious person. I've gotten over this in the last three years (yes, it actually takes that long. It's a huge probably for some with anxiety, like me) by starting to laugh at myself.

Literally, I used to get mad over being clumsy because I break things. Lose things. Hurt myself on accident. Mess something else and have to clean it up. Now, I just look at it from a different point of view. Like if a ghost was staring at me laughing. So when I drop stuff, I'm laugh at how stupid I look. When I hurt myself on accident, in that brief moment of pain that registers to my mind, I'm thinking, ""Wow, I can't believe I did that. lol"" rubs upcoming bruise over and over*

For some reason, knowing the humility in this way really helped me to not overthink what other people's intentions are? I don't know if that makes sense. It gave me a lot of confidence.

Also, this is going to sound so weird, but. I started complimenting myself when looking in the mirror. I am so insecure over my acne sometimes. Even the way I look with no makeup. I spent 5 minutes in the mirror complimenting myself with compliments other people have given me in the past. I know like. OkAY I KNOW THAT YOU'RE GOING TO FEEL STUPID THE FIRST TIME YOU'RE DOING IT. My brother did it, and he said he kept looking away and getting shy/awkward. Because you're literally facing yourself. I started laughing because I embarrassed myself. But in a good way, like ""Oh yoou~""

-Not sure if this is common sense, but you get your rail pass information in the mail prior to going go Japan. Then you get to Japan and stand in a little line to get your actual rail pass.

-Go to Akihabara at night. 

-Do not hike all of Fushimi Inari.

-The deers are Nara bruise when they bite. Don't put your face near them.

-Make sure you call your bank to let them know you're travelling. Also, cheapest way for me to get cash was to go to a 7/11 and withdraw. You think it's cheaper in an airport/exchange/bank, but it's actually a large percentage taken out. You think it's almost the same, but it isn't. I called my bank, asked them to raise my withdrawal, and paid $10 at the 7/11 ATM to withdraw $600 at a time. (Our hostel only took cash.)

-Honestly, after the first 3 temples, we got bored of looking at temples.

-You don't really need to book train rides in advance. You can just pay for them when you're there, so don't worry about that. Trains come and go constantly. Just hop on the next one.

-We couldn't go to Studio Ghibli Museum or Final Fantasy restaurant because we didn't book soon enough. ;_;

Before I worked in tech, I can’t lie, I used to get irritated over everything before I started working at my company.

I mention the tech thing because there are mostly men around me, and I can’t really beat around the bush. Like you said, I’m not trying to make it a gender thing, but I generally have to tell them (Mainly guys. Please no pitch forks.) exactly what or how I want something done.

I just updated a post any time something happened financially. I'm weird and track random stuff like this. -_- 

I would also start with just adding all of your subscriptions and monthly costs together first if you're new to this. Set a goal of when you want to pay off your debts and whatnot. 

My favorite posts are on /r/personalfinance about people who are in debt and trying to get themselves out. It legit warms my heart when people are trying to help other people. T_T They usually ask for a budget write out, so that's why I started. :3"

financialindependence,fdf2gvs,t1_fdez8oj,1578351794.0,"People will tell you to do research, but this is what I personally did when I first got started. 

**NOTE, this is not me telling you what to do. This is just vaguely what I did, and I still consider myself a financial noob.

To put more insight, I was making around 60-70k around this time. All of my debt (besides my house) is paid off, so I had some extra money hanging around.

1. Opened up a Roth IRA in March 2017. 

2. Maxed out $5k (max at the time) for 2016. (You have until April of the next year I think. I honestly think you should max out your Roth IRA for the 2019 if you have 6k laying around. Or less. Anything before April, really. You have until April of next year to decide if you want to max out for 2020.)
3. Used my bonus to max out Roth IRA for 2017. Learned that I have to actually put my money into stuff. I got ETFs when I first started and put into VOO.
4. Around July 2017, increased 4% (company matching) 401k to 10%.
5. Around July 2017, got into Robinhood (app that let's you trade stocks for free). My team at work had this little contest on who could turn $100 into $120 first. I lost of course, but this taught me a lot about how to buy, sell, and different terms like dividends. (I literally knew nothing about stocks.)
6. DON'T DO THIS LOL, but around July 2017, I bought 1 bitcoin for around $2k or something.
7. I was consumed into crypto for a good minute. I'm only putting this in here because this got me into investing more in other stuff. I learned about manipulation through media, about how I shouldn't time the market. I got slapped around a few times, got a little excited over my gains, and got sad about losses or missed opportunities. Anyway, I made back what I put in and still own some BTC and other coins today. What it really taught me was patience. Also, it kind of sealed the deal that I'd rather be a patient and safer investor.
8. Around the beginning of 2018, I increased my 401k match from 10% to 15%. 
9. I set 10% of my bonus into my 401k.
10. I set my Vanguard to deposit $458 a month into my Roth IRA.
11. I started buying a share of Apple, Microsoft, etc. every month. If I had extra money, I would buy some random shares here and there.
12. I think mid 2018, I increased my 401k from 15% to 20%. 
13. In 2019, I think I made a plan to only have 15% into my 401k and put more money into stocks. 

Okay, I kind of forgot a lot of stuff to be honest.


But if I were you, I'd keep track of my finances so you can one day post here and inspire us all. Keep track of how much you owe and how much you make and the difference. That really kept me going. I got into this weird high. 

Vaguely, around the beginning of 2017, my net was like 25k or something. I calculated the other day, and I currently stand at: 

 | 401k | IRA | HSA | Stocks | Cash | Net Total
---|---|----|----|----|----|----
**January** |$87,828| $28,240 | $8,279| $19,265 | $4,116 | $147,728

Honestly, I'm not sure if this helps you at all, but every time I felt discouraged, especially around August-January, when I'm feeling like I have no money, I go to this sub for inspiration and try to push myself.

Another thing is, I kind of live my best life, but I have a budget for everything. I post this on my private sub-reddit on my alt account. But it looks like this. Not sure if this is TMI.

financialindependence,fdezn7t,t1_fdeymnw,1578350012.0,"tldr: Paranoia and hoarder mindset?

!tldr:
Our parents are Vietnamese, and for some reason, they're paranoid of leaving money in the bank. To be completely honest, it's most likely because of tax reasons. Also, it's pretty common for first generation Vietnamese to hoard stuff (that's not money), as well. But this mentality has stuck with my siblings and I. I think it's pretty common for other families as well. My friend is Vietnamese, and her whole family hides money somewhere that isn't the bank.

My brother is the same way in that he keeps all of his money in a bank account (not for tax reasons), instead of investing it. He says he likes to see the money pile up. When I tried to talk to him about compound interest, he wouldn't accept anything said he doesn't need to invest anything because he's going to die before he's 65. (He just turned 30, sigh.) I'm pretty sure it's a defense to keep money? I don't know why. He also blows money on strictly car stuff, so it's whatever. My little sister was doing the same by leaving like 90k in her savings account, and I helped her open up a Roth IRA this last week. They literally just have a similar mindset of my mom, thinking they have to hoard their cash? She gave me full control of her Vanguard, and I set up a auto-deposit of $500 a month to max it out this year. 

Also, I was like this up until 3 years ago too. I just kept a lot of cash because it gave me some ego boost, but now I'm cash poor and investment rich. (I'm not rich. That's just a saying.) But I have to admit I was pretty hard headed about it as well."
financialindependence,fdeyfxe,t3_ekr2tv,1578349264.0,"I'm in a discord with 5 other girls, and they used to not be so financially literate. I got into finance about three years ago now, and I'm just shocked about the growth since then. The girls in the discord have different backgrounds. One of them is a struggling college student. One of them works on a farm and intends to turn that into a 100k a year profit after the first two years. One of them works and has over 60k cash in the back of her closet. One of them runs an anime art business making over 100k. I'm kind of in the middle of all of them, and I started teaching them about finance. Like little things. And now I feel like they're starting to be a lot more educated. It just makes me proud. T_T The other day, my boyfriend said that usually women aren't financially literate after I was talking about how proud I was of myself, and I was like, ""WHAT. YEAH WE ARE!... ^oh ^maybe ^not"".

Then I thought about it, and many of my female friends, no matter how much they make and how little/no debt they have, don't really know much about finance. Sometimes, they'll complain about how they're living paycheck to paycheck, and I'll offer advice, but they don't want it? I wonder if this is just a human thing, not a woman thing. Or they want to vent but not have any advice? Anyway, I'm glad that my team at work taught me a lot about money, and they're very transparent about everything. I'm also happy about being able to help people who want to learn too. I'm always here for them whenever, and I always want to help a brother/sister out. :3"
financialindependence,fdevk06,t1_fdeu9pk,1578347494.0,"There's a sidebar in /r/personalfinance that can help get you started.

I think a few people are going to tell you that if you were okay with living on 33k a year, then don't make it your mindset that you now make the extra 20k.

Also, it depends on the interest rates on your school debt. If it's a low percentage, then make minimum payments.

Right now, you'll at least want to contribute up to matching at your company, and open up a Roth IRA and max that out yearly (6k)."

I also love streetwear, and Puma is really stepping up their game. I'll probably be buying more just because I believe in their band growing. They've been getting popular quite lately, and I see people wearing it a lot more often. Also, I'm not sure if it's that effect, where you just see it more because you notice more.

Also, I calculated my net worth this morning. It's weird. Last year, my net worth at the end of the year (albeit not that great of a year tbh) was around 80k. I think it was around there. Now, I'm at $147k, not including my condo or BTC. Only retirement/stocks/cash. I don't think I made much of a difference either. Still thinking how I want to budget this year.

It’s on YouTube too. :3"
konmari,fckkj1n,t1_fcjn1rq,1577727327.0,"She kept saying she was tired (started before we even started). I kept saying I organized it, so it will be easier. I think organizing it by color and type of clothing really helps because if she has the same stuff, it’s a lot easier to get rid of the duplicates. I also showed her that she had the same three shirts, and we ended up keeping the one with the tag. When she said she likes to wear something but it’s itchy or too short so she hasn’t worn it in a while, I was just like “Let’s get rid of it then.” I explained to her that even if you have five of the same looking shirts, which ones do you always pick? Because if you have like five similar shirts, and you only wear two of them, you’ll never wear the other ones when you re-wash the first two. It’s obvious that the first who are her favorites? If that makes sense. 


The hardest part is actually starting, and it really gets a lot easier from there. I literally held up every piece of clothing my mom had one-by-one asking her if she liked it. If she was for sure, I’d put that back on the top rack. When it was a meh, I’d put it on the bottom rack. Then I’d cycle through the meh ones after everything was done. I don’t think she ever got paralysis from doing it. After the clothing, she just started randomly getting rid of stuff around the house. Put them in a box and brought them to the thrift shop herself. Made me proud. ;-;

But yeah. Before that, the excuses kept coming. Literally saying that’s new! I just bought that! What am going to wear in the summer? What am I going to wear in the winter? You want me to look like I have no clothes? Etc. Sounds like your mom can be quite frustrating if she’s “researching”. I don’t know what I’d do at that point because I’m not trying to get hit. LOL. But actually, if she was my mom, I’d just ask her for some of her time (even if it’s a little just to get started) or ask if she likes something while she’s next to her computer. Try starting with the scarves if she has a lot of them. For me, I’d probably start with the ones that aren’t even on trend and ask if she likes those more. I pulled all of my mom’s cheaply-made looking clothes before all the others because I told her her other clothes looks more expensive and whatnot. (This actually goes a long way in Asian families, I think. Kind of teaches them quality over quantity, too.) Anything that was stained or had holes on them were pretty safe to get rid of too. 

Another point to make is if she sees how much stuff you’re getting rid of out of your own clothing, she might think you want her to get rid of as much stuff. 

I offered the clothes up on the city’s “free” Facebook page. I just took a picture of the get rid of pile and posted “If anyone wants this, please pick up by today, else everything is getting donated.” Dude, for real. The faster the stuff gets out of your house, the less of a burden you feel. When I was konmaring for myself, I kept saying I was going to sell this or give this to someone or donate this to this or I know someone who could use this. I would literally just drive around with so much of my things in my car forever. Maybe months. Although I know I could’ve sold a lot of stuff on Depop, I also knew I was way too lazy. And once you start taking pictures to sell stuff on depop or poshmark, you realize no one is going to buy something and the article of clothing isn’t even cute to begin with. Personally, I would just sort them into where you want them to go, then just get rid of them the day of. It really keeps your mom from going through the clothing again to keep stuff when she second guesses her choices. 

It depends on where you live, but the lady who picked up the clothing gave it to a women’s homeless shelter. All the smaller stuff, she donated to the children’s lighthouse thrift store. For myself, I donate to this thrift shop called “Hidden Treasures”. It’s run by a bunch of retired people, and they price their clothing and stuff really low. (Which is how I think it should be.) I sometimes don’t like to donate to goodwill because they price gouge so much. I mean, I shouldn’t care where my clothes ends up after that, but it’s whatever. Just get it out of your house ASAP. 

For the clothes with your name on it, if it’s your full name, then I would probably give it to HM recycling thing. Even though I just found out they don’t really recycle it? I don’t know actually. Might have to go a google search on that one. I never actually wear clothing that personal after I got rid of my high school and college shirts with my name on them too. If I donated it, personally, I wouldn’t mind if someone wore my name.

Gosh, I hope I answered everything."
