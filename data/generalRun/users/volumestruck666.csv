I know it hurts man. It’s hard to recover from. But you can. You were a kid, absolutely none of that is any of your fault. Try therapy if you can, it helps so much."

Advice,fffi7sa,t1_fffhhd3,1579884516.0,"I don’t really care- it’s decent advice and I certainly don’t need credit for it.

However it’s very very much circumstantial. I have another addict in my family- the former addict’s son, actually- and giving him any support whatsoever leads to him taking advantage and becoming angry and violent. We have had to completely cut contact with him for long periods of time because he’s genuinely malicious. We still keep in touch here and there and send him just enough money to get food (usually in the form of gift cards so it’s harder for him to use it on drugs), but the above advice did not work for him. My dad was an addict MANY years ago and what sorted him out was joining the military and getting his ass whooped. 

Addiction is such a complex illness and there’s never an answer that goes across the board. 

I gave that answer because her brother doesn’t seem to have malicious intent- he hasn’t damaged any of her property, he’s not making threats and it doesn’t seem like he’s demanding or stealing money. For addicts like that who are younger and aren’t malicious in nature, maintaining some form of support, in my experience, is effective.

The ones who get to the point of lying, stealing and making threats are much harder to deal with and even hazardous. I’ve got no issue with you using that advice but make sure there’s nothing mentioning any sort of threatening or extremely manipulative behavior in the post. That’s the point where it becomes hazardous and damaging to the family to keep being extremely supportive."
Advice,fffh2mv,t3_etcozi,1579883807.0,"You are not “easily triggered”, your boyfriend has horrible unresolved issues and he is taking them out on your relationship.

I’m not one to judge but a man who instantly falls back to destructive tendencies when something goes wrong is not a man who needs to have a child in the household. You have serious unresolved problems and clearly fight a lot. If your child grows up in that environment, he will be traumatized and messed up for life. 

I’m gonna be honest- it sounds like you’re in a shitty situation with a shitty man, even if you love him. But having a child changes things. Your feelings are no longer that important- the safety and well-being of your child comes FIRST. You raise a kid with a father whose cheating on you with men, constantly fighting with you, and has serious trauma, your child will suffer. The kid will listen to you fight and scream and find out about the cheating. Your man will continue to find NEW destructive tendencies every time he gets over an old one until he gets professional help.

You need to take your kid and get the HELL out of there before you traumatize that kid and further traumatize yourself. You’re clearly blinded by your love but any man who can have sex with another person after someone delivers his goddamn child isn’t worth shit. Your child doesn’t deserve to be raised by a meth head who fights with his mom. 

Only go back if he goes to therapy. Wait until he’s been going for at LEAST a few MONTHS and you notice him CHANGING. Some people can’t change. Men like him usually don’t change for a very long time. Don’t make yourself suffer to be with a guy who can’t keep his life together at all and expects you to be ok with it. If y’all get back together you need to eventually go to therapy together.

I can’t force you to leave. But this shit is toxic. He is NOT equipped to be in a healthy relationship and even less equipped to be a father if he’s suicidal, self destructive, and sleeping with other men. Run."
Advice,fffgcet,t1_fff977m,1579883355.0,"I can’t tell if this comment is sarcastic or genuine but I’ll give you your answer I suppose. 

We never stopped being there for him. We answered his calls and helped him out when he was desperately in need, we made sure someone was able to give him a place to crash once he agreed to *try* and get clean. Eventually, We had to lay down rules and cut him off financially and give him an ultimatum for him to finally agree to go to rehab. We reminded him of his kids, etc, and he did what had to be done. Now he’s pretty much permanently “damaged” from the drugs he did and he’s kind of slow, but he’s been clean for 5 years and he works with churches and whatnot. He went from being addicted to drugs to being addicted to religion, but at least he got clean."
Advice,ffeixuf,t3_et6tdv,1579849897.0,"A few things to consider-

Will they be compensating your for your gas money?

If not, how many miles per gallon do you get, and how much does gas cost near you? Calculate your total gas cost for that distance, multiply it by however many days a week you’ll be working. Then subtract it from your weekly salary to see how much money you’ll have left over. As long as you make more than your current job (minus gas money) you should be fine.

Also, will they give you consistent or better hours compared to your current job?

How early will you have to wake up to be there on time? If you’re not a morning person this could be a serious dealbreaker.

Will this job be more ENJOYABLE? Money isn’t worth much when you’re unhappy.

You need more info lol. As long as your gas or transportation costs won’t be insane and you’re still making more (minus gas) than at your previous job, you enjoy this new job, and you don’t hate driving, it’s probably a good deal."

Advice,ffehm4a,t3_et68n3,1579848341.0,"I do the same thing and I feel the same way. At the end of the day you’ve gotta push through. It’ll be worth it.

If you can, go to therapy and talk to someone about how you’re feeling. More importantly, talk to a school counselor or trusted teacher at your school if you have one. They may be able to help accommodate you or give you advice to help you get through the remainder of school.

I skipped a whole lot of school because I felt sad or overwhelmed and at the end of the day it made it worse- it became hard for me to keep up with class and I constantly had homework and class work to make up. It made my grades and my mental health suffer. The best thing you can do is get up tomorrow, put on some clothes you like, eat a nice breakfast, and drag yourself out the door, no matter how daunting it is. Once you get in the building and start doing what you gotta do, it’ll likely suck, but it will get better.

It’s only a few years of your life and you CAN get through it. The most important thing to remember with procrastinating and avoiding is that it doesn’t matter if you’re feeling motivated or not- you gotta try and develop the discipline to make yourself do things you aren’t motivated to do, especially when doing things you don’t like will make life turn out better for you. School is really so very important. There’s no magic button to motivate yourself or develop discipline- the first step is to drag yourself out of bed, make the bed, get dressed, and go. From there you just gotta put one foot in front of the other and find small things through the day to make you happy, wether that’s friends, hobbies, TV shows, maybe even just a good book. But give yourself little things to enjoy, and do your best to power through.

But try not to beat yourself up for being burnt out. It happens to everyone and it’s not cuz you’re lazy, it’s because you’re a human and high school is hard sometimes. That’s just life. 

You’ve got this, and I can’t stress this enough- try and get a personal therapist or talk to a school counselor or teacher. Adults in education don’t want to see you fail, they want to see you succeed, and they will likely do what they can to help you. Good luck."
Advice,ffeh5zt,t3_et6d7a,1579847834.0,"Tbh, finding him may bring you closure, but with a generic name like that it’ll probably be difficult. On top of that, he’s likely moved on in his life and you unfortunately may not get a reaction that makes you happy, and he may be bothered that you tracked him down, especially if you do it through Reddit and expose his personal information. If someone he knows stumbles across it and maybe he doesn’t want them to know he dated a man or had an online relationship, that might make it worse.

Maybe you can find him. Keep looking yourself if you think you need that. But in the meantime you need to aim to come to peace with what happened, understand that you can’t change it, and most of all, understand that it made you a better person. You’ve learned from your mistakes and become a stronger and better person instead of letting it ruin you, and you should try to convince yourself that’s enough without seeking out the validation of speaking to him again.

Best of luck."
Advice,ffegw94,t1_ffeg9lo,1579847532.0,"Honestly, I should have been in therapy and talking about my issues before any of that stuff happened. Once I hit that point, the only thing that really helped is when I got thrown into a psychiatric hospital. 

I’ve been thinking about this myself though, what could’ve helped me at the time, and I don’t know. If my parents had told me “it’s just a phase” I probably would have gotten more stubborn and continued with it for much longer, so I can’t do that.

All that helped was getting away from my toxic and LGBT obsessed friend group, getting a therapist who looked past the gender issues, and the support of my family without pressuring or questioning me. Basically the answer might be that there’s physically nothing I can do and she has to work it out herself. This whole thing is just overwhelming for me though and the idea of doing nothing and watching her go down that road is distressing."
Advice,ffego73,t3_et6ef8,1579847288.0,"If you can call in sick and stay home with him, I would.

When he sobers up, it may be in your best interest to let him know that he needs to get help and straighten himself out and that you won’t sacrifice your personal wellbeing to help him compensate for his mistakes. Nothing wrong with helping out a sibling. You need to be there for him, especially if your parents aren’t, but you need to set your own limits. 

If he needs to crash for a while so be it, but you need to lay out ground rules if he would like to stay with you for any period of time. No leaving the house without notifying you, no drugs in your residence whatsoever, etc. If he violates that then remove him from the property and tell him he can come back when he’s ready to follow your rules and get the help he needs.

My older brother was an addict and when my dad didn’t lay out ground rules and stick to them, my brother ended up taking advantage of him. I don’t know your brother or his situation but you’re not obligated to let him use you or disrespect you just because you’re related. Do what you can to keep him out of trouble but you’re not Superman and you can’t baby him forever.

If you can call off, talk to him about what’s going on and how he’s feeling, why he’s making these choices, etc. Try and help him research local rehab centers and see if you can get him to check into one. If not, lay out the ground rules for being in your house and let him know you’ll boot his ass if he doesn’t follow them. It sucks, he is suffering and addiction is a hard illness to cope with as a family member, but you can only do so much.  Love him, support him, but give him a reason to heal. 

If this becomes a recurrent issue I’d go to therapy to get professional advice and make sure you’re taking care of your own mental health while you’re dealing with his.

What you need to understand is you can not control your own feelings. You’ve done nothing wrong- this shit just happens sometimes. That’s life. What you also need to understand is that, no matter what you do or when you do it, he will be hurt and it will be very hard for him. But at the end of the day he will come out of it a stronger person and he will be able to move on and find someone who loves him the same way he loves them. The hurt is inevitable, but him getting better is also inevitable.

The best choice is to end things now and to be firm. Don’t let him bargain or plead with you or you will give in. Go see him briefly with a way to leave quickly. Tell him you appreciate him and he’s done nothing wrong but you don’t feel the same as you used to and that both of you need to move on, and that the relationship is over. He will likely try and bargain and plead with you but you need to give yourself just a few minutes of strength to get up, walk away, and go home.

Advice,ff0thqx,t3_eqyle2,1579472121.0,"If I were you I’d take that gap year.

You are pretty young and I’d hardly call it wasting time if you make it productive. You’ve got years and years ahead of you and one year wouldn’t be the worst thing ever. The trick is to use that year to productively better yourself as a person and save as much cash as you can. 

Use that year to work and save as much money as you can. I’d really recommend that you Volunteer for a cause you’re passionate about, or maybe a few of them. You may be surprised and discover a new passion. Maybe you’ll decide you don’t even want to go to college or maybe for a different major. Or most likely it’ll just keep you occupied and help you feel fulfilled.

Even more importantly, if you’re still set on going to college, spend that year applying for as many scholarships as you can. Don’t leave any stone unturned. Look for local scholarships too- some medical offices and other companies offer scholarships to local high schoolers. Apply to EVERYTHING you see just to make sure you’ve covered all possible bases. 

If you don’t take that gap year, you need to think long and hard about your priorities. I don’t know what university is like in Australia, but at the end of the day a degree from a fancy college and a degree from a “normal” one will both give you the same credentials and there won’t be a huge difference in job opportunities after graduation. I’m sure it’s a lovely school but if living with your grandparents isn’t worth it, which it might not be, your life will turn out perfectly fine regardless of where you go. The added stress of living with a psycho woman is going to make college harder- I don’t think one university is gonna be worth all that. You’re better off looking for somewhere you can live on campus or with your parents thats affordable with small class sizes (1 on 1 assistance with the teacher is a blessing in any education)."

But if someone who has a penis would like to have intercourse with someone who has a penis, then that is the literal definition of homosexual. It’s not wrong, it doesn’t make her any less of a woman, but talking purely about physical sexuality with gender identity aside, wanting to have sex with someone who has the same genitals as you means that you are literally homosexual, by definition.

If you’d like to *date* someone who is trans then that’s a straight relationship. But if they haven’t physically transitioned, and you’re attracted to them in a sexual manner, then the sex you’re having is obviously not straight sex.

Honestly just keep yourself busy with relaxing activities. I get pretty sad when I’m just sitting around on weekends. We’re at the age where we’re preparing for adulthood and pretty constantly busy, so it’s very hard to reprogram yourself to relax.

My strategies are hobbies like art where I can sit and “relax” but still occupy my mind so I’m not thinking about stressful things, and actually, as dumb as it sounds, yoga, working out, and meditating. Meditating is hard to learn but if you get it right it can be quite nice to put yourself in a headspace where you’re relaxed.

Honestly though, it doesn’t sound like you’re depressed, just stressed. 17 is a rough age with the whole end of high school thing, it puts everyone on edge. I’d also like to note that it’s winter time and many people experience “seasonal depression”.

Advice,fe49lht,t3_enrgd5,1578857070.0,"I’m 17 and I’ve been on birth control since I was 14 through my mother.

Your first step needs to be talking to her. It’s daunting, yes, but you won’t know unless you try. I don’t know your mom or her attitude about sex, but if she’s fairly open minded, you can at least hope she’ll understand. She’s your mother and hopefully your welfare is a priority for her.

Personally I’d sit down with her and start by saying that you trust your partner and that you feel like if you do end up having sex you want to be safe rather than sorry and you’d rather be open with her than try to hide it- establish that you trust her, your significant other, and your own decisions. Then, make sure she knows you will be using condoms in addition to birth control so she knows you’re not going to be making super risky choices for no reason at your age. 

If she says yes, awesome. Don’t be nervous for the doctor’s appointment, they will not judge you, and also understand that some birth controls really don’t work out so it might be trial and error to find one without side effects.

If she says no, look up your local laws. In most if not all of the United States, you can actually see a doctor for STD tests, birth control, and pregnancy reasons without ever having to tell your parents. The problem there is that unless you pay out of pocket, it will show up on your insurance. You can also go to planned parenthood and may be able to get it for cheap or for free.

Worst case scenario you wait until you’re 18 and either hold off or use condoms until then.

Even if you do go on birth control, it’s never ever 100% effective. Please do not trust it completely no matter what your partner says. USE. CONDOMS. WITH IT. This will protect you not only from STD’s but it’ll make sure you’re not risking pregnancy for no reason. If your partner says condoms are uncomfortable or he doesn’t wanna use them, tell him that unless he’s ready to be a dad, he needs to shut up and deal with it. If he’s got a latex allergy, there’s lots of non latex condoms. No excuses for having sex without condoms at your age- it’s never worth it.

You are legitimately in serious danger. You need to wait until you know he will be gone for a while, pack what you can, and go stay with a parent, friend or other relative until you figure out the lease situation. Have someone with you who you trust while you’re leaving in case he shows up and gets angry. No amount of money is worth sacrificing your safety and as long as he feels like you’re trapped there with him and not giving him what he wants, the angrier he will probably get. Don’t tell him where you are when you do leave, and make sure several people know about the situation. Contact your landlord and explain what’s going on, and after that it would be best to get law enforcement involved, or find some other way to document the abuse. That way if he starts stalking you, it’ll be easier for you to take legal action.

Advice,fe1jr88,t1_fe1b1q5,1578827409.0,"So what’s your plan to make this happen exactly? Outlaw breeding of reptiles? Good freaking luck.

Reptiles in captivity are pretty important in educating the general public about a very misunderstood type of animal. Also, if you ban one animal, how can you justify people keeping dogs? Cats? Hamsters? Rabbits? Where do you draw the line? You can’t make that argument unless you are legitimately saying people can’t keep animals, period.

If the animal isn’t wild caught or endangered, you can’t suggest it’s unethical to keep them as pets because they “might be uncomfortable”. Dogs and cats might be uncomfortable living in homes. But same as reptiles, they can’t speak human language, so who knows.

As long as their needs are met space, nutrition, and environment wise, reptiles are content in captivity as far as they know. Of course there’s assholes out there who can’t/ won’t meet those needs, but there’s people who abuse cats and dogs too. A few bad apples shouldn’t be able to ruin things for the whole bunch.

I’d also like to add that people projecting human emotions into animals is literally the *worst*. Reptiles cannot feel emotions the same way we can, at all. They can’t even feel the same emotions mammals like dogs and cats can. Humans just really, really, really love looking at the world as if all species feel the same as them. So, yeah, I can’t imagine living in a box would be great either- but I’m also not a reptile, I’m a human. Do they feel complex emotion? Absolutely. Do they feel it in the same way or for the same reasons we do? Not at all.

As far as we know, if kept properly, reptiles don’t show signs of distress. Reptiles are very notorious for showing signs of stress through physical illness- if you stress a leopard gecko, it’ll drop its tail. If you stress a bearded dragon, it’ll display aggressive behavior. If you stress a snake, it will refuse to eat. The universal sign of stress in reptiles is typically lethargy, sometimes aggression, and refusal to eat is equally common. It’s pretty easy to figure out if they’re stressed or not.

The number one cause of stress in reptiles from my personal experience and the experience of many others is an improper environment or diet. But my animals are pretty solid proof that if given an adequate environment and proper diet, reptiles can thrive in captivity. In the very least, they don’t show any behavioral or physical symptoms of distress. 

Basically, while I get why you think that way, saying those things perpetuates myths about reptile keeping and reptile behavior that simply aren’t true. They’re just fine."
Advice,fe0z36c,t1_fe0tvzs,1578820596.0,"Yeah, I totally see your point.

I’m actually already giving one of them away to a good friend who is experienced and will take amazing care of him. I can’t quite meet his needs the way I’d like, so I’m giving him to someone I trust that can meet his needs perfectly. Even without the snake, one of them is already going to a new home. So basically I’m making this choice over the gecko. 

If I can find someone I know and trust, I’d consider it, because as long as he is with a responsible home and I know he’s loved and cared for, I do not mind giving him up- I actually rescued him with the intention of finding him a new home but couldn’t find anyone at the time. 

For the record, reptiles don’t feel love- I’m not sure if you were implying that he would “miss me”, but he wouldn’t. The only reason reptiles like their owners is literally because of survival association. Their brains don’t work like ours. The only thing he would notice is that the other owner smells different. A lot of people like to project human emotions on to reptiles but it is physically impossible for them to feel the range of emotions that we do. So he wouldn’t mind at all or even notice anything- I’m just worried about my feelings lol."
Advice,fe0yb6f,t1_fe0th2i,1578820220.0,"... people like you drive me absolutely freaking nuts. Please educate yourself on reptile keeping before you speak.

Every single one of my animals has been bred in captivity. If I released them, they would die. They have evolved over decades of captive breeding to live in captivity, not in the wild- they cannot hunt for food or find shelter. None of them can. They would die within hours, releasing them would be an absolute death sentence and you’re ignorant about animals if you think otherwise.

They are given food and water, large habitats, and more than enough time to explore around my house. I’d also like to point out that reptiles don’t feel emotions the same way humans do- their brains are wired completely differently. Things that would be upsetting to humans are completely not bothersome to most reptiles. Being in captivity, as long as they’re properly cared for, doesn’t impact them at all.

Unfortunately some reptiles are caught from the wild and kept as pets, but I do not support that. I have had wild caught animals in the past that I rescued from stores or owners who were not able to take care of them, but I couldn’t release them either. Once you keep an animal in captivity, especially from a young age, it will no longer be able to survive in the wild. Once it has been removed from the wild, there is pretty much no going back.

Also, I live in the United States. Two of the species I have are native to Australia and one of them to Indonesia. I couldn’t release them even if I wanted to.

Go read up on reptiles in captivity from a source other than PETA, please."
Advice,fe0x4l2,t3_enl0wh,1578819706.0,"This is really complicated, but I think I can give you some input as someone who has been on both sides of this sort of relationship.

I had some depression related issues for almost my entire life. Thankfully it didn’t manifest in most of my relationships, but in one of them, it did. When I got really bad, I started lashing out, or over dramatically seeking comfort from my partner that he wasn’t able to provide without stressing himself out. I realize this in hindsight, but when i started getting really bad, it was hard for him to be my only support system. At first it wasn’t so bad, but over time it became more problematic. When I had really bad episodes it was increasingly hard for him to handle- it felt like he had a huge “burden” on him that he absolutely couldn’t help with because, even though he loved me and wanted nothing more than to be supportive, he also isn’t a therapist, nor was he equipped to handle issues like that on his own. It eventually spiraled and we broke up for other reasons, but I believe that me refusing to get help and not having any other reliable people to support me contributed to a lot of our issues.

For me, and it’s not the same for everyone, I refused treatment because it made me feel “lesser”, like I was somehow broken and unable to handle myself. For someone who is extremely proud of their independence, which I was, accepting help was really hard and felt almost humiliating. I’m not trying to stereotype, but psychologically speaking, men are significantly more inclined to pretend their fine for the sake of preserving their pride and masculinity, but more importantly, many of them prefer to be the support system for the women in their life and don’t really like the idea of it being the other way around. That’s not always the case, but it’s common and important to consider. Also, when you’ve been depressed for a long time, it becomes your new normal- the thought of it going away often seems pointless and even scary. That’s your reality, and trying to accept that it needs to change can be frustrating. If I were you, I’d start trying to help him work through the reasons why he doesn’t want to get therapy or help before you jump the gun and do anything dramatic. Chances are you may be able to help him rationalize it by stressing that it doesn’t make him lesser at all and that it’s ok not to be ok.

My boyfriend now had some pretty severe depressive issues for the past few years, but he refused to open up to me about them for the same reason I felt bad for my last boyfriend- he really doesn’t want to feel like he is a burden to me. I constantly suggested therapy and he would refuse consistently and insist he was fine. He was in complete and total denial but I’m also not stupid and can see right through that stuff because I’ve been there. 
At the end of the day, we broke up because I couldn’t handle the way he lashed out when he got severely depressed. His case was pretty extreme, but because I have issues myself, I couldn’t stay in a relationship with him unless he got help. We ended up getting back together after we both went to therapy for a while and things are going much smoother.

My advice? Remember first and foremost that even though it’s hard to shake the feeling of responsibility, you are NOT personally responsible for anyone else’s happiness. As someone who has been depressed, I can recognize that over the years I’ve lost a few friends and even partners who couldn’t handle my problems without sacrificing their own happiness. Everyone has a different tolerance level and that wasn’t their fault, nor was it mine. He may not recognize that and if you tell him, he may feel guilt, anger, or both. Guilty for being a “burden”, or angry at you for making him out to be one. 

If this continues and/or gets any worse, you need to handle it very gently and carefully so you don’t make him feel like he is a burden to you, but also draw a line for your own sake. If his depression is manifesting in a way that is harmful to you and your relationship, the best thing to do is sit him down and tell him as much- example: “ I love you, I have absolutely no problem helping you and supporting you and you are NOT burdening me with your problems, but I can see you’re hurting and I feel like it is impacting our relationship. I think that it’s worth working on and I don’t want to give up, but to solve our issues we need to both put in effort, and that means that you need to seek out help for the issues that are causing you to lash out at me. I cannot endure that and be supportive if you’re not willing to acknowledge and try and solve the problem. You don’t need to be happy all the time, you don’t need to magically “get rid of” your depression and I’ll love you all the same, but I need you to try and start healing and coping in a way that won’t negatively effect us as a couple.” Basically suggest therapy as gently as possible while trying to carefully show him that you think it’s impacting the relationship, not just you and not just him.

If it escalates and he keeps lashing out and you feel like it’s starting to consistently bring you down, sometimes you need to walk away or give an ultimatum. If he becomes suicidal you can cal police or his parents, but you aren’t responsible for making his problems better if he doesn’t want to do that at all himself, even if it hurts you.

shittyaquariums,fckp01a,t1_fcknk0t,1577730078.0,"Also, bettas are tropical fish, dumbass. Water that is too cold is insanely stressful for them and they’re pretty sensitive to it. They can survive without a heater, but it’s very very stressful and hard on them. They should never ever be kept without at least a heater.

They also swim very far in the wild and live to explore. What’s the point in getting an animal if your literal only goal is to barely keep it alive instead of trying to help it thrive? Is it that hard to grasp that they need at least 2.5-5 gallons so they can get to actually MOVE, and that a heater isn’t optional because they need a minimum temperature to be even remotely content in their environment?

Filters aren’t really optional either unless you’ve got live plants and you’re regularly doing test strips... they also oxygenate the water and help keep the tank cycling. Water changes help with waste, but not as much with ammonia, oxygen in the water and the nitrogen cycle. You clearly have no understanding whatsoever of a basic aquatic ecosystem or how to maintain it and you have absolutely no business giving your input on fish care if you don’t understand that in the very least.

Bettas can live up to 5 years and I’ve seen a few live a bit past that. I’ve never seen a betta last longer than a year or two in a fishbowl without those things, and they usually are lethargic, discolored, or have torn/messed up fins (all signs of distress). You’d have to be absolutely fucking stupid to think that’s ok. 

I myself kept bettas in that condition when I was younger... then I got educated on basic fish care and upgraded my setups. Even with weekly water changes, none of the bettas I had as a child thrived- they showed common signs of stress and died prematurely. I didn’t know better, but if you WILLINGLY chose to put a betta in those conditions after being repeatedly told and shown factual information that it’s not adequate, you are literally an asshole.
