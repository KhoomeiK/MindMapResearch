loseit,ffigdax,t1_ffi66ba,1579973225.0,This is the correct answer. 1200 is the recommended lowest cal diet a woman should be on because it is very difficult to get sufficient protein and micronutrients eating less. Even at that you should probably be taking supplements. (I take a multivitamin and extra calcium and vitamin D.) Check out r/1200isplenty for support and recipe ideas from fellow short women eating that way for extended periods to lose weight.
fatlogic,ffggla9,t1_fffsppp,1579905764.0,"Hmmm. Wouldn't be the worst idea to integrate PE, health and cooking into one year long class."
loseit,ffdvgxa,t3_esnzc6,1579829933.0,"I feel like there is hope for you because you were willing to come back, fess up, and take your lumps. Most people in your shoes have one big post and are never heard from again. You don't realize how little you have to do to get yourself out of the morbidly obese category. If what you listed is a typical day, eat one less corn dog, one less cheeseburger and one less burrito. You'll be hungry at first but you'll eventually get used to it"
fatlogic,ffa0lpb,t3_es9tum,1579725468.0,Just a misunderstanding. Clearly the person who posted the pictures is one of those rare individuals (less than five percent according to every study ever) who can lose weight by eating less whereas the person making the comment is one of the vast majority (95%?)  who maintains excess weight despite eating normal amounts of healthy food with a very occasional treat due to hormones/medication/disability. Naturally the first person is embarrassed about the before picture while the second person cannot understand how someone would be embarrassed by something so beyond his/her control.
fatlogic,ff6rob0,t1_ff5yedr,1579633463.0,I wish I could find the study. It's only true for Asian and maybe White women that poverty correlates with size. African Americans have the same rate of obesity no matter their economic status and White and Asian men get fatter the richer they are.
keto,ff6ns3z,t3_erw1v1,1579631134.0,"If you cook at home and normally eat a protein (steak, fish, chicken, etc.), a vegetable and a carb, delete the carb, add another vegetable. If you don't cook at home, lettuce wrapped burgers and sandwiches, protein bowls from chipotle or wherever else does them, omelets, steaks, roasted chicken, BBQ meat without sauce, any place that grills fish and has salad or plain vegetable sides. You will be missing your carbs for at least a month, but once you power through it gets easier."
keto,ff6alus,t3_ertzhz,1579622992.0,You need to get some lite salt or potassium salt and drink 1/4 teaspoon of that with 24 ounces of water once or twice a day plus buy magnesium citrate capsules and take one or two of those per day. I felt like you in the beginning. Once I start doing that I felt much better.
weightwatchers,ff67bgm,t1_ff4bsf9,1579620845.0,You're so right. Dropping them into boiling water for a few minutes works better than steaming.
keto,ff62pj7,t3_ersq0d,1579617633.0,"I will never say a bad word about Dr. Fung because listening to his lectures is the main reason I got to where I am today, but he can't be 100% right about everything. Nobody is.

Edit:  Well 40% Dr. Fung, 40% this sub, 20% other :)"
fatlogic,ff4ge9s,t1_ff3zpnu,1579562976.0,"I'm sure they exercise more than me or have jobs where they're on their feet all day. I had a desk job. Now I'm retired. My exercise is mostly walking and yoga and occasional light weights. My maintenance is around 1800, maybe a bit more. Calculators say 1650 for someone of my age and height and sedentary."
weightwatchers,ff3ymay,t1_ff3y947,1579551700.0,Me neither. I got it out of Bon Apetit magazine years ago. Steamed vegetables and hummus quickly became my favorite thing to bring to parties.
fatlogic,ff3y0jl,t1_ff3quqy,1579551323.0,"Not really. At 5'8"", 2000 calories/day would have me gaining steadily unless I exercise pretty strenuously."
weightwatchers,ff3qsaf,t3_erha2g,1579546843.0,"Have you tried them very lightly steamed (2-4 minutes and then into an ice water bath)?  Does wonders for broccoli, cauliflower, green beans and even carrots."
lowcarb,ff3htnv,t1_ff3e7na,1579541345.0,Weight loss is dependent on consuming fewer calories than you you expend. Being in ketosis makes that easier for many people but you can lose weight on any type of diet.
lowcarb,ff3hhfl,t1_ff38c50,1579541133.0,Why not?  I can't find anything on what happens when you go in and out over the course of a day.
fatlogic,ff00jor,t1_feyycv4,1579463879.0,I eat one tablespoon of peanut butter per day. That's my story and I'm sticking to it.
fatlogic,fezxx1o,t1_fey9eld,1579463122.0,Cronometer is pretty honest. I input an hour of yoga (counting the 5 minutes at the end where you lie flat in your back) and it gives me less than 100 calories.
fatlogic,fezvq7l,t1_fezc8vb,1579462278.0,"Back when calorie counting apps were just starting to be a thing, I bought my fitness pal and input everything I ate for a while, wondering why I was gaining year after year despite eating mostly healthy, unprocessed food. Sure enough I was 100-200 calories over maintenance almost every day. Took me years to finally do something about it though."
loseit,feu681f,t1_feoug21,1579383487.0,The recommendation is 1 gram of protein for every pound of lean body mass. You aren't getting any at breakfast and don't specify any at lunch or dinner. I don't actually know what happens if you don't get enough though. Lose muscle maybe.
loseit,feo2w97,t3_eq24ze,1579294396.0,I'm eating at maintenance and weighing myself every day. My weight fluctuates up to three pounds for no reason whatsoever. Try weighing again tomorrow or the next day. I bet you it will be down.
loseit,fenm2j2,t1_femfsm5,1579287592.0,I'm glad it works for you but it doesn't sound like you're getting enough protein.
keto,fenh1rs,t3_eq177b,1579284520.0,"Fingers retain fat just like the rest of your body. I lost a ring size, but only at the end. Whatever bloat you've got will be pretty much gone the first few weeks. After that comes the fat loss, and that will be slow and steady."
loseit,fends8u,t1_fem4r6d,1579282525.0,"TDEE calculators generally estimate some level of activity such as walking around work so if you input all your steps, you'll be double counting. Your body can sustain itself pretty well digesting its own fat as long as you get enough protein, water and micronutrients."
fatlogic,feluypj,t3_epp4wg,1579231582.0,"If you represent 75% of the population, we are the oppressed minority and you should watch what you say around us."
diet,fel0427,t3_eppeaz,1579211204.0,"Calculate your TDEE (total daily energy expenditure) based on being sedentary (unless you have a job that keeps you on your feet all day. Then you can be mildly active.) Download a calorie counting app. Input what you eat using a food scale whenever possible. Aim to eat 15-20% less than your TDEE every day. Recalculate TDEE as you lose weight. Don't drink your calories. Sodas and juices have little nutrition and won't fill you up. If just eating less doesn't work for you, i.e., you just can't stick to it, look into diets that restrict when you eat (fasting, intermittent fasting) or diets that restrict what you eat (keto, Atkins, low carb, paleo, vegan, etc.)"
fatlogic,feklpq2,t1_fekghqk,1579202661.0,I was the same. Started the keto/low carb diet on something of a lark in January 2018. I was pretty strict for the first year. Now I can take sweets or leave them.  There is a piece of cheesecake in the refrigerator that I bought a couple days ago to support a new bakery that opened in the area. I literally have one bite of it per day and genuinely do not want any more.
loseit,fekh086,t1_fejkj7s,1579199859.0,When I calculated my TDEE for the first time in my 60's I put in different ages because I was sure younger gals were able to eat tons more than me. There was barely any difference.
keto,feiakfp,t1_fei360k,1579134001.0,It was an . . . interesting read.
loseit,fei7k1m,t3_ep79dg,1579132041.0,"Two years ago I was pushing 170, not that far into overweight territory for my height (5'8""). I exercised regularly and mostly ate home cooked unprocessed food, and the extra weight was in a layer all over my body so I thought of myself as pretty healthy. My husband and I started a low carb diet, mostly for him or so I thought since he had the bad kind of fat that settled around his middle. We both dropped around 30 pounds and guess what?  I feel much better, healthier, more energetic. Maybe you will too."
loseit,fehsiwm,t3_ep7z2g,1579123008.0,"My husband and I managed to lose weight while eating out a lot. We share everything to save calories (and money) but I take it your SO is not of that inclination. If you know you're going out for an extravagant dinner, eat as little as possible the rest of the day. Soup or salad are your best appetizers, or skip the appetizer entirely if the restaurant serves a full course dinner. For the main course either pick the lowest cal option or pick something rich and save at least half for another meal. I got a lot of work lunches out of our dinners out. Dessert?  Probably going to have to skip it and hope your sweetie will give you a bite of his unless you're willing to spend a fortune for some berries and whipped cream. Fast food?  Skip the carbs. A lettuce wrapped burger or sandwich or taco bowl over lettuce can be quite tasty and no one looks at you twice for ordering it anymore.  Diet drinks, water or unsweetened ice tea only. You are at a point right now where you can turn it all around. Think how bad you will feel if you gain it all back."
keto,fehmud7,t1_fehd3bp,1579119746.0,"No problem.  A lot of people ask this question because they read about others losing a ton of weight the first month. I'm like you. I hardly lost anything at first despite peeing like a pregnant mare and expecting to at least lose some water weight.  But I kept on, had some good months and bad months, and reached my goal within a year. You're doing fine. Keep it up."
ketoscience,fef3mgt,t1_feemrhp,1579047391.0,Thanks. I'll look for it.
fatlogic,fef3ity,t3_eotnc6,1579047323.0,It would be fine if they focused on how they felt and taking good care of themselves but they don't seem to want to do that either.
ketoscience,feemfns,t3_eolrtp,1579036717.0,Interesting article. It quotes a cardiologist who admits keto doesn't always lead to higher cholesterol and says that he recommends keto for some of his overweight patients.
fatlogic,fee4h1v,t1_fed8zgj,1579026205.0,"Exactly. A person might develop type 2 for reasons unrelated to a bad diet, but the first thing they better do after diagnosis is engage in ""disordered eating"" by giving up sugar and carbs."
fatlogic,fedxb27,t1_fedmrkd,1579021856.0,I think the point was to list diets that seem to work without calorie counting. I managed to gain weight year after year while eating minimally processed healthy food even though I thought I was eating moderately.
diet,fedujn3,t3_eomebv,1579020193.0,"Eggs, tofu, frozen vegetables and chicken legs are pretty cheap. Check out grocery store meat counters for sales on packages about to expire.  My husband and I got a package of 9 chicken thighs for three dollars that way.  Zucchini, carrots and onions can be added to ground beef or turkey to stretch it out whether you're making spaghetti sauce or tacos or some sort of sloppy joe."
fatlogic,fedt6n2,t1_feddms8,1579019362.0,Not that having an actual medical degree necessarily helps. My doctor -- a well-regarded specialist in her field -- just told me last week that all women need 2000 calories per day and that fasting is unhealthy.
diet,fedrytt,t3_eojfbl,1579018616.0,"You should encourage his interest in keto which helps many people to lose weight because protein, fat and vegetables are more satiating than carbs and fruit and can cause big eaters to naturally eat less.  My husband and I have been on it for some time.  People are under the misapprehension that it requires a lot of fatty meat, but we usually eat eggs, chicken, turkey, fish and lean beef along with a pile of nonstarchy vegetables. Check out the friendly folks at r/keto for more information. Don't pressure him to exercise until he drops some weight.  It's not going to help much if he doesn't get his diet under control."
keto,fe8b2d5,t3_enr4og,1578924350.0,My first month I hardly lost anything. The second and third months were my best. Then it slowed way down again. Don't give up.
lowcarb,fe6dnh3,t3_enwypr,1578887843.0,I've been doing a low carb diet since I started maintenance. I've never understood the science behind the  process all that well but I think people who eat low carb are in ketosis at least part of the day and will continue to burn fat if they eat at a deficit.  I don't think protein has much impact on whether or not you're in ketosis.
keto,fe5pxci,t1_fdu5wiu,1578872856.0,"It really helped that first month when my coworkers were bringing in homemade treats seemingly every day to tell myself that I could eat treats when the 30 days was over. But when the time was up, I had lost a bit of weight and a lot of bloat and continued on."
diet,fe5o8up,t1_fe5mc00,1578872041.0,"If you find carbs more satiating then you have your answer. Whatever diet you can stick to is the one that's best for you. Eating nutritious food is better for your health than not, but you can eat junk and lose weight or eat healthy and gain weight. I managed to do the latter for years. Any diet can give you proper nutrients if you make the effort."
diet,fe5loj3,t3_env6dg,1578870987.0,"Different people find different foods satiating. The more satisfied you are the easier to stick to the diet is. I personally find protein and fat far more satiating than carbs which is why I do keto. BTW keto is 5% carbs, not zero."
xxketo,fe5g8d7,t1_fe4ns27,1578869096.0,"It really works. I started at 62 and in less than a year, lost that layer of fat middle age brought to my body."
diet,fdszgy9,t3_en0chp,1578709955.0,"As a ketoer/low carber, I recommend adding a bit of healthy fat:  nuts, seeds, avocado, olive oil, whole milk yogurt, etc. It's miserably hard to eat both low fat and low carb, and calorie for calorie fat is much more satiating than carbs for most people."
keto,fdsxm6m,t3_eml4z6,1578709270.0,"Don't tell yourself you are giving up carbs forever. Say you are giving them up for a defined period, say 30-60 days, and that you will reassess when you get there. You might surprise yourself by not missing them at all. You might also find after a period of abstaining that you have broken the addiction and can have a bite of something now and then without feeling a compulsion to binge. That's how it worked for me."
fatlogic,fdre9x2,t1_fdpsoxl,1578683267.0,"Most beef cattle spend at least half of their short lives on public or private grassland and are taken to feedlots to fatten up before slaughter. Grassland exists in a more natural state than farmland. Whatever they're fed, cattle metabolize more of the plants they eat than humans so there's less waste.  I'm not saying they're ideal for the environment just that there's not the huge discrepancy between eating meat and eating vegan that people think."
