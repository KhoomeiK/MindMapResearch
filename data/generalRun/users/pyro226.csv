They drag their feet for as long as possible and when they finally admit fault about 3.5 years after release, they only offer the service to people that bought within the last 3 years.  This means that the people that bought at launch were excluded and that most people experiencing the issue have either paid to have it fixed or bought a new version of the product.

Even their fixes are not good. When their motherboard components had bad solder that no longer conducted electricity due to micro fractures, Apple put rubber pads on the boards to apply more pressure for better contact, rather than properly resoldering with better solder.  They were essentially just prolonging failure.

And then there's Apple Care.  They're mostly trained to say it's the motherboard that needs replacing.  Apple isn't interested in doing solder-level repairs on parts that fail early because they cheaper out on electrical components (assuming the failure doesn't burn a hole in the board)."

With a 2200G, he can pair a used graphics card (used 570/580) and not have to worry about the CPU for another year or two.

Realistically, the answer is save enough to do a slightly better build so for better bang for the buck.  That way there's not a huge rush to replace parts and if finances take a turn for the worse, he's not stuck on a low-end system.

Following that logic, he might be better picking up an optiplex and later slapping in a better GPU / PSU.  My only real fear is that the capacitors go bad and he'll be back to needing a new system.  There's also little upgrade potential on the CPU.  The upside is that he'll have a better performing system for at the target price of $300 or so."

Hardware Unboxed changed to recommending the 2400G over the 2200G because the 2200G starts to limit discrete cards in newer games.  

The single channel memory means he's leaving at least 20% of the APU's performance on the table.  The APUs struggle with lows quite a bit as it is.

In terms of upgrading, high priority to the GPU (which will free up a couple GB of ram ideally).  GPU (used 570 / 580 or 1050T+) > CPU (to a 2600 or 3600) > RAM.  RAM optionally before CPU because the price of RAM is so low."

There was a lot of inter-season episodes until the actress stepped down at 18.  I haven't watched these episodes, though they might have introduced new songs.

Season 3 & 4 were played by a different lead female.  She gave off vibes of over-confident athlete, which I wasn't a fan of.

Overall, if you like the music style, I definitely suggest checking out Season 1.  S2 & interseason are watchable if you enjoyed S1 a lot.  S3 & S4 are harder to recommend.  I'd only suggest watching S3 & S4 if you have nothing better to do and just want to see where things go."

Side story:  My friend had a cat.  It looked like a stuffed animal tiger.  It hissed at people didn't like anyone.  It came down with a terrible infection and nearly died.  After it healed, it was really affectionate cat, even towards strangers.  

I'm not saying it's the same, but that nearly dying can change things.  Being hospitalized also distances them from the situation and may make the outside world seem less significant or overbearing."
AskReddit,fed2f3l,t1_fecurem,1578995351.0,"The biggest enemy is time.

Also, the liver damages very easily.  Touching the liver during transplant can bruise it.

Part of the problem is that Tylenol makes a person tired and it does more damage combined with alcohol.  By the time a person wakes up, the damage is done.

Tylenol is broken down by different pathways.  Two or three are non-toxic.  The other one happens when the non-toxic pathway is saturated.  The goal would be to delay / exhaust the the toxic pathway without damaging other necessary metabolic processes to allow the preferred pathway enough time to break more down.

By delaying the toxic pathways, it also gives the body enough time if it is possible to excrete the drug directly.  (For example, ethanol has stronger bonding than methanol, and menthol is excreted by the kidneys).

I searched for Tylenol kidneys and the sites suggested that it is absorbed and quickly broken down by the liver, so it goes back to the time aspect.  Tylenol starts in ~45 minutes.  It has a half life of 2.5 to 3 hours.  Assuming equal time to half-life between pathways (perhaps inaccurate, but a lot of drugs have about this time as half-life), the person would metabolize 3/4 of digested amount with 6 hours.  If a person attempted an OD, it's likely 8+ hours until they are found.

From here on is more guessing.  I'm not a biologist / medic.  I'm guessing the preferred pathways require reactive chemicals (sulfurization was one pathway, another involved anti-oxidants).  I'm guessing there's no way to directly inject reactive chemicals related to the non-toxic pathways as it would damage the body along the way.  I know there are blood vessels that lead to and from the liver though.  The toxic pathways involve removing a water molecule from the Tylenol molecule.  From there, if not reacted with by the particular anti-oxidant from the liver's store, the molecule destroys critical proteins and causes oxidative stress causing liver damage."
AskReddit,feczbfc,t1_fecw4nb,1578990935.0,"A French study determined that after 5 years, only ~30% of alcohol-cirricosis liver transplant patients relapsed.  The highest risk was in the first year after transplant.  Perhaps it's due to better post-transplant care.  I was surprised the percentage of relapse is so low.  I was expecting much higher.

Another study determined that with proper screening, the success of patients with shorter sobriety times was on par with those of the currently mandated 6 month sobriety (which only has a 30% survival rate when the liver disease doesn't respond to medicine).

Yeah, they messed up for an extended period of time.  If given another chance, many could succeed.

Same applies to suicide attempts.  I know two people that have attempted years ago.  One is decades past the incident and is past it.  

The other is years stable on proper medicine under a new doctor.  The old doctor kept adding medicine (near the end of the run with that doctor, my friend took ~30 different medicines), knew that he never felt right, but it was enough to keep him out of trouble until his body managed to adjust to most of the medicines (not having significant effect after years of taking them, yet removal would cause harm) and flat out reject a change of dosage the doctor thought necessary.

I've seen a few others with scars where they are years past and significantly better than when they attempted.  It's estimated that only 5-10% of hospital-treated suicide attempts go on to complete suicide.

I don't disagree with treating patients with highest survival first.  The tragedies are not being able to properly treat people prior to damage and the scarcities of resources required to treat people."
AskReddit,fecwjjy,t1_fecuqdo,1578987456.0,"Yeah, the long-term dose that can do damage is only 3X the effective dose (though I'm guessing it's the upper limit).  Most drugs have a much larger gap between effective dose and long-term toxic dosage."

France was giving the transplants earlier and found that 60% of transplant patients did not relapse.  Possibly citing the same study, one article states that after 5 years, only about 32% had relapsed.

At the time I read the article, I was surprised because if they messed up their own liver that bad, I'd have thought more would have failed a second time.  I don't know if it served as a wake-up call or if they just received significantly more support after transplant."
