I think they favor the overdraft consequences.
Its like those rewards cards for hardware stores I always get in the mail. If i manage to remember to put them in my wallet by the time I pull them out they are either expired or don’t apply to the item or are only good on purchases way over what I intend to spend or I left them home.
Why not just have all that in the system?
After all, every time I make a purchase they ask me what my reward card phone number is."

So far I never take from them.
They’re always broke anyway cause they are in college. (Except the oldest -25 who got her degree and has a good job).
