QuotesPorn,ff7c2qd,t1_ff79u6s,1579646047.0,"> it is an experience to feel like an elected official isn’t speaking to you, but rather pushing you down instead when it’s the system that’s the issue.

and i think that's what both repels the well off, since we don't get to feel that very often in the system as it is, while the vast majority of people feel like that all the time. 

fundamentally, we need politicians to stop trying so hard to think about the well off. the purpose of government is not to support those that can support themselves, its to provide knowledge and capacity to those who can't provide it themselves.

its important to remember that statistics like 'once in 473 years' (as kindermorgan puts it) are misleading. the same terminology is used to describe flood events, ie 'one in a hundred year flood'. that doesnt mean that we expect a flood once every hundred years, that means each year, the chance of a flood is 1:100. There is a 39.5% chance that a 1:100 year flood will occur at least once over 50 years. Similarly, the odds of a 1:473 year tanker accident, over 50 years, is 10%. a 1 in 10 chance that the vancouver area will experience a disaster in our lifetime.
