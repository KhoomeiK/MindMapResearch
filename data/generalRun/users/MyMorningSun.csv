I get that you had it rough growing up. A lot of us here did. But you, and you alone, are responsible for your actions. Think about it. You're not standing up or showing up anyone here. You're just becoming a worse person. 

You need to drop all three guys and go to therapy. You aren't in a Good place with yourself to be in any relationships now. The sooner you admit that and step up to try and do the right thing, the easier it will be to become a better person and eventual partner."

One thing I will say- a second middle name seems a bit much and seems unusual (though not unheard of). Is it common where you're from? I've also never heard the name Telor. Not that it really matters, since it's a middle name. Middle names are pretty much ignored until you have to fill out legal forms, so who cares anyway?"
AskReddit,ffcnakt,t3_esqst2,1579803085.0,"I buy flowers sometimes. I do my share around the house, though largely, we handle our own things (cooking, laundry, work/personal areas). I try to help and encourage him when I need to- sending new job postings, reminders, helping prepare for interviews or appointments as needed, editing letters or emails. I kiss or hug or rub against him or smack his butt when he walks by. All the usual stuff.

My biggest love language (at least, in terms of how I show love...how I feel loved is a different story) is food. I love to cook and bake. Sad? I'll bring you pies or cookies. Sick? I've got some soup ready, a fresh loaf of bread, and some hot ginger tea. Not happy or well but don't know why? Don't worry, I'll find something to feed you anyway! Sometimes I just make stuff just to share it, even if I'm not sure if he'll enjoy it. The frustrating part is that he's also not as...food receptive, I guess? But I don't mind too much. I'm far less picky and will live off leftovers for weeks, easily, whereas he only wants the same thing once or twice. It just feels like I'm contributing, since it's something very visible and tangible and made with my own two hands. Food's one of those things that has elements of health, care, community, togetherness, and nostalgia all tied to it, and I like to express my love for people that way.

I'm not good at saying ""I love you"" but it's not because I don't feel it (and, ironically, verbal affirmation is very much my love language). So I try to show it the best I can."

Some H names are Hendrick, Henry, Harvey, Heath, Hayden (a lot more popular now), Hector, Hugh, Hugo.

Names similar in meaning is hard since Harrison literally means ""Son of Harry."" Iirc Harry comes from Henry, which has regal/royal connotations. You could pick any historical leader, king, or hero, and it would at least be in a semi-similar vein as Harrison in terms of meaning. Or even book/mythological/biblical names! My favorite is David- I know multiple (it's a popular name anyway) but it's a solid, timeless choice. Arthur is another good choice- makes me think of the legendary king. Maybe Eric.

As long as they have readers there will be this occurring anyway. It may come in the form of poorly-orchestrated plays or home movies, pamphlets, short and unpublished stories circulated among groups, or as short pieces in periodicals that some groups may have the funding to produce. You might not see such things pop up form major publishers or be allowed in most libraries, but in terms of it getting around and proliferating groups that already hold those views? At least in the US, I don't know what anyone could do to even *stop* it. 

That said, I've read things like Mein Kampf before. I've read, for other classes, terrorist propaganda, including Rumiyah and Dabiq, parts of the Turner Diaries, and manifestos, letters, and interviews by known terrorists. I think they do have value, in the context of learning from and understanding an extremist mindset. It's fascinating to me, personally. 

I do understand why they're banned in certain countries, but there's always been something of a black market for things like that- if people want to get ahold of those books, they will.

It would also be nice if the website explained more of the reasoning for some of them. I know Loewen's got a book on Sundown Towns (He also wrote ""Lies My Teacher Told Me"", which is probably more famous) and he's a reputable author/professor and source, so I'm not doubting it entirely. It's just that some that are listed (Isle of Palms, Shandon, Gatlinburg) make sense as historical sundown towns, but are currently just really white-majority or gentrified areas and get a lot of non-white tourists/visitors regularly. A lot of the comments for the ones I clicked through (in the SE) just had a lot of ""don't know,"" which isn't all that enlightening. I'm not doubting a lot of these, but I'd like to see more information, especially about the ones that are closer to home."
news,fegnt3n,t1_fefsx5e,1579098247.0,"My grandmother's does not. It's just very disability friendly and they try to organize community events, meetings, etc. and manage the lawn/general maintenance for residents, since many can't get out or around easily. All homes are single level and facilities are wheelchair accessible. 

There is, however, a nice new one also nearby us- they emphasize independent living (so their homes are managed and cleaned by the residents and they have the freedom to do as they please), but also have an in-building cafe, plenty of activity rooms for social events, buses for ""off campus"" group outings, and various care professionals on call to help them with day to day tasks or the aforementioned activities. Almost like a college dorm, except you get your own (much larger) place to live in and everyone is old."

Absolutely this- I've got a number of friends/relatives who've had disordered eating.

AskAnAmerican,fe8qtha,t3_enrln8,1578929513.0,"You're going to get a bit of bias asking on reddit, but I think the real answer is that it's split more down the center- it's controversial for a reason.

However, I think the attitudes towards contraception have been gradually changing. More people are pro-contraception for the sake of preventing abortions from occurring, than they are anti-everything related to sex ed/contraception/women's health/everything else.

Something I've observed among parents with strong views on things like this- a lot of them can be reasoned with for making contraceptives available, increasing sex ed, etc. or taking otherwise more ""liberal"" stances if they see that it's a net good for their community (preventing teen pregnancies, dropout rates, or abortion rates).  However, there's very much an attitude of ""not *my* good Christian daughters!"" when it concerns their own kids and they'll prevent their own kids from starting BC or getting the sex ed that they need. So basically, they may vote for measures to enable access/education for teen girls of their communities, but refuse to let their own daughters have that same access because of the suggestion that they're being sexually active (which just *couldn't* be the case /s), or they want to maintain their control over their kids. It's absurd and illogical, but something I've witnessed and I could easily see that being an influence here."
