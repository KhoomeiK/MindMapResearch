SubredditDrama,ff8djoj,t1_ff7xzl8,1579674015.0,"I haven't. I don't hate your comments, I just disagree.

'Natural rights' are just an abstract concept with no impact on reality unless they are socially recognized and enforced in *some* way. And it is absolutely impossible to enforce rights without also removing them from others - e.g. if you let a serial murderer walk free, others will lose their right to life - so you have to remove the serial murderer's right to freedom. Any community who wants rights to exist has to enforce rights by removing rights from people who would violate rights.

US law deals with this by only removing rights once a clear violation has been committed, but nazis (semantics on whether they're 'alt-right' or 'white nationalists' or 'nazis' are bullshit, I just call them nazis) want a white ethnostate and the end result of that is genocide, and as far as I'm concerned, advocates of a genocidal ideology should have no freedom, as their freedom is a threat to the lives of people."

1. Scientific studies can use questionnaires (surveys). Using instruments such as surveys to measure a population is not un-empirical.
2. All the results you've cited are based on surveys.
3. The first three links you've posted are not published scientific studies. Do you try to mislead people by posting citations hoping no one will check them?
