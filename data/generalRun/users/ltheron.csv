fatlogic,ffixc6v,t3_etr1xy,1579985010.0,"Currently in the process of trying to recover from anorexia and god damn the calories on menus can actually be killer. I could go out to a restaurant and be okay with eating something and then I see it has like 300+ and panic and just wont eat anything. 

That being said, I know that my case is not the normal. As much as it would help me in my personal recovery, that doesn’t mean that I think the whole world should change to accommodate me. People have a right to know how much they are eating, and if it helps anyone struggling with overeating/obesity then it’s doing a good job."

fatlogic,fe2aihi,t1_fe2927h,1578836306.0,"I know right? I saw a few comments kinda making fun of nursing students but I am also one, and any nursing student who pays at least a bit of attention in class and has logical reasoning skills would know that excess adipose tissue increases healing time. Hate that this is how people think we all are lol"

cringe,fdiempo,t3_eldyde,1578441169.0,"Honestly it sounds like she will have the start to a good joke, but she just decided that she didn't need to write and ending and would just wing it on stage. Self deprecating humor is funny, but the difference is that she doesn't seem confident in the next word she is going to say, as though everything is just rambling and then when the punchline comes it just makes you feel sorry instead of laughing. Just like, write the punchline to your joke lol"
AskReddit,fdhqyj7,t3_elbejj,1578428439.0,"“If you can’t handle me at my worst you don’t deserve me at my best” is so fucking stupid. If you at your worst is toxic and abusive, then people shouldn’t stick around to handle you. They shouldn’t stick through abuse to get to deserve ‘your best’. People don’t owe you shit if you are an asshole, get over yourself."
wilbursoot,fdg00m8,t1_fdfzvio,1578375157.0,"Lmao it’s his channel. He is allowed to change his mind. Plus, I promise you he is still going to post it! Idk I always hate the mindset of creators owing us certain content. Especially youtubers who we get to watch for free. I don’t feel entitled to anything from him, and I feel like he is allowed to change his mind if he wants to"

AskReddit,fcp5xul,t3_ei9bm3,1577851537.0,"Yes! Finally a question I can really answer. I am touch starved and have been for several years. In the beginning, when that empty caved in feeling that happens after a long period of time hits, I would just kind of wrap my arms around myself in a hug and layer blankets over myself to try and simulate the warmth, as though it was someone else hugging me. As I got older it was less and less helpful and I found myself feeling empty more and more often. I ended up telling my close friend about the feeling and we decided that if I ever need touch I just have to ask “can you hold me?” Or “can I have a hug?” and it’s not weird. When I’m alone I now have a weighted blanket which does wonders."
