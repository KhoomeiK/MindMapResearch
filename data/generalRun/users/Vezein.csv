Pigeons are not native and honestly plentiful. Just take one home with you if you really care about them so much. Honestly..... 

Pigeons of all things."
forhonor,ff6byrq,t1_ff2q52i,1579623861.0,"ReadingUrInputs is his name. 

I fucking hate him. But he can eat my Kick2Grab all day and I feel no remorse."
MonsterHunterWorld,ff686ba,t3_erutb8,1579621413.0,"They're gonna grow into nice, strong, healthy Mantles one day. :3"
ForHonorVikings,ff652nc,t1_ff40pc0,1579619323.0,That Highlander deserved it.
depression,ff5rzq9,t3_err22y,1579607986.0,"I had a cat too. He was my companion against everything the world would throw at us. One day he was kidnapped and thrown in the woods somewhere. I never saw him again. It fucking broke me, man. It's ok to feel that. Just don't let it consume you. 

That guy who did it went to jail btw. He was released over a weekend of time."
forhonor,ff22dad,t1_ff0jsl0,1579491927.0,No that Highlander was a fucking idiot.
IdiotsInCars,fejxa1w,t1_fejwo4v,1579187959.0,Not creepy. Just pathetic and sad.
CompetitiveForHonor,fejgi4x,t1_fejgdk8,1579173144.0,"I surely will! Thanks, Spaniard. I'll see what's happening Friday."
CompetitiveForHonor,feivocy,t1_fehzsj4,1579148478.0,"How often are PS4 practice scrims usually? I've been semi practicing comp for a while but I've been wanting to step my game up. The problem is, I've been getting pretty burnt out on matchmaking and the fact that my favorite hero is subpar for comp scenes."
pics,fegoc6r,t1_fegnhag,1579098633.0,"When your very soul is in such a numbed state, you don't care about where you ask for help. His wife and he spent a lot of their before sleep time on Reddit together. Laughing and sharing opinions and cooking ideas to try out the next lovely day if their lives. 

Here he sits, with the love of his life, reaching out to the very platform they had many good memories with. 

Maybe help him celebrate her life and giving him some compassion rather than critique his choice of board? You and your ilk can kindly go get fucked."
depression,fegbm05,t3_eoxun3,1579086465.0,"Look, man. Remember things are getting better. Depression serves you no purpose other than that state is what you are comfortable in. If you're feeling happier, that's a new pattern for you to learn. Don't let that sadness try to take away all of your precious progress."
DungeonsAndDragons,feffcpv,t3_eorxcb,1579055141.0,"Nat 1 my ass. He embedded the handle right above the bullseye. You know how Nat 1s work, right? I'm starting to have suspicions."
Norse,fdr1ayz,t1_fdqstwp,1578678146.0,"So, like you clearly presented to the entirety of this subreddit, you're a total loss and waste of human potential. You posted this only for being an inflammatory ass tumor to this sub. If this is all you aspire to, I'm not surprised. 

Please go tell your parents to take your phone away, as the world is beginning to understand what a pair of failures they are to spawn such a brainless lemur."
Norse,fdqrlog,t3_emt1dt,1578673379.0,"So I'm going to try and say this as bluntly as possible, so as to not waste any more time in my life than reading this already has. 

What the fuck possessed you to make such a childish and completely *useless* post? There is no discussion to be had, you aren't helping anyone, and you're downright creating a popularity test."
forhonor,fdqpkze,t1_fdpzsmd,1578672131.0,Man same. I really love having such a supportive woman. I definitely play better when she's cheering me on.
depression,fdqouc1,t3_emnbdm,1578671667.0,You need to record everything and gift desperately for your daughter. Fight for her as she would you. Don't give up. You haven't lost everything yet. There's still a reason to fight like a madman.
SWORDS,fdpjbtp,t1_fdopxoq,1578630178.0,Gods I do the same thing. The Maximillion is definitely a goal for me. So is the Eindreide Longsword. Can't remember how to spell it accurately.
LucidDreaming,fdmbpml,t1_fdm0iyp,1578544896.0,"I wouldn't be surprised at all if it was reposted. It IS a good story. But you are correct; I first read about it long ago, right after a terrible trip of mine. Wasn't good timing, honestly. I had troubles with grasping our own reality afterwards. It felt like a muscle that I had to consistently think of flexing to stay in this reality. 

Like I said though, it was a long time ago and my wife and I laugh at that misguided young fool nowadays. :)"
LucidDreaming,fdlxjj8,t3_elwujr,1578534881.0,"This reminds me of a story I saw of a man getting knocked the fuck out at a frat party. He was promptly sent to Coma Dreamland and lived and entire life whilst unconscious. His alter life was going very well for him until his eyes landed on a red lamp for n the corner of his room. He had stated at it for days while his relationship with his coma-wife deteriorated, ending with her taking their kids and living with her parents. The entire time he was just staring at this lamp. His vision begins zooming in like an eagle acquiring it's prey. (not an expert on eagles) 

The red envelopes his entire world, excruciating pain was all he knew for the next few seconds and then *bam*. He was awake. And incredibly confused and depressed about the wonderful wife and children he had lost. 

Can't remember if it was a true story or not but its always stuck with me."
monsterhunterclan,fdlwykv,t3_elzwcx,1578534490.0,"If you'd still need help. Or whoever sees this post and my comment, send me a message. Val Hazak happens to be my specialty. :)"
Moonlighter,fdlvdrq,t3_elzyjz,1578533387.0,"I don't know man. If it smells like rotten eggs, I wouldn't use a fire weapon near it."
LancerRPG,fdlmfod,t1_fdlkn2q,1578527334.0,"That's great to hear. I'm assuming there's gonna be various action stances and the like in the future. The modular mech customization is really awesome. I havent seen it done before. Keep it up, guys!!"
SWORDS,fdkrcuw,t3_elt2wo,1578509551.0,That Longsword is beautiful.
LancerRPG,fdkprb3,t3_elst5t,1578508601.0,Absolutely love this. Definitely using it for some NPCs and the like in my Lancer campaign. Would you add something like two handed melee weapons? Or add an option for two handing them? Thank you for creating this. It's near perfect.
forhonor,fdka6g8,t3_elt7z2,1578499545.0,Faraam Warden's sword looks awesome.
LucidDreaming,fdiu0ys,t3_ellabu,1578451021.0,..... I'm summoning a translator.
forhonor,fdipahv,t1_fdijceu,1578447994.0,For Honor Tarot cards for more variety. :3
forhonor,fdip7gg,t3_elilac,1578447939.0,Beautiful! Special request for Highlander!
titanfall,fcsn720,t1_fcsc576,1577920192.0,It's not meanness. It's simple English.
rpghorrorstories,fclnv2p,t3_ehjagc,1577752199.0,"Ugh. Another story made worse by the fact that no one can handle a WEE bit of conflict ever. Like stand up for your fucking women, everyone. Please. It isn't hard. You empower them with the knowledge that you're gonna be there for them when it counts. 

Don't be pathetic."
titanfall,fcf4fdx,t1_fcdht1j,1577626522.0,Aw I'm sorry that was spoiled for you. During the end credits though he is reassembled. I figured they'd have a backup state for good ol' BT. He's rebuilt ala Iron Giant style.
heathenry,fccqcx8,t3_egxf41,1577601397.0,I find it interesting that OP seems to be more concerned with gods and their 'power levels' than anything else.
gaming,fbzv73k,t3_efcnbq,1577263320.0,You're a good dad/mom.
