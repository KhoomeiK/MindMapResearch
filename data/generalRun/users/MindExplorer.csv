edmproduction,ff9sv5g,t3_es89s8,1579720515.0,"i start with trying to find a good riff. and everything else builds from the energy of that riff. i try not to fit the riff into a scale. most of the time a riff that works usually is in the right scale i want, i only start thinking about scales and theories when i feel like certain parts of the track is ""off"". 

i make mainly rap music so good riff, bass, and drum are really the 3 major elements.

it's all about capturing the your feeling, that's why i usually dont pick a key to start a beat. i will try different keys if to see if the intervals/melodic sentences sound better in other keys. 

but yea, it's all practice. you want to get so proficient with the DAW/gear that you can manifest whatever you hear in your head quickly into the DAW.

i try not to let the DAW determine what i hear in my head, meaning letting buttons and plugins dictate my sound.

humming out what you hear in your head is a great way. because that's the most direct way to express what you hear in your head."

don't know if your tracks have vocals or not but let just say there's no vocal.

crispiness and clarity generally come from having balanced levels and EQ's. once you get those two down you're pretty much set. 

making sure nothing is clashing by properly EQ'ing the instruments, for example, claps and snares dont have sub low end freqencies so i would low pass those right off the bat.

after leveling and EQ'ing, i would look for things that need delays, reverb, and compression. then stereo imaging.

i couldn't tell you more because i dont know what you're working with. but above is pretty much how i ""start"" my mixes.

i have i7 core with 32 GB as well with SSD.

basically i can have the same amount of or more plugins opened in Reaper and it would not crash whatsoever but not in FL."
