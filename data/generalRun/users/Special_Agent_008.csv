He's not wrong (*although I don't know anything about this ""automation"" stance*) but his platform is built on things that aren't large enough in the public following to garner enough support for a successful presidential run.

I guess that if pressed, I could say that I respect the ""fringe"" candidates more because they believe in and have already been working towards the things they say and aren't just saying words they were told are popular things to say, like most of the front-runners.  


Hillary Clinton seemed so disingenuous that they may as well have put a cardboard cutout on the stage and played a recording.  That's why she lost, that reason and that Trump's campaign team played the election game better than hers.  


Clinton's team ignored states that carried much needed election points, leaving them sitting for the Trump team to scoop right up. How could a ""president"" be so dumb?  It also showed or strongly suggested that she as a president would have been just fine ignoring citizens that didn't matter to her, who weren't her ""preferred"" people.  Generally, people don't like to be pandered and ignored.

Donald Trump has certainly been a contentious figure, but at least many more Americans have finally started paying attention to what's going on in the government.
