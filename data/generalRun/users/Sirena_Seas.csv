Periods,fe9zpz4,t3_eo7rjd,1578942903.0,"Your period can do odd things sometimes. It could be reacting to stress from returning to school even if it didn't in the Fall semester. Sometimes you don't get your usual symptoms. I usually bloat and crave sweets and salt for a few days before my period starts but a few months ago it just started with no fanfare.

The constipation could be relevant - I've had my period skip a month during illness. It might be a good idea to see a doctor about the constipation if you haven't already. I wouldn't worry too much, easier said than done, I know."

UnresolvedMysteries,fe9oces,t1_fe8wemh,1578939939.0,I suppose if the killer isn't a pedophile then a child victim might be a surrogate for someone he believes wronged him - maybe a sister who was favoured or protected while he was abused or neglected.
UnresolvedMysteries,fe3y0zl,t1_fe0hgde,1578853920.0,That makes more sense to me.  It's hard to imagine parents not even taking a glance at their child before leaving the house or going about their day even in more relaxed times.  I stayed at home alone during school vacations at that age and my parents would insist on me getting up to at least be seen before they left for work.

namenerds,fdi79sc,t1_fdhjjjs,1578436989.0,I've known two Petals and a Petulia in my life. Paired with a more ordinary surname it's an old fashioned but ordinary name in my country along the same lines as Violet or Iris. Paired with Flora it becomes a bit much.

WeightLossAdvice,fcvgcoi,t3_ej141g,1578001515.0,"Don't beat yourself up so much. Twenty pounds is a decent amount and if you haven't been challenging your muscles for a while it will take time to build up strength. Your calorie count sounds a bit low for an eighteen year old guy but I remember hardly feeling hungry in college because the cafeteria food was so bland and gross looking. I lived on turkey sandwiches, potato chips and cereal for the first year."

Sims4,fcobl9e,t3_ei5leu,1577828251.0,"Last night I dreamed I was on a train sitting near a little girl with big creepy eyes. She grabbed my wrist and kept pointing out a ""scary shadow"" in a corner. Every time I looked at the shadow and then back at the little girl her face would get more terrifying.  She ended up looking just like that. Demolish the house and throw the game away!"
tifu,fcoa5d8,t1_fcmwehl,1577827256.0,"In my tiny college town in Illinois the police would set up shop near the bars to dissuade people from trying to drive drunk. Most of the college kids just walked back to campus and there'd be a squad car crawling down the street keeping an eye on things. They always seemed friendly enough if we waved at them but I only went to college in small town USA. I didn't grow up there.

In my country the police wouldn't bother themselves with a private party unless they had a tip off for some significant law breaking"
criminalminds,fcnvc3w,t3_eg5tvz,1577819158.0,"Seaver was my least favourite. I blame that on the writing and the timing though - it seemed they were trying to make her fit in perfectly so quickly in hopes the fans would forget JJ.

I liked Tara and Luke fairly quickly and their intro stories made sense. Blake as well."
AmItheAsshole,fcns3l2,t3_ei3eco,1577817362.0,NTA! Those people aren't your friends. They're probably not even true friends to each other. With you removing yourself from the group they'll likely target another as 'the outsider.' I've seen it happen before.
penpals,fcnrops,t3_ehrnba,1577817146.0,Fell on a trail...slipped actually and eaten kale. I'm from the Caribbean so not sure what the postage would be like on your end but I'd love to be penpals. I've stockpiled lots of stationery and stickers over the years because they're so pretty.

criminalminds,fciot6e,t1_fc700xm,1577666320.0,Same here. I really disliked her at first but she became my favourite character along with Reid.
KindVoice,fciapdn,t3_ehaffo,1577659833.0,There's nothing stupid about your feelings. Something that meant a lot to you was stolen. No one is entitled to take your property like that. I hope there are some clues or surveillance footage to help find out who broke in.
criminalminds,fci0tm9,t1_fchol3d,1577656409.0,"Yes, Reid deserves some uncomplicated romantic happiness! At the end of the episode it seemed like Reid was on a more even keel than JJ. Perhaps next season she'll be dealing with any unresolved feelings while he acknowledges it and moves on. JJ has had an emotional season but her relationship with Will has been strong and supportive. I'd like to think the writers wouldn't throw all that away."
1200isplenty,fchyp5p,t1_fcgndf7,1577655678.0,I love it! One thing with a tropical country is there's always some fruit available for chow. Is there a favourite fruit for chow in Guyana? I grew up with mango and pommecythere chow but Trini people will use any available fruit.
criminalminds,fchgyyb,t3_eh7uqy,1577650350.0,I just got caught up on Season 14 today. I honestly hope they leave it as an awkward and bittersweet moment and let them move on as friends. It's possible JJ and Reid might have unresolved affection for each other. Who hasn't looked at a friend or colleague and thought about what might have been in a different time or situation? But acting on it would be so messy in this case. The betrayal would be devastating - Reid has known Will since the start of his relationship with JJ. He's always come across as respecting the man and he's godfather to Henry. JJ and Reid have both had to keep secrets and tell lies for different reasons but I can't see them doing that for an affair.

1200isplenty,fccs20l,t1_fccq6iz,1577601960.0,Chow is a little different as it's usually made and served fresh. But we have chow-chow as well or piccalilli as it's also called. It's very popular served with ham here.
1200isplenty,fcbn6kg,t3_egxjby,1577588785.0,"That looks like what we call ""chow"" in Trinidad. We usually use fruit and add vinegar, garlic, salt, black pepper, chadon beni/bandhania and lots of hot peppers for the sauce."
