You can actually find gravure (bikini photoshoots) of actual 12-17 yrs old girls at the news stand bending over in string bikinis because it's ""legal"" as long as no sex acts are being portrayed but we all fucking know it's conditioning young girls who aren't fully mentally developed to sell their sexuality to much older men.

Going to armchair psychiatrist but I think loli is so popular with weebs due to their dimutitive and immature nature that make people ""want to protect them."" Not everyone are like that but anime attract enough inexperienced socially awkward guys who aren't exactly the popular type in school so fetishization of lolis and innocent make them feels like big men, someone a naive girl can depend on in their fantasy.

Female charas do get pass easier for doing bad things more often than men especially since alot of people here are men. Kiyo is a popular waifu despite burning a gay guy for not being attracted to her. Kiara is a literal beast. Mebd is a stalker-ish bitch toward Cu but if a male chara do the same thing, he would likely get more hate. There's nothing wrong with indulging in morally dubious male and female since they're fictional but many fanboys are hypocrites. To be fair at least in Mo case, she is sympathetic compared to trash bag like Columbus who depiction is of an actual villain."

I don't get why many people on this sub don't seem get the concept of ""self insert."" Nasu said they're meant to normal part times who ended up in Chaldea. The ""average man"" setup make them relatable to readers because most people are average but no one like being actually ""average."" Writers give them ex harem skills for people to power fantasy. It's literally a pandering device to YOU. It's not that deep. 

For self inserts, Gudao is bad too. Hakuno/n at least have more inner dialogues so you can understand their motivations. I suspect it is because FGO is written by multiple writers so it is much easier for writers to not worry about consistency when the narrator you see through is ""blank slate"""

Gamingcirclejerk,fdf634y,t1_fdeue4u,1578354154.0,"Anime as a genre itself isn't exactly mainstream in japan and average Japanese don't care for otakus either. You're expected to grow out of animes which is why majority of them are targeted at teens. Shounen magazines aim at teen boys have more readers.

The really bad waifu harem pandering is a niche but it's a niche that prey on lonely men because they know they will shell out money.   

Ofc anime is a media that reflect society views and Japan is still sexist so you can blame society in the way anime portray women in anime and all the uncomfortable sexualization of minors.
