DragonballLegends,ff6c53x,t1_ff6avh5,1579623971.0,"Yeah for sure. Thing is, it's not like I woke up that day and thought ""I'm gonna spend hundreds of pounds on Legends today."" I just got so frustrated that I didn't get the unit I wanted, that I kept going and going, not really paying attention to how much I was spending. 

It was more of a ""Fuck you, game. I'm going to get the unit I want no matter what."" and of course that didn't really turn out the way I'd hoped lol. That was when I realised I had a gambling addiction."
DragonballLegends,ff6554d,t3_ertrwm,1579619370.0,I can't remember how many CC I spent to try to pull LF SSJ3 Goku but I spent close to £700 trying to get him without actually getting him. Been F2P ever since.
