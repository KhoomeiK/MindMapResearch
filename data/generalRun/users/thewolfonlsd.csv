I acknowledge the criticism and validate it, but since the details aren't relevant to the topic at hand, I collected it into the term ""bad shit.""

My addition that many governments also do bad shit is to point out that many governments do bad shit but that criticism doesn't leak into hate of the general population.

You're the one bringing this off topic."

I've been to rural China as well and one of my best friends grew up in the mainland, they're not all *known to be rude and insensitive*. I think saying so is dangerous in a time where general Sinophobia and racism is on the rise."
