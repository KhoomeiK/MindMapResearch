How Football is the biggest sport in America.  They are literally talking about how you can make hockey bigger, and then Bill goes on to say ""eh, they're rich enough already"".  Obviously the owners and NHL are pushing to grow the sport like any company would.  But saying they make enough already is just lazy and boneheaded.  Obviously the goal is to make more money.

It’s not a low quality argument to say chopping your dick off is nuts.  You can’t compare it to saying liking the same sex is nuts.  Because those two things aren’t even close to the same.  It’s just a lazy argument by you saying look 30 years ago gays were viewed the same.  Just because people were wrong about gays 30 years ago doesn’t mean we have to be wrong about trans now.  

And the leg comparison does work because you can get functional prosthetics, or even who says you need a leg.  But no doctor would do that surgery because it’s fucking retarded.  

Trans people are mentally ill.  There’s nothing else to it.  I’m not condemning them for being mentally ill.  I’m fine with them having rights and not being harassed.

You calling me an incel has got to be one of the funniest things I’ve ever heard. That’s not a catch all insult.  It has a very specific meaning and calling you a loser does not fit it.

worldnews,fcnd94p,t1_fcnbqtm,1577809243.0,In the internet age?   No it doesn’t.
worldnews,fcnd088,t1_fcn671f,1577809080.0,"It’s not really the same.  Sweden doesn’t seem to have good numbers online for racial stats, but from what I just read only 12 percent is foreign born, and the “foreigners” are mostly from other Nordic countries or Europe.

USA is very different.

16 percent Hispanic.  13 percent African.  5 percent Asian.  In a country that is as large as America those are huge populations.  And they have different cultures, and problems.  

Sweden is definitely more homogeneous than America.  Your response is a perfect Reddit answer but isn’t really true in practice.

Niche.com claims Sweden is 92% only white.  4% 2 or more races.  2 percent Hispanic 2 percent Asian.  It’s not even close lol.  Sweden is homogenous."

But CarPlay was setup very well so everything is max 2 touches away and you can use voice commands for everything in it.  Not much harder than clicking a physical button.  It’s rare to need to touch things while driving unless you need something out of the ordinary."
unpopularopinion,fcn05y2,t1_fcmi3rv,1577799353.0,"They’re good points if they made sense.

My 2017 subaru with touchscreen has counterpoints to them.

1).  All important functions can be done without taking your hand off the steering wheel with hard buttons.  Changing radio station or volume, switching any of the pages on the 3 displays, one being a massive touch screen.  Changing radio source.  

2) you can have the brightness dimmed all the way when your lights turn on.

3). That’s literally the same with anything in 2020.  Technically most things run through your phone, the touchscreen isn’t much smarter than  a dumb screen."
hockey,fcmyee8,t1_fcme4vs,1577797571.0,"You’ve done nothing but pander to a thread full of biased capital fans.  Backstrom hasn’t won a single individual award.  Every single year of the decade he was never in the top 5 of his position and if he happened to be top 10 he was 9th or 10th.  He racked up mostly assists which are worth far less than goals, that drops his stock drastically.  And he was aided by playing with the best goal scorer in history.  Dude is good not great.  Sorry you are offended."

hockey,fcm97z1,t1_fcm84ax,1577767647.0,You’re one butthurt asshole lmao.  Even with the caps brigade in here downvoting me you’re still upset.  Just remember hall of fame players win individual awards or were part of dynasty cup runs.  Backstrom was neither.  Dude is hall of very good.  Sorry you’re upset about it.
hockey,fcm6kb8,t1_fcm65i7,1577765541.0,Lmao I don’t agree with your biased ass opinion on hockey so you tell me to physically hurt myself.  Wow you’re a fucking loser lmfao.
hockey,fcluw7j,t1_fclsfjf,1577757049.0,So half his seasons he was top ten in points.  And half his season he wasn’t.  5/6 of those seasons he was quite far from top ten.  Not to mention Bakstrom got those points being boosted by playing with the greatest goal scorer in hockey history.  And straight up points not telling the entire story of what makes the best overall hockey center.  Not to mention backstrom mostly getting assists over his career which are very much worth less than goals.
hockey,fcliwo9,t1_fclhugm,1577748849.0,"That’s not blatantly obvious from your wording given the article we are debating.  I thought you were saying since he had the second most assists in the decade he’s the second best player on the “statistics team” of the decade.  Such a weird way to say that lol, and doesn’t matter at all how good the caps were doing.  We’re debating individual talent.  If anything it helps prove my point.  backstrom had help from the best team in the league while failing to win anything on his own merit.  

End of the day, the guy wasn’t even top ten in his own position for pretty much the entire decade.  He has no Individual hardware whatsoever, and not even a first or second all star team showing.  

Hall of Very Good."
