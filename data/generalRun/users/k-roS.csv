Correct me if i am wrong but she wears mostly brown-ish matte smokey eyes with a bit of gold. No pink or even the bright turquoise shade. At least not very often. 
The mattes do reflect her style more but the shimmer/glittery shades. I don't know. 

If i got the chance to create a palette i would put in colors i would use a lot and enjoy on a daily basis. Every color, not only 3 of 10."

anorexia is starving yourself and torturing your body to achieve a goal out of touch with reality, a form of self-destruction, a signale for self-hate, a disorder.

IF is controlling the times of eating. You don't have to bann things from your diet, you don't have to count every single calorie (a general change in your diet to a more healthy way is recommended but you can still have pizza, burger, chocolate) 
IF is a way of teaching yourself more awareness of the food you are eating, a lifestyle.

Anorexia is a body perception disorder"
