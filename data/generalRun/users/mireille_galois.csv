The air equivalent of bulimia, more or less.  Doesn't make the binges any less bingey.

The key is to take a measured breath once every 2-12 seconds or so as appropriate to your current activity level like a normal person.  This would be the equivalent of eating a reasonable TDEE for a healthy weight for your frame and activity level day-in-day-out."
science,ffrcg42,t1_ffqjt6u,1580155183.0,"Because the pain isn't the unhealthy part.  The injury and especially potential for negative long-term damage is.  Lifting weights, eating spicy food, and the like, are (or can be) neutral or beneficial for long-term well being.

It is entirely possible to over-exercise to the point of courting injury, and that isn't healthy, either.  But the balance between pain and injury is different -- it is possible to lift heavy enough to solicit a pretty significant pain response without actually being injurious.  This is also why good form is important."

Really dreading the sudden 100 pound weight gain I am apparently destined to experience this year.  If only eating a reasonable diet and daily exercise would somehow protect me from this, but alas, I am lost!  Better give up and shovel lasagna into my face while sitting on the couch.  No way this prophecy of adipose could in any way be a self-fulfilling thing."

fatlogic,fcukzdd,t1_fcueont,1577983322.0,"Are you seriously kneecap-shaming them right now?  You need to check your joint privilege and realize the only thing that actually exists is human social power dynamics.  Electrons, planets, busted kneecaps, diabetes, mathematics, death, and shoes only have a socially constructed existence, and the only reason they are constructed is for identity groups to seize power.  So join our identity group as we attempt to seize power; 'cuz it's okay when we do it, and pay no attention to the fact that our own arguments are self-negating.

fatlogic,fcucp1t,t3_eiy3y2,1577977879.0,"Here's the thing though.  I'm a competent adult.  I'm capable of figuring out most of the details for myself, especially with the plethora of resources available online (and the advice of people of my acquaintance  who'd dropped a lot of weight before I did).  A health professional's job isn't to tell me in microscopic detail everything I must do, it's to give me advice (you're obese, it would benefit you to lose weight)  and a general outline of how to get it done (eat less, exercise more, CICO works).  I have enough agency that I don't need to be literally or figuratively spoon-fed every morsel.

fatlogic,fcn2ks6,t1_fcmnx46,1577801493.0,"Also a diet, also bad.  It's not really small amounts of food *per se* that they object to; it's any effort at all towards self-improvement.  Fundamentally, anything other than being a passive observer as your body and life fall apart is offensive to them -- they refuse to make an effort, and don't see why anyone else should.  Agency is anathema."
