Trackdays,ff51f1e,t1_ff5143j,1579577631.0,"I work with [Tonys track days](http://www.tonystrackdays.com). We run events in the North East. Palmer MA, Thompson CT, sometimes NHMS and NYST. 

Honestly most of our non sport bike attendees would fit in perfectly fine in our Red (novice) group at our conventional days. We generally run a more accessible, tamer, more structured day than most orgs while still accommodating the more polite race crowd in the upper levels."
