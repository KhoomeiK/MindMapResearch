videos,ff6u0rl,t3_ertrzl,1579634863.0,I was in the silent study area when I saw this. Had to leave the area as I couldn’t stop myself from laughing.
asktrp,femzxbd,t1_femzeqo,1579273838.0,"True. I am a man and nobody is going to save me. I must take care of myself and my family. 

Ignoring people and not dealing with them is great both for your energy and for avoiding disasters. But I don't like people talking shit to me in front of other people, and if they are equal to me or my age (or just few years older than me), I immediately put them on their place and don't talk to them until they chase my ass and apologies as a man. That is the case if that person is somebody that I see or will interact them in the long-term either because I need to or because of other circumstances. If is some dicked on the street or bar I just ignore because is not worth it to bark like a dog to every car that passes near me."
asktrp,femwzn3,t1_femucs5,1579271799.0,"Good and sensible reply. It reminded me of Jordan B Peterson's book called ""12 Rules for Life"", where he talks about men testing other men. As far as I remember, it was in a railway building company where Peterson used to work. He shared his experience where men used to test newcomers with very harsh ways like throwing bricks on their helmet and just ""harass"" the newcomer to test their ability to withstand pressure and see how new the newcomers handle and integrate into the team. 

I understand the aspect where you are coming from and would like to thank you for sharing this meaningful reply which I totally agree with and I am aware of.

What about those men that test you for ""no reason""?! Meaning that I won't matter or see them after I finish my job? I am totally aware and agree that men should and do test people joining the team, but I cannot make and give sense to those people that are 5,10,15 years older than me that want to apply their power over me just because of their age. I say just because of their age because it has happened to me in an area where I am expert in and they have no right to judge me because one, its not their expertise, two its not their business, and three its not even something to do with them. 

I don't mind taking limited shit from a teacher, boss, older family member, relative, a person that I interact with, or a person with a reputation that has achieved something in life which will benefit me. 

What do you suggest and how one should handle ""shit tests from men""?  I don't think this is something that is discussed in this community."
socialmedia,femlbc6,t3_epy22o,1579261189.0,What does your social media agency offer?
asktrp,femi4ox,t1_femhzu5,1579256759.0,Good example.
asktrp,femhsk6,t1_femh3cd,1579256250.0,"Okay here is a example: I was doing a job for a client/ boss, one of his staff few times as a joke implied that I should do my job faster. As time progressed it literally became kind of like a harassment as he was directly saying that I work slow. He is literally nobody, just a dude in his 40s that is working for a minimum wage job. I am really good at what I do and very fast and it made me frustrated that this guy that is nobody saying and fucking up with me about my performance and speed of my work when the boss/client doesn’t say anything and in fact is happy about what I do and how I do it. I kept my mouth shut because he is twice my age but wanted to say “its none of your business what I do and how I do it because you are nobody”. Not as a joke but directly to his face. 

I know that I should never outrun the master, so I know that to some point I should balance taking shit from some people generally the customer, the manager or the boss. Usually people at the top are smart and intelligent so they don’t push the boundaries too much, they know my value and they keep a healthy balance. Its the kind of people that are literally unrelated to me (but older than me) that like to give shit to me."

Entrepreneur,fduncup,t1_fdtwo3a,1578735735.0,"Wooow.... really?! I am actually surprised. He mist have ran out of people to target and buy his shit. People maybe have realised what a person he is. 

I mean it was disappointing for me to see a man that runs so many ads on YouTube to have a such shit courses with no value at all. When I had access to his courses, it was just a waste of time and 0 value. 

Advice to people: learn the basics either by reading documentations or watching courses on Udemy / Skillshare / {other course platform} . Because most people on these platforms are genuine and experienced. Especially the top sellers. Be it IM, SMM, Web Development or any either skill,  there is a suitable cheap course for beginners and advanced that will teach you valuable information. Once you get the basics or even do an advance course, you can invent end add your own twist over time. 

Don’t trust people with Lamborghinis that are trying to sell you courses, just put yourself out there and learn. Don’t chase the quick money, build a good foundation and be consistent. Pay attention to the vibes you get from people and question everything!"

asktrp,fdpi3fs,t1_fdpedpt,1578629220.0,"True. I mean if one looks at a girls tinder, he will realised how easy for a girl to get matches is. A girl can literally get 99+ likes in 10 minutes from the moment she joins Tinder, and with each swipe she will get a match. I’ve realised that recently. And oh gosh, the competition is trough the roof! One must be really top level to get matches and stand out from the crowd, yet alone to go on a date.

Jung,fdhlj4b,t3_elew7s,1578425203.0,Good question. Also how to stop being so ignorant and stop living in the moment (i.e stop being lazy)?
OldSchoolCool,fdg2jlc,t3_el2614,1578377639.0,"Oh wow. Every time I see a similar picture, it reminds me of the book “Ordinary Man: Police Battalion 101”. 

If you have read it you know what I mean. 

Those packed hot trains, people forced to stay in them for days with no food and water, with dead bodies in them, train carriages locked down with wooden panels to prevent people from escaping... and that is only the suffering on the way to the camps. 

The people that lived in far away locations from collection points were executed, the men taken as for slaves. 

One must read the book, I highly suggest it! So visual and descriptive, really great book."
LegalAdviceUK,fdg1w0k,t3_el5fnm,1578376971.0,"Had to do this as a coursework lol. How the CMA was created and etc. Well technically the way they wrote the CMA was to cover literally all aspects and scenarios because of how fast and flexible technology is. 

Maybe you know, the CMA was created because somebody (cant remember his name now) hacked into mail servers and got access into The Duke of Edinburgh’s emails. At the time there was no law that covered for what he did, and even in his book, the parson that did it explained that he is not criminally convinced of “hacking”. 

So what you wrote technically is right, if you own or share a pice of “data”/ “material”, it breaks subsection of the CMA. BUT as you know, the main part of the CMA is about “unauthorised access” and when it comes to “penetration testing tools”, the topic is ver sensitive. This is because is like selling a hammer or a kitchen knife. It depends on the user that will use it."
getdisciplined,fdg1d16,t3_el2yfr,1578376445.0,Great post. One must read the book called “The Slight Edge” by Jeff Olson.

MaladaptiveDreaming,fdda5sy,t1_fdd0en3,1578302075.0,Read and stay present.
MaladaptiveDreaming,fdda4wi,t3_eknph5,1578302039.0,"Good advice. In addition to what you wrote here is my experience and advice:

I noticed that I get urges when I watch YouTube videos. This is because it is something I want to do (travelling, fast cars and adventure) but I am not able to. So I take the video as a baseline of a story and DD about it. 

In order to stop DD, I just stopped watching videos that are “fun”. I have replaced this activity with A LOT of reading and I feel great. I am 6 days in and haven’t DDed yet. 

I watched 14 minute video on the 4th and realised that I had an urge to DD. I did what I was supposed to do and immediately left YouTube. 

Works great. Try it. Its a balance of controlling dopamine and finding a new way of creatine dopamine by inputting some type of work. YouTube videos give you a lot of dopamine without any work. When you stop that, your body finds a way to create dopamine from basic activities like washing dishes or clearing the house. This is because it cannot even get dopamine from DDing. 

Good luck to everybody. Stay focused and be present. Relax and breathe when you realise that you have an urge and leave the environment that you are in."

NoFap,fcv8vak,t1_fcv76i2,1577997066.0,Yes you made a good point. I thought about that. Thats why I made my own Plex server and Nextcloud server. It has all I need. I don’t miss at all Social Media. I am nor saying that I will live like a wild medieval person with technology. I am just replacing low-value activities with high-value activity and basically building a mental firewall to not expose myself to content that I consciously decide to consume. Will see how it goes. I am tracking myself and reporting it so wish me good luck.

Instead of YouTube and Amazon Prime Video/ Netflix, I have my Plex Server which contains online courses and videos that are high-value. I consciously chose and downloaded everything that is beneficial to me in the long term. No Social Media, only forums that are high-value. 

I am thinking of giving up on Spotify too and replace with podcasts. In terms of Videos and Audio, I am built my own Internet with my server at home which runs Plex and Nextcloud. Thats all I need and obviously access to forums. Everything is possible!"
NoFap,fcunegh,t3_eivin6,1577984710.0,"I have given up on social media, PMO, and video entertainment platforms. I used to be on Instagram, TikTok, Youtube and Amazon Prime for hours. In fact, I spent 30 hours a week on YouTube on my phone alone! I spent 8 hours a week on Instagram, 5 on TikTok, 3 on Facebook and 1 on Twitter. 

No matter how much I tried to control myself, no matter how much I followed the right people on Instagram to fill my feed with the right peoples posts that offered “high-value” content, the explore page was one click away filled with model girls, fast cars, and all those things that I was bombarded with without me making the conscious decision to consume it. That one click cost me many wasted hours and many relapses. Same with YouTube. I used to watch useless vlogs and all types of videos for hours which wasted my time but also spiked my dopamine sensors, giving me the sense that I did something. In reality, I did nothing, it was all unreal, I was laying down in my bed and wasting my time. 

I was not getting real satisfaction from girls in real life. They all looked “below average” to me, because I was used to see model girls on Instagram with a ton of makeup and plastic surgery. They captured images of their “one second”  of “best form/looks”, which was edited heavily with apps and published on Instagram and other social media platforms. 

After accepting the fact that I wasted a lot of time and that my dopamine sensors were totally ruined, I made the decision to unplug myself. I deleted Instagram, Tiktok, YouTube and Amazon Prime from my phone. I blocked these websites from my laptop too with Cold Turkey. I built my own Plex server full of online courses, and consciously chosen high-value only YouTube videos. In his was I wont be able to go into this endless rabbit hole of watching videos because I wont see suggested videos that are no value to me. I use Reddit and other high-value forums to read, gain knowledge, write and share knowledge with people. Same applies to discord channels and Facebook Groups. I am still in the process of configuring rules for Facebook like blocking the feed; stories and the chat so I can only go to Facebook Groups that are high-value which will help me achieve my long term goals. I only allow myself to go on Facebook groups for a limited time on selected days of the week. 

I started this on 01/01/2020 and today at the time of writing this is my second day and I fake awake, concentrated and I spend my time that I conquered back on watching courses from my Plex server, I read books and forums. I have not seen a “model girl” for 2 days now and it feels amazing. 

This post that you shared gave me the idea to delete Spotify too because I listen to music and I guess I can go on extra Monk Mode. Maybe I will replace Spotify with Podcasts only. 

I would like to know who else is doing this and if you are doing it, please lets share information and experiences to help each other. 

Amazing post! Thank you for reposting it and huge respect for the original poster. I wonder how is he now and what is he doing because I am on his path of doing the same, I will just saw this post so I might as well remove Spotify too."
ConfrontingChaos,fcsd1wv,t1_fcs2qg5,1577914835.0,The real world yes is very nasty place. All those backpackers that are solo travellers face dangers and I have seen their side in Facebook groups. Some talk like its so great and amazing and ignore the dangers of travelling. There are people that remind them that the world is a dangerous place. You want to get a glimpse of how cruel people are? Check out few gore websites. The first time I almost passed out while I was standing... so better be seated when checking out. The book “Ordinary Men: Police Battalion 101” also describes in detail human cruelty. One must always keep that in mind.
ConfrontingChaos,fcrlc8q,t3_eikwf3,1577903308.0,"That sounds really exiting. It is not something that many can dare to do. I think it is the way we are made. If you look at the animal kingdom, the job of the parent is to raise their children to some point and from one point onwards,  they are by themselves. One must take responsibility’s and bear the challenges of the world. 

Being alone and independent is great to some extent, and living with parents has some benefits as well as some negatives. I guess a lot of the benefits of living with a family is short term compared to living alone, which has long terms benefits because you get yourself ready for the real world, you make mistakes and learn by yourself without having somebody to blame.

Its is very brave of you to step forward into the world with only $50 to $5 000. You mentioned that even you are ready to face homelessness?! It reminds me of the movie “Into the Wild”. Good luck and please keep us updated."
dataisbeautiful,fcqbltz,t1_fcq9ku4,1577882791.0,I get what you means. Its same with commute/travel. One can read while commuting/travelling and is hard to prioritise that.

getdisciplined,fcm3pjk,t1_fcm0loc,1577763432.0,"I think of low-value activities as any activity that is longer than 5-15 minutes which will not benefit me in the long term. For example, scrolling on social media like Instagram can go on for hours on end. Ask yourself the question, ""What valuable piece of information I am gaining from this?"", ""How does it benefit me right now and will it benefit me in the future?"", ""Will I thank myself in the future that I did this activity?"". If the answer is ""No"", then why are you doing it?  


High-value activity is any activity that will benefit you and you will thank yourself for it. Like reading even just for 10 minutes, watching a Udemy course (or any other), reading informative forum content, planning, organising and the list goes on. By learning some piece of information that you can apply in your job, school, or hobby area, you are doing a high-value activity. Remember, usually high-value activities have a reward that comes after (no instantaneous reward), compared to a low-value activity which has instantaneous no effort-reward (like masturbation or scrolling to see the next picture on your Instagram feed)."
