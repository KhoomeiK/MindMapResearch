Once a phone is made it needs to be used until it is no longer repairable- then broken down to be Re-used.  Ethics in the supply chain are problematic, that must be addressed. This phone I’m on I *did* buy new a few years ago- it was an older model even then but it continues to function well, and will last me many more years- where it might go wrong is if, in order to force me to purchase again, it’s software and firmware become obsolete- but like supply ethics, that’s not a problem of the phone but the consumer economics which must be changed."
