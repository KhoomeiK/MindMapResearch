You can be an unskilled mechanic at Walmart making minimum wage like my in law is, or you can spend 2-3 years in trade school actually learning the skill and make more money or even roll out on your own as a new business. But trade schools also require tuition, and until we subsidize these things for young people, we are going to have the same old problems.

Also, fuck this idea that only blue collar jobs are inherently hard work. People go to university to avoid doing physically punishing labor that can easily be automated. People die of workplace injuries and things like silicosis. That's not the life I want people to lead."

ThriftStoreHauls,fg8u1in,t3_ex72jb,1580629646.0,Oh I had a pair of cargo pants/joggers that were exactly like Kim's mission pants. Still keep them in my closet because I love them even though they're super old. Treasure the pants OP.
bathandbodyworks,fg8tbbz,t3_excrtr,1580629365.0,"I gave my SIL my bottle because she loved it so much, then they discontinued it. Now we're both sad. If I wasn't on a low-buy, I'd grab this (and the Black Amethyst that's still apparently on sale)."
bathandbodyworks,fg8t3jc,t1_fg7o6ez,1580629289.0,"It's a real boozy smell...kind of like rum infused with dark berries, with an after smell of vanilla. It's a real unique smell; I miss BBW's 2004-2010 run where they had a lot of unique fragrances rather than just fruit juices in the body care lines. Now it seems like they spend more time on the candles."
BeautyEmpties,fg8su8j,t3_exb21v,1580629121.0,Props for finishing FitMe powder. I don't think I'll ever finish mine. Which is weird since I have hit pan on my past powders.
asianamerican,fg8sfsv,t1_fg7qtm9,1580628926.0,"I'm not Korean, but that's how I got hooked onto K-dramas, even before they took off in the states (basic cable meant I was stuck watching PBS and whatever foreign channels we got). There are a lot of ""little guy/girl with big dreams"" K-dramas, and when I've been at my lowest points, they were like crack to me. The characters go through incredible hardship that I've seen mirrored in my own life, but they somehow find the strength to get back up."

ABCDesis,fg8p9pw,t1_fg7fp5r,1580627409.0,"Same, as did my parents and my sibling. We even phone banked for swing states. None of what we worked for ended up helping. I feel powerless."
PanPorn,fg4ewgo,t1_fg4awdt,1580502158.0,"The moisturizing cleanser is my favorite thing they make! Everything else BURNS LIKE THE DEVIL after I get threaded, but with that cleanser, no irritation at all."

PanPorn,fg481kc,t1_fg3fkae,1580498113.0,"FYI that is the WORST product in Simple's lineup. It was gritty and irritating and didn't do shit except dry out skin and make acne worse. I love the non exfoliating facial cleansers from the company, but anything from the witch hazel line sucks."
bathandbodyworks,fg47od9,t1_fg45rj6,1580497887.0,I'm like this with the body creams and FFMs/perfumes from other brands too. At least yours can be reasonably used. Mine collection will rot unless I overspray daily.
SapphoAndHerFriend,fg473a3,t1_femvrer,1580497526.0,He also initially refused to work with Audrey Hepburn in Charade because he felt he was too old to be reasonably dating her. All around decent dude.

ffacj,fg45hca,t1_ffpsomn,1580496566.0,"I felt the same way when I saw the Christmas clearance and noticed the price went down from 25 cents a box of cards to 10 cents. I bought more, because why the hell wouldn't I want an extra box of cards with an adorable moose that says ""Merry Christmoose"" on it?"
