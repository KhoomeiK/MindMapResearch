In what way is the above statement not tactful?

I think it is fair for people to be upset that pro-lifers don't support abortions until they think they might need to have one themselves. It is short-sighted and hypocritical of them, and pro-life policies are literally responsible for killing people who have been denied abortions that they needed for medical reasons, [like this woman.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_of_Savita_Halappanavar)

Overall, you should plan for recovery to take 2-3 months in total. You might recover faster, but many people (including myself) have had much slower recovery times than the doctor would lead you to believe."

I think it's important to underscore how true this really is. A while back I was casually considering the idea of enlisting in the national guard and I was looking up how the pay and benefits work. I learned that some of the compensation is tied to whether or not you serve during a ""wartime period."" So I looked up how that was defined, and I was a little surprised by what I found:  [https://www.benefits.va.gov/pension/wartimeperiod.asp](https://www.benefits.va.gov/pension/wartimeperiod.asp)

That doesn't sound accurate. Usually they will say, ejaculate 28-30 times before you deliver a sperm sample to the lab for testing. Then wait for the results, and if the test results say no sperm, THEN you can ejaculate inside your wife.

If you skipped the first step, you should probably go do the sperm sample for the fertility test ASAP. I had mine done and it still showed a small amount of sperm. I haven't been in the for the second test yet, but the doctor said there is still a small chance of pregnancy."

Because if he feels pressured by you one way or another and then regrets the decision later, it will be a recipe for resentment.

Plus, he might not always be married to you. What if it doesn't work out? What if you get a divorce? Would he consider wanting to have children with someone else in that situation? If so, I would advise him not to get a vasectomy.

As everyone else has said, you should consider it to be permanent. There is no guarantee of reversal. That is also what the doctor will tell him during the consultation, and many doctors will likely refuse to perform the procedure if the patient is not committed to avoiding pregnancy. The chances of a successful reversal go down dramatically after just a few years.

Just give it time. You'll feel better eventually. Don't get sucked into thinking there is a massive problem just because you aren't totally better after a week or two like some of the other guys who have had this done. Healing can take a while."
