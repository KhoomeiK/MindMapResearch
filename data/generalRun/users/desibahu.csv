politics,fdi8fax,t1_fdhrljw,1578437594.0,"Have a close friend who used to have no interest in politics, but had mildly center-left leanings. A coworker got him watching One America News Network (the channel for people who find Fox too liberal), claiming it's the most unbiased news source ever. Now it's like he's been body snatched or developed a brain tumor or something, because there's no conspiracy theory he's not eager to embrace."

politics,fdezlqx,t1_fdet4z0,1578349986.0,"Since what's out there right now is almost entirely bootleg, it's just advertising for them, not financially supporting them, fwiw."
orlando,fde6jzo,t1_fde1ob4,1578332283.0,"Any woman who's not a Democrat is just doing it in the hopes she'll get ""picked,"" which clearly explains high profile conservative women with liberal husbands. It couldn't possibly be that Mary Matalin has decided she prefers one party's platform over another. It must be that she thinks James Carville will like her more if she... disagrees with him. Women don't have brains, you know, so if they're not voting pro-choice because of their bodily makeup it must be because they are man-seeking. 

I'm dismayed by the ""howdy modi"" deal going on with US Indians who are also Trumpists, though I suppose it's not surprising that people who support a supremacist authoritarian in the subcontinent would also support one in the US, even though he's white. But it wouldn't occur to me to say they should all vote Democrat because they're brown any more than I'd expect them all to vote Aam Aadmi because they're not Brahmin, much as I'd want them to vote that way because the party is morally better."
AmItheAsshole,fdcn1em,t1_fdcc5lr,1578278973.0,"Tough adult things like ""your father is also your grandfather and you were conceived via rape,"" sure. But what expert recommends waiting a decade to tell a kid they're adopted? Isn't it generally accepted practice nowadays to bring them up always knowing that, which is why some baby books have tear-out pages so you can put adoption info instead of pregnancy/birth info and there's books for toddlers about adoption?"
AmItheAsshole,fdbykpf,t1_fd9ort3,1578263905.0,"Food while on the job is pretty common, and remuneration for using your own car to drive the employer's children is standard (or, in households with enough spare vehicles, providing a work vehicle and permanently installed car seats and so forth for nanny's use while on the job). For live-in situations there generally seems to be a ""you're one of the family, help yourself to what's in the fridge even when you're not on the clock"" understanding. But I don't know of any people who have a nanny who lives on her own (coming to their house during the work day) who separately pay for apartment, food while off work, a car for personal use, etc.  But it may be regional differences, so if you told me that that's the standard in Berlin or rural Pennsylvania or some place with which you're familiar and I'm not, then I'll believe you!"
AmItheAsshole,fdbxizr,t1_fdbfa2j,1578263501.0,"She probably has an employment contract with paid time off and concepts such as sick time laid out; most household staff positions allow for consumption of the same food as the family, although some may be expected to bring their own food. A lot of apartments have utilities and even tv/internet included (which is part of why the ""you're not poor, you have cable!"" argument is silly), but if not then I'm sure who pays for it is also in the employment contract."

YouShouldKnow,fdb5a4h,t1_fd9zjt9,1578253971.0,"Those blue-white super bright regular beams used to have ads on TV talking about how great and extra safe they were because (showing a completely empty road) they increase your visibility so much and you can see so much more when you are using these much better and safer headlights. No mention of any safety risks incurred by blinding all oncoming traffic, of course. But I'd bet most of them think they're doing a good and safe thing by having lights that increase their own driving vision so much, and that it's never crossed their mind that it's not actually a good thing."

AmItheAsshole,fdazitr,t1_fda8qfb,1578252068.0,"I must be misreading you. It looks like you're saying it's greedy and selfish *not* to demand your parents give up their jobs/homes/etc. to live with you and give you free full time childcare. (Given the current downvote tally, I must not be the only one.) Is that really what you're saying?

I mean, I certainly appreciate it when my parents and in-laws - who are employed and have busy and active adult lives - take the kids, and I thank them and don't pay them because it's voluntary and occasional, but certainly wouldn't consider telling them to give up their lives to ""strengthen the family by raising their grandchildren"" for me, especially with no compensation except free rent!"
