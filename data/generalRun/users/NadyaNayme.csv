It's a hit to his damage because he no longer will benefit from being at 100% stamina (1/1 hp) and instead is going to be at 1/xxxxHP making him benefit from Enmity instead of Stamina.

That's a huge hit to his damage for things like a cheese GOHL solo because you no longer get to benefit from the Stamina from Edens.

Of course it's a somewhat trivial change of going with an enmity grid if you want to abuse that strat but metatron daggers arent exactly as strong as Edens for multiple reasons...haven't motocalled how big a hit to his damage it ends up being."

Most people I see are either going tanky Fire with buncles or Dodge Enmity dark.

The annoying part was learning when/what the one shot triggers were to avoid them but I'm sure the wiki will have them soon if it doesn't already have them. 

If you can clear the Gold Seal off Wind God he won't do that special attack."
Granblue_en,fftd02w,t1_ffsvkb5,1580216866.0,"You use R weapons to Sk2 your SR weapons. Like hell most people waste a massive amount of fodder selling them. Feed 4 to an SR and you've doubled the value of that SR with 0 RNG (there is no RNG to weapon leveling if you do it correctly).

Also the rupies you get is such a pitiful amount I'd XP reserve any no-skill weapons and just slime/campaign quest a little with rupiee journey drop up whenever you're short on change."
