Reaper,ffofgvs,t1_ffocspi,1580077145.0,I don’t think any other DAWs really have more features. You can do pretty much anything in Reaper. I’ve heard people say that Pro Tools is easier for editing audio but then again a lot of people move from Pro Tools to Reaper because they find it better.

patientgamers,ffen3rb,t1_ffdz50i,1579855344.0,"I'm totally the opposite. I get bored to death by Farcry because it seems like they're just filling the map with as many side missions as possible, that don't really have any substance to them. Even a lot of the main missions feel the same. Rescuing hostages, uncovering ammo dumps, turning on radios, etc. Same with Ghost Recon: Wildlands, I loved that game to death but started getting bored of it after a while because the missions were all the same. Felt the same about Spider-Man too, but at least the game made it very clear that the side missions were just a bit of fun and could ignore them by all means.
