Take photographs of absolutely everything (so you will know where it goes 2 years later) Label absolutely everything with where the piece was located (ex: night light knob rear bathroom over sink) Save everything until you are done your reno. 

Don't worry about a tow vehicle, you have at least about 2 years of renos ahead of you.

An enclosed space is pretty much essential. You may have to rent a barn or something similar to work on your camper but if you don't have the skills to do this yourself, you might be better off hiring a reputable company (get written estimates and references, there are a lot of shady renovators) My husband built our house and does all his own mechanic work and he still found the Airstream challenging. You are working with rounded shapes. 

Our insurance company let us use the NADA value for the trailer initially while we were working on it. We have since had it professionally appraised and will get it insured for the appraised value.

Check your wiring to make sure it is not aluminium. Check your axles they will probably need replacing. Set up an account with Vintage trailer supply company, you will be sending them a lot of business. 

Good luck!"
