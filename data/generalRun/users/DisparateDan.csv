I've never seen multiple dowels inserted into a butt joint like that. Whenever I've followed plans with dowels, or even taken stuff apart and found them - it has obviously been to help alignment and not strength. I'm sure I've watched a few YT videos demonstrating that dowels don't add much support, so I'll have to try and find/review where my beliefs about this originated.

I agree that technique in your example probably adds a lot of strength. Honestly, I would have expected that drilling so many holes into end grain would weaken the integrity of the wood, but clearly 5 years in Ontario proves otherwise! I guess the glue used to hold the dowels also holds the end-grain together."
woodworking,fg0oive,t3_ewa9nj,1580411944.0,"Well, you don't need to pay Festool prices, for one thing! I bought a $200 Porter Cable biscuit joiner and I've been happy with it.  

When you drill a dowel 'hole', it needs to be accurate in 3 dimensions: distance from the surface, from the end of the wood, and depth of the hole itself, on both pieces of wood. I've screwed up dowel holes so many times!

Basically, it's much less effort (and faster) to accurately align holes using a joiner than with doweling jigs. In either case, the point of dowels or biscuits is not really to provide joint strength but to correctly and stably align the faces to be glued together.

(I suppose it is entirely possible that there are dowel-drilling tools that provide the same easy accuracy but I've never seen one. AFAIK there is no advantage to the shape of the piece of wood being glued in)."

todayilearned,ffyho7i,t3_evwpbp,1580346666.0,"I think it's because so far as we know, no other animal is intellectually aware of its own mortality, and therefore capable of contemplating ending its own existence. 

However, I'm sure that there are some animals (eg primates or cetaceans) that are able to grasp the concept of death by observing it in other creatures, and of extrapolating that to their own sense of self. But whether any of those creatures ever experience a sense of profound unhappiness or dissatisfaction enough to want to die, we may never know."
todayilearned,ffyhcmu,t1_ffygode,1580346450.0,"That's kinda true of humans in a lot of places too. Generally speaking, to return a verdict of suicide the inquest has to verify that the deceased was of sound mind and capable of grasping the consequences of their actions, which basically means ruling out any mental illness, which is at the root of many suicidal behaviors in humans.

So if you wish to end your life you must be mentally ill, and if you are mentally ill, you cannot commit suicide (but you can end your own life through misadventure, for example)."

lotr,ffj6g64,t1_ffiqhjp,1579991590.0,"No, I think I got your main point. I'm not thinking that Elves would regard Men as pets per se, but might experience such relationships like a human outliving a series of beloved creatures, remembering each relationship with affection despite the passage of time.

But I think while initially they were surprised by the short lives of Men, it was something they became accustomed to, because it was something external to their own world experience. Their own regrets and despair were more in relation to the world itself falling short of perfection and decaying, because of the lasting effects of Melkor's malice. 

I imagine for us, a closer analogy might be the existential dread that modern people experience at the prospects of climate change, environmental catastrophe, endless war, economic and political tribalism, etc, and wishing to take some steps to preserve an idealized life against it all.

So, for her, yes, rejecting the One was a momentous decision. How does that play into the relationship between Elves and Men?"
