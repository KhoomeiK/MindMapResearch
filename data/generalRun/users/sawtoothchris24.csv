When I installed optifine, it wouldnt let me extract it into my ftb, so I installed vanilla 1.12.2, which I was unable to even launch, however I was able to extract it into my ftb after that. After launching ftb optifine wasnt showing up in the mods section of the menu. Also every time I tried to click on the shader I installed, my game would freeze then crash. Help would be appreciated.

spicy,feecidi,t1_fed5w34,1579030932.0,Yes! The only sauce I got from Pepper Palce that wasnt made with carrots was the Tres Diablos. It is actually my favorite so far. For being a reaper sauce the king reaper really isnt that spicy.
spicy,feeccx3,t1_fed9rd2,1579030843.0,I have never seen it in a store. I bought this one on Amazon. Not sure if it would ship to U.K but worth a go. It is definitely my favorite Tobasco sauce. It has some serious heat.
