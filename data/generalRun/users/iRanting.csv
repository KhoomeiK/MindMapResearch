If someone else had the same reasoning as you he'd probably ask the same thing. Given the fact that climate change is impending and we would definitely feel the effects of it soon, humans just turn a blind eye to it and keep on living in hope that something will change.

Guess when it really hits and humanity is convinced enough people might really die at that rate"

depression,fcwqgoz,t1_fcwk7be,1578033617.0,"if you're going through bad stuff like this you should know how selfish depression is. eventually whether we like it or not it will kill us then kill the rest, like cancer.

iv'e just accepted the nature of it. since inherently it is selfish then might as well. why bother suffering the would be guilt with my impending death? might as well die fast and quick without anyone knowing."
depression,fcwjpst,t3_ejaeoy,1578027484.0,Whats so unfortunate about death anyway? people hear it daily. it doesnt matter like the crowd of the depressed here. i only hope those who are happy continue to be.
