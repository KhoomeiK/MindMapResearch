If it is a rant about a man that doesn’t do chores, change the title/change the sub. Also, guess what, women don’t do chores too! Don’t make this exclusively about gender. 

It’s stuff like this that make some men think that feminism just means ‘hatred of men’.

I’d just like to say how horribly patronising and sexist this is. Seriously, if a man ever said anything like this we would be lambasted.
