PublicFreakout,fgm7l5i,t1_fgk7mwr,1580919468.0,Thank you for sharing the article. This guy is fucking scum. He should be charged with all the crimes his dogs inflicted on those poor people.
PublicFreakout,fgm5jwu,t3_ez8hcz,1580918376.0,not saying people should be able to be publicly beaten but these folks are definitely a consequence of our societies restraint.
PublicFreakout,fgid54q,t3_eyhvyl,1580817475.0,"These types of people are produced when everyone just ""minds your own business"""

SamandTolki,fg458d2,t3_ewflz0,1580496420.0,God hbox is such a diva lol. At least hes a lot better than what he was.
SamandTolki,fg3y1ae,t3_ewr5le,1580492092.0,The voices of these concerned fans is a true testament to how boogies manipulative bullshit effects those around him. Not like he gives a shit.
SamandTolki,fg3xm4y,t3_ewr5le,1580491836.0,Impressive find! Thanks for sharing.

PublicFreakout,fg3qkrs,t1_fg3pm5j,1580487531.0,And you're caught up in symbolism.
PublicFreakout,fg3mxic,t1_fg3kem8,1580485275.0,"If they didn't use their key and wasn't personally acquainted then hell yeah, you would be a foolish to do otherwise. I have a responsibility to those who live around me to not behave recklessly. 

A tortilla curtain sounds delicious and I want one."
PublicFreakout,fg3fspw,t1_fg3fgu6,1580480423.0,"downvotes mean nothing, its the content of your words."
PublicFreakout,fg3f07f,t1_fg3dhoi,1580479830.0,lmao you thought you had something with this one.
PublicFreakout,fg38e6v,t1_fg37wvi,1580474233.0,Have you ever lived in an apartment or are you in a comfy house? Mine got hit twice this holiday season. Foh for me being concerned with safety and you calling it racist. I aint letting NO ONE in behind me.
PublicFreakout,fg37efi,t1_fg3714r,1580473240.0,"You know nothing about my story or my skin color, it's foolish to assume such things. 

The fact that anyone lives there is actually irrelevant. Its standard apartment policy to not let tailgaters inside. You have a key/keypad combination? Use it like everyone else."
PublicFreakout,fg3769t,t1_fg36oxk,1580473003.0,This thread is peak irony. People are getting really butt hurt about her possibly profiling this guy while they racially profile the living shit out of her lol.
PublicFreakout,fg36qt0,t1_fg36fwi,1580472547.0,This exactly. My whole perspective of the incident hinges on that moment.
PublicFreakout,fg36kg8,t1_fg36bqv,1580472353.0,Very true.
PublicFreakout,fg36891,t3_ewmjxq,1580471976.0,Everyone is so thirsty for their racist karen content that they are ignoring that this dude forced his way into an apartment building while the women is leaving. We all know criminals target these complex's and that is certainly one of the methods of getting inside. Most renters realize that this is a valid concern and just use their own key as confirmation they live there. Thats clearly what this dude should have done. She even asked him to use the keypad and he doesnt even acknowledge the request. She fucked up hard by following him and if she was in that much of a tizzy she should have just called the apartment manager.
PublicFreakout,fg35cx4,t1_fg34n1y,1580470986.0,because karen is the flavor of the month stereotype right now.
PublicFreakout,fg34t6b,t1_fg2qcs7,1580470328.0,Fair clarification.

SamandTolki,ffwaplh,t1_ffw68hw,1580292811.0,he loves to mention the girls he finds attractive in front of hila and always plays it off as them being secure enough in their relationship for him to do it.
PublicFreakout,ffuwx62,t1_ffuw21x,1580250902.0,"yup, its the classic. idiot bystander pulls off the good guy and then the criminal who was just freed up starts whaling on both of them."
PublicFreakout,ffpqrl7,t3_eu5wss,1580102414.0,Pro-Palestine folks never keep that same energy with oppressed ethnic tribes in African countries.
PublicFreakout,ffpqlo9,t1_ffnamvb,1580102261.0,How do you know he's american? How is he responsible for said deaths? Are you actually retarded enough to believe America has killed the most people in the past 100 years?
PublicFreakout,ffoso8i,t1_ffoly3e,1580081215.0,and dont you forget it
PublicFreakout,ffogjth,t1_ffns9o6,1580077392.0,dont worry about what happens at the top
PublicFreakout,ffofmne,t1_ffn9i1n,1580077196.0,Thank you.... I feel like im in the twilight zone any time i enter cartnarc threads. Clearly he doesnt care about the carts and just wants to get content out of getting people upset.
SamandTolki,ffl8wdy,t3_eu5bk4,1580036493.0,lol he tried to pull that same excuse on EDDF.

SamandTolki,ffgnqfq,t1_ffgmmso,1579910524.0,"Thank you, I share this exact sentiment. The whole reason this sub  became boogie focused is bc it became a refuge for ex fans who were disappointed with his actions."

SamandTolki,ffg76ge,t1_ffg6wt3,1579899923.0,I know its a bit played out but... Mr Rogers of the internet ladies and gentlemen...
SamandTolki,ffg5eg1,t1_ffg4f6q,1579898828.0,Before privating his alt account he posted the article captioning that Newsweek just happened to pick the story up when its seems fairly obvious that he orchestrated to have this article to be in concert with his expose video. Just another example of his gaslighting tactics. You should add it to the Megathread 2.0
SamandTolki,ffg276m,t3_etaoo4,1579896856.0,lol this post just got quoted in the newsweek article boogie orchestrated https://www.newsweek.com/boogie2988-youtube-controversy-samandtolki-reddit-interview-1483936

SamandTolki,ffevabj,t1_ffeuxl6,1579867058.0,"They are off grifting somewhere else. You hit the nail on the head, Nugget and ManchildBehindaCamera are only friendly to boogie when it is in their benefit. When he goes through these manic breaks they are no where to be found."
SamandTolki,ffes91f,t3_et8rxh,1579863054.0,How is Keemcunt the voice of sanity in all of this... Its so clear that other youtubers are holding back.

SamandTolki,ffenpl8,t3_et7e42,1579856237.0,"get the replies to his tweets too. shout out to JeffProbsTest, Bruh my weed, and others for making that thread a very entertaining read lol."
Cringetopia,ffelf02,t1_ffejh4m,1579853017.0,"He's a serial manipulator with a twitter addiction who is obsessed with being the center of attention. Dude is a serious basket case who has joined the likes of DSP, Wings, Chrischan, and other lolcows."
SamandTolki,ffejab4,t3_et6o7n,1579850315.0,Prediction: I think Boogie is going to release an extremely cringey and poorly made rebuttal video sometime soon and in it he will ask his fans to mass report this subreddit.
Cringetopia,ffej4gw,t1_ffeizhk,1579850117.0,"I swear, this guy makes more content for r/samandtolki than he does for his fanbases that still cares for him. There is now a megathread part 2 that I recommend you check out if you havent already."

SamandTolki,ffbovsq,t3_espyvs,1579776325.0,this is top tier cringe material.
PublicFreakout,ff8jzj8,t1_ff82ue5,1579682076.0,It's absolutely ridiculous. They actively protect the criminals while leaving vulnerable law abiding citizens to fend for themselves. SFPD and the mayors office is and has been incredibly corrupt. There time will come eventually but many will suffer and die in the mean time.

science,fey3810,t1_fexuoth,1579440188.0,"Oh please, you are here on reddit giving your sob story. There are people who don't even have electricity and running water... You frankly don't sound like you know what youre talking about and most likely need to speak with loved ones about your distorted feelings on life. Id suggest having some perspective of what having it hard can truly be. Even though you have it tough its the only life you will ever have so if you choose to not make the most out of it squander it away know this: You resigned yourself to have lived the totality of your life in a wretched state by making a permanent decision based off of a temporary situation. There certainly isnt a heaven but id say an eternity of nothingness is pretty close to hell, why rush our way there. None of what you said justifies wanting to kill yourself either, and btwmy comment had nothing to do with abortion."

SamandTolki,femo499,t3_epyfqb,1579264361.0,Bro boogie is so obsessed with this sub. Low key feel like he makes his content more for us than his actual fans nowadays.

todayilearned,felifpm,t1_felf5dl,1579222935.0,I think its because humans give respect to the dead in the hope others will reciprocate when they pass on. There is an old Roman saying i find relatable about how a man dies first in life and lastly in the final utterance of his name.
