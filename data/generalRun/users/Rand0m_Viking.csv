SWGalaxyOfHeroes,fdjajpv,t3_elldhr,1578463323.0,If you use multiple devices or an emulator in addition to your primary one you'll definitely get them a ton as it seems to track energy based on how much you had the last time you logged in on that device.
todayilearned,fccthz9,t1_fccq8vc,1577602444.0,"Yes but this is a thread about fox being shitty for cancelling a good show. Fox aired futurama, then brought it back. Don't get me wrong, I love my share of adult swim shows but I'm more loyal to the creators than some higher ups who have proven they can be as petty and dumb as the people at fox. This just made me worry that many other shows I like might get shitcanned for as little reason or explanation."
todayilearned,fcbgg67,t1_fcbfgi1,1577586557.0,Can only hope that the show they did at adult swim festival was an olive branch and AS are ready to stop being idiots.
