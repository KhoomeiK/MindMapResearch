gaming,fedyy4k,t3_eomjqv,1579022839.0,"Those two AC games needs a fairly good PC to run properly. CPU especially since they seem to draw quite a bit of power from the CPU instead of putting the load fully onto the GPU. I have a old FX-6300 6 core cpu, and a GTX 1050ti 4gb GPU, and I have to run it at low-med 1080p to have stable FPS. So, I don't think, even without the crashing, that your laptop can handle these games."

GenderCritical,fdgpgqe,t3_el8q1g,1578404839.0,"I firmly believe men do not have the capacity to emphasize or understand the struggles we as women go through. They also don't *want* to, since it all comes down to acknowledging that they are the main reason for violence against women and sex-based injustice. That's why your conversation went like it did with your male friend. I, myself had a very good gay male friend a few years ago, but I soon realised he didn't see women as women but as objects that only serve a specific purpose and because I am a lesbian he didn't see me as a ""woman"" but more as a man. I ended our friendship soon after and recently saw he is a very ""high regarded"" drag queen. Which didn't surprise me at all, considering his views. I would suggest you give up on your friend, the points he made and the ""victim blaming"" attitude he has, are clear warning signs."

Overwatch,fc17uwi,t3_eff4jt,1577310751.0,"I recently had a game where we were losing bad, until we ended up with 2 Soldier 76s, 2 Pharahs and 2 Mercys. I was a Mercy and take a guess who we both pocketed. It was a slaughterhouse, the enemy team couldn't recover even in the slightest. The other comps I find unfair are 2+ barrier tanks, 2 Junkrats, 2 Torbjorns or 2 Bastions with 2 barrier tanks. I do pretty well on most heroes, except Genji, Junkrat and Doomfist. I always try and get killed fast when I spawn as either. Im no help to the team if I can't hit anything lol."
Overwatch,fc16mab,t3_eflge2,1577309745.0,"I find that by playing in the Arcade section, it really improves how you play since any level plays there (from what I understand, I am still a relatively new player myself at almost a month, so please take what I say with a grain of salt, it could be complete BS), as opposed to the same level of players you find in quick play. Almost like the saying ""throw yourself into deep water to learn how to swim"". Try and focus on one or two heroes from each class you really like/find easy to play and stick with them for a bit. For me, I really took to Bastion, Soldier 76, Moira, Mercy, Roadhog and D.va. Ashe too, but damn, for me, her scoped shots are insanely hard to hit, even more so than Widowmaker's! It also helps by getting know the characters in depth, so that you can know when to persue a enemy that you got to low health, but then managed to escape. It helps no one running after a low Roadhog just have his heal up, hook you and one shot you, or a Moira healing herself and killing you, a Mcree to stun and kill you... you get the point."
