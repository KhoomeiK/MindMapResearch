If it's got a bunch of pins, it's IDE. You can get a cheap USB-sata/ide adapter on amazon, plug the hard drive in, if it's not completely dead, it will show up on your computer and you can copy your mods folder (& the rest of your important data)"

battlestations,fcndzlc,t1_fcmuyp9,1577809721.0,"the worst thing about gaming on a Mac is lack of directX. Yes, windows gaming is better, but if you have to use a Mac, it's not a completely terrible experience. I had an iMac 2013 and it ran Minecraft at 90fps fine and 45 with shaders, and ts4 at 60fps. Macs have gotten a bad rep for gaming because they previously had a huge lack of support, but it's gotten better, windows is better, but if you are stuck with an old Mac, you can game on it."
