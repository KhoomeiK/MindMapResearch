SuicideWatch,fc1eqtl,t1_fc1eblu,1577316566.0,Alrighty. Well good luck man I hope you have a better Xmas than the one your having
SuicideWatch,fc1e7at,t1_fc1e3hx,1577316102.0,The past is the past you gotta look at every day as a new one and a fresh start to do better. You don’t have to go all out but make small progress every day that’s all that counts
SuicideWatch,fc1dhe4,t1_fc14ljo,1577315487.0,How do you know you don’t have a future if you haven’t even turned 21 yet? Don’t use your dad as an excuse to pity yourself that’s the worst thing you can do is play the blame game that’s just avoiding a lot of problems
SuicideWatch,fc11amw,t1_fc10yn0,1577305403.0,Thanks. Same to you. There has to be a better life out there...
SuicideWatch,fc0zswi,t3_efgubk,1577304191.0,Hey are you still here with us? We all love you. I know that sounds cheesy but we are all here for each other.
SuicideWatch,fc0zpr3,t3_efa9ka,1577304121.0,I want to leave my ugly physical body and move on in spirit to a happier place. I know exactly how you feel. I’m worthless as well. It’s the worst feeling ever when you know your a POS. I hate this life... I need to go see a psychiatrist
SuicideWatch,fc0zkck,t3_efiqhh,1577303998.0,I’m right there with you
SuicideWatch,fc0zhyi,t1_fc0z17m,1577303944.0,Thank you. I’m just so tired of this vicious cycle of getting clean and the blacking our making a fool of myself and getting clean etc etc.. I really want to fly to Mexico and get some pharmaceuticals and end it in a hotel room. I had 4 months of complete sobriety and was feeling on top of the world. I come home to Alabama for Christmas and I get belligerent. I’ve been through so much in my life. I was molested by my neighbor when I was 7 and used for child pornography. My best friend who I grew up with since we were 3 years old killed himself a couple years ago. That was my only friend and I hung out with him every day for 20 years. I’m not the same happy person I used to be. I’m done letting myself and everyone down. I can’t handle this much longer..
SuicideWatch,fc0yu72,t3_efi486,1577303408.0,Hey man. I was the same way when I was your age. I’m 26 now. Please give yourself time to mature and give adult life a chance. Things change when you mature and grow older and discover finer things in life.
SuicideWatch,fc0y051,t3_efh3qn,1577302734.0,Worse Christmas ever. I relapsed and everyone is so mad/upset at me. I ruined Christmas. I’m done with life and trying to please everyone. I honestly want to end things because I can’t stay sober longer than 3-4 months at a time. I’m ready to take the burden off my family.
SuicideWatch,fc0xs5d,t1_fc00kfm,1577302555.0,Why are people downvoting a good suggestion? Becoming a firefighter is t easy but the hard work pays off. My friend is one
motivation,fbvhueo,t3_eejz5w,1577131016.0,Awesome. I got my eyes fixed on the back left one though
