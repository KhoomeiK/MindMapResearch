iOSProgramming,fgnoa26,t1_fgijj6c,1580949247.0,Only now (2020) does what you suggest make sense. ABI wasn’t stable before. Objective-C is more dynamic than Swift so adopting swift would have more implications that most people realize upfront.
iOSProgramming,fghtzrf,t3_eyhehh,1580793818.0,"There aren’t any. My biggest qualm with the iOS community is everyone online went rushing to support and gawk at Swift. I have stayed on Objective C because I have largely worked alone or in tiny teams and don’t have the manpower to update swift every time a new version of Xcode comes out and breaks my app. 

For the past half decade I’ve needed to convert whatever I found online from swift to objective c. Disappointing really."

iOSProgramming,fggl1bo,t3_eycxyb,1580764080.0,Experienced dev here who hasn’t bothered to use storyboards much (I still prefer xibs). Was wondering if there was a **quick** tutorial out there with regards to working with storyboards. Namely linking to other storyboards and making and editing connections. And then the corresponding segue lifecycle. Thanks.

iOSProgramming,fg8ofwq,t3_exegip,1580626565.0,"Oh sorry, missed that you need beta distribution. I know it has crash reporting. And it’s analytics are more gracious in terms of how many custom events are created. 

I have just only recently switched to it after attempting to integrate amazon mobile sdk and firebase but they are very user unfriendly and poorly documented for objective c legacy projects back when I was working on the integration so they lost my business. 

I know flurry isn’t as popular as the competition but I think you should give it a look."

You pick your battles and if you throw tantrums at the drop of a hat you are asking to be blacklisted by not only your employer, word gets around.

You should recognize that as a user if you don’t like a certain platforms’ stances you have the option to not use it (boycott). That’s the biggest slap in the face to any product maker. You as a user should organize and walk out on YouTube instead. Don’t put it on the developers to further your interests while you sit on the couch watching YouTube. That’s entitlement right there."
iOSProgramming,ffybao5,t3_evp2ou,1580342350.0,"Unless you know of something you need to build that hasn’t been done before look at what’s it there, fork it, and improve upon it. That conveys the ability to work with a foreign code base and looks better than you making some small library that isn’t very popular. But it depends, if you can make something really pretty you can make a stand-alone open source project and have all the nontechnical hiring folk be impressed by it."

streetlightmanifesto,ff7r0pe,t1_ff7koor,1579656255.0,"Are you a fan of jazz music? Or are you using the word jazzy to describe horn instrumentation? Orchestrative I can see, jazzy I cannot unless you can point me to a specific example."
streetlightmanifesto,ff5imu5,t3_eqxu7u,1579594600.0,"This band doesn’t really have jazz elements so I’m a bit confused. If by jazz you mean horns over punk then I think the majority of what has been suggested will fit your request. 

If you are actually looking for a ska band that incorporates jazz into their songs then check out Fatter Than Albert. https://youtu.be/uINXEsEQHyM

Otherwise if you are looking for a band similar to SM’s orchestra sound that includes gypsy elements. Check out Stand Out Riot: https://youtu.be/60r_CNYsGuY"
iOSProgramming,ff5hxg9,t1_ff461ku,1579593663.0,"I hear ya and what you mention is why I’ll never apply to Google especially because their CS questions are brutally insane for the work you actually end up doing. They are off the deep end on their interview questions and I won’t stand for that.

I still think big questions like JSON diff and write a PEMDAS expression calculator are good questions to pass by candidates. I don’t expect it to be 100% as I wouldn’t have a flawless performance if I were in that position but it’s more to see how candidate walks through a problem and how certain gotchas are encountered, etc. At a previous role I gave a candidate the PEMDAS calculator problem and he ended up getting so nervous he was sweating like crazy took awhile and didn’t end up solving it. But we still ended up making the hire because we still liked what we saw. 

A lot of it is not getting inside your head too much. I respect your decision to walk out an interview where you are faced with these questions to bring about change to the way these interviews are done but if you actually walked out that reflects really poorly on any candidate. For instance the candidate that did poorly on the expression calculator problem I gave him. Had he walked out he would seal his fate for doing so. 

I am still if the thought that there is a place for these kinds of problems but am all about being open to better methods."
iOSProgramming,ff2t2rv,t1_ff2e76w,1579522987.0,Good questions/topics to cover. I like to cover a bit of cs fundamentals typically during the phone screen and a bit onsite and then have the candidate work on a project on their own computer for a portion of the onsite.
iOSProgramming,ff2dh94,t1_ff2cyhu,1579501704.0,I’ll agree that there are better things to test a candidate on but CS basics should be covered unless you don’t mind hiring boot campers that are adept at googling and following tutorials online. I guess we’ll have to agree to disagree.
iOSProgramming,ff2ayoa,t1_ff29cnd,1579499153.0,"Have you interviewed others or had to filter through dozens of applicants? I have. There are reasons it’s done. Just because you don’t like it doesn’t mean it’s a poor practice or irrelevant. Take your cynicism elsewhere please.

I’m all for standing up to shady practices like disguising real work as take home exercises and boycotting interviewing with companies that don’t give sufficient feedback or ghost you after going through the interview process with them."
iOSProgramming,ff0yfih,t1_fezbx5e,1579473489.0,"If you want to adopt a cross platform framework look into react native, it’s the leader right now and is very similar to react web dev. So after learning react native you can carry a lot of that knowledge over to react on web."
iOSProgramming,ff0xp15,t1_fezbx5e,1579473334.0,Objective c isn’t going anywhere anytime soon. And I’d argue that you being an iOS dev and not knowing objective c could potentially harm your prospects unless you are only looking at startups. Some swift language features require the objective c runtime to run so I see ignorance when statements like “Objective-C is dead” are made.
iOSProgramming,ff0w8xc,t1_fezkuef,1579472854.0,"Agreed. I had a brief stint as a react native engineer at a pharma-tech startup and I wasn’t happy with the dev experience. There was a lot of issues that had to do with React Native’s implementation of doing something and quirks that come along with it which caused for a lot of work arounds. A significant issue was getting the app the build and run on the simulator reliably. It would error out or just hang about 30% of the time. My biggest grievance was the fact that no one at my company debugged with a debugger. It was always done using print logs. And as a seasoned engineer that cares about best practices and about being effective while in the job, that there is heresy. 

So on my latest job hunt I went out of my way to avoid react native positions. Be careful as I’ve come across some postings that are vague and general and don’t really talk about the actual technology that the role requires you work on."
iOSProgramming,ff0teip,t1_fezx7rd,1579472088.0,This is wrong. I’m a senior iOS eng and have been in the industry for 9 years and have been through enough interviews to know what the deal is. They need to understand a candidates strengths and weaknesses and scope of knowledge so they can better determine what role or project someone would be a good fit for. Also you are being compared to all other candidates they are interviewing at that time.
iOSProgramming,ff0pwsg,t1_fezuhui,1579471192.0,"Agreed, bootcamps have over saturated the market with wannabe devs which has caused companies to toughen their interview process as a result. And it’s kinda funny because there is more demand than there is supply yet the bar to get in is relatively high.

The issue I have is more with students of boot camps completing the Bootcamp and applying for jobs immediately. What they need to do is build up their portfolio and then apply. Passion for the job needs to be conveyed through past work."
iOSProgramming,ff0of2y,t1_fezb5ky,1579470774.0,Mobile isn’t going anywhere for at LEAST the next decade. If you look at where technology is going it’s moving to the internet if things where anything and everything will have WiFi or internet capabilities and the most convenient way to interface with all these things is going to be through your phone. The thing you always have handy and has a standardized interface. Interfaces through wearables are still a long ways off from becoming the norm. Mobile is here to stay for far longer than a few years.

savethevote,feg1jvk,t1_feeiprm,1579072960.0,I’m a fan of nosql dbs (I.e. mongodb) when building things out from scratch as it doesn’t lock me down to a schema which tends to get in the way of rapid development and quick prototyping. I’m a fan of Python and using Docker to containerize various portions of the backend. I have some experience with Node and express js.
savethevote,fee8dp6,t1_fedpl80,1579028508.0,"Yeah data harvesting is going to be the trickiest part. We should combine forces perhaps? What is essential is to also include the source of where the data was retrieved.

And is your info in Python files or in cvs format or a DB of some sort?"
savethevote,fee7v96,t1_fedb956,1579028208.0,"Right. But unless a user is on their phone and goes out of their way to download an app to help motivate them to vote I don’t know what any app could really do to convince folks that aren’t interested. You have a good point but I think tackling this issue can’t really be done within the confines of an app and is more a social and educational problem.

The goal of what I’m trying to do is to make the process for voters as easy as possible. Have 1 place someone can go to understand everything they need to do in order to vote. Rather than having the onus of looking up these tidbits of information be on the average voter."

DataHoarder,fec48c6,t1_fec30pm,1578966418.0,Fair enough. But if I have instructions on how to build the machine depicted in the video it shouldn’t take as long as making it from scratch.
