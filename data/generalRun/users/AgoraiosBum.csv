France had started its offensive, but when the USSR invaded Poland from the other side, all organized Polish resistance collapsed.  

Instead of continuing to push on the Germans, the French commander decided it would be better to wait on the defensive, and implemented a plan that counted on France to stay on the defense and continue re-arming for an entire year before thinking of taking the offensive.

3B. The German western border was very lightly defended, and couldn't hold back France.  France was supposed to invade to take pressure off Poland.
