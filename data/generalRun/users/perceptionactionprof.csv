AskHistorians,fe8qzl7,t3_eo2pvr,1578929598.0,"I apologize if this does not meet community standards, delete away as needed. But were there very many Welsh immigrants? I just did a quick wikipedia search, and it states there are currently 1.9 million Americans with Welsh ancestry. Not an insignificant number.

But one problem is that it also lists the first mass migration as occurring in the late 1600s. That is old enough for those ancestries to have been forgotten and lost to time - as opposed to the Irish immigration of the mid 1800s during the famine. There appear to be small pockets in Ohio where there may in fact be some Welsh identity.

This is probably likewise similar to the paucity of Americans who identify as English in heritage. Presumably there are millions, but its largely pre-revolutionary immigration.

In contrast, wikipedia also states that around 33 million Americans identify as having Irish ancestry, over 10% of the total population. That is an order of magnitude more than the Welsh, and as stated, generally much more recent in terms of arrival.

The Scots arrived somewhere in between the Welsh and the Irish, following the Jacobite rebellion in the mid-late 1700s. Wikipedia lists as of 2010 a declining number of Scots-Americans and Scotch-Irish, but the total is around 8-9 million (of those 2 groups combined) so still significantly more than the numbers for Welsh."
