bipolar,ff8zpjx,t1_ff8zawx,1579701095.0,I’ve tried everything for sleep but most meds make me feel useless in the morning. Right now I take melatonin.  I will try emoods. Thank you.
BipolarReddit,ff2lugm,t3_er9kaj,1579512300.0,Why did you stop them? And what were you taking?
60daysin,fevcxeq,t3_eqn3ag,1579395881.0,Either of the veterans. Not these two bozos
Funnymemes,fejn7qc,t3_ephci5,1579180536.0,I know how that feels. He had in ear buds so he probably thought no one heard him shart himself
BipolarReddit,febmirb,t3_eoazho,1578960421.0,"That was last week. Start tomorrow off a different way. Write or say 5 things you are grateful for when you wake up. Try to enjoy your morning... I love coffee with whipped cream cause I’m fancy... just something extra.

You are going to encounter ignorant people. You can let that define you, destroy you or strengthen you. Kinda like your cape or your crutch. You are loved just the way you are. Fuck ‘em.

With the self harm: you know you’ve got to stop that mess. Hour-by-hour day-by-day. It takes 5 minutes for the urge to pass. So find a task to do to take your mind off of it.

Ability never worked for me. I think it was the generic cogentin. Tomorrow get in touch with your prescriber because your mental health is everything. That is all."
bipolar,febkeqb,t3_eo9xly,1578959706.0,I would buy those for my nephews! So awesome. Maybe you could take some business classes if you decided to stay in uni... regardless you are super talented.
bipolar,fe3xhho,t1_fe3szo1,1578853761.0,I was in my early 20s also.
bipolar,fe38ufz,t1_fe351lw,1578847055.0,I wish I was as brave as you. My parents outed me after my first psychotic break. They told most of my extended family so I’ve never felt completely comfortable opening up about it except for NAMI meetings.
bipolar,fe33zvy,t1_fe30wi7,1578845709.0,I was misdiagnosed too. I see that as a recurring theme.
BipolarReddit,fe2ypy3,t3_enig2h,1578844321.0,Shit. Mine are 100mg tablets and I’ve had vertigo ever since I started taking it.
