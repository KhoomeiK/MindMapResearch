Is it a man with a bow ... pointing at you?

A man ..... with a bow pointing at you?

Is this a ribbon bow or a weapon bow? 

There are so many possibilities to imagine, some wildly more enjoyable than others. Personally, I’ve chosen to understand it as a man with a ribbon bow, pointing at your chest as if to suggest you also need one there. Life is a gift, after all!"

What’s the point in bitching about how expensive and mediocre the food is in the city where I choose to live? I live here, so I choose to be happy and find delicious options. Some food is overhyped and over priced, but that’s certainly not a blanket statement I’d make about any city’s entire offerings. I’ve had burritos in the Mission, and they’re great. There are also great burritos here in White Center, and my favorite is actually a food truck in Maple Valley. Torchy’s is good, but I thought they overfill the tacos which made them tough to eat, and some of their sauces felt a bit off in the balance of flavors. Queso was out of this world, though, and it was a fun experience I’ll happily repeat next time I’m near one.

Regarding Dick’s - I didn’t make a single bag of Dick’s joke, so I’m proof that it’s possible to talk about it without making puns. Which you’ve said is impossible. But here I am! And I did say that it’s a fast food burger .. and you’ve agreed it’s a step above McD’s, so I think it remains a valid choice for 1. a cheap meal 2. that’s a true Seattle choice. It’s like going to Buffalo and getting Anchor Bar wings. Is it the best wing in town? No. Is it a Buffalo institution with a decent wing and it’s nice to say you’ve tried one? Yes. To me, that’s where Dick’s fits - decent fast food and a beloved local option so it’s nice to say you’ve been. I’d pick a $3.65 dicks deluxe over a $3.19 double cheeseburger any day .... if nothing else, Dick’s treats their employees INCREDIBLY well (salaries start at $17/hour! Plus scholarships, health insurance, and childcare help. And they get paid hours to volunteer each month.) Additionally, they’re really benevolent - nonprofits I work with have received their donations - and they support their community. So if I’m in the mood for a fast food burger? HELL YA I’m going to Dick’s instead of McD’s. Why wouldn’t I???? Their food is similar but slightly better, they treat their employees like humans, and they love the Seattle community they’re in. 


Your first comment said my entire list was a lie, and when I asked why / what you like instead, you still haven’t explained yourself (and objectively, you’re wrong.

“We had rain so unusual it broke a record” isn’t making your point as much as it makes mine. Rain that hard is unusual. And it’s not a point of pride that I don’t own an umbrella here — it doesn’t usually rain hard enough to make that the right tool to keep me dry. The drops are small and light, so it rains sideways as often as it rains down. A raincoat with a hood keeps me plenty dry, where I still get wet with an umbrella. And when I’m on a bus and walking through crowded downtown, it’s an asshole move to carry an umbrella since you’re poking and soaking everyone around you. There’s just not enough space to make them a reasonable option on a normal day.

You’ve got a phone, and I rely heavily on the Google Translate app. If you download the language you can translate when you’re offline, and it’s got a “live translate” feature where you hold the camera up and it translates what’s in front of you. It saved me on so many menus and signs! Also, when I’m stumped about how to be understood .... I pull out my phone and just show them the translation or the photo of what I want. That works 100% of the time! 

My best advice when traveling anywhere - try to enunciate so you’re easier for non-native speakers to understand, and try to avoid complicated speech. Don’t use American slang if you can help it, say things directly (“Hi, where is X?” more than “Hi, can you tell me where I might be able to find X?”) if you’re not sure their level of English, and it’s amazing how much I’m able to communicate with gestures and smiles instead of words. A smile and hand over my heart to someone who’s helped me, pointing left and right when confirming which direction I should walk, etc. When I’m a tourist abroad I say probably 30% as many words as I do when I’m a tourist in the US. I’m often told I’m very easy to understand, and it’s mostly those three things - I enunciate, use fewer words and simpler sentences, and use gestures to support or replace what I’m saying.

- Dick’s Drive In has a few locations - you’ll probably be closest to the one on Broadway in Cap Hill, or in Lower Queen Anne. It’s a relatively ordinary fast food burger (more In N Out than McD’s) but a beloved local chain. Do the Dick’s Deluxe, and I’d encourage you to try the fries and shakes too! It’ll be $4-10/person depending on if you share the fries and shakes. 
- I haven’t been there in a few years to confirm price and quality are still amazing, but Rancho Bravo (in Cap Hill, on Pine just east of Broadway. I can’t remember the exact street, but it’s a few doors down from Molly Moon’s ice cream) makes street tacos that are cheap and REALLY good. Also excellent drunk food if you’re partying on the hill. 
- If you’re near the stadiums on game day, or out at night you M U S T try a Seattle-style hot dog from a cart. Everyone offers it, so any cart will do. I almost hate telling you what’s on it because it sounds gross, but I swear it’s not. They add cream cheese on the toasted bun - it’s not enough to really taste, just enough that it adds a creamy mouth feel. It’s a kielbasa and grilled onions and cream cheese, and I’ve never met someone who didn’t like it!
- Ivar’s is a local fish&chips chain that’s really high quality and delicious
- Kidd Valley is another local fast foodish burger chain. Big burgers that are real yummy, but they’re known for their crazy milkshake flavors
- Pho (the Vietnamese noodle soup) is really filling because it’s bone broth, and one of the cheapest meal options! Loads of places, my personal favorite is Than Bro’s, and they have a few locations in town
- It’s a half-day adventure but I recommend you walk on to the Bainbridge ferry, and follow everyone by turning left and walking toward their downtown. There’s an ice cream shop about a mile away, Mora’s, that has really unique flavors and is well known and loved. Ferry + ice cream will be under $30 for the both of you, and you get a beautiful ferry ride (and uncommon views of Seattle!) out of it! 
- Bernard’s is my favorite dive bar in the entire world. It’s downtown, on Seneca between 2nd and 3rd (or 3 and 4? I can’t remember now!). It hasn’t been renovated in a few decades and it shows. But their drinks are dirt ass cheap, there’s some sort of free food offered every day (I’ve never had the guts to try, but I see others who do!), and it’s a great happy hour spot. They’re not open on weekends though. I think the kitchen closes at 4pm but I’m told they have a super cheap burger on the food menu!
- Oliver’s is a really nice bar downtown, maybe Olive and .... 5th? The drinks are $$ but they have free food every day and it’s delicious and really high quality. Worth a $10 martini to load up on the free snacks!
- Pike Place has LOADS of food vendors. I drink more than eat there so I can’t recommend a specific one. But a number of them are decently priced, so worth exploring! 
- If you’re there in nice weather, my favorite happy hour is actually the Hard Rock Cafe. They have a rooftop with an amazing view, it’s mostly locals doing work happy hour, and the drinks were surprisingly reasonable! (I want to say my strong double whiskey/ginger was $9?) 
- In the Pacific Place mall downtown, Din Tai Fung is amaaaaazing but can add up if you go for a full dinner. Regularly makes lists of top restaurants in the city.
- Our local International District is pretty huge, and absolutely filled with incredible restaurants. I’m allergic to wheat and soy so don’t eat at them, but the food is so cheap! Do some exploring or googling to find the best spots, but really worth a visit. 
- Pike Place Chowder in the market is some of the best chowder I’ve ever eaten. The lines are long af, and worth it. They have a location in Pacific Place now, and their happy hour menu is insanely good.
- Biscuit Bitch is universally loved, and most things are <$10.
- it’s a short bus ride away, but on Cherry Hill (give or take, around 23rd and Madison) there are a handful of Ethiopian restaurants, and I’ve enjoyed them all! It’s always an affordable option.

As a Paris resident, maybe you can answer that for me! If you’re walking toward someone and there’s not enough room for both of you, how do you properly avoid running in to each other?"

AskReddit,fd3f32m,t1_fd3aye9,1578157675.0,"The best advice I can give someone new is to keep trying. Invite people out a few times and they’ll eventually say yes. At Amazon I accidentally made a new friend (and there’s my native Seattleite for ya) my first day because we met at orientation, and at like 5:30 she pinged me saying “I need a margarita. You done with work yet?” ...... it’s amazon, of course I need a drink. Offering a strategically timed tequila bypassed the usual need to slowly worm her way into my life, and we’ve been great friends ever since! All about that bias for action ;)"
AskReddit,fd3dy3o,t1_fd2djbx,1578157373.0,"1. Seattle is BEAUTIFUL. Because of the nature, though - every direction you look there are mountains and a body of water. When the weather sucks, you can’t see most of the beauty, so you need a good memory to get you through!
2. If you’re prone to depression, invest in a happy lamp. They start at like $20 on Amazon and they work wonders. It’s like thirty minutes a day with this light bulb on, and it seems to really help moods. 
3. The Seattle freeze does still kind of exist. I was deeply offended when someone told me they’ve figured out they have to invite a native out three times before they say yes ..... and then I realized it’s true. I think I’m friendly af, but it does often take a couple invites before I feel guilty saying no. We hang out and I realize you’re fun, and then it’s fine! But you do seem to have to wear us down before we’ll be your friend. So keep trying, don’t lose hope!
4. Learn to like coffee, even just a bit. Meeting for coffee is really common here, and you’ll spend a lot of time defending your hot cocoa and apologizing for not liking coffee. You don’t need to love the stuff, but life is easier if you can find a drink that’s tolerable when the situation demands. 
5. I’m guessing you’re looking at the UW (the you-dub, not the you-double-you) for school. Unless you know you’ll travel a lot, see if you can get by without a car. Traffic succccccccks and rush hour goes from about 6:30am-8pm. Parking is expensive, the city is built on hills that are tough if you’re not used to using two feet on the pedals, and there are loads of one-way streets that add to your stress. The buses to/from/around the UW are great, and it’s easy to get a Car2Go or daily rental if you want to explore further out!
6. Food-wise you’ll be happiest if you like seafood and Asian food. We have an excellent food culture, and it largely revolves around those two things. Tons of Thai and Vietnamese, sushi, and Korean places. And Seattle’s abundance of freshly caught salmon has ruined me for eating it anywhere else. So good. 
7. Don’t buy an umbrella. It just drizzles here for the most part, a hooded raincoat is all you need. 
8. The key to success weather-wise is to spend as much time outdoors as you can when it’s sunny. When it’s rained for two weeks and you get a sunny day, everyone celebrates by enjoying the sun for all you can!
9. If you’re prone to depression or are affected by weather, really think about whether this is a good climate for you. The rain is annoying but it’s fine. What’s hard is months on end of gray sky. Not many sunny days for about 9 months of the year, and it really wears on people. Lots of February vacations to Palm Springs or Hawaii just for a new sky color. I find the gray cozy and excellent blanket-and-a-book weather, but I’m in the minority for loving it. Happy lamps, vitamin D pills, and #8 are how most people get through!
10. In the summer I swear there is no where more gorgeous than Seattle. It makes up for those 9 months, and it’s why we all stay here!
11. You’ll love it here most if you’re an outdoors person. Lots of water sports (the PG kind) and endless hiking options within the city or a short drive, but within about 3 hours you can be in: mountains, desert, city, country, ocean, or the rain forest.
12. Seattle is a highly educated city. We have one of the highest % of people with graduate degrees of any US city. It manifests in loads of ways, but one of my favorites is that I often have really interesting chats with strangers who are thoughtful and incredibly smart. 
13. Dating here is shiiiiiiiiiiiiit as a woman. Tons of men, but it’s a tech town. The odds are good, but the goods are odd. Men don’t tend to be real forward here, so it’s not uncommon to have a few dates and still not be totally sure if they were dates or friendly hangouts. Absolutely maddening. I’m sure the men don’t love dating here either, but I couldn’t articulate for you what their frustrations are. 


Obviously, I live here and adore it. I’m happy to chat with you (or anyone!) if you have specific questions or want to learn more about the city!"
AskReddit,fd38xbu,t1_fd32wa0,1578155824.0,"Seattle native and current resident here - I actually think the freeze is much better than it used to be, but now I mostly see it now in the new transplants! I’ve been at amazon for the last 4 years and have paid attention to how my new coworkers adjust. My theory is new folks know it exists and want to act local, so lean in. After a while they realize they don’t have friends, so stop doing it and act normally. 

That said, I’ve also spent a fair amount of time in Scandinavia, and finally get it. Seattle has Nordic roots, and I think that reserved nature is what’s become the Seattle freeze. Lovely and warm people, but you’ve got to break through the shell to see it. The key to success with natives? Tenacity! You have to wear us down and then we’ll be your friend."
AskReddit,fd375bs,t1_fd2qbyc,1578155331.0,"YES! The first time I visited Paris I swore I’d never go back, and 50% of it was because communicating was awful. I’ve been to rural villages in random European countries and had very little difficulty communicating, but LORD ALMIGHTY every day in Paris was a struggle. If I spoke English it was a crapshoot if they did (they = someone in a service role, like waiter or ticket seller), and the times I tried to use French words they seemed gravely insulted by my (poor) attempts at their beautiful language. It’s not my fault this word has 11 letters and you only pronounce three! It felt like a no-win situation .. we couldn’t communicate in English, and they didn’t seem to like my attempts at French. 

Weirdly, the other thing I couldn’t handle was how people pass each other on sidewalks. It took me almost a week to figure out why I (a generally gentle and happy woman) was thisclose to a fist fight at all times. Sidewalks are narrow, and typical if you and I are walking toward each other well both turn our shoulders slightly and take a quarter step out so we miss each other. In Paris they didn’t. They’d walk straight into me, so I felt really fight/flight because I was playing chicken a hundred times a day as people barreled straight toward me. I got so sick of them moving 0 and me having to smash flat against a wall or walk into the street that I gave up and let the collisions happen. They’d look shocked, and I still don’t know what etiquette is! Why was I the only one ever moving?! 

Anyway, I’ve been back since. Still don’t love Paris, but the rest of France was absolutely lovely! Highly recommend it!"

And we think they’re charming accents, so any mistakes seem cute!

I agree with you that France seems to be two distinct places: Paris, and everywhere else. The things I really struggled with about Paris weren’t issues elsewhere, and not surprisingly the people were really different outside the city as well. Paris isn’t my favorite, but I will gladly keep returning to other parts of France to do more exploring of your beautiful country and its rich history and delicious food!"

It appears that anyone with disabilities that disqualify you from military service (and the list is long) will probably still register for the draft and let the medical exam disqualify them, should they be asked to take one. Where I’m a bit squishy if if that then requires them / automatically registers them for Selective Service, or if they’re just lucky and released from the obligation. I see a lot of information about Selective Service, but the SSS website won’t load for me to confirm.

Selective Service is what Conscientious Objectors register for - depending on why you’ve done it it either puts you into the military but in a non-weapon and non-combat role, or it matches you to an employer that benefits the country somehow and you then do that work for the length of what your military commitment would have been."

WhitePeopleTwitter,fcyaek8,t1_fcxuusi,1578077097.0,"You’re partly correct. 

Conscientious objectors need to petition for the exemption, and IF it’s granted then they has two choices:
1. Serve in the military in a non-combat role that doesn’t handle weapons
2. Non-military service program, where they’re matched with an employer that has a meaningful contribution to the nation.

AskReddit,fcthzaa,t1_fcsgtdm,1577943912.0,"We met during college years but were at different universities in different states, and stayed friends for a long time after. We’d text occasionally (texting wasn’t free back then because I’m a dinosaur) and every couple months have a phone call to catch up on life. I flew out to visit him once or twice, we spent a week together for a mutual friend’s wedding, and I think he visited me once as well? We hooked up once like 8 years later, and it was bonkers good so we kept hooking up and then it turned into a whole thing. It was an amazing relationship, he was an incredible guy and we agreed on all the important things and he was my best friend in the world. 

And one day it all came unraveled. He hadn’t broken up with her 3 years ago like he’d said, they’d just hit a rough patch so he preemptively told me it was over. But they worked it out, and he just never bothered to update me. He had carefully used “I” instead of “we” when telling stories the past three years, left out details about who he was on trips with (usually he just said it was a work trip and he’d taken a couple days to explore after), and tl;dr his entire life was a lie. But since he lived in another state and we’d been friends for ages I had no reason to suspect it. He dated a girl in college who was a real wacko (I met her and think this, that’s not coming from him). But since college he’d consistently told me they had no contact when I’d ask about her once in a while. Turns out they talked regularly and always had! That one I found out when a random email address texted a picture of herself and asked him to FaceTime. Idgaf if they talked, he had no reason to lie for all those years. And yet, here we are. 

The longer I’ve spent in therapy about it, and the more random memories of my decade knowing him that have resurfaced, the more I realize he’d been carefully crafting the “him” that I knew the entire time. He had a self-narrative about who he was, and he fought aggressively to maintain it. Things were great until I found out the truth, and then the abuse started. He couldn’t stand anything that contradicted this grand image of him, so when I’d (rightfully) accuse him of lying (because he was) he’d flip out and it got really dark. 

I started therapy last year to deal with ptsd from an unrelated traumatic experience, and the new therapist kept zeroing in on my ex. It had ended a few years prior so I kept pushing it off, but once I finally gave her the broad strokes of his bullshit and abuse, she said he’s likely a narcissist with sociopathic tendencies. For the next two months every encounter we’d had for a decade got drug up (never on my schedule - usually at inconvenient times it would just float up to my brain. Once I was standing in my pantry deciding on dinner, and a random old fight hit me like a ton of bricks. I started sobbing and laid on the ground crying for an hour.) and re-examined with this new lens, and a lot of shit started to make sense. I’d put most of it to bed years ago, but some encounters had always bugged me because I didn’t understand where tf it went off the rails .... but now it was incredibly clear. I had thought he was just your run-of-the-mill abusive schmuck who lied and didn’t like being caught, but realizing just how deep the lies went and how long he’d been doing it, I was finally able to let go of my last remaining guilt over not having known. He was out there playing 4D chess and he had been for a decade; no one could have seen it coming."
