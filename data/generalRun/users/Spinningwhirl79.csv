CompetitiveForHonor,ffajnx7,t1_ffaetjd,1579737397.0,">You need to react in 233ms in order to block a non-buffered 500ms light

It is common knowledge that blocking lights isn't the optimal way to defend against them, so in this scenario those numbers don't matter. Which also means the 40ms shouldn't matter to a player who knows what they're doing.

>This, on the other hand, is completely irrelevant. It makes just as much of a difference, whether you can perceive it in a vacuum or not.

This is only relevant in the context that you provided, which I believe to be the wrong example to use, since people shouldn't be blocking lights either way.

>It's more like 250ms actually

>You need to react in 233ms in order to block a non-buffered 500ms light

So, you're saying that the majority of people are simply unable to block a non-buffered 500ms light."
CompetitiveForHonor,ffaj0zz,t1_ffag9ok,1579736922.0,"Fps is the same as graphics, it's a preference for all cases except the extreme scenarios. Also, last I heard for honor has an fps cap of somewhere around 60 so that's irrelevant.

Input delay is negligible until, again, the extreme scenarios (wireless controller, bad wifi, old tv screen, etc) and even then it's still playable.

Maybe with world class players it might make some slight difference, but really if you're optimising your setup properly, the problem should be in other peoples' connection which isn't something tied to the platform at all."
