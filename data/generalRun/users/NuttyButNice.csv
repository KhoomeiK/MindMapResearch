I don’t think FaceTiming will do anything for her as you said she’s deaf and blind, but it could help you."

beermoney,fey4bfs,t1_feso2yu,1579440702.0,My link is working today.

I found it on one of the collect your credit emails. Not sure if it’s different for each country though."
beermoney,fesim7t,t1_fes3uvj,1579365596.0,"Yup that’s exactly what I did :( I also emailed the address directly as there’s another page that says you can do that if you don’t want to do the form way. Both come back unable to deliver. 
It tells me on the webpage the request was sent, but then about 15 mins later I get an email saying it couldn’t deliver.

Have you had that?"
beermoney,fes1hx6,t1_feryb9w,1579360476.0,"How do I do that? I only have a vpn option, not an actual app (ios if that helps), and any help link I click takes me to the same email or the same form which then goes to the same email."
beermoney,ferlamp,t1_ferjlyw,1579355381.0,Cheers. Maybe it's time to give up the app =/ Shame. I hope you have better luck.

Otherwise I'm stumped I'm afraid :/ 

Only other thing I can think is delete them and re-add them if you haven't already - the alarms not the apps."
PokemonSwordAndShield,fdkb6ni,t3_eltow1,1578500172.0,I feel this.
AmazfitBip,fdkailz,t1_fdk9y05,1578499757.0,"Hmmm, I can't understand it then. 

I'll have a look through the app and see if there's anything I'm missing that might be the cause."
PokemonSwordAndShield,fdk9qxv,t3_eliic5,1578499271.0,YES. I am so sick of them now.
AmazfitBip,fdk9cch,t1_fdk7v4c,1578499018.0,"There should be an option under snooze mode when you tap the alarm that says period, and then you choose the days you want it repeated."
AmazfitBip,fdk7fvi,t1_fdk6oqa,1578497802.0,How strange. I assume you've double checked they're all set to repeat when needed?
AmazfitBip,fdk443i,t3_ehcu9n,1578495584.0,Is it the only app you use? Or do you use notify and fitness too? As they conflict with alarms.
pokemon,fd22g0a,t1_fd1nt9s,1578140644.0,It will mess you up big time. Just look at that stare.
