depression,ffbkbtb,t3_esq7a2,1579769404.0,"I tend to binge eat too, especially when I feel really down. Honestly what helps me the most is not having any junk food at home. If it isnt there you can't eat it lol. And it's very unlikely thay I'd get in my car just to go buy some unhealthy food. 

Also give intermittent fasting a try if you can. It regulates hormones including the hormone leptin which helps keep hunger under control.  Good luck :)))"
