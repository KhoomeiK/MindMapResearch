There are isolated communities where unemployment is high because there are too few local jobs—and fewer still that are skilled and command high wages. Transport links to areas where this is more work are utterly dire. For example, where I’m from there was one bus a day some days, and the train line hadn’t operated since the close of the coal mines.
