Here's my suggestion.  Enjoy the hair you have while you have it.  If you start getting obvious bald spots, there are half wigs that blend into your real hair and attach with clips.  Higher quality synthetics are very realistic.

When it gets to the point where the half wig isn't enough or you want to explore full wigs, go to a wig store and have your head measured.  It will help a lot in getting the right fit.

There is a wonderful small business online called Cysterwigs.  Heather is the owner and does online reviews of all her wigs, only sells quality wigs, won't sell something she finds subpar, and has hundreds of videos on Youtube.
