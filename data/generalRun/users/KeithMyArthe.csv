The first house I moved into in Brisbane was in Fairfield, and was always damp and full of cockies.  

I found out from the neighbour that the whole house had gone under in '74, and post flood it was jacked up and turned into a two storey house, but the walls were still the original lath plaster, and had never been cleaned out or replaced.  
All that muck from the floodwaters was still in the walls.  

The lower floor went under again in 2011, and the current owners have domestic blitzed it and made it noice. I guess they are banking on no more floods."
