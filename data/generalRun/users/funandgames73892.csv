Personally, don't give it rewards whatsoever.  While Tencent (China) may have only five percent and can't really influence Reddit operations, if Reddit gets revenue so does the country (government not people or culture) that suppresses Hong Kong and suppress information about a virus that can imacpt the whole 7+ billion strong human race for their selfish means that will inevitably end to our destruction (we will likely survive but they are playing with fire).

Pass a law allowing denial of services ONLY if the responders have a certification in it.  You may think that employers wouldn't want to pay for it and EMTs don't make enough to worry about it, but I think the employers would love to only give rides to those who mostly intend to give their billing information as opposed to being a taxi service.

Urban police will experience the relax and ease of rural or suburban while police from their will gain experience in a more hostile environment preparing them to help guide their home force of that happens in a normally quiet area.

Another push would be to try and get a substantial amount of police, maybe 50% or so, to come from the local community so they have an investment in both protecting their community as well as their fellow citizens they grew up with instead of answering a job posting from another city and not having any sort of attachment.

Something the community leaders could also do is encourage the police to come out to community events, unarmed, to get to know people.  Being unarmed and unassailed at the end could leave an impression on the cop of ease while also impressing upon the community that this is not someone to be feared, but another human that shares in this community.  

Will these fix the issues?  I don't know, I'm just trying to think of things that may help relations because at the end of the day a police state is not a solution nor is the lack of a police force as criminals are still there.  We need police forces that are made up of the community they serve, not made up of transplants answering job postings."
