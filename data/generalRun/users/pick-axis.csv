Xiaomi,ffi1sjk,t1_ffi12bx,1579962535.0,The fake base station setting was one. I found a setting for system root but i think it was for china rom because i couldn't get it to work nor was i able to read the options for it. I remember finding some weird coin game thing on the last miui version but again there was a language barrier. Just be careful it could force a system reset if you dont know what your selecting.

Xiaomi,ffhxskk,t3_etqlg2,1579958537.0,There are some things in MIUI that i cant access either but i always like to use an app called quickshortcut maker after a system update to look at all the other features i still cant access. Once or twice though I've found some cool sounding shit that let me turn it on. For example i cant access wifi calling features through the normal settings app but with quickshortcut maker i can access a setting to stop my phone from connecting to fake base stations?? Its my opinion that only certain regions get certain features on MIUI and having access to wifi direct is prob not in your region.
