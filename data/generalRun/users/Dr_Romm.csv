LessCredibleDefence,fd9yqem,t1_fd9xanu,1578239706.0,"> If we're providing them with satellite and elint information that they would not otherwise have, would we not be crossing those same bounds?  And training them how to attack specifically Russian equipment, formations, etc might not be very different

Going purely off historical precedent I’d say no. 

> Have we shown proven evidence of Quds actively directing attacks, or just supporting them?  Honest question.

They’ve got a long history of directing attacks against American interests in Iraq, but specific evidence hasn’t been brought out yet. If it comes out that they didn’t direct this attack on the embassy then I’ll certainly change my stance, but right now the circumstances surrounding the attack points to this being Qud-directed"
LessCredibleDefence,fd9wct8,t1_fd9v4d2,1578238788.0,">So even if the embassy was attacked solely by Iraqis, the Iranians are a legitimate target?  Not saying I disagree. Just curious as to what people consider ""an act of war"".

I think targeting Iranian agents operating in Iraq that directed that attack is a legit response, but attacking an unrelated military facility within Iran (just for example) would absolutely not be a legit response. 

>So if we have trainers in Ukraine, but they don't actively take part in the fighting, we should not be surprised when Russia, or their proxies, kill them?

If those trainers were involved in planning attacks on Russian facilities and military personnel then, from a Russian perspective, they would constitute legitimate military targets. 

The key distinction is the command and control element, which US trainers in Ukraine lack, but Quds operating in Iraq did not."

LessCredibleDefence,fd9pwny,t1_fd9k63j,1578236557.0,"From an Iranian perspective, sure, that’s how international conflict works. Thankfully for us here in the US they lack the capability (or perhaps just the will to suffer the consequences) to pull off that kind of strike. This is how it works when you’ve got the greatest ability to project military force on the planet. I fully disagree with the method by which this foreign agent was assassinated and believe it should have been done covertly, but I 100% support the US being able to assassinate foreign agents that have a habit of leaving dead Americans in their wake, especially when that agent is assassinated in a country we have a defense agreement with, while said agent is working against the goals of said defense agreement."
LessCredibleDefence,fd9j1st,t1_fd9hvzb,1578234104.0,"Militias of course, but it would be more accurate to say “militias funded, trained, and under direct control of Iranian military officers” as that’s what’s actually been happening in Iraq, and that’s a much different scenario than say, an Iranian-funded group coming up with the idea and carrying it out without Iranian direction (which isn’t what happened). If a Ukrainian Militia attacked a Russian facility in Crimea and it was found that an American General responsible was located in the region and had made a career out of directing irregular forces you can be certain that the Russians would do something similar (but they’d be smart enough to blame it on the locals, like the did with the Malaysian airlines flight they shot down)"
