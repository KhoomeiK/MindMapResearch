TsumTsum,ffuw8d4,t1_fftrd2a,1580250517.0,SAME. This confirms to me that it’s NOT random
TsumTsum,ffjyajc,t3_etzwig,1580010288.0,"288, I’m missing K2SO. I was in college during the event, studying for exams like a mad lady and barely finished the event let alone played for other people. I’m not holding my breath in him returning"
NCIS,ffdy8ki,t1_ffc912n,1579831902.0,For real. And a SLIGHT spoiler but 2x07 is my favorite episode of NCIS ever. And I think a LOT of people would agree.
CatsAndDogsBFF,ff4a2wm,t3_erfw4h,1579558837.0,Cute! Though it did start off as r/stolendogbeds
DisneyWorld,ff453tc,t3_erdfdb,1579555735.0,Amazing photo! I have so many pictures of spaceship earth at night from various trips and I love them all! It just doesn’t get old.
asexuality,ff397mi,t1_ff35si1,1579536659.0,Liking the idea of sex and enjoying sexual content without wanting to experience sex yourself. The absence (a) is the self (ego) in sexuality.
aww,ff1rrog,t3_er55tj,1579484732.0,Those eyes! Archer looks like an adorable stuff animal come to life
thisisus,feu681h,t1_fetk5f4,1579383487.0,"I know it’s generally well loved but its just not one of my favorites. I’m not even sure I watched it more than once when it came out. Though I’ll admit I wasn’t super attached to William, I just didn’t love the premise."
rarepuppers,felw51y,t3_eppgre,1579232426.0,I just joined r/bermesemountaindogs but was really hoping it would be called r/Bunsenberners like we have r/wigglebutts
aww,felk9qc,t3_eps1rv,1579224199.0,Oh my god a BABY Aussie! r/wigglebutts would LOVE this
NoStupidQuestions,fekvosg,t3_epoakj,1579208563.0,"I regularly ate meals alone in the dining hall when I was in college (less than five years ago). I was fine with it because I had anxiety about eating in front of other people. I liked to use the time as contemplation (to drown out the noise of all the people around me). So even if I wasn’t using my phone, I often held it like I was. Don’t ask why, I’m not really sure. Just anxiety I guess. 

A few times during busy meal periods while I was eating someone would ask they could sit at my table and I’d say “yes” and by the time they came back with their food I’d be gone."
AskReddit,fejrpf5,t1_fejf6o9,1579184182.0,"A few years ago whenever my parents started asking factual but mildly rhetorical questions into the air during their conversations (about older singers, actors, recipes, etc) I would google and answer it. They were astounded how I found the information so quickly. 

They still do it now. And I’m always ready to google exactly what their postulating. Usually my dad goes “hey I can just google that, can’t I?” And I’m like, “yep, you can!” Though he usually quips back “but what would I do without my research team?” (Aka- me)"
thisisus,fegwnep,t1_fefyr3o,1579104188.0,That made me laugh as well. It’s funny how on some network shows the same actor/actress plays the same character on 3 shows or 3 different characters on 3 different shows.
thisisus,fegw8k8,t1_fefj5iw,1579103928.0,Yes! Number One is in my top 5 favorite episodes of TIU (probably #2 after Super Bowl Sunday)
aaaaaaacccccccce,fegl36h,t1_fefyxto,1579096112.0,Aegosexual ftw! Enjoying the idea of sex but having zero desire to experience it irl and fine with taking care of it by ones self.
StrangePlanet,feamem6,t3_eoa0g0,1578950268.0,This may be the most relatable strange planet comic ever. I’ve lost so many socks in my life. I always say they went to the “isle of lost things”.
WaltDisneyWorld,fe9om71,t1_fe9e0i6,1578940038.0,"I have a family member who is a CM and a super big rule follower. They will always be the first to enforce a rule, and even more if it’s brought to their attention by another guest. As a reminder there are 4 keys to being a cast member: Safety, Courtesy, Show, Efficiency. In that order. This is reinforced when you go to GR and put in a cast compliment for a CM and you tell which one of those keys they were upholding."
insanepeoplefacebook,fe7wzmh,t3_enywoz,1578920056.0,I 100% believe this person meant this. I tried to explain to my dad (a late baby boomer) what the phrase meant. He thought it was a positive thing and said “well we were the last great generation” and I had to hold my tongue to not say “okay boomer”
TsumTsum,fdqoj6g,t1_fdqncvs,1578671471.0,My observation with when they tell you you’re using the wrong Tsum tsum is only with the events that are marketed as “easy” like the coloring missions.
disneyemojiblitz,fdoopqt,t3_emh0oc,1578609493.0,Congrats! I’m 75% of the way there but it still feels so far away! Did all your final collection prizes come right at the end? Or did you max out one collection earlier than others? I haven’t maxed any of the groups out. Though I’m 3 rafikis away from the lion king collection
TsumTsum,fdoacxh,t1_fdo5h2b,1578601627.0,I only learned that when I watched Moo’s vid of Hamm. Otherwise I wouldn’t have figured it out either
motorcitykitties,fdntwey,t1_fdnexon,1578592745.0,"This makes me way, way, WAY too happy. Beating the Yankees is still beautiful"
