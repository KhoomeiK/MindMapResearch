shrimptank,ffgarh0,t1_fatbusa,1579902136.0,So I got a TDS meter the other day and my tap water is only at 24 ppm. That feels pretty close to me. Is that okay to use?

facepalm,fdefk58,t1_fde9wvg,1578337934.0,"People usually cancel their utilities and what not before they move out, or they give them a shutoff date and a forwarding address where their next/final bill would be sent."

shrimptank,fd0k49i,t1_fauoz9x,1578119962.0,Shoot. I thought it was an actual filter and would reduce the TDS
shrimptank,fd0ieni,t1_fd0f8cf,1578119247.0,Ok thank you. That makes sense.
shrimptank,fd0icu3,t1_fd08p6u,1578119226.0,"Ah shoot.  I saw somewhere else That I can just put some cooked cucumber in there and after a while toss it and all the snails covering it.  Or an assassin snail could be cool, but then I’m also worried that it would reproduce or carry in more pests."
shrimptank,fd02z5o,t1_fd00wee,1578112869.0,"I will check those out. Thank you for your help McCraft2, I really appreciate it."
shrimptank,fczyc84,t1_fczuyni,1578110736.0,"Well mostly what I’m thinking about is that in my ten gallon tank, these extra 50-100 animals are going to mess up the parameters of the water. I really am concerned about my shrimp and not too worried about the fate of the snails. So while the snails may not directly harm the shrimp I’m worried their existence alone will harm my shrimply babies. 
What is LFS? Tried looking it up and got a lot of different answers from google."
shrimptank,fczwuls,t1_fczrvhc,1578109986.0,Ah pretty isn’t too important. I’m just worried that this many snails will mess up the water and that’s what will hurt the snails.  Just gotta figure out what to do with the assassin snails afterwards :/
shrimptank,fczwlpi,t1_fczpj59,1578109862.0,"This tank hasn’t had snails in it for years. Until I got one friendly Blue Mystery Snail. I call them the mystery machine. So yeah, unless snail eggs can last that long? I don’t think they can though"
ZeroWaste,fbz90j6,t3_ef7xt9,1577238875.0,Oh I like this. Thanks
