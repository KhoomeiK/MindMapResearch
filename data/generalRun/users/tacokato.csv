actuallesbians,fe0unip,t3_enkxzf,1578818848.0,That’s her own insecurity. I tell straight friends I love them and they know it’s purely for support.
actuallesbians,fe0hety,t3_enii5n,1578813477.0,"Absolute same. Really going through it, I feel your pain."
offmychest,fdmkx4s,t3_em58kf,1578553777.0,You have such a strong drive to succeed and the capacity to heal. I am in awe. Congratulations on everything. I hope you achieve everything you want and more in life.
progresspics,fdmk9ba,t3_elvios,1578553030.0,"Amazing progress, congratulations!"
gifs,fdmhi7v,t1_fdmgsmi,1578550089.0,As a gay woman... yeah.
actuallesbians,fdm6gte,t3_eluf7i,1578540964.0,"I’m sorry both of you are going through this, each position is so difficult. 


First, it is not your fault on who you are or are not attracted to. Each person has different values, and if your value and identity really revolve around being a lesbian and only being identifies as a lesbian there is nothing wrong with that. 


Secondly, please be kind to your partner. He’s going through a really tough transition. His feelings on gender, sexuality, and identity are going to be WILD right now. Be careful because he might choose to remain feminine only for you. And that’s a terrible burden for you to bear, and not at all your responsibility. 


There truly is no easy answer or solution, but know that your feelings and hurt are completely valid. I would be more than happy to talk with you and just be an ear to listen. DM anytime!"
maybemaybemaybe,fdjmogs,t3_elhnyd,1578478302.0,What was he gonna do if she didn’t interfere?!
offmychest,fdjjjif,t3_elldgh,1578473770.0,"There was a thought provoking post about a man who gives LGBTQ+ extra space and time. It talked about how marginalized groups kind of have two identities. Their vulnerable self, and the defense self they put up as a protection. Eventually when the person ages, they have to pick which aspects of each to keep as their identity. While the older gays may have it figured out I think it’s kind to let the younger gays do so too."
actuallesbians,fdjixy0,t3_elnau5,1578472945.0,Freshly single. This made my whole heart hurt.
insaneparents,fdhq4t3,t1_fdfvwk2,1578427956.0,Make it black to match her cold cold heart.
insaneparents,fdhpz8q,t1_fdhou2u,1578427864.0,I have ADD and if I was gonna be a junkie it certainly wouldn’t be with the med that makes me feel like a muted human being. Like... at least choose a fun drug!
insaneparents,fdhog25,t3_elfuuq,1578426950.0,Your mom kind of sounds like she’s trying to steal some of your meds.
insaneparents,fdho96c,t1_fdewsq6,1578426837.0,Hydro homie!!
insaneparents,fdho8jm,t3_el13ev,1578426826.0,Queer person here. It’s terrifying to post feelings about being gay on reddit sometimes. A lot of people just tell you that you’re trash.
actuallesbians,fdg90zw,t3_el4h77,1578385202.0,"I’m at day one and I feel so raw I could explode. I keep telling myself don’t run back, but my entire being hurts."
aww,fdd0i0u,t3_eknl87,1578289985.0,Have my point thing.
funny,fdd0bps,t3_ekk0er,1578289814.0,I’m amused that you also posted this in r/wellthatsucks but using an entirely different picture. Quality crossposting right there.
me_irlgbt,fdbculx,t3_e3q85s,1578256122.0,Yes I am attracted to kitchenware.
progresspics,fcyul27,t3_ejffck,1578087408.0,Not the progress I expected but certainly the progress I need!
Wellthatsucks,fcwijgh,t3_ej3moy,1578026554.0,This more than sucks!
AmItheAsshole,fchwn0y,t3_eh6n83,1577655008.0,"Absolutely NTA. 

This woman is my age, a full grown-ass adult, and yet she is acting more immature than someone your age. Your loss is your own and you cannot just “get over it”. I’ve known people who never get over loss, and I still think about my own over 10 years ago. There’s nothing wrong with that. 

To be honest it seems like her insecurity in filling the role of mother and partner is blindsiding her to how childish she is. She most likely always compares herself to your mother and has no idea how to deal with that outside of filling her role. Her feelings are valid but the way she is treating you is not. I hope she comes to her senses and gives you time and space."
mildlyinfuriating,fch0rrc,t3_eh1af0,1577646095.0,This seems a bit more than mildly infuriating.
gaming,fcbdmeq,t1_fcb5919,1577585573.0,"Depends on the desired outcome but yes, point taken."
pics,fcacc55,t1_fca2g21,1577566656.0,I want to go on one of your scavenger hunts! How awesome.
gaming,fcac1kj,t3_egu6aa,1577566488.0,"If it’s stupid and it works, it’s really not stupid."
progresspics,fca8stz,t3_egse4h,1577564830.0,"It’s amazing how much confidence you give off now, wow. Great progress!"
offmychest,fc5xa1m,t3_egc661,1577467829.0,"You’re doing so so so well! If it helps I’d like to give you a piece of advice someone gave me when my life was spiraling and stagnating. It’s okay to take steps backwards. It’s okay to take a break and not think about anything for awhile. But if you are taking more steps forward than you ever are backwards, your life will be better and you will be stronger than you could’ve previously known. Habits take weeks to build and only days to break to be sure to instill a few small good ones to help you when you falter. The water is a great idea- a morning walk to clear your head and focus you (I have terrible terrible ADD) really helped me a lot. You’ve got this! I hope to see an update in the future where you’re doing well!"
iamverybadass,es6skrl,t3_c65jfb,1561656402.0,Maybe they’re cross eyed and asking you to stand on one side so they can see.
