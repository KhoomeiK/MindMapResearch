>You're also ... preventing products from being produced.

so the ""selfish coal workers refuse to die working in the mines, so now innocent american families won't be able to keep their homes warm"" argument. i know this convo was originally about Carnegie Steel, but this argument was used a lot in the coal strikes. would you be willing to kill yourself working in the incredibly unsafe mine conditions because of some moral obligation to produce product? i wouldn't, and i think no one else should either. the real obligation is on the employers to create reasonably safe working conditions.

i also can't feel much sympathy for Pinkerton, when the escalation of violence was typically along the lines of ""striker threw a rock at me, so i put a bullet through his head"". or in the case of the Ludlow Massacre, firing machine guns on crowds and burning men, women, and children to death in their tents. of course the strikers responded in kind afterwards, but that was an equal response, not the drastic escalation that Pinkertons were constantly guilty of in labor disputes.

i can understand wanting to see both sides of an issue, but i can't imagine why someone could feel more sympathetic to Carnegie than his workers, if that's what you were saying. your arguments all have merit in a vacuum, but when put into context of what actually happened there's a clear disparity in the levels of ""evilness"" on each side."

resupplier was worth taking in the past, and they buffed it from 40% to 50% faster resupply (and gave it +25% health restore), however the whole reason it was good was because it gave you more time to reach and use the resupply pod while in iron will. with IW restricted to 1 use, resupplier loses most of its value.

my answer to the question:

labels have upsides and downsides. it feels good to have a sense of belonging in a community, but we also get really tribalistic and end up mistreating people outside our community. labels are great for quickly identifying things and finding commonalities, but also can misrepresent because of course it's just a label, not a guarantee.

if someone who's AMAB likes all the things girls are stereotypically known to like, it can feel bad to be labelled a boy. it doesn't represent who you are. ""just be a boy who likes those things, my dude"" doesn't make them feel better about constantly being misrepresented and unable to identify with something that's generally expected to be a big part of your identity. for people experiencing dysphoria, it seems akin to telling a depressed person ""just stop being depressed 4head"".

i can't imagine the idea of gender / gender stereotypes ever dissolving (we love categorizing each other too much), but i also don't think we should try to get rid of them anyways. labels are fun! we just need to get better at navigating the problems they create.

but if they need to go to town after 20 mins of slaughter, they get a change of pace where they sell loot, buy some upgrades, pick up some quests, and maybe just chill out and enjoy the ambience of the town. now they're rejuvenated and itching to slaughter more baddies. fun!

when done correctly, these kinds of designs silently guide the player towards what's fun. when done poorly, they agitate and frustrate the player and make them feel like they're being forced to do things they don't want to do."

that is the entire endgame of poe. cost rises exponentially the closer you get to a 'perfect' item. if you want gear that's better, you're going to pay more, and more, and more. if you don't like it then don't do it, but that idea is sort of the crux of the game isn't it?"

right, baron already smashes all the content, so it's just a matter of whether you want to juice an already OP build with more damage or more tankiness. why is one of those options being viewed as the dumbest craft ever? look at how snide all the comments in here are"
