controlgame,fct7iy5,t1_fcpf06e,1577934936.0,"Interesting. When Emily and Jesse have their conversation regarding how badly Darling and Trench screwed everything up and how they wouldn't make the same mistakes, I scoffed. In my mind, of course they will make mistakes. Trench was arguably not even Trench anymore, he was taken over by the Hiss. And it wasn't like he did anything out if the ordinary to get taken over, he was just out in a mission. 

I think Emily and Jesse will do things differently, but if it's well written they will make mistakes purely because of the paranatural forces that they are dealing with, the fact that no one is perfect and the fact that the road to hell is paved with good intentions. Trench and Darling didn't think that they were awful people (although they both did express guilt over decisions made), and Jesse and Emily won't think that they are awful people either. 

Also, not arguing, just asking a clarifying point, because I think I missed aomething in my playthrough- how did Darling abuse Polaris? Also, do you think that Polaris and Hedron were the same entity?

I like your evaluation and I love talking about theories. Control was one of the best games I've played in a long time."

controlgame,fcnag1a,t3_ei1v9n,1577807359.0,"I picked Control for a few reasons. 

A) I've never been disappointed by a Remedy game. 
B) As soon as I saw the trailer with the office workers hanging in midair, I was intrigued. 
C) The graphics looked fantastic. 

Jesse being a woman had nothing to do with the choice for me. I don't see myself or identify myself with video game characters, it's just the main character. I love Alan Wake, Jack Joyce, Jesse Faden, Ronan O'Connor, Jill Valentine, Spyro the Dragon and Lara Croft all the same. For me, a character being interesting isn't about their sex (or gender), it's about their characteristics."

There were a few fights that took me a number of tries, but once I calmed down, stopped freaking out and analyzed it, I beat it. But man, that gut reaction when you first go into a fight...hard for me to shake."
