I'm just gonna bow out of this. You're obviously looking at this with a sexist mindset that she's done something wrong for her sexual past or present.

I'm seeing a flawed thought process that's validating something inappropriate that was done by one person because of the private life of another (who happens to be an employee of the first) and trying to correct it. Just because it's a woman that I'm defending the side of doesn't make me a white knight. I'd do it if it was a man. Would that be different? Calling me a white knight for my argument is just a cheap cop out which validates what Triple H did and invalidates Paige's feelings on it.

Let's take your simplified version. We'll remove my part about the ""presumed promiscuity"" and just say he's making fun of her promiscuity. It doesn't change anything about my point. What you still haven't explained is how that is okay.  That is an extremely inappropriate thing for someone to joke about to the public about his employee. Any other information about who they are, who the company is, what their role is now or previously, or what private information leaked is irrelevant to this."

Ever since Paige's leaks some people just can't get past blaming her for something or acting like she did something wrong. So something like this just a case of consequences for wrongdoing and she's not allowed to be upset. Let's take individual names out of the situation and see how it sounds:

""A high ranking official at a major company joked in a public interview about the perceived promiscuous past in an employee's private life.""
