sugarlifestyleforum,fg0dkzx,t1_ffzyzug,1580405558.0,"I doubt she understands how important the license issue could be. I do NOT think she rinsed him! He asked her. (I’m not a SB though) she just wanted to have fun and she’s young. I have a license too, I totally agree with you that he’s a moron! He’ll run into someone that does know how important it is & maybe they will scare him. Yet, you can’t really teach stupid people. 

SB didn’t have a duty in This situation to protect the doc’s license, in my opinion. If he were her (POT or existing) SD or boyfriend, it would be totally different. This guy hit on Her, he probably hits on every young, pretty women that sees him. They hit on me sometimes. I might scare them if I’m in the mood, but I don’t OWE dr. Creep anything! I don’t do anything to invite it! I don’t go out with them either of course. Dr. Creep owes me a harassment free exam. I’m fine with comments, jokes, really tolerant. But don’t ask me out/give me your number. 
Does that make sense?"
CougarsAndCubs,ffykdv0,t3_evs3ms,1580348517.0,"I’m sorry you’re going through this. You feel it more at this age too. The age gap isn’t that much, in my opinion. It’s the ages. That’s what hit her. 

Please try to not let this hold you back, however. You’ll need time, but you should date other women. Have relationships. It will be hard to not keep her in mind- ‘saving’ yourself for her. But you don’t know what might happen during that time. Either one of you might become a totally different person or fall in love. Don’t waste your years on something that is not certain. If it’s meant to be, it will happen. If it doesn’t, you might find something even better."
socialskills,ffybbr1,t3_evngco,1580342370.0,"I agree in general. People should be kinder and friendlier. But years ago when  I was a server, men would get aggressive about me Smiling and “being sweet”, having conversations with them. As if that was a requirement. Sometimes I was in serious pain; I just found out something bad (they wouldn’t let you leave unless you’re missing a hand! ); had a migraine; or stressed! Men would even make me Smile for them or call me a bitch/snobby/thinks she’s too good for us. I mean- WTH???  

I occasionally still have it happen in public. At least I can shut it down. I admit, my father also has this happen,  just not as often. It drives us nuts! We are generally happy, extroverted people who talk to others! But sometimes you have something on your mind. It’s no one else’s business if you don’t feel like smiling & talking. My dad helps people, so he’s often worried about someone dying or who just did or thinking of a way to help. I am often in pain or worried about a problem. Just please take cues from others and assume that someone unfriendly is upset about something. We don’t know what is going on with other people. But be 100% sure it has Nothing to do with you!! ;) It’s them. Just be compassionate, please."
femalefashionadvice,ffy8wa8,t1_ffxfzj8,1580340855.0,"I search for nice shoes that don’t hurt my feet. You can get them. Just seriously think about which styles hurt your feet- closed toe? Pointed, Narrow or square toe? Etc. Look at your closer, what styles do you wear most often. 
I have difficulty with closed toe heels. But I found that (designer) square or round toes, 1//2 size up, wear ortho inserts, work great. Or brands that have cushions all around, (sofft Eg) square heels, wedge, No spikes or kitten, etc. Toe inserts sometimes- they were great in ballet, so they certainly help here. 
Please don’t hurt yourself ladies. Or keep it under 2 hours. They look cute on now, but they will make your feet ugly later:("
bigdickproblems,ffxvb13,t3_evmun3,1580333123.0,"Generally, women don’t think about it. God knows they don’t put in 1/8 of the time you guys do :) men lie to us & we agree with them because unless they are some extreme- it doesn’t matter. (To most! It does matter to some women). 

When we say to you how many inches. OF COURSE we add to it!!!! Do you really think most women are rude enough to say smaller? Many women aren’t great at estimating, so I’m not chancing someone freaking out or having their feelings hurt. It’s something men spend lots of time thinking about. I’m going to be nice. I won’t guess 12 inches, (unless they happen to be) but I’ll guess larger than I think. I hope you don’t think it’s dishonest, but I’d rather you thinkI  can’t measure than I know it’s 4.25 at best:) I Never bring this up- it’s only when someone hounds me into guessing. I like men to feel masculine."
Swingers,ffuof3m,t1_ffsq0vs,1580246207.0,"With the stupid, immature things you say, how in the hell could anyone tell if you were joking? Especially since you gave examples. Others commented around you, agreeing with you as if you were serious. The only reason I believe you now is we all know you’re 4 inches at best. That’s why you are SO obsessed with the subject. Further, you are only using your made up bullshit to be a jackass to everyone. Don’t fool yourself that you are “helping” anyone. You don’t give a shit about anyone but yourself. You repeat that over & over:"
