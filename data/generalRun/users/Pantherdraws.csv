This is due to the compartmentalization protocols enacted by the Forerunners,[\[32\]](https://www.halopedia.org/Monitor#cite_note-bc70-32)  which intentionally limit a monitor's knowledge by design so that as  little as possible would be divulged should it be captured by the Flood;[\[28\]](https://www.halopedia.org/Monitor#cite_note-The_Ark-28) this measure became particularly essential after the widespread perpetuation of the parasite's [logic plague](https://www.halopedia.org/Logic_plague)."" - [Halopedia](https://www.halopedia.org/Monitor)

""I had gone a begging from door to door in the village path, when  
thy golden chariot appeared in the distance like a gorgeous dream  
and I wondered who was this king of all kings!M

My hopes rose high and me thought my evil days were at an end,  
and I stood waiting for alms to be given unasked and for wealth  
scattered on all sides in the dust.

The chariot stopped where I stood. thy glance fell on me and  
thou camest down with a smile. I felt that the luck of my life had  
come at last. then of sudden thou didst hold out thy right hand  
and say 'what hast thou to give me?'

Ah, what a kingly jest was it to open thy palm to a beggar to beg!  
I was confused and stood undecided, and then from my wallet I  
slowly took out the least little grain of corn and gave it to thee.

But how great my surprise when at the day's end I emptied my bag  
on floor to find a least little grain of gold among the poor heap. I   
bitterly wept and wished that I had had the heart to give thee my all.""

High Charity's biggest advantage was its *mobility*, which made it all but impossible to track down, but outside of that its importance was largely religious and historical. Virtually nothing was done in the city that couldn't be (and wasn't being) done on any of the hundreds of worlds the Covenant controlled. In fact, their most important shipyards and refineries *were* located elsewhere, and were just as zealously protected as High Charity itself (which is what prompted ONI to greenlight the Spartan-III program - no doubt if they'd been able to track down the Holy City itself, they would have sent their suicide children to destroy it, too.)"

If they'd just waited and *maintained a united front* until humanity had been eradicated, they could have given the Sangheili the boot and there would've been precious little those big dumb lizards could do about it.

But because of the presence of a new Sangheili settlement they weren't able to settle where they'd intended and were forced to move elsewhere, further into the desert, because they had no way of going back to the Sol system.

Sounds pretty impoverished to me.

IIRC that's also a sticking point among a large segment of the Insurrection - that the UNSC takes too much from poor colonies and gives nothing in return, even abandoning them when the Covenant came calling.

*A Spartan-III dreams of forgotten places*

>Only once did she stop, pausing to linger in front of a small yellow house with a blue door and white curtains. The yard was surrounded by a low wrought-iron fence and squat little bushes blooming heavily with round white blossoms, and scattered with a child’s toys - a small  bicycle, laid on its side in the grass, a ball patterned with pink and white shapes, a doll with curly brown hair, seated in a miniature chair by a miniature table, with another, empty chair across from it. A child’s wooden swing hung from a sturdy little shade tree, and a larger, benchlike swing hung on the front porch.

>It all felt so achingly *familiar*…  
>  
>*Why?*  
>  
>The front gate lazily swung upon its hinges, creaking softly as she pushed it open to step onto the sidewalk beyond. As if in a daze, Jeanette made her way up to the front porch, and stepped to the door.   
>  
>Behind  the door, behind the curtains, she heard the sound of a little girl giggling as she reached out to touch the door. Something moved the curtains in the window off to her left, but only momentarily, not enough to see inside.   
>  
>Her fingertips rested on the cool, slightly wet metal of the doorknob, poised to turn it.  
>  
>Something inside her told her that she couldn’t go in, not even if she tried. That that door, and whatever comfort lay behind it, was locked to her forever now.   
>  
>Still, she turned the knob, and still, she quietly despaired when the door didn’t budge. Grief, cold and crushing and terrible, welled up in her chest as she rested her forehead against the painted wood and squeezed her eyes shut against tears that threatened to overflow. *Please, please open… please, I want to go home…*  
>  
>But the door didn’t open, and she heard no more sounds of life from the inside.

HaloStory,fe6wrj2,t1_fe5t1dj,1578906867.0,"Well, to be fair, ""expensive cannon fodder"" is exactly what ONI *intended them to be*.

>""The Spartan-IIIs were designed to be cheap and expendable. Trained in  companies of around 300 at a time with a training regimen tougher than  that of the SPARTAN-II program,[\[5\]](https://www.halopedia.org/SPARTAN-III_program#cite_note-5) they were ultimately sent on high-risk missions that the UNSC could not accomplish even with the elite [Orbital Drop Shock Troopers](https://www.halopedia.org/Orbital_Drop_Shock_Troopers).[\[6\]](https://www.halopedia.org/SPARTAN-III_program#cite_note-6)  Though the casualty rates of the Spartan-IIIs stood at 100 percent on  some missions, to ONI, all the operations were strategic successes."" - [Halopedia](https://www.halopedia.org/SPARTAN-III_program)

While a very, very tiny percentage were expected to survive, *on the whole* the IIIs were never meant to be *long-term* investments like the IIs. They were meant to be (comparatively) cheap, mass-produced, and disposable - trained up quickly and *used* up on singular ""critical target"" missions.

The fact that a vanishingly small number of them avoided that fate and survived past their intended expiration date doesn't really change the fact that Parangosky and Ackerson viewed the IIIs as virtually nothing but suicide soldiers good for nothing but dying.

Our society has bought in to the erroneous idea that hard work and being a \~Moral Person\~ = riches, and therefore if you don't have money, you're just lazy and \~not working hard enough.\~ Poverty, in our society, is viewed as a Moral Failing rather than a societal one, and that's why people hate the homeless."
Vent,fdtyihv,t3_en24un,1578724334.0,"A few years ago, I had to put my foot down and give up the apartment I lived in because my then-roommate had flipped her shit on me for the last time. I'd been stupidly tolerant of her frankly abusive behavior because I felt bad for her kids, but that last time she crossed a line when she accused me of *stealing their Social Security cards and birth certificates*.

(She later found them in her mom's car, because - *like I'd fucking told her* \- they were ""missing"" because she'd *never put them away* after her last trip to the food bank.)

So I literally made myself homeless because I was done with her bullshit, and I stayed that way for almost two years (which is a whole rant in and of itself but let's not.) She begged and begged me to come back for *weeks* after I left, but no. Nope. It wasn't happening. I'd given her dozens of chances to straighten up and act like a decent, responsible human being, and she'd refused every single one of them. I was OUT. 

Everything worked out, though. Now I have my own place where it's quiet and secure and I have privacy, plus I can have my cat on top of it all. Is it a perfect life? No, but it's a damned good one and I'm glad I walked away from what I did, when I did."
