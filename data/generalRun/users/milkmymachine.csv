Also you can’t say just because they didn’t need to go to the hospital *by ambulance* that they didn’t need to go to the hospital, almost ALL of them need to go to the hospital."

I don’t think most commenters here understand the contradiction in saying he’s a fucktard one minute, then in the next minute saying he’s systematically dismantling democracy as we know it... like damn which is it? Evil genius or evil retard? Pick one or your argument doesn’t make sense."
pussypassdenied,ffa78e8,t1_ff9mw2m,1579729236.0,Tbh if I could get away with that I would. Can’t blame em.
politics,ffa6seg,t1_ffa1nl4,1579728988.0,"Right? I can’t go to the comments on this sub without immediately rolling my eyes. 

The biggest threat to democracy in modern times was the passage of the patriot act, which both parties and essentially all their senators rammed through gleefully. Either both parties are threats to democracy or no one is. 

And really if trump’s bumbling idiocy is a threat to democracy god help us if someone intelligent gets the office."

PublicFreakout,feehgmz,t1_fedss3v,1579033833.0,"Sorry you’re already getting annihilated with replies, but: I don’t agree with the ‘most,’ but I definitely agree with being highly suspicious of anyone’s motives who actively seeks a job like that, including police of course."

wholesomememes,fecb4i9,t1_fec9tqu,1578969954.0,"Hoo boy don’t even get me started on “good form” being just as much bs as “good posture.” I’ll agree* that discomfort for long periods of time  is a bad thing, so why would you recommend trying to force people into upright postures that aren’t comfortable for them or chairs that aren’t comfortable?"
wholesomememes,fec8uxq,t1_fec7xlo,1578968694.0,"If that’s what you’d like to believe that’s fine, just please keep in mind while saying it that you’ll be perpetuating a harmful narrative to anyone who might be listening and internalizing your anecdotal evidence; which isn’t borne out in any scientific literature. Backs just aren’t simple or fragile enough to have a single cause for pain, least of all from ‘good/bad posture,’ which is poorly defined anyway."
wholesomememes,fec7ugg,t1_fec4ap4,1578968159.0,"And you’re welcome to that unsourced opinion, but know that as of yet there is no scientific evidence to support that opinion."
