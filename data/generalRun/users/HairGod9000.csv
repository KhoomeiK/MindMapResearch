Who cares if they like you or not. If you like them and they treat you nicely, ask them out. Let them worry about what they want cause if they don't want you as an intimate partner at least you'll have the answer and can feel happy or sad about it depending on the answer instead of not knowing."

 ask them to do stuff with you. Its literally the only way. I know its anxiety producing. It makes me anxious too! but its the only way to do it. just invite him over to play smashbrothers or COD or crib or strip poker or w/e games you like. a little alcohol helps with the anxiety too but just a little not a lot.

here are some events in my life that maybe will help with the anxiety: A guy at work and I were kinda chummy when we saw each other. we left work at the same time which is unusual so I asked him to grab a beer. We are still chummy and are different enough that we probably won't become friends but might have another beer together. We are still chummy at work.

I met a guy at party. we liked the same video games and disliked the same things about the party. he gave me his gamer tag. We play video games together now and he's invited me over to try his new VR set.

Guy I knew from school asked me to a holiday part at his place like 5 times before I could go, then I did. It was fun. 

a female friend introduced me to her friends. I didn't like them. they were awful selfish people (so was she put she put up a better front). We pretty much stopped being friends after that event and she spread rumors about me. (point being that even if its a friend you're with doesn't mean you'll have a good time).

so just take the risk. all he can say is no like you did. my rule is ask 3 times before giving up. also sounds like you should talk to someone about your social anxiety. I mean you are scared to ask someone who likes you and that you like to spend time together so I'm pretty sure that could get you a social anxiety diagnosis."

datingoverthirty,ff27rma,t3_er7m65,1579496260.0,"It's a power move. It's not about the woman being a person or creating a relationship. It's not about consensual sex. it's not about attraction. it's about guys thinking that sex is emotional connection and that they can only get that from women and if they can't get it, forcing a woman to see their peepee is close enough to feeling wanted that some men will take it over feeling rejection. 

I know it's kinda a bit of a controversial stance but many men generally don't feel powerful. They don't feel emotionally validated. they feel scared and lonely and blame women for those feelings of inadequacy (which is totally unfair to women and wrong) because they see it as a woman's job to validate and accept their masculine insecurities and if a woman won't do that they will try to force the woman to do that or at least feel like they can force a woman to do that with pictures of their peepee.

yes it is. that is why I said the language she is being taught on how to request reassurance is not good, if she is only feeling anxious (as in needing reassurance) after making a mistake.
