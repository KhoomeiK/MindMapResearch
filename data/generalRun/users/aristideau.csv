The question is if this extra CO2 affects the Earths climate in an adverse way.

The Earths naturally occurring CO2 emissions surely must have varied by more than that amount (which really amounts to little more than a rounding error) during extended periods of volcanism in the past and yet, here we are. 
There is also the question of whether all that excess CO2 is detrimental to Earths ecosystem as CO2 is a vital component in photosynthesis.

An child psychologist interviewed the girl and when she asked her specific questions like *what time of day did it happen* and *what was daddy wearing* she froze and couldn't answer. The psychologist said with 100% certainty that the daughter had been coached and was lying. She would also turn off all the lights in the house ans tell the daughter *daddy wont give me any money and the power has been cut*(he produced proof that he had given her 10k).

Im flabbergasted as to what part of this you don't understand. If you believe that air pressure decreases with altitude then there comes a point where that value becomes 5 pp sq m.

It just dawned on me how FE's mentally model the Earths atmosphere with regards to a vacuum. You guys pressure in Earths atmosphere is somehow analogous to pressure in a sealed container, eg like a basketball or an oxygen tank. The problem with those *sealed container* models is that the pressure is the same at all points within the container.
This is a false equivalence because it is verifiable that the pressure in Earths atmosphere reduces with altitude. 
A more suitable example is the ocean. At 1cm under water the pressure experienced is virtually zero. Go down just a few feet and the weight of the water above is all to obvious to ones ears.
