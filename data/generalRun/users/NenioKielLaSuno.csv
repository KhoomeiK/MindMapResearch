That's a whole lot different than an old man willy-nilly deciding he's a teenager. You have to see the difference there. I mean, c'mon! You know how many trans people go through hell.

At first, I cut out the late-night snacking and just watched my portions through the holidays. I tried to be reasonable. I also increased my (ice) water intake and ensured the sleep I was getting was good, quality sleep.

Since the holidays have been over, I've been practicing intermittent fasting (between 15 and 24 hours, probably averaging around 18 or 20) and counting my calories. I'm a big enough, active enough guy that I can eat upwards of 2,500 calories a day. So I've been eating between 1,500 and 1,800 calories a day (averaging around 1,700) and the weight has been steadily melting off. 

Besides that, I've been trying to eat plenty of protein and fiber and get some healthy fats too. Your body has to work harder to use protein and it helps preserve muscle (as does fasting), fiber is great for digestion and making you feel full, and fat is also great for making you feel full.

I expect the loss will slow down a bit since a good chunk of these first 10 pounds have most likely been bloat and water weight. However, I do already look a bit better and definitely less bloated. I'm feeling pretty good and see no reason why I can't continue this way until I hit my goal.
