Where did it go?” He’s surprised every time my bf reaches back and pulls it “out of thin air” back into existence 🤣"

solotrio,fdvxgbk,t1_fdvv8gn,"Elitism (sorta), Reddit users generally consider themselves very “smart” so anything that seems silly/“dumb” catches a lot of downvotes.

“lmaoo 😂” on most social media shows that you laugh and genuinely enjoyed a comment, on reddit you just upvote it. Responding with lol will net the same result as an emoji. The workaround is “underrated” — though we all know that’s the same as saying lol or “good post” and the comment you’re calling underrated has been up for 3 minutes and will actually be rated appropriately in time.

Its just one of those unspoken things we abide by as a community, which isn’t necessarily a bad thing, things shared between a group of strangers brings them together."

Total_Junkie,fe6bx31,t1_fe62b5p,"I'm imagining a big dog rolling back and forth, immediately his legs give out as he hits the deck, tries to regain his balance for a second but quickly bumbles over. He becomes entangled in the net and whites in his eyes, vomits all over the mesh. After a few swings and constant struggling he is so completely ensnared he can only move his head...leading him to give up on escaping and instead, his eyes land on the nearby pile of vomit! He strains his neck, back and forth...until finally, the next roll gets him close enough and he gobbles it back up. (He doesn't get it all in time before the net swings back up and promptly gets puke all over his face, however. That gives his tongue something to do for the rest of the ride!) 

Rinse and repeat. 😂 thank you all for the image. When the boat comes to a rest, the pilot exits the cockpit to find a goofy looking dog all tied up in the netting, which is absolutely covered (along with the dog) in vomit and repuked-puke.

“Dupont” and “Dupond” are not only unfamiliar names to most English speakers, they’d be pronounced differently — so instead they’re “Thomson” and “Thompson.”
 
Similarly, Prof. Tournesol is a silly name but doesn’t sound that silly if you don’t know French (so his name is Prof. Calculus in the English version).
 
Milou/Snowy is the exception here —“Marie-Louise” was the creator’s first girlfriend and “Milou” is kind of a nickname/shorthand for that. Well not only would an English speaker not get that, they’d probably pronounce it like “Milo.”"

Our dog hated car rides so much that we gave up in trying to win him over to them (for a while we’d make sure his car rides were to things that he would find exciting, like parks and such). He’d so much whine the entire time, while occasionally scratching at the car doors — he was adopted from the SPCA and put up for adoption when he was a few years old, so we think he was traumatized by that experience — so as a result we ended up only taking him for car rides when he had to go to the kennel when we went on vacation.

Cats are fine with car rides if you start them out young. The problem is that most people only put their cat in the car when they are going to the vet, which never gives the cat enough time to adjust to cars. If you start a cat out young then they will usually have no problem with car rides the same way if you start a cat out with a leash at a young age then they are usually fine walking on  a leash. No one is loading their cat in the car to take it to the cat park or on a hike like they do with dogs."

OohChocolateSurprise,fe5wtq5,t1_fe5udap,user name doesn't check out
-Ernie,fe5xfqk,t1_fe5udap,"That’s normal for a crab boat, she’s standing on the hatch above the refrigerated saltwater tanks (RSW) which are full to the brim with saltwater and crabs. A little bit is sloshing out as the boat rolls, if too much comes out it will be automatically replaced by pumps. 

The RSW tanks keep the crabs alive until they get back to port."
BearDave,fe5xpae,t1_fe5udap,"Basically yeah, on almost any sort of ""working boat"" nearly every exterior surface will be moist if not have a film of water over it.  

This can be avoided by having higher sides, but then you run into the issue of being being able to reach over the edge and haul stuff up into the boat anywhere near as easily, not to mention needing a much larger boat in general to pull this off well.  

Beyond this boats generally have what are known as bilge pumps, in effect these are pumps designed to remove water from the boat that naturally builds up in the boat over time.  So even if you have large waves crashing over the boat, and ""filling the boat up"" the boat will almost certainly be pumping that water out with the bilge pumps."
Gorvi,fe5x408,t1_fe5wtq5,The rare Land Pirate
Pirate_Green_Beard,fe5xqpr,t1_fe5wtq5,I'm more of a copyright pirate.
Peter5930,fe5zjgm,t1_fe5xfqk,"When they get back to port, is that when the un-aliving happens?"
42numbers,fe60vri,t1_fe5xfqk,Don't they continually pump fresh seawater into the tanks? To keep the oxygen levels up and crab poop emissions down?  And to remove whatever comes out of dead crabs that kills the rest of the crabs? Because some of them die before being unloaded. They talked about all this occasionally on Deadliest Catch.
TARANTULA_TIDDIES,fe672jr,t1_fe5xpae,"So do you just get soaked if you're on a working boat? Does everyone wear waders or something similar? How do you keep people from slipping on the deck.

Lol I have so many questions about how this works"

olsmobile,febq05m,t1_fe5zjgm,A lot of the time the “un-aliving” is postponed until the un-rawing happens.
KungFuPundit,fe63zf1,t1_fe60vri,"That's it.  You are seeing the water from the livewell spilling out, and probably some other wave slosh.  But the deck area is sealed from the hull, and the water just rolls out of the scuppers and back to the ocean."
beIIe-and-sebastian,fe64dra,t1_fe60vri,"Yes, you're right. When a crab dies, it starts to release a toxin into its body which spoils the meat and starts it breaking down and decomposing. This toxin also kills other crabs."

Jbthorn26,fe61h81,t1_fe60u4t,Crabs need new water constantly or they die. Dungy crab boats don't use rsw but keep their fish hold pumps constantly running which keeps the hatch overfilled spilling water.

Olddude626262,fe6gtpf,t1_fe61h81,"Yes, and if crab pumps fail you get ""slack water"" in the hold which means the hold is no longer full of water and the remaining water now sloshes back and forth ( a powerful force) and significantly reduces vessel stability."
Total_Junkie,fe6ehrg,t1_fe6d7kq,"Or maybe it just really bums them out lol. Tod's dead, everybody, fuck this shit I'm out."
Glaselar,fe6sgcr,t1_fe6d7kq,"It wouldn't. There's plenty of stuff in dead human bodies that's toxic to live humans, but it's not because genetics made it that way.

Evolution doesn't mean everything is done for a reason; it means everything, on average, is just a bit better than some of the alternatives that came before."
MatchesMalone7,fe6c8vj,t1_fe69drf,There is a great show called The Deadliest Catch where they talk about it in greater detail. Short summary; It's only during crabbing season so its not a full year job unless you go out for more than crab. Normally if you been on the same boat you get a small cut based on your job and years of service on saod boat but that small cut could be 50-80k+(sometimes low end 30k or less) depending how much the boat brings back. Green Horns get a flat amount but some get a cut if they worked hard enough. Boat Captain/Boat takes the most. It's called The Deadliest Catch because one person a year dies on average in the crab season.

Nina_Chimera,fe61pzv,t1_fe60db5,I’ve always just seen it as a general term for people that have adapted to being on the boat without problems.
TheLurkingMenace,fe640lk,t1_fe60db5,"That's an odd way of using it, though not entirely wrong. ""Sea legs"" is when you've adapted to the sea and can stay upright without holding onto anything (unless the water is especially rough, then you need a hand for the boat and a hand for yourself.) When you go ashore, you still have your sea legs, so you have to adapt to walking on land again. When you're on land long enough then go back to sea, you need time to get your sea legs back."

An even bigger version of the Welsh terrier is the Airedale, exactly the same characteristics....just a lot bigger again

Irish Terriers are just amazing. If you encourage them, love them, train them and spend time with them you will be rewarded with a dog that is insanely fun, brimming with kindness and a friendship that will soften your heart in the most difficult of moments.

"" Release of a rehabilitated injured blue penguin adult (not a baby) back to where it originated from. The penguin had sustained a significant head wound from freeing itself from plastic netting. Pain relief, antibiotics, vitamins, rehydration, feeding and rest ensured a successful return to the wild.

Unlike the penguin species in Antarctica, blue penguins are largely solitary, and generally nest in small colonies or as individual pairs. ""

Just_wanna_talk,fdh64dc,t1_fdh549s,"Survival rates can vary widely depending on the species released and method of tracking. My wildlife rehabilitation don't do much tracking because the most affordable way to track is tags, but then it is extremely rare to get a report back on the animal because it would have to die, be found with tag intact, someone would have to know and care enough to report it, etc.

Also tags can interfere with wildlife and only be appropriate for certain animals. Can't easily tag a snake, or a humming bird where the tag will weigh a quarter of its body weight. 

GPS tracking would be the most accurate but it's prohibitively expensive and you often don't get the equipment back if you, say, chip of collar something and it gets eaten by another animal or dies in a lake or ocean. 


Most of the time it's just experience and skill in knowing the health of an animal is as good as it's going to get and keeping them cooped up in a hospital would do more harm than good that you release them, and you never know for sure if they survive 1 month or 10 years."

For sure.

That dog has a decent amount of fear going on.  

Of course, dogs, like people, can experience more than one emotion at a a time,  but the most noticeable one there is fear.

I'd be willing to bet that the dog did a ""shaking off water"" kind of thing after the girls were not doing that any more.  That or something like it. That is one of the ways they shake off stress."

Fair warning, the above did not happen for my dog at the dog park. She is traumatized. She is very hesitant to be around other dogs and does not enjoy being touched by strangers. She used to be overly friendly to the point where I'd say she'd follow anyone home. Unneutered dogs should be banned from dog parks and in this one case I would actually appreciate a Dog Park Donna around to enforce the rules.

I hate it. I want my dog to play with other dogs and thanks to the assholes who couldn't be bothered to neuter or step in when their dog pinned mine down in order to lick her snatch she won’t.

4) if the animal pulls back, let them.  Let them sniff your hand again and get comfortable.  Again, it’s a trust thing and they have to understand and trust you.

I mean, you are moving a hand above their head and out of their line of sight, there is a trust thing involved here.  Imagine if giants kept coming up and wanting to pat you on the head and back, without any warning or permission.

Hard disagree. Genetics is just as much of a factor. Black labs are predisposed to be spazzes just like bulldogs are predisposed to be lackadaisical just like border collies are predisposed to try and herd things. They don’t don’t need to be taught that they’re hardwired.

When a Corgi is born, the gods flip a coin. It's possible that you will get a delightful little dog. It's also possible that you will get the most stubborn beast you have ever encountered. Mine is filled with great intelligence and eager to please, if there is a treat on offer. Without the treat, he's not doing anything he doesn't want to do. 

They can also be very aggressive with other animals. Mine adores people, but will fight any other animal that gets near it. He's tried to fight everything from a Dachshund to a goat to a Bernese Mountain Dog. 

Corgis are often cited as a working breed, but mine is exceptionally lazy. It's a struggle to keep his weight in check, because he's not interested in doing active things. He'll chase a toy for a couple minutes at most, then pack it in. To walk farther than half a block would require dragging him. 

Also they shed almost constantly, at least mine does."

They were both the same, didn't know a stranger and loved people. Absolute ASSHOLES to any other dogs. Our female that passed away went after 2 twice her size pit bulls after my wife didn't see them and she yanked the leash out of her hand going after them. Just dove right in. I think the pits were more shocked than anything else. I got down there and got her before any real carnage began but DAMN wtf you thinking dog."

guy-incognito-,fea34gk,t1_fe9kyad,"mine absolutely loves people.  she has never shown any aggression to any one. (except people coming up on the porch when she's inside - mail delivery, food delivery etc..). we had our daughter when she was 6 months old, so she's very used to being pulled and poked by children.  she's never shown any aggression to little kids, if she's uncomfortable or annoyed she just walks away.  

she used to be suuuuper submissive to other dogs.  if we say a dog a block away on a walk, she'd lay on her back until it approached.  now, she's not as submissive.  she will snap at dog on walks if they aggressively approach her even if they're just trying to play.  off leash she might snap too, but after they back off she wants to play.  I think it's mainly big dogs coming up to her quickly makes her uncomfortable.  but she loves big dogs, her best friend is a mastiff/lab mix. 

I think mine is the most active corgi on the planet.  she constantly wants to play or fetch.  I'm convinced she's the fastest corgi in the world.  I send her to day care just to wear her out, but she still comes home wanting to do more.  rainy days are the worst, because she just bugs me to go do things.  

she also sheds an insane amount."
SeabgfKirby,fea5r3m,t1_fe9kyad,"This is my corgi. So much shedding. We had to get a robot vacuum to keep up with her shedding. We learned to live with lint rollers and not wearing black clothing. 

Then the barking. So much barking. Wind blows? Bark. Leaf falls? Bark. She farts? Bark. She'll do tricks for a treat and nothing else, unless it's my husband asking her to do it. 

She's not a very active dog unless we make her and then she'll keep up with me since I'm slower than my husband. We got her a k9 sportsack for longer hikes but she enjoys shorter hikes, especially if they end at a lake/stream. She's still overweight by a few lbs though because she's food motivated. Since we moved away from family she's better at keeping the weight off because my mom isn't feeding  her human food."
wildeflowers,fea0rf9,t1_fe9kyad,"> Mine is filled with great intelligence and eager to please, if there is a treat on offer. Without the treat, he's not doing anything he doesn't want to do.

lol this is so accurate. Hey, corg, please come inside. Stares. Corg! it's time to go inside. Walks away. Shake treat bag. Comes running.

Our corgi is totally friendly and has the best attitude, gets along with others, but yeah, she doesn't do anything she's doesn't want to without a treat. I'm grateful I started training her/taking her everywhere when she was 9 weeks. It made a huge difference, but the stubbornness is real.

They also bark a lot. Mine's not too bad, but it requires a lot of supervision to keep her in check. I've also never seen so much hair come off a living creature. Holy hell, my house is a fur ball. Oh well, I love that little loaf and she's the best thing to happen to us. I can see how if you're not super on top of it though, they can become little monsters. We tried to go rescue and I unfortunately couldn't bring any of the dogs they had into our household because of various reasons."
ScurrilousSalamander,fea8j24,t1_fe9kyad,"I adopted a dog a while back who’s part corgi. Sweet as can be but god is she stubborn, lazier than any pet I’ve ever seen, and she sheds SO BAD. ALL THE TIME. 24/7/365!!! There is no season that it’s worse than others because it’s always bad. She is very food motivated and will just stare at me unless I offer a treat or something. 

She’s the best dog I’ve ever had the pleasure of knowing though. She’s my daughters best friend, is extremely patient, and is the biggest snuggle bug. She’s also incredibly silly and makes me laugh all the time."
Scarya,feadapj,t1_fe9kyad,"I’m.....I’m sorry, but can you go back to the goat part, please?!"
dietcokeandastraw,feadji8,t1_fe9kyad,No offense but your dog sounds like a royal pain
T8ert0t,feamrw4,t1_fe9kyad,"As a new corgi owner, I am seeing that. To the point for I have treats in jackets, and odd places just in case there is an emergency situation. 

Last week, her harness slipped off. And we just stood staring at each other 10 ft away. Staring each other down, and her looking like she was think her success rate of just booking it and doing whatever she wanted. 

But then I presented a dried apple treat. And she was like, Yeah, cool. I was just kidding..... Of course I'll still do this walk with you."

Rev_Jim_lgnatowski,fe9y6zq,t1_fe9vpc9,"During his peak shedding seasons (it seems like there are three a year) it's hard for any vacuum to handle. Nothing like cutting Corgi hair out of the brush roller, so that the vacuum will work."
ClothDiaperAddicts,fea9ikp,t1_fea5r3m,"My derpy dog is a monstrosity of beagle/cocker spaniel/mystery dog. We think mystery is Jack Russell. He barks and bays like a beagle. At anything. He once spent 15 minutes barking at falling snow until I could get him back in. 

We live in the Great White North. There’s a lot of snow. The dog is just a moron. But I love him anyway."
trippinpotato,fea5rl3,t1_fea0rf9,">They also bark a lot.

I've got two, and am lucky that they only really get vocal at the dog park.  At home, they only really make noise when they want scritches or I'm being stingy with the treats."

Chester_Allman,feac4yr,t1_feabezf,"Yeah, I didn't blame the dog. I did blame the owner for sneaking away while I was checking to see if the bite had broken the skin (which it had). Cute dog, shitty owner."

wildeflowers,fea83ce,t1_fea5rl3,"There's a yippy dog in the house behind ours, and that's really what started it. If that dog is outside and ours is out, it will yip, and then game on, we're going to tell that dog whose neighborhood this is. If their dog didn't bark first, she wouldn't bark as much, but what're you gonna do. Dogs gonna dog. 

She also ""talks"" and barks at the mailman, but really her barking just requires management from her people. It's not crazy barking all the time, thank goodness, but they can be known as barkers. The times we can't take her places with us, she gets crated so she doesn't drive anyone nuts if she barks when I'm not here."

1. Record-breaking heat.

2. Record-breaking drought. 

3. Lightening strikes (in conjunction with the above two).

4. Positive Indian Ocean Dipole.

5. Alleged Arson.

You can read about a lot of the individual fires on the Wikipedia page. There is also an ongoing disinformation campaign/conspiracy theory that attempts to paint arsonists as the primary cause of the fire, which is also covered very briefly towards the bottom."
ThunderBobMajerle,fdps5ah,t1_fdpp0wr,"Same thing that starts them every year. Arsonists, lightning strikes, floating embers from other fires, sparks from trains. 

Its what's fueling them that is different than years before"
Raken_dep,fdprbdx,t1_fdpp0wr,"Its started by either arsonists (people who deliberately start fires), or, due to the dry lightning (lightning that strikes without rains), or, on some rare occasions, due to the brushing/grinding of the branches of the dried up trees due to the wind which can cause embers easier than usual due to the extreme temperatures and eventually the tree/s catch fire and then the strong dry winds blow these flames towards the trees in the vicinity of the burning ones. Once the fire starts it then comes down to a cycle of 

1. trees burning, causing smoke.

2. This smoke is accompanied by the water vapour. The water from the soil and the trees themselves starts evaporating due to the high temperatures that were already there before the fire started, but the high temperatures due to the fires increase this evaporation multifolds.

3. This smoke then goes up into the sky and forms clouds. And once enough of this water vapor is accumulated in the smoke clouds and the clouds reach a higher altitude, the water vapor condenses. Thus, untimely rains are caused

4. Rainfall accompanied with usual lightning. These clouds are drifted to other places by the strong winds

5. After a point, the rain stops as the clouds have really less or no water content left in them, but the clouds are still up there in the sky.

6. And these clouds, then, might cause lightnings and such lightning, (without the presence of rain) is called dry lightning. Keeping in mind that the clouds have drifted to some other place due to the winds, these dry lightnings might now hit the trees in some other places, thus starting a fire in a new place.

And, thus the cycle might continue for unpredictable durations"

The trees were about 12% moisture which is less than the moisture content when lumber comes out of a kiln after being dried/cured. EXTREMELY flammable - during a fire, trees actually burst into flames, like an explosion.

We lived in fear of fires. The Rodeo–Chediski Fire 
 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rodeo%E2%80%93Chediski_Fire  consumed the world around us and was partly caused by lightning strikes and partly by arson. I believe there was a woman who set a fire as a signal that she was stranded and another one set by a guy who wanted a job putting out fires. Unbelievable.

I flew over the area and it is incredibly scary and heart-breaking to see something like that in person. Something of the magnitude of the Australian fires is beyond comprehension for me. It soul-crushing."
StoneyLepi,fdpspxt,t1_fdpqgss,"To clarify this, lightning and arson are the direct causes, but climate change is the reason they are as bad as they are.

Last I heard there are 24 people in custody in NSW for arson, and VicPol just came out and said all VIC fires have been caused by lightning, or at least most of them.

The ""alleged-ness"" come from the Far-Right blaming something like 250 fires on arson and refusing to believe that anything to do with the climate has made an impact"
LambsHateMe,fdpvbt3,t1_fdpqgss,Also not burning or grazing(with cattle) undergrowth in forests is providing the fires with heaps more substance to burn through so the fires are building in intensity through the sheer amount of density of dry material in the forests and the like.

(Not trying good start shit)"
wtfbbqftwPS4,fdpykqj,t1_fdprbdx,"A decent description of dry lightning, but 1 minor nitpick here. Embers definitely contribute to the spread of fire, but absolutely no embers are created by “the wind brushing/rubbing the branches of dry trees together causing smoldering embers”

No wind in existence would rub a tree’s branches together fast enough to start a fire on its own.

You literally can’t make a fire by “rubbing two sticks together” the way you see in cartoons. You simply can’t move them fast enough to get an ember going, and wind is only going to be worse. The way you make a fire with sticks is spinning the point of a stick extremely quickly in a divot in another piece of wood. This keeps the friction in a small area long enough to form an ember."
ThunderBobMajerle,fdps7bi,t1_fdprbdx,Great explanation
Darkdemonmachete,fdpt2bc,t1_fdpp5ze,Or the 24 people who have been arrested for setting some of the fires. Some were volunteers to lit a small fire only to return and fight it.
VaATC,fdq50p0,t1_fdq25fr,All media outlets are guilty. Back in the early 2000s there were around 20 individuals that controlled the World's media. It may be as high as 25 today and Murdoch is only one. All of those individuals are tainted by the same urges to control as much of the World's population and just as guilty as the next no matter how much more guilty you think Murdoch is.

Zarmazarma,fdpqvqn,t1_fdpbs0l,"It seems unlikely that the moms would be dead and the joeys would still be alive. If the mom didn't abandon the joey, then the mom would be with the joey now. If the mom had died near the joey, then presumably the joey would have died as well. If the mom abandoned the joey to flee the fire, but did not escape, then presumably the joey would not have escaped either (since the mom is faster, and more likely to survive). 

So, unless the moms abandoned the joeys and then ran into danger, or the moms somehow died alongside the joeys while the joeys remained relatively unharmed, then presumably they're still out there.

Edit: I probably should have worded things better  but like some other people have said and what I (badly) attempted to say was, kangaroos are animals, not people. If they're in danger and it's a choice between just the mother surviving and having a chance to reproduce at a later date or both the mum and joey having a 50/50 on living or possibly dying, mum's gonna pick just herself. It's possible the mums did try save their babies but perished in the fires and being in the pouches could have protected the joeys enough till someone found them.  I'm glad these little ones did make it though and are in clearly capable hands."
Applejuiceinthehall,fdphxbc,t1_fdpgs0p,Kangaroo are almost always pregnant except for just after they give birth. They can pause pregnancy when they are raising a Joey. So they will probably replace the missing Joeys with a new ones soon.

emilyrose93,fdq0ucf,t1_fdpqvqn,"You’re probably right about this situation since it’s fires, but I wanted to say it is very common for a marsupial (animal with a pouch) to die while their baby lives especially with car accidents. In Australia it’s recommended that if you see a dead kangaroo or koala on the side of the road, you should check their pouch for a baby who may still be alive. I have heard of multiple cases where the baby was saved."

More kangaroo are linked to less severe fires. Likey there weren't enough in the fire areas at the time, otherwise there wouldn't have been as much foliage to burn. This is all explained in scientific journals with lots of specific studies - this is not my hypothesis. For eucalyptus, in a normal fire leaves grow pretty fast, but these fires were far too hot so many trees were actually killed. There's groups growing replacement trees right now."

Have them send a few pictures in to you, find the breed that resembles them the most (even temperament too if you wanna get crazy with it), then send them any listings in their area that fit the criteria.

It would help shelters, strays, and people looking for their dream doggo. I mean, I doubt enough people would be interested in it to make a career out of it, but it just sounds fun to me lol"

prettylittleliongirl,fdoeeth,t1_fdobvux,"Not that guy but I’m like 90% sure it’s at least part poodle (or might just be a shaggy full poodle). They’re “hypoallergenic”. 

Note hypoallergenic simple means they don’t shed, so you’re less likely to react to allergies. My boyfriend is allergic to dogs but his allergies are little to none with my hypoallergenic pup, and all his reactions to my dog disappeared after spending a week with him. 

Also, Claritin works wonders for animal allergies."
KnashDavis,fdodmw5,t1_fdobvux,I can ask if you'd like.
Marmacat,fdof03b,t1_fdobvux,"That looks like a golden doodle (even though it’s black, it’s still a golden doodle) - they are half standard poodle, half golden retriever and my understanding is that they are often hypoallergenic because poodles are. But apparently you can’t count on that some are - some aren’t. So if you want one, you should spend some time with the specific dog before committing to be sure.

I’ve known several of them and they are wonderful. Podles are the second smartest breed and golden retrievers are of course, unbelievably good natured (on the whole) so, speaking anecdotally, they are utterly delightful. 

Disclaimer: The views expressed in this comment are just my own observations and the “facts” are things I’ve heard from various people, and I can’t even recall who and I’m not a dog scientist or any other authority on the matter and all my dogs have come from shelters and I don’t condone designer dogs - I’m just sayin’ is all"

username4333,fdonmps,t1_fdobvux,"Hey, I used to have crazy allergies to dogs/cats too. I would HIGHLY recommend allergy drops. You can order a 3 months supply for pets from https://myallergydrops.com. I'm not a paid advocate, I just took them for a year, and my allergies almost completely went away. I can actually be around dogs for a few hours at a time now, although I don't pet them still.

If I completed the allergy drops though, I'm sure I could get them away completely. It just doesn't really matter to me at this point.

But if you want to get a hypoallergenic dog (the second thing I did), get a goldendoodle. They are the sweetest, cutest dogs on the planet and always very playful. I haven't had any issues with my allergies with them, and I regularly put my face up to them and stuff."

Traceyt715,fdoy8ek,t1_fdof03b,"Actually, this looks more like a labradoodle. Depending on the generation / parentage, labradoodles can have a wide range of coat colors and textures! For example, an F1 doodle can vary greatly, that’s pure lab and pure poodle parents. They can have medium or long coats, and the texture can range from wiry to soft and long. The further you go in lineage F2, F3, blah blah you’re in a sense getting a more “pure” doodle, because you’ve started to breed labradoodle with labradoodle instead of the two different breeds to get the doodle. The more doodle in the blood you tend to see those super soft looking, fluffy, wavy-haired pups that look like bears, and hypoallergenic traits are pretty hit or miss anywhere down the line, since poodles are but labs are not. 

Also, the closer to F1 it is, the more it will in my opinion look like it could have some sort of terrier / wolfhound blood like this one above, because of the wiry hair trait that still persists. 

I am in no way an expert, I know all this because I recently looked into rescuing a labradoodle so I did a ton of research!"

mtcwby,fdipxwu,t3_elkcgh,A malamute. They love to roam and they love people nearby. They were bred to pull sleds and be independent minded enough to not go blindly into a crevasse. That independent mind isn't always inclined to obey and they will backtalk which some mistake for lack of intelligence. They also have no problem being derps of the highest order.
Denelorn,fdixtwg,t1_fdipxwu,"Mines good at backtalking, sass with a fluffy ass."
motosurfingUSA,fdiyqd9,t1_fdipxwu,"Definitely host dog is a malamute, but op, what breed is your gorgeous dog!? That dog needs some love and appreciation as well. Look how happy it is to be going on an adventure!"
DorisBurkeSucks,fdj0lle,t1_fdipxwu,So he’s getting to do what he loves by roaming around his land. That makes me happy.

NOT_SAFE_4,fdj8vgc,t1_fdipxwu,"I had to take a full grown male on a plane once. When it came time to load him into his temporary accomodation at the airport, he wasn’t having a bar of it and splayed all 4 legs out till he was flat on the ground and lay there backchatting me incessantly. He did that for a solid 30 minutes, no way I was budging him. The people in the packed airport thought it was hysterical. The people waiting for the plane to depart, not so much. He was a beautiful doggo though."
btveron,fdj71ho,t1_fdipxwu,My parents got a Malamute puppy a couple years after my girlfriend at the time and I had adopted a Malamute-Pyrenees mix from the local shelter. We're not together anymore and she got full custody of the dog but he was and probably still is one of the best behaved dogs I've ever been around. Probably a combination of my ex's stern and consistent training and the Pyrenees half of the dog. When my parents got the Malamute I warned them that he wouldn't be nearly as well behaved without structured training and even then would probably still show a lot of independence. He's such a spoiled stinker now and tends to run off to explore the neighborhood if you don't leash him when going outside and he'll yell at you to give him table scraps and incessantly paw at anyone who he wants to play with while they're lying on the couch but he's a good boy.
eeyore134,fdj11o6,t1_fdipxwu,Sounds like a snow Australian cattle dog in terms of temperment.

Tells us when a package is delivered,  somebody got home, or dinner was particularly good. Lately he's been telling me to tell a kid to take him for a run or walk. The look of smug satisfaction when they do it after I yell upstairs to them is something to behold.

Edit: posted a video I found of him complaining because I wasn't moving fast enough.  He wanted a walk and I wanted to finish my coffee. You can't do both without wearing the coffee."

mtcwby,fdj4moq,t1_fdj3faw,"They are different and this one will probably be my last as I get older. As young dogs they will knock you down, pull you over and physically be tough to deal with. Think toddler with mad physical skills. At six months ours got out and was headed out towards busier streets.  You can't grab him if he's going full speed and he had about two lengths momentum.  I squared up and dropped my shoulder to tackle him and he put me down although I held on.  I'm  6-2 210lbs. 

I love the independence but they're not an obedient breed and will probably tend towards a GSD or a breed that takes training a little better in 10 years or so. He's a good, sweetheart of a boy that we love dearly but he doesn't always uses his strength for good."

mtcwby,fdj7ns0,t1_fdj71ho,They are escape artists. Ours doesn't beg but lays next to whoever's eating and he feels will be done first. They are very food oriented and I will give him a bite when we're done. We call it the tithes. He doesn't get much beyond kibble other than that.
misshapenvulva,fdjliba,t1_fdj11o6,"Ha, I have a Husky/Cattle dog mix. He is all of this. Tries to dictate which direction he wants the walks to go in, argues with you when you go the 'wrong' way. Pretty firmly tells me when the walk is over and he wants to go home. Thankfully the Cattle Dog part keeps the escape artist in check. Tries to collect a group together, even adding random strangers to the 'pack' if they are going the same direction.  Can put him on a stay outside a store and know he will be there when I come out. Demands treats from every business, he will blatantly walk behind the counter and give his best sit/head tilt until they give in. Charming strangers and I swear he tells us 'hey, watch this' before he does it. He has been a total handful his whole life, but wouldn't ever trade it.  Such a love, and so nice to have a smart reliable dog.

The ones we've had over the years have looked out for my wife on many hikes. Stopping and not letting her go on down a trail for one. Later they found bear tracks and scrapes and later saw a mother with cubs. The side effect is that you're not the real boss, just a companion they like a lot. And ours all loved people.

mtcwby,fdj5m1e,t1_fdj5229,"Northerns share a lot of characteristics mentally although my impression of huskys is a little hotter temperament and more constant energy. Sprinters versus heavy load carrying. 

Ours gets to sleep in the bedroom most nights but gets quite put out and will groan and lay down loudly at the door if not let in. We've learned to tell him to wait if we need privacy and then he moves down the hall and lays down. He hasn't woken us once and I'm a light sleeper. I think he gets that it's a privilege and parks himself across the room to sleep but loves being in the same room."

At night she doesn’t usually need to be let out, but if she’s not feeling well she will come over to my side of the bed and pant next to me until I wake up and let her out.  I’m usually a heavy sleeper compared to my wife but for some reason I’m tuned in to her anxious panting and will wake up when my wife won’t, so she comes to me."

After they get a half hour they're couch potatoes.  They do shed all at once and you have a blizzard on your hands for a couple of weeks a year. If he really wants one I would suggest one of the breed rescue groups.  They do a good job of figuring out any issues and personalities.  A six year old is pretty easy to handle.

Sad to say that some people dont know their companions well enough to understand they need to work better with their dogs before they go to to bigger dog parks and not pay attention.

DefoeGreen,fdixnsw,t3_elkcgh,I had a similar experience with an Air BnB host dog in Pennsylvania. The dog followed us everywhere and guided us to the local pond that we got clearance to swim in. I pushed myself swimming across the pond and triggered what I think was an onset asthma attack. I started panicking but suddenly the dog was under me and I found my second wind. I really do think that dog saved my life since my fiance can't swim and could only watch. It's almost as if they're there to make sure the guests don't die or get lost. Wonderful creatures.

Maybe you can't afford a car/swimming pool. Or you can't afford driving/swimming lessons. And even then, driving is a lot more necessary than knowing how to swim, especially if you don't live near any bodies of water.

halikadito,fdjih4u,t3_elkcgh,"My father passed away very suddenly in 2013. I'd grown up with my dad in Eastern Kentucky, and had gone back for a while to take care of his estate. One day, a couple of months after he'd passed, I was feeling very emotionally overwhelmed. My father and I were very close, and losing him was extremely devastating for me. Kind of on a whim, I decided to go on a hike. There was a beautiful place that we'd gone hiking together when I was younger, and that was where I decided to go.      


It was early morning when I pulled into the empty parking lot for the trails. It was sort of chilly, and I debated waiting for a bit, or not going at all. As I was sitting in my car, weighing my options, a dog came galloping across the parking lot, tail wagging and tongue out. She was a beautiful black and white border collie mix, and it almost seemed like she was saying ""What took you so long?! Let's get going!"" I got out of the car. I scratched her chin and rubbed her head for a while, then took off for the start of the trail - and she followed me.      

    


I started hiking along the trail, and she stayed by my side, occasionally veering off to sniff a tree or patch of moss, but she never strayed more than a few feet. I talked to her a little: ""Where'd you come from?"" and ""You have beautiful fur!"" and ""See that squirrel?""       

... and ""Me and my dad used to come here.""        
.... and ""Man, I miss him so much.""       




She stayed with me every single step of the way.             


The trail I took ended on a large, flat, rocky outcropping, with a breathtaking view of a large valley. I sat down beside the dog and thanked her for walking with me. I decided that I wanted to call her owners, to let them know that their dog provided some much-needed companionship to me when I was in a very dark place emotionally, and that I really appreciated her company.      



I checked her collar, and next to her rabies vaccination and registration tags, I found a tag that said this:      

MY NAME IS TILLIE       
I AM NOT A STRAY       
I LIVE NEXT DOOR       
LET'S GO FOR A HIKE        



I'm not sure why, but seeing that made me start crying. I just sat there on that rock and cried for a good 5 minutes while sweet, patient Tillie sat next to me. After I was done, I gave her a little hug, stood up, and started working my way down the trail. Once again, she stayed by my side.              


It was later in the morning by the time we got toward the bottom of the trail, and more people had started to show up. We met a family near the trailhead, and Tillie took off toward them. I watched for a few minutes as she began to hike with them up the trail, then went to my car and drove back home.       



It turns out [she was a well known figure on those hiking trails.](https://libraryguides.berea.edu/tillietheindianforthikingdog) She would hike with people daily.      

Tillie passed away in July of 2013. I will always, always remember and be grateful for that morning I spent hiking with her."

He was a biologist who would post interesting facts and tidbits about certain animals/species in relation to the original post or comment. He was sort of a meme, widely known across the site. One day he got into an argument with someone over whether or not jackdaws are technically crows or not. His stance was that they aren’t, the general consensus was that he was wrong on this one, but he fought tooth and nail over it. It came out that he used alt accounts to downvote dissenting opinions and get his own comments to the top, and he got banned for it."
Citadelvania,fe7pf0v,t1_fe7ke18,"I really think reddit needs to do more temp bans and warnings. I got banned from one subreddit for using (apparently) poor sarcasm and they took me seriously and it was annoying as hell because not only was it a misunderstanding but if it was a warning I certainly would've been more careful afterward. Instead mostly I just see people being straight up banned (and then they probably just make an alt account and go around it anyway).  


Like clearly he should be warned or temporarily banned for that kind of behavior but it's hard to say that his presence wasn't overall a very positive influence on the community. If you warn him and he continues doing it that's one thing but a zero tolerance policy is just garbage."

I'm asking because I saw a post about that exact behavior recently stating that so far only humans, grey parrots, bonobos and another type of primates has passed that test so far.

Is there an expert here that can give more insight?

EDIT: The responses prompted me to look up some further information and I found [this](https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/jan/09/feathered-friends-study-shows-selfless-parrots-helping-peers).

However, an argument could be made that that's exactly what the older cat is doing: there is no profit for the larger cat in helping the smaller one, however it helps anyways. There are no resources exchanged, though, so I don't know if a comparison is reasonable here."
RabidSeason,fe77e9w,t1_fe7518k,"That wasn't about *helping*, it was *giving*.

Dogs help other animals all the time.  Several types of sea creatures have helped others stay out of water either to breathe or escape predators.  Vampire bats will vomit to feed other bats who didn't eat.  And many other animal types will pair up to help each other."

Prosocial behaviour is something evolution has solved multiple times, it’s a “good move”.

Perhaps you mean generosity, as in giving up resources without the promise of reward? Or a concept of fairness—I believe I’ve heard that is a very narrowly exhibited trait."

Zhentar,fe8t4ee,t1_fe77e9w,"That's incorrect - it was about *instrumental* helping - altruistically assisting with a task/action. A simple example would be picking up something out of reach, or moving an obstacle out of the way. The key cognitive task is recognizing what action is being attempted & how to assist with it. 

The birds recognized that another bird was trying to get a treat, so they assisted. The token passing scheme in the experiment helped to establish altruistic behavior, but was not a fundamental part of what was being tested."

So the study/post you read about must be referring to something more specific."
plantenvy,fe8dwe0,t1_fe77vje,"I'll hazard a guess based on the small variety of animal classes I've taken and say it's likely a little of both.

From my memory (which admittedly can be shaky lol), it was only a handful of species that were observed giving up their own comforts without coercion in order to help their peers. So for example, one day you skip eating to give your lunch to the kid in class who never gets to eat anything. You're foregoing your own satisfaction/needs because you recognize someone else needs help and empathy drives you to act. Lots of animals have been observed being helpful when there's no real benefit, but far fewer are helpful when it's actively detrimental."

smilingonion,fe72w7j,t3_eo135x,"I made a similar cat toy for my cats...a tiny stuffed animal( I sprayed the toy with catnip too) connected to an elastic cord hanging from the middle of a doorway

Of all the store bought toys they also had they played with this thing the most

BTW Check the reviews on different brands of spray catnip...some are virtually crap products and some your cats will love(price is not necessarily an indicator of quality either)"
Rejusu,fe74x9x,t1_fe72w7j,"Also worth noting that only about half of cats actually have any reaction to catnip, the rest just ignore it. Though barely any cats have an immunity to elastic dangly toys."

WeatherwaxDaughter,fe77anp,t1_fe74x9x,Mine is more into valerian...Trashes teabags when she can!
brown_paper_bag,fe7rarq,t1_fe74x9x,Silvervine is a great catnip alternative. My non-'nip cats enjoy the toys that have 'nip and silvervine in them. At least that's what I think the soggy mess indicates when they're done licking it lol
smilingonion,fe770ft,t1_fe74x9x,"I let the stuffed animal dangle about a foot off the floor so when they clung to it on their back enjoying the catnip as soon as they let it go it bionged all over the place prompting them to catch it again

I set this up over the door of my computer room and at least once a day as I was going through I would grab the toy and pull it to the window sill where I kept the catnip and give it a spritz then let it go

BTW Before you assume your cat is one of the 50% that aren't affected by catnip try a different well reviewed brand...my first time I went cheap which was a total waste of money then I tried a brand that had been highly rated by other buyers...BIG difference"
Rejusu,fe7stkt,t1_fe7rarq,TIL there's a whole world of cat narcotics.
sleepingqt,fe7tgmx,t1_fe770ft,"Also check if your area just grows catnip. We have it ALL OVER here, growing wild. Really likes to live under pine trees it seems. Dunno if it's the acidity, shade, lack of competition or some combination thereof, but that's where I usually find them. I stole some plants from my mom's yard and have been growing it for my cats. The leaves are fuzzier than the ones I grew from store bought seeds. It grows super super easy so in general, anyone at least in my state that pays for catnip is wasting money :D Oh and fun catnip fact, since it comes up more when you give them fresh leaves -- while the scent can rile them up, it actually makes them sleepy when ingested!"
smilingonion,fe85mma,t1_fe7tgmx,I like the spray the best...one spritz and any of their toys is now a catnip toy

MegaYachtie,fdxjo2j,t1_fdx3blu,"I spent some time in a Thai prison and one of the things that got me through that experience were the cats. They were wild as fuck and no one actually knows how they first got in there but there was about 20 adult cats in my block.

3610572843728,fdy4eb2,t1_fdx3blu,I saw a documentary about a prison that did that cat program. They said it was incredibly effective at threatening prisoners. If a prisoner kept threatening to attack or beat up another prisoner they would warn him that if he did that they would have to lock him up in solitary and because he would be able to care for it they would have to give his cat away to someone else who may not treat him as well or take it back to the animal shelter outside of the prison. That threat alone usually got them to quickly behave. Prisoners with the cats were almost always on their best behavior to not risk losing them.

The dog becomes “adoptable” and the inmate gains skills to put on a resume, and a sense of personal fulfillment. It’s fantastic and beneficial for all. I am so grateful to the inmate that took care of my good boy and taught him that people can be good."

He tried to act like it wasn't a big deal, but I could tell he was devastated. 

I just imagine how nice it would be to hang with a dog in that environment. I've never been to prison, but I know it's a place where you can't really allow your emotions to show.

1.  A guy randomly took credit for it including an original Kat killing vid.

2.  Guy was found and commited suicide

3.  The guy didn't do it but no mention of where the cat killing vid he posted came from

4.  The two main internet sleuths Of CoUrSe immediately knew that guy didn't do it and VaLiAnTlY tried to stop the pitchforks

5.  Documentary moves on with barely 1 passing mention of it later that says it probably was not the internet sleuths fault at all

There was a lot of other weirdness like how the sleuths never really seemed to accomplish anything but idk still was relatively suspenseful"

Got on with most of the guards and even the prison president took an interest in me. Helped a lot of people out with their English and the Thai prisoners always wanted to talk football and about England. Having the british embassy checking up on me is like having a cheat code in a place like that.

i can't remember the book but one of the survivors of the holocaust said this was how it was at whatever camp he was at, probably all of them. getting in good with whoever controlled the ladle, and the entire process centered around getting more to eat than just broth, it was central to surviving in such harsh conditions.

edit: i think the author i'm talking about, he did something for some resource, trading it for another then another resource, then giving it to the one in charge of ladling out the soup. i'm probably remembering it wrong but it was an involved process just to get a chance of a bit of food  to keep you going on to the next day, living day to day as you said.

I met with the mother before I knew what he'd done, and she 100% convinced me that her son was the victim of institutional injustice. Once I got the actual story, I had to leave my office and just went AWOL walking around a nearby shopping centre for about 30 minutes in a circle because just HEARING what he'd done put me into full-blown adrenaline mode. I felt physically sick, my hands were shaking... I couldn't stop thinking about what could have happened if he hadn't been caught when he was (and it was bad enough already). 

The mother, to this day, despite 11 separate people testifying against the son (who didn't know each other until it became apparent that all their cases were connected) maintains that this is all just a big conspiracy against her baby. She is adamant that all the victims are lying, that the institution that ended up facilitating them going to the police, after it became obvious what was happening, concocted the entire thing despite having every reason in the world to want the OPPOSITE to be true, and that the police persecuted her son. Why? Because he's a brilliant young man who makes people jealous and resentful, in her opinion.

This woman came to the building where I work, brought a bunch of her family members (all female, all around her age) and they all went to different departments pretending to be her to confront numerous people to try and ""catch us out"" in our ""conspiracy"" against her son. She's absolutely insane, and despite her son being a literal psychopath\predator... she genuinely believes it's the hundreds of people who worked on his case who are the liars.

These monsters don't come from nowhere. This boy has been taught his whole life that he's hyper-special, that he can do no wrong, that he can do whatever he likes, and if anyone complains then they're the bully/aggressor/wrong one who deserves to be ridiculed and attacked. He's been taught that no matter what he does, no matter how sick and frightening, that his mother will blame his victims and deny the evidence of her own eyes."

The inmates apparently train the dogs to prepare them to be adopted, and it sounds like this guy had been doing it for a while. They paired him with a dog with some problems because they figured he could handle him. The guy trained the dog, got him ready for graduation and adoption, and then they took the dog to get him ready to work on getting adopted.

The inmate was naturally upset about it. They said his stomach was hurting, and the other guys in prison were telling him it's because he missed the dog. He told his parents he wished that dog was his last one before he got released because he wanted to adopt him.

So the parents adopted the dog to have him waiting for the guy when he finally got released.

I looked around at the time for an update and found that he's out now working as some sort of dog trainer/foster (something like that), and he has a whole bunch of dogs he's working with and seems to be doing well.

The problem is our culture around rehabilitation and punishment.  There is a strong perception that the threat of severe punishment in prison (and the more extreme the punishment the better) creates a disincentive to commit crimes.

This is of course complete bullshit (the part about hard prison life or long prison sentences).  But too many people can't stand the thought of a criminal receiving rehabilitation or getting anything 'for free' (education, mental heath services, job/skills training) that would help them become productive members of society.  Until we change the culture around crime and how to prevent people from becoming criminals in the first place and how to rehabilitate them, then the US will continue to have the highest incarceration rate and highest  recidivism rate in the world (or one of the highest)."

Drug rehab is the most obvious one. We've had a massive push to stop jailing addicts and get them into rehab. But the state doesn't run any. So you go to a rehab run by a for-profit company. The guy who runs it is a former junkie who ""found Jesus"" and wants to give back. They tell you your heroin / meth addiction can be prayed away. Shockingly, Jesus isn't as effective as methadone or suboxone, and the patient walks away from the facility. There's no accountability for the rehab for having a 90%+ fail rate.

Phone calls are inflated to absurd pricing, commissary or canteen pricing is usually inflated as well, and the companies that contract (exploit) public prison labor pay a fraction of what minimum wage would be to an un-incarcerated employee. Privatization goes much deeper than the small fraction of privately owned prisons."
brotherenigma,fdxh6nj,t1_fdxcdqp,">Private prisons aren't shaping US prison policy. That's just systemic racism. 

Ehhhh agree to disagree. It's a vicious cycle of both of them feeding off each other. And the only reason they make up less than 1 in 10 prisoners is because so many have been shut down in the last decade or so, and because the Federal BOP decided not to renew private prison contracts in 2016."

I remember watching a documentary of a prison (I want to say in California) that has a program like this with cats and dogs. So there's a cat wing and a dog wing of the prison, and the prisoner can choose which wing to participate in. The cats roam freely, and if elected, prisoners can house the cats in their own cell (litter box, food etc). Those with dogs will take the dogs outside and help train them. Other inmates can volunteer to learn basic vet skills and check the animals when they get sick (check ears for mites and even check stool samples for worms). 

Programs like this are truly wonderful. I feel all prisons should have something like this."

thevulturesbecame,fdkkpe8,t1_fdkh599,"Yeah, this is a decent rule of thumb for working dogs. There's an inverse relationship between sociability and ability to work.

Dogs that are less social general mature out of puppyhood much more quickly and are naturally more motivated by tasks and learning than they are by cuddling you and running in circles with other dogs. Less social dogs are also generally much better able to focus. And of course, the value of a high-energy dog in this situation is pretty self-explanatory. 

These qualities lend to a great dog in this field of work (police, rescue, etc). Of course, there are other kinds of dog work where the opposite personality is much more desirable. E.g., retrievers (labs & goldens) make great emotional support animals because they take to close human companionship readily and are not obsessive in nature. It's easy for them to calmly abide by whatever their person needs, and they're comfortable being handled.

Hunting dogs fall somewhere in the middle. They are high energy and have a strong prey drive, but are *usually* also social and make great family dogs (spaniels, pointers, weimaraners...)."

thevulturesbecame,fdlsfl7,t1_fdknuhk,">obsessive, high energy, and less social but she also gives zero fucks about food or pleasing us

This describes my dog exactly, actually... I feel your pain! The solution for me was to find what DOES motivate her (something she can hone in on, like a ball being thrown). You can use play/entertainment as a motivator for some dogs just as well as food. The challenge is that you inherently break their focus from the training once you initiate play time. An obsessive, focused dog generally quickly learns that they have to reel it back in and demonstrate the appropriate behavior to get the positive stimulus cycle to repeat though.

Unlike your dog, mine is pretty submissive (although she goes apeshit if she feels threatened by another dog, so I make sure to keep her attention on me when bigger dogs are around her). Dominance training would have worked on her for sure too, but only because she would continuously submit to whatever the fuck I was demanding out of fear and guilt. Not my style either, so good on you as far as I'm concerned!

If she's a good dog (not destructive, not aggressive, etc), then I'm sure your training went fine, even if it wasn't what you intended :)"

thecuriousblackbird,fdlolr3,t1_fdko7w9,"Humans are considered social animals because we live in a society. Anyone who isn’t social is seen to be sick. I think that autism won’t be seen as an illness for much longer. Our society has changed more in the past 50 years communication and technology wise than in the past 10,000. Our society no longer revolves around small groups of people doing everything face to face. 

Finally the people who excel at other skills outside of those social networks are getting their chance to shine. The border collies have just been introduced to sheep. These people aren’t broken, they were just jobless for the last 10,000 years and were made to feel like they were sick. Since autism is a spectrum, there are people who need a lot of help. But it’s more like teaching them a non verbal language so they can better interact in a face to face conversation than being broken."

sharpasabutterknife,fdkqxey,t3_elt8hd,"I want a koala detection dog! I live in Canada though, so he will have to work extra hard for me..."
CaptCaCa,fdkz6b7,t3_elt8hd,I wish my dog would keep shoes on her feet.  Those shoes are awesome.  Way to go.
cocknrolla,fdl0nzn,t3_elt8hd,"Once found a Koala who didn't want to be found - Was trying to live out his life on the run as an Opossum, knew the jig was up when Bear showed up the scene. He'd spent too long trying to fit in with the other Opossums, but never really left his past behind.

That's how Bear lost an ear folks, but he never gave up the good fight. Bear remarked in his memoirs; ""I knew many were worth saving, most of the rest worth trying to save, he might have got an ear, but I guess he just never heard the word, that Bear can smell chlamydia from 5 miles"""

Watched my dog chase the squirrel along the fence, they’d get to the end and then the squirrel would chase Lulu to the other end. They would do this for hours on end.  Was fucking beautiful.  

Squirrel had a drinking problem though. We had crab apple trees that we couldn’t keep on top off the fruit falling off so good as I was always working. I’d rake them into a pile at the end of the day and then just never really cleaned them up. Squirrel would tuck into a fermented apple and get all fucked up. Stumbling, slurring words, falling out of the tree. So now I had a squirrel to drink with!  Was fucking great.

Unfortunately. Story dosen’t end well. Saw it try to climb a tree and it fell off. I ran outside to check on it and it had been hit by a car. Back legs where broken. Was a mess. And. Let’s just end it there.  Broke my heart though."

My cocker once got too interested in getting a good smell of a male and the koala ripped in to her. Not my proudest moment but a decent kick separated the two before either got too injured.

All animals are “stupid.” And it turned reddit away from them bc it’s funny and people think it’s all true. But they’re just like most animals who really don’t want to do any harm to anyone. They just want to eat, sleep, procreate, sleep, sleep, and find new trees. So reddit hivemind groupthinkers have this animosity towards an animal that’s already being screwed over by humans for no reason. 

The ONE good thing about this wildfire is that koala sanctuaries, rescues etc are finally receiving the funding they’ve needed for years to help protect them. And they need it more than ever now that their population is dwindling. Prolly controversial to say that, so hopefully nobody takes it the wrong way. It just breaks my heart seeing vids of koalas confused and lost, burnt and singed because their only homes are lost. And now the world sees it and can help. Hopefully we can get their population rising again and better protection for their habitat. 

I’ve stated this many times on reddit, but koalas have become my fav animal because of my wife. When we were first dating, I said she looked like a koala and she thought I looked like a corgi. So now it’s our nicknames for each other. Ever since I’ve been fascinated by them. We adopted a mom and joey months ago to help out. 

What’s even more sad is that we’re both in the US military and people are more concerned with war in this country than us using our resources to help out one of our best allies. We should be offering all the help we can down there, and it sucks that all her and I can do is donate money when 1900 homes have been lost and 27 people perished. It’s insanity.

They have been living in substandard habitat - the trees can no longer sustain them
They are stressed out - they usually don’t leave their trees, so being on the ground AND searching for water means they are very stressed
While the pup is being a total bro a koala wouldn’t usually just sit there and drink unless it was extremely fatigued. 
Am so glad it has found a bro and some water but also sad because the poor koala is trying to survive.

JohnnyStFartHugger,elxvtw,top_level,
JG307,fdl2wmt,t3_elxvtw,Do you have prior experience with animal training? My mother is hearing impaired and needs assistance but professionally trained service animals are outside our budget. I wish I could do it myself.
Son_Of_Borr_,fdl3uh4,t1_fdl2wmt,you can. We have two deaf dogs and two hearing dogs. The training is exactly the same. Say the command with a hand signal attached. All our dogs know hand commands as a result. So if you trained a dog normally using a combo of vocal and hand commands you could totally have your mom talking to them way faster than you think.
JohnnyStFartHugger,fdl6gg3,t1_fdl2wmt,"I actually don't, this isn't my first dog, but this IS my first puppy. Training wasn't hard, just taking the time to show care and attention is important. I taught her basic commands at around 9/10 weeks old once she became comfortable in her surroundings and was familliar with me. 

I started with vocal commands, one at a time. Once she became confident and familliar with them, I moved onto doing hand gestures along with the vocal command. So I'd sign sit while telling her ""sit"". I slowly weaned off of the vocal commands and she'd watch my hand gestures to know what to do for her reward. She picked it up very fast and in less than a week she was following the ASL commands better than my vocal ones!"
midgethepuff,fdl9hbc,t1_fdl2wmt,You don’t even need to do real ASL signs. To get my dogs to sit I snap and then point downwards and they understand that perfectly.
dada5714,fdl8p2b,t1_fdl2wmt,"This isn't exactly the same, but my girlfriend generally trains with verbal commands and I generally train with hand motions. While they aren't ASL, it'd just be the same as replacing my hand spinning motion for ""spin"" to whatever that may be for in ASL."
DragonMeme,fdlfpuu,t1_fdl2wmt,"No one is hard of hearing in my family, but we used to have a dog that worked in a movie. They use hand signals during filming since they obviously can't use verbal commands. 

In every dog since, my mom and I use the hand signals and verbal commands simultaneously to train them. Eventually you can just use the hand commands and they'd get it. Not a service animal level obviously, but at least your mom could sign to the dog and have them understand."
1-0-9,fdlhkbw,t1_fdl2wmt,"This is totally possible! I have a Deerhound/Collie mix who 100% responds to hand signals better than he listens to voice commands. It is amazing. He is a rescue and his first home had him for 2 years and severely neglected him. He bounced back from 2 whole years of neglect to being incredibly smart. If you find a dog who just naturally picks up on signals, go for it. I would seek out young dogs at shelters whos trainers have noticed their knack for picking up on commands.


I don't have any ""official"" signals for my dog so I made them all up. But I have signals for sit, stay, lie down, okay (release command from stay), paw, other paw, come, back up, twirl, stand, speak, jump, crawl, and bow. 


It is very easy if you have a smart dog (I 100% suggest getting a large poodle mix or a border collie/collie/aus shep mix if you can handle the energy level) and will be even easier if you find a good food reward during training."
recyclopath_,fdldb93,t1_fdl2wmt,Dogs actually learn hand signals much better and faster than verbal commands.

and start watching it. 

Training hand signals is pretty straightforward - lure with food, attach verbal command, then attach visual cue. 

It's ofter actually easier to teach visual signal, as we tend to talk to much in an inconsistent way, but show visual signals very consistently. Remember - dog doesn't understand a single word you say. Repeating sit, sit, SIT, SIIIIIT, siit, with different tone and volume (we all do it) doesn't help - for the dog all of those are different sounds. 

Good luck."
a_Moa,fdluav8,t1_fdl2wmt,"There are some good resources for hearing dog training on YouTube if you're wanting to teach her specific ways to help your mum, such as letting her know if the smoke alarms going or someone's at the door. Takes a lot of patience and perseverance with training but certainly worthwhile. The only criteria I know that they have for selecting hearing dogs is that they're very alert to sounds."
lilpopjim0,fdlhdef,t1_fdl2wmt,"You can do it! I trained my dogs with hand movements, using flicks and positioning. Its good for sit, beg, stay, lay down, all those good things! They respond more to my hand movements than they do commands to be honest. Most likely because they know the treat is in the hand doing the movements so they keep a keen eye on it."
normanbeets,fdli7ru,t1_fdl2wmt,"There are YouTube training courses and books on the signal training dogs! They are very apt to it, my chihuahua even knows all of her commands by hand and she's an idiot."
TheNimbrod,fdlijro,t1_fdl2wmt,"Dogs are super effective in interpreting anykind of commands by humans. thats why that symbosis worked in the first place. audio commad dogs does stuff till he gets treats. visual comands dogs does stuff till get treats. treats is the sabe button for dog comands. you do rolling movemrnt with finger, dog rolls on the floor. give treat dog be like ""okay he makes that rolling thing with his index finger, I rolle on the floor and get a treat... mhm okay I'll do that again the next time"""
funkymunniez,fdljc8c,t1_fdl2wmt,"You can totally do it yourself.  Dogs are significantly more reactive to body language in training than they are to verbal commands.  There are a lot of books you can pick up that will help if you take the time to look.

The basics of it though are working on associating a physical gesture with a behavior and marking that association when the dog performs by offering positive reinforcement.

You should teach your dogs hand signal commands regardless of anyone in your life being hearing impaired.  Your dog might be deaf one day themselves!"
jefferlewpew,fdljgz4,t1_fdl2wmt,"A lot of dogs find it easier to learn hand signals because they're more distinctive than words - they can't understand the words themselves, it's that we make the same noise each time we say it as a command. Equivalent is probably a native English speaker trying to learn a tonal language like Mandarin with no translators"
RedeRules770,fdljk56,t1_fdl2wmt,Actually training dogs to respond to hand signals is *easier* than verbal commands! Dogs read physical signals wayyyyyy easier than our words!
justavault,fdljnmh,t1_fdl2wmt,"Don't want to be the guy, but usually you ""always"" should train your dog with giving hand commands simoultaneously. Not the least because the conditioning is entirely the same, you just also do hand gestures whilst giving the commands and then only give hand gestures.

Every dog who does obedience sports is trained like that. My dog did as well. That is specifically necessary when the dog is out of hearing distance and you give it a command for stop, or stay, or sit, or whatever you want. Simple hand gestures are then required to be seen from afar.

So, it is actually unnecessary to teach the dog the commands in ""sign language"", it is way simpler in simple hand gestures like showing a specific finger, flat hand, frontal hand etc.

Also it is way more convenient for you and for the dog if you give the dog a command whilst you talk to another person. You can simply show him a hand gesture and he sits."
Mike312,fdl61sy,t1_fdl3uh4,"Yup, did this with both of my dogs. Sit, stay, okay, come, lay down, etc all with hand signals. Eventually your dog is gonna get old and often the hearing starts to go early, so having them trained with hand signals at a young age means they're well-trained at an old age. And sometimes you want to tell your dog to do something while brushing your teeth."
NotMrMike,fdlcohe,t1_fdl3uh4,"I taught my dog hand controls by accident. I'm quite animated with my hands when I talk, so I just naturally made hand motions whenever I gave a verbal command.

Now I dont need verbal commands, he just follows the hand movements (of course if hes not looking at me I *do* need to use words though)."
bigbaltic,fdlevhe,t1_fdl3uh4,This also works with baby humans. They learn hand signals way before they can form words
haylz92,fdlh4qq,t1_fdl3uh4,Agree with this. Did this by accident with my dachshund who now gives paw whenever I extend my hand to him
vomitfreesince83,fdlhxek,t1_fdl3uh4,"I don't have any docs/evidence to back this up, but I feel like dogs learn better with hand signals anyways. Voice commands make sense to us, but a dog's got to learn to distinguish the language. Dogs respond better to voice inflection"
PartyPorpoise,fdlhwwh,t1_fdl3uh4,"My dog wasn't deaf, but for whatever reason she responded much better to hand signals than verbal commands."
JillStinkEye,fdlhnk6,t1_fdl3uh4,My daughter taught her dog both vocal and signs. For some reason the sit and stay signs work more consistently than the vocal commands.
claysonz,fdli8vx,t1_fdl3uh4,"Based on my limited knowledge of behavioral psychology, it seems that training with both auditory/visual cues at the same time could cause a dog to be confused and respond only to both, but not one or the other alone. Are you aware of this ever being an issue?"
exona,fdlip6a,t1_fdl3uh4,We went to dog training and they taught us to use both hand signals and vocal commands. I found my dog understands me much better with hand signals than vocal commands. (She's only 1 year old.)
NonStopKnits,fdlk2h1,t1_fdl3uh4,"My dad trained our dog with his own hand signals after he'd been trained for years, he just wanted to see if he could do it. It's all the same thing, as you said!"
timconradinc,fdl7x2x,t1_fdl6gg3,"Might consider touch training, too. It's usually done with deaf dogs, but seems like it could be useful if your parents take the dog in public and need to give her commands."

kmonsen,fdlbgts,t1_fdl6gg3,Most trainers actually train with hand signals first and then migrate to voice commands (since the dog can hear behind it but not see behind it).
Island_carapace,fdlj7nf,t1_fdl6gg3,I read somewhere that dogs follow physical cues like hand signals better than voice... wish I could find that article.
sabel418,fdljy2g,t1_fdl6gg3,"We didn't use ASL signals, but each of the vocal commands we give our dog also has a hand signal that goes along with it. When she was a puppy we added both in at the same time. She learned twice as fast as my other dog did when I trained her on vocal commands only. She's a fairly naughty dog and selectively listens to vocal commands only, but if we give her the hand signal she obeys 100% of the time. Good job on the training!"
nobjangler,fdlcb44,t1_fdl9hbc,"I think the reason for using ASL signs is that the person they are teach it for doesn't have to learn different signs.  It would be like meeting someone else's dog for the first time and knowing that the word ""sit"" will probably make them sit."
Enchelion,fdldckr,t1_fdl8p2b,"Same, we train our dogs with both. Two fingers up means sit, point down for lay, etc."

rich1051414,fdlikbp,t1_fdlcohe,"I taught my dog to sit by snapping my fingers totally by accident. I noticed I snap my fingers at the dog every time he tries to get in my face when I am busy, to which he will sit and stare at me until I am done. Then the other day I was snapping my fingers for something totally unrelated and he just stopped what he was doing, sat and looked at me. Turns out, he wasn't listening to me tell him to wait, but instead paying attention to the snapping fingers instead.

BTW, don't feel bad making your dog wait, they have orders of magnitude more patience than humans have. My rat terrier sat staring at a cabinet for 2 days straight once waiting for a mouse. We couldn't distract him no matter how hard we tried."

MrMushyagi,fdlkqnf,t1_fdlhwwh,"IMO it's wise to teach verbal commands and hand signals for a variety of reasons.

One major one is, if the dog lives long enough, it'll probably losing hearing and/or vision (hopefully not at the same time), so that way you can still give it commands when one sense goes."

dragonsroc,fdlhfpe,t1_fdlcb44,"There are generally agreed upon hand signals for training dogs that most trainers will use (or very similarly). It's basically already ASL for dogs. You don't even need to be very exact and dogs will understand it regardless.

For example, raising a fist or open hand palm up upwards typically means sit. Reverse it with palm down is lie down. Holding a hand out palm up is shake. A hand straight down palm away is touch. And there's many variations that are somewhat similar they'll get, especially if you just keep doing that."

1-0-9,fdnawkb,t1_fdn4qjs,"Labs and goldens are certainly incredibly smart, I would just personally look towards poodles and herding breeds as they have a certain way of begging you to teach them more tricks lol. My collie mix gets so excited during training, loves learning new tricks and LOVES performing them. He practically dances he can do each trick so quickly in succession. I've known quite a few collie mixes who are the same way, they crave education and are incredibly willing to please. It definitely depends on the owner's abilities though, I have an extremely high energy dog and he gets antsy loud and mischievous when he doesn't get a full days worth of physical exercise and mental stimulation. I am very strict with him. He THRIVES on that kind of structure. But labs and goldens are definitely great candidates for this kind of training too, but I haven't seen the kind of raw enthusiasm from them to practically be circus dogs like I see with poodle and herding mixes. GSDs are amazing but I firmly believe a lot of owners get in over their heads with them. I've met a lot of really bad GSD owners who have 0 control over their dog (mostly because they get up to like 130lbs) and they can be REALLY difficult to handle if you aren't a great trainer from the getgo. Although it varies from person to person, I'm sure there are first time dog owners who would do just fine with GSDs, but again I have met waaaaaay more GSDs with extreme behavioral issues and neurotic behavior than any other breeds"

LeaveTheMatrix,fdlju2q,t1_fdlikbp,"> they have orders of magnitude more patience than humans have

This is so true. 

I had a Pomeranian/chihuahua mix and she never really got along with our short short legged Jack Russell. One day they got into a fight bad enough that it tore what turned out to be a tumor in the Jack Russel and we took him to the vet where he had to be put down. 

A few days later someone gave us a long legged Jack Russell, orders of magnitude larger than the short legged one.  

From the Pomeranian point of view it must have looked like we took the small one away and brought him back bigger, because she sat with her nose in a corner for three days refusing to do anything.  

Eventually they managed to get along."

coinoperatedboi,fdlh3dz,t1_fdlgrdk,I've read that they look more at facial expressions in order to recognize you as well as interpret mood etc. I need to find the article.
CalmDebate,fdlnq6f,t1_fdlgrdk,"This is true, when people look at other people's faces we look at the right side first but only when looking at faces. This is believed to be how we read emotions as emotions begin on the right side of our faces. Dogs also exhibit this behavior, when looking at other dogs there is no bias but when looking at people's faces they had the same right side bias humans have.

This was from a great documentary we saw, I believe it was Dogs Decoded? But you can look up the research on it look up left gaze bias in dogs."

CebidaeForeplay,fdlnba3,t1_fdlgrdk,Well dogs coevolved with humans for a very long time. I wouldn't be surprised if even the dumbest dogs can easily recognize human facial expressions.
Catfish_Mudcat,fdlr8kf,t1_fdlgrdk,Reading facial expressions is one of the main differences between dogs & wolves.

Never met a dog that humans so well or just wants to make people happy (and get his belly rubbed lol). And the second he senses he’s winning you over with those big ole eyes of his he’s inching his way into your lap to snuggle, because pits know nothing of the concept of personal space lol."
itsmyfirsttime1,fdloktm,t1_fdlgrdk,Yes! This is so true. My dog Abby is basically deaf now. I never taught hand signals bc she’s a hearding dog and you use whistles. Yards away that’s the only way to communicate. But now at 13 she just looks at me and I know what she needs or what I need from her.

KuriousKhemicals,fdn82kn,t1_fdlgrdk,"One of the unique things about dogs compared to other pet animals is that if you point at something, they look where you're pointing instead of at your pointing finger.

DMCinDet,fdlnwhi,t1_fdlh3dz,"yep. we read theirs very easily too. also, Huskies dont have eyebrows and they show less facial expression  than most breeds. 

training a dog should be done with verbal and visual cues. the most important one is look at me. when the dog looks right at your face, they get the next cue much more frequently. start with a verbal and hand sign that means look at me and you will have much better success. 

source: reading things,  sister is long time dog trainer. her aging dogs communicate with hand signals easily, because it's been there all along."

I don't want to overload her with trying to teach her 5 different things at once"
whitedsepdivine,fdli3w3,t1_fdl9t8p,"Interesting.  I taught my dog hand commands.  I click my finger then make a one handed gesture and she responds.  I taught her in a day, but just using gestures and verbal commands together.  She now will respond instantly to hand commands, but it takes a few times with verbal.

Btw one handed gesture commands are awesome in public.  It seems like the dog knows how to be civil without me barking commands at her.  But really I'm telling her what to do with my hand covertly."

Itchycoo,fdljb4n,t1_fdl9t8p,"Yes! I've trained my dog using hand signals + verbal commands, and then both individually to reinforce it. Every time it takes my dog longer to learn the vocal cue than the hand gesture, and he does best when you use both."
Rawtashk,fdljzzg,t1_fdladui,"I would encourage you to stop teaching ""stay"" and just have down mean down and sit mean sit until you tell her otherwise.

Applejuiceinthehall,fdljv2m,t1_fdli3w3,I can only speculate but I think hand gestures are just more clear and consistent where vocal commands could sound very different to a dog if your tone is different and etc.

fourleafclover13,fdlnavj,t1_fdl3mny,You need to first find a breed that works for your family's lifestyle. Not one you like look of. Not saying this to be rude but to find the best dog take work and research. Then once you find the right breed then you work with a trainer that can temperament test to find dog that could become the service dog for you. Remember even once you find the dog it can till be washed. This and research the facility or trainer you are going to use.

Rev_Jim_lgnatowski,fdl67ds,t3_elxvtw,My experience has been that the paired hand signals usually worked even better than verbal commands with the dogs I've had. Pointing straight down has almost always gotten a quicker reaction for me than saying sit.
JohnnyStFartHugger,fdl75ft,t1_fdl67ds,"That's what I've noticed too! It's almost as if she prefers the hand signals over vocal. She's very quick to follow them as opposed to me just saying it. I don't mind one bit though! It works and it works well, that's what truly matters."
MJTree,fdlnrcs,t1_fdl75ft,Hand signals have much less variation than verbal commands so it’s easier for them to understand. Pretty much every training video I’ve seen has you start with luring into a behavior and rewarding and using a hand signal. Then slowly attaching a verbal command to that afterwards.
luxlilux,fdkynzq,t3_elxvtw,So wholesome
drunkdumbo,fdl4gv7,t3_elxvtw," So impressive!

I'm always curious why handlers at dog shows keep the treats in their own mouths. I Googled it before, but wasn't really satisfied with the results. OP, is there a purpose other than keeping your hand free?"
JohnnyStFartHugger,fdl5z88,t1_fdl4gv7,"I put the treat in my mouth because I sometimes drop it when I sign and she goes straight for it lol. But I think trainers put it into their mouths so that the dog is fixated on their face/eyes, not the treat in their hand"
tamiveldura,fdl4x0t,t1_fdl4gv7,Keeps hands free for signing but also allows you to drop your hands near the dog for correction without temping them with the treat.
log_base_pi,fdlndc2,t1_fdl4gv7,"There’s a subtle but important distinction between a reward and a bribe. If they can see it, it’s a bribe. and dogs “trained” with bribes will eventually perform only when they see a bribe."
Applejuiceinthehall,fdlae0k,t1_fdl5z88,"Try the it's yer choice game and combine with command for leave it. Leave it and come recalls can be life saving commands. I used it when my dog has found scorpion and snakes, but also dirty diapers!"
Itchycoo,fdljnps,t1_fdl4x0t,Makes sense I guess. But also you have to taste dog food lol. That's a deal breaker for me.
alamuki,fdlygrm,t1_fdlae0k,"I love the leave it command and my dogs are pretty good with it.  But when they’re not, it’s always gonna be something that smells atrocious. 

The worst, by far, was when I saw him happily rolling in what looked like the remains of a tattered soccer ball.  Turned out to desiccated armadillo.  Urgh."
tamiveldura,fdln0b5,t1_fdljnps,That's why I've got a little hip pouch. It has a spring opening so it'll stay closed or stay open with one finger.
championgecko,fdmiaz7,t1_fdljnps,I've always been of the mind if I'd feed it to my dog I should at least be willing to taste it
Applejuiceinthehall,fdm2yml,t1_fdlygrm,Armadillo carry leprosy so that is gross.
Itchycoo,fdml2wq,t1_fdmiaz7,"I get the sentiment, but I really don't think that logic makes sense. Dogs and humans have different food tolerances and different digestive tracts. That's why dogs can eat raw meat with a much smaller risk of getting sick than humans. Like it's generally safe to feed a dog raw chicken, because there's a relatively low chance of getting infected with salmonella. If you eat raw chicken, your risk of getting salmonella is much higher.

And unless you're buying human-grade dog food and treats, those are also not safe for human consumption. But (reputable brands) are safe for dogs. Different digestive systems, different tolerances."
Marcia_Shady,fdl85k1,t3_elxvtw,That floppy ear  (ﾉ´∀｀*)
Comrade_Lilyface,fdl6lqh,t3_elxvtw,"I don't know ASL, and as such my dog doesn't follow ASL commands, but he does know non-verbal/ hand cues that we just kinda made up for sit/shake/wait/stay/down as well as a cue to release from a wait/stay"
JohnnyStFartHugger,fdl7iey,t1_fdl6lqh,"That's good! As long as they understand what the signal means then that's amazing! I chose to use ASL signs just to make it simpler for my parents to know what to sign. I could have made her sign for sit just a balled fist or pointing down, but using the actual sign for sit was the simpler route for myself and my parents."
Comrade_Lilyface,fdl8tn0,t1_fdl7iey,"That's awesome!  I love that you made it easier for your parents to communicate with your pupper.  My dog isnt terribly well trained, but he listens to me better than my parents and it's definitely something I'd like to work on changing, especially since my parents watch him for me when I need someone to look after him.  

In our case it's not a like a communication problem , it's just my pup getting more comfortable with the commands, and understanding that the same rules apply when my parents give commands as when I do.  That and maybe a little gentle ""training"" of my parents on how to communicate best with the dog.  (They haven't had dogs most of their lives, and while they like them the energy and naughtiness can be a bit much for them)"

JohnnyStFartHugger,fdlao7s,t1_fdl9j1o,"They were! I surprised them with this on Christmas Eve and my dad actually cried a bit because he didn't expect her to know sign. He was so proud and happy, he kept signing to her and she kept watching him and following each sign.

When I brought her by early December my dad tried getting her to sit and lay down but she would just ignore him because he can't really speak to her. So I did this with them in mind so that my parents could interact with her just as much as I can."
Pandantic,fdm3v5z,t1_fdlao7s,Ok this made me tear up a bit. So sweet!!

Cooper1977,fdlbmc6,t3_elxvtw,"I have a deaf dog and he's been the best companion I could ask for for the past 3 years, he took to a bunch of ""home made"" signs, none of it's ASL but he knows what I want him to do, it did take training and patience but it's so worthwhile. The only thing I'll warn other people about is don't teach your dog 2 handed signs. You're always going to be carrying something or holding something and then struggle to do a 2 handed sign at the same time."
TheNorthComesWithMe,fdlhfml,t1_fdlbmc6,ASL signs are cute but also pretty impractical. Signs you can do one handed are much more practical.
cbunni666,fdlelah,t3_elxvtw,Awesome. I feel it should be mandatory in school to learn ASL. You'd be surprised how many people are deaf and/or mute.
JohnnyStFartHugger,fdlesdc,t1_fdlelah,"So true. In Canada, French is mandatory from grade 3-10, I think if not mandatory, it should be an optional course in highschool"
DinoRaawr,fdlotes,t1_fdlelah,"Man I've been teaching myself ASL for a few months now, and I've never even seen a deaf person in real life. But one day I'm gonna bust it out and impress the fuck out of whatever random deaf stranger I ran into"
fte2514,fdlqjtj,t1_fdlelah,"I wanted to take it in college but the class was in such high demand you needed a special reason to take it. They gave priority to education majors specializing in special needs. I was only able to take a one credit ""Signed English"". I'd love to become fluent in it, just to help out random people in stores and stuff

My Spanish was good enough at one time to converse with someone who was a native Spanish speaker with limited English skills. Unfortunately it's harder to do this with ASL."
cbunni666,fdlgbxk,t1_fdlesdc,"I agree. I wish I had that option in school. It was either Spanish, French or Latin. 2 years I'll never get back."

Girl_speaks_geek,fdlda42,t3_elxvtw,"I train my dog with verbal and hand signals, not that anyone I know is hearing impaired but I think it's helpful for if he ever goes deaf from old age or anything. Plus, sometimes he responds to the visual cues much better than the verbal ones."
Dilophosauru5,fdmsbct,t1_fdlda42,This is such an important thing to do in my opinion. I had two dogs (siblings) who lost their hearing in their old age. We had taught hand cues alongside verbal cues more for fun than anything else when they were younger but it was invaluable when they both lost their hearing.

I volunteered at a shelter a while back. Someone brought their huge American Bulldog in and I noticed he didn't react to the other dogs barking so I clapped my hands near him but out of view, and nothing.

It turns out he was deaf and no one knew it. On his relinquishment form his owners just wrote, ""My dog don't listen.""

I had the honor of training him in ASL and he was eventually adopted by a retired sheriff. Happy ending."

MissKaceyKnits,fdltsiw,t3_elxvtw,We taught our lab ASL but only because the hand interactions reinforced our commands. Our dog can more easily distinguish what we’re asking this way. On a side note we do have a deaf cat (from birth) and training her with ASL has worked amazingly. We even taught our baby this way and he picked up on it quicker then verbal language. A lot less tantrums cause we understood him quicker.

The new queen goes in a little container with vents and a candy plug and is put in the hive. She will eat the candy from one side and the workers will eat from the other. By the time the plug is gone the old queens pheromones will have been replaced with the new queens, and away you go.

If you just remove the queen the workers will detect there is no queen in the hive and will then work to turn one of the babies into a new queen. As long as you have larva under 3 days old youre ok. Of course if you do this you will get genetics similar to the old queen, so they are likely to be poor temprement. It takes about 16 days for a larva to become a queen."

What Ive learned is, always pick from where you know there has been no pesticides used. Wash the roots, dry them for a few days. Break them up into pieces and then toast them in the oven... Toasting time can really change the flavor! Sometimes Ill toast them just a little, and other times Ill wait till it almost smells like some wood is burning. I HATE coffee but LOVE this root.

My mother prides herself on her garden, which has won multiple prizes in my hometown, and she had most of the lawn taken out a few years back in favor of a huge diverse shrub and tree garden with a path of grass moving through it.

It's real win-win: bees (and other insects) are happy, it's very relaxing to see hundreds of them doing their business, the lawn looks nicely colorful and finally, there's less area that needs mowing.

Dandelions spread like wild fire and as a hard, deep rooting species you've either got to dig them out (difficult for the old/disabled) or treat them with weed killer. It shouldn't come as much of a surprise but most people chose the bottle of easy solutions over the tub of elbow grease and there is growing evidence that modern glyphosphates are messing up the bees so while you might be helping you are likely forcing the rest of the street into poor practices."

He lived in a family holler (basically a stretch of land that has multiple properties that are all family owned) and my great aunt had a large field/meadow that grew clover like crazy when the grass got long. My dad’s bees would harvest that clover and it made the best honey I’ve ever had. One day, we were driving back from town and as we passed my aunt’s field, we saw that she was cutting the grass but also the clover. My dad stopped the truck with a horrified expression on his face and just whispered, “clover killer.” Every time we would see her cutting the grass after that he would just shake his head and say, “There goes the damn clover killer again.”"

The upkeep is signifigantly lower now, although you don't have the conveniance of a lawn mower.  Its on a corner lot too so it wraps around the front of the house and looks great. All of them are drought resistant and you pretty much give a quick water once a week or so in the summer time. It was funny though because they had to cut one of their really pretty bushes near a tree because a lady complained that she couldn't see across the lot through the corner since the bush was there..."

RicketyTicketyTock,fdi1up6,t3_elhjpf,"I've been playing music for 22 years, I started when I was 6 years old... this is something that really fills me with joy. Music has been a **huge** part of my life because of how early I started playing, I believe that music is the language of the universe. I love to see her starting her love of music so early in her life. You take that violin and you learn it and you cherish every moment you have with it! An instrument can change a life and put someone on a path of beautiful artistic expression.

My music teacher once told me this, and I hope it resonates with you as much as it did with me, she said ""Music is sounds in search of an instrument of inspiration."" remember that, you don't create the music, you have a beautiful ability to interpret the music so that others can hear it, it's all around us, you get to be its interpreter."
Banama0302,fdi633a,t1_fdi1up6,Wow. What a message. Thank you so much for sharing that story. We are a huge musical family and hope they keep the love just as we did... and do. May I use the quote from your music teacher?
badken,fdihui1,t1_fdi1up6,"It's really weird to read that sentiment because I always felt that way whenever I played an instrument. It's hard to describe to someone who has never done it. The way I always described it was that I never really felt like I was playing music, it was more like the music was playing me. I know that sounds really corny but it's true.

 I wrote and arranged a few pieces when I was younger and I felt the same way about writing music. I never felt like I was creating it, more like I was just putting down what was already there, but only I could hear it.

Sadly, when it came time for college, my parents talked me out of pursuing a music degree, convincing me that more practical studies would be better for me. Now I am nearly 60, and I often wonder about the path not taken. My mother tells me now that not encouraging me to study music was one of her greatest regrets. Over the years she has heard so much music that sounds like what I used to do just noodling around on the piano.

No regrets for me, though, I had a very rewarding tech career."
MsAuroraRose,fdie3ok,t1_fdi1up6,">it's all around us

that reminds me of the movie August Rush.  I don't know many people who have seen it or like it though

edit:  there's literally dozens of us lol  no but seriously, what u/RicketyTicketyTock said is beautiful.  I started piano when I was 5 & played regularly until I was in my early 20s.  Also sang a lot in middle/high school & college in various types of choirs and groups.  Music makes me emotional in a way I can't describe sometimes.  It collects my memories with its melodies & plays them back to me years later.  I wish I'd gone professional with music so I could do it every day but now I just search for music that speaks to my soul."

NormanNormalman,fdijb27,t1_fdi4kbl,"I started playing viola in fifth grade. My family was really poor growing up, so we applied for a scholarship to get a loaner instrument I could use in school. My school offered classes, but my family couldn't afford private lessons so I learned just in orchestra class. 

The year I turned twelve my parents got me braces. Like I said, we were church mice poor, so braces was a Big Fucking Deal. I was pretty aware of our financial state, so thought christmas would be pretty tight. It was tight. But I still remember bawling my eyes out, much like this girl, when I opened my viola for the very first time christmas morning. They bought a full size so I could grow into it, and it was too big for me when I got it. But that viola remains one of my favorite instruments. 

Now I fiddle in a string band and own multiple violins, violas, electric violins, drums, banjos, and guitars. My parents did me solid, that's for sure."
remotecontroldr,fdi5c2w,t1_fdi4kbl,"Mine might not be that exciting, but as a kid I had a rent-to-own flute.

But once it was paid off my Mom let me upgrade to a new flute that was a better model. I would have been perfectly happy keeping the rent-to-own flute so it was really big for me to get the upgrade."

GingerMau,fdieb3n,t1_fdi8znr,Many schools are replacing the recorder with the ukulele now. They are nearly as cheap and serve the same purpose.
palabradot,fdif3bl,t1_fdidv4z,"ahahah I went from first section clarinet to \*bassoon\*.

The neighborhood dogs got a lot of howling in at those godforsaken squeaks."
Ananasmachmamanass,fdieic1,t1_fdic9w5,"You want to know why I love violins? Violins are completely self-made instrument. So many other Instruments are based in nostalgic childrens shows, funny faces, relatable situations, or references. Not violin. Violin is completely absurd. It's a wood instrument with a bow, and an arbitrary method for playing it. The first person to ever play violin did not do so out of recognition. The first person to ever play violin did not do so because a pre-existing Instrument format. The first person to ever play violin literally pulled from the ether by sheer human creativity and willpower. Violin is evidence that humans can stare into the meaningless void of eternity and force their own meaning onto to it. I will always upvote violin, o shit waddup!"
lonelyinbama,fdihcgu,t1_fdic9w5,Not even my story and I felt it
plsHelpmemes,fdidcwc,t1_fdicty7,I usually practice (violin) with a mute on and it's not that audible. You can probably use it with an electric instrument to lower the sound further
mazi710,fdieguv,t1_fdieb3n,"Idk man, in my school the kids that sucked got to play triangle, shaker eggs, tamburine, or the two little sticks you hit together. That got boring so fast they didn't wanna practice."
gorbachevshammer,fdih8tg,t1_fdieb3n,"As shitty as they are, I think recorder is a better stepping stone to theory and actually learning music. 

It's kind of like how one of the best things a budding guitarist can do is learn to play piano"
Isord,fdihvsn,t1_fdieic1,"You mind find it interesting that it is believe that bowed instruments originated with nomadic people of central asia who would have had the bow as an essential tool for hunting and warfare. The word for the bridge in some languages is actually ""horse"" and the Chinese reference receiving bowed intruments from ""barbarians"" to the West. 

So it's very likely someone was fucking around with a hunting bow and rubbed it against a stringed instrument or maybe another bow and realized it made interesting sounds. I'd like to imagine they were just drunk and having fun but that is my own twist lol."
Garydrgn,fdif472,t1_fdieic1,Poetic as fuck! Have an upvote.
knewbie_one,fdido7x,t1_fdidcwc,"Thank you

Going to take a (free) course first... if my fingertips don't bleed after the first hour I'll give it a go"
plsHelpmemes,fdie48p,t1_fdido7x,"If your fingertips really hurt, take your instrument to a luthier and ask them to take a look at it. An incorrectly set up instrument can have a bridge that's too high and seriously hurt to play, especially the cheap instruments. I had a friend who complained about finger pains until he showed me his cheap Amazon violin and I noticed how the bridge was way higher than it should have been, and he was pressing much harder on the strings than he should have needed to.

Good luck learning the cello!"
remotecontroldr,fdi4zzf,t3_elhjpf,"I know it’s such a small part of the video, but I love how the Dad helps her by saying, “stop, figure out why it’s not coming out.” It was just such a gentle way to help her handle the situation when she was overcome with emotion. Beautiful video, got some real tears trickling down my cheeks now."

ZPhox,fdi5yog,t3_elhjpf,"I wanted one as a kid, but my parents just scoffed at the idea of a musical instrument saying ""you'll never play it"". I ended up getting my own through my paper route and never played in front of my parents until 2 years later.  They cried and didn't even remember that they denied me this as a gift in the past. That hurt!

Thank you to OP's parents for listening to your kids and supporting her creativity. This video made me cry and instantly go back to the past.... Now to explain why my eyes are red to my co workers haha!"
whatever9_,fdi4lyl,t3_elhjpf,I hope her parents save this video and play it for her on her philharmonic debut. What a sweet moment.

LycanWolfGamer,fdi5ske,t1_fdhylz3,The sound of a violin can really change a song with electric guitars so omg the sound is honestly amazing - Skillet did a song and I love it due to the violin

I listen to both btw"
Bloomski76,fdii9td,t1_fdida7j,Isn’t skillet a band?
lydf,fdikf26,t1_fdii9td,No idea. Realistically it’s more likely a band called skillet has a song with any recognizable violin than anything by skrillex. I’m probably just wrong lol oh well.
themikebrennan,fdi7kjp,t3_elhjpf,"My parent's got me an acoustic guitar one year.  I wanted one forever.  The case was inside a big box and I was so excited once I saw the case.  The case had a blow up electric guitar inside it.  I.  Was.  Pissed.  

20-30mins later, my dad came out with the real acoustic guitar.
They always had fun like that at Christmas, but that one was over the top."

Olethros842,fdi3lwj,t3_elhjpf,I’m legit crying RN. I wanted a violin as a kid so bad but we could never afford one or to give me classes. Fills my heart to see another girl get one I am so happy she gets to learn and play. Such a wonderful instrument.
hazeldazeI,fdienhx,t1_fdi3lwj,"you're still a kid ya know, just a kid that has more resources.  Get your violin and bring up the old youtubes and start practicing!"
Olethros842,fdij3j0,t1_fdienhx,I thought about it but I figured learning Bass guitar would be easier as an adult so I went that route. I appreciate the support though! I love learning and instruments. Maybe once I’ve got the Bass down I’ll try the violin
hazeldazeI,fdijd51,t1_fdij3j0,awesome!
tysontysontyson1,fdi1g11,t3_elhjpf,I don’t know what I like more. Her amazing reaction or the fact that a 9 year old wants a violin as a gift in this day and age.
clumsyc,fdiduva,t1_fdi1g11,I was also a big fan of her pragmatic sister tidying up the wrapping paper.
carbonhomunculus,fdi4l4g,t1_fdi1g11,My little brother got one a few years ago. 10 year old practiced and practiced and now he's actually making really good money for a 13 year old street performing
LycanWolfGamer,fdi5kni,t1_fdi1g11,"I was the same tbh didn't know it was a violin until she started moving it around and I put 2 and 2 together I was both surprised and glad that children nowadays still want stuff like that

It's also on the part of the parent's as well"
Taxtro1,fdiis2e,t1_fdi1g11,"**in this day and age**???

Was there a better age for violins that I missed?"
hellogawgous,fdianon,t1_fdi1g11,I started viola when I was 9. But I just rented until high school my parents bought me one since they knew I would stick with it.
Atypicalwomaninia,fdijxdk,t1_fdiduva,Yes!  Very sweet gesture!
gswkillinit,fdif58y,t1_fdi5kni,I haven't played my violin since elementary school and i'm 25 now. So it's been a good 15 years since I held one. I'm surprised I was able to guess it right from just looking at the box. Anyways this is definitely wholesome. I'm sure the parents are glad she wanted something that wasn't a phone.
ON_A_POWERPLAY,fdib1pp,t3_elhjpf,"I started on a violin like this. It was a cheap 100 violin that I played for a few years and oh my GOD was I ecstatic to get it. I still remember them surprising me with it a few months into the school year. It was funny becuse my grandma payed for it and evey time we went to visit her you bet your ass I had to play for her! Used to make me so nervous! 

I went on to play throughout middle school. While I was in high school I joined the band and played a bunch of instruments for fun and made a shit ton of just great friends. I also picked up guitar and bass. In college, I played in one of the orchestras for fun as a non music major and learned a whole goddamn lot. 

Rambling aside, I was never a prodigy, never first chair, don't do it professionally now, never went to juliard, but music has made a substantial impact on my life and is still a deep part of who I am today. I ended up switching to Viola after I left college orchestra to focus on my major and now that I'm older I've really gone back to the guitar to try and pay it the same attention I did when I was learning violin. Music never left my life growing up and I can't see my life without music.

Music and the ability to create music is such a beautiful thing and I'm so happy to see you supporting your daughters desire to play."
TootsNYC,fdikzro,t3_elhjpf,"When I was 14 or so, the only thing I wanted for Christmas was a guitar. 

And my mom got me convinced I wasn't going to receive it, that they couldn't afford it. Enter Regal trading stamps. 

I was about that overwhelmed on Christmas morning.

It opened a lifetime of music for me; I still have that guitar, and I still play it. 

&#x200B;

I hope the same for your daughter."
agnurse,fdi06zu,t3_elhjpf,A musical instrument is something that will never be a waste of money. I come from a family of musicians and am a pianist myself.

NefariousSerendipity,fdihpc7,t1_fdi06zu,"noone in my fam knew of a musical instrument.

Taney34,fdidk2t,t3_elhjpf,"What a beautiful gift! Both my husband and son play the violin; my husband has been playing for 40 years and is highly accomplished. There were times when we didn’t have two nickels to rub together and the only asset we had was his violin. We considered selling it but my husband cried and said, “you might as well cut off my right arm.”  I hope your daughter sticks with it; my favorite memories are my husband and son playing together, either as stand partners in an orchestra performance or as a duet for charity. Making music is a true life skill that brings people together."
kingqueefsalot,fdik5jc,t3_elhjpf,"As someone who only got gifts of things my parents wanted me to be interested in, this really made me cry. I still made sure to appreciate them as they were gifts, but it really crushed my soul when my parents completely ignored my interests and only got me things they felt I should be interested in.  

I don't know you but to me it seems your daughter has been feeling a lot lately, and this loving gesture from the people closest to her was everything she needed in more ways than we can ever imagine. 

Wishing you the best to you and your family. Looks like you have a good one!"

You reminded of my first instrument. I’m a percussionist.  When I was in 7th grade my family scraped everything they could together (grandparents, parents, aunts, uncles, etc.) and got a Slingerland drum set. I still have that thing 31 years later.

Just as a side note, while she’s only starting it would do both herself and her current/future violins a lot of good to learn how to properly handle the violin in and outside of the case! My mother has had a few of her students come to her absolutely heartbroken after damaging the bow or the violin itself after not handling them properly and it would be devastating for it to happen here.

As a music teacher, I have seen many students get very frustrated and quit playing with this brand of instrument (and parents, when they inevitably break... and repair shops will not work on them). If money is tight, try to find a cheap used instrument that is a reputable brand. Mendini is really, really, REALLY low quality. But it is cool that they make different colors :)"
FinnishFiddler,fdikrdx,t1_fdida76,"Seconding this. I've played violin for years, and recently got this brand instrument to try out the viola. After upgrading the strings I can make it work, and it's tolerable to play for practicing at home.

But as soon as I saw ""Cecilio"" my heart sank and I only watched to the end to find out what color it was going to be. Please, if she really loves to play, please please please buy her a real violin from a real violin shop and not online. This violin will give her nothing but trouble from day 1. By the time you pay to get the problems with this fiddle fixed you might as well have dropped the money on a proper one. Also, the advice to use chalk on the pegs is bad advice. The pegs are already made of a too-soft white wood stained black and not real ebony. The chalk might help in the moment, but it will ultimately make the problem worse, and quickly. 

I'm sorry to be such a debbie downer, but I have seen too many of these violins in my time, and they are never worth it."

I was in 4th grade when my parents gave me my first musical instrument.  It took me down a path I would not give up for anything.

My sophomore year of high school I was given a new sax for Christmas.  It was used, but very good quality.  My dad had bought it from a friend.  I cried like a baby.  25 years later and I still have it.  I hope to dust it off someday or I will donate it to my high school band program."

lilredal,fdijvap,t3_elhjpf,"That is awesome!  Her joy at just receiving the gift made me smile then when I realized it was a violin it was even better!

I played for 12 years and it really is a wonderful instrument!  I hope it brings her as much joy and happiness as the day she received it!

If you all are close to Cincinnati and she needs lessons I’d be more than happy to help get her started!"

Tekaginator,fdikj3d,t3_elhjpf,"An instrument is a beautiful gift; it provides a canvas of skill that they can improve on their entire life.

TchaikenNugget,fdiir12,t3_elhjpf,"Hi, violinist here! I'm so happy to see your daughter absolutely in love with the instrument; it'll definitely bring her a lot of joy in the years to come! I'd highly recommend getting her private lessons with a teacher and a few years later, looking into youth orchestras for her to join once the teacher thinks she's up to it. They're a great way to make friends and learn how to play in an ensemble!"
SCWickedHam,fdiiylp,t3_elhjpf,"I wonder if they tracked kids that act like this as children if they continue to be appreciative, sweet people."

floridagurl08,fdik8t6,t3_elhjpf,My son started on his instrument around the same age. Pursuing a degree in performance in college. There was never a serious back up plan. It's just who he is. They are lucky to find themselves at such a young age. Sometimes I feel like I'm still looking.......

IceNein,fdik2ye,t3_elhjpf,"Learning any musical instrument is a super useful skill to have.  The great thing is that much of what you learn on one instrument will be translatable to other instruments.  This is especially true in categories of instruments, strings, brass, woodwinds, etc.

If anybody has kids who talk about wanting to learn an instrument, it is so much easier to learn young.  Don't wait to see if they outgrow it.  There are lots of stores that will rent you student instruments, if your school doesn't have any available."

BruteandTheBasilisk,fdiem4w,t3_elhjpf,Every child deserves to play an instrument but I hope this doesn't turn her off from playing. Mendini can barely be called instruments.  The strings will break quickly and it will barely be playable.  I hope she's not turned off from trying to tune it. Possibly look into buying a used student violin from a reputable dealer or leasing.

I saw a wrapped present under the tree and instantly knew it was the psx and the little gift was ff7. I cried so hard. I didn't think I was going to get it because we were so poor. I had emotionally prepared myself to be happy for my cousin, who was definitely getting a psx and ff7 for Christmas from his parents. I told myself I couldn't be jealous, only happy for him. I was so thankful. I think it's wonderful how much the kid in the video appreciates the present."

NoBSforGma,fdnkg3x,t3_em93ia,"If you want to see wild birds do this, you can set up a slow water ""drip"" in your yard.  Make sure there is some ""cover"" - like shrubs or tall grasses.  They don't like coming if it's in the open.  (Hawks....)  I managed to find a huge rock with a hollow space that was perfect.  You will need to use something as a ""bathtub"" - look at the cupped hands in the video for idea of size.   I ran the hose over to it and suspended it from a low-hanging branch on a small tree then turn on the water just so it would drip.  Birds will hear that and come to it, especially if it is during a dry time.  (Yes, turn it off in the winter.)  This way, I got to see a lot of birds that you don't normally see at feeders, including warblers."

Pause the vid after the bird moves off her forearm and you can see it took a dump on her... Normal stuff if you have em but most people who don't kinda freak about getting even small bird shit on them, most likely why she didn't flinch or clean it off. Nothing new.

Edit: To those trying to defend breeding dachshunds, I’ll just insert a comment I made below here.


I’m not seeing the justification for breeding dachshunds here. They are prone to spinal problems because of their long spinal column and short rib cage as well as dislodged kneecaps which makes it more difficult for them to jump and exercise and leads to chronic pain that needs long term treatment or surgery. They are also 2.5 times more likely than other breeds of dogs to develop a congenital heart defect. Some of them even end up with brittle bone disease and vision/hearing complications.

There’s a whole other list of complications they have that I’m not even going to get into. I don’t see how that’s different from munchkin cats. They’re not being bred to hunt pests anymore, people get them because they like the way they look."

>Most Munchkin cats have skeletal abnormalities because of gene mutation, according to Britain’s Governing Council of the Cat Fancy, a cat registry organization. The Council strongly discourages people from breeding the cats as their genes are considered damaging to the offspring’s health and welfare. It also refuses to recognize the Munchkin and Scottish Fold as breeds.

https://www.catster.com/lifestyle/cat-health-tips-facts-about-dwarfism-in-cats

>According to breed research by Sarah Hartwell, Munchkins probably suffer from a genetic defect called pseudoachondroplasia; they have short legs but normally proportioned heads


>Outside the U.S., dwarf cat breeds are not widely accepted. In fact, some registries prohibit those breeds as an unacceptable mutation of “genetic disease.”


>munchkins are particularly prone to arthritis, because of the stress of the body’s weight on their shortened limbs


>Keep in mind, too, that dwarfism can be very painful for your cat, so make sure you work with your vet to devise an adequate pain control regimen so she’ll have a good quality of life.


https://www.purina.co.uk/cats/cat-breeds/library/munchkin

>The short leggedness of this breed is a deformity that is linked to bone and spinal problems, so it has not been welcomed by all cat associations.


>Munchkin cats may not have the flexibility to groom themselves as well as other cats do, so will need some assistance. 

All of the information above was found on a 5 minutes research max, and it's quite a big list as you might see.

Most need to be put on a regimen of pain killers to even live, and aren't even capable of grooming themselves properly. They're just as bad as Scottish Folds, and some breeders are even trying out Scottish Munchkins, wich would be even worse for them.

Munchkins were originally popularized in Hong Kong because most people live in small apartments and it's easier to keep everything in place when your cat can't jump high enough to reach counters/shelves."

>The sad thing is, like with dog breeds how do we stop this.

That's the problem, it's not even a breed, it's a genetic mutation. So breeding them with ""normal"" cats won't solve it, we'd need to stop them from breeding at all! Munchkins can't even breed with each other, cause the babies don't survive.

I dropped a deposit immediately. Going to have her joints and eyes checked before I decide whether to have her spayed after she is full grown or wait to get a litter out of her. 

For large breeds, a good breeder will always disclose how the parents' joints are at least, and all good breeders of any dog should get eyes checked on parents."

PickleInDaButt,fdxhueh,t1_fdwod24,"My puppy got aspiration pneumonia the day we got her because she also had kennel cough. Within an hour of bringing her home, she was at the emergency vet getting oxygen treatment. This poor little 8 week pup was sitting in a tank wrapped in blankets and trying to survive. It was the worst. Just the cost of the treatment and having to see if she would improve was heartbreaking.

That was five months ago and she survived. She is now mad at me because I just gave her a bath."
ladykatey,fdxckkk,t1_fdwod24,One problem I see here is you can’t monitor how much each individual eats.
starrynezz,fdx85ht,t1_fdwod24,"It looks awesome but there are a few things that concern me about using them with foster kittens. I wonder how one would keep the unit sanitized inside the nipples because it looks like all one piece. You also have to keep the milk between 95-100 degrees fahrenheit though I suppose you can warm the silicone up before putting the milk in so that it doesn't draw away heat from the milk. My biggest concern though is the kittens sucking in air bubbles once the milk gets too low.   


I really want to try out this other unit called the Suro-Kitty  but its rather expensive for me (i'm on a fixed income). It uses the Miracle Nipple style of nipple that can be removed and it also has an internal heater to keep the milk at a constant temperature. Its in the shape of a cat as well so kittens can knead on the unit while feeding.  [http://www.wholefulpet.com/product/surro-kitty-mini/](http://www.wholefulpet.com/product/surro-kitty-mini/)"

EDIT: Just saw someone else mentioned this already, never mind."
roofuskit,fdxqog7,t1_fdwod24,I'm guessing this is home made considering the support structure is clearly 3D printed. The silicone part also looks like it was molded at home.
Theamazingjuan,fdymg7z,t1_fdwod24,The maker is in France. Google “nourrinou bibi” you should be able to find them.
the-greenest-thumb,fe06i56,t1_fdwod24,"When my mum was fostering kittens her hands were getting shredded from all the little claws kneading on her every feeding. So she made a sort of ""belly"" to protect her hands and give the feeling of kneading on mum cats belly to the kittens. She cut an oval out of cardboard and glued fun fur to it, and in the center was a hole fitted to the bottle. It went around the neck of the bottle and the nipple was then placed which kept the ""belly"" in place. The were sturdy and easy to wipe clean or just make new ones and kept both human and kittens happy."
kingkumquat,fdxw5ko,t1_fdwod24,"I found information on where to order these. From the website:

“Bibi The Nourrinou-bibi is a new feeding bottle concept, made of 100% medical silicone.

Designed for weaning kittens and puppies, there are 5 models (small, medium, large, L and XL). It alws, among other things, to relieve and help the mother in case of long litters and to save a lot of time compared to the use of a conventional baby bottle.

Nourrinou-bibi replaces the classic baby feeding bottle and keeps babies in a natural feeding position and limit false milk roads.”

From a comment further down"
Farnswirth,fdxsvow,t1_fdx0ptg,Yeah it's pretty easy. You just need to 3d print a mold and then cast it with food grade silicone. Try the 3d printing subreddit.
BattleHall,fe2t0aq,t1_fdx0ptg,"I think rather than doing a single piece like this, it’s probably be better to get some puppy nursing nipples. They sell them commercially, they can be slipped over the end of irrigation syringes (so you can measure individually how much they are eating), or they can fit in holes drilled in just about any container or small commercial feeder.

I enjoyed every single group and did that for a number of year but where we really shined and our official title is The Socializers. I work from home so they didn’t get much time where I wasn’t here and got use to me.  And my daughter was very good with them and brought rounds of friends over to interact with kitties, they spent a ton of time holding and petting them. And I usually had some neighbors come over and do the same when word got out I had more kittens. It is pretty dang rewarding when we would take them back the shelter and the techs would say “ut-oh it’s Cersie” and kinda bunker down for a challenge.  During the exam, they’d look at me “is this the same cat?”   So now we get the all the little hissers and beezy’s. But at least I don’t have to get up every 2-3 hours for the babies."

“Bibi
The Nourrinou-bibi is a new feeding bottle concept, made of 100% medical silicone.

Designed for weaning kittens and puppies, there are 5 models (small, medium, large, L and XL).
It allows, among other things, to relieve and help the mother in case of long litters and to save a lot of time compared to the use of a conventional baby bottle.

Nourrinou-bibi replaces the classic baby feeding bottle and keeps babies in a natural feeding position and limit false milk roads.”

Responsible dog breeders are great though. Potential pet owners should be able to research which breed suits their lifestyle and find a breeder that offers that without being shamed for not adopting. Some pet adoptions go really well, but in many cases your adopting a basket-case from their previous owner’s negligence. Starting off with a puppy from a breeder in the breed of your choice allows you a clean slate to train and discipline your dog in a way that is optimal for all involved.

For those that do rescue, you’re doing a really great thing and I don’t mean at all to say otherwise."
Maharajison,fdy300j,t1_fdy2dm2,"Adopting isn’t for everyone. Those who do adopt their pets don’t need to be told how great of a thing they’re doing, it’s seriously awesome, but no pet owner should be shamed for buying from a breeder because they want a fresh start with the breed of their choice.

This logic doesn’t hold. One could decide either to get a puppy from a breeder or just not get a dog until what they’re after becomes available. It’s not like “well fuck, couldn’t find a chow-chow from a good breeder, guess I’ll just go pick up something from a shelter.”"

peperere,fdx0hsl,t1_fdw6ndl,Only one suggestion. Add a cap!
shaidycakes,fdx8r94,t1_fdw6ndl,I'm enjoying their reflex to push other puppies away from their teet. Their legs are constantly going stay away my milk!
EasyThereOldTimer,fdxzdoz,t1_fdw6ndl,"So my 3 year old dog got taken away from his mom too early (at least that’s what the shelter said when I got him) and his adult ass still sucks on my arm before bedtime or if he’s trying to get comfy.  It’s really cute but people who met him for the first time get this treatment too and they are weirded out until they decide that it’s cute.  He also weighs 6 pounds so that helps, too."
mrsbebe,fdxpe75,t1_fdx0hsl,Someone else pointed out that since it’s rubber (or something) that the lid could cause a vacuum which would make it hard for the puppies to suck. But I’m sure there’s a work around for that!
Liam9290,fdx1b2p,t1_fdx0hsl,Of course
syaien,fdxb01r,t1_fdx8r94,Its actually a kneading motion to help milk flow. Same thing cats do.
husbandbulges,fdxqknw,t1_fdxpe75,You’d also have to keep opening to see when it is empty.

She gets this mad look aswell before she grabs me with her mani-knives
Pink-Tummy,fdmyb5i,t1_fdmxmwb,"The ""mad look"" means kitty is understimulated.
Generally the best way is play them tired before they get like that, other ways is to let them outside more. You learn as you go but avoid playing using hands and if they still get in the mood of fighting spray them with a waterbottle or grab by neck skin like a mother cat and lift with other hand under butt and put them in a seperate room with a door for a bit (maybe 30 minutes) to let them cool down, they should snap out of it.

But generally playing is best, also catnip and similar by learning experience has the opposite effect and if your purpose of playing with the kitty is to calm them down, avoid it."

mateodelnorte,fdnd30t,t3_em6j43,"Awe. Teach them to love. 

My favorite cat, who I will forever miss, was the most rambunctious pet I've ever owned. Friends thought he was a wild animal. He'd bite and scratch the living hell out of your hands and tackle your ankles. My mother never reprimanded him. When she passed and I took him as my pet, I treated him like a teenage child. I would reprimand him, literally pointing my finger at his face and sternly saying ""No!"" when he did things that were hurtful to me or others. He'd pop his ears back and meow a sound that was pretty clear he didn't like being pointed at that way. He definitely understood it was a gesture based discussion of right and wrong. When he behaved well, I showed him my love and adoration. His name was Meow Ming and he grew into the most loving, intelligent, charismatic cat I may ever own. I miss him dearly."

The direction of the wind will influence the carrot’s positioning, but it’s probably not going to point it at the ground unless the wind is flowing toward the ground. The wind itself would be knocking the carrot every which way, which should help lower the terminal velocity. 

The carrot wouldn’t ever be falling in a perfect arc. Maybe adding fins would help them self-correct, but they’re probably too light to ever turn into a decent lawn dart"

Just think. A world on fire. Apocalyptic event in the animals realm of reality. Their homes and their family destroyed. No more food sources to feed those who survived. 

Then from the heavens rain food. Not just scraps or scrapes. Not roots or things that require worked for. Rather it's the most plump and ripe you've ever tasted in your life. Your family eats. You have food to save. When all was lost it was saved by raining food. 

Think about how many crazy stories like this exist in many religious books throughout time. Floods with saviors and parting seas. Burning bushes. Different beliefs yet with very similar stories.

for our puppers and kitties and even our birbs.

TheresA_LobsterLoose,fdt9stk,t1_fdt82zv,"Thanks. Theres a few more pics in my post history. Nothing all that great, but I'd make the effort to make a gif or take good pics if I knew I was getting a Schnoodle. She was somehow abandoned and I adopted her when she was allegedly 6 (seemed a lot younger, but the vets said 6 y/o). Its gotta be going on 7-8 years since I've adopted her, but I dont want to look and know for sure how old she is. Because then I would worry shes getting pretty damn old. She acts like a puppy still, so I don't ever have to consider that shes an old girl as long as I dont know her age for sure. 

That pic, I was holding a Starburst to get her attention, which she absolutely loves. She would choose Starbursts, Welch's fruit snacks or sour patch kids over a steak if it came down to it. If I start unwrapping a Starburst, she sits next to me and starts waving her paw. ""Hey. Hey. Over here"". That's why her eyes are looking up at something, I was holding it next to my phone. I used to eat so much candy, tearing through a bag of SPK while playing my Switch, but now I barely do because I know shes gonna want some too, and I dont want to overdo it with candy. Once every 3 days or so. I cant be a jerk and sit there eating candy while it's her favorite thing in the world and not give her any. So instead we both get some every couple days. Make sure she brushes afterwards"

ceramicthumb,fdtcrop,t1_fdt9uqn,"The girls I babysit have all of the “girly” characteristics (wearing pretty dresses, gossiping, playing princesses, etc) but they sure as heck do risky shit 24/7. Running around in the woods (including climbing without supervision), jumping off very high things, physically fighting each other, antagonizing the dogs and cats.

Miss him so much - we had to put him down a week before Christmas because he had medical issues and  wouldn't eat or walk. Thanks for this - it made me smile for the memory.

acosu27,fdw0wiv,t1_fdtvbm6,Mine too! I’ve had a lot of different breeds in my life and my pitbull now by far is the best dog I’ve ever had.
BangarangPita,feavvt6,t1_fdw0wiv,"Ditto!  Over the years I grew up with shepherd mixes, a Great Dane, a German shepherd, and later pit bulls.  I just love the pibbles.  Different strokes for different folks, and they're perfect for me.  Want to go hiking?  They're up for it.  Want to watch Netflix and snuggle all night?  They're down for it.  Need to work for 12 hours and can't come home to take them out?  No problem, they sleep the whole time.  I could go on and on about how good my current pupper is, but I'll stop here.  😁"
acosu27,fech0x5,t1_feavvt6,"Yes, same!"
AnyDamnThingWillDo,fdscyah,t3_emymww,Beautiful pupper! I miss my bully. She was the most good natured dog I ever had the pleasure of knowing.  She was full of kisses and cuddles to her last breath.
theheadization,fdsp4ik,t3_emymww,Why his ears are cut tho? :/
IgnorantBrunette,fdspnv8,t1_fdsp4ik,"I'm optimistic OP isnt the one who did that. That's the reality I'm choosing to live in, anyway."
somethingbreadbears,fdt2943,t1_fdsp4ik,"When my pit was a puppy she started getting these weird...like air bubbles inside the floppy part of her ears. It was either from playing too rough with other dogs or from shaking her head from swimming. We tried to have them ""drained"" but eventually they had to be surgically removed. And then it happened again! Anyways I remember the vet telling me the only reason she is okay with clipping ears on pits is because their ears are really thin as puppies and sometimes it's easier to have them clipped. Not sure if it's the same on other breeds."
Lord_Noble,fdtblt5,t1_fdsp4ik,"I never understood lopping and docking. Then I met my girlfriends moms pit bull. He would shake his head *so hard* he would split his ears so often. He was prone to a lot of yeast and bacterial infections  (he does have an immune disorder, so a bit special case). He also wags his tail so hard he regularly sprains it **bad**; dogs sometimes cant poop if they have a hurt tail, which can be a huge issue. 

So I dont know how i feel about it. I don't know that he suffers less by having them, and its not like he'll ever have a say in the matter. But he's an oaf who probably couldnt care less."
theheadization,fdspw9n,t1_fdspnv8,"Yeah, I hope that's the case. Happy cakeday by the way"
holdthydoor,fdt4f4z,t1_fdt2943,"This same thing happened to my black lab/pit mix pup a few months ago. His entire left ear was like a balloon. Vet said it was a hematoma, likely from shaking his head and accidentally smacking his ear against the wall or something. They had to do surgery to drain it, and now he has a permanently wonky ear."
oEmSki,fdtgfeb,t1_fdtblt5,"I can definitely see your point that sometimes there's a medical need for it...

but I'm sure that most of the time it's for the aesthetic. Which is a shame tbh. I can't imagine putting my dog under anesthesia unless I absolutely had to."
IgnorantBrunette,fdsq95b,t1_fdspw9n,oh dang it is lol thanks!
SuspiciouslyElven,fdtjy4q,t1_fdt4f4z,"Poor doggos. They can permanently injure themselves from being a doggo. Destroy ears from head shaking, develop ulcers from wagging tail too hard."

Nayre_Trawe,fdsxpn9,t3_emymww,"Our cat of 15 years, who sadly passed last March, loved to do this. When my wife was getting ready in the morning she would jump onto the sink to get her makeup done.

JimLaheysGhost,fdseri8,t1_fdseiw8,If that dog is anything like mine he was just reveling in the attention and affection.
PyroNecrophile,fdt2mz7,t1_fdseiw8,"I highly doubt that he cares about the brush either way. He cares that he's getting attention and his person his probably smiling at him and using baby talk, which means that whatever he's doing, he's making her happy, so he's happy.

It's a very common doggo behavior to sit all prim and proper when people are doting on them but they don't understand why.  They don't know what it is that they're doing to be so adorable and precious and perfect, but they really like getting all that praise and oxytocin, so they sit still and put on their cutest ""deserving of a cookie"" face."
oEmSki,fdsjk8c,t1_fdseiw8,"I think if he wasn't he'd at least turn his head away. So either he's fine or he's enjoying it.

I wouldn't be surprised if he's a total ham and loving it lmao"
deathbreath88,fdsudez,t1_fdseiw8,Every doggo is different. But there are generally no signs of distress or discomfort being presented here. Doggo love his human and probably the attention.
AngrySnakeNoises,fdsnj9d,t1_fdseiw8,He does look like he's paying attention and very calm! No nervousness imo.

I couldn't come across any description of the XXY syndrome in cats, but the analogue in humans is called Klinefelter's syndrome. While men with Klinefelter's syndrome do display some secondary sexual characteristics (some breast development, female pattern pubic hair growth), they only possess male sex organs, and so are not true hermaphrodites.

taryn-fyxe,fe5xgjr,t1_fe4wsm3,"Wow, that's awesome, fosters are the best people. This happened in a rural Midwest town where feral cat colonies were common and there were no shelters/animal control . Our neighbor a few houses down had a few dozen cats that lived on/near their property and NONE of them were fixed. We had pregnant cats show up on our doorstep a few times. We'd get them checked out, care for Mom and kittens, get them fixed and adopt them out. It wasn't a legit operation, but there weren't any other options available. The colony had a ton of calico and tortie cats, and likely some significant inbreeding. We all moved away from the area about 20 years ago (college, divorce, jail), and I often wonder what happened to them all afterwards."

Harley looked him straight in the eyes, bopped him no less than five times on his lunkhead, and Yoda turned and ran. From that moment on, Harley and Yoda were cuddle buddies and never fought again.

Clawfury,fdhuka2,t3_elfurf,Too funny. From a non cat owner - what is it about their physiology / psyche that makes them love boxes so much?
ToastedFireBomb,fdi194l,t1_fdhuka2,"Not a cat owner or a cat biologist but I'm fairly certain it has something to do with the fact that cats naturally like small, enclosed spaces because it gives them a feeling of security, protection, and comfort. They're evolutionary programmed to seek out small little cubbies and hidey holes and boxes are just that: protected on all sides other than the entrance and usually somewhat small and enclosed. ."
oandakid718,fdhxefp,t1_fdhuka2,I was a cat owner and I still can't tell you. It's certainly a peculiar fascination indeed.
DisturbedDeeply,fdiczrr,t1_fdhuka2,"Everyone here seems correct. A quick google search says ""There are lots of reasons that cats love boxes, but the main one is because they’re confined, enclosed spaces. Cats are ambush predators and finding confined places where they can hide, hunt prey and feel safe and warm is an instinctive behaviour. Snug cardboard boxes fit the bill perfectly."""

Not with randomized timers he doesn't. They don't create the superposition necessary for Schrödinger's thought experiment to be valid. You need to have an unstable isotope on the verge of emitting some form of radiation.

The thought experiment isn't about it being random. Rather, he was making fun of the concept of superposition. I'm simplifying everything, but you can have an atom that simultaneously released radiation and did not release radiation. Both scenarios are equally valid and can be described as happening simultaneously. Schrödinger's cat asked what if that superposition can go beyond the atom and encompass a detector, a vial of poison, a box, and a cat inside that box. If superposition was an accurate reflection of reality, than it would mean the cat inside the box is alive AND dead at the exact same time. Both realities are equally true. And the superposition only collapses to just one reality when you open it. (And another question is, when you open the box and find the cat alive, was another universe just created where you found it dead? Where does the other reality go when the superposition collapses? Since it was just as valid as the reality you observe.)

So you see, it's not at all about randomness. Randomness doesn't matter, and a random timer wouldn't do it. You need a process that uses quantum mechanics so a superposition can be created. Although in reality, the detector would collapse the superposition so you could never get one this large. But it's a fun ""what if"" scenario that really makes you realize how weird the universe actually is."

Trin20k,fdiqjs3,t1_fdi5fta,"Not true. Coat colouring is attached to the X chromosome, and as male cats have XY sex pairing, if their X chromosome has ginger, then they’ll be ginger. Females have the XX pairing so for them to be ginger, both X chromosomes need ginger attached. If one is Xginger and the other Xblack for example, they’ll be a tortoiseshell (or calico) because both colors will be expressed in their coat. So ginger females are rarer than males by an order of about 4 to 1.  

When it comes to calicos or tortoise shells though, it is true that they are always either female, or sterile males with an XXY sex pairing. This is because to get the tortoiseshell colouring, you must have two X chromosomes that are expressing different colors, one of those colors being ginger."

I miss them so much, and I have treasured my time with them all."
UristMcRibbon,fe06k2a,t1_fdzfa77,"I love rats but it is hard with the average being 3 years. My oldest rat I had as a kid lived to be about 6 and he was an outlier. I took a 15ish year break and I currently have several which are 3 years old which I got from a breeder and they probably have roughly a year or so left. (I did lose one to respiratory issues at 2 and another is struggling with the same, but it's managed by medication and most have avoided it.)

One of the difficult decisions to make with older rats and your colony (or ""mischief"") is to whether you get new rat buddies for your old boys / girls as the colony starts to dwindle with age. Rats should always be in at least pairs, even if you have a lot of time for them, so deciding to commit to a new cycle right away is a tough decision.

*One advantage with getting new rats right away is that if integration goes well, your old buddies will be super happy."

One lived for 4 years and the other 5. I loved them so much. I was a teenager and both dad and Emily loved sitting on my shoulder or the top of my head when I did my homework.

Hamsters, mice, rats; all of them, 1-3 years. Small critters don't live long.

Bigger ones like rabbits and guinea pigs live longer. Maybe 8 years or more. 

The exception is the chinchilla. I don't know why they're a small rodent that lives *10+* years.

*EDIT: While technically not a rodent, I am mentioning rabbits since rabbits/rabbit supplies are commonly sold in the same area of pet stores as guinea pigs/guinea pig supplies, and have similar care concerns such as the rootless teeth, bedding material, fear of shadows overhead (hawks). If you're just browsing for a pet you'd probably not really consider or know that rabbits aren't rodents. Just keep in mind rabbits are strictly herbivores, rodents are usually omnivores. Guinea pigs are also herbivores making the distinction of lagamorph and rodent for pet ownership even less important.

monthos,fe27gte,t1_fe1mrp4,"We had a gerbil live for around 8 years. We got him when he was already 3 from my aunt because my cousin lost interest.

When he was around 5 I found my cat ""playing"" with him in the kitchen. She must have knocked off the weight we used to keep the top on his tank and pulled him out. I scared her away but one of his front legs were broke.

My mom set the leg and created a splint from a toothpick and some medical tape from our 1st aid box. I have no idea how she did not get bit (he never bit any of us, but that must have hurt like hell!) He did not move much the first couple days. I think my sister was feeding and giving him water via drops. But he survived and hobbled on that splint for a few weeks to a month, then chewed it off and was his normal self again.

He lived a few more years before he just got too old. He was running on his wheel a bit one night before we went to bed (not much, as he was old), when we woke up he had passed.

Sorry my cousin ignored you for so long, Sorry about my cat as well, hope you otherwise had a good life with us Roo."

They like to play with your hands, they groom you, the brux and boggle when they’re happy which is really weird but it makes my heart melt to know I’m making such a small little creature feel safe and happy and comfortable and loved. Rats are capable of empathy, they can learn tricks, they will learn from each other and care for each other. I love the feeling of trust; they’re prey animals, but they trust me enough to groom me and sleep on me and let me rub their bellies and handle them and care for them when they’re sick.


They’re just really lovely little animals. 


I’ve almost never had so few at once (literally for like a month when I first got them and then like 4 months later I had 8 because I fell in love) but food isn’t super expensive, especially if you buy in bulk. I buy a 20kg bag of food every few months for my lot, which is Australian $40-50. Recycled paper cat litter for their litter trays maybe like $40 every couple months (we have cats too so idk how much exactly we go through for the rats because it’s used for everything- throwing rat poo filled litter on your garden makes plants really happy tho). 


Vet cost really depends on your specific vet and rats. I would recommend AT LEAST a few hundred dollars put aside at all times. Most often their problems are respiratory infections which requires antibiotics, some rats have chronic breathing issues that need to be medicated indefinitely to keep their respiratory issues under control and need additional meds. The older they get the more likely you are to run into issues. Sometimes male rats will need to be neutered because of aggression, girls are super prone to mammary tumours so if you’re the kind of person whose willing to pay for surgeries that can be a few hundred dollars. Some rats (rarely) never need to go to the vet! But you’re much better off having some money squirrelled away because chances are you will need to take them to the vet sometime during their life, and likely multiple times.


I think generally, for 2-3 rats, the setup before you get rats is the most expensive part. An adequately sized cage can put you back a couple hundred dollars, and that’s before you buy toys and bedding and hammocks and litter and food and water bottles etc."

I don't think I can handle him going, it's going to be worse than family passing. I really do think my cat cares about me more, and the feeling is mutual. I literally wouldn't be alive without him.

PeacefulChaos379,fe057nr,t1_fe02k4d,"I saw that rats tend to die young because they're susceptible to tumors and pneumonia, and when I search up why I just see that rats with genetic defects are susceptible. Why do all these commercial/pet rats have genetic defects? Is it the same for wild counterparts?"
Rum____Ham,fe0iq8a,t1_fe02k4d,What sort of enclosure? And how long do they have to remain in said enclosure
ogtatertot,fe0cfvx,t1_fe057nr,"A lot of rats aren't bred as well as dogs + cats are, and most wind up from animal mills, feeder breeders, and pet stores so it's often hard to predict the healthiness of a rat. Getting them from a reputable breeder is often the better route as they tend to breed _for_ lack of genetic defects, longetivity, and friendliness.

One thing that almost all rats have, regardless of wild or not, is Mycoplasma. It's an illness that manifests itself in the lungs of a rat and can lead to scarring of the lungs if not treated quickly (hence why they are often succeptible to upper respiratory infections). I basically explain it like all rats being born like a human is with asthma - you take care of your lungs and you often have minimal issues but if you get sick it knocks you down. I had a boy that had terrible Mycoplasma flare ups and passed in November due to pneumonia and it was terrible seeing him like that (but he was a rescue so I didn't know the severity of his conditions prior to adopting him). However I did get a rat from a breeder and he's had ZERO issues with uris and health problems. 

The only rats that aren't born with Mycoplasma are lab rats, as they are delivered via C-section so the Mycoplasma doesn't spread (it occurs when a mother gives birth to her babies). It's very interesting because if you do have lab rats you can't house them with regular rats or else they will wind up with Mycoplasma."
Cloverleafs85,fe0o60i,t1_fe057nr,"Cancer is inevitable if you live long enough. Rats have fast metabolism, so they go through rapid cell division. And cancer is essentially cell division gone wrong. As well as giving higher incidence of cancer, it also means tumors will grow faster as well. So for every cell division there is a chance of error, which can become cancer. It's only a matter of time. Wild rats tend not to live into old age that often, so you wouldn't see as much cancer there because they just plain don't live long enough. They tend to survive for only 1 year. A pet rat is shielded from many rigors of life, and thus much more likely to get all the curses of old age. To us 2 year is very little, and it seems all rats die young. Converted to humans years though 2 years is roughly about 60. 2.5 is 75, and 3 years is 90. 

Also, the risk of cancer can be influenced by many things, and when you are small and have high metabolism, those may make a bigger difference. Like second hand smoke, and especially for rats, too high calorie diet or too much protein. Spayed female rats has less chances of mammary tumors, so their own estrogen could be a frequent culprit.  

There has also been very little evolutionary pressure for higher age in rats. They basically invest the most in  zerging. Grow up fast and have lots and lots of kids before you die young. Many of your kids won't survive, but there is plenty off them so just a fraction is enough. In theory, a female rat could, if not prevented by limited food, space etc, have between 170-205 babies in a year. Evolution only requires good enough, and with that many offspring in such short a time, there isn't going to be much pressure for healthier and more long lived individuals when they can get more than enough done before they die as is. 

If we want longer lived and more robust rats, we're going to have to breed them for it. Which some do. But it's a work in progress, with natural limits. 

As for pneumonia, it's primarily the curse of *Mycoplasma pulmonis*  which is incredibly stubborn once it get's into an environment. Curing the rats who get it is also a big challenge, because for some reason it's more treatment resistant, and it can remain asymptomatic for extended periods of time, until stress, like sickness, pregnancy, old age sets it off, and it is highly infectious. It also doesn't need pet rats to spread, wild rats and mice will do just as well, and it has become very common among the wild populations. So if your house has a wild rodent problem, you could easily get a m.pulmonis problem. Though the most likely way is buying/adopting a new rat who turns out to have been an asymptomatic carrier who then infect your whole colony. And you won't discover this until a stressor makes one symptomatic. 

It's been noted that high ammonia levels in cages can weaken rats and increase the odds of getting sick, so thorough and regular cleaning to prevent urine buildup leading to ammonia buildup, as well as good ventilation can help keep your rats healthy. Lack of vitamin A and E has also been noted, as well as obesity. 

&#x200B;

It seems weird to struggle so much with infectious diseases among your rats until you remember what an unholy terror tuberculosis once was to humans. In the 1800's, about 1 in 7 in USA and Europe died from it. Heck, it still kills 1.5 million people a year now. 

Having a highly infectious disease that is very treatment resistant is a bugger. Something to consider as antibiotic resistant TB is on the rise. 

&#x200B;

Basically, nature has really done a number on rats, but there is things we can do to try and help, by removing or remedying as much of the known risk factors we know of, breed for healthier rats, and hope somebody figures out a better way of eliminating m.pulmonis. Oh and tuberculosis too, while they're at it."

When they are able, rats will bath thoroughly, which is a common characteristic among mammals in general.  The real reason why rats are viewed as filthy is because many rats have been FORCED to adapt to living in and around the filth CREATED BY HUMANS.  Think of it.  You're a local population of rats living among pristine grasslands and forests when all of a sudden humans start settling and urbanizing the local ecosystem.  Before long, the human population density becomes such that human waste begins accumulating, especially sewage and trash.  Any rats that remain must adapt to the new situation or die.  That's evolution.  So they adapt by living in and around the filth that humans created.  So it's not the rats who are filthy, but the human cities that rats are often forced to live in."

Drinking from the bottle probably comes more naturally than lowering their head to drink, since it mimics the way they would eat leaves. At least that is my guess."

Pandas were doing pretty well until humans started destroying their forests, and koalas are suffering now because of man made climate change.

And I mean, if we're going to mock species for endangering the survival of their species due to their eating habits and behaviour, look no further than humans who are well on their way to rendering the entire planet uninhabitable because we consume so many resources and pollute the rest."

doesnt_ring_a_bell,fe2rpsj,t1_fe2exx1,"I've had a fountain for two years now. Neither anything fancy, cost something like £10-20 on Amazon.

We replaced the first one mainly due to difficulties keeping it clean. During the summer, we'd get a pink mould/bacterial film blooming in the corners of the plastic pieces. And due to the way lots of parts were - hollow but bulging out, so concave on the opposite side - they were a bitch to keep clean. The motor was all sealed and not cleanable. We'd try to disinfect it in some bleach, but I suspected it was contributing to the problems.

The new one we picked basically because of having a cleanable motor and more flat looking parts. So far, it's doing better, but we've only had it since autumn.

I honestly don't think there's gonna be much difference in how long different motors last, since they're all done on the same principle. I suspect sometimes you'll just end up with a lemon, as is often the case with Chinese online sellers."

One of the clearest examples of this (although I don't know how well-researched it is) is their inability to cope with eucalyptus leaves when not attached to a tree. If you give a koala a pile of eucalyptus leaves on a plate it will ignore them, even if hungry, as it doesn't understand what to do. If you want to hand-feed them you have to give them a whole branch.

There's some evidence that koalas (or their ancestors) used to have more developed brains, but have evolved to be simpler - they don't need much thinking to hunt down eucalyptus leaves, and simpler brains use far less energy which helps when their diet is limited."

mikaakitten,fe2tqz4,t3_enlafg,"Koalas arent actually meant to drink like that, if you encounter a koala like so, you need to pour the water into a bowl or your hands for it to drink out of. Because koalas get majority of their water from the eucalyptus leaves they eat, sometimes they won’t want to drink water. If you pour the water directly into their mouth it can actually go down their wind pipe and straight into their lungs. I know they’re trying to help and im so glad about that, but koalas can’t properly drink water that way!"
OTL_OTL_OTL,fe2tsr8,t3_enlafg,I predict a future surge in koalas as exotic pets due to all these social media posts about how tame even wild koalas appear.
ImDestructible,fe2w5t4,t3_enlafg,"This is actually very dangerous to do. Not for the human, but the koala. Koalas should only drink out of a bowl. If water is forced down with any pressure, such as gravity from a bottle, it can end up in their lungs and give them pneumonia."

sunlightdrop,fe04fsn,t1_fe02t85,Weird it's the opposite for me! My ragdoll gets a luscious winter coat and his shedding and matting totally stops. In the summer when his coat is short he sheds like crazy and is prone to horrible mats.
greeneyedb3aut,fe10f1c,t1_fe02t85,"I have two ragdolls, similar to OP. They’re brothers from another mother. Oldest floof: shiny, long coat, no mattes. Youngest floof? Straight up dreadlocks. And they’re close to the skin so they tug. Poor kitty. We have to get him shaved soon."
Gundikins,fe1dqmd,t1_fe02t85,Just trimmed the heck out of my two ragdolls! SO MUCH FUR ... I think we have enough fur to make another cat
red_sky33,fe16vsm,t1_fe02t85,"Had what I think was mostly maine coon, and the matting was awful. Probably didn't help that he was in-door/out-door, but no amount of brushing fixed it"
Lily_Roza,fe0mweu,t1_fe04fsn,"I had a long-haired cat. Eventually my vet suggested I take him in to a groomer. So, each year, when the weather started warming up, I had his fur trimmed, and he loved it. I'm sorry that I didn't know to do that most of his life. Before the spring trims, he was probably fairly miserable in the summer. He was a Russian Blue mixed with Siamese, but for some reason very fluffy."
DorkasaurusBBQ,fe1pscz,t1_fe10f1c,"Are they from the same breeder/parents? It’s my understanding that ragdolls and ragamuffins don’t have under coats, which is the bit that gets matted in most long haired cats"
ToTheSeaAgain,fe2ux8l,t1_fe10f1c,"Get him shaved now. Cats have extremely sensitive skin, and don't show pain much at all. Mats on cats are very painful, even if they don't show it.

Lily_Roza,fe0zq3m,t1_fe0vubm,"OMG, he was a wonderful cat. I know he was half Siamese because he was born to my Mama Cat, and I knew his father too, curiously they both had short hair. His blue grey coat, he inherited from his father. He had the heart of a lion, and the wisdom of a sage. He was top cat, a benevolent and patient ruler, but not one to shirk his duty if some young tough needed a whoopin. And when he did fight, he was an invisible ninja, a whirlwind of blurry grey furry fury, whose feet never seemed to touch the ground.

He knew I liked babies, and one time when I was in the kitchen, he came in and put a perfect,  adorable white baby mouse, without a scratch on it, between my feet and it proceeded to run in circles to his great delight. I put it outside where hopefully it had a good life.

I'm sure I have pictures somewhere, but won't have time this weekend. I'll let you know when I get a chance to post them."

i_wap_to_warcraft,fecmt4s,t3_eodytg,I’m an addict and my dog is sitting in front of me depressed as fuck. It’s 9pm my time but this just gave me motivation to go outside wither her. Thank you

DefinitelyNotAliens,fecjpwl,t1_fec8q4w,You just see Watson and Kiko. They've got owners who actively photograph them. Kiko just happens to 'hug' Watson and they hike a lot so you get a lot of similar photos. They're adorable dogs with photographer owners who share a lot.
Daankeykang,fecjfcn,t1_fec8q4w,I'm on reddit for like 12 hours every day and I've never seen this picture
LeoLaDawg,fecof03,t1_fec8q4w,"Yeah like dude said, I'm here every day for hours and never saw this either."

eliblack,fe3uqji,t1_fe3qvg1,Right? I think we can all agree she’s an expert too.
RichBitchDress,fe5l4zp,t1_fe3qvg1,TIL im an idiot for buying a 80 dollar dog bed. But its a snoozer and she loves it.
heckusernamesheck,fe5rcdu,t1_fe3uqji,Genuine question. Is it allowed??? I never went for a mattress shopping before.
VaginaYEASTwithTEETH,fe5simd,t1_fe3uqji,And when she wakes up with a yawn + stretch... the store will gift you the bed due to the excessive cuteness.
definitelynotthe-NSA,fe5otcg,t1_fe5l4zp,Not an idiot if she loves it and also a good bed is good for her health
GTRari,fe5tfu9,t1_fe5l4zp,Definitely not an idiot given that she loves it. You can be like me and buy a bed for your dog only to have her sleep on the floor a couple feet away.
Cg407,fe5xsf2,t1_fe5l4zp,I did this same thing. Paid $80 for a Beauty Rest branded dog bed from Home Goods. Seeing this picture makes me thing I paid too much.
Luvlygrl123,fe5wefi,t1_fe5rcdu,"If ur going mattress shopping u can definitely lay on the beds, its why they have feet guards on the bare mattresses. Just dont actually go to sleep when u go there intentionally. Though if u accidentally fall asleep i guess youve found a good mattress!"
effywap,fe5wcmp,t1_fe5rcdu,It’s def allowed and expected to test out mattresses by laying on them but I think actually falling asleep would be frowned upon lol
AlbinoWino11,feancqo,t1_fe5rcdu,What kind of monster is going to stop this from happening...?  When you are that cute you can do whatever you wish.
noputa,fe6gv56,t1_fe5simd,ha! we all wish.
RichBitchDress,fe5pn2s,t1_fe5otcg,It is. I'm jealous of it. It's like a sleeping bag but the bottom is a fluffy dog bed. Also when I first got her. I got her a regular bed and she ripped it ope but not enough to toss it. And then one day I hear crying when I'm watching tv. And she got stuck in one of the holes she bit open. And I had to cut her out. Immediately tossed it and found this bed she can safely burrow in.
RichBitchDress,fe5tsfr,t1_fe5tfu9,I keep her bed next to my bed and she also lays on my bed. :)
aDuckSmashedOnQuack,fe6b4lz,t1_fe5wefi,If you fall asleep on store mattresses you may have vivid dreams about controlling time and space using a TV remote christopher walken gave you but in using that remote you lose yourself and become detached from reality and you end up fat and unlikable before you die in the rain surrounded by your fake family. Be careful out there.
heckusernamesheck,fe5wgta,t1_fe5wcmp,Depends on how cute you look while sleeping. Lolz
gadgetluva,fe61n7b,t1_fe5wcmp,"I fell asleep on a couch when I was out shopping for one. I was working pretty crazy hours and wasn’t getting a ton of sleep, and bought a condo during this time.

wavesahoy,fe41ymo,t3_enqnb8,I’m going to buy a couple of these to give the local shelter. Can you imagine how easy it would be to adopt a pet looking this comfortable?
beautifulmess25,fe46yuc,t1_fe41ymo,"I would advise buying good, warm blankets instead -if you can.
The animals are in a strange and scary environment and often pee or poo on their bedding. It's much easier to wash 5 blankets than 1 bed. 
Washing machines are often limited and you would not believe how many times a single puppy will destroy their bedding.
If that's not possible, little things like newspaper, puppy pads and cat litter are much appreciated.
- Many thanks from a retired shelter worker"
xaanthar,fe5iz0d,t1_fe41ymo,"It could backfire -- they look so comfortable at the shelter, I wouldn't want to take them away from that!"

shoresb,fe55ac9,t1_fe4as2z,And towels! Shelters always need lots of towels!
TriGurl,fe5nkpx,t1_fe4blt8,Or perhaps those big pillow beds that can still go in the washing machine but are only $10each. We spent $50 on a fancy bed for our rescue bulldog who wasn’t potty trained and we realized that bed wasn’t the easiest to wash... so we swapped out to the big pillows that we could wash until we got her puppy pad trained. :)
sarcadistic75,fe6aw6r,t1_fe66h0f,I don't work in a shelter but i do foster litters of puppies.  I never have enough hand towels.  Tiny puppies never need a regular bath towel and they make lots of messes so i think they'd love them
MrCasterSugar,fe40zxj,t3_enqnb8,The price is kinda steep though
eliblack,fe41ffg,t1_fe40zxj,Definitely. This was at Petco. We went next door to Home Goods and bought a very similar bed for $20!
Rayyychelwrites,fe5l2wd,t1_fe40zxj,Idk $45 for that bed and the puppy sounds like a steal
thewhorse,fe5kh29,t1_fe40zxj,"Beds like that at our pet stores are usually in the $175 range.. 


Walmart sells similar ones tho for about $60...


That price sounda like an absolute steal if you ask me id buy 2"

Devilalfi,fe5ujhv,t1_fe41ffg,Costco has good dog beds too. They used to be $25 which was really good but I think they raised them $10 a few months ago...

madari256,fe656mr,t1_fe64cfp,"Not stupid! I wondered the same thing! You don't or you find an area that no or not a lot of dogs roam. Puppies don't need long walks for exercise though. It's bad for their joints as they're growing. You usually ""walk"" a puppy 5 min for each month. So 2 months old is only 10 min walk twice a day. We just played a lot with our pup inside or in our back yard and it was plenty for her. And lots of mental stimulation! It's better than physical exercise!

Socializing is about letting a dog see different things, not necessarily interacting with stuff.

However, if you're in a low risk area for parvo, your vet might say it's okay. Our vet told us they have had cases of parvo around, so we were cautious. Just a risk vs reward. One dude on another subreddit said he'd rather his dog die from parvo than be unsocialized so yeah..."
PotahtoSuave,fe61muq,t1_fe5wgnm,"Nothing, but they can't get vaccinated until they're 6-8 weeks with boosters every 3 weeks until the puppy is 16 weeks old and a final booster at 1 year. So most people try to keep their puppy away from strange dogs until they're 4 months old."
Sickstrangedarkness,fe6c8j2,t1_fe656mr,"That's fair! Thanks 
Yeah it was never really talked about with our dogs - they told us walking was no problem as long as we didnt let him play with dogs we weren't very familiar with and no dog park until vaccines are all done but I never thought you couldnt take him around your street and whatnot."
madari256,fe6cxip,t1_fe6c8j2,"Parvo can stick around for years I think. Shit ton of ways for a dog to get it too. It can spread from feces/vomit, so walkin a puppy in an area where lots of dogs use the bathroom could be not good."

MadHatter69,fdi2v9j,t1_fdhxzqp,"I was in Greece a couple of times in the past few years (including islands of Kefalonia and Thassos) and I can confirm this: there's a lot of stray cats in Greece (and some stray dogs, too).

The cats on Kefalonia had somewhat weird, long faces, but were generally very chill - some of them were just lying on very frequent sidewalks pretty much all the time, people had to walk around them, and these kitties were just straight ignoring anyone that tried to pet them or interact with them in any way. 

I guess they were well fed (and fed up with people) - I tried giving them food and petting them a couple of times, but they were very lethargic (even for cats, lol)."
shakeatorium,fdi9vhs,t1_fdhxzqp,"Bro what do you mean people in Greece don't view cats as pets? Of course we do, it's just that there's not really any serious control on strays of any kind (cats and dogs) so there tends to be a ton of strays everywhere around Greece.

Unless you are in a rural area, if you see a cat outdoors it's easy to assume that it is lost or a stray; and stray cats in America are often underfed and distrust humans.

That was just my view, though, so I'll cede to local expertise on it."

JayC-Hoster,fe6n7kl,t1_fe66m65,"Chinese ""Lion dance"" lion, they don't really look like a real African lion, but it is what they are called. Cultural heritage dance dating back 1500 years (rough estimate). Always performed during Chinese New Year, occasionally at traditional weddings and other festivals. The Lion head's got blinking eyes and mouth for articulation, worn by two performer, one operating the head, the other the back. The colours of the lions all have meanings too but I'm not educated about them enough to explain it properly here.

I even think its hair is standing up - judging by how ridiculously thick the tail is. Ever see a cat puff up like that without some sort of threat like another animal near by? I haven't.

Not cool at all.

It's one thing if you do stuff like that when your cat is young and receptive to training, or you know it doesn't mind, but they probably had to forcefully hold that cat down to put that thing on it and then left it on to make a ""cute"" video. Not aww."

Manchu_Fist,fdqirn3,t1_fdqeflo,"We were soo tempted to get another husky but decided we didn't want to be outnumbered. You are soo right about them having personalities. 

Yukio our husky acts like a little princess. Shes a absolute spaz when its playtime with wade the malamute. 

Wade is a big, lumbery lazy boy. While yukio acts more like a cat when it comes to affection, wade is more like a dog. Just wants to be loved all the time. Hes a big ol teddy bear. 

Hes got a personality too. He gets sassy when he thinks it's time to eat and will awoo until you feed him."

SandyDelights,fdsn3q6,t1_fdqexsu,"Honestly, they’re super social so having two is better than just one, as they can play together and it helps reduce the need for you to socialize with them – not erase, of course, but anyone who’s had a dog that’s super social you know it can be a bit draining sometimes, when you just want to, yanno, vegetate.

And by the time you have two, what’s three, or four? It’s not like you play with them one at a time. ;)"
Jennelope,fdqjopa,t1_fdqirn3,"We have one noisy princess lol her sister will talk a little when you get her going. The boys are mostly quiet.

Asspartameme,fdqgfdo,t1_fdqfd95,"Oh absolutely! I rescued Jax in September when he was 6 months old from a pretty crappy situation that he had no control over. He was in a crate all day with no leash or potty training and was going to be used for strictly breeding purposes. I've owned a lot of dogs in my life but he has been by far the most hard headed dog I've ever had. He gets a 3 mile walk everyday and has a backyard to run around in plus his trick training. But if you know anything about Huskys they are trouble makers naturally. He will dig until there is nothing left to dig if he feels so. Leaving food unattended around him is not an option and if he doesn't like what you are doing, you will hear about it no matter what time of the day it is. At the end of the day it's worth all of it though. Hes the most loving, sensitive boy who can snug with the best of them. https://imgur.com/1jznhUV.jpg"

annotipoxx,fe9bbrq,t1_fe96acf,"I wonder if cats have a thicker skull compared to humans..

Zombemi,fe9ji0a,t1_fe96acf,"I don't know if it was this specific condition but I saw someone with a cat who tumbled kinda like this (at lower speeds). They affixed small carpets to the floor wherever there wasn't carpeting so the cat could get around easier. No struggling or speed needed on floors with nothing to grab. 

Also cats don't run crazy 24/7...tho it seems like it sometimes. This might be their way of allowing the cat to get the crazies out in a safer environment, so it's calmer inside."

AFlyingNun,fe9l9s8,t1_fe98kck,"Good to hear. Looking at the vid it sort of felt like there was a vibe of ""OH BOY LET'S SEE WHICH WAY MY ASS FLIES THIS TIME,"" so good to know there's ""evidence"" to suggest the cat may be having fun going nuts like this in this clip."
VexingRaven,fe9y9cv,t1_fe98kck,"This is the best part about animals with conditions like this.

Fap_Left_Surf_Right,fe9ce07,t1_fe98dd4,"As a cat owner, self imposed physical pain means nothing for them. They can do it all day.

If I roll it under the kitchen table where there are 20 wooden legs she can knock her head off of, well then she sprints at full speed and smashes every joint in addition to her skull.  

Pain is their God. Whether inflicting it into something else or inflicting upon themselves, penance must be paid and it is glorious."
Meloetta,fe9hkyw,t1_fe9bbrq,"It's about momentum. Their mass is so much less than ours that it makes a HUGE difference. Like, say you have a 15 pound cat running full tilt at 20 mph. Above-average weight cat moving at above-average speeds - or, in other words, large cat movin fast. Their momentum is 60.8322 kg·m/s. Now say you have a human weighing 140 and running 6mph (pulled from average scores in races). THEIR momentum is 182.497 kg·m/s, about triple.

It's the same idea behind why toddlers fall and get back up and have no problems but when an adult human falls we all groan like old men getting up from an old saggy couch."

QuantumDrej,fe9hin7,t1_fe9ce07,"I used to feel horrible about stepping on one of my cats.

Now I don't necessarily laugh at her, but I will verbally bitch her out for a minute because she'll either speed bump you as you're walking inside or suddenly plant herself right under your feet so there's no way to avoid stepping on her. Bonus points if you're coming in with groceries and can't see below you. Then she'll yowl dramatically and glare at you like it's your fault.

I do check that she wasn't seriously hurt, but Jesus Christ, cat."
nocturnaldominance,fe9h8om,t1_fe9ce07,"Yes I second that. My cat tried to do a runner into an area of the house where she's not allowed, but I shut the door in time and she walked away looking very sheepish and not looking at anyone"

fightwithgrace,fe9jr9r,t1_fe9ce07,"I mean, my cat is “normal” and I’m surprised that he lives through most days. A lot of cats seem to be missing the self-preservation gene. He’s still a kitten though, so he hasn’t mastered the “I meant to do that...” expression and casual paw lick."
zach0011,fea1hja,t1_fe9ce07,Yea my kitten would run into stuff so hard I was getting worried. But they are bouncy as hell so I always wondered if she even hurt herself.

raven080068,fe8aiti,t3_eo4gmc,Did a small search about CH. Apparently it's not progressive and no pain involved. I hate to see animals in pain and suffering so I'm happy Thorin isn't hurting and able to have fun

Sparrow-717,fe9nqa3,t1_fe8aiti,"Yeah, we have a cat with CH. He's a little slower than this cat here, but he lives a happy life. When he gets to the smooth hardwood floor area, he tends to put his back legs out like training wheels, and runs around using his front legs.

His nickname is Flops. Graceful he isn't, but awesome he is."
NastySassyStuff,fe9vzzf,t1_fe8aiti,"Well, they *may* get themselves hurt flopping and flailing all around and knocking shit over.

skwidsquid,fe9q647,t1_fe8bgga,That’s a way to think about it
Drusgar,fe90x7j,t1_fe8xgjp,"Think of it from a physics perspective.  The reason cats (and children) seem so indestructible is because they don't weigh much.  When I was two years old and fell over, I didn't have very far to fall and I didn't have enough weight to damage my soft tissues when I fell.  Now that I'm 6'1"" and 230 lbs, falling over is painful.  Because I fall farther and have more weight for my soft tissues to absorb."
BellerophonM,fe9n88l,t1_fe8xgjp,He's crashing as badly as this because he's outside on the soft grass where he can fling himself around at full speed with wild abandon and not get hurt. On solid ground he probably goes slower and it's more just stumbling than frontflips. What you see in this clip is playtime.
kachowlmq,fe9leju,t1_fe8xgjp,This video is probably not a good example of how they manage getting around. There is a CH cat on Insta (@orangeisthenewblackandtan) named Phin and they have lots of videos of him running down hallways and stuff.  He goes pretty fast and manages to only occasionally really nail the wall or appliances. It’s interesting to see how they adapt even with being so wobbly.
wanderessinside,fe98mvz,t1_fe8xgjp,"Veterinarian here: with CH there are also difficulties eating and drinking, as the cerebellum is an organ responsible among others for fine tuning. I feel like quality of life is very important in animals, so just painless is not enough, but Im an equine vet so maybe I am biased because we tend to euthanize much much easier"
GreatQuantum,fe9p48y,t1_fe8xgjp,Ok well at least they can enjoy life for now. I imagine when they age necessary precautions will be taken. We all know what a shelter would do.

Luxpreliator,fea5czn,t1_fe9jptu,So what happens if you get actual drunk.
XytronicDeeX,fe9hy9s,t1_fe9afm3,Any variation of thor is a common Nordic name. My neighbours youngest is called thore (not sure how to spell it in a way it's pronounced correct in English tho. A little like thor-eh probably)
SCRRAAAAAAAAAAWWWWW,fe916kq,t1_fe90x7j,"Well yes, but cats get stiff, less agile and more fragile as they age, just like humans do."
PussyWrangler462,fe9s0q3,t1_fe90x7j,"We have a CH cat at our shelter named Wobbles

He’s broken off both his canine teeth from falling and smashing his head on the ground 

He’s constantly covered in shit because he has a hard time using the litter box so we put pee pads on the floor for him. Some have it less severe than others but I can assure you there can be pain as a result of the condition"
culturerules,fe9k1jv,t1_fe90x7j,and baby human bones are squishy.
missingadogsomewhere,fe9ql64,t1_fe90x7j,"You’re right, definitely less painful for a cat!

PussyWrangler462,fe9sea1,t1_fe9leju,"We have a cat named Wobbles at our shelter that has CH, when he goes down the hallway he uses the wall for support and manages to get around well that way"
StaniX,fe9s5jg,t1_fe9leju,I think it comes in different levels. Homie in the gif might have it a little worse than the one you're talking about.
Fap_Left_Surf_Right,fe9em0h,t1_fe98mvz,"I saw YouTube’s on how to squish the cat. I began to squish my cat. She loves it. 

Why tho"
LillyGraceCH,fe9eppu,t1_fe98mvz,"Perhaps you should check the many resources for feline CH groups.  My 13 year CH is severe but has a wonderful life. She has carpeted ramps, tunnels and a few minutes of supervised playtime outside on the grass with me or my husband each day.  

She can pull herself up onto her window bed and can slide about the house.  

Cats also sleep a lot. They play rough with catnip toys and tumble with other kitties. They don’t all live outdoors and run about or climb trees. 

She gets propped up to eat but can eat just fine once settled. She’s the alpha cat even with her CH. Our two other kitties always let her have her way. 

CH is not painful and as they grow they learn to adapt and figure out ways to get things done."
Meloetta,fe9isv7,t1_fe98mvz,"I bet you guys euthanize especially easier for leg/walking issues, because...horses. Cats aren't the same."
Wizzdom,fe9ee5g,t1_fe98mvz,If my vet advised euthanizing the cat shown above I'd find a different vet.
NastySassyStuff,fe9ycvx,t1_fe98mvz,"I have a cat with pretty severe CH. Some just sort of have a silly looking walk that they become accustomed to, mine struggles more than that and falls pretty often. She still finds her way around comfortably enough and always manages to surprise me with her ability to do so: 

As far as eating and drinking goes, though, you just have to accommodate for it. Heavy water dish in the corner of the room that she can mosey up to with accuracy and can’t knock over. I put her in a bean bag (which she loves)to feed her and that generally works out just fine. Yeah, a little more work and a little more to clean up occasionally, but if someone thinks that’s a reason to euthanize they should stay the hell away from animals in the first place. They just need a little more love."
lannvouivre,fea3iec,t1_fe98mvz,"I'm sorry to hear about the foal that had CH.

Cats do have shorter throats and their diets involve less chewing, so I can see why the prognosis for a horse would be different just in that aspect alone.

Sometimes I wonder about how humans view quality of life vs. how animals would view their lives. Individual people seem to have a ton of variation in what they feel acceptable for their own lives."

SneakyDee101,fe92ih7,t1_fe916kq,"As a result, they also get less active. It all balances out."
elmagio,fe96q5h,t1_fe916kq,"Once he's older he won't be bouncing around anymore, he'll still trip but with much less velocity and therefore shouldn't hurt himself too much."
kachowlmq,fe9trsy,t1_fe9s5jg,It definitely has levels. It is hard to tell in the gif how he would react if there were things around him. Phin is pretty bad when going full speed.
StaniX,fe9rhki,t1_fe9em0h,Man the cat squishing vet is so awesome. Seeing him interact with his chubby little cat is adorable.
wanderessinside,fe9j4jt,t1_fe9isv7,"Well not for walking issues per se but if a horse  cannot enjoy the reminder of life in a species appropriate manner and/or needs pain management (that usually fails after time), we do tend to let go. I didnt say cats are the same though."
NastySassyStuff,fe9zr6k,t1_fe9ee5g,A vet’s assistant didn’t quite suggest euthanasia but implied it as an option if my CH cat’s situation was really problematic. Seemed gross and mostly bothered me because it told me that they didn’t even really know what CH was. It’s really not painful or miserable for the cat at all. You just have to be willing to put more work in and give more love than a regular cat typically needs which is still a lot less than what a dog requires lol.
wanderessinside,fe9istq,t1_fe9ee5g,"No one advised euthanasia here. I said in CH cats painless is not enough and quality of life is very important, in equine/large animal we are more inclined to take these decisions faster, thats it. I was not talking about this cat in particular, I was replying at a comment discussing pain vs no pain."

StaniX,fe9u60q,t1_fe9trsy,Apparently its from an area of the brain being too small or even missing. I guess its worse the smaller that area is.
StaniX,fe9rqrg,t1_fe9istq,Someone higher up in the thread was talking about weight making a major difference in how much a fall hurts. Im assuming that falling down like this is much more dangerous for a horse than it is for a cat.

NastySassyStuff,fea35dt,t1_fe9si06,"The adversity they’re referring to is like, ya know, the inability to actually walk. The struggle to get close enough to their food to eat without toppling over or to stand still while they take a shit. For a lot of people that’s a miserable existence even if your every need is catered to by family members and nurses. Animals just deal and go on with it. Kitty still has a blast running around all willy nilly when he gets a chance to go outside."

scoopdapoops,fe8wdel,t3_eo4gmc,"Since this gains popularity everytime its reposted I'm gonna take a minute to say, CH cats are disabled cats. CH is easier to think about as a spectrum with some cats being slightly clumsy and some cats literally needing to drag themselves with their claws or a complete inability to coordinate any bodily function.  They are not some cute wobbly cat, they have immune disorders as well and can become very Ill from minor bugs. CH develops in the womb and there is no cure or treatment options. Some cats are euthanized so they dont have to live a life of suffering. Thorin here seems to have a very mild case of CH, but his owners should not let him outside as CH cats are targets for birds of prey as they cant defend themselves like most cats. 
Please take a moment to realize CH is not some cute little disorder but a major medical issue. 

Source: Had a cat with very severe CH. (Unable to move on her own, incontinent, severe immune deficiency, and brain trauma from frequent slams and slips due to her coordination.)"
ersomething,fe90el6,t1_fe8wdel,"So they should keep him in a padded room with nothing to climb on and possibly get hurt?  There’s risks to every cat going outside. 

I don’t think the video minimizes the potential hardship other cats have with the disorder. It’s just a cute video that makes me smile when I see it.  Some things don’t have to have a deeper message. 

Lighten up Francis.

Edit to add:  I’m not trying to make light of your cat’s problems. And I applaud you for taking care not them. I apologize if I sound cavalier about something potentially devastating."

Twallot,fdjhl9q,t1_fditrup,"My sweet little chihuahua who died over a year ago loved jumping into people's arms (obviously she wasn't able to jump high so you'd have to bend over and hold your hands out and she'd run and jump). Sometimes if you went to pick her up she would jump so hard that you wouldn't be ready so you'd have to catch her by her back legs so she didn't flip over on her head. I dropped her more than once. When she got old and a bit fat she still liked being picked up but it hurt her to have it done under her arms and she couldn't jump so she would stop, turn her butt to you, then stand perfectly still so you could scoop her up under her belly. 

I miss that little weirdo so much."

Twallot,fdk5kv8,t1_fdjlo7s,No shit? She was like 5 pounds and I didn't literally pick her up from her arm pits. She would jump into my hands face first so obviously I would have to catch her from her chest area. When she got chubby from diabetes she was too bottom heavy to do it anymore. I grew up with a cat who had neurological damage so her back end was floppy and she had to be picked up by scooping her up under her bum and your other arm supporting her under her chest. Don't need you to explain to me how to pick up an animal there bud.

> Clinical signs of canine intoxication include depression, hypersalivation, mydriasis, hypermetria, vomiting, urinary incontinence, tremors, hypothermia, and bradycardia. Higher dosages may additionally cause nystagmus, agitation, tachypnea, tachycardia, ataxia, hyperexcitability, and seizures.

According to the **Merck Veterinary Manual**, common signs of marijuana toxicosis that owners may notice include inactivity; incoordination; dilated pupils; increased sensitivity to motion, sound or touch; hypersalivation; and urinary incontinence. A veterinary exam can reveal depression of the central nervous system and an abnormally slow heart rate. Less common signs include restlessness, aggression, slow breathing, low blood pressure, an abnormally fast heart rate, and rapid, involuntary eye movements. In rare cases, animals can have seizures or become comatose.”

My Basset Hound decided to reach up on the counter for some special chocolate cookies that my roommate made while i was at work. I get a call and when i check the voicemail i get this, ""Yo dood, Delilah got ahold of the cookies and ended up eating about 20 of them, she seems okay, but she did throw up and shit every where, dont worry we cleaned it up, sorry man.""

Now, you're probably thinking. Horrible roommates. But at least the cleaned up the shit and puke.

So i get home (oh and this is New Years Eve btw) and my dog is so freaking high, she is shaking.

I had to stay up with her all night because her balance was off so much that anytime she would fall asleep she seemed to freak out and think she was falling.

It was horrible.

After this Delilah hated being around anyone that smoked. I guess shes a one hit quit it type of pup.

Edit: thanks for all the love!!!"

Next morning she **couldn't wait** to get outside to do her business.  She ran around the yard spraying butter-scented dogshit around like a nuclear powered butterscotch firehose.   

Good times."

He also did that “I’m falling and I’m freaking out” thing, threw up everywhere, etc. He has a special collar with a monitor and it said his heart rate part of the night was 170. Totally not okay.

cannedcomment,fdld9z9,t1_fdkph5k,depends on the age/health of the dog. both thc and theobromine (the primary toxin in cocoa) increase heart rate. Combining them in large doses isn't a great idea and it's not like a dog can tell the vet it thinks it's having a heart attack.
IIdsandsII,fdlembu,t1_fdkwe2u,"growing up, my mother used to leave a bowl of candy out, usually hershey kisses. we had a mini schnauzer who ate an entire bowl of them when we out one time (he never attempted to go into the bowl before). he spit out the aluminum wrappers and almonds, but he must've eaten like at least 25 of them. he was totally fine, though he did end up with diabetes in old age, probably unrelated."
mattred33,fdlfj3t,t1_fdlembu,"Milk chocolate is way less toxic for a dog than dark chocolate. A 40-50 lbs dog could probably eat 50+ Hershey's Kiss and still be fine (they might vomit or have other GI issues, but it wouldn't be deadly). If they ate 50 Hershey's Kisses made of dark chocolate it would be an emergency.

Dogzillas_Mom,fdl2uht,t1_fdkp8ci,"I had a dog who ate \*some\* pot. He spent the night in the doggy ER, where they told me that cannabis removes the dog's ability to regulate its body temperature. Normal temp for a dog is about 101 and my dog arrived at the emergency vet with a body temp of 97. They put him on warmed saline, wrapped him in blankets and monitored his vitals all night. I could have lost him. 

Dogs eating weed is no joke. I hope this little guy above is fine now. (I'm sure he is because he's actually at the vet.)"

And about the chocolate, dogs can actually eat a lot of chocolate before it actually hurts them. A brownie or two will probably make both ends upset but nothing too permanent."
OneGayPigeon,fdl3mh7,t1_fdkp8ci,"Very serious! It only takes a little of an edible to cause THC toxicity in dogs. They have more cannabinoid receptors which means it affects them much more strongly than humans. To the people talking about their dogs eating nugs and being fine, that’s because flower has to be heated and decarbed to have an effect, which is why you have to heat weed and make butter/whatever fat you choose from the flower, you don’t just throw ground up nugs in the brownie mix."

Edit 2: Why are you all debating me on this? I didn’t do the studies. Professional vets did. Write to them and tell them they are wrong and why you are right. Arguing with me about their findings is stupid and pointless."
mkhebert,fdl1iyj,t1_fdkw441,Yeah it depends on the size of the dog and the darkness of the chocolate. Always just safe to keep it away.
GoldSealHash,fdkx37i,t1_fdkw441,Chocolate contains the chemical theobromine which is toxic in medium to large quantities. Found in darker chocolate usually but can be some milk chocolate.
missmisfit,fdkwzpd,t1_fdkw441,"eh, it depends. my brothers elderly dauchsand was on her last year, most likely, but the half a bag of reece's cups that she somehow managed to get did her in."
sleepyspruce,fdlauon,t1_fdkw441,"My pit ate a bunch of chocolate last week. She got into three UNOPENED BAGS of mini candy bars (reeses, kit-kats and kisses). She ate absolutely all of it... the packaging, wrappers, literally all of it. We came home to a 2x2in piece of one bag, that was all the evidence left. Well, that and a super guilty face. 

Anyway, SHE IS FINE! She threw up a little, pooped out candy wrappers for a few days, never had any diarrhea and then three days later it's like it NEVER happened. It was absolutely terrifying, we genuinely thought our dog was going to die, but she didn't even act like it bothered her."

carriegood,fdl4ker,t1_fdl193w,"The article you linked to said they MAY be toxic.  It says there have been some studies and some suggestions. It talks about studying things in the future. It says nothing definitive, not even close.  I'm not saying whether cannabinoids are safe or not, just that this link doesn't serve as evidence to support your claim.

We just went to a dispensary this weekend (medical, not recreational) and they had a bottle of ""pet drops""  that were supposed to be CBD oil, but it says it's made from ""full spectrum"" hemp, so I think there might even be THC in it as well.  In any case, if cannabinoids are toxic across the board, I don't think this licensed dispensary would sell it.  Too much liability."

gwasson,fds9wwj,t1_fdrk8is,Looks exactly like a puppy version of my catahoula/aussie shepherd mix!
anderhole,fds53yv,t1_fdrk8is,Think it has to be. Only other pups with similar marks that I've seen are Australian Shepherds and Greyhounds. Definitely ain't one of those.
SilverFox8188,fdskgkt,t1_fds9xo1,Up in the comments OP said mom was a border collie. So we might have a Catahoula mix on our hands. EXCELLENT breed!
SilverFox8188,fdskkop,t1_fds53yv,Dachshunds have that and Great Danes too.

chingcoeleix,fdysnsn,t1_fdy331a,"Because I think they like to swim I think. They’re basically water ferrets, I don’t think there’s anything really bad with them, like they’ll just die in captivity, it’s more of a advanced care thing. Ppl say monitor lizards and stuff aren’t good pets, but they’re amazing pets, all of mine have different personalities and enjoy attention. Why they say they’re bad pets, is because they need advanced care and it costs a Lot of money for them. When my savanah monitor gets bigger I have to make it it’s own house in the backyard haha"

JownCenta,fdq4qbx,t1_fdpypf6,"It may be your opinion, doesn't mean its the right opinion though."
NadVic17,fdqs7nn,t1_fdpypf6,"while this might be your opinion, people here are often enough downvoting and upvoting taking their opinion into account. not every vote has to be justified objectively.

people get downvoted all the time for making jokes that others don't like or don't understand, just as people are going to be toxic in competitive games. imo though, in case of the game it just shows the value of the game. their rank is important to them and when they have the feeling that others don't try to win and just want to bring them down, they get tilted. that's a totally human reaction. as soon as you realize this (and also discover the ""/mute all""-function), you can actually start having fun in the game.

&#x200B;

let's say it like that: i doubt any of the 10 players in each game just queue up to int, flame and blame others. 10 of them usually try to have fun. as long as you just mute the toxic people or actually just mute all, you can actually play this game quite well without feeling worse/bad afterwards imo."

A rare but serious haunting of a beloved pet. And this demon is a real son of a bitch for going after a kitten. So I don't think there's a priest good enough under the sun who can exercise this cat.

BunnyOppai,fdgwtqk,t1_fdglfan,"I'm not arguing in their favor, but Googling ""do cats have sensitive whiskers"" shows that they do have sensitive whiskers. Damaging them (like if they stuck their head too close to a fire and melted them, for example) won't *hurt* the cat, but overstimulation can be a risk with prolonged exposure to something. 

And obviously something like this shouldn't bother a cat, but there are cases where cats whiskers can be easily overstimulated, particularly with something like deep, fairly narrow bowls that many cats will refuse to drink out of because of how uncomfortable it makes them."

Makkaah,fdglsdh,t1_fdgkvjc,"I think it depends on a cat, same with touching their toes, bellies or tail. Some just don't like it"
JMer806,fdgofqz,t1_fdgkvjc,"Their whiskers are sensitive and cats wouldn’t want you to just mess with their whiskers. But if you’re giving them face rubs, they don’t mind. 

IMPORTANT NOTE: Different cats like different things. If your cat is annoyed by certain petting (touching whiskers, belly rubs, whatever) then be kind and don’t do it."
SpoopySales,fdgqr1v,t1_fdgkvjc,"It's very dependent on the preference of the cat, but a general rule would be to not as they are sensitive. A kitten would have shorter, softer whiskers so going against the grain like this person is probably feels a bit odd, but not unpleasant, hence the twitchies. My adult wouldn't like it, but slicking them back occasionally as I stroke his cheek is a favorite and is really the only way I fuss with them."
AssymetricManBoob,fdgry2e,t1_fdgkvjc,"I think it's kind of like a ticklish part of your body is to you. Whiskers are a highly sensitive 'detector' for feeling vibrations in the air (source: im talking out my ass) and for feeling if a space that they are sticking their head into would be big enough for them to crawl through (source: I think I heard it once). So, highly sensitive instrument. Could be kinda irritating if something you didn't understand kept fuzzing up the signals from it. But if the kitty understands that it is being shown affection then I expect it might just be a more intense way to feel the affection."
zkiller195,fdgpksz,t1_fdgkvjc,"I've never heard this before. Most cats I know love face rubs, which will always involve touching their whiskers.

The only thing like that I've ever heard specific about cat whiskers is that you aren't supposed to cut them if you cut your cat's hair, since they use them for balance."
Xepphy,fdgtwz6,t1_fdgkvjc,"You can touch them just fine as long as the cat likes it and you're not ""breaking"" them.

For instance, my cat likes when I pull them and amb them make noises with her drool. Cats are weird."
RegularWhiteShark,fdgrjx9,t1_fdgkvjc,"I mean, I don’t play with my cats whiskers specifically, but if I’m fussing their faces and cheeks, their whiskers get touched as well. They don’t mind. 

As others have said, depends on the cat."
FearLeadsToAnger,fdgs1rd,t1_fdgkvjc,My cat isn't a fan of when I bump his whiskers or eye-brow whiskers so I gotta avoid em when I give him the face rubs he needs to survive.
shivumgrover,fdgtnqw,t1_fdgkvjc,For my kitty lightly touching the whiskers is a no-no as he gets irritated by it but stroking it or basically scratching some itch away on the whisker's area is enjoyed a lot
Vrassk,fdh7tc7,t1_fdgkvjc,Cats have sent glands in their cheeks and nerves endings that give pleasure when rubbed. Rubbing their cheeks like that is like a deep tissue massage for us.
pandafiestas,fdh86sn,t1_fdgkvjc,Every cat I’ve ever had has loved face rubs. I rub the side of their face starting at their nose/whiskers and softly following the whisker/face. Like how a cat rubs its face on stuff.

ClassicExit,fdgppry,t1_fdglsdh,"Or some go completely the other way, went round to someone's house and their cat just flopped down in front of me and went full ""I want belly rubs"""

I think it depends on the preference"
BrakForPresident,fdgpi19,t1_fdglsdh,Understandable. I'm the same way.
Kcthonian,fdizbuw,t1_fdgry2e,"I back up your info with my own sources (books on cat behavior and anatomy). I also add my own facts found in those same sources:

1) The whiskers help a cat form a mental 3d model of objects in front of them. In other words, in an odd way they can sort of ""see"" the backside of an object directly in front of them. 

2) Along with increased hearing, the whiskers can help them sense prey they can't see with their eyes. (Ex: A mouse inside a wall.)

3) Their sight is different from ours. They do see colors, but colors are less vibrant. Red and pink would be basically the same for them. Blues, greens and yellows are more vibrant for most cats. Nature seems to give them a bonus in exchange though, because they can see the ultraviolet light spectrum.

4) They have a sort of secondary scent gland in their mouth that picks up pheromones. If you see a cat with it's mouth open and tounge up, that's what its doing; ""super-smelling"" something. 

5) I don't *think* this kitty is happy. Cats can be unique but stroking whiskers backwards so fast would cause *most* cats to be VERY overstimulated and overwhelmed... not in a positive way. Think about sticking your head out the window of a car travelling 80 miles an hour and the pressure of that wind. You might twitch too, but the wouldn't necessarily mean you like it."

It’s not nearly as often, but sometimes it activates her playtime mode and she turns it into a game. She’s a little weird."
AssymetricManBoob,fdizqv3,t1_fdizbuw,"Isn't the alternating paw clenches a pretty sure sign that this kitten is feeling pretty good? I trust you way more than my guess but I don't know if I've ever seen a cat do that except when it's really happy. I've heard that sometimes purring is actually a sign of nerves though, I don't know if this could be a similar sign."

Irethius,fdgxkw6,t1_fdgr1d5,"Cats show their bellies as a sign of trust, to not touch their belly."
Eggplantosaur,fdh428t,t1_fdgtjg2,So you're saying your dog likes to be spanked?
Kcthonian,fdklouw,t1_fdizqv3,"You heard correctly. The paw clenches (kneading) are like purring. In kitty language, purring and kneading are like singing a lullaby. Mother cats purr to comfort their young and newborn kittens knead while suckling in order to help the mother's milk flow. Yes, *in general* it is a good social signal. But think of how we humans react in extremely high stress situations. We start doing ""happy things"" to comfort ourselves. A religious person might start saying a favorite prayer, or someone might sing a favorite song, or might hum a childhood nursery rhyme. Or we might smile and laugh cynically. Smiles and laughter are generally good social signs but in a stressful or upsetting situation we aren't actually happy. We're simply trying to cope with the highly stressful situation.

A cat will do the same exact thing. During high stress or painful moments they use those gestures as coping mechanisms to deal with the situation. An injured cat will sometimes knead and purr for example. I've seen examples of it before (had many multiple cats since I was born and have spent most of my life ""working"" with animals). A mother cat in labor will even purr sometimes. 

So, yes. It could be a signal the kitten is highly stressed."
Ayubus741,fdhohgc,t1_fdgxkw6,"My cat would let me pet her belly for like 2 seconds then push my hand away, but everytime I pet her belly, she always purred really loudly."

rachelsqueak,fdgqar4,t3_el8dkx,"Kittens will knead (""make biscuits"") when they are anxious. I read that cats tremble when they are anxious, too. This kitten GIF is very cute! I just hope everything is okay, there. 💜

Here's an article about things cats do when anxious:

https://www.bustle.com/p/10-signs-your-cat-has-anxiety-what-you-can-do-about-it-8871966

I know that's not the most reputable source, but it's a good list."
Angela831,fdgrut0,t1_fdgqar4,"
That doesn't seem right.  The majority of reasons are linked to positive things, not straight up anxiety.  
The kneading is something they do to comfort themselves or when they're getting to sleep.  They can do it when they're content and relaxed and sometimes suckle like they did when they were little.

I have 6 cats  (all of them I rescued myself) and have rescued, raised and rehomed nearly 50, so I have a pretty good idea on cat behavioural habits.
They have more reason than most to be full of anxiety, considering the start of their lives but they're not stressed in the slightest."

I try to post this in these sorts of threads, because there's always someone whose dog is getting old, and they're trying to make that hard decision

Hey, for all those of you who remember putting your pet down:

You're not 'putting them down'. You're helping them let go.

The problem is that your dog refuses to let go. You need them, there they are. Always. And not just when you need them, but when you're on the computer, or sitting on the couch. Your dog is there, because that's what they do.

Dogs don't know how to ask to be let go: It's not in a dog's nature to leave a man behind, so to speak. You gotta be the one to tell them it's okay, and you're not leaving.

You don't put them down. You pay them back for all the love they've given you.

Just do me a favour, if you're making that trip to the vet's: Hold your dog's paw when he's gotta go. Don't leave him in a room full of strangers because you're scared. Help him go."

Had one land in my back yard a few years back that seemed unable to fly. Went to pick it up and the screech, my god. Ended up putting ear muffs on and ushered it in to a large cage in my back yard that had previously housed pigeons. I tried to observe it to see if there were any breaks, everything seemed fine, there was nothing it could have hit it just didn't seem interested in flying. Climbed up the cage without flying, etc.

Its buddies ended up turning up and hanging around my yard. I was dealing with a funeral at the time so it sat in the cage for about 3 days and its buddies sat on my neighbours fence shrieking.

Eventually my neighbours came over and I had time to try and take it to a vet. We opened the door to grab it and it just flew off over our heads simple as that. I think I saw it 2 or 3 more times - well I assume it was the same bird, it seemed to hang around on the ground more than the others, then never saw one like it again. Hope it did ok, they can live ~90 years and it would be a shame if its time got cut short."

It's utterly deafening. You can't walk under these trees while they're there or you'll get crapped on. You can't park your car under any of the trees that overhang the carpark or your car will become white. The park isn't nice to go to anymore because it stinks of bird shit.

However, cheetahs are more lightly built than cougars. Cheetahs average 21–72 kg, while cougars weigh between 29 to 100 kg, with most variation in cougars depending on sex. Cheetahs show far less sexual dimorphism than other large cats."
UrNot_MySupervisor,fdlfbk1,t1_fdldg6j,"Cheetahs are between 46-160lbs. A cougar is 64-220lbs. While technically you could have a large cheetah that is bigger than a small cougar, on average they are much smaller, and are therefore considered to be the smaller species."
Divenity,fdlg3l8,t1_fdldg6j,"They grow to about the same height, but Cougars have longer bodies and can weigh much more (male Cougars cap out at around 220lbs/100kg while Cheetahs only get up in the 160lbs/73kg range), as Cheetahs are lithe and built for speed while Cougars are much more muscular."

Then we adopted a 4 week old kitten.  Within days she completely turned around.  She's much more affectionate in general, doesn't get mad at my daughter for anything, and just seems so much happier.  You can tell the kitten (now 2 years old) drives her up the wall and she'll do anything to get away from him at times, but she'll also seek him out to lay down and sleep next to him or groom him.  He hasn't quite figured out how to open doors, and any time they get separated she'll help him out."

In our profession its not healthy to be afraid all the time. It adds to your stress and impacts your efficency. Fear causes you to make mistakes, and we cant afford to make any.

I've been scared shitless the first time i had to interact with elephants. After a while it becomes more of a ""lets get it over with""-attitude.

I would personally never interact with a mature lion like that women did. Too many things that can go wrong. 
Iam more of a birds guy anyway."
trueblueozguy,fdskpmc,t1_fdsgimi,Does an animal know that you are there to help them? I mean i’ve heard many times that animals know instinctively and can read humans’ feelings. Is that the case?
Pohtate,fdu70pj,t1_fdsgimi,"I don't work with wild animals but I do have a large array of species at home. I don't have anywhere the amount of experience but I've found its getting TOO comfortable doing whatever is what gets you. Once your attention lapses, that's it, you're chomped."
Dektarey,fdstz7a,t1_fdskpmc,"Yes and no. We're discouraged from forming a true bond with the animal we're working with, because that'd would lead to issues once other employees have to interact with that animal.

They're fully aware that the men in green dont intend to harm them, and because of that, they only show aggression in very special circumstances. We dont need a level of blind trust to do our job. While it would make things easier, it takes too long in most cases to be worth it.

Of course everyone here has their own favorites. I raised a falcon that we took in, because her wild habitat burned down. She cant really leave our supervision, because her old injuries prevent her from properly taking flight. So she stays in her own little (really not) habitat with all she could ever need. Because i raised her she's rather affectionate towards me, while shy at best towards others.

Now we have the problem that she wont take food from anyone but me. She's grown dependent on me, because we didnt switch up whoever takes care of her when she was young. This really isnt what we want.

But i've railed of a bit. To answer your question properly: They dont. They learn after a while though, and become more relaxed around you. Thats also why everyone has to wear deep green colored clothing. It makes it easier for the animal to connect the man in green with the other man in green that just recently fed them.

They dont just know when youre afraid, but they can read your posture, revealing when you are. You can be afraid like a little child, but if you know to control your posture, they wont be aware."

Flagellanten,fe19x80,t1_fe03xxy,"Mine kicked the bucket last spring. Had him since i was 4, and he was already a couple years old when i got him. So the fecker was at least 24 years old. Sure as hell looked like it, he even survived cat plague and was mute half way through his life. His tail was also practically rectangle shaped from all the arthritis. Best. cat. ever.

The veterinarian said he would die within years after he got over the plague. He lived on for another 13 years. This is why some veterinarians are best left to their testicle snipping and staying quiet."

Enjoy every moment, as I’m sure you are, and when the time comes, allow yourself to grieve, but also celebrate that because of you and the relationship that you shared, this wonderful soul was allowed to blossom and live a long, happy and healthy life, knowing how loved they always were.  When I think of my cat, someone reminded me to say “thank you” to her in my mind. I’m so thankful I had the experience of loving her every day and so blessed to have had her in my life for so long. I’ve been sad, but the blow is softened over time knowing how lucky I’ve been, and how lucky she was too.  A lot of animals live and die without ever experiencing a love like that. A lot of humans too."

Winteresche,fe1dr92,t1_fe11rb7,"Make sure they get wet food, not just dry kibble. Male cats especially have a habit of not drinking enough, so this helps prevent kidney and UTI problems. 
Get regular check ups and make sure they stay mentally agile (playing, introducing novelty items, maybe even leash training and such) 
If you have a single cat without outdoor access (I recommend cat secured garden tho) a second cat can do wonders for them, especially if they're alone for longer stretches 
I'm sure you'll do good by them :)"
YippeeKai-Yay,fe1os2a,t1_fe11rb7,"To be honest we didn’t do anything, she had a problem peeing on everything so she was an outdoor cat that we would give flea & parasite medicine for over 10 years until just a few years ago when we brought her inside during a freezing winter. She’s been pretty chill since then and not peeing. She doesn’t need help getting around or anything, I even see her hoof it around when she needs too, not that fast though ha.

We say that because we adopted him at 8, he was alone in a house with a ball of socks for toys and a crappy kennel. I miss him more and more each day and my mom does too. 

I feel so glad we got him and I cannot wait to find out if he went to sleep happy and glad to be around us.

But seeing this, makes me feel better that she is living a great life and I hope she lives up to be 20. You doing awesome, you big boy! Thank you for the reminder that you guys live long and meaningful lives! 😭"

chestypocket,fe3k6hv,t3_enhx9o,"What a beautiful kitty! I really love the almost-Batman shape on his nose!

It’s always so good to see older kitties getting recognition like this. A lot of people don’t realize that cats can easily make it into their mid to late teens or beyond, because outdoor kitties often have shorter lifespans. I grew up with a steady rotation of indoor/outdoor cats, and the only one that lived past 10 was the one that just decided one day that she was an indoor cat and never left the house again. She lived to 17, and was healthy and energetic up until her last month. Now that I’m an adult and I know better, my kitties are indoor only, and I see such a huge difference in their health, energy level and attitude. My older cat is 8 years old and is still running around like a kitten, and it breaks my heart when I think of her age because even though I know better, there’s still a little piece of my brain that thinks of an 8-year-old cat as being near the end of its lifespan."
horizons0,fe3n6ey,t1_fe3k6hv,"Thank you very much!  

Yeah he was an outdoor cat in his younger years so we are fortunate that nothing happened to him. As he got older though he barely goes out anymore, I presume just to go to the toilet and come back in."

When I first got my little kitty I was convinced she would reach 20... her entire life, except for some cat acne, she never had any issues.
Then at 16 she got an aggressive cancer in her mouth which took hold of her in just 5 months... it was so heart breaking watching my healthy girl go from so lively like a kitten to exhausted and barely eating. I had to make a hard decision and lost her at 16... miss her like crazy. But I'm still convinced if she hadn't got that cancer...she would still be here with me."

imsaneinthemembrane,feab2am,t1_fe9yrq5,Mine did the same. Dog and I (internally) freaked the f out while I tried to gently remove it. He ended up turning it with his paws and it popped off super easily but still the scariest 5 minutes.
NotMrMike,feaylmj,t1_fe9yrq5,"In a plot twist, my dog got one stuck *inside* his mouth. He managed to get it wedged hard between his upper teeth and I had to use a blunted knife as a lever to un-wedge it. Weirdest doggo problem I've had to deal with."

Raelah,feb9iyr,t1_fea20gj,"I used to work at an emergency clinic. We often times had dogs come in for this very reason. I'm happy you were able to remove it without needing to go to the vet! It can be a very stressful experience for the dog, often times requiring sedation."

crazycatnplantlady,febfuwj,t3_eo6tx2,"Please be careful, honestly I’d take this away for two reasons:

1, can’t tell you how many times I’ve had to sedate and saw off the bone because it was stuck on the dogs mandible.

2, real bones fracture teeth,most commonly the upper fourth premolar, resulting in needing a (preferably) root canal treatment (will cost you about $1400), or extraction. Saving this tooth is ideal because it is a major chewing tooth. However, they do usually do just fine without it... but end up fracturing the opposite side eventually because they’ll just be compensating and chewing more on the other side. :)"
birdpack,fec6wek,t1_febfuwj,"I'll be adopting a medium-large breed puppy later this year,  and I've seen so many conflicting comments about bones, rawhide, and other chewing treats. Do you, or anyone, know what is actually safe for them to have? I wish there was a better guideline out there for the do's and don'ts of dog chews...but it seems like one site will say 'no to X', while another gives the same product a thumbs up. It's maddening!!"
4horses,fecad85,t1_fec6wek,My general rule of thumb is to give something you can depress a fingernail into. And that chews should only be given under supervision.
crazycatnplantlady,fecam35,t1_fec6wek,"Yes, I usually tell people if they think it’s too hard for themselves to chew on then don’t give it to the dog. You can test a toy by seeing if you can indent your fingernail in it. If not, it is too hard."
crazybluegoose,fecpmqz,t1_fec6wek,"I like the other comments given below for puppies (be able to depress a fingernail into it - at least a little). 

For older dogs that are tough chewers, we really like Nylabone. Just watch for any pink (signs of blood) and take it away if that happens. That means they are getting a little too aggressive and tearing up gums. 

Nylabone also makes different toys. Softer ones and the harder ones."

When I was a vet tech working in emergency clinics we would often times have dogs come in with their lower jaw stuck in the middle of the bone. Most dogs come in in a panic and require heavy sedation depending on how stuck the bone is.

Don't want your handsome pup to have to go through that!"

ShaneFerguson,fdzy48j,t3_enfr6n,It's a beautiful moment but am I the only one who finds these videos somewhat problematic? He's a little kid having an intensely emotional moment. Perhaps he'd prefer that stay private instead of being posted for all the world to see. Should I assume that he's consented for the video to be posted online?
roland_of_g,fe04mai,t1_fdzy48j,"Also, if i'm the big bro, I should know that he might get emotional at my return.  Why set him up to cry in front of his class and on video?  Seems like some showboating goin on..  Do it in private amiright?"
thinkabouttheirony,fe0o3cf,t1_fdzy48j,"If someone did this to me when I was 10 and I ended up crying in front of the whole school I would have been traumatized for life, literally. I would never get over the embarrassment, and I know I would have been mocked by other students mercilessly. Then again I was an unpopular and very insecure child."
jp_lolo,fe0f9yt,t1_fe04mai,"Not everyone feels their emotional side needs to stay private, especially when it's happy emotion. Feeling like society wants us to hide our joy, or even our pain, can lead to oppression. Others empathize with this moment and good things can come from experiencing it vicariously."
ShaneFerguson,fe07a81,t1_fe04mai,I agree that it makes more sense to do it in private. You can still surprise the kid and have the emotional reunion but there's no reason it needs to be done in public. Little kids likely wouldn't understand the intensity of the emotion he's feeling and may tease him for the show of emotion which is exactly what shouldn't happen
woody1130,fe1puzt,t1_fe0o3cf,"Maybe, maybe not. On the one hand you might have gotten emotional but on the other you are quite a young kid (like your school friends) and your big army serving brother is why you’re crying. Hopefully the bullies would make the connection and not bother you. It also helps show firsthand what having a relative in the army is like, and hopefully the others gain a bit of insight emotionally. I think this is a very “to each their own” situation. I like to assume the adult actors have taken this into account before hand and assessed if this was ok for this child"
themettaur,fe0cnvl,t1_fe07a81,"You don't know that family, that kid. You don't know what's best for him, everyone is different. I agree that *I* wouldn't be super jazzed about this, but that doesn't mean it was cruel, or that it was showboating or ""problematic""."

We were both into video games but he would show me something new and we would throw down all the time, well he would, I had to watch. We did other things as well during his stay there. Then he had to leave, I couldn't handle it. I had 4 older sisters but it was nothing like having your older brother around. He sets the standard for growing up, not having him in your life you feel so alone.. 

Im 38 now, he's 54. We hang out once in a while but that connection will always be there, even though Ill probably never acknowledge it publicly.."

Sapiencia6,fdkeptp,t1_fdju9zx,Reminds me of my dog. I swear she does not listen to voice commands at all when she thinks she's getting a treat and she's excited. She just starts frantically doing everything I've ever trained her to do until she hopefully gets it right. I tried at one point to teach her to sit up and beg and she did really well for a while until she started thinking jumping up on you was the same thing so I'm trying to get her to forget that one.

Place your hand near his elbow, slide it towards the paw picking his paw up to where you want it in the process. Then say the word as you do the thing you want him to do, his paw in your hand and you verbally repeating ""shake"" multiple times. Then let go, say good boy and give him a treat. 

Don't just expect the dog to figure it out. Manually show them what you want. I taught a 3 month old puppy to shake in about 5 minutes and he learned other paw on literally the first try. High Five took 3 or 4 tries. I never could teach him roll over or beg though."

We had a Rhodesian Ridgeback.  Wicked smart, but almost no interest in learning repeatable playlike behaviors (ok with sit, heel obedience, because that was ""working"" maybe? - or maybe we just weren't good trainers) 

A friend got him to shake, then went for ""high 5"" - took a giant paw to the middle of the face.  It was very hard not to give him lots of ""good boys"" but I think all the laughing accomplished the same thing."

3rickEsca,fdk6nkw,t1_fdjsc27,"Some ex friends of ours had huskys that were out of control. They have so much energy. We invited them to stay at our home years ago on a new years eve, and the next morning they let one of their dogs loose in our yard (later telling us they ""escaped"") and it ripped into our coop and killed 1 or our 3 chickens. 🙁 My wife witnessed it from a window and she was shook up. Ever since, I just can't condone anyone getting a husky without spending REAL time properly training and exercising your husky. I have a hound/lab who was gentle with our chickens and such a good boy. They also would attack him. It was a shitty way to start the new year."

I didn't introduce chickens to my dog until he was about 8 years old and he was fine. No extra needed training or anything. My point is that I've been hearing a lot of people saying they want a husky, but they aren't aware of the work that goes into training. Before I adopted my dog I did a shit ton of research because I had a childhood dalmatian that destroyed everything and I didn't want that in my life. Fortunately because of my research I was able to identify personality traits when ""shopping"" for a dog. I was instantly attracted to my dogs lower energy level, but still waggy tail and listening abilities. He's my best friend. 😊 I love dogs too much to see people adopt them without knowing what they're getting into. Please do your research and plan on spending hours a day training."

Initially, you teach the dog to shake with rewards of snacks/pats. So, this conditions your dog to think that shaking means treats or pats.

What happens then is you are doing the dishes and your big ass dog is scratching your leg wanting to shake amd get treats. Therefore; you shouldn't teach you dog to shake.

Does anyone have a rebuttle to this? I mean, shaking isn't a necessary trick to learn"

All he has to do is sit patient while I get it out for him. 

The only time my dog will try and shake when I haven't told him to is when I have his ball. I used to make him shake for it, but we've been working on other stuff. Sometimes he'll get fed up and try the ole reliable shake tactic but it doesn't work."

It is wonderful to meet someone else who does the same thing. Many people don't understand why I do it with all of the time and expense of caring for them. But he shows why in his videos. I went to his Instagram site..the way the cats love on him while he plays the piano is so utterly special. Thank you so much for posting this it means so much to me. What country is he in?

PS: I don't understand why people used to trim their ears, they are so much cuter with the natural ears."
Babaluba2,fdx82nm,t1_fdw9jkg,"Some dog breed benefit from trimmed ears and docked tails, but the vast majority of the time nowadays they're entirely unneeded. Sometimes pitbulls have their tails docked if they get happy tail syndrome (where their tails wag so hard or hit things so hard that they break and become mangled), but unless it's a working dog or a dog with chronic severe ear infections/happy tail syndrome, theres likely no need to dock tails or ears and it's purely aesthetic. Thankfully unnecesary docking has seen a decline in recent years! Hopefully we see a day where people dont dock just because ""no tail make dog look scary"" and whatever other crap goes through their heads"
ninjaoftheworld,fdwdwr6,t1_fdw9jkg,And their little whippy tails!
SkipTheStorms,fdyovhy,t1_fdx82nm,"This! I get compliments from time to time about my pit being ""natural"" and I'm just like well, he hasn't had a medical reason to have the work done but if that day ever comes then you best believe he'll be getting it done. The number of people I have argued with over that is insane and one guy even said I was cruel for ever thinking my dog would need it. I like to live in reality though and honestly don't understand how the hell he hasn't done serious damage to the tail with how hard he hits things with it."
Babaluba2,fdyu1yr,t1_fdyovhy,"Exactly, some dogs really do just need it. Half the people who say tail docking should never ever be done to a dog in any circumstance hasn't seen a dog who has hit their tail so hard against things that it is battered, broken, brused, and sometimes even gashed open and bleeding. I get not wanting any dog to have its tail docked and it should always be a last ditch effort, but sometimes its impossible to avoid and some people just gotta know that. Boxers are real bad about smacking their tails against things until they break and bleed everywhere, break it too many times and slice it open too many times and there's so many chances of infection and complete nerve damage (which only perpetuates the problem, dog can't feel the tail hitting things, dog doesn't know it's hurt, dog keeps whacking bloody broken tail on things), it results in the tail just needing to be docked. It sucks, but it's a sad reality for some people and their dogs and ultimately it leads to a happier life for the dog than constantly breaking it's tail"

frannyGin,fdz55m6,t1_fdz1yke,I wouldn't automatically attribute that to the dog before hearing about the circumstances that made it snap. With aggression (and that applies to dogs and humans as well) there's usually a history to consider.
MysticMint,fdzddal,t1_fdz55m6,"there was a news story about a pit killing his owner when she had a seizure. I just don't know why people take the risk with those dogs. Don't get me wrong, I love dogs a lot, but I think we should stop breeding pitbulls."
frannyGin,fdziu22,t1_fdzddal,"Well, that's not enough info for me to firm any opinion based on your story so I keep my stance that pit bills just as every other breed can excel as long as the owner puts in enough effort training the dog properly and forming a bond of trust. Nurture generally has a bigger impact than nature so if you feel capable to have a dog than you know about the risks and can decide for yourself if it's worth it."

Congratulations! Y’all look like a really happy family :)"
RedShirtDecoy,fe4240j,t1_fe2uz0e,"I'm not OP but I asked my Dad to adopt me when I was 34 and it was made official when I was 35.  While I've considered him my Dad since I was a teenager making it official really did affect me emotionally, and it seems to have affected him as well.  We haven't really talked about why because he is a super stoic personality but just knowing that we both agreed to the adoption really makes you feel genuinely accepted. What I mean by that is he seems to really appreciate that I made the choice to make it official.  He wasn't legally my dad because I have his genes, he was legally my dad because I made the choice to ask him to be.  

Not only that, but as someone who dealt with the mental aftermath of a bio-father who said he wanted to be in my life/loved me but never made the effort, having my Dad say yes to being my legal Dad was a huge part of the healing process for me.  When I originally asked him I didn't think it would make that much of a difference because I already considered him my Dad but as soon as I saw his name on my birth certificate it like a festering wound finally healed."
numbah10,fe2y2hc,t1_fe2uz0e,I had a friend do this not long ago. She said it affected things like disqualifying her for power of attorney for her bio dad and I wanna say there were inheritance implications as well.
muffinyipps13,fe2v896,t1_fe2uz0e,Perhaps he doesnt want to carry on his biological dads last name and this comes with a name change? Just a thought
rightnowl,fe3tv1o,t1_fe2uz0e,"Legally speaking, OP officially became his dad's child (in some states), and therefore becomes eligible to inherit under his state's intestate succession laws if OP's dad doesn't leave a will. Obviously, OP's dad could have provided for an inheritance through a will without adopting him, but this provides an added layer of legal protection so that OP can keep his dad's things in case the will is declared invalid or other complications."

TippyShip,fe3ihap,t1_fe2x7w1,"That’s not true. I’m both an adult adoptee and a paralegal. Inheritance rights are changed by it, next of kin status and the ability to make decisions for that person if they are unable to, down to having a say in their funeral arrangements if need be. There are several important, non emotional, reasons to do an adult adoption."
flashcats,fe4bv18,t1_fe2x7w1,"Disagree. 

It’s important for things like inheritance."
cozichooseto,fe49724,t1_fe43s60,It goes both ways.
mmesuds,fe48god,t1_fe47rup,"So I was adopted as a child by my step dad. My birth certificate was changed to show my adopted dad as the father, but I also got a certificate of the adoption and of my bio dad giving up his legal rights and all that. 
So, at least in Ohio, there is (was?) A way to have a paper trail of the whole event even though the birth certificate was changed."
bigsmackchef,fe4b4g5,t1_fe47rup,"My wife changed her name when we got married and they issued her a new birth certificate ( Ontario ).  we both thought that was weird for the same reason,  it feels like rewriting history.  she was actually a bit upset about it because she didn't know that would happen.    


If anyone is in a similar situation what she could have done was just assumed a new name rather than legally change it.  That way she could use the new name legally but wouldn't have had a new birth certificate printed."
RedShirtDecoy,fe4ilz3,t1_fe47rup,"It's just like an adoption of a minor, he became my legal father in the eyes of the law.  Based on that my birth certificate would need to be updated with his name since it is a legal document listing my ""father"".  

As for future generations it shouldn't really affect them.  The only future generations are my now legal nieces and nephews.  I myself have no kids, I'm single, I'm in the later half of my 30's, and have no plans on having kids.  I'm far more happy being an aunt than being a mom.  

If I did have kids it would be more of a benefit to them than not since legally they would be connected to my dad than if the adoption hadn't happened.  In the eyes of the law they would be considered grandkids instead of step-grandkids."

Valreesio,fe4brq2,t1_fe48god,"That's good (In my eyes) that everything has the trail. I hope sites like ancestry.com and such have the trail on them as well. 

All of that being said, congratulations on the adoption. Being able to make it legal and the emotions you spoke of must be a wonderful feeling and a good lesson to your (possibly) children."
Valreesio,fe4e1ia,t1_fe4b4g5,"Wow? For being married? Maybe it's a Canada thing? My wife here in the states got a new social security card with a last name change, but I don't think it changed her birth certificate."
picardstastygrapes,fe4kd56,t1_fe4b4g5,You don't have to get a new birth certificate when you change your name on Ontario. There are a few different options. I changed everything but my birth certificate.

bronzemerald,fe61xaa,t3_ennrhk,"Custody of my brother and I were removed from our biological parents when I was 7 and he was 9 (Crack Cocaine is a hell of a drug). Custody was granted to my mother's cousin, whom later became our guardian. Stellar guy, single parent to us, owned a private school that taught 1st and 2nd grade which I attended because he opened a 3rd grade. He gave up his life to raise us. After everything he'd done for us. After high school, despite everything he and I had gone through,  my brother got into hard drugs and died of a heroin overdose at 27, of all ages. 

My guardian, whom I call Dad in order to simplify things in my life, had recently been diagnosed with cancer, had an operatio, and is now recovering, cancer free. While in the hospital, he had mentioned that, since I'm not legally his son, we won't be able to enjoy similar medical privileges as biological father and sons like hospital visitations without his consent. That is, in the event he's hospitalized, unconscious, he can't give consent for me, and vice versa.

It's stories like these of sons who arrange adoptions after age 18 (I'm 31) that inspire me to do the same thing with my dad, because he's simply my DAD."
snoopychick8,fe6ahhq,t1_fe61xaa,"i dont know where you live but your father can totally assign you as a power of attorney or decision maker in the event that he cannot make decisions or is unconscious.....most lawyers will do up a legal document so that you can do that. If you are the person he wants to help him make decisions medically or financially and he has a lawyer write this up, health care professionals have to respect it.  Most places also allow you to write one up free of charge (online for instance).  some places it is called a power of attorney, others call it living will, others maybe substitute decision maker."
The_Crying_Banana,fe6gakj,t3_ennrhk,And we will never be equal!
CesaroSalad,fe6pvxv,t3_ennrhk,"To answer some commonly asked questions here:

* We waited so long for the adoption for many reasons, 1 because we wanted to wait until we were sure there would be no pushback from my biological father, 2 financial reasons, 3 we are lazy and it was more of a formality/gesture at this point.

* The shirt I am wearing is a offical WWE shirt made for pro wrestler Aleister Black, if you like his style check out his personal clothing line ""BLXCK MASS"" in conjuction with Blackcraft Cult Clothing.

* My family does not have a pig, my Mom just loves pigs, although they do have several chickens and a dog.

* Yes we had smoked QUITE a few ""jazz cigarettes"" before this picture was taken.

* No, my Dad is not your piercer, it seems he must have a doppleganger.

Also, thank you for all of the love and well wishes, I must admit I was surprised to see this blow up as much as it did."
Soda444,fe41524,t3_ennrhk,"I have a question. I understand that this is a sweet gesture and lends towards cohesion of the family group but, as a legal adult is there some reason or advantage to doing this legally (as opposed to it being a feel-good or social thing)?"
sot1l,fe49gl6,t1_fe41524,"My best guess would be that in times of emergency or illness, and adopted adult ‘child’ would be called on to be a part of legal decisions that a step-child or spouse’s child would not be?  

e.g.  dad is unconscious and there is a medical treatment consent to be signed.  If only the step child is around perhaps they wait for another family member, delaying treatment, BUT if fully legal son is present, he can sign for dad??  

Total guess, but the best I can come up with"

CypressBreeze,fdzvbq2,t1_fdz73ny,"I have met someone who has two pet river otters and has an otter cafe.
They are:
Adorable 
FULL of energy ALL THE TIME
They hardly ever even stop moving 
They are NOISY 
High maintenance 
They are super attached to their owners, sleep in their bed.

She said they don’t like to go to the bathroom without her coming with, especially at night.
They wake her up to go pee just like little kids.
One time she tried to ignore it and it peed on her face in her sleep."
memebuddy_,fdzw2uj,t1_fdz73ny,"Because they're vicious. I'm an aquarium volunteer and the North American river otters are one of, if not the, most dangerous animal there. Handling them requires specialized training and gear because of how ferocious they can be. They have very very strong jaws and teeth for eating shelled organisms like mollusks and crabs, and retractable claws. Feeding them at the aquarium usually means standing behind a gate and tossing food into the habitat. For comparison, the alligators are sometimes fed/checked up on with the biologists hanging out in the habitat. See the other reply for how wack otters are in the wild."

If one of the vets needed to examine an adult there were nets and towels and emergency plans and several people involved.
frenchieRU,fe07w7w,t1_fdzw2uj,"This. Another (former) aquarium volunteer here! Stories of otter viciousness definitely get passed around the marine mammal training community. Someone I knew told me a story from another institution about someone who was suuuuper obsessed with otters, so her friend (an otter keeper) brought the person close to the enclosure, where the person could get up close but both still mostly behind a barrier. She put her face close (but still a few inches away) to the enclosure, otter bit off the end of her nose.  It contributes to my running theory that the cuter something is, the bigger of a jerk it is. Another example? Lorikeets. So cute and they look like they basically ate a bag of skittles. Get to know them a little bit and you’ll find out they can aim their poops and will poop on you just because they find the reaction entertaining."

mtcwby,fdobrao,t3_eme72k,Enjoying the future dropper of food. We didn't realize how messy our youngest son ate until we lost our Malamutes.  They would lay down on either side of the high chair and later the chair.
Choppergold,fdoi171,t1_fdobrao,This is an under appreciated feature of dogs. Toddler chairs are legit trash sites
stray_girl,fdotr95,t1_fdobrao,I purposely “drop” random things for my dogs. I threw some crackers on the floor of my office the other day before I remembered- my dogs don’t work there.
Akabander,fdolu2z,t1_fdobrao,"Without knowing more, I'm sorry for your loss.

We had a poodle mix that could literally hoover milk out of a carpet. So many spills, and never any sour milk smell. Dogs are one of the few things that make me question my atheism."
GuineveresGrace,fdp33xm,t1_fdobrao,"My parents bred chocolate labs until I was a toddler (apparently the puppies and I ganged up, and that was chaos no one could handle).

The story goes that the adult Labs weren’t a fan of me until I started dropping food from the high chair. The way to a Lab’s heart is truly though their stomach! We were best buddies after that, and they were exceptionally loyal to the Dropper of Food."
hellsno,fdp7z3r,t1_fdobrao,"When my son was 3, he spilled an entire bag of goldfish crackers on his grandparents' floor, then calmly looked around and said, ""They got a dog here?"""
upvoteforyouhun,fdp4nhx,t1_fdobrao,"My Pomeranian has gained 3 lbs in the 1.25 years of my daughters life. He’s fine and within his normal, but on a diet now."
BeautifulRelief,fdoy2k7,t1_fdobrao,"Our high chair is more of a booster that sits on the table with a tray. After supper, we just put it on the floor. The dogs get every little bit of food in there and then I wipe it down with a disinfecting wipe. They’ve earned their keep."
NudlePockets,fdpn335,t1_fdobrao,"I nannied a kiddo from when she was 3 months old until about 2 years old. Her parents had 2 dogs and both of them were her constant shadows, especially during high chair time. She was so delighted by feeding the dogs and the dogs were equally delighted by the tiny human giving them treats. They’re still the best of friends and quite protective over their now slightly larger food giver."
Rymanjan,fdqezrr,t1_fdobrao,"My old lab Trav was the biggest chowhound, I used to call him the vacuum cleaner. You could drop a slice of tomato and he'd teleport from wherever he was lounging in the house to right there before you even knew it had hit the floor. Didn't care if it was edible or not, he was gonna try to eat it."
Scizmz,fdoj925,t1_fdoi171,Under appreciated?  This is the dogs job in my house. Bonus when he kills small rodents that wander into the back yard.
mtcwby,fdonfqk,t1_fdoi171,One of our jokes on plates after they were finished licking was that we could just put them back in the cupboard.  We didn't leave much of course and only let them have reasonable stuff but it helped our dishwasher last over twenty years.
mtcwby,fdotz4d,t1_fdotr95,We've caught ourselves saving a little bit of pizza crust when we aren't with the dog. They trained us. Of course pizza has always been a favorite. They never begged but would sit several feet away and reflexively drool.

If you didn't have dogs to do it you should be rinsing your plates before you put them in the dishwasher anyways; it will help it clean better because it won't just be spraying food all over the other dishes, and it's not like dishwashers have built in garbage disposals."

nebulus64,fdp04nc,t1_fdoz3fp,Does your dishwasher not have a filter?
Van_isle_lp,fdpqcra,t1_fdoz3fp,"Completely incorrect. Dishwasher detergents have enzymes in them to break food down. They actually clean better with food on the plates. It’s also a huge waste of water to pre-rinse. Scrape the big stuff off before loading only. And yes, some dishwashers still do have soft food disposals built in the bottom, but they’re lost favour in the industry as quiet dishwashers have become more and more desirable to consumers."
mtcwby,fdp17dk,t1_fdoz3fp,We don't put them in too dirty but we have kids and the dogs at the time left them polished.
FrazzledBear,fdpme6y,t1_fdoz3fp,"I’ve always viewed our dishwasher as more of a sanitation machine than anything else. Scrub the plates off and clean them and then sanitize in the dishwasher.

I always end up having to rewash everything anytime my mother-in-law visits and tries to help. She’ll just leave whole chunks of food on the plate and toss it in the dishwasher."

t0mm4n,fdousbv,t1_fdo98yd,"It's called false pregnancy, not uncommon with dogs. In wolfpacks it is beneficial when other females can nurse puppies, not just mother."

dmart891,fdosheq,t3_eme72k,My older Shiba inu died 2 months after we had our son and I think he only stayed alive beyond her pregnancy to see our son and tell our younger shiba he will be the protector now. My older shiba during her pregnancy was very protective of my wife and when our son was born he wouldn't let anyone near our son unless we were holding him. Our younger shiba now stays extremely close to our son all the time which is very uncharacteristic of the breed to be attached to a human they are usually very cat like.
kizzyjenks,fdox9d2,t1_fdosheq,"I don't know much about shibas, but I know a lot about cats, and they definitely do become attached to people. Female cats especially often pick one human who is ""theirs""."
Rein3,fdq1wx5,t1_fdosheq,I'm crying now. Thank you.
RunawayHobbit,fdpogoy,t1_fdox9d2,"My baby Lily basically imprinted on me. She comes running to the garage door when I get home from work and chirps to say hello. At night, she also cries and tries to break into the bedroom by shoving as much of herself under the door as she can fit—  we have to kick the cats out of the room precisely because Lily will only sleep curled up on my face, preferably with as little room for air as possible. Lol. When I take too long to wake up in the morning, she wakes me up by shoving her face under the door and crying as loudly as she can. If I get up before she does, I always open the door to find her sleeping curled up next to it, waiting for me. :)))

We’re attached at the hip. I think I’d probably die for that cat, which is a very strange thing to say as I’m normally much more pragmatic with animals."

jrayl10,fdoxab8,t3_eme72k,Any advice for an expectant dad with an 80 lbs german sheppard?
BeautifulRelief,fdoyo38,t1_fdoxab8,"Time. Positive reinforcement. Don’t punish or scold your dog for reacting in any negative way- that will often cause the dog to associate the baby with negative things. Try small visitations. If your dog starts acting weird or in a negative way, redirect the dog and come back later."
protracted_pause,fdpmtyg,t1_fdoxab8,"When your child is still in the hospital, bring a blanket baby has been wrapped in, or an article of clothing, home for your dog to sniff so they can get used to the scent. Have things like the crib or swing set up in advance so pup can sniff and get used to it. Have set times where pup gets one-on-one attention.  And don't leave baby unattended with your dog, no matter how much you trust him/her."
ReconScout117,fdp72ts,t1_fdoyo38,"This. So many people lose patience with their dogs when a newborn is brought into the home, and don’t try to understand what an upheaval it is to their animals. They’re labeled as aggressive and have a very difficult time being re-homed. Most will adopt the same protective instinct that their owners have after some initial trepidation. They feel some anxiety and react to that at first, but they eventually get it."
BeautifulRelief,fdpo6rp,t1_fdpmtyg,I would also recommend hiding a special treat with the baby blanket so they associate that scent with something great.
BeautifulRelief,fdpo3ue,t1_fdp72ts,"Yep. People tend to forget that they themselves have to adjust to a new baby too. It is totally unrealistic to expect any living creature to just immediately be adjusted to such a big change. 

My Jack Russell actually started to resource guard my daughter. It was incredibly challenging and, honestly, scary. But I had to have faith in her because I knew she would eventually get used to the baby. I was absolutely not going to abandon any one of my five because they needed a little extra time to adjust. I’m happy to report that now all of the dogs absolutely adore my daughter (I’m sure it doesn’t hurt that she always sneaks them bits of her snacks and dinner). Every one of them is extremely patient with her and are very gentle when they sneak some food out of her hand or are trying to “play” with her."
idkman1717,fdp7ehx,t3_eme72k,That dog shows why I love dogs so much.
LeftHandLike20,fdp7h3x,t3_eme72k,Do dogs have a sense of where the baby comes from? I’m surprised more dogs don’t go a little crazy with a new tiny human around!
hippieofinsanity,fdpcuy8,t1_fdp7h3x,"dogs are super socially inteligent animals. They definately understand that this is a new human pup from their owners.

&#x200B;

Some dogs will definately be very high energy and excitable, so they might go crazy, but a lot of dogs will have an extremely strong paternal/maternal instinct. It isn't uncomon for a lot of dogs to realize that the mom is preggers and get super protective of the mom, let alone once the kiddo is born."
Szaszaspasz,fdp7re3,t3_eme72k,It looks like the pup was hoping the new human would give pets as well.

paints_name_pretty,fdov3v4,t1_fdob7is,SCBA tanks and masks gives you about 15-25 mins of breathing air depending on your fitness. Wild land firefighting is a lot of movement and it’s in open space so SCBA isn’t needed and is strongly recommended not to have. You lose a lot of mobility with it on and a wild land fire can get real out of control quickly. Also once that air runs out you can’t exactly walk back and grab a new one if you’re inside the fire. SCBA is required for house fires where you can exit quickly.
imnotnewbutiamtoyou,fdpll43,t1_fdp0w4o,nice.

AmaTxGuy,fdomnrs,t1_fdoj4w3,It happens quite often. Australian firefighters were in California last year. And it's very common for municipalities to have emergency agreements with other local agencies. Cause small fires can become big fires fast and small towns can't afford to keep 30 firemen on staff.
breetome,fdoroyz,t1_fdoj4w3,"I live in the Northern California wine country.  In the past 3 years we've had horrific wild fires up here.  In 2017 we burned for close to a month.  Firefighters from all over the world and the country showed up to help us.  Even Australia, I'm glad we can return the favor. 

In 2017 the firefighters had a huge camp set up at our local fairgrounds.  Every chef, caterer and talented cook for miles lined up to cook gourmet meals for them.  Every time they were out in public doing anything they would be cheered non stop by all the locals.  Their money was no good in our local towns.  Every firefighter was treated to meals, drinks, etc.  Some of the local breweries had 'Buy a firefighter a beer' you could buy beers for them when they would come in after their shifts.  One brewery ended up with about 1,000 free beers for the firefighters!! After the fires were over they just passed it on to our locals firemen."
Pliind,fdoqprr,t1_fdoj4w3,In sweden we had polish firefighters come to our aid when our forests where burning up. :)
thefuzzybunny1,fdoqb4q,t1_fdoj4w3,"My grade school science teacher was a trained wilderness firefighter. We never knew when her state-issued beeper would ring and then off she'd be to California, or Pennsylvania, or whichever state was burning at the moment. Whenever she had to be away we'd watch training videos about wildfire prevention and fighting.

I can't say much for most of the science curriculum at my school, but I haven't started one wildfire yet, and I'm great at calling which way a storm is moving by watching cloud formations."
VagabondRommel,fdoqi7b,t1_fdoj4w3,"There were quite a few fires in Canada either last year or the year before right after the seasonal California fires and a bunch of Ameeican firefighters went up there to help. Its pretty common for volunteer firefighters to go to other states or countries because as they see it a fire is a fire wherever it is and if they can get there to fight it and prevent damage to wildlife and property as well as people and animals, well, theyre gonna do their jobs."
needanacc0unt,fdoxcz0,t1_fdoj4w3,"On a local level it's often automatic, if x fire department gets a call for their area but doesn't have available units and y fire department is closer/available, YFD gets it while XFD units from further away arrive. 

On a national level mutual aid definitely exists; my area fire departments are very well equipped for wildland fires and are going to out of state fires multiple times a year. They also get plenty of help from around the state when we need it."
restingbitchlyfe,fdp1nc1,t1_fdoj4w3,Canada does tradesies on occasion as we have pretty bad wildfire seasons in some regions many years.
Rhomya,fdp5ef2,t1_fdoj4w3,"It happens quite a bit.

Booney3721,fdphpq5,t1_fdoj4w3,"Yeah not on a scale of country to country, but when there has been a hurricane or major now storm hit, and a LOT of ppwer is out and such, electric companies from all across the United States come to help."
rinky79,fdqv7hp,t1_fdoj4w3,"Other types of utility do it too.  I worked for a small municipal electric company that had three line crews. When there was a major ice storm or windstorm elsewhere in the state, a crew would drive one of the City trucks 100+ miles to stay a couple of days and help work on getting power restored quickly."

Grimdarkwinter,fdpnf29,t1_fdomnrs,"The California San Francisco Bay Area had a raging fire in 1989 and we had to call in Australian firefighters because it turned out we had no chainsaws that could handle the eucalyptus trees that were fuelling the fire- American chainsaws were just getting gummed up with sap or something. 

I don't know how we went 60+ years without a major eucalyptus fire but apparently we had."
Silvea,fdpvaso,t1_fdomnrs,"We have a cabin up in the mountains. It’s a small mountain town with approximately 1000 residents. They have a volunteer firefighting group. So basically if a home catches fire they assemble and do their best to keep it from spreading. If they can get it out that’s a goal and a plus. Really it’s to mitigate as much damage as they can until the real fireman from 20-30 miles away can arrive. 

They have their own firehouse and such, but they contract with a near by department for bigger occasions because fully funding a fire house for 1000 people isn’t quite possible. 

We also do a similar thing with our police. We have a sheriff that lives in town and he’s the only one. However if he needs backup the main department rolls up to us. I think he works like 24/7, but also not that much because there is very little to no crime here."

Grimdarkwinter,fdqpseq,t1_fdqjle6,"I hear California brought in the super invasive Tasmanian Blue Gum about 150 years ago for windbreaks,  because they are fast growing, and those are the ones that have taken over the SF Bay Area. Unfortunately, they're fast growing. They have wood that's not good for using for anything because it twists and they seem to looove a hot fire, which the local landscape can't handle, which likes cooler, quicker fires.

(The history of Australian people in 1800s California is kind of interesting, too. People here *really* didn't like them.)

The only thing that's ever put them in check was a cold snap with snow that we had about ... 30 years go? I forget when it was, it was so long ago. 

We also have some other gum trees that aren't invasive and people like those. 

EDIT: this article says windbreaks and just for burning, since everything here, including heavy construction equipment, was steam powered back then.

But they worked in steep forested terrain with lots of beetle-killed trees and dry brush. Winds were often high and shifting, and relative humidity in the single digits. A village packed with Fourth of July visitors, as well as many other communities, were evacuated. 

Hundreds of people lost their homes on the west side of the Sangres; the fire just moved too fast before firefighters could mobilize. But thousands of homes and other buildings were saved.

People came from all over the country to help. They are all heroes."

Look at all that Camo though. 

Is that a thing in America, just everyday camouflage clothes and gear. Is it so the fire doesn’t see them?"
ladyLyric,fdoh7mo,t1_fdo8h7z,Your comment about it made me go back and watch again. I'm from Midwest USA and didn't even register the camo cause it's so commonplace.
purpelpeepleeater,fdomnmc,t1_fdo8h7z,"Unless I’m missing some, I don’t think i saw any camo that would be worn by like, country type/hunting people. All of that camo was multi-cam and i think an ACU pattern bag or two...which is military. Id assume there’s a large veteran population in firefighting, and also dudes still in the National Guard or reserves"
starwyo,fdoaz07,t1_fdo8h7z,Yes camo is very much an everyday thing here depending on where you live.  A lot of people are active in outdoor sports and use camo for them and every day wear.
motorjim,fdo8xfg,t1_fdo8h7z,"The people wearing the camouflage gear are most likely veterans, or possibly even still on active reserve status or in the National Guard.

I don't think it's as much a cultural thing as it is more often a ""I've got all this good gear from my time in, might as well use it"" kinda thing."
scratchnsniffy,fdoq7s3,t1_fdo8h7z,"If you're in need of budget-conscious outdoor wear, military surplus is going to be at the intersection of cheap and durable. And yeah, a lot of folks just wear camo - especially in more rural areas."
Ocealot11,fdob6zn,t1_fdo8h7z,"I can't speak for all of America, but in the part of Texas where I live, most people have camo on at least one or two things. I don't know if it's a fashion statement or something. Hunting is pretty popular, so I wouldn't be surprised if that's where it all comes from."
themocaw,fdori0j,t1_fdo8h7z,"Maybe it's just me, but I mostly saw jeans and blue shirts and khaki pants. Basically, the sort of thing that American construction workers and laborers would wear: heavy duty clothing designed to stand up to hard labor. 

I did notice that some of the bags are camo. Outdoors outfitters in the United States tend to get divided up into two groups. One group caters to the type of people who take camping trips at Yosemite, and tend to make their stuff in bright colors so that rescuers can see them easier if they break their ankle on the trail. The other group caters to hunters and the type of guys who take overnight camping trips 10 miles from home and call them ""24 hour missions."" The first group tends to make stuff that's lightweight but requires some care, the second group tends to make stuff that's heavier but burly as hell. Not too surprising that firefighters might tend towards the second type of gear."

Some of them in the gif are wearing past or current army camo clothing or bags. They're either veterans or just like wearing it (its kinda comfortable and its good outdoor work apparel). Some of them are wearing hunting camo apparel, which yes, is a popular form of fashion that people wear. The more rural, or wherever hunting is prevalent you'll see people wearing camo hats, shirts, legs, etc."
plastroncafe,fdolrad,t1_fdoh7mo,That just means it's working.

chrislehr,fdow96y,t1_fdoaz07,"Police/Fire/EMS folks tend to have a pretty solid overlap with military deployed folks and many are veterans, so the camo isn't that surprising."
voodoobullshit,fdoynpg,t1_fdoaz07,">>A lot of people are active in outdoor sports and use camo for them and every day wear.

Interesting. Wearing camo in Australia when doing outdoor sports involving wilderness or nature areas is actively discouraged because it can make search and rescue far more difficult. I get that it has utility in hunting but one would think it's an unwise choice for general outdoor activities."
longdragon92,fdoqncf,t1_fdoaz07,They are also pretty comfortable to wear honestly. I played paintball and airsoft in the woods as a teenager so I had two sets of camo pants and jacket and honestly they were just nice to wear if I was going to be outside on hot days.

selz202,fdoytfq,t1_fdohf68,It's kind of... the style on some of the brands which can be pretty good. So maybe you're not necessarily after camo but the jacket that's really great has a light camo pattern. And of course some people are just all about it and everyone needs to see what they're about.
purpelpeepleeater,fdoy84o,t1_fdown8v,"Yah..i guess, but people don’t really buy that camo if they aren’t in the military.

clink_182,fdp2eyu,t1_fdp078p,"I can answer this lol

I’ve been both an urban and wildland firefighter. 

Urban guy (in cities and things) aren’t allowed to have beards for that specific reason. The mask of the SCBA won’t seal on their face. 

Wildland guys rarely use SCBAs so there’s no regulation on facial hair. If they do wear anything on the face, it’ll be a run of the mill dust mask."

Peter Venkman: That oughta do it. Thanks very much, Ray.

neomay,fdoolu0,t3_emeapa,This made me teary. Thanks for coming!
gladline,fdo96xb,t3_emeapa,Correct me if I'm wrong but I thought firefighters weren't allowed to have beards because their air masks won't seal properly... So it's interesting that they have beards because they'll have to shave them and maybe it means that they've been sitting around back home without any fires to fight.
adultagerampage,fdod3gt,t1_fdo96xb,"Wildland firefighters in the US generally do not use SCBAs, nor are they trained in their use. Using an SCBA for the type of work that we do would be impractical. 

“Increasingly, we look at wildland firefighters as tactical athletes. Their respiratory demands are similar to those people engaging in athletic events,” DeGrosky said. “You put any kind of restrictive thing over your nose and mouth and you’re decreasing your oxygen update, which decreases your muscle abilities, your cognitive abilities.”

The basic N95 respirators available to the general public don’t hold up to the intense, physical conditions on a fire, and the respirators that structural firefighters use are heavy, reduce vision and can only supply clean air for a short period of time. Wildfire shifts are generally 12 hours.”

https://www.opb.org/news/article/health-wildland-firefighters-smoke-breathing-lungs/

Honestly it’s fucked up and more than a little of a catch-22, which is all too common in this field. Particulate matter and the compounds present in wildfire smoke are some nasty things with serious long term health consequences. In the meantime we’re still overworked, understaffed, and grossly underpaid."
gordanfreman,fdobmfg,t1_fdo96xb,Wildfire fighting is very different from urban fire fighting. Don't see as many/any masks for average wildfire fighting.
okay_skylar,fdo9to6,t1_fdo96xb,"I was just thinking that too, with all the comments about their nice beards. I wonder if it is a regional thing? Maybe some stations use a different type of mask?"

Shredder1219,fdocq9b,t1_fdob1x5,True that. They tend to wear the bare minimum when fighting wild fires. They also don’t usually wear O2 gear

cxavierc21,fdq6u4i,t1_fdp0ft5,Yeah it's weird. People using American fire fighting terms on an American website's post about American firefighters.
ascii122,fdt06fs,t1_fdp0ft5,"In general there is a distinction between 'wildland' firefighters and 'structural' firefighters.  So when I was in wildland we didn't go into buildings or whatnot.. we'd maybe throw some water at them but we don't have respirators or training to go into buildings.

We'd get a call: Brush fire at xxx or grass fire at xxx or forest fire at xxx

So when you get a call it's telling you the type of fire a lot of times.  Brush fire is low level .. well brush.. grass .. or forest is big timber.  Wildfire is kind of generic for a fire that's out of control in the 'wild'

I'd bet when crews get sent to a certain area in Australia they get a word or description of the type of shit that's on fire, and they probably have specific words for it.  So bushfires are probably a generic term for 'everything is on fire', but specific crews get more info."

fancyforrestfire,fdq7ulr,t3_emeapa,"Silly question, but the American firefighters who have been sent to help with the fires, is there a clause where if they don’t have a passport but are going to help they still can? 

I’m aware that a passport is needed in normal everyday travel. Assuming that maybe a handful of firemen did not have passports for what ever reason, barring legal restrictions, but were called to duty is there a waiver in this situation? Probably not I’m sure but I just thought I’d ask. Curious minds ya know?"

According to KYM, though, it started showing up around 2011, with the backronym of Before Anyone Else coming around later that year.

Dewdra,fe5ub8b,t1_fe57tt4,That's great to hear but there are still many baby kangaroos that died in the fire
pixiefairie,fe5l8vx,t1_fe3zqeo,The frustrating part is that climate change is just a fact and a major factor in these fires. The overwhelming lack of containment well that's 100% on the government. They have whittled the firefighting and fire prevention budgets down to nothing in a country that is prone to fires. I'm not 100% on these facts but as far as I know the government took the job of fire management officers ( a skilled job for someone to come up with plans for containment and planned burning amongst other important things ) from a number of 36 to 10 officers for the entire country- in a country prone to fires- does this make sense? It does not
AlyssaTheWolf,fe48ffm,t1_fe3zqeo,"[Deleted]

EDIT: I have been informed most of the fires have been caused by lightning and dryness. I didnt know everything. I only heard a few people set a bunch of fires. I'm sorry I made people upset. I only heard a few rumors"

Sammirose77,fe4s372,t1_fe48ffm,"That's been rejected, some fires were arson sure but the vast majority were due to dry lightening strikes which explain why they can start in remote areas. This plus drought and climate change , plus the little shit arsonists is disastrous . Then add a religious govt which denies climate change and you have a Gondwana doomed continent."
InquisitorVawn,fe4ujr6,t1_fe48ffm,"""Some people"" didn't set ""the fire"". Some of the fires - multiple - were either caused through negligence such as littering like throwing cigarettes into dry grass, or bottles into scrub, using tools incorrectly on full fire ban days or some were deliberate acts. The vast majority of fires started due to lightning strikes in remote areas and were not even caused by human intervention, let alone intentional."
Nsanitygames,fe4kyij,t1_fe48ffm,So its human stupidity and the climate for perfect fire storm.
liquidsmurf,fe4uhpo,t1_fe48ffm,"So, i hadn’t heard about this so I did some reading for the last hour or so. 

It does seem like some of the fires were set intentionally, which is not uncommon for this time of year in Australia. 

The reality is that nearly all of the fires were naturally occurring and the damage is so widespread because of extreme dryness and above average temperatures along with strong wind that spreads the fires very quickly. Add all that up and the evisceration of all park services and fire prevention due to their current administration, and bam Australia is now hell on Earth. 

The below link is from CNN because it summarizes it all pretty well, but trust me, there are many pages of the same stuff from tons of sources.

grinchelda,fe4jzwj,t1_fe48ffm,you know the way it started is irrelevant to the fact that everything is dry as fuck right
BringBackDewshine,fe5cvh9,t1_fe48ffm,"Yeah, there's actually a targeted campaign by Russian troll farms and Austrailian right wing media to attribute the fires to arsonists. 

1) About 24 people arrested for violating the fire ban. Not abnormal by any means. That's actually a very small number during burning bans, they're just not always reported so virulantly.

2) The far right propagandists want to pin the blame on scapegoats instead of admitting they are complacent in destroying the safeguards in place and taking lobbyist money to bury climate research. 

Now, this doesn't necessarily mean these fire would'nt have happened, but predicting, containing, and controlling them were entirely in the power of the Austrailian State.

Redditors Note: I'm not Austrailian. In the US and have many firefighting friends wanting to help who are keeping up with the logistics and struggles Aussie Firefighters are facing."
rich1051414,fe537ec,t1_fe48ffm,"Everytime there is proof of climate change, there are going to be conspiracy theories for how it is all a lie. You need to understand why.

allTradesbyName_,fe63rda,t1_fe4ujr6,Scott Morisson’s attempt to blame arson backfired spectacularly- when intelligent people spoke up to the fact that a cigarette butt wouldn’t cause that kind of devastation unless climate change dried out the undergrowth and set the environment up for a disaster TO BEGIN WITH.

Banzybanz,fe6tiae,t1_fe6s38s,Climate change created the conditions that led to the fires spreading to this extent. Whether the fire started due to arson or natural causes is not very relavant when your entire forest has turned into a box of matchsticks ready to burn at the slightest spark. Bushfires are a natural and common occurence in Australia. What has happened now is a combination of bad forestry and climate change.

Many of the deliberately set fires were not causing the blazes, they were in violation of the total fire ban causing people to be arrested. Tasmania is the only place that had a large amount of the devastation due to arson."
inmywhiteroom,fe4r2g0,t1_fe4io4f,I was under the impression that it was mostly conservative news sources claiming that the majority of the fires were due to arson in an attempt to downplay the effects of climate change. [This](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-01-11/australias-fires-reveal-arson-not-a-major-cause/11855022) is an article that shows the breakdown of what fires were due to arson. I am pretty sure has been widely acknowledged that lightning strikes are the major reason for these bush fires.
InquisitorVawn,fe4usx4,t1_fe4io4f,"You don't know what you're talking about. The fires in Australia aren't a single fire. Many were started by lightning strikes or non-deliberate actions such as throwing litter into dry scrub, or using tools incorrectly on full fire ban days. There are some fires that have been started via arson, but very few compared to the size of the fire front."
nucknuckgoose,fe65pf8,t1_fe5z8ni,It's really not.
Munchskull,fe6tnrx,t1_fe6rm8m,Its because there has been a disinformation campaign trying to suggest that climate change has nothing to do with the fires and they were all started by arsonist.

mpezza,fe5pmaq,t1_fe5mcnu,"Yes there are arsonists out there. It's not uncommon. 

But the New south wales fire service have already attributed the cause of the majority of the larger fires to lightning strikes, so its scary to see the story of arsonists being the main cause being pushed. It's just not true."
demotecontrol,fe6z20z,t1_fe5mcnu,"This article actually disproves the usual hypothesis that comes up in these conversations namely, that the 24 people who have been arrested for arson in Australia since November were all working together in some sort of grand conspiracy to enact climate change legislation by starting wildfires.

Once read an article on  Noman Rockwell, and in it he described that for one Saturday Evening Post cover he had to paint some chickens. He called local farmer, and the guy brought him some chickens. Problem was, they were running all over and of course wouldn't stand still. He made a remark to the farmer who promptly picked up a chicken and shook it and put it back down and it stayed put. And he said that is what he had to do. Shake the chicken, paint furiously, and when it started to move, shake it again. Who knew?"

Babaluba2,fdxbc02,t1_fdwj9kv,"Idk if I'm being whooshed but please don't do those. The line in the sand thing is you convincing the chicken that it's seeing a snake coming after it and it's paralyzing itself in total fear. You are making the chicken think it's going to die. I don't know about the other twirling thing but it's likely similar. Most 'hypnosis' tricks with animals are activating tonic immobility which is an extreme fear response to a percieved threat

Hannakosan,fdwmgrq,t1_fdwlo5c,Lol! K!
EpsilonRider,fdxtkr2,t1_fdxbc02,"Tonic *immobility* is actually highly debated because it isn't so well understood. One popular tonic immobility case are with sharks who are apex predators and they wouldn't need a fear response like this. Alligators are another apex predators to have the same response. It's a myth that you need to draw a line for chickens. You just need to flip them on their backs til they relax. It's also a myth that you need to rub their bellies or tickle them for sharks, alligators, and even chickens. It's theorized that being on their backs is such an unnatural position. That when held there for an extended period of time their sense of balance is so thrown of it needs to ""catch"" up with the brain."

IceGiantHelga,fe4pkn7,t1_fe3bqsa,There's nothing wrong with the hamster but I think their cage is too small and it does not have nearly enough bedding. Hams love to dig and burrow! Big cage with lots of space to dig  and little houses to burrow in = happy hamster! [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXqyd3EAp4o) is an example of a great tank where the little ham ham gets to express all of her natural hamster behaviours!
lnevitably,fe3ojc2,t1_fe3k6bu,"Yep looks like the wheel wasnt facing the right way to be supported by the wall. If you've ever had one that likes to run, they can really get that thing going sometimes. He must've been in overdrive, and tipped it over. Hes fine though!

Hope he gets a bigger wheel though. That is for mice or dwarf hamsters not a big boi Syrian. He will have back problems later on."

jrosekonungrinn,fe3w85a,t1_fe3ojc2,"Oh no. :( 
My syrians when I was a kid had bigger wheels than that one, I hope they were big enough.  I get so much guilt over the pets I had growing up.  All the pet stores were like mall shops that just sell you a bunch of stuff without any knowledge of what the animals need.  I didn't find out that the cedar bedding chips they sell are toxic for small animals' respiratory tracts until I was in my 20s.  And the food with with Millet seeds was junk."
hippoputamus,fe47m01,t1_fe3ojc2,And a bigger cage. Aaand more bedding for nest building and digging. God damn pet shops selling them like this.
nnika_,fe4dklv,t1_fe3ojc2,I was thinking the same about the wheel! that is way too small. for full grown syrians at least 28cm diameter is the ideal size!

Some interpret that as don’t raise a dog inside the home, some keep a prayer room and let the dog in, some disregard that because we don’t pray on the floor we pray on a prayer mat that a dog would never touch, and a few hateful people use that as an opportunity to hate an innocent creature of God and treat it poorly.

What is being ""kind to animals"" ? If you're looking at it from the standpoint of a vegan person you can make the case that killing of any animal is cruelty, but then singling out islam or qurban is weird because literally any other abrahamic religion allows you to use animals as food sources. 

> Except black dogs of course. Islam believes black dogs are evil.

Nothing in islamic scripture states that black dogs are evil, there might be hadiths that im not aware of, but thats not islamic scripture its basically a prominent muslim declaring black dogs being evil which doesn't mean the religion considers black dogs as evil creatures. Also i've yet to see a single human being, after living in a muslim country the last 23 ish years, who called a black dog an evil animal. And i've heard some weird shit like chess or wearing jeans being haram. So its probably something that noone really takes into serious consideration.

There are also more to it but I dont believe we humans understand exactly what is meant. Like for example, when God offered the mountains free will and they rejected it.

I have this fond memory of tucking myself in a corner and spending 45 minutes in complete silence, just visually admiring the awesome beauty of the architecture (in between prayer times, when non-worshippers were allowed access). 

I have always believed it such a gracious gesture, allowing non-Muslim guests inside to enjoy the Mosque’s magnificent interiors. 

And, the cats of Istanbul are so cool... they’re like, “Yeah, we’ve witnessed EMPIRES rise and fall. Give us some scritches, maybe some food - do so with kindness, and we *might* allow you a glimpse of the universe through our ancient eyes.”

Maybe they’ve got the advantages of the height genes, athleticism genes, plus some coaching and support as well.

They obviously took great effort to teach him how to throw correctly, why would they ever stop pushing his talents once he's old enough to decide he really wants to go professional with it? I am unfamiliar with the recruting process, though your young NBA players must come from somewhere, -and I don'T expect them to grow in cabbage heads- so I highly suspect if he joins basketball teams, wins contests and all that, someone will eventually notice him and recrute him if he wants?!"
ChapterMasterSalt,febnnft,t1_fe5zwzh,"The amount of people that have been successful under 6' is a handful. The existence of a few exceptions to the rule don't define the rule, and if anything, it strengthens it by showing that the kid will have to be the top 1% of the 1% to have a chance of going professional.

Mashaka,fe5ujn7,t1_fe5taej,Unexpected accent aigu
thatHecklerOverThere,fe632s5,t1_fe5y9eq,"So I say he probably won't play because every city in America has plenty of kids _good enough_ to play, but an NBA team still only has 15 players. And getting in front of those teams requires far more than just being incredibly good. 

So I have no doubt that he could be exceptionally skilled and driven, but athletic recruitment isn't a straight meritocracy. It has as much to do with circumstance and timing as anything. So statistically, it probably won't be him.

Although, statistically it also probably wasn't going to be LeBron James, either. Odds can be beaten, but they are yet odds."

I isolated myself from most people in my area because I didn't want to be like him and a lot of the other people our age. 

Now I live in one of the next cities over and doing a lot better than he is. It's sad that he didn't have the same opportunity to see someone make mistakes like I did but he was never loving towards me either. If he had been maybe I would have been more inclined to act like him and I'd still be stuck there with a load of kids instead of following my own passions.

I'm not trying to disagree with you just giving another perspective."

Maschinenherz,fe5yo7m,t1_fe5v5g7,yeah but then again there are the younger siblings who don't need no support or anything and are generally much luckier with these things than their older siblings. Guess everything sucks somehow!

NewYorkJewbag,fe637uo,t1_fe5yo7m,"Oh, I’m definitely much luckier than my older brother. He’s a deeply unhappy person. He has dealt with anger issues his whole life. He wasn’t always mean to me, and I kind of idolized him. We even went to the same college, but ran in very different crowds. I have no anger towards him, only concern. We’re both grownups with teenage children and are overall “successful” by most standards."
Maschinenherz,fe63hgp,t1_fe637uo,"Ah, well. So you two just lost connection to each other along the way?

Maybe it's time to talk at the next family gathering!"
NewYorkJewbag,fe64bg5,t1_fe63hgp,"We see each other every few months and I shouldn’t paint him in an all bad light. We don’t have much of a connection, we’re very different people, but we both care about each other’s well being and can make each other laugh. He lives less than 30 blocks from me."

Perhaps goes without saying but be sure to let this kid try playing more than only basketball. First of all of course don't pressure him, but if it turns out he likes sports, it might turn out he has talent not only for basketball, and basketball is so much about height so unless he gets really tall that might not be his thing later on. Soccer comes to mind, many great soccer players were prodigys at ball sports really early on, and your height doesn't really matter."

Spotted_cow_drinker,fdjp8w5,t1_fdjnxm0,"I mean, it is pretty harmless to do with deer to be honest.  They are not like predators who lose their ability to successfully hunt if they get fed too much by humans and become reliant on humans feeding them for food.  A deer will still be able to forage just fine after being fed by humans.  Sure, they might be more likely to be killed during hunting season because they are less afraid of humans, but meh, deer are going to be killed and harvested by humans during hunting season regardless."
pr0duce,fdjo01a,t1_fdjnxm0,I think you forgot a !
MagicalTrevor09,fdjxtst,t1_fdjnxm0,"Everyone keeps giving you shit, but you’re right. There are a lot of reasons why it’s a bad idea. I’m too lazy, but anyone reading this should just google it. 

It’s not just that they become dependable on the food we give them. Predictable congregation of deer increases likelihood of predators showing up. Luring them near where paved roads may be is a bad idea for obvious reasons. There are also issues with gut flora. Deer take a long time to get used to new foods and feeding them a lot of something they haven’t been having can give them disease.

Y’all can downvote this person all you want, but they’re right."
VanessaSoIll,fdkdvqj,t1_fdkabbo,You should see the dms I've received. YIKES.
VanessaSoIll,fdkbxcg,t1_fdk5u3a,I'm with you here. She's doing fine. If she were relying solely on me/neighbor she wouldn't have survived so long.
SoTheyDontFindOut,fdkpla5,t1_fdk5u3a,Being hand fed apples by a human is way different than crops. Those deer in the fields will run away if a human tries to approach them this one actively approaches humans. There is a huge difference. You’re decreasing the chance of survival for that doe by doing this. So even if you think it’s cute you’re actively contributing to increasing its chances of being killed. That’s not cool.  https://extension.unh.edu/resource/more-harm-good-why-you-shouldnt-feed-deer

Sallyanonymous,fdk4xb0,t3_eln2x3,"We had a doe at my grandpa’s place out in central Oregon. She had several fawns right of his back porch and would hang around for snacks every evening for years. She was the sweetest old girl. She couldn’t keep up with the rest of the deer as she got older but still held her own against the dogs and coyotes. It broke our hearts when we had to move GP into a memory care center and had to sell the house. She loved pears and peaches (so we named her peaches). Mostly she loved stealing tomatoes from the neighbor’s huge garden and then running to GP for shelter. He wouldn’t let anything happen to his furry friends. 
When we sold the house we left a description of Peaches and her favorite foods on the counter for the new owners. When we weren’t home my grandpa’s friends would keep an eye on the place and leave peaches some apples or pears."
VanessaSoIll,fdk8kag,t1_fdk4xb0,OH MY HEART! I love this so much! Darcy was reused by my neighbor a few years ago when her mom was hit by a car. Ever since we moved in she checks on every day before getting some grains and pets from our neighbor. I love her so much ❤️
Sallyanonymous,fdk8vsy,t1_fdk8kag,Awww bless your neighbor! That’s so sweet. My grandpa did the same for a jack rabbit when I was really little. He has to keep it in an upright refrigerator box so that it couldn’t jump out until it was old enough to be released. It stuck around for a few months and then moved on about three miles down the road where a bunch more rabbits were being fed by the neighbor

I always pass by this one particular house, and the cat that lives there always hangs out in the front yard. One day it started walking along side me. And then walked ahead. And then plomp.. just laid there on the sidewalk in my way with it's belly up and meowing.

Wasn't sure if it was a trap. Can't seemed super friendly and cute. But I couldn't risk it. I just leaned down and gave it a little scritch on the head, and went on my way. Can't got up and looked at me with a disappointed look. :-/"

NotACop26,fe3dof4,t3_enmxdg,"Wow reddit, I didnt think this kitty will get so much upvotes. Let me give you some context on the photo.

My brother and I usually get to walk near town and this road usually reaches a tiny town with lots of trees and forest (that´s why the road is full of leaves and wood chunks). 

this photo was taken near an abandoned house with tons of cats (all of them vaccinated and neutered by the local gov) that habit that area, but they always run away from us. This time this pretty boy saw us and, after stretching a bit, came from the roof to lay at our feet and meow several times. He followed us some seconds but after some pets and compliments he decided we weren´t interesting enough and went back to lick himself at the roof. Cat things"

mariepyrite,fdpapsb,t1_fdodxtg,"Despite all the down votes, that guys right. The pom is unimpressed with his predicament. 

Panting is a really clear tell for stress, which is something this subreddit is really bad at aknowledging. Obviously context matters, but when you're doing something weird to your dog and they're panting, it's safe to assume that they're a bit unsettled. 

That being said, the dog is fine :) It's good for dogs to experience unexpected things, and that pup is obviously coping okay. You don't see the whites of their eyes much (a big tell), and they're not licking their lips (another subtle tell), so no one should feel bad for thinking the video is cute or anything."

(Yes, he is overweight.  The vet estimates his healthy weight around 16 pounds, tho, so he’s also a big cat to begin with. Either way, we’re working on it. Or at least I am. His food anxiety and intelligence aren’t helping me much.)"

Naeratus,fe32a5r,t1_fe1cgv2,"We had the same issue with our big boy, Walter (21lbs now down to a healthier 17lbs), and he has a lot of anxiety around food, travel, and separation as well. Stay consistent and you'll get there! Top recommendations are: Do NOT allow them to free feed- but be very consistent with what time they are fed, we have alarms twice a day that ding via our Google home so though he still meows/pesters us some before the alarm goes off he knows he'll be fed when he hears it which has cut down on his anxiety. Get a food bowl that requires him to slow down when eating, we have [this one](https://www.chewy.com/trixie-activity-strategy-game-tunnel/dp/134683). Give him less food than what's recommended on the package (unless it's a doctor's recommendation of course), cats are very sedentary if indoor all the time and don't need much- we give ours just under a quarter cup twice a day and our 10lb girl, Leela, doesn't eat all of hers most of the time. And I don't know if you have more than one cat but Walter was always eating Leela's food as she is a grazer while he is a gobbler, so we shelled out for [this](https://www.chewy.com/surefeed-microchip-small-dog-cat/dp/157145) programmed to Leela and now we know he's only eating what we give him. 
Oh and play! Lots of play always helps :)"

amurderofcrows9,fe2waiy,t1_fe28tqe,And very fresh!!!
joef_3,fe3fmkg,t1_fe32a5r,"I have the same problem, two cats and the healthy weight one will absolutely end up seeing her food get eaten because she’d prefer to graze. I do want to get that chip reader bowl but it’s just not in the budget right now. 

He’s generally not interested in playing. He figured out that most toys are bullshit and gets bored with then very quickly. He’s been that way for years. A new toy used a few times a week will interest him for about a month, maybe two, before he’s figured it out."
joef_3,fe1kkkg,t1_fe1ioxs,"I honestly mean this in the least insulting way possible: I am going to take the word of the professional animal doctor who has actually seen my cat in person over that of a random internet person who hasn’t. 

The average cat is about 18 inches long, ignoring the tail. Mine is about 24 inches, which is roughly a medium sized Maine Coon. He’s long enough that when he stands on his hind legs, he can put his front paws up on the counter, and his head is at my hip (I’m 5’9”). The healthy weight range for a male Maine Coon is something like 12-20 pounds. When he was two (he’s about 11.5 years old) he weighed 18 pounds and had just a little bit of a belly, but you could still feel his ribs. I can not imagine a situation where he weighs 10-12 pounds and is healthy."
IamWildlamb,fe1kr65,t1_fe1ioxs,"No, it entirely depends on the specifics of the cat. Male maine coons are on average between 13-18lbs. But even 20 lbs can be healthy for some individuals and vets devide whether the weight is healthy by looking on the cat from tail to head from above and there should not be any roundness or curvature."
idontevencarewutever,fe250xq,t1_fe0xwkt,"That's what allergy medication is for.

The need to snuggle has forced progression in modern medicine. Think about that."
Naeratus,fe3mmqk,t1_fe3fmkg,"Yeah I get that! It took us a long time to commit to the expensive bowl but I'm so glad we did and wish we would have sooner. We have a friend that has one for each of 3 her cats and thought it was a great idea but $300 for two food bowls seemed excessive, so we just got the one for Leela so we knew Walter couldn't get to her food and got the puzzle bowl for Walter. 

It's especially useful because if we're gone for a couple feedings we would have to leave out more food than necessary because we were worried Walter wouldn't leave anything for Leela, but now we have the peace of mind that they are each getting exactly how much they need for that amount of time and he no longer gains a pound every time we're gone for a night or two.

And also, our boy has a very short attention span for play and sometimes isn't interested, but even just 2 min a day with a piece of string helps!"
junebug_vs_hurricane,fe3gdyx,t1_fe1kkkg,"I looked it up and it was listed at 15-25 lbs (on the source I saw, sources tend to vary a little bit on this kinda stuff) so your cat isn't far gone. I'm sure you'll succeed if you follow the vets advice. 

Things I've found successful on dogs and cats is getting them to play more, getting everyone in the household to commit, and switching to low calorie food. Obesity is common in cats especially fixed males so it takes some work sometimes.

Good luck."
penatbater,fe1onh7,t1_fe1n3nv,"You... Misunderstood. The vet said that a healthy weight for HIS cat is at 16 lbs. You then chimed in that the vet was wrong/lied and said that the GENERAL weight for cats is 10-12 lbs, which, whether it's true or not, is irrelevant for the topic at hand, since we're not discussing cats in general, but HIS cat specifically."
junebug_vs_hurricane,fe3d57i,t1_fe1n3nv,You're not even right though. I just looked it up and healthy weight for a male maine coon is 15-25 lbs. His vet told him the low end.
joef_3,fe3efu2,t1_fe1n3nv,"BMI is flawed because muscle is much denser than fat. When I was younger I was an athlete, and had a BMI of about 21.5. I also had a body fat % of about 3-4%, at least as estimated by my home scale. The heaviest I’ve ever been, I had a 33” waist and a BMI that called me obese. 

LeBron James has a BMI around 30 (borderline obese!) and looks like [this](https://www.pinterest.com/pin/519884350709955744/).  He would have to shed over 80 pounds to get his BMI to 20. If that was representative of the obesity crisis the news used to spend so much time talking about, sign my ass up. 

Beyond that, BMI takes height into account, and as I said, my cat is much longer than the average house cat. You’re not even comparing my cat to another in terms of BMI. You’re trying to say someone 6’5 should have the same healthy weight as someone 5’10."
VValrus54,fe3ddjx,t1_fe3d57i,Did you read what I wrote. I am not going to argue which is healthier. Lower end of the range is (FYI).
VValrus54,fe3h2sr,t1_fe3efu2,Are you serious? That’s not what I am trying to say. Your example of 6’5 and 5’10 is apples and oranges.  BMI is flawed I agree there but to say that a 20 lbs cat is healthy his wrong. There is no reason for a cat to be 20lbs.  Length of your cat in this case wouldn’t apply since we are debating if 20lbs for a cat is healthy when compared to say 15. Like cmon.
junebug_vs_hurricane,fe3i4nf,t1_fe3ddjx,"But you are wrong about the bmi range of this breed. If your point were to get the message out that people should be aware   of their pets ideal weight, that's great. But you insisting that this person doesn't know his own cat's bmi is both rude and incorrect."
joef_3,fe3i7tk,t1_fe3h2sr,I said his healthy weight was around 16 and you called the vet who told me that a liar. No where in this conversation did anyone claim my cat’s healthy weight was 20 pounds. You said a cat should be 10-12 ponds and 16 would be overweight.
joef_3,fe3jxvw,t1_fe3jhz8,"You said 10-12, but anyway. There is a floor under which weight loss is a health concern, not a benefit. If my cat got to 12 pounds he’d probably start suffering (or already be suffering) massive health problems."

Bipolar_Pigeon,fe72ju2,t1_fe6ar64,"Seriously though, watching your spouse do silly shit is one of the best parts of being married. 

I have a tendency to sing songs about our pets, and create dumb nicknames for them. I recently discovered that when I do this my husband is also singing them a minute or two later, and they will be stuck in his head. It is super cute to be in another room and all of a sudden hear him sing something stupid I sang. 

I also use this power for evil though to troll him with songs he doesn't really like, or to make him sing what I want. It only takes 1 ""One day more!"" to get a Les Miserables musical starring the two of us going on in the house.

ConcealedPsychosis,fdgy3jt,t3_elbiak,"This is actually very common, When I’d respond to medical calls where the patient had a dog often times we had to secure the dogs as they wouldn’t let the medics provide medical care.

I remember this one time I was holding this little five pound pup cradle in my arm so she could still see her owner next I know she sunk her teeth into my hand as hard as possible to where I kind of dropped her and she ran back and jump in her humans lap.

Since she couldn’t go with her owner I volunteer to take her home with me as the kennel was closed for the night and because she was scared and needed someone.

I’ll tell you one thing a way to a pups heart is peanut butter and belly rubs they’ll become your BFF.

Cops and e.m.t.'s didn't know what to do about it until I told them for the hundredth time she wouldn't bite them.

ConcealedPsychosis,fdhxdvr,t1_fdhx88o,"No, because you need specific doses for different size dogs that only vets would know you give the wrong dose you’ll OD the dog killing them but in extreme cases we were told we could use our tasers but only after all other options were used."
ConcealedPsychosis,fdo127w,t1_fdjnp0n,"“for the hundreds time she won’t bite”

Sadly we can’t always trust the owner when they say this because we/you will never know how they’ll react especially if the pup knows you’re actually hurt and not just playing.

While 98% of the time it’s true there is that 1% when it will happen and has happened but we try and give the owners a benefit of a doubt and will try to get the pup out without needing to harm them.

I and none of my partners ever had to ever use a taser on a pup we always managed to calm them down or remove them from the situation.

I found if you handle them by mainly their hindquarters and by the back of their neck like their momma did you can then safely move them as it’ll be impossible for them to whip around and bite you then you can either pick them up or guide them into another room."
ConcealedPsychosis,fdi020i,t1_fdhxkwe,"We try everything we can to bribe/coax them into another room away from the patient some fire trucks carry dog poles for animals rescues but fire trucks don’t always respond to medical calls my local dept doesn’t only medics.

Worse case scenario if the patient/medics can’t get the dog away without endangering them the may have to resort to stunning the dog with a taser.

Something I recommend to folks to ask this is to get some of your pups favorite treats/toys and put them in a place that FR can access easily to try and distract the pups.

You could also call your local FD and ask them if they have a list they could add you too so if there is a service call to your home they know there’s two big pups and they might put it in the notes so they know to have an engine or the Rapid Response Unit bring the catch pole"

cyleleghorn,fdje7dv,t1_fdhvv9x,I wouldn't have thought about that. Makes perfect sense that the dog's instincts would be telling it the owner is about to get killed and/or eaten

One night I was home alone and had gone to bed, around 2am my partner gets home and the dog hears him coming up the stairs - he jumps into protect mode and starts growling with his hackles raised, right up until the moment my bf poked his head around the door and the dog goes back to bum wiggling love machine mode. So out of character but I really appreciated the sentiment!"

ConcealedPsychosis,fdhwlc7,t1_fdhtjpy,"I did that for my grandpa on one of his last days, He lived with me so he and Busters were always together.

When he got sick and needed to go into the nursing home he’d always ask for Buster but they wouldn’t allow dogs in.

But when I saw he was close to the end I decided to sneak him in to see his buddy one more time.

His room was at the very end of the hall so I had my girls go end and open the door next to his room and then closed the door to his room.

When we got there he was napping so I placed Buster on his chest and buster gave him some kisses to wake him up when he woke up and saw Buster he had the biggest smile we’ve seen in months.

The two of them just cuddled for the next two hours."

fdc7719,fdipp8f,t1_fdhtjpy,"Depending on the hospital, you can actually get permission to bring in a dog if the doctor approves it. Also, some units will let you sneak a dog in after hours, provided you clear it with the night charge nurse. If they turn you down it could be for any number of reasons. If it has to do with another patient’s health they won’t be able to discuss it."

BoundKitten,fdidu12,t1_fdhtv8k,"I don’t know why you’re getting downvoted, you’re totally right. He’s petting his dog, but when the other guy comes over dog shifts it’s body and is digging elbows into his owner. Owner pushes on the arm and the dog shifted so he wasn’t elbowing his owner. I too recognize that move lol. 

It’s also possible he was just trying to shift the dog off him altogether. I’m sure he appreciated the comfort from his doggo but he’s on a stretcher and knows that the doggy can’t come with him."

ordinary-use-account,fdhkel9,t1_fdhhhow,"Spare the rare sociopath, most people hurting others physically or emotionally have been 'conditioned' to do so.

Ex: if you grow up in a shitty physical environment where the only way you can get by is by being an asshole people learn not to mess with, you'll be conditioned to be an asshole. If you grow up with shitty parents who are cruel you every time you show any kind of emotional softness or care for others, you'll be conditioned to hide those behaviors and mimic their punishing attitude.

On a day to day level, it's very hard to let go of things that have helped us, even when we can see that behavior isn't necessary in the current environment. If hiding all of your emotional vulnerabilities behind anger was how you got away from your parents treating you like shit, it will be hard to shed that tendency even if you are happily married to an emotionally healthy woman that would never tease you for being sad, etc.

The most memorable was when I had a tear in my throat and had vomited so much blood I lost consciousness before EMTs even arrived. I wasn't awake or aware of what was happening to see it for myself but my family and later on the EMTs themselves told me that my little dog planted himself firmly between myself and the paramedics. He barked and growled and carried on until my boyfriend picked him up and locked him in our spare room. Somehow, he escaped as they were carrying me outside and flew up onto the stretcher. It was heart breaking to find out how scared that poor dog was for me. 

Natures rules are that the weak are prey. So, I can't blame doggos for panicking when a stranger tries to mess with their very vulnerable human. We worked hard to familiarize our pets with lots of people after this happened to help them cope better in an emergency. we went on to socialize and train our dogs better.

There's a lot of really neat techniques used in order to get the effects they perform in these videos. Even professional VFX artists have trouble figuring out how he achieves many of the effects he has in his videos.

He's never tried to pass himself off as a magician or a sleight of hand artist, it strikes me as pretty unfair to judge the guy harshly when he's not trying to claim to be doing traditional sleight of hand tricks. It's always been about using video editing."

I don't happen to agree with you that this sub is so bad that this content isn't out of place here. Not in the slightest - reposts are the only 'bad' content I regularly see coming up from r/aww, a damn sight better than most popular subs. Honestly, this is one of the most consistent subs I know of for actually getting the reaction described in its name.

You know who **would** go to great lengths to justify this content being here? Zack King and his loyal strike force, apparently. They don't need you in their corner to further dominate every inch of the internet. Let my stupid cute sub be about stupid cute things. Zack can post here if he manages to make something  that actually belongs.

Mortifier,fe0pp7w,t1_fe0lyuz,"He keeps himself clean for the most part, if he gets dirty, he will lick the dirt away.  We also have him professionally groomed every month. 

We had first pick of the litter and when we went we had the choice of nine puppies, all of which came up to us and wanted to get attention.  We greeted them all, but after a couple minutes one puppy when off to lay in the shade near the water.  All his brothers (all nine were boys!) were still excited and trying to get attention.  

We chose the lazy puppy lol.  He loves meeting people/dogs, exploring with his nose, and running in short bursts.  But for the most part he just wants cuddles, treats, and sleep.  He is a very gentle, submissive dog."
fastfootlemur,fe78hna,t1_fe0pp7w,"Mine keeps herself clean too, but her white fur is almost never white lol...

And same! I see that most people pick the most social and crazy puppy from the litter, but after owning and raising quite a few puppies, I cringe when I see especially inexperienced families pick hyper puppies because I know what's up ahead without proper training... My mal was the runt of the litter, quite shy and preferred to just chill near you rather than bite your toes.  Ngl she does misbehave once in a while but other than that she's an angel and I wouldn't exchange her for the world. Doesn't chew or destroy anything, dig holes, jump on people, she's just awesome ❤

-Mazzie-,fe2kio2,t1_fe1pfen,Underrated comment right here 😂
blackhole_pussy,fe5ejqw,t1_fe5cdbi,How?
artgreendog,fe19law,t3_enk42v,"If you look closely, you can definitely see this child belongs to the ‘zipper club’, and he has had prior open heart surgery. Belong to that club myself."
rutgherp,fe1ivao,t1_fe19law,me2. 36 years ago. The scar is still a spot i do not want to be touched by someone.
bladel,fe2by5f,t1_fe19law,Tough little guy has been thru a lot already.
ifightwalruses,fe2p899,t1_fe19law,"Gonna take a guess and go heart transplant, I was about the same age when I had mine my scars are eerily similar, he's got the wire scars just below the ""zipper"" and the Mickey tube or as I used to call it a ""cork"" because of the sound it makes when they take it out."
Poor_eyes,fe1pe4w,t1_fe19law,Good catch. One of my bests friends baby has Renpennings syndrome and this immediate reminded me of them. He had open heart surgery when he was a few weeks old and they think he’ll have a feeding tube for life.
stix-and-stones,fe4kowt,t1_fe19law,"I have apparently belonged to the zipper club for almost 24 years and this is the first time I've ever heard of it, how exciting"
jarl-marx,fe3adt4,t1_fe19law,"Possibly, it was an esaphageal surgery that's why he needs a stomach tube."
JointMan47,fe471gd,t1_fe19law,"That’s what we’re called? Everyone’s scar I’ve seen looks like that kids but mine is thicker and pink, the Doctor asked if I wanted it flattened like that and I said no but I was only 8"
BLYNDLUCK,fe4hf9j,t1_fe19law,Looks like he has several laparoscopic scars as well.
ukexpat,fe5h6qo,t1_fe19law,Looks like dad has had abdominal surgery too.
Common_Commenter,fe2chrp,t1_fe1ivao,Mind if I ask why? Does it hurt or is it a personal thing?
acdann,fe34fvj,t1_fe1ivao,"I had major surgery on my chest cavity at 15 and 17 (pectus excavatum). I am now 31 and still hate for the scars on either side of my chest to be touched. I describe it like a phantom sensation. My mind can see the scar being touched, but there’s no input from my skin - and that sends my anxiety levels through the roof."
sprinkles67,fe36b24,t1_fe1ivao,"I've had 6 jaw surgeries that have included breaking the lower jaw and palate.  This resulted in permanent altered sensation in the lower part of my face so that I can't stand being touched there.  Is this the sensation you are describing?  It can be a mixture of strange numbness, tingling, feeling that it doesn't really belong maybe?"
artgreendog,fe2pege,t1_fe2p899,You are correct. Ditto here.
artgreendog,fe2dcca,t1_fe1pe4w,"When one thinks they have it bad, look around as there are others going through a lot worse. I’ve been going to the Mayo Clinic for 17 years now and can’t complain cuz I’m upright and this side of the grass (until God calls me home)."
artgreendog,fe4wsje,t1_fe4kowt,Haha
artgreendog,fe4woax,t1_fe3adt4,Good point.
rutgherp,fe2cmka,t1_fe2chrp,It is not really painful but sensitive to the touch. It has always been like this.
BionicAngel82,fe4o0jl,t1_fe34fvj,"I have the same thing but on my back. I've had the same area cut open 6 times from 2011 to 2019. At the hospitals I don't have an issue with sleeping on my back. However at home I can't...it sends me into a major panic/ anxiety attack. Then after my last 2 surgeries in 2019, my hands and arms go numb just randomly. I also have it where I'm holding something and bam my hand just stops working and drop what I was holding. 
After my first surgery in 2011 my thighs go dead numb after standing or walking for 10 min or more. Like someone could walk up and slice my thigh and I wouldn't know. I can some how still walk when this happens, it just feels like I'm floating. 
I've told my surgeon all this and he just keeps telling me, ""That's sadly some of the risks that can happen with your surgeries.""  So I just have to ""live"" with these."
NoviceoftheWorld,fe3b44k,t1_fe2dcca,Another person's suffering does not invalidate your own.
bynagoshi,fe2iibs,t1_fe2cmka,I had multiple lung collapses and had operations on them. One of the times this spot under my ribs went numb and took a while to not feel all static-y. Now the feeling like it was asleep constantly has gone away but now its only whenever you touch it it gives me that same asleep feeling
sipuli91,fe3g5c6,t1_fe2cmka,I hit my head badly as a kid and needed stitches for the cut. The scar certainly is more sensitive and I hate when I forget that it exists and scratch my head carelessly. It just feels so... wrong in some weird way to scratch that area.
Poor_eyes,fe2k0hs,t1_fe2juh5, I don’t give a shit what people believe if they’re a good person.
rutgherp,fe2l6tj,t1_fe2iibs,Most of the times stuff like this is due to the nerve(endings) in the skin being cut when making incisions.
tabby51260,fe2ln04,t1_fe2iibs,Hey! My lower lip area is like this too thanks to some jaw surgeries.
merylstreepsvag,fe2kmwu,t1_fe2k0hs,I love this.
artgreendog,fe2mwj8,t1_fe2k0hs,"Thank you. Yes, to each their own. You don’t have to agree with me but we still should be kind to all.

There’s too much negativity in this world. One has to be intentional in being positive, and removing toxic people out of their lives, if possible.

Surround yourself with uplifting moments and encouraging words!

Check out the experiments online from Dr. Emoto. Emoto claims that positive words and emotions, classical music and positive prayer directed at water produce beautiful crystals, while negative words and emotions and crude music, such as heavy metal, produce ugly crystals. Water is a very special chemical.

There’s power in our words.

Little words can hurt.   
Little words can heal."
LilyNion,fe2qe5i,t1_fe2l6tj,"Huh. That's interesting. I've had a kidney biopsy on my left side, and ever since I have a dull spot in my left groin, feeling exactly like how /u/bynagoshi describes it. Could a biopsy give the same effect as actual incisions?"
bynagoshi,fe2sa50,t1_fe2l6tj,Yeah thats what the doctors said. I was just describing it to people that dont know what its like
Naticus105,fe5w9jw,t1_fe2l6tj,"Not quite as dramatic but in the past year I've had two surgeries on my nose and they go in through the septum, so the tip of my nose has been awkwardly numb. Not usually as problem but it feels weird as hell every time I blow my nose. It's starting to come back some but I doubt it'll ever be 100%."
Sancho_Villa,fe2rfcz,t1_fe2qe5i,"Yes, but it specifically being a biopsy isnt the issue. Any time you cut cut/poked and things moved around you run a small risk of this. 

Its possible that the nerves will reconnect, but most likely your brain will start to dull out the new input, or lack of input. 

I had a really bad injury to my right arm 2 years ago that left the back of my hand numb and the pain is just now starting to lessen any."
rutgherp,fe2sfju,t1_fe2sa50,heh sorry :)
LilyNion,fe2rkvm,t1_fe2rfcz,"That's so interesting, I had no clue. My doc just told me it wasn't possible and I had to get over it. Thank you for the explanation!"
whatisit84,fe5qwjo,t1_fe2rfcz,"I remember after my csection it took months for me to be able to feel my bladder again. Seems so weird. I would really only realize I had to pee when I got nauseous from having such a full bladder. 

Had a similar experience after the next two abdominal surgeries years later (sleeve gastrectomy and gallbladder removal)."
bynagoshi,fe2t9j3,t1_fe2sfju,Hah no prob good to explain to others
Sancho_Villa,fe2u3g3,t1_fe2rkvm,"""That thing you feel isnt possible"" 

Uh"
ButCaptainThatsMYRum,fe3zpek,t1_fe2rkvm,"Nerves are really cool. Not nearly as interesting as the above comments, but my fiance well asleep on my arm one night and I woke up with ""entrapment"", my pinky and outer ring finger were numb from nerve irritation. Took 10 months for it to just go away, and is still super sensitive. When a doctor worries about nerve damage, they mean it. It's mind boggling that limbs can be reattached and regain mobility."
caelosentire,fe0f8r8,t3_enk42v,That man is ripped!
confusingbrownstate,fe5js8r,t1_fe0f8r8,It says it's just glued on. I don't think he ripped anything.

h4ck0ry,fe2ckzc,t1_fe1ukyo,"I don't get it? Your comment is not sarcastic. It can't be understood in a sarcastic way because it doesn't follow the basic principles of sarcasm.

Perhaps, for better results in the future, actually google about how sarcasm works and what it is. It's a great form of comedy.

'/s' is not an entitlement to say whatever nasty shit you want."
Wild_8pe,fe35qiy,t1_fe1ukyo,It’s kinda hard to interpret text since we can’t see any sign or eye roll or anything that someone were talking to would do.
Makemydaypunks,fe22z5u,t1_fe1ukyo,"This is r/aww, if you wanna be a wise guy go to r/jokes or r/roastme"
Chicken-Nuggett,fe25qlv,t1_fe1ukyo,"Hes making his son happy, not showing off you piece of shit."
ProbablyBearGrylls,fe38teq,t1_fe2ckzc,"I understood it as sarcasm while I was reading it.  Then I saw his edit and figured he was just covering his bases until I saw his downvotes.  Some people get it, and some don’t."
CookieHael,fe2rlyk,t1_fe2ckzc,"I think you should google that yourself, since you’re talking about irony."
shoobiedoobie,fe3935v,t1_fe2ckzc,It can definitely be understood in a sarcastic way. Maybe you should also try looking it up on google.
kindafunnylookin,fe42zu3,t1_fe35qiy,You could just assume that nobody in their right mind could genuinely believe someone would use their sick kid as an excuse to show off their abs.

mafulazula,fe3bdmh,t1_fe16z2q,"Oh, but when I follow kids on the internet it's ""creepy."""
Humanoidfreak,fe12pt8,t3_enk42v,Question. Is this kid gonna have the tube his whole life? How does this work?
BrainstormsBriefcase,fe1gc7i,t1_fe12pt8,"Potentially but probably not. It depends on the cause (and somewhat depressingly, how long his life will be). The good news in kids it’s usually only because they’re growing and oral intake won’t be enough when you factor in the underlying illness, so the vast majority do grow out of it."
stubept,fe2cxrc,t1_fe12pt8,"So clearly from the scar on his chest, it’s for medical reasons. My son has one (ironically, I just changed it yesterday after the bulb popped). He’s had his since he was about 2 weeks old. He was born with spinal issues, fused ribs, and a paralyzed diaphragm. He struggled with breathing so much that when I’m he had to instinctually decide between eating and breathing, he chose breathing.

So in went the g-tube. He turns 4 in March, still has it and still gets most of his nutrition through it. With extensive speech therapy, we’ve worked up to eating purées, pudding and yogurt by mouth. But because he’s known nothing else, trying to teach him to chew has been extremely difficult. 

Obviously, as he gets older it will be easier to instruct him how to go through the process of eating. We don’t expect him to have it forever, but I’d expect at least 2-4 more years before we remove it permanently."
ilikecoconutwater,fe1v1i9,t1_fe12pt8,"It depends on the reason why the tube was placed. If the problem is poor oral intake/poor appetite/aversion to food, then often kids begin to eat more as they get older and find things they like, and the tube gets removed. If the problem is something structural (like an underdeveloped esophagus - esophageal atresia), then the tube is permanent unless the structural issue is fixed by surgery. If it's related to a disease that affects metabolism, they may eat some things by mouth but also use the tube to supplement."
-Socks-,fe1t0z9,t1_fe12pt8,"depends! often it’s actually up to the person. i have one (probably for different reasons but dunno) and i may keep mine. it can be permanent, or just for a few years."
ifightwalruses,fe2qjts,t1_fe12pt8,"Probably not, that's a mickey tube, and can actually be removed/chaged really easily, hell I lost mine diving into a pool when I was a kid, didn't even notice until I went to go take my meds and it wasn't there. If I had to guess this is a feeding tube primarily used to deliver pedialyte or something because the meds he's on makes him have no appetite or make him really nauseous. I got mine when I had my heart transplant at 4, and I think I got rid of it when I was 12 or 13. The hole where it was stays tho, unless you get plastic surgery."

elizabeth498,fe2yhgg,t1_fe1t0z9,"My kid is in the same boat and has a GJ tube that delivers enteral formula and Pedialyte into the jejunum. (The G-port is for venting gas, etc. when he was younger.) Since he’s orally aversive, any medication goes into the tube, which is a huge bonus. 

He has the tube for multiple severe food allergies,  eosinophilia, and motility issues caused by Mitochondrial disease. That said, he starts driver’s training this summer. ;-)"

TheDivineDemon,fe0j5fh,t3_enk42v,Serious question: what's the tube for?
HelloNursie,fe13ojm,t1_fe0j5fh,"There are lots of reasons kids might have a tube, whether they can't swallow due to illness and disability, have feeding aversions, etc. 

One common reason, though is that they have a high calorie requirement or can't eat enough to meet their calorie requirements - this is often due to illness - cystic fibrosis, crohns disease and heart diseases are big ones. 

These people will have the tube, and they will connect up a feed (it kinda looks like an IV, but full of a formula feed), and run it overnight, to boost their calorie intake, nutrient needs, and support them putting on weight.

Edit: I googled this- it turns out this little boy has a congenital heart disease and needs the tube  because he is underweight (most likely because of high energy requirements) but has insufficient oral intake."
Halo5387,fe0km7z,t1_fe0j5fh,Feeding
larswo,fe0oxrh,t1_fe0j5fh,"This model looks very similar to one I had when I was a child. The tube goes inside to the stomach and on the inside there is a small balloon which is inflated to keep the tube from falling out.

You can connect a L-bend tube to the outside of the feeding tube which would then sit perpendicular to the stomach. The white solid part that is pointing towards the belly button is the mechanism used for inflating/deflating the balloon.

The skins/meat sits flush around the tube, but the whole thing can be rotated, which has to be done daily."
MyHerpesItch,fe0lono,t1_fe0j5fh,That's what i was wondering too
californiahapamama,fe2xba1,t1_fe13ojm,"Adults end up with g-tubes too. My husband has one due to a brain injury (dysphagia). A friend has one due to mitochondrial disease. I know someone who had one while being treated for cancer.

Most feeding pumps designed for home use can be tucked in a backpack and taken where ever you need to go."

Ponycat123,fe0r1ej,t1_fe0oxrh,Is it to help sick kids take their medications?
GandalfTheGrey1991,fe0wfge,t1_fe0vz3t,"It puts food in their stomach. They don’t eat through their mouth for various medical reasons. It’s not always a lifetime thing, sometimes it’s only when they’re babies, or they’re waiting for a surgery to fix whatever issue they have."
larswo,fe15tsc,t1_fe0r1ej,"You could give medication through it, but it would mostly be the sort of medication that you could also take by eating pills, so not too common unless they have issues swallowing pills. Mostly used to just feed a formula that is dense on calories to keep them healthy."
larswo,fe14fzs,t1_fe0wfge,"Often used with children that go through chemo/radiation treatment, because they either can't eat or don't have appetite to eat enough. Feeding tube through the nose is a more temporary solution often used, but if you puke a lot it means the tube comes out and has to be reinserted through the nose all the time. Not to mention it brings a lot of discomfort and might inhibit the child from attempting to eat and drink on their own as normal."
-Socks-,fe1tf7g,t1_fe0wfge,"not necessarily! i have one of these! i got it at the start of last year, and i will probably keep mine. people with the tubes will often eat aswell as overnight feeding to keep calories high"

xursian,fe0l30i,t3_enk42v,"curious in all honestly, to why the baby has a feeding tube?"
sunrisechimera,fe0oroj,t1_fe0l30i,"There can be many reasons for a child to require a feeding gastrostomy: 

1. Sometimes they have severe gastroesophageal reflux, so much so that they fail to thrive. 

2. They may have a motility disorder of the oesophagus, that means their oesophagus doesn’t have normal coordinated peristalsis, and can’t swallow properly and are constantly at risk of aspiration. 

3. Some babies are born with tracheosaphageal atresia or fistula (where part of the oesophagus does not form, and/or has a pathway directly into the trachea, which leads to aspiration. 

4. Many neurological, cardiovascular, and respiratory conditions may necessitate feeding tubes either because the child cannot manage coordinated feeding, or because they cannot handle the volumes required. 

Feeding gastrostomies are often preferable to feeding nasogastric tubes if a condition becomes longstanding. 

Some people require g-tubes lifelong, but very often if the underlying condition is reversed, the gastrostomy may be allowed to close. 

I hope that helps :)"
niccih0,fe1mipq,t1_fe0oroj,"My cousin had a feeding tube like that between ages 12 and 17. She had surgery to remove cancer when she was an infant and during the surgery her liver was damaged, they didn't realise this until she was 17. Add this with coeliac's disease giving her a subconscious aversion to food, she would eat like a pigeon regardless of how much she liked the food. The tube didn't help much tho. She got a liver transplant when she was 17, she weighed 33kg before the surgery and was the size of a 10 year old. 10 years later she wears a size medium and weighs 60kg so all is well."

So we'd frequently come home and see her hop back over the wall as we turned onto our street, and then she'd hop back over when we pulled into the driveway like ""oh, hey, you guys are home, I just hopped this because I was so excited to see you...totally"""

The sweater was hanging from the back of a nearby chair, and she probably mistook it for a blanket, and this was the result..."
gorpadorp,fdlw8j6,t1_fdldkwx,Just be honest. Did you in any way move the sweater to make this a (better) photo opportunity?
Nordramor,fdlwuyr,t1_fdlw8j6,"Nope. I figured she would have moved while I pulled out my phone and started filming. She’s not trained to stay still or anything, so it was quite an absurd moment, especially for how long it lasted."
gorpadorp,fdmvskb,t1_fdlwuyr,"It’s not that it’s not plausible, just not believable. A lot of people lie about things on this sub, particularly for karma. If it were a video of her getting into the sweater then you wouldn’t have had so many people casting doubt."
deviousvixen,fdnev4f,t1_fdlxtot,They can. The last time someone e posted a clip like this there were several folks saying this is how their pup died and to be careful.
essywatwyn,fdnis7o,t1_fdnev4f,"Yes, it’s a big fear.  Our siblings once nearly killed each other by getting their jaws caught in each other’s collars while rough playing (luckily, while we were in the room with them).  It was genuinely the most distressing thing we’ve ever experienced.  We managed to part them as one of them was becoming unconscious.  We now remove their collars as soon as we get indoors & avoid wearing them as much as possible.  

They like to chew holes into blankets & shove their heads through.  That’s my biggest fear now.  While it’s amusing to see them waking around with a “cape” on, it wouldn’t be funny if the blanket got caught on something."
deviousvixen,fdnjrji,t1_fdnis7o,Yea I agree on the no collars inside. Most of her cute coats only stay on long enough for us to take a pic.

Codles,fdlbr3t,t1_fdl4ja2,"Yep. That's my dog's tail wag when I put things (like sweaters) on her. It's the ""appeasing my human"" wag."
jayellkay84,fdlv9vd,t1_fdlf3mo,Dachshunds seem to love dachshund shaped things. And doing things over and over to make a human laugh.

Nordramor,fdlf2xu,t1_fdlbr3t,"Milly hates clothing generally, but likes being covered by blankets and such.

That is her ‘human is talking to me better wag tail’ response. She pretty does it when she knows you’re speaking to her, because she (correctly) assumes it usually leads to me breaking down and giving her snacks. She has a cute tail."

DuckyDoodleDandy,fdk0s9g,t1_fdjmt0w,"It is mounted in a corner of the ceiling. I’ve seen it before. A toddler or small child can’t knock it over or unplug it and it gives a better view than one that sits on a dresser next to the bed. 

I had a younger brother who could have benefited from 24/7 monitoring. At age 5, he managed to set his bed on fire while playing with matches. That is just one of many, many things he did if an adult wasn’t watching. 

A child may have a right to privacy, but the parents still have the obligation to keep them safe. I say that each child’s maturity, self control, understanding of household rules (ie don’t play with fire, etc), and other things also need to be added to the equation. The presence of an infant and a nanny in the home justify the camera."
earthwormjim91,fdkp6uh,t1_fdjmt0w,"Uh yeah, that's how you're supposed to mount them."
CocodaMonkey,fdjd8gr,t1_fdjcj99,Baby monitors are normally mounted these days. It being mounted doesn't mean anything beyond the fact that they have a baby monitor.
jackasseress,fdjd5cj,t1_fdjcj99,"I mean, mounting my baby monitor took all of 5 minutes and two screws. These things are pretty simple these days"
Dozekar,fdkbm7x,t1_fdjs9ct,"No, once they're relatively safe on their own their privacy needs to be respected.  Usually a 4 year old will be safe bathing, but you still supervise them and if you don't help they won't get themselves very clean.  In addition if you leave them and they drown though that's on you (criminal negligence).  You are legally responsible for ensuring the safety of children until they can ensure that for themselves.

You're also morally responsible for giving them privacy when you can afford to and when it is reasonable and safe to do so.  IE if the kid starts fires in the house, or otherwise engaging in dangerous behavior for themselves and others then you need to take appropriate measures.

These are frequently conflicting directives as they get older and it's the responsibility of the parent to ensure they're making reasonable choices with respect to giving them enough agency and privacy while still ensuring their safety."
apollo_316,fdl3eb0,t1_fdk88f8,"Exact same setup at my house. One to watch over my fluffies in the living room and one watching for porch pirates/visitors. Creepiest thing about the cameras, and I tell everyone this, is you never know who else could be watching, especially with P2P cameras. I unplug the living room one when people are over."
a_is_b,fdka29p,t1_fdk88f8,So you just check in a couple a times a day when  you're gone?
a_is_b,fdmucsd,t1_fdll9sm,"I am aware of that but as I said: where I come from nobody has one. If water leaks I'll find out when I get home (we only have a dishwasher and it has some advanced leak stopping mechanism so very unlikely), vandalism and burglaries are almost nonexistent here and if my boyfriend has an accident he can call for help himself. And lets assume he has a stroke and can't call for help: I'd have to check the cameras very regularly to be able to see it and call an ambulance. That seems crazy to me, constantly checking in, in case something is wrong. 

I understand wanting to have this feeling of security but I think it's futile to try and be 100% safe. The water might leak while I'm asleep, my boyfriend might have a stroke while taking a walk in nature, etc. These are things we cannot ever control entirely and the idea of me having to check in all the time is very stressful to me and not worth the little bit of security I would gain.

I can imagine though that if you live in a country where crime is an issue or maybe if you have kids, that's a different story."

ClamPuddingCake,fdklew3,t1_fdjiv9l,I'd say NOT knowing of being recorded is even worse.
RawkPeepl,fdj8nr4,t1_fdj3tgt,I definitely don’t look at my sons camera more than to check he’s okay right when I lay down before I go to bed. Not everyone stares at the monitor. It’s also nice to see if your kid is dreaming or actually crying or if they wake up and need help or are fine. It’s crappy when you go in their room and accidentally wake them up bc you thought you heard them cry when they didn’t. Most people don’t do it to invade privacy but as a convenience for everyone.
stylinred,fdkahz2,t1_fdjikog,A child has no say in any parenting matter. Point is moot
stylinred,fdk9xh9,t1_fdjm6xs,"Why? They're babies, they could get hurt, be in trouble, be taken, your nanny could be abusive, safety measures could prove useless/dangerous, etc. you wouldn't know unless you had an eye on the situation."

I don't know what age this would be, maybe 3 or 4?

The idea is that if I hear noise in the room in the middle of the night, I can check the monitor to see what the kids are doing. If they're just dancing to the white noise machine or playing with toys, whatever. But if they're trying to scale furniture, I'm going to intervene before they get hurt."

There's nothing wrong with using new technology to make life easier. Just because you got up and down at night for three kids doesn't mean another parent isn't allowed to look at a screen from the comfort of bed. Don't gatekeep parenting. Let people have things."
rollingForInitiative,fdjm1n7,t1_fdjl23n,Indeed.
Meganstefanie,fdjsste,t1_fdjl23n,"Yeah, other comments are saying “but it’s so much easier to mount a camera directly over my kids’ beds so I don’t have to walk upstairs to check on them all the time!” but that seems super lazy to me (and I’m normally the type of person that’s all for parents doing whatever they can to get more rest/preserve their sanity). You’d rather strip your kid of what little privacy they have at that age than walk to their bedroom a couple of times a night?"
rollingForInitiative,fdmjg20,t1_fdlcgd9,"Well, personally I would say that video monitoring an almost-5-year-old would be a bit much. As I said, children around that age start doing private stuff sometimes, wouldn't want to catch that on camera."

IRLNameIsNils,fdjmeax,t1_fdiysep,"Wouldn’t the most secure path for home surveillance be a purely offline system?
Video/audio feed exclusively closed circuit"
Dozekar,fdkd0w4,t1_fdiysep,"While this is one side of it, anything that doesn't have open ports to the internet and can't send audio is going to mitigate 99.99% of the attacks of that nature.

These attacks are almost always against devices that are either opening routes via pnp on a consumer router or they're against the service's web frontend.  On the frontend it's primarily wildly insecure sites or stolen credentials that get targeted.  Unfortunately these are the cheapest ways of operating by far and I'd avoid anything offering web camera viewing for those reasons.

Anything CAN be hacked.  The likely hood with reasonable precautions is absurdly low though.

We're also talking about the same population of people who frequently use 5 year old smartphones with exploits that cannot be patched that fully own the device.  There are bigger fish to fry."
Dozekar,fdkdbkz,t1_fdjfmjt,Most cameras like this attempt to open a port for connections on the router through something called plug and play (pnp).  This is something that scanning can detect pretty easily if the port successfully gets opened.  Depending on how obviously the scanning is being done even consumer grade routers can sometimes temporarily blacklist the scanner and notify you of the attempt.
Dozekar,fdkdl7f,t1_fdjpxc6,"Usually you would start to worry about this sometime before 6 personally. At 4 it's not much of an issue to me. I've never had monitoring for my kids over 3, but my house is pretty small and my two older kids were able to come and get us if they needed us at that point and the baby monitor was audio only (because they're cheap and why would I need video).  Especially if you have (or had) a kid with health or waking during the night issues it might be helpful."
AutoCrossMiata,fdj41hc,t1_fdj0lot,"I disagree, many cameras, even enterprise grade, have horrendous security. Think of hard coded default passwords and lack of input sanitation. Just because a device is behind the firewall doesn't mean it doesn't have anything open talking externally. What if the camera is hosting it's own web server to enable remote access?

Best way, but pretty dang unreasonable for the average consumer, would be to put any IOT devices on a separate vlan and use access control."
bubliksmaz,fdj9pd0,t1_fdj0lot,"The band is completely irrelevant. It's an IP camera, it's exposed to the whole internet."
KairuByte,fdjkp9d,t1_fdj0lot,"Er... What?

What exactly do you think splitting your WiFi is going to do? Most routers just bridge the networks anyway, not to mention that actually removing that bridge would make a large number of IoT devices useless as they require a connection to a PC or phone.

You’re also going to run into problems with older devices just not supporting 5Ghz at all."
rollingForInitiative,fdjumdw,t1_fdjs6ec,"Yeah, but using a computer doesn't rob another person of their privacy. Constant surveillance of a child isn't bad because it's lazy, it's bad because it's creepy. Whatever if it's an infant, but if the child is older, it becomes creepy real fast. I don't mean creepy here as in something predatory, more like invasive in a dystopian sense."
HeckingLoveDogs,fdjo8nn,t1_fdjmeax,"Ideally yes, closed circuit.

thundermuffin54,fdjxu9q,t1_fdjr7xs,"It's not necessarily about 'creepiness' it's about autonomy and invasion of privacy for the kid. At that age, they need to begin to have a sense of self and privacy. Stepping on those boundaries can cause issues in development."
KairuByte,fdjyebr,t1_fdjxu9q,"I half agree, if I’m being honest. 

I’ve actually had a surveillance cam in my teens bedroom before for legitimate security and family safety reasons, no creepiness or invasion of privacy intended.

In my case at least, there was a legitimate threat to the family unit, and it was explained to the teen and agreed upon before installation. The problem comes when the six year old doesn’t *fully* understand.

And that’s the crux of the reason I only half agree. 

If the camera is needed, wether the internet believes the need to be legitimate, how does one properly convey this to the child? You can’t necessarily explain the situation well enough for them to understand that a) something is wrong b) we need to be able to see in here at all times c) you will be recorded whenever you are in here (or anywhere but the bathrooms in my specific case) d) you have no choice because of a and b."

Dozekar,fdkfwpc,t1_fdjm2bu,"I feel like a broken record posting this but it really depends on a lot of things.  Do they have a nanny or other hired caregiver?  Does the kid have a medical history?  There's a lot we don't know, including things like does the camera have a movement threshold set really high that rarely triggers an alert unless the kid is up and moving around a lot at night.

Without these pieces of information judgement seems really premature, though discomfort with the idea is still reasonable."
jamzz101101,fdjq4vc,t1_fdjfviu,If they hurt themselves they will call out. Not like they won't be heard in the house with the rest of the family around. No one needs cameras in bedrooms
TheRebuttoning,fdkkbct,t1_fdkfwpc,I completely agree. I nanny two boys that are pretty heavily on the spectrum. I am very grateful the parents have cameras so I can check in while they are sleeping. Sometimes the older boy throws fits in his room. The camera let's me know if I need to let him yell himself out or if I need to intervine for his safety (I'm instructed by the therapists to ignore certain behaviors unless they pose a danger to himself). The younger one wakes up easily and is hard to get back down. Once again I use the camera to make sure that he is asleep without walking into his room.
BlondeGirl12,fdl09mk,t1_fdkfwpc,"Thank you! 

My family has cameras in 3 places and it's honestly not that big of a deal. We have a disabled family member living in our home and yes, she has privacy in her room and bathroom. If my child was a frequent walker/night terrors I'd want to be able to make sure they were okay. It's honestly not like they are sitting there watching 24/7."
jwdjr2004,fdj9orf,t3_ellck2,People just record their kids in their bedrooms and post it on the internet now? Even just having a camera in there seems like a massive invasion of privacy.

Dozekar,fdkg3b4,t1_fdj999b,TBH this is the sort of behavior you want to reward kids for so that would work out.  You reward them reasonably for good behavior and punish them reasonably for bad behavior.  That's how parenting and pretty much all supervision works.
doglover2248,fdk36hl,t3_ellck2,While that is a sweet moment between your children. That's really creepy to me to have a video camera in your children's bedroom. We have cameras outside our house.

amiga1,fdjcjos,t3_ellck2,people always hack into these. the fact that people actually put cameras in their homes astonishes me.
woahhhface,fdj89ue,t3_ellck2,"My younger sister and I fought constantly as kids; we were only a year and a half apart in age. My younger sister was often the instigator, but my parents usually didn't believe me, to my continual frustration. She got away with a lot which made me resent her more as we grew up. In addition to regular sibling troubles, we had other problems stemming from being so close in age. We were always referred to as ""the girls"" and treated a lot like twins, getting the same things all the time. My younger sister was often jealous and always insisted she had the same things I had. Reflecting now, I know she just wanted to be like me, but as a child I was very resentful of that too. I felt like i never had anything that was *only* mine. When we were small, I didn't hate her, but years of fighting between us eventually drove me to that point. It's taken many years to repair our relationship now that we are adults.

I write this all out just to say, really listen to each of your daughters when they complain to you about the other (particularly during or after a fight). It may also be helpful to try and provide them each a few toys or activities that are their own *thing* they don't have to share. And if they get to preteen age and are still fighting each other, invest in family therapy. I really wish my parents had."
BobosBigSister,fdjjr37,t1_fdj89ue,"My sister was less than two years older than me, too. She made it clear, my whole life, that she would have been perfectly happy if I'd never been born and refused to play with me, etc. We didn't fight much, she just ignored me in a super mean way. I spent most of my life trying to please her so she'd want to be my friend. If my parents had known she would never outgrow it, maybe they'd have done counseling with us...  Since she decided to break contact completely a couple of years ago, I've found that I don't actually miss her. I'm still sad we don't have a friendly relationship, but she was the most mean and critical person in my life and the stress of seeing her/ trying to be ""good enough,"" etc. is just gone now."

I just wanted so bad for her to like me and stop making me the object of her humiliating jokes. I was really non-verbal and would end up losing my temper and hitting or breaking things. It wasn't until I was an adult that our younger brother clued me in to how manipulative and mean she was, especially to me. After trying for a long time, neither of us are in touch with her any more.

If your statement was true any state owned camera (especially police cameras on cars or worn by officers) would be facing this literally constantly.  Any house they respond to might have a kid in a bath or changing and any city pool some dumb kid might take off their swimsuit.  Kids are fucking weird.  Every nanny cam would fall foul of this.

My Mom took me around the house and said, ""Your sister has always been your protector."" and then proceeded to show me about a dozen pics of us together when we were really young. Every. Fucking. Picture she had her arm around me, or was standing in a protective way, or her hand was on my shoulder. 

I seriously lost it and balled my eyes out right there. It was something I was totally blind to, but now? It just made me appreciate her even more, and love her just that much more.

She hobbled over to me for hugs and comfort, still crying. I felt as if I was trying to console a 4 yr old.

Ever since that encounter, Remi kept a 10 ft radius between her and the cat.

On the other hand, I have lost track of how many violent ankle biters I have bled from or seen fully commit to an attack on another animal.

Lokirocky,fdpb7h9,t1_fdpa783,"-20C is cold enough they don’t let children outside for recess here in Canada. There’s no way you were outside in just a t-shirt “for hours” just reading a book. Fingers, toes and earlobes will get frost bitten if exposed for anything between 30-45 minutes in those temperatures."
tacosauce2020,fdpaxr8,t1_fdpa783,"I do not believe that for a second. I live in an area that experiences some pretty cold temperatures. The body doesn't ""get used"" to extreme colds like that. It may not bother you as much, but sitting outside reading a book for hours in nothing but a thin shirt will give you hypothermia. That's just how the body works.

tacosauce2020,fdpbybe,t1_fdpb3t5,I know cold blooded doesn't mean you like it cold lol. I knew how someone would interpret that part that's why I added lizard to hopefully clarify what ai meant with out going into a whole schpeel (is that how you spell that?) about our bodies don't adjust to extreme temperatures like that because we have to maintain 98.6 or somewhere close to it and without something to provide you heat you will die in -20 and now I've done this whole comment I didn't want to type out in the first place
Squawnk,fdpb1s4,t1_fdpaefi,"Err, no. I replied to u/allhopeissean
He didn't mention Celsius, all he mentioned was it not being that cold in Alaska right now, I responded to him arguing that -20°F is pretty cold imo since that's been the average temperature for the past 2 weeks where I'm at in Alaska. I'm not sure why you've taken such offense at my comment to him but I guess sorry I confused you, I hope you have a nice day, go look at more dogs"

My friends, friend just got this two year old white pit/lab mix and he's such a big sweetie.. he gets nipped at by the smaller dogs, and just leaves them be because he's bigger and knows it, and decides not to use it. I respect that dog lol.. anyway, he was gonna be put down because he's previous owner couldn't bother to figure out his poor diet, and the way he was being fed was causing him to have stomach issues and puke a lot.. they were going to put him down because of that. Luckily they intervened took him home, got him some better food and started feeding him smaller portions more often throughout the day and bam.. hes perfectly healthy and normal pupper, hasn't puked once. The owners before just make me sad...sorry went off on a tangent. It's just heartbreaking to see sweet animals, in positions like that.. or any really."

AlrightWings0179,fdhoaht,t3_elegoj,How does a cat sit at a shelter for 7 years and never get adopted?
GabuEx,fdhujee,t1_fdhoaht,"I volunteered at a shelter at one point that had had a cat for years.  She was a temperamental, grumpy kitty who really needed to get to know you before she'd give you the time of day.  All of us at the shelter knew she was a great cat, but the introduction every prospective adopter got was a cranky cat that did *not* want to be touched in any way by someone she was unfamiliar with.  When you put her beside a tiny kitten who loves you the moment she sees you and is purring up a storm the moment you pick her up, it's just not really much of a contest for most people.

She did eventually get adopted by a very nice lady who specifically wanted to adopt the cat we'd had the longest specifically since she knew those were the hardest to adopt out.  Last I heard, the kitty was very happy in her new home.  Bless that lady's heart for giving that older kitty a chance. :)"
oversharpenedpencil,fdi09to,t1_fdhoaht,"We think no one wanted to deal with her shedding- it's really bad. Plus, she is honestly incredibly chill and not touchy feely. I can see why she got passed over for cats that will rub up on you or even meow to get your attention. The kicker was that she was not the longest resident. There was an older cat that we felt would have been very distressed living with a 2yr old."
Leelluu,fdhzq3d,t1_fdhoaht,"Sometimes, it can be as simple as growing out of kittenhood or being plain in appearance. There are a ridiculously high number of people who are only interested in adopting a kitten, even to the extent that they won't consider an 8 month old cat. It's much harder to find homes for adult cats than kittens. Also, people can be super picky about the color of cat they want. They will come in and meet the sweetest, most affectionate cat and rave about how he's exactly what they're looking for ""if only he wasn't all black"".

Also, not getting adopted quickly can be self-reenforcing. People looking to adopt will opt not to meet or spend time with a cat that they know has been in the shelter a long time because they assume/decide that the cat must have something wrong with it to not have already been adopted."
ManyLintRollers,fdi0ll7,t1_fdhoaht,"I used to volunteer at a shelter and there was a cat who had been there a LONG time;  she wasn't a fan of new people or being picked up so she always was passed up for the cuddlier friendlier cats.  The man who finally adopted her was fine with her not being a super affectionate cat;  he just wanted a cat to hang out with him and understood she didn't like to be picked up.  She would be affectionate but it had to be HER choice and it took her a while to find someone who appreciated that.  

Our two cats came from a shelter and they were marked down 2-for-1 adoption fee as they were 6 years old and one was terrified of new people and the other didn't like to be picked up.  Once they got used to our family they were perfect;  the shy one is the biggest love sponge in the world and lives to be cuddled, petted and carried around (she still is terrified of new people but she loves our family) and the feisty one has quite the personality.  She's my husband's favorite as he admires her spirit.  She will come and sit on you but it has to be HER choice;  but she loves to just hang out sociably near you."
Philiaravon,fdhy3qh,t1_fdhoaht,"I've volunteered and worked at a shelter.  We had a cat that is a diluted tortie and she was probably something like 12 years old.  I don't know how long she was at the shelter but I know it was long as in two years.  She was the oldest cat as well as the most problematic.  She couldn't walk her hind legs very well, and couldn't use the litter box very well.  She also one of those testy cats too.  She'll bite you if you try to pick her up.  One of our shelter coordinators loved her and wanted her to have a lot of chances... when honestly she would had been put down already.  On top of that, when a pet bites someone in the shelter, they get pulled to a ten day quarantine.  Rules were very strict about that and Sheeba (that's her name) got pulled often where she barely got any audiences to see her which also compounds the problem to the length of her stay."
ScorpionicRaven,fdhomfi,t1_fdhoaht,"Bad luck sometimes. Other 'cuter' cats show up and get adopted before. If she was especially shy, many may have not wanted to adopt since they want a bubbly kitty instead."
Mrs_Boombalatti,fdio4wp,t1_fdhoaht,"My dog (short hair collie 80/85 lbs) was at a vet after being abandoned for over a year&1/2. She was 6 months when she was dropped off at the vet. 
After about a year, She was kinda mean and nippy and other kennel attendants would just push her dog food thru the fence. 
We had outdoor runs and she stayed in the cage almost all day.

I was a poop scooper and on weekends we had to walk all the dogs while the vet was closed. I wasn’t scared of butters but she had gotten me on the keen cap once. Anyway the Dr said he couldn’t just keep her there anymore Christmas was coming and all the runs and cages were booked.
So I took her home. She jumped in the back out my Subaru like she’s done it 100s of times. I was a bit nervous but after the first few night she totally changed.
She was upset and angry at her life and I don’t blame her but she’s not a bad girl.
So she was passed over time and again for being a ‘caution dog’ but that wasn’t her at all. now she’s 14 and snoozing peacefully with her best beagle buddy. 

If the vet hadn’t kept her I never would have met my best friend. Plus she was free :)"
CharlieBrown1964,fdiynat,t1_fdhoaht,"My son adopted Quinn back in August. (You can see her picture if you search ""quinn""). Quinn was adopted a couple times, only to be returned weeks later because all she did was hide. She was at the shelter 4yrs.

She was the same with my son. But some time late Nov or early Dec, she started coming out. He was patient with her, and she is now trusting him enough to lay with him. She still runs and hides from strangers. That will take more time.

He adopted Quinn along with Wayne. That way she (they) won't be alone during the day when he works. They are his children, and our grand-kitties."
SmallSacrifice,fdhy9em,t1_fdhujee,"You basically described our rescue.  When we first saw him, he was backed into a corner of a filing cabinet growling at everyone.  He took a swipe at someone who tried to pet him. He had been there 4 years and the volunteer said he was really a sweet cat, he just hated other cats and being in the viewing room.  We were all ""nawwww not that grump"" and kept checking out other cats.

About 10 minutes later, the volunteer started crying and pointed beside me where I was sitting on the floor.  Blizzard had snuck down to sit beside me and was slightly leaning against my leg.  He growled when I reached to pet him but stayed put.  She begged us to take him, saying he had never done that with anyone.  So we took him.

He never hid when we got him home but you couldn't pick him up or pet him, even when he chose to sit beside you or on your lap.  We basically had to pretend he wasn't there if he came up to us.  We were so patient with him.

Now, 4 years later, he is the most affectionate, snuggly, lap dog of a cat.  He runs to the door to greet us.  We can carry him around on our shoulder and he asks to be picked up.  He sleeps on my chest and constantly asks my husband for head bumps.  Just this year, after countless patient visits, he let my nieces pet him.  He also let us rub his belly this year.

He almost died in April and has a myriad of health problems now, but when he is sick or scared he comes to us instead of hiding.  He is stable and not in pain most of the time.

Totally worth it!"
Taleya,fdhy5h3,t1_fdhujee,"Look at from the cat's POV:  after that long, it's their home.   Fuck these strangers who keep coming in and pokin' 'em."
mshtrtz,fdhvy11,t1_fdhujee,That is so sweet of that lady!
Binsky89,fdi6mna,t1_fdhujee,"If I didn't keep acquiring cats in the wild, my plan was to do this. But, we recently got a 3rd, and that's probably enough for now. In 10 or so years maybe I can do this."
WhitePackaging,fdikeb7,t1_fdhujee,"Whenever we get back from deployment and I get a place of my own, this going to be the first thing I do."
Roxerz,fdinmfc,t1_fdhujee,"You described one of my cats, her name is Dharma. She was a bitch to me for all 2 or 3 years of her life since birth. She was the only kitten no one wanted to adopt and we kept her with her mother who was our cat. When we gave her arch rival, Mia, away for adoption to a friend, Dharma became the sweetest cat ever even though she scratched me last night. We adopt strays we find but Mia hated other cats since she was a kitten and caused all the other cats to be constantly stressed. The dynamics changed and the Dharma I know for her first 2 or 3 years is a different cat today who sleeps on my head."
Nighttraincapt,fdit978,t1_fdhujee,"I adopted an older, cranky cat from a shelter. She scratched me bad a couple of times, completely randomly. I found out after she got really sick that she had a thyroid problem. With a daily little pill she became super chill and happy. She died a year ago from kidney disease. I miss you old girl!"
Lifeformz,fdid37e,t1_fdi0ll7,"My (at adoption old, 10/12yr+) black moggy was handed around several times in a couple months before I got her. I was made to promise that if I didn't want her, I'd hand her back. I'm guessing because she'd been returned several times already. I assured the rescue that if I adopt, it'll be her last ever new home. As long as she was not sad or stressed, even if she didn't want anything to do with me beyond me caring for her basic needs (food, medical care, pooping etc), I would promise she could live here forever. 

2 years on and somethings really clicked with her; she's devoted to me, adores me, will sit for hours with me, on me, by me. But doesn't really love a lot of stroking, and that's ok. But, it's only me, will tolerate my dad visiting, hisses at my mum, hates going to kitty jail, hisses when I pick her back up. But 5 mins after, she's my baby again, devoted back to me!"
PurpleT0rnado,fdhyu42,t1_fdhy3qh,"What makes a tortie diluted, and what does that look like?"
jenn1222,fdhysjn,t1_fdhy9em,My Aunt and Uncle had a cat like that.  His name was Bogus.  LOL!  You were allowed to accept his love but not to give love.  He would allow you to pet him if you acted like you didn't realize you were petting him!  Which...is pretty bogus.
Don_Quixote81,fdi5dqq,t1_fdhy9em,"Cats choose their people. He obviously knew you were a good one, even if he couldn't quite let himself trust you fully yet.

My mum's cat was a rescue, and even after five years she still doesn't like to be touched very much. She won't sit and be stroked, but she will brush herself up against your leg constantly, to show affection. She just approaches people on her own terms."
GabuEx,fdhzoxg,t1_fdhy9em,"Aww, that's such a nice story. :)  We had similar suspicions about our cat, that being around so many other cats may have been stressing her out.  I understand that she chilled out in a big way after getting a home where she was the only kitty there."
claireV,fdifsgt,t1_fdhy9em,"This is like our cat Barb! She was secluded out of the cat room in a little cage on her own because she “didn’t like other cats.” We met with all the kittens, and didn’t even have an exceptional first meeting with Barb, but the shelter volunteer said something about loving Barb bc she followed her around the office and I guess that sold us! 

When we got her home she was terrified of everything, took her about 3 months to not be scared of the TV, but now 4 years later she is the snuggliest lap cat. Even meets us at the back door when we get home assuming she isn’t snuggled up somewhere warm and cozy.  I could go on and on hahaha - she’s the best 😍"
Chief_doge,fdi48nw,t1_fdhy9em,"No matter what happens from now on, that grumpy guy will have had the best thing happen to him that he could have experienced! Hes one lucky bastard to have encountered you. Love your story"

Do you have a picture of Blizzard? This story really touched my heart. Especially the volunteer crying bit. It was like he chose you guys as his owners :)"
freckledfarkle,fdixpmc,t1_fdhy9em,"I had a cat like that. Hid for 3 years if anyone besides me, my husband and baby were home. After 3 years he decided he is safe. Never,ever hid again. Followed the kids everywhere. 
Loved everyone he ever met. He lived a wonderful, happy, safe and loved life for all the rest of his days. Once he knew he was truly safe he just blossomed. It was amazing. Miss you Oscar❤"

CharlieBrown1964,fdiyyb5,t1_fdhy9em,You are proof that it's the pet that picks the owner.
Neee-wom,fdi2u0e,t1_fdhyu42,"A tortishell is black and orange, in varying patterns.  If they’re dilute it’s very faded/muted so it looks almost blue or mauve and yellow."
Philiaravon,fdi5zd9,t1_fdhyu42,Torties (nicknamed from a tortoiseshell) are more black and gold brown while the diluted torties is more gray and beige.  [https://i.redd.it/du5ghjmu9qc31.png](https://i.redd.it/du5ghjmu9qc31.png)
future_forward,fdio0oz,t1_fdhysjn,"Haha, what's in a name? That's awesome."
blueyedreamer,fdjaqge,t1_fdhysjn,"Yes!! Omg my mom has a cat named shadow is seriously a shadow to everyone but me and my mom. And by that I mean she doesn't even want other people seeing her. She's 9 years old, has lived with myself and my family her whole life (I brought her home in the middle of winter at less than a week old) and it wasn't until a year or two ago that I was able to obviously intentionally pet her. And she sees me every single day and runs up to pet herself on me constantly. And when I sit down she's in my face... but still gets grumpy 75% of the time that I try to pet her normally Haha."
caitejane310,fdib6d0,t1_fdi5dqq,"6 years later my rescue will only let you pet her on her terms. She just wants you to hold your hand it while she rubs against it. I'm the only person she feels comfortable enough to lay next to, and she wants me to hold her tail or else she'll run away at the slightest movement."
SmallSacrifice,fdi0eh9,t1_fdhzoxg,He is our snuggle bug!  I can't imagine being confined to a room with 20 other humans...I feel their pain.

PurpleT0rnado,fdreskv,t1_fdi5zd9,"Thanks! I have not seen many of those. Where we live there are a lot of cats that are mostly white with varying sizes and number of Tortie spots/splotches. I'm wondering if that's what happens to a line that comes out of a tortie mom with no supplemental tortie genes down the line. I've even seen one that is all white, except for top of head and base of tail."
mmak0316,fdiund3,t1_fdiugdz,"Ahh what an absolute sweetheart! This made my day, thank you!"
Philiaravon,fdruug4,t1_fdreskv,"Torties don't have a speck of white.  Calicos do however.  You're thinking of calicos and most tri color cats (black, orange and white) are actually female while the orange or black and white are males.  There are rare exceptions to this rule though.  [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calico\_cat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calico_cat)"
SmallSacrifice,fdivn3c,t1_fdiund3,Awe thanks!  We think he is pretty adorable!  Xxx
PurpleT0rnado,fdvqxcq,t1_fdruug4,"Yes, most of them do appear to be calicos. But I was under the impression that like Tortoiseshells, Calicos were also always female."
niTro_sMurph,fdhpmky,t3_elegoj,My cat runs when I look at him. I can only pet him if I walk towards him backwards.
oversharpenedpencil,fdhpw7l,t1_fdhpmky,"She was very much like that at first, had to act very nonchalant to get even a half pet in!"
moonlove_,fdi2j26,t1_fdhpmky,lmao! we have to do the same thing with our baby 🤣 he thinks when we walk up it's a game of chase so to throw him off we've been approaching backwards.
caitejane310,fdic5tz,t1_fdhpmky,"Lmao, I feel your pain. My scaredy cat will cry and cry for you to open her window of opportunity (to go outside) and run away as soon as you get anywhere near her. So, you have to open the window and walk away like you're not paying attention. Kinda sucks when it's as cold as it is or there's a lot of bugs outside. Same thing when she wants food. She'll cry and cry, then once you get near her WITH THE FOOD SHE WANTED she runs away like you've scared the shit out of her."

rockheart0103,fdhhunu,t1_fdhhmfk,"Tell your daughter the name is amazing, and she's smart for her age for picking an adult over the kittens. At that age, if given a choice I would've picked a kitten in a heartbeat. (I still want a kitten someday, but I know it can be better to pick an adult.)"

Awkward-Whereas,fdi7pmt,t3_elegoj,"My rescue kitty had been at the shelter two years and was just shyly sitting in her cage when we came in to adopt a cat. We weren't going to take her except that the cat we did want was apparently best friends with her and we felt guilty about breaking them up.

Best decision ever, she is the sweetest, cuddliest, most friendly and affectionate cat in the world. She just wants to be with me, she gives me the sweetest little licks and forehead kisses. I love both of my cats, but I kinda love her just a little bit more."
cruznick06,fdjp8s1,t1_fdi7pmt,Awesome on you for keeping bonded cats together and giving her a chance. :)
whatadeebee,fdijr13,t3_elegoj,"2.5 years ago we adopted a 2 senior kitties -a bonded brother pair who were 10 years old and had been back and forth to the shelter 3 times. Having limited experience with cats until then, I expected them to hide for a while and be pretty shy at first. What I got instead was a pair of barnacles, within 2 days they were glued to me, sleeping in bed next to me, taking turns sitting on my lap, licking my hair. I have no idea why they were returned to the shelter so many times. They are the most darling cats, so affectionate and playful. I can say for sure they will never go back to a shelter ever again."
Merovingian89,fdhtizt,t3_elegoj,"Our Melly Belly spent her first 4 years in a shelter. She is the sweetest, most patient, affectionate cat I have ever had. I am glad every single day that we adopted her and finally gave her a good home."
soccermom43,fdhz8ov,t3_elegoj,"These are the best ones.  I thought my rescue was the oldest one in the shelter and he lived another 10 years! He was so appreciative and just loved his bologna and a quiet place to sleep.  It's sad that he died alone. During a routine vet procedure he had a heart attack.  I hope he didn't think he'd been abandoned again. I still cry about that sometimes. Ahh pets, you always wonder if the joy outweighs the pain of their loss when you're in the thick of it."
Green_8_1,fdhzq4b,t3_elegoj,"She is so beautiful girl! It's good to hear that she start to trust you. Now should be much easier for you to become her friend!

If I can suggest something, I would take her bell, I know that is probably for other animals but usually it not work properly and It's extremely irritating for a cat (their hearing is much more sensitive than ours)"
oversharpenedpencil,fdi4x0o,t1_fdhzq4b,Thank you! I will detach it. She's an inside kitty and does not interact with our dogs (they are more disinterested in her than she is in them! Ha!).

caraniente,fdhywwd,t3_elegoj,"Awwww such a sweetheart! Well done for adopting this gorgeous girl. I'm sure she will become even more confident in time. We have a shy shelter girl who we adopted 2 years ago - for the 1st month all I ever saw of her was eyes in the darkness of her chosen hidey hole. Then she would occasionally come out for treats and strokes, but hide again. Then she would come out, but only if we were sat down. At 2 years, I can now walk past her wherever she is, stop by her bed and give her a cuddle without her flinching away, and she will hop up on the sofa next to me and demand pets until she decides she's done.

She still tends to hide - at the moment she's sleeping on the dining chair under protection of the table - but she's still gaining confidence every day. And even if she never becomes a lap cat, we are grateful every day we chose her. I'm sure your kitty and you will bring each other just as much joy, and she'll realise how much trust she can have in a real home!"
pickled-papaya,fdik0be,t3_elegoj,"Aww, I remember the first ear scritch with my kitty. She was semi-feral when I got her and she spent about a month behind the couch. She demands lots of snuggles nowadays! Still hides from guests, though."

Aztec111,fdil2vk,t3_elegoj,"When we got one of our current shelter kitties they had told me they had 8 adoptions that day. I saw her and she was fluffy and beautiful and sweet, a ginger Ragamuffin. I wondered why she hadn't been adopted. Well she also growled lol. I knew she was just scared but the shelter even put on her card that they weren't sure about her growling. I thought what the heck, she hasn't bitten or scratched, just growled lol. An older person couldn't care for her anymore. So I snatched her up and omg she is the sweetest girl!  She growled at our other kitty just the first day and that was it. You just go with your gut."

EveryPersonality4,fdi4gpv,t3_elegoj,"This brings to mind the movie ""The Shawshank Redemption"".  Red, during his life sentence, went in front of a parole board, and was asked if he was ""rehabilitated"".  The first 4-5 times, he tried to say the right things, thinking to say what he thought the board wanted to hear.  On the final time they asked him the question and his answer was along the lines of ""I may, and I may not be, but it really doesn't matter because you people will just do what you want anyways.""   With that statement of basic detachment, the parole board released him.

I wonder what it was about this cat that kept him from being adopted for 7 years.  And what changed in her that finally made someone adopt her.

Nowadays we have freaking awesome video compression codecs meaning we can get things that look way better than a gif at a fraction of the file size.. and we’ve actually ended up with videos that have the quality of gifs. And now we have “gifs with sound”.

That being said, I would absolutely adopt this adorable goof in a second."

psylirabbit,fdj2yvu,t1_fdiyain,Your comment has got me very curious . Could you tell me a little about the dogs daily life and what kind of mobility it has ? I’m not asking for laughs . Im asking because I’m often amazed and inspired by how f@*%ing determined dogs can be .
clarkrd,fdj38qs,t1_fdj2yvu,you misread.   their dog has all it's limbs
BlameableEmu,fdj49bh,t1_fdj2ni1,"Hugging and hip thrust is hug, hug is saying don't stop. My large dog used to hug my arm but there was no humping."

And even like a shiv scar from when he fought off the cholos from Block C during that riot. Man that was a close one, too. Fucking Sanfran Fred wasn't so lucky, but, I mean ""eso si que es"", right? Maybe next time those C punks raise the bell we're ready for em. Maybe we raise the bell and when Fat Rico tries running to his crew we catch him and take him to the laundry room.

forebodingfox,fdin6vh,t1_fdiekyz,I can promise you she is :) I used to work at a vet clinic and saw my fair share of various amputations. It was always way more difficult helping the owners adjust then the pets. Most hardly even seem to notice their handicap.

forebodingfox,fdl1y2d,t1_fdjhbbb,"Honestly I'm not sure how much worse potential joint problems would be for this dog, but even assuming there is an increased risk of joint problems I would feel safe in betting that their vet has planned with them on ways to help control those issues and minimize the damage done."

dengop,fditq9k,t3_eliw0e,"I bet the dog is happy and is being loved and all, but isn't this posture bad for his spine?

I'm wondering if it would be better to get those wheeled harness to prevent any potential spine problem in the future. I'm not saying the owner should get it and not judging the owner for not getting either. I think by adopting or living with this dog in itself is commendable. It was just a thought."
Nessiemcnubbins,fdiy07b,t1_fditq9k,"She'll have wheels eventually, she's too young yet. We'll measure her for wheels in the next month or so😊"
thedirtyprojector,fdjgl69,t1_fditq9k,"Yes, holding this posture is actually bad for the dog. But as OP said, she'll probably get wheels soon so its Gucci."

shaxiaomao,fdxknzo,t1_fdx56w7,I think she and her husband own the gym so maybe she uses it off-hours.
BlasphemyMc,fdxnv38,t1_fdx56w7,She must own it. Do t know a lot of gyms that allow dogs to roam freely in them.
2easy619,fdxirem,t1_fdx56w7,"I went to a gym like this and I had it all to myself for like 6 months. Then I found out the owner took an enormous amount of debt from all these guys in town and they would come visit him and joke that time was running up. 

One day I come in and start my pullups and this guy is watching a baseball game screaming that the Giants suck! Turns out he was gambling the money he was being loaned, no joke, he would find someone else to loan him money and pay the rent for the month and then gamble the rest. 

I couldn't go anymore just because of my genuine dislike for this guy. It kinda sucked because that gym was so convenient for me.

Edit - I forgot to mention years later I met someone at a bar/poolhall that claimed the gym owner owed him 10k! I was blown away at how many people were loaning this guy money."
Rhombus910,fdzcf8t,t1_fdx56w7,"She owns it. She and her husband moved to Kansas city to open that gym.

Edit: They were neighbors of mine when they first came. They are super nice, and he is ridiculously buff as well."

DefinitelyNotAliens,fdz16dc,t1_fdyqj6o,My kickboxing class was slammed this last month. I hadn't ever seen about 1/3 and only half the class was regulars. Some off and on people in. It was nuts and we had to double up and share bags for the first time ever. I get fitness or weight loss as a goal but it was pretty bad.

Khal_Kitty,fdzuxi9,t1_fdyug9b,Costco has 2 year memberships for 24 hour fitness. Comes out to like $17 a month and no initiation fees or anything like that. Only thing is you have to fork over the $430 up front.

MonsterRider80,fdzdoro,t1_fdyz8xv,Not the point. The gym gets full of people who won’t be there anymore in February. I have full respect for people wanting to get in good shape. I have nothing but scorn for the 75% who start in January and by the 20th they don’t bother anymore.
MonsterRider80,fdzfr9k,t1_fdyuata,"Hey, if you’re showing up regularly and actually commit to it, I love that and respect that all the way. Fuck, no one is actually in the mood every time, sometimes you gotta kick yourself in the butt to go work out. But those are the best workouts, and that’s when you get that post workout endorphin rush because you’re doing something worthwhile."
MonsterRider80,fdzf08z,t1_fdz16dc,"Yup. That’s what I mean. If youre gonna join something and actually show up regularly and have some real dedication, I encourage those people wholeheartedly. People who show for one week, half-ass everything, stay 2 hours but actually work out for 15 minutes, and they don’t bother showing up anymore after 3 weeks,  I have nothing but contempt for them."

reality_star_wars,fdz4p4p,t1_fdz3jik,Ha! Yes they do though I think it's just for show as I've never seen it go off.

althanan,fe00syw,t1_fdyxf26,The cheapest gym around here is $80 a month and is barely open past regular business hours...
Bleedthebeat,fe0ckvw,t1_fdyxf26,There’s a 24 hour gym near me that is either $10/mo flat fee or $20/mo which drops to $5/mo if you go more than 12 times in the previous month.

The standard rules of conduct already handle any problems they may cause intentionally and having a trainer on staff means they have no need to step in and give pointers that could be misinterpreted as harassment."
Fuck_auto_tabs,fdz5jdk,t1_fdz4p4p,The fact that its there is just a few of reasons why I dislike the PF concept.
Fuck_auto_tabs,fdzxpnx,t1_fdzxdok,Legitimately interested. What constituted a lunk in these cases?
Khal_Kitty,fdzw1en,t1_fdzv5l2,"Yup I renew every two years. They say the Costco thing is only for new members, but they don’t care. I know quite a few others who do the same. 

They have the all location membership for a little more if you move a lot.

Edit: actually both are all-club memberships. The one that costs more includes the Super Sport gyms (bigger and nicer ones)."

1 being itchy skin, 10 being anaphylactic shock

EDIT: BAD IDEA! Don’t listen to me"
TaintTickleMaster,fdx8x4l,t1_fdwmoqp,Both my girlfriend I are allergic to cats. We have 3.
naina9290,fdxgu2k,t1_fdwmoqp,"My dog will hunt flies as well, but she hates being picked up so we have to wait for them to get low enough."
rosebeats1,fdynl1v,t1_fdwmoqp,"RIP.  I don't have a very strong desire to have cats because I kinda like dogs more anyway, but they are still cute and more importantly, being allergic has been messing with my dating too :("
feor1300,fdzulbp,t1_fdwmoqp,"I've seen people using Chameleons like anti-bug pistols. Just pick it up, point it at the bug, wait a few moments, and it'll snare it with its tongue from like a foot away.

Outside of that, sphinxes are always an option."
MeltyLotus,fdxke64,t1_fdwmoqp,"There so  hypoallergenic cat breeds out there. Some will require baths to help their skin/coat others like cats should be groomed, my cats love the bush, and it helps get rid of so much hair, which is very helpful when the seasons get warmer and the cat starts to shed a lot of coat."
MatsuoManh,fdzy17c,t1_fdz3bjt,Yikes !!!
TheWizard_Fox,fdx59j7,t1_fdwymja,"No! Even though people with mild allergies can get somewhat desensitized in the context of chronic exposure, it’s NOT recommended to get an animal if you are allergic. Chronic rhinosinusitis, asthma, etc... can all occur with chronic allergen exposure."
Starseeker2019,fdx67wf,t1_fdwymja,"I would say it's at 3 or 4 which sounds quite mild. However, when I play with cats or dogs, eventually I will start feeling as if someone ninja-jammed a bag of leaky and moldy cotton Bags up my nose."
Rayblon,fdxb97b,t1_fdx59j7,"I was allergic to the point of getting wheezy in the same room as cats. I was allergic to my own cats for years. Now i can adapt to any cat within days and get no reaction at all from my own cats. 

Personal experience aside, allergen immunotherapy/exposure  therapy is a valid approach to handling pet allergies, and you should consult with your doctor to see if you're responsive to it. It's a seriously powerful treatment that has saved my life more than a few times with regards to some of my other allergies."
H-ost19,fdxkpcd,t1_fdx59j7,"This is so oddly relevant to me. Uninteresting backstory ahead...

I've been a carpenter for about 10 years, had 2 dogs in the last 20, been very active with hiking and camping, and I love both dogs and my job. For a very long to me I have had sporadic symptoms from something unknown to me. I become uncharacteristically tired/lethargic, my vision gets blurry at least once a day sometimes for very long periods, I can be very itchy and have very dry skin, my joints often ache and swell, and my heart/lungs have given me plenty of concern over the years (although, I do smoke).

Last year I had a life threatening situation happen to me caused by over exposure to a massive amount of cedar, and I assumed that I was allergic. 2 months ago I was working on a side project and my sinuses were severely attacked (Doug fir was the wood this time). 

In light of the most recent problem, I got an allergy test this week. As it turns out, I'm very allergic to grass (hiking/camping), very allergic to dogs and cats (damn), very allergic to dust mites (homelife and work), and. Very allergic to most of the different types of wood they tested for (work).

So to sum up, potentially many of my problems that I attributed to ""getting older faster than my peers"" could have been caused by allergies in my day to day life. So ironic that I am a carpenter, hah."
Marcitos5,fdx9ovd,t1_fdx59j7,Really? I didn’t know this. Do you have a source?
Azeron955,fdz8z6t,t1_fdx59j7,"Yeah can confirm, dont do it"
Patrickrk,fdzlqhe,t1_fdx59j7,I’m mildly allergic to cats. My parents had two my entire life. I had really bad allergies year round and I slept like shit. Then I moved away to college and the allergies stopped and I started sleeping better. But I’d go back home for break and they’d start back up again.
Marcitos5,fdxa0bc,t1_fdx67wf,"As someone already mentioned, there may be complications from having an animal while you’re allergic. Don’t listen to me and my ignorant mind lol"
TheWizard_Fox,fdxkyyz,t1_fdxkpcd,"I don’t say this stuff lightly.

Immunotherapy does work but we typically only give it to patients that can’t avoid a certain exposure. It’s almost always best to avoid the allergen if possible."
Rayblon,fdxm3wq,t1_fdxeuhn,"They would recommend allergen immunotherapy if avoidance presents a sufficient loss of quality of life or isn't possible, which for some, like myself, it is. Incidental exposure is almost inevitable with most allergens besides, and having the buffer that immunotherpy provides is still lifesaving."
H-ost19,fdxlu98,t1_fdxkyyz,"Well now they have me taking 2 types of allergy medicine once a day for the rest of my life. It may not be related but I have felt more awake this week. Here's to hoping.

Unfortunately I no longer have a dog so I'm good there, for now, but I know me and will probably get another one in a few years. I understand this is not a smart idea.

My job is my job but I will be using a respirator when doing any milling or sanding. I also know which woods to limit working with.

I will be purchasing a set of allergenic covers for the bed fixings."
TheWizard_Fox,fdxlwwd,t1_fdxlu98,Good luck! Allergies suck.
Rayblon,fdy9l5y,t1_fdxmw1r,"And if it sufficiently impacts your quality of life, you can get immunotherapy and a cat. Half my immediate family has had immunotherapy for moderate cat allergies for the purpose of continuing to enjoy our cats and future cats, with our allergist's blessing. We'd have just muscled through it otherwise because our cats give us more enjoyment than our allergies detract from it, even knowing that the allergies may worsen without warning. It's ultimately a deeply individual and personal assessment.

Safest and best aren't the same thing. For me and many others, the benefits of having the companions that we do far outshine the risk and drawbacks of our allergies, making us stronger for having them."

From the day we arrive on the planet
And blinking, step into the sun
There is more to see than can ever be seen
More to do than can ever be done

There is far too much to take in here
More to find than can ever be found
But the sun rolling high
Through the sapphire sky
Keeps great and small on the endless round

It's the Circle of Life
And it moves us all
Through despair and hope
Through faith and love
'Til we find our place
On the path unwinding
In the circle
The Circle of *GULP*"
