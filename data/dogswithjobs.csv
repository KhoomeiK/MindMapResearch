Allow me to introduce Patsy the wonder dog. In the early hours of 31 December 2019, while fire in Corryong was bearing down them, she and my brother rounded up the sheep and brought them to the safest paddock on the farm. She then found a safe spot while my brother fought the fire with a tractor and a tank of water. Almost all sheep are safe, along with the hay bales and silage, the shearing shed, and both farm houses. My brother doesn’t do social media, but Patsy does. Great job little girl 🙂

Update 7 January 2020 - Patsy and her family are busy cleaning up the farm and helping others get sorted out. You can help too! They would love you to donate to these bushfire relief fundraising collections:

HelloFerret,fdiwadb,t1_fdi5lbq,"Well done, Patsy!"
neveahAgin,fdj3oso,t1_fdi5lbq,"Yo other redditors, don't just go donating to random online funds.

Don't be a dummy!"
blahblahrasputan,fdjdtzg,t1_fdj3oso,"I just want to add to this: there are many great fundraisers going on especially for niche things like a town, or a person who lost a lot etc. But there are always going to be scams. On top of these two facts a lot of these legit fundraisers will be a few months before the fundraiser stops, money is sorted, and ACTUALLY donated.

DO YOUR RESEARCH

If you would like to be lazy and not bother researching, and you live outside of Australia (meaning you don't already know about these services as every Aussie should), then these are legit direct places to donate and do the most help:

- [NSW RFS](https://www.rfs.nsw.gov.au/volunteer/support-your-local-brigade) this is the one I donated to (my home town in my home state) all rural fire fighter donations go to help fund our thousands of volunteers that are struggling with how long this fire season has run so far
- [VIC CFA](https://www.cfa.vic.gov.au/about/supporting-cfa)  The VIC Fire service is starting to hurt bad also, among other states, they need donations
- [WIRES](https://www.wires.org.au/donate-goods) is our national wildlife rescue and the best place if you want to donate to wildlife. There are a lot of smaller places helping of course but these guys hold the ultimate responsibility
- [St Vincent de Paul Society Bushfire Appeal](https://donate.vinnies.org.au/appeals-nsw/vinnies-nsw-bushfire-appeal-nsw) - Helping those affected with food, clothing, furniture, other
- [Red Cross](https://redcross.org.au/campaigns/disaster-relief-and-recovery-new-years-eve) how could I forget, these guys are always first on the scene for people in need.

[Full donation thread is overwhelming but many great links](https://old.reddit.com/r/australia/comments/ejqncy/ways_to_donate_fundraise_and_volunteer_this/?utm_content=t1_fdhgj5q&utm_medium=usertext&utm_name=UpliftingNews&utm_source=reddit) on /r/australia

Edit: I should also add that a lot of these fundraisers are going towards the above links anyway....

Edit: added red cross

Edit: and for Aussies some of the best things we can do is offer help to those in need like a place to stay, and help these small town economies on your next holiday. Donations are great during the crisis but economy helps a town recover after the crisis is over."

birda13,fdioiu5,t3_eliw6u,"Wondering if anyone from Australia can explain a related trend I've noticed from following not only this bushfire, but past ones as well.  It appeared to me (very much an ignorant North American here) that livestock losses are often quite high in Australia during bushfires.  Now having lived and worked in parts of western Canada prone to wildfires and while livestock losses due occur during these fires, they don't seem to at the same magnitude.  When I lived in BC, the ranchers that I spoke to and worked with said that they will cut fences/open gates and otherwise turn livestock loose to escape if there's an immediate threat of fire (in fact provincial agencies recommend this as a last resort if stock can't be evacuated).  Is this not done as often in Australia?  Or is the fence network too complex?  I'm just curious if anyone can explain this as I know we have a number of stock dog trainers and owners that frequent this subreddit and I recall some being from Australia."
Kaleb_G,fdiputu,t1_fdioiu5,Would really love to see a reply. Generally curious as a farmer myself. I wonder if it’s the size of the fires that’s a problem more.
thecatandthecobra,fdj255f,t1_fdioiu5,"I live on a dairy farm in an affected area of the bushfires. Because we are in a severe drought and the land is SO dry, once a fire starts, it moves extremely fast and is highly unpredictable. Last Saturday was the most devastating day for my area (we reached a high of 47 degrees on our property that day) the high winds suddenly hit in the early evening, and swept the fire storm our way. As soon as the wind hit, were forced to evacuate within minutes. The wind blew a massive amount of burnt/lit debris and ash over our farm. And the wind did not blow in the direction that had been forecast. 
Basically I’m trying to suggest that the unfortunate loss of livestock is due to the unpredictable nature of an Australian bushfire."
Leathit,fdiqgux,t1_fdioiu5,"Not a farmer so there’s probably someone who could answer this question better than I can.
From my experience living in rural areas farmers try to save livestock where they can, but bushfires in Australia are very unpredictable and fast moving, conditions can change very fast so in a lot of cases it’s all people can do to get their families to safety. I think another issue is that there just no shelter for livestock when fires of these magnitude occur, it’s these farmers livelihoods though so I’d say they do everything they can to save their livestock."
Buddhamama50,fdiyxhr,t1_fdioiu5,"They do open the fences, but the fires are too fast. The animals get trapped along the roads, as well."
waxingnotwaning,fdj2i1a,t1_fdioiu5,"The fires move faster than the animals can run. Kangaroos can run at high speeds for miles and jump fences and they are caught by them, domestic animals don't stand a chance. The heat is so intense, goes will often start in trees ahead off the fire, igniting just to from the heat. Australian has are designed to burn."
Attilla_the_Fun,fdj6x1s,t1_fdioiu5,"The most severe fires in my part of Canada  are in the boreal forest where it tends to be too rocky or boggy to keep much livestock. We get fires in places like La Ronge, High Level, and Fort McMurray whereas most of the agriculture is found to the south."
chalk_in_boots,fdjkfw9,t1_fdioiu5,"The fire can run a lot faster than livestock, and with how incredibly vast most properties are, it really just isn't feasible when you're not sure that you'll even be able to make it out. Our fires burn hotter and faster than yours, and rapid wind changes make it sometimes impossible to predict. The number of people who, this season, are getting told to ""shelter in place"" is ridiculously high, and these people would be rising their lives for livestock that is almost guaranteed to die anyway. It's awful, not just for the animals, but for the farmers who lose their entire source of income, for the communities that have to rebuild and try to stay alive when there is no money coming in."
RatherCurtResponse,fdj6gps,t1_fdioiu5,"I'd imagine the amount of navigable land is so much greater, combined with the harsh conditions, that losses are even greater from a full release. It's not like in montana where you can round them up eventually / expect your neighbor to bring them back"
blahblahrasputan,fdjf2ib,t1_fdioiu5,"The farms are very large, in the middle of nowhere and the fires move extremely fast in unpredictable directions. Much faster than the animals can move."
GAYM3XICAN,fdjmbeu,t1_fdioiu5,"The Black Saturday bushfires were as powerful as 1,500 Hiroshima sized atomic bombs. Flames were recorded as high as 35 metres and people would have to be 150m away to be safe. Those fires were powerful enough to create their own weather events and they caused wind drafts of up to 120kph, enough to snap trees.

404userdoesnotexist,fdj9m2l,t1_fdiputu,"Australia and Canada have very different climates. Australia is much drier which creates faster burning fuel and is also of course significantly hotter.

I'm not an expert but I'd imagine Canadian fires would be easier (although still difficult) to predict and contain.

It's the speed and unpredictability that gets you. A fire may have a 5km front which then changes to a 100km front racing toward you at 20km/h, as is often the case with grassfires. When you then have 100 livestock, there's nothing you can do."
alexxxor,fdjod8h,t1_fdiputu,The scale of these fires dwarfs what you see in the Northern hemisphere.
birda13,fdirb35,t1_fdiqgux,That's kind of what I thought.  That bushfires in Australia burn much faster than our forest fires here in Canada which would limit the reaction time farmers would have to evacuate or turn livestock loose let alone get their families to safety.
vanillamoonlight,fdj20r1,t1_fdiyxhr,"I can’t speak for livestock, but I can speak for what they say to the humans, and that is that the fires can come so fast, and that they recommend that you either plan to stay and not leave, or plan to leave very early. So many deaths are from people who’ve left it too late trying to leave- there’s often no place safe to go, or no safe way to get there, and that’s for humans in cars, not herds of sheep."

gayboobs1,fdv0lew,t1_fdu8g5p,Middle row very right. That’s my dog.
Hope-And-Handler,fdvmgiu,t1_fdu8g5p,"Yeah, one reason I really like my program is they train multiple types of dogs. Like, not all will go on to be cardiac or diabetic alert, not all will go on to be mobility assistance, not all will go on to be court house dogs, but all can go on to essentially be very very well trained ESAs or ""companion dogs"" which do provide a lot of help to disabled children.

I don't know if the program has ever had a dog fail at being a ""companion dog""."

specklesinc,fdtrrxh,t3_en38cr,How can one dog give up 11 pups in one litter?
Deathnell,fdu0v2u,t1_fdtrrxh,It was her first litter and very unexpected. There was thirteen originally but two didn't survive. This picture is from a few years ago and was her first litter. Her second and third litter had close to the same amount of puppies.
AlexandritePhoenix,fdtwhf2,t1_fdtrrxh,Litters can be even bigger than that.
3_roses,fdviqsp,t1_fdtrrxh,"Dr at work delivered 18 via c-section once, they can have huge litters"
mayidescend,fdx1ljl,t1_fdtrrxh,"The litter my dog came from (not a service dog, but successfully trained for certain task by me, but is an ESA- the differences are confusing) had 12 puppies. My dog was the runt. Shes a pit mix. The mom was pure bred. The family who owned the mom didn’t know what the male dog was, never even saw it apparently.
They ended up giving the puppies away in the walmart parking lot at 4 and a half weeks. They said they didn’t want the puppies anymore, they were too much work.
All the puppies were in rough shape. I picked first, though. I picked the one that was the darkest (most were white).


Then my families dog (a great dane) came from a litter of 12 as well. 

My family also had a pekingese who came from a litter of 8.

But then a beagle who came from a litter of two.

So i guess it varies, definitely."
OstentatiousSock,fdxe14g,t1_fdtrrxh,My Labrador that we bred when I was a kid had 10 puppies every time. Labradors can have very big litters.
6tardis6,fdukkzd,t1_fdu0v2u,"Since it’s been a few years, do you know how many puppies actually made it through training to be working service dogs?"
scooooba,fdulcz0,t1_fdu0v2u,"Thirteens my lucky number! I’ve been looking to take on a new pup since I had to put my baby girl down December 5th. If any of these wonderful pups don’t make the wheelchair cut, and you’re near the east coast, let me know 🥴 but otherwise, some good boys and girls ready to lead!"
Molecular_Machine,fdvywz1,t1_fdviqsp,Mama must have been a sphere!
pasunejen,fdxiund,t1_fdx1ljl,"I just looked at a growth chart and great dane puppies are 15-30 lbs at 8 weeks, obviously larger if kept with mom until 10 weeks. Mind boggled at the idea of 12x  puppies of that size (plus at least one adult!) in a single living space. Breeder must have been beyond relieved when everybody finally went home with their new owners!"
bunnybelle98,fdxlsu4,t1_fdx1ljl,"hey just so you know, if your dog is trained in a specific task to help you with your disability, it’s a service animal. not sure if someone misinformed you"

mayidescend,fdxqj9e,t1_fdxiund,"I met the great dane at 8 weeks, so the dane already grew out most of the puppy looks. I just googled the average litter size and an article came up saying that a great dane breeder had a litter of 19!!! Now thats wild.

mayidescend,fdxpmtj,t1_fdxlsu4,"Shes an ESA, but I’ve trained her for off leash walking so incase she ever got loose her shoulder stays in line with mine. I also did distraction prevention: if she sees something she’s interested in, she sits and looks at me if we are walking, or she just looks at me and stares at me until she thinks the ‘distraction’ is gone. To lay on me if I’m hurting/anxious. To howl if I fall (help). To nudge me/alert me when i yawn lots (something I usually dont pick up on, and is a sign of migraine)- she also does it when my neck hurts unprompted sometimes.

I used to have seizures and They were triggered by migraines and/or anxiety. Even though I haven’t had them in a few years, its super important to keep both my migraines and anxiety under wraps as much as possible incase I were to ever seize again.

I never take her in public (grocery stores, clothing stores, and stuff like that), but I do take her in places that allow dogs when I am able, like pet stores, tractor supply, farm stores, parks.

I never thought I’d be able to train her as an alert dog, but shes been quite good at it.
She lays by my side when I’m hurting as comfort as well.

I don’t feel comfortable calling her anything but an ESA, however.
Her task are no where near life saving for me. And she started training when she was 7 (shes 9 now). So a bit old. That and I’ve had people tell me she could never be a service animal. Idk."
bunnybelle98,fdxuqu7,t1_fdxpmtj,"well honestly if she’s alerting you to migraines, and those can trigger seizures for you, that’s a service animal. there are lots of service animals that just alert diabetic owners when their blood sugar is low. it sounds like you’ve trained her to be extremely well behaved too. that’s all the makings of a service animal.

i know you said it’s not life-saving, but if you are ever in a situation where it would be helpful for your health to take her into public, then you should absolutely feel free to do so! :)"
Pretty_Soldier,fdzuye8,t1_fdxpmtj,"As someone who works at a clothing store, please bring your well behaved pets in! We honestly love it, at least at my store. I’ve only encountered one poorly behaved dog at my current store and the owner was clearly trying to break the jumping habit.

Deathnell,fdvf6vj,t1_fdu8rb3,Since they all look so similar they use colored bandanas to keep them identified. They are all given a color at birth so they can track their weight.  They keep the color until they are placed with a raiser and given a name

He's extremely intuitive, and it always surprises us how much he understands."
Sam309,fe89x85,t1_fe88r2m,"Bringing awareness to the fact. I’m sure they’re a good owner, not shaming them. Lots of people are ignorant of the situation.

And yes, the scientific consensus on pugs, bulldogs and other short faced dogs artificially induced by natural selection is that they have life-long, persistent respiratory problems, higher risk of cancer, shorter lifespans, and other chronic conditions caused by their *clearly unnatural* short snout."

If someone told me that they smashed a mallet onto a dog’s snout because they wanted to make him look cute then, yes, I would second guess them.

Sam309,fe99y0y,t1_fe8pydd,"Ok, so if they know about the deformities and breathing troubles and respiratory problems... why do they buy them? Most people don’t adopt pugs, they buy them from breeders, and it’s most likely that this commenter did that. They forked over cash to buy a deformed animal that will have an objectively worse quality of life than a dog that looks normal, and now that money is being used to create *more* miserable pancake-faced dogs.

Do you not see how that is a problem? I couldn’t care less about how this person feels about their dog, it’s objectively wrong to buy and own them."

SerenityM3oW,fea0ntb,t1_fe99y0y,The idea that every pug is gonna have issues is hilarious.   In fact I don't know any pugs that have issues ...   And I know a few.    Their life span is average 12-15years and there are retro mops that are making a resurgence. They are pugs bred to have a longer snout and fewer health issues.

IamTheEagle,fe8f7g5,t3_eo254l,"This always amazes me. 4 years ago the whole family was staying at my parents house and I had a panic attack while sitting in my old room on the 3rd floor. My sister's Australian Shepherd, Lilo, sensed it from the first floor of the house and came running to me immediately to comfort me.

Then last year, I was at church and the worship leader has a service dog he brings every Sunday, an Aussie named Cincy, and Cincy detected a kid on the other side of building was having panic attack. The worship leader and I watched him take off down the hallway and chased after him. We turn the corner into the children's Sunday school room and there's Cincy, laying next to a crying kid, with his head in the kids lap, trying to comfort him.

Dogs are amazing!"

brixton75,fe8803f,t3_eo254l,I need to know how one gets a dog like this...my little brother who is awesome has mental health issues and a dog like this would change his life.
hoodie_thief,fe8gn9s,t1_fe8803f,"They’re great! It’s usually important to get a dog that’s bred specifically to be a service dog (unless you’re lucky and happen across an angel of a dog). There are service dog breeders and trainers and programs/organizations you can buy them from! They all have their own websites, and you should look into it :)

However, they definitely should be the last thing someone tries, after they’ve exhausted all other resources. They are very expensive and the person has to commit to taking care of it and keeping up its training for the rest of its life, which is constant awareness of what they are doing and how they and other people (including friends and family) interact with them. Most of them end up washing out for seemingly no reason, and even one bad experience can cause that (such as another dog attacking them or too many occasions of dogs coming over to play while it’s on the job), so you’re left with a well trained super expensive dog for the rest of its life. 

Also, many people with mental health disorders are negatively affected by SDs due to the constant attention it draws in public. You get people staring, interrogations by people who don’t know the laws, people coming up thinking it’s acceptable to ask personal questions about their disabilities, accusations that it’s a fake service dog or that they don’t need one, and the oh so creepy people who take photos/videos of them. But if the person has a good temper and doesn’t have much social anxiety, then it’s not too much of a problem!

MarlyMonster,fe9i54p,t1_fe8803f,"If you’re in North America it’s possible to obtain and train a dog yourself. You could get a rescue and work with a trainer. This method is definitely not recommended for severe medical conditions like diabetes or seizure detection, but for mental health service dogs there aren’t as many super strict criteria or life or death tasks to learn. A lot of dogs have a natural ability to sense emotions and moods, so with a trainer that specializes in this sort of thing you can simply teach the dog to direct that natural ability to sense someone’s mental state. 

Definitely do your research about private training at home, as well as trainers and their reviews. Speak to the trainer before you get the dog, and they might even be able to help you select the right rescue dog to work with. 

My SO is a veteran and a close friend of him is a dog trainer. He came across a rescue that kept getting returned to the shelter, so he trained him to help my SO with his ptsd. Just goes to show that with the right training even a “problem dog” can be a service animal."
daydreams356,febyn88,t1_fe8803f,"You can either purchase a trained dog or work with a trainer and train one yourself. I have a few trainers I can refer you to who can share the process with you and help you take the right first steps. 

I want to make note that the Fab Four dog breeds are BY FAR the most likely dogs to be successful in service work. For tasks requiring a dog to sense emotional issues in a person without becoming distraught themselves, I always push standard poodles. They are incredibly intuitive but do not become affected by a negative mental state as many dog breeds do. 

Fab Four: Standard Poodle, Labrador Retriever, Golden Retriever, Smooth (or rough) Collies. 

Anyone suggesting to get a rescue or random dog is way off base. Service dog flunk outs for health or behavior reasons are INSANELY high and putting the amount of time and money into a dog required to do any kind of service work is just too much to risk it unless you have a lot of time and money to spend on a high likelihood of just a well trained pet dog."
menialfucker,feaatg0,t1_fe8803f,"Your brother needs a note from a psychiatrist or doctor before anything else. Even if you want to self train a dog you can get into trouble by the law if someone decides to calls the cops and they find out you have a dog that is doing public access illegally. (This is in my own country, so check the laws in yours regarding it) Also like someone else said, it might not be the best for someone who is anxious in public because it draws attention to you. Also if you get approved, buy a pure-bred dog from a certified breeder. Labradors, golden retrievers and poodles are the easiest and best service dogs. Mixed breeds are not as predictable with temperament as they grow older and shelter dogs can have trauma that prevents them from doing service work. Good luck to your little brother!"
galebird,feac4rg,t1_fe9i54p,"The wording of this worried me a little. Regardless of the tasks the dog is being trained in doing ALL service dogs must have the ability to work in public confidently and safely. There's no variation there and that's actually more likely what prevents a rescue from working - if they have had bad experiences that preclude confidently working in public then it's irresponsible to make them live that kind of life. I say this as someone who received a dog from an agency who sadly had immaculate skills but had been failed socially. It happens :-/ Rescues are just at higher risk for it. 

We now have a dog for my son that I actually did what you describe here with: she came well trained with an amazing variety of skills for someone with mobility impairments. However, my son needed a dog to help with his autism. She responded to his needs immediately and I married her skills to his behaviors plus taught her behavior disruptions (nuzzling, touching with paw, laying on lap). The training isn't too hard and honestly can be a lot of fun amid a lot of work but get you a solid, confident doggo first if you're going to be working them in public."
daydreams356,febzqzy,t1_fe9i54p,"I’d absolutely never suggest to just “pick up a rescue” for a service dog, ESPECIALLY with mental related issues. The vast majority of dog breed mixes in shelters are breeds that are highly and deeply affected by the emotional state of their handler. Forcing a dog like that to do work requiring them to be hyper sensitive to these states is akin to abuse. I’d only suggest obtaining a rescue for service work if you are a highly skilled trainer and willing to risk high odds of a flunk out. It’s definitely possible, but just not recommended unless you have $10,000 or more to put into a pet only dog without public access rights.

One of the “Fab Four” breeds are highly recommended for anyone training their own dog or those looking into service work. These should be from a quality breeder that health tests and breeds to standard to ensure the temperament and health are predictable and correct. The Fab Four includes golden retrievers, Labrador retrievers, smooth/rough collies, and standard poodles. 

Standard poodles are, by far, the best breed for tasks related to mental states like anxiety. This is due to their extreme levels of intuitiveness TO your mental and physical state along with the fact that the mental state of their handler rarely personally affects them."
mandyrooba,feafmxx,t1_feaatg0,"This isn’t accurate. (Edit: this info is for the US) You can self train, and once they are trained to do a task that the person needs because of a disability, you can bring them in public. You don’t need any documentation and it’s illegal for anyone to ask for it. However, whether your dog was professionally or self trained, they can be asked to leave the public place if they are making a mess or out of the owner’s control."
MarlyMonster,feawqra,t1_feac4rg,"Sorry, I’m in the middle of exam week so my fried brain is having a hard time coming up with eloquent wording haha. 

What I meant with making that distinction between medical alert dogs and mental health service dogs is the sense that the task of detecting a change in body chemicals isn’t something that should be left up to a private trainer, but is something that should be handled by a professional organization dedicated to training animals for this purpose. 

You are definitely correct, mental health assistance dogs definitely need to be just as equipped to handle social and public situations as guide dogs or medical alert dogs would. Though for things like ptsd that isn’t always necessarily, which is why some rescues are okay for at-home only tasks. My SO suffers from nightmares and sometimes anxiety so his service dog is trained mainly to wake him up at night. His job isn’t so much outside in day to day life, so he doesn’t need to be as conditioned to coming out in public. 

But it’s definitely best to train every dog to come out in public, even if they don’t always have to be when assisting! Allows for some great training basics"
menialfucker,feaklc0,t1_feafmxx,"You do need documentation in my country, I do not know where the person lives so it's better to be safe than sorry with mentioning that. In my country we also have service dog Id cards in certain places. It is illegal for people to ask for documentation yes, but cops can ask if you've been told by a psychiatrist or doctor if you need one (ie. ""do you have the proper documents for a service dog"" they can't ask to see it) and if you need to go to court about any service dog mishaps you absolutely need to bring the documentation to prove it's a real service dog.

Generally speaking, federal law comes first. State law can grant additional freedoms, but can't add restrictions. For example, mini horses are federally recognized, but most states only recognize dogs. That means mini horse handlers can ignore state law for things protected by the ADA, like public access. But they wouldn't be covered under additional state benefits like access for animals still in training or anti-interference laws.

howellscastle23,fe79hza,t3_eo254l,"Without sound I’m skeptical the dog is “detecting the anxiety” and not just responding to the sad noise the handler makes. This video is obviously a purposeful demonstration so for the dog to be detecting the smell of cortisol there would need to be a sample present on the handler, however the dog does not “detect” until the handler begins acting distressed. This is an anxiety response task, not a detection."

> Oakley alerted and acted 3 times at the airport today. I caught the last ones on video because I could feel them coming.

> One of the many tasks Oakley performs is alerting to anxiety/panic attacks and de-escalating them.
He has been taught to break my hands apart and away from my face and is supposed to encourage me to put my hands and even face on him - which calms me down. I think he did an excellent job!

> There is so much to say on this matter, but I will just leave this video here for you to see for yourself. Sharing this video and these things make me vulnerable, but I’m sharing them with you so you can see how this dog has changed my life. This video was much longer but was edited down for viewing purposes.

Also from experience, yes I could have had enough time to record a panic attack now that I've had several. The thing about panic attacks is that they get worse the more that you have, the knowledge that they're coming makes them more likely. That's why interruptions like the dog is doing are so helpful, breaking the panic cycle. Anxiety is a bitch."
ifyouhaveany,fe8pfjc,t1_fe79hza,"I would assume this dog is doing the same thing my dog does, which is reacting to specific noises or gestures.

My dog isn't a certified ESA/service animal, but she absolutely knows when I'm having an anxiety attack or when I'm in a depressive episode, if she hears one single sniffle of a cry, she'll come running to me and do what the dog in this video does.  She's able to tell the difference between when I'm upset and when I'm sick, too, which is amazing."
homolicious,fe7xuw0,t1_fe79hza,"Also, did the handler know she was going to have a panic attack, paused it to set up a camera, then continued? Definitely seems like a demo video. Cutest pup around tho."
howellscastle23,fe8g11n,t1_fe8dsby,"Yeah the video with sound shows exactly what I expected. This is a response task not a detection. Detection would be alerting to the rise in cortisol before these symptoms occur. This dog is just responding to the occurrence, specially hands to face(crying), hands together(usually picking or other self harm behaviors) and distressed noises. Anxiety response tasks can be just as helpful but not the same thing as a scentwork detection task. And really the last thing anyone that’s having a cluster of severe panic attacks in a crowded airport would want to do is set up a camera :/ the whole thing hits many red flags"
Reinmeika,fe8rom2,t1_fe7xuw0,"The purpose of the video aside, if you have panic disorder, you definitely know when one is coming on.  Especially if you’ve done any modicum of CBT, you get used to seeing the signs so you can try to counteract them.   She didn’t necessarily “continue” the attack, she was just going through it and had the wherewithal to record for whatever purpose she had for it.

Panic attacks definitely can be fast and debilitating, but many times there are signs that are common to each person that might not allow them to stop the attack, but gives them time to at least brace for it and take necessary precautions (leaving the area, breathing exercises, focusing on something, medication, etc.)"

maxxell13,fe8qeix,t1_fe8g11n,How is the dog responding to something he noticed with his ears not “detecting” but responding to something he noticed with his nose “detecting”?
Tumble85,feaiy82,t1_fe8rom2,"Yea, they aren't like seizures. I dated a girl that got them occasionally and it was always kind of obvious when they were going to happen. Certain situations would become too stressful and she would get angry a lot quicker than normal, then she would get sad and scared because she felt embarrassed and sad she was acting like that, followed by some paranoia and *anxiety* and presto now it's turned into a panic attack.

It was never like flipping a switch, it was more like a ladder or flow chart if that makes sense."
Karaethon22,fe9ch2x,t1_fe8qeix,"With service animals, they have to be trained to do work or perform tasks to mitigate the handler's disability. In most situations you can pretty much lump all of that under ""tasks,"" but in truth there are legal distinctions that are sometimes critical, so sometimes handlers come off as a bit pedantic about these things. It's not as pedantic as it sounds, because from our position, language can be the difference between normal life and being denied access.

There are three broad categories of tasks. Work, which is something the dog does on command (example: retrieval). Alerts, which is when a dog monitors symptoms and gives the handler warning of an upcoming medical event (example: seizure alert several minutes before the seizure). And response, when the dog takes action to mitigate a medical event that is already taking place (example: grounding through panic attacks). In order for a task to be considered an alert, the dog has to know and communicate something the handler doesn't know. If the handler knows already but needs help, it's a response. Businesses can ask what tasks the dog is trained to perform. If you say your dog is medical alert when they actually do medical response, you have technically failed to answer the question and if the discrepancy is discovered, it can potentially result in the business removing your service animal. It's not likely, and could usually be resolved by correcting the misunderstanding, but it could still potentially create an unnecessary conflict. Also, courts are not very forgiving about vague task descriptions."
howellscastle23,fe95ttj,t1_fe8qeix,"In service dog terms a medical detection is performed through scent, also called medical alert.

To clarify- a medical alert must occur before symptoms present. The idea is the give the handler advanced noticed to a condition like low blood sugar, impending seizure, or impending anxiety attack. Alerting when the event is already occurring, such as what this dog is doing, would be like a seizure alert dog letting them know theyre having a seizure while theyre flopping around on the floor, not very helpful."
Moonsaults,fec2gx0,t1_fe9ch2x,"I've been thinking about a service dog once I eventually get physically worse, and I've had the question in my mind for a while how to answer the question of what the dog does without giving details on the disability. Mobility assistance is a pretty simple answer, but for a panic attack response, what would a person say? ""My dog responds to a medical event""?"
Karaethon22,fec707x,t1_fec2gx0,"Kind of depends what the dog does. You have to describe a trained behavior and don't have to disclose the nature of the disability. So to answer the question, it's always what the dog actually does, not why they do it. Alert tasks are kind of self contained. So if you say medical alert, you've just described the exact task: anticipating and warning of an impending issue, which is why saying alert when the dog actually does response is bad. It's a lie. With response tasks, you have to a bit more descriptive because response is more of an umbrella term. Like, if your dog is trained to respond with pressure therapy, you say pressure therapy. Another common one is if a dog is trained to remove the handler from a stressful area, the handler can say guide work."

It doesn't matter where my dog is, she'll ignore me the whole day. I could fake cry, she wont move. But if I actually cry,she always knows and she will come over and get in my face and ""attack"" (with licks/kisses) and will literally hug me,(lay her head down on me) to make me stop crying. She wasnt taught this, shes not ""around"" this all the time to somehow know what crying is. But She knows...and this is how she reacts. It's always with love.

Its like second nature for animals yet some people would rather ignore the sick and leave them to rot.

I know not every person is like this, and I know not every animal is like that either, It's a mix of beauty to see such love from an animal and sadness to see people among us harbor hate for something they dont understand.

devongarv,feb72ed,t1_fe9jq1m,"It depends on the dog. Most dogs don't have what it takes to be a service dog. You'd have to get an evaluation with a professional trainer, and if they decide that your dog has the right temperament you would either train the dog yourself (not a good idea unless you have advanced training experience) or hire a trainer to help."
Karaethon22,febtv28,t1_fe9jq1m,"It's not dependent on breed, but it does depend on individual temperament.

The most difficult part of service animal training is public access. Not many dogs have the right disposition, and even those who do need a bunch of training in order to make it happen. If you need help in public, it's complicated and not always realistic or even possible.

But if you just need help at home, task training a dog to respond to panic attacks is relatively easy with a basic understanding of dog training. Depending where you live, that may also be enough to give you legal protection within your home (again stressing that public access rights are different). Basically you want to choose a behavior. Cuddling, licking, pawing, doing a funny dance, whatever makes you feel better. Teach the dog to do it on command, probably either voice or hand signal. When the dog is consistently obedient, fake your symptoms whenever you ask for it. Eventually the dog learns to associate the behavior with your symptoms instead of needing a command."

If I'm sad and start to cry or if I have an even sort of tense conversation with my partner then he comes right over and starts pawing and licking just like this dog, but he also shakes uncontrollably and we end up just comforting him.

  


Maybe that's the tactic..."
Farinha9,fea5wro,t3_eo254l,Uh oh it's time for scritches
Manbearpigglaus,feaggvh,t3_eo254l,Can someone explain how they are able to “sense” a panic attack?
Pachuko_pinyata,feaycz5,t1_feaggvh,"When you nervous system sends messages to your body, your heart rate increases and sweat is released. It’s likely a combination of the smell and hearing."
BMagg,febjk62,t1_feaggvh,"This is more of a response task, the dog sees her body language as the cue to do his task of getting her hands away from her face.  She may also have made a noise that the dog is attuned to listening for and then begin tasking/working.

However, there are service dogs who can alert before symptoms of a panic attack begin.  They usually are smelling the changes in the handlers breath when their cortisol levels rise due to stress.  Like Diabetic Alert Dogs are using scent on the handlers breath as well, so samples are taken when blood sugar is too high or too low, and those are used in training.  You can also do the same with high cortisol.

There are some dogs who naturally alert to heart rate, seizures, migraines, or other things we don't know what they are sensing, or cannot replicate it train.  Such as seizure alert dogs, we don't know what they are picking up on, let alone be able to replicate it to train the dog to notice x thing, then train the dog to do y.  So it's considered a natural alert, meaning it cannot be trained, the dog either notices something is going on, or they don't. Once a dog is noticing the thing, and you have tracked to dogs behavior vs having a seizure, so your sure the dog is alerting.  The you train the dog to do a certain behavior as a cue, such as pawing at your leg, staring intently at you, nose bumping, etc.  

Most service dogs are then trained to do a response task.  So say the dog has alerted to a on coming seizure, the dog could then retrieve a bag with medication in it and a bottle of water to try to abort the seizure, go find a friend or family member for help, lead their handler to a safe place to ride it out, etc.  During the seizure they can also do things to help like prop up legs or roll their handler to their side and support them there, stand over their handler so they are more visible, pillow their head, etc.  They can also help bring the person around and then help with the aftermath.  

So often there is a chain of tasks to be done, if it begins with an alert or a response it's still all helpful to the handler."
Manbearpigglaus,feb8uoo,t1_feaycz5,Do they hear the heart rate increase?
ggravendust,feah0s9,t3_eo254l,"I have narcolepsy and I constantly wonder if maybe a service dog would be right for me. I don't know that I have it severe enough to have a dog for it but at the same time, there are a lot of instances where it would have been incredibly helpful, potentially even lifesaving for me. I just can't help but feel like there are people that deserve a good service dog more than me. 

Also my current dog is essentially a disservice dog. She slaps me. </3"

papercardinal,fec27wx,t3_eo254l,Reminds me of my German Shepard. I haven’t trained her personally to respond to my attacks. But the four years she’s grown with me she has experienced many breakdowns. Now before I even cry she can sense my distress. Or when I’m sick she will be extra cuddly with me before I even have physical symptoms. When I’m on my period she is also a lot calmer and less rowdy with me. It’s truly weird. But she will be distraught until I calm down which kicks my butt into gear because I hate to see here distraught over my sadness. She is my angel on earth.

***K-9 Bello Retires***

Today we celebrate one of our longest serving K-9's, Bello.

Bello and Senior Police Officer Cordell Miller, a 17 yr veteran of the department, have been partners for 9 years.  Their contribution to the department has been immense; dozens of pounds of illegal narcotics seized from our streets, many dangerous offenders tracked and captured, the location of several lost children, elderly, and disabled persons, and scores of K-9 demonstrations at schools and community events.

With over 20 service awards, picking just one to share with our community today was a challenge. This arrest from 2018 is one of many that secure Bello's legacy.

On a rainy day in Sept 2018, SPO Miller and Bello responded to the south side of Des Moines to assist Patrol officers who were attempting to apprehend three armed suspects who had just committed a home invasion robbery.  

SPO Miller and Bello spot one of the suspects.  He refuses commands to surrender, and makes the regrettable decision to ignore the warning that Bello will be deployed if he doesn't surrender.

As the suspect ran, clutching his hands in front of him, Bello gave chase.  Bello caught the suspect as he went over a fence. With the suspect on one side, and Bello holding his arm on the other side, the two struggled. The suspect got loose and began to run. Bello hurdled this fence, and two others, before securing the bite that would bring the suspect into custody.   It's not the size of the dog in the fight, it's the size of the fight in the dog...

A loaded handgun was found along the path where Bello engaged the suspect. A wanted felon captured.  A community made safer."

I have to work with the police sometimes and they all do this and it you can smell it from a mile away and they seem to have a hard time talking. I guess I can’t relate so I’m biased.

KanyeWesleySnipes,fe6bxs4,t1_fe6agjo,"That’s what good police officers are supposed to be. Role models. Many of them aren’t, sure. I’m personally very untrusting of law enforcement and I have worked with them in the past. But kids play cops and robbers and police are often in cartoons and TV shows where they are portrayed as heroic so even if they are mislead many children look up to cops for generally positive reasons. It’s not bad for children to look at cops as good people who protect the community and do generally good stuff. These kids aren’t looking up to cops for negative reasons obviously. Thanks for sharing your disdain towards law enforcement though it added absolutely nothing to the conversation."

SammyboySauce,fdsgblf,t1_fdsc8ql,"Well it depends on the bird they're hunting. For pheasants, the dog will smell and track the bird to a general location. They will then take a rigid pose called pointing. The hunter then knows of the bird and readies for when it flushes. After the shot, the dog retrieves the bird. 

Watching trained bird dogs is AMAZING, they really love what they're doing and its spectacular how much ground they cover searching for birds

Source: My uncle breeds and hunts with some incredible German Shorthaired Pointers. We also have a brittany [puppy](http://imgur.com/gallery/6WA3Ytb) for hunting"
daveh6475,fdsd9s0,t1_fdsc8ql,"Without googling, I'm pretty sure they accompany someone who shoots down something like a pheasant. Once it's in the bushes, the dog goes and sniffs it out then brings it back to the owner without damaging it."
digdilem,fdugke7,t1_fdsc8ql,"Imagine anywhere from 1 to 30 men standing in a line shooting at birds flying overhead (flushed by other men beating the ground in a line towards them - the term 'beaters'). 

The birds drop everywhere. A good gun dog (generally Springers or Retrievers) will go and fetch the birds and bring them back to the gun. They need 'soft mouths' so they don't damage the bird, which will generally be cooked and eaten."

TheQueenOfFilth,fdukzcg,t1_fdsgblf,"All of our Springers were family pets but the flushing instinct was so strong in all of four of them. I imagine they would love to ""work"" in that capacity. 

Our current boy we're training to just search for his favourite toy because he likes that and finds it really rewarding."
ThatLowtideAroma,fdu52nt,t1_fdsd9s0,"Beyond that, they’ll sniff out birds that are hiding in brush and make them jump out to give you a shot, as well as retrieve. Many have to be trained to this effectively, but they’re bred for it and will sniff out/hunt instinctively"
hashsmasher,fdrn7pt,t1_fdrmcxn,"Yeah that was one of the crazier escalations I’ve seen on here lately.

Stunning-Bad,fdrqo5l,t1_fdrn7pt,"I was going to say... if they’re using that argument, then you could say the same thing about how we’ve been selectively breeding crops for thousands of years in order to get the desired nutritional results we have now, and how that’s led to an increase in nutritional value of the foods we have that have proven to help in drought-like conditions and other scenarios. We owe our existence to people who helped in that sense. 

Anyhow, beautiful dog. My dad raised Brittany spaniels for over two decades and I’ve always had one growing up to go hunting with."
mdog95,fdrwvcu,t1_fdrn7pt,"Some people are just extremely against breeding animals due to mostly misinformation and the overpopulation problem in animal shelters.  God forbid somebody wants a dog that is a certain size, has certain instincts and temperament, and other various traits."

You may not think he's much of a killer but it's 100% in his DNA."
digdilem,fdug7px,t1_fdsm6tp,"Yes, the instinct in Springers is amazing. Have you tried lure training? Basically soft bean bags - throw them off to the side as you walk and teach him to ""mark"" them, then after 3 or 4, tell him to go fetch each.

blujeans4eva,fdr6iht,t3_emulln,How do you like being a puppy raiser? I am thinking about doing this too
rkkx,fdrgqt2,t1_fdr6iht,"It is really a great experience! You start raising them when they are puppies and its honestly surprising how much they can do and how much they can help another person. Of course there are very frustrating/challenging times and it is a lot of responsibility so if you have the time and financially-able, you should definitely do it! 


Adding this one bit here because Pita unexpectedly developed a very sensitive stomach around 5 months. I had to boil chicken for her every morning since regular dog treats didn't sit well with her and she had to take prescription dog kibble which made it more costly.. it was so bad she trained me to wake up in the middle of the night to the sounds of her panting  to get busy outside 😅. Not all dogs are like this and I am in no means trying to deter you from becoming a puppy raiser! It is not all sunshine and rainbows and can be exhausting at times but its honestly such a great experience and I recommend anyone who can put the effort into it to go for it! 💕"
matts2,fdu3drw,t1_fdr6iht,Best thing I have done in my life. It is a joy that fills you with pride and purpose.
ebeagle,fdrugjj,t3_emulln,"I think it's awesome when people and dogs want to share goofy smiles

stretch those wrists!"

rkkx,fdswhma,t1_fdsw1pz,Thank you! I think being derpy was actually better than having a successful 'puppy eyes' look. That would have made raising her so much more difficult 😅
ixml,fdswm9v,t1_fdswhma,Oh I totally understand! My doggo has mastered the puppy dog eyes and it makes it sooooo hard to tell him no!

DaisyLyman,fdscaw2,t3_emulln,"You're beautiful, Pita! You are a very good girl and you and your raiser were very lucky to have each other. Good luck back at school :-)

And to Pita's raiser, thank you for the work you did with Pita and any other dogs you've cared for! Guiding Eyes is a wonderful organization. In fact, I have family members who have worked with them for years as weekend raisers (not sure of the proper term) and their family dog is a Guiding Eyes mama dog who just had her last litter this past year (Hey, she could be Pita's mom!)"
rkkx,fdse8ph,t1_fdscaw2,"The GEB community is honestly the best and so very helpful! And as for your puppy sitting family members, they are the real unsung heroes! There have been so many times where sitters have been extremely helpful to training Pita whether it be an emergency trip Pita couldn't accompany me to or just getting to experience new places, cats, children, etc.! Make sure you spoil that momma dog too 😜 she deserves it after all the work she has done 🤗"
thatchyfern,fdt39hw,t3_emulln,"My mom has had three dogs from Guiding Eyes for the Blind, and they are some of the best and most well-trained dogs I've ever met! Thank you so much for being a puppy raiser, and I wish adorable Pita all the best"
rkkx,fdtdz6x,t1_fdt39hw,Guiding Eyes have awesome trainers! It's amazing what they can do.. i just hope Pita will be able to take the pressures of puppy college and graduate and be a helpful pup like your mother's (previous/current) dogs!
jasonbourne101,fdtlqbn,t3_emulln,I'm so glad you got to do this! My family raised 3 dogs for the guiding eyes for the blind program. The toughest part though is sending them off to puppy college. Keep up the good work! ^__^

ParkieDude,febp2jf,t3_eoch4g,"My Golden Retriever did a trick on me, of stopping me from going on a walk.

For the life of me I couldn't figure out what she was telling me, but it was clear she was trying to communicate ""not a good day to go walking"". We had made it a few houses down, perfect day, and I really just wanted to go for a walk. Nope.

So I told her she was being stubb0rn and told her let's go!  I made it another 100', fell flat on my face. I swear I looked up and her expression was ""when will you listen to me?""

She will remind me when it is time to take my medication. I had DBS a few years ago, but I still need my Parkinson's meds.

[Dog Tax](https://i.imgur.com/JnNEAFj.jpg) with two of my dogs, TEDS post op."
MissVictoriaE,febsb5z,t1_febp2jf,"That’s such a fascinating story! It’s truly amazing how dogs can pick up things before they happen. You’re lucky to have them. ❤️

How long have you been diagnosed with Parkinson’s? And how long into your diagnosis did you get DBS? I just move my mother in with me at the end of November so that I can help take care of her and there’s so many things that I’m learning as I go along. It really is quite a daily roller coaster struggle."
BeautifulRelief,fec1x0n,t3_eoch4g,"Dogs are so great. Almost five years ago I adopted a hound dog from my local shelter. As far as I know, she’s had no training. At the time, I was having seizures and I always knew when they were coming. One day, I felt one coming on and about 30 seconds later, my hound started pawing at me and whining. I laid down and just waited. She laid her head on my chest and continued to whine. When I came to, she was licking my face and did not stop until I sat up and told her I was okay. Since then, I’ve stopped taking seizures but she would always act the same way every time I had one."
bgharambee,febp4rj,t3_eoch4g,"My pitties are the most intuitive dogs that I have ever had. They aren't the most intelligent but they love unconditionally and do anything to help. I have arthritis in my knees so my on female pittie curls around them to keep them warm. They read my emotions so well, and try to comfort me too. They are amazing!"
MissVictoriaE,febszbk,t1_febp4rj,"I’ve had meatball for almost 2 years now and he never ceases to amaze me on his unconditional love. On the few occasions that I have been sick or have been suffering from a terrible headache he hasn’t left my side and almost wants to lie on top of me. There was one day where I was so sick that I couldn’t even lift my head off the pillow, I wasn’t able to take him outside to go to the bathroom and he actually held it for over 12 hours. Once I had the strength to take him for a quick walk he did everything within two minutes and then turned around and drag me back inside. He knew that it was more important for me to rest rather than him responding to pee-mail and sniffy time. 

I also have this feeling that because he spent two years in a shelter that he’s also incredibly grateful to have a loving home with all the beautiful blankets to sleep on all day. His gratitude comes in the form of unconditional love. And it’s so beautiful that my mother gets to share that love as well."
bgharambee,fec0nn6,t1_febszbk,That's so wonderful. I'm so thankful that you were able to save his life. More positive stories like this need to be in the media instead of the negative ones. They are a sweet and loving breed if given the opportunity.
Velmaartvibes,febt8ch,t3_eoch4g,What a good doggo. He looks so concerned for her.
MissVictoriaE,febua04,t1_febt8ch,"He has what we refer to as “resting pit face” - it’s the face he makes 90% of time time. But yes, I could see a sparkle of concern in his eyes. Also “Not sure wtf is going on or if I’m helping, but I’m just gonna do this unless you tell me otherwise.” 
He’s a good boy."
