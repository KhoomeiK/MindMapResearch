MorelloWorkaholic,fdw0sib,t3_en3mit,"Hey, don't underestimate the power a hug can have in you.

I find that being embraced makes me feel safe, cared for and like im worth something to someone.
The thing is, eventually you'll learn to fill yourself with that energy, that confidence that a hug can give you, but only when you realize that that very same hug comes from the love or care that said person has for you.
I feel like I spent way too long not recognizing my peers and family's affection as love; something in my head just didn't make that translation for me. Empathy can be a huge tool to keep at hand; it'll help you not waste the loving of others and learn to take the best out of it.

I'd like to believe that my days of thinking about suicide have been put on hold for a while, or at least I hope so. All of these ideas are currently helping me out.

I was recorded the one time I wasn't putting on a front, pretending I had my shit together head held up high. Maybe it's his fucked up way of trying to motivate me to sort my shit out but it just makes me wish I could stop existing. I fucking hate myself more.

PhilkIced,fdjxrb3,t1_fdib617,"I think a lot of mental issues frequently comes from parents forgeting their children is a self concious human being and not their personal property, most of my issues also came from my father who never accepted anything but perfection from me since I was a little baby, I'm ""his son"", and ""his son must be X and Y and can't do Z"", eventually as I grew up and got independent and became distant he changed his mind and decided that love and family was more important than his ego, so he changed for me and we are close now.

Your parents may or may not learn and change once they realize they ""lost"" you, but either way the best thing you can do is be patient and aim for total indepence, then you can just cut out who isn't good for you and keep contact with those who are, TreeOfKnowledge is spot on."

Quibbling about word choice when someone's in crisis and making it about you is either solipsistic or stupid or both."
jane-doe70,fdimenx,t3_elj38e,"Dude  your dad is an utter asshole. Seriously - who does that to anyone never mind someone they love? Tough love people are the fucking worst.

No one looks good walking with their hands in their pockets, it changes your posture. Most people look deadfaced most of the time too, honestly, slyly watch a few people walking down a street and you'll see them in their own worlds or on their phones looking like a zombie.

If you're in a rut and already feeling very down it's perfectly understandable to see why this has made you feel so bad about yourself.

Re the autism thing - this is something that really should have been addressed properly years ago and it honestly might be very enabling for you to get a real diagnosis, it might explain what's been happening to you in work, think about it at least. Being diagnosed change my life for the better in so many ways.

You're good how you are. The fashionableness of goth/punk/grunge/rap/emo wanes and waxes. Not saying you're a fashionista... just it's cool to be a mess because it's authentic, unconcerned with what close-minded people think. The popularity of these scenes  express how shitty adolescence is, especially when old people are too arrogant to understand differences.  

You're not alone.  And you're right. People are really good at faking it because when they crack people jump on them like hyenas. The worst thing about psychological pain is how everyone hates you for not being candy and sunshine."

I've. Given up having heart to hearts with him because he doesn't listen when he pushed me to tell him what my problem is.  The more distant I've been (and putting effort into being non-confrontayional) the better I feel about myself but the worse the relationship gets because I'm 'ignoring' him. At this point it's clear he's given up and is trying to get me to move out the house with Internet cut off, door taken out of my room. Cutting off power to the breaker for my room. I've tried communicating I've really tried.  I know I'm 23 but I have a job, I don't hermit in the house and I've tried helping myself before, it just feels its being sabotaged at this point.

I don't care what age he is - this isn't about generation, this is about basic empathy and decency; you are his son and you deserve some level of respect, courtesy, and kindness. You have clearly been disrespected from an early age and this has poisoned your mental health. He has attacked your personal space, now he is attacking your headspace. Get out of there, he's toxic, god knows what his next move is.

Not investigating whether or not you had autism after being told you might is a form of neglect too. Not telling you until you're in your twenties and out of school when you would have needed and received extra help is disgusting. This might be why college was so hard for you.

I also 2nd the person who advised you to reach for financial independence. Its hard and it might take a while but hopefully that should help you to get away from them. When you do get away if that toxic language continues cut them out of your life. Mute them is what I mean.

VisforVenom,fdyovbt,t3_enakk8,"I've found a sense of personal responsibility for my suicide to be a fair motivational tool to get things done. I'm going to kill myself, barring a happy accident that provides a surprise early out. But I put upon myself the requirement of doing it in a way that causes at little inconvenience as possible. Hopefully not even any remains to be dealt with by an unfortunate stranger. No messes left behind, no loose ends.

That's a lot of work.

I also would like to be satisfied with the amount of effort I put in to finishing any ""creative projects"" or any kind of ""legacy"". Ideally I want to do everything I can to milk all the value out of my remaining days possible. If my death can benefit others that would be awesome.

Point being from a selfish perspective I want to just pick up the pistol that's rarely more than 15 feet from me and be done. I'm tired and have so much to do. It's soooo inviting to just rage quit and let someone else figure out what to do with all this shit. But that would be kind of a dick move.

If something's worth doing, it's worth doing right. So if I want to get to my only real goal- ceasing to live- I gotta earn it by doing all the shit I gotta do first.

Not saying it's for everyone, or even anyone, but it works to keep me stocked with at least a minimum amount of motivation to do shit that seems trivial when you're not planning on being around much longer. And the times when the desire gets overwhelming it's almost comforting to be able to say ""soon, soon, we're almost there."""

I mean I am the one to talk as a wreck with daily suicidal thoughts, I feel a bit hyhypocriticalBut as long as you are knowing that these thoughts are not good and you want them to stop you are on the right track, giving in is the worst you can do. Today I had to give in to the urge to bang my head against a wall, and despite my head longing for it to happen it felt really shitty and I felt really shitty afterwards.

Then I read/listen to it back and it feels like it gets rid of a lot of the drive to actually take my life. 


I‚Äôve struggled with heavy and persistent suicidal thoughts since I was about 10. A number of years ago, I went through enough trauma to attempt a number of times which resulted in a permanent scar on the side of my eyebrow and a lot of guilt at not following it through. I‚Äôve grown and come a long way since then, but still, sometimes life gets so difficult and painful that the thoughts creep up again and I understand what you‚Äôre saying. You begin feeling like you are at war with your mind, trying to find a reason not to and nothing seems convincing; I get it. 


But the reality is; just because you don‚Äôt see a light at the end of the tunnel doesn‚Äôt mean there isn‚Äôt one. You just can‚Äôt see it now. Telling people about suicidal thoughts.. it has never done anything beneficial for me. If anything, it pushes people away. So writing out my suicide note or memo is how I get rid of it. I‚Äôm not sure why it‚Äôs so therapeutic but it works for me."
HawkingOptics,fdms1n7,t3_elu4me,"I have similar thoughts and problems. Everyone expects so much and always for me to listen to them but I feel no one cares about me. If you try to talk about your feelings it‚Äôs pretty much game over as I always felt. Thus I bottle it up and am always dealing with the loneliness and underlining sadness while I keep others around me in high spirits.

The truth is, all we probably really require is time to time someone just saying...‚ÄùHey, you‚Äôre good enough, just the way you are.‚Äù 

So with that said I‚Äôm not going to tell you to go see someone or get out more because well there‚Äôs a reason you‚Äôre putting this post here because that‚Äôs not an option and you want someone perhaps me to tell you what I said above.

I say this to you genuinely because I need it myself and I understand how extremely difficult life can be and as you feel you‚Äôre on the edge of a burning building. 

From me to you: 

You‚Äôre good enough as you are. Life expects nothing more than that, you deserve the happiness and smile for yourself. You owe no one anything, be yourself and that‚Äôs enough.

Cheers"
xXJHH1217Xx,fdkyjwq,t3_elu4me,"I‚Äôm in the same place. I just smile and pretend like everything is fine, but on the inside I‚Äôm completely broken.

My parents know I have depression, and I‚Äôm medication. However, once something in my life happens that is negative, my initial thoughts are, ‚ÄúMy life is worthless‚Äù, ‚ÄúNobody would care if I was alive or dead‚Äù.

I couldn‚Äôt take all the negative thoughts, so I called the suicide hotline. I talked to them, and it made me feel somewhat better.

However, I don‚Äôt like the sound of my voice. So I texted the suicide hotline next.

You might be going through a similar situation as me.

I have to avoid anything exciting (like music), so I sleep 15 hours a day if I can and browse sad subreddits the rest of the time. Can't focus on TV or books, feel restless because of the pills (a side effect that is more common than my weird music insomnia thing). I can't live like this."

I often find myself in the same situation and it's for the latter reason. I actually really enjoy getting out into nature where I don't have to see people. Cycling is also good for that, as you can just slip around quickly and quietly without much fuss. If you live anywhere near a natural area, maybe try a bike ride out to the country with a picnic and a book, or even a camping trip... or even see if there are permaculture farms or nature reserves that could use a little voluntary help? There are also sites like WWOOF and workaway for rural volunteering jobs.

throwawayjf777,fdraz8w,t3_emq92j,"I am sorry about your situation. No one deserves to have their passion taken away from them, even if pursuing it may get in the way of fully prioritizing health.

My apologies if I sound ignorant as I don't know your exact situation, but have you tried making music at different times of the day, e.g. morning rather than night? What about insomnia remedies (either natural or medication)? Starting off small with the amount of time you spend on music (even just 10 minutes a day) and gradually building up over time? Asking about different types of medication? Perhaps there are ways to improve the insomnia side effect so you can still continue to do what you love."
impeccablemix,fdreiyg,t1_fdraz8w,"Those are good suggestions. Making music in the morning and for a short time seems logical, I haven't tried it yet because I'm scared. What if it doesn't work and I don't sleep well that night? It means the next day is going to be ruined. These days I abstain from music altogether just to be sure. It seems like it's not only music that messes with my sleep, for example I couldn't sleep last night for no reason. 

I'm taking a schizo med that is also a sleeping pill, but it doesn't work. It's a strong one according to the shrink. She laughed at us when we asked about natural remedies, she said with my condition I need something powerful. She can increase the dose of the strong pill. I read that it has terrifying side effects and requires a weekly blood test (something my shrink didn't tell us). Sounds dangerous, I'd rather take another pill, but she won't prescribe it. She didn't even prescribe the strong pill in the first place, it was done by another doctor at the hospital in another city, she just went with it."
throwawayjf777,fdsfevd,t1_fdreiyg,"I don't want to give you medical advice as I'm not qualified, but making music for a short time in the morning seems like a good place to start. If you're already having trouble sleeping even without the music it doesn't seem like you have a lot to lose, and you could always stop if it makes your sleep problems worse. Again, I'm not a doctor, so maybe you could mention it to your psychiatrist to see what she thinks of the idea?

By natural remedies I was referring to the insomnia and not the schizophrenia. Things like yoga, meditation, or reading a book before bed can be really helpful, and you don't need to consult your doctor to try those. I've frequently dealt with insomnia as a depression side effect, and the biggest help I've found is putting away all technology when it's close to bedtime. The bright lights will keep your brain awake."
impeccablemix,fduxrn5,t1_fdsfevd,">maybe you could mention it to your psychiatrist to see what she thinks of the idea?

Please note that woebot is not there for S.O.S. suicidal hotline, in such cases please contact a suicide hotline.

bythe_moon_and_stars,feaykqx,t3_eo9o49,"Hi OP. Please stay. I understand that right now things are very tumultuous for you, but know that one random stranger on the internet cares for you. I know it may not mean much, but please, stay. The community wants to see your art. Your kitten is giving you a tangible hug because he wants you to stay. I know right now your mind is clouded, but please, let dawn and clear skies grace your mind again. I love you."
TLetto1713,fec9fr9,t1_feaykqx,"Plus me! That makes 2 random internet strangers that care!

I want to see your art! I want to see your dolls! I want to see pics of funny things your kitten does!  I'll tell you how my dog kept me alive and share pics of her with you. Please don't go! 

Please don't go."
Blackbear8336,feclupn,t1_feaykqx,Make that 6 random internet strangers! I know it sounds cliche but you are so young and have the rest of your life ahead of you. Who knows what the future holds for someone as talented and skilled as you are! I'm 20 myself and can't even do 1/4 of the things that you can do!!!
journeyman369,fecv8xh,t1_feaykqx,"Two random strangers care for OP. More than two. Maybe three, four, and many more.

mangosparklingwater,fecabs8,t1_fec9fr9,"3! I will give you my email, my number, anything. Please talk to me. Im training to be a 911 operator so I‚Äôm trained in this stuff. We care about you. I wouldn‚Äôt work in this if I didn‚Äôt love you."

Boobytrapster,fecs8w1,t1_feclupn,"Well now you can crank it up to 7 internet strangers haha! Look, you are young yet you are so incredibly skilled, sewing, drawing, AND singing at the age of 13? Well that's incredible ! You're a prodigious young artist !! All I was doing at 13 was play videogames. All I want to say is... please stay, please, we all care for you here, we all love you. :)"

I honestly started sobbing when I saw all the replies, messages, chat requests and the award. I read each and every one of the replies and messages and thought about each one. I thank each and every one of you from the bottom of my heart. I truly, truly do. I would chat with the ones who wanted to, but I wouldn‚Äôt know who to chose and I already have someone I‚Äôm chatting with. I will try to reply to the messages and some of the replies, but it‚Äôll take a while so I wanted to make a  big reply so you know I‚Äôm ok.




I told my dad about how I am feeling. I feel a bit better now, but I would probably would‚Äôve been gone if it weren‚Äôt for you guys. You‚Äôve given me hope, enough to make me rethink my decision and live another day. I can‚Äôt say this won‚Äôt happen again, but for the time being I think I‚Äôm going to be ok. Thank you so much. I love you all.  Thank you"
gitcomfy,fec9flp,t1_fec6j49,"I am SO glad you talked to your dad! You're at one of the hardest phases of life, and young adulthood is similar. However, you have a family, you have a passion (dolls and art), and you are open to changing your mind. That's great!"
TheWolfbaneBlooms,fecbwbg,t1_fec6j49,"Thank you for staying with us, sweet angel. I saw your dollies in your profile and they‚Äôre wonderful. So are your drawings! I‚Äôm a writer, but have absolutely zero talent when it comes to visual arts, so I‚Äôm jealous of how good you are!

It never hurts to get help and it doesn‚Äôt mean you need to be institutionalized. Ask for a therapist you can visit. Get medicine. Work on yourself. Keep being creative. The world needs your voice. 

Think about all the other young kids like you out there. You could be a voice for them. So few parents know what‚Äôs going on with their kids. Speak out and let the world know that young people are hurting too!

Be safe, dear."

Blaze_Falcon,feazrdt,t3_eo9o49,I looked at you profile a bit and saw some beautiful stuff. You're only thirteen and already you have a knack for art. And you give so much love to your dolls it's adorable. I understand your fears all too well but I think you should consider professional help. Maybe talking to one of your parents and try to get them to understand your fears for mental hospitals. Please don't give up like this. Not before giving it one more go.
savajam,feae6av,t3_eo9o49,Hey! Maybe if you disclose what country you're in we can help you find resources that doesn't include being hospitalized. It's completely understandable if you're not willing to share that information though
savajam,feaeca6,t1_feae6av,"Ive been hospitalized before (although it was short-term) so I get how it can feel isolating & unhelpful. 

In the meantime, maybe we can talk? What's making you feel this way?"
readsandsurfs,febp657,t1_feaeca6,Or maybe try a different hospital or facility. I was hospitalized after a failed suicide attempt and happened to land in a very good place that I will most certainly return to if I need it. It was like balm. Not all facilities are alike. One must not give up hope. Trust me
Dawn_Flame900,feazrgj,t3_eo9o49,"I would be crying right now but I have people around me. I have felt the same before too. Just instantces where I thought, should I? Then, I remembered everyone else who cares about me. Think about who cares about you, even you don't think they do. Please, don't. There are other people, other humans, who will be devastated. Just think for a moment. If there is any human that you trust with your life, then confide in them, but if you are really scared of getting outside help, tell you the person you trust most not to get you outside help. Make them swear. Hope this helped, even a little, even if it just made you feel a little better.

Alternate_User_,feb0x4s,t3_eo9o49,Trust me when I say this: I KNOW how it feels. I‚Äôve been feeling like shit for about eight years but I just gotta have confidence in that it will eventually stop. I‚Äôve told no one I know how I feel so I‚Äôm all alone in my struggles. For me at least school is the largest factor to my sadness and hopelessness. The thing I do to get by is to hold on to the interests I have. I don‚Äôt really have any close friends so I usually am alone doing things I‚Äôm interested in. If school is something that‚Äôs contributing to you feeling this way I‚Äôd rather have you take a break from school than doing something undoable. Also I believe if you don‚Äôt want to go to the hospital you could try these online anonymous chat lines just to get things of your chest and perhaps get some good advice in return. I also saw some posts about the dolls you‚Äôve made and I can tell you that they look AWESOME! I‚Äôd gladly buy one! (I don‚Äôt really have money atm tho but trust me on this I would if I could). They look so cute and you must be really good at what you‚Äôre doing. I also guess you have an interest in anime/manga and I can tell you that‚Äôs one of my largest interest ever so feel free to chat to me about it. Please I want to hear back from you.
nofaprecommender,feb1gh3,t3_eo9o49,"You seem like a really nice person, you have practiced your art enough to develop a great talent, and you are still so young that you might not even really understand where your depression comes from. It‚Äôs not because you‚Äôre a bad, incompetent, or unloved person, it‚Äôs most likely because of your experiences/environment‚Äîthings that can change or be healed from. A lot of people would miss you, not just people you know in real life but also many people on Reddit who only got to know a little bit about you. It really sucks to feel the way that you do today, I understand. Life is hard, but you see how many people want to support you, we all have to be here for each other. I am happy that you have tried so hard and are still trying and I really hope you make it. ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è

PS: I wish that when I was 13 I had enough skill and discipline to make such cute dolls and then set up a shop to sell them. I mean I am a man and I probably would not have been into making anime dolls when I was 13, but whatever I was into, I definitely did not have the perseverance to take it to the level that you have taken your passions to. Maybe I will buy one for my daughter!"
suicidemyend,feazkc6,t3_eo9o49,Take this as a sign. Don‚Äôt do it. You‚Äôll regret it the minute u try. Don‚Äôt do it. Trust me.
kl0pote,feb13uk,t3_eo9o49,"Hey. Please don't do anything in that state of mind! When we are like that we cannot evaluate, judge,weigh, calculate and value anything right! 
I have tried to look up your Reddit profile and saw some of your posts in other subreddits.. I can see you're really going through some very hard times.. and I am really sorry.

I would rather say that in this life, we cannot escape what we fear.. we can only delay it's happening. 
So my best advice is to just face your fears right away! 
Things cannot go worse than this.. you have to believe that! Believe that you need to get better, so please accept any help you're receiving!!

You are lucky to can go to a hospital or any other cure house.. it doesn't matter what it is, as long as you are trying to get help. 

You are the master of yourself! So no any place will ever be really able to put you down or to change your core.. if you keep to be true to yourself.

Accept change also! Change is natural. These are times of changing more than ever! We all are going through this process. Don't give up! 

We are evolving I think. I feel. So, no matter how weird, this is somehow natural! 
Don't give up the fight, because you are needed into this big change! Work with it as much as you can, do not give up..!!

Life will also reward you! You have the control... The rest will do the universe. Work and collaborate with it. 

I'm also struggling with different stuff... Its not easy, but we can all help each other. 

Big hug from Romania, Europe."
TheRealBarnowl,feb4223,t3_eo9o49,"I was 13 too, at the time I tried to kill myself. It ended up failing and no one noticed. But I'm glad I survived. I got help and now I'm in a hospital, where people know how to care. You can talk to me if you want, I'm here. You are so talented, your dolls are lovely! People care, but they can't read minds sadly."
thecloudynightone,feb5tt1,t3_eo9o49,"Please don't do it. It would break my heart for someone as obviously caring and loving as you to commit suicide. If someone with a soul like yours can't make it, what hope is there for someone like me?"
DrMyrm,feb7fhx,t3_eo9o49,"I've looked on your profile a bit, you make really cute dolls and I bet you still want to improve and make them cuter and cuter, also, I saw that you posted a bunch of times trying to help people on r/depression-help telling them that they are not alone and that they are worth it, I saw from the painting that you posted on r/art that you don't really appreciate yourself and feel like you're not alone, either that or someone is constantly putting you down, keep in mind that in time you will learn to fix these feelings and don't forget that you will feel very satisfied when you see this point in your life and compare it to the progress you will have made in all these art skills that you have, don't give up just yet and keep in mind that you are not alone either, you not only have your kitten but I am willing to bet that anyone on this comment section is ready to help however they can to keep you going. If you make custom dolls on your Etsy shop I will order one too."

ApeBog,febsblo,t3_eo9o49,"Your RWBY dolls still need you to help fight back against Salem and the Grimm! Don't go! Being 13 years old is tough (at least it was for me). All your thoughts, feelings, emotions-they are all valid. No one has the authority to tell you how you should feel or think. I haven't called a hotline for the same reason as you. Its scary. And you are right, mental hospitals are awful. Opening up about our feelings is hard to do nowadays with how society is. But I promise you aren't alone. You sharing this post with this community of people is extremely brave. I haven't gone through what you have. Nobody else in the world has. That doesn't mean we don't care. Even if the only people you can talk to are a bunch of random usernames on this website, remember that each one is another real person. Try imagining a face for every person that has replied to you. That is how many faces care about you and what you are going through. We don't know what you've had to deal with, but we care about you anyways. If you want, I would totally chat about RWBY with you. Also, I have four cats; Ernie, Coal, Kali, Leo, and they say hi to Binxy!

xyzthun3rblade,feafltq,t3_eo9o49,"Alright listen, you‚Äôre 13 years old, you have a whole life ahead of you. I‚Äôm not gonna pretend like I have any idea what you‚Äôre going through, I‚Äôm also not going to give up on you. You have a life, you think no one cares about that life? Idk you, idk anything about you, but you‚Äôre a human being, and you‚Äôre worth more than you‚Äôre aware.

You think no one will miss you, but if u end it all, I promise on everything that I WILL miss you. You‚Äôre young, with pressures on you, you‚Äôre young, and feel misunderstood, you‚Äôre scared, and that‚Äôs ok, it‚Äôs ok to be scared, but it is NEVER ok to kill yourself.

You‚Äôre life doesn‚Äôt belong to you, it belongs to those who care about you, so I can tell you that every person who has seen this post so far has your life on their shoulders. Do not take it from us, we cherish it more than you know, and I‚Äôm not just saying this either, from the bottom of my heart, I mean this. You‚Äôre life, you‚Äôre whole life, isn‚Äôt something I want taken, isn‚Äôt something you want taken, you just want to be free of the pain, so live long enough to see it disappear, you don‚Äôt even know if it ends when you die.

I think that everybody in this subreddit would dog-pile you with hugs, just so you could have the experience of knowing that we care.  We want you to be pain free, and we want to wipe away your fears.  We want you to be able to stand on your feet and face the world with unflinching confidence, assured that, even if you stumble, we‚Äôve got you.

Please, see what everybody here is writing to you.  We all are dealing with pains and fears.  It‚Äôs not a contest, there are no comparisons; everybody travels their own path.  But, together, we can help each other navigate the insurmountable parts; we can advise, we can encourage, we can commiserate.  And, yes, when I say, ‚Äúwe,‚Äù I include you.  You have experience, and your voice could save someone‚Äôs life.

Please, take a breath.   Then take another.  Hug your cat and feel his purr.  Let your dolls know that you will add to their numbers.  And, lift your voice ‚Äî sing, share what‚Äôs in your heart.  Do it for you.  If only 1 person in a thousand likes your songs, that‚Äôs still 8 million people in this world who would be your fans.

I would like the opportunity to get to know you better, and I think others here would, too.  And, maybe, together, we can all find the best path to overcoming the darkness.

I hope to see another post from you after midnight."

6 years ago this March 5th I was at the same crossroads as you. My girlfriend of 19 months had just broken up with me over a stupid argument at school, I hated school, hated my life, hated how I looked, hated how I was misunderstood. The kicker? My age: 10 years old in the 5th grade.

I still VIVIDLY remember that day. Around the same time as right now (7:30 P.M.) I was crying my eyes out in my room, eyeing the cabinet underneath the sink. I was gonna drink chemicals, I didn‚Äôt but was incredibly close. I was 2 months into a depression and it would be 7.5 months until I felt truly better.

Maybe it's even your cat. Find a reason to live. Even if it the smallest reason. I have never witnessed true sorrow and pain until I went to my friends funeral. Sometimes I imagine what it would be like if she were still here with us smiling, going to college, getting married and fulfilling her dreams. I still remember the way she smiled and her amazing unique personality. 

I know what it's like to hurt. I know that feeling of being so alone. I specifically remember looking up to the ceiling, clenching my teeth and wailing. I was hoping God was watching because I didnt want to be alone anymore in my pain. My life is radically different now.

I would love to hear you words, there are plenty of days that I need to sing a song to get me through the day, why can't it be your words?

Believe me, it WILL get better. You WILL make it through this. Please don‚Äôt take your life away. It‚Äôll affect so many people. All in negative ways. They‚Äôll miss you so much, they‚Äôll sob, they‚Äôll scream, they‚Äôll shout, they‚Äôll blame it on themselves, they might even do it as well because the pain of you being gone will hurt so badly. I was suicidal too, I wanted to try killing myself so many times, but I always told myself, ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt; I have so much to live for. My friends, family, my pets, etc.‚Äù You need to stay strong.

Outstanding. Beautiful. Humorous. Artistic. The list goes on and on and on. There‚Äôs not enough good words to describe you. It‚Äôs bringing me to tears that you will do this. You are needed by so many people. I can‚Äôt express this enough. You will regret it so much when you attempt it, you will realize that it was a bad decision. Please don‚Äôt go. I don‚Äôt know how to put this in your head to get you to understand. Don‚Äôt go. Don‚Äôt go. Don't go. The world needs you. God put you on Earth for a reason.

differenceinopinion,fec1437,t3_eo9o49,"Try and when you don't or can't try even harder.

If you can't believe in yourself don't, believe in the me that believes in you. Kamina from Gurren Lagann would say something like this to Simon. He never had any confidence and thought he was worthless without his big bro.

I'm not as sure why, but you don't see your worth and I can't say I'm a stranger to the sentiment.
Probably nothing I say will be new or powerful enough to move you from that edge, and that adds to my own hopeless and powerless. That's something everyone whose on here for you, and you yourself can relate to. You now what it's like to try and help others while feeling like no one can help you even when they are trying to. Sometimes life can be too cruel.

People can be even crueler, but we can be even kinder too. You know this. Some of us have so much love to give. So much love. You do too. You Know this. You apologized to everyone close to you. I thought I was the only one who did stuff like that. I'm 23 and if I slam my car too hard I apologise because it's wrong and I feel bad, maybe it's more for me than my car, but so what. Sometimes I look at my baby pictures and lament that he'd be disappointed with who we became. Sometimes there just so much sadness. You Know this.

Do what you think is best, but realize that you also don't know what's best. None of us do really.
So what do you do with that. For one don't add to your loneliness with excuses. How close are you to your brother talk to him, God i'd need my sister to do that with me. I know how it feels to not want to burden others and how selfish it is to take away from their happiness in the moment, but if you love each other it doesn't matter because you'll be happy together for tomorrow. How would like it if it was someone you loved? I don't ask this for guilt Lord knows I'm still asking myself everything I'm asking you. I know you already feel guilt, but why should you. Don't take yourself away with hatred for yourself in your soul. Life is already too cruel for that.

If you can't live for you at first do it for those that love you most. Kazumi, Nagisa, Sayaka, Yowane, Kyoko, Yang, Nikki, Ren, Tsurono, Mami, Blake, Madoka, Weiss, Ruby, Homura, Emma, Rena, Gumi, Alina, Sakura, Felicia, Yachiyo, Luka, Rin, Iroha, Sana, Kanade, Mitama, Rika dad, mom, bro, Miku, Binxy. When you look or think about them it will be with tears. Now they'll be saying sorry too. I for one am tired of the sadness, smile. Then cry and smile again. For Everytime you cry smile. You don't get to just share your happiness with everyone. They need to see your sadness too it's apart of you isn't it. 

You're more than what you lack. Come on DarkVixen smile again.

Don't forget to come back and show us either! We'll be waiting, thank you."

I don't know your current situation per-se but when I was 13, I was in one of THE darkest places of my whole life, I had attempted several times only once actually getting close to anywhere and have also been hospitalized at least twice I can remember, I usually lied my way out of it as best I could. 

My point is, you're 13, I was in a similar mindset at 13 and I'm about to turn 27 in like, 7 days. Things get better and things get worse, there are always ups and downs but ultimately, life does get better, maybe even if it's just tolerable, it does improve. 

Please, reach out to one of us, we are strangers on the internet WHO CARE and remotely understand, please don't feel alone. I wish you only the best and truly hope you reconsider your decision to end it all.

Saupernova_13,feb6fae,t3_eo9o49,"I may not know you, I have not seen any of your dolls or any of your drawings. But I know you are amazing and can see you have a passion for them. Your parents love you, and so does your cat. Don't listen to the negative feedback of others. Many will try to bring you down. Walt Disney was told by his editor that his drawings were unimaginative and that he lacked ideas. He then became the founder of the largest entertainment company in the world. Very similar stories come from Steve Jobs, Thomas Edison and Elvis Presley.

You must rise and overcome. If not alone the  with the help of others. If you do feel you can't talk to your family or a professional  then I'm here if you need someone to talk to. So are other redditors. There are many people who would be heartbroken if you were gone. You have a bright future ahead."

ForeverAloneRowan,fecg6qc,t3_eo9o49,"When I was your age I too struggled heavily with depression. When you are young you feel trapped and like you can‚Äôt live your life the way you want or as you truly are. But you are only 5 years away from being able to! 5 years seems like so long, but I promise you can push past those years. I am 21 now and I have my own apartment, a job that I love and enjoy, 2 cats, a partner that is my best friend, and I do art a lot as well as photography. When I was 13 I wanted to die and couldn‚Äôt imagine that my life would be filled with so much love and happiness. The pain will fade more as you get older, as we learn, our coping mechanisms improve and we learn to handle the pain better. The same way we learn to handle our anger.. and it‚Äôs not just concealing it, you will actually become stronger and better at fighting your demons as you get older. Right now, this is probably gonna be one of the lowest points if you have depression in the same way I do. 13/14 is such a hard age. But 15, 16, 17, 18... it just gets better and better! Just think, one day you‚Äôre gonna be 20 and you‚Äôre gonna have the 100% freedom to be yourself and do whatever you want! I believe in you. You can do this."

But I couldn‚Äôt help but feel very personal when I saw you say goodbye to your dolls and the characters you said bye too... those are all mostly names from Madoka Magica Magia Record correct? I love that game, I play it a lot. Ren is my favorite character. What‚Äôs your favorite character? Did you pull for the Kimono Mitama event or are you saving up for Madokami?

Anyhow, I thought it would be nice to maybe talk about the things we like first! I would love to be friends with you and chat with you about Madoka. Did you really make a Yachiyo and Iroha doll? Those must be soooo pretty. I would totally buy one. 

In regards to what you feel.... I‚Äôve been there. And I‚Äôm still there sometimes. And I can‚Äôt give you an answer on why you shouldn‚Äôt, I can‚Äôt tell you all these encouraging things about life being perfect, etc. but, I do know there is things in life that make me happy regardless of the suffering... and I know there is things in life too that make you happy like your dolls, and your cat.

JacquesLaurent,fdj6aqi,t3_elbqdq,"If you ever feel so bad to the point where you just want to die, at least try to have some fun. Become a loose cannon. Think of when you were a kid, when you had seemingly unrealistic career goals in mind (actor, singer, etc.), and consider entering one of those professions. You ideas and goals as a kid were likely much more fun because kids are much more care-free and see no limits to their goals. Many dreams are crushed because people doubt these dreams and they are often pushed to the side as those kids grow up. However, just because someone doubts your dream doesn‚Äôt make them correct. If you feel so sad or emotionally hurt that you want to die, why not go for on of your childhood dreams? A phrase I live by is ‚ÄúWhy halt your actions when nobody says you can‚Äôt?‚Äù (and I give credit to a woman who works at Esade University in Barcelona, however I cannot recall her name). This quote means that, if nobody tells you that you can‚Äôt do something, such as living out a childhood dream, then you should go for it. Worst case in scenario, it doesn‚Äôt work out. Then you should try something else. But if you ever feel so bad that you want to die, just explore the idea of becoming a loose cannon. Despite common belief, there is often no limits to what you can accomplish. I truly wish the best for all out there, you are never alone."

What‚Äôs funny is I saw this movie like a week ago and it was a bit unsettling to me because my life had some similarities to the Joker‚Äôs: I grew up extremely poor, and my Mom ended up homeless, so I had to take her in as an adult. The difference was my dad died when I was really young, but he was a schizophrenic and alcoholic, so the memories weren‚Äôt too great.

Anyways, kind of like in the film, I felt on the bottom in society: my teeth were hyper fucked up because my Mom couldn‚Äôt afford to fix them, so I got made fun of for it. The whole experience also definitely messed me up I think compared to if I‚Äôd had a stable home and parents with a decent income, as I often have felt sad either arbitrarily or because of poverty and the past, or super anxious, etc. I don‚Äôt want to kill a talk show host live on air or anything, but I do get how a messed up background and poverty can drive someone insane.

I‚Äôve definitely been there where I thought if I ended it, ‚Äúmaybe now people will get how much this has sucked‚Äù or whatever. Not sure what I‚Äôm trying to say other than I think I get it and I‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôre dealing with that feeling, truly. To say it sucks is a massive understatement I know.

I'm 20 yrs male dropout from college, attempted  4 months ago to join our local police department but failed, never had a girlfriend as I am full of anxiety and depression, I have scoliosis, deviated septum which makes my breathing very difficult and I still don't know what to do with my life. I am in such a state that I almost can't feel 'happiness' anymore as nothing in my life brings me joy. I thought about suicide countless times and I still do it even today. Fear is the only thing that keeps me from killing myself. I just fear the unknown. What will happen after I will die? Will it get better? Will my pain dissappear? Is there a God? Will I go to hell for committing suicide? I know that the pain of living this miserable life will disappear but what if what is coming after death is worse.. I'm not here to stop you.

Most people find that something when they aren't looking because they are taking care of themselves for a change and not looking for someone else to complete them. We love in a society that propagates the thought that we HAVE to find someone to make us whole. You are a whole person already. Find what you love. Learn something new. Roll the dice and let them land and follow your heart. It's not just for people. 

Don't listen to me. Listen to yourself. You are worthy of that. What do YOU want? What do YOU want to do? Go do it! Find YOU! That ""right"" whatever will find you because they are doing the same thing you love.

We have to step back from what we see every day and take another deep breath. Gain a new perspective. Watch an old movie called The Dead Poets Society. It's a metaphorical that sums up this exact topic.

Chances are almost 100% the dude she's chatting up will break her heart.  It's going to happen to you again too.  What we can't do is l give up.

Life is not short; it's the longest thing we do. Think of something she wouldn't let you do for whatever reason. Do it. Find the reason that makes YOU want to live. Go hiking. Hang gliding. Video games. Nobody is there to tell you not to. Take advantage of it. While you're doing what makes YOU happy, you will likely find someone who is more compatible because they will be doing the same things.

You choose exactly how the story goes. I can already tell you now, that the story does not end here my friend. Oh, no. This book has so many untold stories yet. I'm sure you have read books and I'm sure you know that a book is long. The story is long and sometimes very boring. Same is with life. The book takes it's time to tell a story. The same is with life. Everything takes time. Everything. There is nothing saying that at this time in your life you need to have this, done that and tried that. No. Take your time in life. Take your time. Everything will come to you in the end. Steven Spielberg was rejected from film school 3 times but he kept going. Oprah Winfrey was told she wasn't fit for TV but she kept going. Critics told Beyonce that she couldn't sing but she kept going. So keep going. The story doesn't end here."
fawwin,em54sj,top_level,"For me, it‚Äôs specific to parenting.


I feel like the community aspect of my culture has been taken to such an extreme hat I have been deemed nothing more than a poster child. A trophy for my parents to show off to other families like it‚Äôs some kindergarten show and tell.

‚ÄúOh my kid got the presidents award‚Äù or ‚Äúmy kid got a 1600 on SAT and 32 on ACT‚Äù ‚Äúmy kid did 4000 hours of volunteer service and got accepted into Princeton!‚Äù ‚ÄúOh yeah? My kid is getting a bioengineering degree at Harvard!‚Äù

Of course I‚Äôm exaggerating to an extent but you get the point. Such behavior leads to many parents setting high (and I mean high) expectations for their kids such as achieving a near-perfect report card as a high schooler taking college-level classes. To achieve this, parents attack verbally when failing to meet these expectations, or they constantly compare you to your peers and ask ‚Äúwhy can‚Äôt you be like them???‚Äù Which only leads to a resentment towards that peer, or they try to distance you from a social life and divert all the time in the world into studies and books and education and tests and college stuff. Just to name a few.

It‚Äôs been difficult to explain to my American friends this unique situation and I still feel like they don‚Äôt get it. The only advice I‚Äôve ever gotten is to ‚Äújust wait‚Äù to move out and go to college and you can go NC or LC. I‚Äôm doing that rn but God it just gets harder and harder the more I try to put up with this. 


My parents are also completely dismissive of mental health problems like depression or anxiety, as ‚Äúoh your problems are all rooted to that phone of yours and constantly talking to your friends when you could be studying instead‚Äù or ‚Äúyou just need to put in the work to succeed and then you‚Äôll be happy‚Äù and it‚Äôs like yeah that sounds great but I want to get a therapist. 


It feels like abuse but not to the extent that it is reportable. I don‚Äôt feel good about myself and I don‚Äôt think a parent-child relationship should be like this. I get respecting your elders but not to the detriment of my own needs. I get that my parents house and feed me and stuff but this should be a two-way street and I‚Äôve been trying for years and years to please my parents but to no avail. Rather, it feels hopeless and like I‚Äôm walking on eggshells. My grades are slipping and I don‚Äôt know what to do."
Unifeesh,fdmuye6,t3_em54sj,"Oh god, I identify with this so much! I'm Indian, and my parents always used to just brag and boast with others. I eventually just got extremely stressed out with all the work they piled up on me (extra-curricular activities, sports, and competitions I didn't want to do but still *had to be good at*). Eventually I just went to my parents. I understand they might not understand, but if you bring across the point that this is literally *driving you to depression* then I think you can have some real heart-to-heart with them."
fawwin,fdn368k,t1_fdmuye6,"I tried to an extent. Both of my parents are highly educated in math and science and work in those fields. I‚Äôve come up to them before with hypothetical questions dancing in the realm of mental health and the ethics around certain parenting styles. I‚Äôve concluded that they are just too empirical and I think to myself: ‚Äúif my mom does not understand why people are driven to suicide or the extent in which depression is not directly linked with only social media, how can I possibly explain to her how I feel? Especially since she thinks that‚Äôs she‚Äôs doing a great job at parenting because she compares herself to Asian parents who mercilessly beat their kids‚Äù

Edit: My question is this: should I go up to my parents and be blunt?"
SkunkySkunky,fdnfdx1,t1_fdn368k,Personally I think that you should be blunt with them; it'll probably be a shitty conversation but working yourself to death isn't worth it.
neo_neo_neo_96,fdnd78f,t1_fdn368k,"Dude, indian here, trust me, being blunt never helps. At least, as I experienced it, they wont understand until you do something reckless and even then, some parents will be in denial."
Flawless_Cub,fdnmcmb,t1_fdn368k,"Talk to them in a language they understand: Science and statistics. Depression and mental health in general is a series of chemical reactions in our brain with various causes, Millions of people are afflicted with it with the majority being not professionally diagnosed. Give them material to read from reliable sources. 

People are ignorant, there's no getting around it. Start with educating your parents, replace the stigma about mental health with knowledge. Spread it out over several conversations. 

Most importantly, don't expect anything. there is a minuscule chance that they'd understand and help you and get you professional help, it's worth risking it. But in case they don't, don't let it break you."

flounderingknitter,fdne121,t3_em54sj,"Not Indian, but my mom did this with me after my parents split when I was in middle school. My success was what she used to measure her success, so I displayed to her friends and anything less than beyond perfection was a failing.

I was driven into such deep depression because of it, but I learned to use studying and after school clubs as a way to keep me away from her. Every moment I focused on something else was another moment I didn‚Äôt have to see her or hear her bullshit demands. 

I‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôre going through this. It‚Äôs not okay."
Flawless_Cub,fdn39vm,t3_em54sj,"Indian here; so relate to this, many of us do. I know it's tough to bear and tougher to get away from.

I had depression, wanted..needed.. to see a therapist, my mom had me assaulted by a tantrik! The only reason I could get better is because I found great friends who helped me.

My suggestion would be to surround yourself with people who understand you and have a positive influence on your life.

Take care of yourself please."
fawwin,fdn54xe,t1_fdn39vm,"I do have a group of friends who support me: my American school friends. I know that they can‚Äôt fully relate to this issue but I know that they are trying their best to understand and they are quite sympathetic when my mom walks into my room while I‚Äôm talking to them telling me to turn off my phone and study. 


This is good advice and I recommend it to others too."
jackiedz,fdn3sg3,t3_em54sj,"I honestly think that some (and by that I mean most) Indian parents that incapable of having the emotional intelligence to take care of a child. I blame all the arranged marriages for this because In an Indian culture it‚Äôs two very young people who don‚Äôt even want to get married end up having to figure out all this stuff on their own. 
You cannot change how your parents think about you. if you begin to start chasing that feeling of acceptance from your parents, your not going to  get it. Your better off focusing on what you want to do for your career and figuring out long term goals. 
Your parents probably won‚Äôt be happy about the decisions you make but they will learn to live with it. Don‚Äôt get too disheartened by them, you can‚Äôt change them so just focus on yourself for now."
fawwin,fdn5ibl,t1_fdn3sg3,"I‚Äôm sort of doing both. I do have a very laid out plan of what I‚Äôm going to do in my future (marketing because marketing is fun :)) and I know business is a field my parents are accepting of. 

However, I agree about the lack of emotional intelligence thing. The guy I want to be with is white which is a hugeeee no no but it‚Äôs like sorry it‚Äôs how I feel and how I felt for years now. 

Even then, I‚Äôm just patiently waiting for graduation. Once I do, I won‚Äôt have to have a single damn about anyone. For now, I‚Äôm stuck like this and will be continuing to try to please my parents until I finally get out."
cbunni666,fdnc9cr,t3_em54sj,"The sad part the most you can do is stick it out until your move out. I know it sucks but its not like other parents are going to step in and help. You're not going to change a mindset overnight even if you did something drastic. Even if you did they are going to shove the blame of the problem onto you because why would they ever think they are wrong? When its done generation after generation, its nailed in pretty tough. To them, YOU'RE the one thats got the wrong mindset. 

Best I can tell you is stick to your work to keep them at bay and get out the first chance you got."
fawwin,fdngh8k,t1_fdnc9cr,That‚Äôs what I thought. I‚Äôll try my best.
Jebiwibiwabo,fdnj47e,t3_em54sj,"I feel this so much, although my situation is a bit different, I'm always in my parents shadow, mom was a coordinator for the ""IB"" program (tldr difficult pathway that allows you to apply globally), she is also a hard worker and has a lot of experience, I went to that highschool and every teacher would either tell my mom or me whenever I wasnt performing ""up to standards"", anything that wasn't a high B got dismissive views, I was also getting on average 3-4 hours of sleep per day which didn't help either, high school was a mess overall, where a lot of my mental issues began, of course there's a lot more to my personal story but still isn't fun regardless, I hope you get through this man, good luck in everything."
fawwin,fdnmoxt,t1_fdnj47e,"My mom pressured me heavily to do the IB program because many of my peers are in IB (the same peers I‚Äôm constantly compared to) and she thought that the program would help me get into a good college.

It was the one time in my life I put my foot down and told her straight that I would not do IB due to the intense workload with relatively low payoff and that I would rather do AP classes at a public school and keep my middle school friends. 

I‚Äôm very proud of my decision because I would‚Äôve definitely disgracefully dropped out had I participated in IB. Mad respect for you and anyone else in IB and haven‚Äôt dropped."

fawwin,fdn64ro,t1_fdn3so7,That‚Äôs understandable and I wish there was more awareness to this issue along with the growing awareness for mental health in general.
Codiac03,fdn6j7j,t1_fdn64ro,"I feel you. In the US, older people (the ones in charge) shrug off mental illness even though it's a growing issue. It says something when a mental hospital for children is worse in every aspect than a juvenile detention center. I've been fighting a rather severe case of Bipolar for years. I was diagnosed at 4, and I'm 17 now. Not once have I got real help other than a pill that helps half the time. One week at the mental hospital mentioned above cost more than 5k in total expenses. I'd also like to point out it wasn't voluntary admittance. IDFK where you are, but I can only imagine what its like elsewhere. While the US may have bad mental healthcare, I know there's worse, and I'm sorry if you live in one of those places."
fawwin,fdn70yw,t1_fdn6j7j," My dude, I AM in the US and I totally feel you with the BS mental health system. It is cheaper to travel all the way to Bangladesh and get healthcare than to even step foot in a hospital here. 

I don‚Äôt want to go into a mental hospital, just a therapist."
Codiac03,fdn7g5d,t1_fdn70yw,"Makes sense with the mental hospital thing. As for therapists, if you're in high school, I recommend CIS. It's free and easy to sign up for. It gives you someone to talk to, and while they are not really therapists, I do feel like they do a therapist's job just fine (at least the people at my school). Other than that, I can't help much. I haven't seen a real therapist in years due to cost. Hope you're able to get to one"
diamonds_lost,fdnkm57,t3_em54sj,"I'm American. Though there is not as much pressure from others, I feel that same stress. It's me versus everyone else on the planet.

If not, I'll be stuck here at the bottom while people in power continue to betray the public, powerless to do anything about it."
JeffMangumStains,fdnnz5a,t3_em54sj,"I'm sorry, that sounds awful. I'm not sure if there's a way to talk to your parents about this, but my guess would be that others are probably right and the best course of action is to wait until college to gain some freedom. You are fairly close to being in college, yeah?"
fawwin,fdnr5mz,t1_fdnnz5a,Yeah so close yet so far it feels
JeffMangumStains,fdnzyju,t1_fdnr5mz,"Hang in there friend. I just entered college and it's so much better. My family was definitely not strict like yours, but there is so much more freedom regardless. Do you know what college you'll be attending?"

JeffMangumStains,fdrmf8y,t1_fdomsn6,"Oh cool! Well best of luck. Keep in mind that college will be your best opportunity to escape your parents, which makes it a great opportunity to pursue things you're interested in vs what they want or expect you to study"

SusieEarthCitizen,fdnw2bh,t1_fdnvb6k,"You should actually! In fact I was about to suggest it but I know it would be insensitive when it‚Äôs about financial issues ( you maybe still studying for all you know) and I don‚Äôt know your age exactly. 

But my advise is to take the ‚Äú18 and out‚Äù route like a lot of Americans do! Not just for your sanity but it will improve your social skills, opportunities and privacy! Indian parents will create obstacles to this naturally so be prepared for the worst. Save some money, make arrangements and sort your docs and papers secretly! I had an awful mom too who were not only dismissive but intrusive and actually prevented me from studying ( opposite of most Indian parents actually). But I am very glad I went out and this largely affected the way they treat me ( no longer treat me like shit actually)"
Userur,fdo1hyg,t3_em54sj,"First, I am sorry that you are struggling like this. It isn't fair to you. While I am not indian, I don't believe that such thinking has to do with indian culture, as such thinking can and has arisen in cultures throughout the world. It is rather a human tendency, one that can be seen in an individual case, as well as in a broader case like a society. A social problem runs parallel with an individual problem, just manifested in a bigger scale. I'll use an example,

I used to go to a school in a place called decatur. There I got bullied a lot, and often felt out of place. I felt like I was viewed as some kind of outcast that nobody would ever want to date, or be friends with. Granted I had some friends, the prevailing vibe was negative. There was one guy that left a scar in me emotionally I still have. He would gossip about me in front of me to other people, and tell me that nobody likes me. One statement he said that struck me deep was ""making friends is a skill, one that you just lack."" That statement among other things left a scar in me emotionally. When I left that school district and went to another school, things changed in my life. I made meaningful friends, and fell in love with a girl. Now the love that I had for her, which I expressed with the utmost romanticism, was a reaction to the scar I received in decatur, as her loving me is a contradiction to that prior state of being. A contradiction to those that hurt me. And so I cherished her. She cheated on me, and I forgave her that same day. And I would hold onto her through thick or thin. So that change in my life, became a big part of my identity and served as a source of motivation. And it did so because it was a contradiction in the positive sense to an experience I had prior in decatur.

But from that same contradiction came a fear. A fear that I would return to that prior state, of being left out and seen as socially inferior. Anything associated with decatur high became something I feared. Having ocd, I would even wash my hands after touching my backpack I used there. And if I had to go to decatur, I would leave my cellphone at home, because I feared that by bringing it my relationship would end. I would stop communicating with people that had any affiliation with decatur. And whenever my mother would ask me to go shopping at the store we go to in decatur, since we live just outside of it, I would go to another store in a different area. Get the same things, just not in decatur. Now why did I go to all these great extents? I did so because I feared a return to that state of being. To how I was, and to how I was viewed or treated. In runs right through the center of my being, and it was also from that same place and reasons that I loved my ex the way I did. It was a response to an existential fear. Scaling up, a society can react in the same way to a scarring it experiences. And the nature of the scarring determines the nature of the reaction. I think that this aspect of indian society is a reaction to historical events. Being viewed as being lesser than, and from that wounding develops the need to prove otherwise. I think that if you went to india 300 years ago, aside from the vast technological difference, such a phenomena wouldn't exist. That serves as motivation, but then the fear kicks in in order to keep that response going even when it isn't necessary. And when indian people immigrate to america, and see the prosperity or potential thereof, attaining that is a contradiction in the positive sense to the prior state of being, hence being impoverished. 

I don't think this is uniquely indian or asian. This is a human phenomena, a collective reaction not unlike the kind of reaction I had to my experience in decatur, but just in a different context and obviously scale. Just like how an individual, like myself, obsessed with the things that were or represented a contradiction to the prior undesired state, a society will collectively, but unconsciously, become obsessed with the things that also promise or represent a positive contradiction to the prior undesired state, or a continuation of the current contradiction. All obsessions though are based on fear. A similar kind of obsession would be americas obsession with capitalism, and their irrational fear of communism. This fear developed a century ago when big business owners in countries like the us, and other imperialists at the time saw the concept of communism as being threatening to their hegemony, since the underpaid, poorly treated people working under them would see it as a means of getting justice and leveling the playing field. Revolutions by communists occurred, like as the case with the soviet union, though all communist revolutions began as hummanitarian, and eventually became authoritarian, since they vested too much power in government. Something that also furthened the wests fears. And so the U.S. set off on a campaign of brainwashing their citizenry into thinking anything that has to do with socialism and communism is bad. And as such, bernie sanders gets called communist whenever he tries to bring about certain reforms that exist in other capitalist countries. There are so many other possible analogies to different societal obsessions, like the leftist american obsession with social justice. It is taking a virtue and obsessing about it until that virtue turns into something unhealthy and detrimental. But such phenomena isn't because of which part of the world the people come from, it is purely human nature. 

Those are just my thoughts on this."
fawwin,fdondcv,t1_fdo1hyg,"Interesting point of view, friend. What makes me optimistic is that I will learn from my parents‚Äô mistakes (probably as a response to that aforementioned fear of repetition of scars) in which I will raise my future child less like how I was raised. I want to have more open conversations with my child and to be trusted by my child in the same way that my parents learned from their parents about how to raise a child (which is why I‚Äôve never been hit or physically abused in any way like my parents have when they were young)."
Bluescreenerror2,fdoxd6f,t3_em54sj,"If you're not Indian don't even bother to relate. This isn't even half of the abuse. Along with parental issues that the children face, there are many more like cultural sanctions, fucked up education system and a sense of competition between kids."
fawwin,fdpilqh,t1_fdoxd6f,"This sounds like something that happens in India itself. In America it‚Äôs a more nuanced type of abuse in my opinion.

Still, I totally agree with and that‚Äôs what makes it so difficult to correct express the struggle to those who have never been in that specific situation"
Thrwnmosq,fdmzgtv,t3_em54sj,I don't think it's a location thing. Parents are like this everywhere.
fawwin,fdn41bd,t1_fdmzgtv,"I don‚Äôt know. I kind of disagree.

From what I‚Äôve seen so far in America and my travels from NY to CA, I‚Äôve seen that parents tend to be a bit more permissive with their kids and, well, actually let them have bf and gf so they understand relationships at an early age. Or, unlike many parents in my culture, have a level of acceptance towards community colleges because they give you necessary education at a very low price. 

I don‚Äôt doubt that there are parents from other cultures like mine (such as the Filipinos and that turkey comment) but it‚Äôs kind of ironic how the experience I described in my post is soooo common in Asian culture that it has become a stereotype."
lilCEEsir,fdnkq53,t1_fdmzgtv,This is a cultural thing: very much so. Western parents are NOT the same.
lilCEEsir,fdnlm68,t1_fdn41bd,"You are so god damned smart. How horrible that they are giving you this complex of perfection isn't good enough. I don't really know what to say, I have little to no advice I am a parent though & have a small story.  My kid (7) struggles with reading, very skilled with numbers but not great with letters.  She has a reading tutor from the school at the moment and she is back up to Grade level. If I would've implied that she wasn't good enough or angry at her for not picking up it up right away, she wouldn't of made nearly as much progress and would hate reading for life. I read your story and I see that situation done the wrong way, your entire life.

&#x200B;

Your parents have values that are instilled in them through generations, I agree it won't be easy, but maybe offer a suggestion of how they could help instead of contribute to your mental illness, of just being a little more supportive when you aren't top of everything and that will lead to you doing better. What they are doing will contribute to any break down you may have."

Misrta,fe8m3n1,t3_eo0v3v,"I‚Äôm fucked with my somatic illness, which leaves me paralysed by fatigue, numbed out and overwhelmed with other physical symptoms. I wish I could just die to escape this mess. There‚Äôs no way it‚Äôs going to get better. I‚Äôve been like this for many years and the symptoms go up and down in intensity. I feel guilty because my parents treat me as though it‚Äôs not really an issue and merely blame my autism. The only thing keeping me from doing it is that it would hurt my parents."
slemmygoo84,fe8mkmf,t3_eo0v3v,"I think most adults feel like this at some point, honestly. Just not all of us consider suicide as serious option. Like, for me sometimes that feeling that I want to escape comes off as ""I want to run away"", or ""I want to go home"", and then I quickly realize that I have no place to ""run"" to and no childhood home that I'd ever actually want to be in. In the past, those realizations only compounded that stuck, frustrated, hopelessness. Shit got REAL dark... REAL fast. 
To make things worse, the nature of depression wants us alone. It wants us to isolate and not talk about what's happening inside us. So the darkness consumes us as easy prey. We become loops of amplified negative thoughts and that cycle is incredibly difficult to stop once I'm in it.
I'm so grateful that I kept saying shit to people in spite of my own head telling me not to. So when my suicide attempt failed... everyone (including me) knew how important it was that I focus a huge amount of time and energy on getting well. I found the people (doctor, therapist, friends and 12 step support groups) I need to stand a fighting chance. The fight is still very real for me, it always will be but it has gotten easier. 
Please don't give up now. There are people and places that can and want to help you. Just keep asking for help and take the help when its offered. You deserve it. We deserve it."

My own family didn't give a shit about me on christmas/my birthday every year because I can't get a job so no one can get money off me. Social media is this fake bullshit thing and it's all nonsense. I talked about my boiler breaking during this winter and how miserable I am no one said a thing yet when I posted an ass photo everyone loved me. I hate the world.

Life is heavy enough as it is without all the fakery of social media. I feel like I have to be fake at work because I deal with the public. I feel like I have to be fake on social media or else everyone will dismiss me. I have to be fake around my family or they treat me like shit.

The only time I feel like I'm me is when it's 2AM and everyone else is asleep and I don't have to do anything to appease anyone else. And it's cripplingly lonely being the real me.

I'm very depressed, and depression gives you a lot of experience with people leaving. It's easy to resent them for it, but... truth is most of us are just treading water, and don't have the resources to deal when someone who's drowning glomps onto them. 

For what it's worth which is probably not much, I care, although admittedly in an abstract sense that your depressed, from one emotional being to another."
_Ophiuchus_,fdiu4fc,t3_eldgnh,"I believe the selfishness most people express is some kind of immaturity. People don‚Äôt just suddenly become mature in every way all at the same time.

Some choose to learn, others don‚Äôt. But I think most people learn by mistake anyways.

Friendships are built, connection grows with time. And some people are mature enough to nurture that connection with you even in rough times. But only if they‚Äôre a better person than most.
