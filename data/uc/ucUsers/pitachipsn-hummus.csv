ActualHippies,fpaxf5y,t3_gbyakd,1588457711.0," part of being a hippie (in my opinion) is rejecting things like consumerism and materialism, both of which r supported by buying and wearing clothes from  big brands. would i judge someone for doing those things anyways? not at all!!! it’s just not as common to see in this community, and does reflect where u stand on that particular issue"

Acid,fnqm4rl,t3_g3cu1k,1587167383.0,"i’ve felt this way tripping with people, and just psychedelics in general make it easier for me to “see through” people, past exteriors and facades to their internal core of character, values, and inner thoughts and feelings. if i trip again, i’ll probably do it alone. i also relate to feeling like an observer when i trip with others, for some reason it’s like my mind is a blank canvas and it’s hard for me to get into my own thoughts and psyche. idk why, i’m not really a fan of the feeling either."
