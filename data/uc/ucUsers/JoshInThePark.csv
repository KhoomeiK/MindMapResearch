ApplyingToCollege,fo09niv,t3_g4yf1j,1587408541.0,"I recently got out of the Army back in December. Iâ€™ve taken a couple semesters at UMUC as well. Maintained a 3.8 gpa, I also have a shit high school gpa with like a 2.6 lmao. 

I applied to UC Santa Cruz + Merced + a Cal state school by home. I got accepted to the cal state last month, waitlisted at Santa Cruz and havenâ€™t heard back from Merced. 

As long as your gpa at UMUC is high, Iâ€™d recommend just shooting for whatever school you want to go to. Def recommend getting a LoR from your CO/PL before you separate"

ApplyingToCollege,fnrkhym,t3_g3iszj,1587191851.0,"Going to be near impossible to transfer from a UC -> UC. The UC school system takes CC students as priority. Since you're enrolled in a 4 year you're at the bottom of the barrel for precedence. If you want to go to UCLA/UCB so badly, do another year of CC and then apply again."

I'd recommend adding somewhere in there that you attend the school if you were admitted, let them know that you're serious. Tell them how much you appreciate still being considered for admittance."
UCSC,fnnwje1,t1_fnnw3s8,1587103941.0,I'm taking it as a grain of salt. Not very likely the person works in admissions lol. I've been agonizing myself by living off of Reddit + college confidential threads :'(
