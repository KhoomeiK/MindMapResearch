Warthunder,fp8q144,t3_gbz36o,1588399292.0,‚ÄúAn eye for an eye makes the world go blind‚Äù
Warthunder,fp0lxpj,t3_galyck,1588211932.0,Yup that‚Äôs how Ruhr works for whatever reason.
Warthunder,fp0lq41,t3_gambkv,1588211809.0,"I wouldn‚Äôt say it‚Äôs ‚Äúbroken‚Äù but certainly flawed. It is an uphill battle to play as allies above 3.3 br. If you side climb enough you usually will be the highest plane. If you play with a squad you can win regularly. Also having someone above you isn‚Äôt a death sentence, yes they have the upper hand but with calculated defensive flying you can turn the tide especially if you‚Äôre in someone more maneuverable than your adversary."
Warthunder,fospdv7,t3_g9c25j,1588035307.0,What a moron
arma,fom4qqk,t1_fom2k5k,1587878280.0,Thanks!
arma,folxbsq,t3_g82m6v,1587872741.0,What mods did you use for the police?
UCSantaBarbara,folw9yi,t3_g86nuw,1587872005.0,I've heard a lot of people from the LA area have been coming up to Ventura and SB to go to the beach since the beaches are closed down there....
Warthunder,folqkm3,t1_folq19u,1587868152.0,Yes do this inside the UserSkins folder
Warthunder,fol0jks,t3_g7x5bo,1587852499.0,"Steps:
1) download the skin you want (make sure it includes .blk file)
2) open your war thunder instal location and find the folder UserSkins
3) create a new folder, name doesn‚Äôt matter but preferably something that identifies the vehicle it‚Äôs for 
4) put the files from the skin you downloaded into this new folder

After this you should see that you do have the option to select a custom skin for whatever plane you downloaded the skin for."
Warthunder,fokzr6o,t1_fokwrm6,1587852061.0,Just create a folder for the template inside the userskins folder. It doesn‚Äôt matter what you name it; all that matters is the .blk file inside the folder.
Warthunder,fok4ze0,t3_g7x5bo,1587835511.0,No idea why it‚Äôs like that; but you can get around it so long as you can download a skin with the .blk file. If you have the .blk file you can put any skin in the same folder as it and it will be applied to that vehicle. The .blk tells the game what to map the skin to
Warthunder,fods8rt,t3_g6wz38,1587689162.0,I haven‚Äôt played ab in forever but what what br are bots common at? I don‚Äôt recall ever seeing bots in ab.
Warthunder,fo917n1,t3_g6ecsy,1587608246.0,Most important aspect of planes is situational awareness; learn to look around and learn how to look at an enemy while they are behind you. It will make you much better at flying defensively. Learn some basic flight maneuvers too and good habits early such as not commuting to head ons.
Warthunder,fo7qj12,t1_fo7f6d0,1587582819.0,To be fair the perpetrator‚Äôs name is ‚Äúdabtk‚Äù so it‚Äôs very possible he does this sort of thing quite often...
Warthunder,fo7awwy,t1_fo6axu8,1587575227.0,I didn‚Äôt say anything to him; the Death guy was annoyed by dabtk‚Äôs passive behavior and started showing it in the chat. In the top image he says ‚Äúyoure in a k4 and youre scared of an f8f‚Äù as he‚Äôs being shot. Also should be noted that the teamkiller seemed to be chat banned as they only used the quick chat.
Warthunder,fo5taqs,t1_fo5sypd,1587535008.0,"Yeah..over 12,000 hours in bombers alone. My most played game on steam has 2,200 hours played."
Warthunder,fo5stig,t1_fo5q49a,1587534575.0,"Yeah it does suck; most allied bombers are near unplayable in the current state of the game. Late German bombers are obviously fine, the g8n1 is pretty good survivability wise but has a poor bomb load and high repair cost"
Warthunder,fo5sji7,t1_fo5r4vm,1587534328.0,"Yeah he‚Äôs a cool guy from the games I‚Äôve had with him. Didn‚Äôt know about the war veteran thing! Might explain why he has enough time to fly over 12,000 hours in bombers alone"
Warthunder,fo5sf7a,t1_fo5q3bg,1587534224.0,"Yeah he is a legend; cool guy too. It‚Äôs more the amount of time played than the type of vehicle being used.....over 12,000 hours in bombers alone."
Warthunder,fo5o307,t3_g5o08n,1587530624.0,Reminds me of a guy named fmt3....he has like 500 days of playtime in BOMBERS
Warthunder,fo5nezw,t1_fo5in02,1587530099.0,Oh wow didn't even know there was an option to turn it off. Must've been the default setting or I changed it a long time ago.
Warthunder,fo5fvtf,t3_g5taru,1587524659.0,You can; go to community then replays. It shows a list of your most recent battles there.
Warthunder,fnwegla,t3_g49azr,1587316827.0,Yes Russian teams do lose often to Japan but it‚Äôs not because Japan is OP. A lot of people when playing Russia don‚Äôt climb and try to turn fight. Definitely a l2p issue
Warthunder,fne678k,t1_fne5lzw,1586883766.0,Agreed ü§¢
Warthunder,fn9e2gp,t3_g0fhc0,1586769371.0,Might be packet loss; you should be able to tell if it is. In the bottom right you can see your PL by your ping. Could it simply be your mouse?
Warthunder,fn5oar1,t3_fzphh1,1586670502.0,So poor aim and luck?
Warthunder,fn5npt7,t1_fn5ipbi,1586670005.0,Yeah they're pretty decent actually.
Warthunder,fn2c158,t1_fn2blcn,1586583915.0,I guess I shouldn't have assumed someone with this kind of content would be smart enough to use a username different from their YT.
Warthunder,fn22r67,t1_fn21w1n,1586576304.0,What level are you and how far along are you in the air trees? Takes some luck to get an ace game; ideally you need your team to not be awful and not to be too good (so there are enough kills to go around) It‚Äôll happen eventually though :)
Warthunder,fn1ytbj,t3_fyr9k3,1586573441.0,We gotta figure out what his in game name is
Warthunder,fn1xr6v,t3_fys9dp,1586572680.0,"Drop the bombs on soft targets, strafe them with your gunners."
Warthunder,fmz7unc,t1_fmz57b2,1586509844.0,Yes she is a beauty! Took me about a month of playing mostly Japanese jets from when I first started researching it to purchasing it. And then there was of course the struggle of unlocking the missiles....
Warthunder,fmz7q8l,t1_fmz55uy,1586509708.0,Personal preference; default is blue but I find it can hard to see blue against the sky or water at times so I changed it to bright green.
Warthunder,fmyshwp,t1_fmyjszi,1586494436.0,"They did build a prototype of the r2y1 (piston engine version of the same airframe)

Warthunder,fmyr6fv,t1_fmynj5r,1586493350.0,For air trees I'd agree but for ground and naval tier 3 is when the grind gets painful....even tier 2 for ships
Warthunder,fmy21zg,t1_fmy1q43,1586476466.0,The c-3 variant does. The b-2 does not
Warthunder,fmy1gf1,t1_fmy0nik,1586476113.0,Only if you‚Äôre talking premium bombers like the ju288 or bv238. The repair costs are too high for many bombers to make a consistent. Either fly a fighter that you do really well in or use an attacker that can carry bombs/rockets and then kill pillboxes
Warthunder,fmv6528,t3_fxirl9,1586407096.0,Sad thing is the clouds still don‚Äôt look great
Warthunder,fmv5nfi,t1_fmv3h9e,1586406731.0,Yeah for real haha. Otherwise the plane is close to stalling
Warthunder,fmqwayu,t3_fwwear,1586308456.0,Go to settings and use fall colors for post fx and turn your gamma up.
Warthunder,fmdc4jf,t3_fukg0e,1585964158.0,Gaijin uses player performance as a metric to determine br......I‚Äôm guessing there isn‚Äôt much to go on for the Chinese version
