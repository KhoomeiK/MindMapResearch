&#x200B;

Edit: To someone asking if the show is worth finishing:

No i dont think so. I'm on season 3, 2 episodes in, and its stupid. Wish I'd never gotten into it. They set up this alt world with such promise only to make it about the characters and they did a piss poor job at that; the cast sucks ass. Smith and Frank are the only bearable characters. The actress who portrays Juliana cant act to save her life. Amazon fucked up."
