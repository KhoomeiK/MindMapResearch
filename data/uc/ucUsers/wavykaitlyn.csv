UCSD,fos443x,t3_g8isjv,1588023620.0,I got a concussion last year during finals week and I brought all the needed paperwork from the hospital to my professors and they were more than accommodating with giving extensions on finals and postponing them til next quarter if I wanted to. All I needed was paperwork to show I wasn’t in the condition to study/think and they were all pretty understanding about it!
