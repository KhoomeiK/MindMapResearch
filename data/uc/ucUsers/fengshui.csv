boardgames,fpm7iyi,t1_fplhauq,1588727155.0,"I'm not sure you want these details, but I think you have it wrong.  The rules specifically tell you what Exhausted means, and even specifically mention Break and Corrosive by name:
>When Skill Dice are used, they must be
Exhausted (unless otherwise noted). Exhausted Dice are stored to the left of the Gearloc Mat for the remainder of the current battle and are no longer available to you. All Exhausted dice are unexhausted after battle. Baddie Skills may force you to Exhaust
Atk or Def Dice. Each die Exhausted in this way reduces your Atk or Def Stat by 1 for the battle (e.g., Break, Corrosive).

I don't know where you found that defense dice are only exhausted for a round.  That's not true.  Now both corrosive and break have some subtleties, but they both come specifically out of the exact rules. (Break only exhausts dice that do actual HP damage, no other; Corrosive only exhausts defense dice not used to block damage this round, as described in the FAQ).

I've played 5 or 6 games of TMB, and I don't feel that the rules are unclear.  They can be exacting, and you have to read them carefully, but they are there.  Are there other examples of unclear rules that frustrate you?"
UCSantaBarbara,fpfefdn,t1_fpey9xn,1588568839.0,"I generally recommend leaving your home area if you can do so.  College is your opportunity to practice being an adult.  If you are in SD with your family, you'll be pulled into their orbit all the time, rather than making your own."
DungeonWorld,fp6ge5c,t1_fp6dan3,1588351887.0,"Yeah, perhaps that 35% rate is more the rate of an ineffectual hit, even against an average commoner in no armor.  Zombies have an 8 AC, which gives you a little better sense of what a un-resisting target might look like.

My main point was that it's really easy to fall in to the habit of assuming that any attack that doesn't reach the enemy's AC is a ""miss"".  As I'm describing the combat, it's useful for me to have a rough guideline for when I should describe the attack as blocked/armored, vs a clean miss, no contact.  Comparing the attack to an AC between 8 and 10 gives me that, without much overhead."
DungeonWorld,fp61led,t1_fp560al,1588344338.0,"My rule of thumb is that role that fails to hit AC 10 is a miss, and a role that lands between 10 and the monsters AC is a glancing blow, dodged, or otherwise blocked by armor."

UCSantaBarbara,fotgil6,t1_fotewgq,1588053258.0,"This is all totally true, but it's not what I meant by critical thinking.  I was more thinking about the skills of evaluating argument, forming your own thoughts and arguments based on understanding of materials, engaging in debate or discussion to refine your understanding, then expressing that understanding in written form. Developing that skill takes time to do the reading or learning, integrate the understanding, do more learning, etc.  It's also a lot of what the liberal arts attempt to teach.

What you're describing is more in the categories of situational awareness, decision making, OODA loops, etc.  It's a much faster process, and is totally needed in many parts of life.  It's just a different skill and ended up using the same term for it.  :D"

boardgames,fok5z3c,t1_foioar9,1587836018.0,"That's fair.  I wasn't including shipping, and I think the majestics are a little higher prices at retail (not pre-order).  They're about 20% more expensive, so you can decide if the higher performance is worth it for you.

Thankfully, most chip vendors sell sample sets, so you can order ten-chip sets of each kind you're considering and compare them in-person.  I would recommend that to anyone before they put down $150+ for a larger set."
boardgames,foikxys,t1_foihs32,1587789278.0,"The alternative I'd suggest is any of the China Clays, or specifically the Apache Majestics or their train gamer chips coming later this year. Should be about the same price at $.40/chip, and has a more Paulsony feel. (I have both Majestics and Paulsons on my desk and while the Paulsons are slightly better than the Apaches, they certainly aren't 4 times better, in my opinion.)

I like the composite chips like the iron Clays, Tikis or the Dia de los Muertos, but the slipperiness and the high pitch sound on impact is not for me. YMMV."

AirBnB,fo05trx,t1_fnzzkl3,1587406599.0,"Yes, given the impact to tenants and the prevalence of malicious landlords, the eviction system in most states has a lot of tenant protections built in. While it can work well to rent monthly or longer, I would deeply vet any potential long term tenant.

espresso,fny8qsh,t1_fnxhe5z,1587356223.0,"Yeah, I have a similar situation, but I stuck with it for almost 8 years.  Over those 8 years, I have sent my machine back to Breville 5 times.  4 of the 5 times, I received a new unit back instead of a repaired or refurbished unit.  One time, I received a 920XL in place of the 900XL I sent in.  On only one occasion did I pay the $400 fee.  Every other time they covered it under warranty.  

For replacements, if I were upgrading from the BDB to the $2k range, I'd look at NS, Rocket, Profitec, and Lelit.  There's been a lot of positive reports on the Lelit Bianca recently, but all those are good."
