tipofmytongue,fmnmdrn,t3_fwczbs,1586229480.0,"It’s not that one Love, Death, Robots episode I’m pretty sure. I SWEAR I didn’t make this up, but whatever I search just comes up with “Law and Order - produced by Dick Wolf”. 

I think the bad cop’s genetic makeup is used as a plot twist, so it’s not known for most of the video? But we know that the good cop is wolf since the beginning I’m pretty sure."
