I rarely reviewed until two or three days before finals and I loved to take a nap whenever I feel blue. I also got 3 B's and only took 3 APs and got into UCLA, so I'd say it's definitely possible to get into T20 if you have impressive essays and ECs. Idk if mine were that good, but considering that I somehow got in, I guess it wasn't too crappy. Anyways, best of luck to you and hope to see you on campus next year!!"
