aww,fpmuurw,t1_fpmlikp,1588742350.0,it's a munchkin. controversial but likely healthier than a pug
aww,fpmuiiw,t1_fpmpz3z,1588742087.0,"she's a munchkin, it's a single gene mutation that causes cats to be short. people find it cute, but there's controversy due to perceived health affects (spine issues, which have not been proven) and real health affects (some chest deformities and issues with being able to do normal cat things, like jump well). additionally, breeding two munchkins together causes ~1/4th of the kittens to die.  
  
  I personally don't think that intentionally breeding munchkin cats is good, but the cats live comparably healthy lives compared to many standard dog breeds. if someone was choosing between a purebred pug and a munchkin cat I'd rather they buy the munchkin. (but ofc I'd rather people just adopt from their local shelter)"

PoliticalHumor,fpmlxqh,t1_fpmiz3q,1588736010.0,"not voting helps republicans due to the electoral college being shitty. for people who live in the like 5 swing states that will decide for the country, not voting is essentially a vote for Trump especially if you typically have voted democrat in the past.  
  
  you don't have to support Biden to recognize how dangerous Trump is to this country. with Biden, we might have a place for progressive politics in 4-8 years (he's hinted at being intentionally one term) but with Trump and 4 more years of conservative judges and destruction of our international standing, we might never see a progressive US in our lives.   
  
  if you live in like, California, go ahead and not vote. it will (unfortunately due to the shitty system) not matter. but if you live in one of the battleground or swing states I encourage you to reconsider"
PoliticalHumor,fpml1wh,t1_fpmhxcr,1588735442.0,"""maybe Bernie is different"" is the part I don't understand. Bernie is actively supporting and campaigning for Biden right now and has fully endorsed him. yet people will praise Sanders for how he's always been on the right side of history and the only one doing the things that matter and then refuse to vote or talk about how sanders is all in on doing anything to get Trump out, which means electing biden"
PoliticalHumor,fpmkio3,t1_fpmgllm,1588735098.0,"my main issue with the not voting movement is theres only two options right now, Biden or trump. if someone who would have typically voted democrat doesn't vote, that helps trump. the reverse is also true. progressives who plan on voting don't want either of them and don't want baby steps to progress either, but we don't have any other options anymore. our only option is to bully Biden further left and vote. not voting only helps republicans.  
  
  I see it as trump is a nuke and Biden is a bunch of bombs blitz-style. both fucking suck and I don't want either, but at the end of the day we might not recover from the nuke (try getting any progressive policy with an even more conservative packed court with life terms) but we can recover from the bombs, it'll just take a lot of work. we're gonna get one of these options no matter what, I'd rather take the shitty option that at least has a light at the end of the tunnel"

  but other than my cat and a now ex, I just don't like saying it because it wasn't a thing ever said in my family. same goes with hugging or touch in general. it's interesting reading other people who's family was similar to mine in these ways and now they reacted different"
Anxiety,fpj25br,t1_fpj1vff,1588654496.0,"like I said chances are you didn't do anything wrong but something else that helps me when I can't get thoughts out of my head is writing them down so then I don't have to worry about forgetting. it might be helpful to write down a way you think you messed up and then why that's not logical and if it is logical, how you've learned from it so you can be better in the future  
   
  and it's ok to not want to think about other guys, you don't need to replace one person with another  
  
  edit: i want to emphasize that it's most likely nothing you did that caused his feelings to change. it just happens sometimes that people fall out of love and that's nothing to blame yourself for.  
  
  edit again: and the reason he may have acted the way he did yesterday is because he did think he still had feelings but maybe realized he was misunderstanding how he felt. he may have thought that going back to you would help the way he was feeling post the initial breakup, only to find that that wasn't the case. it's less likely to be something you did or him being a jerk as it is him struggling to deal with his own emotional turmoil"
Anxiety,fpj0je6,t3_gdj6t5,1588653298.0,"I think what youre feeling is relatively normal. he picked you up and dropped you right back down which is kinda messed up for him to do and it's super understandable that you feel horrible and maybe even worse than the initial breakup because what he did yesterday was sort of a betrayal in a way.   
  
  I went though my first real breakup a bit over a year ago. he cheated, so it was a pretty different situation but at first I was ok until I 1) saw a pic of him on social media with mutual friends and 2) found out he was dating one of said mutual friends, not 3 months after our 2 year relationship ended AND it was both our first relationship. at that point I felt super betrayed by both (even if that wasnt necessarily logical) and felt so much worse than I did even after being cheated on. the pain stacks honestly. but this all also made my anxiety worse than it's ever been before. I'll get into that more in a bit.  
  
  so I would just think of a few things  
  1) you'll find someone new. most people have felt that someone is ""the one"" only to meet someone much much better later. it's best to try not to dwell on ideas such as ""they were the one""  
  
 2) this happened yesterday, and people say it takes at least 6 months to move on from someone. I would honestly consider this a restart from the first breakup. give yourself some time to feel sad and angry and all that. it's normal to feel these things and you don't need to try to push these feelings away so quickly  
  
  2.5) time. time time time. in a few months you'll likely look back at this post and feel surprised you ever felt so bad. you may not feel 100% for awhile, but you'll feel better with time  
  
  3) distance. it's not healthy for you to be in contact with him. personally, I deleted EVERYTHING (like chat messages, pics that were of just him, and such) and hid away physical objects (couldn't bear to throw things away but looking at them was bad). I didn't delete him on Facebook because he never used it, but if he did I would have. doing this stuff SUCKS but it prevents you from looking and it and triggering yourself more than you already are. plus it prevents things like yesterday 2.0 from happening. can't FaceTime if his numbers blocked   
  doing stuff like this is painful because it's accepting that the relationship is over and that there is no future for it, but it also simplifies the healing process  
  
  4) there is probably no other reason than he didn't love you anymore. it happens a lot. dealing with anxious thoughts like this is difficult and I'm by no means a psychologist but for me assuming the worst was helpful. for example, one thing I worried about was that my ex never loved me and always loved his current gf. when I tried to rationalize this is would end up with cyclical thoughts but when I told myself, yeah he probably did, the cyclical obsessive thoughts stopped. this doesn't work for everyone though. for a friend of mine with depression, assuming the worst made him more depressed. but this leads into my last point.   
  
  5) therapy. my biggest regret is not getting therapy sooner. I can't say if what your feeling is related to an anxiety disorder, normal anxiety, or both but no matter what therapy can help with relationship/breakup issues and anxiety more than a reddit thread ever can. many counselors are doing online therapy these days and you can use insurance for that or they can figure out payment options if your insurance isn't great. there's also apps like betterhelp and talkspace that can be pricy but you get more individual care. I highly recommend looking into options for therapy. given how you mentioned controlling parents I'm making an assumption you're still in school. if I'm wrong I apologize but if you are in school then many schools often have some sort of counselling service. it could be worth it to look into that too.  
  
  finally, I recommend googling the 5 stages of grief. initially designed for grief over death, there's tons of free resources online that focus on how it affects relationships. (also important to realize the 5 (sometimes 7) stages don't all happen in order or at all, contrary to how they are often portrayed)"
Anxiety,fpixq5i,t3_gdk8jn,1588651229.0,"I just got prescribed Prozac, and I'm worried about side effects. what was it like getting the rare/dangerous effects and switching meds?"
Anxiety,fpix9mw,t1_fpe3du9,1588650902.0,"im tentatively diagnosed with OCD and for OCD is apparently good to assume the worst sometimes because it breaks the OCD cycle.  
  
  OCD unmanaged has you switching, for example, between like ""anxiety: I'm going to vomit"" ""you: I'm not going to"" ""anx: I am"" ""you: I'm not"" ""anx: but what if I am?"" ""you: no I'm not"" over and over  
  but then you can manage it like ""anx: I'm going to vomit"" ""you: yeah I am"" and then there's nothing to cycle with. it takes practice and clearly doesn't work for all types of anxiety  
  
  so my point is different things work for different people with different types of anxiety or symptoms"
Anxiety,fpivzcn,t3_gdpufx,1588650004.0,I just got prescribed meds for the first time and was told that severe mood swings is a symptom to discuss with your doctor like asap because it might be a bad fit for you
Anxiety,fpiv80f,t3_gdp75b,1588649496.0,"I've been dealing with something similar. my ex cheated, we broke up, he near immediately started dating a girl we were both friends with who had suddenly dropped me like a year prior. I've ended up with a lot of anger and bitterness towards her and was in a similar boat as you where I knew I should get help but I didn't until it was over a year post breakup and I was still thinking about them all the time.  
  
  I started using betterhelp. its kinda pricy, I get 15% off with financial aid (I make about 30k/yr and have no dependents or a partner) and it's about $220 a month. BUT you can do text sessions (scheduled with immediate replies) instead of video or call and you can also text any time (non scheduled, reply within 24 hours).  
  
  it's been really helpful for me, and I've learned a lot about my anxiety and how to manage it including with my obsessive thoughts about my ex and former friend. I typically do call sessions with my therapist and the first one was TERRIFYING but after the second one I did now I feel really comfortable with it and it's nice to talk things out with a non-biased professional but like I said you can do text sessions.   
  
  there's also talkspace which has more pricing options but I'm not sure what their services entail.  
  
  I would recommend looking into each of these options, you can check out the fin aid for betterhelp before you pay and sign up and stuff so it's worth checking out"
ac_newhorizons,fphj08l,t1_fpgpoh5,1588622127.0,"I like that it's dialogue based, it's definitely a part of the charm if the game and people were up in arms when they removed it (mostly blathers) in new leaf.  
  however I think there's major issues with implementation especially in regards to restarting the conversation for a misclick and the fishing tourney. I don't think the answer is to make these things no longer conversations and simplify away the charm, but they definitely need updated.  
  
  I think people get defensive because many of us do enjoy the dialogue and genuinely find it immersive and relaxing (when it's working right) and don't want that to be cut out completely, so when we see requests to do away with it people feel upset and take an equally black and white stance. in reality there's real issues but the conversation is a big part of the game and the best fix would be to find a solution that meets halfway"
