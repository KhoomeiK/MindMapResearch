UCSD,fpfpwq7,t3_gd5s4k,1588579243.0,"I’m in MAE 30A at the moment and we just had our midterm, my raw score was a 71 and after the curve it was around a 90. With the curve the class avg was a 72 approximately."

Traeger,fpdk3hg,t1_fpdjutn,1588528548.0,"That’s what I figured was the easiest solution, I was just wondering if any of the frequent users had any feed back."
Traeger,fpdibqv,t1_fpdhwlr,1588527551.0,"Okay sounds good, I had left it over night and when I came back it was low, maybe a taller hopper will allow longer run time."
Traeger,fpdfbb8,t3_gcu4ik,1588525869.0,I have been running in to problems with the hopper feeding the wood pellets in to the BBQ. Initial there was a grate at the bottom but that was restricting the flow so I removed it. I thought I had fixed the problem but I woke up this morning to find the machine not running because it ran out of pellets. Does anyone have a solution for this?
americanairlines,fp7qhw3,t3_gbovk9,1588375701.0,"I really don’t get this argument that the public is making about the seats. If you are traveling with these new procedures you will have only 16 inches in all directions for the next person if the flight is full. Can someone please explain to how this is considered “social distancing”, there a big difference between 6 ft and 16 inches. 

I know this is going on till may 31st but there is literally no way for any airline to make money either 66% load factor. So I hope this ends soon."
UCSD,fp0ud8a,t1_fp0u55q,1588217121.0,"The system will auto say that but that’s because normally you can’t take all classes pass no pass.


If you take and pass all your classes P/NP you will be in good standing. You can always drop a message to advising if you want a double check but this is what they told me"

UCSD,fp0pj4l,t1_fp0osvt,1588214102.0,It you P/NP all class your gpa will zero for the quarter. UCSD said they won’t penalize people who do this even though it might say you are on academic probation. If you P/NP all but 1 class your grade class with be the sole determiner for your quarter gpa so make sure your over 2.0 otherwise your in academic trouble.
americanairlines,foyuw9v,t1_foxpv6u,1588179616.0,If it makes you feel any better AA has stopped allowing employees sit up in the first class cabins on narrow body aircraft. I am looking forward to see if there are more travelers after aa’s new policy’s
americanairlines,foxndiy,t1_fowgs7l,1588149590.0,"I think your point about the social distancing is really interesting. At the moment if American blocks the middle seat on aircraft that results in an appropriate load factor of 66%, the typical break even load factor is around 70%. This begs the question when are they going to see a higher load factor. 

I also wonder for people who want to fly, do they accept the inherent risks associated with air travel at this time? Not saying you are but I really don’t get people complaining about other travelers when they equally are traveling. 

I am hoping based off IHME models that’s between mid may and early June there can be leisure travel again."
UCSD,foxm6qc,t1_foxl5nv,1588148447.0,"I just think the UC instead of making hard decisions is shouldering the burden on to its students. No wants to furlough anyone but you can’t rip people off either. I just feel like the UC shouldn’t feel they are exempt from the impacts of the pandemic and it’s impacts. I disagree that it would be a “shitshow”, I would think most people would like to see there unprovided for services be refunded. The only people who would not want that are the UC and people being funded by those fees. A RIF may not be a bad thing for UCSD."
UCSD,foxizsv,t1_foxicil,1588145488.0,"What I was trying to get at is they are still charging for services not rendered. For example everyone this quarter has payed to use the gyms but they are all closed. Yes there is a cost to UCSD but they are ultimately not providing what you and I are paying for. I am fine with paying tuition as it’s the same professors and we are getting credit. I think it is reasonable to not want to pay for a service not rendered. 

At first I backed UCSD saying weeks ago it would only make sense for them to refund service not rendered, obviously it’s not to the admins. Now they need to wise up and not blatantly rip people off."
UCSD,fowpyza,t1_fowptw4,1588124715.0,"I dropped the class and am going to do it in the fall, which may be online now. I switched to mae 30a and has been going well."
UCSD,fowb3b2,t3_g9uxgc,1588116364.0,I have a feeling they are doing this as they lost a lot of money refunding the housing because I would guess most of it was already payed off. I am curious if there is any legal grounds for services not rendered. For example the feds are requiring airlines that cancel flights to refund the full price. I don’t see how this is not the same. I hope to see serious repercussions if they don’t reverse this decision. UCSD is treating this situation as if they are the only ones being effected.
sandiego,fo0b77t,t1_fo01783,1587409521.0,"Thanks for this, it’s really interesting. Do you know if there is any official source that compares the likely hood of dying from pneumonia or dying from covid. In other words you were 80 and in bad health and caught pneumonia it would kill you but you caught covid first then it kills that person. What I’m trying to get at is are weak people dying more now or would they have just succumbed via a different method."
sandiego,fnzl5ih,t1_fnyzvdj,1587396164.0,So if I understand this page correctly at the moment we are only testing the most at risk people and that is still producing a relatively low positive ratio (around 11% of tested). If we did test all those who are infected but with mild cases wouldn’t the death rate go down significantly? It’s seems to me that it makes sense to test who we are testing at the moment but are also not accounting for the fact that many cases are not counted and skew the stats. Thats my 2 cents away ways. Thanks for the resources
sandiego,fnymijh,t3_g4jl8u,1587367839.0,"Hi, thanks for putting the data together. I had a few questions for the community and I know this is not r/coronavirus, It seems that California is doing well for the most part with the covid 19. My first question is that what are the requirements to get tested in CA, are they only testing people who have symptoms or can anyone get tested? Also I’m not sure if this is sound reasoning but it seems to me that approximately 89% of people tested have tested negative, would they have just had the flu? My last thought that I have been thinking about is there any way to add some perspective about other illness that cause death, i.e. number of people that die from the flu or pneumonia. I feel like once there is some perspective on the numbers it will help people in the future return to and more relaxed state. Thanks for compiling the data!"
EngineeringStudents,fnufmpa,t1_fnu1x1f,1587260978.0,Not that I’m advocating for this but I have always wonder how stumped the Prof would be if you signed up for the gift card in the profs name and then some how chegg sends it to them per there request.
EngineeringStudents,fnqx6pv,t1_fnqm39d,1587174194.0,The only way to get around this is to buy a visa gift card and then there are no real details.
awardtravel,fnjzy22,t1_fnjzhuy,1587011104.0,To be fair many of these recent outbreaks have originated in China.
americanairlines,fnfd9jw,t3_g19zl4,1586905870.0,This has to do with weight and balance :)
