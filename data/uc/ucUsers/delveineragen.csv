It can be argued that weeder courses depend on the professor and the level of preparation you have for the course/what you like and don’t like. It’s not like the movies. That being said, classes are difficult. Ls7 series is NOT a weeder series in the sense that people don’t get As and it’s impossible to do so. A lot of people As. MOST of the professors are not out to get you and genuinely care about your learning, at least in my experience(Maloy, Esdin). Keyword: most.
That being said, LS7 series is truly fundamentally flawed REGARDLESS of your professor. “It’s not about memorization but more application”...so they say, but good luck navigating the midterms. This is a discussion in and of itself about Ls core. the 7 series is only a weeder series in the sense that you have to adapt FAST to the style of exams and understand how to interpret the questions. For example, people say ls7b is the easiest of the 3 but I hated that class with burning passion and didn’t do as well as I did in 7A and 7c (As in both). Again, a lot of it depends on what you like. 
Chemistry at UCLA is said to be designed with “weeder” lower divs for 14AB and 20AB but again, it’s up to you how much energy you invest/the professor you take it with. A lot of professors in the chem dept reserve As for only top 20% of students, so call that weeder if you like. But it is very much possible to get As in these pre-med/health prereq courses. Other “weeder courses” I’ve heard of are some math and CS classes namely Cs32,33 and math 115a,131a but I’ve never taken them personally so I don’t know. 

Nothing is a weeder class if you actually put the work/hours in and learn the design of the exams. Seriously, you will make many sacrifices but As are possible at UCLA."

ucla,fox60pn,t1_fox5k7i,1588134938.0,Essentially no because isnt that program meant to make college life and transition smoother with small groups to meet people etc? The profs will likely just zoom classes or prerecord and post to CCLE. It will be a similar setting to what the rest of us are doing with online classes
