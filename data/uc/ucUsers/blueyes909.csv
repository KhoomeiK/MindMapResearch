UCSantaBarbara,fpi0p2i,t1_fpi0av0,1588631373.0,"university housing is still being provided to those who want to stay in santa barbara during the quarantine. so you'd likely be allowed to still come here if it's online, although you'd likely get placed in a dorm by yourself and everything on campus would be closed. So, it would be a bad representation of a typical dorm experience."

good luck with classes!"
UCSantaBarbara,fp7cx5s,t3_gbqa9y,1588368275.0,"yes, as long as it doesn't make your total gpa go below a 2.0."
UCSantaBarbara,fp3mz5u,t1_fp3aumd,1588282164.0,yes i think so! not sure of the actual name of the room- but it's not the linda vista room.
UCSantaBarbara,fp39o8l,t1_fp3227t,1588275517.0,"? we must be think of different rooms, because i'm living there currently and definitely have seen some guy in there playing piano occasionally. it's the big lounge that's next to san cat south tower entrance"

UCSantaBarbara,fovris4,t1_fovqrar,1588106277.0,"thank you for the insight!!

any advice you could give about the program?"
UCSantaBarbara,fovovmz,t1_fotifd1,1588104981.0,how did you like the tep program? ive heard its very intensive/time consuming!
UCSantaBarbara,fot7hnh,t3_g9ff9r,1588046409.0,been loving these pics! gives me something pretty to look forward to seeing during these quaratine times :)
UCSantaBarbara,fot2lmq,t1_fososoj,1588043248.0,"apply for a teaching credential program! there's lots of them- the one at ucsb is a Masters of education+a teaching credential in a specific field (english, bio, math, etc). 

you could also substitute teach for a bit after undergrad first if you dont want to jump directly into a teaching program/want to feel more prepared (you just need a bachelors degree to do this). 

while still in undergrad, you can also volunteer in classrooms via programs like CalTeach and SciTrek!

if you or anyone has more questions about teaching requirements, lmk!"
UCSantaBarbara,fosisqo,t3_g9bvzm,1588031533.0,"yes!! I will be a part of ucsb's teacher education program next year.

I'd recommend doing the education minor- allows you to take the education classes- including classes that allow u to volunteer in classrooms (Ed 121 and 122)!

pm me if u have any more questions about teaching credential requirements!"
UCSantaBarbara,fo8p08i,t3_g6bfhp,1587600911.0,yes
UCSantaBarbara,fo0xamx,t1_fo0vjau,1587421518.0,"in regards to sb dorm housing, manzanita would be a good choice for you! it's mainly double rooms and have non-communal bathrooms (bathrooms are public- but you can lock it so you can shower and such without anyone else coming into the bathroom). I lived in manzi for fall and winter quarter and it was super quiet- a total contrast to the typical freshmen dorms. I never had issues with hearing loud, drunk people walking through the halls (like i did with the freshmen dorms). the roommate preferences form you submit will pair you with a roommate with similar living preferences (non-substance lifestyle, prefering no overnight guests, using the room for studying instead of socializing, etc). 

I am not into drinkning, partying, or any thing of that nature and still have enjoyed my time at sb. I like going to the beach and volunteering. There are programs like UCSB adventure program where you can go on weekend trips to different places that i have heard are super fun. If I was able to still enjoy myself here despite not drinking or anything, so can you! You will find people of similar mindsets. 

For physics- i have a friends who's a physics major who really likes it. There's plenty of research opportunities here, so he's been in a lab for a few yrs now. He has a ton of friends in the physics department and has said he really loves it. 

Unfortunately i dont know much about sd :( but i have heard sd is more competitive, but that's about it. In terms of academics, id say sb and sd are about equal. 

please message me if u have more housing questions! ive lived in lots of the dorms: san nic, manzi, san raf, and san cat!"
UCSantaBarbara,fnx25w0,t3_g4f02g,1587329996.0,"you can reserve study rooms at the library! :) 

(that is, if the library is open by fall quarter)"
UCSantaBarbara,fnt2wr7,t3_g3j2xh,1587233583.0,"I've found that making the ""scarier"" choice will make one more independent and branch out more. 

You can still see your friends during breaks and such. 

If you're choosing between ""renowned physics program"" vs "" where most of my friends are going""- I think the choice should be easy- sb! There's 30,000 kids here, you'll definitely make some friends."
UCSantaBarbara,fnnfcoi,t3_g2sj0l,1587091073.0,"majority of the 2 bedroom apartments face the soccer field- so you'll be woken up by parents/kids screaming around 7am on weekend mornings :( 

but 4 bedroom apartments are not located right next to soccer fields- so less noise. 

It's hard to tell what fills up faster- I think only the housing department would know that. 

Yeah, you change change university furniture- but when you eventually move out, you need to put all the original furniture back in it's proper place."
UCSantaBarbara,fnjguzv,t1_fnjegsc,1586998703.0,"did you have trouble with ants ever? i've heard that was a big downfall for some people!

UCSantaBarbara,fnar0y4,t3_g0nys0,1586802303.0,there's no anatomy+ lab nor physiology lab here! just btw- but some med schools like seeing these on transcripts.
UCSantaBarbara,fn865tl,t3_g069ps,1586734737.0,"it's a very unique/specialized program that not many schools have! I feel like it's especially special here since the school is right on the ocean. 

Look into working at the UCSB REEF center if you come here! Super cool experience for marine bio people!"

UCSantaBarbara,fmxq0p5,t1_fmxptej,1586469648.0,"side note: one downside to bio at sb is there's no anatomy+lab nor physiology lab here :( you'd have to take them at a community college if you need them for PA school, med school, etc. 

Whereas, SD offers those classes."
UCSantaBarbara,fmxptej,t1_fmxk4dm,1586469538.0,"I have friends at UCSD- i'd say quality of education seems equal at both places, but UCSB seems much more relaxed! I've heard of cut throat competition at SD, especially for STEM. 

Plus it's hard to beat SB having dorms right on the beach!

(Of course, I'm probably biased though haha)"
