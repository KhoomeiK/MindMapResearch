""Cystic fibrosis is a progressive, genetic disease that causes persistent lung infections and limits the ability to breathe over time. In people with CF, mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene cause the CFTR protein to become dysfunctional.""

runthejewels,fnx33dd,t3_g4ezzu,1587330524.0,"RTJ2 - I didnt know of RTJ until shortly after the RTJ2 drop. I remember I was at my extended families house sleeping over on Thanksgiving. I couldnt sleep so I went on youtube, saw an anthony fantano review for RTJ2 by some guys called Run the Jewels, got interested, pulled up spotify, and pressed the play button on the artist page. Now, I loved what I was hearing, but when Close Your Eyes (And Count To Fuck) started playing into my 15 year old ears for the first time... euphoria.

RTJ3 - Again, I was at a family party (I think the same familyâ€™s house) for Christmas when I got the email that they decided to drop that night. All I had was pure excitement, and I texted my cousin who equally loved RTJ if not more, and I listened to it all night long once I got home."
