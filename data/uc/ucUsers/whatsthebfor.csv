AmItheAsshole,fpl3wl2,t3_gduzz0,1588705914.0,"NTA - the next time she brings in up, ask her, ""What are you being rewarded for?"" If she says for taking the test, remind her that the deal wasn't to take the test, it was too get a specific score, ""So what are you being rewarded for?"" If she says she did her best, tell her that's not true because she would ditch her tutoring sessions and have hella attitude when she was absolutely forced to go, ""So what are you being rewarded for?"" If she says it's too be fair with her brother, say that it's actual not fair to her brother cause he clearly put in the effort and if she got a car for getting a bad score then her brother will know that he could've gotten a car regardless of his score, ""So what are you being rewarded for?"" If she says it's because her friend got one regardless of her score, say that YOUR friend didn't help his children with buying cars at all, but luckily for your daughter you don't hold your family to the standards that other parents hold their families, ""So what are you being rewarded for?"" If she pulls the sexist card again, explain that it's not sexist to hold a woman to the same standards as a man and that to offer her a handicap would imply that she, as a woman, would be less logically capable than her male counterpart when she isn't, ""So what are you being rewarded for?"" Eventually she'll admit that it's for nothing and reiterate that, while you're not gonna reward her for nothing, you still love her and are still willing to help her pay for the car she wants but only if she demonstrates that she can improve her attitude because her entitlement is extremely disrespectful."
bigboobproblems,fp6uf9s,t3_gb8pv6,1588358771.0,"While I completely understand why this makes you feel that way (and in complete honesty, I haven't had pregnancy boobs), I can kind of see why he might not have brought it up before. He was attracted to you before, and he is attracted to you now. It's not like he was obsessing over you being too small before, and I'm guessing he assumed that that is one fantasy he wouldn't get to fulfill, so why bring it up? For example, if I had a threesome fantasy but I found a partner who believed in complete monogamy and I chose that my relationship with them was more important than fulfilling my fantasy, why would I bring it up to them? Maybe once in passing like during a discussion of, ""What's a sexual fantasy you have?"" But hearing how much he adores you, I'd like to think that he wouldn't have wanted to bring up a fantasy that you previously wouldn't have been able to fulfill because he was concerned it might have made you feel self-conscious about that aspect of yourself. Now, through no intent on either of your parts, you are capable of fulfilling that fantasy. As an anecdote, I'm extremely attracted to men with long hair. My current partner started growing it his hair because I mention this to him in passing when we first started dating. I now find him more attractive than I did previously. That's not to say I didn't find him attractive in the past nor does it mean I wouldn't have been happy if he hadn't grown out his hair. In regards to your situation though, hair is easier to grow than breasts, so I can understand why he might have decided not to mention it. 

Keep in mind though that this is all my speculation. I was just hoping to shed some light on why this may have come up. Talk to him about this, and maybe ask him to refrain from (or at least tone down) complimenting you on your breasts for a while and rather focus on other aspects of your body as it's making you feel like that's all he cares about. As I said at the start, I completely understand why you might feel this way. 

Good luck. I hope you guys work through this and come out stronger in the other side. üòä"

UCSD,fnz0f1n,t3_g4nyjw,1587382286.0,"I transferred and had a falling out with my CC friend group. I'm part of a small department which is nice since everyone kinda knows everyone AND we're all mostly transfers. Most of us, myself include, are about to graduate, so we were getting all excited to be able to just chill this last quarter and share our senior projects and go drinking and whatnot. But here we are."

BDSMAdvice,fncv0ag,t3_g0rgi8,1586848135.0,"Short answer, yes, of course. Long answer, yes, but that doesn't always mean that the dynamic will work out. 

For example, a successful businesswoman may have had a long day of leading critical meetings and may just want to let go when she gets home. She's a sub, and her partner is a Dom/me, so they look forward to playing in the evening so she can unwind. 

However, the thing that causes some ifs in your post is the fact that you enjoy it ""in the bedroom."" I'm not saying that's bad. It's the same for me. But there are certain Dom/mes who want and hope to cultivate a 24/7 dynamic. Now consider the businesswoman. She might not be compatible in a 24/7 dynamic with a Dom/me who wants her to wear vibrator panties all day everyday who will turn it on whenever he feels like as it may cause issues in her professional life. That's not to say they couldn't talk it out and set boundaries, but some Dom/mes just really imagine their dream life with a 24/7 dynamic, and that's just not gonna be compatible with every sub. (And it can go both ways, of course. I couldn't be partners with a sub who wants a 24/7 dynamic.)

That being said, never sacrifice your profession, values, or personality to please a Dom/me! Good luck."
