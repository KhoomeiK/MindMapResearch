UCDavis,fpft930,t1_fpekut2,1588582646.0,"Since it‚Äôll be difficult to get any upper div ecn courses, maybe take a UWP 101 class your first quarter? It‚Äôs a general upper div GE you have to take eventually and it won‚Äôt put him that behind?"
UCDavis,fpf73lf,t1_fpf6969,1588563374.0,"I had a class in 1227 this Winter and my prof was constantly complaining about how cold it was and how she couldn't project her stuff from her laptop on the projector. She kept calling IT and things went on for weeks.  One time, she was about to start lecture and something went wrong and she just straight up just turned around and told us all we could leave lol"

UCDavis,fo4x5e3,t3_g5mn75,1587512960.0,"I think it depends on your college and major, I would meet with an adviser to see if you need to take any classes for a letter grade."
UCDavis,fo47xhi,t1_fo22zck,1587499730.0,Ya.. it‚Äôs CMN 10v so it‚Äôs been proctored since the class was created. It sucks that our contract with proctoru ended this quarter.
UCDavis,fo47ewq,t1_fo289nx,1587499476.0,"If you haven‚Äôt already, check out assist.org and find your major. It will list out all the courses you need to take to transfer! But personally I suggest taking the simple classes like Psych, Soci, English, math, history and like art history or something that to finish up your IGETC."
UCDavis,fo215p0,t3_g565a9,1587446646.0,im scared i have a midterm in a couple of weeks and my prof keeps sending us canvas emails about how examity sucks.
UCDavis,fnzxg1t,t3_g4ntgy,1587402424.0,Personally I transferred with 80+ semester units which I think equates to around 100 quarter units. My TAG was accepted and it shouldn‚Äôt be a problem because you are coming from CC. (All the classes are lower divs besides ochem I think?) I was also not a full time student during my last two semesters but I stated that I already finished all the transfer requirements.
UCDavis,fnzwz1k,t1_fnztsud,1587402192.0,"During orientation, you get out into small groups with the people in your major. At the very end after all the talks, you go into a smaller room with everyone in your major and some advisors. They go around and try to talk to you and help you figure out your schedule before your pass time."

UCDavis,fnpti7y,t3_g355di,1587151716.0,Both my roommates are Econ transfers and they seem to like their classes. A lot of the classes they took had some pretty generous curves so good luck! Grats on the admission!

UCDavis,fnmxxd1,t3_g2hrf3,1587080330.0,"I‚Äôm also a CMN major here and I transferred in last year. I transferred with my IGETC finished so I did not have to take any foreign language. The only lower div classes I had to take were Lin 1 and CMN 10v. Personally I‚Äôve been enjoying what I‚Äôve been learning so far. I have not had any straight up ‚Äúbad profs‚Äù, most of them are extremely nice and tests were pretty fair. I didn‚Äôt do as well as I hoped during Fall quarter but I believe that was because transitioning from semester to quarter was a little difficult ( I did a lot better and took more units during Winter quarter).  A lot of the class is based off testing and there is barely any HW besides reading. I would recommend trying to take profs like Hamilton for 101 and 120, and like Huskey for 140. Brunner is a nice guy but his class can get a little boring because he lectures a lot and goes through a lot of material.  Overall I really enjoyed the classes I took and am enjoying myself here!
Feel free to DM me if you have any more questions about what classes I took or like my experience as a transfer!"
