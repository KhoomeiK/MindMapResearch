ucla,foivfzn,t3_g7p818,1587798343.0,Yeah I'm also struggling to find motivation. I haven't even attended a single one of my 8am physics discussions yet lol
ApplyingToCollege,focszze,t1_foc446g,1587675442.0,"Sure, go for it :)"
ucla,fo9n9am,t1_fo9k50r,1587624620.0,"Yup. For example, right now I'm a freshman and I'm already being inducted (i.e. eligible)  for UPE and TBP. I wouldn't really consider them greek life; they would be classified as honor societies."
ucla,fo874vy,t1_fo6q831,1587591101.0,"No problem! Yes they still give ""extra"" units. The extra units don't really do anything, so I don't think they are worth paying $94. There are only 2 possible benefits, none of which are that good:

The first is if you are somehow under the unit minimum to graduate, you can use these ""extra"" AP units to meet the unit minimum. However, most engineering majors don't have this problem, since there are so many course requirements anyways.

The second possible benefit is that if you have enough extra units, you can have junior standing earlier (i.e. as a first or second year). Some engineering honor societies (like UPE or TBP) recruit a certain percentage of top GPA students with junior or senior standing. If you have junior or senior standing earlier, you can be considered for these honor societies without all the hard upper division courses lowering your GPA. Sorry if this benefit isn't clear, I'm happy to elaborate if you'd like."
ucla,fo5u9b9,t1_fo5j6be,1587535882.0,"I think this is technically the page for Samueli Engineering AP credit: [http://www.admission.ucla.edu/Prospect/APCreditEN.htm](http://www.admission.ucla.edu/Prospect/APCreditEN.htm)

However, to summarize, you basically won't get AP Credit for any courses EXCEPT:

Calc AB/BC to waive Math 31A/B (depends on score and which test)

Physics C: Mechanics to waive Physics 1A (with a score of 4-5)

AP Lang OR Lit to waive Eng Comp 3 (with a score of 4-5 on either) and Entry Level Writing req (the entry req can be waived with a 680+ on SAT English or 30+ on ACT English)

APUSH (maybe AP Gov?) for American History & Institutions requirement (score 3-5)...can also be waived with 500+ on SAT US History (technically you could also satisfy this by taking a history course as a GE, which you'll have to do anyways)"
ucla,fo5sehb,t3_g5vfi6,1587534207.0,"Calc BC is still definitely beneficial to take, since it'll let you get out of Math31A and 31B. I'd say English Lit can still help you waive Eng Comp 3 (although this is already waived if you got a 4 or 5 on AP English Lang). Physics 2 and Macroeconomics are the ones you can probably cancel."
ucla,fo2aa7i,t3_g5atq4,1587454914.0,yeah you can drop till the 10th week i think
ucla,fnjulp6,t3_g26ux3,1587007358.0,"It'd be quite hard to finish in 3 years unless you come in with a decent amount of AP Credit AND take multiple courses over 1 summer. I came in with AP Credit for basically everything they'd let me waive (i.e. Calculus 1, mechanics, english, etc.). It'll still take me 3 years and 1 quarter to graduate CS (taking 4 classes basically every quarter except only 3 classes my fall freshman quarter)"
ucla,fninma3,t3_g1zz5z,1586983124.0,"For engineering majors, I'm pretty sure only AP Calc BC will count towards requirements. The others will only be units. Units don't really do anything, so I don't think they are worth paying $94.  There are only 2 possible benefits, none of which are that good, but read on if you're interested....

ucla,fn97hfc,t3_g0a5mu,1586762135.0,"Technically the math department has always allowed P/NP classes; it's up to the individual department that your major is under as to whether P/NP counts for major requirements. If your major is math, for example, then that falls under the math department, which I believe does not allow P/NP courses this quarter to count towards major requirements. In your case, since your major is under engineering, taking math as P/NP should count towards major requirements.

TLDR: For this quarter, engineering majors can take math classes as P/NP and still have it count towards major requirements."
ucla,fmnmjen,t3_fwcxt6,1586229589.0,Yeah I definitely miss the dining hall food as well :(
ucla,fmmbp3y,t1_fmm9j1z,1586202396.0,They’ll probably remove financial aid for housing but keep any financial aid for tuition.
ucla,fmkjlmx,t3_fvu35a,1586157190.0,"I think only engineering majors (there may be a few others, but not math) are allowed to take major requirement courses as P/NP."
