UCSantaBarbara,fplz4ag,t1_fply0jc,1588722287.0,"Adding onto OP's reply, there is a good chance that Housing may just do as they did this spring and ask if continuing students would like to cancel their contracts. A lot of students would rather save the housing money, so it could open up spots for freshmen/transfers who want to live in Uni housing too."
UCSantaBarbara,fpihkez,t3_gdo7p0,1588641052.0,"In the summer sessions faqs, they said the fees would remain the same as some depts rely on these fees and stuff. So yeah. They are going to take our money even if it's online."
UCSantaBarbara,fph53io,t3_gdfz8g,1588615115.0,"Hi there. I signed up for an online SBCC class for Summer II. The units are transferable as long as the class falls under UC Transferable, but keep in mind that if we don't have a course equivalent at UCSB then it might not go through. I would be safe and try to take GEs/ classes that are listed on [Assist.org](https://Assist.org) to see what UCSB had accepted."
UCSantaBarbara,fpdsgja,t1_fpdrwh3,1588533312.0,"I think housing wants to see how many students are actually able to come back and how many students actually need housing, but I don't know for sure. It's not first come first serve from what I know because only preferences are being sent, no contracts have been signed because those don't get sent until late August to September ish. I'm not sure how they will determine who gets what, if the amount of students who can and are able to return and need housing exceeds the amount of spaces. That might be random, might be determined some way else, but Housing has stated that they hope to give answers by June 19th."
UCSantaBarbara,fpdrik7,t1_fpdrely,1588532770.0,"The pandemic has housing consolidating some buildings but also changing the rooms from triples to singles or doubles. There just isn't enough space to accommodate everyone, so housing is no longer guaranteed."
UCSantaBarbara,fpdq7r5,t1_fpcjeav,1588532027.0,"Other than location, you should consider the bathrooms and amenities (if you care for those). I would say room size too but it seems next year that most may be singles or doubles due to the pandemic."
UCSantaBarbara,fpdq1ee,t1_fpde05y,1588531926.0,"Hi there. I had some transfers send me an email stating that housing is not guaranteed this year, so if you also got that email, that is your answer. Freshmen also got this email. As to whether it's better to live off campus, that is solely up to you. There are a bunch of people subleasing or asking people to take over their leases right now on the UCSB Housing FB page. It can be cheaper and better than uni housing depending on what you find and roommates."
UCSantaBarbara,fpbcs3s,t1_fpbcgfc,1588467063.0,"Alright. So transfers generally get the undergrad apts and I have lived in Santa Ynez before. Not too bad, but not the best either imo. My contract for next year is for Sierra Madre. It's one of the newest. Most students would recommend SM or San Joaquin as top choices. The others are kind of meh according to some other students that shared with me."
UCSantaBarbara,fpb9ijb,t1_fpb7hqe,1588465008.0,Are you a incoming transfer or freshman?
UCSantaBarbara,fp919i3,t3_gc3ey7,1588410452.0,No. It's separate.
UCSantaBarbara,fp8gc54,t1_fp8ecw8,1588391579.0,"If you are saying that you filled out a preferences thing, you won't get a contract until August or september ish. The most common misconception is that the preference application= your housing contract, but it's not. They send roommates and housing placements later on in the summer before fall starts. Don't freak out lol."
UCSantaBarbara,fp7mz3l,t1_fp7mb8t,1588373702.0,"I called in and apparently I didn't get it because my award letter is full. Usually when this happens, they would award me the grant while decreasing my loans (paying them back) but they didn't do that. I asked them about that option and they said that they would look into it. Hopefully they can just do that instead. Maybe call in too and ask?"
UCSantaBarbara,fp78rhq,t3_gbpyn7,1588366100.0,I do. With refund info missing too. Not sure what is going on but I got paid my cares grant yesterday.
UCSantaBarbara,fp73syh,t3_gbp8ev,1588363533.0,Triples were removed because of the pandemic. They expect to have only doubles and singles available for certain dorms so it's not a glitch or anything.
UCSantaBarbara,fp6syp6,t3_gbjq1k,1588358058.0,"I just checked my BARC and I got "" Paid status: Unable to determine"" as well as no refund or transaction history, but I got my CARES grant like yesterday. ðŸ¤”"

UCSantaBarbara,fp3zd0j,t1_fp3pwx5,1588288668.0,Yes.
UCSantaBarbara,fozxk6y,t1_fozxi8u,1588198654.0,12 units per quarter.
UCSantaBarbara,fozxcqa,t1_fozwi9k,1588198546.0,12 units is still the minimum to be full time. Hope this helps!
UCSantaBarbara,fozmen0,t1_fozm8wv,1588193093.0,"My mom is considered an essential worker so I don't think it would count for me, but I'll be sure to spread this around to others! Thank you for letting me know!"
UCSantaBarbara,fozly0h,t1_fozlscl,1588192873.0,Oh. I see. My roommate has an efc of 0 and got only 1.1k so I wonder if other criteria had to be met too.
UCSantaBarbara,foz8bkw,t1_foz7y6v,1588186362.0,Some people got 1.1k and I am assuming that is the max amount.
UCSantaBarbara,foz7sii,t1_foz6dnf,1588186111.0,"From the information I just received on the phone, we will all get emails sent out around Friday with more information as the funding was pushed out as soon as it was, but correspondence wasn't set up or sent out during this process. They will send out their formula as well as to who qualified and why. I wasn't able to get specific information given to me, but the email should explain it. Thank you for sharing!"
UCSantaBarbara,foz66p1,t1_foz5wne,1588185349.0,"I'm not too sure about the formula since I went based on who I asked on a discord server, so that's good to know. What is your efc? And how much did you get for the cares grant?"
UCSantaBarbara,foz1a07,t1_foyzo1e,1588182955.0,"Edit: please see below. They will release it in an email soon. I was assuming that it was based off of pell grant eligibility but it doesn't seem to be the case

EFC 0- 1.1k ( that's the amount several people with this efc shared with me but idk if it can be more.)

EFC above 0- 20k (so far reported): 870-875 (apparently one person got $5 less)"
UCSantaBarbara,foyvbtq,t1_foytt1t,1588179846.0,There are very limited single rooms in dorms and they are in high demand. They are typically for RAs or those with specific housing accomodation requests.
UCSantaBarbara,foyv6pb,t1_foyb5u3,1588179770.0,"The other schools such as UC Berkeley and UCSD have announced that fall will most likely be hybrid. Continuing students have already signed contracts, so if anything, if the school doesn't keep dorms open, they will cancel all of them without penalty as they did for Spring.

Edit: Just saw that you said you were a transfer in previous post and question."
UCSantaBarbara,foyuxwn,t1_foy1c7x,1588179640.0,"Hi there. Unless you fit under certain criteria, freshman cannot live in the undergraduate apartments as those are for 3rd years and 4th years along with transfers. Financial aid covers them. You don't have to live in the dorms. You can live in IV if you want."
UCSantaBarbara,fox22nc,t1_fow810k,1588132234.0,A lot of people recommend San Joaquin or Sierra Madre as the best undergrad apts. They are the newest and nicest. I lived in Santa Ynez for summer sessions once and it wasn't too bad but my new contract is for Sierra Madre. Most undergrad apts are in doubles. The only place that has studios is Westgate but that is in high demand and Westgate is also one of the older apartments. You are better off getting a studio or single room in IV if you can find and afford one with other housemates. If you need a single in uni housing for a good reason then you can fill out a special accommodations request.
UCSantaBarbara,fowtqdt,t1_fowt3lu,1588126952.0,"I see. I think I understand a bit of their criteria and the amounts now. My roommate has an efc of 0 and she also got 1.1k. I have an efc of 2.1k so I got 875. My other friend who doesnt get any pell grants, didn't recieve it. None of us have it on BARC tho. So hopefully that comes in soon. Thank you for sharing!"
UCSantaBarbara,fowczsa,t3_g9yf3r,1588117394.0,"Hi there. I suggest calling our finaid office, but from what I know, you need at least 6 units for finaid and one class would only be 4 units so you won't get any aid. They will probably ask you to put our school into your FAFSA so that they get sent your information, but again I think it's better if you opt into the Qless line and have finaid call you for specifics."
UCSantaBarbara,fovoxxg,t3_g9ul6n,1588105012.0,Hi there! I think you will find more options on FB as many people are posting on the UCSB Housing FB page.
UCSantaBarbara,fovonnl,t1_fovc658,1588104871.0,"Take in mind that Fall will most likely be hybrid so a lot of classes will be online to accomodate those who won't be on campus such as OOS and INTL students with only a few classes in person such as labs since those are trickier to convert into a remote format.

That being said, it depends whether you want to stay in SB by yourself or stay home because some roommates may not come back or they decide to stay home. It doesn't hurt to fill it out though. I am sure that if Fall turns out hybrid that housing will send emails asking those who want to cancel their contracts to be able to do so without penalty and prospects are just sending preferences, they haven't signed contracts like continuing students yet so there isn't that extra step to cancel something that hasn't been signed."
UCSantaBarbara,fotpz1y,t3_g9j3qd,1588061987.0,"From what I understand, half of it is to help with the losses the schools faced. And half is for emergency grants, but on like higher ed news or something, they plan on using the emergency grant funding for DACA students and stuff. Not sure if any left over funding is for other students, but some schools are having people apply for it, or they have to be pell grant eligible or fit other criteria. It's really up to the schools what they do with the money and who/ how they will distribute it whether it's only to those with significant need or to every student etc."
UCSantaBarbara,foth8jn,t3_g9hi89,1588053859.0,"I came from a highschool that's like 90% Asian LOL and I had the same worries as you, but our campus is really diverse so you will be fine. I don't think you will feel out of place."
UCSantaBarbara,fosv3x9,t3_g9df4r,1588038669.0,"English is more literature based here. There aren't any or very little creative writing classes from what I have heard. The only way to do so, such as create your own classes and or take creative writing classes (like screenwriting or something) is to be accepted into CCS."
UCSantaBarbara,foovkkw,t3_g8pfym,1587947377.0,"I am a LCS major and I think our linguistics program is very good in terms of our style of approach. The professors are really good too. I have taken Ling 20 and 70 with Kennedy, Ling 50 with Bucholtz who is always in correspondence with students and she is the head department chair, Ling 127 with Barnwell, and taken Ling 131 with Anna Bax as well. I have enjoyed every class whether it was with a TA or a professor and they have been extremely accommodating.  Sam is super sweet too. She answers questions fairly quickly through email or you can drop by and ask her questions too."
UCSantaBarbara,fom1dt0,t1_fom18yd,1587875675.0,"If you are going to take summer classes at a cc, I think you will have to contact their finaid office but they probs will tell you to add them into your current fafsa so they can see give you fed aid. Other than that, Fall at UCSB still won't be affected."
UCSantaBarbara,fom03sd,t3_g87xlb,1587874725.0,No. Because fall will be based off of your 2020-2021 fafsa.
UCSantaBarbara,fokuoia,t1_fokmvbm,1587849293.0,"Hi there. From what I know, we have screen writing classes but it's for film and media studies majors so if you double major, you would be able to take those classes. Another thing is that if you are in in the CCS program as a writing and literature major (which pretty much is like English), you can meet other people and share ideas who are interested in screenwriting. My boyfriend is in CCS as a writing and lit major and is also interested in screenwriting, so I am just referencing what he shared with me. Hope this helps a bit! If you need a bit more insight, feel free to dm me and I'll ask my boyfriend to share what he knows since his interests are similar."
UCSantaBarbara,foib16b,t1_foiavgt,1587782528.0,"Oh okay. I assuming you get the max amount of pell grants, so just add the quarterly amount +1700 UCSB (that's the max amount given) and then subtract by your costs for tuition and stuff. Then whatever is left should be given to you. Hope this helps!"
UCSantaBarbara,foi3fpz,t1_foi3e6e,1587777930.0,"It's separate. Your fall scholarship won't be affected. It also will depend on your 2020-2021 fafsa (like if your efc is lower, they will reduce it to balance it out and stuff)"
UCSantaBarbara,foi2mkk,t3_g7kos8,1587777453.0,"If you are talking about summer housing provided by the university, and you are taking 12 units and qualify for the incentive, you will be covered for one session provided that it's less than 1000. Other than that, all of the aid you get typically goes to tuition and fees and without 12 units, you won't get that additional 1000. You could get your leftover UCSB scholarship though. Feel free to dm me if you want to go into specifics."
UCSantaBarbara,fogxvdj,t3_g7f9db,1587758229.0,"Honestly, I don't know either. It was true the key machine was broken at first, but then we got a new one and was making keys. However, then the manager decided that he didn't want that key machine, so he told them to take it back and get him a new/different one. Afterwards, we waited forever for this machine and I don't think it ever came. Eventually, they just told us to tell people that we weren't making keys and that someone else was doing it (which I have no idea who. Housing?) The employees were also asking about it because if students could just check their boxes, they wouldn't have to wait in line with those expecting packages to ask and employees would have more time finding packages than checking boxes."
UCSantaBarbara,fogip1u,t1_fogfx39,1587753073.0,"Thank you for posting a copy! From what I understand from the email, it seems very likely that classes will be hybrid where if we are allowed to go back on campus, a lot of us will, but remote instruction will still be offered to those who can't make it back in time (OOS/ INTL) Probably certain classes like labs will be in person if possible while the rest are remote/online. It's honestly really sad, but making those small steps."
UCSantaBarbara,fo9kp5o,t1_fo9k2si,1587622346.0,"I personally don't use time extensions but I can tell you that some of the accomodations go hand in hand. For example, if you chose a memory aid to help you with tests, you have to request a private exam setting. I feel that the time extension may fall under this category too, but someone who has requested this service can better share their experience. With fall likely being online, I think the best probable thing to do would be to enroll in services, send all instructors your DSP letter, and then email them ahead of time that you will need time extensions and that you have sent them an instructor letter informing them of DSP accomodations. Since a lot of instructors are using gauchospace to conduct tests/quizzes, they can go in and override their test for you and change things like attempts/time. I feel that most professors are accommodating as long as you let them know ahead of time and that is why they have a specific section on each of their syllabuses about special accomodations/DSP."
UCSantaBarbara,fo9j3oz,t1_fo9im8o,1587620983.0,"Hello there! I never had to fight for accomodations. In my intake, I described what I needed and the person explained to me what each thing was to make sure I got the right services. Once approved, you can access notes from notetakers, submit finals/midterms accommodation requests and everything on the DSP portal. We have DSP letters that can be sent to instructors informing them that you are enrolled in DSP (also sent through the portal). I also found that DSP responds fairly quickly to emails if any questions occur such as priority registration, need for books, new notetaking software etc. They try to keep in touch."
UCSantaBarbara,fo8cey1,t1_fo8ca95,1587593899.0,"Never had to disclose anything. It's a personal thing and even on certain surveys/applications/gov forms, they have this part where you can disclose if you have a disability or refuse to answer. They won't ask about it."
UCSantaBarbara,fo8awo8,t3_g6af4f,1587593093.0,"The process was really easy for me actually.. I was seeing a CAPS counselor and told him my diagnosis and he suggested DSP and filled out the application with me. Afterwards, I met with DSP and established services. As for employment, it hasn't affected me thus far. And it doesn't show anywhere on my transcript."
UCSantaBarbara,fo8a5rb,t1_fo836vm,1587592691.0,Yes. There is also a chart that tells you how many units something is worth and any course equivalents.

As of right now, I think the stay at home order is until May...? I think that's why they said June 15th to decide because they just want to make sure since anything can happen.  


Edit: I tried to find a date when it will end, but it seems that there is NO set date for California right now. I was pretty sure I saw a projected date of May somewhere but I think it's for the other states as most of them extended to mid May."

If there is a payment number, chances are, it has been disbursed already. If it's by check, did you change your local mailing address on GOLD ( if you moved back home) to your current address? 

If you had recently changed to direct deposit (like you had recieved checks but changed it because you moved back home) you may have put the wrong routing number/ bank acc info. You would have to call BARC somehow.

UCSantaBarbara,fmlsdxz,t1_fmls545,1586192354.0,"I suggest trying to contact the Registrar's office. I'm not too sure if the Summer Sessions can help you, they might relay the same info, but you can try them too. They have their contact info on their pages."
UCSantaBarbara,fmlrv1m,t1_fmlrkqm,1586192076.0,"For a returning student, you must submit an online application and it must be approved by the Registrar's Office (which may take 3 days). Once you get the approval email, you can log into gold and register. This information can be found on the Summer Session's website under registration information."
UCSantaBarbara,fmlo8ds,t1_fmlnyf2,1586190167.0,"Hi there! So for pass one, you can enroll into up to 16 units. But pass two allows for 24 and pass three is the college limit. This information can be found in the link I provided showing the pass times. These are for both sessions I believe."
UCSantaBarbara,fmlnuum,t1_fmlnk8a,1586189980.0,"Hi there! The course preview seems to be the initial list of classes that departments had sent in, but as the week gone by, departments had adjusted their lists along the way and may have removed some classes.Now that registration is available, the courses found on Gold should be finalized."
UCSantaBarbara,fmlmyxr,t1_fmlm15w,1586189530.0,"I am guessing that when a class is closed, an add/enrollment code is needed. There are spaces in the class, I'm guessing that students just need to ask for one. Its either that, or perhaps like you said, they might not be able to hold the labs due to the situation at hand. 
But if you see here: https://my.sa.ucsb.edu/public/curriculum/coursesearch.aspx 
And search up the chem lab, there are spaces. 
So maybe just email the professor? Sorry if I am not much help!"
UCSantaBarbara,fmllfcs,t1_fmlhy65,1586188695.0,They are offered to undergrads. I lived in Santa Ynez my freshman summer sessions.
UCSantaBarbara,fmlg1ij,t3_fw0c9n,1586185688.0,"""Summer courses are now searchable inÂ GOLD. Review the graphic below (pass times chart) to identify the date of your pass time, which will correspond with your class level based on units completed at the end of Winter 2020. At 9AM on your pass date, you will be able to create a Summer Quarter under the registration tab inÂ GOLD. After activating your Summer Quarter, you will be able to enroll in courses.Â Â ""

UCSantaBarbara,fmklimn,t1_fmkldq1,1586159162.0,How do you know this?
UCSantaBarbara,fmkjhg8,t1_fmkjcwo,1586157074.0,"I don't think they set it up to allow people to opt in yet even tho it's midnight. Maybe try in the morning?

Edited: just posted info about it."
