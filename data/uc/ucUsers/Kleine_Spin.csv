MetalMemes,fp2vtjh,t1_fp2mdv9,1588268729.0,"That's fair. Rammstein is what got me into metal, but I can totally understand why they're not appealing to some people, especially if you started out with Metallica or something. They definitely have a unique sound. Personally I'm not really a fan of most of the other mainstream bands on this sub.

A small sidenote: industrial metal bands, like Rammstein, often come from Germany. This is because there's a huge clubbing culture over there, and if you've ever been to Berlin then you know what I'm talking about. More traditional metal is not really great for that purpose."
Rammstein,fp0xx0u,t3_gaefsv,1588219436.0,"Tbh it isn't much different than my normal life.  I'm still here, locked in my room, studying the entire day, scrolling through reddit, avoiding people......"
folkmetal,foro0g7,t1_for6sx9,1588015481.0,"Agreed.  The majority of my music is also in English and German, but that doesn't stop me from listenting to folk metal in other languages.  Especially since folk metal is sung in Germanic languages for the most part, I can sometimes guess at the meaning of some words.  But as long as the instrumental arrangement is good, I don't really care what language its in."
folkmetal,fornirg,t3_g94avi,1588015236.0,"I listen to music for the music.  Good lyrics are a bonus.

What I love most about folk metal is the incorperation of folk instruments with the traditional metal instruments.  I'm sort of a nerd, so I really love the variety of cool cultural instruments, espeically traditional flutes."

learndutch,fo36rdm,t3_g5c1k7,1587481596.0,"I'm a native English speaker.  I learned German as my second language.  Knowing German as a second language is a double edged sword.  My advice is to be extremely diligent in separating the two languages in your mind, as it is very easy to start mixing them as a non native speaker.

For instance, when I'm in Germany, I don't think about Dutch at all.  When I'm in the Netherlands, I pretend that German doesn't exist."

ibs,fo1dg0w,t3_g4xisg,1587430897.0,"Cut out the dairy asap.  The proteins found in dairy products can be very irritating on your stomach.  (I know this is hard, but if I did it, then you can do it too.)  Eggs are probably fine if you want to continue with those. 

A few other tips:

Cook your vegtables.  They are not necessarily easier to digest, especially when raw.  I am quite strict about the vegtables I eat: asparagus, carrots, spinach, tomatoes, eggplant, zucchini, potatoes, and other squash, as these tend to be less rough on your stomach, as opposed to kale or cabbage for example.

Try to limit carb and sodium intake.  This isn't necessarily the issue, but I find that if my carb and sodium intakes are high, it can just worsen the bloating/pain.

Keep a journal and write down the foods that irritate you and track your macros.  This can help identify patterns on the days you feel worse.

Eat a diet lower in fat.  For me personally, if I eat a lot of fat one day, I am almost always paying for it the next day.

Keep a consistant sleep schedule.  If I don't get enough sleep, I know it will be a bad day for my digestive system.

I hope that helps.  Wishing you the best of luck.  I know this sucks, but just remember, we're all suffering too :("

MetalMemes,fnu1pjk,t1_fnssvvt,1587252835.0,"I think it has to do with two factors: 

1. most non-German speakers hear 'DU HAST! DU HAST! DU HAST MICHHH!' aggressively sung and run with it, since it's fairly easy to remember 

2. It sounds really harsh and showcases the sterotype of the ""aggressive"" German language

 tbh 'Du hast' is one of my least favorite songs by Rammstein, and yet it seems to be the only one that people recognize here in the US.  I'm just upset by this because Rammstein has so much more to offer"

intj,fnamxn2,t3_g0iful,1586800269.0,"Yeah, I (21F) had insane anxiety until a couple of years ago, but it extended way beyone emotional vulnerability.  Let me paint a picture for you:

\-I could not tell my friends how much I loved/appreciated them without choking on my words

\-I could not tell anyone that I would miss them

\-I could not tell any family memebers that I love them

\-I lied and said I was asexual for a long time so that people would not bother me about romantic interests

\-if someone, on the rare occasion, did ask me out, I freaked and did not know how to cope around them

As you can see, I was pretty fucked. I don't wish that upon anyone, but anyways, I had to learn to fix this.  My first step was saying ''I love you'' to my parents, which took a few months to get down.  I got my first boyfriend after I turned 18, about a year later.  Now I can talk to my close friends about my vulnerable emotions without feeling like I'm going to die.

That being said, I will always struggle with emotional expression/vulnerability.  But if I can learn to improve, then you can too.
