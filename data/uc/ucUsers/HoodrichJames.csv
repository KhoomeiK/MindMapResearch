Thanks!"
berkeley,fnu4zxa,t1_fntkz5s,1587254662.0,"Thank you for providing great insight. Did you complete all of Berkeley's 7 course-breadth; I have all of those classes in my plan and I'm scheduled to finish it by next Spring along with the major requirements for both econ and business. 

Also, how did you go about finding the internship? Was it a big company, paid, related to major?"

I'm debating if I should apply for Econ or Business Admin next year, do you mind me asking what your GPA and EC's were. Thanks!"
