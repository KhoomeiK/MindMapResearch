PS, I have 117 ovr, so definitely will be harder for you on the vsa and match grind. Might be better to collect the rewards on the way instead of going straight for the 96."

FUTMobile,foklf1g,t1_fokj7b4,1587844253.0,"Guess what? They're not a good team in 2020. Might be why EA doesn't give them good base cards. 81-90 is shit-mid tier at this point in the year for most players anyway, and the distribution of good cards is favorable for Milan."

When their team has the right stats, it's almost impossible to stop.

However, if you can stay on the ball long enough to take advantage of their defense not diving into tackles, you can slowly build up to a finesse goal, then you're able to keep taking the ball because auto-play can't kick off, and score more goals that way. That's the ideal scenario."
