UCSantaBarbara,fpersmr,t1_fpeiibz,1588553570.0,"not sure it's really harmed my job prospects, but it certainly hasn't helped.Overall I'd say it's not a huge barrier, but one that really shouldn't exist at this point"
UCSantaBarbara,fpei0o4,t3_gcyvek,1588547935.0,"I agree with everything you've said here and think the ""party school"" label is archaic and misleading. That said, I have had internship/job interviews in which the interviewer's immediate response to finding out that I'm a ucsb student is ""oh, that's a party school, huh?"" I think this reputation will take a long time to shake, and will be around well after we all graduate."

flask,fp2wn1d,t3_gaz9y5,1588269119.0,"for each user you could keep a list of the ids of the other users they've ""swiped right on"" (find attractive). if User A swipes right on User B, check the list of ids User B has swiped right on ... if User A is there it's a match.   


Another nice feature would be storing a list of people who have swiped left on (rejected) User A in the User A database. That way you could prevent User A from seeing people who have not interest in User A."

UCSantaBarbara,fovvndr,t3_g9rw4i,1588108316.0,"AS is super huge. It's hard to make generalizations about the org. I think the general consensus is that the senators, presidents etc are pretty annoying. But the members of the program board, qcomm, etc are awesome and put on great events."
