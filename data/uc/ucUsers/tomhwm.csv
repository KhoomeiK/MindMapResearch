wholesomememes,fpmu4ye,t3_gdagx2,1588741795.0,Not wrong though. The deepest answer to the most basic question in usually the most important topic in the field.

UCSantaBarbara,fp29gem,t1_fp1cl4w,1588257751.0,"I‚Äôve never experience something like this, but I suppose there could be some things we can do not necessarily to solve everything but at least improve the situation. Maybe students who think they‚Äôre affected can contact the professor and ask for a retest/ replacement of grade from another exam? I know it‚Äôs also very bad if someone spends 2 hours working hard for an exam and all of sudden that doesn‚Äôt count, but at least it‚Äôs better than losing points for something like that. Students should have the right to choose to keep their marks for that exam or replace it."
AirlinesManagerTycoon,fp28t0z,t3_gatrh7,1588257400.0,So do you assign those planes according to their real flight schedules as well?

AirlinesManagerTycoon,foq456f,t1_fon2xmj,1587982325.0,"I have to disagree with this. This is a game, not real life. Not every player care about earning as much ‚Äúmoney‚Äù. Some would like to build a network or just to feel like commanding an airline."
AirlinesManagerTycoon,foq3zhg,t1_fonn6vi,1587982160.0,I‚Äôm not doubting it. I‚Äôm just wondering what other factors are involved. I know it works but I don‚Äôt know why it doesn‚Äôt work on my phone. It‚Äôs not as simple as logging out and reentering.
AirlinesManagerTycoon,fonmf2p,t1_foniqa2,1587922286.0,I‚Äôm not sure about this. It works on my iPad but not on my phone.
BostonBruins,fomowvo,t1_fokag7a,1587898415.0,"Accept it, put it somewhere in the stadium but no celebration. I‚Äôm supporting this."
AirlinesManagerTycoon,foa5o6x,t3_g6gvxf,1587640207.0,"Many airlines in Asia Pacific have around 80-140
Thai Airways-80
Singapore Airlines-137
Cathay Pacific-133
Air India-127
Malaysia-81
Eva Air-82
China Airlines-88
Asians-86
Qantas-132

Major European Airlines (British Airways, Air France, Lufthansa) are much larger while the others are a lot smaller
The ones I can think of are:
KLM-115
Iberia-88
Finnair-84
Swiss International-91
TAP Portugal-87

North America:
Aeromexico-131

South America:
Avianca-103

Africa:
Ethiopian-125

Numbers are from Wikipedia so there could be some deviations."

AirlinesManagerTycoon,fnz9q5e,t3_g4s8tu,1587389539.0,"I create routes based on my personal preference, not moneyüòÇ. Longer routes usually make more money but wouldn‚Äôt make a big difference if you‚Äôre only considering European routes."
AirlinesManagerTycoon,fnz9g91,t1_fnyte2u,1587389353.0,I guess there‚Äôs a zoo near the office of the developers
ManchesterUnited,fnyqpma,t3_g4luv5,1587372073.0,I‚Äôm not a fashion guy. Maybe this would be considered a forward fashion design but those players wear it to play a game not for a walk on a stage show! How are they gonna see each other with this jersey?
ManchesterUnited,fnyqkxf,t1_fny7xh6,1587371933.0,Meh. While the letters are basically gone the Chevy logo became literally the only part that‚Äôs ‚Äúlookable‚Äù on the entire jersey.
aviation,fnyb2pc,t1_fnx6ge5,1587357994.0,But there could be many ‚Äúprivate‚Äù pilots who maybe have some missions or work for certain industries. I guess hobby pilots only fly for fun.

AirlinesManagerTycoon,fny9wls,t1_fnw5oc8,1587357094.0,"So basically you just aim for ‚Äú0 demand left‚Äù with your current carrying capacity, is that right?"
AirlinesManagerTycoon,fny5lvb,t3_g47mfq,1587353975.0,How did you get the curved bottom section? I could only use a straight line or a ‚Äúwave‚Äù of poor quality frawn by my hands.
AirlinesManagerTycoon,fnwfmi8,t3_g41cy7,1587317465.0,I can‚Äôt really understand why many people love cargo aircrafts so much. Many of my routes have like -45t left because my aircrafts carry too many of them. Especially the North America/European ones where a big part of passengers are business/first class. Is there any bonus I didn‚Äôt activate?
AirlinesManagerTycoon,fnwfa5b,t1_fnsr9up,1587317278.0,"Really depends on what kind of approach you want to take. I have 9 hubs on my ‚Äúfast mode‚Äù account: LAX, JFK, Boston, Frankfurt, Paris CDG, Barcelona, Dubai, Singapore and Shanghai Pudong. My plan for the next one is Sydney and maybe Tokyo after that. I enjoy the feeling of ‚Äúoperating‚Äù a global airline. 
Basically routes become very expensive when you have too many from one hub and hubs become very expensive as the subsidiaries run out. I‚Äôd say 4-5 hubs might be the optimal choice economically once you reach a certain level."
AirlinesManagerTycoon,fnwej4s,t3_g489fn,1587316866.0,Only know the last one. The benefit for him/her is he/she can operate routes from your hub.-
AirlinesManagerTycoon,fnw991i,t3_g47mfq,1587313959.0,Too bad this can‚Äôt go into market due to copyright limits. I did one with the Lufthansa OLD livery but it was still rejected.
AirlinesManagerTycoon,fnuzjt2,t1_fnufm2j,1587275505.0,made me laugh. Good job!
UCSantaBarbara,fkwxeuo,t1_fkwmn5z,1584610116.0,Thanks. I live in Santa Cruz which is too far from IV. I‚Äôd waste 30 min on the wayüòÇ. Anyway still appreciate your help.
