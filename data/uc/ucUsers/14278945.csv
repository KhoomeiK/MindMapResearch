What a lame, lonely piece of shit you must be. Conservative, argumentative prick. You're that type of arrogant, whiny asshole that thinks he's smart, thinks he's hot shit, when really you're just a big fucking loser. Get the fuck out of here man. You're not fooling anyone. You love arguments because you came from the ghetto and enjoy beefing people. You'll always have that same animal-like mindset, no matter how ""educated"" you get. Your supreme leader suggested we inject people with disinfectant to cure covid, so why don't you buy some lysol and chug the whole bottle?"

If you knew the type of student that I am then you would understand that I am not a stranger to high academic achievement. Even now I am getting excellent grades in online classes, and so far I have no plans of switching to P/NP. It is remaining an open option for me. 

The poster of that comment I replied to was concerned that graduate schools would not accept P/NP or it would make him a weaker applicant. I had direct contact with my graduate advisor and found that this is not the case. During my conversation with the grad advisor, we discussed how expectations cannot be as high during the pandemic because students and professors are in different environments with completely new circumstances. There's a really nice youtube video of a professor discussing all of these points, I suggest you watch that.

You seem like you don't have very good grammar/spelling. Just because you went to UCLA and graduated, when you came from the ""ghetto,"" doesn't make you better than any of us. I suggest you sit the fuck down and relax. :)"

Say hypothetically that you take P/NP this quarter, you apply for grad schools in a couple years, and they take up issue with your P/NP classes. This would make them look horrible because the pandemic was out of your hands and you didn't volunteer to do this quarter online. That would not be a university you would want to attend because it is clear that they don't have any care/understanding for the students if they expect the highest standards from students during a pandemic. The treatment of the grad department toward the students is extremely important to your grad school experience and was a big part of my research when I was looking for which schools to apply to."

ucla,fokupa0,t3_g7oopn,1587849304.0,"Some TAs are just incredible, committed and passionate to teach and help students. Others are seriously horrible and use their TAship as an ego trip and don't care for the students' success. Most of mine have been of the first category, but unfortunately some have been really bad"

A [2TB NVMe SSD](https://www.google.com/search?q=2tb+nvme&rlz=1C1CHBF_enUS894US894&oq=2tb+nvme&aqs=chrome.0.0l8.1856j0j1&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8) is about $200-300. NVMe is the fastest type of consumer storage currently available. Trust me, you overpaid. If you have lots of money/really want a mac specifically, then there's not much you could have done, but if you wanted to save money and still get a super fast/high storage pc, you could have done a lot better for less money"

ucla,fm65pxh,t1_fm3bzw8,1585786848.0,I have a 3.94 cumulative GPA and I'm a graduating senior. I don't want to hurt my GPA with online learning. It would be great for me to be able to take my last quarter p/np so all that hard work maintaining such a high GPA is not hurt due to a quarter of online learning where I'm really not sure if I'll be able to earn A's.
