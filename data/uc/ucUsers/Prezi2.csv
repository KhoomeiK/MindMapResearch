UCSantaBarbara,fpfz69d,t1_fpfpx7d,1588588965.0,"No one knows, just as much as undergrad admissions are/were a crapshoot, so too are grad school admissions. Do competitive grad schools accept more 3.5 gpa students than they do borderline 3.0 gpa students? You bet. Is one or two or even three failed classes going to sway decisions over another candidate? Probably. Where you might drop/be failing in one category of a grad school admissions criteria, make sure the other aspects are stronger. Get to know some professors, get involved in a lab or with a professor who does research that interests you, work on your personal statement, study for the GRE’s. At the end of the day, no one really knows what it takes to get into grad school because it’s not like admissions offices are publicly releasing why someone got in over someone else. Grad school admissions also really depends on what field you’re going into (non-stem vs stem) and what the job climate looks like (like whether or not more people are going back to school to get post graduate degrees). At the end of the day, yet again, on one knows. 

The worst thing that might happen is you don’t get into as many grad schools as you wanted. Also you may not get offered full ride scholarships that would decrease the amount of debt you have to take on. I don’t wanna say of this to discourage you but just realize that most grad school advice is anecdotal and has a ton of survivorship bias. If you only ask for advice on grad school apps from current grad students or professors, you’re only finding out what worked and not what didn’t work. It’s all a crapshoot man. 

TLDR; no one knows how it will affect you. No one here can give you an honest answer.

EDIT: in terms of jobs or internships, if you NP a class specifically related to the field for which you’re applying for a job or an internship, forget about getting that job or internship, it probably won’t happen. On the other hand, if you NP economics and you’re applying for an IT job, don’t even sweat it, you’re fine.

EDIT 2: I **can’t** stress this enough. Advice is always anecdotal. Advice only works for the person that is giving it. In other words, fucking go for it and see what happens, who knows if you’ll get that job/internship/grad school acceptance, just go for it mate."

politics,fooh75l,t3_g8dbut,1587938901.0,"Probably the biggest reason why farmers voted for Trump in the first place is because Trump basically promised he would deregulate the environmental protections that farmers had long seen as profit-killing and over-the-top. Chlorpyrifos is an example of this. To make a long story short, as soon as Trump’s Scott Pruit came in as head of the EPA, he overturned a re-evaluation of Chlorpyrifos in 2016 that had data from 2003-2014. Chlorpyrifos is still on trac to be banned most everywhere in a few years, but in the meantime farmers have access to an effective, albeit deadly pesticide that they can put on your oranges for pennies on the dollar."
