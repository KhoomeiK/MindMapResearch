UCSD,fp3zjvk,t1_fp3761h,1588288771.0,"There wasn't going to be a proper one no matter what. It would have been no audience, sitting and listening to speeches, not walking across the stage, and then going home."
PlayStationNow,fp0wtp2,t1_foywkmu,1588218711.0,"Days Gone is surprisingly good. I'm playing on the survival level of difficulty and every encounter is tense because you can die to anything. There are some really cool random encounters too.  Performance lags in some places though.

The story is better than most video games, I think. But I hate MGS kind of stories."

UCSD,fo1ucqr,t1_fnvlha9,1587441688.0,"I'm a staff member and I haven't heard about any layoffs or furloughs. The only staff I could think of who would get laid off are some of the food workers, but they should be in a union and therefore okay. Although some of the unions on campus are supposedly weaker than others. The people who got fucked are probably the employees of the restaurants that rent space on campus. 

If it's really bad and the state cuts the funding of the UCs and CSUs, I would guess the UC system will do the same thing they did during 2008 recession. Cut the hours of non union employees and raise tuition.

To be clear, there are probably employees of UCSD who aren't getting paid bc they have to take care of their children but don't have anymore paid time off. But supposedly you can't be fired if you can't work due to covid related issues, such as sickness or having to take care of relatives or children."

neoliberal,fnw2it2,t1_fnvmrbu,1587310114.0,"Get the Ferber book. How early you sleep train is up to you but it's so nice to go from sleeping in two hour segments to seven hours. I have friends who haven't slept in their own bed for six plus years because the baby slept better with the wife and they just never stopped. 

Happiest Baby on the Block has some nice tips for soothing babies. 

A hot water dispenser is a nice luxury for prepping bottles. 

You're going to be very very tired. Remember to still do things you enjoy. 

You can rent the hospital grade/fancy breast pumps. Your insurance might even cover it. 

When they start eating solids, do the hard work of getting them to sit still and eat different foods, or mealtime will be even more of a battle later on. 

Basically the routines your baby gets into will stay with them as they get older and become even harder to break."

neoliberal,fn33n01,t3_fyylx2,1586611993.0,I have such terrible political instincts that almost everything I've predicted has been wrong. Didn't think a black man could win the general election. Thought Obama would lose to Romney. Anyone could beat Trump. Trump's idiocy was all an act. Paul Ryan would keep Trump in line. Republicans wouldn't rally to Trump. Bernie was going to win because Bidens gaffes were too much. Sander's comments about Castro wouldn't hurt him in Florida.
