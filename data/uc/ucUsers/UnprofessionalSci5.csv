badlinguistics,fny1xfi,t1_fnxspt7,1587351431.0,">On the other hand, when I had a student of Indian heritage in one of my classes with the last name of Ubhayakar, he looked at me like I was a complete idiot when I pronounced it exactly as one would in India. The correct pronunciation rhymes with “ooh, buy a car.” His puzzled response to me, however, was “do you mean Ubhayakar?” (rhyming with “you baker”). As they say in Sanskrit, “wtf?”

I think the ""ooh, buy a car"" pronunciation is legitimately incorrect, though I might be wrong. This is my reasoning:

Ubhayakar is a transliteration which is based on the spelling of the Hindi word. You can also find the transliteration Ubhaykar, without an a, which seems to be in variation with Ubhayakar. Here --> https://muzikopedia.blogspot.com/2018/08/swaradhish-dr-bharat-mohan-balvalli.html <--, both transliterations are used to refer to the same person. Rajat Ubhaykar --> https://www.hindustantimes.com/travel/truck-tales-rajat-ubhaykar-s-travelogue-records-his-unique-on-road-experiences/story-70gMnvHeGjf1MuYNmDtnvK.html <-- also goes by Rajat Ubhay**a**kar --> https://fountainink.in/author/247 <--.

Why do I bring this up? According to this video --> [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAQFA3n1jN4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAQFA3n1jN4) <-- Ubhaykar is not pronounced like ""ooh, buy a car"". At least to me, it is pronounced like it rhymes with ""ooh biker"" or even ""you baker"". Both of the people in this video are native Indians.

But then again, it's entirely possible that I'm wrong, and I would like a second opinion."
