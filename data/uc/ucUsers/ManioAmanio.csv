UCSD,fpm36if,t1_fpm1lcn,1588724622.0,I mean if they put classes online probably fall y’all Is hitting the dirt too
UCSD,fpj908t,t1_fpima44,1588660271.0,"Agreed but something that I want to point out is when people have a problem, they tend to bring a reason for it, which may not be correct. For example if I say there is no parties in this school, that’s because people are socially inept, it’s an absolute false statement. La Jolla not supporting a Greek row, no football team or d1 sports, the college system with strict dorm rules, are a main contributor to this situation.And parties do exist but less accessible and you gotta look for them. this goes hand in hand with a lot of other REAL issues that people have and they bring a reason for it that isn’t remotely close to reality, therefore putting a false assumption in outsiders or even students heads."
UCSD,fpiaiyd,t3_gdkhgj,1588636946.0,"I personally believe nobody should judge a school just by someone’s experience on reddit, because it’s just a statement from someone you don’t know without context, could be true and false. I have a lot of fun at this school but that doesn’t mean you’re gonna have fun, or just because I have hard time doesn’t mean you, but somethings are set it stone, you’re not gonna find tailgates or football games around here and a lot of social stuff is limited here, and school is hard. But all the personalized information shouldn’t affect the way you look at the school."
UCSD,fpfi2pc,t1_fpegu1h,1588571893.0,"Agreed, OPs version is totally unacceptable, I’m a minority and if anyone tells me to go back to my country eventhough I’m Born in sandiego, they boutta catch these hands(jk). But I’ve witnessed a lot of people Blame their social shortcomings on racism, and I just think that’s BS. I have a huge friend group of every ethnicity and have been active on the academic scene with a lot of different minorities, never had a single problem with my race, I doubt many others have either."
UCSD,fpfhrqd,t1_fpdwpqo,1588571628.0,"Not really man(minority here) some people were unfortunate enough to experience it like OP, OP’s Version is blatant and unacceptable. But if you have a hard time making connections,friends,grades etc. I 100% assure you it’s not your skin color"
UCSD,fpejed5,t1_fpefixp,1588548700.0,"Not once as a minority I have witnessed racism from the people here(i don’t think maybe 500 ppl from my ethnicity are here)it’s a good scapegoat for some, blame their shortcomings on race and other people"
UCSD,fpeak7d,t1_fpe7r95,1588543664.0,"In my 2 years here I have had 3 Latino professors 1 jn econ 1 in physics 1 in math and 1 black professor in psych. And 2 TA’s in CAT and Physics which where Latino. I’m sure if you’re looking for Same race profs/Ta you could find them. And How is assuming you having a sub ideal attitude a racist stereotype I don’t get it, you’re literally calling me a racist because I suggested maybe you should look at this at a different perspective and maybe if people don’t vibe with you in those Specific clubs is not because of the race is because of characteristic incompatibilities, and somehow race is tied into this. And I’m not brown Asian not that it really matters, I’m just a mix brown"
UCSD,fpe5voi,t1_fpdu4ne,1588540971.0,"As a brown boi I disagree, I totally get the international vibe, international TAs don’t really want to help you either, they’re just tas because they have to be TA’s ( this is a massive generalization, I’m sure some of y’all are absolutely amazing) but regarding profs, you rarely find people who are biased by race, maybe it’s our own attitude that drives people off, And blame it on the skin color, but normally I don’t think TA’s are discriminative, it’s more natural to get closer with people with the same culture/experiences/interests, most of my friends here and the research I work in are white and Latino and I’m brown so yeah"
UCSD,fp7emqf,t1_fp71zzz,1588369190.0,That’s fuxking retarded
UCSD,fp6og8d,t1_fp67a6v,1588355835.0,"In the assignment misconduct part it literally wrote copying homework from an online source, I think chegg would be contract cheating if you do it on an. Exam"
UCSD,fp5dh94,t1_fp5dcid,1588325274.0,"I mean it’s your first time + assignment misconduct and it’s less than 20% and you’re a senior so something there and that’s it, there is no chegg section , write that in your appeal. Im pretty sure you’ll be in on probation maximum. How did they want to kick you out for a year makes no sense, and admitting doesn’t decrease the time, at least it’s not written anywhere"
UCSD,fp5d8vi,t1_fp5ag9r,1588325025.0,"How much was the percentage of the homework, it doesn’t add up at all you shouldn’t be suspended"

UCSD,fp06quy,t1_fp05rn7,1588203529.0,"Quarter system is pretty bad imo, Less internship opportunities, less time to learn shit, if you screw up 1 midterm you’re basically done and all the other stuff that comes with it"

UCSD,fozs1fr,t1_fozld2a,1588195859.0,"I mean it is expected, but that doesn’t give them the right to fuckin announce that we are the best fuck you all give us the same amount of Money"
UCSD,foxnsns,t3_ga4thh,1588150007.0,"Nah ucsd will keep providing top education apparently, I’m legit starting to slip because the classes are so poorly implemented, exams feel whack and ... god knows how many kids cheat and make the curve go to shit"
UCSD,fow0e3d,t1_fovrnz8,1588110719.0,"Like what are you gonna do with physics labs, are we supposed to look at the TA doing the experiment? Or half of us go to class or the other half doesn’t, I’m stem so I have literally no clue what’s gonna happen to the singing dancing acting .... classes which needs Live performance things, it’s gonna be a nightmare for the profs, apart from that none of the infrastructure and logistics have been discussed. My simple question is, “how are we going to do this exactly” saying both online and offline is easier said than done. Profs gonna have a hard time so us students are gonna have a hard time"

UCSD,fohwkfn,t1_fohvnn4,1587774034.0,"Depends on the department, for example, physics doesn’t let people try to switch after the end of their second year"
UCSD,fo715f9,t1_fo6e0jf,1587570413.0,"The instruction isn’t messy, getting all this right is harder than the midterm itself. Instead of making it more streamlined in this time, they just made it 10x harder to even start"
UCSD,fnyipf2,t1_fnyf4ae,1587364317.0,"I mean if you don’t get a good grade at least you know it’s your grade, I played music all my life so I enjoyed making the track. It’s a 6 unit class after all"
UCSD,fnyf005,t1_fnyag65,1587361145.0,"Yeah cat 3 last year, I mean I was in the music class(Bigham) and none of my teammates had any musical background so I wrote and recorded our track, I didn’t want to not get an A just because I had less than ideal teammates so I did it all myself, I don’t really see a point in telling the TA my teammates aren’t good, it’s a very entitled point of view imo🤷‍♂️"
UCSD,fnyae1q,t3_g4ksu7,1587357464.0,"I did all myself at it was a blast, got an A for the team basically. But I dont mind that"

UCSD,fnnz5vk,t1_fnntwbq,1587106389.0,"It’s not that it’s not fair to them and more like they can’t not teach proper material until everyone is added, week 3 is like 30% of the class and if you haven’t gone to class, you’ll get fucked, Idk if the professor has a say at all in whether or not you join the class, and we can’t really expect that the prof not take quizzes homework etc until 4 weeks in."
