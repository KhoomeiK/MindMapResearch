berkeley,foe72y4,t1_fo9qh4u,1587697344.0,"I feel that. I was in a similar situation and luckily it got better but I can't imagine that I could've taken it much longer. 

I really hope things get better at home for you. I'm around if you ever want to talk."
berkeley,foe6sv9,t1_foa16sg,1587697180.0,"I wish I could help! I can barely deal with it myself. I'm hoping that something will click during dead week. 

I'm here if you or anyone else in the thread wants to vent or just have supportive conversations."
berkeley,foe6hyc,t1_fo9r2ez,1587697005.0,"I stopped even attending lectures because the professor kept saying I wish you would all come out of hiding and show your faces - not in a mean way, just because he feels weird talking to a bunch of names... it was giving me anxiety like idk why. 

And my sleep got so messed up, new bedtime was 4am so there was no way I was gonna wake up for AM lecture.

At least you are familiar with the concepts. I mean that's a start!"
berkeley,fo9b4aq,t1_fo97ycm,1587614840.0,"Idk that there is such a thing as ""getting back to normal"" anymore. Things seem kind of pointless right now. 

Are you planning to keep the P/NP? I think part of my stress is still wanting to take my classes for letter grades, which means I'm aiming for As but damn that feels impossible right now. I think if we just accepted P/NP then we could let go of some of this anxiety.

I hope you are practicing self-care!"
berkeley,fo8xm7w,t1_fo8utk6,1587605991.0,Awesome! My SO loves sci-fi and is always looking for suggestions and encouraging me to read it too. :)
berkeley,fo8u3sb,t1_fo7xf5e,1587603869.0,"Thank you.
I guess it’s just every semester at Cal I’ve had a personal crises (mental health, family) that has made it difficult. This semester I was finally free if that and then this happens. 
But you’re right, I’m going to push through to the end and then take a breath!"
berkeley,fo8tuj5,t1_fo7zrye,1587603718.0,"Thank you for being so validating! 

I thought I would enjoy not making a long commute to campus or fighting for parking! But I miss being around everyone and seeing my friends. I have been spending time doing things I enjoy but the desire to do well in my classes is still very real.

Btw are there any sci-fi books you recommend?"
berkeley,fo8then,t3_g5p4ds,1587603503.0,Yep. Ask about it! Ask your college advisors or talk to Andrew Henry or Steven Nguyen at the Transfer Student Center for more details!
berkeley,fo7u2dt,t1_fo5e0yw,1587584552.0,Transfers get a fifth semester but no one talks about it
berkeley,fo763es,t3_g5ovz0,1587572894.0,Is there a lab?

exmormon,fo5fqv4,t3_g5q2yd,1587524562.0,Bipolar or narcissistic personality disorder have always been on my list for him.
keto,fo4u7lz,t3_g5ck1s,1587511299.0,"I felt this post. You know what helped me? I reclaimed the word fat. It can't be used against me as an insult because all it does is simply describe my outward appearance, it's simply an adjective. I am fat. I am also a brunette, I am also brown skinned. Can't insult me with the truth lol I'm even a bitch at times too! 

Your body is beautiful not because of how it looks but because of what you choose to do with it! You are saving lives, putting yourself at risk caring for people who mistreat you, you use it allows you to walk, to hug, to cure, to nurture...

I used to hate my fat flabby arms, and now I love them because I use them to hug my husband, my dogs, and my friends. 

sending you virtual hugs"
berkeley,fo4t3zb,t3_g5bt0f,1587510685.0,"I was 4am to 11am up until last week when I decided to get back to a more reasonable sleep schedule - 2 am to 9 am which is close to my normal. 

IDK how anyone is keeping a normal sleep routine right now, but if any of you are please share your tips because poor sleep hygiene is no bueno."
berkeley,fnt5uxh,t3_g3iriw,1587235198.0,"Remember that your worth cannot be measured by your grades or the school you attend. Your hard work is not invalidated simply because you did not get into UCB. And it's not that UCB doesn't recognize your hard work, sometimes admissions decisions are just not fair and depending on the major you applied for it can be even harder. But you have other UCs that not only recognized your hard work but want you to be part of their community. UCs are all great institutions and you will be pushed to the max at any one of them. Regardless of where you decide to go, you will have a bright future not because of where you go to school but because you are obviously a dedicated and hardworking person who has overcome so much."
