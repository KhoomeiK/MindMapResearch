UCSD,fpg8xcj,t1_fpdwpqo,1588597422.0,"Hey there, asian brown minority here. Been at UCSD for 2 years and haven't experienced any overt racism myself nor have the people I know here (i don't have a large circle of friends so thats not an effective sample size, but still its somethingü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è) . What happened to OP sucked big time and makes me mad and sad. I hope OP reported what happened to admin because that kind of shit is unnacceptable. The school has ~40,000 students and most of us, I'd like to believe, are kind and welcoming if approprached... maybe a bit aloof and awkward (im looking at you cog sci students) at times but in general good folk. Some students are bound to be racist though but if they make themselves and their racism known you'll have people (me included) who have your back who won't stand for their shit! I hope this helps to change your perspective a little bit coming into UCSD."
UCSD,fpg6kt3,t1_fpevn2g,1588595668.0,"What do you mean by intellectuality and life of mind? 

I think I understood a little bit when you mention ""a lack of intellectuality"". I transferred to UCSD from another UC and that was definitely a contributing factor to why I came here - a search for a challenge and hope in finding people who were as nerdy/excited about my major like me.

In my experience at my previous institution I felt like a lot of the students i spoke with in my major weren't really interested or as caring about the topics and not many of the people i met read for fun or do something to better themselves in that regard. Coming to UCSD i definitely felt intellectually stimulated and challenged for sure, and I love it here (even if this school is less socially friendly compared to my last school) 

However, after experiencing the education and meeting the students here I feel like it's hard to say definitively whether it was the school itself and its student body that is the reason why I felt this increase in intellectuality. I say this because my friends and acquaintances who were in my year or graduated back at my old UC are all waaay more involved and intellectually developed now compared to when we were all freshman, and they are all pretty interested with their studies and projects. In otherwords, maybe the age and priorities people have in their first years of college could explain the their behavior and interests. A third year student seems more likely to be more invested than a freshman in their study. I don't know, maybe it was self fulfilling prophecy that I found what I was looking for when I was desperately searching.  

It's 5 am for me and i am losing my trail of thought, and I was writing this just cuz i wanted some clarification. I hope you find a community that makes you happy and where you feel like you are growing."
UCSD,fpfzauo,t3_gd4z4g,1588589098.0,"Theres a class in PSYC called positive psychology and its about studying happiness. I forgot the course code, but I wish I was able to take it before graduating soon."
UCSD,fpfa83y,t1_fpe4wdn,1588565584.0,"Yea! I'm going to apply to food and service jobs. I realized if i only go for jobs in my major, I'll probably not hear back quick enough. Thanks for the advice! I wouldn't mind working at costco. Im sure they get an employee discount and maybe hazard pay now."
UCSD,fpdsg7l,t1_fpdrgru,1588533306.0,"Thanks for the info! I'll apply for Costco and check out unemployment. I'm sorry about your own struggle with unemployment, and I hope you can find a job you like soon. My entire immediate family lost their jobs and is on unemployment and I've had friends and aquaintances work odd jobs for months before hearing back for an interview, so i understand your struggle! Good luck to you and your own search for a career! üí™"
UCSD,fpdrjb2,t1_fpcappm,1588532782.0,Thanks for the feedback! I appreciate the blunt response. I also feel that the most realistic option I have right now is to just go home and keep trying.
UCSD,fpdr9e7,t1_fpcd4c2,1588532623.0,Thanks for the feedback! I really appreciate your perspective. I think realistically if I don't get any interview offers by this week im just gonna have to pack my bags and go home.
UCSD,fpdqvbb,t1_fpcflka,1588532400.0,"I didn't even consider subleasing. I'll look into this further. My future housemates are going through similar situations with their finances and one of them said they could no longer stay with us, and others are uncertain aswell, so subleasing for myself might be optimal for summer and later. Thanks for the feedback!"
UCSD,fpdqdkx,t1_fpcmwy3,1588532120.0,"Thanks for the feedback! Yea, I'll apply to food services and other places to help get through this time."
UCSD,fpdq613,t1_fpck7o2,1588531999.0,I'll have to look into this. Thank you for the advice.
UCSD,fpdq0rg,t1_fpcdka6,1588531915.0,"Thanks for the feedback! I've been thinking about applying to grocery stores and I think I may apply to Ralph's and other places. I'll fill out some apps. 

I thought unemployment was for the previously employed? I was set to start training in April but it got cancelled in March during spring break. And my last job I had ended in January."
UCSD,fpc9mjy,t3_g92od5,1588492387.0,"Im sorry for your experienceüò•. I can relate.
I feel like I've been beaten and bruised this quarter while my brain has been in vacation mode which makes it really hard to concentrate and even feel motivated to work hard. I really want to go to grad school, but honestly, i don't care what grades i get as long as i pass all my classes this quarter. I just want to survive."
uglyduckling,fp3k3wx,t3_galw1s,1588280699.0,8 yr old you reminded me of Mac's mom in Its Always Sunny in Philadelphia üòÇ. You look good at 31!
hajimenoippo,fp1hrah,t3_gaqkv2,1588235954.0,"Yea, he could also visit his old buddy Vorg in the states. They might even spar and talk about what they've been up to and the recent match even. Definitely could imagine that."
UCSD,fozydfy,t3_ga51dc,1588199079.0,"I thought it wasn't too bad, I scored average. I don't like the homework component to the class. It costs us and it seems like we wouldn't normally be assigned this much work if the class was offered normally. Prof is nice tho. The exam and the homework should chill a bit."
UCSD,fozvlxa,t1_fooypo3,1588197651.0,Nice! Im impressed by your ability and grit in your ability to save for years. I'm glad to hear that you'll be alright after graduating for a while. And maybe use the down time to study for the GRE? Or whatever exams needed for your field. Good luck and thanks for sharing!
UCSD,foitnqr,t3_g7otyk,1587796647.0,"Congrats! Transfer students dont typically have alot of GEs since those are done in the frist two years. You might have a couple of upper div GEs though i doubt revelle has any. Try looking up a two year courseplan for revelle transfers with psyc. If you are a transfer the college you are in doesn't really impact your major. 

Im also a transfer and a psyc major"
UCSD,fo7wx81,t1_fo7ex5u,1587585950.0,Thanks for the advice!üòä
UCSD,fo66mr7,t1_fo5tlr4,1587548490.0,That's sounds really exciting! I'd need a company to pay for my relocation if i were to search for jobs past san Diego. Thanks for sharing! This gives me an idea; Im gonna broaden up my search to companies in other cities that pay for relocation.
UCSD,fo66bvx,t1_fo60l6f,1587548157.0,Was not my intention to cause any stressüòÖ. Sorry. I'm with ya though finding relevant work in this climate is gonna be challenging.
UCSD,fo5p3t8,t1_fo5b6ko,1587531436.0,"I'm sorry about your summer plans. What kind of work are you looking for in Seattle? I'm considering leaving California too eventually for either Portland, Oregon or Seattle."
UCSD,fo5ot9z,t1_fo56zy7,1587531203.0,I'm in a similar situation. I want to stay in SD after graduating but I havent heard back from any of the companies i applied to. Feels like i may have to stay home until the economy picks up
UCSD,fo5okpp,t1_fo4r7qk,1587531012.0,"Nice! Congrats and are you doing a job related to poli sci? Im currently on the job hunt myself, but my long term goals would be to go to graduate school."
UCSD,fo5oe7a,t1_fo4tsny,1587530867.0,"Congratulations! I'm envious that you found a job in SD. Thats my goal for now, I have 2 months left to find a job to stay in SD."
UCSD,fn0kiv3,t1_fn0k943,1586543620.0,"Yea, you're right. Ugh, my back is getting smaller, but its for the greater good i suppose."
UCSD,fn0ic57,t1_fn0i5j2,1586542473.0,Thats what i thought too. I moved my car to a V spot on campus since then and no issues thus far.
UCSD,fn0954d,t1_fmyzxbe,1586537673.0,No you'll need a permit. I bought a d pass and got a courtesy notice for parking on an s spot :(
