At the very least he's being unsportsmanlike, this is not an acceptable element of sportsmanship in competitive games."

photocritique,fmr9cdq,t3_fwtlmo,1586317000.0,"I like the color scheme, the flowers look very gentle. 

One constructive criticism I'd give is that the perspective is a bit uneven. It would be better if the original shot was taken more centered, or if you do a perspective edit (e.g. in photoshop or on a phone app)"
