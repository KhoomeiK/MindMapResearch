I documented case after case of ethical abuse of power and have also taken the time out of my day to reach out to the FOP members and gotten no response from their official emails. I also went to the official posted office hours of Bryce Lindsey and he did not show up or respond to his emails. I've taken my time to hear both sides.

If you want to engage on the basis of fact and logic, I've done more than enough reading to keep discussing this. You can't claim 'these people on r/uci don't know what they're talking about' and then not provide your own proof for your own reasoning."
UCI,fnj248f,t1_fnimaj5,1586990536.0,"Once again, I don't like what ASUCI has done and there's need for improvement, which is why this year is a great opportunity for postive change. I don't want to trust r/uci groupthink either, so PLEASE read up on the situation then! Trust me, **the more you read, the more insane this shit gets**. From my reading of legislation, visiting senator office hours, and lots of emailing around, here's a quick recap of *some* of their shenanigans:

&#x200B;

\- Kimo Gandall lost his election seat, but ran the slate 'Friends of Petr' promising a new parking structure and a longer spring break. (can't find an online source, but i remember their campaign)

\- His friends in Senate created him a new position (senate parlimentarian), and provided a pay of $40/hr. (This is hidden in their '2020 Democracy First Act' [B55-08](https://www.asuci.uci.edu/senate/legislation/print/?legislation_number=B55-08))

\- His friends in senate hired Kimo and gave him 4 months of backpay out of student funds. ([R55-36](https://www.asuci.uci.edu/senate/legislation/print/?legislation_number=R55-36))

\- Kimo wrote a memo accusing the President of misconduct (which is supposed to be done by the SAG, not an unnoficial 'parlimentarian' who was never voted in. ([memo](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jz33TVIdLubCDs7m_06q3o-xPoNBflLg/view?usp=sharing)) 

\- Partially based off the memo, Senate impeached Randy Yan. Through this, Senate violated student privacy, FERPA, as well as the UCOP Sexual Violence reporting policy. Senate took investigative authority for themselves (which, again, is for the SAG and OEOD to investigate).

\- They shut down a full room of public comment after 4 people spoke and called the police on the rest citing an 'urgent need to proceed', even though the misconduct they were referencing had been in discussion for three months. There was no reason to cut that meeting short. ([meeting minutes](https://www.asuci.uci.edu/senate/minutes/print/?date=February%2027,%202020), [R55-47 Impeachment](https://www.asuci.uci.edu/senate/legislation/print/?legislation_number=R55-47))

\- They were found guilty of a bunch of shit per the [New U Article](https://www.newuniversity.org/2020/03/11/asuci-senate-members-accused-of-misconduct/)

\- Once they were recalled, they stalled the recall legislation to avoid having accountability ([Meeting minutes](https://www.asuci.uci.edu/senate/minutes/print/?date=March%2012,%202020), see Section 7.1). So effectively they're shutting down student voices who want them gone. Their new constitution also would keep them from being recalled again ([New U Article](https://www.newuniversity.org/2020/04/06/the-new-constitution-will-make-it-impossible-to-recall-the-senate-dont-vote-for-it/)).. 

&#x200B;

So to recap, you're arguing:

**If this is what it takes to get things done, so be it**. Friend of Petr did not succeed in their campaign goals from last year except for wasting student money on their friends. They funded a big money bill, but failed to even negotiate with anyone how they want that money spent! They're giving $35,000 to ICS Student Council and $35,000 to Engineering Student council. Friends of mine on *both these orgs* confirmed they never asked for the money/don't know what to do with it! That's not what *'getting things done'* means. How are we supposed to trust them to be better this year?

**It's not that bad.** Leveraging sexual misconduct and maladministration allegations to fight for your own agenda is frankly disgusting. Further, hiring your own friends and paying a *student* $40/hr is not fair for the student workers making minimum wage. Finally, corruption in any form is bad, and the shit I've seen these fuckers pull is far worse than the usual ASUCI shit (which i've also heard a lot about).

&#x200B;

TL; DR: I don't think they're even effective at getting things done regardless. Even then, I don't want these people who the students already recalled to get away with their actions."
UCI,fnikkp7,t3_g1wioq,1586981608.0,"I’m an engineering student as well, so I can hear what you’re saying about having some action with ASUCI funds... But the issue is that they did it by lying and cheating and trying to rig a system to their own gain. It doesn’t represent our best, and doesn’t represent our student body. These same people who claim to be for ‘action’ have stood in the way of countless ASUCI people trying to actually get things done and use senate rules to silence people, stall them, and overall make the student government LESS effective.

Do I want more engineering resources? YES! Do I want it to happen through lying and corruption? HELL NO. We deserve better."
UCI,fngchy7,t1_fngax0j,1586928110.0,Does ASUCI count as 'political content' under those guidelines? I think we should either refer that to UCI Student Conduct [https://aisc.uci.edu/resources/reporting.php](https://aisc.uci.edu/resources/reporting.php)... Or a formal complaint to ASUCI Election commission... Thoughts?
