ucla,fosn2f4,t3_g9cfrw,1588033967.0,"I was just asking my 170A professor during office hours if the grading scheme can be more forgiving (or rather she propose one that is more lenient) since the math department does not allow p/np. She was actually under the impression that the department allows p/np for major impacted courses and I told her nope.

I actually love all my professors this quarter. So passionate, helpful, and accommodating. But really, with me living thousands of miles away from my family and having to keep my grades up despite everything going on and also having to move because my living situation changed recently, I wanna jump off this new apartment. It reminds me how much I took the copious study spaces and snacks available at the Study until 2am and all the other good stuff for granted. Since summer is online and possibly fall as well, I wish that the policy changes mid quarter and I can be less stressed about my GPA plummeting."

ucla,fnj2kh1,t3_g229oj,1586990773.0,"the regular testing protocol is: CAPS has their own testing system(consists of a computer test for your reaction and prolonged attention to stimuli and two surveys for you and your parents reports regarding your childhood behavioral pattern) but many personnel (my psychiatrist included) consider it flawed. If you request a referral at a clinic you can get away with getting a much more meticulous test for much cheaper than otherwise (for me, I only paid $5 copay and got a more reliable diagnosis)

ucla,fn5k7xg,t3_fzpo51,1586667125.0,"*reads through your previous posts and comments*

So, because we donâ€™t believe in this Naomi person running for office (idk if i have the facts correct, idk if i even care about it lol) and we are against giving USAC $45 per person (rightfully, btw; lack of transparency with use of funds, accusations of questionable use of stipends etc.), you unilaterally decided that we are racist?

Did some higher up in USAC instruct people to make random accounts to post dumb shit like this? How dumb does USAC think we are? Iâ€™m legit shook someone help me out here lol I think you guys should just review your methods of damage control."

ucla,fmc7dam,t3_fue1mx,1585940276.0,"During lectures, a lot of my professors mentioned that the administration instructed them to give the students as rigorous of a curriculum as possible as the quarter is held online. My guess is they donâ€™t want coronavirus affecting the academic challenge a student would face at UCLA"
