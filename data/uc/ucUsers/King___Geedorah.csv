COVID19,fpittc0,t1_fpgcvq2,1588648564.0,"R_0 is a constant - it is the rate that the disease spreads in a completely susceptible population. R_effective is what changes with infection rates. It's a very  common mix up, just wanted to help out."
hiphopheads,foztfqu,t3_gaa3zt,1588196553.0,Why apple music link :(
Dodgers,fozta1l,t3_gacwkp,1588196474.0,The smooth jazz in the background kinda kills the vibe.
ucla,foz8h2m,t3_gae6h2,1588186435.0,hard agree
CoronavirusCA,fovzl8b,t1_fovxf94,1588110311.0,"Same dude, never thought I would miss school this much."
COVID19,fo813ee,t1_fo71tva,1587588031.0,"There's other factors that lead to South Korea handling it so well, built in emergency response due to them bordering North Korea, experience with 2002 SARS etc."
COVID19,fo80uj5,t1_fo73sr1,1587587906.0,I thought the 'reinfections' were actually thought to be reactivations?
COVID19,fo80t8s,t1_fo7pboj,1587587887.0,Can you be more specific?
Coronavirus,fo4dvev,t1_fo2u8im,1587502656.0,I didn't disagree with any of those points.
Coronavirus,fo2j6q0,t1_fo1jhcg,1587464451.0,I thought the US didn't even come close to running out of vents?
COVID19,fo14fz6,t1_fo0rv65,1587425542.0,"I'm in the same boat, this lockdown has been devastating for my professional career (Fortunately I have a safety net so I don't have to worry about paying rent) so I would like things to return back to normal as soon as it's safe. It feels like alot more of these reports are coming out saying that the disease is more contagious and less deadly than we thought a month ago. I'm not as hopeful for treatments because I feel like they will have to go through months of testing and will have to be manufactured at a rate which will have to keep up with basically infinite demand."
Coronavirus,fo0zsek,t1_fo03cwz,1587422907.0,I believe the few infant deaths are because the mother has COVID which causes premature births
Coronavirus,fo0cn84,t1_fnzp5il,1587410402.0,"If anything a lack of testing makes the mortality rate worse... The numerator (deaths) are hard to miscount, a lack of testing would just make the denominator smaller. I haven't seen evidence that deaths are *grossly* underreported, feel free to correct me on that."
Coronavirus,fnx7wj6,t1_fnwe6tg,1587333235.0,"Yeah, the results can be so easily influenced by the phrasing of the yes/no question. For example ""Should we ban people from going to grocery stores?"" vs ""Would banning people from grocery stores slow the spread of coronavirus?"""
Coronavirus,fnx7nt2,t1_fnwzc0k,1587333095.0,/r/covid19 has much more active mods and posts are limited to academic papers iirc.
CoronavirusWA,fnv8qg7,t1_fnv08ni,1587284172.0,"Yeah, but increasing government power is a double edged sword. The fear and confusion caused by 9/11 had many Americans support the war on Iraq and the Patriot Act - two things that I think most Americans now regret. I understand that the virus is dangerous and people are dying, but I think it's important to be wary of the long term repercussions of increasing federal power in exchange for peace of mind now.


I don't want you to feel like im attacking you, I'm just venting really."
Coronavirus,fntu1o5,t1_fntnqr4,1587248606.0,I am in favor of voluntary lockdowns. Not in favor of expanding government powers to prevent it.
Coronavirus,fntfo14,t1_fntcet6,1587240704.0,Or they're working from home comfortably
Coronavirus,fntf1of,t1_fnszh2j,1587240350.0,Between 99 and 99.7% of people survive the virus.
EngineeringStudents,fnqvr36,t1_fnpgjyx,1587173299.0,People on reddit are sensitve nerds lol.
Coronavirus,fnmsq12,t1_fnms5b9,1587077433.0,"If anything the past month has taught me, its not to make sweeping predictions about the future. Organizers of Coachella  and other events have direct communication with policy makers and I'm sure they've been consulting experts to pick that date. However I definitely see a future where it gets postponed further."
Coronavirus,fnmsjz1,t1_fnmrawj,1587077341.0,"Yes, but what portion of people under 49 are on ventalators, I think that's a much more useful statistic. There are more people under 49 etc. Additionally, what portion of that population is say 40-49?"
Coronavirus,fnmrt6n,t1_fnm7zz7,1587076935.0,Idk I stopped trusting all the pessimistic opinions in this sub as the current situation is much better than predictions from a few weeks ago.
COVID19,fnmrfwz,t3_g2czc4,1587076737.0,"Is it wrong to look at this as good news? Closer to herd immunity, less deadly than current figures etc."
Coronavirus,fnmr7lf,t1_fnlahef,1587076613.0,"At-risk groups will have to be very concerned about the virus until a vaccine is developed or a serious treatment is discoved. However every day new evidence is appearing that COVID is really not much of a threat to relatively healthy young-middle aged people, meaning that parts of the population can return to a state of near normalcy. I understand that young healthy people will still have to be cautious of infecting at-risk groups."
Coronavirus,fnmqwni,t1_fnm4s2n,1587076448.0,"I'm trying to follow the money to determine when things are going to become more normal. Event organizers have the most vested interest in predicting the time when things are most likely to be less restricted. For example Coachella has been rescheduled for the second week of October, which means I think its a decent barometer of when bigger events will start to happen again."
Coronavirus,fnmqhnh,t1_fnm6al3,1587076225.0,Yeah a few aspects of air travel changed and attitudes towards politics but life day-to-day was mostly the same post 9/11.
COVID19,fnm8w1s,t1_fnm8hya,1587067124.0,I see. Either way I don't think R_0 is as important of a metric and it's unfortunate that's what we latched on to.
COVID19,fnm6dvw,t1_fnlukuf,1587065883.0,I believe it is just referred to as an R value.
Coronavirus,fm2zb60,t1_fm2vpd2,1585708979.0,Think about that for 5 seconds and realize it makes no sense
