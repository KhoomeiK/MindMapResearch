UCI,fo4re6h,t1_fo4l299,1587509752.0,"Thank you, same to you!"
UCI,fo3yq40,t1_fo3y9eh,1587495223.0,"Yeah I got an email too, and I assumed that it meant that it got accepted. This is what it said:

Thank you for your interest in UC Irvine. You have successfully submitted your online TAG form to UC Irvine for fall 2020 admission. We now look forward to receiving your University of California transfer application during the November 1 - 30 application period. Apply at www.universityofcalifornia.edu/apply.

When applying for admission, please remember that your transfer admission guarantee is only applicable for the primary major you indicated on your TAG form.

UC Irvine does not provide early admission evaluation or early admission decisions as part of its TAG program. Once you apply to UC Irvine for transfer admission, we will review your TAG and notify you of your transfer admission status by the end of April.  It is important to remember that in order to maintain your TAG eligibility, you must meet the following conditions:

 • Apply for transfer admission to UC Irvine during the November 1 – 30 application period for 
    fall 2020;

 • Complete the second UC-transferable English course with a grade of C or better by the end 
    of spring 2020;

 • Complete 60 semester/90 quarter UC-transferable units by the end of spring 2020;

 • Complete all required coursework with the minimum GPA, including course prerequisites, for 
    your chosen major by the end of spring 2020 (view major preparation requirements at
    http://www.admissions.uci.edu/applicants/transfer_preparation.html);

 • Maintain an overall minimum 3.4 GPA in all UC-transferable course work through the end of 
    fall 2019 and maintain a minimum overall 3.4 GPA through the end of spring 2020;

 • Complete the Academic Update in January 2020 where you will record and submit 
    all fall term grades and any spring term course changes;

 • Complete all other minimum UC transfer admission requirements.

Students who do not meet UC Irvine’s TAG criteria may still be competitive for admission to UC Irvine as a general transfer applicant. If, for any reason, you are unable to meet the conditions of the TAG, an offer of admission will depend on your completion of transfer admission requirements and selectivity in the applicant pool.

Thank you for submitting your TAG application. UC Irvine has much to offer you, and we look forward to your becoming a part of our vibrant campus community.

UCI,fo3xm9c,t1_fo3wsl9,1587494673.0,I TAG’d for ME as well. What did the notice that your TAG got accepted look like? Did they tell you your TAG status after their admission decision? I heard that someone got an email that their TAG was accepted and got in 2 days after initially being rejected.
UCI,fo3v4py,t1_fo316m1,1587493462.0,"The thing is, UCI still hasn’t notified me that my TAG was rejected or not and I’m very confident that I met all of the requirements, plus I filled out my entire regular application thoroughly. That being said, they should’ve offered me admission. I truly feel like something got screwed up, so I’ll be putting in an appeal."
UCI,fo34pdm,t1_fo34is1,1587480503.0,"If you fulfill your end of the TAG agreement though, then they have to offer you admission, hence the whole ‘guarantee’ part"
UCI,fo32zid,t1_fo31e42,1587479563.0,I believe that they made a mistake! I’m going to call admissions and also appeal
Acura,fo2dept,t3_g506pd,1587458156.0,Couldn’t help but notice that you left the “69” uncovered on your license plate lol
UCI,fo2b6xh,t3_g586t0,1587455824.0,"I TAG’d but was sent a rejection notice. I’ve triple checked that I meat all of the TAG requirements, and got the same message back as OP after submitting my TAG application. I’m hoping this is all a mistake and will be writing a letter of appeal."
UCI,fo2ar5y,t1_fo2adyh,1587455381.0,"Yes I will definitely be doing that. Someone else made a post tonight about also getting rejected despite meeting all TAG requirements, which leads me to believe that this could be a mistake."

UCI,fo27ioa,t3_g59xyc,1587452225.0,Same thing happened to me! I TAG’d for Mechanical Engineering and got rejected too. I definitely meet all the requirements so I’m going to appeal.
Honda,fnnl58d,t1_fnn6wid,1587094955.0,"I also got t-boned at a light in my ‘02 Accord and it was totaled. I was totally devastated because it ran so well and was my first car (owned it for about 4 years). It had about 175k miles on it, but definitely showed no signs of letting up. I had some nice wheels, speakers, and an awesome stereo with Apple CarPlay on it. Luckily I was not at fault and put the money towards a ‘10 Acura TSX. I love my Acura, but still miss many things about my Accord."
matlab,fn3wwf0,t3_fzbymp,1586629514.0,I’d recommend doing the MATLAB Onramp tutorial. It gives a great how-to and overview of many things. https://www.mathworks.com/learn/tutorials/matlab-onramp.html
