But when the banks that serve over half the population fail simultaneously, then yes, it warrants a bailout (and [FYI, the US government made money on those bailouts](https://money.cnn.com/2014/12/19/news/companies/government-bailouts-end/index.html) and golden parachutes we’re taxed at 90%), in spite of capitalism. A free market is intended to let the consumers decide what is necessary and what is not. The airline industry did not crash because they are no longer essential, there is no more demand, or were not doing their jobs well. They crashed because a virus wiped them out.

I also want to point out that there are several platforms to trade using fake money, if you truly just want to get the feel for it

If you’re talking about WSB style, YOLO and buy puts on any stock trading under $10 (keep in mind that options contracts are for 100 shares, and the price you see is per share). Ford would be a good one in your price range, but I also don’t see any way that shares would go lower than maybe $1 less than where they’re at now
