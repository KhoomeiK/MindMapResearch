Tons of people haven’t had a typical college experience and that doesn’t mean they’re lacking or losers, we all just have different interests. I understand the appeal of parties and alcohol, but trust me when I say it isn’t everything. Yes it can be fun but it’s not for everyone. And that’s okay. You will eventually get your chance to do all the things you’ve been wanting to do, so don’t rush yourself."
