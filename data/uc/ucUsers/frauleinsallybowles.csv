unpopularopinion,fpbgr3w,t3_gcbwha,1588469633.0,"Ok I see your 2+ birthdays and I raise you this: My dad was born in his house in Iran, so there were no official documents given there since he wasn't born in a hospital, so his parents had to file for a birth certificate. Well, his parents hated each other SO much and were SO petty towards each other that my grandmother got him a birth certificate for April 29th, and my grandpa got him a birth certificate for May 1st, so now we celebrate for the whole 3 day period because we don't actually know for certain which day he was born"
