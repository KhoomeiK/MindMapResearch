MadeMeSmile,fpmcx66,t1_fplxs2b,1588730350.0,"It depends where the billboard is and how long his dad plans to leave it up. In a rural area, it is about $250-500 per month. A small city, maybe $1,000-$5,000/month. Anything like a major city would be like $15,000/month.

WeHateKpop,fpiyihd,t3_gdp82z,1588651793.0,"As a fellow Korean I agree. The sole problem honestly is not with Kpop, but it is with the utterly radical and toxic community that drives it, both fans and producers. It has further devolved what could have been an amazing cultural debut into a corrupt, sex-trafficing, and shaming thing that I cannot bear to associate with."

Witcher3,fpa9s4w,t1_fpa9nfp,1588443707.0,"Ooh, in that case, I'd recommend also looking into the viper gear if you've had the opportunity to get it. It looks just like his starting gear, but the stats are great for being higher level."

Witcher3,fp8vaft,t1_fp8v7jo,1588404193.0,"Awww, it honestly is the funniest thing to wear when you're interrogating people while going though the main questline. I haven't finished yet though, so we'll see where it takes me :)"
Witcher3,fp8v39p,t1_fp8v0r3,1588403996.0,"In Witcher 3, when you go to get Philipa from Dikstra, you can choose to beat him up and break his leg in the process.

Edit: In the novel, he actually first breaks his leg when he threatens Ciri. Makes me wish I had the books to read it :/"

deadcells,fn4188j,t1_fn37rvh,1586631991.0,"I highly recommend Hollow Knight. I went from playing HK to Dead Cells and I greatly enjoy both. And if you felt that DC had a good range of difficulty, I'm sure you'll find HK to be just as fulfilling."

KidsAreFuckingEvil,fmqblyq,t3_fwglsc,1586296562.0,"When I was a kid, I used to play with legos. I made this one character that was a super awesome dragon that used the lego hinge pieces for wings and the mouth. It was awesome. I made a tongue for it that consisted for string and a needle, and I would pretend to stab the other citizens with the tongue and eat them. Now, my sister calls me a sociopath. Take what you will from this story :D"
