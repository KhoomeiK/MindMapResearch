AmItheAsshole,fplj0y0,t1_fpkzoap,1588713585.0,Has it occured to you that maybe meatloaf is one of the few things she can eat without feeling nauseous or throwing up? Yta
MakeupAddiction,fp7aaxy,t3_gbl7lc,1588366892.0,I love it!!
roommates,fospj3t,t3_g9d15n,1588035392.0,Never eat anyone's food. Don't use other people's things without permission. Wash your dishes. Make sure there is a chore list and that everyone sticks to it (pray for that). Learn to compromise with others.
UCDavis,fokomg9,t1_foko5wb,1587845998.0,Thank you!!

UCDavis,fokmqw0,t1_fokmmy4,1587844976.0,Yes. I've been doing it for over a year. My friends do it some of my coworkers do it. You just have to keep swiping the gift card until it gives you there permit. The most it has every taken me was 6 tries
UCDavis,foklfz2,t3_g7yzmr,1587844267.0,"If you have an expired Visa gift card you can use that in the daily permit machine and get a free day permit. It'll take a few swipes but it'll give you one. I've been doing this for over a year and it has never failed me. Just buy a $20 visa gift card from Target, spend the money on whatever, then just use that. Save your money we are all broke AF"

roommates,fo0x2um,t3_g51w5i,1587421397.0,I know she's your friend but it doesn't seem like this is working for you. I suggest talking to her one last time and if she doesn't change then hit her with eviction papers after this pandemic is over and you can legally start the eviction process.
Whatcouldgowrong,fnrjqax,t3_g3epzm,1587191119.0,This infuriates my soul. Dumb people
Makeup101,fnn2to8,t3_g2q9ej,1587083213.0,👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻 girl I applaud you for all that work. It's a pain to clean them but it must be done.
UCDavis,fni4geu,t1_fni3upz,1586973811.0,Lol same. Never took the SATs or the ACTs
AskReddit,fn4ousd,t3_fzcou5,1586645795.0,I give people cool art facts and make sure they don't touch any art
roommates,fn19uvj,t3_fyq9fy,1586557675.0,"You may not like confrontation but you're gonna have to say something otherwise you'll just keep being in this situation. Tell him that he is not allowed to feed your dog scraps, if he wants to take your dog on a walk he needs to notify you and ask for permission first or just tell him he isn't allowed to walk your dog, and tell him that if he wants to dog in his room the door has to stay open so that you can still have eyes on her. Remember she's YOUR dog not his. You have to set the rules even if it means making you uncomfortable for 10 minutes while you talk."
BeautyAddiction,fmk7ojt,t3_fvp153,1586146684.0,I LOVE their liquid highlighters. It gives a subtle highlight that I adore but can be built up with a few layers to look blinding. It's a lipgloss type of packaging
