berkeley,fpecc4o,t3_gcqs1f,1588544698.0,lol i guess i should start
berkeley,fp54d38,t1_fp4s1bo,1588315907.0,"i would say that in my experience its not true that cal is overly competitive or cutthroat. obviously in my post i was venting about the problems i have with this department and certain subsets of it, but for the most part my experiences at this school have been great. even though there are rude people like those ive mentioned, overall most people still want to help each other out. i've had people in office hours randomly offer to share their study guides (including study guides that weren't free) and have seen many students help others during labs and discussions. i also feel like i made it sound like i have literally no friends in my classes jskfkfkgk (my CS friend group is taking SOME but not most of the same classes as me) but i do and theyre really great people. we all work together and help each other!"
csMajors,fp3xmmp,t1_fp1cezo,1588287716.0,"OP from the linked post here. Clearly, I have some issues with the culture of my department, but overall, I wouldn't change where I'm at for the world. I guess it would seem very easy to assume that I'm miserable when the only words anyones heard from me are that rant, but I'm super happy and have still found the best friends in the world. I genuinely only know one person who doesn't like the school and is unhappy being at Berkeley, but for the most part the ""everybody at Berkeley is depressed"" stereotype is a stereotype. It really breaks my heart to see people talk about how Berkeley is negative and cut throat, because thats a small sliver of the student population but definitely a loud minority (especially on a place like Reddit). I'm really glad you're happy at Davis (its such a nice school) but I just wanted to chime in!"
berkeley,foyu7c5,t1_fovsl9b,1588179249.0,is there a secondary internal application? or just the official department one?
berkeley,foo7psa,t1_foo3fkf,1587934125.0,nah
berkeley,foo7nvf,t1_foo1gl1,1587934096.0,"okay im so glad you said this, because i applied to for the UGSI position for 61A and 61B and i'm hoping I can get it. glad to know your experience was good! i had two female uGSIs for 61B and they're the reason i switched my major to EECS, so i'm really hoping i can be that inspiration for someone else!"
berkeley,foo7fz0,t1_fonxtpw,1587933976.0,"I'm in 61C currently but I think overall my interest still lies in software over hardware. I'm not planning on changing my career over this, because that would feel like letting them win, yanno? But thanks for the advice anyways, I'll keep it in mind!"
berkeley,foo74dn,t1_fomkwpj,1587933797.0,aww i actually took 61A last year (current sophomore) but if you (and any of the people who upvoted) really need help i'd be happy to do a short tutoring session! pm me if you're interested :)
berkeley,foo6tii,t1_fonot90,1587933630.0,"omg i hope my post doesn't discourage you from coming here or pursuing CS, cause in the end it's totally worth it and the education is so great. but its definitely good to keep all these issues in mind so you're not caught off guard or scared off. seriously feel free to pm me if you ever have questions or want advice/a friend!"
berkeley,foo6a8q,t1_fomna9x,1587933331.0,"i'm really really glad you're putting in effort to improve on this! i think one thing to note is that it depends on context and tone, of course. i think asking someone if they know what a tree is when they're a first semester student in cs10 and its the second week of class is appropriate. the reason i was so offended by this guy asking is because we were literally in the last week 61b, a course dedicated to data structures, and trees were something covered both in 61a and 61b. basically, it becomes offensive when you start assuming people don't have basic knowledge. if you're not sure if something counts as ""basic knowledge"" then just make sure to do what u/konnichiwsup said and frame it politely!"
berkeley,foo5jzs,t1_fomiz6p,1587932928.0,"this is great advice!! i've made some senior friends in CS from one of my clubs, but have yet to find anyone my age to take classes with. maybe next semester i'll try checking out some bigger groups to see if that helps."
berkeley,foo4xn3,t1_foncyza,1587932579.0,this!! it sucks that almost everybody in eecs is so competitive and high strung because i have a genuine interest in computers but also just want to relax and enjoy my life. it's hard to do that when everyone around you is so intense and weird about it
berkeley,fombxes,t3_g7zuc2,1587884593.0,"as a freshman the greatest advice i received was to take minimum units (12 for CoE). i wish i wish i wishhhhh i could convince everyone to do this, seriously. i spent my first semester making friends, rooting myself in communities n friend groups, figuring out what worked for me and what didn't, and enjoying myself! its so worth it to take it easy on school at first so you can set yourself up for happiness for the remaining 4 years."
berkeley,foi354s,t1_foeqrqe,1587777756.0,"Lol I work in a lab at UCSF and talk to a lot of postdocs there regularly. We have a few stanford people and one of them was a GSI/TA whatever they call them there, and they were told by the professor to not give any grades below a B ðŸ¤”"
berkeley,fnu21jx,t1_fnu11vh,1587253021.0,"Ooh ok makes sense. If you took it, do you mind sharing what prof u took it with and what you thought? It sounds like a fun class to me but the rate my professor reviews made it sound like a bad idea."
COVID19,fnu1voy,t1_fn9hm6j,1587252929.0,Thanks for the super thorough response! I study phage biology not human virus biology so the way viruses interact w a eukaryotes immune system is foreign territory to me. I appreciate this super clear summary and explanation.
berkeley,fntzkll,t3_g3rev1,1587251623.0,"I've truly never experienced cut-throat competitiveness?? There are some annoying kids that love to brag and show off how much they know but I think that's a given no matter what school you're at. It's not like those people are actually doing anything to bring you down either way.

And I've never once experienced grade deflation or been negatively affected by the curve, which people always said was a huge problem at Berkeley. Not saying it doesn't happen, but I've never had professors actively lower students grades because people were doing too good."
COVID19,fn895c0,t3_fvz71d,1586736546.0,"Does a strong immune system lead to asymptomatic carrying or never catching it at all? In other words, if someone had a really strong immune system, does that make it more likely that A) they catch the virus, but don't show symptoms or B) never catch it in the first place? 

Why i'm asking: I never really get sick (knock on wood). The last time I can recall having a fever was over 3 years ago and I've had the common cold maybe twice in my life. On the other hand, my dad gets sick more often than me (but still a normal amount) and is also not in good shape which might make him more at risk. I moved back in w my parents for quarantine and he's been doing the grocery shopping, but I keep insisting that it would be better if I do it, since I have a stronger immune system. In my head, since my immune system is stronger, even if I were to be exposed at the grocery store I wouldn't contract the virus, and so I wouldn't bring it home and expose my family. Is this argument sound?"
berkeley,fma3cc5,t3_ftpmsp,1585882792.0,"i deadass wasn't even allowed to graduate high school on time (found out that I didn't fulfill my P.E. requirement correctly 2 months before graduation... long story) and nothing was rescinded, I just emailed a few people to let them that I didn't have a diploma to send them and they truly didn't care."
