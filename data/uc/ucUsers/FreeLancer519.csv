Competitiveoverwatch,fphzhqg,t3_gdl680,1588630716.0,"Meh, better than straight up moving teams like other sports. Fuck Dean Spanos. Get out of LA. No one wants you here"
Competitiveoverwatch,fphylnk,t1_fphyav6,1588630225.0,"I highly doubt that that was their #1 goal. That was probably just pr speak. If their goal was to win, then picking up players like Agilities was fucking dumb. It was obvious they wanted to pick up Canadian/Western players who were popular the second the rumors came out that they would trade for Agilities and S4. Also their are other ways to get excited for teams then just winning. Popular players is one way to gain fans"
Competitiveoverwatch,fphy46g,t1_fphx6yt,1588629961.0,And that’s totally fine. Anybody who looked at this roster objectively in the offseason should have seen this coming. They would be a below average team that could only beat bottom to mid tier teams and would ride on the popularity of certain players like Agilities and Surefour. No problem with that at all. Every team can’t be competitive so why not be popular? I have no issue with Toronto’s vision at all

Competitiveoverwatch,fpcdnhj,t3_gcnhip,1588496600.0,I don't even know where to start with this game. Seoul lost 3 straight 3-0 games. Spark are not this good to 3-0 a team with talent like Seoul that badly. Seoul look fucking lost on the Echo comps...
Competitiveoverwatch,fpcdjgy,t3_gcmksa,1588496479.0,A choke means not being able to do something you can usually do normally. This was not a choke. Seoul are just bad

Competitiveoverwatch,fpb0iu0,t1_fpb0eit,1588459555.0,LOL I never thought of that. That would be annoying to me if I had to do that too
Competitiveoverwatch,fpaz32e,t1_fpayvac,1588458705.0,"100%. Sideshow criticized NYXL for having 0 good wins until they went to Asia. Well, Atlanta has had 0 good wins this season too. They beat Toronto, Boston, Florida, and Washington. Also, if they played Florida again, they could absolutely lose that game too. They are a top 10 team at best. Not a top 5 team"
Competitiveoverwatch,fpayr3h,t3_gcfaeg,1588458510.0,"Can we start ranking Atlanta properly now? For fucks sake, Plat Chat had them above the Gladiators like what?? 
Such a dissapointing start to their season.
Their off tanks are mediocre. I've never been impressed with
Atlanta this season. The only comp they're good at is the Orisa/Sigma comp. They seem to be one tricks.
Also, their dps line, which was ranked as one of the best in the offseason, has been overrated. 
Erster is by far their best dps player. Why they would ever sub him out is beyond me. Edison, one of the
most hyped dps player coming from contenders, got absolutely outclassed by Shax on Tracer. 
Honestly, the only player who I thought was decent this game for Atlanta was fucking Dogman, 
who I've shit on this year a lot so props to him at least."
Competitiveoverwatch,fpayefo,t3_gcbbku,1588458300.0,Edison killed himself with pulse its over
Competitiveoverwatch,fpaxl7u,t1_fpaxg6j,1588457812.0,Their off tank position has been weak this year. Both Hawk and FRD has honestly been mediocre. I've never been impressed with Atlanta outside of Orisa/Sigma comps. They seem like one tricks...

Competitiveoverwatch,fpawz3r,t3_gcbbku,1588457445.0,Add sharp to the list of bad sombra players in OWL
Competitiveoverwatch,fpawfqh,t3_gcbbku,1588457124.0,What a disaster. The Reign shouldn't have even needed EMP to win that fight. But they invested it and they still lost...
Competitiveoverwatch,fpavrex,t3_gcbbku,1588456724.0,LOLOL Pokpo what a dumb play
Competitiveoverwatch,fpavlmz,t3_gcbbku,1588456628.0,"If they can't win with emp, it'll be a disaster"

Competitiveoverwatch,fp974wk,t3_gc4k10,1588416905.0,"This match is so impressive for me for Shanghai. Way more than if they had 3-0. Most teams would have collapsed being down 2-0. But they came back, kept their composure, and slapped up NYXL on the final 3 maps. They're the best team in the league. Meanwhile, NYXL wtf was that? They fucking collapsed and played like crap, especially in the last map."

Competitiveoverwatch,fp90oah,t3_gc3c23,1588409813.0,What we’ve learned is that Gesture/Marve1 are a double shield one trick tank duo. Which makes me think Michelle has to be punished by the coaches. Cause that’s the only reason I can think of as to why he’s not playing. They sucked dick on the dive sombra echo comp like holy fuck...
Competitiveoverwatch,fp90kw5,t3_gc2ga5,1588409710.0,Wolf was about to mald the fuck out LOL
Competitiveoverwatch,fp8zg6f,t3_gc2ga5,1588408511.0,Honestly I can’t even say Seoul is being exposed. More like theyre playing like idiots. Like why the fuck are they playing dive? At this point they look like double shield one tricks. Why is Marve1 on D.va? Is Michelle in the doghouse by the Seoul coaches? Profits echo is getting such little value and Creative has had some awful positioning issues so far
Competitiveoverwatch,fp8zauk,t3_gc2ga5,1588408354.0,Holy shit Chara good shit

Competitiveoverwatch,fp8ys3n,t3_gc2ga5,1588407803.0,I’m surprised with the diversity we’ve seen in the DPS role. In OWL every dps has seen significant playtime except for Bastion lmao
Competitiveoverwatch,fp8yi0i,t1_fp8yfcg,1588407509.0,Theres a lot you can point to but Marve1 D.va is starting to be a real liability. Idk why they keep putting him on it.
Competitiveoverwatch,fp8ye8k,t3_gc2ga5,1588407400.0,Really wish I could see how Seoul lost that much percentage but nope
