BlackPeopleTwitter,fpmew0e,t1_fpm6cqp,1588731562.0,"I agree. I got a statistics and actuarial mathematics degree from UCLA in 4 years. It was expensive, but I’m making enough now to fully justify it and made sure to make the most out of my tuition. On the one hand, I agree that tuition is outrageous. On the other, 18-20 yr olds are still very immature and make stupid decisions. Many take 5 years just to get the one major. I think the onus falls on the student, the students parents, and their high school counselors to pick a school that’s right for them. While people have dream schools, it’s not worth paying 40k if you can get into a great school in your state."
westworld,fpm6prt,t1_fplyv0i,1588726681.0,"I’m not saying he’s a bad actor. I agree that the writers kind of gave him a shit hand. Especially with the going from “not knowing what’s going on and being seduced like a puppy” to leading the revolution. It seemed at times like they picked the actor and then tried to write the character around him rather than creating the character and having the actor become him. It felt more like they were trying to grab attention with Aaron Paul rather than with Caleb. 


I do still think the typecasting for Aaron Paul is very real. I’m willing to bet that a lot of people say Jesse instead of Caleb when they talk about the show with friends."

Fitness,fpkug73,t1_fpf5f9d,1588701229.0,"Yeah PPL is really only worth it if you’re going 6 days a week because it’s designed around allowing your muscle groups to recover. There’s no point doing it with 3-4 days because the whole point of muscle recovery is thrown out the window. 


I think typical recommendations would be:


3 days available: full body x3

4 days: Upper Lower x2

5 days: PPL Upper Lower 

6 days: PPL x2"
Fitness,fpkte2l,t1_fpkssqu,1588700710.0,Super setting biceps on leg day has been a life changer. I’d always wait until the end of upper day to do them and have no stamina left. Doing them on leg day allows me to work them out properly without impacting my leg lifts at all.
Fitness,fpks96i,t3_gd3hwt,1588700146.0,"Depends how often you want to go to the gym. My only problem with PPL is that it is hard to find 6 days a week after work to go to the gym. I also get less motivated to do cardio. Don’t want to do it before because it lowers my energy. Never have energy after (since it turns ppl from a 1 hr workout to a 1hr 30 min workout). And don’t want to do 2-a-days.


What I’ve been doing is an upper/lower split. I go 4 days a week and each day I focus on Bench, Deadlift, Squat, or Press. I do upper body on Bench and Press days, lower on squat and deadlift days. I do bicep and forearm work on the lower days though - I found it nice to superset them with leg exercises rather than to do them at the end of upper body days where I’ll have no energy left for them. Then I save 2 days as “healthy activity” days. This means bike ride, basketball, soccer, running, hiking, kayaking, etc. Then I have my 1 optional rest day.


The 4 days keeps me very flexible because I can better plan the days each week I’m going to workout. The healthy activity days are good for when I have a rec game and don’t want to be sore or if my gf wants to go on a long hike or bike ride and I don’t want to workout the same day."

Sacramento,fphj6xe,t1_fpe1b5s,1588622218.0,"I think this restaurant is specifically suffering due to the type of clientele they serve. If you look up the restaurant on yelp, it’s clear that their target audience are older folk who want to eat a nice breakfast in a traditional diner-type cafe. These customers aren’t going to get breakfast as takeout or delivery - they aren’t savvy enough with technology. The business should really try and find a way to market to their local customers. Maybe partnering with churches in the area to set up breakfast pickup spots or something like that. 


Meanwhile, places like biergartens are finding a way to survive because they cater to younger populations who are more likely to be happy with curbside pickup, are wooed by growler deals (just look at this subreddit), and understand how to place orders online."

actuary,for27zq,t3_g8of0q,1588004914.0,"I think it works better if it’s a company you’ve already worked in person for and they’re just switching you to WFH. It’s different if you got a brand new role and started working from home immediately. It may cap your earnings by preventing you to learn the business side as well as you otherwise could have. Many would argue that a technical role where you can earn 100-120k without the responsibilities of being a manager AND getting to work from home would be a dream job. It really depends what you’re looking to get out of this career path.


My take on working from home so far during this pandemic is that it’s good in spurts. I could handle 3 days a week working from home because it’s nice to have no commute, have lunch at home, etc. I still think 1-2 days in the office are necessary though as it allows you to still socialize with your coworkers and have face-to-face time with your boss about your tasks. I really think this should be the norm for how companies operate after this pandemic ends. If companies just picked 2-3 days a week to have their employees come in, then they could strategize with other companies to select different days such that traffic is minimized, which would enhance everybody’s quality of life."

ucla,fo7mjjb,t1_fo6j0pg,1587580885.0,"I agree it’s pretty stupid that we pay taxes to live in CA to subsidize the education of international students who will return home as soon as they graduate. It would be smart for them to charge international students an extra fee that the UCs only reimburse if the student ends up working and paying taxes in CA. 


I think out of state tuition is pretty fair - it should match the price that out of state schools would charge CA residents. It is already pretty high at 30-40k maximum and these students are at least US residents. International tuition  should be like double out of state though. Many international students’ families are definitely able to afford it. For those admitted who can’t, offer financial aid. I wish they would crack down on the “Transfer to a CA highschool to establish residency and then pay in-state tuition” loophole too."

Sacramento,fo3r46l,t3_g4wh0k,1587491583.0,"As an actuary this is insulting. Their loss ratios are going to be insanely low (we see a 50% reduction in car crashes right now). Instead of giving cash back to their customers, they are going to pocket the profits. Nobody really knows how premiums work (they are made difficult on purpose) and there are no regulations capping their profits. In health, many insurance companies are capped at an 85-90% loss ratio by the government. Theres no such regulations in the auto insurance industry. The only reason we are seeing any discounts is because they are competing for our business and want to be labeled as the “friend of the consumer”. In reality, they are all anti-consumer.

worldnews,fnpvynx,t1_fnptm5h,1587152995.0,"I live in CA. Right now, the supply of housing is much lower than the demand for housing. As a result, homes are more expensive than they should be, and there are even bidding wars for new properties. Because good homes are now more expensive, there is a greater variance of price between neighborhoods (let’s say low crime vs high crime). Landlords buy up properties looking to rent them out. Because the mortgage payment is so high on these high value properties, they have to charge a fortune. Now, if we increased the supply of housing, then these houses would sell for less. With a smaller mortgage payment, landlords could afford to charge lower rent while still profiting. Because rentals are an industry with many competitors, we can rely on competition in the market to drive prices down to an equilibrium where landlords are still able to profit and renters are able to afford housing. 


The onus is really on the government though to loosen zoning restrictions. Private companies would be willing to build new properties, but zoning prevents landlords from entering the market place. Corporations with many rentals have too many lobbyists in play preventing any relaxation of zoning laws - they know an increase in housing supply will decrease their profit, so they prevent entry to the market. This is a market inefficiency and needs to be fixed. Many government regulations on zoning are legitimate and make sense, many however corruptly restrict the free market in favor of big corporations."

If something bad happens, then they are supposed to have an opposite position that cancels out a huge chunk of their losses. If there is no risk though, all we will see is a bunch of billionaire bull brats gambling everything with the knowledge that nothing bad can happen to them.
