UCDavis,fod7zkj,t3_g6vake,1587681415.0,It's usually Dr. Lievens. She is pretty good. Tried taking it last summer but had to bail due to health issues.
UCDavis,fod7uf3,t1_fod3x7e,1587681358.0,Not too shabby. So far it just seems to be based on the stuff on the lectures and the slides.

bayarea,fnu3cbp,t1_fnqotb2,1587253731.0,Yes indeed. I was considering moving to TX later on because of no state income tax and better property prices.

UCDavis,fnj97au,t1_fnfkdyv,1586994371.0,"The Bay Area is terrible. Over expensive as all hell, rampant homelessness that nobody seems to care about, and a whole grungy air permeates the area.

Let's be real, it sucks to be there. I went to Berkeley last Saturday and got accosted by 2 homeless individuals when I was there for an hour. On top of that, I was also mainly in my car since I was just doing some quick pick ups there.

At least Davis is safe, and doesn't cost 2 kidneys to live here."
UCDavis,fnfgjh1,t3_g1gewx,1586907623.0,"Davis easily. The Bay Area sucks and is a miserable place to live. Also, people try to screw each other over at Berkeley, it's apart of the campus culture.  Davis is far safer and there is a greater sense of comradery here."

shadow_of_war,fn1vrbr,t1_fn0tf6b,1586571280.0,"Usually it takes like 30 ish mins for them to ambush you. That is in game time, so time spent in the pause menu doesn't count. Do nemesis missions and stuff like that. Sometimes the RNG screws you over and you get unlucky. It really boils down to luck but dying and shaming a few times usually ups your chances."
shadow_of_war,fn0t3ba,t1_fn0ssmr,1586548215.0,"How many times did you die to him/shame him? Since you unlocked the seregost fight pits, that means that the chance of cheating death is not as high as in the beginning.

Die a bunch/shame him a bunch, encounter him and run away a few times on top of that. Then kill him with a graug and viola!"
