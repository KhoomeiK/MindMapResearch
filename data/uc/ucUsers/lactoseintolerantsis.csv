ApplyingToCollege,fngaqq1,t1_fngailh,1586926686.0,honestly the course isn‚Äôt over and I have time to raise it but it‚Äôs genuinely hard. my teacher doesn‚Äôt do extra credit for calculus ):
birthcontrol,fn65lqt,t3_fztcmf,1586688334.0,"hey, i‚Äôm not too sure about the IUD situation but you should hear me out with my experience with the arm implant (nexaplanon) 

long story short: everyone says ‚Äúwait out 6 months to see if it works‚Äù i waited for 8 months and basically bled every single. day. the DAY i got the arm implant out and onto the nuvaring, i magically stopped bleeding?!? 

i became very very depressed and my anxiety was an all time high. i never felt stressed about going to the doctors. i NEVER in my life was scared of needles, in fact the doctors used to let me prick my own fingers for blood tests. i came back to get it removed and i was shaking. i knew in my head it was dumb bc i‚Äôm not scared of doctors or pain (high pain tolerance) but my anxiety was crazy. 

best of luck ‚ù§Ô∏è"
birthcontrol,fn65e7k,t3_fzu2s3,1586688095.0,"i would like to know as well! i‚Äôm not stopping the pill but i‚Äôm getting off birth control (nuvaring) completely. 

so far what i‚Äôve seen is like if your boobs grew on birth control, they‚Äôll probably go back. i heard that if u had a lot of acne before and the birth control helped it, then it‚Äôll come back. vice versa if u didn‚Äôt have acne. i personally had little to no acne before and dealing with some rn. 

i‚Äôm worried about weight gain since it‚Äôs the biggest reason why i‚Äôm coming off birth control. please let me and the OP know!"
birthcontrol,fmp9do3,t1_fmo7aim,1586276832.0,"i‚Äôm not really sure, my moms anemic bc of her iron deficiency and same with me now. :/ it really sucks that i waited it out like everyone told me to but it was horrible and didn‚Äôt just go away"
birthcontrol,fmo6nec,t1_fmo6k6z,1586247341.0,"i took it out at the end of the 8th month and sadly now i realized with all the blood i lost, i‚Äôm anemic"
birthcontrol,fmmyr0e,t1_fmmykc4,1586214647.0,"i was trying to say that plan B shouldn‚Äôt be taken regularly because it‚Äôs meant to be for only emergencies. if you take plan B regularly, it messes up your hormones. it‚Äôs not something you can take over and over and it‚Äôs written on the label itself. you shouldn‚Äôt be a popping plan B every time you‚Äôre scared of getting pregnant."
birthcontrol,fmmuyq1,t1_fmmrczx,1586212582.0,same! i turned 17 just 6 months ago and i‚Äôm balding?! wishing you the best ü•∫‚ù§Ô∏è
birthcontrol,fmmr3oz,t1_fmmqy2e,1586210465.0,me too. im about to go off birth control in general bc i really cant stand losing hair and gaining weight anymore. it sucks a lot bc i‚Äôve been taking hair vitamins for like over a year to help w the hair loss but it just doesn‚Äôt seem to get better.
birthcontrol,fmmqihv,t3_fvz0wl,1586210154.0,omg.. i‚Äôm abt to go off the nuvaring after like a year and yes i agree w the hair loss. i already have thin asian hair but now it‚Äôs so bad.
birthcontrol,fmmpwe0,t3_fw6u6p,1586209826.0,it doesn‚Äôt stop have 6 months sadly. i tried my best to wait it out but i bled for EIGHT MONTHS STRAIGHT
birthcontrol,fmknje5,t3_fvol3h,1586161325.0,"headaches, got that. nausea, got that. i bled for 8 months too LOL it‚Äôs not weird and it never goes away :/ i got it removed i couldn‚Äôt stand the feeling of needing to pass out 24/7."
birthcontrol,fmkncsj,t3_fvrarr,1586161121.0,i went on the nuvaring and i do the 3 weeks in 1 week out for my period. i don‚Äôt really have much to say other than you‚Äôll get weird discharge so keep ur kitty clean. sleep with no underwear and just loose shorts so it can breath
birthcontrol,fmknaqc,t3_fvrjk0,1586161057.0,no! i honestly don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs anything to worry about. you shouldn‚Äôt take plan B unless he ever cums in you bc plan b is really bad to take. it‚Äôs only used when it‚Äôs super necessary.
birthcontrol,fmkn0nc,t3_fvtbor,1586160749.0,"i bled for 8 months straight, became anemic, tried to kill myself, and my anxiety was so bad."
