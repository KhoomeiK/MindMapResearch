AmItheAsshole,fpe26hq,t1_fpcpomc,1588538874.0,"If I'm being honest A doesn't have many friends. She's kind of immature socially. She had friends in elementary and she was the class clown, but never a bully, and she's struggling in middle school. I definitely think I've been unfair to E because she has more than A and I guess I expected her to be the bigger person, but the more I think about it A doesn't have any real friends.

Because your husband is not teaching his daughter limits. Dumping water on someone is not playful to everyone else. That‚Äôs the problem, she needs to be taught limits but your husband is failing. And look at your own comment. You don‚Äôt think her lack of boundaries is limiting her own growth? While her peers are maturing, she‚Äôs just not?"

AmItheAsshole,fpboas9,t1_fpbnz4u,1588474664.0,"But it doesn‚Äôt matter what he thinks, the prank wasn‚Äôt done to him. Doesn‚Äôt seem like someone that can think beyond himself. Hopefully y‚Äôall can work it out for A‚Äôs sake."
AmItheAsshole,fpbnr2j,t1_fpbg1i6,1588474292.0,Ok let‚Äôs back track. Your husband doesn‚Äôt think his daughter should apologize for dumping water on someone. They should have both apologized to each other. But he sounds like a crap person that can‚Äôt be bothered to parent.

UCSantaBarbara,fp0vr6n,t1_foyvlue,1588218021.0,"Hey! I lost a ton of weight while I was at UCSB. You can see my weight loss in my posts. I had no issues being bigger at UCSB, I had a great time. But there‚Äôs so many outdoor activities to do there, everything was much easier and more enjoyable at a lower weight."
TrueOffMyChest,fowywlt,t1_fowozog,1588130164.0,"Thank god we got ‚Äúrevenge‚Äù while screwing over our farmers. The president of the United States rejects science, economics, and diplomatic relations. The man has a pea brain size."
TrueOffMyChest,fowykwv,t1_fowy9ad,1588129961.0,Ask her to name any positive policy Trump has pushed. They can‚Äôt think with their brain. I think they‚Äôre all lost causes.

relationship_advice,fohns74,t1_fohkrv9,1587769150.0,Same. We get taxed at an insane rate and we will continue to be. I don‚Äôt understand why they don‚Äôt want that money to be used for good.

relationship_advice,foh6qn0,t1_foh4x1o,1587761149.0,ITS OUR TAX MONEY YOU IDIOT. YOU SOMEHOW WENT TO COLLEGE AND DIDNT LEARN ANYTHING. You think you‚Äôre the only one that went to a 4 year and earns over 100k? I do too. You‚Äôre literally so special. Missed some science and economics classes?
relationship_advice,foh3eqp,t1_fogzmvf,1587760085.0,"You see the irony in saying 1200 won‚Äôt hold people over when your dear Republicans gave away $1 billion to large corporations? You don‚Äôt think the government should take care of its people by providing them with an income so they don‚Äôt risk their health by going back to work while they create a plan to deal with Covid 19? Stop the cult and hold the people you voted for accountable. I know I do. Yes you can predict a spread. It was predicted by many scientists. There was a dedicated team to prevent the spread. Yet it was disbanded. It‚Äôs not about blame, it‚Äôs about how to prevent it from happening again. The economic collapse going on, your friend lost his job? You did this. By voting for people who do not give a shit about you and only care about money."
relationship_advice,fogw502,t1_fogv3kt,1587757638.0,"Do you think Covid 19 cares about any of this? You want to reopen when there is no competent plan to stop the spread of Covid 19? Imagine we had a proper response and had a social safety net, your dear friend wouldn‚Äôt be in such a dire need. Yet, you see how your buddies the republicans are blocking such aid and are fine with that. I cannot make you see logic. 

But your girlfriend can call herself whatever she wants. But she‚Äôs lazy. You two are not compatible."
relationship_advice,fof1pli,t1_foes43t,1587722797.0,"HE ACCEPTED YOUR APOLOGY. I‚Äôm sorry, reading your post made me want to throw the dishes at him. He needs to apologize to you too. The way you stop your anger is for him to start cleaning his mess. Let me ask you this, are you typically this angry about other things? I had dirty roommates like your husband and it turned me into a whole different person, full of rage. I don‚Äôt have much advice to give but I do empathize with you.

I just read he is home all day now. I‚Äôm sorry he definitely needs to clean. Just wow."

relationships,fo5t38p,t1_fo5rs5t,1587534818.0,"In theory, he‚Äôs 100% right. But his wording throws me off. He never waivers in him being right. He never tries to empathize why she‚Äôs upset. Sure he offered the redo but he‚Äôs still right. He‚Äôs failing to understand her and I think that‚Äôs what‚Äôs frustrating her."
