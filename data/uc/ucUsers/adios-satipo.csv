If you go back and look at the first discussion posts of people's first reactions to the movie, you notice that they're generally positive -- people think the casino scene is unnecessary and that the movie plays a little fast and loose with the canon, sure, but that isn't getting in the way of people enjoying the movie. But you look a couple of weeks later, and it's accepted by large numbers of the Star Wars fandom that the movie was some sort of virtue signaling canon-busting piece of shit, because people have spent so long reading comments by the vocal minority complaining that they start to feel like *they're* wrong for liking the movie.

I personally felt this sort of shift because I wrote a review for my school paper giving The Last Jedi a really good score, and once I went online and read the hate about TLJ, I started to actually believe I was one of the """"""out-of-touch media members"""""" who wasn't a big enough fan to realize the movie is shit. Only after a year or so did I realize that I was letting random Redditors tell me that I didn't enjoy a movie that I really liked. Reminds me of that ProZD video about before and after joining a subreddit -- you really begin to adopt their dogma. 

I've seen the same thing with friends who've said ""I really liked the Last Jedi but then I read about it online and I realized that it wasn't that great"" -- and I think that's *really* bad especially since the more vocal members of online fandom value different things in movies (generally adherence to whatever they consider the ""good parts"" of the canon and essentially staying in the same place) than most moviegoers.
