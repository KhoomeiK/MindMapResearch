I reply, attaching a screenshot of the hold to the email, and they never got back to me. Gonna have to  try again when registration rolls around again (cause I'm a procrastinator)"
ucr,fo0c8fm,t3_g4nd8n,1587410144.0,"I think it depends on what you are using to take the test cause I believe some sites let you do that, but most likely not tbh"

ucr,fnfod3t,t3_g1gnaf,1586912099.0,"If you already have priority registration, then I'd say you don't need it. The SI sessions they have are open to everyone, even non LC, but they will be mandatory to go to if you're part of it."
