Emo,fpib2j9,t3_gdi1v6,1588637260.0,I'm literally listening to this album as I type this. Best coincidence.
smashbros,fpfdgoq,t3_gcypix,1588568060.0,"I subscribed to the Indian smash channel out of curiosity, like ""is there even a smash scene in India?"" Turns out there is and it's pretty hype."

ucla,fodrqyz,t3_g552rc,1587688896.0,Low-key drank a beer with my camera on during class and nobody said anything. Was pretty funny tbh
ucla,fodrm0j,t1_fo58ew9,1587688822.0,So UCLA students can apply?
ucla,fodrfit,t3_g6p55u,1587688723.0,"I really don't like it. Not being able to go to the library to get the books I need while at the same time being stuck using online databases where there's no guarantee that the book you need is even there is a pain in the ass when I'm trying to research.

The ILL system was an incredible resource and now I'm stuck without it until like next year."
AskReddit,fobs3rt,t1_foa824r,1587663063.0,Isn't Kirkland signature the same as grey goose?
Emo,fo6z7rf,t1_fo6nxyf,1587569433.0,That's a relief
NorthKoreaPics,fo3taxa,t3_g5i2q2,1587492596.0,That looks like someone of European origin in the back.
Emo,fo28t2q,t3_g4xzlw,1587453450.0,"I could care less about what Pitchfork says about an album because imo they have their heads up their asses a lot of the time, but I gotta give them credit for bringing attention to this band. I really liked what I heard."

atheism,fnzx1rj,t3_g4adhi,1587402229.0,"Used to work for the Quakers. Very pleasant people, extremely liberal, and if you happen to be an atheist they really don't care. I think from what I understand, they believe religion is very personal so it's not something they push on people"

dirtgame,fnmecwn,t3_g21rkt,1587069908.0,"I've posted about this before. Actual RX allows limited side contact and a bit of roughhousing but you'll get a time penalty if you push-to-pass or pit maneuver anyone. The problem with Dirt Rally 2.0 is that the virtual stewards only punish you for cutting corners but doesn't punish you for pushing cars around or pit maneuvering people. I've gotten away with and been on the receiving end of the angry AI so many times that my current strategy is just to win the launch and keep a good racing line so they can't touch me.

Hopefully in the upcoming E-sports race they'll have more stewards watching to keep things kinda clean. I don't expect F1 levels of clean racing but I don't want to see people getting away with random bumper car bullshittery like the AI does."
dirtgame,fnmdqdr,t3_g1w3h3,1587069589.0,Be proud that you're repping the C3. I still prefer the Audi S1 over the Megane in RX and I have the most fun driving the C3 because I get really sick slides in my replays even if it's technically slower
dirtgame,fnmdjl5,t1_fnidr8g,1587069492.0,I will forever defend my C3. I like the other R5 cars but the C3 is the most fun to drive even if the turning radius is garbage
dirtgame,fnmd94o,t1_fnjz2xc,1587069340.0,im at the point where whenever I see videos of cars doing crazy shit I just assume travis is driving
dirtgame,fnmd6uu,t3_g1suyn,1587069309.0,If you did this in Ken Block's RS200 it'd go even further. That thing has like 800HP

Android,fnkp9qm,t1_fnhkchl,1587035677.0,"Apple is at the point where they can pull a Xiaomi and sell a phone at a loss if they wanted to. They're focusing pretty hard on services like apple music, iTunes TV, iCloud etc and if it gets customers into the ecosystem, a cheap iPhone makes a lot of sense"
SSBPM,fnkcogj,t1_fniydfc,1587022190.0,thanks man.
SSBPM,fn1m5db,t1_fmxkue3,1586564973.0,I think I might need to do that. I'm not exactly sure what I did but I'll dig some resources up if I have time.
dirtgame,fmqk3wz,t3_fwtnhq,1586301179.0,im down!
ucla,fmqjqn4,t3_fwu3vy,1586300966.0,idk man I'm still on campus
dirtgame,flz6zf5,t1_fly9i16,1585616903.0,My understanding based on responses I've gotten from commenting on some drivers' pictures on Instagram is that *something* is in the works but they're not willing to discuss it.
