MMA,fobyyjz,t3_g6g9kc,1587665256.0,"Jon obviously has a very high opinion of himself, bit of a god complex. I used to be the same way - I got away with a lot of shit and figured it's because I'm smarter, luckier, more athletic...until shit inevitably hit the fan and my house of cards came falling down.

Unlike Jon, I was forced to change my ways. I went from being cocky and overconfident to overthinking everything due to insecurity. Jon still thinks he'll get away with it -- although for the most part he has. Mitigating circumstances mean he always faces a lightened punishment for his actions. He has never been forced to face the music and so he keeps on doing the same things.

The worst part is that he preaches one thing while doing another (case in point: his stay home IG post), and always plays the sympathy card (my kids, my faith). He would probably do well if he embraced things and became a bit of a Felony Bennett type character, at least for the cameras, but he's far too ""dignified"" for that. Even the way he talks on the mic, you can tell he finds himself very intelligent, carefully crafting responses he thinks people want to hear. 

tl;dr: Don't expect Jones to change!"
