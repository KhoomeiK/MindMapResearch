Get the $1800 model with 10th gen chips if you can afford it, since 16GB of RAM will keep your computer running well throughout undergrad. Buy a monitor for coding at home (I use a 24""HP one that cost about $120). I know someone who uses a 16 and says it's way too big and heavy to carry around classes, so I'd avoid it, but your mileage may vary."
