ProgrammerHumor,fplwg26,t1_fplu8j9,1588720785.0,"It’s illegal to discriminate by age, but companies will hire for “culture fit.” In some web development companies most entry level hires will be 22-25 so they may unofficially rule you out. There are plenty of other companies (especially military) that don’t care about that kind of stuff though, and might even give you an edge for being former military. Younger people also have enormous turnover rates, so companies might appreciate an older person who they think is likely to stay for a long time"
chelseafc,fpfksy1,t1_fpfdb1w,1588574334.0,I feel the same. Zouma I think is more likely to embrace a backup role too
chelseafc,fpfkm7z,t1_fpchgkj,1588574166.0,"This was during the peak of our Hazard dependency, and he was awful the entire season except last couple games against Liverpool and Tottenham. There were other factors, but this was the biggest in my opinion. I’ve tried to repress the memories of that season as much as possible"
soccer,fozr9u3,t1_foyw9w5,1588195482.0,"I also thought the hate he got during the World Cup was ridiculous. Did he embellish a lot? Yes. But it didn’t compare to how unprotected he was each game. I think it was against Serbia where the ref seemed totally fine to let him get kicked the entire game. And he (and the rest of Brazil bar Fernandinho) were great against Belgium. But Belgium were also great against Brazil, only one of them could go through"
AskReddit,fowfbbq,t1_fowdovw,1588118661.0,"Yeah exactly. If one came in a month, like OP said we’d be totally unprepared. But we’re prepared enough to know that one is NOT coming in a month (and a lot further out than that)"
chelseafc,fopgkhv,t1_fonzvhg,1587960936.0,"That’s a really good filter then, I can barely tell it’s fake. But idk how much I can trust you, Keyser Soze"
chelseafc,fobtyw8,t1_fobm76z,1587663634.0,"It was a really weird time, hazard oscar mata benayoun marin moses and Malouda competing for the 3 spots behind the striker. I think benayoun didn’t get much of a chance, he played well at arsenal when he was loaned there"
chelseafc,fobj7ji,t1_fob7xfo,1587660360.0,"Yeah Benayoun said he didn’t care about the #10, it was given to him when he arrived. He wanted the #15 but it was taken, and when Mata came he was fine giving up the #10"

chelseafc,fnv237b,t1_fnv156i,1587277732.0,"I agree, that’s why I don’t think lukaku would have been much of an improvement"
chelseafc,fnuu14e,t1_fnti4zl,1587271067.0,"He wouldn’t have been the solution either, he has major drawbacks as a striker. Hard to believe he would have flopped more than Morata, but he has all the ingredients of horrible ball control and insecurity that led to Morata’s downfall. Unfortunately even with those 2 and their faults, there really aren’t lots of better strikers around in their generation. I hope Abraham can continue progressing here and be our man up top"
chelseafc,fnfev9f,t1_fimeylh,1586906716.0,"Looking back to this comment I realized I totally didn’t get across what I meant. When I said he isn’t, I meant that to being a modern fullback. He is (was?) definitely undroppable. Love Azpi. In other news man I miss the PL"
AskReddit,fnf5bfa,t1_fne5y6n,1586901676.0,"Oh man with the music going off as soon as the object gets thrown through the poster, such an amazing moment"
AskReddit,fn8acx2,t1_fn706sr,1586737277.0,"I think a lot of the artists of the Renaissance and the Classical Greek period wouldn’t be too surprised. By most accounts they knew that they were living in historically amazing artistic times and knew they were the best of their respective generation. During the Renaissance, they were creating works with the goal of it lasting over hundreds of years, and putting hidden messages in the artwork that were not meant for the patrons at all"
nextfuckinglevel,fn1x7tt,t1_fn1usyc,1586572297.0,You’re not wrong but you could have definitely been more polite about it... not to mention the comments main point still stands that we have very narrow boundaries to live in. Just his altitude was off
UCI,fmv93w8,t1_fmv7erc,1586409462.0,Nice try UCI PD
soccer,fmmkovh,t1_fmlzmla,1586207028.0,"I’m so tired of people comparing players to Messi and Ronaldo. Furlough was a great player no doubt about it, but he was nowhere near that caliber. He literally didn’t even have a left foot, constantly at odds with playing staff, and the fans hated him. He was a player who belonged to the lower divisions and should have never had a shot at the prem. Liverpool let him go thankfully and Tottenham were the only ones deluded enough to sign him"
chelseafc,fmdvnb4,t1_fmdeoq0,1585979439.0,He also had a great game vs Benfica when we played them in CL group stages
