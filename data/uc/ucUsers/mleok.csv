As it is, almost every university has instituted faculty and staff hiring freezes, some have instituted furloughs, and layoffs are likely to be on the horizon. Many small private colleges which are tuition-dependent will not survive this crisis, and state universities have already had to grapple with diminishing state support prior to this crisis.

Most other solutions involving multiple boards either yields a video that has too low resolution to resolve the writing on multiple boards, or requires a camera operator to pan the camera.

I do find that it is easier to point to material I had written previously on the board, as opposed to using an iPad Pro with an Apple Pencil, as there is no simple way to draw focus to a prior point without drawing on the screen, which I think is less effective than pointing to something. More importantly, since I don’t have an audience when I am recording the lecture asynchronously, standing and delivering the lecture on the board allows me to deliver the lecture with more energy and enthusiasm, as opposed to sitting down and writing on an iPad.

I also break the lectures into smaller topics, so they are easier to replay if students need to review a topic again."

UCSD,fnwyecr,t1_fnwwe75,1587327892.0,"As it is, labs are already staggering the work hours of graduate students and postdocs in order to maintain social distancing. But, as you say, it depends on the size of the lab, and if you already have a working relationship with them, then it's much more likely that they'll allow you to continue working with them. But, I think it's only fair to say that opportunities will likely be reduced.

But, the point remains that these research opportunities are largely disjoint from the question of whether the university will be open for in-person instruction in the Fall. The one caveat is that if the campus is on total lockdown, so that only essential personnel are allowed, then undergraduate researchers will likely be excluded from campus. But, even through this entire crisis, we have not been in total campus lockdown, although some of my colleagues at other institutions have been prevented from accessing their offices and labs."
UCSD,fnwxisn,t1_fnpotsn,1587327400.0,"As a professor, I agree that it would be a logistical nightmare. As it currently stands, only some of the huge lecture halls are videocast ready,

[https://podcast.ucsd.edu/info/computers.aspx](https://podcast.ucsd.edu/info/computers.aspx)

with the rest only having the ability to capture the screen or audio. So, at the very least, a large number of lecture halls and seminar rooms will have to be upgraded with videocasting capabilities.

Even if they did upgrade these facilities, the delivery will still end up being optimized for either in-person or remote delivery. For remote instruction, most of the faculty are currently using tablets to write on slides, or delivering hand-written lectures on slides, or with document cameras. I'm personally using a single whiteboard, with the board in fixed frame in the video. These approaches yield high resolution videos for remote viewing, but which might be sub-optimal for in-person lectures.

Conversely, if I were to revert to what I normally do in an in-person lecture, which is to use multiple boards to construct my argument, that would be very difficult to view remotely, as the video would have to track my movement across the stage and multiple boards. There is some new AI based video systems which attempt to do this tracking automatically, and it isn't bad, but hardly perfect, and the image quality will be poorer, as one would have to frame the camera on all four boards simultaneously.

Finally, I will say that remote instruction consumes far more time than delivering lectures in-person, and this is partially compensated by the fact that we no longer have to commute to campus. Trying to deliver courses remotely and in-person simultaneously, will increase this workload even further, while compromising the quality of delivery that would have been possible had we simply chosen one or the other. I expect that there will be substantial pushback from the faculty if this was attempted.

What might be more realistic is if some courses (or sections) were offered remotely, and some were offered in-person.

It is true that my opinions on this issue are strongly influenced by the fact that I'm in a discipline that is typically delivered on the board, as opposed to one which is typically delivered using computer slides. I think it would be much easier to simultaneously offer in-person and remote classes for fields which rely on computer slides for their lectures.

The devil is in the details."

In particular, if they have health conditions that would make it hazardous for them to offer in-person classes while the pandemic continues to rage, then this would likely be covered under the ADA as a reasonable accommodation.

I have seen how much we have spent as a department on going to remote instruction, and I can only imagine how much more we would have to spend to regularly disinfect the physical space if we are to also simultaneously offer in-person instruction. In particular, I've seen over the years the level of custodial services drop dramatically as a cost-saving measure.

Most of our physical lecture halls do not have full video podcasting capability, and the ability to automatically capture multiple boards effectively is still in its infancy. Currently, only some of the big lecture halls have screen or audio capture, and if you have seen how most professors are currently delivering content remotely, it is primarily being done on computer tablets. So, this technological infrastructure needs to be upgraded, not just for lecture halls, but for seminar rooms as well, and this would be a  major investment in infrastructure.

Put another way, delivering content simultaneous in-person and remotely, is going to be suboptimal for one or both of these mediums. I understand you sincerely hope that we'll be back to in-person instruction in the Fall, but realistically this is not going to happen if we also have to support remote delivery of content in all courses. What is perhaps slightly more realistic is that some course sections are delivered remotely, and some are delivered in-person.

But, most of our faculty are on the older side, and quite honestly, I doubt anyone wants to risk their health delivering  their lectures in-person unless we get to a point where testing is rampant, community spread is virtually eliminated, and we can rely on contact tracking to effectively limit infection spread.

We have our families to consider and protect as well, and while delivering content remotely isn't optimal, I think we would do an even poorer job if we were asked to simultaneously deliver content both in-person and remotely. Being forced to deliver material remotely can be justified by the public health risks of not doing so, being asked to do both in-person and remote instruction simultaneously cannot be similarly justified, and would receive overwhelming pushback from the faculty."

What we are providing is remote instruction, where the instructor to student ratios remain the same as a traditional course, and the TA to student ratios remain the same. This is actually more expensive than delivering course content in person, due to the increased need for technology.

My department, for example, has acquired tablets, webcams, document cameras, and microphones for all the faculty who are teaching, at quite a substantial cost.

Given the economic impact of the pandemic, it's likely that state funding for higher education will be cut further, so the tuition sticker price will likely go up further. But, a significant amout of this will be returned to students in the form of financial aid. In practice, there is a differential pricing strategy, and the international students, out-of-state students, and the rare few in-state students paying the full sticker price, are subsiziding the vast majority of in-state students who receive some form of finanical aid through the Blue and Gold Opportunity Program and the Middle Class Scholarship Program."

It's perhaps a bit different if these different skills allow you to pursue a compelling interdisciplinary research direction, but as was mentioned, one needs to be able to tell a compelling story that ties the various threads together. Also, while many research institutions wish to pursue interdisplinary research directions, keep in mind that hiring is still primarily done at the departmental level, so unless there is a targeted interdisciplinary search, because it is a a field that is very well funded, getting hired as a interdisciplinary researcher can be challenging as well.
