UCSD,fpje8k9,t1_fpccm9d,1588665301.0,"I was also a transfer between R SD and D (I can tell by June SIR), I have to say the stimulation from studying bio here has kept my focus and actually made me want to learn. I can‚Äôt say the same or UCR as I‚Äôve never been. Housing IS guaranteed for your 2 years. It should have said so somewhere in your pdf‚Äôs. The department itself I‚Äôve had no problems with. The SOM has some engagement stuff but I haven‚Äôt been. It‚Äôs extremely hard to get into, it being a T20 med school and all... but it is on campus and you could get a med student mentor if you‚Äôre a tiny bit lucky"

UCSD,fpjdqqv,t1_fpjdeat,1588664804.0,"Preparation for med school is real clinical volunteering (or even better, a clinical job), and the MCAT. I wouldn‚Äôt say it‚Äôs hard to get a 3.5, but I also happen to score a standard deviation above the mean usually. So if you‚Äôre an average student that would put you at a 3.2 at least. You can try to adjust the rigor of your quarter to what medschool would feel like (like me taking 26 stem units this quarter), but that does nothing but hurt your GPA and make you stressed. 
I would say all the MCAT material is covered by taking MCB so in that was it is a good prep, but as a freshman you won‚Äôt be taking MCB specific classes until soph/junior year (upper division classes).
I‚Äôm sorry if you check my comment history you‚Äôll find I ramble a lot. If I missed any questions lmk and I‚Äôll try to answer them straightforwardly."

But you well definitely have fun if you‚Äôre looking for it. As for making friends, you just need to put yourself out there a bit and be friendly and then wouldn‚Äôt you know it, you‚Äôll have friends. As the other commentor stated, people at UCSD are generally here for the grind towards graduate school or other better and greater things so you won‚Äôt find to be friends milling about in open spaces every day of every week of the quarter (but you likely would find them week 0-2 or Fridays). As for the other negative experiences, you‚Äôll find them anywhere you go, be it university or life. I haven‚Äôt had these negative experiences myself and can possibly attribute that to being able to steer clear based off ucsdredditor flagging of said experiences. 
All in all, the negatives live in some truth, but you‚Äôll find the extremes here on reddit like you said."
UCSD,fpj5knx,t1_fpixtaa,1588657251.0,"Hi, I‚Äôm bio. I‚Äôm saying bio is easier than physics, math, and engineering. It does build off of what you know from previous classes though and your ability to critically think as to not have to memorize as much. 
Unfortunately evolution tends to choose the easy way which leads to weird pathways. And scientists love to name shit after themselves or in a certain order of discovery and never go back and amend it. I‚Äôve taken a bunch of Hum bio classes though and they‚Äôve all been great. Good luck OP and focus a lot GPA if you can."

I think the points you make are quite salient. No one knows how the dice are going to land, but if everyone quarantines then this will more or less blow over sooner."
UCSD,fnkcsvw,t3_g2a4tv,1587022317.0,"You pay by unit, about $280 per. So as a non-MGT major all I can say is looks expensive. 
Edit 1: Good on you though to personally develop and horizingly broaden!
Edit 2: the common sentiment is that each unit you take during summer feels like twice as much in a redials quarter. So those 3x4 unit classes will feel like 24 (theoretically, I don‚Äôt know for sure when taking it being lower div and MGT into account) and for good measure, my taking 16 bio classes feels not great (20 would be hell) in a normal quarter. That being said, I came to this lovely school as a transfer and took bipn 134 and bimm 100 during my first summer session. I would say it felt like 14 units. My point is try not to overextend yourself coming in, you might need to adjust more than you think. Then again you know yourself best, and I‚Äôm not very good at giving advice sorry.
