socialskills,foh5m41,t3_g79gfr,1587760803.0,"I could possibly be the count meter of how much you assume you're helping people compared to how much they think they are being helped. With that said, if you're helping people and expecting something in return that's not ""helping"" that's ""investing"" in your future disappointment."

unpopularopinion,fmr52as,t3_fws1e5,1586314058.0,"The sticker price isn't always about the education you get, it's also for the access. Rubbing shoulders with people who have connections is sometimes more beneficial than having a good GPA."
unpopularopinion,fmqmoab,t1_fmpiiwf,1586302642.0,This is probably the best response and I completely agree. It's for the boys to get together one last time before every other time the husband-to-be has to flake on plans with the boys because they got married.

I dry my shrooms by leaving them out to air dry for 18 to 24 hrs in front of a fan. After that, i place them on an aluminum tray inside of a small tote with silica balls."
unpopularopinion,fmnpge5,t3_fw4hs9,1586231708.0,"Those themes aren't for you, they are for your kids so they don't grow up ignoring the overall theme of representation just because you don't like it."
UCSD,fmmz0p5,t3_fw7kav,1586214799.0,"Seems like the same amount of work we're just reminded about it soo much that it seems overwhelming. Like, every change to the class or the syllabus we get an email so it begins to feel overwhelming. Most professors are pretty lenient about it too seems like a lot of people are scared to reach out; they're making this up as they go along so if you think it really is too much say something otherwise they might think they're on the right track."
NoStupidQuestions,fmdvg2a,t3_funbfk,1585979242.0,"There is a philosophy of ""whatever means necessary,"" so if you feel it is necessary go for it. But on the real it's an honor and pride thing. Its best to settle it man to man (woman to man?) and take the win or the loss how you will and move on."
