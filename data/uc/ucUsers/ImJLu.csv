They were once balanced out by range (ricochet rounds notwithstanding), but Bungie, in their infinite wisdom, basically normalized ranges across HC archetypes when they nerfed the ranges, making LW frames the best at basically everything.

From a PC perspective at least, they were once kept in check by Ace, NF, and TLW, but now that they nerfed Mori, killed Ace's range advantage, and made NF and TLW total garbage relative to meta stuff, there's nothing keeping SR/DP/WV/Thorn from being the only relevant HCs in the entire game."

modernwarfare,fpelizu,t1_fpeiksp,1588549875.0,"I don't have plat for the Bruen (but I do have it maxed).  I like how fast you can make it re: movement speed, but I think it's a lot less consistent - if you make it fast, the recoil is less controllable than the SA87, and the SA87 has the perk of 3HKing to all regions while the Bruen (and PKM, and MG34, etc) only 3 hits to the upper torso.

So with the SA87, you can easily laser people and 3 hit them anywhere for a <200ms TTK.  While if you hit 3 upper chest shots, the other LMGs kill faster, hitting anything else slows the TTK down to M4 levels or slower, which I don't think is worth it.  It's absurdly unlikely to consistently only hit upper torso shots, especially against MP5 bunnyhoppers whose upper torso is constantly moving up and down.

Before the season 2 patch, when the SA87 only 3HKed to the upper torso, I'd consider it probably the worst LMG, but multiple recoil reductions along with having by far the best non-upper-torso damage of the LMGs make it the best IMO."
modernwarfare,fpefrq9,t1_fpe5vpd,1588546697.0,"If you want the <195ms TTK out to 40m+ without the dreadfully slow ADS and movement of most people's builds, I'd recommend 12.4"" barrel, commando, muzzle, stippled, and your red dot of choice.  Pretty sure the 12.4"" barrel still erroneously reduces recoil, so that's nice.

If you can moderately pull down, it's a laser even at long ranges (commando + muzzle basically eliminates the side to side bounce that throws you off target), and the TTK and range are great.

It's still relatively slow and the ADS strafe and reload are pretty awful, but it's honestly one of my favorite guns even at high SBMM.  I'm going to pretend it's one of the best weapons in the game, but I like it a lot, and I think it's definitely the best LMG (and I have plat LMGs).

The only downside is that you unlock the key attachment (12.4"" barrel) really late, and I'm pretty sure stippled and the ADS stock are pretty late too.  I'd imagine you didn't set a blueprint with them before the latest blueprint bug got patched, but popping a weapon 2xp token this weekend (if they still stack with event 2xp) and hopping into shipment should level it up in a few games anyways."

R6ProLeague,fp464u5,t1_fp3efsl,1588292451.0,"I think there's definitely a reasonable argument for operators that promote degenerate gameplay to be drastically underpowered.

It depends on the degree of counterplay.  An operator like old Glaz was competitively unhealthy because there wasn't enough outplay potential.  Regardless of your skill, you lose to Glaz through a smoke every single time.  Expression of skill occurs through outplaying people, and not being able to out-skill something reduces the impact of skill on the game.  That's definitely not competitive.

So I think it's a fair argument that these binary operators, where either it's a free win for them or a free win for the other team (to an extent - ex. Glaz being at a clear disadvantage in a non-smoke gunfight), are competitively unhealthier when they're useful than when they're entirely unviable instead.

Ying kinda falls into this category - if she can flash someone, she gets free kills, but if she can't, she's a pretty mediocre to shit operator.  It basically comes down to rock-paper-scissorsing her with Jager/Warden than actually outplaying her."
