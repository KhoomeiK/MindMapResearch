ThreePedals,fpm8v4h,t3_ge9b67,1588727940.0,"I've struggled with this too. Learned stick on my 2017 Civic Hatch. This is a problem in all 10th gen civics, and it's caused by a few different things, from what I've experienced myself and read on forums. The lower gears are higher ratios, as other people mentioned, so the engine's movement more sharply affects the wheels. In addition, the throttle pedal seems to not have any sensitivity between around 5% throttle and 0% throttle, which means that whenever you're switching between a light touch and off-throttle the car will rubberband between those two settings and jerk all over the place. As far as anybody can tell it's an ECU/sensor problem and not really driver error.

How I drive around it is I try to always apply a little bit of throttle in lower gears, to sort of keep the engine out of jerk mode. Also, consider keeping 3rd gear at lower speeds, it will smooth things out more as long as you are gentle on throttle. Similarly 2nd gear in parking lots with a bit of clutch here and there can be smoother than staying in first for the whole time.

As for downshifts to 3rd or 2nd, always aim for an over-rev if you can't match exactly. You get a big jerk if your rpm is under the correct ratio when you clutch in.

Sounds like you're doing great so far!"

The stock throttle pedal location is just a little too far for heel-toe with smaller feet, and the shifter upgrades (from a basic short shift extension to a full shifter assembly) get the shift feel closer to what the solid linkage Honda shifters felt like."

If you see a message at the bottom of the screen saying ""Watch Rewards are set up for your account"" that means you're getting credit for that game. You can check if you've watched a game fully by going to ""VODS"". If the system has registered that you've watched a game, the little icon under that game will be gold. If you haven't watched it, it will be grey. All regular season vods from LCK, LCS, and LEC count. I haven't tested LPL or OCE.

For me, I just put on LCK every night and let it run. 2-3 games every series and 3 series a day makes it easy to rack up points (they're only playing 2 series a day for more days a week during coronavirus). I watched some LCS occasionally."
AutoDetailing,fmxq9ba,t1_fmxjkcz,1586469781.0,"I have a Civic hatch and I've put back on my car cover since I'm parked beneath a pine tree temporarily. In my case I think some small scuff spots are a worthwhile tradeoff for not having to clean pine needles out of the wiper channels every week. For what it's worth I haven't noticed any scratches on my car, but I have silver paint.

The quality of the car cover matters a lot, especially how well it fits. The tighter it fits your car, the less chance of it rubbing from wind. I got mine from Duckcovers. Honda also sells model-specific covers that would probably fit very well."
