trees,fpc8qbs,t1_fpc7s1y,1588491471.0,"It is a good amount depending on your tolerance I guess. I took 250 once even though I had been messing around with edibles for a week or two before that and I got slammed. I just remember being awake intermittently and having trouble walking. I just slept for who knows how long and to this day I can’t recall if I took them in the morning or night let alone remember any sort of semblance of a timeline.

DebateAVegan,fpc3nta,t1_fpbcjff,1588486557.0,"> I think that if you identify with the vegan mission and honestly are trying to abide by the criteria of essentially staying the fuck out of other animals lives “as far as possible and practicable”


I think that the “vegan police” are trying to make essentially this point, i.e. one is Vegan if one holds the moral position that Veganism entails. 


> Unless you are an idiot that thinks chicken and fish don’t count as meat or that veganism includes eating dairy (vegetarianism) or you don’t pay attention to if non-food items are vegan.

The latter issue, the purchasing/use of non-food non-vegan products, is a good way of understanding the point that many are trying to make in regards to what it means to be Vegan. If someone’s diet consists entirely of non-animal foods because of health issues but they continued to purchase leather goods then they would, under your view as outlined here and the view of many others, not technically be considered Vegan. 


One reason to care about labels and the meaning of terms is to maintain the meaningfulness of terms and systems of thought, moral positions, whatever. Of course when discussing terms with others I think we should be open and approachable and refrain from being didactic and vegan police like."

vegan,foyn9l9,t1_foyfabu,1588175583.0,"Yes, this impersonal viewing of the lambs is probably at play here in the way you describe but people when not viewed under the scope of a macro level analysis are unique individuals with their own lives. Similarly, although these lambs may be viewed as just another commodity or meal under the scope of commodity production, the amount of revenue generated for the farmer, etc. they are conscious sentient beings with their own interests and lives as well. I think you can argue that they are not being treated bad or not that bad because of certain features like flexibility or that the farmer indeed does care for their well being to an extent( I disagree with both these reasonings) but I’d suggest trying to place yourself in the position of one of these lambs.
Try to imagine what it would be like to have your ear clipped and your tail clipped. How would
this make you feel? What about being killed? I think you do a good job pointing out the impersonal analytic view of people and animals under certain lenses, e.g. the statisticians or politicians view, the profit driven farmers view, but I would argue that if we step away from that for a second as we must do if we want to gauge the well being and impact of political policies upon people then that’s gets us closer to thinking about whether such treatments are justifiable for non human animals."

PhilosophyMemes,fo5jsx9,t1_fo5hlil,1587527382.0,"What would it mean for him to “believe” in induction if it’s something that can’t be proven from either reason alone or experience?

For example, the natural sciences seem to end up on shaky grounds (if any) on Hume’s view yet doesn’t Hume still have some confidence in the natural sciences, how? I know he remains confident of math because it follows from the principle of non contradiction but I can’t remember how he “saves” science if at all."

DebateAVegan,fnntoqp,t3_g2cj27,1587101411.0,"One way to view equality in terms of Veganism is equality as equality of consideration. Non human animals are on par, i.e. equal, with humans in regards to the consideration by others they impose on others by virtue of their sentience. This is not to say that this means that humans have the same moral status as non human animals but to say that both are equal in the sense that both have considerations, e.g. avoidance of suffering, that must be considered by anyone who can impact them. So if we were to face some moral dilemma, at the outset we could recognize “ ok both these beings are capable of suffering and capable of being greatly harmed”. This is to recognize that human and non human animals both have interests that both need to be equally considered but doesn’t prevent one from investigating further details and finally making a decision."

changemyview,fmre8ki,t1_fmq0wb0,1586320687.0,">Philosophising about ethics does not matter that much.

Your own thinking on morality and ingroup-outgroup moral considerations seem to point to the contrary. Furthermore, the claim itself is a claim *about* ethics so in that regards it matters to whatever pertinent conclusion you want to draw from it. 

If you are going to exclude from your moral domain those beings/things, etc. that fall under your outgroup category then you have to demarcate the outlines of your ingroup category, i.e. humans, and why basing a moral system on that is preferable to any other, e.g. a moral system revolving around sentience.  If you address marginal cases, e.g. those individuals who can't hold conversations with others, by claiming that they are covered under the moral domain because they are still part of the group of humans, albeit ones who can't hold conversations, you still have to mark out the category of being human. But even then, can we not imagine some aliens from another planet with a similar moral system but whose ingroup is aliens and thus would result in humans as an outgroup and as havings the same status as dogs have in your moral system with your ingroup as humans?

changemyview,fmqlw91,t1_fmn6uah,1586302192.0,I think you are misunderstanding what Tilbaltdidnothinwrong is getting at. See my response to wallnumber above.
changemyview,fmqlmqm,t1_fmn453q,1586302046.0,"I don't think Tibaltdidnothinwrong is equating the life of a dog and a human but trying to get at morally relevant differences in characteristics (here in regards to personhood) that would allow for the killing of one and not the other. So when you say that humans are ""deserving of our love and our help"" but that non-human animals are ""deserving of our love and help *when possible*"" Tibaltdidnothinwrong would pose the question as to what the morally relevant differences between the two species are such that non-human animals are not entitled to as strong obligations of ""our love and our help."""
