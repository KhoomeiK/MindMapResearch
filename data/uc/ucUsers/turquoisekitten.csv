AskWomen,foyp6iw,t1_foyie97,1588176603.0,"I wonder if you went on a busy day or it has changed in the past few years? When I went the line wasn't too long and the decor was nice, so we got our drinks and walked with them outside and it was really nice actually. Although I will agree many other coffee shops are as good (most are better)."
UCSD,fosraqz,t3_g92od5,1588036424.0,I'm also in my last quarter and pretty sure I just failed a quiz today. Even being pass/no pass I am really struggling especially with the social distancing. I just feel overwhelmed everyday.

UCSD,fmpo1n7,t3_fwopo4,1586284255.0,"I don't know what other people are doing, but back when I was a sophomore looking for off campus housing I used the UCSD off campus housing Facebook page and craigslist, which always have new posts/places any time of the year. You can also call the major apartment complexes in the area and see when they are having housing contracts end. Hope that helps!"
