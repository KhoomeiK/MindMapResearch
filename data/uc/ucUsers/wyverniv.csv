Elektron,fpmp4xx,t3_ge4p64,1588738131.0,"How important is polyphony to you? Digitakt and Octatrack mainly sequence single notes or block chords at a time and doing things like a piano roll isn't the easiest. If you're mainly looking to sequence drums, lead or bass they're pretty good though. Other options are the deluge, beatstep pro, and the MPCs (Live, One)"

Some of my favorite synth sounds are the supersaw, the hip hop sub bass (ableton) and the overdriven sinewave with glide that your hear from a lot of modular synths."

Elektron,fp0h8nb,t1_fp0b8sp,1588209223.0,yes except that for the digitakt you should be using overbridge and not ableton's external instrument plugin to get audio and send midi. Set the midi track with the overbridge vst to accept midi from all ins.

one good option for avant- grade weird is a used digitakt, they’re a little past your budget but the combination of being able to res ample and the pretty flexible audio engine lets you get pretty weird very easily."
synthesizers,foz04mi,t1_foyznx6,1588182368.0, check the program change and bank messages in the digitakt’s midi track and make sure those are set to not transmit. also try making sure the TD3 is on a blank pattern with no notes.
synthesizers,foyzo29,t1_foxw1d0,1588182136.0,"one really annoying thing about midi controllers and the digitakt is that the DT doesn’t transmit pitch bend, mod wheel or after touch to synths if you’re using an external midi device. it can send the messages if you lock them from the sequencer but it doesn’t transmit the messages from your controller."
synthesizers,foyz4jc,t1_foyk2t1,1588181856.0,"another good budget option from the scarlet is the behringer umc404HD. 4 inputs and outputs, dedicated midi ports, powered via usb or dc jack and you usually find them used for about $100."
synthesizers,foyxmbt,t1_foys9nv,1588181074.0,make sure the digitakt is sending on the same midi channel that the synth you’re trying to control is receiving on. The digitakt can send midi messages on multiple channels so keep that in mind.
synthesizers,foyx6yw,t3_gabtv0,1588180849.0,You’re going to get much better quality if you record the audio separately from the phone either with an interface or with some controller. That and then use a tripod or something else to hold the camera for you in one position.

It's a great machine! I'm using it right now to make bootleg remixes of songs that I can add fx to with the crossfader. You can always post here if (more like when) you get stuck and someone will most likely be able to help you. :)"

Elektron,fotg2g7,t3_g9ebo7,1588052890.0,"I think it depends on if you want the ability to tweak everything easily vs. almost everything easily. The digitakt has a page system that's fast but probably not as fast as the model samples. The sound engine on the DT is really flexible though, and the ability to sample external sources + resample itself means that you'll always be able to generate/capture new material."
filtersweep,fosg5fi,t1_fosaw32,1588030057.0,"i held off on getting monitors for a super long time because i was satisfied it’s how things sounded in my headphones but getting actual studio monitors was much more comfortable to mix on for long periods of time and lets you “feel” the bass a bit more, so to speak. totally was worth it."

engineering,fopkpha,t1_fopjo6d,1587964086.0,"I think comparing bridge/building engineering to software engineering is not a good analogy. The cost to build structures that hold humans inside of them is enormous and it has a very real human cost when that building fails and falls down. Most software doesn't need to be held to that high level of scrutiny, so the quality doesn't need to be rigorously vetted."
filtersweep,fomjgwi,t1_fofqhka,1587892319.0,"Since a lot of my hardware is samplers and I don’t have too many polysynths, I’m always having to make these. 

if you have a monosynth, try detuning the oscillators to make a chord and playing with that. 

another things that’s really helped me is picking up some good synth sample packs so that I’m ready to go without having to make a bunch of chords from scratch. Legowelt has some good ones on his site, I’ve really been digging the JV1080 sound as of late."
