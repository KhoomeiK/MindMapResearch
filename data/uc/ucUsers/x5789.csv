I suggested going with a more modest and simpler approach like getting a condo, and you suggested buying 3 investments out of state to *still* buy the million dollar home.

this isnt the investing sub, the average person isnt gonna jump through that many hoops to buy a much larger home, though in reality just remain hopeless and rent for life when they could've gotten their foot in the door with a more modest property."

RealEstate,fpmxcv7,t1_fpmq65d,1588744207.0,"people are definitely picky. I'm in southern california, and folks talk about all the homes that cost 700K - 1MM, and completely ignore the condos you can get in the 300-500K range. Yes you're not gonna get everything, but most folks I talk to always seem to want a SFH with a garage and a big backyard and all the bells and whistles, when there's perfectly reasonable 2 bedroom condos with a decent patio that are attainable for those same folks."
RealEstate,fpmwxqd,t1_fpmvuau,1588743898.0,"you still gotta pay mortgage insurance with conventional if its under 20%. Its just that with FHA the mortgage insurance won't drop off automatically, and you'll have to refinance out of it"

Luckily a week later I got a fully remote job that will let me stay in SD I've been remarkably blessed."

RealEstate,fnqq9d0,t3_g3aw4c,1587169860.0,"Where’s your husband in all of this? I don’t see his income included anywhere. 

You also need to readjust your expectations. The new starter home is a condo, so look at those that are in the 400-500k range. A single family also has much higher maintenance costs, even if your condo has an hoa. 

You don’t need 20% down, you can do FHA 3.5 down or 5% down convenital. 

Assuming you make 160k collectively, you should easily be able to afford a spot for 400k. 

Especially in SoCal, your first home doesn’t have to be a dream place. Get your foot in the door and trade up down the line to a nicer place. 

Just my thoughts lol."
