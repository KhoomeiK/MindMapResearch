AskReddit,fn8yngv,t3_g0c3dg,1586753890.0,"this is not an open-ended question, but i'm in the mood to answer it.

if your larynx is open (allowing you to inhale/exhale air), there's two things that can be happening: 1) you're blowing little enough air that you're vocalizing, or 2) you're blowing enough that it's passing by your vocal folds without voicing. if you want to clear your throat, you cant do the typical soft exhale, because you want to get the shit off of your vocal folds. you want some turbulence. that means the vocal folds are gonna get some vibration, because they're not wide open letting air pass through."

mentalhealth,fn8k8x1,t3_fzzup6,1586743549.0,"this seems to happen to a lot of people your age, because most people your age are immature and dont know how to handle a friend who needs help. when i was that age i didnt really have friends because everyone around me was an idiot. which wasnt healthy at all because i didnt get to enjoy life during adolescence. so beware that that can happen. but theres also no point in trying to be friends with jackasses who dont wanna hang out with you, so theres not always a good answer.

you can try telling people how you feel, but be aware that they might not have the skills or knowlege to help you, and they might react poorly. the ability to keep secrets is a valuable skill, and it can help you in the course of your life a lot. it requires willpower."

schizophrenia is a complex with a lot of symptoms to it. delusions are one, but there's plenty of delusional people who aren't schizophrenic. here are some questions that might help you make an educated guess at her condition:

are her thoughts and sentences disorganized and hard to follow?

does she have a flat affect?

does she have sleep problems?

does she hallucinate (especially auditory hallucinations)?

yes to all of these would make it much more likely she qualifies for a schizophrenia diagnosis.

you can probably look up examples of all of these on youtube if you wanna see what they look like in diagnosed cases, so you have something to compare it to."
