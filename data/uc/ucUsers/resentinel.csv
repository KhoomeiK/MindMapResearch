It still sounds like you're excusing their crimes. ""If these guys could handle rejection and were sexually satisfied and could hold their urges they wouldnt go and rape women"" makes it sound like something besides the perpetrators were to blame. There are plenty of rejected, horny people who don't go around gang raping and murdering others."

menwritingwomen,fomna2g,t1_fommp9h,1587896569.0,"Certainly. I've met a couple myself. But to present it as a ""woman translator"" implies that all women mean habitually mean the opposite of what they say, which is a sexist stereotype.  


Edit: I'm very likely telling you something you already know (and if that's the case, I apologize). I think the character's usage of a ""woman translator"" that labels all women's speech as x stereotype suggests that the author is sexist. That sexism may come from the author having a stereotypical view of women, which in turn may come from never really knowing one/ never seeing them as humans who aren't all the same. Saying that the author has never met a woman in his life is probably an exaggeration, but that seems to be the joke."

On the coastlines it seems to be a rare seasonal thing, whether from light pollution or other factors. Otherwise people would probably hear more about it."

WhitePeopleTwitter,fn7shd3,t1_fn7qjs3,1586726724.0,"But ""single"" can also mean unaccompanied, which is what I think OP meant. Single does have multiple meanings, but introducing the concept of this person ""in a relationship"" without any prior context wouldn't make sense.     

Arguing about the interpretation of a word wasn't on my to-do list for today, so I'll take my leave now. Have a nice day & wash your hands often"

The first is about people who chose to have families but complain about them. The second is about people with families who one-up other people's problems by saying they suffer more. I was referring to the first line, and it appears you're referring to the second line. I think both of our opinions are valid, and that they don't contradict each other."
