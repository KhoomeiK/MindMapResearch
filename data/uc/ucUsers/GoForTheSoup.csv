UCSD,fpjsjmv,t1_fpj8o6k,1588679769.0,"Np, Also I'm gunna have to disagree with what the guy said above about bio being super hard. In all honesty the major itself is just memorization spamming (there is of course an essence of understanding material, but really upper divs are all memorization). Therefore, if you put in the work and keep up with your classes there is no reason you shouldn't do well (B range). If you want the A you'll have to work for it."

UCSD,fpex3at,t3_gd06ja,1588556831.0,"COOPER IS THE BEST, great professor/teacher. You will obviously have to put in some work into the class. Its not an easy A class (i dont think any bio prof is for bicd100). Even though he is a young dude he has multiple different ways to teach. Also he insanely cares about his students. (Anecdote: a dude got hurt and couldnt come to a lab course he was teaching, so he would give up time (out of oh/lab hours) multiple times to get him up to speed in info and proctor quizzes)."
UCSD,fpbs9g7,t1_fpbjd1m,1588477443.0,"Ay yo real talk, the racism thing (while of course not everyone participates, and it exists at other schools) is readily noticeable throughout UCSD."
UCSD,fpbdqox,t3_gbr045,1588467672.0,"Low key depends on what kind of research you go into. I'd say popular ones are R and matlab for molecular bio to neuro bio. Python is another super popular one. (R is super easy and hella useful, so i'd rec that one the most)"
UCSD,fpazwkg,t3_gcaa40,1588459191.0,"difficulty isn't harder, just requires more dedication to the class. If anything I'd say exams are usually easier (STEM) because less material and usually less variety of questions. Since its 5 weeks trying to fit the material of 10 you are going to have to stay on track with the course material. If you miss a lecture its kinda like missing 2-2.5 lectures. So if you keep missing lecture/not paying attention it will be super difficult to catch up."
UCSD,fp24x42,t3_gakocd,1588255214.0,"Hello, esp w the pandemic going on rn you should check whatever grad school situation you are planning to go to (med school, law, etc). Ik med schools in california strictly said they will not be considering any pass/fail classes in a negative connotation during this time. Meaning its fine for you to pass/nopass anything. You don't have the same amount of time you had during regular school year so sometimes ya gotta p/np some and take a grade for what you do have time for."
UCSD,fp0inxr,t1_fp0i712,1588210038.0,"Ye, so a big thing to look at is how much time a class will take out of your day. Even if a class is easy it can still take up like 10 hrs a week from lab+lecture because labs are usually 3hrs+. then you also have to add on homework and lab reports. I did chem 7L and Bild 4 together, and Phys 2CL and Phys 2BL very not worth. 7L/2CL/2BL lab report writing took a long time, Bild 4 lab report writing is pretty quick."
UCSD,fp0hjib,t3_galfvc,1588209396.0,"Lowkey that fall quarter might not be worth. You'll have a lot of free time as a freshman but with 2 lab courses that'll go down by a decent amount. (i'm not sure if 1AL meets twice or not). Have you though of taking Ethn1 fall quarter and then bild4 spring quarter?

 That quarter's workload will really depend on you and your work ethic. BILD 4 is pretty easy, Phys 1A/1Al + Chem 6A are going to be your time sinks, and DOC 1 is all TA based for your grading."

UCSD,fnjt1f3,t1_fnjsb7t,1587006319.0,"I don't know of anything I'd recommend w ur course-load lmao, you should look up ur pre-reqs you need/what is being offered."
UCSD,fnjs242,t3_g25xul,1587005674.0,that course load is pretty hefty if you arent on top of the info every week. remember ss is still super fast compared to quarter system. If you want to add another class one I'd advise something that coincides w what ur learning in those classes for max efficiency.
UCSD,fnc2l3g,t3_g0vqpy,1586827293.0,"contact UCSD tech and maybe some academic inclusion workers to send your situation to. Software error should not be the reason you can't take a class. im not an IT type dude so all i can say is try restarting ur computer, empty cookies, redownload browser, etc. there might be a proctoru reddit forum u can look at too. srry for ur situation"
