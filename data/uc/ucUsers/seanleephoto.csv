riceuniversity,fp7859c,t3_gbjeso,1588365786.0,"My fiancé is in medicine so we have lots of friends who graduated Rice premed. If you are from Texas, staying in Texas to go to a Texas medical school is a much bigger advantage than most think. Many of our Californian friends end up taking a gap year after graduating from Rice undergrad and buying property in Texas to apply instate to Texas med schools. Incredible quality education and training for cheap! That being said, going to Duke wont change the fact you are a Texas resident and can go to apply to Texas med schools as an instate applicant. Many of my fiancé’s classmates in med school were Harvard and other Ivy grads who came back to Texas for med school (and end up going back to places like Harvard for residency). The choice in front of you really is up to you! The main advantage of Rice is that you can do research with TMC doctors and make connections and networks with Baylor and Southwestern doctors. (I also happen to think Rice is one of the best places to grow and develop into a world class scholar and a responsible member of your community.) Congratulations on your acceptances and I believe you will do wonderfully wherever you choose to go. You obviously have lots of potential, as illustrated by your admissions, and while medicine is a perilous road, it sounds like you will conquer it!"
ipad,foval0b,t3_g9kpih,1588098115.0,"I’ve had mine for a year with daily heavy use (hours a day) and mine looks just as good (and just as bad) as it did on day one. That being said, the only reason I use it is because they kept sending me free ones. Some guy in Australia with the same first and last name as me ordered one but it came to me. Then After he complained, the company sent him a new one... but that one came to me again. And again and again. I have a small collection of paperlikes that I will probably never buy a new screen protector again for my iPad."

gatech,fo9tww1,t1_fo950vs,1587631025.0,"This is really prevalent. I went to Rice and some people definitely discount my education because the school is in Texas. Fortunately, anyone who has an opinion that actually matters knows the caliber of school like Tech and Rice."
gatech,fo9tsel,t3_g6dx0p,1587630895.0,"Maybe I can give an unbiased outside perspective. I’m a few years removed from undergrad and I have never attended Georgia tech (tbh I’m not sure why I still follow this subreddit! But tech has the most entertaining memes and drama), but I promise you that your parents are anomalous. First, I want to preface that school reputation does not matter as much as you think it does before and while you’re in college. That being said, among engineering schools, Georgia tech is extremely highly regarded amongst academics and practitioners alike. Tech is in the same conversation as CMU, MIT, Stanford, Berkeley...etc. it is shocking your parents are engineers and don’t feel this way. 

I would also like to add from an outsiders perspective that Tech has a very strong reputation of being an INCREDIBLY difficult school, more so than other elite engineering schools. A 3.7 from Georgia Tech says a lot more than a 4.0 at other engineering schools. You have a lot to be proud of by being at Tech and succeeding."
math,fo9szvq,t3_g6g194,1587630102.0,"I used to work on a research team at a company with a really big data science presence (thousands of data scientists). All the research done there mostly goes in one of three places: 

1. Directly into a product or service. This is very targeted research meant to solve a specific problem. Not usually the kind of thing you see in academic research. Work done in this environment does get around the company and the best work is adopted in multiple lines of businesses. This work is usually documented via slide decks, github pages, white papers... etc. the model I used to work on was a highly complex predictive model that has wel over five hundred pages of white paper documentation. 

2. Shared internally. The company used to hold annual conferences with their thousands of data scientists and they would share their latest developments on Bayesian statistics or predictive strategies or cutting edge model designs. There is a lot of truly theoretical work that stays internal and never sees the light of day. These usually stay as slide decks and oral presentations. 

3. If the research is patentable and doesn’t expose trade secrets, it is patented. A lot of practical development that is cool but will never be used in a significant way is patented. There are big incentives for the data scientists to get their work patented because that builds the companies patent portfolio which helps with legal stuff. 

But actually, in my field, I do occasionally see research published from industry or at least in collaboration with industry. A lot of excellent operations research work came from Motorola in the early 2000s, for example. I also get to see researchers from industry come in and share their work during our weekly PhD seminars and there are many research groups in industry solving really hard problems and I get to hear about it from them."

riceuniversity,fo1mmyp,t1_fo1gudu,1587436629.0,"Hey! Congrats; you're going to have an incredible four years! It was definitely feasible when I was there; I don't know if the major requirements have changed at all though. There is a pretty significant difference in mathematical rigor, however. For example, there was an introductory analysis class that MTEC majors had to take (mathematical economics? not sure.) that was a weed-out class for the major (where many MTEC students choose to change over to ECON) but it mostly just covered the first few weeks of a sophomore level caam or math analysis class. That being said, it is a highly respected major at Rice and many of my peers went to top graduate schools for economics after completing mtec. In addition, you can get some electives from econ to fulfill requirements for caam and some caam electives to fulfill requirements for econ because there is some overlap. Its definitely doable! Just know that the math-econ is truly an econ major with some additional math skills (slightly more rigorous econometrics course, more rigorous game theory) and caam is truly an applied math major. Does that help? Feel free to PM me if you want to discuss more!"

Leica,fn51uzw,t3_fzmd1e,1586653942.0,"A few years ago I bought a decent condition m4-p for $650. A freshly CLA’d one should be more expensive, but I have a feeling $1300 might be too much. I got my M6 for that much 

That being said, the m4-p was awesome and I miss it."
riceuniversity,fn4teqd,t3_fzjf41,1586648570.0,"I went in thinking I wanted to study economics. I realized very quickly that many successful academic economists are mathematicians and all of them have strong backgrounds in mathematics. For example, the nobel prize for economics recipients in 2012 were Alvin Roth (who had a background in operations research) and Lloyd Shapley, a well known mathematician. In fact, their work on kidney exchanges was one of my very first influences and motivations for studying economics. 

I ended up adding a CAAM major (in addition to the math econ) so I could follow their footsteps. I had always loved math but didn't really expect to become a mathematician. After undergrad, I worked for a few years but am now happy to be pursuing my PhD in operations research and will hopefully eventually make contributions to the same applications that inspired me in the first place. 

Your professor is right: your academic interests will change, especially if you are intellectually honest to yourself and allow yourself to explore and be open minded. Its a blast; cut out the noise and don't let people influence your decision on what to study based on what is or isn't ""prestigious""."
riceuniversity,fmv8jxq,t3_fxil7g,1586409012.0,"I was a CAAM major at Rice and I enjoyed my experience. CAAM 210 is nothing like what the rest of the department is like. I am currently doing a PhD in operations research and here are some of my thoughts about my experience:

**Coursework**

The coursework in the CAAM major are diverse across the field of applied mathematics. During my time I got a thorough training in differential equations, substantial training in mathematical programming/optimization (linear, nonlinear, some integer), and exposure to different applications (ex. I really enjoyed the intro to operations research course. Also took a dynamical systems class that looked at applications in neuroscience taught by a joint faculty from BCOM).

The actual work is about 50/50 coding and proofs, both pretty rigorously. 

The quality of instructors can be a little hit and miss, but lately there have been lots of really great lecturers including Schaefer (who is a huge name in the field; everywhere I go people ask me if I knew him), younger faculty like Chan (really great lecturer), De Hoop. If you are interested in graduate school, get to know Schaefer well. He is the bomb.

The research in the department I think is pretty traditional applied math (while I was there, it seemed differential equations was the emphasis, but I was a clueless undergrad so maybe not)

Again, I just want to emphasize that CAAM 210 is not reflective of the rest of the major... at all. And I say that having really liked CAAM 210! If you want to get a flavor of the major, take CAAM 378 with Schaefer, but don't blame me if you fall in love with Operations Research like I did. If you like that class, take CAAM 471; that is a very rigorous presentation of linear and integer programming at a graduate level but presented very well.

**Post-grad Opportunities**

If you want to go into industry, I don't think you really need to concern yourself with the quality of the department. Just work hard, get good grades, and interview well. You'll do great.

If you want to go to graduate school, the people in my graduating class from the CAAM department are currently at the following institutions:

* Princeton ORFE PhD
* MIT ORC PhD
* Yale CS PhD
* Johns Hopkins MDPHD
* Berkeley IEOR PhD (that's me!)
* Columbia Finance MS

And that is just people from my graduating class. My classmates who went to industry have had great jobs at Two Sigma and Google and the like.

Feel free to PM me if you want to discuss any more!!"
gatech,fmtmi36,t1_fbdkp52,1586375276.0,Have there been any updates on this? Very curious...
riceuniversity,fmbfrnm,t3_fu8try,1585925470.0,"I was a Rice undergrad and doing my PhD at a public school that is notorious for being competitive, not collaborative. I’ll try to summarize my experience at Rice vs the things I’ve seen among the undergrads at my current institution. 

Where I am now, you just have to work really hard and do everything by yourself. Not really sure how to install python packages? Find all the YouTube videos and online guides. Missed a day of notes? Better read the textbook. It’s a place where you feel bad asking people to do things for you and where you are annoyed if you have to do anything for others. Academics are a competition and it’s not enough if you to get an A, others must get Bs. 

At Rice, you sit together in your residential college commons and just cry, laugh, and sweat together every day until the end of the semester where you pick classes together with your friends so you can do it all again next semester. You missed a class? Your friend sends you the notes even though you didn’t ask. Not sure how to install a package? Ask that upperclassmen who will be so happy to show you because one of her upperclassmen showed her many years ago. Academics are a joint effort and the better your friends do, the better you are likely to do too. 

Of course these are just generalizations. There were cut throat people at Rice just as there are really collaborative students at my current school. Its just that Rice is a place where you learn together and you can depend on each other because you know you have each other’s’ best interest in mind. 

That’s not to say one is better than the other. I personally think I would have learned more and performed better in a competitive environment rather than a collaborative one. Academia is a combination of both. You have to be collaborative to succeed and if your competition does some incredible research, it elevates the entire field and it’s good for everyone. However, if you don’t keep that competitive fire, your research will never find the light of day. 

Rice is a really special place. It won’t baby you and it’s hard to get good grades unlike some other private schools. However, it manages to encourage a tightly knit community that will teach you to be a collaborative thinker. I loved it and I know you will too"
