I've been making excuses to not visit my family cause I dont want them to think I'm paranoid or overreacting."

The instances of people in Korea and China who are ""reinfected"" might be the result of testing errors or they never fully recovered in the first place and are just experiencing a second wave of the initial illness. We just don't know yet. The answer isn't to just say fuck quarantine, nothing matters anyways"
