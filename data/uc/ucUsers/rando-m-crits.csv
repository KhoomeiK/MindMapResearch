berkeley,fp7brz4,t3_gbokbo,1588367659.0,"I could see a student not cheating on any problem in the class so far but suddenly stumbling across an unsolvable problem, not understanding it and as it's part of the final, take the risk to cheat. Like in this situation, where the only reason they cheated was because there was an unsolvable problem on the final, that seems kinda shakey."
science,fo5or2v,t1_fo5e7wh,1587531154.0,The problem is that there needs to be enough runoff to support wildlife along the way from the Sierras to the ocean which includes the delta. A substantial decrease in flow would significantly push back the salt/freshwater border and hurt an already fragile ecosystem.
personalfinance,fnkfm56,t1_fnkf55c,1587025217.0,I did as you said and checked with credit karma and apparently my score increased to higher than it was before I made the purchase so I think my bank was just slow on their own credit score tracker. Thank you so much - you've alleviated a lot of my worry!
personalfinance,fnkek4o,t1_fnkefic,1587024109.0,It was like late March when I made the purchase and my billing cycle just ended yesterday. What do I do if my score doesn't go back up? Should I just continue to make small purchases and paying it back until I can get a high enough credit for another card? Or should I ask my bank to raise my limit? I feel like if I ask my bank to raise my limit they might ding my score more

UCDavis,fn8xvoc,t1_fn8w8yf,1586753255.0,"You don't seem to be understanding: UCs aren't a ""you put in scores and ECs and get admissions out"" - that's not how it works and the fact that that is what you chose to reply with demonstrates further the problem. You should be looking at this as a way of learning, not as a ""I should be entitled to a state school I can't believe I didn't get in!"""
UCDavis,fn8w1j7,t1_fn8uxvu,1586751773.0,"A 3.5 GPA and 1350 SAT isn't good enough to get into UCD and especially not without ECs, clubs, volunteering, etc. Just because you're a California resident doesn't mean you're entitled to a spot at a UC school, let alone UC Davis. The UCs are world class universities doing cutting edge research and many of them are appropriately called ""Public Ivy schools""  - they're very prestigious and being angry about not getting in reflects more on you than it does the system of admittance."

asktransgender,fn8e9y3,t1_fn8e1kc,1586739698.0,Oh no that's my bad I didn't mean to make it come off as if you were imposing a stereotype.
asktransgender,fn8c2w6,t3_g047ff,1586738336.0,"In all honesty it depends on where you hang out. Trans ppl on reddit tend to be more into computers just cause ppl on reddit tend to be more into computers. I hang out a lot on facebook and most of the trans women there never went to college and work more in retail and sw.   


I know a lot of ppl want to come up with stories about how  we were lonely as children or how there's something special about computers but it's important not to universalize our experiences as ""the trans experience"" and to remember where we approach the trans community from."
asktransgender,fk6ganp,t3_fgr3r4,1583901346.0,"There are two things that have helped me with this  


1) Time. Transitioning further along has helped lessen my gender dysphoria and in turn learn to love who I am. I still struggle a lot but it's gotten a lot better as time has gone on.   


2) Community. I found surrounding myself with other trans people online who were confident in themselves helped me gain that confidence too. Making friends with other trans ppl helps normalize our being trans to ourselves so we don't internalize transphobia and in turn hurt ourselves. Therapists can help but they're no replacement for friends.   


When moments of internalized transphobia come up it as well has helped when I or my friends have veered the conversation away from it. Internalized transphobia isn't rational and can't be answered  in a logical way: it's an emotional response to how we view ourselves."
