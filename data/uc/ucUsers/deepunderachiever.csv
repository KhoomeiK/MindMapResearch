If you have any doubts, shoot the counselors of the respective colleges an email asking about the requirements and amount of overlap; in fact, it's not recommended, and sometimes not even possible, to double major in something that's in your college. For example, a student at UCD can't double major in Biological Sciences and NPB because there's too much overlap in the required classes for these majors. That's usually why you see students majoring in a solidly STEM major and then something humanities, like Chicano Studies. Other than this limitation, most combinations of double majors and/or minors are very possible. I'd suggest meeting with the CoE counselors as soon as you decide you want to pursue any sort of additional merit :)"
UCDavis,fpg606w,t3_gd8wa2,1588595222.0,"These floors are designed to offer community-focused resources and make floor meetings revolve around the type of LLC. For example, there's an LLC called ""Aggie Explorers"" that caters to students who are undeclared and need to learn about different majors to decide their focus. The events on the LLC include bringing in college counselors, interviewing upperclass students from different majors, and holding info sessions about the majors and minors UCD has to offer. 

I can definitely see an LLC, like ABLE, being helpful to you, even if you have the tiniest draw towards entrepeneurship/business. Getting that exposure can help you realize that you're a natural or you're truly interested in the topic. The meetings are all optional so even if you lose interest in the LLC subject, you won't be forced to go. You'll meet like-minded people (or people who were put into the LLC floor because their roommate chose to be in it, but either way, new people!) and be introduced to many specialized resources. There's really no harm in doing them! Their benefits are as effective as you make them."

Sure, sometimes your roommates have people over unannounced and you wish you had a single dorm at that moment, but in the long run it really helped me get out there and get my personality known throughout the floor. Plus it makes for really interesting stories in the future :)

The people I've seen coming out of the singles on my floor, I could have sworn never went to the school. They never talked to anybody on the floor, I never saw them bring friends over, and they would kinda just slither out and in quietly. Horrible life for introverts, difficult balance for extroverts."

UCDavis,fpa2p05,t1_fp8orfh,1588439596.0,"Hey! I'm a returning second year and I know how you feel. I'm super bummed about the prospect of fall being remote, but don't worry. I'm confident you'll smash your classes, meet new people, and make the best out of the situation. And if your experience happens to be negative, it'll be like ripping off a band-aid; just bear fall quarter and live the full college experience winter quarter. Don't worry."
UCDavis,fp5zje4,t3_gbg9by,1588343186.0,"I'm sure there will be dorming options open, as there are, sadly, many students in similar positions. Campus could be ""closed"" by making instruction remote and limiting dining hours & other resources, but they wouldn't shut all the dorms down for the coming fall quarter."
