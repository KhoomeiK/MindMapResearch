Bakersfield,fmcezvq,t3_fuckpe,1585944393.0,"This person was just trying to thank everyone for supporting their photography and y’all are grilling them about their whereabouts and symptoms. Leave them alone. The virus is everywhere in Bakersfield. Stop being selfish and just wish them the best of luck to recover and move on. If you’re THAT worried about getting covid-19, Stay the hell inside. Y’all are blowing this out of proportion and being disrespectfully invasive to a person who is fighting for their life."
