chromeos,fpeoo65,t1_fpehtgw,1588551679.0,thanks I wish it had a little better standard linux support - I don't see myself using too much windows. It's also a little expensive but could be tempting if there was a deep sale.
chromeos,fpehcy6,t1_fpeg8qc,1588547575.0,"Writing, some sketching. Linux command line utilities, good for ebooks and PDFs. the Chromebook Plus was pretty slow opening up terminal and it was honestly too ungainly to use as a tablet and the battery life wasn't great. Other than that I would have kept using it for quite a while if it hadn't broken."
chromeos,fpecwb4,t1_fpe8b1w,1588545022.0,"Thanks, 500 is more than I want to pay for something that could be stolen or broken easily. 300 is definitely about the most I want to spend without freaking out over the device. I paid less than 200 for the chromebook plus so it wasn't heart wrenching when it broke!"

KillingEve,fot78be,t1_fot53lk,1588046231.0,"She's definitely put on a sloppier, punkier affect, and her clothes speak to that. I just think I would have gone more rakish, or more over the top in another direction. I don't know if I believe (or want if we are being honest) her to be on a voyage of self discovery. I feel like we established her taste level and I feel like we aren't hitting it with some of the more bummer looks this season. I think you can be depressed and dressed to excess really nicely.

Thanks for responding, though I think you are generally correct."

ArtisanVideos,fo4jbd0,t1_fo4hu2m,1587505458.0,"I'm not sure why you think a problematic piece of art can't be considered lacking. You can even find fault with unequivocally great art.

Why focus on the sexist elements? Because that's the part that was bad? I could appreciate that the work was finished well but other than that there's not a lot to say other than it is gross."
ArtisanVideos,fo4dafg,t1_fo49eth,1587502368.0,"Saying ""art is in the eye of the beholder"" either is a please for complete relativism or should allow for personal belief and room for criticism. Trying to deflate it to ""just nuts and bolts"" is similar to calling online porn ""just electrons.""

Its distant removal from an actual female form just highlights how male gaze-y this particular piece is.

That doesn't mean that porn or nudes is essentially bad or can't be elevated to art, but this feels like a really unconsidered piece that while technically fine as artisan work, is lacking as a piece of art."

1. Are you getting an error on your PC about fingerprinting? Like ""Host key verification failed"" or something about known_hosts? if that's the case you have to delete that file. ssh won't want to connect to something that looks different than previous times.
2. Are you aggressively blocking ports or something like that?


Sounds like you have some basic configuration error, and without seeing your set up I don't know how much more I can help you, sorry dude."

TrueFilm,fnesj4s,t1_fnelngd,1586895080.0,The thought of someone as nice as Boots Riley being charged with being racist and dishonest is just absurdly amusing to me. Really friendly guy I first met at the local comic books store. I think he'd take the compliment about being psuedo-intellectual mess of communist agitprop. Very Brechtian!

So you were able to ssh to it at one point but then never again?

Have you tried a different sdcard? (i recommend using a hard drive connected via usb personally, saved me a lot of weird issues since sdcards are incredibly flakey)

Did you try a different ssh program? you might get a better/different error message.


Good luck I have to go work but i'll check in later if I can."

nba,fn5ekv4,t1_fn5e523,1586662824.0,Kobe would have left if he really wanted out. He was opposed to the direction they were going and once they got him the help he needed he was back on board. You don't get five rings passively.

RunningWithDogs,fmpt50x,t3_fvotmx,1586286860.0,"I have https://ruffwear.com/products/small-collapsible-water-bladder in a vest like that. You can find more generic ones online, but the key feature you should look out for is a corner spigot opening, because you can turn it upside down so the water comes out like a drinking fountain. Here is a very crude drawing, you should hold it more at an angle for the water to come out and then you turn it horizontal to stop the flow. You hold it below the dog so it doesn't have to stretch its neck up to drink.

           ===

    oooooP

This makes it so the dog is less likely to cough from water getting in its lungs, which in a bad case causes aspiration. Plus your dog will be happier if it doesn't have a coughing fit every time it drinks water. I like it better than doing the same technique with a squeeze bottle because the flow is a lot more controllable.

I hope this helps someone, it really helped my husky."
