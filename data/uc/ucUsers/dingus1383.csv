Teachers,fpj7c7d,t1_fpiqp6w,1588658754.0,"100%!  We‚Äôre always telling our students to keep their hands to themselves, stop hugging, etc. Imagine after months of not being able to see each other in person!"
Teachers,fpj5fwf,t3_gdomlm,1588657139.0,I got a RIF notice on my birthday once. That was cool.

AmItheAsshole,fp52j60,t3_gb8jgy,1588314246.0,"I‚Äôm gonna go somewhat against the grain with an ESH. Sounds like you and your SIL are/were close, as you mentioned supporting her through pregnancies and losses. You don‚Äôt mention it, but one would assume that she would have known about your losses. She definitely should have been more sensitive to your (shared) experience, especially knowing how devastating it was. 

But, waiting a while and then calling her out of the blue to tell her off about it was not a good idea. If you had an issue with her comments, you should have addressed them that evening. Waiting a while for things to fester and blow up was not a productive way of handling things. 

Have you been through counseling/therapy to work through your losses? It might be a good idea, if not."
Teachers,foyqerg,t1_foynyn3,1588177259.0,Seriously! The privilege is just wafting off this garbage.
Teachers,foygnvv,t1_foygawv,1588172186.0,"This one: 

Something to consider to help ease our worried minds.
 
What if???
Our school is distance learning for the remainder of the year. Many people are concerned about students falling behind because of this. Yes, they may fall behind when it comes to classroom education...
But what if...
What if instead of falling ‚Äúbehind"", this group of kids are ADVANCED because of this?
What if they have more empathy, they enjoy family connection, they can be more creative and entertain themselves, they love to read, they love to express themselves in writing?
What if they enjoy the simple things, like their own backyard and sitting near a window in the quiet?
What if they notice the birds and the dates the different flowers emerge, and the calming renewal of a gentle rain shower?
What if this generation are the ones to learn to cook, organize their space, do their laundry, and keep a well run home?
What if they learn to stretch a dollar and to live with less?
What if they learn to plan shopping trips and meals at home?
What if they learn the value of eating together as a family and finding the good to share in the small delights of the everyday?
What if they are the ones to place great value on our teachers and educational professionals, librarians, public servants and the previously invisible essential support workers like truck drivers, grocers, cashiers, custodians, logistics, and health care workers and their supporting staff, just to name a few of the millions taking care of us right now while we are sheltered in place?
What if among these children, a great leader emerges who had the benefit of a slower pace and a simpler life to truly learn what really matters in this life?
What if....they are ahead???

Someone decided to send it to EVERYONE IN OUR DISTRICT. No BCC."

todayilearned,fnxqzha,t3_g4a5w3,1587344514.0,Last year I got a chemical burn right on the top of my upper lip...after drinking a few Coronas with lime at a Memorial Day cookout. It sucked.

education,fl8dqee,t3_fn5rxa,1584921357.0,"Bay Area. We‚Äôre closed until April 7, then go on spring break April 10. Our district is doing a wait-and-see approach, but we‚Äôve been unofficially told to get ready to teach online. With our governor saying it‚Äôs unlikely for us to return, I think we‚Äôll be out for the rest of the year."
