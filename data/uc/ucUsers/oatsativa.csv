financialindependence,fp0ao90,t1_fp0ah07,1588205632.0,Oh haha XD yeah you're right.. too bad I didn't think about that 5 years ago! Thanks for much for this! :?
berkeley,fp0aeid,t3_gakgl5,1588205488.0,"Are your parents not helping you out? If they can, that would be the best thing. If they don't want to pay for your education, ask if you can take out a loan from them so you don't accrue interest. I think it might be a little late to apply for scholarships, but I also applied early fall for the next year so maybe there are still scholarships accepting applications.

Besides loans/scholarships, I'd definitely suggest getting a job to try to cover the costs, maybe something related to your field if you can. (Handshake is a great resource). Other than that my advice is to just live frugally while you're here. Try to find cheaper housing (you might not like having a roommate, but that's just how it is here if you want something <$1000/mo). Cook/meal prep as much as you can. It's scary how much of your budget ends up going to food when you eat out frequently (for me, it was $500/montb at one point). 

Good luck!"

And thank you for that suggestion! I'm moving to the central valley... Very sunny/dry so perfect for citrus. 

Any suggestions for what age the tree should be when I get it?"

financialindependence,fovogk3,t1_fovixun,1588104774.0,"I just noticed you live in the bay area. So do I! What kind of plants/trees do you grow? How long have you had those trees? I really want to get a tree too, but don't know how long it will take before it produces anything (plus I don't know how heavy they would be if I were to move with them!)"
financialindependence,fovghv4,t3_g9rk05,1588100919.0,"Ahh I love that you're growing your own food!! I'm about to start my first job out of college and reading your story is basically what I've wanted in my life as well. Home grown food, volunteering in the community, having time to relax, clean, exercise, etc. 

I'm happy to be able to live in my parent's house with a backyard, and they used to be farmers so they are all about gardens. I'm glad you were able to achieve this during this time :) hopefully I will be able to do this while working from home ❤️"
berkeley,foofan4,t1_fonrghk,1587937919.0,"I get it, we've all probably taken courses that we didn't want to but were required. I'm not saying you have to be fully engaged all the time. The behavior I'm referring to is when CS students basically find their own clan, talk mainly to each other during discussion (and usually not even related to the topic), and don't come to class prepared. I learn most when I'm engaging in discussion of the material, and I can't have that discussion when I'm stuck in a group with these people who have nothing to contribute because they didn't do the readings! The bare minimum should also include how you're affecting your classmates as well."
berkeley,fomn0t9,t1_fommjvw,1587896273.0,"Wtf? That's racist af and this issue doesn't have to do with race.

Edit: the comment that was deleted was ""just stay away from asian dudes. They tend to be the weirdest and cockiest students in this major"""
berkeley,fomms8b,t3_g8an1k,1587896001.0,"GIRL I FEEL YOU ON ALL THESE POINTS.

I HATE when people assume you don't know anything and start from the beginning. Dude! If I was completely I would say that I was! This one guy I knew would always start from the beginning of time whenever I asked a question, or would pretend like I'm some lost little girl who's helpless. Gave him three chances before I was done with his attitude. Seriously GTFO.

I also notice that even when I meet CS people outside of the classroom, they're STILL super cliquey and honestly have the attitude that just because they're CS, they're somehow superior to other majors (may not be related to men, but I also don't see this behavior in my female STEM friends). I've noticed this in the  international breadth I'm taking right now. I get they're here just to fulfill requirements but honestly the attitude they have towards the class and to other people is affecting other people's learning experience."

AmItheAsshole,fnz0rvy,t3_g4nsop,1587382618.0,"INFO: what kind of city do you live in? Depending on the city and housing situation, it can be very difficult to find someone, ESPECIALLY during this time. Where I live, our sublets don't sign a lease, but they do sign a sublet agreement which is an independent contract between the person on a lease and the person who's subletting. The landlord does not get involved. They are legally supposed to raise the rent if more people sign or transfer leases, but given that it's a college town they are forgiving and allow for this alternative arrangment. It's an unwritten rule, but if you're subletting without being on the lease, you're expected to follow the rules as of you were, unless you want to pay extra. I hope they made you at least sign some sublet contract, because otherwise you're literally throwing them under the bus. It's the sublets responsibility to pay for the rent or find a replacement. It's not their responsibility what happened to you. Just because you have to leave, doesn't mean you can leave your responsibility. 

Are you legally forced to pay? Depends on if there's a contract, but otherwise no. Is it moral to do this? No.

Edit: why were they trying to get you on the lease? What would that result in?"
AmItheAsshole,fna7lol,t1_fn9yme4,1586792532.0,"I thought he gave the backstory because that was from the perspective of his friends? As in, if his friends knew that she made a rude comment like that, they may think that it's linked to his questions. But assuming he asked those questions independent of that, his friends may not think that."
berkeley,fn6796m,t1_fn5tq25,1586690193.0,"I am graduating this semester and only need my international breadth. I'm taking another class for ""fun"" but it ended up being very difficult and I'm considering dropping it. I was already at 8 units and received replacement grant, but do you happen to know if I would need to repay it considering that dropping the class would result in <6 units? At worst I will just have to NP, but it would be nice to know my options."
AmItheAsshole,fmz93h9,t3_fy3n36,1586511263.0,"NTA, I assume your mother wants her to be financially stable when she graduates. I can understand that. Why not have her double major (or even minor)? One in STEM, one in arts. I'm not saying arts can't lead to a career with good salaries, but statistically it's less likely. I am very passionate about baking, but I know if I took that path it would've been extremely selfish of me. I need to help my parents and family financially, and going off to ""live my life"" just seems irresponsible. I do come from a different culture though, but even so I love my family deeply and don't want us to live in poverty anymore. I worked hard, got into a good school, and will soon be on my way to working full time (hopefully after COVID is over). Guess what? I still love baking! And I intend to spend time doing it when I'm not working...and maybe, just maybe, if I have enough support to start a business, I will! 

Perhaps your sister doesn't have to worry about family to support, but it does seem like there are still grandparents? (Unless they are wealthy) Still, I can understand your mother's perspective through my own experience, and I think it's easy to find a compromise here!"
berkeley,fmrdrlv,t3_fww09b,1586320316.0,"I dropped a class late this semester which put me at 8 units. FAFSA doesn't care about individual school policies, so they will ask for it back, but thankfully Berkeley has grants specifically for these situations so you should be covered automatically. Look into ""UC Cal Grant Fee Replacement"" and ""Spring Balance Grant."" If you don't get an adjustment within a week, definitely seek an advisor. Though, it might be a slow transaction due to what's going on right now."
datascience,fmqknku,t1_fmqgnt8,1586301490.0,"I've applied to Operations Analyst, BI/Business Analyst, and Quant Analyst roles on top of Data Scientist/Data Analyst. I'm finding better results when searching ""Junior Data Analyst"" though. Apparently interning/doing research every semester for 4 semesters (and summer internship) doesn't count as being a full year of work for some people. I'm losing hope though."
datascience,fmqkapn,t1_fmqe3yg,1586301285.0,"Aw thanks :) I really appreciate your comment. I do believe real world experience is invaluable. Perhaps I will get a higher degree later, but as of now I cannot afford it. I'm not even applying to FAANG companies (I mean, unless they offer 'University Grad' options). I'm honestly applying for everything at this point. I'm not too picky when it comes to companies, I've yet to reach the interview stage for most of them."
AmItheAsshole,fmq3xy8,t1_fmpjmss,1586292426.0,"Tangent, but where I'm from if you get good grades in school (>3.0) you actually get a ""good student"" insurance discount. It's very significant (saved $400 for me) and I think that's a good enough reason to wait until his grades are up. But yes, I definitely think this kid needs to mature a bit above all else."
datascience,fmpoi04,t1_fmpjna8,1586284492.0,"What seniority level were you recruiting for? If it was for mid-level+ I can see why you wouldn't look at it, but assuming you were also recruiting for Junior/Associate/Entry-Level/Interns I'd say it's worth giving them a chance. I also did some recruiting for the new cohort of interns, and I loved that some interns included links to side projects that were extensive and illustrated their analytical skills, attention to detail, and communication. As an undergrad I was *lucky* to get internship opportunities, and keep in mind that I went to UC Berkeley, had a major specifically for Data Science (not common for bachelor programs), and already had to compete with hundreds (if not 1000+) students in the CS/DS department for the same opportunities (I don't know how students at other schools manage given the already competitive environment on my campus alone!). So I empathize heavily with a lot of new grads who don't have internship or real world experience yet, and I look into their side projects or recommendations to see if they can get/give the most out of the internship. Again though, this was just how I recruited for interns, and I get that it's different with full time jobs, but I hope (perhaps naively) that entry/junior level recruiting does the same."
datascience,fmpd1x9,t3_fwmgqi,1586278673.0,"I think it would be worth it if you're looking to do less data science stuff and more towards Data Analysis/Visualization/Storytelling and need to build dashboards, which is great if you're trying to break through the field! I'm about to graduate with a B.A. in data science, and let me tell you the job search is not easy. Most people want Master's/Ph.D, even though the master's program at my school is essentially the same as the Bachelor's (the only difference is, in our mixed classes, grad students do final projects, which is...you guessed it... Basically a side project; I go to UC Berkeley for reference).
Side note: I had LinkedIn Premium for two months and found that in most jobs I applied for under ""Data Scientist"" and ""Data Analyst"", 60-80% of candidates had Master's.


I've personally had multiple work and research experiences (Bureau of Labor Statistics, start ups, Disney contract, etc., all with Data Science/Data Analyst responsibilities) and even with this I'm not getting much luck with interviews. I don't know your education/experience background which is why I laid mine out for you to get a feel for where you need to be (because I honestly thought I was a decent candidate but apparently not). I'm also thinking of building a website just for the sake of practicing my coding/design skills that can be transferrable, but as of now I'm just linking my resume to my GitHub/Google Drive folder that contains my work. Yes, my GitHub link is on my resume, but to make it even easier on the recruiter I've also put small links beside each work experience to showcase what I've done (to the amount I can as company/federal data is private). Let me know if this helped you at all:)"
AmItheAsshole,fm5qq7g,t1_fm4qbp2,1585778073.0,"Yeah I can see how that's a solid possibility. I guess I also misinterpreted the ""you can't have it both ways"" as ""you can't call yourself husband and wife and not expect to confuse others"" but I can see how it would be more of a  ""you can't call yourself that and not be married"", which I would say is an AH judgment. I do believe it's important to keep the meaning behind labels strong, but in this case it makes sense (it's not like the daughter uses the label lightly -- her relationship is basically a marriage without the government involved).

On another note, I think it's true that we call our close friends family names, but I think it's different when it comes to marriage since you can call multiple people your uncle but you can't call multiple people your spouse (unless you're in a polyamorous relationship)"
