UCSD,fpf53b2,t3_gcl81u,1588561994.0,"For the transportation point - once the MTS Blue Line trolley station is open on campus, it'll be possible to take the trolley from UCSD to SDSU, though you'll need to change to the Green Line at one of the crossover stations.  Until then you could travel by MTS bus from campus to a trolley station.  As long as your quarter's transportation fees are paid, you'll get free access to all MTS trolley lines and buses with the Compass Cloud mobile app.  That's how I got out of paying $25 or so for parking when I had jury duty downtown."
UCSD,fot4epi,t3_g9bzn3,1588044401.0,"I also have Spectrum and it's crapped out on me several times in the middle of Zoom meetings.  Here are the two things I did to improve it:

1. I bought a Wi-Fi range extender.  The exact model I got was [amazon.com/dp/B010S6SG3S](https://amazon.com/dp/B010S6SG3S), but there are several good ones out there.  My bedroom is some distance away from the main router, so this helps boost the RSSI.  And there's an onboard Ethernet port that I use often.
2. I call into Zoom meetings as a backup - not using the Zoom mobile app, but instead using the plain old phone number.  If you hit ""copy invitation"" and paste it somewhere, you'll see the ""one-tap mobile"" option.  Since I have Wi-Fi calling disabled, it only uses the Verizon network, and the audio I get through the phone line is \*much\* better than the audio I get through the Zoom desktop client.  Whenever the desktop audio gets too laggy (which happens often), I just put my phone on speaker.  This also has the added benefit where if you need to get up and grab a snack or something, you can take the phone with you and still hear what's going on in the lecture."

UCSD,fo9c3k1,t3_g5nhgu,1587615545.0,"I totally agree.  Like many have pointed out, you want to keep those notifications on to make sure you don't miss anything, but it takes you time to sift through and find the important ones.  I relate to the around-the-clock sentiment because often my professors and TAs will send announcements in the middle of the night.  One of my classes had an announcement that came from the professor at 2:44 AM yesterday.

Right now I'm struggling with only having time during the week to complete required assignments instead of catching up on lectures: one of my professors refuses to use Zoom and instead podcasts in an empty classroom.  Two big problems with that: (1) no ability to ask him questions during the lecture, and his office hours are a direct conflict with another one of my classes; and (2) it takes a couple hours for the video to become available and by that point I've already moved on to something else.  And I don't have time to watch the lecture because I'm busy completing homework assignments.  So then the vicious cycle continues.  You're not alone - I've been anxious a lot this quarter too.

The monotony is also frustrating - when I'm on campus, I'll usually have lunch in a different place every day.  Now I have like two places in my house where I can eat lunch?  Seems insignificant but a lack of variety in your days really drains your willpower."

UCSD,fnnvg3t,t3_g2sdtt,1587102962.0,"I was wondering the same thing, because I haven't been able to download from Kaltura on Canvas.

[https://kb.iu.edu/d/bfos](https://kb.iu.edu/d/bfos) < From this link, it seems like by default videos uploaded to Kaltura can not be downloaded.  The video owner would have to manually change the setting to allow users to download the video.  So it sounds like you'd have to reach out to your professor and ask about allowing video downloads.  There's also screen recording software, but that can get clunky and time-consuming."
UCSD,fnnv61q,t3_g2swby,1587102709.0,"I took MAE 130A summer session I 2018 and it ended up working out very well.  Very reasonable professor with well-written exams and plenty of office hours.  Since then, MAE has revised that series and made it lower-division (renumbered it from 130 to 30).  But at the time, 130A was equivalent to SE 101A, and I don't think 30A is changed \*that\* much from 130A.  There were several SE students in my class.

Like many classes, it had lectures M/Tu/W/Th for 80 minutes and additional 50-minute problem sessions M/W.  My professor was great at working through problems similar to the ones we saw on the homework, and it was great having three-day weekends to study."
UCSD,fnnuua9,t3_fr8mld,1587102416.0,"Wanted to bump this thread u/Yumiko3424.  Do you have any updates on your end?  I personally haven't been contacted by any professors or received word on whether I got the position or not.

But I \*did\* hear from a Career Services Center student employee manager that >500 people applied for this position, and they've brought on people to start sorting through resumes.  People who are cleared will have their resumes put into a pool that interested professors can sift through and draw from.  And they have until June 1st to do so, which is later than I was expecting."
UCSD,fnnuboa,t3_g2tyen,1587101962.0,"I haven't been required to do anything like that (yet) but yeah, I'd probably feel pretty uncomfortable.

The tricky thing is that there's no easy way to rigorously ensure academic integrity with these kinds of classes.  I had a closed-book exam earlier today without any kind of video monitoring; somebody in the class emailed the professor expressing his concern that people might use unauthorized resources, and the professor flat out said in his response that ""no doubt a few will cheat"".

So basically you've either got to (1) make your exams open-book with the expectation that people will use their notes and the internet; (2) make your exams closed-note and trust that students will abide by that policy while knowing there's a good chance some people won't due to the lack of supervision; or (3) visually supervise students to ensure everyone's complying, but at the cost of making people uncomfortable."
UCSD,fnntrtj,t3_g2u02b,1587101486.0,"Multiple deadlines were pushed back, especially the deadline to choose between a letter grade and pass/no pass.  That's a bummer though about those professors pushing back.  If you can somehow prove to them that you've watched (or are willing to watch) all of their recorded Zoom lectures, maybe that could help."
UCSD,fnntndd,t3_g2ok5b,1587101379.0,"Agreed, people rarely drop writing courses.

When I took WCWP 10B summer session I 2018, I started off as #1 on the waitlist and thankfully got in when one person dropped.  But nobody else dropped in that section.  I'll say it was nice getting it done in the summer when I actually had enough time to get all the required readings done.

UCSD,fnk9gu6,t1_fnbgb73,1587019120.0,"Hi there u/MrBlofeld825, sorry for the delayed response.  I usually explain it like this, but my colleagues might want to add on some more details:

Your college determines three things about your UCSD experience.

1. Your general education classes (unique to your college).  Note that your major courses are exactly the same no matter which college you're in.
2. Where you live on campus, *if* you choose to live on campus (we don't require you to, but I recommend it).  For more info on the res halls, see my reply to u/LBbeef on this post.
3. The first few friends you make (probably).  This is even more true if you live on campus.

I know that for Warren College, I used my Calc BC credit to pass off MATH 20A and 20B which actually achieved two things:

1. Fulfilled the ""formal skills"" requirement for Warren G.E. requirements.
2. Made it so I could jump right into MATH 20C (I'm in mechE).

Dunno if you can do the same thing in Marshall, but I'm going to tag u/anthea_dancer20 since she's in Marshall and I'm sure she could tell you about her experience with Marshall's G.E. requirements.

If you're around in San Diego during the summer, you can also take advantage of Summer Session ([summersession.ucsd.edu](https://summersession.ucsd.edu)) to take some classes.  I took classes in Summer Session I 2017 and both Summer Sessions (I and II) in 2018.  One of these was Warren Writing 10B.  Felt great to have that done, and since I wasn't juggling 10B with other classes I could actually stay up-to-date on the readings.  Not every class is offered, of course, but a good number usually are -- including many G.E. classes for each college.  And my guess is their office will probably expand course offerings this summer since it'll be online; there's a good chance their summer (virtual) enrollment will be larger this summer than it's been in previous years.

tl;dr in response to your question about graduating early, summer classes can help you get there."
UCSD,fnk8eh3,t1_fmjl69e,1587018139.0,"Yup.  u/sesameandrice any other questions, or did that answer it for you?"
UCSD,fnk83cz,t1_fms15xo,1587017856.0,"Hey u/LBbeef, sorry to leave you hanging!  Thought we got all the replies.

All incoming UCSD students are guaranteed two years of on-campus housing.  You're not required to use these (I, for instance, just used one).  But if you do, you'll live in the college to which you were admitted.  Exceptions do exist to this, where overflow housing is sometimes necessary, but that's relatively uncommon.

Regardless of which college you're living in, freshmen typically live in residence halls (""res halls"").  That was my living arrangement in Warren my freshman year.  Res halls are set up in a suite format.  In my case the suite was two triple rooms and four single rooms for a total of ten men.  This number might vary slightly (my friend in Roosevelt had 14 in her suite) but it's usually around a dozen.

Most suites are single-gender (like mine was) with mixed-gender floors (we were across from a suite of ten women).  My floor had five suites for a total of fifty people.  Mixed-gender housing is available as well, but you'll have to put in a request for it.

My res hall was a good environment where a lot of my favorite UCSD memories happened, and I'm not saying that just because I'm a tour guide.  I became fast friends with my roommates and suitemates, and we're all still on great terms.  Some memories that stand out to me were late-night food runs (Earl's Market / PC / off-campus) and TV/movie marathons.  It's also true that being able to nap between classes is great, and you have a private space to call your own.  And that's why I always recommend that freshmen live on campus if they're able to do so.

Feel free to reply with any other questions that might have come up."
