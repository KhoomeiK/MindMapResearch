ucr,fol92my,t1_fol8yms,1587857305.0,You’re welcome. I hope you find a residence hall that you will enjoy.
ucr,fol6bn4,t3_g7xkkj,1587855738.0,"I lived in Lothian (East Lothian) during the 2018-2019 school year. 

I’m not sure if when you refer to the restrooms at Lothian , whether you are referring to West Lothian or East Lothian. East Lothian (DEF wings) is better than west Lothian (AB wings).
If you want to go get a snack in East Lothian or west Lothian  , you can safely walk to Scotty’s at East lothian to get a snack at 1:45 am (it closes at 2 am each day). 

I loved the restroom/shower combination. There is, I remember, more natural light in the restrooms in East Lothian than the ones in West Lothian. I also never had to wait to use the restrooms and showers and sinks. Oh , in September/October and in May/June you may want to stay indoors cuz it’s over 85 degrees (though if you grew up in an area with hot temperatures or if you lived in Riverside for at least some months the temperatures aren’t really an issue).

Though note that Pentland has excellent scenery. Pentland is also much closer to scotty’s at Glen mor (which makes excellent sandwiches for lunch and dinner).

Orbach has great study spaces (on the second and third floor). Usually you will find a spot on those floors of orbach."
ucr,fol4yry,t3_g82mjt,1587854981.0,"Not really. 

I took Math 9C fall 2018, math 10a winter 2019. Math 10A is more difficult than the 9 series, depending on professor. Knowing Math 9A and 9B well would definitely be important, as Math 10A uses a lot of differentiation, integration, matrixes, etc. but I think good study skills (reviewing and understanding the math concepts) is more important. 

If math 9 series is using the  online pdf apex calculus, you could always review the concepts if you need them in math 10a. 

Math 10a is very difficult (for me, but others may find it easier than math 10b (I don’t have to take 10b). Math 10a is easier than proof-heavy classes such math/cs 11, but math 10a is much harder than math 46 (diff equations)."
ucr,fn569n8,t1_fm540v6,1586656936.0,"6. I am currently a second year. Last year I lived in Lothian, and I believe you can still enter piano rooms if they are empty. Just look at the window on the door of each music room to see if anyone is in the room. 

8. Get a 24-32 ounce water bottle and make sure it has water when you go out, especially when it is 80-100 degrees outside. Don’t get dehydrated. 

11. Riverside is 35-40 degrees on some winter mornings; it’s usually 60-80 degrees, and 95-105 degrees during July (if you’re taking summer school. You’ll get used to the temperatures really easily. 

15. Most supermarkets are 1-3 miles away (the bus -free with your rcard- can take you to Ralph’s (high quality food), food 4 less (cheap food), and stater bro’s. Most supermarkets and restaurants are west of the 215. There is a small organic supermarket called Goodwin’s Organics - it’s on the corner of Big Springs and Watkins. Goodwin’s organics is a place to get snacks and basic groceries. It’s the perfect place to go to after taking a hard CS 111 quiz. 

16. Get a good gpa (3.5 maybe ) on your lower divs. Having good grades are important, since in upper divs it is not easy to get a A or B without good study habits. 

22. Cs 61 and Cs 100 take at least 8-10 hours (CS100 can take more than 10 hours. Cs 100 is a project based class-2 members per group. If your partner doesn’t do work , you may need to spend 15-18 hours finishing up the cumulative project."
ucr,fn54ak2,t1_fm1kdac,1586655582.0,"East Lo, has, I think slightly more fire alarms. 
Most of the fire alarms appear to be planned (1 per quarter).

If you live in the dorms, know where the fire exits are (in Lothian, they are at the ends of each hall). Be prepared to grab your phone , jacket, keys, glasses and pens at any time - including at 2 am. During winter quarter, the fire alarm at East Lothian went off at 2 am on Wednesday morning, and some people waited in the evacuation area with a t shirt (it was 40-50 degrees or so)."
ucr,fn53nuy,t1_flvwqq5,1586655157.0,"There are 3 hour lectures (though I have never taken a 3 hour lectures). I have had Physics (040 series) labs that took the entire 3 hour period, and it’s difficult to focus for 3 hours. For 50 minute or 1 hr 20 minute classes, professors may or may not give breaks to help students process the information. Most professors in big (70+)classes won’t bother you if you bring food. If you eat, sit towards the back, and avoid food with common food allergens. 

Reading the book is great, but don’t just read the book. Understand the material. For example, for Math classes, do plenty of practice problems to prepare for a midterm/test (For STEM classes, procrastination affects grades a lot more than certain humanities classes)."
ucr,fn51ilh,t3_frgjub,1586653715.0,"I believe that Lothian and Pentland have only doubles and triples (mostly double, fewer triples). For guests, make sure guests follow rules. For example, I lived in East Lothian, commonly called East Lo (East Lo Best Lo!) Rules include not making loud noises during quiet hours (in my case between 10 pm and 8 am on weekdays, 1 am to 10 am on weekends). Hosts need to be with their guests (don’t leave guests by themselves in your dorm room). Honestly, don’t let the RAs catch you breaking any rules. 

Washing laundry costs $2.00 (the fee for the washer PLUS the fee for the dryer). Please do not leave clothes for any longer than necessary, for, during peak hours (weekends at 2 pm, weeknights) people have to wait to use the washers and dryers. The washers and dryers are open 24/7. 

I live in East Lothian -where there are 20ish washers and 15ish dryers. The Laundry room in East Lothian is better than West Lothian’s (West Lo’s) laundry room in that West Lo has fewer laundry machines and East Lo’s laundry room is next to a well lit circular pathway that can be used to get to any dorm in East Lo in 1-2 minutes. People from West Lo can go to East Lo to wash laundry.

A desk lamp with adjustable brightness may be something you like. For example if your roommate sleeps at 1 am and you want to work until 3 am, just turn off the ceiling light and dim your personal lamp. 

Get a big bottle (1-2 liter bottle) of hand sanitizer and dishwashing liquid to wash the plates that you use to eat snacks with. The cold can spread pretty quickly during the winter months, so wash your hands frequently during winter quarter. 


In big classes (200+ ppl), if you’re 30 minutes late (try to be on time to classes), you can probably sneak in and sit in the back of the lecture is 90+ minutes."
ucr,fn2cazw,t1_fn2c7re,1586584160.0,"I would recommend Lothian. Lothian has two parts- East Lothian and West Lothian. Engenuity is in East Lothian 2nd floor.

Sorry if my previous comment is hard to understand."
ucr,fn26kiy,t3_fyqy0f,1586579253.0,"As a second year Computer Engineering major who once lived in East Lo (Engenuity LLC-2nd floor), living in Engenuity is nice. You get to see other engineering majors who may be in the same classes as you are - CS  10,11,12,14. For me, Engenuity tends to maybe be studious (though if you want some fun, there are people who love to talk). Many of my classmates were in the same LC as I was. Thus, we see each other in many classes - Physics 40 series, Math 10A, CS lower divs. It’s nice going to a class and knowing that people from your hall are there.


East Lo is close to the Market at Glen Mor, where you can get excellent hot meals at Savor when Lothian dining hall was closed. Lothian (and Pentland buildings that are close to the Lot 15 hill on the west side of Pentland) is just a 3-5 minute from Chung Hall. 

But if during orientation , or before you pick dorms, you find nice dorm mates that want to live in AI or Pentland, don’t be afraid to pick a dorm other than Lothian. After all, you will(and should) spend time outside of the dorms. 

For studying, Lothian is super close to Orbach. If you study by yourself, I highly suggest studying at the third floor of Orbach. I believe that the second and third floors are the cleanest floors in Orbach. 

For East Lo, if you can choose between dorms, pick the middle of the hall, where the lounge and the water fountain (you will use the water fountain a lot). Usually rooms toward the middle of the hall ends with the digits ‘10’ to ‘15’."
ucr,fn260uy,t1_fn25w3p,1586578815.0,"If you are able to get the gpa you want, take 2 classes if you want to. It’s definitely doable. But do realize that 2 summer classes = 4 classes during a 10 week quarter.

But taking 1 class (or no classes at all) may mean that you have time to enjoy activities that you might not get to pursue during the school year. School doesn’t teach everything you need to be a well rounded adult.

Ultimately make the decision that works best for you."
ucr,fn25mrs,t3_fytdym,1586578504.0,"Yes, I took English 1B during the summer. It was challenging for me to finish a 500 page book in five weeks. Finishing a 1500 word essay each week was hard, particularly since our final draft was due the day after our rough draft was due (our rough draft was an almost finished version of our final draft). If you haven’t finished English 1B by the end of your first year, taking English 1b during the summer is good."
ucr,fn05s7h,t3_fty2k5,1586535944.0,"Math 9A involves derivatives and requires good algebra and precalculus/trig skills. Definitely spend time . Go to SI, ARC tutoring, office hours, etc. to pass with a B or higher.  For 9A you may need to study at least 8 hours each week. 

Your schedule looks difficult, but I think that if you can handle it, you should consider taking this workload (or drop a class). After all, you should be improving your study skills before you take upper division courses. 

If you want to reduce your workload, take a classes (or 2-4 classes ) over the summer. You can take 1-2 classes during Session A and/or 1-2 classes during Session B. Last summer, I was able to get ahead of my course plan by 8 units and was able to avoid a night class this quarter."
ucr,fn02neu,t3_fvsljp,1586534330.0,"I lived in East Lothian (East Lo) last year. East Lo is one of the best residence halls so far. There’s a mini gym, a Scotty’s where you can get snacks before 2 am, and laundry machines(West Lo residents can go into East Lo, but East Lo residents can’t go into West Lo. For East Lothian, you can go to the dining hall without stepping outside - great for December, when it can be 35 degrees at 8 am. Lothian makes better than average food, though I liked AI’s breakfast more. Lothian and western side of Pentland is a few minutes closer to campus than Dundee and the rest of Pentland. Definitely something to consider if you wake up at 8:10 am for your physics lab that begins at 8:30 am. 
In the 2018-19 school year, the computers in Lothian’s printer lab are somewhat operational (can take 20-30 minutes to print something because you have to log on to multiple computers before you find one that is properly configured to connect to the Internet). 


Bring wipes and snack foods (especially healthy ones). Snacks purchased on campus are somewhat more expensive then those purchased at Target or Amazon, and sometimes you want to eat in the middle of the night. A 2 meter phone charger is also nice, particularly if you want to use your phone while it’s charging and you want to be on your bed. Bring sunscreen because you may want to be outside on many nice days. Riverside weather can be 80-105 degrees in May/June and September, and 35-60 degrees in winter, so make sure you adjust your wardrobe if you need to. It’s particularly important to plan out clothes, particularly if you’re like me and need to fly between Riverside and my home in NorCal. 

You don’t need a bike if you live near or on campus. Though note that if you drive after your first year, Lot 30 can be kinda far from campus (10-15 minute walk to Chung hall). 

As many other commentators have said, plenty of clubs exist. There are plenty of posters of clubs on campus. Normally I would say to meet clubs during the evening of summer orientation (during the 5:45 pm to 7:45 pm dinner break) but idk if orientation will be on campus because spring 2020 and summer 2020 classes are online."
ucr,fn00hox,t1_fms94w3,1586533177.0,"I took CS 111 during Winter 2020. I studied really hard for the quizzes and homework (over 10+ hours each week) but I got a D-. I passed, but I’m planning to retake 111 in Summer Session A to get a B or C.

If you study 111 in summer session, be prepared to spend 20-25 hours each week for the class. Study multiple times each day (and test your knowledge frequently). It is particularly important that you do not fall behind on 111."
ucr,fn002rh,t1_fmyhd15,1586532948.0,"Yeah I took Engl 1B and Math 46 for session B last year. It was tough writing an essay in just 1 week. The final draft was due the day after the rough draft was due. I didn’t have a printer at home, and the professor required me to print out both the rough draft and the final draft. It was hard to correct the mistakes on the rough draft so quickly. 

The workload can be very heavy, particularly if you are taking a time consuming class."
ucr,fmzzmsv,t3_fy3m6v,1586532704.0,"If you are taking a class in section A or section B that is taught every day (Monday through Thursday) and that class has a 3-hour lab every other day, you may find it difficult to find another class that fits your schedule for that particular session. 

Though if you are able to take two classes at the same time, don’t be afraid to take two classes at the same time."
ucr,fmzymfe,t3_fxe9m5,1586532149.0,"I currently live in the Eastside neighborhood (west of the Food for Less). It may have more crime than the average California city, but Riverside is overall a reasonably safe neighborhood, provided you watch your surroundings whenever you walk around. When you’re just to the west of campus, Definitely don’t walk alone in alleyways and areas with little to no people, if you can. Don’t be afraid to go to Riverside just because of safety. You should take safety into consideration, but remember to consider other factors of the school."
ucr,fmzxg14,t3_fx0ug9,1586531501.0,"This quarter is hard for me too.  Not all students have good computer. A student may not have a good connection to zoom at all times, thus limiting that student’s learning potential. I find it difficult to pay attention during lectures, especially the ones where you are not required to display audio and video. It’s very easy to fall asleep, particularly since you are not in a lecture hall. It is also easy to be late to zoom meetings too, especially for those who struggle with punctuality while on campus. 

For office hours, I sometimes can’t go to the office hours of TAs other than my TAs since sometimes TAs don’t release the office hours Zoom passwords to the students that they teach. 

It is also difficult to share handwritten documents (e.g. math homework problems) to a professor or TA during their office hours. It’s easy to show handwritten work to the Ta in person; it’s a bit harder to take pictures of your work as you do it. 


Also, I like studying in orbach. It’s a bit harder to study at home, since my current residence has many more distractions than orbach has."
ucr,fmzuzxw,t1_fmufcn0,1586530094.0,"If you did poorly on the first quiz, make sure you start studying formulas and doing practice problems soon after she teaches them. Cramming alone will often not get you a good grade in this class. If you start understanding (not just rote memorizing) the formulas every day and carefully complete the homework, you should be able to reduce the number of careless mistakes that you make. 

111 is tough but doable if you put in more effort than you would normally put for that class."
ucr,fmqmxih,t1_fmqjprl,1586302790.0,"Definitely true. Having a general idea of how the code works (and knowing how LD, ST, LDR, STR, and other assembly instructions process code) is important, especially as the programs get more complex. I could have saved many hours had I understood the difference between LD and ST, for example"
ucr,fmqkoqv,t1_fmpu7pr,1586301509.0,"Note that some classes are offered in other sessions, like session F (which is 10 weeks long, aka like a regular quarter). The finals schedule for summer sessions may also tell you which session the class is in, though the finals schedule for this summer may not be accurate, as classes are changing sessions (For example, a session B class may have become a session A class). So be sure to check your registration occasionally to be sure your class times and/or finals don’t conflict."
ucr,fmqjl8b,t3_fwu2xr,1586300882.0,"For CS 61, difficulty may vary.  So try to do all projects early. For the labs, my TA helped us understand how the code works. However, during the later half of the class, we were given much less time to do the labs and programming assignments. For summer sessions, if you don’t procrastinate, you may need to spend on average 16-20 hours per week (in a 10 week quarter, spend 8-10 hrs maybe). CS 61 is doable, if you practice the datapaths and study early. I procrastinated on my study methods before the midterm, so I would often spend 30-40 hours completing the last few programming assignments. So if you don’t procrastinate, pass at least 4/5 programming assignments, pass the final, and really study, you should be able to do well on CS 61."
ucr,fmnl5md,t3_fwbtdz,1586228619.0,"Parking is a serious issue. I know people who spend more than 20 minutes (or 1 hour) looking for parking in Lot 30. I don’t know how much ASUCR can help with parking, though it would be nice if ASUCR can help."
