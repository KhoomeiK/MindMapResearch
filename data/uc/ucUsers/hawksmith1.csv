FIFA,fpgytgz,t3_gdfdcq,1588611934.0,"I was in san diego for the past 6 months and i ran into this quite often (UCSD housing and internet btw xd).

In my experience you'll come up against them regardless but i always found the internet and games to be much better earlier in the day even if i matched vs someone from Mexico"
FIFA,fp2udc5,t1_fp2omu7,1588268040.0,Im thinking of doing that but thats gonna wait have to wait till masters or after I graduate haha
FIFA,fovxeur,t1_fouju89,1588109207.0,"Bats got one for doing the same during the backend if the season, so I assume if he's popular enough (which i think he is) they would probably give him one. 

If not then maybe they would give him a moments sbc anyway for scoring a hat trick on his debut"
UCSD,fotw6ge,t1_fos59di,1588068295.0,"Bro no kidding, i've been fasting and i just had a math midterm that took me about 17 hours, followed by a DOC midterm proposal that i gotta write today and another Bio midterm tomorrow. 

I wanna cry but i cant spare the hydration xd"

sylasmains,fnwg6q3,t1_fnw7e8d,1587317768.0,"He just needs some power shifted into other aspects of his kit. His design is good its just right now, your damage is all in your second e and your q is basically a non existent spell. Your w is your main ability that needs you to be in melee range, has super high mana cost, and easily countered by knockbacks or heal reduc. 

Right now my gameplay is me being a little bitch in lane while i get shoved in and cs under tower"
Rivenmains,fnrs1yf,t1_fnrrijb,1587199403.0,"It was on synapse, dont remember which episode though sorry"
Rivenmains,fnrp5xr,t1_fnqr9oc,1587196421.0,"I saw stream highlights where he was playing renekton, wasted his fury to dash in twice into rivens minion wave and then riven just barely killed him even though he misplayed and then he legit started bitching about the health regen buff xd"
sylasmains,fnromdg,t3_g3f43d,1587195875.0,"I adjusted to the clunkiness to the point where i dont feel it anymore. What i do feel is being shoved in by every single midlaner, not being able to fight 80 percent of the matchups till 12 minutes into the game, and doing 60 dmg to minions with q and 20 with passive"

Has some thigh in there"
sylasmains,fnmfb88,t3_g2k1xr,1587070395.0,"The worst matchups for sylas are the ones that can shove the wave safely, or those who can kill you in a 1v1 pretty easily. Champs like oriana you wait till level 3 while you are decently healthy, then wait for her to get closer to your wave to poke then dash in with e. If you land your e2 you definitely chunk them hard and they probably lose half hp if not more while.you should be relatively fine."

sylasmains,fnkw019,t1_fnkvpca,1587041386.0,Ya3am fee nas ma3ateeh fl le3ba dee. Something i tried when i was leveling a new account was to just turn off chat completely and the game was so much more chill. I noticed that very rarely will anyone say anything in chat thats useful so its so much easier to just play and talk to your premade on voice comms without worrying about it
sylasmains,fnkvis4,t3_g2b77t,1587041041.0,"Not sure where you're from but i play with my Egyptian friends all the time and we get racist abuse all the time when we speak in arabic in chat. But it never happens when we're carrying. As for the trollers and afkers it doesnt really get better anywhere in the ranked ladder, the egos just get bigger. Gotta learn to ignore it and just do your best and be positive."
UCSD,fnkuo71,t3_g2b4e5,1587040414.0,"Well, in the game Yhorm was a really easy boss fight once you figured out what you needed to do. Keep going and you got this!"

deadcells,fmzrf3m,t3_fy5tss,1586527956.0,I found the easiest way to flawlessly do bosses was just go full tactics and run the fuck away while your traps do their thing. I suck hard at dodging the time keeper but i managed it because my traps fucking demolished her in less than 15s

FIFA,fmsel2a,t3_fx5g36,1586353822.0,"Doesnt this basically prove (or actually strongly suggest) that theres just way more weighting on dead pulls of the same rating than good ones? (Multiple goalkeepers and fodders before 1 usable or promo card)

Not that this is anything new but it at least supports the theory that packweight is based on market price"
sylasmains,fms6441,t3_fwrb3l,1586347732.0,Its the same reason why his passive aa dont one shot yorick ghouls. I guess they count as spells not aa's

UCSD,fmmsi08,t1_fmmqc5q,1586211224.0,Totally agree. Putting a routine for myself stops me from procrastinating completely and gives me peace of mind about not falling behind.
