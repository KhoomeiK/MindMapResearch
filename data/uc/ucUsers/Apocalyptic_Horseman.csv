AskReddit,fpn1fiu,t3_gdzb3i,1588747353.0,Bounced a ball after the bell rang. I am not kidding.
DCcomics,fpmri7e,t1_fpmqf6t,1588739817.0,I wouldn‚Äôt complain. I enjoyed the New 52 but I think they‚Äôre gonna move more into DC Rebirth territory now. Maybe lead up to Doomsday Clock?
DCcomics,fpmq9zy,t3_ge75x3,1588738940.0,I never imagined something that crazy from DC. It seriously gave me DCeased vibes. And I loved how it came full circle with Flashpoint. I just need to know now: what‚Äôs next?
UCSantaBarbara,fpmphuw,t1_fpmfkgh,1588738381.0,I feel you man!
DCEUleaks,fpmp707,t1_fpm897x,1588738170.0,No trust me I totally get what you‚Äôre saying. If Iris is black then it must mean her brother is black. So if he‚Äôs black then Wally will be too
MarvelStudiosSpoilers,fpllzpl,t3_ge66h6,1588715127.0,D+ doesnt have any shows right now and they just keep piling up more and more. I feel like everything is just gonna be one big clustefuck in the coming years. I think we should really hold off on Young Avengers characters
BatwomanTV,fplca8a,t1_fpl1wzb,1588710150.0,This is really interesting!
BatwomanTV,fplc7as,t1_fpkv4qq,1588710110.0,At first we didn‚Äôt know Clark and Lois would have 2 sons so we thought that the one that‚Äôs Jordan Kent was gonna be Damian because of the similarities in personality
BatwomanTV,fplc2ix,t1_fpkqvxo,1588710044.0,Yea Tim and Damian are definitely not in the picture at this point
DCEUleaks,fplaykt,t1_fplag66,1588709472.0,Well shes related to him. She‚Äôs the sister of his dad
MarvelStudiosSpoilers,fpkg3gw,t3_gdzmk5,1588694053.0,Disney+ must be really desperate for new content

hellier,fpk81c7,t1_fpjzzbl,1588689774.0,What the gel do you think that means? That is so strange. Are the wikimedia file descriptions supposed to make sense?
DCcomics,fpj2eak,t3_gdok0q,1588654691.0,"I see the post and without clicking on it I think yea  it looks pretty good. I click and examine and thinking this actually is really nice art and then I see a tall, bald purple figure. I think to myself, ‚ÄúHoly shit is that Telos?‚Äù And then it hits me. This can only mean one thing: u/SuperDidioPrime strikes again"
BatwomanTV,fphvg6i,t3_gab4lw,1588628540.0,Like a lot of other people I‚Äôve been wanting Jensen Ackles since day one. Anson Mount would definitely be a pretty good alternative though
hellier,fpgp9wt,t1_fpgov17,1588607041.0,Ok that‚Äôs super weird
hellier,fpgnyur,t1_fpg1dlu,1588606350.0,Hellier?
DCcomics,fpez94f,t3_gd2f9t,1588558173.0,YES! I‚Äôm so pumped! First time we‚Äôll see a live action Hush
DCEUleaks,fpeuray,t3_gd1oqc,1588555369.0,This would pretty cool. I don‚Äôt want this universe to die so a soft reboot with Doomsday Clock with be kinda cool
marvelstudios,fpeky12,t3_gcxtob,1588549551.0,Incredible Hulk was the best portrayal of Hulk imo especially during the fight with Abomination
clevercomebacks,fpeckqc,t3_gcvm90,1588544834.0,Hey my friend had this professor! He teaches at my uni! He‚Äôs also one of the founders of San Diego Comic Con too I think.
marvelstudios,fpeax64,t1_fpe992o,1588543870.0,Yea I think that‚Äôs the move
MarvelStudiosSpoilers,fpea8jm,t1_fpe26ye,1588543474.0,That sounds like it‚Äôll be cool. It can be like the Avengers-like film of the Sony universe ending their Phase 1. I have to admit I‚Äôm actually really excited for that and I‚Äôm excited to see Spider-Man in there
MarvelStudiosSpoilers,fpea28t,t1_fpe67et,1588543372.0,Totally agree
marvelstudios,fpd0c52,t3_gcjpae,1588517074.0,Honestly I can‚Äôt decide because I don‚Äôt think they would be able to decide. I don‚Äôt see either of them giving up leadership to the other

UCSantaBarbara,fpbkd2g,t1_fpbfue1,1588472013.0,Thanks for the advice!

PublicFreakout,fp9t53c,t3_gc0wbf,1588434017.0,I love the little laugh at end from the camera man
marvelstudios,fp85u8x,t3_gbpaal,1588384290.0,Anyone else think Ebony Maw‚Äôs dialogue was overdone and a little cringey?
MarvelStudiosSpoilers,fp85ago,t3_gbs41z,1588383882.0,Personally I‚Äôd be fine if they made the show PG-13. How would you all react if they did that
marvelstudios,fp70ab7,t1_fp6c1g6,1588361721.0,It looked like songbird was in some leaked FATWS   set pics
DCEUleaks,fp6prja,t1_fp6m4el,1588356477.0,That‚Äôs just how reddit is man. I‚Äôm just sharing my opinion that people don‚Äôt like
DCEUleaks,fp6k99u,t3_gbl4by,1588353778.0,"I hate to be that guy but I just hope the new actress is white. If in the comics it was just Iris herself then I wouldn‚Äôt mind what race she is. But since she has a family in the comics that just means you gotta change their race too. So what I‚Äôm getting at is, I just wanna see ginger Wally portrayed accurately. The Flash tv show did their own thing with the West family and I liked it but I wanna see something more classic now."
marvelstudios,fp3mjlm,t3_gaxwk5,1588281944.0,Hey that‚Äôs definitely a silver lining to the delays. I never liked the fact that the MCU is now a few year ahead so it‚Äôll be nice to catch up
BatwomanTV,fp2ty96,t3_g9v63h,1588267836.0,Everyone‚Äôs says Kara but Jefferson is my pick because it‚Äôs the closest we‚Äôll get to the Outsiders!
BatwomanTV,fp2tqxd,t3_g97x4c,1588267738.0,"If we didn‚Äôt see a corpse, they‚Äôre not dead"
FlashTV,fp2qpbu,t3_gautkv,1588266290.0,I can see them extending it to season 9 and then making season 10 a half season like how Arrow was only supposed to go to 7 but they did a half season for 8.
FlashTV,fp0m4s0,t3_galxm4,1588212046.0,Mindblown. Now this is really interesting to think about. I really hope they address this.
FlashTV,fp0j2tf,t3_gakoej,1588210271.0,That would be pretty cool but I feel like it would only be temporary. He couldn‚Äôt do that to Kara and Clark though because their speed comes is natural. They just run fast on their own unlike Barry who gets his powers from the Speed Force.
FlashTV,fp048tg,t1_fozygqe,1588202189.0,And Bloodwork and Mirror Master
FlashTV,fozuwaz,t1_fozlfi0,1588197289.0,Yea because Candice follows everyone except Danielle
marvelstudios,fozta45,t1_foz9teb,1588196475.0,This right here is the truth.
DCEUleaks,fozscnm,t3_gahv8x,1588196015.0,I‚Äôve always wondered where those leakers get there into from anyways
FlashTV,fouvbm1,t1_fouq7hy,1588091001.0,That would honestly be perfect
TitansTV,fosx6pa,t3_g9e85k,1588039917.0,Yep he‚Äôs coming back! I thought he was great
FlashTV,fosiz2v,t3_g9ajeh,1588031633.0,Can we just get Matt Letscher back?
FlashTV,fos6bgj,t3_g9ae1r,1588024758.0,Maybe that was the real Singh and the one that‚Äôs been in the Flash since season 1 is the Mirror Singh ü§î
marvelstudios,forlo8b,t3_g96kaj,1588014328.0,I would‚Äôve liked to see Tom Cruise as Iron Man actually. I think it would‚Äôve been cool. That‚Äôs just my opinion
MarvelStudiosSpoilers,for8ga0,t3_g94q4q,1588007949.0,This has been my fancast for Ghost Rider for years now so I‚Äôd really wanna see it. Plus it‚Äôs the only role for Keanu that makes sense to me
FlashTV,for8a3m,t3_g94pfn,1588007867.0,Unfortunately episode 19 is the last episode. It really sucks that we were so close to finishing this season. There was just 3 more episodes. I wonder if they‚Äôll make season 7 longer now?
me_irl,fopsxxx,t3_g8rmf0,1587971092.0,Now this is the most accurate thing I have EVER seen on the internet.
marvelstudios,folvh1h,t1_fol4gi3,1587871448.0,3 years between CW and Ant-Man & the Wasp
DCcomics,folm1x1,t3_g814rp,1587865185.0,The casting call was for 40-50 year old male so it‚Äôs probably Kent Nelson. I would wanna see this spin off into a Doctor Fate movie with Kent and Khalid or throw them both into the JLD mini series
marvelstudios,follw5k,t3_g850yy,1587865080.0,This is great! I‚Äôd love to see this is in the MCU. I think it‚Äôd be really really cool
batman,folkqig,t3_g84rs4,1587864343.0,Dude this is the coolest thing ever. I honestly thought it was a painting until I read the title. Awesome job!
FlashTV,folef8x,t3_g82xt2,1587860458.0,I‚Äôm sure they would do it if they could get Matt Letscher back
marvelstudios,fokusjk,t1_foksi2t,1587849354.0,Yea they just like to exaggerate things for viewers
marvelstudios,fokn1xh,t1_fokjv69,1587845141.0,[Wanna check again?](https://m.zimbio.com/photos/Chris+Pratt/Dave+Bautista/Dave+Bautista+Chris+Pratt+Jimmy+Kimmel+Live/21-jCA0uMgp)
marvelstudios,fokkf4x,t3_g7wxkf,1587843718.0,I wish this was the case but this is completely inaccurate. The coronavirus only made things 100% harder. Professors all have ways to prevent cheating and have increased the workload by a lot. I‚Äôm not just speaking for myself but for all my classmates and my friends at other universities.
marvelstudios,fokilzv,t3_g7yeoc,1587842749.0,Dave Bautista is definitely not 6‚Äô 6. He‚Äôs around the same as Chris Pratt if not shorter
DCcomics,foisrtb,t3_g7daxg,1587795826.0,Wildcat! He was always a favorite of mine on Batman the Brave and the Bold. Ted Grant is one of the toughest and most bad ass characters from DC. He‚Äôs a boxer who can kick ass and was magically granted nine lives
UCSantaBarbara,foerz2m,t3_g73062,1587712736.0,How do the fees always pass? Do people really approve them?
DC_Cinematic,foe93zt,t3_g70qbk,1587698559.0,If Will Smith couldn‚Äôt return they should‚Äôve just used Deathstroke instead. This is a huge missed opportunity.
hellierDisciples,fod5l3y,t1_fod4m7m,1587680260.0,Thanks for responding! This was very fascinating!
hellierDisciples,fobwtxe,t3_g6qtx8,1587664549.0,How similar or different is magic from the magic depicted in movies and pop culture? Also how has your life changed by being introduced to the occult?
MarvelStudiosSpoilers,fo92xam,t1_fo92jpn,1587609331.0,The only scenes with the suit that looks good are without the mask bc that‚Äôs when you know it‚Äôs the actual suit
marvelstudios,fo8mmv9,t1_fo8lu5v,1587599550.0,Lol
DC_Cinematic,fo8gtm1,t1_fo8bhmt,1587596279.0,"You are preaching the truth! For most of his career, Batman had a Robin by his side so it makes sense to introduce him. I feel optimistic about The Batman and I think we might finally get to see Robin side by side with Batman again"
marvelstudios,fo80bmm,t1_fo7yhvw,1587587641.0,I love your optimism!
DC_Cinematic,fo7ufl3,t1_fo7u2z8,1587584732.0,I‚Äôd want Garth but I won‚Äôt be picky haha
DC_Cinematic,fo7ttt3,t1_fo7t8xp,1587584437.0,That‚Äôs not a bad idea. These spin offs need major characters like Aqualad and Wonder Girl instead of being focused on the Trench or obscure Amazons
DC_Cinematic,fo7tmdk,t1_fo7t0mg,1587584336.0,I hope we get to see an extended Bat Family. Personally I think Dick should quit as Robin and become Nightwing and have Jason be the main Robin. Then as the films go on we can see Tim and eventually Damian. This can work if Pattinson keeps up the role until he is Affleck‚Äôs age in his mid-late 40s
DC_Cinematic,fo7nv0w,t3_g66t46,1587581526.0,I loved his version of Ra‚Äôs al Ghul. He just fit the role so nicely
hellier,fo7n74k,t3_g66k1m,1587581211.0,This is really interesting. Nice job!
MarvelStudiosSpoilers,fo76rpl,t1_fo69zks,1587573223.0,It definitely is.
MarvelStudiosSpoilers,fo5e9sl,t1_fo52509,1587523564.0,Huh. Keanu as Kang...not bad actually
MarvelStudiosSpoilers,fo5e41x,t1_fo4xfjf,1587523459.0,You have to give it to them for that. I love the MCU Spider-Man but the CGI for those movies is just too much. Endgame Spidey was the best imo but it doesn‚Äôt compare to Tobey or Andrew where to me it really looks like it‚Äôs them swinging in every scene.
Paranormal,fo41qej,t3_g5jeik,1587496702.0,I have read about ideas that Bigfoot can be the ghost of an early hominid
FlashTV,fo3ysr0,t1_fo3rw4d,1587495259.0,So the remaining episodes will be considered a part of season 7 then?
DC_Cinematic,fo37yrm,t3_g5g7gg,1587482233.0,"It think since they‚Äôll be big budget shows, I‚Äôd like to see them crossover with the movies"
DC_Cinematic,fo1ey3m,t1_fo1eo5b,1587431824.0,There‚Äôs not many similarities between the film and comic but it‚Äôs still a great movie imo.
DC_Cinematic,fo1ejfe,t3_g53o0q,1587431572.0,I actually like your list. Btw definitely check out Constantine!
DC_Cinematic,fo1c5d7,t3_g50xmt,1587430100.0,If Batgirl will be in the Reeves continuity then Erin Kellyman is my pick. She was cool in Solo and she‚Äôs a redhead!
UCSantaBarbara,fo0h7js,t1_fo0d7wn,1587413080.0,Same here haha
DC_Cinematic,fo053oz,t3_g4xa88,1587406233.0,Aquaman 2 in 2023 then?
UCSantaBarbara,fnzfgp3,t1_fnyo2hk,1587393031.0,Oh...well this is awkward haha. I forgot people who go to this school lived in other time zones lmao
UCSantaBarbara,fnyl8n4,t3_g4mf6p,1587366610.0,It‚Äôs for the masochists who have signed up to take it at 7 am with ProctorU
UCSantaBarbara,fnyk7bi,t1_fnyiunw,1587365652.0,"You think she‚Äôs salty we made her get rid of the required reading? I noticed ever since that, the lectures became a lot longer and I always felt it was in retaliation"
FlashTV,fny5a81,t1_fnxwqw1,1587353751.0,That‚Äôs not a bad idea honestly. I‚Äôve never considered something like this. I would want his kids to inherit his powers and carry on the legacy
AskReddit,fnxohpd,t3_g46krq,1587342973.0,2 words: bat soup
FlashTV,fnwny7v,t1_fnwjugm,1587322022.0,That sounds really cool actually. But brings up a big question for me: how did Barry first get his powers then? It kinda creates a paradox
UCSantaBarbara,fnv8pkx,t3_g41k4a,1587284147.0,Club penguin gang wya?
IAmA,fnjptnx,t3_g1vhw6,1587004217.0,Has Jeff answered a single question? This is the greatest AMA ever üòÇ
UCSantaBarbara,fnjowue,t3_g25xmg,1587003626.0,About time someone said something. I thought I was alone on this. I see so much junk on Instagram because people keep reposting stories and posts from candidates making promises that will NEVER come true. This is just as meaningless as middle school elections
DCcomics,fnieko4,t3_g1vnz6,1586978667.0,I would wanna see Garth because Black Manta seems too young to have a teenage son. This is just my super optimistic thinking but if Flashpoint happens and The Batman is in the DCEU then maybe we can set up the Teen Titans? Robin was rumored to be in The Batman
BatwomanTV,fnhzy24,t1_fnhyfn1,1586971646.0,I never said I want him in the main cast or anything. I was just thinking he could appear like once a season as a guest or just appear exclusively for crossovers because I wanna see the League expand
BatwomanTV,fnge6da,t1_fngdnzm,1586929501.0,They‚Äôre definitely loosening up on those restrictions since they had Ezra Miller in Crisis and a version of Bruce in Crisis and Titans. So I‚Äôm feeling hopeful. But that‚Äôs really disappointing that why won‚Äôt be able to air the finale til the end of the year
TwoXChromosomes,fncwlz3,t3_g0tmss,1586849743.0,Didn‚Äôt Russia have a really low number of cases and deaths too?
DC_Cinematic,fnc9t8o,t3_g0vnfx,1586831736.0,The Justice League suit is perfection
