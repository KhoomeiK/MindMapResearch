A couple weeks later Google made an official announcement."

From really talented VFX artists creating amazing edits like these to awesome web developers scraping the website and sifting through hundreds of lines of JS/HTML.  


It's amazing how talented some of y'all are and it shows <3! I'm sure Carti would be proud for real.  


Keep up the great work, if y'all are going this hard for your favorite artist, you're definitely making it far in life :) !!\*"
