UCDavis,fpivbvm,t3_gdq4v4,1588649569.0,"Stats like GPA?
I had 4.5 in high school and a 34 ACT score.
Also had soccer, school band, and a part time job.
How the hell did I even have time to sleep in high school?"
BeardedDragons,fpf16et,t1_fpezrny,1588559403.0,"Yea anything works really, it‚Äôs very light (weight-wise), I have it sitting on 2 little notches that protrude from the top of the tank on each side, it‚Äôs too high up for him to reach so I didn‚Äôt secure it"

It‚Äôs worth noting too that it‚Äôs beneficial to have the uvb lamp covering the entire enclosure, so if you want to trade up to 36‚Äù it may be a good idea"
BeardedDragons,fpeoih6,t1_fpenruf,1588551582.0,"Thank you I definitely wasn‚Äôt going to do that, he did have a minor scrape (he got his tail caught on a piece of wood in the enclosure, I promptly removed that piece of decoration and treated the wound) about 3 months ago but it seemed to heal fine, that‚Äôs why I am worried it is tail rot or the blood flow is being cut off, but if you think it looks fine then that‚Äôs a relief. I may end up taking him to the vet anyway just in case, I‚Äôd rather pay the exam fee than lose the dragon"
BeardedDragons,fpdgpry,t3_gctt6u,1588526651.0,Make a beardie burrito by swaddling them in a small towel or rag and take out 1 hand or foot at a time. I also recommend getting [specific clippers](https://www.petco.com/shop/en/petcostore/product/you-and-me-tidy-trimmers-small-animal-nail-clippers-2375762?cm_mmc=PSH-_-GGL-_-SPP-_-PME-_-PET-_-AQU-_-0-_-PM_GGL_FY20_SBU04_PrivateLabel-You&Me_PLA-SMRT-_-Product_Listing_Ads-_-Smart_Shopping&kpid=go_6465480200_83078641848_379494654466_pla-888955209307_m&utm_config=tad0iunwp&utm_campaign=PM_GGL_FY20_SBU04_PrivateLabel-You&Me_PLA-SMRT&utm_source=google&gclid=Cj0KCQjw17n1BRDEARIsAFDHFezAAknQVqfMVyBoPcpyPB_3nSNNm9dwylUQBp5cs9Pe6sCR-ZW6VTMaApysEALw_wcB)  for small animals as they‚Äôre easier to control than regular nail clippers.

BeardedDragons,fp6euwo,t1_fp5zkmr,1588351136.0,"Im referring to MBD as the extreme lack of muscle and bone mass which can cause seizures and slow death, so since her beardie is NOT doing these, id say this is an early sign of MBD"
BeardedDragons,fp4el8c,t1_fp4dxms,1588297380.0,"Just make sure you have the fluorescent tube UVB and it is changed every 6 months, with a dusting of calcium once a day! Don‚Äôt worry, they can often bounce back if it‚Äôs caught early"

UCDavis,fozp3xl,t1_fozihsb,1588194405.0,Some of us are on a tight schedule and only have a small amount of money or financial aid to last us exactly 4 years. ‚Äútaking a quarter off‚Äù isn‚Äôt an option for some students.

UCDavis,fow9h11,t3_g9wfc0,1588115496.0,"Honestly it really depends on the school you are applying for. Some schools weigh more on LSATs and improvement of grades over time, but if you‚Äôre trying to get into a renowned law school like Yale, UCB, etc. your GPA will definitely have an effect. Try calling or contacting anyone you know that went to the school you want to go to and ask them how they got in (GPA, LSAT scores, personal statement) and what they think put them ahead of other applicants. There‚Äôs also subreddits for applying to law school which you should definitely check out!"
UCDavis,fovypgs,t3_g9ppf5,1588109866.0,"Do your best. Nasiri is hard but not impossible. If it is the only class you‚Äôre taking in summer session, you‚Äôll be fine (I did this). Just make sure you go to study groups (or virtual ones, I guess) and if you can, get your info from other sources like YouTube. Also, if you can find practice tests, buy them or torrent them and do ALL the practice tests you can. I passed with a B+, the average was about a 35% for the course"
UCDavis,fovy1bi,t1_fovudu3,1588109525.0,"Actually the inflated salaries of the admin are more like $800,000, the $325,000 is more like what they make ON PAPER, the rest is from interest groups, investing, etc. they can afford to take a salary cut, considering most people (about 1 in 6) are unemployed right now."
Blup,fovnqoz,t1_fovm6r6,1588104424.0,"Look at r/beardeddragons and make sure his habitat and maintenance schedule meets the requirements, some vets do not know how to handle exotic animals that need special care, I can DM you a cheat sheet as well that you can share with your niece to make sure she‚Äôs taking proper care of him!

Blup,fovcdhw,t3_g9r96b,1588098960.0,"I think you should take them to the vet, if I recall correctly they can not breathe on their back because they have no/weak diaphragm so if he did this on his own it may be a sign of something wrong"
