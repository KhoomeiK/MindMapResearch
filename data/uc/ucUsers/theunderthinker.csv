suggestmeabook,fp4r181,t3_gb8hbt,1588305268.0,Sophie’s World has really great reviews as an intro text. I wasn’t a fan of the narrative structure but you might like it
ApplyingToCollege,fp4o4zy,t1_fp4md24,1588303350.0,Fair enough! Best of luck with your choice
ucla,fp4nkta,t3_gb9rea,1588302988.0,Hang in there!
ApplyingToCollege,fp4mzfh,t3_gb6p33,1588302608.0,"Med school admissions is rough, I would take the early admissions opportunity for sure unless you're a superstar student"
ApplyingToCollege,fp4mu7e,t3_gb1yq7,1588302514.0,"UCLA has a business school! Have you visited both campuses? That's what made the choice clear to me, and I had an amazing time in LA"
ApplyingToCollege,fp4meo9,t3_gba2zu,1588302241.0,"Fyi, UCLA has a business school. And a lot of entrepreneurial groups if you're interested in starting your own business"
ApplyingToCollege,fp4m4ew,t3_gb8why,1588302062.0,"I wouldn't worry so much! Depending on your situation/what state you're in, I would highly recommend community college. It's significantly easier to transfer into top schools and you save a ton of money. Also- I  liked my cc experience more because the teachers actually cared to teach."
ucla,fp4les0,t1_fp31z1l,1588301621.0,LOL are you me
rome,fp4lccu,t3_gb7ebz,1588301579.0,It's crazy how packed this street was for Easter.. wish I had a photo to compare
AskReddit,fp4l6sf,t1_fp4kb0z,1588301482.0,"I see, makes sense! That's kind of viewing happiness as a zero-sum game focusing on maximizing it, when short-term actions can also help contribute to a sense of well-being. That's a bit strange"
AskReddit,fp4kzwu,t1_fp4h3is,1588301359.0,Does that imply that short-term happiness is more frivolous?
AskReddit,fp4kuwn,t1_fp4ccg8,1588301270.0,"But using beauty products are a positive step I can take towards improving my self-esteem. There's rarely any one solution to common problems (weight loss, depression etc.) If you can think of one, let me know :P"
AskReddit,fp4kl52,t1_fp4buvi,1588301098.0,"Lol, I feel like rich people's expectations balloon with their lifestyles. If you always travel via private jet, I don't think you would be as excited as the first time. In terms of happiness, I think rich people are comfortable, but not necessarily happier than their less fortunate counterparts"
AskReddit,fp4k9gg,t1_fp4azv3,1588300893.0,So you're defining your relationship to happiness in terms of what provides value to you. Makes sense!
AskReddit,fp4k4yp,t1_fp4anqd,1588300814.0,"What about objects that don't directly facilitate an experience but can still feel good- like a watch, designer handbag or cosmetic surgery? Or comparative experiences- what kind of person buys a Lexus instead of a Toyota? What informs those decisions?"
