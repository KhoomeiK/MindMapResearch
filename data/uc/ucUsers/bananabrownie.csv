UCI,fo8pg9p,t1_fo7g58j,1587601168.0,">U.S. Marine Corps ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ I really appreciate your information Iâ€™ll try to get in contact with their VRC immediately

It might please you to know there are plenty of crayons here at UCI, and if you run out, there's a Target and Amazon hub across the street. :)"
UCI,fo7gtx3,t3_g5phn0,1587578097.0,"The only ""surefire"" way to get into UCI from a CC is through TAG (Transfer Admission Guarantee). You have to meet ALL their requirements including classes and grades. 

Your friend may take the same classes as you and get the same grades, but his path to college might have been different. That's the part you don't know about. 

UCs are generally holistic, meaning they look beyond an applicant's grades and test scores. Your personal statements/essays play a great role in getting you in if other aspects are at par with other applicants. 

Zot Zot"
UCI,fo7fv62,t3_g5ugxg,1587577630.0,"Congrats on your acceptance! 

There is a housing guarantee once you are certified by VRC - I believe it's however long it takes you to complete your degree (which is a real advantage as opposed to typical UCI housing guarantees which is degree time (minus) 1 year). That being said, the guarantee applies to the graduate housing communities - I would suggest Verano Place or Palo Verde, as those communities are closest to Social Sciences/Ecology buildings where a lot of Criminology classes/programs are based. 

VRC is very helpful and would be your best resource for benefits offered at UCI to veterans.

Which branch are you from?"
Costco,fo7catl,t1_fo7ah1s,1587575898.0,"Thanks for confirming! That's exactly the promo I was using. I work at a hospital that's linked with a major university, so was able to qualify for the promo through my email address."
Costco,fo79hiw,t1_fo5yjko,1587574540.0,"That's what I've been doing when I have a free moment. I get the main greeting, press ""7"" for ""Membership & Returns"", hear a dial tone for a few minutes, only to be routed back to main greeting. =("

Costco,fo59sz0,t1_fo578ut,1587520636.0,"Oh no, to clarify, I signed up for membership through a online promo - the offer says I need to print the membership activation certificate - which has this big huge barcode on it. It's the exact same barcode included in my member activation email. I don't have access to a printer and was wondering if the membership counter can just scan the barcode from my smartphone."
Costco,fo52jy0,t1_fo51k6h,1587516134.0,"Very cool, thanks for the reply! How sure are you that this is okay? I just want to prevent driving over there tomorrow to be turned away."
Veterans,flpeivy,t3_fq7djf,1585357620.0,"More than likely going to be a recall for Corpsmen/68Ws. 

Got out almost a decade ago, so definitely beyond reach of IRR."
