UCI,fpl58n0,t1_fpkqqwv,1588706595.0,How much if utc is opened btw? I’m really considering heading back to Irvine for fall (even if school is fully online) because at home isn’t going well. 😬
UCI,fpl4upw,t1_fpl2n8i,1588706401.0,"From my understanding, phase 2 of California is including the opening of gyms....do you know if the arc will open? 🤔"
UCI,fpkkn1i,t3_ge0rkv,1588696375.0,"Because it was their fault, I do not think it’s fair that they make you take another midterm."
UCI,fpkkd8h,t3_ge0qnf,1588696235.0,"So very much :(....spring is my favorite season,so seeing UCI’s insta with all the hundreds of blooming flowers makes me miss it even more 💜"
UCI,fpjbqsg,t3_gdsx5p,1588662835.0,"It’s currently midnight and thinking about all the things I want to do when I get back make me both smile but sad at the same time. Lol

I really really just want to lay down in Aldrich park and watch the sunset. I also really just want to hug my friends and tell them how much I missed them....this shift in the world has really opened my eyes to realizing how special a hug/laugh/smile is. 🥺💜"
UCI,fpj05rg,t3_gdr4xl,1588653014.0,Archive for online textbooks?
UCI,fpgy35h,t1_fpgxum5,1588611564.0,Yeah I panic also right when I saw the free response. It didn’t help that right at that moment my brother got home and started playing music out loud and opening and closing doors as he moved about the whole room......long story short I couldn’t even focus from then on :(
UCI,fpgxd4v,t1_fpgwjd9,1588611203.0,"Totally agree. The thing is, in my opinion, she explains everything very clearly and is actually a great lecturer. It’s her grading system (why the fuck am I losing 5 points for missing ONE/FIVE of the requirements need for a binomial prob) and how she expects us to be able to go above and beyond but doesn’t prep us for it. Like this past midterm.....the free response.....WHY DIDNT THE PRACTICE MIDTERM LOOK LIKE THAT."
UCI,fpfia4p,t1_fpfh6gl,1588572077.0,I agree with this.
UCI,fpfgmla,t3_gd3rpk,1588570657.0,"Hi! So I say it depends on how confident you are on your pre-calc skills. The main reason students fail 2A is because they forgot everything they learned in high school (very basics such as exponent rules). Not only do you have to know this info, but also be able to apply it without thinking.

Hence, if you feel confident in your skills then I say you should be okay...just be prepared to be spending a lot of time studying for it."
UCI,fpfge02,t3_gd56dq,1588570458.0,"I’m currently taking all for a letter grade. However, I’m really considering changing my Econ15b class to p/np because professor is being a real big pain :/"
UCI,fpfgb86,t3_gd5hla,1588570394.0,"From past posts it seems like it varies depending on how “bad” the situations were. 

Also, are you saying that something happened at your house that violated uci code of conduct? It may help to give us a bit more info so that way we can see how deep of a situation it is ( of course only if you’re comfortable with it)."

UCI,fp3q89h,t1_fp003b6,1588283825.0,Yep this is how my midterm was for a class...the amount of EXTRA anxiety it gave me sucked :(
UCI,foztfzv,t3_gagwfm,1588196556.0,"How much would it cost? Also, which floor plan? (:"
UCI,foz42pv,t3_gadmnb,1588184339.0,"Rant: some teachers just aren’t understanding about the current circumstances and expect us to be performing as if everything is good.

Positive: I love spring because of all the pretty colored flowers 😍 I’ve been going on walks around my house (of course social distancing and all) and seeing everything blossom makes me smile (:"
UCI,fowq07f,t1_fowo6m7,1588124733.0,I definitely can relate. My friends and I have all sent her emails about the free response not being fair....so i suggest reaching out to her and stating her concerns....the more of us who do they more likely she’ll make a more fair midterm #2.
UCI,fosnhk7,t1_fosn4q2,1588034210.0,"From what I recall, it was a link in the bottom right. But not 100%....more this was like 2 almost 3 years ago lol"
UCI,fosmce2,t1_fosko2a,1588033555.0,"This happened 2ish years ago when I entered as a freshman....I got placed as undeclared.

In the portal there’s a section where it says submit a change of major request. All I did was choose business Econ and I got notified the next day. I remember being really surprised because the next day I was going to my spop and was worried because my SAT wasn’t high enough/ I didn’t take any type of calc/pre cal beforehand. But it worked 🤷🏽‍♀️

Also....20A isn’t too hard to get into the second quarter imo since a lot of Econ majors have already taken it.

Math 2a/2B there’s usually a lot of spots.....but be aware idk if anything is changing due to new circumstances of what’s going on :/"
UCI,fosk548,t3_g9cjy7,1588032293.0,Try switching to it now in your portal....I didn’t meet the pre requirements but the system still let me change.....🤷🏽‍♀️

UCI,fodmm3x,t3_g6wtka,1587686563.0,"I missed my second mandatory discussion yesterday......idk what happened. I had it on my google calendar and everything, but for some reason when the time came I just totally forgot. It wasn’t until like 11pm I realized I didn’t attend. 

After like an hour of being mad at myself, I realized “ hey there’s nothing I can do about it now. I just have to be more careful from now on”. I guess what I’m trying to say is let’s not be too hard on yourself during times like these. Our lives were changed in a matter of weeks/months, so we can’t expect ourselves to live up to the same expectations as before. We gotta be realistic with our expectations, and also step back and realize that we can’t be so hard on ourselves when there’s so much shit happening both within and outside of the classroom. (:

At least this is what I think 🤷🏽‍♀️"
UCI,focpxgp,t3_g6tqet,1587674320.0,"Just had a breakdown.....saw this post and I couldn’t stop laughing at the perfect timing.

Thank you for reminding me that i still gotta remember of the good stuff during these harsh times. 💜"

UCI,fo7amyu,t3_g64976,1587575093.0,"I’m tired of my brothers being so disrespectful. Last night I was studying at midnight, when my older brother came home from being at his friend’s house. I’m studying at the kitchen table when he proceeds to start watching Netflix on speaker on the couch not to far from our kitchen. I ask him to put some headphones on because 1. My parents have work tomorrow and are sleeping and 2) Im studying at this time cuz it’s quiet. He proceeds to tell me to quit “bitchin “ and that if I’m in kitchen I shouldn’t expect quiet. 

Multiple times while I’m working, that requires me to be on zoom, he’s being loud in the background. Once I told him to please be quiet cuz the people could hear him, he loudly idgaf not my problem. Not only was that embarrising, but he’s 26 for fucks sake.

It also pisses me off that he moved back from San Jose to stay with us during this pandemic, BUT he isn’t following any of the rules my parents put for us if we decided to come back home. I personally don’t like any of them, but follow them, because even tho I’m 20 I have respect and am thankful that they’re letting me stay with them during these times. He on the other hand goes and hangs out with friends every night, doesn’t help clean, etc and it’s really pissing me off....plus my parents don’t tell him anything cuz they know how loud and angry he gets. 

Thanks for letting me vent. Stay safe."
