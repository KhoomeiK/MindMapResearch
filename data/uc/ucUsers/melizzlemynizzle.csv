UCSantaBarbara,foyvlue,t3_gad7tb,1588179996.0,Please just do your best to be brutally honest and extremely transparent. I’d rather find out on reddit and commit elsewhere than find out in the fall when it’s too late :(
ApplyingToCollege,fo5g2qn,t1_fo5fwch,1587524789.0,This was incredibly helpful ❤️ can’t thank you enough
ApplyingToCollege,fo56kz5,t3_g5pfm3,1587518616.0,"I’m a pre-law student with philosophy or political science as my major 

LMU, UW, UCSD, and SDSU honors 

LMU: 
Pros: 
- in Los Angeles so it’s the closest to home 
- grade inflation rather than deflation 
- my older sister goes there 
- I already committed there... just to get good housing but still idk it was in my bio and people posted for me 
- I want to go to law school and Loyola law school would be great 
- my best friend from high school and her other best friend are going with me and we put in a request for a triple room!! This is huge for me because I get so nervous talking to people and I’ve had no luck meeting a roomate off of the Facebook group and my biggest concern about college is being lonely 

Cons: 
- my best friends from high school and her other best friend are going there... I feel like there could be a jealousy or exclusion conflict? I’d like to say I’m an adult and it won’t matter but it just might. Also, I won’t grow as a person 
- not very prestigious but judgmental family members know I’m going for my sister so they’re more ok with it 

UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON: 
Pros: 
- great football and spirit 
- huge campus 
- good prestige 
- I actually like the weather 

Cons: 
- I don’t know much about it 
- Greek life is HUGE here and incredibly essential but I’m concerned I might not make a good sorority 
- grade deflation 
- huge lecture halls (which I don’t mind) but it’s harder getting research or letters of recommendation 
- I know nobody going here 
- I’ve heard some people love it but others hate it 
- sort of seems like you’re on your own and nobody cares about your success 

UCSD: 
Pros: 
- most prestige (I hate to admit it... but that’s kind of important to me) 
- people there seem less superficial and image obsessed which I really like to be honest 
- I know a couple people there 
- parents love this option 

Cons: 
- the GEs for Marshall are ridiculous and require lots of science courses (I know it’s not revelle or anything but it’s also not Muir!!) 
- grade deflation 
- socially dead with lots of nerdy people tbh... I don’t think I fit in there, I got super lucky and that’s the only reason I got in 

SDSU honors: 
Pros: 
- I have a close friend who goes there currently
- the girls seem super fun!! But idk if they’d like me, I like to party but I don’t look like the classic surfer party girl 
- great football and basketball and spirit 
- the honors program is a good opportunity 
- the honors dorms are literally beautiful with so many amenities but you basically have to triple 
- great social scene 

Cons: 
- sororities are a big part of social life here 
- I left all the group chats for SDSU when I committed to lmu... kind of awkward lol
- not much more prestigious than LMU and not much cheaper since I got scholarships to LMU so I don’t know 
- parents wouldn’t like this option 
- I’ve heard it’s hard to get into required classes and honors students don’t have priority registration 

USD: 
Pros: 
- beautiful campus 
- YOU ALL GET RANDOM ROOMATES!! I love that! So much less pressure! I hate Facebook grouping and all of that stuff and if EVERYONE gets a random roomate based off of a detailed survey then it’s fine right? 
- same price as public schools cuz of scholarships 

Cons: 
- not prestigious 
- idk I haven’t put much thought into this one lol"
