Yup, being the fist model of the 700 v2, low stock numbers overall and never re-stocked makes them highly coveted.  That is one L I still regret, not being able to cop that shoe on release day because it was a YS exclusive and the website sucks balls trying to cop things."

GooglePixel,fosi0xt,t3_g7lwcp,1588031103.0,"So my wife took part of the free repair for healthcare workers.  Process was smooth.  Go into store, show your ID (they will take a photo of it), tell them what you want done.  Had the back glass back (which was cracked) replaced and since her phone was 2 years old, also had them replace the battery as well, might as well since the back was coming off anyways and the repair was free.  Pretty much did as much as we could, so not only was the case repaired, also has a new battery!

So only catch is only 1 phone repair per healthcare worker, can't bring in multiple phones to the same location.

&#x200B;

EDIT:  Also if you have a Samsung phone, they are repairing those free as well for healthcare workers."

Stopped at the stoplight and just killing time while waiting for the light to turn green, I look up and around.  Looked up at that apartment building and to my big surprise, there was a woman butt naked dressing herself up in her apartment in front of a window with no curtains/blinds.  Pretty obvious she either wanted to give a ""show"" or didn't care she was naked for all the world to see.  I pointed out to my wife and kids and my then 11 year old son was just busted out laughing.  Me growing up in SF and now live in the East Bay, I just told my wife and kids, ""Only in SF!"""
