UCSC,fpmqw0t,t1_fpmqtr6,1588739374.0,At least we know we will get 500 minimum !!!! Yasss
UCSC,fpmqj3w,t1_fpmpyog,1588739116.0,Dam I would keep an eye out for an appeal. I know people in other UC s who have contacted their financial aid and let them know their EFC has changed due to parents losing job or you etc. those people ended up getting some funds
UCSC,fpmpqig,t1_fpmpfca,1588738551.0,I know other UC s who have disbursed it already but had it posted on their financial aid award first and you could see how much was going to go through. I checked mine and looks the same. So I donâ€™t think they have updated everything yet. Hopefully they send the direct deposit weds or Friday .
UCSC,fpmpjl8,t1_fpmpfca,1588738415.0,I donâ€™t think so. It would have to post on the account activity first . Hopefully they send it tomorrow weds. Then if they do I would get it on Thursday .
UCSC,fpmpe6o,t3_ged0j1,1588738309.0,Wish it said how much . I need that mulaaaa
UCSC,fpmpd2g,t3_ged0j1,1588738287.0,Meeee
UCSC,fpl3g1c,t1_fpjh45r,1588705685.0,Yeah. Hopefully they come out with a form to fill out for those students to get that money soon ! Iâ€™m sure millions of parents went unemployed for so many college students. ðŸ˜­ Iâ€™ve heard friends who are using their financial aid ( not a lot) to help pay their parents rent etc now.
UCSC,fp7hqcj,t3_gbrd5c,1588370846.0,Omgggg zippy is the best !!!!!
UCSantaBarbara,fp756ut,t1_fp751qu,1588364257.0,Wow!  Hopefully this is the same case in UCSC . I was figuring that having a dependent might have increased chances of getting more money from the school care grant
UCSC,fp55jtn,t1_fp55h4o,1588317024.0,No itâ€™s different. Itâ€™s an amount given to the universities. They keep half for lost expenses . And the other half is suppose to go directly to students . This is separate from the stimulus checks.
UCSantaBarbara,fp55a2a,t1_fp557mj,1588316758.0,Oh wow ! Awesome thanks! I go to UCSC and prob the UCs will be similar in awards etc. Iâ€™m an independent student too so hopefully that is it !
UCSantaBarbara,fp543ni,t1_fp53ix4,1588315661.0,Yeah I know people with EFC $0 got $1100. Wondering if students with dependents could have gotten more ?
UCSantaBarbara,fp53us4,t1_fp53nyg,1588315434.0,Oh I meant from the Cares portion that UCSB had to disburse for students ( not the stimulus check)
UCSC,fp50i0c,t1_fp50coj,1588312472.0,Iâ€™m hoping UCSCwill be similar to UCSB where the awards range up to $1500. I could use 1100 ðŸ˜­someone on fb (think sua president) said they will try to disburse tomorrow . I know people in UCSB said they got the money first before they received an official email about it . So hopefully UCSC will try to start pushing these funds out prontoooo
UCSC,fp4zunp,t3_gbce7a,1588311929.0,Seriously ! UCSB already got that mula ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­
UCSantaBarbara,fp4yzlj,t1_fp2o4zx,1588311216.0,Do you have a dependent ? Iâ€™m from Ucsc and hoping they work this similar to UCSB. I have EFC of $0 but I have a kid ? Not sure how ur situation is
UCSC,fp4y1f2,t3_gar2uo,1588310445.0,What?!? No way ! Wow I need this money nowwwww
UCSC,fp15ss1,t1_fp0s53p,1588225204.0,Hahahahaha this made my day
UCSC,foyhx7x,t1_foxqtmi,1588172833.0,"Yeah , he is in his last year. He is awesome"
UCSC,fowznse,t3_ga1vqi,1588130642.0,"Loving  the color burst. Out of all my classes I feel that he really, genuinely cares about each one of us ðŸ˜­ and our mental health. He is constantly getting teaching feedback from us and actually listens ðŸ˜­ itâ€™s his first time teaching and so glad to be part of his first class ðŸ˜­ðŸ¤— go Zippy!!(his nickname)"
UCSC,fm8ke42,t3_ft9bn6,1585850972.0,Omggg !! I took that class last year with the prof! He is so nice and cares about his students !!! Aw feel so bad for him struggling with tech.
