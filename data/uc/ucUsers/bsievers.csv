Sacramento,fo10cna,t1_fo0gqa7,1587423223.0,"There’s plenty of leeway on whether or not to approve protests, primarily concerned with “is this protest safe for the public”. 

I would have liked them to have approved it, but required social distancing to be followed. Same as the Governor’s statements. Then everyone who violated that could have been fined."
IdiotsInCars,fo0uftp,t1_fo0t4yc,1587419966.0,"Nope. That’s the standard definition used for window tint. As you can see from it being a quote from the page you cited. 

In none of my optics courses would we have used tint like that. It’s too tied to color theory. We used transparency for materials that obey snell’s law and translucence for others."
CorporateFacepalm,fo0sg7q,t3_g50t4q,1587418914.0,Well yeah. If they have info on John smith but that info isn’t tied to this “don’t sell my data” request then they can’t fulfill the request.
IdiotsInCars,fo0qcis,t1_fo0nj4y,1587417817.0,"There’s no legal difference in CA:


Cal. Veh. Code § 360

Current through 2020 Legislative Session
Section 360 - ""Highway"" defined
""Highway"" is a way or place of whatever nature, publicly maintained and open to the use of the public for purposes of vehicular travel. Highway includes street.

But the turning car is 100% at fault here."
IdiotsInCars,fo0pfa0,t1_fo0o66p,1587417324.0,"Yes. That agrees with me. I cited the less restrictive of the two:

> Front seat side windows: up to 88% tint darkness allowed with aftermarket film – up to 70% tint darkness allowed if combined with factory-tinted windows

That’s light *allowed through* so a higher number is less tint.

Edit from your source:

> A HIGHER VLT means that more light is allowed to pass through the window tint film.
Example: a 75% tint will allow 75% of the light to pass through whereas a 5% tint will only allow 5% of the light to pass through, making the 5% tint a much darker film.

> What is the Legal Tint Darkness Allowed For Passenger Vehicles In Florida:
>Front seat side windows: up to 28% tint darkness allowed

Florida windows can be way WAY darker than Ca"
IdiotsInCars,fo0jpjr,t1_fo0f65e,1587414365.0,Ca allows for a 30% tint. It needs to PASS 70% of light.
IdiotsInCars,fo0jkww,t1_fo0ff1v,1587414298.0,Ca basically doesn’t allow any tint on the front.
