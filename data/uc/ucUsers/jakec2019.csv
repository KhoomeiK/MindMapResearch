CallOfDutyMobile,fpfxm7a,t1_fpfwwiu,1588587355.0,Maybe he was doing the no kill challenge
CallOfDutyMobile,fpelln2,t1_fpcxli0,1588549917.0,Had it happen to me where even when I was wearing flak jacket it went for a guy I just killed and killed me and I was kinda pissed
CallOfDutyMobile,fpdwell,t1_fpdw5pf,1588535582.0,But from today on if you think about it there’s 28 days left in the month so that’ll be 280 crates if I do 10 a day so 280 crates should be enough for the Bk as long as I don’t have the worst luck in the world
CallOfDutyMobile,fpdutog,t3_gcvnuy,1588534679.0,I’m gonna grind 10 tiers a day until I get that skin

CallOfDutyMobile,fpbhsuq,t3_gciaaf,1588470324.0,Nope practice v ai medals don’t count in your profile nice try though
CallOfDutyMobile,fpbhq5w,t1_fpbae2r,1588470277.0,That’s why you can tell good br players by their average damage not rank cuz anyone can sit around like an idiot and camp but not many can run around have fun rush squads and get 10-15+ kills consistently
CallOfDutyMobile,fpb5o52,t3_gcgcx7,1588462636.0,That’s why you never buy crates
CallOfDutyMobile,fpb4b0h,t3_gcg19t,1588461816.0,Doesn’t fast throw anymore they nerfed it
CallOfDutyMobile,fpaz15b,t3_gce0rl,1588458675.0,Legendary in br means nothing these days I’ve seen legendaries with average damages of 300 who can’t play for shit they just get carried to legendary by the number of bots in br and the lenient ranking point system
CallOfDutyMobile,fpa5c5h,t3_gc95yh,1588441124.0,Yeah played ftl guys a decent number of times before and they seemed pretty good
CallOfDutyMobile,fpa4rci,t3_gc9yg5,1588440791.0,One bit crossmapped me with a tac scope dlq on crossfire I was kinda pissed
CallOfDutyMobile,fpa4k5h,t3_gca7wd,1588440676.0,I’m gonna open 10 at a time because I do want a better chance of getting it but it’s very useful this season who knows if it’ll be nerfed next season so...
CallOfDutyMobile,fp925md,t3_gc3jp7,1588411411.0,In a sniping 1v1 you should never hardscope or kill with anything other than a sniper or else you’re a bad sport
CallOfDutyMobile,fp91kwb,t3_gc3axo,1588410792.0,Only on sniper classes on others run lightweight or flak jacket
CallOfDutyMobile,fp8t10h,t1_fp8sttm,1588402020.0,Never said that I said if it was only bots it wouldn’t mean anything but there was real people so props to him
CallOfDutyMobile,fp8s2x1,t1_fp8s09j,1588401133.0,It does matter a shit ton anyone can get a nuke against a team of bots
CallOfDutyMobile,fp8rwl7,t1_fp8ro2k,1588400970.0,It’s two bots and 3 real people on each team no matter how you look at it
CallOfDutyMobile,fp8dvw9,t1_fp8d74r,1588389844.0,In br it takes too long to lock on at least for when I tried it out I died before I could get a shot kff
CallOfDutyMobile,fp8ckft,t3_gbza0r,1588388935.0, Congrats you have beaten the game you don’t ever have to play again!

CallOfDutyMobile,fp6x8k0,t3_gbnknx,1588360175.0,Id rather have credits replace all of the green rarities since who uses those anyways
CallOfDutyMobile,fp543t4,t3_gbd25y,1588315664.0,I had one today and it was mayhem
CallOfDutyMobile,fp48vfn,t3_gb83l8,1588294024.0,Dude it has such a bad drop off at range even when shooting in the chest
CallOfDutyMobile,fp48qwj,t1_fp48pwq,1588293953.0,And they make you use tac scope on artic too disgusting
CallOfDutyMobile,fp3zzhz,t1_fp2oc3i,1588289008.0,Could switch to default skins when testing so you don’t get that response
CallOfDutyMobile,fp3mr10,t1_fp3mhkc,1588282049.0,Watch hawknests video if you use silencer long barrel isn’t necessary I’m pretty sure
CallOfDutyMobile,fp3cnem,t3_gb2w2y,1588276993.0,Once played a match with some guy who was complaining about having randoms and really shitting on randoms the whole lobby time before the game then everyone on our team goes around even in the tdm game and he goes 3-12. Always easier to blame others than your own noobness.
CallOfDutyMobile,fp3a5ya,t3_gb2lps,1588275761.0,Easy to dropshot so I do it

CallOfDutyMobile,fp2h2pj,t1_fp2gj0c,1588261638.0,Or if it’s including pubs
CallOfDutyMobile,fp2ejgk,t1_fp1tjzn,1588260386.0,That’s fair. But alert is a handicap in my opinion cuz they can hear you too and you have to play campy and can’t rush around so if it’s a situation where you have to go get the bomb or something like that you’re screwed
CallOfDutyMobile,fp194ph,t1_fp18r49,1588228002.0,Uav isn’t deadly just run smrs and shoot them down
CallOfDutyMobile,fp0yzvn,t1_fp0xlyd,1588220175.0,To all down voters if you think elite rank is hard you need really improve at this game shits as easy as it gets

CallOfDutyMobile,fp0xlyd,t1_fp0wrgn,1588219229.0,Dude it’s my smurf ranked is easy in elite even when solo queuing like I was in legendary it’s a different story but this is lower ranks
CallOfDutyMobile,fp0xin7,t1_fp0wmdk,1588219169.0,Haha haha I’m in legendary dead silence and flak jackets are must haves; hardline and persistence combo sounds nice but in ranked games isn’t worth in the end
CallOfDutyMobile,fp0whak,t3_ganihi,1588218489.0,Bk57 and msmc best guns in ranked rn no cap and that class is ass tier on anything other than domination
CallOfDutyMobile,fozwoez,t1_fozb9xm,1588198199.0,You make it to legendary with 8kd?
CallOfDutyMobile,fozb6tv,t1_fozb4gz,1588187734.0,Yes for a smurf account if you only play ranked
CallOfDutyMobile,fozb0iz,t1_foyqvr9,1588187649.0,2.4 kd is good if you only play ranked and get to legendary
CallOfDutyMobile,fozai3j,t3_gacvzd,1588187404.0,Agile nerf makes quickscoping harder now smh
CallOfDutyMobile,fozacvk,t3_gafbi6,1588187336.0,Yes they got mad buffed they can aimbot shred you long range now. Had a game where a bot went positive against real players

CallOfDutyMobile,fox44yg,t1_fox2dy0,1588133626.0,I’ll play with you on my smurf account
CallOfDutyMobile,fox3j7f,t1_fox2o8s,1588133215.0,Not for me

CallOfDutyMobile,fowji6g,t3_g9yeb7,1588120999.0,How does that screen record thing work? Is it already on my iPhone?
CallOfDutyMobile,fowj5vs,t3_g9yx3m,1588120807.0,Asm10 still a beast in ranked
CallOfDutyMobile,fotkg4l,t3_g9i6c2,1588056704.0,The real issue here is that you use light mode
CallOfDutyMobile,fotfcev,t1_fotf3eq,1588052293.0,"For sniper I would use agile, vulture, dead silence if you wanna run around; flak jacket, anything you want, and alert if you wanna hardscope and camp, and use Molotov shock rc and uav for free kills and ultra fast cycles"
CallOfDutyMobile,fotf277,t3_g9hc0r,1588052062.0,If you want an easy nuke do crossfire dom and camp with a sniper at 4 in the morning so no ones on the server so it’s all bots
CallOfDutyMobile,fote2s2,t1_fotbxh0,1588051269.0,"They should nerf the striker, m21, and xpr too soccermom too op with those shots"
CallOfDutyMobile,fot9vrt,t3_g9ghf9,1588048096.0,This better be a joke post
CallOfDutyMobile,fopc6c6,t3_g8smde,1587957861.0,From my experience it’s generally looked down upon to hardscope in a 1v1 snipes but every 1v1 is different I suppose
CallOfDutyMobile,foosedn,t1_foos9uh,1587945465.0,Honestly it’s probably cuz I just transitioned to 3 finger so I’m not used to it
CallOfDutyMobile,foorutf,t1_foorpnn,1587945135.0,Took that out cuz I have lower masters I play with too and I realized you can put pro 5s in a lobby with legendaries or you have a master 2/3 as the host. You look like you have really solid stats
CallOfDutyMobile,foorknn,t3_g8pb7i,1587944961.0,Added you I got solid squads on the regular and good clan
CallOfDutyMobile,foopx5i,t1_fooket0,1587943975.0,With two thumbs I don’t think you can drop shot while shooting but you can drop shot before shooting unless you have a unique hud like you’re saying. I just started using 3 fingers and drop shotting isn’t the easiest and I don’t even see it around that much in legend rank
CallOfDutyMobile,fooj9kg,t3_g8nh4p,1587940063.0,Get skills

CallOfDutyMobile,folhwfr,t3_g84zpz,1587862584.0,How did u get 35 kills
CallOfDutyMobile,folhum6,t1_folevsk,1587862554.0,That’s a good rank but is the 2.4 kd rank exclusive? If you don’t know go to leaderboards and click rank kd and it will show you. If you have a 2.4 rank kd I’d like to invite you to trying out for my clan definitely.
CallOfDutyMobile,foldxlw,t1_folcyjn,1587860167.0,Nah I mean what rank and what kd
CallOfDutyMobile,fol5cwr,t3_g81qy6,1587855200.0,How are you in mp?
CallOfDutyMobile,fokfvql,t1_fokb62k,1587841308.0,Also I checked your profile and recent games and it does appear that most of your games are against all bot enemy teams sorry to break it to you (you can tell by the names)
CallOfDutyMobile,fokflkj,t1_fokb62k,1587841161.0,"You play on global or a different server? Never takes me that long even when I solo que on legendary. Pro 3 isn’t bad and a 2.8 kd for that is solid though. For me I think of kd for master and above as anything below 1 is bad, between 1 and 1.5 is decent (where I’m at because I’m always the one who plays objective on my team like staying behind in the hardpoint), between 1.5 and 2 is good 2-3 is great, and anything above that is amazing for ranked."
CallOfDutyMobile,fok9gop,t1_fok6y30,1587837889.0,"No 11,000 way into legendary"
CallOfDutyMobile,fok4tuz,t3_g7x3ja,1587835428.0,I got to 11000 trophies without knowing you could turn that shit off lmao
CallOfDutyMobile,fok4kx7,t1_fojh7m1,1587835301.0,Also what rank are you? The more ranked you play and the more objective based playing you do the less your rank kd becomes. Not saying you’re a noob or anything just saying I can’t gage how good you are yet
CallOfDutyMobile,fok4dvs,t1_fojad4a,1587835196.0,I mean like people that play just as bad as bots because they’re noobs or new to the game
CallOfDutyMobile,foj9mrv,t3_g7rs8i,1587813805.0,"I could create an account to get an infinite kd in pubs by playing crossfire domination sniping matches at times when no ones on the server, a good pubs kd sounds cool but means nothing. A ranked kd means a lot more because that’s consistently against real players."
CallOfDutyMobile,foj5489,t3_g7qw8d,1587808742.0,Nice
CallOfDutyMobile,foj3rtr,t3_g7qszf,1587807214.0,Whenever I lose 3-4 in a row I stop don’t wanna continue with a bad mindset and keep on losing

CallOfDutyMobile,foetdlh,t1_foeomfk,1587714096.0,I once went into a world chat group and the host was shitting on randoms and said he doesn’t want to deal with trash like that then he went 3-15 in a crossfire tdm game and everyone else on our team went close to even kd wise and he rage quit the group after that
CallOfDutyMobile,foe9fds,t3_g6yjdd,1587698745.0,Could try scrims
