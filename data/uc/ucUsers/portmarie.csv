936 Irving St, San Francisco, CA 94122

(Cozy neighborhood one-stop shop for Japanese spices, stocks & grocery items, plus take-out foods.)

The owners are a very nice couple, the wife has been sewing different styles of cloth mask.    They are setup with all the necessary precautions: owners wear masks, installed plexiglass at the register and have hand sanitizer to use at the credit card machine.  Their store like many other SF stores is not getting that much foot traffic and clearly the lack of tourism will hurt their business."

UCSantaBarbara,fo9ikxm,t1_fo5pg34,1587620552.0,"I believe she is the top person of the eye clinic, so if the complaints aren't going above her then basically any complaints get swept under the rug with a ""it's not me, it's all my rude student patients"".  

I was NOT rude to Nichols, why would I be?   Nichols was rude numerous times to me, for the most basic questions, even when I stated the contacts were blurry and gave me a migraine, both visits same behavior, and I left her office thinking ""welp I can't trust that prescription, I need to get a second opinion"".  I've been wearing glasses and then contacts since 2nd grade, I'm pretty used to eye exams at this point, but her demeanor was something I've never experienced from any doctor.  

If you want your voice to be heard (there have been numerous valid posts even within a couple days and sadly a few visits which ended in tears) the complaints need to go above some BS non-confidential system.  Head clinic supervisor, insurance provider, optometrist board or all three."

I will be filling out the UCSB clinic complaint form as well as calling the insurance to file a complaint.  I've never complained (or had a reason to complain) about Dr office care, but if this optometrist had her own practice it wouldn't stay in business."

100% my experience!  Thank you for this post, I thought that it might have just been me or she was having a bad day (both times I came into the office).  I was really shocked repeatedly by how she handled the visit, the clear uninterest in trying to answer my questions, and dismissed my concerns when I shared that the new contacts were blurry and I had a migraine almost the whole trial period week.  Basically, I left the second visit thinking, I don't trust that this is the correct contact for me, I'm not going to fill this prescription, and now I need to see a new optometrist somewhere else.  

With everything going on, I haven't been able to schedule a second opinion.  It was a waste of my time, certainly my money, and I wouldn't go back.  I plan to file a complaint with our insurance and/or the UCSB health clinic and I would encourage others to share their experience too."

Sure, CCs aren't the same ""experience"" but neither is graduating with double the amount of debt.

Additionally, many people around the world take cold showers, or ""bucket"" showers, similar to what our great great grandparents did.  Personally, I experienced this for 5 months living in a colder region of South America.  It was less than ideal, freezing experience, and I showered much less because of it.  Not saying this is a solution, but it is the ONLY option for many areas of the world even on the best of days."

The owner of this building should control this situation by firmly telling the tenants that THEY can not lock you out of the power box.  Every time the box is locked, you call the owners ... eventually the owners will have to step up their ""don't lock the box"" conversation.

Sorry you are dealing with, what should be a normal conversation amongst neighbors with an adult resolution."
