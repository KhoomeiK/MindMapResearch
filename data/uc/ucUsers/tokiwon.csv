berkeley,fosglc1,t3_g7jisc,1588030301.0,It's hard but doable! I know two people who did the BioE/ChemBio simultaneous degree. One is now doing her PhD @ Caltech.

You can look up their papers via google scholar. If you can't access them due to subscriptions, just plug the link into [sci-hub.tw](https://sci-hub.tw)"
berkeley,fnuwqef,t1_fmu0ctr,1587273160.0,">e application requires a personal statement as to why you want to transfer, and they won't take ""because I didn't want to apply to the CoE"" as an answer. I'm not accusing you, but some applicants would apply to L&S and then try to transfer to the CoE, thinking that they can bypass the difficulty of applying directly to the CoE. The application reviewers will be aware of this, and will be wary of a student who immediately wanted to change into the CoE when they arrive at Cal.

As a Berkeley BioE alum, I can most certainly say that doubling in CS and MCB: Neuro track (or MCB and EECS) would provide you with a stronger foundation for neuroengineering than the BioE major itself."
bioengineering,fnuw03l,t1_fnuvacf,1587272589.0,"I work in a Wyss-affiliated lab rn, but not in the organ-on-chip space. My undergraduate research was solely dedicated to it though."
bioengineering,fnuvdq5,t1_fn8sp0g,1587272100.0,This is the biggest factor. I chose a 'lesser' known program simply for the opportunity to work with a particular faculty member that I felt matched my research interests the best.
bioengineering,fnuv78k,t3_g37yjw,1587271959.0,"If you are intending to be pre-med, or interested in research at all (which BioE/BME is heavily invested in), BU or UIUC would be better programs imo, despite the expense."
bioengineering,fnuv07t,t3_g417id,1587271806.0,"Yep! I did for a while. Focus was on patient specific human induced pluripotent stem cell  (hiPSC) derived cardiac microphysiological systems.

We used this system as (i) a drug testing test bed for different pharmacological substrates; (ii)  for understanding the underlying biophysical and metabolic mechanisms in which hiPSC-derived cardiomyocytes mature; and (iii) for studying the molecular mechanisms of arrhythmia using various gene knockout hiPSC-cardiomyocytes"
