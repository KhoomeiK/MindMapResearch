Thank you Jesus, thank you Lord!"

news,fn5yzb6,t1_fn5wwhw,1586680982.0,"Burlingame is a pretty rich town and during in the daytime the streets are full of moms in lululemons and packs of teens grabbing Starbucks and shit. At night it's empty like you described simply because it's mostly families that live there and they don't go out. The nice restaurants around the bars are always packed but once the restaurants, boutiques and nail salons close, it becomes a ghost town. The bars are empty because it's halfway up the peninsula, neither here nor there, and the demographic is as described...families that usually stay home at night. The bars that do exist in Bgame are mostly shitty dive bars with janky pool tables. I guess they might attract the crowd you described, probably from a neighboring town like San Bruno or South City. In my experience bars in general close up early in Burlingame bc nothing is going on and it's not worth it for them to stay open, probably what happened with the first bar.

TLDR your husband can find better bars in San Mateo"
bayarea,fn5rzah,t1_fn515o2,1586673867.0,Yeah I just did this at Costco because I didn't realize they start the line way before the cash registers. So I stated walking to the registers and an employee called me back and turns out there was a short line. I laughed said sorry and went back in line because I genuinely didn't see it since I'm used to just walking to the registers and they were all open.

sanfrancisco,fmyybea,t1_fmyxu4q,1586499660.0,"Alright bro, sorry I went off on you. I get too into arguing and for some reason picked these ppl to defend. My situation checks all those boxes too. I had to fly across the country for work and haven't seen any of my friends or family since early March. My s.o. is in another country and who knows when we'll be able to travel without worrying again. Haven't been able to work out outside either cuz the weather in this state has been shitty."
sanfrancisco,fmyxhig,t1_fmywpxb,1586498855.0,"Sure that's fair. I would agree with you if it looked like they drew a crowd. I am giving them the benefit of the doubt and I bet they just filmed a video, packed up and left. But you gotta understand lots of ppl are cooped up with their whole family, lots with multiple kids. I think it's easier to be all high and mighty when you're a single young person isolating by yourself.. For families with kids and in other situations, this whole thing is harder than you can even imagine. All I'm saying is you gotta empathize with other people's situation. In a perfect world we would all have your composure and discipline and the whole thing would have been over in one month. 

I don't think what's happening in this picture is such an egregious violation of the order. If this were a regular thing these people did, or if he was there for hours and this turned into Venice Beach, then sure, that would be fucked up. But if going outside and taking a sick music video helps this family cope with the SIP, then it's not that big of a deal."
sanfrancisco,fmyw6up,t1_fmyv325,1586497651.0,"Yes you're wrong. A few ppl have said as much and you're still keeping it up.

It's not that big of a deal what they did. There's tons of other ppl in the picture that passed them and there doesn't seem to be a crowd. Do you know why? Probably bcuz they don't want to be in a crowd. 

Everyone is strained right now and who knows, maybe that kid's dad who is filming him lost his job too. You don't know their fucking situation and are choosing to blast them for this one moment in time. It's like when you are jogging around your block and someone shakes their head at you from their car, ""Those damn joggers, passing people on the sidewalk within 6 feet!"" They don't know that you're specifically running at odd hours and crossing the street when you see someone. Instead they make a bullshit assumption from one glance. You deal w your stress by going on runs. This family plays drums in the road. To each their own."
sanfrancisco,fmyot4o,t1_fmynxmu,1586491503.0,"What audience?? It looks like one household and a dude who doesn't care and is going to surf. They're in the middle of the fucking great highway lol. How is that so hard to understand?

I do understand and I've been in the same situation as you for 4 weeks, haven't seen my gf blah blah blah. Which is probably why I am picking arguments w a random dude on reddit. What these guys are doing doesn't seem to be anymore intrusive and way more fun."
sanfrancisco,fmyn2v3,t1_fmylulc,1586490227.0,"Is the order not to bring instruments outside wtf? You just agreed yourself that the order states it's fine for ppl to take walks outside. What if they live across the street and bring their drums, what is it to you? Sounds like you should bring a ukulele outside for a bit and chill out."
sanfrancisco,fmykkmv,t1_fmydp09,1586488419.0,Cuz they're tired of the SIP too and it looks like fun

news,fmuh5bv,t1_fmuczdp,1586391314.0,"Dude you don't even know if they let them know or not, maybe they did. The article doesn't go into those details. Why are you so caught up on that? Even if they let them know the day before, like you suggested, the administration likely couldn't find enough replacements on such short notice. Maybe they didn't want to try to replace them and instead did what the article described. Seems like a bigger stretch that a few dozen people conspired together late one night to fuck over their employer and their dying residents."
