cscareerquestions,fp55zpl,t3_gbdhz5,1588317463.0,"ah well fuck. internship rejection for the last company i did a final round with came a few days ago. i took summer classes last summer, and to be honest, after nearly two years straight of taking classes, i'm excited for a break to do what i want, gonna start writing a sports blog/podcast and i also want to pursue a personal project of some sort. 

not gonna pretend like it doesn't hurt though, really was looking forward to working somewhere, but it seems like my resume is gonna be trash for next fall. 400+ applications, t20 school, still barely got any interviews. it's on me, really haven't worked that hard since i've been at school - trying to turn it around this summer."

berkeley,fop7d44,t1_foop06b,1587954721.0,"That’s pretty rough, I’m sorry. I took Math 54 and I think bins were released then. Oh well, at least I know what to expect"
berkeley,foodqw3,t3_g8ltxi,1587937160.0,"meetings should take place over zoom or some call, to account for the remote people, except for maybe clubs where you build physical things"
Basketball,fonftkd,t3_g81m6n,1587918672.0,It’s never too late but you need to have a certain level of athleticism and then work hard on your game

berkeley,fom8c13,t3_g815o6,1587881308.0,Overall decent draft for the Bears. Davis and Hawkins will be studs too. We should see all three guys play well on special teams next year and hopefully they can crack the rotation on defense

raiders,foiaqwr,t3_g7lwzc,1587782348.0,His highlight tape is insane
nfl,foi0ar2,t1_fohzdq5,1587776119.0,Because he’s very injury prone and only two years younger than Luck when he retired. Seems like they’re getting a needed quality backup or the next franchise QB

It makes the top 10 so hard, because there’s great cases for Duncan, Shaq, Russell, etc. But without a doubt, Kobe is in that top tier of basketball players ever lived"
