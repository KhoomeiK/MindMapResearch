ucla,fowzivu,t3_g9xzb2,1588130554.0,"hey dude! i am interested in the same stuff as you! i talked to a professor on campus who actually does crime research (p cool dude imo) and basically, our options are none. he recommended majoring in psych/sociology to start off and then branching from there, but even he only uses grad students for his research. he does teach a course in the fall on crime, i was going to email him about soon and i can let you know if he still will this fall!"

to review your midterm, you have to go to a set hour with your TA and all of the other students they advise AND other students that can go at that time. there isn't enough print outs for each student, you don't get enough time to understand where you went wrong, and the TAs monitor what you write down (any explanations you right, any diagrams you draw, any sentences you write) on the paper you use for notes during this time period. you aren't allowed to do much of anything with the test or really go deep into your errors because you have <1 hour with many students sharing the same 1 test booklet and you aren't allowed to write where you went wrong. fixing midterm errors *sucks*

i also hate how the LS7 series won't let TAs answer any questions. they have to ask you a question to get you 'thinking,' which in reality (at least for me, and i mean this very nicely) wastes my time, the class time, and time that could be used to help other students. if i'm asking a question, i've already thought about it, already looked at my notes, at launchpad, etc, and i just need *help,* not a 10 minute discussion of me trying to explain what i don't know. i have never gotten clarification on anything from a TA before because they weren't 'allowed' to tell me

finally, i dislike the exams. they are tricky for the purpose of being tricky, and reading errors can hit ya like a train. i know the content pretty well and have tutored students in preparation for the exams on content they don't know. but alas, i have yet to score above a 79% on any exam. i am the queen of ls7 b+ final grades"

i remember i asked the CLC guy if my answer was right and we spent 6 minutes (i timed it) of jumping through like 20 hoops for him to tell me at the end i was right"
