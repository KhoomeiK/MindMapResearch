Of course it’s modified, but we’re trying to do the best we can for students."

AskReddit,fmvdubv,t3_fxn4ps,1586413596.0,"I tried to set a boundary to heal from my own trauma that had been brought up from a fight that we had had earlier. (Background: During this fight, they told me that my mental illness was affecting them and that I should add medication to what I already manage with therapy.) I told them we could talk about the specifics later when I had had time to calm down. They responded by moving out of our shared room, mind you I found it out through FACEBOOK, and haven’t spoken to me. About a month later, they sent me a text talking about how much they missed me.
I hate manipulation and I hate people who make your personal mental health journey all about them."

AskReddit,fmvd75i,t3_fxn594,1586412995.0,"I owe my life to a pig.

Edit:some people asked for a story so here’s the short version.

I was hiking around what was partially a cattle ranch and partially a state park when I accidentally flushed a couple wild pigs from their hiding place. I keep going on my way and I meet a cow. This cow starts following me before running away. About five minutes later I come upon this cow and the rest of it’s herd in a clearing. They didn’t look particularly aggressive so I kept on walking. Suddenly these cattle surround me and are closing in about to charge. Then from the distance a pig comes running across the clearing and the cattle run after it. I take my life and run like hell to my car."

Anyone can do a quick google search and find that lemon juice is too acidic for facial skin. You clearly wanted to embarrass your friend and have her be the guinea pig. That’s not what friends do. Take this as a lesson and hope that she doesn’t realize how manipulative this was."
