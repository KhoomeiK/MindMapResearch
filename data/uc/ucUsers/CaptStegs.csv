ucla,fphpvsr,t3_gd6jon,1588625630.0,"Honestly I think that /r/ucla is a bit of a south-campus echo chamber. It makes sense that politics is dominated by north-campus since it's a part of some of their career tracks. Consequently their platforms are more north-campus oriented. That being said, I am assuming (and hoping) that what people are learning in north-campus should generally make them better equipped to deal with social/political issues than south campus. After all, these people will end up being our future politicians and government leaders, unless we get some exceptions like Angela Merkel.


Edit: Forgot to mention that I think it’s good that we are not just being complicit with whatever the student government churns out and that’s something we should continue doing in the real world"

At UCLA, there are plenty of opportunities to get employed. There are two engineering career fairs in the fall/winter as well as a mechanical/aerospace career fair in the fall. Sometimes companies go out of their way to visit UCLA for the purposes of recruiting. In the past, Northrop Grumman, Orbital ATK (before they got owned by Northrop), Boeing, Hermeus (hypersonic startup), NAVAIR, Lockheed Martin Skunkworks, Tyvak (cube satellites), etc have visited. The Society of Women Engineers also hosts a dinner every year where anyone (any gender) and sit down and network/have dinner with company representatives. 


There are plenty of opportunities around, but it takes some effort to take the time away from your homework/friends/clubs to pursue them. Basically we don’t get spoon-fed here. 


As for whether or not the coursework will prepare you for industry, I think you’ll definitely get the background knowledge/fundamentals that you need. We have classes on CAD, manufacturing, FEA, and MATLAB, but I think it gives you just the foundations and not enough to comfortably enter industry. Joining a student group provides you the best opportunity to continually sharpen these skills as well as to get a jump on those courses."
ucla,fn1m3qg,t1_fn1cg9x,1586564944.0,"I think the aerospace program at UCLA is good, personally I don’t see what makes it different than other universities asides from a few courses and faculty. A lot of the professors here are crazy smart. One thing to note is that like all UC’s, UCLA is a research school, meaning that a lot of the coursework is more theoretical than hands-on.



If you’re into research, I encourage you to check out some of the MAE labs since that is actually many professors’ main job. I am taking courses right now with professors who’s research topics include hypersonics and using lasers to measure rocket stuff. Personally I’m not interested in research but am more into making things and joining student orgs, in fact, that’s where I spend most of my time. A typical technical project that an aerospace student can see themselves in include one that involve drones, RC planes, rockets, cars, robots, or even underwater robotics. Aside from technical projects, UCLA also has many engineering societies that are good for networking like the Society of Women Engineers and Theta Tau (coed fraternity). I’ve been taking the pill that says that these student orgs help prepare me for the field, but I don’t yet know if that’s the blue pill or the red pill.


One caveat of having more researched-focused professors is that eventually you’ll run into someone who isn’t a good teacher. Actually, a lot of times your math courses will be taught by someone new, that doesn’t mean that they will be bad though.


When it comes from comparing UCLA Aerospace to Berkeley, the first thing that comes to mind is that Berkeley doesn’t have an aerospace program, but I’m pretty sure students there can major in Mechanical Engineering and pretend to be an aerospace student. I just took a look at their curriculum and I see a lot of parallels until it gets real aerospacey. They actually have some courses that UCLA doesn’t have in its curriculum like Control of UAVs, Ocean Engineering, and Solared power vehicles. However, UCLA *blows them out of the water* if you are interested in spacecraft or rockets. We also have some more aerospace design courses like MAE 161C and MAE 154A where you get to design a spacecraft or an airplane respectively. Berkeley looks like it’s doing a better job with mechatronics/controls than we do. Also; I do think Berkeley has a cool capstone project though, since it has industry connections (but may or may not be aerospace related, I wouldn’t know the specifics). The aerospace capstone at UCLA is basically building a rocket and launching it, and it is probably the most hands-on a course can get. In my opinion that would be the best course to prepare you for industry. However, I have a lot of respect for schools like Cal Poly because they place an emphasis on hands-on learning. I don’t have time to dig through their curriculum or to investigate further, but I’m pretty sure they have more resources available to the general engineering student body than we do.



UCLA recently got a new big fat makerspace so 3D printing is incredibly accessible, but our machine shops, while they get the job done, are sorta weak. A lot of labs have some really cool machines like Haas CNCs, wind tunnels, better 3D printers, and wire-edm machines, but that will be hard to access unless you are a part of that lab. For opportunities specifically related to careers, I hear that the UCLA alumni network is actually pretty mediocre, or at least when compared to USC. Personally I think being a UCLA student did help me get some opportunities by shear luck, and I’ve also heard some stories about how being connected to professors can help get you into prestigious graduate programs. From what I’ve seen, after UCLA, a lot of aerospace students end up in Northrop Grumman, but many others go to graduate school, there are some who’ve gotten into SpaceX, some into NASA JPL, Raytheon, Lockheed Martin, etc.


Lastly, I want to mention that UCLA has a lot more to offer than aerospace. Things such as quality of life, food, the guaranteed 3-years of on-campus housing, athletics, squirrels, etc. could also factor into choosing the right college, but congrats on getting in! The acceptance rate last year for aerospace engineering was just 8.4%.


I hope a answered all of your questions and maybe some more, I really enjoyed procrastinating on my work to write this up. Feel free to let me know if you have any follow up questions."
