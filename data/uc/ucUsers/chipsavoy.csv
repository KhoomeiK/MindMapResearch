AskReddit,fnfc5pb,t3_g17ze6,1586905283.0,The scene in Inception where Cobb wakes up in the airplane after successfully pulling off inception Fischer. The score—“Time”—was composed by Hans Zimmer. Really fit the significance of the scene.
UCSantaBarbara,fn1rbss,t1_fn1owma,1586568303.0,"I’d def say that profs not being great at teaching depends on the dept. Some departments have really good (engineering, physics, history, others that I’m not remembering) professors and resources while others are crap. Some are also terrible at lower-div courses while upper div is better like math. Rate my prof is useful, but not necessarily the final arbiter of a prof’s teaching ability. 

I’ve heard—at least from my friends—that CAPS, the mental health resources center, is not that great (also **take care of your mental health**) their views are not necessarily representative of the wider community, but I’ve heard that complaint pretty frequently.

Also highly dependent on person, but sometimes it’s hard to make friends as much as SB has a great social scene. Everyone expects to make a tight knit friend group right out the gate, but it doesn’t happen for a lot of ppl. This was def my experience (which is why I said try to put urself out there). It’s NOT necessarily ur fault if this happens to u so don’t beat yourself up over it. Even after 4 years, I know a lot of ppl, but only have a couple close friends and I don’t even know if I can say I have a friend group. 

Landlords in IV are pretty shitty and will mostly always scam u out of ur security deposit, even if u live a spotless life. AS Legal resource center is good for advice on this. IV is also something of a magical place, but after a few years, even tho ur grateful for it, you’ll realize it’s kinda grimy haha. 

On a lighter note, i would say food options are not the best. Not terrible, but not great. Downtown SB is better than IV/Goleta."
UCSantaBarbara,fn1kwmt,t3_fyrf34,1586564198.0,"4th year here. mmm idk how everything would work if Fall quarter is online, but if i could re-do my freshman year I would do this: 

-reach out to ppl (ppl in ur dorms, upperclassmen, professors, TAs)

-join clubs, even ones that don’t seem to match your interests (you can always drop them later, but who knows you might make some great friends and develop new interests!)

-if people invite you to do stuff, say yes! Often I didn’t go out to the occasional party or hang-out bc of studying. It’s prob one of the few things I regret bc freshman year is prob the easiest yr to meet a lotttt of ppl. 


-utilize the on-campus academic resources. I wish I did this more because academics isn’t just limited to “schoolwork”. There are other things like research, mentoring, internships etc. that will broaden your intellectual horizons. Def would take advantage of that earlier if I went back. 

-network, network, network 

-take it easy ur first quarter. My 1st year self (and dare I say others) would kill me for saying this, but I honestly would not focus on academics too much. Not to say you shouldn’t aim for A’s or to neglect ur classes to the point of failing, but I think it’s more important to just give urself the room to adjust, make friends, explore the opportunities out there, and even just exploring SB etc. Classes will get harder as you get older so just really try to enjoy the freedom u have freshman year.  


-oh oh also try to take a variety of classes. I was a chem major and then I switched to math and then finally to history all bc I happened to take one interesting history class my sophomore year. You never know what’s going to happen! :) 


I could write so much more haha. DM if you need help with anything"
