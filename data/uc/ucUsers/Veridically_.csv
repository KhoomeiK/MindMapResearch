I would go to the ER once a week on average because I always thought I was dying. What helped me was learning very many signs and symptoms of common diseases and learning how to assess myself from my neurologist. This helps because you can reassure yourself before the anxiety takes root, before it builds a base and trains troops. The more I researched and read and spoke to my doctors, especially my neurologist, the more I learned to head off the anxiety as it started."
