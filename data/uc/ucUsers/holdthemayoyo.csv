AskReddit,fnywc9x,t3_g4nvle,1587378118.0,"The time I was ordering a burrito and combined the words “beans” and “please” and asked the worker for some “bleans”.

Or the time I ordered a happy meal at McDonalds for the first time. The worker asked me “Girl or Boy?” bc the Toys were gendered. I misheard this as “Grilled or Boiled” for some reason, and said “Boiled please” and she asked me to repeat myself and I confidently said it again. It wasn’t until got my food and got the boy selection of Toy that I realized. Poor girl. I’m surprised she didn’t laugh at me but she was probably too confused to react."
