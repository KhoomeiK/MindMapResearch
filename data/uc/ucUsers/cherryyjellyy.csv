ucr,fpm3nuy,t3_ge9nnw,1588724901.0,I hate this uncertainty omg
ucr,fplqvvm,t1_fplmtd7,1588717746.0,"I get what you mean but while you want school to remain closed it‚Äôs affecting so many other people.  It‚Äôs obvious that it won‚Äôt open fully anyway. Most schools are starting to adopt the option of online even if it is in person. 

You can do that."
ucr,fpkd17q,t3_gdrwg9,1588692450.0,Well the blue and gold opportunity plan just paid for my tuition to be honest. I paid my housing with the pell grant and a bit of loans.
ucr,fpkcono,t3_gdz8i0,1588692268.0,"Why freshman‚Äôs instead of seniors, wouldn‚Äôt seniors deserve to enjoy their last year being on campus? It makes more sense to allow seniors and freshmen and not sophomores or juniors"
ucr,fpimn2u,t1_fpifn9g,1588644081.0,I think just a notice of the amount
ucr,fphxtpv,t1_fphxm0t,1588629802.0,"Do you remember around what part of the video he said that? I only watched the part where he talked about grad students being on campus etc. 

I mean there‚Äôs a lot of people still on campus housing now isn‚Äôt there? I feel like people would like to remain on campus bc being home around family makes online classes harder and people need a break from that."
ucr,fphxehy,t1_fphvqp9,1588629578.0,Wait no wayyy he said housing?!!! Wtf they‚Äôre gonna kick us out?
ucr,fphtocd,t3_gdjwnt,1588627609.0,They should just cancel fall or something based on the spring update.
ucr,fphnot4,t3_gdj9em,1588624493.0,Yeah...it‚Äôs based off your EFC
ucr,fphljfp,t1_fphl2kb,1588623400.0,I‚Äôm not sure it started off positively then it ended bad. It sounded almost like an official statement.
ucr,fphkzlg,t3_gdj252,1588623123.0,I‚Äôm really depressed about it. Like not even labs or discussions? Why not. Other schools are doing it and we start later.
ucr,fphjl46,t3_gdhzgv,1588622415.0,I only cared about the fall update. He gave me hope then his ‚Äúbet‚Äù ripped it away üò≠
raisedbyborderlines,fpeam18,t3_gcsaro,1588543692.0,With schools being closed I have to be back at my parents house and I have to be here for Mother‚Äôs Day. I don‚Äôt want to do anything for her or get her anything and I know she will throw a fit if I don‚Äôt and it gives me so much anxiety.
ucr,fpe1o8a,t3_gcxp5n,1588538586.0,What pisses me off is that one of my professors doesn‚Äôt upload the lectures on time like I have the class time reserved I‚Äôm not going to be watching your lectures at 5 pm or later if I had the class around 12

ucr,fp7oz6n,t3_gbrh65,1588374835.0,Can someone tell me why all the schools are changing to ‚Äúcan‚Äôt guarantee housing?‚Äù Actual question.

ucr,fozz51l,t3_gadcmv,1588199476.0,If this is true then as a transfer I would have only spent one fucking quarter at UCR. Wtf.
ucr,fozxn7h,t1_fozv7ey,1588198697.0,Guaranteed??? What else did he say
ucr,foz8uzt,t3_gadcmv,1588186619.0,If she‚Äôs the dean of CNAS is it just moving cnas online or the entire university?
ucr,foz7n50,t3_gadcmv,1588186040.0,"What the fuck!!!!! This is insane 

Enrollment will drop drastically if it really is online the entire year. I just recently transferred no way do I want to spend the majority of my time at UCR online."
ucr,fowzms6,t1_fowx0ca,1588130625.0,Winter and spring being online is insane and unrealistic.
ucr,fowckfm,t1_fow1pqi,1588117162.0,Lmao wtf that wasn‚Äôt the point of his post
ucr,fowcg9x,t3_g9uk7e,1588117100.0,Message me. I‚Äôm going through something similar. We can probably help each other / push each other during these horrible times in these toxic environments we are stuck me.
ucr,fowc7hp,t3_g9wddh,1588116969.0,"Look at the plans our governor just released today, he might reopen schools july - August with implemented safety measures. We start like October first (?) so this gives me some hope that we will be back fall (with probably safely measured / maybe only small classes) but it‚Äôs still better than completely online"
ucr,fovkx1g,t3_g9q9q3,1588103056.0,I didn‚Äôt get anything at all
ucr,fohx4qh,t1_fohsqhj,1587774349.0,I did the resigning though.
ucr,fohc14i,t3_g7gtf5,1587763444.0,Imma go crazy if I have to be here one more quarter I‚Äôm definitely going back whether it‚Äôs online or not.
ucr,foh2h1d,t1_fofqeln,1587759773.0,"If let‚Äôs say I cancel this week, will it affect my 2020-2021 contract? Like will I have to move out all my stuff then move it back in during fall?"
ucr,foby05l,t3_g6fwu6,1587664937.0,Same wtf is it
ucr,fo9drsn,t1_fo965t6,1587616770.0,When did they change the policy??
ucr,fo7iqh4,t1_fo7gnty,1587579021.0,"Omg they probably paid to share the room so I guess they paid like 300 and something?

The kitchen is small but since it‚Äôs just two of us who cook at different times then it‚Äôs fine tbh, the dining / living area is big enough for our table and prob some furniture if we had some LOL

the rooms are spacious imo? Idk if every apartment is the same but my rooms pretty big tbh"
ucr,fo79dnt,t1_fo7509b,1587574488.0,"I think it‚Äôs the most convenient! It‚Äôs got the RSO where you pick up packages / housing questions and an amazon locker, laundry rooms, a pool, and a sandwich restaurant plus the school‚Äôs bar. It‚Äôs the closest to the school / gym and the bus stop is right in front. Like I said it looks old and rusty on the outside but the inside is modern. As far as I know there‚Äôs different types of apartments some furnished some are not. Mines wasn‚Äôt but still a good deal. A loft apartment is basically an apartment with two rooms one for you one for your roommate. Rent is about 640 which is like half of what the other apartments / glen mor charge for your own room. The reason why it‚Äôs so cheap is bc since it‚Äôs a loft it doesn‚Äôt have a door but that can easily be fixed with a curtain or a room cover / slider thing (I literally blanked on the name right now)"
ucr,fo6t944,t3_g5tp69,1587566297.0,Bannockburn is rusty looking but nice inside
90DayFiance,fo4rubi,t1_fo2ojvs,1587509997.0,"Merced probably but riverside not anymore. It‚Äôs harder to get into now, 2.4 doesn‚Äôt cut it anymore either."
ucr,fo4pkht,t1_fo4pgr2,1587508758.0,Same omg I‚Äôm really hoping that UCR takes a while to decide this!!!!
ucr,fo4omp1,t1_fo49q8r,1587508241.0,"They start in August though and we start October, summer for us in in August and online already so we will see"
ucr,fo3w75i,t3_g4wiyg,1587493976.0,Personally here: I was following the igetc and stats was A MUST to transfer. This shit stressed me out cause I failed it but UCR allowed me to take it during summer before transferring so deff talk to UCR and the transfer counselors there
ucr,fo3vr2l,t3_g5abm4,1587493762.0,Calling mtv cribs for you rn
ucr,fo1du53,t3_g4z500,1587431139.0,The thing is a lot of schools are talking about fall being online cause the majority of those start in August. We will have summer school still in August so technically we will be online too. But our actual fall quarter isn‚Äôt until like October? UCs have time to figure this shit out. I will be happy even if some classes are irl as that‚Äôll give me an excuse to go back to UCR too lol
ucr,fo1bdze,t3_g4z500,1587429638.0,They should have huge lectures online and discussions in person if it comes down to it
