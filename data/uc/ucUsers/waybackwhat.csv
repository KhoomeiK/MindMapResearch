UCDavis,fph23px,t3_gdatrs,1588613607.0,Contact the registrar. I think they are in charge of pass times and stuff.
UCDavis,fpf7zr2,t3_gd45yv,1588563999.0,"You'll be signing up for classes on Schedule Builder. Here is a [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh5YLi2802U) with more on the logistics. Orientation should get you more familiar with the process. You'll be given a pass time (4 hour registration window to register on this website) for the classes you want. You'll also be meeting with an advisor before you register for classes, so don't fret too much! But it is good, to have some knowledge before going into that.

According to this [website](https://orientation.ucdavis.edu/dates-and-deadlines), your pass time is in mid-July as you are a L&S student.

UCDavis,fp922le,t3_gc02vj,1588411320.0,"I have a friend that is an ETOX major. Here is their insight:

Duddeee just do ittttt. Etox major here. The etox program starts off like any other bio/chem major in terms of pre requisites. Upper divisions are where it's at. You have to take some core toxicology classes and labs which on focus on the principles of toxicology, chemical fate, and biological fate. It's such a small major with small labs and classes (smallest class was 4 students for me and largest was around 50) which is nice when attending such a large university. You also get to know faculty pretty well which has allowed my friends and I to secure some research positions. You also get to choose an emphasis which you can tailor to your interests. With the etox major and numerous emphases, you can go into programs focusing on pharmacy, environmental conservation, environmental law and regulation, forensics, etc. It seems like a specific major but it actually is quite broad. I'm obviously biased but I really do think I benefited from this major. The students and professors are pretty chill and you can learn a lot of different skills ranging from analytical chemistry to health risk assessments.



I personally did not take the ten unit marine class that is offered over the summer at Bodega Bay but my friends who did take that class loved it. You learn how to conduct your own research while living by the beach."

UCDavis,fp0a1o7,t3_gak6zq,1588205298.0,"At UC Davis, there is a psychology with a biological emphasis. So similar to UCSB's biopsych major in that respect. It depends on what you think is easy between psych and NPB material, but in general I think most find psych easier than NPB. I've taken both upper div psych and NPB classes and found psych easier. The psych with bio emphasis at Davis is one of the more popular majors to have as an pre-med undergrad.

I'm not too sure how to answer your second question so I'll leave that to another person. There are pre-med students here, yes, pre-health opportunities, yes, but I don't know how to compare that to UCSB by making a generalization.

If given the opportunity again, I would go to Davis. I am from a Bay Area suburb as well and found the transition suitable to my personality. I'm not too familiar with UCSB besides its stereotypes but felt that I would be out of place over there. I don't regret coming here."
UCDavis,fp0731z,t3_gak6a7,1588203712.0,"For SS1, last day to be added from wait list is June 26. For SS2, last day to be added from wait list is August 7. Go to the class as if you are officially enrolled as a student. If one of the above dates are closing in, ask about a PTA to the instructor. Some departments have strict PTA guidelines so be wary of that. If you are not in by June 26 or August 7, it looks like they'll refund you. If you are in before those deadlines, then you should automatically get an email from the Registrar indicating that you are now officially enrolled in that course.

If you are looking to just satisfy a requirement, I'd suggest looking for alternatives just in case. Maybe UWP 102 or UWP 104 if it works? Just registering for it and securing a spot is better than wait listing again. You do not have to pay summer session fees yet until mid June and mid July for SS1 and SS2, respectively.

UCDavis,fooridk,t1_fooqsri,1587944923.0,"I agree with you! If you are looking into just completing GEs I'd recommend CC. It would cost way cheaper and probs still be online. Or, take the summer off! See it as a graduation present :)"

Are you looking into the quantitative, biology or AB major of psych? That might help narrow in terms of curriculum of what you are looking for."
UCDavis,fooor0w,t3_g8o6lb,1587943275.0,Did you get any aid? What is your major? Some majors are impacted through TAG so you would not be able to go through that route. The cost difference with aid also is a deciding factor.

UCDavis,fo04zgm,t3_g4wzd8,1587406173.0,I don't think there is a max number of units? I think the limit is how much money you are willing to pay and how many classes you can fit in a summer session.

You cannot declare a minor until you satisfy all the requirements (with the exception of currently enrolled or already registered for the next quarter). CS classes are notoriously difficult to enroll in if you are not a CS major with no priority registration to register in Pass 1. You would be able to register in Pass 2 with other non-major CS. I would recommend talking to a CS advisor to discuss a plan once you are more settled in. In the meanwhile, I have some links for you to check out so you are more prepared.

So, you pay a one-time fee and it could last you theoretically until the last day of when are a student. I have it and I live off campus. Personally, I wouldn't say its worth it because not a lot of my friends want to revisit the DC since when they were freshmen.

UCDavis,fmk0mb6,t3_fv381q,1586141714.0,"I would say the reasons you listed for UW being better as not valid. Prestige is in the eye of the beholder. If you want something to happen, you can make it happen. For example, you mention that with a big city, there ""a lot of connections"". This is not necessarily true. You make those connections happen regardless of where you are at, its not really easier just because there's more people. School spirit imo shouldn't really impact your choice unless you really want to feel that sense of community. But then again, you mention that Davis has a good sense of community. UW does have a nice campus, but Davis is great contender for that. There is still a stellar study abroad opportunity here as well as for the overall UC system too.

Since the end goal is medical school, I would suggest Davis for its still quality education and lower cost. If you wanted to go to a medical school in Washington, I'd suggest go to UW because from my understanding, in-state students have a better chance at being admitted in Washington.

Based on your post, I'm assuming you did not get admitted to the honors program at Davis. If one of the bigger factors was the honors, you can still be admitted into the UC Davis Honors program during your winter quarter of your first year (caveat being that you still have to be ""high performing, high potential student"") after applying for it."
