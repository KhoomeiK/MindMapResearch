civic,fpl8nr4,t1_fpl49th,1588708317.0,Those are the standard touring wheels for civic sedans sold between 2016 and 2018!

assholedesign,fox710j,t1_fovs7uc,1588135661.0,Didn't know that. Thanks!
sandiego,fochncl,t1_focdu83,1587671431.0,"I'm not entirely sure if this is legal and if this is where OP saw it, but I managed to get a great view from the 101 Highway southbound, between Island way and Oceanview drive. Most people including myself did the same thing - parked their cars in the bike lane and turned their lights off. Since there is no beach access, this was the best way to get a good look. On Saturday night the view was spectacular."
soccer,fnkkdg4,t3_g2aed9,1587030389.0,Who's the lead commentator here? I really like his commentary but I've never been able to find out what he's called.
FUTMobile,fn9k4nq,t3_g09loc,1586776050.0,He did his best!
accord,fn9676t,t3_g0chos,1586760819.0,Gorgeous shot. Love those standard sport rims.
FUTMobile,fn5yeiw,t1_fn5k9nt,1586680363.0,"The saddest thing is that this was in an unranked H2H game. If it were ranked then I'd get it (don't condone, but I understand) but come on, it's unranked and straight from kickoff his Traore started running down the flank lol"
FUTMobile,fn5wt04,t1_fn5k7v1,1586678687.0,"Maybe not as good, but still effective when crosses fly in every time he has the ball. And of course that TT Zlatan doesn't make things easy either."
AskReddit,fmrrq7s,t3_fwxzq4,1586333057.0,"Expected to see Danny Devito as the top comment, disappointed in this sub."
ConvenientCop,flwefeh,t3_frl0hn,1585547820.0,Is it just me or is that song terrible? Lol
