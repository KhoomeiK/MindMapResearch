Wizard101,fpfszhk,t1_fpfpk8w,1588582363.0,"omg i’m so sorry that you had that experience. that’s terrible. in dungeons like darkmoor, even if you have wiki pulled up, it’s easy to mess up if it’s your first time and you’re just trying to keep up with the different cheats and everything. when i’m dungeoning with people, i always make sure that everybody knows the cheats, and if they mess up and it’s their first time, it’s really not that big of a deal in the grand scheme of things. some players just need to chill."
Wizard101,fpfoylp,t1_fpf5tz9,1588578298.0,"for me, my worst experiences with storms has always been in darkmoor and while farming the rat in polaris. today, i was in a team-up for the rat with two storms, and they got mad at me and a life because we weren’t spamming the minions every single round. we’re life and death??? our aoes require either a shadow or a whole seven pips? smh. i really really can’t stand storms sometimes. i don’t mind their ego if they can back it up, but sometimes they make me so frustrated. like why can’t the weaker of the storms spam? they loved using tempest before but no. if they’re storm they must automatically be the main hitter and spamming is left to somebody else."
Wizard101,fpfn7o2,t1_fpegjxg,1588576595.0,"when would death be considered useless? i’m a level 117 death now, and i feel like death is just getting more and more fun, so i’m curious as to when i’m going to become useless lol. everything has been amazing after lulu. i can either hit, heal, support, or juju depending on circumstances, and i feel like death is pretty useful for its versatility."
UCI,fpfhcdp,t3_gd56dq,1588571266.0,i’m taking 1/4 of my classes p/np
UCI,fp6uojl,t3_gbao6z,1588358897.0,this is the best thing that i’ve read on reddit all week 😂😂 big mood.
UCI,fp370f5,t3_gadmnb,1588274192.0,I’ve literally never felt more stupid in my life than during this quarter.
UCI,fotcjgk,t1_foszifr,1588050069.0,"hell nah. those people are so fuckin selfish. seeing all those protests pisses the hell out of me. ya, i’m going insane, but i refuse to contribute to that kind of idiocy. if everyone just did what we were supposed to do instead of being so self-centered, this might not have gotten so out of hand in the first place. hell, the only reasons why i can hear my neighbors so clearly is because they’re letting their kid run outside all over the place and none of them are even social distancing.
tldr; i’m staying home, even if i’m going insane, i’m not going to be dumb about it."
UCI,fotca8p,t1_fot0jb0,1588049872.0,I don’t live in the best neighborhood. Walking outside has all of the noise levels without the little bit of safety that staying inside has.
UCI,foiy0lq,t1_foiv2bw,1587800925.0,"Me with Ferguson tbh. I’m dying, but I can appreciate the structure and organization of the class. The topic is also super interesting. I’ve just been a terrible student due to current circumstances. Wish it was a little easier, but it’s a good class."
UCI,foixvz7,t1_foivzvz,1587800789.0,"omg that’s so nice of her!! i’m so glad that she let you do that. idk her, but also adding my thanks to professor levine for helping a fellow anteater"
entj,foiu5qw,t3_g74ug3,1587797109.0,"Not sure, but in high school, I used to “ditch” classes that I thought were useless (study hall, classes where the teacher was too lazy to teach, etc.) to do something more productive with my time. I say “ditching” because I was technically following the rules for missing school. Adcom didn’t like it though, and they used to have meetings on how to get me to stop missing classes (it was a really small school), but in the end, they couldn’t do anything because I was technically following the rules. 🤷🏻‍♀️ So I had a reputation for being somewhat of a “delinquent” with “issues with authorities”, but also a model student because teachers liked me, I was captain/president for a couple of extracurriculars, and I got straight A’s. I always got what I needed to get done, done though. I still don’t understand why they were so nitpicky about it, especially since it wasn’t my fault that my time was being wasted in the first place."
UCI,foirntw,t3_g7msvg,1587794821.0,"This is so pure and wholesome 🥺 some of my TAs and Professors have been really great this quarter, and I want to thank them so much for being understanding. It’s a stressful time for everyone, but they’ve been great in terms of communication and workload. So so so grateful for them."
UCI,fode83a,t3_g6wtka,1587683585.0,"I totally feel. Before this quarter, I had a really good GPA, but now, I have no clue what I’m even doing anymore. I’m still trying to study, but nothing is clicking. I’m also missing little details, and it’s screwing me over. My mind’s just all over the place, and even when I’m concentrating, I can’t truly concentrate. I’m privileged enough that for the time being, my family’s financial situation is relatively stable. So it’s even worse because I feel like I’m just making excuses for why I’m not doing well. My mental health is going down the drain though, and it doesn’t help that some professors are still assigning so much work and exams."
UCI,fo7jxny,t1_fo7jl8k,1587579605.0,"you’re so sweet omg. you literally made my day! lmk if you ever wanna study together for that class or something. but also same! i had everything from the lectures written down. everything. some of the questions just threw me off because there was contradicting information and i didn’t know which one to rely on to answer the questions. but ya, hopefully the next midterm will be better :) good luck to you too with this class!"
UCI,fo7hvf0,t1_fo7hq3t,1587578601.0,ya it was. :( which sucks because i actually really liked the lectures and the topic itself. i just struggled a lot on the midterm
UCI,fo16eth,t1_fo13v5j,1587426692.0,ya it was just no electronics
UCI,fo13q9w,t1_fo0y8qv,1587425134.0,ya mine was respondus+webcam 😔
UCI,fo0u50z,t1_fo0ttwo,1587419806.0,"thanks for the advice! apparently this professor doesn’t curve, but at least there’s still p/np. i’m just gonna try my best until the situation grows dire"
UCI,fo0p7yq,t3_g4g1ma,1587417216.0,"I had a lot of AP credits, and now that I’m almost done with my freshmen year, i’m done with all but like two of my GE categories. I know people say that the honors program helps with GEs, but I turned it down, and I’m chilling. Up to you if the honors program is worth it though."
UCI,flzx3vy,t1_flxufyi,1585636440.0,ooh okay. thank you for telling me! i’ll definitely take your advice into consideration
