ucla,fnyc8fj,t3_g4l2xm,1587358907.0,"Econ is nice. You get a qualitative understanding of how markets work in a theoretical level, and the quantitative math to back it up. Personally, I feel like the mixture of the two makes a nice blend of the curriculum.

Is it hard? Hard is relative. If you do not have a good math foundation, then yeah it will be hard. Are you good at math (I think nothing beyond Calc BC level, only partial derivatives usually at most for most classes). If you are, then it will be pretty easy.

The interesting thing about UCLA Econ is that you can do a different mix of classes--there's the easy way out (more fluff classes) or the hard way out (rigorous data analysis) classes. You'll know by name. 

I would say it takes effort for the pre-reqs, then it becomes easier once you make it after the ""pre-major"".

Opportunities basically whatever you want in business (I'm planning to work in financial services), but my friends are in banking/consulting/marketing/wanting to get master/PhD."
