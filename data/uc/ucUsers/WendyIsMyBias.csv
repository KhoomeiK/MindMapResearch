amazon,folxw1c,t3_g4qu02,1587873132.0,"I ordered a non-essential item from Amazon Germany over a week and a half ago, and I still haven't gotten an update yet.  How long will it be until it ships? It's not like Amazon US where you get an estimated delivery date, even a month long.

dvdcollection,fnfi71c,t1_fnc3l9x,1586908527.0,"Primarily because he made two movies that I absolutely love in my two favorite franchises; remaining faithful to Godzilla / Star Wars but still making his movies memorable. Basically I love his movies. I really hope to see more of his writing in the future.

Other directors whose work I really love include Guillermo Del Toro, Ari Aster, and recently Bong Joon-ho."
OverwatchTMZ,fnfg6op,t1_fnfeqzi,1586907432.0,"yeah but not entirely. Valorant will probably popular since it's free on the Riot client and easily playable on most PCs. Idk how much of the playerbase will be as casual though, only being on PC. OW was ported to consoles for casual players while Valorant is not at this point"
