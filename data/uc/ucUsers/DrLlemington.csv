relationship_advice,fpirios,t1_fpir9o2,1588647098.0,I see. People do use this place to vent. I think she does want help but it's probably a conflicted message. I wonder what advice she would listen to though.
relationship_advice,fpiecgu,t1_fpi3oaf,1588639166.0,Why would regular old r/iamverybadass not imply women too? You could have just made your comment and not been sexist about it too.
relationship_advice,fpie4mm,t1_fpibrox,1588639035.0,"It's the sad tale of the person in an abusive relationship knowing that what's going on is wrong, wanting advice, but being crushingly afraid of being alone. Because unfortunately the one second of love apparently makes up for 24 hours of abuse. It's the psychology of fear and ultimately not being able to love yourself enough. (Hence needing someone, anyone, to provide a modicum of love to you)"

Healthyhooha,fpc7dav,t3_gcigpm,1588490099.0,Same here. I personally think modern women's underwear wasn't designed with this in mind. Don't be hard on yourself and just be hard on your underwear. I buy cotton panties and change them twice a day if I can. Yeah they get soaked but I think that's just natural. I'll go commando if I want things to dry out a bit more.

Conservative,fp25xav,t3_gal1so,1588255798.0,"Admittedly, Trump only really said ""maybe there's a way to get a disinfectant inside the body through some sort of injection"". Yet that right there is dangerous coming out of someone who has influence over people, and especially as the president. That's why he needs to listen to the experts and listen to people that tell him ""this is how you say things to the public that way they don't try anything stupid"".

 I don't agree with people saying that Trump literally said to drink bleach, but Trump needs to watch his words as president. Because when you're talking to an audience of millions of scared people, any potential treatment you suggest, many will try. Remember when people were drinking isopropyl alcohol to curb Coronavirus? Yes, I think protecting the stupid is important in this country, that's why public health announcements have to be safe. Trump is just the blind leading the blind here. Speaking his mind here isn't helpful because he has no medical background. And if he did, any speculations or questions he had should be said to a team of researchers, not the American public."
Healthyhooha,fp1glrz,t3_gardz1,1588234834.0,"If you've been laying around in the house like me all day because of quarantine, usually that will lend to more chances for the pad to fold up in there. I'd suggest maybe changing more often, or using another pad to extend the length so if it does scrunch up you still might still have some protection."
rupaulsdragrace,foxb0xc,t1_foxa7wd,1588138706.0,"It's probably not the best idea to compare struggles, which is why both fat people and gay people have their own reasons for being judged in society, but they can often be compared or overlap, hence the intersectionality. 

Sure, some fat people can lose weight, but why does that give anyone the right to judge them for not doing so, that was the original point. I was just making a point that those who are part of a community that has been judged are judging others, and how hypocritical that is. When we should be spreading body positivity, acceptance in yourself, and self love whatever that means to a person. Ultimately it is not about looking at someone biologically and trying to determine what's ""best"" for them, it's understanding how they feel and trying to make a world that helps them as they are."

However I don't shower everday and I'm overweight so that could contribute too. Idk, being a vagina owner is hard especially in a world where oral is held as this ""have to do"" thing for sex. I sometimes wish we still lived in the times where a smelly vagina would be the least of one's smell concerns, aka before deodorant, perfume, showering and regular hygiene became common (however I thank it for reducing deaths by illnesses by like 500%). I think as a society we've become more olfactory sensitive, even to natural smells."

pics,fnngsd7,t1_fnn5bm9,1587092021.0,"Femininity shouldn't equal submissiveness, but if you look at the Victorian paintings of women, you'll see their childish faces, with doe eyes that all seem to be unintimidating poses in positions that would be considered proper for women. While nothing is necessarily wrong with depicting femininity in this way in a bubble, the pervasiveness and the replication of that image of women happens so much in society that it makes femininity equal that submissive, and ultimately powerless position. It puts pressure on women to look up to this model of femininity because it is the most common one, even throughout childhood especially. And thus it subconsciously works it's way into everyone's minds that women should seek positions of submissiveness and powerlessness if they want to be beautiful. 

It's hard to criticize art like this because every artist works with their own subconscious biases and reasons for making art, what if this artist just wanted to make a portrait of something they found beautiful? Well, then they did their part of announcing what they found beautiful and depicting it, and maybe it's appropriate to look at how these depictions reflect society, and how society is impacted by these depictions in a sort of self-feeding way. Especially when it's so common and repeated, it's important to look at these patterns because repeated images can have an effect on human brains who like patterns and latch onto repetition."
pics,fnms8lj,t3_g2kjhb,1587077167.0,"Even though this is really good this trend reminds me of the doll faces that Victorian women were painted with, to symbolize femininity and submissiveness, and that was the only popular art form depicting women. Can't more popular posts depict women with the aura of strength, with ingenuity, with heart? I know it's nice to look at a pretty face, but art is extremely influential on our idea of beauty and society."

Fitness,fndd726,t1_fnct2cq,1586866983.0,Apparently for me my target heart rate makes me feel like I'm going to die. So I'll slow it down for now until I work up to it.
Fitness,fndd1ui,t3_g0ysgy,1586866868.0,"I'm in the same boat as you. What I find works is not starting out running totally, I jog lightly for a few minutes, then I power walk or just walk for a few minutes. Then I repeat for 30 minutes. Anything to help my heart rate to not feel like I'm going to die, but still keep a nice workout. 

Whatever you do you shouldn't feel like you're in intense pain, even if from the outside it looks like you're doing very little. Ask yourself, if your heart pumping and do you feel tired doing this activity? Great, then ask yourself, am I at a level of discomfort that makes me emotionally and physically drained and/or would discourage me from doing this again? Then lighten what you're doing.

Listen to your body, not anyone else's ideas of how many miles you should run, what your heart rate should be at, because ultimately we want to make something sustainable and that will gradually bring your body up."

I went to the ""Cancel Order"" section under the help button, but there was an option to basically have a full refund in doordash credits. So I accepted it and it sent me back to the help options screen. A few minutes later I clicked on the cancel order section again, and clicked on the credits thing again out of indecisiveness. Cue redoing this in boredom for a while as the email hadn't hit yet, I thought it wasn't registering.

I go check my doordash credits to see if went through, and bam, I'm greeted with this. Every click was a separate transaction. 

So I'm freaking out a bit. I don't want ddash to sue me, especially during this time I'm afraid I'm taking money away from people."

Failed a couple due to some mental health struggles which has lowered my confidence significantly. Every time I tell people that they say I shouldn't try to be an engineer, and I agree with them until I get back to hands on stuff where I feel real joy.
