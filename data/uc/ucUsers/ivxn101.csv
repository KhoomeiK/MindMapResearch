ucr,fpljmmw,t1_fplg9hv,1588713891.0,Second that I messed up registering for the last session and I got some weird classes at some shitty times lmao
ucr,fpldktg,t3_ge4ehx,1588710802.0,"It really depends on your worth ethic. If you are always doing homework, studying and are not easily distracted then more power to you and try it out. There's technically 6 classes that go with this, because each class has a lab and even thought they aren't too hard it's time consuming.

I personally never did a triple threat because I am the type of person who needs a complete day off where I don't do any homework and just be lazy and relax so I'm not always in school mode lol. If you're deciding which one to hold off on I'd say physics cause being that you're a chemistry emphasis, it would be more important to finish organic chemistry so you can start working too on the chemistry upper divisions, but just double check the pre-reqs for those classes and see which ones are most common."
ucr,fp4q48b,t3_gbapwt,1588304648.0,"Yeah park on Watkins thatâ€™s where most freshman and others who dorm park their cars for free. 
But it is street parking and sometimes there are reports of cars being broken into so take that with what you will . 

Also canyon crest drive, that street and some other surrounding areas have street parking for free but these streets are a fair walk from the freshman dorms."
ucr,fp4oc53,t1_fp4nuh6,1588303479.0,"Ahh ok then youâ€™re in good shape. But just a heads up, check what medical schools take AP credit for calculus because some schools wonâ€™t take AP credit so youâ€™ll need to take the classes then. Even if you do end up having to take calculus classes here at UCR youâ€™re chillin being that youâ€™re taking calc rn and should be easy for you."
ucr,fp4anib,t3_gb3mzr,1588295046.0,"Hell yeah appeal that decision. You sound like you're a competitive applicant and if you really want to go to UCLA then keep fighting. Just prepare a good case as to what makes you a good applicant and state all your experience/volunteer work. I'm not a transfer so idk what tag is or how it would benefit you as a transfer, but definitely appeal that decision, looks like you put in the work to earn a spot. 

Best of luck!!"
ucr,fp4a4zp,t3_gb7h29,1588294746.0,"I'm not a psych major but from what other Psych majors have said is that it really isn't all that hard to get the science classes needed for the pre-med path. Usually a lot of them divide the four main series (BIO CHEM PHYS and OCHEM) across all four years so that they only have to worry about one or two stem classes in a quarter and allows them to perform better. 

There are certain sections that are reserved for stem students, but generally these classes are large and have multiple sections (i.e like fall quarter will probably have 3 or 4 lectures of CHEM 1A), so you should be able to secure a spot.

Just make sure you take the math placement test asap so that you can get placed into a math class and then plan the next four years out from there, based on what your placed."
ucr,foz75pe,t3_gaeofv,1588185811.0,"Chegg has solutions for each chapter and I believe their subscription is free for the semester/ quarter cause of the virus. Just search up the book on chegg and it should say ""veiw textbook solutions""."
ucr,fovxll6,t3_g9qle3,1588109302.0,"Yeah try switching your major online, worst thing is theyâ€™ll deny you but you can always take the pre req classes for psych and then transfer in later on freshman year so youâ€™re good"
ucr,fosx323,t1_fosulfn,1588039855.0,"Usually life science majors in CNAS take the same classes their freshman year, which is like CHEM 1A/1B/1C and BIO 5A/5B  and usually reach math 7A or 7B by spring quarter. 

For CS all I know is that they take MATH 9A/9B/9C and CS 10/12 (depending on if they AP credit for CS). 

Most freshman also take ENGL 1A and ENGL 1B their freshman years and maybe like a couple of breath classes."
ucr,fosnixl,t1_fosmgwt,1588034231.0,"Yeah regardless if youâ€™re gonna be in CNAS or BCOE youâ€™ll be taking math classes and that requires you take the test to get placed into a  math class. If you take AP calc ab though and get a 3 I believe you go straight into 9B/7B , but if not no worries you can do the math 6a and 6b then 7A route if you get placed into 6a. 
Idk about the cs010 being replaced by AP credit Iâ€™m not a CS major lol"
ucr,fositv2,t3_g9bdoj,1588031551.0,As the post above said it does require those classes and the most one you'd probably struggling getting enrolled into is CS 010 as thats the first class CS majors take and they reserve seats for that class specifically for CS majors.  But this major change is very doable so long as you can finish those four classes your freshman year
ucr,foo4ksu,t3_g8l5g6,1587932378.0,"It depends on the classes youâ€™re signed up for. Taking stem over summer is more time consuming but theyâ€™re manageable if youâ€™re good at time management and staying on top of your shit. If theyâ€™re breath classes then give it a shot for the first week and if you see if it works for you if not then drop some classes. I think you have until middle of the second week of summer school to drop a class without a W on your transcript, but donâ€™t quote me on that.  

Also see how youâ€™re doing this quarter online, if youâ€™re good with this online stuff then go for it. But many others arenâ€™t and itâ€™s completely normal cause learning on a screen is way more different than being in class, and I found myself struggling too so just take that into factor.

For financial aid, I donâ€™t think adding a class if you added it right now matters too much cause when they do the financial aid awards they look at what classes (unit wise) youâ€™re enrolled in so theyâ€™ll see itâ€™s more than what you said for on the application so theyâ€™ll adjust it to show how much units youâ€™re registered in. Donâ€™t quote me on that tho thatâ€™s just what happened to me last summer when I added a class late, but do research and ask financial aid to be sure.

Hope this helps!"
ucr,foiyiii,t3_g7ledm,1587801450.0,"They havenâ€™t officially said it will be just spring and summer quarter are online , but Iâ€™m sure theyâ€™d let us know as the next couple of months happen.

Canâ€™t comment much about the housing but if youâ€™re looking for saving some money then do off campus housing, just a matter of research to see which apartments/ rooms for rent fit your needs.

For the lower division chemistry classes a lot of professors also teach upper division classes, but from a lower division standing the professors are alright nothing special. I think youâ€™re good though cause upper division chemistry classes will be way much less students than a general or organic chemistry class that most science majors take , so youâ€™ll have a better chance/experience of interacting with your professors. & I seen a professor give out extra credit for his chemistry class for making tik toks about chemical properties which is dope ahaha so thereâ€™s that. 
Goodluck!"
ucr,fohuux3,t3_g7fhca,1587773085.0,Sycamore canyon is a open trail thatâ€™s less than 10 minutes by car from school.  Has hiking trails and is fairly big
ucr,fodid9n,t3_g6xfz2,1587685061.0,Yes I believe you can but just make sure your advisors approves it . If they havenâ€™t gotten back to you then email her and just CC the next supervisor above and theyâ€™ll email back lmao
ucr,fo9tet8,t3_g6gi7k,1587630517.0,"For PSYCH majors, you only need one quarter of MATH because you have to take statistics for psych majors which has pre-req of a math(MATH 4/5/6A) class, but I think if you pass the AB exam you should be exempt from taking those math classes here and just have to focus on stats required for psych majors."
ucr,fo5wgg2,t3_g5mmvt,1587537946.0,"FUCK ADVISORS AT UCR. Especially the undeclared ones in CNAS. I swear they donâ€™t want any student to succeed. I wasnâ€™t eligible to declare a major until my second year and I swear all hell broke loose w them. Constant nagging to be in a major since Iâ€™m a sophomore and the constant putting down that maybe CNAS isnâ€™t for me when I never failed a class. Like fuck you guys I hated going to them , only went when theyâ€™d put holds on my account.
My new advisor in CMDB IS THE SHIT THOO she fr the homie ðŸ˜ŽðŸ˜Ž"
ucr,fnqsskj,t1_fnqqlu0,1587171449.0,"Second that. Class is not bad, no book, and is curved. Drops a low midterm score too. Definitely take him not bad at all."
ucr,fng0o56,t3_g1g4cw,1586919589.0,"Yeah you have to be concurrently enrolled in both courses.

Usually as the spring quarter moves along some people will drop their summer class because they didn't get past 8B or change their mind about summer school, so some seats should open up."

ucr,fn915nd,t3_g08zkq,1586756059.0,"Yeah you can submit a major change form I believe even during week 10 and then once your final grades get posted your advisor will approve the major change and youâ€™ll be in your new major.

Donâ€™t wait until fall quarter because the more you wait the more pre requisite classes you need to take to get accepted into the major and itâ€™s just easier to switch when you have lower amount of units ."

ucr,fmyahv5,t3_fy45uj,1586481677.0,"Contact our CNAS (College of Natural and Agriculture Sciences) enrollment people as they too can help clear and get students enrolled into classes. I had the same issue a couple of quarters ago .
Hereâ€™s the link : 
https://cnasemc.ucr.edu

They might ask you to fill out a form that they have us students here fill out, that allows us to do stuff like register for two classes over summer or for classes and or retake classes if we failed them. But since youâ€™re from UCSC I donâ€™t know howâ€™d they handle it but there is another way other than the academic advisors ."
ucr,fmxzlkp,t3_fy269l,1586475028.0,"I had him as a TA for 5A and he was a good lecturer going over the material but he was a dick when it came to grading. He gave us pop quizzes on the reading from the textbook and you had to read read in order to get good scores on the quizes. I'd imagine that since summer is online you'll have an easier time with the quizzes so it's nothing to sweat about, but he did explain things good imo."
ucr,fmugxbb,t1_fmudmhm,1586391190.0,"I think like early June I got how much I would be receiving and then I accepted it. Usually you get your statement for summer in the last weeks of spring quarter if Iâ€™m not wrong .

I took summer school last year and thats what happened to me."

ucr,fmmw89i,t3_fw5l4o,1586213272.0,1B for me was the hardest because of all the equations and you have to know what do do with each one. Plus I had David Hill lmao so that didnâ€™t help but for sure 1B was the hardest for me. 1C was better because of the professor and it was 1/2 the math like in 1B. 1A obv the easiest lmao
ucr,fmkilcb,t3_fvtpgi,1586156194.0,"I didnâ€™t take calc in hs but even here at UCR it wasnt as bad as I expected. 
I took 7A/7B but going to the ARC helped a lot. The tutors there are really helpful and even if itâ€™s a dumb question theyâ€™re there to help. They still offer online appointments this quarter.

Khan academy helps but they use simple examples but are good for introducing you to the concept.

Organic chemistry tutor is good and goes in depth on his examples. He uses harder examples too and can be used for practice. 

9A Iâ€™m guessing is similar to 7A so itâ€™s just derivatives, limits and applications of derivatives so itâ€™s not too hard."
