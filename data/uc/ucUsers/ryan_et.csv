(Might need to fact check this, but I recently saw that some medical schools will accept a P but it will count as a C letter grade, which isn't that worth it if you KNOW you are able to do well in the class)

Also, keep in mind to do your research into different medical schools because some will accept AP credits for their requirements as long as it is labeled on your transcripts."
