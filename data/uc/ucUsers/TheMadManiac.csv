changemyview,fpmrxe4,t1_fpmr4jg,1588740121.0,I guess. My main problem with your stance is that religious people have literally forced thousands of people into converting to their religion. Most religious people are indoctrinated with religion as children. Religion only survives if you can keep people believing in it. Atheism doesn't need to be taught
changemyview,fpmrjxc,t1_fpmqyvn,1588739851.0,Shouldn't the side that is claiming something exists  be the one providing the proof? You don't believe that Zeus is real even though there is no evidence that he isn't
changemyview,fpmr6hu,t1_fpmkqc3,1588739584.0,"I get where you are coming from, but it shouldn't be other people's responsibility to convince of a certain belief. I was raised catholic, no one talked me out of it I just thought more about what I was taught in catholic school and saw that it didn't fit my worldview. If people want to believe in god then that is their choice, I'm not trying to convert people to my side"
changemyview,fpmqjck,t1_fpmpyih,1588739120.0,Yeah but religious people literally go door to door trying to preach to as many people as they can.
changemyview,fpmpoiz,t1_fpmobre,1588738511.0,I can't tell if you are joking
changemyview,fpmov3e,t1_fpmm8vw,1588737941.0,My thoughts on certain proofs of a religion is that they aren't real or can be explained without supernatural cause. I don't think the math test analogy works though because the atheist would just say that the math test is gibberish and doesn't make sense. The fact that people could take the same test and recieve totally different answers adds to that sentiment. It isn't like there is 1 key or anything.
changemyview,fpmnqx2,t1_fpmmgk0,1588737193.0,Lol atheism isn't a religion
changemyview,fpm4va6,t1_fpm3gag,1588725603.0,It has worked for me and let's me have conversations with religious people without them getting defensive. But I do agree  that some of the stuff in the Bible is just history. I'm talking about the mystical magic stuff
changemyview,fpm4j6j,t1_fpl2y5s,1588725407.0,"No. People base their vote on a lot of stuff I don't agree with, that's their choice. I know a guy who voted for trump because he was the only man running.i think there are more dangerous things to base politics on than religion."
changemyview,fpm36zn,t1_fpm32rs,1588724630.0,I agree. That's why I just ignore religion and carry on like normal
changemyview,fpm33ig,t1_fpm1ifa,1588724573.0,It's not like I don't try to learn more about a person's religion or their view point. I don't think it is worth trying to argue about the specifics of their religion. I think there are more interesting things to talk about that doesn't risk offending people or cause the same repetitive conversation.
changemyview,fpm2ljb,t1_fpm23rn,1588724284.0,"Most people don't debate as well as professionals do though, so it's pretty rare that the average person  can make an argument so profound that it changes a person's religion"
changemyview,fpm2cne,t1_fpm1p3j,1588724140.0,"I'm down with talking about ways of thinking or philosophical questions, I just don't feel the need to be specific"
changemyview,fpm1v6h,t1_fpl3kxm,1588723857.0,"I disagree, people aren't logical and religious views don't translate well to other views. Knowing what specific religion people are doesn't matter to me, I've had plenty of conversations about philosophical questions without mentioning a specific religion. You can learn plenty about a person without critizing their religion."
changemyview,fpm0met,t1_fplzcpc,1588723138.0,"I disagree with this view. I think religion had a very important role in human technology innovation and evolution, and it definitely shaped our history. I think there is a place for discussion of common religious themes and ideas, I just don't think it's worth the effort talking about any specific religion and its moral rules. People get too offended if you critize this and you lose out on the rest of the conversation."
changemyview,fpm07yz,t1_fplzjzs,1588722909.0,"I am open to discussing the philosophical questions but I just don't believe in any of the lore parts of religion. To me it is the same as any other mythological story, I can talk about the lessons you learn from the story but in the end I don't think it is real or actually happened. A lot of people will be offended if you critize their religion so I pretend like it's not a thing and ignore it. I don't think you gain much trying to imagine what it would be like if there religion was actually real."
changemyview,fplziyp,t1_fplz0fu,1588722513.0,"I don't have the intention to change anyone's mind. I don't think people will change their mine, so I'm saying why bother discussing religion. Just pretend it isn't a thing and conversations go a lot smoother. You can still talk about cool shit and you don't have to worry about hurting someone's feelings by critizing their specific religion."

changemyview,fpkul71,t1_fpku4xg,1588701298.0,Okay but you're taking about learning from religion as a whole. Like the history and influence it had over the years. I'm talking about the perspective of one person who was taught something as a kid and just stook with it.
changemyview,fpku9ai,t1_fpktv8o,1588701134.0,What is the logical fallacy of not believing in a religion?
changemyview,fpktaux,t1_fpksod6,1588700665.0,But is that just because the majority of people are religious. Because there are a lot of stupid atheists on the internet lol
changemyview,fpkt304,t1_fpkmqxd,1588700557.0,"It's not like he just chooses to ignore data, he reads scientific literature and looks at models about the issues and forms his opinion. He works as an environmental scientist and talks with a lot of people in the field. His opinion is valid and he makes good points (mostly about the economic impact some proposed measures would have) he just won't let the subject go."
changemyview,fpksbm4,t1_fpknlov,1588700180.0,"You still need evidence to support your opinion if you want anything to actually happen. The government isn't just choosing what to do in response to coronavirus based on a subjective opinion, they are (hopefully) looking at the data and models to determine the best course of action. Money isn't just randomly appropriated to whatever project based on opinion, they form models and projections to predict how much a program needs. There are certainly facts when it comes to climate change or drug laws or Healthcare or gun rights. Opinion is definitely a factor but it isn't nearly as subjective as religion is. Isn't justice only based on facts? Like that's the whole purpose of a trial and jury. The rules for society are not just subjectively made, the people are asked what they want (or who they want to make decisions) and then an election is held where the majority decision wins. I am mostly libertarian I guess, but it depends a lot on the topic"
changemyview,fpkpkv7,t1_fpkoggz,1588698823.0,"I am willing to accept criticism, I just don't believe in a religion. I'm open minded but some stuff I just don't believe."
changemyview,fpkpe0t,t1_fpknvke,1588698728.0,Problem I see is that a lot of the greatest leaders and especially scientists have been religious. The head of the human genome project is a Christian (I was at a dinner thing with him and he said grace and did the cross thing)
changemyview,fpko1hh,t1_fpkil7t,1588698063.0,Lol I'm not trying to convince anyone that they are wrong. I am talking about atheists who want to tell everybody they are wrong
changemyview,fpknvic,t1_fpkm2jc,1588697981.0,"I think you misunderstood me, I don't want to have to pretend that all the mythical Bible stuff is real like I pretend that Santa Claus is real for kids. I have nothing against Christmas. I just think that the stories in the bible were made up and don't feel like pretending just to have a conversation. I don't think Jesus actually rose from the dead or that some dude got swallowed by a whale and survived, they sound like fairy tales. I am accepting of broader beliefs but the lore stuff is a bit too much for me."
changemyview,fpkn42o,t1_fpkb1oz,1588697603.0,"This is the stuff I don't believe in, the rules you have for what God likes or doesn't like. You never met the dude! It's not like he is human and has a sex right? Why would he care if people are gay?"
changemyview,fpkm0y7,t1_fpklcai,1588697069.0,"Not really with religion. Philosophy is pretty easy to pretend, but it's kinda hard to pretend that all the shit in the Bible actually happened when a lot of it doesn't make sense or is kinda messed up. I can talk about if there is life after death or how we can think but I don't like talking about religions."
changemyview,fpkl1oa,t1_fpkkr0i,1588696585.0,"I think so because the risk of offending people is a lot lower with other topics.  Religion is a core part of a lot of people's identities, including yours!"
changemyview,fpkkqmn,t1_fpkinzp,1588696426.0,Do you ever think you got the wrong religion?
changemyview,fpkjo4v,t1_fpkj3c6,1588695886.0,I have a similar story. I remember asking my teacher why there were other religions in the world if theres is only one god. She said because they were sinners with false gods who couldn't make it to heaven unless the believed in our god. That didn't make sense to me then and led to my lack of belief now
changemyview,fpkj8pv,t1_fpkiumg,1588695672.0,"Those people are just fine with the risk, you just have different priorities."

changemyview,fpkiezv,t1_fpkhxzx,1588695255.0,"That's my point, I don't argue with them. However it is super common for atheists to feel the need to debunk religion and critize beliefs just so they can feel superior. It's not worth it and people should let it go."

changemyview,fpkhf4b,t1_fpkgu3z,1588694747.0,I think you can have an interesting conversation about those topics without religion. If anything religion just decreases the amount of diverse perspectives on the topics.
changemyview,fpkgtfl,t1_fpkc727,1588694429.0,Yes. Most people are good. If believing in a religion makes them act good then I don't give a shit.

changemyview,fpkf2iz,t1_fpkefdd,1588693516.0,But you can measure when a religion started right? Like isn't it weird that there was 13 billion years of no religion and then all of a sudden it just appeared in tbe last couple thousand year? That's why I think people just msde it up.

changemyview,fpkdkn0,t1_fpkbnlh,1588692734.0,"I would be a very boring person to debate religion. I just don't think religion makes sense. When I was a kid I was raised catholic (went to catholic school, mother was catholic, been baptized, did first communion and confirmation) One day we drove by a sikh temple and I learned that there were other religions. It didn't make sense because we were taught that there was only 1 God and he had very strict rules. I didn't know people believed in different things, and it's not like a god couldn't just teach everyone the same thing. Since then I haven't believed in any religion because if one is wrong then why couldn't another be wrong? Learning that some religions developed from others (like Christianity did) made me just see religion as traditions people did but not something that was real. I don't think anything happens after you die, I have seen people and animals die (don't be mad I work in a university bio lab) and it is not a mystical thing. I don't think you are punished or rewarded for things no one knows about. I think people made up religions to explain stuff and as we learned more we had to change the religion so it would explain things we don't know. Nowadays we still don't know how universe was created or if there is an afterlife so we invented an answer to these questions. I don't think we will ever know the real answers so if people want to find comfort in religion then that's their choice."
changemyview,fpkbdcy,t1_fpka8qp,1588691572.0,That's not my opinion at all. I am open that I don't believe in religion but it's not like I shut down any conversation about religion. I just don't think people should be wasting their time trying to debunk it or convincing people they are wrong. I like talking to people who are trying to convert me because it's a lot easier to talk about stuff without offending them since the focus is own my beliefs not theirs

changemyview,fpka5yo,t1_fpk6ndb,1588690921.0,Don't most religions hate sin? Like people who sin in Christianity go to hell for eternity. That sounds hateful to want someone to suffer until time ends because they did something bad.

changemyview,fpk8i5i,t1_fpk7wr3,1588690029.0,I agree. That's why I try to ignore it. I think its a bit mean to pretend like you believe in their religion just to have an entertaining conversation.

changemyview,fpk68fr,t1_fpk5mta,1588688789.0,I think religion is a bit different because you can't base it on any fact or evidence. At least with the other topics both parties can (hopefully) agree on what the facts are. But yes that is a pretty good way of sumerizing it
