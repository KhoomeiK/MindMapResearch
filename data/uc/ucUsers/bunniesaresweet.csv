After adjusting for inflation and purchasing power, the median wage has been stagnated for the last 20 years, and has actually decreased since 50 years ago. Meanwhile the top 1% of earners keep earning more and more"
AskTrumpSupporters,fosub6t,t1_for71g3,1588038201.0,How about billion dollar corporations? Do you think it’s fair these companies pay less taxes (by less I mean zero) than a minimum wage worker?
ApplyingToCollege,fntito2,t3_fmtazh,1587242520.0,"A little late but I'm a med student who was in your exact position my senior year of hs so I can offer some advice. FYI I chose ucsb so I might be a little bias lol 

If money isn't a factor and med school is your goal, what matters most is going to the school you'll have the highest gpa and mcat. Ucsb, Ucsd and Uc davis have similar curves for their premed prerecs (usually C+/B- is average, and top 20% of class get As). To perform well, you want to be in an environment where you're happy, but not distracted.

Research and volunteering (clinical & nonclinical) are also important. Some people will say that you should go to uc davis or ucsd because they have med schools (and thus better opportunities) but I disagree. There's clinical volunteering everywhere. Close to ucsb, there's a hospital and a group of free clinics people volunteer at. I actually volunteered as a medical assistant at one of these clinics my last two years. For research, med schools don't really care what type of research you do (medical vs bio, chem, psych, etc). They just want you to have the research skills and experience. 

Ucsd campus and location is beautiful but their stereotype is UC Socially Dead for a reason. Also i've heard their pre-med students are quite aggressive. Uc davis has a more laid back and social vibe than ucsd, but it is also in the middle of nowhere lol. Their med school is in sacramento btw (like a 30 minute drive) so you'd need a car if you're doing ec's there. Ucsb is incredibly beautiful and social, but can also be very distracting! Especially when you're living in  the dorms, it's easy to go overboard and f up in school. If you're disciplined and have good time management, but also like having fun and being outdoors, ucsb is a best choice"
