My point was not “take your money and be happy”. People are allowed to be upset.  I don’t think I was being dismissive at all with my post, and if I was, I apologize."
ucr,fp8etl6,t1_fp8cmxl,1588390508.0,That’s absolutely a valid reason to be upset! DACA students should absolutely be taken into consideration! You’re amazing for helping your friend out. Hats off to you
ucr,fp8ef0n,t1_fp8b7nq,1588390222.0,I’m sorry that your roommate isn’t allocating their check very responsibly :(  I really do understand that everyone’s situation is different and we’re all being affected. I’m hoping that you and your family are able to get through this
ucr,fp8e27m,t1_fp8dqbs,1588389969.0,I honestly don’t know how they calculated any of it. My friends and I are all seniors and we all got different amounts ranging from 250-900
