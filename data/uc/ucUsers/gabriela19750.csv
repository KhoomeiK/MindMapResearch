namenerds,fpjf835,t1_fpjf3e3,1588666307.0,"That makes sense, thank you! I guess what I meant was in response to a lot of women actually named Karen being upset right now I just thought how can they be so upset when people have been bullied and called these racial slurs and insults for years if that makes sense, so in that sense I felt the playing field was even. Like they finally understand or have a glimpse into what it‚Äôs like"
namenerds,fpjemem,t1_fpjeixk,1588665691.0,"Thank you for the insight, I guess that makes sense. I have never heard anyone call a black woman Shaniqua and not mean it as an insult though, so I am confused by your last point"

changemyview,fpg5m6b,t1_fpfr2sk,1588594913.0,"Yes!!! It is SOOOOO creepy to me I can‚Äôt believe more people don‚Äôt feel this way too. A lot of other replies are saying they they‚Äôre never forced but when you teach kids from as young as 4-5 years old to do this every single day, it becomes engraved and normalized in their brains. I remember when I began to sat down during the pledge as I got older I got so many weird and snarky stares. It‚Äôs a very odd, unsettling and super unspoken culture/ritual that I really dislike"
changemyview,fpg5fh6,t3_gd50et,1588594761.0,Hi I know a lot of people are saying they didn‚Äôt experience this but I certainly did. I‚Äôve had friends who have been threatened saying they‚Äôre going to be in trouble for not saying the pledge or standing up. I think it‚Äôs such an odd and cult-like thing. One day I finally snapped out of it and realized I didn‚Äôt want to say it anymore or participate and watching my entire school stand there for 45 seconds reciting the pledge in the most monotone voice was pretty unsettling. No more pledge in schools sounds amazing to me
Vegetarianism,fpg1316,t1_fpg0zee,1588590881.0,Hmm they go on sale pretty often here so maybe they will in your local stores sometimes? Also I wanted to add that I think it‚Äôs really great that you‚Äôre considering/planning to go vegetarian to join your daughter. You‚Äôre a thoughtful and very supportive mom!
Vegetarianism,fpg0vqb,t1_fpg0nux,1588590686.0,Oh! There‚Äôs a brand by Linda McCartney that I think is also called Linda McCartney that makes some really great plant based foods (I hear). They‚Äôre not available here in the US but I‚Äôm pretty sure they‚Äôre in the UK! Linda was an amazing photographer and Paul McCartney‚Äôs first wife and they were both big animal rights advocates hence why she started the brand/company. Also I think if you go to a large grocery store there will be a section of plant based stuff in the frozen section. You could call and ask too
Vegetarianism,fpg0kaz,t3_gd7hch,1588590376.0,"I became vegetarian in October and thought I‚Äôd be one of those non-meat eaters who says no to faux meats. It was a silly mind set because I struggled for a few months trying to figure out what to eat besides lots of carbs to stay full. Now, I embrace any and all alternative meats. They‚Äôre usually on sale at Ralphs and Target and some of them are pretty amazing. It‚Äôs fun trying new products out and incorporating them into my meals like I would have normally before going veg. Things like nuggets, breakfast patties, and impossible burgers (to name just a few) have all helped me immensely and I‚Äôm now in a great groove. I decided one day to just quit eating meat without any planning. Even though it wasn‚Äôt super duper easy, it was perfectly doable. You‚Äôre doing something amazing for yourself and for others, so don‚Äôt give up or be too hard on yourself because you‚Äôll find your groove too!"
HappyTrees,fpfvkqu,t1_fpfveyk,1588585146.0,"Thank you so so much fire the reply! This is very helpful. Do you know what paints are missing from the set so that I can buy them as well? And for the fan brushes - did you buy the Bob Ross brand ones or different brand? I see some reviews complain about them. 
Also - where did you buy your master kit from? I looked on Jerry‚Äôs Artarama and it‚Äôs on backorder"
NoFeeAC,fpfp72c,t1_fpfo4n8,1588578537.0,Oh good idea thank you!!

NoFeeAC,fp8xryy,t1_fp8xrd6,1588406750.0,Ah okay! Still worth it for sure :-) thank you for the answer!
NoFeeAC,fp8xqbz,t1_fp8xoqs,1588406704.0,Ohhh okay that makes sense thank you! Does it show up in the book shopping app for the same amount of bells?
NoFeeAC,fp8xm1s,t3_gc2qtc,1588406581.0,Hi! I don‚Äôt have enough bells to buy the crown (sadly) but I just have a question - what does cataloguing mean? I‚Äôve seen people ask this when people buy items but I don‚Äôt really understand the process or what it is.
NoFeeAC,fp8x9q8,t1_fp8x9bb,1588406227.0,Yay thanks sm :-)!!

orangecounty,fp8pp77,t1_fp8piz0,1588399008.0,"Hey, it‚Äôs clear you wanna go join them. That‚Äôs all you but I‚Äôm staying inside in my home where I know I‚Äôll be okay. There is a risk every time you go out, even if it‚Äôs small. Why put yourself in risk like that if you can avoid it by simply waiting to go to places like the beach?"
orangecounty,fp8odbh,t1_fp8nv8s,1588397879.0,"Yes, you should exercise but maintain your distance and these people are not. That is what I‚Äôm talking about

‚ÄúYeah, it's OK to go outside. U.V. sunlight does degrade the virus. You need to maintain social distance.‚Äù These people at the beach are not doing that."
orangecounty,fp8luly,t1_fp8lr93,1588395785.0,"Please, share the models that say that it‚Äôs impossible catching this outside. I have yet to hear a credible doctor say that so please cite your sources."

orangecounty,fp86s6r,t1_fp86nmo,1588384967.0,Oh yeah? Why can‚Äôt you just step outside your own home or go in your backyard to get some sun? Why do you HAVE to drive down to the beach with hundreds of other people just few feet away from you where you can risk getting infected. Going to the beach is not an essential and it is not the end of the world if you have to ‚Äúget some sun‚Äù in your front yard instead.
NoFeeAC,fp84rly,t3_gbx027,1588383479.0,"Hi! I‚Äôd love to have one, I‚Äôve been looking. I‚Äôm not online right now but can I message you a bit later?"
orangecounty,fp7lvhf,t3_gbfxjy,1588373093.0,Being an OC resident is so embarrassing right now. These people make it seem like we can‚Äôt go a single second without being at the beach. Everyone who went is a moron and you‚Äôre making us all look like clowns.

fashionadvice,fp588ym,t3_gbdeuv,1588319752.0,"Mmm to be honest, I see what you mean because I‚Äôve also felt that they‚Äôre going out of style since the straight leg look is in but who cares! There‚Äôs definitely still a place for them and if you like them, wear them. I‚Äôm sure you rock them and there‚Äôs no reason you should stop simply because there may be a more popular look for the time being. They‚Äôre both nice, so Go for it!"

AnimalCrossing,fp1m96r,t1_fp1m7he,1588240427.0,Tbh too many in my opinion. I don‚Äôt have a lot of bells or NMT‚Äôs so idk if people have a lot because they‚Äôre time traveling or doing hacks? I saw someone ask for 800 NMT‚Äôs for him which is pretty insane

ACTrade,fp05gqn,t3_gadsmf,1588202843.0,My first animal crossing game was Pocket camp and I completely fell in love with Apollo and Goldie. I miss them and have spent a lot of energy and NMT‚Äôs trying to find them with no luck. It would be a dream to reunite with them again!
