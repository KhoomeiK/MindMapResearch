worldnews,foeo8sl,t1_foe4ct4,1587709321.0,"Here's a take you don't here often if you grew up in America, but you might if you read leftist literature:

The founding fathers were all rich privilleged people (except Washington who married into wealth). They all had a lot to gain financially from independence. John Hancock for example, who basically does nothing else in history except a fat fucking signature, was just some rich dude who had a shitload of debt that knew independence would mean debt forgiveness

All of these rich people also owned like all of the papers and media. So they basically churned out a bunch of pro-independence rhetoric to the point that they got about a third of the colonists to actually support independence. A third were opposed and another third basically didn't care. But once shit was started, that ""neutral"" third were forced to pick a side

So in short: a bunch of rich people started a revolution in order to avoid paying taxes and debts. 

Since the British outlawed slavery much sooner and since they had a different approach to dealing with Native Americans, we probably would have had abolition and millions of Native Americans (and their cultures) might have survived genocide."
