ACTrade,foqyst4,t3_g8youb,1588003196.0,"Hey! I'm sorry I don't have any info about the person you're looking for, but this is totally new to me. I didn't know a villager could just move in from another town without you having to go there and invite the villager! Or am I missing something? 

Either way maybe try looking through the ""people I've played with"" list on your device!"
ACVillager,fopsq0s,t1_fopmjul,1587970891.0,"Trading on discord servers. You can easily make a couple by trading furniture another player won't have access to or make 50+ trading rare items. 

Within about a month I was slowly able to make 500 NMT by saving."
ACTrade,fopsee4,t3_g8nr84,1587970597.0,"Look back through your ""people I've played with"" list on your switch account. You should find the friend code of the person who gave Tangy to you and maybe use that to look the person up if they've commented on this subreddit?"
BuddyCrossing,fok0yfp,t3_g7mf47,1587833321.0,"I have been blessed to not have been scammed yet, and even when I traded with someone who directly messaged (I now know not to do that) things went smoothly... After reading your post I've learned that keeping the inventory open is a safe way to feel out scammers so thank you for that and I hope this doesn't happen to you again..."
ACVillager,fok01px,t3_g7rfzp,1587832815.0,"This is like the only long text looking for Raymond post I've upvoted, I died at ""dreamy weamy squishy poo"" and ""grandad war veteran Raymond"" people are going nuts over this freaking cat. 

so glad you've found him!"
ACVillager,foeo56o,t1_foen60s,1587709233.0,Same... I've only had good buying prices so far.
ACVillager,foen5ee,t1_foe9yzp,1587708378.0,A good price for what?
ACVillager,foe9kmv,t1_foe1xjo,1587698820.0," charging entrance fees for good turnip prices, and villagers crafting good diys, trading extra diys, and charging people to catalog full sets of things. Some people also sell hybrids for 2 NMT per flower. By doing this slowly day by day I was able to make 500 NMT in a few weeks."

AskReddit,fn95oq7,t3_g0dbik,1586760299.0,"I get sleep paralysis almost every night and it's hard. Sometimes I have an especially bad night of it where I'll go in and out of sleep paralysis 4-5 times before finally sleeping like normal. Between the boughts, I ""fight"" to wake myself back up by trying to open my eyes, or sometimes breathing loud enough through my nose so my boyfriend next to me hears it and wakes me up. Breath is one of the only things I can control in sleep paralysis."
MakeupAddiction,fn8suu5,t1_fn8rexm,1586749363.0,"I'm very diligent about washing them especially after the allergies started... It's very possible my eyeshadows are expired, I'll try to see if new shadows don't trigger this!"

MakeupAddiction,fn8qxln,t1_fn8qgyd,1586747954.0,"Hmmm I don't own cream or gel eyeshadows, and yesterday I only put on pressed powdered shadows! Maybe those expired? Still, That's a great idea! I'll try to buy a dupe of some of the singles I had and see if a new version doesn't trigger it. Thank you!"

*Approximately a third of written Japanese text is comprised of Chinese characters."
AnimalCrossing,fmyqfze,t1_fmxo3ju,1586492759.0,I think Villagers have preferences! Marshal wears a waistcoat I gave him more than his starting clothes. Meanwhile I've gifted Francine like 4 dresses but I rarely see her wear any of it.
AskReddit,fmyop8k,t1_fmxxh19,1586491422.0,Japanese had 3 alphabets. One of them is Kanji which is Chinese characters!
AskReddit,fmwkv28,t1_fmuucyn,1586448393.0,That's hilarious because a third of the Japanese language is Chinese characters.

AnimalCrossing,fmliiue,t1_fml9gtp,1586187099.0,"I don't get why people get so salty about TT. it's not like the fossils just magically appear in the museum if you TT, you still have to dig them up and get them assessed. The only difference is the wait time, yet people who don't TT act like they did more work or something. Congrats on finishing your museum! Sorry that people here weren't really receptive."
