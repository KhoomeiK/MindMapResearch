berkeley,foiwl61,t3_g7ghw3,1587799465.0,"I just got accepted as a transfer after two years at a CC. It's so worth it! It's okay to be sad about not getting in as a freshman, but the upsides of a community college are not to be overlooked. The Cal Grant left me with more money than I had entering college, and it was a really good stepping stone to prepare me for how college works. I could go on a many paragraph rant as to why you're making the right decision lol- Rock it at CC, and you'll be a better Bear for it :) ðŸ’—ðŸ’—"
AnimalCrossing,fo4rqpu,t1_fo4rl00,1587509941.0,You need to have available plots in order to get villagers to spawn again on mystery islands.
AnimalCrossing,fo4ri6x,t1_fo4r2xu,1587509812.0,"Up to you. Exotic fruit (not your native apples) sell for more on your island, so it might be a good idea to keep them around for some extra bells and mats (more wood will come in handy!). As you progress you might feel you only need a couple of different fruit trees, but it's ultimately your choice"
AnimalCrossing,fo4r9zj,t1_fo4onk8,1587509689.0,"Number of factors (I get bad headaches too!) Try and see what might be affecting you. inb4 I'm not a doctor this is just what I do lol
1. Try blue light lenses, the normal color palette screens give off can really strain the eyes.
2. Go outside and let your eyes adjust to outside light before going back inside. Being inside all the time really weakens your eyesight 
3. Put the screen farther from your face. At least a foot if you're in handheld"
AnimalCrossing,fo4qigg,t1_fo4po7m,1587509271.0,"Shooting stars are random, but there are chances that there will be meteor showers when the nights are clear to farm stars. Villagers will usually make a comment that there will be a shower that night to tip you off to keep a look out!
I've had Celeste visit 3 times now, twice during a meteor shower, the other time I wasn't sure. My guess is she always comes when there's a meteor shower, maybe random on other clear nights. Hope that helps!"

Theatre,fn1y7is,t3_fyi05u,1586573003.0,"The only characters that I can think off the top of my head that needs a prof makeup artist to do are Elphaba, Shrek/Fiona, and the Phantom. Every other role the actors learn how to do themselves. This includes the Jellicle cats and the drag queens in Kinky Boots. 
Correct me if I'm wrong tho!"
