Zoom meetings suck and they can make me really frustrated too. If you’ve already talked to some friends about it, you might’ve noticed that some people don’t really mind the zoom meetings. I think some people just find it really find the “recorded voice” sound really uncomfortable. If this is you, I think you should email your professor and maybe even DSP to see if they can help you find a way to learn the material without having to listen your professors’ excruciating voices. 

Good luck!"

This means they will have to increase the amount of food and because theres more variability in the number of students swiping in, therefore leading to a shit ton more wasted food. 

Also if swipes rolled over until the end of the quarter, the dining commons will be wayyyyy more crowded towards the end of the quarter to the point of overcapacity at all times. The lines when dinner starts are already really long, but imagine that line being 2 or 3 times longer and also lasting during the entire dinner hours. It’s really not a stretch to say that students coming to get dinner at 7:30 might not be able to get in because the line is too long. 

It might even lead to shittier working conditions in all the dining commons because they would be so crowded towards the end of the quarter. 

I know it sucks but while rollover swipes would save us money, it would affect us/others in negative ways. If you take summer classes, those swipes will rollover throughout the quarter!"
