shortscarystories,fphxah6,t3_gd91v6,1588629519.0,I learnt how to swim when my dad dumped me into the sea when I was like 7 so this brought on some very repressed traumatic memories yay
berkeley,fphuwqj,t3_gdidkc,1588628254.0,Yeah there are definitely a lot of us in the same boat as you are. I had an on campus job so they stopped that and my summer employment has also been cancelled so it‚Äôs whole shitstorm of uncertainty and anxiety. We have nothing much to do but just carry on I guess and hope things work out?
berkeley,fowzy10,t3_g9wn09,1588130817.0,I was very excited for the class but felt underwhelmed during the semester. Vance was definitely the best out of the three and coscoy the worst (I‚Äôm sure he‚Äôs fine but his accent is really thick). There‚Äôs a lot more focus on the science part rather than the social aspect of pandemics which was disappointing for me but I think others enjoyed it.
berkeley,fo3ytwt,t1_fo3mx1c,1587495275.0,I have the same origin story and I‚Äôm a horror enthusiast AND I‚Äôm a poli sci major!! What‚Äôs your all time favourite horror media?
aftergifted,fnmqlcs,t3_g2aus2,1587076280.0,"Oh wow the horrors just kept going. Honestly I started reading this post with skepticism because self diagnosis and this forum produce a lot of normal people thinking they‚Äôre more than. Your story, however, is definitely not in that category. I‚Äôm terribly sorry that you had to endure all that stress and pressure from multiple sources from such a young age and over such a long period of time. As someone with a similar life trajectory (forced into cram school too yay), I find your life inspiring because I too hope I can get out of the horrible burnout depression phase and find my own happiness like you did. Congratulations on your growth, kudos!!"
berkeley,fnfcunc,t1_fneqsl2,1586905651.0,Oh duck I don‚Äôt know what this means and I have to do more goddamn research now ugh. Thanks for the info though!!
berkeley,fnergwd,t3_g0ynk1,1586894534.0,I had ibser and I was bored enough to drop the class and take it during summer sessions instead. The material is not difficult if you have coding and stats experience but holy hot damn is the class boring.
berkeley,fneqjzo,t3_g1b704,1586894069.0,People definitely exaggerate the competitive workaholic aspects of Cal because once here it‚Äôs like every other university. There are frequent parties in frat row (some are actually decent like the queer frat); there‚Äôs a few pubs near campus that seem very active; there‚Äôs also bound to be people that are also looking for the same social experience you are so you just have to find them and party together. I ended up finding the perfect group for drunk Barbie movie weekends so take advantage of the enormous student body and exploit those niche interests.
berkeley,fnepjhr,t3_g1byp7,1586893559.0,I assumed there wouldn‚Äôt be reserved seats because it‚Äôs a lower div class but I‚Äôm on the waitlist as well. I‚Äôm actually planning on talking to my advisor about this so I‚Äôll keep you updated!! (üçàüçàüçà)
TellMeAFact,fmn9ldz,t3_fvuky0,1586221116.0,Two dudes having sex is considered to be in this category and the legal repercussion is capital punishment.
CrypticPark,fmn8j3b,t3_fw5nnw,1586220468.0,"did not think I‚Äôd see temple run 2 on my feed today but I‚Äôve been blessed, thanks dude"
abuse,fmn8d3z,t3_fw24op,1586220364.0,"Yes definitely!! A lot of childhood trauma survivors use escaping into their own heads as a coping mechanism where it‚Äôs almost like an out of body experience. This usually develops into phenomena called dissociation, derealisation, depersonalisation etc where a person basically is no longer able to control when they retreat into their heads and lose their ability to focus on the present. There are therapy techniques and medication (Naltrexone has worked wonders for me) that help with reducing these episodes and allowing better control so definitely talk to a doctor if you‚Äôre able."
ADHD,fmn7cj4,t3_fw4wye,1586219746.0,This is the exact reason I come to this sub instead of talking to my neurotypical friends because where else can we find this kind of solidarity?
IntltoUSA,fmn76vb,t3_fvvt7a,1586219647.0,You have to switch to an F1 and cancel your current visa which you can do online or at your embassy. Congratulations on Berkeley though!! GO BEARS üêª
exmuslim,fm9zr2l,t3_ftrawl,1585880314.0,What the actual fuck. It‚Äôs incredible how these people exist and vocalise thoughts like this and experience no repercussions. Fucked up.
