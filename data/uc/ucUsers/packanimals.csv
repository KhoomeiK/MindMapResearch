Yep! Presence. This thing is haunted. As seen by his horizontal line in photo, we call our ghost friend Kipp. After the late designer, Kipp Stewart. Kipp is a friendly ghost who only makes his presence known in photos. Kipp is solely responsible for the protection and cleanliness of the hutchâ€™s contents. You wonâ€™t find a speck of dust on anything you choose to display! Kipp is on it! 

Take in confidence that not only will you have a gorgeous mid century display hutch, but a story and a new friend - named Kipp!"
