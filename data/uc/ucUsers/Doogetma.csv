learnmath,fp7f7cj,t1_fp7e5pc,1588369496.0,"Base e is the natural logarithm. It makes more sense that way. In all my classes at this point, log = ln unless another base is specified. I think it was around calc 3 or so that this idea was introduced to me. And then it was pretty consistently used in all my subsequent math and engineering classes"
wholesomememes,fozonvx,t1_fozk5fs,1588194183.0,"Bro sounds like you’re depressed. You deserve to get help, so talk to your doctor about it. Therapy and medication did wonders for my life! You may have to shop around for a good therapist and/or medication as it’s not a one size fits all. The hardest part is reaching out for help. But I believe in you!"
adventuretime,foxqnqy,t1_foxhefv,1588152879.0,I think that’s also what it’s called in my official copy of Adventure Time Munchkin. Great game btw.
UCSD,foxq43h,t3_ga4thh,1588152326.0,Damn you’re still submitting work? Doing better than me.
dndmemes,fox4r3h,t1_fox3k9y,1588134041.0,"I definitely agree with you. Not letting them know of game mechanics may have been bad wording. I just meant not explicitly referencing them. This is pretty much how I handle it when I'm running a game. I give hints through descriptive story telling rather than just reading the stat block to them. It was also a poor choice of words for me to say that's what a good DM *should* do. Rather, I would say its what a good DM *should be able* to do. A good DM can accommodate their party. Maybe my experience is unique, but I've found most parties crave more immersion, so I find hints through story telling to be very important to have in a DM's toolbelt."
dndmemes,fox3m40,t1_fox340k,1588133270.0,"While it's true that it's fine as long as you're having fun, I still think people should give a second thought to whether it actually is more fun as it's fairly antithetical to the philosophy of D&D to meta game. D&D is usually meant to be about being immersed in a new world and meta gaming tends to pull you back out of that world. I think if that strategic experience is what one is looking for rather than an immersive one, there are much better table top games for one to be playing than D&D.

And as a side note, meta gaming doesn't only affect those who do it. In a table with both players that seek immersion and meta gamers, the meta gaming can easily ruin it for the other players. So I think it's good to be careful not to include extra meta gaming mechanics in a DM style unless you're sure all your players want that."

dndmemes,fox2g65,t1_fowyiab,1588132485.0,This is just meta gaming to me. Your character shouldn’t be able to make decisions based on the information about a creatures remaining legendary resistances that they wouldn’t know. And a good DM should make the power of a creature clear through storytelling rather than letting the players know about certain game mechanics.
badmathematics,fo4n7cf,t1_fo4n2lx,1587507491.0,Oh lmao you right. Look at me trying to explain stuff and then getting it wrong myself. Thanks!!
badmathematics,fo43apr,t1_fo3vy87,1587497470.0,"The problem with this is that it is assuming your odds of contracting during the pandemic can be based off of the current percentage of people that have contracted it. 

Right now, it has killed 0.002% of the population of NY. It’s going to kill a lot more as this runs its course. If the population is P and the people killed are D then the percent killed is (D/P)*100%. The denominator of that will not change significantly. However, the numerator will get much larger compared to its current value, yielding a very different final value. I would assume you’re hoping to ascertain your odds of dying to the virus at any point during the pandemic, which this does not capture. It only captures the odds that a person in NY has died to it up until this point. So maybe it’s a decent measure to use in hindsight after this is all over, but as it is now I don’t think it is particularly useful. 

Even the death rate among those with the virus might actually change as we go as well. This is because we will run low on ventilators and other life-saving supplies.

Edit: Fixed the expression for percentage killed by virus"
badmathematics,fo2jqn9,t1_fo2izn3,1587465048.0,"It killed 0.002% of the total population of NY, not 0.002% of the people who had it. For it to be a 0.002% death rate based off that, it would mean that every single citizen of NY would have to have had it which is clearly not the case. And no reason to feel dumb, these things are confusing and you’re actually smart for asking for clarification."
dndmemes,fo0zrxc,t1_fo0yq06,1587422900.0,I’d say the exact opposite. They clearly messed up and there should be consequences. Nothing is thrilling in a world without consequences

HumansBeingBros,fnrv570,t1_fnrgcc2,1587202764.0,"What differentiates it other than the severity of endangerment caused when in the context of punishment? 

In both cases, it is a driver acting irresponsibly and unlawfully in a way that endangers those around them. Obviously those around a drunk driver are in much more danger, but the potential effects are similar when the probabilities of those effects are put aside. Since driving too fast is less likely to result in a death than drunk driving, it has an accordingly reduced penalty, of course. However it is still a penalty that should be served unless there was a clear reason they had to drive at that speed. Taking your son to chemo is a very nice thing to do but it doesn’t require you to break the speed limit."
HumansBeingBros,fnqzblq,t1_fnqw98w,1587175579.0,"If no harm no foul, should drunk drivers that don’t hit anyone be let free?

Edit: This is not meant to say that what this man did is as bad a drunk driving. It is merely meant to illustrate that the law is meant to be enforced to deter dangerous behavior. I think this man is a very good man. I also think he should have to abide by laws like any other citizen. His unfortunately circumstances are irrelevant to how fast he chooses to drive. However, I understand that the judges decision would make sense if it was a couple miles over. If he was actually driving dangerously then he should absolutely pay the fine."

dndmemes,fmvtrjv,t1_fmvfozm,1586430589.0,I got one for 15 bucks or so on amazon and I couldn’t love it more. It rolls forever but that just adds to the suspense. It really does make d100 rolls feel much more special.
