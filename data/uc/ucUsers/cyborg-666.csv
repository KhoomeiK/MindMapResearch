UCSantaBarbara,fog7kgm,t3_g6uex0,1587748947.0,Do both if you're not taking other classes and are able to pay for them
UCSantaBarbara,fog6ob0,t3_g6yf3v,1587748612.0,Drop math 4a and/or physics and you should be fine.  Honestly if you're a bio/chem major then doing all of that is not worth it unless you wanna finish in like three years.
UCSantaBarbara,fo4vl0i,t1_fo4u1s8,1587512074.0,"Yeah definitely!! It sucks that me typing slowly and just getting confused on what some questions want (those are usually the questions he ends up removing due to poor writing lol) can take up more than 50% of my 20 minutes. Not saying that Lewis is easier, but he's definitely more understanding of the situation that the students are going through than Gainer. 

I also feel that I understand the material well enough to get an A in the class, but Gainer is testing our ability to type/read quickly rather than testing our knowledge and understanding of the material."

The time limit stresses me shitless every weekðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚"
UCSantaBarbara,fo4iy30,t1_fo3x08o,1587505266.0,The averages have been in the 50s and low 60s for Gainer. He still hasn't added the 3.5 points for the questions that he messed up on on quiz 2 tho. Definitely the short 20 minutes limit is driving the averages way below Lewis' averages.
UCSantaBarbara,fnyo2hk,t1_fnyl8n4,1587369376.0,Hahaha I'm on the other side of the globe so 7 was the best option for me but I'm doing the 8 one now since f ProctorU
UCSantaBarbara,fmf8lc7,t3_fuw1kk,1586022107.0,"I don't. I receive a good amount of grants and scholarships due to my parents not having good salaries. But even with financial aid, I still need to pay around 2.5k each quarter. My parents take care of around 1k and I take care of the rest + my pocket money by working while I'm on campus/during breaks. I was also able to take 8 units for summer school last year with the money I had saved up.

I don't think many people graduate loan free, which is why I think that only needing to pay around 2.5k every quarter after financial aid is a blessing."
