2 - assuming you’re living in a residence hall, you don’t really get much of a choice. For your top picks you should probably go with unit 1 and 2, but there’s not much of a guarantee. Also don’t be afraid to live in a triple, I think they’re great. If you’re doing off campus housing, good luck.

3 - I’m not in greek life but I know quite a few people who are and they enjoy it. The party life is definitely good even if you don’t join a frat or sorority, as long as you know the right people.

4 - I wouldn’t buy a car. Most essential places you need to go are accesible with public transportation, biking, or just walking. You’ll get a prepaid clipper card already anyways, which allows you to ride the AC transit buses, so I’d encourage you to learn about those and see if they’ll get you where you want to go. You can also use gig cars if you want to go somewhere else, I’m sure if you budget that it’ll probably be cheaper than buying a car.

All in all, don’t take any of my suggestions if they’re not what you want to do. It’s up to you now, best of luck!"
