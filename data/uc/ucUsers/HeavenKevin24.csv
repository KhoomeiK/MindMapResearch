UCSantaBarbara,fpm6a24,t3_ge9fg3,1588726430.0,"If you’re an incoming freshman, then it was on May 1st. 

If you’re an incoming transfer student, then it’s June 1st."
UCSantaBarbara,fpdbfhn,t3_gcnrhb,1588523677.0,As far as I know cal grant only covers tuition throughout fall/winter/spring.
memes,fp849uw,t1_fp7wabs,1588383071.0,I think it is
UCSantaBarbara,fp7mzkn,t1_fp7mb8t,1588373709.0,I didn’t get this email either :(
UCSantaBarbara,fp7mhqs,t3_gbs7ec,1588373435.0,The more important question is: do they even care?
learnmath,fp53ape,t1_fp526w7,1588314925.0,"Honestly, your advice is great! I’m an undergrad right now taking the second half of linear algebra (upper level) and intro to topology. I find it a constant challenge especially with online schooling. But mentioning of struggling with learning something difficult and marching on just touched me."
UCSantaBarbara,fp4uvyg,t1_fp4rt2h,1588308007.0,Math 4A?
learnmath,fp4gnua,t3_gb9926,1588298643.0,Let v be a nonzero vector. Suppose that v is linearly dependent. Then there exists a nonzero scalar a such that av = 0. Then v = a^(-1)(av) = a^(-1)0 = 0. This is a contradiction thus a set containing a nonzero vector v is linearly independent. Keep in mind this isn’t the answer to your proof only showing that a set containing one vector (not 0) is linearly independent.
UCSantaBarbara,fp3hj98,t3_garvbo,1588279411.0,I’m ready to just die
UCSantaBarbara,fp31ene,t3_gb0ikq,1588271441.0,Add codes are usually just based on the waitlist. The department handles them.
UCSantaBarbara,foynxb1,t1_foymf1k,1588175931.0,I heard it’s based off financial need.
learnmath,fopqhi1,t3_g8urh2,1587968889.0,You know what b is. Plug in b into the equation for a. And then solve.
UCSantaBarbara,foi8j0v,t1_fobhgog,1587780948.0,I got my refund on March 31st. Did you get a readjusted refund for cost of living change?
halo,foi6ysa,t1_fogts1k,1587780009.0,I used to play this when I’d do my homework. Made things so much easier.
UCSantaBarbara,fohjqtb,t1_foh3c5p,1587767116.0,Does she usually tell the grade cutoffs for midterms when we get them back?
UCSantaBarbara,fofovw1,t3_g78mok,1587740182.0,I’m pretty sure you can still P/NP since it’s being applied to your degree in your department (assuming bio psych opted in). But if you have any doubt you can always email your department advisor.
UCSantaBarbara,fock5ap,t1_fociqja,1587672281.0,Will you complete calculus 1 and 2 by end of spring? That’s one of the things you might have missed.
UCSantaBarbara,fociln0,t3_g6tilf,1587671754.0,Will you have more than 90 UC transferable semester credits by the end of spring?
UCSantaBarbara,focdv2y,t3_g6t09z,1587670160.0,What areas are you exactly having problems with? Logic? Proof techniques? Relations/ functions?
UCSantaBarbara,focd8pn,t1_foccqnz,1587669953.0,Fuck that sucks
UCSantaBarbara,foccz66,t1_focbuao,1587669867.0,"There is no limit, however for the major coursework 2/3 of it must be completed for a letter grade. It is for both lower and upper division classes. Also keep in mind if you’re below 2.5gpa for premajor requirements and you take classes P/NP they will not count towards your gpa."
UCSantaBarbara,fob4tjk,t3_g6omfr,1587656129.0,"Just buy a fan. Trust me it’s not really that hot here. In fact, during the summer we have the best weather."
UCSantaBarbara,fnx76ur,t3_g3ycx8,1587332827.0,"Sounds fine for session A, but it’s definitely going to be a struggle for session B since cs40 is overlapping with PSTAT 120 and Math 6A."
learnmath,fnsso83,t1_fnril5x,1587228050.0,Notice that n^(-1) corresponde to the fraction 1/n. Then add 1 + 1/n = (n+ 1)/n. And do this with the denominator too. Once you’ve reduced you will get something you can more easily see.
learnmath,fnrgxv8,t3_g3ie6j,1587188623.0,Have you tried reducing it? What does (2 - n - 2) = ? Then tackle the numerator. Then you can find your answer.
UCSantaBarbara,fnq952k,t3_g389v2,1587160073.0,"Porter 100% 

I heard great things about Ograin too."
learnmath,fnnzavq,t3_g2roq2,1587106521.0,"Well, after you finish up calculus, you should go do linear algebra, then brush into ODE’s. Get a book on logic and basic proof techniques. Then you can move on to numerical analysis and PDE’s."
UCSantaBarbara,fnmutzw,t3_g2pigl,1587078587.0,"It’s your administrative paid leave. The UC president announced it a while back. Full time workers get 128 hours worth, and part time student works get a portion depending on the average amount of hours you worked each week for winter quarter. 

If you worked an average of 10 hours each week (which is 25% of a 40 hour work week) you would get 25% of that 128 hours; that is 32 hours."
UCSantaBarbara,fnai052,t1_fnahq9q,1586797845.0,Yup.
UCSantaBarbara,fnahitw,t3_g0mxqf,1586797608.0,"Don’t sign up for classes, or if you did drop them."
UCSantaBarbara,fn2d71d,t1_fn2asd9,1586584970.0,"No, i guess it happened this quarter cause the final was postponed to this quarter since coronavirus."
UCSantaBarbara,fn24ne9,t3_fyw1z0,1586577738.0,Does anybody have any information on this?
UCSantaBarbara,fmtrraj,t3_fxe0gv,1586377873.0,Last I checked no. I heard everything is closed with the exception of a couple places.
UCSantaBarbara,fmqst3q,t3_fwiee6,1586306287.0,Is his class really that bad? I’m debating whether or not to sign up with him for 124A over summer haha.
learnmath,fmcn59q,t1_fmcm5gv,1585948888.0,"Sorry, I forgot to include that, but for an arbitrary metric space."
