ABCDesis,fpm2ai7,t1_fpl0qf6,1588724105.0,"Ahh I see. If you are afraid of counseling, I would say just go for it, it's not as scary as it seems but I get it. And like I said before, it's not your responsibility to ensure your mother is not depressed. It's admirable that you're trying to help her but you cannot cure her depression. Because I was in a similar space last year, I would say, take a note from your sibling and enjoy your life a little. I too held some resentment against my sibling as she didn't have to do anything while I was roped into elder care with my parents effectively keeping me away from my studies. If anything, you can encourage them to help out every once in a while but they could also be distancing themselves from your parents' issues which I recommend you do as well. Your mother if she has depression, it isn't something that can only be fixed by you. She wld likely need therapy and possibly medication. I would say if you are up to it and continue to spend time with her. And what do I talk to my parents? just random parent appropriate funny things that have happened or interesting things ive learned in college.

But please please please don't shift your mom's burden on yourself. It's not something you have control over or something you can fix.  And please please do not do anything to help ""change your dad."" It's really not worth your effort. Pm me if you have more questions:'("
AskWomen,fpkw9mb,t3_ge1tsm,1588702131.0,"umm lmfao it was pretty recent. i just accepted they didn't want to talk to me as they never tried to reciprocate the same energy i gave them via texts after this covid thing. tragic as we pretty much clicked otherwise. i think i was just caught up in the feeling of someone being very similar to me in terms of location and background than actually liking them (but idk i could be just trying to make myself seem less pathetic). anyway it feels so good not to like them anymore ahah. they blew me off so often ahaha i shoulda taken a hint
edit: feeling wasn’t that intense tho"
ABCDesis,fpkvlh5,t3_gdupxg,1588701800.0,"Aha lemme guess? Eldest kid? This post seems like I wrote it last year without the infidelity and money issues so I'll tell you what helped me last year. You are *not* your mom's therapist. If it is bothering you, you need to let her know in a nice way that you love her but you can't keep being the ashtray for her venting. Their issues are likely to be lifelong and irreparable at this point. When they fight, just try not to hear them and lighten whatever burden your mum may have at home if you want to help. Like if she does a lot of housework, help her out yknow. I used to intervene all the time trying to prevent physical fights n stuff but it usually never helps. 

If your school has a counseling service or you have access to a therapist, try to get into that because sessions with my hs counselor helped so much as I was able to talk to someone who was impartial about my issues. And most importantly, try to move out as soon as you can wether it be through going to college far away (that's what i did) or just moving out. 

Also, just know it's not your fault and that your parents are just Like That. Hang in there my guy :("
