stupidpol,foirfb7,t1_fohma4l,1587794610.0,Yeah. Trump won by the narrowest of margins in key states in a perfect storm. I don't think he can pull the same off when unemployment is double digits and many of his voters either have died or known people who have died of COVID.
stupidpol,fohjeba,t1_fogqet7,1587766949.0,"It was going to be a real hard sell for people to vote Trump out if the Dow was hanging around 30k and unemployment was in the 3-4% range. If unemployment is 10-15% by election night, Trump is very unlikely to win. Not impossible, but it would definitely be a long-shot."
stupidpol,fohic05,t1_foghp0h,1587766469.0,"Yeah I think Biden is likely to win unless by some miracle Covid-19 ends up disappearing soon and the economy completely rebounds by his election day. I don't see that being very likely and I see enough retarded old boomers who just want to feel normal again coming out for Biden who are sick of Trump telling people to inject disinfectant (as hilarious as that is).

Of course, we won't escape the cycle of shitty democrats letting everyone down and leading to horrible conservative takeovers later on and the Democrats are morons for letting this happen, but I would say Biden is very favored to win this one. That said, who the hell knows - voter suppression in swing states could be worse or some states like WI and MI and FL that ended up getting rid of some of those laws after the 2018 midterms might actually make the difference."
stupidpol,fo5hwgx,t1_fo3w7jx,1587526047.0,"you're getting pushback but you're 100% correct. as much as obama sucked ass, obama the candidate was extremely compelling, especially in 2008. obama the actual leader was a lying snake but he talked a good game and had the likability to back it up. pete was a poor imitation."
stupidpol,fo1q263,t1_fo10b0g,1587438841.0,"what fucking evidence do you have that isn't based off of phone subscriptions or US intelligence agency lies

china underestimated the death toll because they were the first outbreak and were the ones learning how to detect this new virus. that does not mean they lied about it, it means mistakes were made. it will likely be revised up, that doesn't mean it's a ""coverup"", just like how new york city and italy discovering more bodies in nursing homes weren't an active coverup."
stupidpol,fo0sy87,t1_fo0omc4,1587419176.0,"It wasn't identified as being a novel virus until the end of December. This is was retroactive discovery of a previous case, not something that was actively being covered up during the period.

This isn't something where all of the data is known with certainty immediately. You can't very well accuse them of lying about something they hadn't identified fully themselves."

stupidpol,fnxngt2,t1_fnxn764,1587342349.0,"Simple. Republicans are a white nationalist party. Black voters by far won't vote for a party that hates them openly. Democrats at least talk about how important their vote is (to the point where they'll throw the entire party behind whoever the most right wing of their party that mostly lives in states that never go for a democrat in the general election).

That and the fact that Republicans actively try to keep suppressing their votes while Democrats (rightfully) call foul on voter suppression. No surprise that they wouldn't vote for Republicans."
stupidpol,fnxn125,t1_fnwtuz6,1587342078.0,"I never heard it until I had to take a diversity class in undergrad where I decided to take a class called ""History of Mexican America"" which actually was a pretty interesting class about the history of Latinos in this country. I didn't think much of the name at the time other than ""hmm, how are you supposed to pronounce that"" but yeah it really does seem like no one outside of woke academia uses that term."
stupidpol,fnxmuo9,t1_fnxktx9,1587341968.0,"To be frank, that black church vote they talk so proudly about? I don't fucking trust them, and I sure as hell won't vote for their interests over mine. They're economically conservative, socially extremely conservative. I still remember when they came out strongly to ban gay marriage in California when every other group was pretty evenly split between banning it and keeping it legal (whites and asians both went majority against the ban, while latino voters being more religious went slightly for the ban but it was still relatively close)."
stupidpol,fnxmjl5,t1_fnxlger,1587341776.0,"i know this is veering on idpol but i remember the prop 8 vote in california. asian and whites were both 49% yes to ban gay marriage, latino voters were 53% yes.

black voters, though? 70%. black voters absolutely are more conservative in general when you control for class."

stupidpol,fmverq9,t1_fmuvmyr,1586414482.0,"at this point i really don't think it would have mattered. by all accounts biden was dead in the water after new hampshire and it would have looked really silly for them to keep beating a dead horse when pete and bloomberg looked like the more viable threats. maybe after nevada and biden placing a distant second there he could have hit him harder on it, but with the scale of intervention in south carolina and the fact that black voters are more conservative in general and tied to a embedded democratic machine in south carolina, the state wouldn't have gone any other way.

bernie's fuckups were minor (the selma thing was a mistake, i don't buy for a second the ""he should have tried getting clyburn's endorsement"" bullshit though) compared to the overall scale of intervention on the part of a party towards a candidate who fucked up bigtime in the first few states."

taiwan and south korea also did this and had much better numbers because they acted quicker. china fucked up in the beginning but their overwhelming response to basically shut their economy down for a month+ and lock everyone down who was exposed to someone who was tested positive worked.

china's government sucks ass but it just so happens that they probably handled this pandemic decently well after the initial coverup."
