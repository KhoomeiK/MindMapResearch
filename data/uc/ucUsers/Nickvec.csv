berkeley,fox0467,t3_g9tt35,1588130927.0,I hate 16B so much. Took 16B with Sahai last year and am emotionally scarred.
berkeley,fowynju,t3_g9vxb0,1588130005.0,"Thank you so for much this, Nick. Your opinion is highly valued in the community, and I think this may be a wake-up call for a lot of people.

Also, what an amazing use of dice to illustrate fatality rate. It's too easy to get lost in the numbers and not realize what the true chances really are - very enlightening."

Coronavirus,fo5o01u,t1_fo4z9w7,1587530561.0,"We should probably start with just testing people who are showing symptoms... THAT’S not even happening in the U.S. yet. Had a friend who came down with a fever of 103 in addition to other symptoms and couldn’t even get tested for COVID-19.

It’s fucking ridiculous."
berkeley,fo3xhdn,t1_fo3t6je,1587494607.0,"Have a friend who says their professor got an email confirming that classes will be online next semester. He said that students should receive an official email regarding the issue soon. Not sure how credible this is, but just as a potential heads up."

CoronavirusCA,fnfzwtv,t1_fnebiwx,1586919103.0,"We are most likely hitting the peak within the next couple of days. [These graphs](https://www.kcra.com/app/coronavirus-in-california-tracking-covid-19-curve-of-cases-deaths/32101474) indicate that there were 74 CA deaths on April 13 (yesterday), so maybe the IHME peak predictions are taking that into account without displaying the data?"
