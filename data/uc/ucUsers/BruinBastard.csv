I've yet to see a jogger wearing a mask, but at least they're usually alone. Usually."
ucla,foyv4ua,t1_foxkutn,1588179742.0,"I suspect that the situation isn't that different on the ASUCLA side of things. Events and clubs don't need funding, but there are still salaries, stipends, and other operating expenses to pay. The broader organization wasn't doing well financially even before the pandemic, so I doubt they're going to be in a position to cut back any of the quarterly fees that keep them afloat.

Not saying that it's right, just the way it is. It's not like the ASUCLA/USAC/etc complex has shown a great deal of sensitivity toward the present circumstances to begin with."
ucla,fo9w9r1,t1_fo9s5ba,1587633171.0,They respond to criticism in the same way too.
ucla,fo4j5p6,t1_fo1olbg,1587505377.0,"Shame that the article (while otherwise well-written) didn't mention the alleged directive from someone on the council to brigade this sub and bury USAC threads. In my opinion, attempting to silence critics goes beyond ""unprofessional"" and well into ""corrupt"" territory."
ucla,fnk6sfr,t1_fnj7p0g,1587016687.0,"They probably don't anticipate that outcome.
 2016's Social Justice Referendum was even larger than CUB ($25/qtr) and it passed... because the campaign for the referendum pretty much ignored election regulations. Sanctions were issued and also ignored. Election board didn't do shit."
ucla,fnbknby,t3_g0ryp4,1586817219.0,"It will probably be abysmal, even compared to the usual turnout, because most of the student body isn't physically on campus.

Upside to this, though, is that campaigners won't be able to corner people on Bruin Walk and guilt trip them into voting for fee increases."
ucla,fn9fgbl,t3_g0cq5r,1586770919.0,As opposed to what?
ucla,fn1471w,t3_fyoss4,1586554454.0,"Please do not take this in any way as a defense of USC, but I'd like to point out that USC has taken less money from me than USAC."
ucla,fn11qwe,t1_fmx8uuv,1586553056.0,"Clearly one dude wasn't enough. Maybe there needs to be a ""Sack USAC"" slate."
ucla,fk3f0o6,t1_fk3dv0w,1583830293.0,What if we call it the University of Gene-ix?
