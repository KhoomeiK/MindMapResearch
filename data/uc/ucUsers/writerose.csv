cat,fn91w09,t1_fn8du8b,1586756708.0,"I call mine a part-time angel and part-time demon because he is a little terror. Always in something, knocking something over, and going after birds. He also looooves cuddles and he needs to be held like a baby on his back for at least thirty minutes daily. He also demands cuddles between naps. Earlier my mom couldn’t warm up and he laid with her for about twenty minutes and warmed her up then went back to bird hunting."

UCSD,flt02dt,t3_fqbre6,1585455324.0,I just moved back up to Northern California since this is my last quarter. No issues. U-Haul trailer and everything. Gas stations were open. Stayed in a hotel (wiped everything down as soon as I checked in). Just try to be quick about it. That was my biggest concern with the move. Packed and moved over four days.
