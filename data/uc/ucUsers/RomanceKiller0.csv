I’m so sorry you’re going through that, one of the comments above said to pull them aside and talk to them, I agree with them, it’s the only way you might get through to them tbh."

UCSD,fnrleam,t1_fndh2ob,1587192700.0,"First of all I am a woman and recommending this so maybe don’t judge on usernames because they don’t mean anything. Second of all I have walked at night many times and you’ll be relatively fine. As a woman be careful, have pepper spray, be careful walking to your car, same shit most women do on a daily basis. So maybe think before you post shit and judge based on knowing nothing."
UCSD,fnde463,t3_g11ojp,1586867704.0,I’d just move off campus and find parking after if you go to Regents or Gliderport you’ll get parking it’s just a walk.
UCSD,fmow2ny,t3_fw6bxb,1586269613.0,"There are colleges considering putting fall quarter online no joke my sister’s middle school is tentative on having an in person fall semester, summer session is definitely online. They’re not saying it yet but a few weeks ago everyone was saying only the first two weeks of spring quarter would be online like summer is online even if they haven’t said it yet. This virus is not going to lift up just given how second outbreaks are going worldwide until at least August, and that’s assuming that the world coordinates in terms of outbreaks and plateaus which we currently are not. Like China plateaus while the US hasn’t hit the worst of it yet and then they close borders because there was a second outbreak. Anyway I wouldn’t hold out hope for summer."
UCSD,fmovi52,t3_fwfiwd,1586269290.0,"Honestly my reading has sort of been insane and I’m in week 1, my math and Econ classes are relatively normal but PS like wtf. Also I find it easier to get distracted at home hands down."

UCSD,fmov6gp,t3_fw9f8r,1586269107.0,"Dude I feel for you, I straight up was like we’re paying for rent anyway I’m staying down here and basically was like I could have covid I don’t want to risk bringing it back blah blah, I was hardcore about not coming home. Love my family but coming in at all hours the lack of privacy, interrupting me for no reason just kills me, I’m lacking motivation as it is lmao no interest in repeating HS. I feel for you bruh, try putting a sign on your door if you can and wearing noise cancelling earbuds or worst case just work wierd hours."
UCSD,fmoup4h,t3_fw7kav,1586268837.0,"No I mean I’m Poli Sci/Econ but dude what is with my reading, like I’m in week 1 and I’m being assigned 100+ per lecture per class im taking four classes and I’m already behind that’s 200 a week around x3 I’m not joking, like around midterms generally they amp up the reading but during week 1? And then I’m taking a math class and that’s relatively ok but on top of 600 pages a week during week 1 like fuck what is week 5 going to be like? It’s like the profs don’t care."
