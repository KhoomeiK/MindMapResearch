I know you asked this question because you want honest good advice, but you know the black and white answer which is to say no. You wouldn’t even ask if you weren’t struggling due to the fact that it’s your parents. Some parents suck, others are angels, and then parents like mine do the best they can with what they have. Everyone is saying “there’s a reason they can’t get a home on their own”. I don’t know anything about you but I’m pretty sure I’ll be able to buy a home before my parents, and that’s because I was raised on the internet and their mistakes so I know the value of credit. My parents did not, both of them raised themselves and did pretty damn well for no one teaching them anything about money. I know my parents would love to own a home, at least my dad. Think it’s a dream of theirs, and I can’t  say given your circumstances I’d buy them one but I can say it’d be difficult to decided. I hope  you and your parents can come to a resolution good enough for everyone !"

UCSC,fnt19rx,t1_fnrt9s8,1587232693.0,"Probably but the lease ends February 31st, and then you can extend for like 2 months and it’s 10,000 a month (not including utilities ). And you MUST be chill, looking for someone who just sits there and is chill and clean and fun but also I’m never there. Must be social and introverted. Also, every month of rent is due upfront. (Plus deposit)

Oh yeah, must move in by May 1st because even though you have no clue whether you need to be in Santa Cruz, this is all that will be available."

UCSC,fnppw9l,t1_fnpp2a5,1587149827.0,"I really agree with you, funny you commented this I put a way smaller version of this on someone else's post. I said it might be optional, but I couldn't articulate the reasoning lol"
UCSC,fnpohb5,t3_g37ino,1587149104.0,"they only way I see them doing this is if the order is lifted and to ""encourage"" social distancing they;ll make things optional for a quarter, but still have those who choose to continue online pay the whole fees. if they made it optional, may look good for them because they'd look like they ""care"" enough to accommodate those who are skeptical of returning. but I highly doubt this scenario will happen because of things like testing, labs, & research. if some had in person classes while other don't there may be disporportionate results in grades"
personalfinance,fnplj42,t3_g3521q,1587147614.0,"look on IRS website as well, I am pretty sure there's a form to contest the fact that someone else claimed you. when you say filed taxes for you, you mean she filed her tax return and claimed you or she literally filed a tax return with your information?"
UCSC,fnpkkiw,t3_g375hy,1587147130.0,no but it's killing me that no else has either because I had a hold on my account last week and I completed the todo but it still says there's a hold so im scared I won't get my aid if the hold isn't taken off soon
personalfinance,fnpaw0a,t3_g2wsub,1587142286.0,"Take the 10% now, and know when this ""over"" you are also WORTH that additional 7.5% so ask for that as well."
UCSC,fnpa2a8,t1_fnp9b6d,1587141870.0,"RIGHT, like my office said even if the order is lifted our boss wants to stay on remote work for a least a month or two after to ensure we are not put at risk just because of policy change. the thing about that is, working from home has somehow allow our company to do pretty well despite the changes so we have that privilege of staying home ""just in case"". I feel like the school could do the same and say hey, rest easy everyone fall quarter will be online so stop tripping. like no matter what the policy is we'll stay online for that quarter. but that's idealistic, the fact is that isn't profitable to them or beneficial. not to mention, many students who don't have the luxury I do of being able to stand my family really want to return to school. or they don't like online learning. idk I feel better now that I've talked this out with 4 strangers on the inter webs .."
UCSC,fnp7efs,t1_fnp4wo5,1587140522.0,"yeah, I feel really really guilty for wanting it be online because we still pay a grip of money to be just online school but I have a great job that plans on having us continuing to work remotely even if shelter-in-place order is lifted, and I don't pay rent. at this point I felt like it was a sign to just transfer to my state school. I also feel really bad because wishing for school to be online feels wrong when so many people are suffering, and I'm just taking a small hit like losing one job out the 2 I have."
