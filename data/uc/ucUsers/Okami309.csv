publichealth,fp8ratw,t3_gbwcir,1588400416.0,"What helped me with my personal statement is thinking, ""Why am I going into PH and not any other field?"" (My personal statements also had some prompts I had to answer too.) For me personally, this was an easy answer. I also came up with, ""What do I hate about the system and why should I advocate for change?"" Colleges LOVE activism.

In terms of a resume, I created an academic CV. I have absolutely no formal research experience (only secondary analysis papers), no legit published papers, and 1 award. This was a huge risk for me because I had so much self-doubt about not having much research experience. My undergrad didn't have any PH opportunities because hardly any of the professors wanted to open up their research to anyone, especially undergrads.

I hope this helps!"
UCSD,fol53ao,t1_fokxure,1587855050.0,"Ah, I have no idea what the pros and cons are for undergrad CEPH vs non CEPH."
UCSD,fokxgkl,t1_fokwlv5,1587850799.0,"Unfortunately no. They never replied to my email. I accepted enrollment at UCI, CEPH accredited"
AnimalCrossing,fo07nya,t1_fo06yg9,1587407511.0,"Yep. I may be wrong but from personal experience, I think you will for sure have a Lazy Villager in the starting 10 villagers."
AnimalCrossing,fo058fn,t1_fo04qxr,1587406299.0,"If possible, think about it in sections. That's what I'm doin with my island. For example: what do I want to do with the museum?

1) a grand entrance of double staircases so that it's uniform and not off by 1 space.
2)a big plaza that can show off a completed fossil. 
3)maybe a waterfall to the side of it to practice different terraforming techniques

I hope this helps :)"
AnimalCrossing,fo04nxq,t1_fo04kvg,1587406012.0,Nope. Only uchi and jocks can be the starting villagers.
AnimalCrossing,fnv0n14,t1_fnv03gd,1587276450.0,"Overall animal crossing is meant to be a simple game. There are no true, traditional objectives like other games. The only objective is the beginning week of ""tutorial/story"" and play how you want to play.

I will say that as a veteran of the entire AC series, I dont think this game has a good tutorial. The game doesnt teach you how to use equipment like in the last game. It's still pretty easy to understand but the nuances may be more understood by veterans."
AnimalCrossing,fnu5s4h,t1_fnu56ej,1587255105.0,"30th day of active play is not the same as Nook's Cranny being open for 30 days. If you've played everyday since release, you should be getting it within the next week."
AnimalCrossing,fnu03b7,t1_fntzf26,1587251911.0,"Not really. Over the years people have developed favorites of certain villagers. There are a couple ""unique"" characters. Like Kiki for example is a black cat and is a reference to Kiki's Delivery Service (Studio Ghibli). There's also Audie who is a brand new character created after a grandmother who racked up over 4000 hours in New Leaf."
AnimalCrossing,fnt9snx,t1_fnt9hly,1587237385.0,The only weather effects are rain/snowing. Some critters only come out during rain and snow.
AnimalCrossing,fnt8f6t,t1_fnt8046,1587236615.0,I saw a post with 3 special visitors in one day. I think it's pretty random/RNG based. I have KK today but so far no special visitor. I'll have to see at 7pm. I'm sure they can still spawn despite KK's presence tho.
AnimalCrossing,fnt714n,t1_fnt6mah,1587235845.0,I have as well. We should be getting it within the next week.
AnimalCrossing,fnt6icz,t1_fnt689t,1587235557.0,"No. Nook cranny, the shop itself. The day after you placed the lot is considered the 1st day it's open. It doesnt have a milestone."
AnimalCrossing,fnt65xc,t1_fnt5wmf,1587235366.0,Nook cranny needs to be open for 30 days. It's not just your active days alone.
AnimalCrossing,fnt5jic,t1_fnt550i,1587235023.0,Coconuts are in the game and can be found on mystery island tours.
UCI,fnluq6v,t3_g24adz,1587060059.0,I used a blank amiibo card just for Antonio so that I can rep UCI. I didn't even know he existed before this game. He is now one of my favorite Jocks.
AnimalCrossing,fnf3v48,t1_fnf3qui,1586900920.0,"As long as it's an amiibo card, it should work."
AnimalCrossing,fnf3kym,t1_fnf30t5,1586900772.0,Make sure you put down furniture and fencing. What worked for me was at least 1 piece of furniture on all 3 levels of my island. Also make sure you have the 3 villagers moved in.
AnimalCrossing,fkopbaq,t3_fiqscd,1584392127.0,My absolute favorite villager Bob! I'm hoping to get him on my island even if I need to use an Amiibo card!!
