berkeley,fpd18io,t3_gcqs1f,1588517648.0,"Dont give up! I don't think the project is terrible having finished it about a week ago. While I think the benchmark is a little high, I don't think its hard to attain only using pragma and SIMD. I'm at 39.99 something and I'm not gonna bother with that 0.0001 marks. 

There are a lot of things you can optimise that WILL boost your score performance by a lot. **I highly recommend writing a python script file that will compare your solution and Dumbpy so you don't rely on the AG.** I was personally testing it A LOT before I even submitted to the AG. 

Some tips: 

1. SIMD everywhere you can. Figure out smart ways to compute absolute/neg (add/sub is easy). Unroll it a couple times as well (too much is too slow tho). 
2. Add pragma where-ever you can
3. Power is a little tricky but I recommend doing some research. When my matmul was 1x (naive), I had my power at 60x just purely based on the algorithm design. So when I improved mul to \~90x, my power automatically hit 2000x benchmark
4. Mat-mul is the bottleneck here. There are crazy ways to do Mat-mul which will speed it up. Look up Strassen's algorithm if you want to reduce your runtime from O(n\^3) to O(n\^2.58) but I didn't use it and can hit the benchmark. I admit I have no clue how people got up to 150x but you can get 95x easily. The hint I will give you is that you may be thinking it's impossible to SIMD mat-mul but its possible -- you just need to convert your matrix somehow that allows you to do so 

Hope it helps! Good luck :)"
berkeley,fp7ie22,t1_fp7cvvp,1588371195.0,"Yeah Babak is awesome. Best class I've taken in Cal so far. On the course catalog it doesn't seem like he's teaching next spring but Jaijeet is great as well. 

The transition was fine, though a small jump is needed in the beginning but he really teaches you everything from scratch."
berkeley,fp79ili,t3_gbovyg,1588366485.0,"EE120 has the lowest workload of all class with Babak. I expect the same with Jaijeet (and hes an awesome professor from 16b) next semester since he shadowed Babak's teaching this semester before we went online. 

We had 9 homeworks this semester, 2 optional, 2 hw drops (became 3 cause of covid). 6 Ipython labs with 2 drops (became 3 from Covid). Homework takes like maximum 3 hours and maybe a lot longer in the later ones which is a lot harder but you can just drop those or Piazza/OH is VERY helpful

There is no final exam with Babak, though might be different with Jaijeet. 3 midterms which is emphasized on stuff that is Post MT-X stuff. I just had my midterm 3 yesterday and no stuff from Midterm 1 or 2 was assessed explicitly though you still needed to know what it is and when you use it. 

Overall if you have a chance to take with Babak, do so -- he is amazing at EE120"
berkeley,fp3y5qp,t3_gb6g1v,1588288003.0,"You'll get in cause your enrollment priority goes up as your semester at Cal increases so I don't see any issue. 

Note don't get scared of 16B from 16A. Only the circuit module of 16A is used in the 1st module of 16B before it changes to Controls and Learning (PCA/Data Interpolation stuff). I think its a great class, much more interesting than 16A"
berkeley,fp3l7kn,t3_gb4de9,1588281260.0,Most CS lower divs expand to meet the capacity so you dont have to worry about it.
berkeley,foxc4yq,t1_foxc0sz,1588139600.0,"I'm in 170 right now. While I struggle in the class due tor reasons not relating at all to 70 (I just like EE more ngl), the only 70 thing you'll need is induction and maybe knowing how to formulate/arrive to proofs. Its 61B but with heavier maths."
berkeley,foxbeov,t3_ga33a7,1588139008.0,"Push through!!. Just realize that we're all good at different things. Everyone feels the same way about CS70. People who got A's in them also tell me its the hardest class they've ever taken and is 10x harder than CS170. 

CS70 is in no way indicative of how you will do in CS major. If you're not into CS theory or ML route, a typical Software Engineering route of 162,164,168,186 will never use any material from CS70 ever again and you'll graduate with a minimum of 100k. Keep your hopes up!! Don't give up now!! 

If it makes you feel better, I got a B in it and it has no way affected my ability to do well in other CS classes like 61C or 170."
berkeley,fovdvkw,t1_fovbyvu,1588099673.0,Yeah then take 70 + 61C. 61C is a lotta grindy work that isn't necessarily hard. The fact that you brought it back in module 2 for 16A means you're strong in circuits which can help a bit in 61C
berkeley,fovbheh,t3_g9s61l,1588098538.0,"What do you wanna do? 

1. If you like 16A and wanna pursue EE, take 16B + 70 so you can take EE105, EE120 the next semesters.
2. If you're really into CS and wanna do SWE in the future, take 61C and 70 so you can take the CS160's in the upperdivs faster + Dan's Teaching"
berkeley,fotrsc0,t3_g9ir52,1588063819.0,"Astro10, Data8/100, CS70. Idk about Ling100

berkeley,fosfjlc,t3_g9bnz6,1588029718.0,"1. Relax! Don't be scared to pursue something you applied for. I assume you must like it to some extent or you wouldn't apply to it in the first place. Also its like April? You have like 3 months to relax for now. 
2. You don't need to take summer courses if you dont want to. I came in CoE only waiving only Math 1A/B from IB Math HL. Basically everyone else had all H/SS waived and like 100+ units or sth. I think it is better if you spend time getting used to your surroundings or take it chill the first year. When you see all the freshmans go recruiting and stuff, dont feel panicked to do so. Very rarely do freshmans get internships BUT it is still good practice just to go to career fairs to see what the jist is like or just surverying around. 
3. Very few people follow the schedule exactly as there are several factors you wanna consider (1st semester you can follow but a lot of people diverge from there)
   1. The friends you will be taking it with. If I'm gonna take a hard class, I wanna take it with friends and not suffer by myself.
   2. You probably won't even get into every class of your first choice. Enrollment is a lottery system here as far as I know and some classes that aren't CS don't expand
      1. Look beyond the course list too! There are a lot of amazing classes here you can take that isn't listed like AstroC10, Data8, Data100, CogSci1, etc. 

TLDR: Ideally A lot of people do 61A/16A  + 2 easy class. The classes are huge so you can def make a lot of friends. After that go with the flow and take classes with your friends together and explore a little big outside of EECS classes as well -- no one I know constantly takes 4 techs of CS every semester and a lot of the good schedules have 2-3 techs + 1-2 interesting humanities the person is interested in, that way you meet people outside your major too."
berkeley,fopnps8,t1_fop6tun,1587966523.0,Its a new mechE class where they recently combined E25 and E27 together to be 4 units. I think it was just annouced like 2 days ago?
berkeley,fopmtjk,t3_g8pqve,1587965785.0,"You can always find your own ""place"" and friend group here very easily. The easiest way is to join a club of your interest -- that way you're literally surrounded by people who have the same interest as you whether you geek it out in a CS club or you're just casually playing volleyball in RSF. 

Also, don't be scared of being friends who party a lot. I definitely don't party as much as my friends even though they invite me (I just decline about 9/10 times). It's not like you cant be friends with them or anything, you just tell them you're not that type of person and they'll usually respect your decision and invite you to something you're more comfortable with (board games, kickback dinners, socials, etc)."

berkeley,foplgw7,t3_g8t5v8,1587964682.0,"I am currently taking ee120, cs170 and cs61c. Id say CS61C has roughly the same workload or more than 127 but 127 is conceptually more challenging (haven't taken but I've heard and will take next semester).

EE120 with Babak has almost no workload. This semester we had 9 homeworks in total, 2 optional, and 2 drops (now 3 cause of corona), no labs and 6 iPython labs which we have 1 drop (now 2 cause of corona) and each iPython takes no more than 2-3 hours. Jaijeet is teaching next semester and he has been shadowing Babak this semester before we went virtual. My housemate loves Jaijeet when he taught 16B in Sp19 and I think Jaijeet won't deviate that much from what Babak does this semester so I'd say definitely take it.

170 is an 8-10 hour workload for homework or maybe higher or lower depending on your skills in Math. Its not a ""heavy"" workload class where theres labs and stuff but the homeworks are hard and weekly. Project at the end is 5% so, its practically nothing.

127 is also similar to 170 where theres weekly homework and iPython labs that is due every week and is hard as well. But theres nothing more to it.

162 you need a group going in and theres homework AND a semester long worth of projects hearing from my friends this semester. They also have 3 midterms instead of a final.

I'd go with the first plan so you have time to prep for interviews. Your second plan also works if you have a group for 162 and you're only take 162 and 170 as your techs and nothing else."
berkeley,fo5we1g,t1_fo5oyaj,1587537881.0,"This is **very true** from my experience, especially bullet point 3. If you are able to explain/teach a concept to a friend such that they understand it, that means you FULLY understand it and can apply in many different ways they test you. 

My first Semester at Cal I ended up with a 2.8 GPA in Engineering. Once I figured out how to study, what I did wrong, etc. my GPA skyrocketed with 3.75 in back to back semester taking 3-4 techs and now I'm sitting at around 3.5 ish.   

I understand GPA matters a lot in Haas but you can use my example -- it is possible to still claw your way back."
berkeley,fo0rklr,t1_fo0jr6i,1587418452.0,"Lmao true. Apart from the timing, the contents of the notes are very clear and concise and pretty much what he taught in lecture. Now that he has released them, anyone can access them in future semesters so it's not a problem for future students."
berkeley,fnzv3i7,t3_g4tnqw,1587401271.0,"Just take the class. I heard Lustig was amazing for 61C when he taught it with Dan so thats a positive. If you're really struggling I heard the notes this semester by Arcak are very good so just read those. Personally I thought Sahai's notes were very good as well when I took it in Fa19. 

Regarding grading, yeah 16B is kinda in the dark about curving vs no curving but Sahai chopped the exam value and didn't shift the bins -- basically precurving the exam before hand so it was pretty clear where you were at. Exams vary for people but I thought Sahai's exams were fair (except Midterm 2 last question) and this semester's is slightly harder than usual."

berkeley,fnca7rl,t3_g0v0ip,1586831995.0,"Hey there! I was actually in exactly the same position as you were as an international. I was deciding between MEng Imperial and MEng Berkeley (before I switched to EECS) before I committed to Cal. 

Based on your replies, I would like to also reiterate that there is **no difference between EECS and L&S CS.** Like 0 difference in terms of classes. The only difference is you won't need some math/physics classes and instead you have 7 breadths in L&S to fulfill. Job prospect also has 0 DIFFERENCE. The average salary difference between EECS and CS is literally 1000 dollars a year difference -- thats 83 dollars difference a month, which is nothing. 

I think you need to weigh in whether your parents has the money saved up and ready to pay for your education in Cal. If your parents do, I think its 100% worth it to come to Cal. You can learn money here as an international **VERY easily** as well by taking up different part time jobs around campus. You just need to apply for an SSN and that literally takes maximum 1 day. Jobs include: 

1. **Being on course staff for classes you excelled in.** The beauty of EE/CS classes is that all the TAs are basically undergraduates just like you. If you got an A/A-/B+ in the class, apply to be a lab-assistant/reader/TA. Readers are paid 16 dollars/hr for 8 hr/week, lab-assistants are paid 18\~19 dollars/hr for 8-10 hr/week. TA's are paid 25-26 dollars/hr for 8 or 20 hr/week. Heck, if you go for a 20-hr TA, part of the money goes to reimburse your tuition automatically by law. 
2. Some of my friends do **security monitoring**. Thats like 9 pm - 3 am for 15 dollars/hr and its a quick way to get cash without actually doing much (you just make sure people tap their cards and etc.) I don't like this cause 3 am is a pain to get back to the dorms. 
3. You can work in **libraries** for 15 dollars/hr too
4. **Undergraduate research assitant**. Sometimes labs pay students to help their work/process data or whatever. It's a great way for you to get into research as well. 

I'm on course staff for EE16A/B and i earn about \~700 dollars/month working 16 hrs/wk post tax (yes we get taxed too) and thats more than enough per month for living costs and groceries. I just pay for tuition + rent. 

I have a couple friend at Imperial and these are the biggest difference between UK and US universities in general:

1. US is focused on practicality while UK is more theoretical. Particularly when it comes to engineering/cs, US is **A LOT more hands on**. Every CS/EE class you are required to take here have labs, 3-4 projects that forces you to create/apply what you learned in lecture/discussions to a HUGE project from scratch. You will experience this in 61A/B/C. UK friends doing CS/Engineering basically is learn, test, repeat. You don't really create anything substantial or apply the knowledge you learnt in class into creating something and I think **practicality is 100% more valuable and important than theories.** 
2. You never know what you like. I thought liked MEng and after 1 semester at Cal I knew it wasn't for me. I would have been fucked if I went to Imperial. If you commit to Imperial, **MEng IS your major,** theres no changing if you don't like it. US has a lot more flexibility. You dont like CS? Try out data science. If you like CS and have more time? Add a minor or do a double major in econ/datasci/whatever you like. Cal allows **unless possibilities and flexibility** for what you like you won't find in the UK. 
3. Job prospects outside the UK is definitely not as good as the US. After you finish your 4 year masters in MEng, you're more likely to end up working as a researcher as your full time job than to work at a big tech company or a start up in the UK. If you go to Cal, Silicon Valley is right there. SF is right there. You can leave undergraduate straight to work in CS with an average starting salary of around 110,000\~120,000/yr + bonuses (150,000/yr if you're super good and in a big company) without actually completing your Masters and **a lot of people do this.** You have ENDLESS intern opportunities and job opportunities if you come to Cal. The career fairs are filled with big companies and small start ups that want Cal students to work for them -- not a lot of schools have this privilege  

**So TLDR, yes Cal is worth it.** The 41k you save over 4 years you can re-earn in 1 year working as SWE in Silicon valley. It's like investing for the long-run. You are paying for world-class education, to meet world-class ultra talented students, and for you as a student to grow and get challenged. The fact that you got into Imperial AND Cal tells me you're probably top 2 in your high-school class. You will now be surrounded by people of the same level of talent OR even better who will push you to become even better. 

Yeah this was longer than I intended but PM me if u have other questions"
berkeley,fn7ryhq,t1_fn6s71h,1586726426.0,Sure
berkeley,fn5ztgv,t3_fzqudl,1586681900.0,"Varies across people. Are you asking because you need to declare? Just my opinion: 

**70** \- People with competitive math experience (AMC, etc.) will find this class average - slightly challenging. The thing with this class is that 80% of the people don't understand jack (I was one of them). You just need to be better than ""I dont really understand anything"" to ""I sorta understand"" and you're on your way to an A-/A. I found this class super hard cause I never had the opportunity to compete in math competitions in highschool and the material was super new. I also shot myself in the head taking 16b, 70, 61b **(DO NOT DO THIS)** in the fall so towards the end, I definitely gassed out.

The curve is, however, SUPER generous. Till this day I have no clue how I got a B with average on 2 midterms and a -0.8 sd on a 40% final (what gassing out looks like for a 7-10 Friday final exam). Like that is beyond generous in my opinion

**16B** \- Prolly my favourite class in Cal cause I like EE but I'll speak for my close CS friends who is taking rn (avoided Sahai and ditched me last semester). I found 16B to be super fun and interesting -- at least the way Sahai portrayed it. I can break it down to 3 types of people in 16B from my experience:

1. **Just took 54 and never took 16A** (with/without strong background in EE doesn't matter): It will feel extremely fast, painful, and you're already behind. My housemate did this and even prestudied 16A module 2 to get ahead and got lost with 3 lectures. At one point he asked me to help him catch up 4-5 lectures before midterm 1. He was lost to the point where he didn't know how to spell ""phasors"" LOL. Homeworks 1-5 will make absolutely no sense since they expect you to know op-amps and nodal analysis from the get go. Please take 16A just to save yourself from insane pain in 16B. Whoever said you only need 54 in 16B clearly hasn't taken 16B or is a super strong student in general. 
2. **Took 16A and absolutely bombed Module 2 but did well in Module 1.** You will struggle in Module 1 and it will get better in Module 2 and 3. Module 1 builds on top of just basic nodal analysis and you won't see Thevenin/Norton or some complicated circuitry that you saw in 16A. It's basic LRC circuits with a purpose + some linear algebra applications onto circuits. Might be hard, but doable. Module 2 and 3 doesn't really deal with circuits that much but more of discrete-time stuff but the state-space models still applies and its more geared towards linear algebra applications. 
3. **Took 16A and did good but doesn't like the class.** You will be completely fine. You might hate it too, but you will still get your A and never think about EE again for the rest of your life. It's just one class just push through it."
berkeley,fn524eb,t1_fn4wazy,1586654117.0,"Its really not bad you can take like

1. Math 53/54, Physics 7A, some H/SS class, 61A
2. Math 53/54, Physics 7B, EE16A, some H/SS class

Math 53/54 is required in both MechE and EECS so you'll still be hitting the 2 tech requirement from the MechE side. Math 54 isn't for eecs, but you can use it to waive the natural science requirement. Registering for EECS class is simple easy, everyone is let in basically for 16A/61A so use phase 1 on your math/physics classes."

berkeley,fn1b68c,t1_fmzjuju,1586558421.0,"Taking it as an only tech is a great idea. You can even read the notes ahead of time because the notes/content doesnt change on the website. I think the key to an A- in CS70 is to understand the material enough such that you can derive the notes yourself.

The weekly breakdown isn't much -- Just attend/watch lectures and read the notes and go to discussion. It's the homework that takes up SO much time if you're struggling with the material.  

CSM sessions for CS70 are incredibly useful for practice questions and conceptual review as well."
berkeley,fmzhw2c,t3_fycnbp,1586520907.0,"**For workload:** Kinda don't want to give a rating really because I know 16A/B can be huge workloads for students who hate EE. I mean I have friends who got As in 61A/B/C/70/170 and spend 12 hours on a 16B homework scratching their heads. As for my background/interests, I like EE > CS so it might be biased: 

Hilfinger's 61b >> 70 >= 61C (equal workload for both iterations now)  >> 16B >= EE16A 

\*Note if you take Sahai's iteration of 16B/70, you would move 16B to the highest workload between all of these classes (not even close -- 20 hr homework minimum)

**Conceptual difficulty:** Again, if truly despise EE, you would put EE16A/B in front of all these CS classes. I think: 

CS 70 >>>>> CS 61c >= CS 61b = EE16B >= EE 16A > 

For someone who hate EE: 16B >>>> 16A >>>> 70 > 61C > 61B 

**Overall difficulty: (factoring in grade distributions)** \-- I think CS70 has one of the most generous curves out of all of these classes. So I dont think it is the most difficult. I think: 

EE16B = CS70 >= CS 61c = EE16A > CS 61b

It is super hard for people to score an A in 16A/B in general when its not curved, the content is super hard, and more than half the students don't understand whatsoever. I think 61B is the easiest to score under Hilfinger. Easy-medium conceptual difficulty, easy bins, literally 50% project grade, don't need final for an A if you're an above average student."
berkeley,fmvffhj,t1_fmm9gx8,1586415114.0,Hey there! I'm EECS (also the same as L&S CS) but my housemates are international L&S CS majors so I can forward the questions for you if you want. PM me!
berkeley,fmvf0uw,t3_fxm34k,1586414728.0,"I was MechE before I switched over to EECS too without any prior coding knowledge whatsoever (didn't know what terminal was). 

Theres enough resources for you to succeed in 61A (the 1st CS intro class) and likewise for 61B and CS70. I don't think you need to start ahead but in this pandemic, sure why not? It'll even give you a glimpse of the CS life and whether you like it. 

During the semester: **CSM is probably the best resource** \-- It's a bunch of current students who took and love the course in the past, got a good score, and likes to teach/help. It's free, it's awesome and the tutors really care about you and your learning. 

A quick note though -- 61A/B will be a great indicator whether you would want to pursue CS further in the major. If you find yourself struggling and do not like 61A/B whatsoever, please don't force yourself to hit the 3.3 and declare the major. I feel like too many people get trapped into this and then suffer tremendously in the upper divs. You know yourself and adapt -- data science or cognitive science is a great alternative to look into as well (don't confine to just ""I only want CS"" -- explore!)"
berkeley,fmrkycg,t3_fx0ipv,1586326416.0,"To succeed in a lot of the high-concept classes (a lot of which may be new and challenging), you need to be able to read the homework/question and reduce the problem down to something you have seen before. Especially in 16A where its high-paced (and a lot of you guys hate circuits), its especially important that you see a question and you go ""Thats a voltage divider"" or ""I need an inverting op-amp here"" 

CSM definitely help you see additionally problems for you to practice but everything in module 2 really boils down to the circuit cookbook in one of the discussion sections. There is literally nothing more to that in Module 2 apart from a small thing about capacitors you need to know. If you can derive the circuit cookbook, you can solve any circuit question in 16A. 

I think I posted somewhere in this subreddit before midterm 2 where someone had no clue about Module 2 and I summarised it in about 6 sentences. If you can get to that level, you know for sure you understood everything because you can reduce everything down to really the basic fundamentals."

Also 2000+ students in 61A doesn't mean theres no access to resources -- theres a ton of OH available, tons of TA to ask, tons of students to ask for help and you'll definitely can succeed. I did 61A without any prior coding experience whatsoever and still did very well. 

An Ivy league school doesn't really help when you go into a job/industry that much. Maybe you'll have slightly higher resume -> interview turnout ratio but that really doesn't matter as you still have to pass the technical interview"
berkeley,fmqrl4v,t1_fmqoz12,1586305544.0,61C workload <= 61b hilfinger in my opinion although some might disagree because they seriously hate hardware (I like it lol). It really depends on your love/hate on hardware but i would say its equal leaning either way (not by much) depending on your familiarity in hardware
berkeley,fmqigf2,t3_fwu306,1586300241.0,"I just recommend picking 1 out of the 3 to take in the summer. All 3 classes have insanely high workload which requires a tremendous amount of understanding (especially at 2x speed). The math wouldn't help that much except a little in 16B in terms of linear algebra.

I really feel you definitely need a study group in cs70 in order to do well. If you're not in a rush to declare, take in the semester with a bunch of your friends. In the long run, it is these friends who will help you and each other through the course. If you have some friends with you to take with in the summer, take it! 

If you've taken 16a, the supplement from math 54 is enough to get you off in a head start in 16B than most people. Most of the time the linear algebra taught in 16a isn't enough to support the level needed in 16b when combined with harder circuits or problems like SVD/PCA. 

61C is super fast even on a normal pace. If you've done C based languages before, you'll be fine. If you haven't you're expected to pick up C in 1 week. Labs and projects are a lot of work, but its more grindy work than difficult work like in CS70. 

I recommend 70 in the summer and 61C/16B in the semester if you have a study group for 70. If you don't, take 61C in the summer and take 70/16B in the semester and just learn some C before the summer begins (just some basic familiarity goes a long way in such a fast paced class)."
berkeley,fmq2lqu,t1_fmpu2lt,1586291736.0,Doable if you dont any other time-consuming techs alongside with it. Be sure to have a a study group for CS70 that is ready to go if you choose alongside with it.
berkeley,fmnxppj,t3_fwdpik,1586238425.0,"I think 16B has the no lab option for the first time in Fa19 (when I took it) and also in Sp20 right now. Sahai gave this option in Fa19 because of 2 reasons: 

1. The EECS department doesn't have enough big to support people to make the car. I don't know why, but in Fa19 we didn't have readers to grade our homework so our self-grades WERE our grades
2. CS people in senior year can take this option and not worry about lab and I guess worry about other things like jobs/recruiting

I still think the lab option is worth it. It gets you free marks and it's really fun if you have a decent group. You get to make a band-pass filter that lights up your LED to different music frequencies (stuff you see in the clubs). You also make a mic-board that captures your voice for the car which you will later use to record words and make your car respond to the words. You really get to see what you learned in action much more than 16A. 

But it's really up to you. I've never been a strong test taker and learnt more through projects/homework, so I always grab free marks on these things whenever I can."
berkeley,fmnllim,t3_fwc73a,1586228925.0,"I actually took 54 and 16A concurrently and I agree if you're shaky on linear algebra, 54 is MUCH MUCH better at explaining than the rushed version of 16A. I basically skipped lecture for 16A Module 1 and used 54 knowledge -- so I agree with you on 54 in the summer 

**If you take CS61C:**

Pros: 

1. Dan Garcia. That man's enthusiasm gets you fired up and to love CS. Everyone loves him. If you want a good experience, thats enough of a reason to take it over CS70
2. It's very very interesting if you like hardware. It's a different taste of what CS looks like. Basically, everything left in CS that you haven't learnt (hardware) -- I'm particularly biased for hardware so I like 61C 
3. This unlocks A LOT of the upper divs that you can take. You can pretty much take 162, 186, 161, etc. after this class 

Cons: 

1. Lots and lots of work. Labs are super long and take more than 2 hrs -- you should start before the lab section and just go for checkoff 
2. Can be challenging if you're not used to hardware.

**If you take CS70:** 

Pros: 

1. Great class for mathematical maturity. You don't need 16B at all to take CS70. It just builds you some mathematical intuition you'll need later if you wanna take 127/126/170 
2. I think it's an interesting class in general. Even though I didn't do well (got a B because I shot myself in the head taking 16B/61B/70 together), I still felt like I learnt a lot with interesting topics like secret sharing, distributions, etc. The curve is VERY generous. I got average on 2 MTs and got -0.8 in the final for a B. Wtf? 
3. Unlocks your ability to take 170 (although not that related -- 61B is more important than 170 but the math helps nevertheless), 126, 127, 189 if you're really into CS maths 

Cons: 

1. Extremely high workload -- even more than 61C I would say. Problems are super challenging and requires about 10-12 hrs a week for a problem set. If its with Sahai, expect it to be 20+ hrs
2. It's EXTREMELY fast. If you can't keep up in this class, you will struggle tremendously through the semester 
3. It is **extremely hard.** The point is that you need to understand that 90% of the people literally doesn't understand CS70 material. You just need to understand a little bit more than the average and thats a guaranteed A-/A in the class. 
4. Kinda requires you to have some sort of study group to help each other in homework. Not a single person I know survived CS70 without help from a friend at one point. It's practically impossible to survive this class on your own.  

A lot of my CS friends wait out 61c cause they hate hardware but I don't think its really that bad. Plus if youre going into SWE industry, you'll need the 160's anyways. Technically if you're really wanting to take 170, you don't need 70 cause it's not really connected. View 170 as 61B but with maths and proofs. You'll learn Kruskal's, Prim's, DFS, etc again but with more rigor of why runtimes are the way it is."
berkeley,fmjm1y7,t3_fvlm2k,1586133046.0,"From my experience in 16a (I got a good score), the key is to use what you know or have seen. You actually haven't learnt that many circuit elements to use for design questions or to draw out a circuit from a problem statement. You also know 1 circuit analysis technique so use it! For example: 

1. If you want to increase your voltage, use an non-inverting amplifier
2. If you want to negate your voltage, use an inverting amplifier 
3. If you have 0 clue about a problem, theres a very high chance it's a voltage divider. 16A really likes voltage dividers. Like, really really REALLY like it. 
4. Multiple components connected together? Use a buffer! If you have unlimited op-amps to use, stick a buffer in between every single element just in case.  
5. Sum voltages? Voltage summer 

Design questions don't go beyond this and its usually a combination of these instead of 1 single thing (or it's too easy). Usually you can pick R values to make your life easy (pick like 1 ohm please)

As for questions that are more mechanical like complicated negative feedback op-amps or complicated circuits in parallel, dependant sources or etc, use the nodal analysis technique -- always works. So start with KCL, literally label every current going into an element with i\_x. Then convert it to a V-R relationship. Then solve for what you want."
