SantaBarbara,fpdewvq,t1_fpdc2cp,1588525645.0,"Exactly! One time I yielded to someone in the bike roundabout as usual & this person stopped IN THE ROUNDABOUT & YELLED AT ME TO GO.

Luckily there was no traffic otherwise they would have caused a crash. Still can't believe I got yelled at for following bike traffic rules"
UCSantaBarbara,fovg6fv,t3_g9rw4i,1588100766.0,"Depends on what part of AS, I would highly recommend joining one of the boards like CAB or ZWC (both have open applications rn)

I've heard senate is not very enjoyable but most of the boards I've been in and interact with are like tight knit clubs. The plus side is that ppl are pretty ambitious, get a lot of support from advisors & chairs on any projects, and get an honoraria

Please don't get discouraged by negative comments, AS has many boards/committees. Some get a lot done and others don't. Do your research and apply for a board/committee with a good history and goals that align with yours"

UCSantaBarbara,fobyf11,t3_g6q8mk,1587665073.0,For field specific scholarships a lot of depts have listservs and notify you of all kinds of internships and even jobs.

college,fnt4ydg,t3_g3s91o,1587234701.0,"Agreed, but we don't just need vaccines, we need antibody tests too so we know who already had it.

Once both are accessible, we will be able to move back to in person classes and work. My main worry is that many people might not be able to get it as soon as other people & we won't be able to return until a majority of ppl have gotten it."

I'm not too worried about tuition reductions bc I have financial aid but on campus fees shouldn't be billed for online terms. Also I usually support fees for collaborate printing and AS fees but if everything is shut down right now, why are they billing us?"

ABCDesis,fno2qqv,t1_fnnmvot,1587109926.0,"I'm actually from the south bay as well! I felt the same way in high school and the beginning of college. 

When I was a freshman in college I tried joining the south asian association because I was losing hope of finding friends. It was a huge mistake because there was a whole bunch of drama around 1 guy rejecting me & talking shit about me. It only got worse and I had no interest in the drama so I left. I felt like an outsider around them anyway.

Then, I coincidentally got close to another outsider in that group through an internship later in college. He turned out to be really great and felt the same way about indian drama lol. Now we've been dating almost 2yrs & it's going pretty well

So just wanted to say I felt the same way but kind of came around..."

LushCosmetics,fn4r093,t1_fn4for2,1586647098.0,That makes sense! I use more gentle shampoos for my dry scalp so maybe that's why it left a waxy residue
LushCosmetics,fn4qvhe,t3_fzib67,1586647020.0,"Same, I did not like superbalm at all. I only used it once and it felt a waxy residue on my roots.  I think my issue was that my shampoo (non lush product) was too gentle and I wash my hair with cold water bc hot water irritates my scalp.

When I washed my hair a day later with hot water and a lush soak and float shampoo bar, which has SLS, the residue came right off.

Honestly, it did a good job on my scalp but trying to remove the residue from my hair was harsh and made my dandruff worse

Next time, I'm going to try to thin it out by mixing it with a hair oil so it's not so waxy. Hopefully that won't leave a residue"
badroommates,fn1h1r1,t3_fyr0rz,1586561850.0,"This might sound harsh but it's not your job to worry about her financial situation, in fact it's none of your business what she does after you leave. You obviously don't want to be around her now and I assume you won't be her therapist/friend after you move out. She'll figure it out one way or another.

It seems like she doesn't really care about you. When was the last time she asked about your mental health or did something to reduce your stress? After you have a place locked down, I would just tell you will be moving out and take care of lease/utilities details. If you care about how she feels and her mental health avoid telling her you're moving because of her or about how you feel about her."
UCSantaBarbara,fn0dozt,t1_fn085no,1586540045.0,"Yeah, I agree. I believe it's easier to come here as a student than as a young professional because of visa stuff. It's pretty common for international students to come here for grad school"

Lush is makes good products but they are expensive! Look for small businesses on Instagram, etsy, farmer's markets (after corona virus blows over ofc)

I use Saje liquid deo with potassium alum in it. It works well but I don't sweat much. Also used Pure deo co but it's not ZW. I've heard good things about Ethique solid deo & want to try it next!"
