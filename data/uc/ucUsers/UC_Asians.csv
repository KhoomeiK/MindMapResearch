UCSD,fpgyfdq,t3_gd5s4k,1588611735.0,For the most part. But 50 minutes to do a midterm for my language class is too little time.
thewalkingdead,fpfm0go,t3_gd47j2,1588575455.0,Season 7-8 weren't horrible per se. Buuutt it was the time where watching TWD felt more of a chore than anything.

 When it happened, I met someone who I thought would be a good guy to hang out with despite being negative. Texts suddenly, that he does not want to associate himself with me in the middle of stressing the hell out cuz of homework for a b.s reason I have ZERO control over.
