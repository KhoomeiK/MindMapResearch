WayOfTheBern,fpmzxb5,t1_fpmzmcl,1588746167.0,Ya no that shit is  demoralizing but that just tells me it's up to us now we can't look to heroes anymore cause they'll all let us down we're the heroes we're the ones who'll change America for the better we just gotta buy into it and keep forging a path forward for the things we need
WayOfTheBern,fpmzdqw,t1_fpmyy20,1588745746.0,Basically it was talking about the corruption in Bernie's campign from his advisors. Someone who worked in the campaign was talking about how in 2016 it was more grassroots but now there were more democratic hacks who were just trying to get cash and they pushed out lots of the grassroots I'm sure Jimmy Will post the whole thing tomorrow he usually posts segments the next day
WayOfTheBern,fpmyv52,t1_fpmyt0e,1588745341.0,It was live lmao it's done now that's my bad
WayOfTheBern,fpmkzhm,t1_fpmkizg,1588735399.0,I guess that's fair but I like that he's speaking the Truth on progressive leaders who aren't leading and are either enabling the problems or are the problem and for that he's important
WayOfTheBern,fpmgzje,t1_fpmglnl,1588732870.0,I'm greatful someone understands cause I'm done with trying to reform that's obviously not gonna happen in the current system we need actual revolution current leaders politicians and leader of unions won't do it they're already majority corrupt it's gonna be on the people to continue the movement and get these policies done stop looking for heroes in politics the people are the heroes always have been always will be
WayOfTheBern,fpmfi19,t1_fpmf7bb,1588731941.0,Just curious how come
WayOfTheBern,fpmcxuw,t3_ge8t94,1588730361.0,Watch the Jimmy Dore show right now on you might feel different link: https://youtu.be/qu7_JgzrdbI
GreenParty,fpexwod,t1_fpewbjo,1588557325.0,I'm just saying maybe if we bulid it up or get those members and resources in the green party it couldn't hurt or maybe even rebrand the green party as the people's party etc
SandersForPresident,fpery03,t1_fpendtl,1588553659.0,I'm just saying the green party alligns with berniecrats then Joe does why not try to make the green party a thing instead of siding with neo libs that haven't done anything significant for working class people for 40 years the Democratic party is the party of professional and rich suburbanites Al Gore and Hillary are all one in the same pandering with no action unless it's for their doners stop trying to scare people out of their beliefs
SandersForPresident,fped3jz,t1_fpdkmy9,1588545140.0,Join the green party or the people's party link: https://peoplesparty.org/
GreenParty,fpecubv,t1_fpe0l1r,1588544990.0,Oh 100% dems and Republicans need to go down a peg maybe even down for the count
GreenParty,fpdtv25,t1_fpdtk8i,1588534123.0,I'm not opposed to working with libertarians on the things we agree without tbh as long as either side doesn't over step it's bounds
GreenParty,fpdgu69,t1_fpd5cx7,1588526719.0,We should join with the people's party here's the link: https://peoplesparty.org/
UCSC,fp3q6b3,t1_fp3poz2,1588283796.0,So are we not gonna shame the admins too or are we just ignoring that again you can critic the protestors cause I think they could have gone about it better but what they were fighting for was valid
UCSC,fp3p5o4,t1_fp3nn5o,1588283278.0,Then no need to shame protesters but rather we need to come together and get better at protesting and make sure it's not just shit stirrers who are probably the people who did the vandalism
UCSC,fp3ibmw,t1_fp3htvi,1588279801.0,But protesting is essential to getting our voices heard I don't exactly love how the cola protest went but that doesn't mean all forms of protest are bad or that what they were fighting for was wrong that would be dealing in absolutes
UCSC,fp3dbpu,t1_fp3cxk1,1588277324.0,I just don't like the idea of lumping in protestors with vandals makes all protestors look bad obviously whoever did this was out of line and did something that wasn't gonna help the cause
UCSC,fp36z8o,t1_fp2y0oq,1588274176.0,These aren't protestors they're clowns and vandals don't lump them in together
WayOfTheBern,fozrege,t1_fozo41g,1588195546.0,"Oh I hope so I definitely respect yang for saying something about it unlike other ""outsiders"" who are being quiet"
WayOfTheBern,fozdqhj,t1_fozccnz,1588188950.0,Oh I definitely voted for Bernie in California last month but even with that if new York is cancelling their primary I feel like others are going to follow suit
WayOfTheBern,foz2f68,t1_foz1mpr,1588183527.0,Ya language like that just turns me off like telling me nothing will change sounds like signaling to well off aristocrats who don't have to worry about food or rent and aren't scared rn cause I know personally I'm a bit terrified all I know is the moment it's ok to be out and about I want to protest and organize cause after all the cares and cobra nonsense I'm pushing every last Democrat to care about our rights
WayOfTheBern,foz1e1y,t1_foz17d1,1588183009.0,That's fair but I definitely don't like em as of right now I hope Biden gives me a reason to vote for him but if not I'm not going to I don't owe him a thing
WayOfTheBern,foz17zr,t1_foy1088,1588182925.0,And that's just a little spineless to me considering what happened in 2016 and him knowing how corrupt most of them are it's just baffling to say ur anti establishment then support the establishment
WayOfTheBern,foz138w,t1_foyhrkq,1588182859.0,Ok I don't mean sell out as in now he's a complete corporatists neo-lib but what I'm saying is he should have stood his ground and forced Biden left before endorsing him or hell endorsing a 3rd party that alligns with his view Better so then they get that apparatus of the Bernie campaign. I honestly think 3rd party is the future after seeing these last 2 election cycles might take awhile but that's the best hope for the future
WayOfTheBern,foz0mca,t1_foxrspn,1588182621.0,I want to believe that that's the case but part of me feels like he did it because he didn't want to be remembered as a Ralph Nader. Regardless I just wish bernie would have used his leverage as essentially the leader of the progressive movement to get concessions and play hard ball with Joe and the establishment
WayOfTheBern,foxqx4c,t1_foxq0w2,1588153149.0,Oh it def hurts but the more you say it the more used to it you become
WayOfTheBern,foxpaln,t1_foxp7c1,1588151490.0,I mean Bernie's kinda sold out too tho
BernieSanders,fovo9z8,t1_fovlrol,1588104688.0,I mean he's just telling it like it is tbh
television,foto8hr,t1_foto3co,1588060270.0,The industry ya but I mean like the people themselves people wanted things to be faster and faster of course the industry didn't like YouTube before because they didn't have control over it but now a new set of people have control and they're even worse in some aspects but they do make the content faster and faster so people will eat it up
television,fotnhn1,t1_fotn2kp,1588059557.0,Hmm that's fair but speaking as someone who grew up as the shift from mtv to YouTube and social media happened the people got what they wanted which is more content and it being on demand rather then waiting for a song to come on I say maybe don't rely on the algorithm honestly would be cool to have music video radio but that's never coming back at Least not for the foreseeable feature not enough people want it outside of well the niche because they're used to what they have now for better or worse also mtv classic does exist if ur cable provider offers it it's a pain but it's what it is entertainment works off popularity and how much it can make for investors
television,fotiwcg,t1_fotfquo,1588055307.0,Ya cause people get those niches online cable has just become outdated sucks to say but it's the truth fringe culture isn't birth on tv anymore luckily I got to enjoy the last couple years of this kind of cable
GreenParty,for7l5g,t1_for2kbs,1588007531.0,"Exactly I feel like if we run the numbers and get organized as much as the establishment or even more so we can get the green party to 5% then from there we can go all out smearing the dems and Republicans for 4 years and finally turn the tide because most 20 and 30 something's are tired of the bs in DC (speaking as a current 20 something myself) them we can conciliate other left orgs like dsa or the people's party even some libertarians under some basic things like a second bill of Rights, green new deal and m4a"
flicks,foiab2k,t1_foi83au,1587782065.0,That's very true
flicks,foi0gm5,t1_fohzx3j,1587776208.0,Welp thanks now I know that sounds awful
flicks,fohzk6t,t1_fohz6ha,1587775706.0,Definitely have but thanks for the bit
flicks,fohwup0,t3_g7hyc0,1587774192.0,Ooooooooooooof hoping for just an answer not upvotes lmao
GreenParty,foc0j7k,t1_fobspnf,1587665762.0,Very true just doing my due diligence and research on the fellow cause I'm damn sure not voting trump or Biden
GreenParty,fobkw2i,t3_g6l3co,1587660857.0,Didn't he believe in Russiagate
nintendo,fo9mkm4,t3_g6aegh,1587624007.0,Definitely fallout 3 the first time I booted it up it was like crossing over into a different world before that I only really got to play fps and fighting games neither had an expansive world or deep immersion but fallout 3 grabbed me and didn't let go and every time I hear swing or jazz I think of 3 dog
WayOfTheBern,fntqnay,t1_fntq5qr,1587246894.0,He said so himself that it wouldn't be enough Many times I don't think he was gonna keep 2050 as the goal scientist say it's not enough Bernie would have changed as he we saw for because I trust him to 40 years of Bernie tells me that 40 years of Biden tells me wall street and big business will be in those positions and they won't change fast enough
WayOfTheBern,fntpobn,t1_fntnqrk,1587246382.0,It's half measures and public health care options isn't the move cause then the government version would get bogged down making the government version less good than private you want it to be through the government for the essentials such that it's the same level of health insurance for everyone and net zero by 2050 isn't fast enough it's not drastic enough we only got til the end of the decade to transform shit or millions will die slow change isn't real change mlk said something similar tho the quote escapes me rn also you can't tell me that America hasn't moved more right in recent years cause the proof is in who we got in the White House rn
WayOfTheBern,fntn5an,t1_fntmoer,1587245005.0,"Does biden offer a green new deal, or the legalization of weed and freeing people who are in jail on petty drug charges, how about free college doee Biden offer that how about Medicare for all Jesus you guys are bad Faith actors"
WayOfTheBern,fntm2lj,t1_fntlmu6,1587244384.0,Better measures then biden
WayOfTheBern,fntkmlp,t1_fntkl6i,1587243554.0,Never said that he did
WayOfTheBern,fntkd13,t1_fntje3a,1587243402.0,Because they're half measures at best we can do better than that
WayOfTheBern,fnprne9,t1_fnpbqec,1587150741.0,Ya he fought for one more crumb what a great job
WayOfTheBern,fnlhg8y,t1_fnlgz6o,1587053616.0,Honestly probably not tho I hope we could do something between now and November to change the narrative personally I'm not crazy about Biden but it would be easier to hold his feet to the fire then Trumps but I'm trying to get progressives a legit party before the next next general election so by then we don't have to fight neolibs until the general
WayOfTheBern,fnlfuko,t1_fnleon9,1587052815.0,That's for the big progressives brains to come up with I'm but a normal college kid I'm just saying it's better than just taking it from Trump and Biden we don't need to be doom and gloom if we can do this as far as not compromising safety there's no way to do that air tight but again you can ball park it using the most accurate polls and what usual turn out looks like then factor in first time voters who many of whom are literally immoveable and won't vote Biden or Trump and then get some progressives who would just vote Biden if there's a consensus plan which we progressives can get by holding bidens feet to the fire
WayOfTheBern,fnle3np,t1_fnldnpv,1587051939.0,"You look at the data and do the math to ballpark how much you'd need in each of the safe states on top of this there's untapped potential in the many who don't vote anyway that's a large chunk of people even when there's ""high turn out"" if we can just get some of them in key states to vote we can walk and chew gum set a path for progressives going forward so they don't have to fight with neolibs during primaries if they want the party let them have it we can get people behind a new one if we show it to be a potential winner"
WayOfTheBern,fnlctzl,t1_fnlcaav,1587051285.0,Or we could do this strategically and make an initiative to have people in the safe states vote for the green party and have people in the battleground states vote Biden such that we get to the 5% mark and beat trump which don't seem mutually exclusive as long as we the people get the vote out
BernieSanders,fni7de3,t1_fni522e,1586975224.0,The progressive left needs to use this victory to become organized and to plot plans like the Republicans did in 64 after losing with Goldwater after this they played the long game and got Regan in the 80s and have been in control ever since really as all winners since have been right wing even Obama and Clinton since they're neo-lib essentially we need to lull the msm and dnc into thinking they've won and split up progressives when in actuality we were getting stronger in the green party
BernieSanders,fni522e,t3_g1t0se,1586974108.0,Straight up I say everyone who's in a battleground state should just vote Biden even though I hate him what he stands for and the neo lib way and everyone who's in a safe bet state vote Green so that by 2024 they become legit and we don't have to keep selling out to Democrats and so the next progressive who gains the attention of a Bernie doesn't have to play the establishment games and in the meantime we hold bidens feet to the fire and push him and his administration to the left more and more with protest with strikes like with fdr in the early 30s and lbj in the 60s
YangForPresidentHQ,fnfu39x,t1_fnfs0ef,1586915488.0,FACTS
YangForPresidentHQ,fneo4qu,t1_fnencu1,1586892833.0,I guess honestly since yesterday I've cooled down on it I understand why he's doing what he's doing it just sucks that Biden is the one he's conceding to but ur right who else I just wish he would have held bidens feet to the fire more before endorsing so we could get more out of it and that could have happened behind the scenes I'm just not convinced hopefully Biden can do that before Nov to me and other progressives
YangForPresidentHQ,fnemx3q,t1_fndcpr5,1586892219.0,Well of course that's a big part of it too but it was based in a populist grassroots coalition and gave the impression at least of anti establishment
YangForPresidentHQ,fndy9dg,t1_fndefl6,1586879717.0,There's that too
YangForPresidentHQ,fnd3gl3,t1_fnd2wy9,1586857247.0,So what ur telling me is that we're doomed and stuck with the DNC and RNC and don't really have a choice or way out
YangForPresidentHQ,fnd2itt,t1_fnd27tm,1586856181.0,So now we should try to fix it to a viable election process for multiple parties and expand how open it cause be
YangForPresidentHQ,fnczkqy,t1_fncz8nx,1586852888.0,Then not why have a multiple party system like various counties in Europe
YangForPresidentHQ,fncwj1g,t1_fncwg1i,1586849661.0,That too
YangForPresidentHQ,fncpcg2,t1_fncniw8,1586842951.0,Explain
YangForPresidentHQ,fnc948h,t1_fnc84vm,1586831293.0,He'll need it to win tho as 2016 showed
YangForPresidentHQ,fnc5nui,t1_fnc5fxm,1586829147.0,Because Bernie's entire campaign was about being anti establishment and taking on the corruption in DC who's more establishment then Joe Biden who's more corrupt than Joe Biden
GreenParty,fnc4nrr,t1_fnc4i6o,1586828540.0,Yes I love this idea cause god knows most are over what's been going on in DC and what has been going on
YangForPresidentHQ,fnc2als,t1_fnc0wuq,1586827117.0,Love when people make this clear
YangForPresidentHQ,fnc27xb,t1_fnc10yt,1586827074.0,Sadly this is Tru I say it's because he had a bigger hill to climb this time in multiple ways
GreenParty,fnc1zs1,t1_fnc11nm,1586826940.0,Exactly we gotta do what the left was trying todo in the late 60s all the left groups coming together this is the time
YangForPresidentHQ,fnbz3ll,t1_fnbyuo4,1586825219.0,Then we should make it bigger
WayOfTheBern,fnbs2j9,t1_fnbrlpn,1586821199.0,Ur 100% right that makes him look very hypocritical like the rest of the dem in the metoo and times up you hate to see it hopefully we can all go to the green party and make them viable
WayOfTheBern,fnbo5hy,t1_fnbfhtg,1586819048.0,I will say this the situation is different in that Bernie was essentially the last person standing besides Biden and all of the candidates agreed to endorse the nominee Tulsi still had a choice to make between Democrats Bernie didn't I would have love for him to endorse the green party but we all know he wasn't going to
YangForPresidentHQ,fnbk2eu,t1_fnbj8fn,1586816920.0,Ok fair enough but should we just not pay attention to the lieing and his record?
YangForPresidentHQ,fnbixv3,t1_fnbikv3,1586816349.0,But that's not true tho I'm just saying I find it hard to believe as in I'm on the fence but when people like you bark at me I hate Trump I would never cast a vote for him I'm no actor just a kid for a working class background who's tired of the people in DC fucking us why is that so hard to grasp
YangForPresidentHQ,fnbhiir,t1_fnbgq6b,1586815629.0,That's tru but he didn't get a constant wave of negative press like Bernie did even in debates that Bernie won most on CNN's and MSNBC's panels said another neo lib won or that Warren was the winner Biden got mostly neutral press and was the front-runner for most of this cycle and only wasn't for a brief moments that Warren then Bernie were then  South Carolina happened then the afterburners turned on and it was essentially finished
YangForPresidentHQ,fnbgcvw,t1_fnbg0c9,1586815048.0,I just find it hard to believe he'd actually do it considering his history
YangForPresidentHQ,fnbf7hm,t1_fnbepak,1586814470.0,I don't think the grandma's are DNC spies but they never got the whole truth this cycle the media didn't give Bernie nearly as much fair coverage as the neolibs regardless Bernie lost and I have to live with that I'm just saying the DNC did plenty of sketchy stuff like iowa and still having primaries even through we have a pandemic
YangForPresidentHQ,fnbea1q,t1_fnbdo8p,1586813992.0,I just hope enough concessions were made so I could be swayed I live in California so I don't have to vote for Biden if I don't want to all I'm asking is for him to give me a legitimate reason by backing something I believe in
YangForPresidentHQ,fnbdxsy,t1_fnbdd51,1586813823.0,Hmm I guess that makes sense but didn't George Washington and some of the other founding fathers not want a dual party system
YangForPresidentHQ,fnbc4uj,t1_fnbblsi,1586812915.0,Exactly regardless of how bad people might think or say Trump is he's the favorite right now especially since he's the incumbent president the last 2 incumbents to lose lost to candidates in Bill and Regan who had tons of energy and excitement at the time they ran (regardless of how you feel about them after the fact) Biden doesn't have that energy at all and that's scary
YangForPresidentHQ,fnbbeh0,t1_fnbab38,1586812545.0,I guess ur right personally would want to maybe make a 3rd party for workers and progressives and I feel like the green party might be that although I'm scared to vote for them as if they don't hit 5% it would be for nothing I want to just vote for Biden and trust that the right thing will happen but the Democrats track record in the last 40 years says otherwise but then again the Republicans have been worse so why can't we all just instead of setting for Biden be bold and go green
YangForPresidentHQ,fnb9eah,t1_fnb9adu,1586811521.0,What does it mean for the anti establish movement as a whole if we just cave in now especially after being shat on for so long
YangForPresidentHQ,fnb9adu,t1_fnb927h,1586811468.0,I understand it's just hard to forgive Biden and the DNC's scheming ways what does it make me if I compromise on my ideals for things that should and need to happen
YangForPresidentHQ,fnb55vh,t1_fnb40gs,1586809398.0,I'm not saying Bernie should run 3rd party I'm just saying he could have stayed in until the convention such that he'd have more leverage such that he could move the party more left which wouldn't be a bad idea considering Hillary was a moderate and lost also I'm not a Bernie zealot I like him but I don't live and die by him I'm here for the policies Bernie can be and has been wrong on plenty you got the wrong guy if you think I'm just blinding following anyone
YangForPresidentHQ,fnb3tni,t1_fnb3piv,1586808732.0,But by less margins then Hillary was leading and a single debate hasn't even happen yet
SandersForPresident,fnb3p4k,t1_fnay9vu,1586808668.0,"That's not true at all tho it's not always voting for the lesser of 2 evils when the it's legitimately democratic and both candidates are there because of the people voting for them and bit due to rigging polls, media propaganda that's obviously against one candidate, and the kind of coalescing around 1 candidates right before super Tuesday if this election cycle has been anything it's not ordinary"
YangForPresidentHQ,fnb1sf8,t1_fnb1o0f,1586807716.0,Ya that's tru but it's not looking good for Biden right now either so it might be in vain regardless but I get you
YangForPresidentHQ,fnb135j,t1_fnb0vu2,1586807374.0,Sad like I don't necessarily think Bernie or yang are actually sellouts I think they're just trying to leverage the Biden platform but I'm not with it tbh I don't agree but I still like both Yang and Bernie a lot
YangForPresidentHQ,fnb0s4q,t1_fnayqev,1586807224.0,Welp as a Bernie supporter I'll say it right here he's sold out twice once to Hillary and now to Biden screw the DNC screw the establishment
BernieSanders,fn19uez,t1_fn0ipom,1586557668.0,Because of the media Obama didn't oppose or appear to opposite the neo lib status quo but the people voting for him though they'd get real change and when they didn't get that real change they got angry and when they did they voted for the opposite of what they voted for instead of voting for someone who tried to brand himself a hope they went for some who echoed their anger we got trump because of Obama people got desperate and at the same time as they got desperate misinformation hit a new low
SandersForPresident,fn04i98,t1_fmzmi99,1586535302.0,Ffc?
BlackPeopleTwitter,fmycff0,t1_fmxhq2c,1586482937.0,The problem with an app is that it can be fucked with paper ballots are key Because it's more secure they used machines this time and there was a lot of inconstancies not gonna say it was rigged but it looks fishy
SandersForPresident,fmybz8u,t3_fxryak,1586482648.0,Should have hit Biden in the jugular but called him a friend instead
tytonreddit,fmx1b03,t3_fxwxby,1586456690.0,Smh they look more and more fake by the day
awfuleverything,fmvogto,t1_fmvo5sp,1586424671.0,I feel like they do when it's something good tho like I'm definitely no American exceptionalist but America is unique in the fact that when they do things in a large scale people pay attention for the good and bad I'm just saying that if America started a green arms race essentially most countries would also invest in green technology because then it would be seem as profitable you gotta show those investors that green is profitable on top of more ethical a better shot then what we are likely to witness these next 4 years unless we the people fight for it tooth and nail
awfuleverything,fmvnjfj,t1_fmvhvwl,1586423619.0,It's about setting the precedent if America does it then most of the world will follow and if not they can be incentivized to do so (ie showing countries that green is profitable) but when you don't have a progressive president you don't have this
tytonreddit,fmvm1nc,t1_fmv49fr,1586421946.0,FACTS they don't talk enough about organizing
BernieSanders,fmt8i9p,t1_fmt7ynq,1586368561.0,It's not inaction tho why vote for Biden give me a good reason besides the fact that he isn't trump because that's not compelling to me as a working class black man as both candidates have made life harder for people like me
BernieSanders,fmt7m2n,t1_fmt6rox,1586368150.0,Or I could vote for everything but the presidential candidate whom I don't disagree with to make sure my state county and city aren't as fucked. I morally can't vote for either tbh I know too much to blindly vote for either of them I couldn't live with myself if I knew that I voted for either
BernieSanders,fmt5i5y,t1_fmt3shw,1586367187.0,Why vote for someone you don't agree with isn't the whole point to vote for someone you agree with
BernieSanders,fmsymyx,t1_fmsycjg,1586364051.0,Hope you enjoy 4 more years of Trump cause the Republican Base isn't gonna play softball with Biden like Bernie regardless the corporate suits have won and the working class just got decimated again
BernieSanders,fmsycjg,t1_fmsw01u,1586363921.0,Is it when the the media has a clear bias is it a democracy when the other side and the dnc has a very obvious bias or is it fixed we all know that we're less than a democracy look at what happened in Iowa we all know shit got fixed
