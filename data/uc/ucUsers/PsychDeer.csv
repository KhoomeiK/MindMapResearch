ucla,fp6ptoh,t3_galted,1588356507.0,"Aniq claims to want to detoxify USAC but at the debate he spent the entire time attacking other candidates and failing to defend his policies. Stop hiding behind the identity politics you are using Aniq. Additionally, Aniq received a sanction for lying about one of his positions. He claimed to be a legislative Aide when in reality he was just an intern. You are nothing more than a wannabe politician trying to ride the wave of anti-USAC populism into office."
