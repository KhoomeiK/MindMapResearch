KUWTK,fpfnke7,t1_fp8ggk4,1588576932.0,I‚Äôm literally almost the same age as Sofia Richie and I cannot imagine dating a man twice my age and playing stepmom to his 3 kids with a Kardashian as a baby mama you have to appease. LordT

KUWTK,fpfnbyf,t1_fp9659y,1588576711.0,"Yeah, like I kind of worry about that bc she‚Äôs so young (we‚Äôre almost the same age actually). Like, it might be that thing where she keeps not being satisfied and gets so extreme with it and by then she‚Äôll only be like in her 30s with this super disfigured, just trying-to-keep-it-together kind of body. Like it only works for *so* long, ya know? Kinda sad"

She quite literally lives in a walled-off castle to recognize it. There‚Äôs definitely so many ways to mind your own business or like idk find a hobby or ‚Äî when ‚Äî *actually* run your company/work. 

I honestly think her and Stass just actually take pictures of eachother all day and embody the ‚Äòrich is my personality‚Äô because they have nothing better to do. It‚Äôs kinda sad


Also: does anyone else find it super cringe how Kylie‚Äôs friends like very obviously center their lives around her in some ways? At least semi-mooching :/"

ucla,fozqvfz,t1_fozf6ae,1588195283.0,"I‚Äôm someone who wanted CS classes and considered switching into ling and CS. I decided against it bc you took a small percentage of programming classes in comparison to everything else. I suggest looking up the majors your considering they all usually have a page of their course requirements/4 year plan and try to look into the classes to see what you‚Äôd be interested in. I.e. compare the classes they list with the course list descriptions so you know what LING 10 is and what CS 35L is, etc. (just an example)"

ucla,foyilo9,t3_ga4a4z,1588173187.0,"I want to walk thru campus surrounded by people SO BAD :(

kind of just a minor thing but I really loved having a good playlist or podcast and walking thru campus, just having a grand ole time admiring buildings and trees. Or getting offered flyers or spontaneously buying [whatevers being sold] by bruinwalk or hearing the tour guides or various dance practices or marching band in the distance, people on their skateboards or scooters passing you, waving to friends you pass by. 

It was really just so lively and it makes me sad that it won‚Äôt be the same for a while. Like, even if we‚Äôre allowed back, it‚Äôll definitely be a different mood with everyone hyperaware of the physical distance and contact they‚Äôre making."

I don‚Äôt remember how many digits exactly, only that it was a whole page of a large font sheet. Could‚Äôve well been around this point.

ucla,focavwm,t1_foc9i3g,1587669154.0,"Yeah, assuming you‚Äôve been going in order of lower divs. I switched majors so I had to go off track, but I think I only ended up taking 2-3 upper divs before taking 100b. And yeah declaring is at the end of summer 3rd yr (I‚Äôm like mostly sure, but double check w the dept), so it is possible to put it off 100b or/have leeway to take it later if keep getting crappy enrollment times. Like they sort of get that you can‚Äôt just not take classes and be under units if you don‚Äôt get this one class"
ucla,fob4vmj,t3_g5t64i,1587656148.0,"Not psychobio but cog sci so we‚Äôre still in the same dept, so just reiterating answer from the psych department counseling bc I‚Äôve asked about this before: ans is not necessarily. 

Some classes do have enforced pre-reqs or having to be declared major standing, which will actually prevent you from enrolling into those classes on myUCLA (you have to check course descriptions to know or email and ask the self their recommendations). Other classes, it‚Äôs just very suggested u do 100b first bc of the conceptual preparation (not rly strictly content-wise, I guess more like experience thinking critically about research design bc it‚Äôll come up in later classes), but they don‚Äôt actually stop you from enrolling so you‚Äôre free to do things as u wish, which I‚Äôve done a couple times just based on certain classes‚Äô availabilities."
