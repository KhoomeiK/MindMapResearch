Sourdough,fox8cr1,t3_ga1k1f,1588136628.0,"I started mine with bleached, and for almost three weeks, I saw literally no activity. Then, I decided to break into my VERY limited supply of whole wheat, and with adding just a little bit of wheat flour (like 2 tbsp ish) for two feedings, it already has grown so much. So it really does make a difference"
berkeley,fowm7e3,t3_g9wxq7,1588122539.0,Omg me too fml and my enrollment is tmr afternoon :((
berkeley,fowm2q1,t3_g9wrnm,1588122464.0,do u guys think they’ll open up more spots for phase 2? :((
Sourdough,fos56lu,t1_foryziy,1588024175.0,"I do have a little bit, but not very much. What percent would you say is necessary? Also, how is bread flour vs whole wheat (in reference to previous comment)"
Sourdough,fos50jy,t1_forxz5y,1588024090.0,"I have a little bit, but not very much. How many feeds do you think it would take?"
Sourdough,forxalf,t3_g98x1a,1588020133.0,"Oh, also I should add that I have baked quite a few things with the discard, and the sourdough flavor IS there"

berkeley,fodq7cf,t3_g6g2qq,1587688048.0,I feel like this isn’t publicized enough. Why did I not know that this guy existed until now
berkeley,fodpygx,t3_g6et0r,1587687910.0,This is one of the most fucked up things I’ve seen
unpopularopinion,foctqqg,t3_g6qe3w,1587675747.0,"If Jeff Bezos donating x amount of money is the equivalent of me donating 1 cent, it should be treated the same way. I mean, I don’t think you should shame someone for not donating, bc it is their choice after all. However, we shouldn’t be like oooOoOoooOoOO how generous if it’s literally the equivalent of my 1 cent"
running,focrbq0,t3_g6rwu5,1587674818.0,"I feel like this definitely happens to me! Like in my head I’m like “oh no, what if I go on a run and it turns out I got slower” even though I know it shouldn’t matter for just a run out in the neighborhood"
unpopularopinion,foc1lij,t1_fo9q61r,1587666090.0,"I also don't think that OP is trying to say that we should make fat people hate themselves, just that we shouldn't let people think that being fat is something to be proud of. I think that in life, there are always ways you can better yourself, but recognizing the things you need to work on doesn't mean that you hate yourself. However, you can't sit around all day being proud of all your faults, or else you'll never be motivated to improve."
Sourdough,fo95vb2,t3_fvct25,1587611250.0,"just wanted to say THANK YOU so much for this post. it had been over 2 weeks since I started (albeit with bleached flour because that’s all I can get rn :( ) and I was getting super frustrated, but I tried taking a break from feeding and sure enough, it’s doubled after about 48 hours! this def gave me the encouragement to keep going haha"
math,fo5xj5l,t3_g5tch8,1587538991.0,"This isn’t even a problem I solved, but I think it’s a pretty funny story so I’m gonna share :)


Back when I was in high school, we had a super casual local competition with some problems put together by some MOP kids. The problems were weighted so that the harder ones at the end were worth more points and the easier ones were worth less. One of the very end questions was this super hard geometry questions, and no one could solve it. However, this kid from another team ended up pulling out a ruler, very carefully drawing a diagram, and measuring it - and ended up getting the correct answer. I don’t remember the exact results, but that problem was enough to significantly boost his score."
Baking,fo5w59f,t3_g5hq8i,1587537647.0,That looks so good! Much better than I can do haha
Healthy_Recipes,fo5vx46,t3_g5ulan,1587537432.0,"You could start with foods that you DO like eating, and try to modify them to make them healthier. For example, perhaps you really enjoy french fries. Instead of ordering from McDonald’s, you could toss some potato slices into the overnight and bake them instead. That would be a good first step, imo."

FigureSkating,fnxmry4,t3_g4g76m,1587341920.0,"I love Aliona Kostornaia’s skating. Her jumps have so much speed, distance, and height, and the quality of her 3A is unmatched in the ladies’ field. Her movements are so light and angelic, and though it’s hard for me to pinpoint exactly what she’s doing that the others aren’t to have that beautiful, floaty feeling, when I watch her skating I know it’s something special. Plus, she’s so pretty and has a sweet personality."
FigureSkating,fnv5bxt,t3_g41d29,1587280763.0,"Not a fan of Anna S., but her personality is so sweet and she’s very cute. Also, flexibility 

Not a fan of Bradie, but she works so hard and it shows with the improvements she’s made.

Not a fan of Gabby Daleman, but her jumps are huge"

berkeley,fnfvfzx,t3_g1fdcr,1586916314.0,"You can still do data 8 and major and Econ, you just have to take the Stat88 connector course. However, even though that’s an extra class, I’ve heard that Data 8 is a really good learning experience while Stat 20 isn’t very well run, so that’s something to consider."
berkeley,fnfv3ai,t3_g1h9ei,1586916097.0,Take a language class!
Healthy_Recipes,fne812g,t1_fndswvx,1586884680.0,"I think it's really helpful to just not buy a ton of snacks when shopping. That way, it'll force you to reach for a piece of fruit or yogurt when you get hungry, and just in general eat more fresh produce that require cooking"
Sourdough,fncrue9,t1_fnc36tz,1586845154.0,"Thank you (and everyone else!) for the suggestions! This recipe says “mature” sourdough starter though, so I was wondering if that meant my discard wouldn’t work?"

fatlogic,fmxflbl,t3_fxzon5,1586464070.0,Fat is also an adjective as well as a noun. Fingernail is just a noun
berkeley,fmugezv,t3_fxfzmz,1586390901.0,"Just submit the form, and you’ll be fine. I didn’t take one of my exams, plus I didn’t take a college class I said I was going to take, and I’m still at Berkeley"
