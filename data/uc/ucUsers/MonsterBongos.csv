You'd think they were related they are so similar , but they're not. It's just a particular personality type (none) that seems to gravitate and do well in that field.   
Don't be fooled. It's all cover for low self esteem and daddy issues.  
If you want to have fun,  do your socializing in other majors like philosophy, arts, and music. They like people, like to stay up late talking,  and are a friendly lot. The guys in your field are just waiting to get a job with SKYNET so they can usher in global armageddon."
JusticeServed,fol2o0g,t1_fojcmx4,1587853690.0,I get it. It just looks scary. Thanks.
JusticeServed,fojc0ks,t1_fojb8qs,1587816243.0,"Yeah. That's exactly when parents are supposed to take measures to prevent it becoming a violent full blown problem later on. 
Not the say that the kid is just an asshole, but his physical and vocal reactions are not common, and a sign of poor impulse control. Could be diet, environment, PTSD or who nows, but that behavior unchecked, is a ticking time bomb.
It's on his parents to raise him.
Anyway, just an opinion. I see where you're coming from."
JusticeServed,fojavu4,t3_g7ni3i,1587815112.0,Yeah. I'd get that kid into therapy. Little rageaholic in the making.
lgv30,foera8x,t3_g6o49j,1587712077.0,"EXACTLY. I have no problems so far, been three years, I replaced the battery with a stock battery once, and I use wireless charging, so no wear and tear on the charger ports, (a source of sudden death for many micro usb charging ports because they are so small and delicate compared to other parts on the phone)  
I have another battery on standby and conceivably I might keep this LG V30 another two years.  
Like the phone before it,   (A Motorola Moto X Pure) the only thing they need to do make it better would be a slight screen size bump, some extra RAM and a faster chipset, but I'm sure people think the same thing about their spouses.   
Most companies don't seem to make these incremental improvements on old favorite models, unless it is a higher-end phone series like a samsung or Huawei series, in which case they just start with a really great phone, and then just tighten it up a little each year.   
If any one of you DO find a phone for under $600 that is as reliable, and also has a good camera, and at least 6 GB RAM, LET ME KNOW.   
Thanks!"

WTF? Never seen that  style before."

""EL Mala"" or ""El maLA"""
