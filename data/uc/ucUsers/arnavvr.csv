fatFIRE,fpc2cbp,t1_fpc1vu1,1588485375.0,"While I do like this strategy, it is not leverage like real estate per se. Leveraged ETFs readjust daily, so in flat markets you can end up losing money. Overall, I do think it is a good strategy for someone who is young and is looking to maximize returns."
fatFIRE,fpawpvr,t1_fpawnum,1588457293.0,Are you doing it in a taxable or tax advantaged account?
AskAnAmerican,fp6qw4p,t3_gbiyl1,1588357032.0,"I haven’t actually been here, but I really want to go to Charleston, SC. It just has such an old-world charm and so much history, especially related to the Civil War."

PassportPorn,fp39vlm,t3_gavg36,1588275619.0,"I wouldn’t renounce American citizenship. Yes, it’s a pain to file taxes every year, but you won’t be paying much more unless you make > ~ $100K (due to the Foreign Income tax exclusion)."
AskAnAmerican,fp342ip,t1_fp2daae,1588272729.0,"I don’t live in a small town, but in a post-WWII suburb. That’s how I feel when I go to SF as well. Very walkable, and it’s really nice."
fatFIRE,fp2j8p6,t1_fp1z9oh,1588262698.0,What’s the best way to do that in a taxable account? Do you sell the losers to avoid capital gains?

AskAnAmerican,fol6w4f,t1_fok3hyg,1587856057.0,"Maybe it’s just the people that I interact with/immediate family, but in the SF Bay I see quite a lot of that with Southerners too."
