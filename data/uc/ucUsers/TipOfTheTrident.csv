UCSD,fo15zt4,t3_g4nyjw,1587426446.0,"I was a transfer but also I was much older. I already planned to focus on studying and not participating in much social activities. Turns out it was better that way as Ageism would have been an issue. Right from the git, other students would ask if I was a student or parent or faculty or staff. A couple times during rush weeks I even recorded myself walking through library walk as all the frats tried to recruit. I wasn’t even looked at nor given any flyers. It was pretty funny. 

I got used to the isolation for the most part. It was actually better for me cuz I wasn’t the greatest student.   Any distractions woulda hurt me. But all that isolation degraded my vocabulary I know it!

I took it all in stride until I was studying on a back table in Revelle’s commuter lounge around 10pm and just about to pack up to catch the late bus. I noticed a security guard get off his bike and made a bee line straight for me. There were other students but he went straight to me and asked if I was a student. I looked down at the giant yellow letters on my blue hoodie that screamed “UCSD” on the front. I rolled my eyes and said yes why?

This mf said, “Well you look a little older can I see your ID?” As I pulled it out I started to question why he didn’t ask anyone else. Then I realized he was profiling me. Right after I showed him my ID I let him have it. Like WHY THE FUCK ARE YOU PROFILING ME? DO YOU KNOW HOW MUCH TUITION I’VE PAID HERE. WHY IS YOUR STUPID ASS BOTHERING ME? 

Yeah I went off because I was so livid I demanded to speak with his superior. He tried to calm me down but I said FUCK YOU GIVE ME YOUR SUPERIOR’S NUMBER BITCH! of course the superior calmed me down a bit. I went to all the offices to complain. And they did nothing.

But what hurts the most is that the way he came in to the lounge. Straight for me. Makes me think another student called for security on me when I was just writing up a paper I was so happy to be finishing. 

Winter 2020 was my final quarter. I took 4 classes per to finish early. I thought I was accomplishing something great with a uni I was proud to go to. But now? I’m taking my degree and forgetting about my experience. 

Also I’m changing my Reddit name to UCSDejected Alumni. 😕
