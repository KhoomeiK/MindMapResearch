if you get two c's you have to report it, but even then I doubt they'd rescind your admission with everything going on. during my senior year after i was admitted i got one c and a couple b's second semester, didn't have to report anything, and was fine - they didn't ask any questions lol"

ucla,fohc3me,t3_g6skad,1587763476.0,"Cluster 48 has by far been one of my favorite parts of college so far. My TA was Steve for Fall and Winter and he was an amazing teacher and great personality to work with. There is a decent amount of writing, but they integrate plenty of resources and time into the structure of the class to make sure you are successful, as long as you put in the work, and are willing to ask for help and maintain communication with your TA and/or professor and inquiry specialist. As far as the content, it is pretty heavy content - you will question humanity for sure, but you will also gain a deep perspective on important topics that you may have not otherwise. For example, I had little to no knowledge at all of the Rwandan Genocide before this class, but it is a major event in human history and there is alot to learn about the world from studying the crisis and I feel much more informed after taking the class. And its okay if you miss a lecture or two! I was very sick winter quarter, missed several lectures, and still got an A. Highly recommend taking this class if you can make it work with your schedule!"

Do you want to spend your time out in the middle of nowhere? WSU.

Do you want to remember that you live on planet earth and that water is more than just for beer and showers, and could perhaps be in things called ""oceans""? UCLA.

Up to you, but if this quarantine thing is hitting you at all, its going to be worse when everyone is back to normal if you go to WSU - isolation IS their normal. Not necessarily implying that social isolation and quiet is a bad thing for everyone, or implying that you can't make friends or enjoy your time there. Just remember, despite the important money stuff, the non-monetary life stuff is important too."
