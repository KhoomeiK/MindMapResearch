COVID19,fphuuf5,t1_fphur63,1588628220.0,"but, like, certain neighborhoods may have it, right?"
COVID19,fphuc3y,t1_fpht876,1588627952.0,"Your claim about the date of the origin is controversial (I think). Even if granted, there are still worlds where I contracted it in Chicago in late Dec. Lots of travel happened between NYC-Chicago-LA-SF-Europe-China from late November to mid Dec. And with individual variability, many ppl may have been carrying without symptoms. I dont think Im crazy for thinking it's likely I had it. Was the worst respiratory virus ive ever had and I have had many respiratory illnesses. edit: added 'NYC.'

but yes that is the other controversial claim im starting to find myself in the grips of: it seems likely that at least some cities are close to or have already achieved herd immunity. not quite sold on it yet but that study coming from NYC was powerful."
COVID19,fphsjkg,t1_fphsh7r,1588627020.0,can you give some reasons for thinking that?
COVID19,fphse5m,t1_fphk3nd,1588626940.0,"interesting you say 'probably'. to me, given that I was out drinking for a week straight in a major world center, talking in close quarters with people from LatAm, Europe and Asia, and given that I then contracted a respiratory virus the likes of which I've never experienced, and given that a report came out claiming that there were at least 3k infections in the city as early as mid-late Dec, i infer the contrary: i think it's probable that I had the novel corona virus. Reasonable people can disagree on judgements of probability.

edit: added 'can'."
LosAngeles,fphn6qg,t3_gdipl6,1588624239.0,wait so I cant buy a beer and sit down with a book  in Stories?
COVID19,fphfiq4,t3_gdg00l,1588620373.0,"and in Chicago i might add! me and my dad may have gotten it. not fun times. only reason i didnt request to be brought to ER was because i didnt want to burden my mother on xmas eve. thankfully started feeling better xmas day. my dad was taking short gasps of air for about 24 hrs before he started turning the corner. im in my mid 20s and he's mid 50s. weve both been competitive athletes our whole lives.

edit: added 'may' to capture better my attitude."

California,fmzrvcj,t1_fmz29oy,1586528239.0,"""Fire Department data shows that 1,125 patients were pronounced dead in their homes or on the street in the first five days of April, more than eight times the 131 deaths recorded during the same period last year.

Nearly 120 morgue workers and soldiers are working around the clock to retrieve the bodies of up to 280 people a day who are dying at home in New York City, many of them probably having succumbed to the coronavirus without being counted in the official death toll."" 

From NYT. Death toll in NY is much, much higher than has been officially reported."
UCSantaBarbara,fmsqeh9,t3_fwygdn,1586360321.0,Is it clear that the UC *could* offer tuition compensation since tuition dollars are pledged by the UC to pay for bonds/&c? how would they do this?
