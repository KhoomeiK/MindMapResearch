C_Programming,fpi0ir6,t1_fpht9ly,1588631275.0,You just need android NDK and android-tools (not sure if it still comes with NDK). You can then do everything yourself in like VS code or something.

LiveOverflow,fpey57a,t3_gcydd6,1588557473.0,"That‚Äôs kinda broad, what specifically would you like to see? I think the idea of him covering some aspects of the leak (as you suggested) would be cool.  I would really like a video on fuzzing the OS for exploits!"

cscareerquestions,fpb1h6p,t1_fme6z9o,1588460119.0,"Same here. Was close, but SAT was too low for CS at SJSU. Went to UCSC instead. I thought the CS program is great and is improving. Take the hard professors like Darrell, Miller, Sesh, Harrison, etc.

Regardless of what school you go to, if you want to be a software engineer, what matters is personal projects. Experience is what ultimately lands you an internship and finally a job.

For what it‚Äôs worth, I went there and am currently working at Google. Throughout my time there, I landed interviews at the big 4 every year (and eventually interned at a big 4 and another Fortune 500). What helped me the most was personal projects."
cscareerquestions,fpazv4s,t3_gc3r4b,1588459168.0,"I didn‚Äôt read CTCI or payed much attention in my algo classes, yet I still do well in interviews. What I do is just do a bunch of leetcode problems, and fail at them lol. Then I read the titles of the user submissions or the solution (not the details) and try again. This clues you in on what structure to use. If you fail again, read the solution and learn about the structure they are using then and there. Now try to solve it again with this new knowledge. 

This takes a long time, like 2-3 hours per question tbh, but it drills into you the types of questions that use a data structure and helps you remember patterns."
cscareerquestions,fpavj55,t1_fpatwtg,1588456587.0,I‚Äôve heard it limits future career options - Do you think that is true?
cscareerquestions,fpavck7,t1_fpaspx0,1588456477.0,"It matters as a new grad. It does make a difference. A huge one. Doesn‚Äôt mean that you can‚Äôt get a job, just makes it harder. 

Plus, what did you do between the FAANG offer and graduating? Getting experience I presume? Companies care about experience."

unc0ver,fp6pgcl,t1_fnzr0m5,1588356325.0,"‚ÄúFirst of all, it‚Äôs called an exploit‚Äù Wow, you are so stuck up. A big is exploited to achieve a jailbreak. It is Usually a race condition or a buffer overflow, combined with a separate bug that will leak an address to defeat ASLR. Then, ROP techniques are used to be able to spawn a root processes which is when we achieve a ‚Äújailbreak‚Äù"

Baking,foxne6l,t1_fox53n4,1588149607.0,Thank you! It was great! I added extra coffee so it was a strong coffee flavor which is what I went for. I used Peruvian Coffee Beans that I ground myself for this.
Baking,foxnc2r,t1_fowaajc,1588149550.0,Thanks! I actually smiled while reading this because you caught me red handed! I was extremely generous with the filling on purpose haha. Love me some cheesecake!
Baking,foxn6k3,t1_fox53n4,1588149399.0,"Came out great! I made the mistake of over-beating it, so it came out too creamy (mushy). I fixed that by throwing it in the freezer for a couple hours and it came out perfect üëå

It has a strong coffee flavor, I added an extra table spoon of coffee. I had plain whole fat milk with it, and it was awesome. Hope yours comes out well!"

[This is the recipe I followed!](https://confessionsofabakingqueen.com/coffee-cheesecake/) not copying and pasting it because I didn‚Äôt make it, and I want the author to get the credit due :)

Shout out to /u/uhhnahh, /u/interrstellarrr, /u/dhden for giving me feedback immediately when after I took it out the oven and I was freaking out haha!"
Baking,fotf63v,t3_g9hdo8,1588052150.0,"This is a coffee cheesecake adapted from here: https://confessionsofabakingqueen.com/coffee-cheesecake/

I haven‚Äôt yet put the chocolate on top, and just finished baking it it for 70 minutes as instructed. 

The top came out very fluffy, and it does not have a creamy texture. Instead, it is kinda like an extremely soft bread. Here is a picture: https://imgur.com/a/rvtdMoC


Blemishes in the middle are chocolate, i touched it with chocolatey hands :p

Did I over bake it? :( it‚Äôs for my mother‚Äôs birthday"

cscareerquestions,fniqzur,t1_fnidm3r,1586984825.0,"I get where you are coming from, but I think the sentiment is more about doing a lot of questions to recognize patterns. It‚Äôs not about learning the answer, it‚Äôs learning the techniques in the answers and when a problem requires that technique. 

If anything, the technique is what grinding leetcode ends up being memorized."

ps4homebrew,fn6d55e,t3_fz90od,1586695933.0,"Some only do it for the challenge. I am currently studying computer security and if I found something I probably wouldn‚Äôt release it. So much drama and entitlement can come from the scene, it‚Äôs toxic. Just look at all the drama in the iOS community. It‚Äôs easier to just keep quiet. 

Plus, a lot of people that want a PS4 jailbreak want piracy. People that have the knowledge to exploit a system like the PS4 are usually not in the economic position to need piracy, so they don‚Äôt release despite the upside (homebrew, mods, etc). 

Furthermore, some post proof of concepts as a way to advertise their skills to future employers. That‚Äôs why you see a lot of exploit developers posting their accomplishments on Twitter. Twitter is a great networking tool for people in the security industry."
