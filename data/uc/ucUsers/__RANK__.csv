It doesn't say much about what will happen with classes being online or in person, but I assume that if they do this classes will stay mostly unchanged except for labs and research that must be done in person. It wouldn't make much sense to social distance in dorms and dining halls, only to cram 200 students into a lecture hall where they're within breathing distance of each other (we all know this university doesn't always do what makes sense, though)."

UCSC,fp9tllq,t3_gc57ky,1588434285.0,"Generally, upper divs required by CS majors (any classes that aren't electives on the CS planner) are most problematic because CS is impacted. ML classes (the CSE14x series) can also be tricky to get into because there's a lot happening in that area of CS right now. In my experience, other upper division. CSE classes are usually fine.

As a junior transfer, you'll have *some* seniority from your transfer credits that will give you an earlier registration date than frosh or sophomores. That seniority will continue to improve as you continue to accumulate credit. Once you get to senior year, you shouldn't have too many problems getting into classes as long as you register (exactly) at your registration time. If you wait to register, you're gonna have a bad time."

The policy also says that unless there's a discrepancy verifying a test-taker's identity, the information is destroyed after 7 days. 

The problem I see is that there's wiggle room in the privacy policy to liberally apply the classification of ""discrepancy,"" and to keep records long past the 7-day mark (potentially indefinitely).

UCSC,fneddi1,t3_g18qg8,1586887347.0,"We have quarters here. Our summer and fall quarters both start about 3 weeks later than most semester schools, so if you're replacing your fall semester with our fall quarter, you'll probably have a 4-month summer vacation. If you're replacing your spring semester with our winter and spring quarters, then you'll probably only get 2 months for summer.

A typical quarter class load is 3 classes per quarter compared to 5 at most semester schools, so fall quarter may set you back in terms of credit but winter and spring may put you slightly ahead.

Also an important point regarding the pandemic: all of our scheduled classes are online for the time being. There's no estimation when that might end, and it looks like it might bleed into next year. That means your ""escape"" may virtual in nature. 

As for a recommendation... if you're resilient enough to not mind having the campus closed and classes cancelled at random times with short notice, you'll probably do well here. If you prefer a more regimented and reliable college experience then you may be disappointed. A lot of that has to do with your attitude. Personally, I would go to Hawaii if it was only for one semester, but I would come here if it was for an entire degree."
ucsccola,fmxg0b5,t1_fmwzlow,1586464289.0,">Why should the adminstration neglect to pay its workers enough to live comfortably in Santa Cruz?

This is a completely different question. I'll give you four reasons:
* Grad students are *students*, but the COLA they're asking for ($1400/month) would have them making nearly the same as a lecturer (I know, lecturers are also underpaid; that's a different conversation). Even though TAs boast about doing most of the work to run their classes, they are *not* professors, nor are they lecturers. They're in training, and they can't realistically command the same salaries as those who have completed training. Furthermore, the expectation that a *student worker* should be paid a ""living wage"" is absurd. Being a student isn't a ""living wage"" position in our society. Those spots are reserved for people with real jobs. TL;DR they're unqualified for the amount they're requesting.
* I believe part of the compensation package is the experience of being a grad student, experience teaching a class, and the education that comes with those experiences. No one likes talking about this, but grad students benefit as much from those experiences as the students they teach. I think the tradeoff for that type of free experience is a lower salary. TL;DR grad students benefit from this university in important non-monetary ways that justify lower salaries.
* I actually do think a COLA should be given to keep things even between UCs. I believe that was the offer extended by admin that amounted to ~$200/month. More than that should be requested *on a temporary basis until more permanent solutions are put in place, and the criteria for those permanent solutions should be clear in the COLA language*. That, however is antithetical to what grads are asking. They want a COLA *forever*, which means in all likelihood no permanent solution will ever be found and this university will endure more strikes in the future when the COLA inevitably needs to be adjusted. TL;DR It's a bandaid solution that sets a terrible precedent for future negotiations because, as I mentioned previously, it won't fix the underlying problem.
* The COLA would apply to *all* grad students. Evidently only 80 of them are struggling hard enough to risk their educations by sacrificing their TAships, but in its current form a COLA would be $1400/month for all 2,000 grad students - even those who aren't employed by the university. TL;DR if assistance is to be provided by the ""employer"" then those receiving that assistance should at least be employees.

I could probably think of more because a COLA is such a ridiculous thing to ask for in these circumstances that arguments against it are almost too easy. Also easy: making the big, bad university the scapegoat for poor life decisions instead of owning the consequences of your actions (see my previous message)."
ucsccola,fmwba5j,t1_fmrmzit,1586443360.0,">why should they do any of those things rather than strike? 

I believe this rhetorical question, buried at the end of a paragraph, is the real crux of my issue with the strike. You're essentially asking why 80 grad students *shouldn't* get people riled up and bring the school to its knees so that they won't have to endure the hardship or debt of moving. To me, that represents unfettered selfishness. This school doesn't revolve around the needs of 80 grad students. The needs of grad students *are important*, but there are larger things at stake in the big picture, namely the educations of 18,000 undergraduates and the research endeavors of 1500 other grad students who aren't discontent with the situation.

Further, when asking why these 80 students shouldn't ask to have their needs prioritized above 18,000 of their peers, you fail to admit that there was a way to have dealt with the housing crisis that would have been far more appropriate than being dicks to the undergraduates these grad students were supposed to help educate. There were means that could have been used to fix this problem for *all of us* (do you think some undergraduates don't also use food pantries?), but those means were deemed too mild. Instead COLA chose a me-first, your-needs-are-less-important-than-mine approach. And for that, I think they deserve to reap the consequences of their actions.

Your point is that this will happen again if the university doesn't bow to the pressure coming from an extreme minority of its students, and I think you're right. There's no evidence that grad students have gotten smart enough to take a different tack. In fact, the firings seem to have emboldened outsiders at schools that barely *have* a housing crisis.

*My point* is that asking the university to cave to the demands of the COLA movement absolves the grad students who ultimately made poor life decisions of any of the consequences of their actions. A person who hasn't secured proper funding to attend school shouldn't be in school. Nothing about a PhD is worth starving over. And yes, I agree that school shouldn't be a privilege for the rich, but the way to fix that is to make a systemic change, not advocate for a COLA, a measure that in the best scenario will be outdated in 5 years.

I also argue that these grad students already have some kind of bachelor's degrees that they ought to be able to use to get a job and save money before embarking on their doctorates (that's essentially what I did before making a career change). How does opting *not* to exercise that option give them the right to harass 18,000 undergraduates who don't have a dog in the fight? If their undergraduate fields weren't lucrative enough for gainful employment, then we're back to asking the university to stop everything so it can absolve them of the consequences of their poor life choices."
ucsccola,fmrll2i,t1_fmrho8h,1586326999.0,"I disagree that grad school at UCSC is the only realistic option for a group of people who are supposedly starving. They have bachelor's degrees that they *should* be able to use to find employment in a pinch (if that's somehow not the case then they shouldn't be taking it out on undergraduates). If they were really so hard up, I have no doubt they would exercise this option rather than letting themselves starve. I know I would if I was in that position.

They also absolutely do have the option to go to another school at any time. You're right that it might not be convenient, and it probably won't be a perfect fit, but wouldn't it be better than starving? Again, if it was me who couldn't pay rent or put food on my table with $2400/month (I currently do, while drawing almost exactly that amount from savings each month, but this isn't about me), then I would damn sure change schools or drop out. Sometimes the juice isn't worth the squeeze.

Those are the options I would use if I was in a jam. I stand by my point that just because these people choose not to use, or even to recognize, those options, doesn't mean they aren't viable alternatives to making this university absolutely suck for everyone else."
ucsccola,fmrf9gt,t1_fmr4u8s,1586321498.0,"Well, no, something hasn't ""got to give on the university's side."" The strikers could literally leave. I think the fact that they choose to stay means 1) they're doing fine without their TAships, let alone their COLA, and 2) their goal isn't to put themselves in a position where they can be successful, but to antagonize the rest of the students at this university.

Why waste time fighting to fix something that's so egregiously broken that it probably can't be fixed? It's like trying to ""fix"" an abusive relationship. It will never work out, no matter how hard they try. If they wanted success, they would go to wherever that success is since it obviously won't be here.

Prove me wrong."
ucsccola,fmr3259,t1_fmqsjps,1586312727.0,"Wow. It's been a few weeks since I've been in one of these dumb arguments, and I almost forgot how ridiculous you COLA people can be. While you were lecturing me on the importance of ""good faith"" you wantonly took my statement about the wellness of the universe completely out of context. You see, I wasn't referring to coronavirus at all, but actually to the sweet, sweet karma being served to the strikers right now. That karma doesn't need a virus to make it taste so good. But you already knew what I meant, didn't you? You just changed the subject to score some points in an internet argument you know no one win. 

Now back on topic...

In all sincerity, my hope is that by the time fall quarter rolls around (if the shelter orders are ended by then) the strikers will have either ended their educations entirely or moved to another school where they feel they'll be treated better. I think UCSC would be better off without this trash movement dragging its reputation down and demoralizing the student body, I think the strikers will probably be happier at a school that's within their budget, and I think students will be better served by TAs they can trust to not antagonize them in their effort to get the education they paid for. I think the permanent departure of the strikers from this school would be as close as possible to a win-win for everyone involved.

I'm sure the union will make it so it doesn't play out like that in the end, but in the meantime, hell yes I'm celebrating the current situation. Every day I get to attend class (even if it's online) without having a bunch of entitled clowns blocking my access and interrupting my classes is a victory, and that part of all this feels really fucking *good*, man."
ucsccola,fmqlg3u,t1_fmqhg38,1586301942.0,"Honestly, man, the closest I can come to imagining myself in their position is either 1) being fired with cause, in which case I would be falling all over myself to accept this terrible offer so that I could fix some of the damage I had done while getting fired in the first place, or 2) being fired *without* cause, in which case there wouldn't be enough money in the world to make me go back to that job. These TAs should be 1s, but they're acting like 2s. 

The funny thing is that the TAs had a good thing going - free tuition, free healthcare, a healthy stipend that, although may have been too small, was actually keeping most of their bills paid. And now that they've ruined that for themselves, you want me to believe they're being treated unfairly? I think these clowns are getting what people who got *fired with cause* deserve. If they wanted security, they should have turned in grades before admin's deadline. Now the good offers are gone and they have this one instead. And all is right in the universe."
ucsccola,fmqg1jk,t1_fmpoyz3,1586298915.0,">imagine for a second that you were someone witholding grades who was fired over it

I'm sorry, I can't. Having been an undergraduate, I can't imagine myself putting undergraduates through that kind of stress. I can't imagine myself being so arrogant as to not heed the many, many warnings and deadlines from the administration, and many many cries of protest from those who were deprived of access to the university. I can't imagine myself being so self righteous as to ask a union to protect me and ensure I continue to receive a paycheck I didn't earn after I refused for months to do my job. I just can't. My empathy has realistic limits. 

Now let your pleas for empathy fall on the same deaf ears our pleas to open the campus did last quarter."
UCSC,fmnddfc,t3_fw6yn9,1586223517.0,"Congrats!

I transferred into CE last year. I recommend transfer academy (I think they call it summer edge now). We did a cool scavenger hunt that took us all over campus so we would know our way around (the trails kind of look the same at first so it's easy to get turned around when you're new). They also gave some great pointers for using campus resources like the career center and for approaching professors about research opportunities. Some of those things will be lacking since summer quarter will probably be online this year, but still might be a good way to get acquainted with the university.

If you house hunt when other students aren't looking, during the last week of Spring quarter, for example, you might find a nice place for a reasonable price (I did). Most students live on the west side of the San Lorenzo river. If you want to live on the east side, you'll probably need a car (and don't forget to buy a parking pass over the summer, they sell out fast). And please don't underestimate how expensive it can be to live here.

Professors are mostly great. I recommend Miller for CSE120 and CSE130 when he teaches them, Tantalo for CSE101 and CSE102, and Cardenas for CSE132. I'm taking CSE142 from Liu and CSE138 from Kuper now. They're both fantastic so far. The rest of my upper divs have been CE, not CS (they're in the same dept, so you could take them, but most CS don't). 

I hope this is helpful and that you love it here! It's a great school with plenty of opportunities if you're aggressive about finding them."
UCSC,fmmd153,t1_fmm2eh7,1586203071.0,"I'm CE, which is adjacent to CS. I've had a couple of quarters where I had to take classes I wasn't excited about because they were the only ones with space available. Thankfully, as students accumulate credits, their enrollment priority increases, so by the time they get to fourth year, most can get what they need to graduate. The interim, especially lower division classes, are the most frustrating."
