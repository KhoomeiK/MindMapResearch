On top of that, I'm sure the pandemic doesn't help at all in building relationships or focusing academically. This year certainly isn't a good measure of a standard college experience. Regardless of where you go, remember that you decide your experience. UCLA may not necessarily be better for you. Managing academic stress and making friends may not be easier. It all depends on how you go about things and make yourself happy.

in terms of operating systems, it doesn't matter as much to me because both mac os and windows have their difficulties. just go on stackoverflow if you run into issues with software installation or bugs. you don't necessarily have to buy a laptop with linux since you can use virtual machines. also, check your school, they might have free os for you (my school provides windows 10 education or RedHat Enterprise Linux).

* If you earned a grade of D+, D. D-, or F and have taken the course only once, you must take the course for a letter grade because courses previously taken for a letter grade may only be repeated for a letter grade.\*
* After repeating a course, both grades will show on the transcript, but only the most recent grade will be calculated into your GPA. As a general rule, when repeating a course for the first time, it is the 2nd attempt that counts. 
* From A201.D.2: Repetition of a course more than once requires, in all instances, approval of the Dean of the College, School or Division in which the student is enrolled at the time the course is repeated. Without this approval, a course repeated more than once will not be included in the grade-point average, but a passing grade in the repeated course will be accepted in satisfaction of unit requirements for the degree.

[https://eecs.berkeley.edu/resources/undergrads/cs/transfer-prereqs/faq](https://eecs.berkeley.edu/resources/undergrads/cs/transfer-prereqs/faq). Ohh, wait. I think I understand you now. 47B is required if the CC data structures class only fulfills a partial requirement?"
berkeley,foo8nt4,t1_foo6988,1587934652.0,"Yeah, it's a bummer. If I had the option to choose, I would still pick Hilfinger. I actually enjoyed Hilfinger's 61B. His lectures were boring, but he teaches very well. Very knowledgeable and the way he lectures makes things understandable. His projects are relatively similar or even the same across semesters. The nice part about his class is, like you said, is how projects are weighted heavier. I didn't do particularly well on his midterms but I did well on his projects."
berkeley,foo6yiv,t1_foo4tqn,1587933708.0,"Ah, I see. I know that the Calc requirements are able to be waived. However, I thought if you take a Data Structures class at a CC you must submit some kind of form to the department. It's not guaranteed that they will honor the CC class."
berkeley,foo4be3,t1_foo06n5,1587932233.0,"I don't think most CC college classes can be used to fulfill major requirements, especially for the classes needed for declaration."
berkeley,fonv4kg,t3_g8jso0,1587927062.0,"You can withdraw from school and then reapply. Reapply in the sense that you fill out some paperwork to notify them you are coming back. I forgot how many semester you are allowed to do that for though (might also depend on personal circumstances). To be honest, I think you just met the wrong people freshman year. Some of my friends are from freshman year, but I met more friends through classes, clubs, and events freshman year onwards. You could always try music on the side (as a hobby or contract work) while you are getting your college degree? I think dropping out of school and pursuing your passion is great but you need to put more thought into it. Music is a tough industry to bust into. If you don't make money, then your parents' savings will be going towards supporting you. Money can only last so long."
berkeley,folwti2,t1_foltnhs,1587872384.0,so ur abusive ...
berkeley,foluv5i,t1_folto63,1587871030.0,Yikes. You should probably try selling it then :((.
berkeley,folri0o,t1_folr77o,1587868767.0,if she's okay with that then go you ....
berkeley,folraj3,t3_g86aqy,1587868630.0,You could try a shipping company? Rent a U-Haul? Try your luck and post on Free & For Sale or Marketplace?
berkeley,folr5nl,t1_folpw71,1587868543.0,off topic but thats no way to treat a girl
berkeley,fokwr7o,t3_g807er,1587850417.0,"You can message me to learn more about the CS life. However, I think you should worry about these questions after you get accepted. Just apply to the UC's your interested in since they all use the same application (shouldn't be stuck there)."
berkeley,fokg0pf,t1_fokf7d7,1587841379.0,"That's true, which is why I said happiness is provided by yourself. You know how to keep yourself happy. In certain cases, being content may be the answer."
berkeley,fokev56,t1_fojroyh,1587840773.0,"Having the right mindset is good though. Regardless of what life throws at you, remember that you are in control. Your happiness is not provided by other people or other things. It's provided by yourself. Reality might be tough, but the mentality is what keeps you going. Being happy can take you a long way."
berkeley,fokej25,t3_g7v44m,1587840595.0,im not sure wat ur tryna do by posting a lot of political and controversial stuff
berkeley,foke8w6,t3_g7ud42,1587840443.0,"My parents, like a lot of people I know, are immigrants. They worked hard to attend college in the U.S. without taking a penny from their family. Over the years, they achieved higher education and worked better jobs. Eventually, they were able to secure citizenship. The process was lengthy but intensely tough. You should really respect immigrants regardless of their legal status. Everyone is contributing something to society and is working hard to provide for their family. A lot of the tech industry have positions filled by immigrants. The less fortunate immigrants may work labor-intensive jobs (such as in agriculture, which means they basically are feeding you by providing their service). They didn't choose to live a hard life by immigrating illegally. If they had a choice, I'm sure they would want to live comfortably without having to fear being discovered and deported every single day."
