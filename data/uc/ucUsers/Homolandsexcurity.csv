We also have greyhound busses to go between states. Also obesity is mostly a problem because in a lot of areas, healthy food is more expensive or too far away for people to make an investment in going to get it. And then the cycle continues because people dont learn healthy eating habits for the purpose of self care, it is mostly through fear and shame that people get taught to ""eat healthy"", which doesn't solve the over arching problems of food deserts and lack of resources (that and the food banks, at least where i am, often give food that is on the verge of spoiling, if not already moldy)."

Dont waste your youth on a 30 year old who chooses to live this way. I have a friend who is going through something similar. You gotta get out before the water gets hotter. Also, consider: where's the baby mama? Why isn't she in the picture?"
