UnsentLetters,fpmy8sr,t3_geeeq1,1588744863.0,">you wanted me for years. you pursued me. your attention scared me but i guess i found it flattering too. i should’ve known when we were 12 years old and you ignored me for two weeks after i made some stupid joke at you that this wouldn’t work. i should’ve known when we were 15 and i showed no romantic interest in you and you tried to guilt me and act like you owned me that it wouldn’t work. i should’ve known when we were 16 and you set your hand on fire and told me you loved me but it was my fault that it wouldn’t work. i should’ve known when we were 17 and i finally agreed to go on a date with you and you asked to kiss me and i said no because i wasn’t ready for anything serious and you screamed at me in the car all the way home and i walked inside sobbing that it wouldn’t work.

&nbsp;

>i shouldn’t have agreed to a second date. i shouldn’t have said yes when you asked to be my boyfriend. it happened so fast. you knew what you were doing. that i was fragile and afraid of your anger. you knew how to bend and twist my reality to make you seem like you’re the only one who cares. you isolated me from my friends. you belittled me. you made me feel so incredibly insignificant. invalid. weak. and i thought it was love. you never really knew or understood me.

&nbsp;

>you liked being able to turn me into whoever you wanted me to be. and even your distorted perception of who i am wasn’t enough. you still cheated. and i didn’t even find out until after the breakup. you loved my body. you loved that you could easily over power me. you loved that i became incapable of saying no. you never loved me. any display of emotion was weak or irrelevant. my anxiety was a problem because it inconvenienced you. even when i finally realized how evil you are and tried to end it you talked me into a break. i cried for two days feeling so trapped and like i’d never escape you. even after you ended it, you still haunt me.

&nbsp;

>you still made yourself my responsibility. you showed up so close to my house to meet up for coffee when my mom was dying. you knew that. you blamed me breaking up with you on my mental health deteriorating because of my moms health. before that you saw “mental health” as “an excuse to be a bitch”. i hate you. i hate you. i will never make a mistake as stupid as dating you for two years ever again.

Friendzone,fpmxgcn,t3_geeaq3,1588744275.0,">Alright so I’m explaining this to the best of my ability on here I’ll jump all over this but bear with me because I really need other people’s perspectives on this... I can’t handle these overwhelming thoughts anymore.     So, I’m in recovery...I met this guy through recovery. He had (and still has) more time sober than me. First couple of convos we clicked and it truly felt like I’ve known him all my life. He has some mental illnesses he deals with as do I which helped me open up to him a lot more than I already was about my life and myself. He was/is always understanding and has been there for me more than my bestfriend that I’ve known for 11 years.

&nbsp;

>I’m talking about listening to me cry at 1am for hours on the phone and tell me it hurt him to hear me cry, would never complain about these long calls and give me his best advice if there was advice to give, if not he would sit there and let me get everything out. I went through a lot around this time and was fresh in recovery again. Been in and out of recovery for a while now. Well, I fell for him around this time. I could not get him out of my head and was and still is the first person I talked to about anything in my life. When we first started hanging out it was always just as friends.

&nbsp;

>Then some touchy feely came into play and we started having sex but still hang out with each other afterwards. I asked him one day  how he felt about me and he said he liked me a lot and that there’s definitely sexual attraction there , I told him I liked him a lot as well and was told to go with the flow of things... As some time passed of continuing to hang out and have sex, I went all in on telling him how I feel no hesitation through text. I was told he wasn’t looking for anything serious and that maybe sometime in the future there’s a chance for us to be something that I still need to put in a lot of work on myself.

&nbsp;

>I was crushed by this. Hurt. My heart felt like it was stomped on and that he was only saying that to make it sound like there’s hope in the future because he felt bad for me. We would still hang out but I started talking to other guys and having sex with them on and off and it always ended bad...still in and out of recovery during all this... and still coming to him about how I felt about him. He was still there for me, He would always give me advice on how to turn my life around and be able to stay in recovery too I just never listened because I just wasn’t ready to be done yet.

&nbsp;

>This cycle of finding other men to fill the whole I felt and relapsing on drugs and alcohol continued for a while until I decided to pull my head out my ass and get my life together. I’ve known him for 9 months now and he’s still around in my life... This time, I have time sober in recovery and making big changes in my life and I’m really putting in the effort to stay sober and become a better version of myself. We are still friends and we started having sex again but without kissing to avoid the emotional part I guess (not my idea, his) This time around I’m not having sex with anyone else or trying to find some guy to talk to.

&nbsp;

>We still hang out after having sex too, Like take naps and watch shows or movies, laugh, talk, for hours. I still have these feelings for him and he knows that and I just don’t know what it truly is between us and it kills me because it’s never expressed and if it is semi talked about it had always been through text. I don’t want to keep wasting my time... like if we are just going to be friends, then I don’t want sex involved anymore... if there’s a possibility of a future and he feels something for me, then I want him to tell me and just tell me what the intentions are with all of this back and fourth.

&nbsp;

>I truly feel like all this has made me lose my mind and as you can see I’m probably all over the place with typing this. Someone just tell me what you think and I hope you made it this far. I need it. Thanks.

footballmanagergames,fpmugik,t3_gedv13,1588742043.0,">I’m Annan athletic and have rose from Labrokes league 2 all the to the premiership. But after being in the Labrokes championship for 2-3 years I bought a youth player from jueventus named Marco Vitale, he was in the last year in his deal, unhappy and there agent asked if I could take a look. He was a beast, way better than any of my other strikers. So I bought him for 0$ at the end of his deal and his contract was double anyone else’s cause I assumed I’d make money by selling him cause he’s 18. He plays a year, does awesome and we lose in a promotional playoff. In the off-season good ole Rangers comes for him because the only way he’d sign was if he had a release clause to higher divisions for 850k.

&nbsp;

>So rangers make an offer, he wants to leave, I get them to pay it. Other teams in the championship were interested but I didn’t wanna play against him and thought it could be a funny storyline if I make it up another level. Well this man gets loaned to newly relegated St.Mirren the next season and I come in 2nd and St.Mirren come in 3rd in the next year... Plus every time I played them he’s scored. Even had a presser ask if I could stop him since he’s scored 4 out of 4 games. In the first leg we draw 1-1, then in the second leg I’m up 3-2 and of course in the 80th minute this man bends a shot right around my keeper...

&nbsp;

>Now I’m hysterical not sure what to do with myself. We go into overtime and I score right away so I’m feeling good. But once again this (explicit word) scores a lightening beam in the 114th minute. Now I’m pacing like a lunatic freaking out. Laughing at the storyline but inside dying. It goes to penalty shootouts and he of course hits. Luckily tho there 4th taker hits a doozy at my keeper and we score all 5 and advance and we end up stomping raith who are in the premiership in my save and finallllly advance to the top league. This is my first year having the game and I think this has been the strongest amount of emotions/spiritual experience in my life.

&nbsp;

>This storyline was beautiful (cause I won) and this has been the only save where Ive never had to many of those moments where I want to start a new one. Annan athletic has gained a new fan, even tho I’m from a place where they call football soccer. Anyways I’m getting to deep here, football manager what an addiction, what a game

conspiracytheories,fpmn841,t3_geco53,1588736852.0,">SRA is real. They are an organized society that is actively working as we speak there are satanists and proof of organized abuse in large amount. These people are in large numbers and finding more and more people to convert and are trying to corrupt our world. They are in practically all levels of society and operate unlike the average good person. They use their power and the fact that people dont assume how bad someone could be to operate. Much like underground pedo rings and drug trafficking rings. Please inquire and look deeply into this. Alot of our media has influence by this group, they cover up info and they stiffle investigations. Both US and UK governments have had huge criminal convictions involving SATANIC RITUAL ABUSE look it up.

&nbsp;

>Jimmy Saville was one of them and he didnt get uncovered till he died due to media repeatedly protecting him. These people are smart and cunning like many other organized crime, but not unstoppable and certainly not untouchable. Do what you can to look deeply into this problem, protect our children. This is a huge topic and requires alot more research and coverage to uncover and stop these cults of organized abuse. These people are in the many and are deep in all aspects of life, they often times position themselves in places where they are easily sheltered and have access to at risk people(Child Protection Services, School Teachers, Care Takers and even Judges.) in order to abuse them and use them for what they see fit.

&nbsp;

>The abuse is all about power and control and the abuse of it, which is a very common thing that humans struggle with this cult uses this sick aspect of humanity the part of us that makes other humans rape and kill and hurt others and make it their mantra. They use the worst types of abuse in order to control others and manipulate and mold them into what they want and it is often times very organized involving many multiples of people with lots of planning and terrible intents. This needs to be talked about and if you need resources < a great book is SATANIC RITUAL ABUSE:Principles of treatment by Colin Ross. This is a great resource that shows how real and sinister Satanic Ritual Abuse is in society and how it can easily be covered up and right under our noses

BreakUps,fpm9nhf,t3_geamdc,1588728401.0,">My ex with ADHD broke up with me 2 days ago and it was not mutual. We were gonna reach our 3 months tomorrow. In the beginning of the relationship we were okay. Had tiny ups and downs but we made it through. We had a goofy relationship and i loved that. When I was sad he would comfort me by giving me tight hugs and his shoulders to cry on. Things were going great until quarantine happened, even though we facetimed eachother everyday, not physically being together was difficult. Then problems started happening. I missed him even more and wanted his attention more but I didn’t know how to tell him. Because we’re stuck at home, all he did was game all day. My messages were always on delivered and my snaps were ignored.

&nbsp;

>I called him and tried talking with him about this issue and he’d improve the next day. He’d give good morning calls and would text me to check up on me throughout the day and facetime me at night until he fell asleep. But then the next day it went back to square 1, being ignored again. The first time this happened, I planned to go to his place the day(I just had to see him again once during this pandemic), before he suggested to take a break because he didnt feel like he was ready for a relationship. I went to him, made every minute with him count. He then said that he didnt want to take a break anymore because he couldnt fully let me go.

&nbsp;

>Later that week, the previous problems occurred again and I got frustrated and talked to his mom. She told me what i should be aware of, and things i shouldnt do because of his condition. Our conversation hit me and i was determined to work things out again with him and talked to him sincerely. I wanted to fight for us. It seemed like he heard me out and understood my point. Then the next day I called him a couple times (I assumed he went to the washroom because he doesn’t ignore my calls) to check up on him. He picked up the call, and yelled at me to stop calling him because he was losing in his game and hung up.

&nbsp;

>Later we call again to talk about us, how we can fix it. He said he’d forgotten what I said the night before, because he was tired. I tried to tell him that we can make this work but he couldnt take it anymore and ended it. Just like that he gave up on me. I’ve been constantly crying ever since and talked with a lot of my friends about it. Then one of his friends told me because they didnt want to hide it from me, that right after breaking up with me he downloaded datings apps and started talking to someone new and got her number already. He was serious when he said he wasn’t ready for a relationship but after finding this out it completely broke me.

&nbsp;

>He told me before that he wanted me in his life forever. Now im lost and just fucking depressed. I’m only wondering why he did what he did.

newtothenavy,fpm3ecu,t3_ge9n8b,1588724749.0,">I had a question about this form. Have any of you been contacted by a private investigator or something regarding this form- or has this form come back to haunt any of you after you completed it? There are so many questions and different components of this form that you have to fill out, I'd be surprised if whoever is in charge of this form would go through every component of it for every person that completes it. Essentially the reason why I am asking this, is because while completing it I noticed there is a part asking where you have attended school. No problem, I don't mind sharing where I have went to college. HOWEVER, if someone were to look into this and contact the university there is a chance they would find out that I have been in trouble due to the fact I was formally punished for it and it was documented.

&nbsp;

>I'm not saying I'm worried for them to find out I have been in trouble before, it's just what is was for which I am worried about. I have been filling out all other military documents including this one saying I have never tried drugs, not only because my piss is clean(and I've checked) but also because I don't partake in that anymore. I was never an addict, just a dumbass teen ""experimenting"". But if they ever were to contact this college and find out, things I said regarding drugs on this form and others wouldn't add up and I don't want to lose my opportunity to serve.

&nbsp;

>It should also be noted I wasn't in trouble with police, I was just disciplined by the college. So I am turning to you guys to see if this is something I should worry about or not. I am sure I am not the only person trying to join the military with some skeletons in my closet. I am also sure I am not the only applicant who has experimented with drugs before, I unfortunately just got caught. I am sure every branch has to fill this out, and it doesn't seem likely that these people would fact check every single component of this document for every single person. Thanks in advance.

AgeGapRelationship,fplukgb,t3_ge87ok,1588719756.0,">This was my first age gap relationship. I am 32F and he was 22M. I have always looked much younger than I am and he thought I was his age when we met. He has always been very sensitive and he liked to fight about nothing. I was the one always apologizing and being calm. Anytime there was an issue he would not be able to control his mouth and would say things he shouldn't. I brought this up several times and asked him why we can't just talk like adults. He was very insecure and I went out of my way to make him feel secure and be sensitive to his feelings. What ended things was he felt I keeping something from him and he didn't believe me when I said I wasn't.

&nbsp;

>He of course got upset and started saying things he shouldn't. So I pointed it out to him and told him I don't feel loved when he does that. . That when he says those horrible things they stay in my head. He just went on to try and turn it around on me saying I'm hiding something from him. He has done this in the past and I have just let him but this last time I was sticking to my guns. So, he broke up with me. He said he's not good enough for me and I deserve better. I was so hurt and shocked I didn't say anything. The next day he said he thinks it's for the best and he wishes me the best.

&nbsp;

>That was the most calm he had ever been so in my head he was just DONE. He had posted a few cryptic messages on FB that I just ignored. He then deleted me from Facebook all together. He had told me on several occasions that he was always friends with his exes and that he would with me if we ever split. I asked him about it and he said he was hurting and didn't want anyone to have resentment. We ended things peacefully so I'm so confused. Am I missing something? Did I do something wrong for things to end the way they did? I know I should just move on but it's so hard.

Renters,fplnm0r,t3_ge74uq,1588715989.0,">I’ve been renting a room (more of a patio with sliding doors) out of a house month to month in Los Angeles from a frugal but usually fair landlord. He lives in the garage in the same house. Before I moved in, he warned me that the ceiling would leak from time to time when it rains (which was at the time an uncommon occurrence in LA). Because it’s more of patio than a room it gets very hot and very cold, but I didn’t mind because of the good price. Over time, it started to rain. The leaks grew from one spot to many spots and progressively got worse every “rainy season”. I would let the landlord know and he would always provide a band aid solution that would help for a bit but then things would quickly go back to how they were.

&nbsp;

>It became apparent that he didn’t want to pour any money into the roof if he didn’t have to. I sometimes would like to have a guest visit or stay overnight and it was impossible to do if it was raining and leaking from multiple areas of the ceiling. I sent my landlord a text asking if there was a permanent solution and he said he would see what he could do. He finally realized that I was serious about the problem and called in some professionals that fixed up the roof for a couple grand. After it was finished I was notified by my landlord that he would be increasing my rent by 25% in 30 days.

&nbsp;

>I was taken aback as this was obviously not mentioned before he decided to fix the roof. I told him this couldn’t have come at a worse time as I was recently furloughed from my job (I may return June 1 but am taking my employer’s word with a grain of salt). He said he would give me some time to “get back up on my feet” but as far as he’s concerned the room will he now costing what he calls “market value”. I’m open to a rent increase, I just think 25% is too steep given the situation. I haven’t told the other renters in the house and I don’t really have anyone to talk with about this so I would love to hear your opinions.

&nbsp;

>Am I being selfish?

AsianParentStories,fpln1f5,t3_ge71na,1588715684.0,">Does anyone have any insight into why my AP-inlaws would have instantly loved my Kansas SIL (who married my husband's brother).  Husband's family is from Singapore (Chinese).  From day one, they loved her and she really did not meet any of the typical criteria--she had no degree, her family were hillbillies, her mom was obese and addicted to gambling.  My BIL (husband's brother) had to tell Kansas SIL to finish her degree.   Like I don't want to sound like a jerk, but Kansas SIL also was not overly attractive.  Like she just didn't care if you know what I mean.   Now, I don't really care about externals like that, but my in-laws sure do!  You know what I mean?

&nbsp;

> Money, real estate, education, physical appearance--they are your typical APs.  I had a degree (that my husband did not have tell me to get), I had an amazing career, money, and a good family.  I also was attractive in that I knew how to fix myself up in the conventional ways (you know, put together an outfit, make-up, etc).  Plus, my family has been very financially generous to my husband, AND, very, very welcoming to my Chinese in-laws.  Yet, it was never, ever enough.  They would tear apart my mother and grandmother, constantly finding fault with them--meanwhile Kansas SIL's mom was an obsese gambling addict who could do no wrong.  Kansas SIL could get away with all types of stuff I would never dream of--and the harder I tried, the less I was respected.

&nbsp;

>  17 years in and I still get emails from MIL raving about Kansas SIL.  ""Kansas SIL is out feeding the homeless.""  ""Kansas SIL is so loving and kind and the most amazing mother.""  Like, I could so all those things too but I'm just seen as a piece of garbage!  (BTW, I am from Vancouver and in-laws all used to live here--but no word of a lie, they gave up Vancouver, second home to Asians, and moved to Kansas).  Is this just part of the mind games APs love?  Recently I was just fed up and when I got an email from MIL praising Kansas SIL I said that maybe she would like my husband to marry Kansas SIL.

&nbsp;

maleinfertility,fplgmfi,t3_ge60vr,1588712349.0,">Okay so I'm going to get super personal here. I've talked to some people on here because I have high sex binding hormone, which is eating up all my testosterone. Causing tiredness and fatigue 24/7, mild Ed, low sex drive Etc. With my ex-wife, when I met her she was on estrogen. After she stopped taking estrogen, I lost attraction for her. Sexual attraction comes from pheromones. So I believe once you stop taking estrogen it lowered her pheromones. I still would have sex with her, but the desire wasn't there. Fast forward to now, and my current wife doesn't get wet during sex. My new wife is very inexperienced sexually. Never had an orgasm, never masturbated xcetera. So I don't expect her to have an orgasm with intercourse just yet.

&nbsp;

>The issue is her not getting wet. I can make her orgasm with oral, every time. I know she's not Faking It, because when she has an orgasm she grabs onto me and holds me in a bear hug until the orgasm subsides. Also it gets to the point where me touching her clitoris she can't take it anymore. It's too sensitive and she crosses her legs so I stopped. This is a sure sign of orgasm. Still after having a good orgasm she's not wet. I understand this could be a hormone problem on her end, but I'm suspecting my low testosterone, is affecting my pheromones, and possibly why her body doesn't go into full arousal including getting a wet.

&nbsp;

>Obviously the oral feels good and so does the orgasm, but if I don't have enough pheromones her body may not be reacting by producing lubrication. I've had some discussion with a couple people here that's helped me go in the right direction. My binding hormone is eating up all my free testosterone. I'm on Clomid, and I just reduced the dose to 12.5 mg. Someone suggested enclomiphene. Problem with that is getting it. There's only one place I found in the country and it's in Florida. At the moment it's cost-prohibitive. They want me to redo blood Labs that I just had done by the other doctor. My primary care would gladly prescribe it, but it's technically in the trial phase since 1983.

&nbsp;

>I'm not sure how that clinic in Florida is able to prescribe it. I don't live in Florida so it would be a televisit. Some guys have done better with enclomiphene then Clomid. Since it's not an option I'm going to try HCG. I'm praying this will increase my testosterone but not raise my sex binding hormone. My appointment is on the 12th pray for me. Anybody else believe that they're having a traction issues or wetness issues due to their low hormones? Also my wife doesn't initiate sex. She never turns me down and is always willing, but she doesn't initiate. This could be due to hormones, or her just being very conservative. She was raised in the country where you save yourself for your husband.

&nbsp;

>She was taught to act meek, and ladylike. Don't get me wrong she's no prude. She's willing to do oral, which I actually had a Google so I could explain it to her believe it or not. LOL. So there's many factors here that can be affecting her wetness. I'd love to know if anybody else has gone through anything similar. I didn't use a throwaway cuz I don't know anybody here anyways. LOL

BBW,fplewe2,t3_ge5qge,1588711478.0,">I can’t concentrate on the meeting I’m currently sitting in on. Distracted by the overwhelming masculinity next to me. I can’t help but to be completely turned on by you. Your sexy body, large hands and broad shoulders, my pussy aches for your touch. I can’t help myself. Under the table I slightly touch the top of your knee and begin to massage it gently. Then my hand slides up your thigh, I find your semi hard cock and begin to massage it through your pant leg. Soon your hands slips under my skirt and begins to rub my clit through my lace panties. By the time the presentation is over I’m dripping wet and your rock solid and wanton. Intermission of the conference takes place and we are alone..

&nbsp;

>You stand, unzip your pants allowing your hardness to spring free, dropping to my knees you tease my lips with your cock before slowly pushing it into my hot, wet mouth and with a handful of my hair you start fucking my face. Drooling and gagging on your thick, solid cock, you pull out with a “pop” before lifting me on to the conference room table. Your hand slides into place between my wet thighs and begin ripping through my black lace panties. Kneeling before me cock in hand, stroking and taunting me. You lift my leg and place it over your shoulder and lick my inner thigh until your at my pussy. My head rolls back as your tongue slips in between my pussy lips.

&nbsp;

>Moaning and grunting can be heard but we don’t care. Your tongue and lips are covering my clit, licking and sucking. Juices dripping as you slip a finger inside and behind to fuck me. Soon Your tongue and finger has me at the edge and about to burst. Stopping abruptly, you stand wrapping my legs around your waist and lifting me just enough to slip your hardness inside my soaking wet pussy. A few thrusts in, you lift me completely off the table and turn so that my back is against the wall. Your hands grip my ass cheeks for leverage and fuck my pussy. You have to kiss me to control my moans. Soon we begin to switch positions once again.

&nbsp;

>This time I take control and push you on to the table before crawling atop you. Facing away from you I slide down your rock hard thickness and start to grind. Hands on the table for leverage as I fuck you hard and fast. My Tits are swinging in rhythm. Loud grunts and sexy moans fill the room as we are close to climaxing. The next thing I know you grab my arms, bring my back to your chest, stretching my body and pussy as you thrust harder and faster. Your hand clasps around my neck lightly, reaching around your strum my clit. Throwing me into the most intense and amazing orgasm imaginable. Soon your climax matches mine as you stick the fingers that were just in my pissy into my mouth and I begin to suck.

&nbsp;

>Our bodies quiver and shake from the release. No time to catch a breath. We pull ourselves together just moment before the conference room door swings open and our colleagues enter the room. We take our seats next to one another and the meeting continues as if nothing happened.

dating,fpl50xf,t3_ge45c5,1588706486.0,"> I need your help everyone my husband is my first real boyfriend. He's done things that have made me really resentful. He says it's normal in the dating world for men to do these things I'll tell you the story and you can decide. Wen I met my husband he was visiting my hometown on vacation. We went on two dates and I was head over heels for him. It may seem crazy but I knew I wanted to marry him from our second date but he lived in a whole other city so I knew it wasn't going anywhere. He went back to his hometown and started dating other people and I continued on with my life but we never lost contact we still chatted online.

&nbsp;

>I noticed he posted on Facebook about dating two girls and one of them called it quits and the other started ignoring him and was clearly involved with someone else as a total wtf about his dating life. Than randomly he messaged me  professing he really missed me and wanted to come fly out to visit me and wanted to be my boyfriend (but only wen we were in the same city) . I agreed to the arrangement cause it's hard for most monogamous long distance relationships to work. He came by to my city  and it was a magical experience for me. I thought our relationship would progress to a serious one but wen he flew back home he was a lot colder to me than usual.

&nbsp;

>He did pay for my online internet access to play games together but he was wayyyy more distant than before so I confronted him. He told me he wasn't over an ex of his and that's y . (Which later on he confessed was a lie he told me because he was just trying to either get rid of me or create distance because he was talking to other girls and didn't want me too attached to him) Heartbroken I told him I would give him time to figure out whether he really wants to be with me. Which I did. I continued dating other men while he continued talking to other girls. We still communicated online but it wasn't the same intensity.

&nbsp;

>4 months later right after I got a boob job and sent him a titty pic he told me he's been thinking a lot about us and doesn't wanna lose me and wants to come to my city and try to live here permanently. I agreed. We dated more and he was a wonderful boyfriend nooo complaints from me.  he ended up proposing to me. I accepted. Than shortly before we got married one of the girls he dated contacts him and he shows a screenshot of him saying ""ummm I'm getting married"" and she seemingly apologizes and backs up. Later on that week We got married.  Months past and I find a pic of an old-time ex girlfriend in lingerie in his phone that was saved back when we started officially as a couple.

&nbsp;

>He swore he just saved it from an online posting she did to just look at. I demand he deletes it. He does but than he secretly follows her on Instagram. I catch that he's still following her so he deletes her off Instagram. I was ready to leave him and he cried to me begging to stay. I demanded him to come clean about anything I should know about. he confesses that when we officially became a couple he secretly went on a trip  to visit a female friend out of state but didn't tell me cause It was a girl and he knew I would trip out about it.he

&nbsp;

>swore she was only ever a friend and had the girl call me to verify they have only ever been friends but than she also made the comment that she had no idea he was dating anyone when he came to see her which is why  she was shocked when he told her he was married. after the phone call my husband began to cry and beg me for my forgiveness and his dishonesty earlier when we dated and I forgave him. But I feel like hes settling for me and doesn't want me but he obviously does as it's not easy for us to be together since he had to basically gave up his old life to move here.

&nbsp;

>I wanna be a good wife but I basically feel pathetic for chasing a man who I kinda feel never really wanted me all that much. He claims that his behaviour while not the best is normal male dating behavior and it usually takes men awhile to get there head straight. Is this true?

FootFetishTalks,fpl43tp,t3_ge407t,1588706016.0,">Ok so my first post telling this story didn’t seem to resonate well with the audience. Ppl were saying it was hard to follow and then I was just being a bitch to them but I realized how bad it was and now I’m just gonna rewrite it. So like 3 years ago I had a boyfriend and he had a friend who well call Jack. My boyfriend told me Jack had a foot/sock fetish. Eventually Me and my boyfriend broke up and his whole friend group hated me. But like 2 years later me and Jack became friends again and we’ve been best friends since then but this whole sock thing has never came up. The Other night he was at my house and he was telling me I should start an only fans or start selling nudes or like used panties and stuff for money which I thought was funny.

&nbsp;

>But then I asked if he had a sock fetish, which I already knew but I asked Bc his suggestion about selling that type of stuff online sparked my curiosity. Immediately he was embarrassed but I kept poking at him Bc I wanted him to talk about it. But essentially I thought his sock fetish was just like if he sees a girl in some knee high socks he gets turned on. Like I just thought it was a visual thing and he was embarrassed when he told me there’s more to it so I asked him what his sock fetish really entailed.

&nbsp;

>He basically told me he likes the smell of feet and worn socks and I laughed and thought it was really funny and I could tell he was even more embarrassed now. So Bc he’s such a good friend and I felt bad for making him tell me about it I tried to make up for it. I was wearing a pair of white balega ankle socks all day and I’m sure they didn’t smell too good so I put my foot in his face “on accident” and he sniffed like really hard lol. And when I moved my foot he was smiling super hard and he just said “wow”. I laughed and that was pretty much it.

&nbsp;

>But now I’m worried he’s gonna try to be all up on my feet when he’s with me and I don’t want that but I did think it was fun to tease him a little bit. Any suggestions on what I should do moving forward? We hangout like every other day by the way so I would appreciate any answers ASAP. Hope my story wasn’t shitty again lol!!

writers,fpl2e0s,t3_ge3rij,1588705158.0,">Hour one of my six-hour layover. I wandered around, lost within the chaos of people rushing to wherever they needed to be. It was nighttime, and the large windows allowed everyone inside the airport to see the bright lights of incoming planes, the runways, transport cars, and the distant skyline. I walked over to the gate of my connecting flight. I decided I can take a quick nap there and explore around after if I am lucky with time. I arrived at my gate and sat beside a large window. No one was around me. I got comfortable, put my suitcase in front of me, and lifted my legs and rested them on top of the suitcase. Just as I was about to fall into my slumber, someone tapped me on my right shoulder.

&nbsp;

>I turned to look. A woman, who looked to be around my age, was looking back at me. She was wearing a maroon coat and crimson lipstick. Her complexion was olive gold and her hair had the color of deep coffee. Her eyes were sharp and her lips were small. She had high cheekbones which stood out because she had an exaggerated simper. She asked me if I had a phone charger. Her voice was quiet but angelic. Had a strong British accent. I gave her my charger which she accepted graciously. I sat back in my chair, looking straight ahead. My heart was beating against my chest. My face was starting to get warmer.

&nbsp;

>I glanced at her again through the corner of my eyes. She was looking at her phone with a smile. I yearned to have a conversation with her but I rejected the idea quickly. I did not want to appear like a bother. I turned away from her and looked out the window. An airplane was taxiing across. The lights from the wings shined brightly. All of a sudden, the woman asked me for my name. I turned around quickly. Her alluring, amber-colored eyes were entrancing. I told her my name and asked for hers. Aliyah. As we talked, I learned that she was going on a flight that will be stationed at the gate next to mine. She is going to Germany to visit her friends.

&nbsp;

>She was a college student, earning a degree in Psychology. During our entire conversation, I felt like I was on a high. Her presence was warm and comforting. Her smile was contagious and her laugh was sweet. Her phone finished charging and she gave me back my charger. Hesitating that she might leave, I quickly asked her if she wanted to get something to eat or drink. She agreed. We grabbed our bags and explored the airport. The airport seemed less chaotic. It was rather peaceful. We continued our conversation, sharing memorable stories we had of our friends. We walked over to a little café and ordered two coffees. We then compared our lives as college students in two different countries. Our coffees came and left.

&nbsp;

>Her words were desirable and her alacrity was attractive. Surprisingly, there was not a moment of boredom. We explored the airport which seemed vast but her curiosity was encouraging. We tried on sunglasses at a duty-free store and rated our looks. As we walked back to our gates, she told me that her flight will be boarding in a few minutes. Something buzzed within me. I was not ready to say goodbye to her. Not yet. I wish there was more time. As we got to the gate, many more people arrived at her gate. My gate was still fairly empty except for one or two people. We sat down. She was still smiling. We sat in silence for a bit.

&nbsp;

>She moved her hand over me and clutched it. Her hand was small and delicate but tender and warm. I turned to her. She thanked me for giving her an enjoyable memory during this layover. The sun was about to rise, the sky began to bleed in shades of violet. I wanted to tell her that I fell for her. I wanted to spend more time with her. I wanted to tell her that I wanted to experience some of life with her. I wanted to tell her that she was the most beautiful, extraordinary woman he had ever met. But I did not. I simply thanked her back and turned away from her. She looked down. We sat in silence once again.

&nbsp;

>Her gate opened and she stood up and grabbed her bags. I stood up and looked at her again. Where did this ethereal woman come from? Why me? Why did she have to ask me for a charger? It was painful to let her go. She said goodbye. I looked straight in her eyes and embraced her. She hugged back. We held each other for a couple of seconds. When I let go of her, she moved in and kissed me on my cheek. “Until we meet again,” Aliyah said softly. She smiled but it faded away quickly. She grabbed her bags and went over to her gate. She scanned her boarding pass and walked into the gate disappearing forever. Will we ever see each other again?

&nbsp;

>Are we meant to see each other again? I looked around. People were all around me. Once again, the airport felt chaotic.

relationship_advice,fpkw1kg,t3_ge2srg,1588702021.0,">I've been married (35F) to my husband (37M) for 10 years. We have two kids together. Recently, when he was showing me something on his phone a text message popped up from someone I didn't know. I asked him who it was. He said it's just someone he works with. The message was about something other than work so I asked him if he talks to her often. He said ""not really"". Within those minutes he managed to delete all her messages so when I asked to see the messages he said he deleted them. This upset me because if he had nothing to hide, why would he delete his messages. He then said ""Sorry, I always delete all my messages"".. That was his response.

&nbsp;

>I told him to try to recover the messages because otherwise I'll really think something is up. Then he says, ""I can't recover messages. Either way, that was the only text from her"". (This is a lie) I tell him, ""There's no way that was the only text message from her because it seems like there was something said before that. The way the message read they were having a conversation about something. I tell him I don't want to talk to him (obviously upset now because I know he's hiding something) and go to the other room. I look up a way to recover old text messages from an iphone and knowing he backs up everything to icloud, tell him to recover those messages.

&nbsp;

>He manages to recover the messages (don't know if he deleted any because I wasn't in front of him when he did it), and I read screenshots of what he recovered. It wasn't a complete conversation and I don't know if he deleted any in between messages, but what I did read wasn't sexual but overly friendly. It made me uncomfortable reading it. I am angry now, but I am more angry that he tried to hide it by deleting the messages and then lied about it only being a one time conversation/message. I have one close guy friend myself who I've known for years, but I open up the friendship to him as well where he is also friends with my guy friend. The secretive part about this is what is bugging me the most.

&nbsp;

>I still don't know what is between those lines (since I didn't get to read the whole conversation), but what I read was that he is constantly texting this girl like almost every day and being way too playful and friendly. Am i overreacting here? What would you do?

redditoryt,fpkupij,t3_ge2l45,1588701357.0,">Hello everyone,  so a few months ago I encountered an entitled friend (EF). at the beginning of our friendship he was really nice because he didn't have many friends, but slowly he started getting more annoying and entitled, he would always do stupid pranks that were so annoying, so one day we were playing Minecraft together with another nice friend (NF) and since EF was doing so many stupid pranks we wanted to get him back by pulling of a prank in Minecraft, so we did the prank when suddenly EF starts screaming at me: WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT IT ISN'T EVEN FUNNY YOU LITTLE FEMALE DOG!!!!. and then he leaves the call, then I go to the bathroom for a sec and when I came back I see 157 missed messages from Ef!

&nbsp;

>he spammed: FRICK YOU FRICK YOU FRICK YOU. NF starts telling me he was spamming her too and said things like: WHY ARE YOU ACTING LIKE A BABY, I DIDNT DO ANYTHING WH YARE YOU MAD!?!?!?!?!? (my NF almost never gets mad this is one of the first times I have seen her mad). then my NF starts ignoring him and then I go talk to him. Me: why are you being so mean? EF: I AM NOT MEAN YOU GUYS ARE ALL AGAINST ME WHILE I DIDNT DO ANYTHING!!! (now I begin to understand why he doesn't have many friends). me: what do you mean all against you we literally did one prank on you and you start acting like a female dog!

&nbsp;

>EF: ehhhh... I TOLD YOU ABOUT A MILLION TIMES TO STOP WITH THE PRANKS!!! (this is literally the first ever prank we did to him). Me: you never said ANYTHING about stopping with pranks because YOU were the one who did stupid ass pranks!! EF: well my mom said I am an angel and that I didn't do anything wrong!! (and then he starts talking about how much of an AnGeL he is). Me: but why are you such a female dog over ONE prank! (EF has nothing to say anymore) EF: well why are you even continuing this stupid fight anyways. Me: what do you mean I am continuing you're the one  who starts spamming us and being so f\*cking rude!

&nbsp;

>EF: well you shouldn't have done that F\*CKING PRANK!!!!. then he contacted one of my NF's best friend and tells lies about how she is a female dog and that she is calling him bad names (she only said that he's a female dog). then NF's best friend tells her: whats you did is not ok, bye bye c\*nt! and then she blocks her and never talked to her again.then I have one last conversation with EF about why he's such a brat. EF: WELL IF YOU DIDNT DO THAT STUPID PRANK MAYBE I....I....I (he had nothing to say anymore) then I tell him how horrible of a person he is and I leave the call.

&nbsp;

>then the next day he is demanding I call him, but I was curious what kind of bs he would make up so I called him. suddenly he sounded really nice and told me: so do you want to play Minecraft today? I was shocked. Me: what....the......F\*CK.........IS....WRONG.....WITH.....YOU!! then he starts acting like he didn't do anything (he is really bad at lying) EF:what I didn't do anything! then I told him I had enough of him and I don't want to talk to him again. EF wanted to guilt trip me and said:but...but you're my only friend and I don't have anyone to play with (he starts fake crying). I was having none of it and then I told him: I don't want to TALK TO YOU.

&nbsp;

>EF:ok but can you play later in the evening because I have soccer practice. I started laughing really hard, then I told him to F off and I blocked him. then he messages me: WHY WOULD YOU BLOCK ME YOU PIECE OF SH\*T I HOPE YOU DIE SLOWLY FEMALE DOG. then I completely remove him from my contacts. the end, thank you so much for taking your time and reading this, special thank you to Redditor.

LSD,fpktsov,t3_ge2fv3,1588700910.0,">Sorry in advance for the grammar errors.  I am a freshman about to be a sophomore in high school and I had recently felt in love with lsd and loved all the unexplainable weird things that happen on it and I had always wanted to go deeper into the trip but only had 1 tab(200 ug)but was reallyyy feeling like tripping hard that night so I searched up how to potentiate acid and ppl said to smoke a lil weed so I did I popped the tab waited about an hour and a half and I had all the weed I would need so I went outside and was just as happy as could be and smoked about half a blunt just to feel how my body would react to this combination and I was just getting these amazing visuals almost overwhelming but in a wowww I have never ever experienced this in my life type of visuals.

&nbsp;

> So all was good as soon as I go back and lay in my bed and put my earbuds in my mind starts to kind of loose it and I hear this weird buzzing sound that’s almost coming from inside my head and it would go higher and lower in pitch even after I took off my earbuds to see wtf is going on then BOOM I’m full on tripping and I can’t control any of my thoughts I was almost blind from the visuals and my whole span of view is covered in pixels and I’m just scared for my life at this point and I have no where to escape I close my eyes and after seconds of doing that I feel myself floating up into space and there were shadows that would rush out from the walls and I could feel my body just almost convulsing every time one them would pass through me and I remember looking down over and seeing my dog on my recliner chair staring at me with his ears back and shivering and had his tail tucked between his legs which keep in mind he was fast asleep a couple minutes ago.

&nbsp;

> A couple minutes later I see my dog start pacing back and fourth in the room and he throws up all of a sudden and when I come near him to say it’s okay he acts like he doesn’t want to be touched which is very weird for him.

&nbsp;

> I was at a point of giving up as I lay in the bed I would just see the room morph as the shadows grew and my body started twitching and shivering uncontrollably with my mouth hanging open just staring off with no expression and it was like I could see myself from a third person view.  I also have a desk in my room I keep for homework and all of a sudden a paper falls off and another just floats down a few seconds after but my fan isn’t on and the vent wasn’t blowing any air at this time.

&nbsp;

> I read a post from another guy who tried this combo and said his girlfriend said he looked possessed and couple almost feel the tension in the room which reminded me of my experience.  And yeah I get it I tripped wayyyy to hard because the weed potentiated acid way more than I expected but the way my dog was staring at me like he knew what I was seeing and threw up kind of scared me he even growled at one point but would never take his eyes off of me.  And what the hell was that buzzing sound I heard in my head and every time I would get a burst of fear that I was honestly going to lose my life, the buzzing sound would reach a higher pitch but it was almost like my body was shutting down and I had no control over it, what did I experience?

&nbsp;

> I think there’s more to psychedelics than we realize. My mind has been permanently changed from these experiences.

heartbreak,fpkocvs,t3_ge1lhv,1588698220.0,">So I(16M) have a small friend group that stemmed from my Soccer team in High School. We're all very close and hang out a lot. One of my friends(16M) in the group has a girlfriend(16F) that has two sisters. They're triplets and were all born on the same day. We started to hang with her sisters and started to get close to them. One day we were hanging out and I noticed that I really enjoyed talking to and hanging out with one of them. We walked together, laughed together. And it was just a really good time. Later that night we both decided to take a nap on the bottom bunk of a bed. So we did, it was borderline cuddling and that's when I knew something was there.

&nbsp;

>The next night we spent there we did the same thing. We facetimed every day from then on and spent so much time together, we laughed together, cried together, and told each other things we had never told anyone else before. We always told each other we loved each other and we deeply cared about one another. She was a pretty shy person who didn't really open up much, she was smart and hard-working and was beautiful. One day on facetime I told her I liked her, and she told me that she liked me back. The next day she was acting sort of strange on text. Then she sent me a whole essay on how she felt bad because she didn't actually like me.

&nbsp;

>She said that she didn't know how she felt, she said she just wanted me to be happy so that's why she said that. She also said that there was a chance in the future so i decided to try and take it. Later down the road, I gave her a choice on whether she wanted to move on and be friends or see where it went. She said she wanted to see where it went but after a week she said she wanted to move on and be friends. After all we had been through I still didn't know how she liked me. I feel like every time I talk to her or hang out with her I will be sad.

&nbsp;

>And if she finds someone else that would suck for me. How do I not lose her as a friend and maintain a good relationship with her? I still definitely have feelings for her and I'm just lost. I know she still cares about me and likes being around me but it's just not the same anymore. Especially since she's the first person I've felt those type of feelings for.

selfimprovement,fpkmobb,t3_ge1bnn,1588697388.0,">Growing up I was really liked by people,I was outspoken,fun and funny but I felt the change started when I got publicly humiliated in high School,I guess I just kinda kept to myself, I couldn't really make much friends cause of said humiliation,I did manage to make a group of friends in my final year but I had to transfer and that was it.i got into uni and I didn't have friends,I got all the info about school work from the group and didn't have to talk to anyone,by second semester a girl approached me and we became kind of friends,some months passed I met some other guys from different places in school and we hang out sometimes but I don't think I consider them friends,we could talk about deep stuff  even my family but sometimes I make excuses when they want to meet up or ignore their calls or texts or even answer the phone and later put in on airplane mode like it was a network problem,I made excuses to not video call mostly because I'm shy in general,I'm a bad person.i

&nbsp;

>see the way people have friendships and relationships but I can't cause I push people away, I'm worse with relationships my last relationship lasted for 2 years and I didn't even love the guy,I've never felt genuine love for anyone,I just care about them.i've only felt jealous because the only girlfriend I had began talking to my roommate and hanging out with her more.i

&nbsp;

>recently began dating again and the same stuff keeps happening,I have little or no interest in talking to him.it's like I push people away and then complain about not having friends,I want to be alone but sometimes I see or read stuff and I don't wanna be alone, sometimes I try to picture my future and I'm alone in it,as much as I have an I don't care attitude,I don't want to die alone,it's like everyone is leaving me behind and achieving things but I'm stuck here,I feel like a total loser.i give up easily when things don't go my way,I've had to drop hobbies,I'm 21 now and I'm scared I'm growing up and almost finishing college and my life is gonna be like how it was at the start of it...I

migraine,fpkmdol,t3_ge1ain,1588697242.0,">Hey guys, If you’ve seen my last Reddit post, a few days ago I’ve been feeling flu-like symptoms (headache, full body weakness, chills and slight nausea) without fever. I just turned 20 years old, I have no underlying conditions (maybe ibs or acid reflux) but my parent and my sister have anemia or some sort of iron deficiency. I haven’t gone to the doctor due to COVID-19 (which really sucks because I have work next week and I probably have to tell my boss that I’m sick). I’ve ruled out coronavirus (I have been stuck at my parents house for about a month, we have been sanitizing, delivering food and groceries) and I have no symptoms of cough, fever or shortness of breath, however, a few weeks ago, I had this random rib cage pain.

&nbsp;

>I called the doctor on this app and they told me to take 400 mg of ibuprofen which was really bad because not only did it not work but I have a history of stomach ulcers. I also took acetaminophen and it didn’t work either. So I called them back and they prescribed omeprazole and Celecoxib. I took it together for the first and second day and realized it wasn’t working and it was making me dizzy in the first few mins of taking it. So I stopped. I took the omeprazole twice in the past and it was fine and I had no side effects but now I am feeling increasingly weak everyday and I’m getting this awful migraine.

&nbsp;

>Everyday I feel so exhausted, but not sleepy, I’ve taken my temperature a few times and it’s normal(97.6-98.9). Everytime I get up or lie down my head feels so heavy. I never had these symptoms in my whole entire life. I thought it was maybe low blood pressure but I’m now I’m very unsure reading horror stories about nexaplanon causing flu like symptoms and terrible headaches/migraines. I read a story about a girl who had the implant and she was having terrible headaches due to a fluid build up in her brain and I’m so scared that this might be happening to me. Last night I couldn’t sleep because of my migraine and this morning I had to take a combo pill of caffeine, an aspirin and acetaminophen because it was so hard to stand up with out feeling like there was a heavy rock on my head.

&nbsp;

>I could test to see if I have anemia but if I don’t have it then I have to get my nexaplanon removed. I really don’t want to because I have been having a great time with this birth control until now. I had it inserted this year on Feb 20th and I never had any real problems with it. Got it inserted with no problems and had slight cramping in my uterus for like one to two days. I have also been spotting ever since this started happening so I’m afraid that this is all due to the implant.

&nbsp;

>I also don’t know when I will have it removed if push comes to shove. I can’t keep taking these pills as I feel like they’re adding to the reason why I have these migraines and weakness and also my mental health (bc of my history of stomach ulcers). If my iron level test comes out negative, should I take the implant out or should I wait and give it a few months while taking aspirin?

relationship_advice,fpkd8ja,t3_gdzt73,1588692558.0,">Feeling a bit lost. The thing is I’ve had this same problem since I was 15-16 I’m currently 20 male btw. Getting girls attention is not hard for me. I am considered attractive to them almost 90 percent of the time. I don’t think looks is my problem. I do have a little bit of confidence issues though. I get matches on tinder and I talk to majority of them. Half the time I get messaged first. My problem is I am to afraid to open up an be my true self. I’ll always try be to confident which makes me look rude/arrogant or I’ll just straight up not try. I know I’m doing this to myself but I can’t manage to stop it. I’m not so much afraid of rejection but more of being laughed at and ridiculed.

&nbsp;

>Over all I’m a genuine,  nice guy. But like I said there’s either 2 ways I go about it. The first way is just not try an basically be stubborn with shit responses and the second way which is kind of over confident and maybe a bit rude. I can also talk to a girl for weeks on end with almost nothing happening I don’t mean sexual but just a phone call/or even meeting up for a coffee. I don’t know how to be romantic I am to afraid to make the first move in case I’ll be looked at as a “weirdo” or one of them sketchy guys.

&nbsp;

>It’s not me but I’m sick of this same problem arising! I’m my own worst enemy an I can’t help it. So many opportunities I have had an for me just to let them go down the drain. I’m sick of chasing people away for my own protection. I just want to feel a connection between someone other than a family member or a friend. It’s such a fucked situation to be in. Do I need to develop some sort of “game”! Flirting isn’t really an issue but going further is. I don’t know what the fuck to do. Even though I’ve had experience before. This shit is just confusing the fuck out of me. I’m sick of the head games also. Some advice would be nice preferably from girls.

starseeds,fpkd2um,t3_gdzs2s,1588692474.0,"> The human race has now come to the moment of election. The busy photonic light wave of light and all sizes are fully soil by collective heart news. Energy is united and ozumseniyor in all izgaralarda. 3, 4, 5 all sizes are in this now and every living being can be able to reach all sizes if they clean their individual internal focus and speed system. When everything is in this present, every soul that complete their inner duties can reach and energy doesn't disappear. The energy has been capalandi and United according to their standards. When a soul reach the same speed, energy is reached, United with energy, and continues to grow. That's why no one gets left behind, when every soul is ready to unite and self-Care, it reach the release.

&nbsp;

>There is a fear created by service for a purpose against the own collective, and at this time, the fear of being missed. Everyone is impressed with this, but in the end, they will not understand what is. Fear also feels because it feels the change, but can't understand what is. Evolution Energy from the source is created in waves. And this special wave will grow and stronger with planet hizalanmalarla and lunar hizalanmalarla and solar storms. In your humanity experience this is the most powerful energy catalyst ever in history, the divine touch that separate the new rise and falls time lines. This is all the physical creation of the divine plan of evolution.

&nbsp;

>Since the growing difference between both collective is very large, there is no option to control both worlds. There is no more option for the weak souls. This universe is the universe of prayer. Rise, development is achieved by service to others and self. Time lines are separated by no times. Access to sizes happens with pleasure, so all low thought forms and creatures will not be able to experience the experience of the high-shaking izgaralarin experienced by the heart collection. They will not cross the curtain. As more and more souls wake up, food resources will be lower and will not be able to feed themselves. As the heart collection goes on the rise spirit, they will continue in the land spirit. This is the break of time lines.

&nbsp;

>So far in the history of human history, everyone has experienced a 3.-size which has been seen. This was a matriksti, LED by Galaxy High-D and multi-D creatures that experience its rise by service. These  creatures prefer not to relate to the whole source so they could experience the difference instead of unity and manage the human race to play life resources. People are caught in the dark, without knowledge. So they could have a battery that will give them life, but now the planet rise energy is completely covered in all souls, and every soul has a chance to get out of the karmic and experience high-shaking reality. The physical world has just finished the dark zone in space where many worlds are broken and the vibe is very busy.

&nbsp;

>According to the law of law of law, the planet fell into the awareness of the planet. Low-volume creatures have been a part of the world experience at this point. This is what we call fall. Now, once again, the photonic light is completely reach the world and it is capalaniyor to start the rise by the good news. This is a higher shaking area in space, where the world's awareness will continue to rise and this will bring a new age of development, a new experience for all souls. Everything goes up and falls according to the rules of rhythm. Now every soul has the right to choose the way they want.

&nbsp;

>Rise in self service, heart collection or fall time lines and break time lines and break. The area between the two collective is very open to continue, so the souls who choose the rise time line are left to experience the rise as a heart collection. They will not be impressed with more external manipulasyonlardan and the defense of low-shaking izgaralarin. High-shaking reality is now possible for anyone who choose them. As the energy United, the library of the two collective will become more obvious. Energy has been revealed to all the perform, energy that, in this self-service, these time lines were tried to be physically created. As a result of war and death agenda and end of the world, the most powerful five of them are the human feelings that are fear and hate, the opposite of love.

&nbsp;

>The desire to use technology to create the end of the waves with the coming waves are balance with the highest-shaking energy of the heart collection. Those who serve the unity law balance the fear and destroy energy of unity with the high-shaking energy of the unity. The energy that comes for those who lead will bring all situations, thoughts, relationships and people who can't be able to control who we really are, the deepest secrets and unknown creatures. That's why anything that doesn't serve the best of everything in your life will finally be seen and set free. This is the purpose of these energy times.

&nbsp;

>It is keeping light on all issues based on lies and things that are not true. These are the energy  foundation of low-shaking izgaralarin that now these the have been revealed by the light for the human race to see and free the human race. Energy for the waking collective will start an alarm process and start waking up from old reality. For those who choose to grow in the dark, they will begin to experience all their creatures that do not serve the best of all, and will be destroyed quickly. Karmic energy will start coming back to them and will have to experience what they don't want to face. Lack of experience will continue to increase. Time to create higher vibes faster for each person, more intense person is slow.

&nbsp;

>But in this universe, why is the law of the result is stable. Every energy always comes back to the soul of every person. It's time for the results to come back, which is different for each person. Souls will either either choose or physical to a higher video, as they cannot move to a higher video, and will die physically to experience the fall in the alternative universe where fall in the alternative universe and experience the world created by that collective. Or they will be born again in order to continue their life experiences. The Heart Collection will continue to increase their awareness and reach full ozumsemeye and provide body in high-D State. This is how a race is that the world can reach unity while they become a galaxy.

&nbsp;

>For the human collection, this wave will be felt by everyone. But all seven and a half billion souls are on different kinds. The way to rise is individual and everyone is enjoying their own rise. Not all souls choose to rise or wake up in this life time. This is the universe of free choice. At this point, the good news are not connected with the 3 b or they are completely broken and they are capaliyorlar high-Vibratory energy so that the energy can be reached for all. The mass wake up at this moment will enter their way of remembering. This is the time when all the good news are prepared to join all the creatures that made this pass of consciousness.

&nbsp;

>Joining a higher-shaking world with a higher shaking world makes this pass easy and fun. A new epic has started to be written with love. The time lines were left. We are united with you. In your world, in your creation, in your creation, living library is all in divine perfection and time as it should be. You are your home and we are all with you. We are always with you. We will always be with you. We are all a heart that is a home. And in that heart we are all eternal love. We are the arkturuslulariz. We are here to join you and share our love with you for the highest benefit of all.

>My deep gratitude and joy from the service of my heart to be here right now.

BPD,fpk56lq,t3_gdyike,1588688206.0,">Look so this is wild for me. This has been my first long term relationship where it’s been healthy for the most part. So about two months ago me and my partner had a huge fight about him moving away for a job. He didn’t really talk much to me about till he told me he had a job interview and I was like okay whatever he’s not gonna get it because it’s a state job which is hard to get when you have no work experience. Anyways he ends up getting it and he tells me he has to take the job because his parents told him he had to. I felt betrayed and a after thought in this. He’s sleeping with me and trying to have a life with me why in the hell is he more into what his parents say and think than me?

&nbsp;

>It got bad. The fight was very bad. I broke up with him because I didn’t see how this could be fixed. Ended up getting back together trying to work it out. I believe it deserves to try to be worked on. I strongly believe I’ve been splitting since. At first he got on my nerves and I didn’t want him to touch me. Those feelings went away but then I can’t tell if I think he’s good looking, saw his physical flaws and if I really want to be in the relationship or not. I can’t tell if I do.

&nbsp;

>I don’t feel like I fear being alone but what if it’s a subconscious thing? I like when he holds me and kisses me but it doesn’t feel the same. I will say things have been getting better in general. I did start taking buspar recently but I’m telling you I had to quit. It made my kind of bad split to a full on never coming back thing. I just quit taking it yesterday. I feel somewhat better but damn the paranoia I live with and the anxiety is fucking awful. I just wanted to relief of the bad thoughts about my partner. I also want to say my partner knows of everything I’ve said in this post. Yes even the stuff that hurts him.

&nbsp;

>It’s sucks. I just can’t tell if it’s actually over or if it’s not. I care about him a lot. Deeply. I love him a lot as a person. I think I still do romantically. I fear if I leave him I’ll regret it and wonder about him the rest of my life. I get sad thinking I wouldn’t see him ever again and that I couldn’t hug and kiss him. I get upset when I think him being with somebody else. Not being with me. I really feel this a lot. It makes me think something is still there. I do have a hard time thinking me marrying him. That’s a mess currently. I guess what I’m asking is have you experienced anything like this?

&nbsp;

>If so what did you do? How did it play out? How do you know it’s over as a person with BPD? How do you know that person is ‘the one’ for you? How can you fight the splitting? Do you think what I am experiencing is splitting? I know the meds are part of why I feel so not wanting to be in the relationship but damn I just wonder...do I?

Advice,fpk3ddb,t3_gdy7cm,1588687166.0,">So I'm 17 years old, turning 18 this year. I worked as a lifeguard over the summer and plan on becoming a doctor. That's enough about me. My mom I'm pretty sure is bipolar, one minute she loves me, the other she despises me. My dad is not the brightest person, and causes a lot of problems for my mom. In turn my mom relies heavily on me to help her out. She constantly looks for a reason to get mad, yelling at me for the smallest of shit. My dad got laid off during this Corona epidemic, so we filed for unemployment, and I was supposed to file each week. I filed last week for my dad since he's computer illiterate but the money didn't come on Monday.

&nbsp;

>My mom flipped, cursing at me and saying shit how I'm useless, how she regrets having me, how I can't do anything, an how she wishes she could kill herself. She has literally grounded me to one meal per day, and told me that when this epidemic blows over she will take out the equivalent amount of money that didn't come out of my bank account since its shared with her cause I'm not 18 yet. Best part is, we have a decent amount of money, it's not like we're living paycheck to paycheck. I cannot wait until I leave this household, but the path I'm taking in life (medicine) is nowhere near cheap and I need every cent I can get.

&nbsp;

>I've reached the point where I don't care if I live another day or not, due to the lack of mental and physical support, I was looking forward this summer to working so I could get away from her since I work like 50-60 hours a week by my own choice, but even that doesn't seem like an option. Thanks to the mental abuse of my mom where I would get grounded if I got anything less than a 90, I feel little to no empathy for others as well and it scares me. So I wanted to ask, what advice should I take lol, I was considering air force to cover the costs of being a doctor but I lack the balls to do it on my own, plus when I get out where will I go?

&nbsp;

>Thanks for reading my long request for help lmao

LSD,fpk1jgd,t3_gdxvtx,1588686098.0,">About a month ago I took a tab and had a fantastic trip. I didn't test the tab because my friend has taken these tabs many times before at much higher doses than me and assures me they're perfectly safe, and there's no one I trust more than him so I figured I was good to go. I'm getting ready to trip again at a higher dosage, but before I do I just want to make sure what I'm taking really is L. And yes, I know a test kit is cheap and legal and easy to get online but when you live with parents who get the mail for you and check your card history thats a difficult thing to get inconspicuously. I have a full trip report in my post history, but I'll give a brief overview of the effects I experienced here.

&nbsp;

>I dropped a tab that I was told was 110ug, but my friend said it might be closer to 200ug, however idk whether or not thats true because he always takes more than one. Anyways, about 10 or 15 minutes after I finished dropping, or 20 or 30 minutes after I put it on my tongue, I started to feel tingly. Close to an hour later I felt really really stoned, but a little fuzzier than I would be on high doses of marijuana. After that I cant remember much of a timeline for awhile, but I watched a movie and the actors faces looked like they were moving like bubbles do, flowing and morphing and shit.

&nbsp;

>The patterns on my tapestries were flowing like oil in water. At one point I got up to go to the bathroom and when I saw the rest of the house I got really upset that there was a world outside of my room and i thought I was terrible. Didn't send the trip bad though. As I was taking a piss the toilet felt like it was getting further and further away. After what I believe was a few hours, I think the peak was over and I was on the come down and I was getting really really introspective. Meaning of life, how the world and life in interconnected, all that.

&nbsp;

>Around hour 11 I was almost completely sober and after 12 hours I was good to go, aside from being sleep deprived. Does this sound like a legit L trip to y'all?

relationship_advice,fpju21e,t3_gdwn7q,1588680995.0,">I’m an 18 year old male for reference. So this is really just a question to see if anyone else experiences this sort of thing or has any opinions on it. Countless times over the last year or so I will convince myself of something I.e. my girlfriend doesn’t want to have sex with me or she doesn’t find me attractive, or she’s only with me because of my personality and things of this nature. I’ll bring these up with my girlfriend and no matter how much she reassures me nothing will remove these thoughts from my head and they just fill it up and I keep convincing myself that these things are true. It’ll lead to things like me not initiating sex because I believe that she doesn’t want to do it even though she will happily initiate it, and I know deep down she does.

&nbsp;

>These worries normally last a few days and don’t necessarily interfere with our relationship with eachother, but do interfere with what said worry is about, for example sex or making plans to see each other. They normally start because I will take something she said or did completely out of context. For example, I will try initiate sex, she will not be in the mood (tired etc) which is perfectly reasonable, I will then get the thought in my head that, for example, she’s done things with other people in the past she’s not even been in a relationship with, then this will sit in my head for ages and make me feel inadequate and like she doesn’t desire me, and no amount of reassurance will fix it.

&nbsp;

>It just sits there and refuses to budge and it’s all I can think about and I become more withdrawn. I feel bad because me worrying about that may come across as if I feel entitled to sex, which I certainly don’t and would never pressure her. This will also happen, for example, if we make plans, and for some reason I feel like she doesn’t want to do what we planned to do, and that thought will just sit in my head no matter what, and I’ll continuously say things to her like “we don’t have to do this you know,” or “maybe we should leave this.”

&nbsp;

>Sometimes this is due to me picking up on a tone in her voice or something she said, or just nothing at all. I feel awful about it because she’s never done anything wrong and it makes her feel bad, and I really want to figure out a way to help this. I also suffer from retroactive jealousy pretty badly, to the point where I can hardly bring myself to say the names of her exes without feeling overcome with a sort of sadness and anxiety and weird feeling in the pit of my stomach (my own problem, not hers, which I completely understand). I never take any of this out on her, it’s not her fault at all.

&nbsp;

>I just want to know if anyone else suffers from anything similar, or has experienced anything like this, and would have any sort of advice?

offmychest,fpjtahq,t3_gdwie2,1588680379.0,">So I'm a sophomore in high school, and I'm signing up for college classes for this summer. My mom was scrolling on the computer looking at the school's page, and she was going really slow, so I thought to myself, ""this will take 2 seconds if I just did it myself."" Of course I didn't say that to her, but I reached over to scroll through the page, and she literally decked me so fucking hard and screamed, ""Who the hell do you think you are? What's wrong with you?"" and then continued to scream at me about how incompetent I am. I went to my room and started cleaning, and once I came out of the room to get the vacuum cleaner she screamed with an attitude, ""okay stop this you can't keep kidding around we need to sign up.""

&nbsp;

>girl what? Then once I finished cleaning my room I signed up for the classes myself. So I just went over to her to tell her really quickly that I had signed up for the class, and before I could even speak she said, ""I'm sorry for hitting you, but I don't know... I'm really not you're just SO annoying."" I feel like I can't even talk to anyone about the mental abuse (I know from this story it doesn't sound like they are abusing me but my whole family has physically/emotionally abused me my whole life I have gone to a therapist and she has informed me that I'm not exaggerating) all of the horrible I go through in this house, because people will just think that it's just me being hormonal.

&nbsp;

>Having no love for your family and resenting them for how much they've fucked you up in your head isn't normal teenager hormonal feelings. I need to get my associate's degree by the time I graduate high school (2 years,) but I just feel like that's so much work. How am I supposed to take 20 college classes while going to high school? I need to get this associates so I can get a real job while working on the rest of my bachelors and move out the second I graduate high school, but idk how I can do that when my home life is so chaotic.

ParentsRFuckingstupid,fpjkhv3,t3_gduscl,1588671926.0,">Okay im just gonna go out of my way and say my mom is fucking retarded. I swear im so glad the corona virus canceled the school year for me. I switched my sleep schedule to were i wake up when my parents go to sleep and go to bed when they come back from work. I just cant take jt anymore. So the reason im saying this is because she bitches at ANYTHING And i would say im a very respectful son. I dont disobey her, i do most of the chores, and i dont break any of her rules (like staying late out or not listening to her). So before i switched my sleep schedule, i would have to listen to her bitch about something when she came back home from work.

&nbsp;

>For example, im just watching hulu in the living room and i hear her come into the house and fucking bitch about the dishes not being done. Something that can be solved within minutes. she just yells about the smallest shit. My dad is the same way. He doesnt do it everyday but when he does god is it fucking annoying. This dude gives a fucking Speech about how he has to wash the dishes in the morning before leaving for work all the time. At this point i was at my breaking point of this shit and just told him that i could do it when i wake up. Like holy shit this fucking brain dead monkey couldnt think of that.

&nbsp;

>They literally blame my siblings And I about being lazy and doing nothing all day. Of course were not perfect and will forget to take out the trash or maybe forget to tidy up the bathrooms. And oh boy is that a sin. My mom will do nothing but yap her fucking mouth like a fucking dog complaining about how hard they work and how we do nothing for them. It honestly pisses me off how selfish they can be. Like i do love them with all my heart but god knows i can only take so much. And Its not like we dont do shit either we do clean a lot but i guess they cant see that and never go out of their way to thank us.

&nbsp;

>I do thank them. Everyday as soon as they come home. I kiss them on the cheek and help them coming in with their things. Im laying on my bed rn 4am writing this because ive just had enough. This isnt all she does but if i were to write more i would be writing a fucking book. All im saying is that she is a fucking stupid bitch and that some point im just never gonna want to see her anymore.

relationship_advice,fpjjs7g,t3_gdumq4,1588671152.0,">Hey guys, so a bit of Back story I am currently 16 years old and in year 10 this all started in around halfway through year 7 where I met a girl, let's call her linda she was also my age, instantly when I had seen her I knew she was someone who I wanted to be with I'm the kind of guy who doesn't like the popular stereotype girl I like goofy,cute sweet and someone who can be themselves around me a girl who lights up when they see me, anyway fast forward a couple weeks of getting to know her she asks me out and I obviously accept I liked this girl, turns out she was transgender and secretly wanted to transition to a boy now I was straight all my life but my love for this person now who I refer to as a boy we can call him Charlie was so deep that I was okay with it I supported him through it as best I could that first year was the happiest of my life then halfway through the second year he would hit me constantly and these hits hurt, it was his only way of trying to get my attention he never got much from his parents so he didint know how aswell as this he didint want to fully let me In because of his past (alot of people have been horrible to him) and this continued for quite some time then he would say verbal put downs to me which honestly I deflected for the first 8 months but after that it just got to me way to much I couldn't take it from someone who I loved so dearly so I told him and he stopped, he apologized he stopped hitting he stopped always putting me down around 2 months later his mum got lung cancer and was going through intense care during this time he was extremely sad so id do whatever  I could to cheer him up buy him his favourite chocolate almost every week or some nutella doughnuts from the bakery and give him all my love I could luckily his mum came out okay and beat cancer (great achievement) now I'm gonna fast forward a little bit id say to when we were approaching our third year of dating he told me he wanted to do a poly relationship (where you date multiple people at once) at first I was absolutely against it but once again I loved him so dearly so I tried to make him happy but it just didint work and I couldn't handle it we always clashed for the years we dated and to be honest as much as this hurts me to say I don't think we should of ever dated we just weren't compatible so nearly at 3 years we decided to mutually break up we still stay friends and talk often but it's hurt the both of us quite a bit me way more I loved him more than anything for the first week or two I cried myself to sleep I still love him even a month later after breaking up,  I have this numb feeling where i just feel empty and it's because Charlie was a part of me a big one and it was ripped away, those three years despite everything were the happiest of my life I'm not going to go into what we did regarding sexual things or any of that, that will stay lock and and key but none of that even matters, I still miss him I still think of him and I can't stand it and it's really broken me im healing but it's painfully slow this was really just a place to vent for me so if you made it this far I thank you and I think I'll always love charlie no matter what that's what hurts the most, I seriously miss him, this is an edit and a report.

&nbsp;

>it's been around 2 months since we've split and I still can't delete the photo album I made of us two I just can't bring myself to and I feel like it isn't normal to still be stuck on this and still miss him so much, I don't know how to get over him.

KeepWriting,fpje29p,t3_gdtgpd,1588665126.0,">Chapter 1 -101 It was 11pm on a saturday when my friend matt came over,as he usually did, he was short but not really short and he had shoulder length ratty looking brown hair, I’d known matt for about three years we had both taken microbiology, although i dropped out shortly after enrolling he was just finishing up his bachelor, he had brought with him two things, a quarter of sour diesel, and about three grams of mushrooms, he was always very knowledgeable on mushrooms, especially the kind that make you trip dick. We sat in my living room and i let him roll, i let him roll almost every time and when i say almost i mean every single tim except the one where i completely botched the rolling job cause i was out of my mind on pain killers and mushrooms, i always said i let him roll because he was so good but in reality it was because i sucked cock and ballz at rolling.

&nbsp;

>As he sat rolling the blunt i put on pink floyds wall album In the flesh had barely ended by the time he waved this monster of a blunt in my face, he used two papers to make it, i pulled out my “I'm an american flicker” which i had sharpied to say “i'm an american fucker” and handed it to him he always hit green first cause he always rolled, he took a long hit from it as the smoke already started to box my living room he held in the hit for a good 40 seconds before aggressively coughing out a cloud of smoke he took another quick hit and passed it to me saying “this is that spoince jorts 3 shit rightchere” meaning it was good shit.

&nbsp;

>I hit that shit so hard i nearly killed half the blunt with one hit as i exhaled i noticed exactly how strong it was i almost immediately felt it hit me i spaced out for a second as i felt like everything was gonna be alright like i had just been told that my some ok news that doesn't excite you but instead gives you a kinda numb feeling followed by the realization that you no longer had to care about any of those problems that screamed inside your brain all day.

&nbsp;

>I quickly snapped out of it with the hearing of Roger Waters screaming about meat in a scottish accent i passed my friend back the blunt and remarked about how insane it is that he could do such a good scttish accent matt replied “yeah man all of waters voices are actaully fucking crazy good” we finished the blunt and put the roach aside for a bowl later thats when matt grabbed the back of mushrooms and divided it up into to large piles, and while ive done mushrooms many times before, this was this was a fuck ton. They didn’t taste terrible as I was already quite used to the taste but it's how they get stuck in my teeth that I can never get used to.

&nbsp;

>I don’t know what it was, Maybe it was the weed maybe it was cause how much we’d done but the effects where almost immediate i looked at matt and saud “hey you know its a full moon tonight” he replied in a voice akine to kermit the frog “Full moon dot com” we laughed our dicks off as we went outside to smoke in my truck in my yard that didn't run matt realized he’d forgotten the wraps as he went back inside i looks up at the sky it wasn’t a regular night it was so bright from the moon it was like it was merely late afternoon.

&nbsp;

>I’d never seen the moon in such detail i swear i could see every crater as it shown bright in the sky i started my way to the truck as matt flew walked out the house i went to the passenger side door and grasped the handle but for the life of me i couldn’t open the door so i jumped on the bed and slid open the back windows and climbed my way into the truck into the driver's seat matt walked to the passenger side door and before i could explained it was jammed he’d opened it, you see it turn out the door wasn’t jammed i just forgot one of if not the most important actions required in the opening of a door and this is actually opening the door he must have sat there watching me laughing like a fucking idoit for 5 minutes before i stopped and turned to him he had already rolled a blunt roughly the size of a large bipedial animals fingers i pulled my phone out and starred at the home screen for about three hours before putting on king missles “detachable penis”

offmychest,fpjceki,t3_gdt5g8,1588663469.0,">He molested me for the first (?) time when I was about 4. I have a feeling it went on longer but I can’t remember much before the age of 8 (even very significant events besides him having a seizure). I don’t even remember much of what happened and I feel like a brat. I feel like I’m over reacting. All I remember is him spreading my legs and laying his head down between them and that’s it. He used to make me and my sister his slaves. Do chores and whatnot for him. I always remember how I felt so uncomfortable and scared at that idea. I didn’t want to be alone with him. I never wanted to be near him. Even into my teens before I acknowledged or remembered what happened I didn’t like him.

&nbsp;

>I thought it was because he was extremely introverted but I guess it was some internalized disdain for him that my brain just manifested as indifference. I have never told anyone all of this. I was assaulted later in life and did trauma work for that but I didn’t accept this until I turned 19 and I was already moved out of the house and had accepted a lot of what had happened with other incidents of sexual abuse. I moved back from my apartment as I am my fathers medical power of attorney and live in a different city normally so I wanted to be around him in case anything happened.

&nbsp;

>However, my brother confronted me on Christmas about what happened with a nice one liner after being entirely shit faced. Since then my life has been thrown into dismay. I had a rough time with mental health as a teenager and it all resurfaced after he told me. I started drinking, being apathetic, suicidal, self harm ideation, slipping into old ED habits and just entirely not myself. Now I’m stuck in the same house as him. I have horrible dreams every night, so vivid in nature, terrible anxiety before I go to bed, I won’t let myself eat more than 1000 calories and exercise 2+ hours a day. I drink almost everyday. I’m so tired. I feel myself slipping and I feel so fucking alone.

&nbsp;

>Every story I hear of someone who has been molested by a family member sounds so much more valid because they can remember what happened. I can’t really. And I feel like a fraud. I can’t tell anyone about the memories because there is hardly anything to tell. More have been resurfacing after he told me but I feel like they’re false memories and I’m faking it. The 6 years I’ve put into therapy and months of psychiatric and ED hospitals feel like they’ve just been flushed down the drain. I’m losing my fucking mind and becoming untethered but there is nothing I can do and I just needed to tell someone. It doesn’t help that my sister gets angry or frustrated if I bring it up, my dad won’t address it, and that my mother is dead.

&nbsp;

>I understand my dad and sisters feelings but I’m so tired. I just want support. My boyfriend is of help but sometimes he doesn’t have the best reactions and sometimes he genuinely has the worst ones. I’m scared and I feel alone. I don’t sleep until 4-5AM and wake up at 1230 at the very latest. For reference I normally sleep like 9 hours a day.

BPD,fpjcdpl,t3_gdt5fg,1588663446.0,">I've recently divorced my wife after 4 years and I still don't understand why she won't admit she has a problem.  I spent the last 2 years of marriage trying to convince her to goto therapy and it would be good, when the self harm, suicide threats and physical abuse against me got out of control i made it an ultimatum.  Actually several ultimatums and she never took them seriously.  Our couples therapist suggested she has bpd traits, she manipulated her individual therapist and when I confronted her of not talking about suicide she switched to another therapist.  The last therapist spoke with me to get a second opinion of events and after that she was doing CBT along with a DBT workbook.

&nbsp;

> I never found out if she was diagnosed or not.  Two months after she's still the same, screaming, crazy fights at 2am.  She stopped hitting me and choking me but I just couldn't take it anymore.  They say people with bpd realize they need help when they hit rock bottom, was destroying our marriage not enough.  She says she's cured and she never really needed therapy, she needed just someone to talk to.   She said she hit me because she loves me more than anyone else.  I asked her why won't she commit to therapy and save the marriage, she never replied back and now its like I don't exist.   I don't understand how some people with bpd can be aware of their issues and my ex wife runs from the thought of it.

&nbsp;

> She saw a book on bpd and said she wants to strangle people who write this crap.  Is acceptance of bpd that hard, i have my own issues and I'm working  on them and I can acknowledge them but is it different for people with bpd, what does it take ?  Also does a person with bpd know what their doing is wrong?, my ex wife is able to justify the verbal and physical abuse, does she really feel that on the inside.  Sorry if the post is all over the place, my mind is all over the place atm.

relationship_advice,fpjak7x,t3_gdsu83,1588661705.0,">we met through a mutual friend almost 2 years ago and have been dating ever since. he's been my best friend throughout high school, even though we went to separate ones, and i can't imagine my life without him. we always have the best time together and he makes me feel so loved constantly. we've definitely had our issues (such as his super religious parents not accepting me, while my family loved him and always spent time with him or him claiming i ""can't take a joke"" any time he jokes about something i'm not comfortable with), but aside from that, we were basically inseparable until 6 months ago. out of nowhere, he told me that this random girl had added him on snap and started sending him pictures in dresses, asking how they looked.

&nbsp;

>he said he just told her they were nice and she started flipping out and saying that he didn't deserve me as his girlfriend, so he blocked her right away. that said, i had no idea who she was or how she even knew he were dating because he claimed she didn't follow him on instagram. i didn't really think much of it until i got a dm from this girl later with a screenshot of their texts showing him begging her not to tell me and that he just thought she was cute and maybe they could keep in touch. after that, a lot more details began to unfold, like how she was sending him bra pics, which he conveniently left out.

&nbsp;

>i was crushed, not only that he had been hitting on her, but that he had lied about it, especially considering how my past boyfriend had been unfaithful and he said he would never hurt me like that. it was clear that he felt awful and super guilty, but i told him i needed some space and time to think. after a lot of thought, i told him that i wasn't sure if he would earn my trust back, but i believed in second chances so i wanted to give it a try. slowly but surely, we took our time and began to get back to where we were before in our relationship, but there was always this lingering fear in my mind.

&nbsp;

>he's a really friendly person, leaving him with a lot of friends who are girls. i never really had an issue with that before, but found myself becoming a lot more jealous and paranoid about them all after that incident, which i hated. i even began getting upset over certain girls he followed/posts he liked which is really not who i am or want to be at all. because of quarantine, we haven't seen each other in a couple months, which has been hard (though not anything new, we were long distance for 3 months before), but also made me think about our future. we've talked about the possibility of breaking up before college for a while, but it's always ended in him saying he wants to be with me/would never put me in a situation like that again and me not sure if i should believe that/not wanting to be the paranoid girlfriend.

&nbsp;

>along with that, it's been kind of telling how little of a priority he makes me in this period of time where he has nothing but free time every single day, but again, he's said that he's working on that and i can see that progression. i love and care about him more than anyone i've ever met, but i'm not sure if it's all too little too late. my friends have been in favor of us breaking up for some time now, but i know that they're just trying to protect me.

&nbsp;

>i really don't think i'll be happy if we stay together in college and i've communicated that, but it's left me lost about when to end it. shouldn't we both give each other time to heal? and is it better to get as much time out of it as we can or not worth it to keep a relationship going with an expiration date on it? we've also discussed taking a break to figure things out on our own, but i'm scared that'll just lead to a breakup

Crushes,fpj8j9e,t3_gdshtf,1588659838.0,">I've (F) been crushing on a friend (M). We were watching a movie and drinking a bit. Next thing you know, later that night we are holding hands, then heavy make out and petting.. I think he tried to initiate sex? He tried pulling my pants off and I said no. He said he respected that followed by us kissing, him spooning me and being very vulnerable with his words. Like, saying sweet things and opening up to me. Telling me my hair is so soft and bringing up conversations we've had the past couple months. We have been friends for years (maybe about 10). The next day we barely texted, we did speak a bit too then 2 days later I asked to hangout to possibly see if anything came out of this?

&nbsp;

>So he drove to my town to hangout for 2 hours. In conversation he said he's a very shy and insecure guy and drinking makes him loosen up. I even initiated holding his hand a bit but that didn't go anywhere. He said bye and went on his way. We'd chit chat a bit over the week. I tried to initiate another day to hangout but he declined the night I wanted to hangout. I was pretty sad. After that movie night I was happy thinking it may have gone in my favor? He still likes my pictures and views my stories, so he's not ignoring or ""ghosting"" me. Sometimes he'll send me memes. If I had to describe his personality, I'd say geeky guy.

&nbsp;

>Since he declined the last hangout I decided I'd leave it up to him now. But now I'm tied between ""is he too shy to initiate like he said he was insecure"" ""or did he regret it all and is just trying to remain the basic friends that we were?"" He does not strike me as someone who would use somebody but I would hate that because we are friends. Go do that with somebody you haven't known for years? Would he really Want to risk a friendship? I could be overreacting. I tried to hangout like 10 days ago. Since then I've let it go. We've talked a bit online since then but I think we are both just shy and insecure to bring up that night .

&nbsp;

>I have feelings and emotions, so it's hard for me to finally have that moment with my crush and then it doesn't follow as I had hoped for.

offmychest,fpj2s9t,t3_gdrjgr,1588654994.0,">I'm basically writing this because I spend so much time feeling guilty about this and I don't know what to do about it. I hope this will provide some relief. When I first went to college I was so scared about meeting new people. Lucky for me I met (what I thought at the time) my best friends the second night there. It was me, G (female), D (male), and C (male). We all instantly clicked and started hanging out all the time. We did everything together, eating, studying, hanging out. I felt so comfortable with them and I can genuinely say that it was the happiest time of my life. However, I somehow messed it all up. G and D ended up rushing and joining a fraternity and sorority.

&nbsp;

>All of a sudden it felt like they didn't have any time for me and C. I know it wasn't always their fault because a lot of the stuff they were doing was mandatory. It was just that they kept saying they would have more time in a bit when things calmed down, but then they kept saying that and needing more and more time. It ended up feeling like they just didn't want to spend time with me and C anymore. It was really hard to go from doing everything together, to just me and C all the time. We didn't really have anyone else, just each other, but it got hard only spending time with him. I started to get more and more depressed.

&nbsp;

>I know C was going through some hard times at that point too and was struggling a bit with depression. I didn't always want to spend time with just him, but I did't have anyone else to do stuff with at the time. When the semester ended and summer started and things got worse. It was a tough transition for me to go back home because things aren't great with my family. C got pretty clingy at that time too. It I didn't respond to his messages, he would keep messaging me and send me voicemails of him crying asking if I didn't want to be his friend anymore until I responded. One of these times he sent me a voicemail saying that he got diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder.

&nbsp;

>This really freaked me out since my sister has BPD and depression. I had a panic attack for the first time in my life which freaked me out even more. It was a pretty bad attack, I was crying and hyperventilating and I felt like I couldn't breathe. He then began the desperate messages. He started saying that he was in a really bad place and that he really needed me. I remember one message said something like ""please just say something or tell me to kill myself."" I wasn't in the mental place between everything going on with my family and the panic attack to help him. I took the advice of a friend and ended up sending him a message basically telling him that I can't help and that he really needs to seek professional help before blocking him on basically everything.

&nbsp;

>That was about a year ago. It's been hard and this year was really hard making new friends. Nothing has even been close to feeling as happy as I was that first semester. Sometimes I just sit and wonder how I fucked up the best part of my life so badly. I think about C a lot too and how I left him when he needed me most. It makes me feel like the shittiest person in the world to do that to someone when all they needed was me to be there for them.

&nbsp;

>Sometimes I think about texting him and saying sorry but I'm too scared too. I don't know what to do.

UnsentLetters,fpimg6l,t3_gdozth,1588643967.0,">I want you to know I'm more sorry than you'll ever know about everything, I wanted to just give in and drop everything when you called that night. I never wanted to let you go, but after spending all that time without you I knew I'd never be what you need. I cant be enough and I'm sorry that I put you through everything I put you through. I knew if I went back even if its what you wanted at the time that I'd still make you miserable, I didnt mean to hurt you more. I've tried to change and I have kind of, and it wasn't for her. I know it seemed like I was giving someone else more than I ever gave to you, I'm just trying to survive.

&nbsp;

>I'm not ok and I haven't been for a long time, I ended up drinking any time I spent time with her cause it was the only way I could manage really but she ended up cheating and I left her. It didn't really hurt me any cause I was thinking of you through it all. She actually broke up with me when I messaged you to see if you were OK, then she decided to get back together but I was to drunk to know what was going on when she decided that. Idk what I'm going to do from here cause I miss you so fucking much, but Im sure you're past it now and I know that I'd be an even bigger piece of shit if I tried latching onto you again.

&nbsp;

>I wish you could have stayed in my life in some capacity, I miss seeing you play with all the kids and seeing Leon go nuts when he sees you pull up. I miss your smell, you're love. I miss having some sort of anchor, I feel like I can't do any better. I cant drive down the highway in Missouri without crying for a bit because i think of all of our trips and how we seemed to always drive off into the sunset down that highway when we left.... most music just takes me back to different moments we had. I deleted so many pictures of us to act like I was ok and so she wouldn't get upset but I sent the ones I couldn't lose to my sister and asked her to save them for me cause I couldn't handle losing them.

&nbsp;

>My favorite was of you with your legs up on the dash of my baby blue 72 Comet when we went to Springfield for my car show. You looked so beautiful, and you looked so happy. we had our issues, but you were so good to me and I couldn't see it. You made us dinner every night, you made sure my laundry was done, I cant even count how many times I ended up laying on your chest crying about shit. I'm so sorry about the nights I got wasted and told you that you disgusted me and that you didn't deserve to be happy, I was fucking terrible to you.

&nbsp;

>You still sat behind me quietly crying and rubbing my back while I threw up everything I drank that night. You finally walked away and im so fucking sorry I pushed you to that point, I thought I was making progress towards treating you better after you left me the first time. But I was lazy, I couldn't meet you halfway to help you follow your dream. That was it, I didnt even get to see you again. After 6 years it ended over the phone, no real good bye. It hurts so fucking bad but I know I deserved it.

&nbsp;

>I hurt every time I look at the sailships I got about you and honestly most of my tattoos are and will be for you in some capacity, just like the one you got after you left. I wish I could call you, but I doubt you'd even pick up. Part of me wishes I was selfish enough to try and get you back. But luckily most of me is willing to just sit here hating myself and missing you hoping that never seeing me again is whats best for you. I love you babe, and I always will, im sorry. Forever yours

CritCrab,fpig4jv,t3_gdo1jz,1588640205.0,">These two moments happened in one session of the same campaign. Some backstory, I was playing a in a party as a heavenly shaman with a ranger, a fighter and a homebrewed class that is basically van helsing. We was level 3 I think and those who played the pathfinder shaman class know they are basically useless until level 6 or 7. Some of the characters were debating to keep mine in the party due to lack of use and she was still young. She over hearing, these planned a way for them to 'see' the errors of her ways and how she is an essential asset to the party. She had a fae dragon with whose obvious goal is to pull off the ultimate prank was in.

&nbsp;

>The fae dragon ended end drugged the party up on gnomish ale for them to pass out. I then convinced some passing by rangers, thanks to lucky rolls and one of them being a wood elf, to help of my ruse of them being kidnapped in spiderwebs in the basement and I alone was able to rescue them. Myself and the rangers made scuffling upstairs to sound like fight and went down and 'rescued' them. Once up stairs and not seeing any bodies they question the scenario until I shouted ""they went that way! Quick we can catch them!"" Which coincidentally lead us to the cave we were sent to investigate to begin with. Once in the cave, we all had to make a perception check which I failed miserably.

&nbsp;

>The Van helsing character succeeded stating there was a huge cave spider above us ready to attack. My character didn't believe him for on moment. She said, ""No there isn't I'll prove it"" rolled a percentage die to see what random direction I threw the torch. DM then said in disbelief, roll to hit. Natural 20. Roll for damage. Max damage. Stunned the DM makes a DeX roll to see if the spider fell. Nat 1. Rolls for damage. Max damage. KO'd the spider in one hit. In short, there's a spider! I dont believe you watch! Cave spider falls to its death beside shaman. ""Oh I guess there really was a spider"" needless to say, she felt she proved herself fairly well that session.

rantgrumps,fpi8r7m,t3_gdmxat,1588635925.0,">Game grumps has changed. It's not me, it's them. They say ""oh your sense of humour has changed and that's fine"" but I go back to all the older episodes and I'm still laughing my ass off as I was when I originally watched it. I don't do that anymore. If my humour has changed then I wouldn't be laughing at older game grumps videos. They've changed their demographic to young kids and the lgbtq community (which I have no problem with those people btw).  But not only that they've changed basically everything. The content, thumbnails, titles, power hours, everything they're putting out now just feels like a spit in all the OG fans faces. I loved game grumps. I would try and get all my friends to watch it.

&nbsp;

>This isn't me 4-5 years ago either (even tho I was doing that). This was me up to like 2 years ago trying to get my friends to watch them. They felt different than every other gaming channel. Quality, not click bait thumbnails, not click bait titles, titles that are actually about the video, even content nowadays they just repeat old jokes from their ""glory days"". Nowadays they don't even play games cause they want to but only for the sake of getting views. Plus with longer episodes, they're basically putting out longer, less quality content. They used to value quality over quantity. The mini skits, April fools day stuff, grump out stuff, ad skits (the one with Jon and Arin for shirts and the crunchyroll ads still crack me up), random videos like tasting weird fruits or game grumps hotline or eating the giant gummy bear, those type of videos that they did just to have some fun, the subtle humour from Matt and Ryan instead of Ben forcing out obnoxious garbage ""humour"", they would've got rid of ghoul/jingle grumps had people not complained.

&nbsp;

>All that plus the thumbnail and titles and other things I listed before, they don't do ANY of that anymore. All these little things that nobody else was doing. It's the little things that make for quality stuff. It's these thing that drew me to them all those years ago. The power hour used to be one of my favourite things of theirs and used to actually put out quality stuff but now they just make a mess, literally.

&nbsp;

>Like I'm not 10, I don't get entertained by grown men making a literal mess out of things. I don't even know why they bother having a theme or topic for power hours anymore cause they never legitimately try and accomplish something. Nothing's well thought out. Might as well just give them random shit from the trash and it would probably turn out the same. For example look at Unus Annus. If you don't know it's a channel run by Mark (Markiplier) and Ethan (crankgameplays). I've always liked Mark but I hadn't really watched his Markiplier channel in a while even tho I was subbed.

&nbsp;

>And I honestly didn't even like Ethan that much. So when I first heard about this Unus Annus channel run by them, I just brushed by it. But about a month ago I watched a few of their vids and I've been hooked since. Basically each video is them trying to accomplish something or them trying something new with a professional instructor. What I love about their channel is they're being genuine. Sure they make jokes and are trying to make each other laugh but they take whatever they're doing seriously and actually try to accomplish something. And again this is coming from someone who didn't really even like Ethan. I really like the guy now. I love how they are genuinely trying to accomplish the task they have and aren't making fun of whatever they're doing.

&nbsp;

>They're putting out quality stuff and I've been subbed ever since I first gave them a try. I couldn't help but think, this is what the power hour should be. Two guys genuinely trying to accomplish something. I've gotten off track. There's probably more stuff that bothers me that I missed but I assume you get my point. Matt and Ryan were saving their channel but when they left, game grumps left. Supermega today is what game grumps used to, and still should, be. One last thing, I understand why Arin gets hate but I think he gets too much over the top hate. Like he's allowed to have his opinion on games.

&nbsp;

>Just because he doesn't like your favourite game doesn't mean you have to shit on him. Sometimes he deserves it but a lot of times he doesn't. On the other hand Dan gets his dick sucked by all these new fan girls that tell him he can do no wrong. I'm not saying Dan should get hate but tone the dick sucking down a bit jeez. They treat him like a God. He just reuses jokes. His whole thing was to tell life stories cause he knows jack shit about games after 2000 but he's run out of things to tell. He just adds random commentary now that honestly isn't funny. He can never carry out a joke, he just goes ""you know what I've never thought about that"".

&nbsp;

>He's become so passive, bland, and boring. He's so out of touch not only with games but just in general. Arin actually has personality and used to be really entertaining and funny when he was just being himself. Plus he actually knows a lot about games. He knows what's popular, video game wise and culture wise. Arin playing runescspe with supermega was game grumps' last best series cause all three of those guys could bounce off one another and actually carry on a bit. Even in the Mario party and monopoly play throughs, Arin, Matt, and Ryan were constantly bouncing jokes off one another and there were times when Dan was just talking to himself cause he had nothing to add.

&nbsp;

>Arin could be himelf cause there were others carrying the load for him but he should just always be himself. That's the best Arin. But take Supermega off and Arin turns into a COMPLETELY different person when it's just him and Dan. Let me just end this by saying I love Dan and Arin. They carried me through highschool and even a bit in university. They're good people and anyone claiming otherwise is an idiot. They've just lost what made them special because of all the reasons I listed above. Trust me I REALLY REALLY don't wanna feel like this but you can't choose how you feel. I wouldn't have made this long ass rant if I didn't love those guys

StimSisters,fpi1qm2,t3_gdlsjx,1588631951.0,">Last redose was like 12 hours ago, and Ive been fully tapped out since then. I'm feeling ""alright"" though and honestly I didnt really feel the need to redose at all during the day (so far) anyway. Sooo yeah it's been 12 hrs and I've got at least 5-7 more hours to go until I can let myself go to sleep (I've got responsibilities to take care of). Anywayyyyy I havent really kept up on the house during this small little binge. Nothing crazy, but like my sink is full (double sink, but one side is for drying). So its just a handful of plates, a few bowls utensils and some cups/mugs and like an empty cake pan on the stove. I need to fold/put away laundry, and I *could* do some laundry.

&nbsp;

>Its literally only 1 loads worth, so it's not out of control, but its bothering me. The rest of the house is fine honestly but I'd like to wipe down the counters/tables/stove, and sweep (after I washed the dishes/laundry). Technically I could put it off until tomorrow, it would just mentally drive me mad. I feel like I cant relax unless everything is cleaned/picked up (even off stims). Plus I just feel guilty for not doing them over the last several days, so I feel obligated to do something so that I'm not a total waste of shit. Except I have 0 energy, unless it involves talking or texting/typing (which is still taking a bit of extra effort).

&nbsp;

>I've had/have some bare minimum things that I have been/am taking care of today and I have no problem doing that or meeting those needs. It's just laundry/kitchen/floors that I cant seem to do. With my energy levels approaching 0, I cant muster up the motivation or drive to do any of it. I obviously cant stay focused on one thing long enough to even start, and all the lovely physical symptoms I get are hitting me full force (dry/scratchy eyes, feeling every single hair, eyelash, fuzz, fiber, etc that ""lands"" on my skin, the pain and physical exhaustion from all the tension). So anything that is task related, but like specifically requiring me to physically/repetitively move my body, is not going to work, because they are so overpowering that its distracting and requires even more energy that I dont have.

&nbsp;

>So I basically move at a sloth/snail hybrids pace when trying to clean which just pisses me off, so I stop. I can't decide if I want to take 1 gabapentin to get rid of the physical symptoms or not because it's been long enough without a redose that it might just make me want to fall asleep. Which I cant do right now. But I feel like if I was able to get rid of the physical symptoms I could do the dishes and fold the laundry at least. So idk what to do. I dont want to fully let myself relax on my phone/tv/coloring because then I'll get stuck there for hours and definitely wont get any cleaning done.

&nbsp;

>So I'm just sitting here, doing nothing...completely wasting all of my time with my stupid indecisiveness. Soooo if anyone comes across this, pleeeeeaae leave a comment. I dont even care if you dont have a suggestion. If I'm going to just sit and do absolutely nothing, at least the conversation with someone who gets it will help keep me coasting...hopefully. Ugh, happy Monday. Lol

dating_advice,fphto7p,t3_gdkigl,1588627608.0,">There’s this guy. We’ve been close friends for several months now. Towards the end of 2019 we found out we both were interested in each other, so we started to date. Dating him was...interesting. He was always super nice and supportive over text message, but barely even talked to me in real life? Like at school he’d just ignore me. It was weird, but I let it go because after school he’d always text me about how much he likes me and be so supportive. He’s a pretty shy guy, so I supposed this behavior was because he was scared of expressing his true feelings to my face. Then, things got weird. During Christmas break we both were going on vacation, so we couldn’t see each other.

&nbsp;

>We texted all the time and stayed in touch. He was so nice, supportive, and loving. But, things were just awkward between us when we got back to seeing each other in real life after the break ended. We planned a date, and it was so awkward. Our dates never used to be that awkward. The next day I asked him what he thought about that date and he said he enjoyed it (I still think he’s lying). At this point, I was thinking about ending it. I didn’t really feel that connected to him anymore and the fact that he would ignore me in front of our friends at school was becoming increasingly annoying. I didn’t want to be lame and do it over text, because he’s in my friends group and I wanted to preserve our friendship even after we broke up.

&nbsp;

>I asked him, “when do you want to go out again? Are you free?” since I was planning on breaking up with him when we met next. He bluntly replied, “I’m busy this week.” He straight up blew me off. I asked to FaceTime him, but he denied. He was being distant and weird so I just decided to break up with him over text because he wasn’t giving me any other options here. It would’ve been ten times worse if I dumped him at school, since we’re always surrounded by people. So, in the nicest way possible, I sent the break up text.

&nbsp;

>He said that he was actually relieved and that he’d been thinking about breaking up too. So you’d think that was that and it’s all just water under the bridge. But no. After the break up, we continued to go back to being good friends and talked regularly, and suddenly things weren’t awkward anymore and it was great. But, keeping such close contact with him made my feelings stay. Also, every couple weeks after we broke up, the topic of our feelings came up in conversation. He’d tell me that he still has feelings for me, but it’s just too hard to date because of his busy schedule and maybe we could get back together in the future. All these things that he would tell me made it extremely hard to get over him, and my feelings still lingered.

&nbsp;

>I told my best friend what was going on and she said that he’s being manipulative and telling me these things just to make sure I never get over him. Months passed and we still remained good friends. I was annoyed that I still had feelings for him, so I straight up asked him what we were and what he planned on doing about us. Then, he told me he has “commitment issues” so it’s going to take a while for him to be ready to be with me. At this point I was really annoyed and decided that it was time to exterminate all my feelings for him.

&nbsp;

>But, it was really hard to do that because we were such good friends. Now we’re in quarantine, there’s no chance that we’re going to be seeing each other until this whole virus thing is over. It’s hard to stop thinking about him because we talk a lot, and I really just want to get over him. So, I just gave up and left him on read. We usually always respond to each other bc we are good friends, but I just didn’t know what to do. He won’t take initiative and tell me what we are, so I just decided to let him go and distance myself as a friend. It is hard and I do feel bad. Am I right in doing this?

&nbsp;

>Is it finally time to just move on?

dogs,fpgvcku,t3_gdew3m,1588610179.0,">\*\*Introduction\*\* Hi everyone. My husband and I are in the research phase of getting a second dog, and we'd love some more opinions and advice about breeds.  1)	Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?  \* No, we have one dog already, a mixed breed rescue called Bobby who we've had for 2 years. He's naturally pretty chill but we've trained him all the basics and a couple of simple tricks.  2)	Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a \[reputable breeder\]( [http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html](http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html))?  \* We've got our hearts set on a puppy so almost certainly a breeder.  3)	Describe your ideal dog.  \* We want a dog who will have a good bond with us, who likes to spend time with us going out walking and jogging in the countryside.

&nbsp;

>We'd like a dog who is friendly with other dogs and humans, and gentle with children (as human babies are hopefully in our future too!)  4)	What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?  \* It sounds a bit odd but our main criteria are that the dog is at least as big (preferably bigger) than Bobby (who is \~35lb) and not too hairy! We like labradors, English springer spaniels or even a Vizsla.   5)	What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?  \* To run with us, to fetch and play with toys, and any other more breed-specific training like agility as appropriate.

&nbsp;

> 6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?  \* Not particularly! But if the dog really took to a particular discipline we'd be up for pursuing it! \*\*Care Commitments\*\*    7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?  \* 2-3 hours most weekdays, longer on weekends.  8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?

&nbsp;

>   \* An hour or two every day, longer on weekends and holidays. At present we take Bobby out 3x a day for walks, and there are ample opportunities for running around and playing on our walks, as we're lucky to live in the countryside.  9)	How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?  \* Happy to brush about once a week, and do necessary grooming at home.  \*\*Personal Preferences\*\*  10)	What size dog are you looking for?

&nbsp;

> \* >35 lb  11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?  \* Shedding up to the sort of labrador level, not too much barking and minimal slobber!  12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?  \* Very important.  \*\*Dog Personality and Behavior\*\*  13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?  \* Snuggly, but it's ok if this isn't all the time!  14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?  \* More eager-to-please.  15) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?

&nbsp;

> How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?    \* Like our current dog - barks if he's out in the yard and someone comes past. Once introduced to people happy to go up for pets and attention!  16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?  \* No.  17) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?  \* Overly fearful of other dogs. Strong drive to chase livestock.  \*\*Lifestyle\*\*  18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?  \* For about 2 hours each weekday afternoon.

&nbsp;

> 19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?   \* My husband likes bigger dogs and he prefers short-haired breeds. 20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?  \* One other dog, as mentioned, and a pond full of goldfish!  21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?  \* Not initially, but the family might grow in future!  22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?  \* N/A  23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

&nbsp;

> \* Rural part of UK. We have BSL against pitbulls and pitbull-mixes which is terribly unfair.  24) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?  \* Summers in the 70s and winters in the 40s. Rather a lot of rain!   \*\*Additional Information and Questions\*\*  25) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.  \* Thanks in advance for all your insights. :)

LucidDreaming,fpgpgp7,t3_gddxal,1588607136.0,">So crazy I took a nap and In this dream I was laying in bed smoked 2 bowls and laid down put something on the tv and than all these vibrations started happening in my vision, it was like the whole world was vibrating and during that I started to see Hallucinations, like I remember just seeing little things but I couldn’t really see them because of how intense the vibrating was. The whole time I thought it was real and I was like over dosing on something, like I would think what is going on, am I going to die ? It went away and I thought what just happened and I hoped it didn’t happen again but it came back and I was trying to go on my phone to call my mom but I couldn’t because it was too hard to see the screen and I was freaking out trying to make it stop getting mad and yelling, but it goes away eventually .

&nbsp;

>Somehow I got in the bathroom laying on the ground with my vision getting darker and darker and I was saying to myself don’t let it get pitch black because once it dose you’ll be dead and than it just went away. This part is weird Idk if I had a false awakening but I remember everything felt normal no vibrating or anything and Idk remember what happened for me to get here but I was walking into my laundry room and there was a dead dangled up deer on the washer and I looked at it and was like wtf but for some reason I didn’t think it was that weird even tho it all felt like it was real, I went upstairs and my dad tells me something and now I have drive somewhere, I remember thinking in the dream oh no what if that happens driving, ( I forgot to say but with the vibrations and seeing things it would sometimes make me just lose control of my body and it would shut down but I could get control of my body fast again.)than

&nbsp;

>i end up at some construction zone where they are taking down an abandoned building and I’m just in there on a scooter riding around The building.

&nbsp;

>than I just wake up in real life thinking wtf was that dream. I’ve had a dream like this before with the vibrating happening but these super weird dreams only happen when I take naps not every nap, only some naps it happens

Stoicism,fpgaf6t,t3_gdbgzv,1588598459.0,">Around 10 months ago, my family adopted a puppy who was a mix between a Labrador and a Basenji. He was a normal puppy for the first few months and my friends adored him and my family quickly fell in love. He was incredibly intelligent, more so than any dog we had ever seen. He could learn new tricks in 30 minutes or less. He understood our commands and I swear he could even understand a little English. As he got bigger, he got scared. He would get nervous doing simple activities he had done before, he would be scared of boxes, brooms, fishing poles, trashcans, and any new item that was brought into the house or backyard. Eventually this terror progressed to our friends and extended family members to the point we had to have him on a leash and put into another room when people came over.

&nbsp;

>He had never shown these behaviors before. We hired a dog trainer to help understand why he was abruptly doing this, as he never showed this aggression to my family in the house. To us he was perfect, until something from the outside world came into the house. Eventually he started lunging at new people and physically could not calm down until they had left. The dog behaviorist could not figure out a solution. No one knew what was wrong with him. In hindsight, we know he lost his mother before he could even see, spent the first few weeks of his life in an animal shelter with much larger dogs who would bark at him incessantly.

&nbsp;

>Eventually, he got too aggressive towards others. We had to make the decision to put him down. I am not at all an emotional guy. My mother likes to joke around that my father and I are like robots. In the vet room, I have never cried as much as I have before, and my father (who I had never seen cry before) wept with me. This situation had been unlike any other I had experienced. However, I knew deep down, we had no control over his behavior. It made me calmer, and it made me strong. I was there for my dog in his final moments.

&nbsp;

>I comforted him. I comforted my family. However death is natural. I know that. Everyone dies in the end. I had always wondered if it came down to it, would I really be able to practice Stoicism when life got hard. And the answer is yes. I feel at peace, and I comforted my family. I introduced to them the ideas of Stoicism. Though life is hard, you must never let it bring you down.

Leopardi,fpfojh6,t3_gd74tl,1588577888.0,">And, furthermore, I tell you frankly that I don’t resign myself to unhappiness, nor do I bow my head to destiny, nor do I come to terms with it, as other men do; and I dare desire death, and desire it above everything else, with such ardor and such sincerity as I believe it is desired in this world only by a very few. I would not speak to you in this manner if I were not completely certain that, when the hour comes, the facts will not belie my words; for, although I don’t see yet an end to my life, I have a profound feeling which almost assures me that this hour is not far off.  I am too ripe for death; and I think it to be too absurd and incredible for me—so dead I am spiritually, so altogether concluded as the fable of life is for me in all its parts—to have to last for another forty or fifty years, that is as many as Nature threatens me with.

&nbsp;

>At the mere thought of this I shudder. But as happens with all those, evils, which go beyond, so the speak, the power of imagination, so this seems to be like a dream and an illusion, impossible to realize. Indeed, if someone talks to me about the distant future as of something belonging to me, I can’t help but smile to myself—so confident am I that the space of life remaining to me is not long.

&nbsp;

>And this, I can say, it is the only thought that sustains me. Books and studies, which I am often surprised I have loved to much, projects of great deeds, and hopes of glory and immortality are all things at which I can no longer even laugh. At the hopes and the projects of this century I don’t laugh; with all my soul I wish them the greatest possible success, and highly and most sincerely do I praise, admire and honor their good intentions; however, I don’t envy posterity, nor those who still have long to live. In the past I used to envy the fools and the stupid, and those who have a high opinion of themselves; and I would have gladly changed places with one of them.

&nbsp;

>Now I envy neither the stupid nor the wise, neither the great nor the small, neither the weak nor the powerful. I envy the dead, and only with them I would change places. Every pleasant fantasy, every thought of the future in which I indulge, as happens, in my solitude, and with which I spend my time, consists of death, and nothing else. And in this desire I am no longer troubled, as I used to be, by the memory of dreams of my early age and by the thought of having lived in vain. If I obtain death, I will die so peaceful and so content as if I had never hoped for, or desired, anything else in the world.

&nbsp;

>This is the only good that can reconcile me with destiny. If I were offered, on one hand, the fortune and the fame of Caesar or Alexander, pure of all stains, and, on the other, to die today, and if I were to make a choice, I would say, to die today, and I would not want to think it over.

Pets,fpfnz7q,t3_gd70xi,1588577330.0,">I am a student in college. I live with two roommates. One of which, Clare, I have lived with since August 2018. My other roommate, Brittany, moved in with us in July of 2019. In September of 2018, I got a cat, Leo. I found Leo on petfinder and shortly after I arranged to meet up with Leo at a nearby PetSmart and talked to his foster mom. I then came back to the PetSmart a week later to officially adopt him. I had spoken to both my roommates about two weeks prior about getting Leo. I sent pictures of him Leo from Petfinder before I even got him to let them know where I was in the process. Both Clare and my other roommate at the time were on board with me getting him.

&nbsp;

>Leo is a great cat. Leo also has some special needs. He has seizures for which he takes medication for daily. He also has anxiety that causes him to over groom at times and rip his hair own hair out. It is very sad but I manage it as best as I can by making sure we have a very diligent routine. At some point I will look into another medication for his anxiety, but the vet has been hesitant to prescribe one not knowing how it could react with the medication for his seizures. Come July, Britany moves in. Britany has her own cat too, Toby. Before I had Britany sign the lease months prior, I made sure that Leo and Toby met up so there I could know they would get along.

&nbsp;

>Me allowing her to move in with Clare and I was contingent on that. Toby and Leo got along just fine. They weren't best friends or anything but there weren't any problems between the two of them. They would hang out and sleep near each other frequently. Funny enough they both slept with our other roommate Clare every night. Unfortunately, Toby had passed away from medical complications in December. I can't imagine how hard that was for Britany. She had talked vaguely about wanting to get another cat eventually. I didn't have an issue with this. Nor did my roommate Clare. My problems began when she brought home a cat suddenly with talking to us prior about it.

&nbsp;

>Just to make matters worse, it was the same day I was leaving town for a long weekend so I couldn't even be there while her new cat, Theo, and my cat were meeting. I was extremely upset that she didn't formally ask me prior and even give me a heads up that she was coming home with home. To me, that a BIG no no when you live with roommates. But I didn't want to cause tension, so I but my tongue. My trip was very nerve-racking and all I could really think about was the cats. I was terrified of them not getting along and it stressing out Leo.

&nbsp;

>Sure enough, I had reason to be terrified. I came home and instantly knew something was wrong with my cat when Clare told me he's been hiding in the cabinets almost constantly and that he's not been eating all of his food (sleeping in the cabinets is something he has done before periodically but not for multiple hours a day). When I went to grab him out of our bathroom cabinet, he was not excited to see and was cowering away. This was extremely unusual for him. I bring Leo into my room and close the door behind him so he can be alone. I then talk to britany and she says that Theo and Leo get in a physical fight once every single day and it has to be broken up by either her or Clare, but nobody know who is starting it because it happens when they aren't paying attention.

&nbsp;

>My cat leo has been in the same two foster homes since he was a kitten. I still regularly communicate with both of them and have them cat sit for me a couple times a year. Leo has never not gotten along with another cat or dog for that matter. I am already certain that these fights are being instigated by Theo. I bring Theo into the room with Leo that night to see what happens. Sure enough, when Leo was dead asleep and curled up in a ball, Theo crawls over him and starts VERY aggressively biting his throat.

&nbsp;

>I immediately break it up and tell Britany what I saw. We determine that the cats need to be separated at all times. I started reading a lot of stuff online about how to reintroduce cats. We then started regular site swapping for 4-6 hours a day and feeding them on each side of a door (and eventually a gate). They seemed to be doing good with the feeding ritual. And things started immediately getting better for Leo as far as his hiding and appetite, but he still isn't quite his normal self. We tried to remove the gate once, about a week into the reintroduction, and let them play. My thought process was that with a laser to act as a distraction, Theo would not go after Leo.

&nbsp;

>That didn't happen. Theo launched himself onto Leo's back within 15 seconds from behind and instantly starting biting him. There was a lot of howling but idk honestly it's coming from. Theo gets out back in Britany's room right away. At this point, I have little hope for them being able to cohabitate. Britany feels that I am attacking her and her cat and blaming it all on Theo. Well, I kind of am. My cats isn't doing anything wrong. You bring a new cat in here and it fucks everything up. I don't want to have to lock my cat in my room for half the day but that is what we've had to do now.

&nbsp;

>I ask her how she's feels about keeping Theo at her boyfriend's or her parents house for the remainder of the lease (both of whom live only an hour away) and she seems appalled that I would even ask. She says ""well I pay the rent too why would Theo go instead of Leo?"" BECAUSE MY CAT LIVED HERE BEFORE YOU EVEN DID AND YOUR CAT IS THE ONE WHO ACTIVELY ATTACKING MINE AND EXACERBATING HIS ANXIETY. I am trying to explain to her that when you live with roommates, getting pets is a group decision that everyone has to be okay with. She didn't ask me about it. If I had know that she was starting to actually look at cats again, I would have happily become involved in the process and arranging for the cat to meet Leo and made it very clear that they must get along.

&nbsp;

>Sure, we all pay rent. That doesn't mean I can blast music loudly at 3 a.m. just because I pay rent too lol. So that argument is redundant to me. Fast forward another week and a door was left open very briefly and Theo ran into the the room where leo was and started attacking him again. It was probably about 15 seconds before I had got in to break it up because I was far away. Theo was on Leo's back and was ripping out chunks of his hair. I pulled Theo off and the hair feel out of his mouth.

&nbsp;

>I am so upset I can barely keep my tears back. My poor cat is being terrorized and I see no long term solution. Theo was previously a stray that britany rescued. The humane society said they didn't observe aggression while he's was in their care. I don't know what would be causing him to attack my cat completely unprovoked. I am losing patience with keeping Leo locked up all the time. My family lives 4 hours and 45 minutes away. If I brought Leo there, I would rarely see him. He also needs medication every twelve hours which would be difficult for them to commit to. He doesn't do well when he is left home alone for extended periods of time and gets very anxious.

&nbsp;

>My cats at home also don't like any new cats coming into the house. The couple times I have brought him home they away at him and his constantly. Britany says Theo can't go back to her parents because it's not their responsibility to take care of them and she doesn't want to dump him on them. She doesn't want to bring him to her boyfriend's for a reason I can't understand. They see each other every weekend. Her boyfriend likes Theo and was with her when she picked him up and told her ""if you don't get Theo, I will get him"". Her boyfriend has a dog but the dog isn't aggressive with cats and loses interest after a few minutes.

&nbsp;

>I know this because his dog has come to my apartment and I would see him interact with Toby and Leo. So instead my cat has to be tortured and walk on eggshells for three months of our lease???? She doesn't seem to have much logic about this. Please help!!!!!

OffMyChestMen,fpfnnqn,t3_gd6z7u,1588577020.0,">So I have a couple of friends, and I'm super close with both of them. They were in a relationship that lasted about a year and a half before breaking up. I've been close friends with the guy since I was like 11 (I'm 21 now) and I started talking and becoming really good friends with the girl a couple months before the two of them got together. Throughout their relationship things were kinda rough for them,we live in a small town and the guy moved to a city, not a crazy for drive but very difficult with busy schedules. This was the girls first relationship because she has very strict parents and she can be very emotional, she is adopted and has been through hell before her adopted family, but when her parents found out that she was dating they basically kicked her out of their family and she ended up coming to my work because she was freaking out and didnt know what to do, things are much better with her family now but all of this was too much for my friend because he had just moved and was juggling a job, schooling, and other personal problems.

&nbsp;

>What ended up happening was whenever the girl had a problem she would tell me about it, I ended up becoming the person she could turn too when she needed help and she was there for me when I needed someone to talk to. She even told me things that she wouldn't tell her bf because we spent so much time together.

&nbsp;

>I've never really been one for sharing but with her I just feel comfortable opening up with her. I've also never been one for dating, I had a rough relationship in highschool and everytime I find a girl I like things just go south fast so I stopped trying, but after my two friends broke up, me and the girl were having some drinks and I was helping her get over her breakup (she was pretty upset about it) and I sorta realized that all the problems that she had with her bf we mostly things that I was there to make up for... if that makes any sense, like she would want her bf to go grocery shopping or to just go for walks and things like that with her and those were the sort of things that we would do when we would hangout.

&nbsp;

>She even would make an offhand comment after they broke up like ""sometimes I wish you made the first move"" and I dont think either of us have any plans of getting into a relationship with each other because of the fact that we're really close as friends and because her ex is my friend, but fuck a part of me really wants it. This is a really complicated time in my life and I know that making a move will just make everything worse. She's usually the person I would go to with this sort of thing but I felt like it would be a bad idea to bring it up to her haha.

&nbsp;

>If anyone even bothered to finish reading my rambling I hope you enjoyed I guess, just writing it down actually helped me more than I thought it would.

Dreams,fpfmvis,t3_gd6u47,1588576274.0,">So, I need someone to explain this to me. Some context, I'm a 15 year old, I had a gf for 2 years, and I yesterday I repaired a computer and his monitor was actually broken (I carried this PC a lot). This thing isn't so NSFW, but it has some strange things happening. So, I woke up in the dream, I don't know exactly when, It's like I was dreaming 2 different things at the same time. I was with a friend in a big meeting, i was standing down, and a guy looking like Gary Vee started talking about computer science. After the meeting, I was with a friend, in the same room, and I suddenly saw most o my sport teachers. Then, this guy looking like Gary Vee came to me and one of my friend, that's actually really good at computer science, and my friend started talking about some color system we use in our school.

&nbsp;

>The good part starts now. I went to my grandma, to pick up the broken computer that was somehow supposed to be repaired. At the same time, but somehow before this, I was at a party with a bunch of kids, and some random 5 yr old girl just came to me asking something and eating napkins, like 4 times. Then, I was in my grandma house. I entered the house, and the room where my grandma and grandpa stay was empty, except for a girl. She was kind of the most attractive, but it had something more, like she was a god, like she was beyond her looks, beyond everything, everything she said was like she could see all the futures possible and she picked the one that made me the happiest.

&nbsp;

>So, I went to talk to her, idk what happened, but she was sitting down, and she was like ""Don't act like your so masculine and strong"", and I felt like, idk, mixed emotions, and I asked her ""Why are you here? How can my grandparents have room for you?"" then she told me ""You don't know?"" I freaking knew it, I saw everything, my grandma died, I went to the kitchen, my mother was there with her brother, she actually took me to kitchen, that girl, and my grandpa..

&nbsp;

>his skin was blue, his eyes were blue and he looked like he was dying, but he was moving, he had his eyes open. I told him smth about my childhood, but my mother told me that he doesn't remember anything. I went back to the room where this girl was with the PC in my hands. I was searching for a monitor in all my grandma electronics, but I found nothing. You know, how guys think when they really like somebody and they're alone, but, this time, I didn't want everything, I haven't realised that such a perfect women was near me, and everything that she done was beyond reality. The way she was talking, she wasn't sexy, no, but everything that she said was perfect.

&nbsp;

>The good things, the bad things, she said them in a way that lead to the happiest outcome, like she knew that after she said this everything will be perfect. She also looked smth like what my brain actually finds atractive since I was a child. So, while I was searching for a monitor, she came, idk what she said, then I freaking kissed her, but, it felt like it was 100% normal, and we started kissing, and all I was thinking was like ""this perfect women, or my girlfriend"", but it felt so normal that I couldn't resist. I didn't think 1 second about sex, but her moves were somehow sexual.

&nbsp;

>AND SUDDENLY, somebody knocked at the door.  A group of guys, mexican, latinos, punk girls, one blonde guy, and a guy I saw on facebook a long time ago looking for some attention, waere in front of me. The guy I've seen on facebook asked me to suck his dick. I heard the girl behind me ""not again, not you"", he said that if I wouldn't do it I'd die. I tried to fight, to kick him in the balls, but it was like they were made of rubber. And suddenly, behind their back, some dude ran, and they were after him. I was a spectator. I saw how they tortured him, telling him to suck this guys dick, they we're all heading to my grandma exit door to her yard.

&nbsp;

>I went there too.. I looked back, that girl was near some wizard, she was standing with her back at me, and they just flied in the sky. Meanwhile, a whole funeral procession was made for that guy, and it was getting bigger. After that, I was naked, I only had a t-shirt on me, in the middle of my city, but no one cared. I tried calling my girlfriend, but sometimes she wasn't responding, sometimes I had her phone instead of mine. After all of that, I went on a Christmas tree on a paid road (a road that I needed to pay to drive on"" and a lot of drivers saw me naked, and I destroyed a lot of things.

&nbsp;

>After, I met with a nurse from my city, that I knew because everytime when I was going to my gf (in real life), I was meeting up randomly with her. (she is one of my mom friends). She told me about online school and how she couldn't use zoom. What the fuck had I just dreamed? What the fuck is this? I feel like I met the best girl ever, not the best, the most perfect, beyond perfect, but wtf were those mexicans doing that shit.

helpme,fpfj131,t3_gd64zg,1588572739.0,">I'm really frustrated and lost right now. I'm struggling so badly to be productive. The stuff I need to do during the day like attend online class and take notes I get done but it's so hard for me to focus otherwise, and I'm retaking a class this quarter that I can't fail this time around. It's like no matter what I do, once classes are over for the day everything takes so long and so much effort to do. I can't focus for shit I sit down to work and it's like every five minutes my mind wanders off and then I blink and I back at my desk 15 mins later nothing done. Like constant intrusive annoying asf daydreaming. I keep forgetting assignments even though I have alarms set and a calendar on the wall w everything I need to get done.

&nbsp;

>And god the amount of procrastination. I don't even know that it's necessarily lack of motivation I just CAN'T FOCUS. I'm so fucking tired. It was easier in hs bc there was so much less to keep track of and teachers gave constant reminders and second chances and then college came and it was way tougher and now it's online and it feels impossible. I feel like I'm barely scraping together what I need to get done and even then some thing's I'm not getting together at all, and I could do better if I was less unfocused and better at time management. I feel even when I do work for hours I barely get anything done, **especially** on the weekends.

&nbsp;

>I wanted to try to fit in way more extra studying and practice probs etc bc now I'm at home and there's nothing else to do but it's like there's no organization to my anything and everything takes me so long I don't do the extra studying that could earn me the slightly better grade I want. The class I should be doing the most in is still the class I'm doing the least in bc usually when I get extra work done it's just for the classes I actually like bc I understand what I'm doing in them and they're more interesting so it's easier. Even this is a procrastination but idk I'm so fed up.

&nbsp;

>What do I do????

relationship_advice,fpfewcm,t3_gd5gfo,1588569223.0,">Sounds stupid, and very childish. But to simplify stuff, I had lots of very intense trauma as a kid and as a coping mechanism learned to be egotistical and only care for myself and only love myself as a “survival” tactic. I could always care and love for other people, but always to a limit, and that bar was set low. I have had boyfriends in the past, but it was always so easy for me to let go and I think I was just in it for the excitement of having a crush on someone and feeling as if someone was able to take care of me. Now, I’m in a relationship with a guy I’ve loved and been best friends with for three years, and no one has made me feel this comfortable.

&nbsp;

>I’ve never let anyone take control over my emotions this much and it scares me so much. All of my past relationships were like little puppets to me, but now I actually care for someone. I have abandonment PTSD and have been going to therapy for a few months for it now, but had a horrible breakdown in early January. There was not a day that I did not experience flashbacks and I kind of dumped that all on my boyfriend. I would have panic attacks every day, I wouldn’t eat a thing for days at a time (and if I tried, I would vomit at times), I wouldn’t sleep for 1-3 days, I had no motivation, nothing.

&nbsp;

>That went on for 4+ months, but recently I’ve felt like I’m finally getting better. I still get anxious, I don’t trust, and all of that mess, but I’m better at calming down and accepting my feelings. My boyfriend is still growing, and a bit “immature” for a lack of better terms. When he doesn’t text back for 10 hours at a time and I tell him it makes me nervous, he genuinely feels bad, tries to fix it, and just forgets. It’s a lot to elaborate on, but I’m better at handling my end of it. But it scares me that I’ve told him 4+ times, and as much as he tries, his behavior barely changed. ************************************************I’m scared of how vulnerable I’ve been in this relationship overall (being honest, sharing real feelings, not protecting myself mentally) and I’m scared for it to end because it’s one of the few things in my life that I’ve put value over myself.

&nbsp;

>I’m overwhelmed with the new feelings of love that I should have learned as a child and I’m scared of how good of a person I’ve been. I’ve been more considerate, caring, and giving, and I hate every part of it because I’m scared it will go unappreciated and I’m out of control. I’m scared of being vulnerable. I’m scared he will hurt me and that I won’t ever be able to trust anyone or let myself feel this kind of love again. I’m not sure if this is normal, if I should be cautious, if I should just let myself be happy for now and if something bad happens I’ll deal with it then (I’m scared of regretting not being cautious), if I should break up with him so I don’t get hurt, blablabla.

&nbsp;

>He hasn’t been the best boyfriend, but he is trying and I’m giving him a chance because I’ve never loved anyone more. I hate being out of control with my feelings. I’m scared of being hurt and I’ve started to distance myself from him a tiny bit so that I can feel as if I’m protecting myself (he does not notice my absence much so it’s not hurting our relationship). If someone with experience could give me some advice it would be of great help, because I don’t know what to expect and what is/isn’t a side effect of my trauma.

&nbsp;

>As I said earlier, I’ve been in relationships before, but never one where I genuinely cared for the other person. Before it’s always been for self-gain and nothing more.

UnsentLetters,fpfd3rd,t3_gd55yz,1588567775.0,">After everything you’ve done to me, I still love you. It’s been eight months since we’ve even talked. I think about you every day. I found out you ended up making your dreams come true. You finally made it. You’re finally a marine. That’s what you always wanted to do. I’m so happy for you. Somehow I‘m still able to find it in my heart to be proud of you...and somehow I’m still able to find it in my heart to love you. You were my first boyfriend. You were fourteen, I was fifteen. I should’ve known we were too good to be true. Even with all of the red flags I ignored. We both have the same birthdate. 27. Just an eight months difference.

&nbsp;

>We have the same, more rare eye color. There are so many strange things we have alike, down to our very first memory. You came into my life after I lost my grandfather. When I still believed in something, I prayed every night to have my soul mate. Just something to make me happy. Give me my one true love. Not much longer, you came along. I thought you were the one I prayed for. I looked at you like an angel. I should’ve known someone couldn’t fix me. But you made me so happy. You filled a void in my heart. We were on and off for different reasons a few times. One time I was crying out that if we were meant to be together you’d somehow find your way back to me after months of us being apart.

&nbsp;

>If we were truly meant to be. You came back a few days after. I thought, again, it was a sign. You were the one. My heart always belonged to you. Someone could treat me like a queen. You could treat me like I’m nothing. You’re still the one I’d want. I feel I have no right to miss you. To even think of you. But I can’t help how I feel. I’ll always wonder, “why” when it comes to a lot of things involving us. I’m sure I’ll never get any answers. It breaks my heart that we’ll probably never talk again. You’ll probably have a beautiful family.

&nbsp;

>Regardless of what you said to me. You’ll probably be so happy. You’ve always had so much life. It kills me that you could die at any moment and I’d have to live with that. It kills me my love isn’t reciprocated, but I want you happy. I wish I knew the truth about a lot of things. I can’t believe some of the hurtful things you said to me. How other people were, “always there for you”. Were they there for you when you had problems with you mother who’s an alcoholic? When she was all drugged up and in rehab? When your parents were fighting? When your mom was depressed? Did they still care for your mom after she hated them and didn’t want them around you anymore?

&nbsp;

>Because I did. I still care about your mom. Did they sit and give you endless advice? I was there for you through **everything**. Why do they get the credit? I broke my heart over and over again because of you. Every night. I settled for less than the bare minimum. I don’t understand why you treated me the way you did. Why you did the things you did. Were they really always there for you? They tried to destroy me. Us. I should hate you, but still I love you so much. I keep thinking of Jack and Rose and Romeo and Juliet. Those couples have our initials. They’re both such tragic love stories. I keep listening to, “my heart will go on”, on repeat.

&nbsp;

>My heart is completely broken. I’m never going to be completely happy with anyone. There’s always something about them that depresses me. You were my first. That’s what I always wanted and fantasized..that I’d end up with my first. So unrealistic of me, but I remember being in first grade sitting alone at lunch thinking of my future husband and you fit the description. It kills me that today would’ve been five years. It kills me that I remember this. You probably don’t even remember our anniversary date. You didn’t care about our anniversary before. You blew me off. It was always true love on my end. I know that’s it’s not reciprocated. If you’d of cared about me I’m sure you would’ve tried to fight to keep us together.

&nbsp;

>You would’ve gotten in contact with me by now. There’s so many things that point to you not caring. I kind of think you never did care. I don’t know why my heart goes on loving you. I wish it would stop. If you were to ever see and read this I think I’d cry. Or if someone we knew saw this. I have zero friends anymore, so it would just be someone I know now. I have to live with all of these memories of us. They hurt my heart. You talked about me moving in with you. I told you I’d think about it. We were broken up and friends then.

&nbsp;

>Trying to work it out, but things escalated. Even when we were broken up, you still said I could come stay with you. No one else would’ve been that welcoming. There’s always been something special about you. It stays in my heart, forever now. If I were to be asked why I love you, I don’t think I could come up with an answer at the moment as to why I do, or why I should. I know you probably deleted anything involving me by now. I still have pictures of you on my old phone, along with things you drew me. I feel like a creep for keeping them, I just can’t bring myself to get rid of them.

&nbsp;

>I wish I still had the pictures you drew me when I was sick. I wish I still had very old pictures of you. But I deleted those when we broke up one time. We were around sixteen then. Part of me wishes you’d reach out to me, but I know we can’t be together anyways. I’ve made so many mistakes myself now. I hate myself. I wish I could go back in time and undo some of the things I did. I’m so conflicted right now. I’m so unhappy. I’m constantly disappointed. I’m depressed, but that’s nothing new. Things just keep getting worse. All I know is that it hurts me that you can seemingly move on like I was nothing. I feel like I was left for dead.

&nbsp;

>I feel so much guilt and disgust with myself. I wish that I didn’t love you anymore. I know that I always will. It doesn’t matter what anyone else says or does. I really despise this life and I hate the things that people do. I hate how they are. I thought you were different. I thought we were the same way. To me you were heavensent. I always set myself up for disappointment thinking you’re going to come running to me. I know you’re not. I wish you’d talk to me. At the least so we could clear stuff up. There’s so much that’s been left unsaid. I know it’s no use. I’m trying to move on with my life.

&nbsp;

>It’s hard. I keep destroying myself more and more, day after day. People contribute to that. I’m everyone’s scapegoat. It doesn’t matter what I do. I’m always hated, demonized, and shunned. Unnoticed. I love you, and I’m sorry that I do. I hope you’re happy, I’m sure you are. I feel like I freed you. I’ll never forget you. I love you. Happy would’ve-been fifth anniversary.

rapecounseling,fpf4n3r,t3_gd3rk4,1588561680.0,">During her first year of college, my girlfriend was violently raped at a party. She and her friend were extremely drunk and a man held her down and raped her while her friend helplessly passed out on the floor from her drunken state. She said it was the worst pain she ever felt in her life and was bleeding everywhere. She was rushed to the hospital soon after the incident and kept passing out and throwing up all over the place from the incident. This incident left her mentally scarred. She has serious depression and anxiety from that day and has trouble doing every day activities because when she thinks about the incident her mind goes into shock and she cries. In person, she has randomly cried a lot and I didn't know what it was from until one day when she told me about the rape.

&nbsp;

>She texts me every other day while doing schoolwork or anything slightly challenging saying ""I can't do it anymore, I can't do it anymore"" while crying on FaceTime for several hours. I also seem to be the only support in her life. I have seen her when her mind is not on the rape incident and she is a cheerful person with many hobbies, interests, and a hugely positive attitude on life. When a thought about that college that she attended, her friend that was there, her period, or the month when it happened triggers her memory of the event, she cries, runs away into solitude and gets very angry.

&nbsp;

>Her anger toward the guy who raped her is incalculable because from what I understand, he joined the army and changed his name. (Her friends did some research and they have tried to find this SoB but to no avail). My girlfriend visits a psychiatrist but nothing seems to help. It is really sad to see her unable to function in normal human life because all she can think about is getting raped. What should she do to help herself, what can I do to help her, and what can we do to find the man who raped her?  How can she return to normal functioning life. She has not told me all the information about him because I did not want to push her to talk about the incident if it made her uncomfortable.

&nbsp;

>I assume that there are people out there that can help bring this sorry excuse for a man to justice and I would like to help her. I love her and I feel horrible every time I see my girlfriend depressed, angry, and afraid in her life because of this incident when she was violated and harmed. Thank you for your thoughts.

relationship_advice,fpf4ggp,t3_gd3qlt,1588561555.0,">Hey everyone, throwaway account. I (22f) am having an argument with my boyfriend (22m) which is leaving me very sad and upset. I just want to know if I am the one overreacting or not because he claims I am. I haven't seen my boyfriend for 2 months because of coronavirus, even though we only live 15 mins apart from each other. We are both home from college and staying with our families. His family has been taking this coronavirus situation very seriously, and have not even ordered take out food. They only have their groceries delivered and have only seen their immediate family who live within the household (besides his grandparents- they sit in the driveway 6+ ft apart once a week). My family is also taking this very seriously, but we have been going to the grocery store and ordering take out (with total caution and we wipe everything down).

&nbsp;

>We have seen a select few people outside of our immediate family from distancing on our driveway. My boyfriend has told me for the last 2 months that he does not want to see me because of the coronavirus, which I totally understand. He is immunocompromised and his grandparents are at risk. However, I am moving in 10 days to another state to start a job and will not see him until October if I do not see him before I go. My boyfriend told me that he does not want to see me before I go because my family has been ""out and about"".

&nbsp;

>However, the day after I leave he is taking a week-long class for a motorsport he has been wanting to learn to do for years. I asked if he would say goodbye to me through social distancing on the driveway, offered to wear a mask, and even a hazmat suit if it meant I could see him in person before I go. He told me ""no"" and that its different because ""he's been wanting to do this sport for years"". I then told him that he is being a huge hypocrite and he told me I am completely overreacting. I am now crying and extremely upset. It really feels like he is picking this sport over me and I think it says a lot about the way he feels about me.

&nbsp;

>Am I wrong for being upset and thinking he is being a huge ass for taking a class with random strangers but not willing to see me from distance in the driveway? It just hurts me and I don't know what to do.

BreakUps,fpex4p0,t3_gd2n28,1588556855.0,">I've known him for 4 years. As soon as I got to know him well, I liked him. Maybe loved him already before we even got together the first time. We got together the summer before my freshman year. We dated for about 7 months, and then, things just weren't working out, so we broke up. We remained best friends, and as we got closer, I realized that my feelings had only gotten stronger. So we got back together the summer before my junior year. That lasted 9 months, until I broke up with him last month. I saw a complete switch in his personality. He didn't show initiative in wanting to talk to me. He played minecraft with his friends all the time. If I asked to call, he'd leave their group call, but he'd still be playing.

&nbsp;

>He stopped asking me to call. I confronted him multiple times about the issue, and he didn't try to solve it. So, I broke up with him. I hoped reality would hit him, and he'd finally understand how he'd been treating me, but he didn't. I cut contact for a couple of days, and then tried to talk to him again. He pretended like nothing was wrong, and so did I. After about 2 weeks, I asked if he'd be willing to try again. He said he didn't feel the same way anymore. That really makes me feel like he never loved me to begin with. It's not that easy to get over someone.

&nbsp;

>So, now, I feel like I wasted 4 years of my life giving him all of my attention. I feel lost, because I just lost a person I had a very strong bond with, because he just didn't care anymore. I gave him my first kiss, and we made all of our film projects together. Projects that I'm so proud of, but I can't look back on without feeling depressed. Most of my personality traits are taken from his. I mean, I practically grew up with him. From 12 years old, to turning 17 in 2 months. I already have several mental health problems, so this is NOT helping at all. I'm looking at having to start therapy regularly again.

&nbsp;

>For several weeks after the breakup I had terrible mood swings. Now I just feel more empty than I used to. So, how can I make it hurt less?

teenagers,fpevlbq,t3_gd2et7,1588555895.0,">Today I wanted to play minecraft with my friend, who couldn't play past 5:30, at 3. That gives us two hours to play with each other (cause he needs to get off before 5:30). But of course, my little brother had to be a bitch and was complaining that he never gets to play, even though he plays the most out of everybody. So I ask my dad if I could play from 3 to 5 and he goes fine but at 5 exactly, you have to get off. I say sure what ever. Now, at 2:40, my mom comes home and I asked her if she could give me a haircut and she says sure. This is her first time cutting hair (cause of quarantine), so it takes awhile.

&nbsp;

>It took about 30 minutes, so it was 3:10. Then I had to shower to get the hair off, cause there was a lot. By the time I actually start playing, it's 3:30 so I tell my dad instead of playing from 3 to 5, I was gonna play from 3:30 to as long as my friend could play before 5:30. He goes ""No. Everybody is gonna get the same two hours of play time."" Meanwhile, he is only letting me play and hour thirty while my older brother who played before got 4 hours and my little brother who was gonna play last meaning there was no one to kick him off, so basically no time limit. I said that it wasn't fair and I was going to play the two hours I was promised.

&nbsp;

>So when it turns 5, my dad tells me to get off and I say no, that's not fair. Then he calls my mom, who surprisingly took my side. This is where the fun begins. Now once it turns 5:20, my little brother has literally been counting down the seconds until he could play asking every five minutes if I'm almost done (and he does this every day so it gets pretty annoying after awhile). I tell him I'm almost done and I'll call him when it's time for him to play and that if he asks again then he can't play minecraft (cause I bout the game with my own money that I got from my job).

&nbsp;

>Next thing he does is ask if I'm almost done. Then I say, ""Now you can't play minecraft."" As soon as he gets on, he starts to play minecraft. I say ""You have 5 seconds to stop playing before I turn the PS4 off""    He doesn't get off. So, I turn off the playstation. This happens about three times and on the third time, he tells my mom. My mom says to let him play minecraft and I say no, cause it's my game and he pissed my off (just so everybody knows, I don't have shit to myself. Like nothing. I share a room with my brothers and they always go through my shit).

&nbsp;

>My mom starts to get pissed off and yells at me to let him play and I say no, I bought it and it's mine. I don't want him to play. So now she tells me to give my phone to her and I say why. Then my dad comes in and starts yelling at me, so basically, we go back and forth and he finally says ""You keep saying no to me and that is disrespectful so I am taking your phone."" I said ""Do you know why I keep saying no?"" and he says that it isn't important. How the fuck is that not important. I have my own opinions and it isn't my fault that you think it's disrespectful.

&nbsp;

>So now he took my phone for the rest of the night and I'm on my laptop writing this. I keep asking him how I am supposed to have my own opinions if he thinks they are disrespectful and he just keeps ignoring me. How the fuck am I supposed even live in this house if my opinions are disrespectful. Anyways, sorry for the long post I just needed to say something somewhere and I don't have my phone to talk to anyone.

BPD,fpeikyb,t3_gd0h9g,1588548245.0,">As a child I was diagnosed with ptsd but haven't been to therapy or on any medication ever. As I've gotten older I've been accused of being over emotional, over dramatic, moody, mean, judgemental etc. by my family and closest friends. I've been like this my whole childhood  just too serious and thinking and seeing too much and hating myself and everyone around me, but also thinking I'm superior, but also shit? When you're a teenager people say you're moody or whatever, and that you'll just grow out of it, but when you're an adult, and you have to work and have relationships, you can't afford to be moody and depressed and antisocial. Essentially I have all the symptoms in varying degrees of BPD and one of my latest revelations is that I fixate on an idea and either dream or involuntarily daydream a detailed, point by point scene of these awful, sometimes sick things that hurt me and things I just don't want to think about.

&nbsp;

>I want to stop. I know it's irrational. But I can't calm down. It's to the point that I've realized that I almost believe the things I imagine and create to the point where I can't distinguish dream/fixation from what really happened. Even in arguments I constantly add interactions and phrases that never occured. I'm literally angry, envious, paranoid and just feel empty and scared and beyond depressed all at the same time. It's getting harder to function and do important things.

>I haven't been to a doctor in almost 4 years because of it. Every car I've had has broken down because I couldn't get the will and motivation to go get them fixed. I literally have missed so much work and school because I can't leave the house and dropped out of my university even though I had two years left because I couldn't do it. It's just getting worse and worse and I can't afford a psychiatrist and don't have insurance. I'm trying to see a general practitioner this week so I can get antidepressants/antianxiety/antipsychotics or something. I don't know what to even say to start and if I should even mention that I think I have BPD. I'm starting to get desperate and scared and I just need SOMETHING.

>I feel like I just keep getting closer and closer to completely losing my mind.

MormonSexAbuse,fpebkg1,t3_gczf3j,1588544247.0,">I struggled with my knowledge mormonism was a lie and the the family reinforced brainwashing, i was told about the true story santa claus at 9 and read darwin at 6 , i had past life memories and hid that till i got a copy of the discourses of joseph smith first edition signed from my step dad. His grandad had been a bishop when joseph smith was alive, and he was molested by him at three, so these had not been edited by the church in them joseph smith talked about reincarnation and the “fact” he was the reincarnation of jesus christ . when i read this i told my mom, which got back to my step dad and he took it away! i had only gotten to chapter 14.

&nbsp;

>yeah, i have seen read and experienced alot. in mormonism as a gay man with a bi brother, two lesbian sisters, a trans brother and an asexual brother, it was hell. my trans brother , asexual brother, and bi brother were raped by my and the trans brothers step father. my mother was raped by three bishops, had a relationship with two oyher bishops at 17 and 23, and i witnessed some evil shit in the temple I saw gorden b hinkley stab a baby swaddled in a white blanket naked, the baby was put on a black granite or marble stone alter on a scarlet blanket on the alter, he stabbed the baby in the chest and as the blood drained out it went down the rock alter in a groove in the alter in a goblet, ( that looked like the cup in d micheal quinns book about mormons and magic, the dagger was in the book too.

&nbsp;

>well when the cup was full gordan b hinkley drank the blood and passed it to the guy next to him, it went around the room! NO I DID NOT DRINK! he ate the babies flesh, they told me that this is the true sacrement, well my step dad explained what had happened after. he told me that the religion was the oldest religion and all larger christain denominations practice this. he said it started in babylon, and that babylon ruled the world and the beast needs a ritual sacrifice during certain times, sometimes on a mass scale loke 9/11.

&nbsp;

>i heard several names refering to the “ dragon” the KEK marduk , moloch, apep great god of chaos.  ive had to live with the knowledge my whole life this goes on all the time and i am powerless to change that! i cant save those kids! how they get the kids or babies is the social services, or they ordain a woman to carry “the lamb of god”to be sacrificed!  my step dad told me God is actually the servant of the red dragon mentioned in the bible, and he pretends to be the creator to lure people to be his army and his worshipers ready to be sacrificed.

&nbsp;

>i really dont care if you understand or believe me. most wont, but you cant imagine knowing that this happens all across the world in mormon temples, the vatican, evangelical churches, muslim mosques , mason temples, and most of the worshipers are naive to what goes on. i can tell you there is a underground hallway to the mason temple that has a like black alter in their basement too, and the pink room or nursery is next to this room, and you get to it with a hidden door through the nursery or a passage from the outside down into the hall then to the room, this passage is heavily guarded. neddless to  say i have a lot of sympathy and empathy for others and still love people who follow jesus or any other good heart philosopher, but the church and its organization i will never forgive for the evil they did to me or others i know, i will not forgive them for the harm done to others.

&nbsp;

>i love the members, my grandparents on my moms side were true followers of jesus. what i have witness is an increase in anti culture since bush jr and extremely inflated now during he of the orange who will not be named!  we need to educate our mormon relatives and friends to bring their teachings back to jesus and back to peace, so they dont join the ever increasing group of mormons turning into a mob.

&nbsp;

>just remind them its about jesus, always bring it back to jesus. you will rarely show them its false but you may avert a lgbtq suicide, a senseless hate crime, or worse. thanks for reading. love you all, we are all human and deserve freedom, peace and the persuit of happyness!

autism,fpe5lrm,t3_gcygjt,1588540811.0,">Hello, let me start by saying how deeply I love and care for my husband. We are in our mid twenties, and have been together since we were teenagers. I have known from very early in our relationship that he has autism. His mother told me privately, when we had one of our first big fights. I honestly could not tell. He is very very sweet. And sensitive. He would cry a lot over seemingly little things, and I chalked it up to being new adults.We also faced some intense pressure because we both come from poverty, and desperately wanted out. So we were working and going to school. Lots of stress. Now that we are married, living together, and we are going to try and get pregnant soon.

&nbsp;

>Our dynamic has changed. He and I are older, our personalities have rounded out a bit. Now that he is a man (I almost want to cry saying this because it has warmed my heart growing up together) he cries less, but it comes out in the way he speaks. Mean and cold tone. When he is upset we basically are unable to communicate. He becomes defensive, and he literally cannot understand what I am trying to say. Does not help I am not an English speaking native. He takes things very literal. word for word. I am a patient woman, and I believe he is my soul mate, so this has been hard but it has never threatened our relationship because he can acknowledge that he has trouble understanding sometimes.

&nbsp;

>We just revisit when things are more calm. But I have noticed some troubling behaviors. He moves things a lot. Such as rearranging the rooms in our home, kitchen cabinets, books, etc. If we are not in the same room he will become uncomfortable from the silence (or maybe my lack of presence) in that room and he will clear his throat a lot and finally will follow into the room. I do alot of the housework, I work full time as a chef, so I also cook dinner for him every night. I have done that for almost 2 years. The other night, i came home from work (new job because the service industry is not doing too well) and I was a bit later than I thought and was unable to thaw the meat in time for dinner to be ready when he got home and he lost it.

&nbsp;

>He is a very big man (big and sweet hehe) and works very hard at his job so when he comes home he is usually starving. He really flipped out on me and I almost left him. He knows I do this for him out of love and kindness, and it is not to be expected. But I do it so often, that he does expect it, and I have become part of his life/routine that can be ‘threatened’ for lack of a better word. I truly hope this makes sense.

&nbsp;

>I feel as though I have supported him very much and he is now reliant on me and his behaviors somewhat reflect this. I am worried because what if I die? And we have children. He recently quit seeing a shrink. He thought he didn’t need one and I believed him for awhile. I attribute to some of this because he is also unhappy with his job. I don’t mind doing these things for him and I don’t intend on leaving ever but how can I be the best wife I can while lovingly broaching the subject of seeing someone again?? He is very open and honest (receptive?) and therapy has done wonders for him in the past. I can’t help him in that respect.

&nbsp;

>Thanks guys so sorry for my long nonsensical rant.

OpiatesRecovery,fpdz2n2,t3_gcxe79,1588537107.0,">I’ve never posted on reddit before & this is going to be longish. Sorry in advance. My brother is a junkie. A heroin user. An addict. Whatever the fuck you want to call him. He’s 28 and I’m 25. It all started when we were younger I was 17 and he was 20. I noticed he started to mess around and take a pain pill he bought from friends here and there. He also smoked a lot of weed which wasn’t alarming. Even taking pills here and there didn’t alarm because it seemed as if everyone else did stuff like that all the time. Fast forward to when he’s 21 and he has a bad accident. He fell out of a tree and broke a bunch of things and cracked a vertebrae that could have been much worse and a bunch of ribs, concussion etc he got pain pills obviously.

&nbsp;

>He basically just never stopped doing pills after that. Idk how it went from 0-100. It just seems like a haze. Suddenly one day, my brother, my best friend, was just addicted to pills. I didn’t think much of it even though I was concerned because he ALWAYS shit talked heroin users. He would make fun of people he knew from HS and say things like “I would never do heroin” and make fun of those people and say how disgusting they are etc. Fast forward again, I moved away. My mom and him came to visit me. He kept asking me how to get pills the whole time.

&nbsp;

>I said I didn’t know because I don’t do that. He freaked out, ruined an entire vacation, and I literally sent him away on a bus to the airport after he blew up and started talking mad shit while apparently withdrawing from the pills.  He was the rudest, meanest, craziest person I’ve ever dealt with in my life. I didn’t even recognize him. That’s when my mom and I realized his addiction is much worse than we thought. Fast forward again, I moved back home. I immediately could tell he was a worse “druggie” than I thought and that my parents realized. I told them “he’s on heroin” they didn’t believe me and freaked out on me.

&nbsp;

>Then he admitted it to me. “Yes I’m on heroin but I’d never shoot up. I’m afraid of needles. People who shoot up are disgusting” he said. I told my parents they freaked out. Then the truth finally comes out a few months later. He shoots up all the time. Suddenly now that we realized this things just got so bad so fast. He robbed my moms house blind. Stole everything of value from my dad. Stole credit cards and anything of value from my my grandparents and our other grandpa too. That’s not including the stuff he stole from me, my boyfriend, his ex friends, girls he met off dating apps, etc he would steal anything any way that he could.

&nbsp;

>It got to the point I had severe anxiety and depression from his stealing. I was always thinking about how he could break in at any moment and steal. I’d sleep with my expensive belongings. I would lock stuff up in the house I was in that was already locked. I soon became the counselor of the entire family. Every time my phone rang it would be a family member crying to me about how he stole again. He’s probably all together stolen over $30,000 since his addiction began. Maybe more than that. From one person alone he’s stolen over $13,000. My family is super stupid. Here is how the cycle goes. He steals from my elderly grandparents. let’s say credit card.

&nbsp;

>Spends $1500. They find out. He denies it as much as he can. Then he ends up admitting it after showing him we know for a fact it’s him. They don’t call the cops on him. He doesn’t care. Doesn’t say sorry. Grandma says for him to never come over ever again. 2 weeks later he’s back over to her house. He pretends to be super nice and “changed” and then steals again, she calls me crying saying he’s banned from her house forever. Rinse and repeat. Basically the same thing for my parents. My dad has never kicked him out. He says “he doesn’t want his son to die” even though he’s already died. And even overdosed in his home last month after getting out of a forced community service rehab thing.

&nbsp;

>Now my brother has a almost 50 year old ex alcoholic girlfriend cashier who is living with him at my dads house. My dad just cries and cries and complains to me but never kicks them out. Never kicks my brother out no matter what even though my dad has nothing of value since it’s all been stolen. He feels like if he kicks him out he will just go kill himself. LOL 😂 who cares at this point honestly. He’s already dead pretty much. I show them all things that prove they’re the worst enablers in the whole entire universe. My mom is the least enabling one but she still enables but just not as much as everyone else.

&nbsp;

>My brother has been in an out of jail for stealing for his drug habit. He’s now looking at 7 years in prison. He’s been to rehab multiple times and always gets kicked out. Kicked out for smuggling in alcohol. Kicked out for having sex. Etc Luckily, I don’t live in the same state as them anymore but they still call me to complain about all this shit. I really hate to say this and I’m probably going to get so much hate but I wish he’d just go to prison for SO long. Or just overdose without someone using narcan on him to save him. Just fucking end it already. Narcan is also enabling him. He can just plunge drugs into his veins and know if he did too much someone will just call a little ambulance with their “life saving drug” that will save him.

&nbsp;

> Just let him fucking die. He wants to die. He hates life. He hates himself. He hates his family. He makes our life a living fucking hell. He’s the biggest sociopath I’ve ever seen. He never has said sorry to anyone he’s hurt.  He hardly ever cries. He’s a cold hearted piece of fucking shit criminal ever since he became addicted to opiates. I used to love and care about my big brother so much. He was my best friend in the entire world. I miss him so badly. I don’t even know why I posted this.

&nbsp;

>I just need to vent. Insult me if you need to. I just don’t give a fuck anymore.

Advice,fpdtvjw,t3_gcwkgo,1588534131.0,"> I'm kind of looking for advice here. To recap I've known this guy for about 7 months when we first met I was 17 and I visited his house with a friend of mine and her bf to chill (bc I was nervous abt meeting a stranger basically) I was drunk as fuck we did nothing but there was a lot of flirting and instigating from him which I denied bc we'd just met) We hit it off really well I felt a connection with him like i'd never had before, he knew my age n I was worried abt starting a sexual relationship (it was 5 months before I turned 18) We kept meeting n I told him there would be no sex before I turned 18 but he was increasingly persistent although we never did and he mostly respected my boundries I felt uncomfortable at times bc he was throwing so much love and affection at me at the same time, we kept a ""thing"" is the best way I can describe it up until I turned 18 n then we fucked..

&nbsp;

>since then we've been together (I'm not telling most ppl bc it's not worth the shit i'll get) I've explained to him I'm still finding who I am and It's not a serious realtionship bc it's a big jump to settle with someone more than double my age..most of the time we're good but he's very obsessive with me, overly affectionate, and buys/offers me money constantly, Coming from a poor background this feels strange to me n I decline but he persists that I accept them,,which I end up doing to not feel rude.

&nbsp;

>Any mention of other guys he'll become very passive aggressive even if I've explained that we're good friends, blows up my phone 24/7 which is all good but I'm not used to this kind of ""love"" I have doubts. The doubts started when a few months ago he told me I couldn't wear a certain type skirt bc it's too revealing,I lost my shit n told him he has no right to tell me what I can wear etc and wanted a break when he still insisted I can't during this break shit went sour, he started banging on windows of buses I was on, sending me hundreds of abusive messages (worthless fucking whore for example) despite this I took him back ..it

&nbsp;

>feels like love. or I'm an idiot ,, thoughts? please tell me i'm a fucking idiot.

relationship_advice,fpdqspw,t3_gcw19q,1588532359.0,">I am a straight female freshman in college (I live on campus normally when there is not a virus) and my second day at the college I met an amazing group of friends two of which are guys (roommates) and one girl. We all got along right away and started to do things together like get food, go to parties etc. One of the guys and the other girl hooked up and quickly got into a relationship which they are still in to this day. The other guy was hooking up with a senior but she was whack and clingy so he lost interest. Unexpectedly, this guy took interest to me one night in the beginning of second semester after he learned that I was no longer seeing the guy I had been seeing all first semester.

&nbsp;

>We hooked up that night and there was insane chemistry between us that didn't fade and we kept ""seeing"" each other after that night. One day he asked me to keep things casual between us and said that I am all over him when I drink. He said this was because he didn't want the girl he was hooking up with previously to be hurt as she was at all of the parties we were at. Not going to lie though, I took this personally and saw this as his way of saying he didn't want anything serious. I backed off but we continued to have insane chemistry in the bedroom and he seemed very happy with how things were (I was too).

&nbsp;

>We joke around and laugh alot when we are together and we throw joke insults at each other but sometimes it feels like he means it when he ""insults"" me. The problem I have is that I cannot get this guy out of my head but I feel like he is going to lose interest in me and im scared that he was only using me for sex. We have been texting on and off during quarantine but he never seems that excited to talk to me. Ive never been in a actual relationship but I feel like this guy and I would be amazing together but I know im just going to be hurt because if I asked to be exclusive I feel like he would say no.

&nbsp;

>I feel like he is going to go for the freshman girls once we return to campus in the fall and im worried. Should I keep fighting for this guy cause I like him so much or should I move on? Or just go with the flow?

africanparents,fpdo1w9,t3_gcvl9t,1588530800.0,">Hey, I am 16 years old and is from Atlanta. I am a the creation of two Nigerian parents. Throughout my life I was one who always cared about others and put them before me. Ever since I was young, I’ve always experienced mental and physical abuse. I was always looked as a liar because of my young age or that I was seeking the need for attention. I can’t really remember how old I was ever since I started experiencing it. But what I will do is talk about the many things I can remember. I was at the age of 6 or 7 where I was friends with a bully who I thought was my friend. Both our families knew each other and we lived in the same neighborhood.

&nbsp;

>Since I was so young no one ever believed anything I’d say because of course who wants to listen to a little child. This bully was a female who enjoyed doing devious things and would blame it on me just to watch me get beat. The bully was at least 10 or 11 so she clearly had a sense of what she was doing. She would do things such as destroy my younger sisters clothing, write on our walls, or rip family pictures up. While I was getting beat for the things she did. I could see that it was some type of entertainment for her. I was in 4th grade and got molested by the son of my mother’s friend.

&nbsp;

>I didn’t know what to do, I was so scared and young minded that I thought I could be pregnant. Years pass by and as I got older. I developed serious anger issues that was looked as me being disrespectful by my parents. 7th grade had to be one of my worst years in middle school because I gradually became depressed and had anxiety. I had terrible teacher’s who seen me as an outcast and never took it upon themselves to really figure out what was going on with me. I reacted to people who tried to disrespect me in terrible ways such as saying hurtful things to them. Obviously something was wrong with me but it never got acknowledged. My anger issues grew worse as I remember throwing my phone on the floor until it broke while I was at school out of anger.

&nbsp;

>I only threw it because my phone had randomly broke, so I tried to make it even worse. The other students seen it as comedy, but deep down I was clearly not okay. I remember getting sent to the counselor and mentioning self harm (the worst thing I ever did). The useless school counselor told me shit that I clearly didn’t wanna hear, so finally she gave me a paper to agree that I wouldn’t harm myself. Yea I signed the paper, but she called my mom. My parents are extremely strict about things, but when it comes to the school calling them.

&nbsp;

>They will completely lose it. I got home and my mom was clearly upset about it that she started beating me with a broom all because they told her that I wanted to kill myself. She then told me to kill myself (which was not the first time I heard that) and took my phone from me. I spent the entire day crying (something I still do till this day) and was just upset with myself. Whenever I get like this I don’t even think about doing anything, not even eating. There was one time where I got into a physical fight with my sister (who is younger, yet bigger than me) and I had pushed her into the wall out of anger.

&nbsp;

>This caused a whole in the wall and I knew my ass was grass. What led up to the fight was my sister kept on taunting me and I was laughing about it and next thing you know she puts her hands on me. When my parents got home they were clearly upset about it and were mostly upset with me. They kept beating on me and arguing with me that I had yelled out “I wanna kill myself”. They then kept telling me to do it and this triggered me to have an anxiety attack. This continued to happen all the way up into high school. Ever since I’ve turned 16 I self diagnosed myself with anxiety, depression, and bipolar depression.

&nbsp;

>My parents don’t even acknowledge it, no matter how many anxiety attacks or mental break downs I’ll have. I just came here to speak because of what happened to me last night where it was a situation between my brother and I about whether or not he had taken my headphones. You’re probably thinking like wow headphones. Yes headphones because music is how i cope with my problems. Doing impulsive things such as smoking was and was not really helping me. My parents then got involved and started beating on me. Except this time I had cuts and bruises on my face. There is probably a whole lot that I am leaving out, but it’s kinda hard for me to even be typing this shit up.

&nbsp;

>Yes I want some help, but how will I even get it. I just want someone who I can talk to in person.

offmychest,fpdnzus,t3_gcvl8s,1588530767.0,">There's nothing I can do. Everything is just too much. I find a ray of light here and there but it's like it isn't enough. I simply can't hold on to a positive streak long enough for it to matter. I see things happening and they are all so fucking hurtful. I have zero time to do anything about anything at all as everything are stuff I should have done yesterday. I can't focus on getting better mentally because of pressure everywhere, either to pay rent when I don't have a job let alone the mental stability to sustain one, to keep food in the pantry, to do this and that and it's all one tangled mess that seems to have no way out of.

&nbsp;

>I can't even make sense at this point like I can't even construct a proper cry for help because it's so many different things happening at once and no one cares about it and yet everyone expects me to be fine and to care and to take care of everyone else. I can't be mad at the fact that every time, people do me wrong when I have never been anything but good. Genuinely. I'm the guy who people step on over and over and over. I can't even call on them like you're doing this and that because the only thing that will achieve will be further retaliation, which will lead to retaliation, which will lead to retaliation, which will lead to retaliation, which will lead to...

&nbsp;

>So I have to suck up everything and not even complain because when you do, people never accept their fault even when you show it to them and will even in their divine stupidity not acknowledge it. So, even if I'm right, I'll always be the one who's wrong in the whole story. So I can't say anything and have to suffer as everyone else gets stuff their way and whenever I raise my voice because it'll always get to a boiling point every now and then when you lose it, they turn everything against me or even worse, brand me a lunatic and not even pay me any mind, which alone is so mentally damaging, when your own mom gives you a look that says this guy is crazy and then says you're crazy before turning her back and leaving me to deal with the latest mess she just threw my way.

&nbsp;

>I haven't smoked in so long because I'm not okay, my lungs fail every now and then if I don't take care so I had to quit smoking and even though I know it's not the most constructive way out, at least I'm not doing coke or heroin like virtually every guy my age around here is. I can't cope anymore. I don't know what to do. It's like there's no future in sight, no light at the end of the tunnel. If anything there's only further shit to come. But I guess that's life right.

&nbsp;

>I very seriously fear for my life. And no one takes that fear seriously, no one takes me seriously lol that's got to be the most frustrating thing ever. If I could die, I would have done it a long time ago and not even five or ten years ago. I'd do it when I was 6 and had just realized just how awful the world was. Had it right at 6, still have it right now. It's what pops up every time I try to think of a way out. But I can't. My mom would die because apparently she does love me and I know she does in her own way and I'm virtually the person keeping this place together because they need me to wake up and to contribute however little I can, because we're all we've got in this world.

&nbsp;

>Each other. They wouldn't cope with the loss. I know my mom and sister better than they think I do. And I'm about to prove that to them. I had been in this past month dealing with a lot having quit smoking. I'm getting myself ready because no one took any directions nor any advice or perspective from the pot head. It had never hurt me much because I could afford not to care at the time. Dad left for his mistress, we're in a mess, mom and sis have dropped a lot unfair crap on me like they'd say things hot headed and I couldn't say much because even though I could, I knew I did fuck up by having fucked up with my education because of my stupidity in following ""brothers from different mothers"" who have now long since turned their backs on me.

&nbsp;

>Unfairly at that as well. While I did fucked things up, no one ever mentions that I wasn't the only one, you know? Everyone points and points and points. I know of about a million different ways of having my mom and sis begging me to forgive them. I could do that. Right now. Stand up and live stream that shit. They couldn't deny it because I have evidence, so their best bet would just be to fall to their knees and beg.

&nbsp;

>The same applies to my dad and to everyone else who did me wrong. I don't care. I never have. All I ever wanted was to be left alone and to do my shit. It's why I'll never shove it in their faces like you did this and that and fuck you for it. But it's got to a point where I can't do anything but walk in circles because that's what it is now. I'm not going anywhere and I'm just revolving around the same things over and over and not getting anywhere. Breaking point was a few weeks back. I had enough. I told mom she'd swallow her every word one day. She told me afterwards *what do you know of anything, you fucking junkie.

&nbsp;

>Go back to your fucking pot and don't you ever dare speak to me that way again or I'll have you on streets*. That was when I came here and asked for some help for our rent bill because we were all laid off. A generous lady soul helped. I brought the money home and gave her every dime. I was suddenly given all the respect I was long due. They asked me things nicely as if I were some sort of guest in their home. What a shit stupid fucks. I love my family more than anything else, can no one ever doubt that, but they did things to me that there are just no words for.

&nbsp;

>I'll never stop loving them and I'll always look after them, no matter what they do to me, I will. Because that's me. I don't care about things that need no caring for. My mom has a really bad depression, my sis struggles with her body image, even if she tries to pass off the confident vibes, I see right through her. I wrote it all down earlier today. All the plans and the after plans. I'm taking charge of this family. Just like I know I could have years ago but didn't because I thought my dad had it so I could just continue smoking in my room. I should update this in a month. Expected results are at the very least a general acceptance towards the start of a positive change and at the most the complete elimination of mom's depression and whatever else sis is niggling with, coupled with fresher and better belief systems because theirs are just shit.

&nbsp;

>I want to get them up and running. Full of faith again (faithful, wow). I know I can do it because they're my family and I know how to get to their heads. They'll never see it coming lol. I want to change them so much, really revamp their entire belief system. Before going back to my old self who isn't as encouraging of others and generally doesn't care if the world dies tomorrow or not as much as it'll be on show for the next month or so.

&nbsp;

>It's going to be my revenge for everything they did to me. Help them, then show them how stupid they were before going back to that self whom they thought a nobody and despised/didn't take into consideration and just laugh at them every time I leave the room for the toilet or for food like wtf I told was gonna happen you dumb fucks. I have no time for much. My mind is a mess now. I don't have time for positive because I don't believe in it. I'd rather have the truth over anything else and we all know what the truth really is.

copypasta,fpdl0m5,t3_gcv33x,1588529072.0,">Edit: thanks for the gold kinda stranger I didn’t expect this post to blow up! My life started growing up in a small farm in northern Kansas. My father was a farmer and my mother was a cashier in our local town down the dirt road. We didn’t have much and income was very little, my best toy I got growing up was a pig bladder blown up like a balloon that I could play around with between me and my two brothers. At the age of 11 things started getting tougher in my house life due to my fathers drinking problem as it was not a good harvest that year. Like his father before him once he was done working he would come home and drink but unlike his father he wouldn’t beat us unless we messed up, his father left him and his mother to fend for themselves after world war 2 though so he had it tougher than me growing up.

&nbsp;

>One time my father did drink too much and he hit my little brother Jamey. Jamey didn’t know what to do and ran away during the night during a storm. The entire family was out looking for him but we never saw Jamey again. This made my father drink more and lead him to take his life when I was at the age of 16. My older brother and me had to completely take over the farm with the help of our mom quitting her job as a cashier, life got very hard from here on out.

&nbsp;

>We got a break when I was 18 with a good harvest we were able to save up some money. I was able to move out at the age of 21 and into a larger city in Tennessee. It was hard leaving the family as my ma was getting older but my older brother completely took over the farm and even expanded it into a more profitable work. I began working in what I was good at, repairing mechanics. I was a hard worker and moved up in my chain of work easily within my town. I dated aroun’ a bit but never settled down with anyone I would write home about for my first few years.

&nbsp;

>When I was 26 I got a call from my ma, my brother was working with some machinery on the farm and got his hand caught in it and heavily damaged. I had to come home and help with the farm, at the time I had attained a high position as a senior mechanic within an auto shop and sometimes worked on the side with repairing electronics. I went home and had to help with the farm for a year, ma wasn’t doing good at all. She passed the next year due to kidney disease. My brother eventually recovered and I returned to Tennessee, I attempted to return to my position but due to the time I was out I had been long replaced.

&nbsp;

>I had to begin to work from the bottom again when I had a client come in, she was the most beautiful woman I ever seen in Tennessee with gorgeous brown hair. Nice to say that we hit it off pretty well, within a few weeks we were dating. I can say that she was one of the best things to have happened to me in my life. At the age of 30 I married her and my first child was on the way then. I had returned to my previous position and bought a nice house near the mountains of Tennessee. At the age of 34 my second child was born. My two kids are now both in high school, one a freshman, another a Senior.

&nbsp;

>I continued my career into more electronics working on computers and fixing them. In 2013 while googling how to fix a small problem with a motherboard I found a strange site named reddit.com, this website had all the answers I needed and a community always ready to help. I’ve been on the site ever since. As you can see recently, I commented on this thread and some kind stranger gave me gold. Thank you again kind stranger.

FamilyIssues,fpd53d4,t3_gcsj3x,1588520013.0,">My brother is 30 years old, no car, no diploma, no certifications, he pays no bills except for his phone. He’s been sleeping on my mother’s bedroom floor for many years now. He’s a coke head and he said he’s done heroin once but I think he’s tried it more than that. I have extreme anxiety around him, when I was 13 I even tried to kill myself once with Tylenol pills because he will argue with me about everything. I really can’t stand him. And idk what to do, but he’s been ruining my mental health since I was 13. My mom kicked him out but he came back after 2 months, she always takes his side and is against me. Even when he is wrong..

&nbsp;

>he screams, he yells, he’s only like 5’3 and is too scared to fight with men, he’s always trying to fight with me. I really do wish he was dead. Because he has got in my face and started yelling, over little things like a strand of my hair being on the floor. Or the dog pooping on the floor. One time I had to run to the cops and get him arrested because he hit me in the face with a towel and it left a blood clot in my cheek, thankfully that went away. He got me arrested twice for revenge just for defending myself, they took me in because they had marks on him. He went to anger management,he has calmed down a little.

&nbsp;

>But he still go back to his ways when upset, he will start yelling and slamming banging on walls or the door if I wake him up from his sleep just by talking. He is crazy, will act like the nicest person sometimes so I can forget who he is but when he is mad the true him comes back out. My mom lets him slide cause that’s her “son” and my mom is very toxic too. Constantly shaming me for being single, she didn’t teach me to cook and doesn’t want to, she doesn’t like to give a dollar. Yes she has bought things for me before but never without yelling and cursing me out first. I’m very depressed, and I know they’re also a part of the cause.

&nbsp;

>I know I have to move out but I can’t afford it yet. I’m 22, And I’m currently paying for my car bills. As of now that I’m here, I really don’t know what to do. I just really want my brother out of my life.

UnsentLetters,fpcx03a,t3_gcr5mq,1588514859.0,">I’ve never met you in real life, and yeah, things are complicated, especially on my end. But I feel like I have found my soul mate in you. I want to dance in the kitchen to Otis. I want to play your favorite song as I walk down the aisle to you. I wanna pet your head in my lap as we watch corny movies or laugh at the silliest things. I want to spend my life with you, but I know it isn’t possible right now. I want to see you smile at me, inches from my face, and kiss me with all the love I see in your eyes for me through the screen. I want to take care of you, cooking and snuggles, and just be there when you don’t want to talk, but you don’t want to feel alone.

&nbsp;

>To take road trips or sit on the couch and sing along to all our favorite songs, and find new favorites I didn’t know I would have. To feel your warmth beside me, listening to your snores, feeling safe and accepted. To feel your touch and the security in your hugs, holding me together when I feel like I’m falling apart. I want to show you, in person, the way you make me smile with your adorable silliness, and calm you after an angry rant with understanding and love. I just want to be that girl with the beaming light of “the one” you want to marry.

&nbsp;

>The one you finally take home to meet mom because I get you on that deeper level you need. I wish all these things were possible outside of my dreams. To watch the sunrise after a late night and before a lazy day in bed. You said “I wish you could see yourself through my eyes. Crawl around in my head and see how I see you”. I want to see myself reflected in your loving eyes when you tell me I’m beautiful. I want everything we have to be real. Graspable. Touchable. For now, I live with texts, video interaction, and dreams. I hope someday I can be strong enough to get myself to do what I have to, to get to you, so far away.

&nbsp;

>And I hope, sooo hope, it won’t be too late. You’d never ask me to give up what I have, and I would never ask that of you either. All I can do is hope....someday.

MyTheoryIs,fpcw81e,t3_gcr0xy,1588514326.0,">Choice is nothing more than mere illusion. Every aspect of who you are is done in your brain and out of your control. Down to your taste in music. When you hear a song you don’t decide to like it. It either sounds good or it doesn’t. Once you get past that you're kinda back at the point where you're wondering what life is. Maybe it would be a lot simpler if we could all just experience ego death but we're too fucking curious for that. Life is so confusing to some when really it’s fucking ridiculous. There’s two sides that I see valid that explain I guess life. The first being we’re just like every other species, we live, we die, that’s all. Only difference is we understand the concept of death, sorta.

&nbsp;

>We also revolve our entire lives around it. Personally, I’m just here to do what makes me happy until I die. I will spend the fewest amount of time possible doing something I don’t want to. There’s absolutely no reason to. I’d rather live a life where I’m happy, fucked up on various mind altering substances, and giving 0 fucks about the past and the future, where I die at 20, over living a long life with extra bullshit in between. It’s kinda like would you rather binge watch Ozark on Netflix with 0 ads or watch some bs cable show with a third of your time literally being sold to various corporations? Take note of the mind altering substance bit because that plays a lot into the second side of I guess what life is.

&nbsp;

>I think there’s a large chance these psychedelic drugs, especially dmt and shrooms, but not excluding acid, 2cb, etc. can be an answer to so many secrets in life. Isn’t it fascinating that dmt is produced in our brain? Dmt is either the key to another dimension or a hoax for all the people disappointed that this is it. I think maybe psychedelics are just a playground for people who figure life out to quickly. Like if you get to that stage of “we’re just another species that lives and dies except we’re also the victim of some fucked experiment called consciousness” as a teenager then you just kinda start to panic and look for something else to explore.

&nbsp;

>I do believe there’s a real possibility that dmt is some fucking “magic” bullshit that could lead us into another reality or maybe what we see on dmt is something thats always there and it’s just taking a layer off our vision, or maybe I just really dont want this to be all there is in life. (will be continued at later date) please share your takes on what you think about the concept of life, death, and overall the human mind (

BreakUps,fpcvdg8,t3_gcqu4a,1588513687.0,">I am sorry if this is a bit long but I am minutes away from going to find his ass until someone talks some sense into me! I am a (22/F) and my partner was a (23/M). We met around 2 years ago and instantly fell in love, moved in together basically within the first week of knowing each other (I never left his place), and eventually moved into another apartment together. The bond between us was so strong, like a Beatles love song I promise. I still swear we are soulmates. I gave him everything I had when he was struggling in life, (my car, free rent, countless rides, money, support, etc). He seemed appreciative of all of those things at the time, but never really reciprocated.

&nbsp;

>However, I did those things out of love not because I necessarily expected anything to that degree in return.  We got along so well, besides some reoccurring issues in our relationship that caused bickering and sometimes intense arguments. (This started 6 months into the relationship, when he started training intensely for his hobby). I was diagnosed with BPD before our relationship, and struggle with regulating negative emotions.  Now before you judge and stereotype me, I am not a heartless soul who uses people to fill my void, paint them black/etc, I am just intense emotionally. I will admit when I get angry I rage and say very mean terrible things I don't mean, or when I feel hurt I cry loudly which can irritate people who aren't equipped to handle it.

&nbsp;

>He always did things to upset me like not spending enough time with me (because of his intense hobby he trains for daily), not try to understand what upsets me or how I work, made broken promises of ""trying better next time"",  not communicating, etc. He seemed to pick his training/friend group over me. There was at times lack of affection, unless it was on HIS terms. A lot of the time, he was never able to be punctual for our plans or ignored my texts whenever I would start getting upset with him. Whenever I would get upset over something he did, he would invalidate my feelings and use excuses for his behavior.

&nbsp;

>He is very immature, unfortunately so I would try to tell myself that in order to move on from being upset about his behavior. I have waited on him for months, like a puppy at home, taking care of his laundry and our place because of his busy schedule. I am an introvert, and don't have many friends so I spent a bunch of time at the apartment. Despite all his crappy actions, he did show signs of happiness when we DID have time together and I know he loved me. Well just a week ago, there was a final argument about him coming home late from hanging with friends and not letting me know what time I should expect him home, which bothers me when I stay up waiting for him to come back to our place!

&nbsp;

>He said he could't handle my intense emotions, anger, or crying anymore. That my controlling behavior was too much for him, and it has to end. I understand I have been controlling, but I had told him simple things like ""if you could let me know when you plan on being back home, that would be great!"" and basically telling him what is pushing my buttons and how to diffuse the situation. Most times he would ignore his promises of trying to be better and continue to frustrate me. Personally if he were to just take my feelings into consideration, I feel my controlling behavior would've backed off and I would feel more at ease.

&nbsp;

>But he was terrible at communication which sketched me out a lot, even if there was nothing to be sketched out about! Anyways, he kicks me out of our apartment, cancels the new lease we were about to sign, and I move everything I could fit in my car. I am a wreck, and I text him over the next few days and get minimal responses, that he needs space. So I calm down, however my furniture is still in the place! I text him to let him know I plan on moving into the new place regardless if he is coming or not, since I am now homeless. He replies with anger and blocks me on EVERYTHING despite him saying he'd never do that.

&nbsp;

>I am confused?  I have reached out to him on texting apps, my friends, etc nothing. He only will reply to my mom if it is about arranging to pick up furniture. I do not understand how someone you lived with for two years could just delete you from their life like that. I can't help but feel used, disposed of, and like our entire relationship was a lie. I know by his actions as I described, I should've left his ass long ago, which I thought about but I felt if we tried to work on our problems things would get to a better place....however they didn't. I am an emotional crisis, willing to risk stalking him or showing up at our old apartment just to try to get face to face interaction.

&nbsp;

>I feel like I was stuffed into a jar with the lid closed. I have so many more things to talk to him about, however he doesn't want to hear it. I have no idea what is going on with him but it hurts, he was my best friend, we went through a bunch in just 2 years. I am not looking to beg for him back, just end on better terms. He had mentioned before all the blocking if we spent time separately and worked on our selves, we could maybe be friends. Seems like this is out the window now. If anyone could share advice, my parents are afraid I will get myself arrested if I go over there and harass him to talk to me.

&nbsp;

>I just can't let go.

Advice,fpcv88h,t3_gcqtaq,1588513557.0,">Ok this I have been in this friend group for over a year. It has 3 core people me and 2 others. Over the year and half we have had many waves of people come in and out of the friend group. The out part isn't by choice most of the time. There is someone in the friend group let's call him NK. NK is normal the owner of the discord servers we hang out in. There was a point where I owned the discord server we hung out in and it happened to be our most popular one but NK got upset that the server wasnt 18 plus so we left that server and made a new one he was owner of. While I was owner of the sever I will call IC he would almost refuse to mention I was the owner of IC he would always say all of the admins are equal when it comes to the server but then when he owned the server we call SDT he would always have final say and whenever anyone did something he didnt like he would mention he was the owner and he could ban them if he wanted to.

>In the times of ALL of our servers I did the advertising I set up the bots for these and everything aswell. SDT fell becuase he had a ex that was stalking him going discord server to discord server. So then i made a server called BK while all of this was going down but NK didnt want to go the new server because he said it will splinter the friend group so basically I set up and entire discord server in a night so we could be left alone by his ex girlfriend and he didnt want to go but then I offered to transfer ownership of BK to him and then he wanted to go BK.

&nbsp;

>Now fast forward to today. BK is basically dead the only people who talk in it are people who are close friends and were around in past servers because if anyone got on NK nerves he would ban them and then complain to me that my advertising wasnt working. So I decided to make another server where I was owner so that way it had room to grow and I could easily mange it without NK telling I couldn't do something to his server that I set up and manage the bots and advertise for.

&nbsp;

>So I made this server called M1 and when I invited and gave him admin right away and told him it was a public server he got really upset asking why I'm not advertising BK I told him that he told me he wanted to fix up BK before we started advertising and it's been a month and no progress was made so I made my own server. He then told me that people have lives outside of discord and just because I have a lot of free time doesnt mean everyone does.

&nbsp;

>But I'm looking at his steam profile right now and he has 30 hours in gta 5 in the past 2 weeks. It doesn't take that long to set up a server. I have lost so many friendships to NK just banning people because he didnt like what they said. There are storys I left out here I just told you all of 2020 I didnt even tell you 2019 or 2018. Or the time he tried to out depression someone who was suicidal in public chat of his server because people werent responding to him.

dating,fpctpw0,t3_gcqk29,1588512427.0,">I am a 21 year old male and she was a 19 year old female. Okay so I’m going to try to summarize this as best as I can. So it all started off when this girl and I matched on Hinge. We hit things off really well. I had never really found someone I had clicked with as well as I clicked with her. She eventually gives me her number so we start texting and FaceTimeing all the time. I’m the beginning I wasn’t completely sure what I wanted with her but all I knew was I enjoyed her mind & company. Eventually though one night when we get off FaceTime she texts me “I love you” & at first I didn’t know what to think.

&nbsp;

>I thought it was a little to soon because we had only been talking for a week at this point but I didn’t necessarily not feel it so I said it back. Which I realize was a mistake now. Eventually we plan out a day to chill (she lives 2 hours from me so I drove to her) & we ended up having what I thought was an amazing time. We did some sexual shit but at the same time we balanced it out with cute shit. Eventually while we’re hanging out she comes right out and asks me “So are you my boyfriend now?” & I was honestly taken back a little bit by this because I had never had girl straight up pursue me and tell me exactly what she wanted essentially.

&nbsp;

>So I took this as a sign that she knew what she wanted and that it was obviously me. So I said back to her “I am if you’re my girlfriend now” so this becomes my first official relationship since I was 15 (I’ve messed around with a whole bunch of different girls since then but never felt like my feelings were strong enough to officially date them) So now that we’re official we start getting a little deeper with each other when it comes to our pasts, dreams and hopes for the future. She talks about how she “wants to marry to me” and all this and that which I just kinda brushed off.

&nbsp;

>Trust me I was not going to rush into any marriage. So like I said we got deeper with each other & I eventually told her about how my mom had passed away a couple months back which she was very comforting to me when I told her. But she was saying things like “Maybe your moms spirt brought us together” etc. she was just saying stuff to me that was really making me feel a certain way towards her & I don’t take statements like that lightly& on top of that she would always talk about how we were soulmates and everything. But then comes the day about a month into the relationship that changes everything. We’re texting after we had FaceTimed a little early the day & everything is just fine.

&nbsp;

>But then out of no where she hits me with all these long ass texts about how essentially “She’s not ready for commitment but she still wants to be friends with me. She just didn’t want any labels” but the weird thing is, is even though she didn’t want any labels she still wanted to say I love you. & I was just shook. I couldn’t wrap my head around how everything could just be fine one sec and then the next it came to this. Even though I wasn’t necessarily happy with what she wanted, I was open to trying it out because I did love her and care about her.

&nbsp;

>We had been planning to hangout for the next day after all this had went down for a little while so her and I both talked about how we were still going to hangout to see how things went as we both wanted to remain in each other’s lives. But then a couple hours after we plan out everything she texts me saying “Maybe you shouldn’t come tomorrow, I have a funny feelings about it” & this just kinda irritated me honestly. So I just said to her essentially “If you don’t even wanna hangout with me, what’s the point of this then? If you don’t know what you want, then I’ll make it easy for you. We’re just done okay?” & I decided to put the last stake in the coffin.

&nbsp;

>I just can’t help but to think, did I mess up? I was down to see where this “friendship” thing went but after she switched up on me again & didn’t wanna chill that just kinda pushed me over the edge. In my mind it just seems like if she really cared about me then she would’ve wanted to chill especially after everything that had went down earlier that day. So what do y’all think? I’m just so confused because she was the one that was pursuing me. Did I dodge just being kept on a string or did I pull the trigger to fast? Thank y’all & im sorry for the mess of the post.

FamilyIssues,fpco4q1,t3_gcphpa,1588507645.0,">When I moved to stay with my mum she had a partner (not with him anymore) I was always told I had to dress proper that meant no skirts vests and with dresses and stuff she would always pick them out. (Long ugly dresses) she would pick out my clothes to go out as well. (This happened until I was 17/18) I think the accusations all stemmed from my step dad he used to be the one to make comments on how I dressed and how it didn’t look right but at the same breath he thought of slapping my butt as a term of endearment. (She always saw him do so) anyway. She always used to (still does) warn me about how it’s my responsibility to limit the possibility of a man touching me it’s all about how I dress and how I talk to them and how I sit etc.

&nbsp;

>The real problem started when I started baby sitting for my auntie and when we started having BBQ’s. I remember the first time so well she called me into her room and accused me of fucking my auntie’s husband the reason? My clothing style had changed. I started feeling so uncomfortable around him when I babysat I’d leave before he came (my auntie always came home early) and I saw how hesitant he became to talk to me too so I think my auntie or mum asked him the same thing we barely speak now. When we go to BBQ’s she’d always talk about make sure no one touches you this way make sure you’re covered up and she accused me of sleeping with some of the other men who’d come to the BBQ’s.

&nbsp;

>Me not having a dad already affected me as I don’t know how a father’s touch is like so now when my ‘uncles’ try touch me I always freeze up doesn’t matter if it’s just a pat on the shoulder or a hug I always try get away from them as quickly as possible because it just makes me so uncomfortable. I just wanted to let this out sorry if it doesn’t make much sense but it was so hard to break this down as so many things happened but yeah.

&nbsp;

>I’ve now moved out but whenever I come down to visit I spend a good amount of time trying to find the right outfit her new partner doesn’t seem bad but I still don’t like being in a room alone with him or any of my uncles really. Thanks for reading

REDDITORSINRECOVERY,fpckdwe,t3_gcoqu6,1588503826.0,">Personally, i wanna say, you will always be stronger that those drugs!. I took Ecstasy and Tramadol/any Painkillers , for the last 3.5 years I’ve been taking pills non-stop. Smoking made it worse in the long run, it’s funny they tell us don’t do drugs but never get into which ones and how they look. At 15 I realized I had Depersonalization (Mental illness) but ignored it and kept doing drugs. All sophomore year I was drugged out , skipping school or not going at all. I ended up missing many days of school which lead me to going to court during the summer . During this phase I came to the realization that it was drugs keeping me away from %100 great mental health again.

&nbsp;

>I was scared to smoke in fear of jail time so I quit, but pills? They stayed until 4 days before my court date. I had the worst withdrawals in my life that summer and it sucks. My last court date comes and I go, finish what I was told to do and I get dropped off home. I’m now in my room in a empty house because my family left (work) . I grabbed a bag of weed and rolled it up and after the first hit, my sense and grip of reality left. DP set in and I realized what caused the problem for my mental health. I threw that shit away but I still took pills, weed withdrawal isn’t something I cared about because the pill withdrawal hurt.

&nbsp;

>I’m 16, going through terrible withdrawals hurting this where I went down a dark abyss. I was in drama/bs in school, povert at home, and a addict going through DP everyday. The only highlight of getting up in the morning, are the few seconds before I open my eyes and realize my problems and struggles. It’s a small moment of bliss it’s the closet I felt to being happy, oblivious to my problems or my own self harm before reality sets in. Pills pushed me backwards I wanted to quit but I needed them to get out of bed , speak, be productive, shower, leave my room, if it was anything physical if I wasn’t high I didn’t wanna do it.

&nbsp;

>I was fucked up and ignored it because it’s how I coped. I would cry when it got bad on my knees balled up in the bathroom wanting to be free but the withdrawals hurt. I wanted to kill myself at one point thinking it’s no way out For me, this is life and for a year and 7 months it was until it got so bad I had to quit smoking and doing drugs or it was like nothing was real (DP). I was tired of crying, hurting my self, hurting my mental health , pretending to be fine, so I stopped for 2 months and hit some weed again, cool temptation will get u if your not strong.

&nbsp;

>Finally on December, 27 2018 I smoked for the very last time I told myself I’m done and as of now , 16 months and 24 Days of no smoking. I still was popping pills I couldn’t handle withdrawals at work/school. I worked as a dishwasher, 17 new to it all. I had to be on drugs to work or I’d be sluggish barely working. I was ashamed of it but I brushed it off like I always do because I hate being social about myself . Depersonalization got worse during my pill taking, I couldn’t do anything without them like I’ve mentioned but it got worse because I finally had money of my own to buy drugs. I used to steal and burglarize for money .

&nbsp;

>Everyday to go home to a terrible home where I slept on the floor , no pillow , covers , nothing but couch cushions that were too small. I’m really crying I used to cry about not having nothing to my name. My father died and we went into poverty. Tears are coming out of me because he was the reason why Im like this now I lost him before I graduated 8th grade . I wish He could see me, see what I’ve done, see my first girlfriend, my first conflict at school, my first job , my first fight , I was too young to understand how much he had done for me, I’m too late to let him know now.

&nbsp;

>After that I’ve done so much and it hurts my dad can’t see me become a man on May 27 . I wish I could show him who he raised, walk across the stage , go to college, he left and I got into the street’s as of June of 2016. I can finally say it’s over dad, Im out the streets dad no more stealing pops , no more drugs , Ive been hurt for so long And it’s finally over. I’m sober as of May 3rd 2020. I quit April 1st last month due to Covid-19 and no job I couldn’t support my habit and that’s the best thing I got out of it. I don’t feel like I need to be high during work anymore, to socialize, talk to my family, friends, to love , to care, anything I’m finally starting to feel better, no withdrawals/ losing weight (I’m 97Ibs) /I drink more water and exercise at home.

&nbsp;

>I naturally feel great without drugs and I love it. I don’t need pills Anymore dad your son made it out his situation. I’m going to his old house to take pictures and pay tribute at your grave pops. I love you dawg, something I never told you dad . I love you ❤️

Advice,fpchj5r,t3_gco88e,1588500900.0,">I recently moved to a city to complete some modules for university. It was only meant to be 3 months and then COVID 19 and lockdown began. One of my best friends from childhood provided me with a room for the duration at minimum rent. We have not really seen each other for 6 years since I left to work in other countries. At first it was good, we had chats and laughs like the good old times but then it got worse. Everything becomes a little arguement, even when she is blatantly wrong. This is the case before C19 but she became worse lately. She will never say she doesn't know (we fell out for a year when we were 16 because of this).

&nbsp;

>It was far worse then. I think it's a combination of an inferiority complex and too much pride but I'm not a psychologist. She always seems to know everything and it becomes really hard to just have a normal conversation. Its really hard to share information without her saying ""yeah, I know"". Her boyfriend gets the brunt of this. He has the patient of a saint. She doesn't really do much with her life, sits on the couch, does the minimum to get by and then complains how crap the world is. Starts drinking as soon the bf returns from work (doesn't get fully drunk,  perhaps tipsy) Shes cycnical of quite a lot of things but I used to be like that so I let it go.

&nbsp;

>Last the night the 3 of us played poker and she was arguing about every fucking rule to her bf. I think she has some symptoms of depression  but I've not really encountered a depressed person before. I'm trying my best to be with her but it gets me in a really foul mood. I go for a run, do something productive to feel good and then go down to the living room to a depressing  and toxic atmosphere. I want to go home and live with my mum but I dont want to transfer anything. Her bf is a truck driver working on the frontline so I can never be sure that I'm not infected. I'm really resenting her.

&nbsp;

>Her lack of drive and then being cycnical of the world is really getting to me. What should I do?

relationship_advice,fpch7o5,t3_gco4z8,1588500544.0,">I met her a couple of months ago and we just sorta worked. Generally she's always been closed off and doesn't like telling people her things but she never had this problem with me. She seems to easily tell me about her struggles. Very early on she confided in me that she had attempted to take her life. She was in a relationship during this time. She would tell me how her relationship would be doing. She would just rant. I would just listen for the most part and give her some general advice. Nothing drastic. Later on I developed feelings but didn't say anything for a while. Eventually I let her know how I felt. She admitted she felt similar but was ""committed"". I tried my best to remain neutral but slowly realized she was in an abusive relationship.

&nbsp;

>She was not a fan of sex and would often cry (often from pain). Her then boyfriend would continue as if nothing was wrong. He would often disregard her emotional distress. She finally broke things off with the guy and we waited a month before we gave it a shot. We've worked through a lot of things together. And I feel like I've been helping her as much as I feasibly could. She suffers from severe anxiety and very often avoids conflict no matter the cost. I've attempted to communicate to her how important it is to reach out to people and not be afraid to talk. To communicate.

&nbsp;

>And to be more firm about what she truly wants. With the pandemic going on she started to feel distant. As we would only talk and text. And I would notice something bothering her but she would not tell me. I asked her how she felt about me and she said she just felt numb about a lot of things. I decided maybe not having to worry about someone in a relationship would help. So I explained my logic with her and ended things. She says she feels guilty about all the trouble she's given me and her prior boyfriend. And she really beats herself up about it. She doesn't love herself and it hurts to see her beating herself up like she does. I want to help.

&nbsp;

>But sometimes I feel like I do more damage then good. I feel like if I removed myself completely from the equation, since we still talk , would help her out. Or maybe I should stick around and help her through it. The issue being we don't know how not to be intimate. Eventually it'll cross the line again into more then just friends. And I think she needs stability in her life. I genuinely don't know how best to help her.

LittleFiresEverywhere,fpc8u46,t3_gcmnu1,1588491581.0,">I just finished the watching the series and these are my thoughts about the custody battle. A little empathy goes a long way. If Linda was empathetic and considered where Bebe was coming from, Instead of feeling Superior and judging her for her choice, things would have happened very differently. There is absolutely no reason why the baby should have been kept from her birth mother. As long as Bebe is alive, in a better place mentally, can care for her daughter adequately, (fifty toys does not make a child happy) not a danger to her daughter ,was actively searching for her daughter to be reunited with her and had not formally signed away her rights to her child she deserves to have her child back with her.

&nbsp;

>The simplest solution was for Linda and her husband to give the baby back to her mother and respectfully request to still be a part of the babys life. If they truly cared about the child and cared about helping others,that would have been a great opportunity to help Bebe. Instead of throwing money at her to buy her child, they should have used that money to help her live a more comfortable life. They could have helped her to get a better job knowing that all this will also be great for her child who they have come to love. They could then adopt another truly orphaned child of their own. It's very simple. It is ridiculous to me that she kept repeating that she nursed the baby for almost a year.

&nbsp;

>Bebe carried that baby for nine months and had no choice but to give her up for a while because she loved her. Would Linda have preferred the baby to starve to death?! A truly unselfish good person would have been grateful and happy to have saved that baby's life but will never dream of withholding her from her birth mother. Also Linda and are husband are not thinking of the child and the trauma it will cause her when she grows up knowing that they kept her from her birth mother who was fighting to get her back. If she grew up with them and found our the truth, there is a probability that she would hate Linda and her husband for what happened.

&nbsp;

>They didn't consider the child's feelings.  A child does not have to live with you or call you Mother for you to love them and truly care for them. If Linda or her friend Elena knew this they would not have acted the way they did. There was no need to go to court. So many things in life can be resolved amicably if we only showed more empathy towards each other.

copypasta,fpc85oa,t3_gcmjbr,1588490887.0,">cummy, with your consent, i will bare your children. i don’t want to be hard on you. it’s okay if you are not erect on our first try. i may feel a little dry down, i don’t judge. we can do this together. and, within a few months, hopefully, i will be with child. when we go to my first ultrasound, you will be shocked that we’re having twins. twins run in my family. my mother and father were twins. huh? no silly, they didn’t have a twin sister or brother, they were biological twins. my grandparents were twins also, not biological of course as my grandfather is a black man and my grandmother is a white woman. after nine months of preparing for the day to come, my water will break, and you will rush me to the hospital.

&nbsp;

>i will be 15 hours in labor until our first child, cummy jr., arrives. our second child, cummy jr. II, will arrive a few minutes afterwards. they’re perfectly healthy and happy. i am quite hungry after conceiving, and you suggest i rest. you head to the cafeteria to fetch me some snacks, and while there, a scandalous looking man approaches you. he yells at you, and asks you various questions. he assaults you and leaves you bloody and beaten on the cafeteria floor and flees before anyone can catch him. kind people assist you, checking if you are okay. you’re not okay. you have 3 broken ribs, a broken right arm, and temporary memory loss.

&nbsp;

>you recover over the next few months as i nurse the twins alone. when you regain your memory, i cry. i am overjoyed and thrilled that my husband has regained his memory. we celebrate and you officially meet your children. later that night, we are watching the evening news. a criminal that has been on the loose for a while has targeted a local corner store, killing 1 worker and injuring 3 customers. as he heads out of the corner store, he looks at the camera located on the wall, observing his every move, his face, his actions. he stops and pulls a paper from his pocket and unfolds it. there are letters written on the paper. ‘i’m coming for you cummy.

&nbsp;

>-joe.’ i look to you sitting beside me, mouth wide open. the words pour out of my mouth like cool water, “c-cummy, who’s joe?”

Vent,fpbzrv3,t3_gcl5ja,1588483171.0,">I moved out of my mom's place because she was so controlling and would yell at me whenever I'd go out. I'm 21. So I moved in with my aunt and she's crazy religious and forces me to pray especially with this whole virus shit going on. But every single time she forces me to pray for dinner she does this shit eating smirk like she's laughing at me with the whole ""haha it's your turn to pray"" even though it doesn't bother me because I don't really care I just want to get it over with and she acts like it's so funny that it's my turn. Well when I finish praying we all say amen but she doesn't. She's like ""and please bless so and so and bless this and that"" right after I'm done like if my prayer wasn't good enough.

&nbsp;

>What's the fucking point of forcing me to pray if you're just going to take over right after???? It's so frustrating because she does this every single time I'm forced to pray. On top of that she takes 2 bites of her food and starts complaining and making sure everyone knows that's she's full at least a hundred times. Like ok we get it you're not trying to eat too much. But she keeps going and going and going ""oh I'm so full why did I eat I'm so full"" and my uncle sometimes has to tell her to STFU because she barely even ate a thing.

&nbsp;

>She had her stomach stapled 5 YEARS AGO there's no reason why she has to keep up this front like she can't fit more than a few bites in her fat fucking body. Oh and that doesn't stop her from eating she'll finish her food and then some and still complain how full she is. And whenever I go to work she has to ask me a million questions ""where are you going did you eat what time will you be back where is the job at is your brother going too who's picking you up"" and it's always the same exact response from me. ""I DONT KNOW"" because I do inventory I go to work at different places in different cities and I only have a start time, the end time is up to how fast or slow we finish and she knows this.

&nbsp;

>Obviously my brother is going too because he's my only ride to work. And she forces me to eat breakfast lunch and dinner with her and my uncle every single day so yes I did eat and she knows that too. Then she comes into my room to ""clean"" which really means going through my shit to ""organize"" but she only ever does this whenever I'm on the phone and she makes it painfully obvious she's listening to my conversations. And whenever she asks me if I want soda(which I don't want because I hate soda and of course she knows that too) I say no, and it's followed by a million other questions that are all met with no no no no no.

&nbsp;

>""do you want soda?"" No ""do you want water?"" No ""milk?"" No ""juice?"" No ""chips?"" No ""beer?"" No ""wine?"" No ""sparkling water?"" No etc. And keep in mind that I am very polite and put up with it even though I have to deal with it every single day. It's so overbearing and I'm constantly being asked ""you're not going to leave us right?"" Because her and my uncle can't do shit on their own. They can't copy and paste on their phone. They can't order shit online, they don't know how to use Netflix when all you have to do is press play, hey don't know how to do pretty much anything that requires technology.

&nbsp;

>I've had to make my aunt and uncle at least 8 different emails because they don't keep track of any of them and expect me to remember each one with their complicated ass passwords that I tell them to write down. Half the time I explain something to my aunt she just stares at me blankly until I do it for her. That's not even the worst part about living here. My uncle is always barging into my room whenever I'm watching something or playing something just to talk about pointless shit and repeats himself over and over and over again until my aunt has to come get him or else he doesn't leave.

&nbsp;

>I honestly think he's going senile. He's always trying to get into the bathroom when I'm inside of it even when he watches me go in. He keeps a camera in my room that watches me which I have to unplug whenever I come back inside my room because it makes me uncomfortable especially when I need to change. He swears it's a wifi emitter but it's clearly a camera. I looked it up. Whenever I leave the room for more than a second he comes in and plugs it back in or uncovers it. Whenever he uses the restroom he leaves the door open, doesn't flush, nor wipe. Whenever literally anything about careers comes up he swears he's done it.

&nbsp;

>Doctor, military, cook, vet, pilot, construction worker, actor, inventory specialist, pastor, farmer, mechanic, electrician, etc pretty much anything you can think of. He's ""done"" it. The reality of it is he worked at Vons his entire life after getting out of jail for molesting his sons friend. He never did anything but work at Vons. I try to talk about this with my best friend but she just blows me off like my problems don't matter at all. But she'll talk my ear off about her problems and I'll be the best friend I can be but the second I try to talk about my problems she acts like a devil's advocate and calls me immature and says I should be more appreciative when she complains about pretty much the same shit.

&nbsp;

>I pay rent. I carry all the groceries from the car. I take out the trash. I clean everything. I'm the only person in this apartment with a job so most of the bills land on my lap but there's no escape. Whenever I try to leave I get sprayed down from head to toe with lysol and have to take a bag of chips and soda and a sandwich and napkins with me even if I'm just going out for a walk. Don't get me wrong I appreciate it but I'm an adult and I only moved here because I had no where else to go and was only going to stay for a month till I could move to San Diego with my friend and get a place together but now I'm stuck having to take care of old people who are crazy and religious nuts and have to hear about how the world is coming to an end constantly.

&nbsp;

>I didn't sign up for this. I want out. I'm so fucking depressed and suicidal and angry all the time now. I resorted to drinking heavily and started smoking cigarettes again after quitting for 6 months. The stress is too much and I can't take it anymore. I've thought about ending my life more times than I've ever had before and I sleep away my free days because I can't bare it anymore. I hope I find an escape from this purgatory.

stupidpol,fpbz3do,t3_gcl19u,1588482605.0,">I once saw an interview by a very prominent anti-pro-black black called Taleeb Starkes who said that ""Black people have to work twice as hard as whites, but not because whites hold blacks back. It is because a bunch of the bad blacks ruined it for the majority"" or something along those and I think that's pretty poignant point about how even in anti-racist societies, stigmas are never fully shed. I come from a non-American ethnic group that also has a lot of baggage attached to it and I have experienced many instances of racism where people project their anxieties onto me. Seeing people do that to you can feel extremely threatening and makes you feel like you are hated by the world at large, which is a much harder experience for minority populations than majority populations.

&nbsp;

>Both culture war factions have a very retarded and prejudiced view of Blacks as either pure victims hurt by European beauty standards/genocide/segregation/slavery/etc or as unthinking pathological criminal beasts who cannot be trusted by whites. Race and IQ is pretty much completely mainstream in the Anglo-American right now and people who question it are censored and ridiculed by the right wing twitterati and youtube comment mobs far more often than people who believe in it. Right wingers are generally civil, but they push their ""it's not racist to notice differences"" shtick pretty far and defend malicious stereotyping and prejudice as mere ""pattern noticing"" extremely often, especially in the case of Blacks, Muslims, and other dangerous groups.

&nbsp;

>Their blank slatism isn't that blank in my observation since they tend to be completely unwilling to apply even the most basic blank slatism standard, which is to assume that people are not a certain way just because their ethnic group is more likely to be that way. I'm no SJW, but I would not want to be a member of such a highly stigmatized and over-politicized group within a society as Blacks in America. I feel sorry for Black people who feel the need to become white haters because they are taught that whites are out to get them and are constantly exposed to examples of whites who are genuinely out to get them. It is almost like a form of child abuse the way some black children are raised with a hyper-consciousness of white racism.

&nbsp;

>I recognize a lot of these tendencies in my own ethnic group and see that they are a product of fear rather than malice.

AskDocs,fpbwceh,t3_gckm7l,1588480446.0,">I (22f) have a really hard time eating. I’m about 115, 5’9. I socially drink but never more than a glass of wine a night. I hardly use recreational drugs and I take no medications. The pain from being hungry gets so bad to the point I’ll start shaking, dry heaving and on the ground crying from the pain of being so hungry but I can not eat. I’ll feel my stomach growl, understand I’m hungry and just not be able to eat. And when I do finally force myself to eat it’s like everything in my body is trying to stop the food from going down. I’d say it’s the feeling comparable to eating too much and you’re chewing that one last bite. My body is screaming no, it’s difficult to chew, difficult to swallow.

&nbsp;

>Sometimes it gets so hard I have to just spit the food out, my body fights it so much. There are also certain foods I used to be able to eat and I loved and for the past 3 years eating a bite sends me into a violent sickness almost immediately. The only thing that helps me eat is marijuana though I don’t smoke everyday, maybe once a month. But that’s the only time I notice I can eat without pain or forcing myself to. I also can’t stomach many liquids or I wouldn’t really care too much about not being able to eat. When I saw my dr about this she said I wasn’t losing enough weight (more on that) so I should try meal replacement smoothies.

&nbsp;

>I tried it, they made me sick. Where most people can drink half a water bottle, I can drink maybe 1/4 before I start throwing up. I’ve gone to a therapist, I’ve tried exercising more, cutting out meats and dairies, only eating organic, yoga,vitamins, and supplements, I’ve tried going to the doctor, I told her about this issue while I was pregnant and hadn’t seen her since about 3 years prior. So of course my weight was going up I had an appetite but before my child was born and after she was born the exact same symptoms. When I was pregnant, I could eat for the most part.

&nbsp;

>After my daughter I did okay for about 3 months then I couldn’t eat anymore. I’ve tried returning to the dr and she just keeps telling me “oh I wish I had that problem” and making light of it and not taking me seriously. I’m tired of feeling sick and drained and it cuts into every part of my life, passing out at work and unable to enjoy family time. Any advice would be amazing!

thegreatproject,fpbtla6,t3_gck5ft,1588478386.0,">I grew up in a non-denominational church (a mega church called Springs in Canada). So starting from as young as I can remember I grew up learning about God and being told that this is how I should live my life no questions asked. In all honesty I was very happy with my life the way it was, knowing for certain what I could and couldn’t do. I don’t know what age I started questioning everything( I’m thinking early teens) but I do remember my parents always having answers to my questions in the form of bible verses. Which only ever told me that I had to follow the “rules” set in some thick small print hard cover book that I could never throw out.

&nbsp;

>I remember becoming friends with a girl from youth, we would always sneak away together and chill in the back of the amphitheatre where it was dark and no one could find us. At first it was just us talking, but I remember at one point we started to talk about exploring each other’s bodies just to see what it was like, and if we liked it or not. Unfortunately my parents found out and stopped us from seeing each other, telling me she wasn’t a good person to hang around and that she was exposing me to bad stuff. I knew that my parents would frown greatly on what I was doing but I honestly didn’t care I felt I was old enough to explore even though it was against my religion.

&nbsp;

>This was a turning point in my life I started googling things to understand them more, reading porn, and then watching it. I read my mother’s nursing books that explained anatomy of male and female and how things worked together. My parents found out about the porn and took me to church one day and had a literal group of people pray over me, which was embarrassing, and demoralizing. This was also when I started losing faith wondering why everything was wrong all I wanted to do was ask questions and get answers. I also lost trust in my parents who were pushing faith down my throat telling me to read the bible more and pray more I hid a lot of things from them, lying to them, even ended up buying my own dildo which my mom made me throw out because it was a sin..

&nbsp;

>When I was 21 I got married to my boyfriend of 5 years, yes we meet in church. We both genuinely thought that he was the head of the household and therefore always had the last say this was in accordance with the bible. A year and a half into our marriage we got a divorce, I had a restraining order against him because of all the things he had done to me, physically, mentally and emotionally. My case was one of the worst ones that my therapist had ever seen in my province.

&nbsp;

>The only reason my family was ok with me getting a divorce was because he physically abused me. If it had been because we just didn’t click or he was emotionally controlling then I would have been told by the church and my family to go to marriage counselling. I could never understand how god told us to be equally yoked and yet the church basically disowns anyone who gets a divorce because it’s wrong!! During the separation and divorce I moved back in with my parents. At this point I wondered where god had gone, why he had let all these bad things happen to me in my life. If he was a good god why didn’t he stop anything. Everything that happened with my ex-husband made me question Christianity and why they teach what they do and tell us to believe what they say.

&nbsp;

>I had never felt right being a “Christian” but because I grew up as a people pleaser I just followed blindly never really questioning because I didn’t want to rock the boat , or make anyone mad at me for fear they would stop being my friends. I ended up going the opposite of the spectrum and doing everything that was viewed as wrong in the Christian faith. Sleeping around, staying out late, and even though I was 23 because I was living with my parents they expected me home at a certain time. I couldn’t stay out anywhere without letting them know, it couldn’t be with a guy because it was ungodly.

&nbsp;

>It was like I was a teenager all over again. At some point I decided to download an app on my phone that allowed me to connect with kinky people and I found a married couple that I decided to explore with. This was a great eye opener they were Pagan and I enjoyed not only the sexual aspect but the intellectual aspect of my relationship with them. My eyes really started opening after I meet them, I began to see the world and explore it and question things. Learning for myself about myself. Throughout this journey of life I had always just said to my parents that yes I believed in god I just hadn’t found the right church to go back in, the one that I felt at home in.

&nbsp;

>then in late 2015 I met my now boyfriend, we have been together for almost 5 years. He has stood alongside me supporting me while I go thru this journey of making a new life for myself listened to me while I question what I believed and has helped me rewire parts of my brain so that some of those “Christian” beliefs aren’t there anymore. It wasn’t until I meet him that I had the courage to say out loud that I had de-converted from Christianity many years ago. He gave me the support I needed to have courage to tell my family that I’m not a Christian and that I will never believe in god or jesus the way that they do.

&nbsp;

>Unfortunately my family still thinks that I believe in god somehow and that one day I will come back. I know they will keep praying this regardless of what I say or do. I’ve shed many tears thinking about how close minded they are. The box they call their world won’t even let in any thoughts of the possibility that people of different faiths and religions are ok. To this day I am still working at rewiring my brain to be ok with not relying on a “higher” power that will make everything ok if I just ask it to. I know that I’m the only one who has power over my life, my destiny.

&nbsp;

>And if I choose to start believing in something else that’s ok. Because there is nothing that’s right or wrong in this world to believe in. it’s how we use that belief be it for good or bad.

LifeAdvice,fpbtab8,t3_gck4cu,1588478164.0,">I’m 27 years old (M) , & for as long as I can remember I’ve always had trouble keeping friends in my life. Same goes for relationships. I’ve never had a girlfriend, & never had a friendship last more than a few months. It just seems like people always find a way to exit my life. I just hate meeting someone I like only for them to leave without any explanation. My whole life I’ve been shy with girls until last year. Last May I created an online dating profile & I met up with a total of 4 girls. The 1st girl I really liked and she said she liked me. We talked everyday for 3 weeks & went on 4 dates. We were supposed to go on a 5th date, but she gave me the lamest excuse.

&nbsp;

>Later on she told me she was going through stuff and wanted to be alone. A week after not hearing from her, I texted her and she gave me the “It’s not you, it’s me” & never heard from her again. The 2nd girl I met up with was pretty interesting. She said she lived in my hometown around the same time I was still living there, which is a big coincidence because I live 2200 miles away from my hometown, so meeting someone who said she lived there is very interesting. We hung out 5 times. The 1st time we met at the movies, & I guess it went okay.

&nbsp;

>Sometimes she would stop talking to me, but then she would message me again. Last time I heard from her was a month ago after I reactivated my IG account after 2 months of having it deactivated. We talked for 2 days, then she stopped again ... my point is that every person I meet always stops talking to me! I don’t know why. I even made an IG account to post my car and all the upgrades I do to it in hopes of making friends with the same interests as me, but I haven’t made a single friend. Tbh I hate my life, I’m so lonely & my days off from work are so depressing. Every day I feel like purchasing a gun and shooting myself in the head with it.

&nbsp;

>I have so much anger at life that I end up taking it out on others. I have so much anger that my face literally mutated and now I look angry 24/7 . I feel like there’s no hope for me and I’m just gonna have to deal with every wave of depression that life throws at me.

relationship_advice,fpbrm73,t3_gcju87,1588476984.0,">So, for starters, I'm currently in a long distance relationship and have been for 3 months now, and all this time I obviously wasn't telling my mother, however, recently during yet another argument with her she ended up finding out about my sh scars, which I never wanted her to know of (she is possibly the main cause of my harming problem) which then followed up with a long conversation about my mental health, where I ended up lying (more like masking the truth) about my so called female ""friend"" whom I met on social media and have been talking to for around 2 months, and how she really helped me and explained to me what the root of a lot of my problems is and how I can try to deal with them before getting proper treatment (which I have been denied by my mother multiple times) and for anyone who might be wondering, no , I can't tell her that its actually my boyfriend we're talking about here, and not because she won't accept it, maybe mostly because the woman gives me zero to no privacy and right to my own personal time/space, and gets extremely mad and defensive when I ask her to leave me alone or let me have my room to myself, and in that case she wouldn't change her behavior even if I told her I have a boyfriend who I'm trying to spend time with.

&nbsp;

>Going forward to yesterday (and technically today too) in the middle of a COMPLETELY UNRELATED ARGUMENT, she let her overly narcissistic side take over, called me a bitch because I spend ""more"" time with this ""friend"" of mine than her, and for obvious reasons because shes clearly a stuck up bitch, and today when I was trying to watch a movie with him and she kept going into my room, talking about crap I don't care about, while there's a person on call with me and we are watching something together, and when, after I let her do that for about 15 minutes and getting both of us pissed, I kindly tell her that I am watching something with my friend, her reply: oH i aM SO soRry fOR iNteRRuPtiNg yOu TWo, I cAnt eVEn ComE in TO Say anYthiNg nOw SinCE I Am bEInG So bOTheRSomE, fUck yOU stUcK up BRat"" and being a bitch to me yet again.

&nbsp;

>Moral of the story, I have no clue how to deal with her, I have been suffering with her like this for a good couple of years now, and even then it doesnt clean up the fact that she did some horrible and selfish things that ended up hurting me in the end all throughout my life, I have a bunch of undiagnosed mental problems, and can't get help even after she found out that I harm, and I have no fucking idea how I'm supposed to stand this type of thing for another couple of years before I could at least move or leave the  country.

relationship_advice,fpbp4vc,t3_gcjgiz,1588475242.0,">English is not my first language so I am really sorry for the mistakes. A bit of background: I’m currently in high school. My parents divorced when I’m 7 and I stayed with my dad since. He married again 5 years ago and up to now they have had 3 more kids. So ever since I was little my family has teach me that since the man is working to earn money it’s naturally for the woman to do all the chores and I believed that’s fair until just recently I realized that’s not it, households chores is a really tiring job too and both partners have to share them evenly. I just feel bad for my stepmom, she has silently endured the unfairness of my family.

&nbsp;

>I tried to help her as much as I can, do all the chores I could and look after my younger siblings whenever I could, I really hope I can lessen her burden but it didn’t seems to work, she and my dad still constantly get in quarrels. My dad can’t seems to understand how hard her job is. I get that he was raised with that obsolete mindset too and if I can understand it then he can too but I don’t know how can I bring this up to my dad, he just seems like he refuses to step into my stepmom’s shoes. She has to leave her home to come live with complete strangers, has to pleased her parents in law, has to be the mom role for us and for her own kids, all when she’s still in her 20, she had to give up her youth to devote for family and all my family does is expecting her to be a good mom, to take care of the kids, to cook 3 meals a day, to do all the chores.

&nbsp;

>And to worsen the situation whenever my dad see me doing chores or looking after the babies he yells at me for not being in my room and studying, he says that my only job is to study and go to a good college, he says he’ll take care of the kids but then he just left them with my stepmom to do his things.

&nbsp;

>I feel like their marriage is on the edge and there’s nothing I can do about it. They need to sit down and talk things calmly through but I can’t find a way to make them do that. I feel like I need to do something but I really don’t know what to do.

self,fpbnijp,t3_gcj6cq,1588474133.0,">So this past november, I was seriously concussed at my uni gym. While I didnt lose concussioness, I was pretty violently hit in the head by a steel bar that momentarily stunned me and left me slightly dizzy. For whatever reason however, I refused to acknowledge the fact that I could be concussed and remember thinking to myself that this is just another bump that I can walk off. In the past I had hit my head pretty hard before and had been fines a few minutes afterward. This one, however, was definitely different. It was almost painful to look at my phone screen and I remained dizzy for a few hours after the blow. Yet, in the moment, I was not thinking about a concussion or seeing a doctor.

&nbsp;

>It was a weekend and I had already made plans to see my new girlfriend and a few of my friends from college and finals were coming up. Although it seems beyond asinine and moronic now, I for someone reason didnt want to let these people down and thought I couldnt afford a concussion at the the time as I couldnt even fathom missing or delaying my finals so I felt like If I just acted like I wasnt concussed it would all go away. So that night and weekend I drank and went out with my friends and girlfriend and paid no heed to my head or really taking care of myself. While I noticed that a few things were definitely off including some slurring of speech and difficulty articulating myself, I thought everything would just go way through wishful thinking.

&nbsp;

>So being a dumb fucking idiot, I spent the next three week operating as if everything was normal. I still drank every weekend and drank coffee and subjected myself to enormous amounts of stress during finals. Then after coming home from finals around 3 weeks after the initial incident is when all of the symptoms first really hit me. Headaches, tremendous difficulty with word recall, retrieval, short term and long term memory. In short, I felt like a shell of my former self and endeavoured to take the next 2 weeks off to just recover and take care of myself. But, the story unfortunately doesn't end here.

&nbsp;

>No, instead, of just continuing to recover after those 2 weeks I went abroad to Europe for my spring semester. Although I proably knew it was not the smart or wise thing to do , I was enrolled in this program, hadnt told my parents about the concussion, was going with some of my best friends and felt like I had no choice. So while being fully aware of the potential long-term damage I was doing, I went abroad for the spring. While my friends were having the times of their lives, I was trying to perform a high-wire act of socializing and going out with them (which involved a good amount of drinking) and still giving myself the ability to rest and relax from time to time.

&nbsp;

>I did this for around 2 and a half months until I came back the middle of this March. Flash forward to now, I have spent the better part of these past two months taking it easy and have effectively stopped drinking and am now working on exercising and taking care of myself. While I am certainly not 100%, my headaches have largely gone away although I still feel a step slow cognitively, am very easily fatigued, have trouble holding long conversations and still struggle with memory and word recall/retrieval. I cannot stop thinking that I mortgaged and fucked up my future because I didnt have the foresight or the balls to tell my friends or family what was going and wanted someone to just wave a wand to make it go away.

&nbsp;

>Every day, I alternate between hope and despair about what my future will be and whether I have permantly damaged or compromised my cognitive faculties, my memory, my vocabulary, my wit, and my life. Worst of all, I have no one to talk to since I still havent told my parents or friends. Is there any chance of full recovery or ever getting back to who I was. I just feel very alone right now and would seriously appreciate any help or advice.

Advice,fpbiisr,t3_gciet6,1588470801.0,">Hello, I am a 16 year old teen who’s going through a really rough patch, ik people go through way worse and I feel selfish for posting this but here it goes. I’ve been having very extreme suicidal thoughts recently. I think it mostly stems from the loneliness I’m having due to corona, let me explain better. So before quarantine I was homeschooled for around 6 months, I began getting very mentally unstable during this period of time, I broke my hand during a breakdown in this time. But then I got into a school. Everything was great I was mentally good and mentally healthy, I even got a girlfriend, and then we got the stay at home order a few weeks after I got into the school.

&nbsp;

>me and my girlfriend broke up just recently due to that. I can’t leave the house, I’m an only child with my parents. And the mental instability is resuming from my homeschooled era and I’m not sure if I can handle it. It’s mostly at night that I feel like this. I ponder on the idea of suicide and every night I feel like I get closer to doing it and I’m not sure how I am gonna do this. I truly feel that the only thing stopping me is my parents finding their lifeless son in his bedroom, but by the way they downplay my pleas for help im not sure if that’s gonna stop me soon. My parents have a older style of thinking with the common phrase of “everybody’s in quarantine if they can handle it so can you” and so on.

>They won’t even bother listening to my cries for help. I’ve sat down and talked to them about trying to get me a psychological evaluation and they tell me I’m fine and I don’t need it. I know people are going through way worse in the world so I hate to post something like this but it’s really my cry for help. I don’t know if I can take this much longer. It’s like I’ve been dropped back off into my homeschooled era but this time I can’t see a single soul other then my mother and father. I do have a sister (when I said the only child I meant only in the home) and they won’t even let me see her.

>even with both my parents here I still feel alone. I’ve been losing appetite and weight over the last weeks. I can’t focus on the school assignments. I just space off at walls. Please somebody give me some form of advice to if not stop my destructive mindset, to at least slow it down from taking over cause I truly don’t know how long I can handle this.
