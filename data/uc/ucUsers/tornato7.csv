wallstreetbets,fopxl67,t3_g8v8xz,1587975557.0,"Famotidine is extremely common, there are other forms of H2 blocker / acid reducer like Ranitidine (Zantac) and Cimetidine. Unfortunately for the folks here, it's cheap, and the most popular brand Pepcid is made by Johnson & Johnson, which is so big that even with magnitudes increased Pepcid sales it probably won't move their earnings by much."

Edit: I was wrong, sent it to a friend who identified it as a flange for a big high pressure pipe (used in refineries?)"

UCSD,fojxwu2,t3_g7kkra,1587831614.0,How dare you. Banned for life.
fatFIRE,foj2g92,t1_fofjsox,1587805708.0,"This is a great answer. Question: would you rather own Reddit, the third most popular site in the US, or a company that commands 16% of the global food coloring market?

Now consider that Reddit has $100 million in revenue and is totally unprofitable, while 16% of the global food coloring market would give you $450 million in revenue, and you'd be wildly profitable."
UCSD,foeemho,t1_fodvypq,1587701906.0,"Chess is better than CoD:
-	More unit types
-	No mtx
-	No noobtubes
-	Based in medieval times
-	Can be played on older computers"

assholedesign,fnro8wx,t1_fnriu6q,1587195500.0,"I want to, but if I leave a review on any of my Google/Yelp accounts then it's tied to my name and people will know where I live. Maybe paranoia."
assholedesign,fnrh7fu,t1_fnrdmpg,1587188851.0,"Last time I went apartment hunting I don't think there was a single complex in my city with more than a 3 star rating. I concluded that most reviews are left in some spur-of-the-moment frustration with the apartments, maybe a resident's experience has been nice overall but their neighbors were being loud, or the pool was closed when they really wanted a swim, or their drain got clogged, then angrily wrote a review about how terrible everything is.

Where I'm currently living has a 2.2-star review on Google but I love it and would rate 5 stars. Most of the bad reviews are exactly what I described (or people complaining about a rent increase, which is fair, but it'll happen anywhere)"
sandiego,fnrgaxg,t1_fnpk0kv,1587188083.0,Hopefully some comic-con goers keep their flights and decide to take a mini vacation in San Diego instead (assuming anything's open).
sandiego,fnrg4d8,t1_fnpq26o,1587187925.0,"Don't you think a majority of the population will have been exposed by July of next year? If SARS is any comparison, the epidemic had pretty much run its course by the time a vaccine was being tested."

fatFIRE,fn81ym4,t1_fn7aei7,1586732211.0,"I'm seeing tons of houses near me with construction going on, even today. However we had some work being done on the house and now with the US-Mexico border closed most of our construction workers can't make it across the border.

I actually think HVAC and plumbing will be rather recession-resistant; everyone needs to shit and stay warm, even when the economy's bad."

wallstreetbets,fn2fpwl,t1_fn2etet,1586587400.0,"Don't take it that way! Most of the people I interview don't even know when to use JOIN, so if you're even halfway decent you're probably ahead of the pack!"
wallstreetbets,fn2e1kq,t1_fn28fzm,1586585779.0,"Most people I interview have SQL on their resume but can't answer questions beyond some simple SELECT statements. Personally I've been writing SQL daily for a couple years, get into some really complex shit with recursive CTEs and window functions, and I feel like I've just scratched the surface."
wallstreetbets,fn25cb1,t1_fn1yek8,1586578277.0,Most people are self-taught SQL. You're probably good at it.
NoStupidQuestions,fn1wrcm,t1_fn1qk6x,1586571976.0,Not unless you happen to have 30+ financially independent friends with no other responsibilities!
NoStupidQuestions,fn1wdpg,t1_fn1lj7g,1586571709.0,The best part is *everyone* had free time. I could call up 10 friends and have 9 of them show up to my house within an hour. After college getting 9 of my friends in the same place would be a massive undertaking.
