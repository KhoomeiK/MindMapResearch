Good luck getting an answer to your eye question!"
dogs,fpauj4b,t3_gc91cc,1588455990.0,"I have a Yorkie and my rule of thumb is this: every 10 mins or so, try picking her up and walk with her in your arms. If she struggles to get down for awhile, that means she's in good shape to keep walking, if she's content in your arms, that means it's time to be carried home and the walk is over."

AskReddit,fp2dgit,t1_fp27z91,1588259844.0,"It's an insertion fetish. Some people have the fetish of having sex with it watching sex between a normal sized person and a tiny person or a huge person and a normal sized person where the man or woman gets inserted (whole body) into the woman's vagina.

There's actually a ton of this on ""mainstream"" porn sites if you look for ""insertion"" ""core"" ""tiny"" ""unbirth"" type searches."

I mean obviously no one's faces very frontward but mine is more frontward than quite a few other women's I've seen. She could've been wearing a pad or thinx.

UCSD,fov38o8,t1_fotesez,1588094660.0,"Thank you for updating. It sounds like this will be resolved and that this instructor just has a terrible way of communicating and walking students through this process.

When is this meeting going to be held? Just make sure you have all the evidence I suggested above handy.

Best luck, OP"
mildlyinteresting,fotepw1,t1_fos4l47,1588051786.0,"I know it isn't the same but I had twisted legs until late middle school. I was always well liked, had a great friend group, and had a very happy childhood! I didn't feel like a physical deformity hindered me in any way except I couldn't run until I was 14 or so. I ended up being valedictorian at my local university and teach now. 

Your daughter is going to have an enriching life because she has parents that love her and she's going to have the advantage of being more compassionate and less jaded, which will make her more well liked- and for good reason!!:)"
UCSD,fote46t,t1_fotd1zo,1588051300.0,"Do not under any circumstance offer this up. That's a serious abuse of power, they have no right to look at your Google search history in your personal computer.

You say the exam was proctored, by what means? Responds lockdown?

Do you have the approval of the one sheet approved by professor in writing (e.g., email, canvas communication, syllabus, exam prompt). Make sure and save this. If on canvas screenshot that it's on the LMS and not just a PDF you downloaded. 

Do you know or have contact info for your peers in your class? You can email any or all students in your class using the ""inbox"" feature on canvas. Did they also use one page aides during the exam?

One quarter the instructor messed up poorly and the students in my class rallied together through email chain to create a joint letter expressing our grievances, proof of the instructor's error, and what we felt was the ethical means of resolving this mistake. We sent this out to the instructor first and then to the department head. Our concerns were heard and our grades changed. If you can, gather information about this from other students.

Good luck, OP. I'm sorry you're dealing with all of this stress during such a trying time

Edit: it would also help if you updated this post with the content of this academic integrity email. Like copy and paste with identifying info removed."

dogs,foplp0d,t3_g8srs7,1587964860.0,"Soft, low, soothing vocal tones. Slow approaches. Lowering yourself to a seated or even laying down position.

You could sit and place nice smelling treats on your knees and let him approach you followed by an encouraging voice when he does approach you"
AskDocs,fonhij0,t3_g8gw66,1587919600.0,"NAD but clarifying with your weight, height, age is pretty standard on these posts so doctors can assess how those factors play into your issue. Also some measurement to go on for nipple and breast size might be helpful.

I'm no doctor but I know that you can't do targeted weight loss. First approach should be cardio and diet to take weight off all over the body. Once you've completely that there are targeted approaches for shaping your pec muscles"
SDSU,fom0y8i,t1_foly6qt,1587875354.0,Also it's a pro-rated refund not a full refund. I don't know if that means the sooner you do it the more money you get back or if they go off the same universal date (March 18th?)

sandiego,fnv02j4,t1_fnu966c,1587275955.0,"Completely valid point. Corona virus is terrifying and the greatest public health crisis of many generations but this is also the greatest economic crisis in generations. People are losing their livelihoods, their industries, their ability to pay to live. Thousands will be committing suicide because of this economic catastrophe. It's important to recognize both tragedies as valid"

tifu,fmdlich,t1_fmcewti,1585970927.0,What's weird is there are these theories about how kissing on the lips started which involve mother's feeding their children by chewing food first (no food processors or blenders back in the cave days). It was seen as a sign of love and affection to care for your children and eventually that affectionate spread to romantic partners and took on a non-functional role
