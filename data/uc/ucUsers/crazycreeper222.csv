UCSC,foq1bue,t1_foq1441,1587979377.0,That is a good point. I feel like I have irrational fear and hatred towards math that makes it hard to be motivated to study hard for it
UCSC,foq18tv,t1_fopv1v0,1587979288.0,No I was goofing and dumb
UCSC,fooamj0,t1_foo6o3z,1587935628.0,good argument I gotta say I'm compelled and realized how much of a dumbfuck I am. You're obvously a savant when it comes to this no idea how I didn't consider that option before. Thanks man.

I feel like some people consider lack of empathy as a positive character trait. I really don't get mig it seems like he's doing the whole though love strict father figure act but seems to enjoy fucking over his students.
