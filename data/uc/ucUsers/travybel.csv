playboicarti,fpmdea1,t1_fpma26u,1588730637.0,Aight and the label is chill with him dropping such shit music then? Does carti himself not realize it‚Äôs shit?
playboicarti,fpm5ggd,t1_fpm3zm6,1588725953.0,How tf u heard it my guy. Don‚Äôt say the leaks üòÇüíÄ
playboicarti,fpm36pb,t3_ge5fdc,1588724625.0,This whole album gas üî•üî•
india,fplz8j8,t1_fplya7q,1588722353.0,I see this is very interesting then. I always thought  Byju‚Äôs was very successful since they had a lot of ads with SRK. How are they able to generate this much revenue and hype with such a poor product?
india,fplwn36,t1_fplpjcf,1588720893.0,So why exactly don‚Äôt they want to create a good product?
migos,fpldocx,t1_fpldi46,1588710854.0,How do you know this?
travisscott,fplddec,t1_fpj9lpe,1588710698.0,Lmao too real. I was at a party last December at one my friend‚Äôs who supposedly ‚Äòhated HJJH‚Äô. He fuckin played modern slavery and you know I had to call him out for it smh
travisscott,fpld8ex,t1_fpjcpjm,1588710626.0,Lmao fax when it initially came out I thought it was just bad trap shit but then like a week later I listened to where u from again and oh my god I lost my shit when Travis came in. After that I loved every song on the album lmao
migos,fplcpke,t1_fpjnffl,1588710365.0,It‚Äôs just to be in the limelight for cinco de Mayo as everyone shares their Mexican food stuff I guess. The fact that they‚Äôre doing this means the mixtape/album otw very soon
migos,fplclp3,t1_fpjcs40,1588710312.0,"Hopefully, now that they have an out, the mixtape bc I don‚Äôt want shit like that on culture 3 lmao"
playboicarti,fplcibv,t1_fpjeand,1588710264.0,But....Rodeo
playboicarti,fpj9i1q,t1_fpj7enp,1588660725.0,"Because he‚Äôs more than music, he‚Äôs an experience. His concerts go fucking insane and he always gives 100% for his fans which we love of course. And of course this argument is overused but Rodeo is one of the greatest rap albums ever lmao. Hes also had a lot of party bangers so people who don‚Äôt listen to his albums enjoy his singles which is something carti severely lacks"
playboicarti,fpj972g,t1_fpikgmx,1588660446.0,But I mean.....rodeo
migos,fpj7xy3,t1_fpj7iya,1588659304.0,Yeah they all have short verses but I really think they‚Äôre saving the good stuff for Culture 3. Tbh I don‚Äôt mind if quarantine mixtape has trash filler like this lmao

berkeley,fpdsvwe,t3_gcvqov,1588533558.0,"Yeah it is! It blows my mind. I'm an international student and it's crazy whenever I go back to my home country and tell people I study at Berkeley. They're always so impressed! I really love that feeling in that moment. I really wish more people understood this and enjoyed their time rather than complaining about ""how much work they have"" because so many people can only dream of the opportunities they're getting (not that many people aren't grateful, but this is something I've noticed idk)."

migos,fpajo6e,t1_fp0xakn,1588449558.0,I think I may have found a solution for you- change your region to North America and it might work. If your region is India apparently there are some conflicts between labels and Spotify so it may not appear under Indian region.
entourage,fpa6fw3,t1_fp93mx2,1588441765.0,Thought he was dying
entourage,fpa6do6,t1_fp9dvw2,1588441730.0,HAHAHA every time I watch that I fucking cringe. Vince is a pussy the whole time and the one time he chose to fight it‚Äôs against *Eminem*? Alright Vince

travisscott,fozbvfk,t1_fox66zn,1588188057.0,Yes
travisscott,fozb9k8,t1_foxym99,1588187770.0,Yeah I really think what Astroworld lacked was lyrical depth. No one can question the production of course but if Travis works on a deeper project lyrically it‚Äôll sweep at the Grammys. I think that‚Äôs why Igor won and not Astroworld even though they were the two best rap albums at the Grammys- lyrics. Rodeo‚Äôs lyrics had a lot more content than Astroworld‚Äôs
travisscott,fozaa4w,t1_foz385j,1588187299.0,Please don‚Äôt say ‚Äòsoon‚Äô

liluzivert,fosjgpw,t1_fosffu1,1588031909.0,"I didn‚Äôt do it, pretty sure it‚Äôs a Spotify update. But essentially artists get to choose to put a moving image instead of the album cover there like it usually is. Lots of other artists like Travis, weeknd have it too. You can switch between the animation and album cover by tapping the screen"

TheWeeknd,foq3vi8,t1_foo0btx,1587982046.0,How do you know his next album is allegedly going to be insane? I‚Äôm a huge Kanye fan ofc and I really want him to go back to MBDTF and yeezus days.
TheWeeknd,foq3glx,t1_fonj81o,1587981615.0,Kendrick is speculated to drop this year and when it does it will no doubt receive acclaim (just like everyone knew AH was gonna be amazing before it came out lol)

playboicarti,foio9ip,t1_foih7z5,1587791900.0,Nah he just says ‚Äúsoon‚Äù. Tbf he‚Äôs never flaked once he‚Äôs given a day/date
21savage,foi9u74,t1_fohxng2,1587781770.0,"It definitely does. Metro and 21 have been teasing 2 knives a lot recently and even 21's manager said that after the mellow vibes of Secret, ""we know what's coming"" implying that Savage is coming after all"
travisscott,fohe35n,t1_foh87zu,1587764406.0,For sure I love the balance that he has between chasing the bag and dropping music for the fans
21savage,fogtwgs,t1_fogg4km,1587756931.0,21 x Carti x Pierre would hit different
hiphopheads,fogfa2v,t1_fogeolu,1587751833.0,Damn I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs great but I don‚Äôt hate it as much as you...maybe it‚Äôll grow on you haha

travisscott,fogeaje,t1_fog12pm,1587751474.0,I agree with you but he can also be doing interesting things and chase the bag. All the stuff he does is cool af but when he drops all this insane merch for a single (highest in the room) it‚Äôs a little much
travisscott,fogdwwt,t1_fofsk72,1587751333.0,"Fr as a new Uzi fan and Travis stan, I love it!"
hiphopheads,fogc3bu,t1_fofvn09,1587750666.0,Eh what did you expect. I wasn‚Äôt expecting some super deep single. It seemed like they just collab‚Äôd randomly this quarantine and dropped a song
playboicarti,fo9hjbg,t1_fo9h2sy,1587619708.0,Don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs dropping this week...just got a bad feeling

21savage,fnv0vvu,t1_fnuxhhi,1587276665.0,"Nahhh highly doubt it. He‚Äôs fresh off the Grammy high, the label will want to push for his music to be dropped soon. I do think it‚Äôs literally a week or two away since he‚Äôs dropped this single now and the rollout has begun."

TheWeeknd,fnpfq6z,t1_fnpfacz,1587144710.0,Honestly not sure I wasn‚Äôt the biggest Uzi fan before EA (I only knew a few songs off each album) but after EA I‚Äôve come to appreciate him a lot more as a rapper now. Loved that rollout and love the whole concept and transitions of EA
TheWeeknd,fnpf7xy,t1_fnozsr1,1587144456.0,Nah it‚Äôs pretty good
playboicarti,fno398s,t1_fnntbmx,1587110453.0,"It‚Äôs different lol. Some artists are mainstream popular and some have large cult following. Eg- carti, Uzi, Travis, Abel, frank ocean. I get what he‚Äôs tryna say"

21savage,fnmomt0,t1_fnmo6y9,1587075236.0,Yeah but also Savage Mode was 6 songs and when 21 was new. Now he might be expanding on that sound and bringing different elements to the album since it will be longer. Who knows we‚Äôll find out tonight
21savage,fnm1z1x,t1_fnlzrtk,1587063685.0,Why do you say it‚Äôs not for Savage Mode 2? Tbh I think so too. I think it might be a single by Summer Walker
