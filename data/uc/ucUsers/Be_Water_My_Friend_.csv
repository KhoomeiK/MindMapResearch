berkeley,fo6ax9i,t1_fo5h0v0,1587553067.0,For anime I would say that I really like good drama in a show. My favorite of all time is Code Geass. Currently I'm watching Full Metal Alchemist: Brotherhood since I only ever watched the original version. For martial arts I learned a little Muay Thai but can't anymore due to all the gyms being closed. Interested in the Berkeley Judo program and Boxing club too assuming we eventually get to go on campus. This Bruce Lee quote is probably one of my favorite quotes of all time.
