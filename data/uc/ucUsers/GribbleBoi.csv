IdiotsInCars,fpb1ueb,t1_fparf6p,1588460340.0,"I guess what I mean is that you never know what can happen and should avoid doing this if people are around. The driver knew what he was doing, but pure chance messed stuff up. 

I see what you're saying, but my argument is that you should never do this around others, as pure chance can ruin a life. I try to do this stuff on backroads/streets at night when no one is around."

Source: Am patriotic South Indian.

For those reading and who are interested, South Indian languages come from the Dravidian language family, while North Indian languages stem from the Indo-Aryan family. While there has been some cross-diffusion (some languages have more than others), they are linguistically very distinct. Not the best analogy, but it's kind of like in Guatemala where they speak the indigenous peoples' Quechua and Spanish (not that Indo-Aryan languages are those of invaders, given what we now know about the Indo-Aryan invasion theory)."

I've found enough of them that I think it's doable.

berkeley,fp2vg71,t1_fp1pq4v,1588268550.0,"Tbh all you need going into stat 134 is calc all the way up to multivar. Even then, you could learn the multivar stuff you need on your own pretty easily. Everything else is taught to you. Data 8 teaches you basic probability which makes the beginning a little easier, but you could learn it on your own too.

It's not an easy class and I've become kinda lazy with Corona, but I've thoroughly enjoyed it. I think it's one of those classes where if you put a lot of time in, you can get an A (I haven't done this since Corona started lol). It's really just knowing the tricks and methods to use in certain situations. 

Anyways, take the adjunct, work hard, and you'll be fine! :)"
