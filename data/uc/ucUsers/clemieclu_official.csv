ADHD,foo1usj,t3_g8h5ae,1587930852.0,"I feel ya cuz Iâ€™m in the same boat. So far my motivation comes to me from time to time and I have no idea how to control it. Most productive days have been when I do some work out or just anything active. Only 5 days ago I started to gain motivation back but today Iâ€™m back to this apathetic state where I keep ignoring my responsibilities. Iâ€™m also trying meditation but I still havenâ€™t gotten used to it in order for it to be effective yet. 
I donâ€™t have any advice for you right now but I hope my story can help you in some ways. You got this!"
