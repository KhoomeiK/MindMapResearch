gambling,fp91br4,t3_gc343s,1588410520.0,"Set a goal. Pull out if you hit that number NO MATTER WHAT. That's the only way.

berkeley,fnuso5e,t1_fnu5793,1587270045.0,My GPA was around 3.7. I had 4 Ws. My Ecs were just different jobs mainly and one volunteering thing I did a while ago.

berkeley,fnrwytu,t3_g3dnp2,1587204792.0,Congrats! I went through a very similar situation. Started CC as a bio major and ended up dropping multiple classes with Ws and switching to econ. I half assed my applications in a week since I had no hope of getting in but somehow they let me in. It's crazy how life works sometimes. Hoping I can get into LA as well since I already live here. Good luck with everything dude!
