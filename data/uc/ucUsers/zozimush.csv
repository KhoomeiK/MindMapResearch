I call bullshit until I see a budget. In fact, we should demand daylight on every departmental budget right now, like in a publicly accessible database. The axe is going to start swinging pretty soon, and none of us are going to have easy access to the numbers that will be blamed for every shitty decision that gets made. And there will be a lot of them."

SantaBarbara,fnsymyc,t1_fnq2ycl,1587231285.0,"Well it seems like, at minimum, the Bureau of Prisons needs to speed up the time line on that field hospital and needs to get PPE to everyone and needs to make sure that they are actually quarantining folks who have the virus. Here's how to contact: https://www.bop.gov/contact/. It looks like (https://www.bop.gov/about/agency/bio_dir.jsp) the head of the BOP is appointed by the Attorney General, aka this guy: https://www.justice.gov/ag. Republicans, can you write to your people here, and see if you can get some traction on the action?  Also, it does look like there are ways to send packages to prisoners: https://www.bop.gov/inmates/communications.jsp. Maybe some coordination with families of incarcerated folks. Maybe we should all ask people we know who have been incarcerated what they think would help right now."
