starcitizen,fp3y8r0,t1_fp3x4ao,1588288050.0,"The Tevarin did have air shields before us.  That's where we got it from.  But that's like comparing China, which had gunpowder before Europe, to Europe, which had steel before China.  You can be more technologically advanced in some areas while being inferior in others.  Humans were just better than the Tevarin in almost all cases.  In fact, the air shields are the _only_ thing we took from them.  Who knows, maybe they'll hand wave air shields later on in a jump point issue or something

Without lore there's no universe.  You have to rely on it at some point otherwise you have no baseline.  Regardless, air shields contradicting themselves in lore have no crossover with cameras being superior to the canopies armor wise, at least in the case of the Prolwer which has a cockpit right at the edge of the hull unlike a practical use for cameras which would be deep into the hull like the 890 Jump.  That's not been contradicted yet, and since you have no proof otherwise, you can't make an argument cameras are better, at least as they're used in the Prowler."
starcitizen,fp3uj27,t1_fp3tpvo,1588286058.0,"Tevarins lost to the UEE.  Xi'an tech is the superior tech, not Tevarin.  It's literally mentioned in lore how they're inferior to humans.  

As far as we know the stuff protecting the screens is just regular hull and they have to use the more primitive camera system to protect their pilots, rather than using the stronger diamond laminate alloy.  Not to mention they're susceptible to EMPs far more than ships using the clear canopy

So the order of strength would be glass < hull w/ cameras < diamond laminate canopy

Finally, the Prowler is a recreation by Esperia.  Why would a niche recreation of an alien ship use superior technology than the _military_?  Oh that's right, because it doesn't"

* It doesn't carry a vehicle, which normally requires even more open space than players

* The troops are kept in a standing position rather than sitting, effectively halving the space needed for each person.  The drawback is that they would suffer more from evasive/turbulent flying if CIG ever adds G force effects to standing players

* Hallway space can be reduced since people don't need to move around like on say the Valkyrie, which not only has a vehicle but also many turrets.  Troops only need to move forward out one of the side doors
