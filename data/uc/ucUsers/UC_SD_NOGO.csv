UCSD,fpke47b,t3_gdsggw,1588693018.0,Diplomas have never shown minors. They are listed on the transcript only.
UCSD,fp6fk7u,t3_gb0lnd,1588351481.0,"For summer all work is to be offered asynchronously. That means that they have to offer you a different time than whats listed for the final, though you may need to contact the professor and specifically request it."
UCSD,fp6ffy5,t3_gb564t,1588351424.0,"Pass/no pass has no impact on GPA so having a 0.0 for the Spring due to pass/no pass will not result in academic probation. That being said, if your cumulative GPA is below a 2.0 an all pass/no pass quarter for spring wont help you bring the GPA up either."

You can also use the VAC to check with major and college to make sure its going to transfer how you want it to."
UCSD,fp6ey8o,t3_gbcgtx,1588351182.0,"Im sorry that this is happening for you. If you are suspended, when would it be, what year are you and what major?
Its possible you could still take classes somewhere else so that you dont really loose any time :("
UCSD,fp3f0bg,t3_gb0zbi,1588278155.0,Right now no adjustments are expected beyond Spring 2020.
UCSD,fp2eydg,t1_fp25r05,1588260594.0,If you want to get a refund you can try emailing commencement@ucsd.edu
UCSD,fow701j,t1_fow1a8u,1588114179.0,Extremely unlikely to happen in June.
UCSD,fow6v33,t1_fovs1yf,1588114108.0,Its because its still really unclear. We dont know what the social distancing mandate will be that long from now and we dont know what testing or the curve will look like. What was sent is the ideal should everything be going really well. It could still change if things dont continue to improve.
UCSD,fouryye,t1_foo6lks,1588089412.0,I have a little insight on both if you want to PM me.
UCSD,foursb4,t1_fopajjr,1588089326.0,Are you IGETC?
UCSD,fourmy0,t1_foqyoj9,1588089257.0,Its very difficult and if you are a transfer it will almost certainly extend your time to degree with no guarantee of approval. We generally suggest that if you got into an engineering program somewhere else that you consider accepting that offer.
UCSD,fouriz1,t1_for0gr7,1588089205.0,"Yes as thats how most folks meet the American History and Institutions (AH&I) requirement.

UCSD,four85b,t1_fos79de,1588089063.0,"Totally normal, they are adjusting the enrollment dates so they havent released the enrollment times to students yet."
UCSD,fouqkg5,t1_fory09l,1588088747.0,Pretty much this.
UCSD,fouqgu3,t3_g92tvn,1588088701.0,Not really a big deal unless you have a lot of them or a history to taking them in place of making good academic decisions.
UCSD,fouqc2t,t3_g9k6qw,1588088638.0,This is one of the few thats pretty legit. You have to have both a high GPA and meet specific course requirements to be invited. Congrats!
UCSD,foupf72,t3_g9fqxo,1588088200.0,"It means that they still dont know for sure how much coursework will be online or in person, however there will be some stuff online to support social distancing."
UCSD,fohhs0v,t1_fohfj8c,1587766198.0,Well most of it is still a construction site. Who knows if that will be the final look
UCSD,fohgb2i,t1_fog4uwl,1587765490.0,if you wd now its 25%
UCSD,fog0kq1,t3_g79vrq,1587746053.0,"If you withdraw it counts as a quarter attended, so you would automatically get a Fall registration date. If you take Fall off that would be your 1 quarter way and you would get a time for winter as well. Once you take Fall and Winter off you would need to file for readmission to return."
UCSD,fod2vvq,t3_g6skmn,1587679165.0,"Schedule comes out later this quarter and enrollment will be later. According to this it will be released on 5/12/20

UCSD,focxk0u,t1_fob5ph7,1587677196.0,"You are not a disappointment because you are feeling overwhelmed. You are human. We are all human and we all have points in our lives where we cant deal. Its better academically and personally to have been able to be honest enough and self reflective enough to realize that now rather than later when you maybe fail the class and everything else because you were trying to make something work that wasnt going to work. 
You see it as failure, I see it as bravery to take a look at yourself and your life and value yourself as a person and your academics enough to say ""this isnt working"" and to be proactive about managing that before everything goes down hill.  If you are feeling to much bad stuff please remember that CAPS is here as well. They are doing a bunch of different stuff including drop ins, groups, and individual zoom appointments. Please remember to be kind to yourself."
UCSD,fob5f07,t3_g6i7ub,1587656310.0,Currently there is no plan for the pass/np pass exceptions to last beyond Spring
UCSD,fob3vc0,t3_g6m1ej,1587655837.0,"Please remember that these are very strange time and that you need to have some grace with yourself. We forget that while you are worrying about school, and life and all the normal things there is also a part of our brain that is constantly thinking/brooding/worrying/being anxious about the world and covid and everything that we dont know. Having a portion of your self constantly wired in an ""on"" position is exhausting physically, mentally and emotionally. Living in uncertainty is a huge stressor that no one is shining a light on. Thats before we get to all the normal living stuff. 
Please give yourself a bit of a pass for focusing on taking care of yourself and realizing that school is not the most important thing in your world right now 
From a more mundane standpoint, no if you dont have financial aid, you arent getting VA benefits, on a visa or a student athlete there shouldnt be any issue with dropping to 8 units. 
If you want them I offer internet hugs, or high fives or whatever works for you to tell you that you didnt fail, you triaged so that you can come back stronger another day."
UCSD,fo720z6,t3_g5x52v,1587570852.0,"So if you leave voluntarily its very easy to come back. If you are gone more than 2 quarters you need to file for readmission. As long as you were in good standing when you left you will be readmitted. Its  an automatic, and you dont have to reapply or write essays or anything. It is not a competitive readmission process, its more of a request for reactivation.  If you were not in good standing then you need to be approved by your college, but again, you will be readmitted. Also your college and major can help you with CC course selection to make sure that the courses will transfer back and keep you on track if you still have anything lower division left to take. 

If you were academically disqualified, then you need to follow the disqualification procedures for readmission. 

The normal readmission can be found here:
