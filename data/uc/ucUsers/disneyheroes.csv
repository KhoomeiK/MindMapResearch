As you're probably aware, many campuses have already started distributing this $$. Why can they, but not UCR?"
ucr,fp73rjf,t1_fp71qg4,1588363512.0,"You think wrong: https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ope/heerfinstitutionalfaqs.pdf

Institutions have wide latitude on how to use the money. Also: 

> Institutions have the responsibility of determining how grants will be distributed to students, how the amount of each student grant is calculated, and the development of any instructions or directions that are provided to students about the grant.

Edit: Sorry, I didn't mean to sound like a dick, and re-reading it I did. I'm a little pissed both at the campus decision and giving 3x the money with no consideration of the gender and sexual preference impact of that decision. It should have been an objective needs-based decision.

The GOOD NEWS that institutions have lenience is that we can continue to advocate for our needs and hold leadership accountable where we can. Realistically, some of that money is going towards things like laptops to help students with campus closure, which is fine. But they CAN and SHOULD give us more than half the money."

Just some real data so you're not disappointed. Also doesn't mandate it get distributed evenly, just that $14,867,313 go directly to students somehow. With 23,922 students, it'd be about $620 if it was split evenly.

So /u/Uncle_Creepy_ shouldn't say it's $700 minimum. Plus, you have to be eligible for federal aid, too."
