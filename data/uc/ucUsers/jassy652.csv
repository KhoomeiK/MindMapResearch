UCI,fp0wi4r,t1_fozodyb,1588218504.0,"The people vehemently hating on protestors or people against quarantine have the privilege of being able to make a living with the quarantine situation. Many are students who receive financial aid, student loans, or mommy/daddy's money. They will still eat and be able to buy necessities because their livelihoods are not impacted by the lockdown. What they don't realize is that there are small business owners who are struggling to make ends meet. Their business may be less than 2 years old (no SBA loan), too late in applying for PPP which ran out of funding days after it was released (no money), and will probably be kicked out of their shops because commercial RE landlords are allowed to kick people out during the pandemic. They don't check their privilege of being able to make a living while others are forced to close down their businesses that feed their families. Not to mention the older retired population whose income rely on passive income streams such as rentals."
UCI,fp0vjkn,t1_fp0iljq,1588217883.0,">Here you go.

Noted. I'm still holding out for solid data which should come in a couple weeks. As evidenced by this pandemic, we suck at projections."
UCI,fotf987,t1_fot4832,1588052220.0,"Came here to say this too. One doctor/researcher gave a press conference and said it was 0.03% in CA. Wtf. That's flu level death rates. I'll gladly shut up if yall prove that this is as deadly as the media played it out to be. With the testing rates laughable and biased towards symptomatic people, and death counts including ALREADY TERMINAL patients with secondary infection of the novel coronavirus, I don't doubt that the current national mortality rate is highly inflated. Once again, yall are welcome to prove me wrong in a few days or weeks. If you do, then that means I didn't throw away a year of my PhD work in the trash for nothing."
UCI,fotetid,t1_foscnob,1588051868.0,"Take my upvote. Live in NB and it's great. College students who have never paid any significant amount of taxes in their life and who are not small business owners affected by the quarantine have so much privilege they don't acknowledge. Literally, check your privilege. We can't all rely on the government for everything. Someone has to pay for all this shit. And many people can't do that when the government is forcing them to shut down their livelihoods."
unpopularopinion,foewynl,t1_foep3i2,1587717701.0,"This is mostly correct. Instead of decoding the entire genome, there's a list of primers they use for specific genes that are related to congenital diseases. This way they don't have to look at the entire thing."
unpopularopinion,fn81hyw,t1_fn7nx0u,1586731943.0,"As a fellow depressed person with the same concerns, I've learned that most of the time, it's the other people's issues that get in the way. I'm a fucking cool person with so much to offer and they just can't see that or are intimidated by it. The key for me is to find like-minded people who will check on me daily, send me memes, hang out at least once a week, and talk for hours on end. These people do exist, it's just that there's a lot more self-absorbed people out there. And then when shit hits the fan, they wonder why no one is there for them."
unpopularopinion,fn80wxu,t1_fn7wugh,1586731602.0,"I totally agree with this. I don't understand how communicating with your friends is such a tall order. I've always been the one to reach out and plan things, but like you said, it is exhausting. I moved to California in my late teens, and comparing the friendships that my childhood best friend now has with her current friends in the Philippines, she hangs out with them every weekend. Like she has a friend group of at least 8 and they all hang out very frequently. Imagine that. I live in a beach town and I only really see one friend weekly when there's always cool things to do around here and I know my other friends are close by, and they're just not reaching out unless I do it first. I've now learned that I've done my part and have asked them out multiple times so it's now their turn. No invites yet."
unpopularopinion,fn7zvcp,t1_fn7ijrj,1586730990.0,Same.
unpopularopinion,fn7zq0g,t1_fn7ic35,1586730905.0,"Yikes. Sounds like you have a very negative view of your friends. Like if you don't care about their day and what's happening to them, why even keep them around?"
unpopularopinion,fn7z2jv,t1_fn79gvv,1586730528.0,"I used to be this person. Got exhausting real quick. I was the one hosting the parties, paying for everything, making email invitations, facilitating planning, but not once did anyone invite me anywhere. They just assumed I'd plan everything. Then when I stopped and waited for them to take the lead, it just never happened. Good riddance. Now I have a very small group of people to have fancy home dinners with."
unpopularopinion,fn7ys7w,t1_fn7pmeo,1586730361.0,"I agree with your sentiment. People keep saying that true friends can pick up years later and still be connected, but what even is the point of friendship if you don't spend time and create experiences with them? Like I get being an introvert, but painting people who are different as somehow needy and draining you is just baffling. Like if you don't want to put in the work of making and keeping friends, then don't have any. If you're not going to reach out and perform the role of a friend, then you don't get to label other people who did not stick around as ""not true friends"" according to your skewed belief about friendships."
unpopularopinion,fn7y3vx,t3_fzwtt4,1586729965.0,"I agree with this to a point, but only if I feel that they are not making the same effort back. I totally understand if my friend lives more than an hour away, then yeah, we can't hang out as much and if we don't see each other in person, then we won't have as much things to talk about. But if my friend lives 15 mins away and doesn't even want to meet up or even talk on the phone, then I'm going to do a slow fade. I'm a small friend group type of person, but I am very much an extrovert and am very social. If my ""friend"" doesn't want to do social things with me or even come over and bake shit, then it's going to be a no for me. 

Also, it's great that you're honest about your feelings regarding friends and hopefully your friends feel the same. I personally cannot stand friends who don't bother to answer my messages or always rejects my offer to hang out. Currently, I have none of those friends because I dropped them. I didn't even tell them I was dropping them. I simply stopped reaching out and not surprisingly, there is zero effort on their end so it just fizzled. It's not that I don't have a life or that I'm super codependent with my friends, either. I'm a very busy person too but I value my friendships so of course I want to spend time with them. 

In the end, you do you."
AskAcademia,flq9s5o,t3_fq0jel,1585385254.0,"I would never be able to work in a lab like this. I would go weeks without talking to my PI and when we do meet, I just present data and talk about future directions. This is sooooo NOT NORMAL. Granted, my lab situation is very hands off, but daily reports, really? Even weekly reports are too much. Like send a report when you get data. 
I'd leave if I were you. Maybe go with the other mentor that you get along with. This is not worth your mental health. Also, make sure to talk to the grad division of your department. They can usually shuffle people around especially if you're a first year. They also probably already know about your horrible PI and other grad students probably left that same lab early like you might do. If enough people quit the same lab enough times, the grad division of your department may lowkey refuse to assign your PI grad students in the future (true story)."
