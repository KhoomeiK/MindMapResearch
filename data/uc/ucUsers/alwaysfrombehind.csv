SCAcirclejerk,fpe8myc,t1_fpdh9t2,1588542549.0,Sorry I’m not against people judging others for how they look. Especially weight.
SCAcirclejerk,fpdd3qa,t1_fpcevbu,1588524626.0,"Yeah I don’t get why it’s ok to go after someone’s weight and ~~knowing they must have an eating disorder based on a few videos of what they eat (which I believe was estimated to be about ~2000 calories a day, but low in fat?). If it’s not right to judge a persons health based on their size then that goes for everyone. 

I’m not a fan of Drays and only know her through the jerks, and she is a bit weird, but damn people come at her"

ThePlotAgainstAmerica,fo4nwpx,t1_fnwujas,1587507859.0,"I think there's a part of the line that also was comparing Hews to black people, and that to a white/racist person, they are just the same. In Ford's mind, the Jews should be segregated just like blacks. 

Look at the scenes in the last episode in Kentucky -- the Klan, while most people would first associate them with going after black people, they're going after random jews including a woman just driving home from work (which also implies it's simply about 'looking' Jewish since there's not exactly a tattoo we all have or some other guarantee of our jewishness). Then, when Sandy and Herman are safe and eating those sandwiches, the family behind them is black. I think there's definitely a distinct choice to compare and contrast antisemitism with racism, but not in a 'one is worse than the other' way, but rather that America has a very visible history of racism against blacks and with this one single change of who is in charge, it could happen to some other group."

TrollXChromosomes,fmlvcsv,t1_fmlizf4,1586193909.0,"Everyone I’ve talked to personally thinks joe is a trash human, as well as all the other main players/tiger owners in this show (Carole included). Unfortunately this kind of media always brings out fans who will blindly support someone, although I’m sure many of the hashtag users are doing it for the meme and will move on to some new meme in a few weeks. Remember that Charles Manson had fans and got engaged in prison."

This interview says that he prefers male pronouns but is not bothered by the misgendering. He also says that while he uses male pronouns, he does not specifically identify as trans (second link).

Edit just to add that I think the documentary was absolutely wrong to Ki’s gender him. It also just seems that he’s not bothered by it."
