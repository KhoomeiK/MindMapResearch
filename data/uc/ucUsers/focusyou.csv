UCDavis,fpeg86y,t3_gcz9zu,1588546939.0,doesn't really matter honestly. you see pretty much every type of bike. i only recommend buying a used bike if its an actual good bike. otherwise just go to walmart or something and buy a $100 mountain bike.

relationship_advice,fp45c2j,t3_gb44qt,1588291996.0,yikes. i know exactly how you're feeling right now. i'd be really fucking annoyed with her attitude. maybe she'll be mature and apologize later. i honestly can't tell you what the right move is - to wait for her to talk to you or you talk to her. i have no idea...

UCDavis,fp0b6bz,t3_gajnsq,1588205909.0,">taking it off would definitely be saving money

what? this is not even true at all. tuition is going to be exactly the same, with or without zoom. you're not saving money at all. you're just going to graduate later if you take off the quarter. and what are you going to do in the gap instead? work?

i think it is a stupid mistake to take a gap quarter, unless you are severely impacted by having online classes. if you want to cram more classes into your next quarters to graduate on time, or stay a quarter after your normal graduation time, go ahead.

if you are taking upper division courses, you can't even take CC classes either. so don't bother."
