screenshots suck unless they're truly extraordinary

achievement posts suck just kinda in general

complaint posts are hit and miss because people on this subreddit are terrible at evaluating cards / the game / their own experiences. sometimes they're justified, sometimes they're just whining and refusing to analyze their own plays

personally, i enjoy the best of each of these categories, in addition to actual content like Firebat's unfortunately rare ""How to beat X class"" videos"

unpopularopinion,fnjycqe,t3_g206sh,1587009946.0,"this is not an unpopular opinion, either among smokers or non-smokers

given the beating and threats, and the mention of CPS, and the mention of the effect on kids, it sounds like you have terrible parents and are blaming their smoking rather than the fact that they are terrible parents. in which case, i am sorry, and you should tell CPS about the beatings and threats rather than focusing on the smoking, which is just an excuse to beat and threaten you

you may feel that no one on this post believes you, but don't chalk this up to ""having an unpopular opinion"". people on this post do not believe you because you generalized all smokers instead of specifically your horrible parents, and almost all smokers are not this unreasonable

call CPS and focus on the abuse, rather than the smoking. ""smoking inside"" is not a reason for CPS to take action, but beatings and threats as a result of smoking are a reason."

hearthstone,fngj65x,t1_fng6bz0,1586933917.0,"Patron Warrior was one of the most skill and choice intensive combo decks. It's one of the combo decks that you can't just describe as ""draw your combo and count the lethal""; it required a lot of game sense to know when to break up pieces of your combo in order to get a stronger board position. That's the reason the deck managed to survive after the Warsong nerf- its combo pieces could also output strong midrange pressure, and both versions of the deck took a lot of skill to know when to hold and when to go in."
