I can forgive my alcoholic dad. But that doesn't negate his wrongdoings -- they still exist and they still happend. That's what I'm arguing.

His son's arc is important, but the viewer tends to glorify the father, Edward Bloom. The son matured and learned to forgive. Edward Bloom is still the same old jerk and doesn't care. He never changes... not one bit.

You're assuming I don't understand the movie. I do. I'm not arguing it's a bad movie, or that it's not fun. It's actually one of my favorite films. 

At the end of the day Edward Bloom abandoned his son, not just literally but symbolically. Yes, he is forgiven for his sins. But he's still a bad person.

Edit: I added a few lines. Just watch the movie again. I'm serious, Edward Bloom from start to finish never changes. He never gives up who he is. Meanwhile his son has to be mature and forgive. But Edward Bloom gives **zero** fucks. 

It's a fun movie and has an amazing charm. I watch it often because I love Edward Bloom's story, but at the end of the day it symbolizes a romanticized bachelor life.  The same way a guy at the bar will tell you of the stories when he was young and free. They are fun stories to listen to..."

My dad was like this. My dad disappeared in my early years. When he decided to drop in, he would talk about his drunken adventures and how great it was to be single and child free. He would always reminisce and not give me the attention. 

My dad is not a bad guy. He's just a bad father. People like him. I like him as a person. But at the end of the day, I didn't need a good personality, I needed a father

Now look at Big Fish. Edward Bloom is roaming around not giving a care. His story is happy because he has no children. He never talks about his son. He doesn't care for his son.

Ask any parent that loves their child to describe their life. They will all mention their child at least one damn time. Because having a kid is a big part of your life or it isn't.

Edward Bloom never mentions his son. Never. Not once. You can tell all he cares about is his bachelor life.

Literally he cannot stop one day to give his son attention. Not even til the day he died. 

His son forgives him, but what else can he do? His dad had a problem. He just accepted it. Like when a parent is alcoholic or has dementia. What can you do? You just accept it because you can't change them.

I understand his dad's passion for life and his stories. But how is it different from someone's father who skips out and blows all his money on a good time in Vegas? It's not too different.

The dad claims he was helping people. Maybe he did. But his duty as a father was never there. His only duty was to his lifestyle, not his family

What I'm saying is that the dad is a complete jerk. Despite coming back to the family, he celebrates and romanticizes his bachelor days.

In the beginning his son says ""I was only a footnote in my father's stories."" And by the end of the movie it happens again. The dad tosses his son's feelings out the door. The son is not the focus of many scenes/parts and is painted as a jerk for wanting his father to love him

At the end, I wonder if his son forgave him just because he knew his dad was gonna die. There's no use holding anger with a dead man.

relationship_advice,fotbgvs,t3_g9gkgb,1588049253.0,"You need to learn to let go. I get the teenage obsession, but one thing you have to realize that some things aren't meant for you. 

At the end of the day, imagine you get the girl... then what? You lose a friend and start dating a girl who may or may not like you... You may not even actually like her once you get to know her too 

Perhaps you need to stop obsessing on how to get a girl and focus on improving yourself. Become the better person that someone wants to date. Workout, learn cool skills, become more social, etc.

I was a nerdy kid growing up. Now, I don't have any issues with women. But the main thing I've learned is to back off when it's not meant to be. 

Being eager and obsessive is the worst way to get someone. You need to be comfortable being alone and love yourself. Imagine the flip side, some creepy girl hiding in the bushes chasing you. It's weird.

Be you. Love yourself. Find what's best for you."
relationship_advice,fotb290,t3_g9gkqn,1588048953.0,"Typically it's someone who has a history of abandonment and now carries fear/insecurities. 

That, or sometimes it's just young people who haven't yet had true friendships/relationships and don't know how normal social interactions.

If you read a lot of posts on this sub, you hear about young adults who don't know how to handle their emotions or communicate. 

It's common, but that doesn't mean that you should tolerate it. Tell them it's not ok and that they need to mature"
relationship_advice,fotask0,t3_g9gkvk,1588048755.0,"How do you actually feel? She suggested a guy for you and then later hooked up with that same dude.

I don't feel she has had your feelings in mind during all of this. It sounds like she had Brian's back, but not yours. I don't think she did it out of malice, but that doesn't change the fact that it may have hurt you.

You have a right to feel upset if you do. I feel like you were tossed into a love triangle for no reason at all. You could have just been left out if it wasn't for her. 

If you do befriend her again, I suggest to keep your distance in a sense. She needs to regain your trust, not the other way around.

I'm surprised that Laura hasn't reached out to apologize or to at least talk about it. I doubt she cares if she hasn't. Or maybe she is too introverted and insecure to be upfront.

You do you but I recommend not surrounding yourself with people who don't treat you with the same respect that you give them."
relationship_advice,fot8uk3,t1_fot37ye,1588047352.0,"Definitely tell your dad. If a guy is willing to date your mom in order to get to you, they are likely dangerous.

My female cousins have had their share of creeps and stalkers. I tell them to never let their guard down and allow themselves to be alone with these types of creeps. I teach them to warn people and make sure they have more eyes on these jerks."

PoliticalCompassMemes,for8sfs,t1_foq8hqe,1588008115.0,"Well, that was a character he played. Stephen Colbert on Comedy Central is different from the real Colbert. 

He's said that before. His new show is a late night talk show format and less of that Onion/Daily Show political satire."
MurderedByWords,for7v4t,t1_for55fv,1588007666.0,"Fair. I also think most celebrities tend to be like that except rock stars. You'll never see most celebrities badmouth their source of income.

That's the same reason the Hollywood Me Too movement took so long. No one wanted to call out the people who pay their checks. 

Even Hiphop artists/rappers, we see them badmouth the system until they become a part of the system."
MurderedByWords,for3ea8,t1_foq6veu,1588005492.0,"I can give Ellen a pass because she is a comedian. She is paid to be a jokester and drop dumb one-liners.

I don't watch her show, but I get why she made the joke. The issue may be more that her brand isn't to be a ""jerk"" unlike Conan. So if you hear Conan saying it, you know he's being a sarcastic jerk for the sketch.

Her joke just landed poorly and flopped."

TitansTV,foqndfy,t1_foq8xmh,1587997254.0,"Same. Also, Red X seems more skilled than Robin and usually outsmarts him, which would lead me to believe it's not Jason. Dick should be more skilled than Jason at that point, since Jason would likely still be training for his role as Robin"

relationship_advice,fopetpi,t3_g8hqs6,1587959682.0,"Definitely call him out on it. Trust your gut feeling. He may not be cheating but he is definitely acting weird.

If he wants another woman, then he needs to be upfront about wanting to leave and not play with your emotions.

You should have a talk with him. As a guy, I want my partner to be comfortable and feel like my top priority. When I look sexy, it's for her. But I've seen cheaters and what you describe is spot on.

You know what's going on. Trust yourself and stop enabling this behavior from him, otherwise he will keep doing this"
TigerBelly,fop9fzs,t1_fop8zkn,1587956057.0,"I take that as more of an ""I will never financially recover from this"" lol

Bobby always talks about coming up but still not making as much as other comedians around him. Even though he has a sucessful podcast to support him, I imagine he still needs projects and standup to keep the money flowing and to build his brand.

I know they are famous in a sense, but I doubt they are exempt from having financial worries like the rest of us. If I remember correctly, they moved into a new house this year or last year.

I hope they are doing ok.

Edit: Or she is bummed that their goals are slowed down. Like, Bobby's standup special or new projects. 

I know I'm bummed my life is on hold"

netflix,foonai1,t1_fooj40s,1587942408.0,"I mean that's the point of that container for things you watched recently. Some people like rewatching stuff, especially young teens and kids.

Literally the top shows on Netflix have been The Office and Friends, which are shows that people rewatch over and over again.

Even movies, imagine how many children are watching the same movie over and over. When I was 5, I saw the Lion King 100 times

I get your issue, but that's what the category is for"

It's not so much about ""I'm voting for a woman because she's a woman"" but rather people choose to vote for wealthy white men too much and when that is challenged people lose their minds.

Every 4 years in the US we fight over which white man we should vote for"
therewasanattempt,fons5aw,t1_fomiyyb,1587925398.0,"In the US, we often say that, but 44 out of 45 presidents have been a white male. People always say Obama was voted because he was black. But people forget that Americans vote for certain candidates because for the sole reason that they are rich white males. 

It's a weird thing where race/gender doesn't matter, but suddenly when we aren't talking about a white male, then it becomes an issue"
