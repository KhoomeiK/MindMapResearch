VALORANT,fpc02zf,t1_fnpwnoz,1588483433.0,"your statement is pretty ignorant tbh, it has access that ONLY THE KERNEL should have on your pc. you say it isn't ""scanning, collecting, sending/receiving data"" though it definitely does those things, that is how an anticheat does its job and personally i get riot's goal but given their history and their major stakeholders I would rather go play csgo."
VALORANT,fpbzjx8,t1_fnqtjko,1588482984.0,"well the access to cheating is certainly limited a lot more, as it becomes a bit harder when vanguard runs in ring 0. though, it doesn't matter much at the end of the day there will still be cheats. I'm not installing the game, not worth the risk to my PC."
LosAngeles,fp8t4uw,t1_fp8ryhc,1588402119.0,"was about to say that too, honestly one of my favorite water parks as a kid"
LosAngeles,fp868ss,t1_fp7ivlx,1588384583.0,"909 is riverside, right?"
Coronavirus,fp85idw,t1_fp75evw,1588384046.0,I thought it was per 100k?
Coronavirus,fp84yya,t1_fp7p7a6,1588383639.0,"sadly this, nothing will change in america and most brainwashed chinese will continue to believe that their government handles everything best even though they still suppress some covid 19 data"
Coronavirus,fp84tup,t3_gbiwcm,1588383529.0,Is it propaganda if its true?
GlobalOffensive,fp42mif,t1_fp40ydc,1588290466.0,i mean which old version of c9 tho
politics,fo9wdma,t1_fo9facw,1587633262.0,"Second on this tbh, most of the red counties in cali have a questionable education history"
UCSD,fo62lt2,t1_fo5pu0k,1587544172.0,"Not really the amount of students in triples is still just to keep hdh with some amount of resources, though I do agree its a very shitty practice."
pics,fo51wyy,t1_fo4zsuk,1587515750.0,"I know in the context of your statement its mostly people who lean far right/conservative, but its even scarier that in the scope of the entire country it is actually the same exact people who have the same mentality. Whether its just a straight up fuck you, or the lack of education which leads to a plethora of false information ."
UCSD,fo517eu,t1_fo50leg,1587515321.0,Yes but those funds are for self sustaining services they dont really generate much profit in comparison to tuition?
Coronavirus,fo2c2fk,t1_fo2bvsg,1587456731.0,idk my family comes from an area riddled with drug vrelated violence and  no many of my friends and family (albeit from the same area) have the same mentality. never did i say people should be charged without evidence.
Coronavirus,fo2br1n,t1_fo1x2w6,1587456402.0,"Typically drug offenders such as producers and sellers associate with those who do though, or profit off of it which is just as bad imo."
Coronavirus,fnob68f,t1_fnnnegn,1587119008.0,"Well it depends what type of masks, surgical masks and cloth based dont., however n95s and other masks that are airtight and have the ability to filter air particles do. So they were partially wrong."
UCSD,fn0aoep,t3_fydo0c,1586538476.0,"The Guardian is a student newspaper right? It's not exactly going to be ""real journalism"", other than a bunch of opinionated articles."
LosAngeles,fmw2edk,t1_fmv5451,1586437933.0,"just finished west wing and I loved it, is there anything else that is similar?"
LosAngeles,fmw2buj,t1_fmvbovx,1586437884.0,"sadly this, though you could enforce something similar if you invoke martial law using the national guard. not exactly total isolation but you check each person coming in and out."
Coronavirus,fmw0va0,t3_fxb13q,1586436839.0,Thats what happens when you shove half the states population in 1 city.
GlobalOffensive,fml579s,t1_fmkxxhg,1586178894.0,"yeah when you have insane clips it definitely does,so its inconsistent if you don't actively practice this type of aiming."
GlobalOffensive,fmkwu05,t1_fmkps5r,1586171661.0,"I have the same sens almost (1.7 at 400) and do the same thing. It feels weird using my arm to make large movementst, so I primarily use my wrist to aim (it looks snappy like int he clip) and somewhat perfected it."
