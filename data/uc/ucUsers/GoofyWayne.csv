UCSD,fpbw565,t1_fpbuzre,1588480297.0,"I guess the old adage 'to each their own' applies perfectly here. It's a chill beach city vibe that I've wholeheartedly embody. Spending time in the East Coast depresses me immensely when I can't taste the sun, I'll never be able to give up my slides/sandals for any city :p"
UCSD,fpbsdwq,t1_fpbrcx7,1588477527.0,"Honestly I feel like each city offers different experiences..lowkey tho if you're not an adventurous person then don't expect a city to cater towards you. I mean no disrespect but all it really takes is a dope group of friends & 1 person with a drivers license :) Bruh that's kinda why I never felt the whole Socially Dead concept...like I legit had childhood friends attending UCSD with me, so I got lucky there"

AskEurope,fomfvy4,t1_fnmx63o,1587888528.0,"I have a knack for like figuring out the Canadian accent. For the most part I would say somewhere around 85% is similar across the board but certain words like 'sorry' and words with the 'ou' are easy tells for me. As a Native Californian I can usually pinpoint regions where other Americans are from, honestly tho what's lowkey surprising to me is speaking to Canadians that literally have like my accent (I'm from Socal) with out ever having lived here \\(\~.\~)/"
AskEurope,fomdh4c,t1_fncx75k,1587886099.0,"There's for sure a Baltimore accent, them being black did contribute to more of an additional accent, I don't know if this makes sense. Essentially a 'Baltimore accent' + 'Black accent' is what you heard. As a Californian when I visited the city I had trouble at first understanding the people irregardless of race."
AskEurope,fomcu34,t1_fnb77mk,1587885473.0,"I'm an american from Socal specifically San Diego, and there is definitely a Baltimore accent (have a sibling that teaches there). I do concur that there is an added blaccent but also understand that a black person from L.A. sounds completely different than one from the east coast and the south. Essentially there is the regional dialect that exists there naturally but any additional modification comes from a persons background i.e. Latin, White, Black ect..."

I phonebanked, donated my lunch money, canvassed (even with my anxiety) when I tell you how my passion for Bernie is what won over my siblings,  progressives disenfranchised with the system. Bernie made me believe in a future, so when people try to shame me into voting for Biden whom in my humble opinion believe that Biden & Trump are two sides of the same coin. I will not I repeat will not condone DNC fuckery, I'm a Berniecrat through and through, I will continue to fight for the policies we all believe in. Call me delusional but Bernie is still on the ballot...."
