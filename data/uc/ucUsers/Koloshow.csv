PS4Deals,fokzezp,t1_fokxant,1587851874.0,"Well, for one the movement is very different. In this game, you can spring with any character, and you kind of have to if you don’t wanna move at a snail’s pace. There’s no class variants or different abilities. It’s just one type per class, and now you can equip upgrades. 

In general, this game is a lot more beginner-friendly. The hitboxes are much bigger, the character models are larger than the previous installments, and it’s just easier to get into. Initially, I really didn’t like it when I first played it, but that was most likely because I played it pre-release. It’s just a much more solid game now. It definitely grew on me over time."

At least I definitely won’t be able to everyday and stay there for hours upon hours. I’ve just never had this sort of situation happen before so I’m completely lost, with exams right around the corner. I’m just hoping the professors are somewhat accommodating. I really appreciate the help!"

Pick up the Danganronpa and Zero Escape games!

I highly recommend picking up the Danganronpa games. Just be aware, it is HIGHLY recommended you play the them in order. It creates for a far better experience.

Danganronpa (1, 2, and V3) series. I’ll describe the first game in the franchise to make it easier on the both of us but the other two games also follow the same formula and greatly improve upon them. The premise is that 15 students get trapped in a school by a robotic bear named Monokuma, who forces them into a killing game. He presents the students, who all excel in something, with motives. Whenever a student is murdered, investigation commenced, after which the trial comes in where you find the culprit. The game is a visual novel so it’s very heavy in the reading, but there’s gameplay elements spread throughout the game. The game has a fantastic plot full of plot twists and highly memorable and unique characters. You’ll have great fun with this one. It is hands down my favorite franchise of all time. The games just get better with the sequels. There’s also a spinoff, Ultra Despair Girls, which is on sale as well.

I would highly suggest you check out the Zero Escape series if it sounds like anything up your alley. All 3 games are fantastic and your choices truly matter. It’s not as visual novel-y as other visual novels (it’s got plenty of puzzle rooms)."

I’ve only ever lived on Dykstra, but the classics have been pretty active, especially my last one. I’d recommend it over plazas."
