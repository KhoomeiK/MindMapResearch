berkeley,fpmu3gc,t1_fpmskf6,1588741764.0,"HAHAHAHA it took me three tries to read thru the spec for MERGE alone. I am also enrolled in an upper div lit class this semester, but 61B somehow requires more reading comprehension."
berkeley,fpmu0hm,t1_fpms3k0,1588741701.0,"OMG same, before 61B I was kinda meh about pursuing CS partly because I thought it was just ok fun and partly because I didn't think I had what it takes to do CS. But after 61B and the high of gitlet, I have totally decided that I wanna do CS. It is SO MUCH FUN and it turns out that if I work hard enough I can do it just like everyone else."
berkeley,fpmqzwp,t3_gczs94,1588739452.0,"HAHA the struggle is so real. One thing I never really understood about 61b style was the method length limit. I guess the point is to not write methods that are too long and try to abstract whenever possible. However for methods like merge I just felt that even with abstraction and a few helper methods, mine was still \~70 lines just due to the complicated logic and setup and it was a real pain to have to try to cut it down from there. 

Just out of curiosity, in the real world of software engineering, is this like strictly reenforced? Do people care if it is 70 or 80 lines? (granted like it is under 100 cuz that would be excessive for sure, 60 just seemed like such a random number for me)"
berkeley,fpmqqbm,t1_fpfk6g3,1588739259.0,"If you do /\*\* and then hit return above a method signature, it actually does the formatting for you including the param names which I thought was really helpful!"

berkeley,fpjdrie,t3_gds099,1588664825.0,"I LOVE my 13 inch MacBook Pro, given that it is a 2017 version so 3 years old already (but it is still working perfectly!) 

I agree with the other commenters in that portability is everything, I used to have a 2013 MBP even though it was also, my current MBP is much lighter (I think when I bought it, the 2017 MBP weighted the same as the old version of air at that time) and it really shows, I don't think I can ever go back. 

As for the neck thing, get a triangle looking thing that rises the screen (if you know what im talking about haha), fixed the problem for me!"
berkeley,fpjbs63,t3_gdrr2x,1588662871.0,"Hey OP, I am so sorry to hear this!! I know how hard it is, I just turned it in myself. The deduction per hour isnt too bad as the comment above mentioned, if you would like, please pm me and maybe we can talk some ideas over? Sometimes it only takes a couple of very small fixes to get the code to work. This is not the end of the world, we can work thru it together! and happy late birthday!

Edit to add: how are you debugging? Have you tried copying the tests from grad scope and running them locally? That way you can step thru to see what‚Äôs going on in the debugger which helped me tremendously when debugging. Best luck!"

berkeley,fp9cxnv,t1_fp92f7h,1588422656.0,Agreed. I feel like for me signpost felt really difficult somehow but maybe it was because I wasn't in the school mindset yet. So Gitlet>signpost>enigma>loa

berkeley,foswkn8,t3_g9avi4,1588039547.0,"Good points and I really really appreciate this! I was always an A+ student in high school and after coming to cal I‚Äôve been a B student this time around and I‚Äôm experimenting with a lot of different things to improve and adjust myself for college. This is so helpful, thank you!"
berkeley,forndkn,t3_g97621,1588015164.0,"I was in your position 2 days ago and I‚Äôve made it beyond the check point by now so you can do it!!! Start with the videos, and I remember in videos 3 and 4 there‚Äôs actual coding happening so open your IntelliJ and code along with it, should get your ideas flowing in. 

I know people say to have a design in mind already before starting, while that‚Äôs true and all good, I don‚Äôt think you need a perfect picture just yet. Know roughly what you‚Äôre doing, what classes you wanna create and what objects you should keep track of and you should be good to get started. 

I would say the hardest thing was add and commit, because that‚Äôs when you figure out and setup your whole structure. So don‚Äôt beat yourself up if those 2 seemingly simple things take longer than you would like, things get easier after those two I promise. 

Good luck! :)"

berkeley,foq6odr,t1_foq6bhy,1587984926.0,"Hmmm there might be seats reserved for freshmen. You‚Äôre not late at all, it‚Äôs just because summer enrollment starts really early for returning students. They might expand too, which usually happens every semester anyway, so sign up and get on the waitlist if you wanna take it, worst case they refund the money, but I think you‚Äôll likely get in:) hope that helps!"

berkeley,foq5lsy,t3_g8y01y,1587983840.0,"Most 61A lectures are online usually, even without this pandemic. I think with the pandemic and past semester of online instruction, I can confidently assume that 99% of what you need is online for the summer. The only think I would be concerned about is office hour, but they run like all day usually so if you can find a time that works in your time zone it shouldn‚Äôt be too big of an issue!"

I appreciate the effort by my profs but it‚Äôs just not the same üò≠
berkeley,foik9fk,t1_fohdgyl,1587788765.0,"Same. I feel like I can easily graduate in 3.5 years in my major so taking a semester off isn't that bad for me personally. I am also slightly concerned about what to do with myself in that time, idk if companies are going to be offering internships at this point and I am a little afraid that I would waste 6 months of my life doing basically nothing productive."

I am so sad about who / what I have become. and last night I just got an email from my school saying online is garenteed for the fall semester, if the situation gets better, we will have some classes return to normal. the news just pushed me to deeper lack of motivation. I wanna go back and be there to do school:("
berkeley,foe41wc,t1_fodtfqm,1587695605.0,"I don‚Äôt mean to get into this but one thing I wanna point out is that, most of the undergrads here at Berkeley didn‚Äôt sign up to go to Berkeley thinking that it would be online. It‚Äôs great that for you an online education is just as good and I wish I could say the same. But for my major and classes I rely so much on talking to my professors in office hours and collaborating with classmate on projects in person etc. Speaking for myself the quality of online education is reduced. I think people are mad because of this sudden change to what we had agreed to pay for in the first place. (Like if you paid for a year of Spotify and in the middle they suddenly decide to not stream but send you the records you request. Sure the Music you get at the end is the same and you shouldn‚Äôt complaint about that, and some people might actually prefer that service, but if that‚Äôs not what you organically agreed to sign up for, it might be a little frustrating) that‚Äôs just my 2 cents and have a nice day!"

But that‚Äôs a very small sample size of just less than 10 of the people I talked to, might be wrong."

berkeley,foc8gqm,t3_g6rwvu,1587668338.0,"I said this in another tread but allow me to repeat myself here: I‚Äôm most scared of the situation where we come back to school in person in the fall thinking the virus is all over and then it makes a come back in October mixed in with the regular seasonal flu and we all panic and have to scramble home again like we did this semester.... idk how likely this would be cuz I have no background in public health, but I did read on the news that someone at CDC said a second wave is possible and even likely. Please correct me if I understand the situation wrong, but with that (potentially big) possibility in mind I really don‚Äôt know if we should resume in person school at all for the fall:("
berkeley,foc7eca,t1_foc2aiw,1587667973.0,"I‚Äôm also scared that if we resume in person instruction in the beginning of fall semester, and the virus comes back with flu season before we figure out treatment or vaccine and we all have to leave again like this semester.

berkeley,foan7ce,t3_g673ht,1587649515.0,"I feel like just as the online school ""trend"" that once started in one university would end up being implemented in all univeristies in the country, this might be the situation for the Uc's as well? Especially given the proximity to Berkeley."
AskReddit,foam94t,t3_g6hu69,1587649069.0,"might be controversial but I honestly kind of hate my country's reputation, like I am not saying the gov gets everything right, and there are definitely a ton of things that I think would need to improve, I definitely feel like some media can just turn everything about this country into a ""huh, look how horrible they are"" and it just seems like there can be nothing right about it. sometimes the double standard really irritates me as a person living aboard and sees things in both countries and sometimes I even wish to be from a country that's small and irrelevant so I am not subject to this whole political tug of war."

I have been in Asia for a while and this is my observation: In mainland China schools used to teach British like in my parents generation, and recently more mixed because of the popularity of American TV etc. In Taiwan however, it is mostly American all the way, so is South Korea. I heard that in North Korea they're only allowed to study British English though. So I guess politics and relationships between the countries matter too in this regard."
