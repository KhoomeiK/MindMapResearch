codinginterview,foo99vm,t3_g8gcf2,1587934980.0,"TLDR: you’re doing this wrong, here’s a question I got at google and how I used BacktobackSWE and leetcode to solve it.



You’re missing the whole point. You need to develop algorithmic problem solving skills. You MAY get a question that you’ve seen before on a Google interview, but it’s unlikely. I’ve done hundreds of leetcode and I can tell you that I’ve never seen the exact same question I studied on an actual interview. 

This is because interview questions BUILD OFF of concepts that you need to have solidified in your tool belt. On top of that, you often get a word problem and need to translate that into a problem you’ve seen before. 

Example from a recent interview of mine at google:


You’re a bank robber and you want to figure out how to unlock the safe. The safe is the type of lock that has many of those scrollable inputs. You know, when you lock your bike, some locks have 5 scrollable inputs with 0-9 on each scroll so that you can can input a password such as “12345”.

This lock has n slots and each slot only has 0 and 1 as an option. As a result, you can only have passwords like “001010101”.

When you get to the bank, the lock will be in a certain state. For example, say n = 3, an employee could have left it at “000” or “010”. 

Suppose you know the answer state. That is, you know the state that will open the lock. Say it’s “111”.

You can only change one slot of the lock at a time. That is, you can go from “000” to “001” BUT NOT “011” because that would require moving two slots. You can however do “000”->“001”->“011”.

Finally, there’s a list of “safe” intermediate states that you’re allowed to be in so that the bank’s alarm doesn’t go off. You know what these states are.

For example,
Starting state = “000”
Ending state = “011”

list of safe intermediates = “010”, “001”, “100”


Your goal is to take these 3 inputs and determine whether or not it is possible to reach the ending state given the starting state and the possible intermediate states. Remember that you can only change 1 bit at a time.


ANSWER:

I had never seen this problem before. After the interview, I looked it up and couldn’t find it online.

Here’s how I solved it using the basics I was taught through leetcode and BacktobackSWE.

The first thing I did was boil the problem down to something more technical, because that’s what I’m used to.

Basically, given a starting string of bits, reach the ending sting of bits by moving one bit at a time. 

The catch is that you have to make sure every intermediate step is in the list of safe intermediate states. 

Ex) “000”->“011”
Safe = [“001”, “010”]

Here I can do “000”->“001”->“011”

The naive solution is to list out every possible way to reach the goal state, and then checking to see if every intermediate state is within the list of safe states. 


I recognized that this makes a good BFS problem.  You can expand a state only if you haven’t seen this state before and if it’s in the list of acceptable states. 

This makes the time reliant on n, the size of the strings, and m, the number of possible intermediate steps in the list. 

O(nm) because for each possible string O(m), you have to consider its mutation which takes O(n). So you multiply them. 


Here’s where those “BS” youtubers came through.

I practiced by watching BacktobackSWE. He prepared me for BFS. He helped me have the code ready to go whenever I see a BFS problem. I don’t even have to think about how to solve BFS anymore, I have the code memorized. 

This helped me save ample time on the interview. Interviews at google are often a time crunch. My recruiter told me that that’s usually people’s biggest problem — time is important. 

Anyway I got great feedback for this question."
