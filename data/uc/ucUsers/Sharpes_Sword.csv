movies,fp51xuo,t3_g7kg85,1588313715.0,I just watched this tonight! Great film! Felt like watching an intimate character-focused theater play and was very Shakespearean in ts tragedy.
Blackfellas,fp1465k,t3_gammo9,1588223917.0,"White kid at school back in the day would hold up black kids in the bathroom, including me with what he said was a gun. Nobody ever found a real one though. I didn't make the connection until later that he was probably racist since all his victims were black men."

UCSC,fosqmj1,t3_g9aobw,1588036031.0,"dang it, im in same spot. Lowkey hoping for online fall so I don't have to deal with possibly not having housing."
UCSC,forkvaa,t1_fonyuqm,1588013937.0,"I think you will be given on-campus housing at least your first year at UCSC. I think you'll be able to choose your roommates at the same time everyone else does too. Or if you dont have anyone specific in mind, then you fill out your application that states your lifestyle choices and they try to matchyou up with someone with similar stats."

introvert,fo5qr6e,t3_g5ghe3,1587532806.0,Beastars has a male introvert protagonist but its second main character is a female introvert. I found both characters oddly relatable. The plot is very romantic-based but has a lot of other interesting stuff going on too like mystery elements.

Blackfellas,fn95epl,t3_g00g52,1586760021.0,Took me until I was 18 to realize that a lot of those comments were really demeaning to me. I had been getting them all my life and did not like them but I just thought it was normal and just something I had to deal with.

UCSC,fn0k3a1,t3_fydnzy,1586543390.0,The pianos are pretty solid and the rooms are pretty good with the insulation. Only problem may be if someone is yelling in the hallway you can hear them.
UCSC,fmtnjl7,t3_fwwefe,1586375792.0,I can see my (old) residence hall from here!
UCSC,fmrg0dw,t3_fwyi5c,1586322101.0,The big animals are aight. Honestly its Spring time with the insects. I am generally comfortable with all animals but having 100s of insects in my bathroom at midnight....that tested my toleration.

Blackfellas,fmpwcbk,t3_fwg7ci,1586288531.0,Growing up playing multi-player games that were rife with these issues just kind of de-sensitized me to it. I'll even hear the same stuff in real life and not think much of it because Im so used to it.
