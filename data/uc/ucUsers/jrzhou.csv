berkeley,fp8eal7,t1_fp8dh2o,1588390135.0,"We found ours on Craigslist so you may also check on that. One caveat is to always check out the place **IN PERSON**. By that I mean virtual Skype tour or asking someone you know to check on the location. Although because of the virus the latter is gonna be difficult.

Oh and in terms of location, I strongly recommend west/downtown Berkeley. Much safer than the south, and not as hilly as the north.

My roommates and I started searching pretty late like mid July, so you can still find housing by then. But it‚Äôs never too early to start looking. I think May-June could be the best time?"
berkeley,fp8cy43,t1_fp8clkj,1588389199.0,"It's 2B1B with a huge living room plus balcony, so there're 3 ppl living in the apartment and we split the cost 3-ways. Nonetheless, it's quite cheap compared with other places, and quality is also good (even comes with a swimming pool lol)"

immigration,fo5ktvv,t1_fo5jw0e,1587528127.0,Me too (but this time on other things)
immigration,fo34w2a,t1_fo31i90,1587480601.0,"I actually didn‚Äôt know at that time, it‚Äôs just that I‚Äôve been using e-signatures for almost all the documents I‚Äôve signed and there‚Äôs never been an issue so I thought it‚Äôs fine üòÇfoolish me"
immigration,fo2gjyy,t1_fo2g1n2,1587461591.0,Yeah I felt really stupid üôÅI thought they couldn‚Äôt tell
immigration,fo2ezea,t3_g59n05,1587459850.0,"Same boat. What sucked even more is that my application in Feb got rejected because of electronic signature, and I had to apply in Apr again amid the virus..."
berkeley,fo2agwh,t3_g5at7r,1587455097.0,"I‚Äôm a grad student and I live in a 2B1B apartment off-campus that matches your description. Pretty ‚Äúaffordable‚Äù by Berkeley standards lol (~$900/mon for me). West side, near downtown, ~15 mins walk to campus, relatively safe, and most importantly ‚Äî VERY QUIET. I grew up in suburb and I‚Äôm pretty sensitive to light and noise, so trust me when I say this ;) My roommate is moving out because of graduation. PM me if interested!"
berkeley,fnyc0y9,t1_fnxzznh,1587358742.0,Are you hiring üòÇ
berkeley,fno8yy4,t3_g2oi42,1587116621.0,"Reading this made me kinda sad. Really feel bad for you. I admire ppl like u who both work & study. Just studying at this school itself is probably harder than many jobs. Man, I can‚Äôt imagine how it‚Äôs like to handle both.

And so sorry about your family. Similar stuff happened to mine before. I know how stressful it can be :( 

Hang in there. You sound like a really nice and hardworking individual. Good things will happen to you, just give it some time ‚òÄÔ∏è"
