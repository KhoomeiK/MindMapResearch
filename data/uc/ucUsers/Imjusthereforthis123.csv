berkeley,foopkv7,t3_g8otf6,1587943773.0,I'm so sorry. Have you thought of making a Go Fund Me? I'm sure people would be happy to help out!
berkeley,fomc8i4,t3_g85fi5,1587884890.0,I'm in a really similar situation (looking at 2 As and a B) and I'm taking P/NP since I don't want to cherry pick and this semester would hurt my GPA
berkeley,fo65a9r,t3_g5rl6l,1587547028.0,"I found it to be a pretty easy A, but I know a lot of people thought grading was unfair.  My advice would be to take advantage of office hours (both the GSIs and the Romers are really helpful, and the Romers' office hours are almost discussion style so you don't need to come with a questionâ€“just show up and pay attention) and write down every detail of your thought process for problem sets and exams.  As long as you pay attention in class you should be able to do well, they really want everyone to succeed and they're great teachers!"
berkeley,fo5q7jv,t1_fo5q0kz,1587532349.0,"No, it's problem sets and exams"
berkeley,fnqjd3t,t1_fnqf840,1587165775.0,"I don't think it's too important, the class is 90% regressions and proofs, very little econ"
berkeley,fnpfave,t3_g34cml,1587144496.0,Data 100 and econ 140
berkeley,fngiknv,t1_fngdx04,1586933371.0,"The workload isn't too bad, most of the problem sets are directly from the lecture slides and office hours are really helpful.  I didn't find the class too difficult, but I know others found the grading to be tough.  My advice is to write absolutely every part of your thought process down on problem sets and midterms, and go to office hours! The Romers are awesome, and definitely worth getting to know"
berkeley,fngaxmq,t3_g1ffys,1586926836.0,"Econ 2 is an amazing class, and the Romers are probably the best professors I've had at Berkeley. Definitely recommend!"
berkeley,fncokw8,t1_fnbqww1,1586842310.0,"I took it my first semester and it isn't the easiest AC (I'd probably go with ESPM 50AC for that) but Lunine is an amazing professor who really pushed you to think about history and social issues in the bay area, which was really interesting for a bay area native like me! As for the workload, you can definitely get away with skimming the readings each week, since almost everything is covered in lecture"

berkeley,fn1w97f,t3_fysjdu,1586571623.0,"Econ 2 with the Romers is amazing! It's a really great class and the GSIs and professors offer lots of support. Definitely go to the Romers' office hours and get to know them, they're the reason I chose to major in econ!"
berkeley,fmpm2qn,t3_fwoywx,1586283250.0,"I'm really happy about it.  This semester was my most stressful yet and guaranteed to drop my GPA, not to mention that I'm having a super hard time focusing online, so it's a huge relief.  I'm still working and trying to keep up with my classes, but it really takes the pressure off!"
berkeley,fm4vegg,t3_ft2x7d,1585761528.0,"Data 8 is definitely an easier class than math 54, so I'd take it with your harder semester"
