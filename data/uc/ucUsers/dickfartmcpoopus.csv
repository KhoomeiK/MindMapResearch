apparently the french word, *baveuse*, describes a runny texture, and can also mean 'slobbery' in french

didn't read anything about dogs tho

kinda funny too, cuz the classic french omelette is baveuse inside, so the word clearly doesn't carry any sort of negative connotation"

op, the sooner you rid yourself of incel ideology, the better. it's the last thing you want to associate yourself with, seriously."
berkeley,foosn7f,t1_fooqmca,1587945611.0,"> Maybe try being a nice person, and stop making girls out to be such awful creatures in your head then maybe, just maybe, one will see you as a nice guy who she can be friends with and maybe develop into a romantic relationship one day.

don't do this

edit: bring on the downvotes, but this is exactly how nice guyâ„¢ incels are made, by telling them 'just be nice, lounge around in the friendzone, and maybe one day she'll love you back'. general consensus is that guys who use faux friendship like this are the true scumbags."
