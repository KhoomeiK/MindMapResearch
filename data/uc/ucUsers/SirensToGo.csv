You can still include a sequence like <!---><!--><!-- --> in your entitlements and it will go through, but try and sneak anything in between those comments, and AMFI will tear your process to shreds and report to syslog:

While this is a solution, I'm not sure *why* they picked this.

If the problem is then accounted for by scaling, no real extra harm has been done by such a pathological question.

Students who cheat and look up an answer using an answer service, however, get absolutely railroaded because there is zero chance they generated a free response answer to an impossible question which just so happened to be the solution that was posted to Chegg.

If you have backend resources only an upgraded user should be able to access, you could simply have your app send the receipt alongside the request to testify that they have the upgrade (which you would then verify on your backend). If you end up needing to make a lot of these requests and think verifying the receipt each time would be too computationally expensive, you could create a `/verifyReceipt` endpoint issue a cryptographic token (JWT?) which represents a valid receipt to your server. This would mean that on each upgraded request the app would just include the token and then be granted access. 

This (I believe) would solve your issue as receipt validity is no longer tied to your account system at all but instead is a secondary, separate piece of information required to grant access to other resources."
