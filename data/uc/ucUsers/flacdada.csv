I just closed my hood and let the pump take the oxygen out."

UCSantaBarbara,fnjokoj,t3_g232hp,1587003410.0,"I lived in SC for 2 years as an undergrad.

1) it’s sizable for 2 people small for 4 but it has what you need to cook.

2) bathrooms are quite nice imo. Shower head water pressure is low but that’s the case across iv I think.

3) it is off campus enough to feel like it’s in a distinct location. And honestly I think the location is nicely tucked away from iv and main campus enough to be super nice and quiet.

4) 20s to 30s. Grad students and undergrads though undergrads are either in special circumstances like me (being transgender) or veterans/non traditional students who are in their later 20s.

5) the room size, low cost and The fact that the university manages the property and keeps it well kept in all aspects. 

6) shitty water pressure? LMAO I loved it!!

7) it can be. There are plenty of activities in the SC center and you can always knock on your neighbors door. You also will know others who live there because most first year grad students choose to be there anyways so you can ask around. Thing is, UCSB is a social school and the option to opt out of the chaos of the whole iv and campus area is dank to me. I think you’ll appreciate it. Keep in mind I was an introvert and just wanted a nice quiet place to live and study and it fitted that bill perfectly. I had no friends and I wasn’t particularly minded by that at all. I had a room facing the ball fields and I had a nice huge desk to study."

Dear UCSB students,


Your health is our highest priority. As we continue to monitor the situation of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have decided to give a fuck for once and shutdown for the Spring quarter. 
 
In order to continue to provide our shitty services we have decided to launch some virtual events on how to not give a fuck and how to not give a shit. We hope that these classes will continue to help you in your academic studies in not giving a shit on your shitty zoom lectures. 

Please stay healthy,
Sincerely,
The Staff in the UCSB office of not giving a fuck."
