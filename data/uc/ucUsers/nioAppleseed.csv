I would highly recommend checking your credit report and score (ideally FICO) with specifically TU (TransUnion).  This way, you can know exactly the data that GS is going by."

Also, EX is not shown on most monitoring services due them restricting their data sharing, especially because \*they are used the most.\*"

AppleCard,fmrnabo,t3_fx0x84,1586328595.0,"Most [decent] credit cards are paid by end of *Billing Period + Grace Period*.  Apple Card’s Billing Period ends at the end of each calendar month (when the statement is created), and Due Date by end of next month.

As for how much you’ll need to pay, it depends on when and how much your transactions grew your balance. Stuff bought right now (April 2020) won’t have a minimum due til next month (May). Having an existing balance from earlier (March and before) will require a minimum due by end of this month. Therefore the “2 months” is for stuff from March not paid *in full* leading to a minimum due by end of April.

My advice: ALWAYS PAY IN FULL, as much as possible

As for credit reporting, I only am getting TU rn. EQ and EX are [reportedly] coming later in the year"
