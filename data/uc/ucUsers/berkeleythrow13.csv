GaySnapchat,fnxfijj,t1_fnxfgvu,1587337566.0,It’s the weekend and quarantine  chill bro
berkeley,fns1zyd,t1_fns1ovh,1587210055.0,Don’t take my “don’t live on north side” Statement lightly. That place is lonely and depressing and far from everything
berkeley,fns1gmy,t3_g3dnp2,1587209542.0,Make sure to try la burrita Also don’t live on north side
berkeley,fnqp2aw,t3_g2nwni,1587169122.0,"Berkeley doesn't really enforce course pre-reqs, so you can basically take any class whenever you want, for the most part. I was taking upper divs my second semester here"
berkeley,fnqovp3,t1_fnnfx83,1587169009.0,"Agreed. The only thing I would like to add is that if you have programming experience BUT have a lot of trouble with math, you will struggle quite a bit near the last third of the semester. I had taken 61ABC70 and 188 so I had plenty of experience, but the multivariable stuff and statistical modeling they threw at us, that I  was not ready  for"
berkeley,fnqokmh,t1_fnqohxq,1587168817.0,Take 61A/B or learn the material and try for a SWE internship. I know people who have done that before
berkeley,fnqohxq,t3_g2oi42,1587168772.0,"Even if you were in Berkeley, there is a hiring freeze so you wouldn't get hired anyway"
berkeley,fnqoaro,t3_g3a0of,1587168652.0,"As far as I know, you will be paid to an extent if you meet certain criteria"
berkeley,fnqo9on,t1_fnqhlpd,1587168633.0,There is a hiring freeze so no
berkeley,fnqn6e3,t3_g2856a,1587167993.0,"CS Minor here. Never even declared it because I forgot, so I guess I don't even have that title.

1. You don't need a degree to be a SWE. It \*might\* affect your job prospects somehow but that will be dependent on grades and personal projects. They (we? wow its we now) look for experience over some title. I have now been a software engineer for 2 years.
2. Yes
3. Correct, but there is a GPA requirement for it, too (at least when I was there). You'd be shocked to find that some people couldn't maintain a 2.0 soooo

Classes I took: 61ABC, 70, 100, 161, 162, 168, 170, 188, iOS Programming"
DadsGoneWild,fmxq4hz,t1_fmxprb0,1586469707.0,I’m actually interested. Can I hit you up?
DadsGoneWild,fmxp0l3,t3_fxwyqf,1586469116.0,Hope I look like this when I’m 40
DadsGoneWild,flprl1n,t3_fq2y1q,1585366858.0,My jaw literally just dropped oh lordddd
