If your grade suffers, make sure to email them to ask if you could complete some extra credit or some new assignment or something else. It’s good that your professor is open to accommodation, just make sure to specify what you’re willing to do if push comes to shove. Good luck!"
ucr,fp03d6g,t3_gajciq,1588201722.0,"You should let your professor know that’s what was going on! It’s important to try to make sure your professors don’t penalize you for things outside your control. You deserve the grade you worked for, not a grade that’s contingent on an unstable environment. I’m sorry you went through that :("
AskReddit,fn0k2u8,t1_fn0icci,1586543384.0,"Okay, you need to relax. I am not insulting you. Do not insult me. Let me break this down for you. Sikhism has Bhagat’s that believed in Islam. Sikhism had Gurus that travelled the world to understand world religion and to incorporate those religions within our holy book. That’s why we have elements from other world religions, not just Hinduism. I’m not saying Sikh is an abrahamic religion, but it does take reference from scholars that believed in those religions. Hinduism, like how I’ve BEEN saying, should not be called a parent religion. We share elements, but Sikhs do not want to be considered members of a denomination completely contingent on Hinduism. Yes, it is a Dharmic religion, but that was not what was said in the post I replied to. It takes influence from several texts. 

Sikhs have a history with Hindu radicals that make it difficult for us to ascribe to anything that assumes a direct spiritual relationship with Hinduism. How can I call my religion the child of another religion wherein people abused my people? Extremists have soiled the link. On an emotional level, it is difficult. Please respect that. 

Theology is subjective, although we do not have to disagree that Sikhism shows elements of monotheism more than it does the opposite, which is more evident within Hinduism. However, if you’ve read Shri Guru Granth Sahib, I ask you, do you really think it’s similar to Hindu theology? Because I do not think so. Many scholars agree with me. Please google Sikh scholars and their opinions on the relationships between Hinduism and Sikhism. I suggest Pashaura Singh. 

I asked you to have this conversation in the DM’s because I believe we could be respectful to the OP. Apparently, you cannot be. We’re done with the conversation. I will no longer be replying to you. If you want to prove a point, you do not do it by being disrespectful."

AskReddit,fn0gk2p,t1_fn0e4zf,1586541537.0,"I studied as a student of religion in India (Punjab) for three years during high school. I know much about Hinduism and I think it’s incredibly beautiful and vibrant religion. I don’t believe in ascribing flaws to religion or religious text. As a Sikh, I hold no ill will to any people of any denomination. I don’t hold Islam in contempt, nor do I hold its people. I don’t hold ill will of Hindus either. That’s not what I was put on Earth to do. I don’t believe those religions are wrong. However, like how I cannot deny the terrible effect Islamic colonialism has had on my people, I also cannot deny that Hindu extremists have denied my people liberty and freedom. Neither can I deny the roots of Sikhism, wherein the Gurus sought to alleviate some of the harsher circumstances of inequality mingled throughout Hindu text. Now, many Hindus do not ascribe to the caste system, that is true. But the geopolitics of the caste system are still poignant within and around India. It’s difficult as a Sikh to emotionally be associated a religion that other people, wrong and cruel people, have used to hurt us. 

I’m not saying Sikhism does not take influence from Hinduism. I’m not saying Indic religions are not intertwined. Please understand. I’m saying Hinduism should not be considered the parent religion as Sikhism draws influence from elements of several religions, including Islam (ex. Bhagat Kabir). I’m saying Sikhism is an independent religion that does not need to be associated with other religions that have instituted genocide on its people. I don’t want to be associated with Islam either. Additionally, Ek Onkar means there is One God, and most Sikhs assume that to be a divergence from Hindu text. 

Please, if you do want to have this conversation with me, I would be more than happy to in DM’s. I love theology and I appreciate theological debate. However, I believe that by speaking about the controversial nature of this debate in public, we’re taking away from the positivity of the original post."
AskReddit,fn0f98v,t1_fn0afx4,1586540860.0,"I’m talking about Hindu nationals, the ones that explicitly participated or excused Operation Blue Star. I know that many Hindus have no ill will regarding Sikh people. However, extremists, regardless of religious association, are always dangerous."
AskReddit,fn07s94,t1_fmzl80n,1586536970.0,"Hinduism is not the parent philosophy of Sikhism. Sikhism denounces the caste system and other systematic structures that oppose equality which are emblematic in Hinduism. Sikhism has some influence from Hindu philosophers, that is true, but it also has influence from Islamic and Christian teachings too. You wouldn’t necessarily call Judaism the parent philosophy of Christianity, although I would argue that Judaism has more in similar to Christianity than Sikhism does to Hinduism. Associating Sikhism with Hinduism is also especially problematic, as Hindu nationals in the recent years have shown incredibly sikhphobic behaviors, including genocide. They are two separate, almost completely different religious denominations

Edit: I said Hindu NATIONALS. The same that, as I said in another comment, excuse or participated in Operation Blue Star."

ucr,fl6drtc,t1_fl63l3k,1584864258.0,"Thank you so much! My exam was not open-book unfortunately. I think I’ll let her know that the app may have been running when I wasn’t using the iPad- I am positive that there has to be evidence that I didn’t touch the iPad when I was taking the exam since I have exam anxiety as it is, and I was too scared to look away from the exam. I’m not sure where to find proof :("
