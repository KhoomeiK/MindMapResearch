People don't want to help other people which they can't see/hear a lot of similarities with. Even though that may seem racist/sexist/agist/etc. that's the truth for competitive places like EECS in Berkeley.

Since I'm a graduating senior still having similar problems to you, unfortunately, I don't have any good suggestions..."
berkeley,fopgz9y,t1_foik9fk,1587961240.0,"there are few online internships but don't be sad if none of them works out. if you really wanna do something important, here are some suggestions:

&#x200B;

contact really small startups(from skydeck or anywhere else) and ask them how you can help them remote. most will not be willing to pay you but that would be a great experience. 

take free courses from websites like udemy, you can even get a certificate for it for something like 100$

&#x200B;

start studying some of your spring classes during fall, you would get higher grades or take more courses since you basically know a lot about one of those courses."
berkeley,fohdgyl,t1_foe1r77,1587764120.0,"I believe a lot of students will defer their enrollment or take a gap semester. I really think that all majors(expect five-year ones) can be completed in 3.5 years and you can also always take a summer class for only 2k.  I really don't think Berkeley's (actually nobody's) online education would be worth 20k . 

There is a reason why Berkeley's masters in data science program is considered shitty by many students. It's the same classes taught by the same skilled profs, but it's fully online so it's certainly much easier to get in(since they can enroll more students) and definitely less reputable than masters in engineering. You shouldn't pay that much money for any online program, even something like a masters in data science at Berkeley."
berkeley,focu5a9,t1_focttwk,1587675911.0,and you can't force some students not to come. you either cancel it for everyone or give the option to everybody to attend. second option would need to ensure 40 thousand students from 100+ countries to be not sick. What are the odds....
berkeley,focttwk,t1_foc8gqm,1587675783.0,"you are right, and I don't think schools like UC Berkeley would risk this even if majority of schools are. So the chance of canceling in-person classes is much higher than what many people are thinking(I would say 90+%). It's good to be optimistic but you cannot risk even a single student."
berkeley,flxnjdy,t3_frrta3,1585586318.0,tell that to my prof lol
