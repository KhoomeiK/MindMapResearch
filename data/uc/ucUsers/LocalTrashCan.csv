fanart,fploqle,t3_ge79kv,1588716592.0,"Source is me. I drew this on my phone (Galaxy Note 9) in the default S Notes app. 

I wanted to draw 3 females and 3 males, and it turned out to be 3 anime characters and 3 video game characters. The names/franchises are in the post.

I drew Kaguya with black hair at first, but it looked weird so I changed it to my regular style of uncolored hair with shading. I only colored Phoenix's because his has that flashy highlight that I really liked.

Highkey my favorite part about how I put this together was using fonts that are either directly from the franchise or my best interpretation to what fonts I have that would match."
LifeProTips,fpeebap,t3_gcupnk,1588545852.0,"100% me. Any meaningful thing that my strict parents wanted to say went completely out the window after a 20 to 30 minute lecture about life, getting in trouble, and how I messed up. What these kinds of parents want is trust, but what they get is fear."
UCSD,fpdi7xh,t3_gcm6t5,1588527491.0,"It's especially distracting because my parents don't respect that space for learning and studying that I had back at campus. They treat my return home as if I'm taking a break this quarter when in reality, I actually have slightly more work than prior because of how my professors are compensating for the lack of participation."

(This is for the Biology department, so I'm unsure about anything else)"
dataisbeautiful,fni72mk,t3_g1sf6a,1586975082.0,"I love chocolate soooo so much, but I hate it when it's fruity. I'm in utter shock that chocolate and ORANGE is actually the most popular fruit-based combination for chocolate. That sounds like such a despicable pairing.

All things aside, this chart is super interesting!"
UCSD,fn6xcj6,t1_fn6tj3t,1586709185.0,"This, I'm pretty sure. How else can students enroll in consecutive classes like CHEM 6A-C or MATH 10A-C if it didn't work like this?"
UCSD,fn6x197,t3_fznqfd,1586709012.0,"Ethernet cables, too! Spotty wifi connections will be the bane of this quarter; the least that professors can do on their end is make sure that their voice/video is stable so that the recording is stable."

ok."
