jailbreak,fpl4s7r,t1_fpjod7j,1588706362.0,doesn‚Äôt kernbypass disable tweaks in the app?
GoogleWiFi,fpjhbnq,t1_fpjab1l,1588668494.0,what kind of issues do you run jnto? and how did you set it up? i think i‚Äôll get the google wifi (not nest) if thats the case. im not sure if the nest wifi (router) will run into the same issues
jailbreak,fp5h2oi,t1_fp5h03z,1588329133.0,"https://www.reddit.com/r/jailbreak/comments/gater2/questiondiscussion_is_it_possible_to_add_this_ios/

This doesnt exactly look like a post asking to disable it."
jailbreak,fp54f16,t1_fp53hxo,1588315955.0,if it was a single framework or something very ‚Äúcompressed‚Äù. if it did something like modify the whole BT stack then that‚Äôll be a much bigger thing to ‚Äújust port‚Äù
jailbreak,fp52oz6,t3_gbc3h7,1588314389.0,there was already a request and some people talking about it
microsoft,fp4m4jz,t1_fp4faiq,1588302065.0,so you‚Äôre saying the same thing is happening to you and the notification says setting up an iPhone that isn‚Äôt yours? guess it might be a but if that‚Äôs the case
jailbreak,fp3bv4u,t1_fp27uzm,1588276603.0,i think you‚Äôre making the bold assumption that the general public can follow good hygiene and stay at home. this is kinda like uh... ‚Äúwe know someone somewhere is gonna fuck up so this is kinda like an attempt at a safety net to help out‚Äù
NintendoSwitch,fp1lpv1,t1_fp1kyfg,1588239889.0,"if it came from an official retailer i could definitely understand the confusion then. was it in-store or online? sounds like it was in-store. 

what could‚Äôve happened is someone bought it, switched out the original game with this sd card and stuck the sticker from the authentic game cart onto the sd card, then returned it and the employee handling it might‚Äôve not known any better. so a fraudulent open-box. if it was sealed the first buyer could‚Äôve resealed it or someone pulled some shit at the factory. 

if it was online, i think (not 100% sure) that walmart is kinda like ebay and amazon in the sense that walmart itself isnt the one selling the entire stock and a third party sold it to you like that"
jailbreak,fp1ekpd,t3_gahoe7,1588232904.0,"from a quick google search, it might need some changes on the homepod side (although i cant verify that bc im not too well versed in homepod specifics). i‚Äôm make that assumption because (from my google search) airplay 2, which the homepod uses, isn‚Äôt just ‚Äúsend everything that is audio to the airplay 2 device.‚Äù it sends media content like songs or movies (note the distinction). its kinda like chromecast, or samsung‚Äôs split audio (you can send audio of a specific app to a BT speaker, but everything else comes out of the phone). im guessing spoken text from shortcuts isn‚Äôt ‚Äúairplay 2 content‚Äù. bluetooth speakers (in the context of iOS) are just ‚Äúsend everything that‚Äôs audio to the speaker‚Äù.

i mean as im typing this out *maybe* you could have your device trick airplay 2 recievers into thinking shortcuts speech is airplay 2 content/anything that is audio is airplay 2 content. 

or i could be totally off who knows"
NintendoSwitch,fp1bg9u,t1_fp0rwol,1588230045.0,"i mean, to be fair I did buy a ‚Äúbeats studio3 wireless‚Äù through facebook marketplace and if i was your typical superstitious mom that believes all the news thrown around on fb i probably wouldn‚Äôt have caught on that i got scammed (literally the only 2 things I noticed were a slightly different BT device name, and no special pop-up that you get like w/ airpods. it took me a trip to the apple store for the genius to tell me the serial number was reported to be either still in or stolen from warehouse idk which and that the unfolding mechanism had too much snap to it and i probably wouldnt have caught that myself). \*

**TL;DR** point im tryna make is people can get scammed when the item in question doesn‚Äôt scream fake *to the everyday eye*. for most of us on this sub yeah sure we‚Äôd notice the difference bc we‚Äôre into the switch, but you might be assuming they‚Äôre apart of this sub (who‚Äôs to say theyre just on reddit, but active elsewhere and decided to come here for help?). it‚Äôd be like me asking you to describe the differences between Substrate and Substitute in terms of jailbreaking and 100% expecting you to know even though a pretty small niche of ppl would know that. 

\* if you‚Äôre buying off of someone that isn‚Äôt trustworthy like family or close friends 99% use paypal goods and services. venmo, cash app, paypal friends&family, etc. don‚Äôt protect the buyer in any way; s~~eller~~cammer walks away with the money and you can‚Äôt do anything to get them to send it back. it costs 3% of the purchase price but it‚Äôll cover your ass should you get fucked over

*edited bc i cant format*"
UCI,foxkrjm,t1_fox9v4i,1588147112.0,"nah i dont think that‚Äôll happen, based on the fact that uci has been on the safe side about this, and on the hope that theyre cognizant of the fact that given how absolutely terrible the US has been handling the outbreak we‚Äôre likely gonna be in a shitshow for a good while"
jailbreak,foxjncv,t1_fowqqdz,1588146082.0,"i thought these kinds of bugs don‚Äôt do that though? unless i‚Äôm mistaken one time this went around a jb dev said it doesn‚Äôt escalate privilege (or was it that specific bug he was talking about, and theoretically at some point some text could accomplish this)"
Breath_of_the_Wild,fop5bf2,t1_fooidc3,1587953406.0,that Game Theory video on youtube did a good one on Hyrule Warriors
MatebookXPro,foh6r74,t1_foerdbu,1587761154.0,Thanks a bunch! I've been kind of looking around but wasn't too sure
Coronavirus,fo63kz2,t1_fo5s9wi,1587545209.0,it took me a minute to understand what that meant and holy fuck that hurt
Android,fo61r06,t1_fo61dr5,1587543265.0,"i understand what you mean but i wouldn‚Äôt really consider twitter just because you‚Äôd need to be following all the devs and eventually follow more as new devs enter the scene, vs. reddit where you go to reddit for a sort of collection of all the jb stuff in one place (although i dont like following people on social media that aren‚Äôt actual people i know or mutuals/mixing the jb scene with a more more social aspect of my life + people who ask about stupid shit like a jailbreak for a currently unjailbreakable version/hard-to-implement festures so maybe my perspective is skewed)"
Android,fo5wwd4,t1_fo5o2yc,1587538370.0,"LMAOOOOOOOOOOOO nah that sub is a literal fucking garbage dumpster. devs (both tweak and jb devs) have drama like... what feels like every other day, people are trying to justify piracy (backed up by some devs have mentioned that a significant amount of their users installed the tweak from a cracked repo), and its probably one of the worst subs I frequent. upcoming tweak/jailbreak exploits are cool but the fact that its the ‚Äúmain‚Äù hub for jailbreak-related things is kinda disappointing (where xda exists for android)"
Android,fnpu0ko,t1_fnptvv4,1587151982.0,"for you, me, and most of Reddit yeah sure. but it‚Äôs still time consuming, and for the 99% of Android users out there it‚Äôs a PITA"
Android,fnptob0,t1_fnpr7d4,1587151803.0,"while i do feel like he is being a little strong on his word choice, it does suck that Google hasn‚Äôt implemented something like what Apple does (I don‚Äôt personally use backups for iOS, but I believe the gist is that when you get a new phone and restore it from your last phone‚Äôs backup, everything is already there (including app data)) after all this time.

you don‚Äôt need to trust app developers to implement it, because the OS takes care of all of it, which in turn leads to a better user experience"
jailbreak,fnproq8,t1_fnpazhl,1587150761.0,"yeah i really dont get the purpose of these. dark mode, *maybe*, but all the private saving of photos and shit hella whack. this like middle school mentality lmao"
microsoft,fnpqv3b,t1_fnpp2jb,1587150329.0,genuine question what are some good use cases for that? i only really use ssh its probably not something ideal for this (but im also a student still so im sure theres a lot of places where this would be useful)

pokemon,fnbn27c,t1_fnbn0lv,1586818469.0,ahhh interesting
pokemon,fnbmtuh,t1_fnbmju7,1586818350.0,"isn‚Äôt it because the firmware that runs GBA didn‚Äôt know how to properly handle certain kinds of save files (like Gen 3 games), because for a while it seemed like those games didn‚Äôt work on VC until the person behind the injector program fixed it"
pokemon,fnbmmpx,t1_fnblhcv,1586818247.0,ahhh thats what it was. i wasnt 100% sure and didn‚Äôt want to spout out wrong info
pokemon,fnbenag,t1_fnbcvq7,1586814180.0,"true. it is nice having everything on the SD card though, as opposed to having all the cartridges and stuff; I can use a slimmer carrying case for when I‚Äôm playing on the go.

in terms of homebrew though, compatibility is surprisingly good by injecting GBA games as a Virtual Console title (something something the 3DS has something in it that was supposed to provide support for GBA games idk the technical details), and TWiLight Menu++ (the main way of playing NDS games on homebrew) has something that takes advantage of the similarities between the structure of the NDS and GBA for a nice one-program-does-all solution. plus, with homebrew you can easily retrieve save files, and with a little work you can do transfers from Gen 3 to 4 (and single-device Gen 4 to 5 as well)."
jailbreak,fnay4om,t1_fnaxzph,1586805873.0,oh i dont know how i came to that conclusion big oof
jailbreak,fnat3ec,t3_g0ofoy,1586803344.0,RequireFull possibly? idk if its updated for iOS 13 though. i think BetterMultitasking has some other features aside from just enabling SlideView on all apps so that might be worth a shot.
jailbreak,fnastuv,t1_fna0jet,1586803211.0,"for anyone who comes across this later you need to drag the icon to the waves at the bottom, not tap them. literally took me like a day or two until I realized this"
