investing,fo34085,t3_g53z9h,1587480125.0,"One problem I have with this actually, even if retail investors couldn't speculate on futures by the last week, there *was* still speculation going on: the ETF USO was still holding 25% of all outstanding May 20 futures right up until the end. With that many futures to sell and the generally small volume by the last week, a large part of the disastrous prices yesterday could be attributed to them trying liquidate. That makes yesterday a financial distortion, and they paint a gloomier picture for oil in general that is really warranted. Not saying there wasn't a signal then, but I don't think a dire future is guaranteed yet.

RobinHood,fnqcgfr,t1_fnq59je,1587161918.0,"Didn't XOP *also* just reverse split? They're also the ETF for oil exploration, and that's the riskiest sector of all oil business right now. I'd rather put money in the more general oil ETFs like VDE."
RobinHood,fnpboau,t1_fnoqzay,1587142675.0,"Estimates of when the earnings reports are released? No, these dates were previously announced. So I suppose the answer for you is totally accurate (except Amazon’s date apparently, that got pushed back but it’s already been taken off the OP).

Earnings reports are risky to bet on actually. A stock price can move up or down *big time* because of the earnings call."
