Also, dog tax!"
CasualConversation,fp9mc23,t1_fp9m24t,1588429734.0,Yes! I'm from Taiwan and the virus is almost gone! We celebrated a 6 day streak of no new cases yesterday! (we had two new cases today but they're both from abroad and already had symptoms when they were abroad)

malefashionadvice,fp203jk,t3_gad7es,1588252240.0,"I want to buy my boyfriend a nice backpack for his birthday. We are both college students but I would love it if he can continue to use the backpack after he graduates. We go to school in LA. My budget is around $50. If that is not enough money to buy a nice, solid backpack, what other gifts would you guys recommend?

He has a Jansport currently and it's pretty new (a couple months) but one of the straps is coming loose"
dankmemes,foyr0ov,t1_foym11a,1588177579.0,"There’s a couple ways I’ve heard of professors doing it. 

- using a computer lockdown software like respondes to ensure no cheating, you have to have your webcam and microphone on

- timed open book open notes exams where they release the exam at a certain time and you have to submit it by a certain time, usually a couple hours

- or no exams, converting them into projects or papers

Important to note that many professors make exams and quizzes way harder to combat cheating and collaboration."

ucla,fo69o3l,t1_fo63m0r,1587551764.0,"FYI, there’s no difference between out of state tuition and international student tuition. They’re both considered out of state and therefore pay the same tuition."
ucla,fo69liv,t3_g5wkgc,1587551688.0,"The huge difference in summer sessions tuition and regular tuition is because there is no out of state tuition during summer. They charge out of state tuition because us out of state people don’t pay taxes in California.

Also, I’m pretty sure the majority of tuition UCLA receives goes towards research, not paying the staff and maintaining campus. UCLA is a research university."

femalefashionadvice,fnzmz2w,t1_fnzlh86,1587397126.0,I’ve bought from them once and honestly I rly liked what I got. I got a plaid skirt that was actually rly high quality and still my fav. A couple of polyester tops that weren’t super high quality but they were cute and great for going to the beach in. Everything fit perfectly.

ucla,fns57y3,t3_g3kuno,1587213018.0,"Actually, it is somewhat difficult to switch out of a dorm room. The easiest way is during the first or second week of winter and spring quarter there are room swap events where if you find someone willing to swap rooms with you you can do that. 

Otherwise you would have to go through your RA and it would have to be really bad, like your roommate assaulted you bad, to be forcibly moved out of your room. 

For your specific problem though, you and your roommates have mandatory roommate contract meetings with your RAs in the beginning of the school year, and if your roommate violates the contract you can take it up to the RA and they can do something about it. And if it gets bad enough one of you might be removed. I’ve never heard of anyone having your problem though."

femalefashionadvice,fnjkxy4,t1_fnj5jss,1587001144.0,Apparently in the early seasons they would often steal clothes from the costume department for personal use. The costume department was not happy.

UpliftingNews,fncsbjk,t1_fnch8lu,1586845591.0,A lot of families watch tv together at meal times and even if they don’t watch the press conferences themselves the news would cover it constantly

worldnews,fn3hufx,t1_fn3fw5m,1586621042.0,"Ohh okay sorry I was confused about your comment. That’s makes sense. 

Honestly this is the wrong time for governments and administrations to be playing the blame game. Though I suppose it is hard for Taiwan to not retaliate of sorts after Tedros’s allegations against Taiwan for racist comments against him."
worldnews,fn3fms1,t1_fn3eyv5,1586619757.0,"In the article you linked, they said they are unsure if it is human to human at the time, as in before they went to China. After they went to China, they received reports of more cases that are within families, and by the end of the article, they said that they believe there are human to human transmission, and that they believe the Chinese government is taking this seriously. (It’s the last paragraph)"
worldnews,fn353og,t1_fn2za96,1586613060.0,"In the press conference, the head of the CDC said that for health professionals and especially the WHO, that should be enough for them to launch an investigation, which they did not do. I think this is what they meant by the WHO ignoring Taiwan’s warnings, that the WHO didn’t do anything such as launching an investigation, or even reply to the email. 

They main outrageous thing of this whole situation is Tedros, in a press conference, condemning Taiwan for alleged racist attacks since 3 months ago, with no proof whatsoever. Not to mention 3 months ago Taiwan was going through an election and literally nobody knew who Tedros was."
worldnews,fn33x51,t1_fn31sbp,1586612198.0,"The argument made in the press conference is that any health professional, which the WHO certainly should be, should be able to discern from the language that there is a possibility of human to human transmission due to the fact that they have placed patients under isolation. I’ve heard ppl use the analogy of IT officials thinking security breach when they hear of possible vulnerabilities. Basically a correlation most laymen would not jump to. And this email was certainly not meant to be read by the general public, it was not written to be easy to understand for the non professionals because it is not a press release. 

Taiwan didn’t have enough information to prove for certain that there are human to human transmission, and was asking the WHO for more information and to launch an investigation, which they did not do. It is important to note that Taiwan is not only not a member of the WHO but was also stripped of observation rights years ago, so they were not obligated to inform the WHO of anything."
worldnews,fn32zh9,t1_fn32he0,1586611499.0,The majority of cases in Taiwan are also from people returning to the country from abroad. There have only been a handful of community spread cases.
