ShouldIbuythisgame,fpdngvk,t1_fpddy4n,1588530467.0,Awesome.  Thanks so much!
ShouldIbuythisgame,fpdnfpm,t1_fpdiuch,1588530449.0,"Hmm, ok.  I’ll check it out.  It’s rare to find a game that I’ve literally never even heard of, so I’m excited.  Thanks so much!"
ShouldIbuythisgame,fpc840l,t1_fpc4xme,1588490838.0,Elex?
ShouldIbuythisgame,fpbphdp,t1_fpbb2h1,1588475480.0,Is it necessary (or strongly recommended) to play the first before the second?
ShouldIbuythisgame,fpbp89r,t1_fpbewzq,1588475307.0,"I just started playing AC Odyssey again because the DLC went on sale.  Can’t stop myself from playing through the whole game, rather then just b-lining for the DLC.  I’ve tried for honor, and for some reason it just doesn’t do it for me."
ShouldIbuythisgame,fpb93xl,t1_fpabbw4,1588464753.0,Ah!  Forgot to mention I already played that.  I’ve gone through so many games it’s difficult to remember them all when you try and actually sit down and lost them.
ShouldIbuythisgame,fpb91qw,t1_fpag437,1588464715.0,"Yup, played them both (shadow of war and shadow of Mordor).  Loved them.  The nemesis system was suuuuper cool.  Do you know any other games that do that?"
ShouldIbuythisgame,fpb8yde,t1_fpaloqx,1588464655.0,"Played it.  I agree, it’s underrated, but the world movement and lack of fast travel (except the main towns and wherever you put those damn crystals) kind of ruined it for me.  I’m lazy.  Also, I don’t think I ever really figured out how to level my dude correctly."
ShouldIbuythisgame,fpb8srd,t1_fpabzj4,1588464558.0,"AC saga is Assassins Creed saga.  Love those games!  Recent ones have gotten a lot of hate because the whole “assassin” pet has kind of gone out the window, but I still thoroughly enjoy each game.  Many people have said Bannerlord, so I think that may be what I’m going with next."
ShouldIbuythisgame,fpb8o82,t1_fpan72j,1588464480.0,Almost bought this at least 5 times.
ShouldIbuythisgame,fpb8mz7,t1_fpaun07,1588464459.0,"Interesting.  Ya, I’ve thought about Sekiro too, but lately I’ve been in the mood to just indiscriminately fuck  people with swords.  That being said, if Sekiro is soulsborne-adjacent then that means it will most likely be me who is getting fucked up indiscriminately lol."
ShouldIbuythisgame,fpa5yng,t1_fpa40l2,1588441486.0,"Ok, maybe I’ll try it!  Stealth isn’t a necessity."
ShouldIbuythisgame,fpa5pp9,t1_fpa38c6,1588441339.0,"Sorry, should of mentioned I played that as well (and loved it)."
berkeley,fohzqm8,t3_g7ghw3,1587775805.0,"Current transfer student here, and I couldn’t be happier.  I had amazing experiences at community college, and the personal relationships you can make with the professors there are some you never forget (not to mention it’s absurdly cheaper). I came to Berkeley last Fall, and I was a bit worried about being a community college transfer student, as in did I really “belong” here.  Some deeeeep imposter syndrome.  I have to say that whatever stigma or prejudice you may think exists for a community college transfer student is just non existent.  I’ve had nothing but incredible experiences as a transfer (not including the obviously horrible current situation).  Don’t give up!!!  Feel free to DM me if you have any questions, happy to share my experience with you."

television,fnbozq2,t1_fn3fmta,1586819501.0,"Had never heard of this show, and the first I saw it was due to the link you shared.  I’m now on series 2 and I’m so hooked.  Planning to have nice joint in the evening and an episode or 4 of taskmaster has given me something to look forward to.  Fucken love it.  Thank you so much for letting us Americans know it’s available because, just In case you are wondering, everything else is shit here."
xboxone,fn3ttf9,t3_fz0buk,1586627778.0,Super nice of you!
gaming,fmy8z22,t1_fmu1z3n,1586480710.0,"I haven’t played the first three, but was thinking about playing 4 because it’s free right now.  Is that a bad move?  Should I play the first e 3 before playing 4?  I mean I know I SHOULD, but if I don’t, is it a huge issue?"
