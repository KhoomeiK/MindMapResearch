For one, even in populations more susceptible to GI issues with influenza, vomiting and diarrhea are uncommon.

For another, the norovirus is actually the most common cause of foodborne illness (not food poisoning, that's a related but separate thing).

Also Salmonella is a bacteria, not a virus.

Also, virtually every cause of foodborne illness can be spread via the fecal-oral route, and for even those that aren't it's irrelevant to the discussion - foodborne illness is always caused by improper food handling whether the causative agent is already present in the food, gets there via cross contamination, or from improper handwashing after using the restroom.

I feel like you're either an oddly specific troll or you're just one of those goobers that half-remembers things and has an unflinching confidence in your own knowledge because every thing you said in that statement is exactly half true."
youtubehaiku,fnuaufi,t1_fnssfci,1587258126.0,"Right, we get it bud, but that's not how language works. So long as people understand that a GI virus isn't influenza it doesn't really matter what they call it.

I'm a microbiologist and I don't have a problem with this, so why are you being so pedantic?"

agedlikemilk,fn1ejr8,t1_fn0x8ue,1586560369.0,"The reason increased density doesn't necessarily correlate linearly with population density can be explained pretty well using your example.

Let's compare an eight story residential building and a 50 story one. We'll assume in both that there's the same percentage of people exhibiting the same sorts of behaviors in each that would increase the spread of disease (touching objects within the elevator, touching their face, etc.). In the first you start with one sick individual who coughs in the elevator, and over the course of a month ends up getting 60% of their apartment complex sick because everyone is using those shared spaces. In the second, we'll assume the same initial sick patient.

Given the same sorts of behaviors, we might expect it to take slightly longer for one person to infect everyone that's going to be infected in that building, but there's no reason to expect that a greater percentage would be as a result of the building having more people in it. Sure, more people overall will get infected, but the infection rate remains constant, and that's what we're talking about here. The same logic applies to a more heavily vs less heavily used public transit network.

The only time population density is of great importance is when you're going from a low-density situation (think rural countryside) to a higher density situation (think the suburbs or the 8-story apartment complex mentioned before). More chances of exposure only matters up to a certain point, and that point is much lower than most people think. The difference between NYC and rural Indiana is significant; the difference between NYC and SF is probably negligible in this context. As I mentioned, above 100 people per square mile was the point at which increased density didn't really matter during the 1918 pandemic, and that's orders of magnitude below the tens of thousands per square mile we see in pretty much any large city center today."
agedlikemilk,fmysu3h,t1_fmy2m4o,1586494721.0,"Population density doesn't scale linearly and probably reaches a point where an increased density does nothing to the overall case numbers.

I'm trying to find the publication, but an analysis of what data we have from the 1918 flu pandemic found that the saturation point for population density was around 100 people per square mile.

It's still plausible that pop. density affects the rate of spread, but again, it likely reaches a saturation point far below either city's current density."
agedlikemilk,fmysd8t,t1_fmy68c7,1586494329.0,"It does not. From research done on the 1918 flu outbreak, you don't really see much of a difference in total number of infections once you hit above about 100 people per square mile. Granted you can't make direct comparisons here, but beyond a certain population density, an increase in density doesn't seem to matter for the total number of infections.

Population density also likely affects the rate of spread, but again, you'll likely reach a density where increasing doesn't change much anymore."
