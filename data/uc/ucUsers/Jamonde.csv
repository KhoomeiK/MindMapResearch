If you choose to allow her to go to the graveyard, you can later play her for her escape cost. If she is ever exiled or otherwise leaves the graveyard, you can choose to put her in the command zone.

I think Raise the Alarm is solid for token generation, of which you will want plenty! But even something like [[Charge]] or [[Marshaling Cry]] could be great. Maybe those could go in the main deck too, as a surprise that your opponents suddenly must deal with."
oathbreaker_MtG,fpfoxbn,t3_gd1yaj,1588578263.0,"Some solid staples here!

My very first edh deck was [[Heliod, God of the Sun]], so I might recommend running that as another solid token generator/vigilance-giver, which is no laughing matter in a format so planeswalker heavy. I think there's a nice little life-gain subtheme you have with the new Heliod, but maybe including some more soul sister type cards since you're making tokens anyways, just for extra value. Cards like [[Elesh Norn]] and [[Hero of Bladehold]] and [[Linden, the Steadfast Queen]] and [[Brimaz, Kind of Oreskos]] are staples of this kind of deck and probably should stay in every version of this.

Even though you're running [[Pearl Medalion]] and [[Nyx Lotus]], I think you should consider running more lands and perhaps another manarock or two like [[Thunder Totem]] or [[Coldsteel Heart]]. There's enough 4+ CMC's you want to run (and may want to throw in) that 24 lands and maybe one more manarock could suffice. There's also a wee bit of ramp in white, such as [[Tithe]] - never hurts to keep your hand stacked with lands. Maybe cut [[Martyr for the Cause]] and [[Unruly Mob]].

[[Luminarch Ascension]] could be solid here, but definitely paints a target on your back the second it's played, if it isn't countered or immediately destroyed. I'd replace [[Captain's Call]] with [[Timely Reinforcements]] if you needed to pick, but maybe playtest one versus the other and see how it plays out.

It's a different format, but some cards I've found handy in brawl include [[Soul-Guide Lantern]], [[Field of Ruin]], and [[Blast Zone]]. The last two can be mana-intensive but can threaten opponents' stuff and keep their plays in check. The first is just, in my opinion, a better [[Tormod's Crypt]].

I used to run [[Kjeldoran Outpost]] but didn't like that it cost a land to play, but maybe you'd like it. Finally, [[Birth of Meletis]] would slot in nicely here as it helps with lots of things, as would [[Anointed Procession]] if you can afford it."
MensLib,fpfhd7s,t3_gcwdx4,1588571285.0,"Let me start with my own questions:

When you hold the door open for someone, a woman-presenting person, do you expect praise? Should you? What explicitly do you feel would be wrong with expecting praise for this? Do your initial thoughts or feelings change if the gender of the person changes?

My feeling for this relatively easy situation is that it would be better to still do the thing (that is, holding the door open) and not expect praise, with the understanding between you and yourself that doing a small but kind thing for others is a reward enough in and of itself. And depending on the context, whether or not the person thanks you is likely dependent simply on whether they're paying attention to their surroundings or not; someone in an important call may just look at you and wave, and you may miss it. Maybe they do nothing at all. Would knowing this change your expectations of receiving praise?

Let's get more specific. Let's say there's a class at your local university on some super deep feminist topic. Let's say you just happen to work nearby, but are curious. Let's say you, a man (presumably) who wants to learn what he can about being a solid ally and a great feminist, decide to enroll in it. When you get there, the class is probably mostly going to be women, and probably will be taught be a woman (as it probably should be). Now, from their perspective, you, probably being one of less than five men in the class, are maybe there just to virtue signal, or because your girlfriend told you to take it, or because it's required for your major. Maybe a few of them even think that what you are doing - going out of your way, spending your own time and resources to educate yourself on an important topic that you may not know a lot about but want to know more about to be a better ally - IS the bare minimum.

And let's take a step back. From the perspective of a left-leaning, university-educated feminist woman, taking at least a single class on feminism is probably a reasonable expectation of 'bare minimum' for their acquaintances, male or not. However, what if you're not university educated to begin with and are here for this one class? What if you are genuinely just there to learn, and are legitimately doing something that most men in our society won't even come close to? You'll probably feel great, like you're an exceptional ally and are ready and available to be the man when needed.

If they meet you with skepticism, cynicism, and/or outright hostility because you are such an unbelievable occurrence, and/or use language in a way that university educated people actively avoid and are met with these things, you'll likely feel frustrated. You'll likely feel like you should be praised for what you're doing, for how out of the way you are going to learn and be there for those around you. And... maybe, in this super constructed scenario, you'd be right. I think I'd say so. Last question then we're done with this scenario: do you think expecting praise will set you up for success or failure in this environment?

Also, look at how many variables we introduced to get here. I guess what I want to get back to is the same message I got to with the door holding situation: being a decent human being and learning to support others can be praise-worthy or the bare minimum, depending on many contexts, perspectives, and everything else. Perhaps the best option is to train ourselves to get that dopamine hit from trying to do the right thing, trying to learn more and trying to improve ourselves - and not from others' praise, which is an unreliable indication of the value of our efforts, as the latter example shows."
MensLib,fpffand,t1_fpeuujx,1588569551.0,"There's a lot I like about this response, in particular:

>The argument is that people who are complicit in systems of oppression are not decent people, and the only way not to be complicit is to dedicate a significant chunk of your energy to dismantling them. **For better or for worse, I'm not one of those people. I think if I were to dedicate a big chunk of my life to activism, there's probably a half-dozen social causes to focus on that I would put ahead of feminism, (e.g. racism, climate change, third world poverty). If I need to pour a good chunk of my heart into each of these social causes just to consider myself a decent person, then I'll probably never consider myself a decent person.**

There's a fundamental truth here that you're approaching, that up to and until it is absolutely necessary, most people will never do much 'activism' of any kind at all, let alone dedicating so much of their lives to it. And I don't blame you nor anyone who doesn't do as much as others, because life is complicated and demanding of time and attention. A LOT of people just struggle to stay alive, provide for themselves and their children, and keep their life in a positive direction. It's tough to care about some abstract-sounding ideals and concepts concerning, say, gender and bathroom usage for transgender folks, when you, some cishet white dude, are struggling to pay for rent, medical bills, and the food you're supposed to also be an activist with by buying local or eating organic or going vegan or making most of it yourself or whatever.

And with the pandemic? Shit, if I have underlying medical conditions, my attention is on myself, my safety, and how my needs will be met. As it should be. I can still care about the world and want things to get better, but time and energy are luxury resources these days, and you need a LOT of them to even get acquainted with being any kind of 'activist' at all. Not being an asshole is one thing, but actively unlearning internalized homophobia, racism, misogyny, etc. takes a lot of hard introspection and work over the course of *years.* Futhermore, if there's no immediately obvious avenue for me to unlearn some internalized whatever by having, say, friends who are LGBTQ+ or family members of different races who I can have these important but difficult conversations and learning sessions with, what is one supposed to do? Spend years and thousands of dollars on a degree in some humanities field? Spend their time watching youtube videos educating themselves on things they wouldn't even know how to look for necessarily? Maybe this latter option is the most realistic, and something we can all be doing, but I think this gets the point across.

There's a particular person I'm friends on Facebook with who consistently shares leftist and vegan ideals, memes, and content - but with teeth. What I mean is, if the particular meme is about, say, veganism, their caption will attempt to point out the subtle misogyny (if it even exists?) or whatever within the meme while still validating the general idea. The next week, it'll be about supporting women-owned businesses\* (\*but only the vegan, free-trade ones, as she'll be sure to remind you in their caption). You get the idea.

This is frustrating, because while I know they have great intentions, this emphasis on trying to acknowledge everything all the time is self-defeating and comes across as virtue-signaling. Like, we get it, you're a vegan and also want to #smashthepatriarchy or whatever combination of general left-leaning things many of us are on board, but who is going to take you seriously when you're narrowing down the acceptable ways people can meaningfully participate in living more conscientiously? The small steps matter, but if you constantly keep setting the bar and bar higher, and the 'first step' keeps getting more and more difficult and all, what is a regular person to do? If the meme is supposedly sexist in a not-always-immediately-obvious way, should I bother sharing it so that others can get the message? What if the only women-owned businesses nearby are butcher shops and franchise restaurants which aren't vegan? What if buying local, organic, or whatever other kind of food is out of my price range?

I think I went on a bit long, but I just get frustrated easily by other folks on the left. We don't do a good job of selling our ideals."
mtgbrawl,fpeb5um,t3_gcnx7q,1588544011.0,"Some of my auto-includes in most of my decks: 

[[Field of Ruin]] should go into most decks, as [[Field of the Dead]] is still occasionally a problem, and at worst it can take out a [[Castle Vantress]], [[Castle Lochthwain]] or [[Mobilized District]].

Likewise, [[Blast Zone]] is useful when you're running color combos that are lighter on removal (such as mono red). This can hit enchantments and planeswalkers, something red specifically has a hard time doing.

[[Soul-Guide Lantern]] is a solid and cheap way to threaten graveyard strategies, of which there are plenty. If you're not worried about your opponents' graveyard at all, then it can replace itself that same turn or whenever you need to.

What I've found in Brawl (as in other formats) is the following rule of thumb: the ability to have solid removal/interaction with your opponents tends to be more important than emphasizing aggressive playstyles and strong synergies, and I say this as someone with a [[Chandra, Acolyte of Flame]] deck who also wants to try Winota soon. My [[Liliana, Dreadhorde General]] deck just has so much removal and interaction that it can sometimes completely turn off powerful [[Yarok, the Desecrated]] decks and other decks strong in the meta. My [[Vivien, Monsters' Advocate]] has more staying power when I have at least two to three pieces of removal in my opening hand to deal with my opponents' early shenanigans. This has been a hard pill to swallow for me, someone who likes playing more aggressively, but it makes for better and more interesting games."
EDH,foha96l,t1_foa3i21,1587762614.0,"> If it's broken in cedh it's broken in edh

This is only true to the extent that EDH and cEDH are the same thing, which they're mostly not. cEDH has a definable meta in the sense that other competitive formats have a meta, whereas the EDH meta (if you could call it that) is really just what your playgroups play if you mainly play the tabletop version, which can vary widely from player to player. My understanding is that cEDH wincons have largely relied on LabMan-type effects in recent months, with other infinite combos not far behind. This is just not how regular EDH tends to go (admittedly in my experience). EDH and cEDH players may all be trying to have fun in their own way and may be restricted to the same banlist, but that's mostly it. As a casual player, I don't want to sit down for a game with a pod of cEDH decks, just like a cEDH player shouldn't want to sit down at a pod involving one of my playgroups unless that is the experience we have all agreed to. Because of these things, I'm convinced that EDH and cEDH are different enough that broken in one =/= broken in the other.

> Using personal experience as an example doesn't really work too well.

This is literally how we draw conclusions about things, but I digress.

> I never saw a leovold deck before it was banned despite playing almost 2 years before with multiple playgroups. But I and many others who never played vs it knew it was broken

As far as I was aware, Leovold was a problem in the larger community of EDH, hence the banning. I have no idea if he was even a thing in cEDH. I guess what I want to come back to is, this card (Flash) was banned basically because of cEDH. I'm happy that this 'fixes' things for other players, but am just concerned about the precedent this may or may not set. The RC, understandably, doesn't want to navigate trying to accommodate the competitive community because their emphasis has always been on casual play. The modes of thinking are different, and that's fine. This isn't a fault on their part. Maybe they could involve more people from the competitive community or something, but this isn't an easy fix because this is inherently a casual format."
EDH,fo9cv6q,t1_fo2gep8,1587616105.0,"Really, it seems that this ban is the direct result of pressure from the community, nothing more or less.

The connection you seem to be making is that Flash broken in cEDH => likely will soon be broken in regular EDH. As the reaction here and elsewhere, shows, Flash seems to be a mostly niche card that isn't all that broken in non-cEDH. In the roughly six or seven years I've been regularly playing EDH, I can't recall seeing it played at a casual table."

But, it really isn't obvious to me what would have alleviated yal's complaints here. The tone of this whole 'debacle' is 'please stop bothering us to ban flash, it's banned so be happy.' There could be a discussion around that, I think, but what is this 'animosity' you're talking about? The RC has never pretended to be about anything but casual commander; their lack of acknowledgement of cEDH is because it is literally not their goal to regulate it."

...have they not been clear in their statement of the [philosophy of commander?](https://mtgcommander.net/index.php/the-philosophy-of-commander/) This is a casual format. What's confusing is that cEDH players are enjoying an intentionally casual format competitively and want the intentionally casual-focused RC to represent them as well, when the RC has indicated consistently that they have no such intentions. They're also doing as much as they can to 'not reign it in' because they want to be as hands-off as possible.

> in many ways cedh is a petri dish in what are the most disgustingly broken (and therefore banworthy) cards in edh. If a card is breaking cedh in half, it could easily break edh in half if a player just decides to break rule 0 and throw it into their deck.

This was certainly true with [[Paradox Engine]] to a degree, but Flash just isn't breaking EDH the way it's breaking cEDH. And the way to break it is so specific, that you're basically constructing the cEDH deck anyways instead of merely throwing it into your 7-8 deck."

And perhaps that's the crux; cEDH players want a healthy cEDH meta, and the RC just doesn't have that goal set nearly as high of a priority as the goal of maintaining a healthy casual environment. So banning paradox and sort of durdling on Flash makes sense.
