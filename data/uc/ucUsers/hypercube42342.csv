Our first (completely hypothetical) team ended up 7 below expected, and our second team ended up 2 below expected. Although the first team lost *5* more expected territories than the second, the second result was substantially more unlucky! Using a raw absolute difference is misleading that way. I’d wager that because OSU has more expected territories every night than almost any other team, and usually a higher standard deviation in expected territories as a result (depending on the night), I’d wager they’re not actually the unluckiest team, though they are quite unlucky. Similarly, I’d guess that Stanford’s cumulative luck was better than A&M’s, because they were so small.

Anyways, I think the best metric would be the z score in total number of non unique territories controlled over the entire game compared to the sum of expected territories from every turn."

I know you can’t account for strategy or for the accumulated effects of previous rolls, but I’m not interested in those. I’m purely interested in total number of nonunique controlled territories, given the territories each team actually had coming into each round.
