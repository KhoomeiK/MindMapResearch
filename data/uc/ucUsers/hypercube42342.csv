Our first (completely hypothetical) team ended up 7 below expected, and our second team ended up 2 below expected. Although the first team lost *5* more expected territories than the second, the second result was substantially more unlucky! Using a raw absolute difference is misleading that way. I‚Äôd wager that because OSU has more expected territories every night than almost any other team, and usually a higher standard deviation in expected territories as a result (depending on the night), I‚Äôd wager they‚Äôre not actually the unluckiest team, though they are quite unlucky. Similarly, I‚Äôd guess that Stanford‚Äôs cumulative luck was better than A&M‚Äôs, because they were so small.

Anyways, I think the best metric would be the z score in total number of non unique territories controlled over the entire game compared to the sum of expected territories from every turn."
