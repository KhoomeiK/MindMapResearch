UCI,fot1tvr,t3_g98p1f,1588042766.0,"same boat as you! I worked those couple years specifically to TAG in. Congrats, even if school might be online at least we’re finally able to move to the next step of our academic careers!"

starbucks,folew8j,t3_g7x2vh,1587860746.0,"you’re right and I’ll be the first to admit that the reason I can’t do something as simple as stop caring is because of other mental health issues I need to get checked. But you’re absolutely right, it’s about mindset."
UCI,foe8iw1,t1_fodzvcu,1587698205.0,"I’ve never even heard that you could transfer with only TAG, for some reason I was under the impression by my counselors that I have to do the IGETC. But obviously they were mistaken or I misunderstood. My source is just my experience with my counselors"
UCI,fodwb1g,t1_fodui79,1587691348.0,"I'm not a counselor, so I'd suggest talking to a counselor to verify this information.

However I was told to at all costs avoid W's because they do count against you. I was also told I need to complete the IGETC to enroll for TAG. I have a few peers who had taken W's for classes and were told that if they retook the class and passed, then it would look better to colleges even though the W would still be on your transcript."
UCI,foc9pmd,t1_fobklez,1587668759.0,thanks for letting me know :)
UCI,fo9rkgt,t1_fo3mlbe,1587628669.0,"not OP, but if you live in california and are going to a community college, you can do the TAG program. It’s literally a transfer guarantee program, so if you fulfill the requirements for your majors and don’t miss any deadlines, then you’ll basically be guaranteed admission. But you gotta make sure your major is part of the program, and you also gotta make sure to pass all your classes by the deadlines, maintain a 3.2 GPA, and talk to a counselor about planning your community college classes. It’s what I did and it honestly went super well. Hopefully this applies to you, if it doesn’t then all I can say is I wish you luck getting in and sorry I wasn’t more helpful!"
UCI,fo9qfol,t3_g6bxzy,1587627588.0,I’m kind of freaking out about this too. Was so excited that I could live on campus with the shuttle and amenities as well as just being close to school in general. transfer student as well!
starbucks,fo3vcso,t3_g5i5u0,1587493568.0,"i have a guy at my store who’s a regular and whats kind of a funny coincidence is that I’ve been at the store for a full year and had never served him on POS. So I recognized the name but had no idea what his face was.

Well when I asked for a name he was just staring at me, and when I asked for it again because I thought he didn’t hear me, he just muttered “ah, you must be new”

lol it was pretty satisfying to tell him “oh actually I’ve been here a year” and him look at me all confused.
Then finally he said his name and I was saying “oh yeah, I remember your name now. Funny how we never talked face to face.”

anyway moral of the story telling someone they “must be new” is kind of insulting even if you really ARE new. I mean it’s condescending at best."
ThrowingFits,fmpo8re,t1_fmbsrhn,1586284359.0,"hey I just wanted to say that the company is actually donating lots of their masks to law enforcement and health professional, as well as working with the federal government to produce as many masks as possible to distribute.

though i can’t say anything about the guy being creepy."
starbucks,fmntfa4,t3_fw3rje,1586234781.0,"I understand completely. I was so mad to find out starbucks isn’t closing because what about overpriced sugary liquid is essential?

but I also know you can’t change what people do. If you’re able to take the cat pay, take it. Don’t stay out of solidarity for your partners because you’re not really helping your partners, you’re helping keep the store open and letting people give a corporation more money.

It was really hard for me to decide to take the cat pay but I’m fortunate enough to be able to do so. I know some people need that money and to that all I’m going to say is be careful, manage the best hygiene, and let’s just hope the states get more serious about cracking down on social distancing. That’s kind of the only way to get people to stop being stupid and stay at home at this point :/ take care of yourselves guys"
starbucks,fmnsw01,t3_fwchpo,1586234350.0,I’ve been considering painting my nails on cat pay too. whats stopping me is knowing I’ll get attached and depressed when I need to take them off 😭
starbucks,fmnss8n,t3_fwbxg9,1586234267.0,don’t do that. Show up to work and tell everyone to wear the filters if you have to. If she keeps insisting then def take that cat pay. Or just take the cat pay anyway because this is getting ridiculous
starbucks,fmno1wi,t1_fmmxa4h,1586230679.0,"honestly if you’re in a position where you’re able to take CAT pay, do it. I was nervous to do it but now I’m grateful for the peace of mind knowing I won’t be infected if I stay home."
starbucks,fm96jnp,t3_ftonea,1585862665.0,I thought I read that all cafe stores are going to be closed until May 3rd. That’s what the partner hub says at least. Check out the covid-19 section just to double check and ask about it to your store manager or district manager
