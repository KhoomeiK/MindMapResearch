UCSD,fpa9wrk,t3_gc2bi6,1588443782.0,I found the Microsoft java courses on [edX](https://www.edx.org/course/learn-to-program-in-java-2)  to be quite good. They're like CSE 11/8AB. You can take it free by auditing.

DecidingToBeBetter,fo87hfu,t1_fo787k5,1587591285.0,I’m actually scared of having kids because I sleep too much (amongst other reasons...)
UCSD,fntbt3o,t3_g3r34v,1587238521.0,"I think it's really hard to think about that amount of money when you're in high school. I know I struggled to wrap my head around it, but my friend made the decision to go out of state for engineering. He's making about 70k which is average starting in engineering and cs but told me he has to be $1,000 a month for then next 10 years to pay off his student loans. That's literally a second rent payment for 10 YEARS."

UCSD,fnju3xa,t3_g26e9z,1587007030.0,"I think it depends on the professor, but if you email them and express your interest and enthusiasm in their class then you’re likely golden. I did this with one class this quarter, and the prof was really nice about it. Good luck!!"
