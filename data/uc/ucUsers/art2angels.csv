UCI,fpk1ga4,t3_gdr4xl,1588686045.0,"That is just so sad :(. So many low Income students rely on this resource especially since we can’t go to Langston to use the course reserves for most books. I personally never used the archive because it never had any of the books I needed but I know it has helped so many students get through classes. Who ever did this, shame on you."
UCI,fpijtx3,t1_fphqodf,1588642395.0,"I feel the same way. I feel like all the course material is going on one ear and out the other. All I am focusing on is the assignment and not actually learning anything which is really sad because we all spend so much money on this schooling experience, I want to actually learn something and retain that info."
UCI,fpijodh,t1_fphp25d,1588642304.0,"I kinda feel the same but if you are struggling emotionally because of the virus, I would highly suggest that you call the counseling center and maybe try to set up a tele-psych meeting with a counselor in order to talk things out so you can figure out what’s the best option for you during this difficult time. Hang in there, you can DM if you want someone to talk to <3"
UCI,fpibnwv,t1_fphp1tc,1588637603.0,It’s really unfair to do this to students. The Irvine company has enough money to release these students from their leases without any fees. They just see students as expendable since we only really stay here for 4-8 years. The school should maybe try to pressure the Irvine company. If not the school got money from the government and can refund student.
UCI,fphjr4a,t1_fphjc88,1588622500.0,"Sameee, I know that because people are protesting in OC that the school probably doesn’t want to make any promises yet :/"
UCI,fpfv4q6,t1_fpfuqli,1588584664.0,"I am doing alright, I’ve been playing a lot of Animal Crossing. I guess the worst thing is that I’ve been worrying about money a lot because I don’t know how housing is gonna look for fall quarter so I’m just a little wary about spending too much of my savings. I’ve been pretty happy though."
UCI,fpfcw2v,t1_fpf9e7j,1588567603.0,Don’t work too hard!
tarot,fpf440k,t3_gd3od8,1588561319.0,"Deck: Trungles Star Spinner Tarot 
Spread: 3 card spread with my significator card at the top.
Question: I was asking the tarot about my general future and how I am gonna be emotionally in the next couple of days 
My interpretation: I think this doesn’t look so good and that something bad is about to happen or boil over. Especially because of the devil and 3 of swords."
