In many contexts Ellie or Meg are okay. Parents get more leeway even at older ages because you never stop being a parent. But you aren't always around them. People will probably look funny at a Peggy whose name isn't short for Margaret (as I did). So giving them a more formal name gives them options. I think it would be selfish, even, to make a kid's legal name a nickname, because you're constraining them to a notably informal name just because you want to call them that.

This isn't to say that I think this issues aren't worth fixing. Rural areas HAVE been left behind. Those voters have been hoodwinked or disenfranchised until Republicans have control. And liberals are not without issues.

But why does that mean we should shift our focus to coddling cishet white men from the realities of their privilege so they don't shoot up schools, vote for a monster, post racist comments online? Why do minorities have to be living lessons to rehabilitate bigots? Aren't we still privileging the most powerful group by focusing on fixing them at the expense of the people they hurt?"

FundieSnark,fo5vhgx,t1_fo5mnvq,1587537027.0,"Valid. I do not mean to suggest that all nurses are fundies, but rather that because of the limited options for fundie women, being a nurse gets co-opted by their agenda. One can't just work as a nurse in Fundieland--it feeds into the role of women as nurturers, the power dynamic in which they're under men, the ability of women to tend their children and loved ones, the subordination of women's careers to family (until such time as their kids are old enough for some, like my mother), the treatment of women's careers and interests as backup options (as with my aunt and cousin, who have their degrees as options if their men fall on hard times but are not the breadwinners and are currently SAHMs). 

In America at least there's also this morality that plays into it. As I mentioned, nursing plays well with the fundie gender role where women are nurturing mothers subordinate to men. They derive all the power they can have in their culture from it--something sociologists call 'emphasized' femininity. They're not on top, but they're the best women. As such, they get to police others, both their own tier (lest someone fall) and subordinated men and women. Fundie culture, via complementarianism, also positions mothers as the passive moral centers of the family, subject to the husband, a dynamic (they'd consider) mirrored in the nursing workplace.

The result is that fundie nurses aren't normal nurses. The Nurse becomes an archetype in Fundieland, pivotal to the maintenance of gender dynamics and perpetuation of evangelical morality. It's no wonder that for fundies, being a nurse can be a personality, because it's more than a job."

exchristian,fntxyov,t3_g3o3zj,1587250739.0,"I think both sides have a point. Christianity has MASSIVE issues as we all well know and is tied to the classist, racist Republican Party via the religious right. I won't say more because others in this thread have said it better. But sometimes people who have left don't consider that for poor communities or communities of color, churches may have cultural and historic value. For example, churches are sometimes the only cultural center in an area and immigrant populations may find support networks in a church of the same cultures. Even back in the day of the KKK and segregation, black ministers and their churches played a huge role in the civil rights movement (as they were paid by congregants and not beholden to white employers, they could be more outspoken)."
namenerds,fntvjhz,t1_fnttily,1587249408.0,"There's probably contrasts that don't exist in English. For instance, (not) aspirating the P or using the wrong T-sound. If you speak languages with those contrasts it jumps out, but if you don't, it's identical."
yiffinhell,fnrgzgm,t1_fnrf709,1587188661.0,Hmm. That makes me wonder if part of it is getting around the limited range of motion and thus limited range of expression.
yiffinhell,fnre29h,t1_fnr588z,1587186202.0,"I think it's two reasons: one, you gotta fit a whole human in there in addition to the material necessary for (relative) durability, structure, and looking something like a leg. Two, because anthropomorphic animals don't really exist, these personas (fursonas?) start life typically as stylized drawings. The cartoonish nature carries over.

Maybe I'm reading too much into this..."

namenerds,fno21cy,t3_g2vq26,1587109208.0,"What speaks to you? Do you like classics? Nouns? Certain meanings?

I think the rhythm of your deadname sounds pretty cool and might help it feel natural to say and flow off the tongue. With that in mind, here's some combinations of Jasper with one-syllable middles: Jasper Neil, Jasper Cain, Jasper Kent, Jasper Keith, Jasper Clay, Jasper Beau, Jasper Dean, Jasper Finn, Jasper Grey, Jasper Glen, Jasper Heath, Jasper Quinn.

I avoided names starting with P as I don't like two syllables in a row starting with the same letter. I also avoided any starting with R so that your first and middle names don't run into one another. That's up to your preferences, though."
wokekids,fnnnpa6,t1_fnnb0zr,1587096768.0,No. Youtuber Shaun did an excellent look at this; they are a loss.

Asexual,fnn2pvy,t1_fnmr15b,1587083149.0,"I think it's deliberately muddled. The Church is compared to an abusive partner in that song and has a lot of teachings, history, and mythology (for lack of a better word) tied to sex. And its imperialism, whew! (A theme in Foreigner's God.)"
