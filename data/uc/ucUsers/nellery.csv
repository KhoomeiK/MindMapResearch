berkeley,fnmk1rq,t3_g2i5gc,1587072835.0,"Sethian is an AMAZING professor - I had him for 53 in Fall 2018, and it’s the best class I’ve taken here at Berkeley. He teaches things in a really understandable way, to the point where the other professor’s students that semester were attending his lecture. He gives quite a bit of weekly homework (one week there was over 100 problems) but it’s honestly about the same level of work as a lot of other Berkeley classes, since the problems are quick if you understand them. The other nice thing about him is that his exam questions are fairly...predictable? Basically if you put the work in and really interact with the textbook, you will do well on exams - they’re very true to the material. I would seriously recommend taking his class even if you never plan to see a double integral again, just because of the understanding he’ll give you of the subject."
