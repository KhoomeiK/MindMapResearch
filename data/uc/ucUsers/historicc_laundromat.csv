Children in societies that practice FGM are brainwashed by parents of both gender to accept it as normal and inflict it on their own children.

If genital mutilation to reduce sexual pleasure could be explained away as one gender being brainwashed by the other, it would be very difficult to explain the popularity of male circumcision as a means to prevent masturbation in the West, unless you're going to make the case that men in the early 20th century were simply being brainwashed and oppressed by women. Cultural norms are more complicated than that, and archaic attitudes toward sexual pleasure don't just come from men.

People who still defend male circumcision rarely use this argument nowadays, but the fact remains that routine circumcision of male infants originated as a direct attack on sexuality and sexual pleasure.

It's also worth noting that both forms of genital mutilation tend to be supported by parents of both genders in the respective countries where they're routinely practiced.

It never feels like derailment because it doesn't devolve into heated debates about who is actually a victim.

People engage in gatekeeping on the topic of genital mutilation because there's a large portion of this site that wants to treat genital mutilation very differently depending on the gender of the victim, and debates about that distinction tend to dominate any thread about genital mutilation.

To those who oppose all genital mutilation, this gender-based gatekeeping makes no more sense than gender-based gatekeeping in a thread about rape, or any other topic involving victims of both genders.

But for those who support routine circumcision for infant males, it's upsetting for their views to be challenged in a way that ties them to something they consider morally repugnant for the opposite gender.

But he was there first, let you crash on his couch (presumably for free) while you looked for a place, then let you move in for the long-term once his other roommate left. So the only reason you had a place to live in the first place was because of his generosity.

TooAfraidToAsk,fobye41,t3_g6g0c2,1587665064.0,"It's not that reddit specifically is obsessed with circumcision. It's that circumcision is viewed as barbaric in most of the developed world, and on reddit you're regularly interacting with people who live in that part of the world. A lot of Americans are never exposed to this worldview until they use a site like reddit with a diverse international userbase. So they're taken aback when something they thought was a non-issue is met with vehement opposition."
askgaybros,foa2ol6,t1_fo677mb,1587638146.0,"Statistically, it's very unlikely that you'd opt to do it as an adult. Most people who know what it's like to have a foreskin opt to keep it."
askgaybros,foa1jdw,t1_fo5r9hd,1587637388.0,"Routine infant circumcision was popularized in the Anglosphere in the late 19th and early 20th centuries as a way to make masturbation more difficult / less pleasurable. At the time, masturbation was widely viewed as both morally sinful and medically dangerous. By the middle of the 20th century, routine infant circumcision had become the norm in countries like the US, Canada, and Australia.

In the mid- to late 20th century, attitudes about sexuality relaxed and the view that masturbation is inherently harmful lost credibility in the medical community. But by that point, these countries were full of circumcised men whose fathers and grandfathers had also been circumcised.

Circumcised American men born in the 1950s, 60s, and 70s had no historical memory of the original justification for the procedure, were raised in a society where it's the established norm, and had little to no knowledge about the anatomy of an intact penis. So for most of them, the default position was to opt for circumcision without even really thinking about it. The anti-masturbation motive was just retroactively replaced with blander justifications, like ""it's cleaner"" or ""it looks better"" or ""we want our child to fit in"".

Thankfully, the tide is changing, and circumcision rates are declining in the US. I suspect this is related to the rise of the internet, which has led to wider awareness about the sinister origins of this practice and the fact that it isn't normal in most of the developed world."

unpopularopinion,fo8boos,t1_fo777h2,1587593506.0,"Blaming feminists for circumcision is silly. Circumcised males are generally its most vocal defenders, and the decision is usually made either by the father or by both parents jointly. And the cultures that typically practice infant circumcision tend to be conservative and religious, not exactly hotbeds of feminism."
unpopularopinion,fo8astj,t1_fo6jfyn,1587593036.0,Whether or not you care has no bearing on the question of whether it's mutilation. Many victims of female genital mutilation defend the practice and inflict it on their own daughters. Does that mean it's no longer mutilation? Of course not. This is a ludicrous line of reasoning.

oakland,fnj3fmb,t3_g1vht8,1586991232.0,"Friendly reminder that a lot of people age 18-35 without families live with large groups of roommates because rent is such a nightmare. Some of the groups you see could be people who all come from the same household.

I currently live with six roomates. Sometimes all seven of us go to the lake for picnics. We take social distancing from other groups very seriously when we do this. But we live in such close proximity that there's really no effective way for us to social distance from one another. It's just the reality of how people with limited income are surviving amidst a massive housing crunch.

If you see a group of like 30 people, that's probably another story. But ten people or less, especially if they're young adults, I'd automatically assume they're living together."

samharris,fnecji4,t1_fnam58a,1586886926.0,"I'm not a huge Biden fan, but it's pretty insane to endorse Sanders and then swing over to Trump once Sanders drops out. Trump and Sanders are so fundamentally opposed across so many different policy issues.

The only way I could even begin to rationalize that kind of pivot is by assuming that he just doesn't give a fuck about any of the actual policy questions and just wants to stick it to the political establishment. But even that doesn't really make sense since the right-wing establishment has been on the Trump train for a while now. A vote for Trump isn't an anti-establishment vote anymore."
tinnitus,fnbbym3,t1_fnajskr,1586812828.0,"It can be caused by a number of underlying issues, but the most common is hearing loss, which can happen with age but can also happen to younger people due to exposure to loud noise.

You could go to an ear nose and throat (ENT) doctor and get your hearing checked if you're curious as to whether that's the cause.

If your hearing is normal for your age and the tinnitus doesn't bother you, it's unlikely to be indicative of anything serious. Just be careful with your ears so it doesn't get worse. Keep headphones at a reasonable volume, wear earplugs at concerts, etc."

It probably depends a lot on the cause of your tinnitus and the volumes you're listening at. For gaming, I would invest in some external speakers. Any situation where you could substitute out headphones, probably a good idea to do so just to be safe."
tinnitus,fmlxfgv,t3_fvxac6,1586194974.0,"Depends on what's causing it, however most cases that last for years end up being essentially permanent. You could visit an ENT to try to diagnose the cause, but if you've had it your whole life, you should keep your expectations low."
