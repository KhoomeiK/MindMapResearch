UCDavis,fpl6dgx,t1_fpieog8,1588707166.0,Ok! Thank you very much!
UCDavis,fpgk792,t1_fpfs8mo,1588604319.0,Yes! It totally depends on the person. IMO single rooms are not isolating. They’re the exact opposite- personal space to recover from socializing- and in no way do they affect your ability to have/make friends.
UCDavis,fpgjyv8,t3_gd6y2k,1588604192.0,"Single was the absolute best. If you feel lonely, leave your room and go hang out in the lounge, or outside, or anywhere else on campus. Check out clubs, talk to people in the DC, be the one to say hello first. 

I got a single room thru student disability, I had an injury at the time where I needed total control over the light and noise level in my own room. After I healed fully by the end of my first quarter the let me keep the single room. 

You can have people over when you want, you get to decide how clean (or not clean) the whole room is, and overall a single room really improved my college experience, but it is really different for everyone. 

All I have to say is it is really difficult to get into a single but really easy to switch out of one. If you think you want one, apply for it, and if it doesn’t go well your first quarter, you can always do a ‘roommate transfer’ after your first quarter."
AMA,fp2sx7y,t1_fp23hr4,1588267352.0,"Thanks man! Mechanical engineering, finishing my second year. It feels odd for sure, I was really looking forward to being onsite and meeting everyone. But ultimately I am relieved I didn’t lose the opportunity, and that NASA is making sure they do what they can to keep people safe"
AMA,fp13unh,t1_fp11s2a,1588223665.0,"Accepted an offer to be a summer 2020 intern in early March. Due to rona, all interns got the option of turning down their offer or going digital. NASA has been a dream for me, so I’ll take a digital internship over no internship any day."
AMA,fp13rk6,t1_fp10czd,1588223598.0,Yes. 10/10 would prefer unknown space monsters to the panic that ensues when seaweed wraps around your foot
UCDavis,fp0z7sm,t1_fp0nhcv,1588220325.0,We Stan Sammi-blue
EngineeringStudents,fonu2b3,t3_g8jrwa,1587926468.0,"This seems very odd to me. I didn’t take either of these until the end of my second year, post calculus and physics."
AskEngineers,fomm1n6,t1_fnlq3t4,1587895172.0,"This. Free body diagrams and commenting the code. I felt that in my soul. I work in the machine shop on campus. I’m a relatively new hire, and learning a lot of the ropes still, but got the highest marks in the class that got me the job and know what I’m doing. My assistance to male peers who ask for it is seldom taken by them unless a full-time male staffer backs it up. I have grown quite uneasy about hugs due to engineering school as well. We deserve handshakes. 

I would love to hear more about your Women in Engineering group. The one at my school isn’t the best."
UCDavis,foe57oo,t3_g703dc,1587696266.0,Way too expensive. I highly recommend leasing a room in a house instead. The amenities are nice but the walls are thin and management can be iffy at times.
UCDavis,fod65bp,t3_g6t8yx,1587680554.0,"I took it last year. Averages 65-70 each test. I ended with a 73, curved to B+. I think our class had a bigger curve than most. But there is almost always a curve of some size."
EngineeringStudents,fo96w4b,t1_fo27xr4,1587611937.0,Thanks man! Good to hear
EngineeringStudents,fo96umc,t1_fo1sgi3,1587611910.0,"Indeed it will. Hang in there the best you can, we can do this"
UCDavis,fn93y6d,t1_fn6vz1w,1586758601.0,I also would like to learn more about it!
ElectricalEngineering,fn066cx,t1_fn0478m,1586536148.0,"Wow, thank you!"
ElectricalEngineering,fn05xak,t1_fmzb7uu,1586536018.0,LaPlace is coming also. This class covers too much ground for 10 weeks.
EngineeringStudents,fn02agv,t1_fmxx8dy,1586534141.0,"Ok, thank you!"
ElectricalEngineering,fn028gj,t1_fmz2rbv,1586534110.0,"Wow, thank you!"
ElectricalEngineering,fmyilub,t1_fmyahrr,1586487047.0,"Haven’t gotten to op amps and Fourier yet, but they’re coming. I understand KCL and KVL but I’m really struggling with node voltage analysis. We had a problem with no given voltages, other than which one was ground, and we had to determine one of the other node voltages. I started using KVL but I got really tripped up on the individual nodes because we’d only done problems in which Initial voltages we given and a new ground was assigned. Apologies if that’s not clear, I can try and find a problem like it. I understand wye-delta pretty well. It’s just nodal analysis that is going weirdly which I am putting more time into this week because I know that’s kind of the most important thing. 

Do you have any YouTube channels you recommend? I learn really well from videos but have a hard time learning from books alone. Thank you so much."

UCDavis,fmr37de,t1_fmn9wo7,1586312823.0,Hi I miss you
UCDavis,fmk5pix,t3_fv1cwq,1586145210.0,Aggie experiences live is a digital tour for prospective students ! You should have received some info on it if you’re prospective class of 24
