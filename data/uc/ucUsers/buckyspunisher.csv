I'm so sorry about your situation. your wife made a horrible, ill-thought out decision. i'm glad you realize that dogs need lots of care. if you can't return the dog or find another suitable owner, please just do your best with the dog. there's very affordable pet supplies out there, especially at the dollar store. make sure the dog gets trainer properly and you start now. labs are big and powerful."

Now part of your misfortune is caused by shitty luck and circumstances. But you also have to take responsibility for yourself. You seem to regret a lot of things.

You were never a god, no one is. Everyone is insignificant in the grand scheme of things and that’s not a surprise. We are all only responsible for ourselves.
