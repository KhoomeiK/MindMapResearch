gradadmissions,fogh7g3,t1_fogbbc3,1587752538.0,"Most programs ""thesis"" is essentially what you described. It's a showcase where you prepare 2 monologues and possibly a song. You work on what you will present your senior year and then perform it at the showcase for your professor, agents and theatremakers of all kinds. Some schools, like mine,  do one in NYC and LA to help you get eyes on you and your work for both theatre and tv. 

My program is pretty awesome in that part of my ""thesis"" is a residency with a world renowned theatre that often is the starting place for shows and playwrights that go to Broadway. 

I applied for a fellowship in addition to my program and I hope to get to do some additional research. I studied theatre in undergrad in addition to psych and neuroscience and would love if they had some cool interdepartmental research going that combined the two."

UCSD,fo8czm6,t1_fo83mpp,1587594210.0,Oh so glad! I don't know why the info is so hard to find. It took hours of scouring the UCSD website just to find that page.
UCSD,fo6d33f,t3_g5wi2m,1587555189.0,"I think grad housing has a 2 year lease term unless you have SHORE. However,  I think if you give them at least 30 (or maybe 60?) days notice before you leave, then everything is fine."
UCSD,fo4zpwf,t1_fo4yh5h,1587514444.0,I realized I linked to the wrong page in my first comment. I edited the first link so that it showed you how to set everything up.
UCSD,fo4tiwb,t1_fo4oxe6,1587510916.0,Did you use the student account lookup tool I mentioned above? That's where I found my email account.
UCSD,fo3tnmw,t3_g5irl4,1587492757.0,"I never got a notification when my email was setup. So it might be setup and you just dont know it yet. 


EDIT: I linked to the wrong place for the first link. I fixed it! That page should help you more. 


Reference this [page](https://ucsdservicedesk.service-now.com/its?id=kb_article_view&sys_kb_id=6d85786edbf47f809736f35aaf96199c) use the student account lookup tool to see if they have set up your email account yet. You'll need your pid. And once you have access to your UCSD email, email the grad housing people and ask them to connect you current housing waitlist application to your pid number which will automatically connect it to your SSO account you create in that link. 

Once you do all this you can sign up with DUO which will be the final step to accessing your waitlist application. Learn how to set up DUO by clicking [here.](https://resnet.ucsd.edu/duo/first-time-registration.html)

If you need more help, pm me and maybe I can help walk you through it! It took me a long ass time to figure it out too."
UCSD,fo2ug53,t1_fo1u7x7,1587474368.0,"Ok. It us super easy to apply for a fellowship. All are listed here - [UCSD Fellowships](https://grad.ucsd.edu/diversity/incoming-fellowships/index.html)

Basically it is really easy to apply although I believe all the deadlines have passed this year. You are supposed to answer at least 2 of the questions/ sections listed in your application when you are applying. Answers are to be around 3-5 sentences. I suggest contacting your department once accepted to tell them you submitted an application because they will need a faculty nomination letter. UCSD may contact whichever department you are connected with on their own though for the letter. The more your department knows you though, the better the rec letter. 

The fellowships all get you around 22k of funding per year at the institution. The one specifically for hbcu grads gets you 25k. They each get you SHORE I believe which guarantees you graduate housing for the entirety of your time here and you get to skip the waitlist. 

The hardest part about the process is condensing your answers honestly. I didn't answer the questions when I applied so I had to reach out to my department and submit a separate word doc to them that they passed onto the fellowship committee. But I think showing them that I was interested and staying in contact with them throughout helped with my nomination letter."
UCSD,fnr1kby,t3_g3alyl,1587177091.0,Is your friend a grad student or undergrad? I am an incoming grad student who applied for a fellowship and got it so I maybe be able to give insight.
UCSD,fnhb0hn,t1_fnghtdo,1586958892.0,"As a fellow shore student, I was told that it meant that we were guaranteed housing and that we are at the top of the waitlist. Essentially, we will get our first pick as long as that pick is available. So if a 1 br is on the top of your list but it is not available, then they will move to the next housing option on your list."
acting,fncis8h,t3_fzoi6h,1586837817.0,"There are a lot of MFA programs in the country that are completely free (full tuition waiver/ remission,  hash insurance,  spend,  etc) that might end up being cheaper than the conservatories that you're looking at. One's like UCI AND UCSD are conservatory style programs. Reach out to me if you'd like info!"
sandiego,fncexjd,t1_fnceh8s,1586835096.0,"Oh cool! She's class of 2023 as well?

Edit: I realize you said she's a professor! I must have met her during callback weekend! All of the faculty was amazing and largely the reason I went with UCSD."
sandiego,fnca9it,t1_fnca4l4,1586832026.0,"Ah my second love! When do you plan on moving down? I know things are up in the air right now, but I'm really hoping August will be ok. Have you looked at grad housing yet?"
sandiego,fnc9yzd,t3_g0vssr,1586831838.0,Awesome! Same! What program are you doing at UCSD? I'm doing an MFA in Acting!
UCSD,fmx1ff5,t3_fxvh19,1586456752.0,Does this mean that Competitive Edge is basically canceled?
