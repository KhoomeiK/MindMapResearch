UCI,fp7g2z0,t1_fp7fywg,1588369963.0,"Is he? All I've seen is this screenshot, is the full video floating around somewhere?

Edit: ~~oh wait is the caption his?~~ no it's not"
UCI,fp7fsri,t1_fp7f9pp,1588369813.0,"All it really shows is that he was there, I don't think this really shows what his intentions were."
UCI,fp7azrt,t3_gbny2q,1588367248.0,"Theres a way to do it, but it's complicated. Look it up on YouTube. If this is about not wanting to have it installed on your computer, create a system restore point before installing it and revert to it right after the exam. It's like Respondus was never there."
Entrepreneur,fp7asqd,t1_fp68zln,1588367145.0,"I feel the same, though I have not yet graduated. I'm vaguely learning about social media marketing in some class right now, while at the same time I'm creating ad campaigns and gaining real practical experience through my business on my own time. I think it's pretty clear which one is going to be more helpful long term; if it wasn't for the fact that not having a degree makes you almost unhirable in many places, I don't think I would be in college right now.

Maybe that's just marketing though, I hear fields like accounting or finance are different for some people."
shopify,fp71zpt,t1_fp71qta,1588362594.0,"That's what my Ads account was suspended for about an hour after my Merchant Center account was. I assumed it was because it had the same payment method attached.

I appealed both of them, and I still have no idea what's going on. Of course Google's support isn't very helpful even in normal times, and they're practically nonexistent now."
Digital_Manipulation,fp6m2r2,t1_fp5q1xs,1588354675.0,"I think what most people outside of the marketing field don't understand is that not all exposure is helpful, or at least helpful enough to be worth the effort.

Showing a room service bot to a bunch of random redditors on r/pics that likely have no ties to the hospitality industry is not worth the effort. You might as well show an ad for new farming equipment to a bunch of bankers."
Digital_Manipulation,fp6k72k,t1_fp6j2nb,1588353748.0,"Exactly, just because something is branded in a photo doesn't guarantee that the company is behind it. Sometimes people just see something cool that happens to have a brand name."
adhdmeme,fp6hk4l,t3_gbb5ib,1588352456.0,"This sounds a little more like OCD to me, is this an ADHD thing too? I suppose they are closely related after all."
Digital_Manipulation,fp6gwt0,t3_gbfc81,1588352142.0,"Yeah, I'm not really convinced. If you think about it from a marketing standpoint, it makes no sense to use r/pics to market a niche B2B product made for such a specific industry. The main consumers of these robots would be businesses such as hotels and the like, and while it's possible that some hotel owners may be browsing reddit and stumble upon this post, the percentage of users like that would be minuscule. It's far more likely that this is just some guy using a photo of an unusual robot to karma farm."
ADHD,fp6f8ca,t3_gbi1kl,1588351319.0,"Agreed, I've never related to any other online group as much as this one. I owe you all big time, because I might not have been diagnosed to begin with had I not been able to read everyone's experiences here (and relate to almost all of them)."
UCI,fp6cjf0,t3_gbb5cu,1588349996.0,"I suggest creating a system restore point before installing respondus, then reverting to that point right after the exam. Not much extra work to do, and you don't have to worry about their sketchy ass software being on your computer afterwards."
shopify,fp36aqc,t1_fp35qb1,1588273836.0,"If your product is unique and made by you, you technically are the manufacturer and you can make an MPN for yourself. I just used my SKU number. If not, ask the manufacturer probably.

Mostly it was my descriptions that were messed up, for instance my bullet point lists were smashed together and unreadable. Also my tax collection was off, among other small things like that."
EtsySellers,fp2zkyo,t1_fp2mzlx,1588270547.0,"I sold a few big ticket items the week the stimulus checks hit, and I was very confused until I remembered why. I haven't sold anything above $50 since then though. My smaller items are still showing steady sales however, so hopefully we'll start slowly recovering."
shopify,fp2t2h5,t1_fp2sn10,1588267421.0,"I think they actually ban your URL and maybe even your IP until your account is reinstated, so unfortunately I dont think that would work. I believe the only way is changing your shop URL and using a VPN, though honestly I'm not even sure."
shopify,fp2nch6,t1_fp2n4tw,1588264696.0,"I submitted an appeal last weekend, heard back saying they had received it on monday (but they hadn't actually reviewed it yet). Cant get anyone on the phone because of COVID-19 and they said it would likely take longer than usual, so this is a horrible time for this to happen. I'm sure this is happening to a lot of people now that Google Shopping is free, I wish they thought to actually improve their app first because it is terrible."
shopify,fp2m7k0,t3_gawycz,1588264152.0,"Just be careful with the Google Shopping app. I tried starting a Smart Shopping campaign from the app, thinking I'd be fine because all my listings were approved. Wrong, both my Merchant Center and Adwords accounts were suspended within an hour. Turns out the Shopify compatibility is terrible, and all my listing descriptions and attributes were a complete mess when they were ported over.

Bottom line: check what the listings actually look like in the Merchant Center before you try anything, and don't get banned for a rookie mistake like me."
Entrepreneur,fp10fqn,t1_fp0zer5,1588221174.0,"Glad I could help shed some light on things! I recommend seeing a therapist and then a psychiatrist (who prescribes meds), just to help you get stuff figured out so you know what your fighting against first. Lots of psych centers are offering video appointments right now too"
Entrepreneur,fp0yfgg,t1_fp0pndk,1588219784.0,"For me the pros definitely outweigh the cons, but it is really different for everyone. My creativity for idea generation is not affected, and I'm able to be way more productive because I'm not constantly getting in my own way. It really helps with working on aspects of entrepreneurship that are harder and less enjoyable, which I struggled with severely in the past. Plus, once the meds wear off I'm back to normal within a couple hours so it's not a permanent thing.

However, I have a friend who also has ADHD that gets a boost in focus but a big decrease in mental ability, so it really depends on how you react as an individual."
reviewmyshopify,fp04gcc,t3_gaiscy,1588202302.0,"Take the advice from your last post before posting again, the site looks the same as it did yesterday. As they said, replace the images. Watermarked, low resolution images aren't going to get you anywhere. Try searching for ""coffee"" on unsplash.com, you can use any of those photos for free."
TheForest,foz7kcn,t1_foypvd9,1588186004.0,"Houseboats are also great for beginners, though you miss out on the base building aspect of the game. I'd say only use it until you get a little more familiar with how things work. They only cost 30 logs or so and you can paddle around the coasts if you build it in the ocean."
orangecounty,for9r49,t1_for8q2l,1588008578.0,"On the bright side, being unhealthy is pretty easy right now"
AncientCoins,foqvj1g,t3_g92dys,1588001574.0,Its [one of these](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B001D7Y9BU/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_apa_i_4QVPEbDZ1E1YB)
shopify,fojpbrp,t1_fojfk9m,1587826483.0,I'm interested as well!
ADHD,fob8xxq,t1_foaosly,1587657341.0,"Stimulants have helped me socially, but they definitely weren't a magic cure. Basically I have the same impulses as I do when unmedicated, but stimulants just give me an extra bit of control over everything. So I still want to interrupt in a conversation or procrastinate responding to a text from a friend (and then accidentally ghost them), but I just have an extra push to prevent me from doing so most of the time.

I did end up reviving a friendship during my first couple days on them, so there's hope!"
ADHD,fob7kww,t1_foaidmm,1587656944.0,"Same here, just the other day I noticed it had been over a year since I talked to one of my good friends and I didnt even realize it. It's not that I didnt notice their absence in my life, it's just that whenever I think to give then a call I procrastinate and say I'll do it a little later, after which my brain instantly moves to something else and I forget about it entirely."
orangecounty,fo20sbe,t1_fo11r4n,1587446344.0,"Thats not true if the supporting source is credible, and the actual source (the website that the county set up specifically to give accurate information on COVID-19) is literally pasted on the bottom of the page. Wikipedia just made an easier to digest graphic using their data."
orangecounty,fnyao0q,t1_fny3lhq,1587357675.0,This comment is pretty ironic now
orangecounty,fnyajnq,t1_fnxz4x7,1587357583.0,"This comment is actually correct, the data is self explanatory if you take a look at it before judging. Of course the protestors are in the wrong, but we cant just go and make up stuff if the data says otherwise. There is no second wave *(yet)*."
EtsySellers,fnwyqdz,t1_fnws7tm,1587328084.0,"This is a commonly overlooked side affect that people should be aware of. I used to put my shop name and logo in the corner of my photos, but removed them for this reason. Now most of my listing's main photos appear near the top of google images, with two of them actually being the first photo shown when searching for the product's main keyword.

Text in secondary photos seems to be okay though, just not the main one because that's what usually shows up in searches."
ADHD,fnslmre,t1_fnsikpt,1587224144.0,"Glad I'm not alone, my meds definitely have not kicked in yet..."
UCIConfessions,fniwofh,t3_g1oa22,1586987694.0,"The problem with these companies is that they tell you what they want your workspace to look like in advance, and then straight up disregard it ALL when it's time to start. I've taken a few online classes every year, and every time I follow their instructions precisely only to have to waste time taking stuff down or covering my monitors (even though it literally says just disconnecting them is fine in the instructions, as u/Zot-Police commented). Not to mention the monitoring software that they require you to install essentially amounts to malware.

Both ProctorU and Examity have given an overall sloppy experience, because we as students have no real say in the online proctoring process and as long as it looks good on the faculty facing side they'll keep getting business."
Chinese,fn6v3fk,t3_fzs408,1586707935.0,"Just FYI, custom chop stamps like these go for about $10 in Chinese flea markets. Unless you're sure it's antique or made of some kind of precious stone I'd be careful not to overpay."
Etsy,fmhafy8,t3_fv8h7a,1586072343.0,"If you're not a high volume shop, you can just use whatever printer you have on hand right now (inkjet or laser) and buy some labels that are compatible with that (they usually come in sheets of 2 labels per page, which Etsy accommodates). It'll save you some money for now, until you outgrow it."
