berkeley,fpib55b,t3_gdbppj,1588637303.0,"Another important note is that CS 61A is taught in python, a language that is syntactically simple yet allows for representing very high level ideas that you will learn very soon after starting the class. It is a lot about understanding how to think like a programmer rather than ""this is how you do xyz in python.""

Similarly, CS 61B uses Java to explain how different data structures work, and is not a class about learning to use Java."

berkeley,fpbeaux,t1_fp94aps,1588468031.0,Merge is made difficult mostly by the need to find a latest common ancestor. That was the thing that wasn't working for me and I had to do a stupid fix to make it work.

marchingband,fpb46tm,t3_gcfzmx,1588461746.0,"Play FFF to cover them while they can't play and make sure to help them and fix mistakes in sectionals. Understand that their improvement is up to them and you can't control how good they are/get, but try to guide them in a good direction.

Having a good attitude about this helps. If you're an encouraging leader, your section mates may be more inclined to improve. I understand that this situation is far from ideal but attacking it without a good mindset may only make things worse."
CollegeBasketball,fp9a6ye,t1_fp88qb6,1588420076.0,The home win against furd this year was a really fun one. Wasn't packed but it was mostly full and it was loud. So I guess go to the furd games if you still can.
CFB,fp99yn5,t1_fp6buxz,1588419849.0,I'd root for furd and Alabama over $C lol. Their band has BDE in the worst possible way. Also if I could have a third flair it would be UCLA so that's probably part of it.
CFB,fp7ghlq,t3_gbjnkx,1588370179.0,"Next semester is going to be weird. I don't know what's going to happen to band because I don't know what's going to happen to football, so now I have to think about making my schedule harder to make up for possibly no or limited band stuff. If campus is open, hopefully there's research? If there's research going on, especially in one of my majors, then I might want to stay. Otherwise, I might just withdraw for the semester. Fuck man idk."
CollegeBasketball,fp7g0t0,t1_fp7aknh,1588369932.0,We basically had no money put into our program the two years before this season and Wyking Jones drove it into the ground. Now... we'll at least be average next year and I'm ok with that.

berkeley,fovvgug,t3_g9urui,1588108224.0,"It can depend on your roommates and how you plan to use your room. I went from having a room to myself at home to a unit 1 triple and I honestly liked it. My roommates were chill and I never really worked in my room so I never really worried about getting work done there. My roommates however did often work in the room and they were easily able to. But yeah if you get shitty roommates a triple can suck but if you have good ones it will be a lot better. If you don't wanna take your chances, try talking to people on the admitted students fb groups to find people you can room with so you're not making it random."
PoliticalCompassMemes,fosf9bm,t1_foscswq,1588029559.0,probably one of the first things that made me libleft was that I wasn't as screechy about gun control as some people I know because guns are useful for many people and you shouldn't infringe upon that.

The atmosphere will probably depend on the people themselves, not really the gender tbh."
SandersForPresident,fof2r45,t3_g70w8m,1587723914.0,"Tangentially related but I do not know where to ask this: I ordered something online in March that shipped from China, and it got to the US on April 10 and is still supposedly in transit by the USPS 14 days later. Is this normal? Should I expect it to be delayed due to the covid crisis/lack of funding? Or am I just needlessly worried? I'm very inexperienced with this stuff since I'm barely an adult."

berkeley,fnu4381,t1_fnu3uos,1587254149.0,"It's what you make of it. If you want to go Greek, there are many frats for you to join, social and professional. From what I heart about 20% of the student body is involved in Greek life, so it's not an overwhelming social presence but it's there if you want it. Lots of cal students do spend a lot of time studying, but many others spend time partying and having fun."
berkeley,fnu3rgr,t1_fnu3p25,1587253961.0,"This season if I remember correctly it's been more full than not. Though we have some big games at home this year unlike last year (TCU, Oregon, Washington, Stanfurd, UCLA)"
berkeley,fnu3j5m,t1_fnu33ot,1587253834.0,"The alumni section isn't always full because Cal alumni are not centralized in the bay area, but if our team is doing well the stadium is more full.

Though the non conference games aren't usually high attendance unless it's a major school, and that's not happening until Auburn comes in 2023 (unless you count TCU this year assuming all things are normal)

Edit: also our student section is on the 50 yard line so if you get a seat you will get a good view."
berkeley,fntwylz,t3_g3swzg,1587250190.0,"Yeah as others said, spirit is higher when our teams are doing well. Football is on the upswing and our QB Chase  Garbers still has two seasons left, so the student section will likely be pretty full this season.

Also ""Go Bears"" is a universal phrase you will adopt if you're on campus, it can either be an expression of spirit when we're doing well in sports or an ironic lament when you have 3 midterms in 2 days and you're not ready for any of them."

Also Berkeley is a cool college town that's basically melded with the rest of the bay area, so there's a fuckton of things to do if you aren't stuck studying for your 7th midterm this semseter."
PoliticalCompassMemes,fmhglfn,t1_fmg8qql,1586079274.0,Yeah this was definitely confirmed (to the best of our ability) a few years ago.
