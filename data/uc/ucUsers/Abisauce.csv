One more question, you won‚Äôt make a review sheet for the exempted units right?"

ApplyingToCollege,fnfhfxz,t1_fne8ewc,1586908113.0,r/chanceme is not a good subreddit. People are very negative in thinking and are not holistic at all. I‚Äôm pretty sure they leave negative comments to feel better about themselves
