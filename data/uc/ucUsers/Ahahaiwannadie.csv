macbookpro,fpl5pkc,t1_fpl4wdm,1588706833.0," I mean it's just off of what I and others who own it have said about the switches. If you wanna keep the butterfly switches, go ahead lol, that's on you. However, if you have the option to just get the magic keyboard, which is superior, I'd go for that. Btw didn't say everyone, some people didn't, and good for them, but this person could in theory save themselves from a headache. Just looking out lol :')"
macbookpro,fpl4j0u,t1_fpl49rq,1588706230.0,"Not really biased, if you've owned one, you'd know how annoying it is to have to ship yours to get it replaced. Y'all can argue all you want, but the fact of the matter is, the butterfly switches suck and y'all know it."
