California,fpiguwo,t1_fpi8fr5,1588640636.0,"I didn’t much like Newsom before this, but this whole ordeal has raised my level of respect for him immensely. I actually think he cares about California a lot, even if his ways might not align with mine. He’s definitely a governor I’m proud of."
UCSC,fp9hoaq,t3_gbs6wc,1588426467.0,"This is dope, honestly would be cool to do this annually."
ufc,fp9glwh,t1_fp8hao2,1588425642.0,I watched part of one of his new specials. He pulled out like a classic kids bit about Santa Clause and I just stopped watching. It was such a basic bit that I was confused how someone who says he’s a king of comedy could come up with something so bland and basic.
UCSC,fp5bnwx,t1_fp4d6s5,1588323336.0,"Honestly if I encountered a question that I could not solve I would go crazy with anxiety. Like sure students shouldn’t cheat, but this ain’t the way to catch the bad ones."
raining,fp2eclh,t1_fp14hfo,1588260290.0,"The one problem I have with these lifo beats is that they honestly just blend together too much. Maybe I don’t pay attention enough, but I don’t find any distinct style to most of them."
NoStupidQuestions,fp17t1i,t1_fp0whgl,1588226868.0,This is a free country and if I wanna take a porn break between questions in my homework I will do what I must.
California,fp129t7,t1_fp0u7vw,1588222470.0,"Honestly, I may not agree with everything this man puts into affect. But he sure does seem like he cares a lot about being active and doing his job. This is someone I can say respect and say “That’s my fucking governor!” even when I disagree on some stuff."
Kanye,fojicb4,t1_foir4fs,1587821701.0,"That’s why I love his discography, to me it really feels like he puts himself into each of his albums. Each represents a piece of what Kanye is or was at the time of making it. And a lot of it’s very relatable in some way."
PrequelMemes,foiigwh,t1_foibj0w,1587787445.0,I really wish Disney put some diehard SW fan (that’s also a great producer) at the helm of new SW. They could sink so much money into this kind of project and make a master piece of star wars.
army,fnof1mv,t1_fnnlztw,1587122964.0,One cap? Always damn near emptied that sucker to make sure the only that smelled was our noses burning from the fumes
Libertarian,fnhnl9k,t1_fnh9tq9,1586965640.0,I’ve never understood how a rally can basically be forced to shut down if the protesters aren’t damaging property or people.
UCSC,fnfvmz6,t1_fnfum0y,1586916432.0,Thank you!
Sneakers,fndhnpu,t1_fncm4ha,1586870224.0,Apparently it was an internet abbreviation for sucker idolizing mediocre pussy. Telling from other definitions of the word and previous comments it used to just mean “sucker” or a shortening of “simpleton”. But the internet culture took this and added the aspect of guys fawning over any girl on the internet.
UCSC,fn4i0tp,t1_fn3srck,1586641794.0,Was meant to be a joke too
UCSC,fn2pyn8,t1_fn1ylpn,1586598586.0,"Bruh every place was meant to have a gym. If you disagree you a weak body...
Edit: guess you really gotta /s on every comment lmao"
UCSC,fn10pia,t1_fn0tw6t,1586552466.0,"He somehow has great lectures as well as great interaction with the zoom chat, and great office hours. He’s very professional and understanding at the same time. All around great professor!"
UCSC,fmxpcdk,t1_fmxp5k9,1586469288.0,Ya it’s really means nothing if major classes aren’t affected
EngineeringStudents,fm4vl9k,t1_fm442jr,1585761628.0,"(No OP)At least in the Army by there’s lot of way to get a degree and also be in. You can go officer route, you enlist then do “green to gold”. You can enlist and they’ll just financially support you getting a degree for the most part. You can do reserve or national guard and go to school. The military now has a fuck ton of options for college."
