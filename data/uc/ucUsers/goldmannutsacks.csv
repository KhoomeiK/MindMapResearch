JonTron,fpbmi5y,t1_fpbmdj2,1588473453.0,It doesn‚Äôt need to ‚Äúcome out of his mouth‚Äù if you can use your fucking brain like a normal human to derive meaning from what he said. He literally said brown people would ‚Äúget into the gene pool..... and..... y‚Äôknow‚Äù. What does that mean to you?
JonTron,fpbb24c,t1_fnpvniz,1588465978.0,"He said he was against race mixing, did they *really* blow it out of proportion?"
AZCardinals,fp315b0,t1_fp30sj5,1588271314.0,So maybe don't comment on someone's character w/o reading into them?
samharris,fodlc84,t1_fodil6a,1587686118.0,There are no saints but you can use common sense to stand against absurdity. Equating the two sides is completely incorrect.
politics,fnyiahs,t1_fnv78p3,1587363942.0,"I really hate when people try to smear Bernie and claim he's in it for the money. Just use some common sense, the man is 78 YEARS OLD, he's been in politics for 40 years advocating a platform that has slowly become the norm the ENTIRE TIME. Ignoring his long history of fighting for normal, working people, what makes you think he wants to line his pockets? You might not agree with his policy but don't smear a good mans character."

politics,fnv4b4i,t1_fnufb2x,1587279779.0,"Maybe if the Democratic Party didn‚Äôt nominate someone who can barely remember where he is. Imagine sending the ‚Äústatus-quo‚Äù candidate when you need a movement. I‚Äôm a liberal but I know when we don‚Äôt stand a chance.

Edit: I‚Äôd go further to say that the DNC knows they can‚Äôt win and the organization decided it would rather have 4 more years of Trump rather than its dismantling at the hands of Bernie. They sold you out to keep themselves alive."

Texans,fl37354,t1_fkyf2nq,1584771166.0,Would you say the same about Tom Brady? I think he raises his kids just fine and he has them with multiple women.
