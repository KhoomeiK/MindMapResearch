But it will get done!"
bulletjournal,fmxdw92,t3_fxryrs,1586463165.0,Wow this is so good! Please post or send me your weekly spreads you do for this month. I doubt I’ll ever try to recreate it but it’s so good I’d love to see more.

I have a roll of film that’s been already exposed and I’ve been using it to practice loading the film into my development tank. As for a scanner I do own one but it’s crappy so I’m planning on investing in a new one, my eye is on Epson v600. I’m excited to jump into it and thanks for the sources."
ABoringDystopia,fmpn99v,t1_fmpmxh0,1586283854.0,"Okay, I’ll tell my city to shove the letter that said don’t drink the tap water up their ass."
ABoringDystopia,fmp30tv,t1_fmp2ka1,1586273464.0,"I can’t say I only moved here a year ago, it’s been this way since. Most places have safe water to drink but the majority still buy bottled water despite this. Where are you from?"
ABoringDystopia,fmp0rxk,t1_fmp0gsx,1586272210.0,"Haha where in America do you live? Despite me being in a liberal area I don’t really meet a lot of people who would shame another for using bottled water, that’s wild but also good considering we should reduce bottled water as a whole."
ABoringDystopia,fmoyay1,t1_fmoxexx,1586270889.0,"In America, the norm is to buy bottled water. The federal standards for irrigation are at a lower standard then many areas uk areas leading to our tap being either unsafe to drink or safe and having a gross, acid-like taste. Oddly enough, it is pushed onto many Americans to buy bottled water even if the tap is safe to drink. It’s somehow became the social norm of our society that bottled water is somehow purer then tap, as if bottled water was extracted from some spring in a high up mountain only occasional deers will take a taste of. Most places in America do have clean water though and my city is in the minority for having water deemed unsafe to drink."
ABoringDystopia,fmow2b5,t1_fmovmug,1586269608.0,"Honestly, most water in America is safe and dandy to drink on up but it’s just my district and general area that has a faulty irrigation system that’s outdated and in need of a change. The waters safe to wash dishes, shower, etc. so I’m lucky to have access to water that can accomplish such tasks. I’m sure other cities have similar situations but almost all water in America is drinkable (if you’re not a stickler for taste)"
ABoringDystopia,fmosc5j,t1_fmorenq,1586267447.0,Yea but lots of cities like mine get mail from the district advising us not to drink the tap water because it’s not clean.

Anxiety,fmg23nc,t1_fmfokwp,1586039651.0,Thank you :)
