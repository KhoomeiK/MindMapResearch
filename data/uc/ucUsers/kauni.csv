restofthefuckingowl,fpbf6hi,t3_gch0lc,1588468600.0,"What? Step 1. Pile yarn up. Step 2, fully knitted sweater and hat. Step 3, same kid in same clothes. 

Totally how I knit, by piling yarn up and magically having people wear knitted garments. /s"

sysadmin,fos000d,t1_forck87,1588021488.0,"Yeah, I keep plucking the beard hairs. (Thanks, premenopause!) But I’m an old grey beard anyway. Been at this IT thing long enough that I remember newsgroups."
knitting,folmmoi,t1_fol7avz,1587865559.0,"Some of column a, some of column b. Depends on how much yarn I need for the project. For a hat, I’d probably just cut the yarn if I had more than 100g."
WhatsWrongWithYourDog,fokdz8s,t1_fojb6d6,1587840300.0,"The flap style doesn’t keep other animals in (we had cats when we first used this door), or other animals out (we have plenty of wildlife now - squirrels, raccoons, etc). We can also turn it off when there’s something going on (bear sighting, something big in the yard in the dark). The transmitter on the collar works well, except when snow covers the outside sensor. It’s been worth it to us for 2 dogs now."

women,fn29atp,t3_fyplqf,1586581518.0,"I recommend the book Doing Harm. I had to stop after each chapter to not just rampage. It’s horrifying and irritating and in many cases, deadly.

Like the obstetrician who advocated for washing your hands after being elbow deep in cadavers and before delivering a baby. Ignaz Semmelweis. The other doctors mocked him! But he showed that proper hygiene saves lives. It makes me so mad to think that so many of our foremothers were treated so badly."
