politics,fmuk5xm,t1_fmujfkl,1586393010.0,"Here’s what I think we really need: mandatory voting. 

It would fix this whole issue with unequal representation, might even get Bernie into office (if it were implemented this year). It would likely get universal healthcare passed. 

The issue is the right would never allow it, because there would never again, ever, be a Republican president in office without major party  policy restructuring."
politics,fmuj40f,t1_fmtd85u,1586392414.0,"Thank you. Anything but the corrupt criminal organization living in the White House. I have always pushed for Biden because I believe he has a better chance than Bernie, even though I agree with 98% of Bernie’s policies. 

The fact remains that most of Bernie’s support is from younger and poorer people, and neither group votes in numbers that could swing the vote in Bernie’s direction."
ActualPublicFreakouts,fmuaez6,t1_fmu9gs9,1586387559.0,"Yeah, well you’re also opening yourself up for vicious ground and pound unless you really know what you’re doing. All I’m saying is I’d much rather go for a takedown and end up on top. 

Furthermore, you don’t get to choose a nice setting with soft ground in a real fight. Getting slammed on concrete has the distinct possibility of breaking bones or at least injuring you significantly enough that you can’t fight well for a few seconds—enough for some vicious ground strikes. 

It’s just a position with too many downsides compared to the upside of “oh my opponent may get overconfident”, in my opinion.

Edit: and I’m not sure how the lifter is exposed and vulnerable...please explain

Edit 2: I’m the vulnerable one being lifted 3 feet off the ground over concrete"
ActualPublicFreakouts,fmqcfqa,t1_fjkqia7,1586297003.0,"Late to the party but I’d never pull guard outside of a bjj match with no striking. Any competent instructor would tell you the same; I used to train at Cesar Gracie Academy, same place as the Diaz brothers, Gil Melendez, and Jake Shields. 

Good way to get picked up and slammed. If slams were legal in the UFC, I bet you’d (almost) never have guys willing to go to guard. Remember, no rules in a street fight."
UCSD,fmn1kva,t3_fw7kav,1586216288.0,"An incredible amount of work. My 3 day a week, 50 minute lecture class has started giving 3 1h30m pre-recorded lectures per week as though that’s reasonable. (Just plan 50 minute lectures like you would’ve done before!)

My other 3 courses have regular homework and reading assigned, rather than just one homework assignment a week. 

It’s like 3x as much work as normal."
