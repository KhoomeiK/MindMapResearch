UCSD,fplidb3,t3_ge69st,1588713245.0,"Relevant part from the Chancellor’s email: 


>	To guide our future responses to the pandemic, a team of UC San Diego
clinicians, molecular biologists, technologists, infectious disease
experts, bioinformatics specialists, disease modelers, public health
experts, and others has launched a new program called “Return to Learn.”
The initial phase, which begins May 11, is designed to make COVID-19
testing available for the more than 5,000 students who continue to
reside on the UC San Diego campus.

>	Five major components comprise the UC San Diego Return to Learn Program.

>	RISK ASSESSMENT AND MITIGATION
Through comprehensive review of physical and functional aspects of the
UC San Diego campus, we seek new strategies for stratifying and reducing
transmission risk of SARS-CoV-2, such as optimal class sizes and
density, the scope and structure for co-curricular activities, and
appropriate personal behaviors, like physical distancing and the use of
face coverings, to help reduce spread of the virus.

>	PROACTIVE VIGILANCE
We have created rigorous mathematical models for an enhanced viral
monitoring program to help us detect the presence of SARS-CoV-2 on
campus in its earliest stages, possibly before people even know they’re
infected. According to our models, if we are able to successfully test
60 to 90 percent of our campus population for viral infection each month
on a recurring basis, we estimate we have a greater than 90 percent
chance of detecting the spread of SARS-CoV-2 when fewer than 10 persons
among tens of thousands are actively, but unknowingly, shedding viral
particles. This is possible because we are a research university with a
deep reservoir of tools, from innovative sampling techniques to
high-throughput nucleic acid detection platforms to extensive public
health expertise.

>	RAPID RESPONSE
If a testing sample proves positive for SARS-CoV-2, a specially trained,
campus-based public health team will attempt to reach out to that person
to notify them and urge them to seek appropriate health care. The team
will also try to identify and notify persons with whom the infected
person may have had close contact in previous days—an effort known as
exposure notification. As required by law, we will be working closely
with state and local public health officials in all of our responses.

>	TECHNOLOGICAL TOOLS
Recent studies suggest SARS-CoV-2 may be most infectious before symptoms
appear. Therefore, to further enhance chances of catching the virus
early, Return to Learn will also look for viral RNA from residential
wastewater and surface collections. If the virus is detected, molecular
sequence analyses will be used to create a database to help guide public
health measures. By combining information technologies, cutting-edge
epidemiology tools, diverse cellular and molecular sciences, and
traditional public health interventions, our approach offers the
possibility of extraordinary levels of viral control at the population
level.

>	BIG PICTURE
All of these efforts will be integrated to promote early analysis of
viral activity signals and quicker response times. The Return to Learn
program has been designed to identify clusters of individuals shedding
virus or those at greater risk in specific locations, whether in a
residence hall or a particular academic building. That will permit
faster treatment, earlier mitigation of identified issues, and
continuing refinement and improvement of the system.

>	By testing large numbers of UC San Diego students, faculty, and staff on
a recurring basis, we hope to be able to quickly identify COVID-19
infections on campus and perhaps reduce the risk of a significant
outbreak.   

>	... 

>	Students living on campus and critical operations staff currently on
campus will receive an email with instructions on how to participate."

tmobile,fok8nub,t1_fok58m2,1587837458.0,"Hi Jon, 

The frustrating thing for employees is the return to normal hours, and thus the need to fill staffing unnecessarily when traffic is down, coupled with the lack of work-from-home and curbside options. 

Employees were told that there are no virtual positions left, and employees who were trained in virtual stores will get to work from home, with 40% commission. This is frustrating in that the employees who weren’t worried about personal safety and decided to work virtual are now being rewarded for doing so, while employees who are worried about personal safety are now being forced to work in customer-facing positions. 

Everyone appreciates how well T-Mobile has treated employees the last month and a half, but the decision to re-open stores and staff so many positions so early in the pandemic seems like a bizarre one, especially given that many customers are not respecting social distancing guidelines. A second wave of coronavirus is likely to hit, and now more than ever seems like the time to *push* virtual and curbside rather than inhibit it."
sandiego,foiat12,t1_foi6mrq,1587782386.0,"Would you be taking loans to cover the cost of the two years at UCSD? If so, I would choose SDSU. Graduating with little-to-no-debt is, in my opinion, much more valuable than the prestige of UCSD for most programs. 

Contiguous bachelors-masters programs are where you can begin graduate work in your senior year and apply it to masters, so you complete the masters in about one year. You do the masters at the same university and you usually don’t need to take the GRE.

As of Apr. 9 at 9:00 a.m.**

“The current public health emergency associated with the COVID-19 pandemic will impact not only the Spring Quarter, but also our Summer Session.

In order to continue the vital social distancing that contributes to public health, UC San Diego will continue to deliver all instruction by remote means during Summer 2020. This includes all Summer Session courses and Summer Success programs offered by any unit. The Academic Senate has approved an emergency exception to the Policy on Distance Education Courses to allow for remote instruction for the entire duration of Summer Session 2020. Course materials fees will not be applied to Summer Session courses. Enrollment for Summer Session for UC San Diego students begins April 13. More information is available on the Summer Session website.


**Summer Campus Housing**

On-campus housing will remain open and operational for summer session. Students remaining in campus housing will be assigned to single-occupancy spaces.

Students should consider living on campus during summer session ONLY if they satisfy at least one of the following conditions: those who are without access to stable housing; who come from housing/food insecure households; who are unable to travel home; who are from areas highly impacted by COVID-19 or regions at risk for a COVID-19 outbreak; who are unable to relocate without high risk to their safety; and those who would be relocating to homes that lack infrastructure to accommodate virtual instruction.

Students who are remaining on campus for summer are reminded of the importance of physical distancing to further ensure the health and well-being of our community.”"
