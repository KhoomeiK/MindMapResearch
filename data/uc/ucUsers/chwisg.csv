Dodgers,fp71ean,t3_gbnscw,1588362286.0,"I love the Giants because of how much I hate them. The respect is there, brotherly relationship. Astros have no respect from me. They should be forever shamed in the eyes of baseball. Fans are all band wagoners too."

Dodgers,fo99bg0,t3_g6fouv,1587613578.0,2017. So many players who deserved a ring after lengthy careers. 2019 had Roberts depending on too many Rookies. Only one to show up was Lux.

UCSD,fnlr8ju,t3_g2in72,1587058340.0,It‚Äôs terrible man. Classes are legitimately the last thing on my mind. Had an assignment due at 8 yesterday that I completely forgot about and just did not care once I realized it was overdue. Didn‚Äôt even email the professor. I purposely chose clases every week this quarter too so I can get my ass focused when I go to campus. Shits terrible for my procrastination.
