cscareerquestions,foloyjd,t1_folmuxv,1587867078.0,UC Berkeley does offer a BS in Computer Science though... that was part of the point I was trying to get at. Having a BA vs having a BS does not matter.
cscareerquestions,folmkap,t3_g85ixr,1587865515.0,"This is factually incorrect– there are many prestigious schools out there that offer only BAs in Computer Science (e.g., Harvard, Princeton), or have no real distinction between their BA/BS (Columbia, UC Berkeley).

I got my BA in Computer Science at Berkeley, and managed to get an full-time offer from a Big 4 and accepted into CS grad programs at Stanford, CMU, and Berkeley, for example. Out of my other friends who also got BAs in CS at Berkeley, one's headed to MIT for a PhD, one's staying at Berkeley to get a PhD in ML, ~10 are headed to Chicago/NYC to work in finance at Goldman Sachs/Citadel/Jane Street et. al. and dozens are starting work at Big 4/unicorn companies in the fall. At no point did having a BA to our names impact our ability to get into grad schools/job offers, and it is misleading to suggest that."

What most likely will happen is that there will be some sort of hybrid system with ""checkerboard classrooms"" where students are spaced really far apart in class (with reduced discussion capacity), fully online lectures, and allowing students to continue taking classes remotely if they wish."

I know all my friends and I will travel back to Cal to attend the commencement ceremony when it's finally held, and I anticipate most seniors would want to do the same as well."
