He’s done a shit job handling the crisis and only gets praise because he criticizes trump, which ironically just makes it worse off for his state because he gets punished for that. Inslee and Newsom are the ones to look up to. They know how to play the game and shit on trump without being so obvious that he realizes it. They have also led the way and had the best results.

neoliberal,fp1dip9,t1_fp1cynb,1588231926.0,"There was a good article in The Athletic about one of those guys, Three Years Letterman, and it’s about having twitter notifications on your phone and being a quick thinker. Usually they are similar variations of a theme they say all the time. Also, the more engagement they get (likes, replies, retweets) the more it bumps their comments up to the top. So people arguing with them and flaming them makes them more visible."

Usually the responses to him are pictures of him in a Nazi uniform and of him naked drinking his own piss with the comments “drink piss Nazi”. 

Far right is some guy named Scott Presler who goes by /#ThePersistence and is a generic trump spam who also brags about flipping the house or some nonsense.

The hashtag stands for Where We Go One We Go All and it’s the QAnon motto which is a batshit insane Trump cult. Please don’t ask me to explain it I already hate myself for knowing all this as it is."

Also, there is a strategy for a super quick cultural victory that works with like the celts, Ethiopia and some others that I forget where you make a ton of cities and have the policy where every faith building gives tourism. In that case a piety start is the way to go"
