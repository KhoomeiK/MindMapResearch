ucla,fncytsi,t3_g0pz3d,1586852074.0,The Ackerman Union fee likely helps pay workers and keeps things maintained. I work in Ackerman and we’re very lucky to get paid some administrative leave during all of this. I know it sometimes feels like it’s not fair but it is appreciated. Student and career workers alike need the Ackerman budget to help provide salaries and keep stores open.
