I just write myself a check and deposit it from the app and if you do that before 4pm on a business day it's posted that day, but if you like on the west coast like me, if I want to fund my account after midday, it's not going to go through until the next day. You could wire, but fees."
investing,fph7css,t1_fph671w,1588616257.0,Just checked my Charles Schwab app and it has oculus. I've been happy with Schwab. Have a checking account where I can deposit that's directly linked to my trading account and I use that checking account while traveling as there's no ATM or foreign transaction fee.

news,fnm2rfw,t3_g2g4q9,1587064084.0,"Independent contractor here. I couldn't apply until 2 days ago.

First the date for an independent contractor to apply was set to April 10th so I was already late to the party.

Then when I went to apply thru Chase (my own bank) I was told that I could not apply because I do not have a business account. Despite having 1099s, tax returns, everything at the ready I wasn't a business cause my bank account has the wrong prefix. Checked to see if I could change my account to a business account or open one. Nope. The account had to have been made before Feb something.

Went to BOA cause I have a credit card with them...nope.

Everywhere I looked was the same.

Finally 2 days ago I heard Paypal was approved to lend. So I sent my application to them. I was waiting for my application to be processed. Now there's no money.

So I'll go back to where I was before, waiting for my unemployment application to come through.

My mom runs her own business and has less then ten employees. She applied several times and hasn't received anything. I don't have the heart to send her this article. She was the one who kept pushing me to apply. She applied through Bank of America. She helped my uncle do the same. They sat waiting for a week. They didn't know if you don't get an email response within 48hrs your application didn't go through (because the system was overwhelmed?). 

She heard about others already receiving their money through the grapevine, went to BOA to ask what's going on. The workers there had no clue about anything relating to SBA loans. After doing her own research she found out that her loan probably didn't go through. She redid the application. Nothing. She did it again. Nothing. 

Finally a day ago(maybe 2?) she managed to do the second part of the application.

Now she's waiting for the money, which may never come.

______________________________________

These aren't parables, they're not anecdotes, it's my own story and the story of my mother, a small business owner for over 15 years.

I am lucky. I have my health. I'm young, I am just starting my career and business ventures. This is a bump I will overcome. My mom and dad have worked a lifetime, they should be getting ready to sit back and enjoy retirement- to rest on their many achievements. Instead my mom is fighting for money that was supposed to be for people like her in the first place.

So tonight when the briefing comes on and hands are being shook while mission accomplished is declared, when CEOs (who always had handsome pensions and stock options to fall back on) are named off and paraded as the meek and lame who were saved, think of people like me but especially people like my mom. People like her who work Mon-Sat 8am-8pm to make a modest salary at a business they built brick by brick only to be ignored by the very administration who proclaim themselves her savior."
