Responded fast, I signed with them for a lease starting in June. They were really transparent with me when I went to view the units. Submitted my app and got approved the next day. Though I had a similar situation with my security deposit. I submitted it (in the form of a cashiers check dropped off at their office) it wasn’t reflected on my tenant portal for a few weeks. Maybe their accounting process is a bit slow, but they can’t be worse than St George/Campus 880 ( my current landlord) who straight up lost a check for $16K and claimed it wasn’t their fault. I suggest you get on the phone with someone at the office if you can. Do you have email correspondence with them? They can’t refuse the fact that you have a receipt."

I got a lil sickness for the thiccness myself, and the amount of attention people pay to their health/ looks here is a bit intimidating but even at my heaviest (220 lbs) I never felt out of place. Sure, I was a little bit slower on the bike path and that made me self-conscious as people flew past me but that’s pretty much the extent. People at the rec cen are super cool and supportive too!! I made a few friends when I started lifting weights at the MAC. You just have to accept that there are bitches out there that will judge others to make themselves feel better, at the end of the day they aren’t happy with themselves. Appearance is superficial, there’s more to UCSB than beaches and sororities. Your vibe attracts your tribe my dude, surround yourself with wholesome people. There’s plenty of us around! :) 
to summarize: no, you definitely don’t need to be skinny to go here."
UCSantaBarbara,fnxcm72,t3_g4echn,1587335929.0,"I’ve had a couple bad experiences at student health. Got super sick in 2018. Went to multiple appointments because I was getting worse, and all they could say is that I had “the seasonal flu” didn’t run any labs and one doctor even asked if I was faking it. Ended up going to urgent care with septic shock from an untreated infection, stayed in the ICU for a week, flunked my first fall quarter. If I had been diagnosed correctly the first time, I wouldn’t have ended up in cottage health in the beginning stages of organ failure / late stages of septic shock. Eye clinic is hit or miss with customer service , but I gotta say they did get my prescription ready really quick. Also made an appointment for BC consultation, they emailed me the next day asking if I was okay with a group appointment. Nah fam, cancelled."

I’m the 2nd daughter in my family to be sent to UCSB, 3rd interested in a business school pathway. If it weren’t for our financial situation my mother would have sold our family home in a heartbeat to send me to college."
