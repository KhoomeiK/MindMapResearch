In my experience deans are actually super helpful and efficient, and a lot of the advisors are spread too thin and can’t keep up with the influx of requests."

My body doesn’t store fat on my abs, and if I don’t drink sparkling water (lol it makes me super bloated) I usually have pretty defined ab muscles. HOWEVER my body DOES store fat on my butt and thighs. I’m still deeply self conscious and fight the societally ingrained urges to pick myself apart in front of the mirror despite one part of my body having a desirable look. Truly, it’s all mental and until we fix our mindsets we’ll never be happy ❤️"
