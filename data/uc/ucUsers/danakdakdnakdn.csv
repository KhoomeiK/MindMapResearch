As with most competitive things, it takes years of practice to get to the level that will catch the eyes of top firms.  Projects will help with applying anywhere if you can talk about them at length and they're somewhat relevant to the job, but they're more important for swe I'd say.  A lot of what they're looking for in a quant is creativity and that you're really smart/good with math.  Personally, I would just be told where to find data for a certain asset class, and to analyze it and report back.  Completely open ended, but being strong with stats and ML was usually key.  Super dependent on the company how much you'll be touching the tech stack, some people I know as quant researchers do a lot of the coding/optimization for their own strategies whereas the swes do infrastructure, and at other companies quants will have teams of developers to write the implementations for them.

I prepped by reading everything and everything regarding probability.  I think JS or 2S has some resources on their website for this.  Also less important but I read up on derivatives as well.  Finally, because different firms all operate differently, I'd prepare for each individually by reading up on Glassdoor or talking to people that work/worked there.

As mentioned above, ML is kind of the crux of work you'll do.  Its how you apply stats/prob in a clever way.  NLP on the other hand I never really dealt with and think is less common, so I'd say thats more like icing on the cake."
cscareerquestions,fpefkye,t1_fpee60f,1588546595.0,"Depends on the firm in terms of “second class”.  There’s different levels of algorithmic trading from high to low, and basically the more a company relies on arbitrage/speed level events the more important developers are.  Most companies have a good mix though.  

Most places as well it’s probably easier to have a position in swe and to transfer into quant instead of applying into it directly, especially if you’re more skilled with software than statistics.  In terms of resume I’d say there isn’t too much u can target specifically for quant roles unless you can win a math/competing programming competition.  Just get really good at mental math and statistics because those are the questions you’ll be asked.  

As far as targeting swe in terms of resume, any finance related project will help a little, but main skills of interested are distributed systems, FPGA programming, networking, which you probably won’t get til later years of school.  Source: quant research intern experience."

Also, if you’re being hit on a lot you’re probably attractive (and smart woah) so I’d think it’s not specific to guys just in CS.  Being creepy isn’t excusable but I feel like CS guys might just not be experienced talking to girls, so they may come off wrong, cut em some slack as long as it’s not over the top."
anime,foznjo0,t3_gaakux,1588193639.0,"Damn just watched all 5 episodes now and I’ve really enjoyed the series so far.  Nothing incredibly standout so far, but captivating nonetheless. Major HxH vibes."
Animedubs,fosdoae,t3_g93rh6,1588028676.0,Ayy was planning to start mob glad I can catch it weekly now along with paranoia agent
Toonami,fonjm1s,t3_g88zio,1587920745.0,"I really liked it.  I think having shows like this is what will really bring me back into watching Toonami every single week.  I know a lot of people probably like black clover, but because it’s such a long show I have no interest in watching episode 30 or whatever it’s on now on toonami.  I’d much rather have a new shorter series start in one of the time slots every other week or something so there’s something for me to be excited about"
csMajors,fojzc9s,t1_foiweuu,1587832419.0,Yeah it’ll suffice I just meant there’s room to learn it on your own even using a template.  I personally added php to have a contact me form that would just email me and used JavaScript for some interactive mini games because I wanted some exposure to those languages.
csMajors,foigzqw,t3_g7kgc5,1587786425.0,I would recommend taking a template and customizing from there.  You’ll probably at least learn basic HTML/CSS/JS/PHP that way and still have something that looks really pretty.
cscareerquestions,fo7vhm5,t1_fo76afs,1587585248.0,"I hope this is true, but unfortunately I’ve only had the opposite experiences. Me AND one of my friends have had an experience where we were told we did not receive interviews because we were too talkative during an interview. The sad truth is a lot of people you’ll come across were hired solely on technical prowess, and when your interviewer lacks good social skills small talk makes them uncomfortable.  

There was another interviewer I wasn’t directly told I didn’t get the offer because of a joke, but I’m almost positive that was the reason. The interviewer mentioned how they wanted to switch away from certain code and I said that’s funny, I was quite experienced in that area because I had to implement it at a different company so it’s ironic I’d get paid to do the opposite now. The interviewers english wasn’t very strong and kept thinking I was trying to say it was a good way of doing things."
anime,fo6dv70,t1_fo5rtad,1587555901.0,"I agree with this completely.  I wouldn’t say it’s a ton but I think I’ve got around 75 days worth of anime watched according to MAL which feels more than casual to me, but I’ve only completed 21 on this list with 26 that I’ve at least tried.  Some of these I’ve heard a lot about, but usually I’ve got a backlog of anime I want to watch already that seem more interesting for simple reasons like genre, so it’s hard to get to everything."
UIUC,fnv2wrf,t3_g2hkn9,1587278474.0,"I think 233,225,357 and a gened would be fine, but I wouldn’t keep 210 if you’re going to add 357 or 361. The reason being every single one of those classes has assignments and or quizzes weekly.  I took 233,225, and 357 together and it was a nightmare keeping track of things."
UIUC,fnuxovw,t1_fnuwqxi,1587273931.0,"A lot of useful code is given to you, it would be much more difficult to do something like this from scratch. For the mosaics like the one posted here, the idea is that you chunk up an image into small pieces, take the average color, and then from a list of different images you have, pick the one who’s average color is the closest."
