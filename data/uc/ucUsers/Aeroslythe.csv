If it seems reasonable and you‚Äôre feeling confident then I say go for it. That feeling of failure stings a lot less when you appreciate that you bet on yourself; it feels a lot worse to know you doubted yourself and missed the A, imo."

berkeley,fpji4bh,t1_fpjcyhe,1588669354.0,"Yeah normally that‚Äôs totally true, but this semester the choice to include the grade in the deceleration gpa calculation is separate from whether the course is P/NP"
berkeley,fpixr3o,t1_fpixl8x,1588651248.0,That‚Äôs exactly why I‚Äôm asking lol! It‚Äôs probably unrealistic
berkeley,fpixc72,t1_fpix65z,1588650952.0,Thank you for the encouragement! I suppose I should probably not stress about it so much. My thought in favor of P/NP is that if I average above 3.7 then it‚Äôd be in my favor and if I go below that then the additional A- probably wouldn‚Äôt matter to me that much anyway
berkeley,fpiwfb5,t1_fpiw1mq,1588650313.0,"Don‚Äôt get me wrong I‚Äôm stoked to have secured that letter, but I‚Äôm just thinking of the math that goes into overall gpa. If I keep it above 3.7 then even an A- will ultimately count against me. Kind of outrageous to think about but... such is cal"
berkeley,fpiwbrk,t1_fpivxna,1588650242.0,"Literally fail? I‚Äôm assuming you mean if I end up with a gpa lower than 3.7, but that‚Äôs a far cry from failing"
berkeley,fpiw9ch,t1_fpiv6al,1588650196.0,"I see what you‚Äôre saying, it‚Äôs true it removes ambiguity and perhaps ambiguity is in the student‚Äôs favor in this situation. Although, maybe the context is pretty significant too. If the mixed-choice student has great grades otherwise, to the point where a C would be an outlier, I think I wouldn‚Äôt assume that the P/NP would be much worse than their average. I kind of see it as a fill-in-the-blank assumption for every P/NP, where the fill-in will be based on the impression the application has made overall. Strong overall performance predicts that the P/NPs were probably we‚Äôre drastically off from the trend and the result of the unfortunate circumstances of the times

Edit: idk why you were downvoted I think your points are at the very least respectful and reasonable"
berkeley,fpiudmq,t1_fpiipyx,1588648926.0,"So classes you P/NP, you probably wouldn‚Äôt have gotten an A in, that‚Äôs a given. But what I still don‚Äôt get is why is taking them all P/NP better than mixed? For all anyone could know the person who did full P/NP barely passed any of their classes, and the one who mixed got like an A- or maybe even ended up with an A for the ones they picked. I guess maybe it shows the mixed person had more of an opportunity to try? Idk it doesn‚Äôt make sense to me"
berkeley,fpitaal,t1_fphnwlb,1588648219.0,"I just don‚Äôt get why that isn‚Äôt a given. Who ISNT trying to manipulate their gpa, always? Why would it be looked down upon? I mean sure if that‚Äôs where all your focus goes that‚Äôs not good ofc but there‚Äôs certainly nothing wrong with trying to maximize your gpa"

berkeley,fp5c1fk,t1_fp56df9,1588323733.0,"Hey I also took CS10 during the fall and then 61a and agree it offered great prep. Data8 is a lot more about using programming to do data science and CS10 is a pure, broadstrokes overview of computer science. If you‚Äôre looking for prep for 61a, CS10 is a much better choice because it actually teaches about computer science fundamentals and gives you an intro to Python, which is the language 61a almost exclusively uses. Data8 also uses Python, but only for the functional purpose of data analysis, so it won‚Äôt teach you much about actual programming.

Sorry that was rambly it‚Äôs like 2am and I have nothing better to do with my life than drunkenly write Internet scrawl"
berkeley,fp4r8i9,t1_fp4kqey,1588305403.0,These are the important questions
berkeley,fp4aovi,t3_gb7z74,1588295070.0,"The math works out so that you basically would only want to *NOT* P/NP if either is true:

1) You expect to push up against the PNP limit in the future by taking near a third of your classes as PNP. This option doesn‚Äôt really matter right now because the Uni is relaxing the limit for this semester.

2) You expect to have an overall GPA lower than a 2.7. This is entirely based on you, but if you consider a B- to be on the low side of your grades (I would guess this as 61a is an above-average difficulty class) then not PNPing a B- will only weigh down your gpa.

TL;DR: if B- is lower than what you plan on your average grade being, P/NP it."

berkeley,foodh9d,t3_g8an1k,1587937025.0,"Reading this post I wanted to put out the question,

How do you make friends in your CS classes? They‚Äôre all so big and so online focused I have no idea how I could do it other than ‚Äúcold calling‚Äù and just sitting next to some random guy or girl in the giant lecture hall.

Anyone have any advice on this?"
berkeley,foobyl2,t1_foo4xn3,1587936284.0,I‚Äôm a Freshman who didn‚Äôt even want to do CS coming in but found that I really liked it after taking CS10. So now I‚Äôm conflicted between more strongly pursuing CS or fully committing to my other really strong passion for therapy. Luckily I can kind of do both without killing myself but OMFG why are so many people who do CS (and Econ and Haas from my experience) incapable of doing something ‚Äúunproductive‚Äù?? You said how hard it is to not be affected by that atmosphere and I relate to that so hard. It makes me feel bad for doing other things I enjoy üòû
