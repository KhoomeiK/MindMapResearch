UCSD,fc4jsv8,t3_eg5lqq,1577418731.0,"Math 20E is vector calculus so only the first part is a review of calc III or called 20c here. ECE 35 is a very difficult class, the material isn’t too hard but the tests are very difficult. So I’m guessing the waiver exam will be pretty difficult, I would suggest taking the class since it’s a good foundation. ECE 15 isn’t too bad if you know the basics of coding. Good luck m8 from a fellow ece transfer :) Side note if you transfer next fall there will be Ece waiver exams before the quarter starts"
