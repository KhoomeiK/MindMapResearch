UCSD,fp9x4lg,t3_gc3ilu,1588436380.0,"I just got email saying they are pausing processing apps.

Your submission is received, saved, and we will circle back to each student as we determine additional emergency fund support.
In the meantime please feel free to connect with our other basic needs resources as supplemental support."
UCSD,fp9wrxy,t3_gc0il6,1588436173.0,I just got an email telling me that they are pausing applications to determine whether any financial aid is still available. Wow.
UCSD,fp9trqn,t1_fp962qa,1588434386.0,Nothing for me and I applied a week ago.
UCSD,fp8i6xj,t3_gbsjjk,1588392947.0,I got 2000 grant and 2050 Pell grant. I took four courses. If I didn't stay on campus it would have been cheaper but I needed housing so I had to take a loan too.
UCSD,fp8hu3q,t3_gc02bp,1588392681.0,Why not stay in and do a P/NP on it?
UCSD,fp8hqq9,t1_fp8fzym,1588392613.0,How long ago did you apply and how long did it take. I knew I should have applied when I first saw it. Probably missed out.
UCSD,fp8d3me,t1_fp84cp3,1588389304.0,Did yuu receive $1500 too?
UCSD,fp8d1tw,t1_fp896bc,1588389271.0,Thanks for the info. üëç
UCSD,fp7qowb,t1_fp7mtuv,1588375814.0,I filled mine out Monday and never even received an email I had applied? Should I resubmit do you think?
UCSD,fp4d5ca,t1_fp46cso,1588296517.0,They said in press announcement an in person one will be held at a later time.
UCSD,fp0itx3,t3_galunt,1588210133.0,Yes but you can stay on campus too.
UCSD,fow683x,t1_fovjshs,1588113771.0,I believe they will postpone as well. Hoping they still have one tho and not a virtual one. I would like a real one.
UCSD,fook296,t3_g8nml3,1587940521.0,Are you taking it for a specific reason?
UCSD,fooir74,t1_foodd84,1587939771.0,https://basicneeds.ucsd.edu/covid/index.html
UCSD,fooed17,t1_foocyik,1587937456.0,Did she say how much it was?
UCSD,fo5esa1,t1_fo5bpa2,1587523907.0,"It probably came from a combination of both your loans and your grants. If it's loans you don't have to begin paying it back until at least six months after graduation. At this rate though, the government will probably end up forgiving some of them as part of another stimulus package."
UCSD,fo582bf,t3_g5300v,1587519540.0,Is it from a loan?
UCSD,fnssr4v,t1_fnspn6q,1587228095.0,I stand corrected. I do think they are distributing it through covid 19 financial request form.  https://basicneeds.ucsd.edu/covid/index.html#COVID-19-Financial-Relief-Reque
UCSD,fnqet7y,t1_fnpxm37,1587163195.0,"The money was given only to for profit schools, ie private schools. Not sure what public universities got. UCSD does have a  covid 19 financial request form students can fill out to get money if they lost their on campus jobs etc."
UCSD,fnqe617,t1_fnq983f,1587162842.0,They did in the email they sent.
UCSD,fnqdshd,t3_g3aipf,1587162633.0,"Summer is going to be online. You probably could still take them. This is what I found on one of the college's site about retracting your DDA. Doesn't sound like a big deal to do this. ""If after filing the DDA you find that you made a mistake OR you realize you are not able to complete your degree in the quarter you declared, message Revelle Advising through the¬†Virtual Advising Center¬†to request for your DDA to be retracted."""
UCSD,fn8h25n,t1_fn8b2qz,1586741478.0,The UCSD grant isn't based on whether or not you're on campus I believe. I think it just goes toward tuition. That was $2100 and my Pell was 2032. The Pell is one third of what you got during the year.
UCSD,fn89fi5,t3_g07lxi,1586736716.0,I took two courses each session last year. I received a grant from UCSD and additional Pell grant that they now offer for summer school. I also had to take additional loans because I stayed on campus etc.
UCSD,fn88aoa,t3_g07f2k,1586736032.0,What plan did you you have
UCSD,fmui2ib,t1_fmuf6q1,1586391828.0,"If you had used any portion of your spring dining dollars, they charge you for them. So if you had started with $1700 in dining dollars, that would allow you $566 per quarter. If you used all first and second quarter plus any part of spring quarter, you would be charged for using those."
UCSD,fmqwi9t,t3_fwwg7u,1586308581.0,"With the TA strike ongoing and grades delayed, I would imagine they stopped the automatic drops from happening."
UCSD,fmn0whn,t3_fw9f8r,1586215891.0,I would have stayed on campus. Everyone has a private room and it's deserted.
UCSD,fmmj7y9,t1_fmmj24e,1586206257.0,Also I applied for food stamps and was almost immediately approved. $194 a month. Give that a shot too.
