My name is Deven Streeton and I am running for USAC transfer student representative.

I know it won’t come as a shock to many of you on this subreddit. Yet again the Daily Bruin has favored For the People over other slates. Both of us are transfer students, they chose not endorse me because I lack experience with USAC. I am a transfer student running for transfer rep! How could I possibly have experience working on USAC? It is my first year at UCLA, I’m still trying to find my footing. They note that Zuleika also lacks that experience (with USAC), but somehow it’s not an issue. **They do note her involvement with transfer clubs on campus which is great, but they willfully ignore my previous experiences.** They don’t think I can handle student government. In community college, I was the co-president of the Honors Transfer Club. We organize trips to nearby campuses, as well as offering support on navigating college and the university application process. I currently work for a non-profit that helps low-income, and marginalized youth come together to create art. My duties range from administrative work as well as hands on activities with kids during the summer. Most notably providing support and a place to hone art amongst LGBTQ+ and foster youths. Additionally, I spent three years of high school on my school’s Honors Thespian (theater) board, serving as Vice President of our club. I was also the head producer of my school’s weekly broadcast news. I know how to work with peers as well as produce quality projects in alignment with a deadline.

The only negative they had about my campaign is false. This is a woeful bias on the part of the Daily Bruin. They continue to favor For the People over other slates and independent candidates. It is clear that whoever is writing for the Daily Bruin is very ignorant to the experiences of transfers. I have achieved a lot, I have worked incredibly hard to be at UCLA. **Just because my work in clubs has been done at a previous institution does not lessen my qualifications, rather it heightens it.** I have worked with diverse groups of people. In high school, I worked for three years with very strong personalities. In community college, I worked with people from different age groups, different cultures, different backgrounds.

My slate Cost-Cutting Innovations has been attacked endlessly through this election cycle. But we rise above, because we know we are better than petty comments and cyberbullying. Rather than focusing on the negative I saw an opportunity to address you, the student body with my truth.

**So please vote this week!** It is up to you guys to make sure our voices are heard! We need new perspectives in USAC. They have created a perpetual circle where the same point of view is repeated over and over and rhetoric never gains new voices. So please vote between today and Friday for me Deven Streeton, a proud member of Cost-Cutting Innovations, as transfer rep!! We want to make your voice heard!

For clarification, this post is meant to highlight the disparity between how Daily Bruin covers Orion vs other USAC councilmembers’ accomplishments which were unable to be executed due to COVID-19 campus closure. 

Why is Orion being disparaged, while Lily gets praised even though both of them weren’t able to carry out their projects? Why the double standard?"
