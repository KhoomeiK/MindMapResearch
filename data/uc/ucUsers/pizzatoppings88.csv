I'm sure they will accommodate if you can't take the midterm on the new day, just communicate with them. You can't really complain without suggesting a solution. Being mad about taking another midterm is not a solution.

Also, something you might want to learn as soon as possible is that ""fairness"" doesn't exist in life. Life is not fair. Just try to find possible solutions and move forward."

I didn't just ""make it sound"" like you can get a part-time degree for a fraction of the cost. I'm literally saying it

I'm graduating from a professional program and over 80% of the people that I know that are getting a new job, are switching career tracks. The opportunity is not as prevalent for part-time MBAs, sure, but it's still very, very prevalent (at least at a well-ranked school)

I know people see full-time MBAs as a ""low-risk investment."" That's why what I said is a ""secret."" People haven't realized how much of a rip off it is yet.

MBA,fpfoakj,t3_gd53wv,1588577641.0,"Let me tell you a secret. The full-time programs aren't worth it anymore. You've hit the nail on the head. If you go to a top program with zero savings, you'll graduate with $200-250K+ in debt. That's almost medical school level of debt. But unless you go into IB, you won't be making doctor-level salaries. It's a huge rip-off that takes advantage of people. Worst of all, you'll be heavily pressured to go into certain industries instead of what you are passionate about, simply because how the huge your debt will be when you graduate.

Guess what though? Part-time programs are severely, severely undervalued right now. You get the same degree and same salary at a fraction of the cost. I'll be graduating from the same program, but the full-timers will have triple if not quadruple the amount of debt that I have.

MBA,fp8mler,t3_gbvhey,1588396395.0,"Amazon is a highly desirable firm because of the FAANG reputation and its presence on your resume. If you are aiming to be a product manager in the future having Amazon as your past work history is going to be a boon. 

Compared to IB though? That's such a weird comparison. You'll work 80-100 hours a week for IB but make 50-100% more money. The work is also completely different, you'll be doing modeling and finance in IB versus operations and management at Amazon. They aren't really that comparable. It's more based on what you want in your life and what you can handle.

I dropped my interviews at Amazon once I got an offer in consulting because I wanted to go into consulting. I know people who accepted offers at Amazon who would never even consider consulting. You're comparing apples with oranges. So to answer your comparison question, they aren't really comparable. They're totally different industries.

In regards to more achievable and less desired, I will say that Amazon has a reputation of overworking their employees. It's tough to work for Amazon, definitely not for everybody. If you're a warehouse manager it seems like your life is hell. It's so bad for warehouse managers that they literally give a second signing bonus that kicks in if you survive for one year. Other tech companies like Apple and Adobe don't do that. So yea, Amazon has a tough work life balance depending on the role."

MBA,fp6dnv8,t1_fp5v28l,1588350547.0,"I see someone still remembers their business school readings. I have never seen anyone describe the MBA as a two-sided market before but it's true. Business school is the platform that connects prospects to companies (if we're ignoring the people that are just looking for a fancy piece of paper). Gonna nerd out on this concept for a bit:

On the one side, you have the subsidized population, or companies looking to hire. Companies don't pay business schools for this opportunity. They participate in the economy for free, otherwise, they would look to hire through other channels (if anything MBA hires have been trending down year after year). On the other side of the platform are the students or job-seekers. Due to the upside of an increased salary, societal pressures, and pivot opportunities, students are willing to pay a huge premium to participate in the market. Students are thus the ""money"" population or what drives the economy. The network effects are strong. More students mean a stronger alumni pool, which drives more students and companies to participate. More companies participating drive more students to join as well. The more students and companies, the stronger the platform. There are both direct and indirect network effects or in other words same-side and opposide-side effects.

COVID will affect the company side of the market. During a recession companies simply don't hire as much. This will incur a negative cross-network effect, or in other words, cause students to not want to go to business school. Which drives the overall value of the market down. However, this would be a temporary effect. I would say lasting a few years at maximum."

Overall you also need to be more positive. Just try your best. That's all you can ask yourself. If things work out, great. If not, work harder. Don't be self-defeating.

The market outlook for consulting is not too bad. I've always thought of consulting as pretty market-agnostic. When the market is doing well, consultants are needed to make things more efficient.

Even if he threw a metal pipe they could easily dodge it at that range. You might think that's enough risk to execute a man but I don't"
houston,fov65u8,t3_g9q94n,1588096015.0,"Holy shit man. They straight up executed him as firing-squad. He was literally on his knees, hands up, multiple feet away. No threat. What the fuck. The articles are saying he had a metal pipe in his hand. I guess that's enough to shoot him up like a dog?"

I guess that's expected if you went to a Texas school.

Doesn't matter how closely the public watches. These police officers are egregious and the union protects them no matter what. Just after 5 seconds of googling I found this recent article: https://www.cbsnews.com/news/officer-fired-twice-from-one-police-department-became-chief-of-another/"

todayilearned,fojvwnn,t1_fojs2mq,1587830478.0,"Most other countries in the world, in fact every single first world country, is able to do much, much better in regards to recidivism and the number of people in prison, while also having less gun violence or even less violence overall. This idea you have that more wrath prevents prisoners is absolutely false if you even took 1 minute to look at the numbers. The US has literally the most prisoners in the world. Do we have the least amount of crime? Absolutely not.

Overall you represent America very well. You think illogically and based on emotion, while I believe in numbers, statistics, rehabilitation, and that people can change."
todayilearned,fojqjvy,t1_fojnccv,1587827255.0,"If it rehabilitates them, sure.

What's the alternative? Lock them up for 20 years? Kill them? Americans favor wrath over healing, which has led to 80% of convicts going back to prison when they are released. This idea that you should ruin a person's life instead of finding a way to help and heal has led to the US having the most prisoners out of any other country on Earth. We have more people in prison than China. In fact, we actually have almost the same amount of people in prison as China and Russia combined."
todayilearned,fojpvjm,t1_fojop75,1587826832.0,It's impossible for 100% of convicted felons to be actually guilty of their crimes. Our justice system isn't perfect. There are entire non-profit organizations that exist to help get innocent people out of their convicted crimes. And you somehow support cruel and unusual punishment? You are either an idiot or not realistic

gadgets,fod0a48,t1_foch51i,1587678234.0,"Not necessarily. Going well today doesn't always translate to going well tomorrow. That's literally why I brought up Intel. Intel did very very well too. In fact they used to make more than just chips, they were market leaders for RAM and motherboards at one point. But those failed eventually. And that's just one example. If Apple chips are not competitive for Macbooks it wouldn't be the first failed pivot. Outsourcing to specialized firms is a valid strategy that helped create enterprises"
gadgets,fobrvek,t1_fob85d0,1587662992.0,"There are huge risks to developing your own chips. AMD outsources the development of their chips and is now gaining market share on Intel due to their superior technology. Intel is now on a multi-year drought of any innovative chips and it's starting to look like AMD has a real chance of taking the market.

Apple is taking on the same risk as Intel by developing its own chips. There's obvious reward but there are risks too."
