Add on top of that that property tax in San Mateo county is apportioned to cities in a manner meant to be proportional to pre-1978 (Prop 13) levels, so if you got, say, 13% of all property tax revenue in SMC in 1976, you get that same 13% in 2020, regardless of whether your city in particular built anything new. (But if another city in SMC built a lot, you still get a cut!)

And if you're suggesting that they'll allow new housing to get developer fees to balance the books, that well of money will likely dry up with this recession. Bay Area cities are probably already leaning too heavily on it as-is. That's the primary reason most of the projects that are built are the enormous block-sized ones: larger developers have more money to throw at cities to get them to play ball.

The biggest issue I see is that VTA is going with the wildly-expensive TBM method as opposed to cut-and-cover simply because they're afraid of local business pushback due to surface traffic disruption. But that's based on outdated cut-and-cover methods that leave an open pit during construction (or just local business leaders not knowing shit about tunnel construction, which is likely), which other places (like Milan) have innovated past. It's just frustrating that ""local business pushback"" (without the recession caused by the Coronavirus) would have been enough to convince VTA to try something that has literally never been done before instead of using best practices developed elsewhere. Now at least they're going with something that's wildly expensive, but has been done at least one other place?

I think that circling the Bay with BART is rendered unnecessary by CalTrain electrification. I'll concede your point that currently CalTrain to BART transfers are miserable, but the frequency gains due to electrification will help with that. And I guarantee it's cheaper and more useful to just make the agencies cooperate than it is to build an entire redundant rail line up the most expensive real estate in the country.

The main reason BART claims to want the Santa Clara extension is so they can build a maintenance yard there instead of deadheading back to Hayward, but even for that I think there are better options."

It was an absurdly boneheaded design. 

If they had half a brain they'd be doing [Milan-style cut-and-cover](http://www.metro4.hu/en/how-is-it-constructed/station-building), and cancel the redundant extension from Diridon to Santa Clara, but here we are."
