Males who have slightly higher spatial and symbolic reasoning are often that way because they have a bit of autism and will therefore have trouble interpreting social interactions. This doesn't excuse the behavior, but it might help you understand it a bit.

My advice would be to join clubs. I'm not sure if you're eligible for UPE but I really enjoyed that group and while I was there women were well represented. Find other esoteric hobbies that interest you and look for friends there as the other poster said. I'm not sure what else I can say but good luck, sorry ðŸ˜°"
