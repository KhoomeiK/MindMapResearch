For the fall you might be able to find a lab, but this quarter is probably just not going to be possible. One idea is that if you have an idea of a lab or topic that's particularly interesting to you, you could email a professor and let them know that you're interested in their work and hope to find a lab position in the fall, and ask them if they have some reading they might recommend for you while you're working from home this quarter and in the summer. Starting that conversation would look great and might increase your chances of finding a spot in their lab in the fall."
