Just because turn signals aren't always required by law doesn't change the fact that it's easier for me to drive when everyone does use them. Can you provide an instance where it is detrimental to road safety to use turn signals?"

news,foxf7ma,t1_fowtxha,1588142160.0,"Those “traditional theaters” are still my favorite. I love them. On an opening night there’s actually room for everyone, you don’t have to pay an extra $2 to pre book your $16-30 electric seat which is one of 50-100 seats in what was a 150-300 seat theater before they messed it up. You can actually put the arm rest up and lean on whoever you go with and be pretty comfortable as opposed to having a metal bar covered with a ¼” of foam and pleather down the center because they think everyone just wants to stay separate even for the double electric recliners meant for you and a SO. They charge a decent price and I actually didn’t feel like I am getting ripped off. I hate the stupid luxury fancy BS. I just want a movie, popcorn, and an ICEE for $20. I don’t want to be out $40 because of all the stupid crap I have to go through. I also hate having to plan out my trip to the theater cause there’s only the 50 seats now so you can’t just go because everything is sold out all the time even on weekdays.

If that traditional theater is charging at high rates then I do understand the sentiment but I know of multiple in my area that do not and I appreciate them."
tmobile,fopbaej,t1_fop2nfm,1587957263.0,"TIL Spigen isn’t expensive like I remember it to be. 

My past two random cases from unknown, made-up brands have been cheaper (although not as substantially as I remember — I remember paying $60 for a hard shell case for a MacBook from Spigen before I knew that similar quality ones existed on Amazon for $10-20 without a brand) and have lasted me as long as name brand cases have. I do have to say that it’s definitely a lot easier to just search for Spigen over doing 5-10 minutes of searching to find a good no brand item but usually I can find one I like for cheaper (I also usually buy phones at launch and prices are usually higher then — it does depend — the SE is using the same form factor so the price isn’t as inflated) but I would have to agree that they seem to be a great recommendation for cheap cases."
tmobile,fooxomy,t1_foowoio,1587948662.0,"You say a case that’s not overpriced and then proceed to list a name brand company. Go on amazon and find a one piece **thick TPU clear case** with corner protection (none of the ones that say super thin or have multiple pieces that are like the life proof [read: a couple of month proof] cases) for $5 on prime. The only thing the Spigen case is going to have is the name on it (and if you go for the cheapest Spigen, less protection)."

ucla,foeivg8,t1_foedith,1587704932.0,"If they used their own account they should probably confess because, if I remember right, Chegg allows universities access to account information in academic dishonesty investigation. (Then again there’s the chance that UCLA isn’t going to go through with an investigation out of laziness but that’s probably not something to count on because some people have more time than normal to do stuff like that right now)"
ucla,fo9divm,t1_fo93wu4,1587616588.0,"I got a 5 on AP Calc AB. I’m confused though — you’re talking about potentially skipping this course but then also about not only taking it at UCLA but also a CC. If I were you I don’t think it’s worth the money to do it at a CC. That college credit means nothing at UCLA if you plan on being in engineering and would potentially prevent UCLA from allowing you to take the course at UCLA as they may think of it as you trying to retake a course you have already passed.  (I didn’t transfer any CC credits though so ask someone else about credit transfer) If you want to do summer classes at a CC make sure it will transfer to something useful not something that UCLA is offering to let you skip — aka find some lower divs that could transfer but save your GEs for UCLA if you plan to do engineering. They may say that GEs are easiest to transfer but all of my friends that blew through their GEs first year end up having to take many upper divs at the same time towards the end of their degree which can be more stressful. Plan it out to do one GE a year (and do the fifth GE in your third or fourth year — or do study abroad next summer — plan that out ASAP though I didn’t plan it out cause I thought I had time and then I couldn’t do it without sacrificing a chance to do an internship so do it your first year summer or second year fall (or later but just make sure it’s planned out super early)).

If you don’t want to do engineering still check and make sure the credit for a CC will transfer but just take some GEs or an eligible math or science course if there are any."
ucla,fo92nh1,t1_fo8msjb,1587609158.0,"Depending on your professor it could be a GPA boost. Personally, I didn't skip 31A and was bored sitting towards the back the entire quarter. The professor gave a pop quiz Wednesday 2PM the day before Thanksgiving, but I did get an A in the course which led to a good GPA for my first quarter and continues to help me reach GPA minimums for scholarships, internships, and my full-time job offers (it's been really close occasionally). I know other people who struggled through it and were drastically unprepared by their high school and it was not a GPA boost. So it definitely goes both ways but I retook and it was the right choice for me."

ucla,fnqls3x,t1_fnq9gmy,1587167178.0,"Although I think you have a good cause, even $0.33/quarter isn’t something that we should be committing the UCLA populace to have to pay into perpetuity. If USAC wants to fund you, they can find funding from somewhere for you with fees we currently pay, not from an increase (in my opinion, these fees should be cut). Sorry, but I will be voting against this fee."
ucla,fn4bbz7,t1_fn48ejm,1586637873.0,"When your prof says this that means that you need to send an email to them now, not the day before it’s due or when it’s due or for the second assignment. Just say “Here’s the current situation and I believe (or don’t) that it should change by the due date but I just want to have this in writing to make sure you know what’s happening.”"

tmobile,fmrhbhg,t3_fwyx8h,1586323196.0,"The one line pricing makes no sense. How is T-mobile supposed to make money off of single subscribers on Magenta Mini — they will already have some loss with T-mobile Connect? The current Essentials plan is $60. Also why allow users to upgrade for $10? Since 5G won’t be noticeable in lots of areas reliably for quite a bit, this model doesn’t work as no one will buy the add on twice and could cause customer relations snafus.

A current customer on Essentials can still get 100+ mbps on non peak. This would limit this and makes the Uncarrier seem more like an awful ISP (Comcast,Spectrum,...) which is not the move. Right now, plan prices are based on data included and then the extras included & streaming quality — not overall speed access. I think switching to a more user-noticeable built-in throttling would be a bad move for a non-MVNO.

I’m opposed to this pricing model — for both T-mobile investor (too cheap for singles) and customer (Sprint and T-Mobile merged so they could create nationwide 5G to serve their customers, charging extra for access was not part of that plan) perspectives. Sorry, but please try again."
Sprint,fmpmwnf,t1_fmpiu4k,1586283673.0,The $300 bonus requires a port in. Find something you can port out like the temp # on a mint mobile trial SIM card. Then make sure to go to [sprint.com/offers](sprint.com/offers) to redeem it.

tmobile,fmaeg1r,t1_fma7id0,1585891486.0,"I just did it on the 31st. It’s unclear as to when service for Sprint will merge into T-Mobile (“day 1”). So in this period of post “day 0” but pre “day 1”, you will be stuck with Sprint’s slower speeds if you’re in an area with good Sprint coverage as your phone on Sprint will see T-Mobile as in-network roaming but still prefer Sprint towers for now. I was able to pick up a SIM card at an open Sprint store(check their website store locator not Google for currently open shops), wiped it down with a Clorox wipe, got it activated with no activation fee using Sprint phone support, and then registered for the gift card after activating it at [Sprint Promotions Hub — Use Code: 300BYOD313](http://sprint.com/offers). This promo website seems to be down right now so you’ll probably want to confirm with Sprint Chat or Telesales that the promo is still active. (The other person is right that the promo terms did say till the 9th). Also note that Sprint Kickstart doesn’t have any included hotspot (right now it does for COVID-19, but won’t in the future). If you don’t like Sprint you’ll have to wait at least 3, maybe 4 months to get the MasterCard so it’s at least that long of a commitment and you probably won’t qualify for T-Mobile switching promos after."
