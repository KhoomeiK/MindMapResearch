I had two individuals overseas have some screaming in the mic and some good ole fashioned trolling I guess.

Good luck in your ranked games.

I understand morals do come into play for a situation like this. I’ve been dealing with this situation for a while now and even made a post on r/legaladvice even though it’s not getting any traction.

I also think it’s impossible to find another individual to take over that lease spot because of the coronavirus as well. Everyone is citing COVID-19 as their main problem, but I think people should stick to their leases.

Just my two cents."
