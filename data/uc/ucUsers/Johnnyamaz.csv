beatsaber,fopcfwz,t1_fop8sfm,1587958041.0,"I didn't say getting an A homie. My #249 83.5% on king of lions shouldn't be worth only 293pp when a #501 90.7% on AO infinity gives me 316pp. I mean hell, it's worth more than my higher ranking score on a harder map of the same song (#337 87.94% AO infinity worth 312pp). For most songs being ranked, it's pretty random whether someone my skill level will benefit from playing it based on whether or not #500 is at 86% or 93%."
beatsaber,foohkbq,t1_foobae1,1587939084.0,What? Getting a worthless amount of points for any 400+ pp songs if you're below 86% is totally fair. It shouldn't matter that it's in the top 300 on that leaderboard if it's only a measly 83% /s

ElectricalEngineering,fnql9nz,t1_fnqjj7o,1587166876.0,Yup that's the source I found too. It's bafflingly convaluted in pspice.
ElectricalEngineering,fnql3i0,t1_fnqig5p,1587166774.0,What I described is the GUI way of doing that in pspice I'm pretty sure. It's not at all simple in the GUI like it should be.
ElectricalEngineering,fnqge2h,t1_fnqfwuh,1587164074.0,"You'd think right? But no, there's no clear cut way to just set up a SIM to sweep with respect to a specific variable of your choosing directly according to the instructions for my lab and every other source on how to do it that I've found. You have to set the value of the variable you want to sweep to a kind of pointer to the value of a ""special"" parameter, which you can then sweep across.

Edit: with the exception being the values of sources."

beatsaber,fnmrvz4,t1_fnmm25e,1587076977.0,I forgot where I saw it but I know what he's talking about. You hold the controller upside down with the sensor bar still going over your knuckles. It feels weird to me but I totally see the mechanical advantage.
beatsaber,fnmrixs,t3_g2jxpl,1587076782.0,"Personally, I do the regular grip with my hand shifted up and my index finger around the part above the trigger with the angle of the blade rotated down 15 degrees. Currently rank #511.   P.S. there's some kind of hammer grip that inverts the controller so the head is closer to the axis of rotation in your wrist, but I could never get used to it."

AskReddit,fnjcrf5,t3_g1utzo,1586996356.0,"While I'm not sure I'd say it's the best, and it's definitely not iconic. Borderlands 3 actually has some really cool soundtracks at times that are cool enough that I stop and notice them, which is saying something considering the genre. It deserves an honorable mention at least lol"

beatsaber,fneghvv,t3_g19ml3,1586888947.0,"You seem to be moving your arms a lot more than you need to, try focusing on getting wrist movements in your swings. If you want to work on accuracy specifically, it's helpful to get practice in with very easy maps just going for as high as a percentage as possible, ghost notes also helped me, not with score accuracy, but with hit accuracy while looking ahead more which is pretty important when you need all the reaction time you can get. If you're using standard Vive wands or Oculus touch controller s, definitely look into different ways to hold the controller for speed. I use index controllers which are kinda great, I just hold the controller a little higher up with the strap loose and my index finger around the part above the trigger. My saber angle is also tilted down like 15 degrees like count dooku's lightsaber to give me more desirable swing angle. Try working on aspects of harder maps that you're not super comfortable with, i.e. dense streams, fast repetition, multiple complex crossovers, rapid lined up block sections, etc."

interestingasfuck,flmtef8,t1_flmrgvr,1585295855.0,"Working conditions would be worse. They're ALLOWED to sleep when on call, no one is stopping them from sleeping during the day to compensate, it's just not as good of working conditions if they're forced to be well rested and stay awake for night shifts at the expense of their personal life. You realize there's always going to have to be a surgeon that operates in the middle of the night, right? Smart people ARE often managed poorly this isn't new lol. They don't choose the conditions of how they work oftentimes, they have to operate at random times in the night sometimes."
