In making this move, which is very likely just a rebound relationship (people need time to be alone before getting into a new relationship about 99.9% of the time), she's essentially insured that Jake and her ex will be at some level a part of her and her new partner's lives, which is going to create more drama. The fact that there's been a sexual orientation switch will make the story more enticing as gossip-bait, giving OP the attention she craves.

1. Yes, Vietnam has several very wealthy people (but their wealth is often siphoned by the well connected)

2. Ad revenue would probably be in his AdSense et al. accounts, which he could transfer to his bank at any time.

3. Taxes are pretty low in Vietnam, but he could easily be threatened/pressured to give bribes.

4. It isn't really Marxist--it was a dictatorship that is slowly transitioning to a market based economy."
