UCSC,fpbisp5,t3_gci1mo,1588470980.0,"Go to [assist.org](https://assist.org) if you haven't already and search the classes from your CC and see if they match up with the similar class at UCSC. Once you've done that you should also give the list of classes to an advisor at BSOE (advising@soe.ucsc.edu), just to double check and get a more official check on if those classes will satisfy.  
I took calc 2 at a CC over the summer and this is how I made sure it officially satisfied Math 19B."
UCSC,fp8wwpo,t3_gbs4a3,1588405851.0,Dang. I'm in Brenda's 113 class and it's going fine no scandals or anything. Had canvas midterm Wednesday
espresso,fp1gkxa,t3_gakc2o,1588234810.0,"I have the delonghi 3420 (same wand, taking off metal tube) and I've been trying to pour art for a couple months now. Don't let anyone tell you it cant be done though!! There are many people online that do it, videos too. I've gotten really close. One tip is to put the want at an angle, and hold it in the milk and wait until it starts spinning. Then, just lower the pitcher a little so that the tip of the wand it closer to the surface. You should start hearing the ripping noise. Make sure to keep the milk spinning the whole time!"
UCSC,fozgv8b,t3_ga5hrp,1588190443.0,I really really hope Fall quarter is online. Not trying to spend thousands on rent in Santa Cruz.

college,foni1n5,t3_g8gv1b,1587919889.0,"I'm a senior at UCSC but I have 2 classes left after Spring that I will finish in the Fall. I really really want Fall quarter to be online. I would save so much money by doing the online classes at my parents house rent free. If I can do the classes from home rent free, there's no real point in paying ridiculous rent to do the same thing in person. I just want my degree and to save $! As far as 'missing friends' goes, I didn't make any close friends at college, so no one misses me. oh well"
Coffee,foiuw7b,t3_g7m88e,1587797811.0,"I have an espresso machine and pour over and its perfect. Sometimes you're in the mood for good ole pour over, and sometimes you need that special espresso taste, be it americano, straight, or a milk drink."
