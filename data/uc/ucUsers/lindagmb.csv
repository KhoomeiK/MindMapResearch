UCSD,fp2p1mp,t3_garycm,1588265499.0,"Yes I would. Environment is huge for me and ucsd is so big and surrounded by so much nature, it just feels good to walk around especially when being constantly stressed over classes. For mindfulness reasons, I love ucsd! There are huge ass trees everywhere and you can always discover something new on campus. The downside of it being big is rushing to classes if you only have a 10 min break, but I feel like professors are understanding of this. People also complain about not making friends bc “socially dead” or whatever but realistically if you join clubs and or show up to events (obvs now that’s hard lol) you’ll be fine. I haven’t done either of those anyway AND still have made friends in classes. I’m not sure if transferring from a community college makes me have a different experience than a freshman but that’s how I feel 

Also, I’m minoring in psych and have only had great professors with the psych department!"
UCSD,fn1yswq,t1_fn1xj9d,1586573433.0,It would just be for a general psychology ba. That's definitely a type of class I'm down for. Thanks for the reply :)
UCSD,fn1uxvm,t1_fn1shxg,1586570713.0,Thank you so much! This is v helpful
UCSD,fmx78pw,t3_fxxzpc,1586459735.0,I’m taking 20 units this quarter! I feel like online is easier for me to navigate 5 classes but only time will really tell if that’s true lol. I struggle w procrastination so I could be fucking myself over but with all the changes to this quarter (like dropping a class later/choosing p/np week 10) I think it’s worth trying 😅
UCSD,fmursrp,t1_fmtg784,1586397485.0,what was the process like to get on the show?
UCSD,fmt9njd,t3_fx6k4i,1586369092.0,I’m pretty excited about us being the only uc representing lol !!
UCSD,flzaeox,t1_flzaaxd,1585619095.0,Same. They said within 72 hours I’ll have my refund
