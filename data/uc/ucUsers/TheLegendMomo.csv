berkeley,fp56nd4,t1_fp4z1rf,1588318125.0,">	(probably still need to take an adjunct CS47B) but that’s less stressful than taking 61B

Can confirm, you just do one project in 47B of your choosing and that’s your grade in the class. I did the first one and had ample time to finish it."
VALORANT,fp1hbak,t1_fo0jrxm,1588235525.0,Will you be adding API support in games? I feel that's the one thing that's really missing from your software.
apolloapp,fp10dor,t3_gamvts,1588221135.0,Cool!
NintendoSwitch,foz7l1g,t3_gacjn7,1588186013.0,"So an issue I have is that my joystick, when I let go, is just barely beneath the middle, so it doesn’t show a plus. Is this the same issue you were having?"
apolloapp,foxcxeb,t1_foxcudy,1588140255.0,"Huh? It’s textured, there’s extra shadowing, the top is replaced with a custom controller art, each drawing in the back is new, come on now."
apolloapp,fowrpqo,t1_fowrfch,1588125728.0,A less extreme version of this would to just filter out the word icon
apolloapp,fowped4,t1_fos4web,1588124390.0,/u/iamthatis has already said he doesn’t want a separate sub for icons
apolloapp,fowp5wa,t1_fownqsz,1588124253.0,The idea of “flooding the the subreddit with icons” is one I don’t understand. We get like 2 a week tops? You would think by the way people comment that there’d be multiple every day.
apolloapp,fowp1q4,t1_fowo18m,1588124187.0,Such a fire icon
apolloapp,fowm6ws,t1_fow7qfh,1588122531.0,How on earth is this low effort? The circlejerk is getting real to a point where they don’t even look at the icon and just post hateful comments.
apolloapp,fowd0fg,t1_fowcwq9,1588117405.0,Yep.
apolloapp,fowd03p,t1_fow3t8y,1588117400.0,"I think some of the criticism of this one is unfair. It’s clearly got different textures, a background, and substantial editing to the original. Saying it has a different color only is just ignorant."
apolloapp,fowcsds,t1_fow1cwh,1588117283.0,There was already an application posted a long time ago.
Sneakers,fotuq2h,t3_g9cf4c,1588066802.0,These are really really bad fakes

apolloapp,fo7frb8,t3_g616h7,1587577579.0,I can confirm comments aren’t deleting
VALORANT,fo0of0u,t1_fo0o9ns,1587416790.0,Yeah that’s totally better than a full vision range Phoenix or breach flash with no warning
VALORANT,fo0o3cd,t1_fo0mtsv,1587416618.0,His flash is by far the worst. It’s ridiculously hard to hit and the enemy gets a warning as it’s traveling towards them.
berkeley,fnukpsw,t1_fnuko5w,1587264423.0,Yes
berkeley,fnu86av,t3_g3y9c2,1587256541.0,"I’m in the class right now. It’s kind of boring, but pretty easy."
berkeley,fnqyu4a,t1_fnqwxbd,1587175254.0,Depends on the major imo. Different majors have different schools that are best for them.
Sneakers,fnkgasz,t1_fni62ih,1587025952.0,I don’t know if it’s just me but I always find goat asks to be higher than StockX.
berkeley,fnjj04o,t3_g24xxa,1586999965.0,"Freshmen hear back in March, transfers in April. Last year it released on the deadline, and it’s not rolling, so no transfers have heard yet. You’ll find out on Friday."

apolloapp,fn949qy,t3_g0cjyk,1586758905.0,This is great!
berkeley,fn7irju,t3_fzqudl,1586721152.0,CS70 is way harder imo
VALORANT,fn60e4y,t1_fn60btt,1586682535.0,"Nice, I have an ultrawide so anything that supports it works be awesome."
VALORANT,fn5zdz8,t3_fz8mp9,1586681426.0,"Hey, would you be able to make a 3440x1440 version? I would like to make it my background, looks great!"
apolloapp,fn2pjla,t1_fmm4xij,1586598096.0,Do you know if the Launched icon will be added soon?
ApplyingToCollege,fn1whvs,t3_fyu5mq,1586571790.0,"As a CS major at Cal rn, the program is excellent. You’ll undoubtedly learn so much here. While it is difficult, you’ll come out of it very strong. Also, it’s much easier to get a CS internship when you have Berkeley on your resume. Let me know if you have any questions!"
apolloapp,fn1dmw9,t3_fyn19l,1586559837.0,It’ll appear in the middle of the frame if you move the gif around while it’s loading. 100% reproducibility /u/iamthatis
apolloapp,fmyttpe,t3_fy2m2u,1586495566.0,You have to click an option before more options load to reproduce this
apolloapp,fmtquee,t3_fx9t93,1586377419.0,This is not Apollo
apolloapp,fmt6uce,t1_fmt6ofb,1586367801.0,"Hm. Clicking the notification didn’t mark it as read. When I clicked inbox it was marked as read, but when I refreshed the list it was marked as unread."
apolloapp,fmt5usv,t3_fx46r4,1586367349.0,Can you reply to this so I can test it out?
VALORANT,fmqm1vb,t3_fwv52m,1586302284.0,"Is it okay to have the stream on in the background (like navigating to another tab or game)? I don't have to actually be watching the stream, right?"
apolloapp,fmo2ew2,t1_fmn1mvi,1586242906.0,"Perhaps I can play devils advocate, but >2k people voted on this, with 94% approving the post. The post has a few awards (usually doesn’t mean much, but something to note). I think a mod could help with posts that get upvoted heavily on a topic that you’ve already commented on in the past, that way new and unique features/bugs could get some exposure. I don’t think that’s unfair, right?"
nintendo,fmmipnw,t3_fw3qmv,1586205990.0,Thanks!
apolloapp,fmkc1t7,t3_fvrnfa,1586150149.0,Same here
