AmItheAsshole,fpj39wx,t3_gdb4cp,1588655374.0,"YTA — you were the one who scratched his car, so you’re responsible for the damages. It doesn’t matter if you were “doing a good thing” by mowing his lawn. The least you could do is offer to fix the damage you created. Be accountable for your actions."
AmItheAsshole,fpium3r,t1_fpi0f1c,1588649085.0,"Agreed! When I was pregnant, I didn’t gain any weight. I actually lost a few pounds. But my obgyn told me that there isn’t anything to worry about as long as the baby is growing & is healthy."

UCSantaBarbara,fohoeyp,t3_g3x6oh,1587769508.0,I’m interested in a minor in music w the interest in vocal/voice. Does anyone know if I have to audition for this? Or are auditions only required if I want to pursue a Bachelor or Music?
Vent,fogleh1,t1_fofb8zf,1587754076.0,"She says that “she didn’t know that my ex had a child & gf”. She also dumped him 2 weeks after I dumped him (early August/late July) & said that they were “incompatible” & I reached out to her in mid-late October. Then yesterday, she uploads the video as a tiktok challenge."
ApplyingToCollege,fnyobxl,t1_fnxsqo2,1587369636.0,That’s a good point! Thanks!

AskMen,fnmm0gp,t1_fnmlk2h,1587073863.0,"I agree! And noooo, I wasn’t trying to imply that. I should’ve worded my comment(s) better. Sorry about that! I wish you the best!"
AskMen,fnmksre,t1_fnm0v3v,1587073225.0,"Thanks! It does really suck & it’s terrible. I don’t wish it upon anyone else. But no, she actually dumped him 2 weeks after I did bc she went back w her ex LOL. It was crazy."
AskMen,fnm05gs,t1_fnkkl2e,1587062773.0,"You sound like my ex, except he cheated on me hella times & he never told me about these feelings. Instead, he told the girl he cheated on me with that he had commitment issues. 😂😂

But I’m glad you’re able to admit it! That’s mature and it’s one way to realize that you want to better yourself. My ex would never be able to admit any of this bc he can’t even acknowledge that he cheated on me! Lol 😂"
CalPoly,fn533ce,t1_fn51g4i,1586654770.0,"Ah sorry, I should’ve been more specific. I’m a transfer student. Is there a megathread for transfers? Where can I find it?"
