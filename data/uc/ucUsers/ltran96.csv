dndnext,fpmcdo8,t1_fpm75nr,1588730025.0,"Hrm... I'm looking for something more in the positive direction, since my character is very ambitious, and sees the old council in a very positive light. Anything to that effect?"
dndnext,fplwtlz,t3_gddbt5,1588720993.0,"So one of my wizard's character goals is to re-establish the council of archwizards, which is a title conferred onto wizards who are extremely powerful and have brought innovative changes to magic. I'm trying to figure out a reason for why the council would exist and what its purpose would be. Any suggestions?"
Games,fphlzdj,t3_gccfi3,1588623626.0,Awesome review. Only thing I want to dispute is that the Empire is a good starting faction...
Games,fphli1a,t3_gddcn0,1588623381.0,"The amazing thing about siege is how being clever and smart can net you just as many kills as being good at gunskill. That's something I think that keeps me coming back to this game, and something other games really don't have over it. That being said, something I don't see discussed here is that the game currently has MASSIVE issues with hackers, probably because of quarantine. I've gotten roughly 8 games of mmr back because of playing against hackers, and I'm only high silver, which is roughly average elo. From what I hear, it's even worse the higher you get.

What I really think ubisoft needs to do is increase the level limit for ranked to 70. Let's be real, everybody knows you won't be ranked ready at 30. There's no way you'll know the maps, be comfortable with enough ops and know the roles, etc."
Games,fphkq8w,t1_fpgpeeg,1588622992.0,"Ultimate edition costs ~$84 and that includes all of the operators, I believe. Also, they are incrimentally decreasing prices of DLC operators. When I joined the game, they weren't doing that and all non-Y1 ops were 25k."
Games,fphki62,t1_fpgrm0k,1588622878.0,"My best advice is to go into a t-hunt, pick buck, and open up the floors. Also, whenever you're in a game periodically check the callout names next to the compass. I think that's one of the smartest things the devs did, is build in room names into the compass."
SiegeAcademy,fpdukdp,t1_fpceubm,1588534529.0,"I don't like aim trainers, they don't feel the same as siege."
SiegeAcademy,fpbn977,t3_g1hmwv,1588473962.0,Does anybody have any advice for working on tracking and long distance 1x fights in t-hunt?
totalwar,fpaljkq,t1_fp9u2fp,1588450655.0,I can't seem to find it- got a link to it?

totalwar,fp6xc43,t1_fp18akb,1588360226.0,Is it turn timer destroyer?
totalwar,fp3nwdn,t1_fp1d921,1588282639.0,"I see. Is it better to leave them in melee, or cycle charge them?"
totalwar,fp1b0es,t1_fp17wdp,1588229656.0,"Gotcha. I figured the cav was the best to help me get some flank charges off on them, but they don't have the staying power."
totalwar,fp0qnw3,t1_fp0nyuq,1588214799.0,"I'm having a hard time right of the bat fighting even-ish battles just because saurus infantry has so much more staying power than the foot soldiers. Is the answer basically just to not take fair fights? I find it hard to out-maneuver them too, since they can waste my cavalry's time with skinks on the flanks."
totalwar,fp0jyxh,t3_g8axb6,1588210782.0,"TWWH2:

Any advice playing as the empire? I feel like pound for pound my basic infantry units can't even go toe to toe with the saurus basic infantry, and I don't feel like my better ranged units are helping me win battles either."
totalwar,fozhedi,t1_fozcn7g,1588190697.0,Kinda unfortunate. I want to play the TWWH1 map with the WH2 balance and QoL changes.
HistoryMemes,fozhajs,t1_fozebvm,1588190646.0,"My view is obviously colored since I'm descended from Vietnamese immigrants (Dad is from the North, Mother from the South) but I've been exposed to nothing but bitterness about Ho Chi Minh and what the Northern regime did to the country. Generally my relatives all express the opinion that the toll the war extracted on the country was worth it to fight the outcome that actually occurred."
HistoryMemes,fozd605,t1_foypr72,1588188677.0,"Vietnam did preeeetty shitty under communism though. Just as the north hated the south for being an american puppet state, the south hated the north for being a communist puppet state."
HistoryMemes,fozc6cr,t1_foz9yv7,1588188201.0,"Yup. My family and I are all very patriotic. Both my parents came here in boats, and managed to provide me with a comfortable middle class upbringing after coming here with nothing. If that isn't the american dream, I don't know what is. I take pride in both being the child of immigrants and a natural born american."

Has TWWH 1 been updated with TWWH 2 rebalancing? Aka reworked bretonnia and the like"
HistoryMemes,foz39vu,t1_foywsmz,1588183953.0,"I'm descended from vietnamese immigrants. All of my relatives vote republican because they supported the war. People to this day still refuse to call the capital by its actual name, preferring to call it Saigon."
shittyrainbow6,foyrijd,t3_ga640u,1588177838.0,"The ranked level requirement needs to go up to 70, minimum. I know for sure I spent my first 100 hours in siege being an absolute idiot and I KNEW I wasn't ready for ranked."
dndnext,foxcf73,t3_g92ib9,1588139836.0,"Are there any good resources on fleshing out characters, just to make sure I have all my bases covered?"

dndnext,fowj63a,t1_fowiv34,1588120810.0,"That's obviously a given- I'm hoping more for suggestions on things I can do to demonstrate them. Like, oh, since I'm arrogant, I'll be very very tempted by a faustian deal, or since I'm prideful I'm not very tolerant of slander etc etc"
dndnext,fowh9qi,t3_g92ib9,1588119749.0,"How can I make mistakes and portray character flaws without inconveniencing my party too much?

The short of it is that I'm playing an extremely egotistical wizard prodigy. I'm trying to think of actual actions I can take to show his flaws and mistakes I can make as a part of my character arc. I can obviously act haughty and talk down to people, etc etc but I also want to take actions that show my flaws. At the same time, I don't want to make it unfun for the rest of the table. Any advice?"
SiegeAcademy,fowh2fp,t1_fouerqu,1588119635.0,"I don't think the jager nerf has changed anything, honestly. He's still a great roamer with a must-have gadget and an excellent gun. Whoop whoop, he's a bit slower and a bit louder. ADSes are still a must have to hold certain positions, like server rack or blue stairs on bank, and that's fundamentally the issue with jager."
boston,fovtdh5,t3_g9q4r7,1588107188.0,"I don't mind at all, but can we now declare barbers an essential service? please?

EDIT: I was half-joking, if people weren't aware. I am fully aware that I can get a pair of clippers and give myself a buzz cut any time."

Games,fo41fwi,t1_fo2g7t1,1587496557.0,Yup. I absolutely love the lore and worldbuilding behind 9 and 10. The setting is absolutely brilliant and the way they set up the story throughout both games is fantastic.
Games,fo21n2x,t1_fo20w4h,1587447045.0,"I fucking **love** the black knight. I think he's such an awesome antihero. Not only is running into him in-game terrifying and not only is his theme super imposing, but his identity reveal and his role in the story is so damn cool."
doujinshi,fo1ml1h,t3_g4z4r0,1587436596.0,Why tf do the ntr authors always have the best art
Games,fo1ccd0,t3_g52zt9,1587430218.0,"I think 7 is a timeless classic, but 9 and 10 are my favorites story and mechanic wise. I think Tellius is a brilliant setting and the twists and turns and intrigue are fantastic, not to mention how great of a cast the game has. I also think that the varying lineups throughout the missions are super interesting narratively."

berkeley,fniau9k,t1_fngo9nf,1586976884.0,"> Do you feel lost or lonely because it's such a big school and perhaps hard to make friends, or get personal support?

Many people do, actually. But remember that you can always make a big school smaller, but not a small school bigger. The important thing is that you need to put in effort to find your small circles."
saltierthancrait,fneieua,t1_fnefbkq,1586889927.0,I think the chips are dumb because it robs the drama and gravity of clones who developed relationships to their jedi having to follow orde r66 and shoot them in the back.
SiegeAcademy,fncuveh,t3_g0s1ix,1586848003.0,It needs to be upped to 70.
Rainbow6,fncut2w,t3_g0z6jm,1586847942.0,This is a team game. Just speak up. There's nothing I hate more than someone who refuses to use their mic until they find an opportunity to bitch out the rest of the team.

SiegeAcademy,fmskoc6,t3_fx6fv5,1586357346.0,"Some sites have no-man's zones like this, such as kitchen on chalet or behind bar/freezer doors in third floor bar on kafe. The key is learning the effective areas attackers can see and playing around it."
volleyball,fmptu5n,t1_fmplk4k,1586287223.0,"From what I've heard, nowadays they don't care about spin and they only look at the contact at the end of the set. But yes, chances are that much spin is because you doubled during a set."
