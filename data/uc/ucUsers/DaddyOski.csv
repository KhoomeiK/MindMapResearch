csMajors,foqm3oq,t3_g8u1pu,1587996524.0,"Berkeley freshman here. I gave it a lot of thought and I don't think it makes sense to double major and take the extra burden of the useless requirements. There are very few relevant non-CS classes that you'll take with a DS major, and I think your time fulfilling requirements for your second major would be better spent on recruiting/networking. In my personal opinion, you should either major just in DS, or just CS."
