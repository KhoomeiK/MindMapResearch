aoe3,fpilmaf,t1_fpi69vq,1588643467.0,"Map sizes change with the number of players. If you try playing 1v1, you can easily see the stark difference in sizes between that and 4v4. 

I think the large maps in particular (large gp, large carolina) are more than sufficient to accomodate all the players. People dropping out, and lag would be a bigger issue for 8v8"

aoe3,fp9y41j,t3_gc2sgy,1588436958.0,"Japan should be fairly easy to beat economically in treaty 1v1s, since their lack of villagers leaves their eco wanting, compared to most eu civs. Unless they have an ally to provide them with cows or sheep, you only need to worry about japan's military.

China on the other hand is a different beast. It's impossible to outboom a chinese player who knows what he's doing. Given that they can max out villagers to 120 and have two factory equivalent buildings along with a host of good stuff from their consulate, means that they have one of the strongest economies in the game. 

I consider the ottomans as a rush/supremacy civ (hence my flair) and I rarely use them for treaty. As far as outbooming other civs goes, you have a chance against japan provided you follow some treaty guides online but not china."

Also, remember that merlin takes a while to come online, but has the potential to easily be top damage on your team."

aoe3,fp2hwv6,t3_galioq,1588262046.0,"The main reason why players do it (apart from saving a meagre amount of wood) is to avoid splash damage. When you take out a pillar, you also take out both the longer wall segments next to it, leaving a much bigger hole for the army to push through. However without the pillar, only one wall segment falls at a time.

Also for treaty, it makes it easier to build walls since villagers can move between the gaps without pillars and build the rest of the walls.

Keep in mind that army units en masse cannot go through these gaps.

To do it yourself, click on a pillar, hit Ctrl shift a to select 50 and delete them."
