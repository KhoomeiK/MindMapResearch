SkincareAddiction,fp6ipat,t1_fp3a5dy,1588353019.0,"Another question! My derm said I can apply moisturizer and then the active, but Iâ€™m concerned because I know these actives should be applied to dry skin. My products take a looong time to absorb, and when I go to sleep my face is still tacky from my skincare routine. Do you have this absorption issue/irritation from Differin while products still havenâ€™t absorbed?"
SkincareAddiction,fp30dew,t1_fp05pmd,1588270930.0,"I got the Laneige Cream Skin and Dear Klairs Watery Oil Drop! And Iâ€™m about to start using prescription actives, so if my skin freaks out too much Iâ€™ll try the NIOD. I hope I can finally hydrate my skin with this new routine, Iâ€™ve been trying for years to fix it ðŸ˜©"
SkincareAddiction,fouu9wb,t3_g5g63z,1588090507.0,"Thanks for this post! I thought I was the only one whoâ€™s skin actually felt more dehydrated with HA. Does the NIOD serum noticeably relieve the dehydrated tight skin feeling? My skin responds well to serums, so Iâ€™m looking for a one thatâ€™s hydrating but can still be worn during the day. Iâ€™ve had good luck with products containing honey, so Iâ€™ve just ordered the Iâ€™m From Honey serum and will see how that goes. Iâ€™ve also put some of the products you mentioned in my cart and am excited to try them!"
