ApplyingToCollege,fp7owr4,t3_gbs12r,1588374796.0,"This may not be the same reasons people on this sub hate it, but my brother graduated from UCSD and hated it. The administration blatantly doesn't care if students are happy. It's an amazing school, but it doesn't care about it students, doing stuff from forcing triples (making every double room into a triple by shoving another bed in), to gouging students on the cost of food on campus."

Conservative,fp0763n,t3_gaexrt,1588203757.0,"Musk has a clause in his contract that would vest a large number of stock options if Tesla's stock price (six month average) stays above a certain level.  He's close to hitting the bonus, but will lose it if the stock price drops sharply in the next 1-2 months.   The options current value is about 3/4 of a billion dollars.

It has been suggested that he wants everone out shopping for Teslas, regardless of the danger, because of the massive amount of money he personally will make on that incentive.

Here's one writeup of the situation:

I enjoy the works of Brandon Sanderson, because of how he fleshes out every one of his worlds so throughly, with complex magic systems. I think that you are his equal at the very least, and if you ever published a book I’d buy it right away. Thank you much for writing these stories for free."
