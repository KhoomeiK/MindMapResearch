Off to the left you can still see remnants of the original village, except I turned it into the lower-class peasant district lol.

The redstone gun is your standard dispenser gun design, except it uses packed ice to channel the ammunition once it fires.

Say you have items scattered about a category, with 1 slot left open. Which slot should it be? How would the player know which one it was? It wouldn't work visually either.

I didn't find it too overpowered even on a nearly vanilla run, as the more items you carry on you, the greater the risk when you die, so chests and such still come into play."

There's no reason I can't get JEI to work with this, but it will require some clever work arounds when it comes to features like that. Which is also the reason I'm not likely adding Inventory Tweaks compatibility, instead I'll probably borrow some of its ideas.

Items cannot go into tabs where they don't belong, shift clicking is supported, and this is compatible with all of the vanilla GUIs that use the player inventory.

Upcoming features to be added before release are:

1. Hotkeys to enter a specific tab from survival

2. Right click a tab with an item will automatically drop it into there

3. A button to ""auto-categorize"" everything in the default player inventory (the tab with the chest). Currently, picked up items first show up in this tab, which is functionally the vanilla inventory, before being sorted into the others.

This mod is only one part of a project I'm calling Vanilla Overhaul, with re-worked combat, enemy AI, more mobs, more dimensions, and bosses. But this little idea seemed so nifty to me on vanilla survival playtests that it might just become a stand alone mod. 

Couple interesting things I noted while play testing:

1. Crafting doesn't appear any more of a chore since myself and a few others found that we kept common ingredients in the tab with the crafting matrix

2. Even with no other mods installed, this came in handy. A typical 1-2 hour speedrun with average spelunking and stripmining, which would've normally filled up the vanilla 3x9, was no big deal. 

3. Since the inventory isn't as ""simple"" as it used to be, I found myself taking greater notice of what I put in my hotbar."

Unfortunately there's no possible way it'll be compatible with Inventory Tweaks, the way that handles items and containers is fundamentally different to the way I am forced to implement this.

feedthebeast,fow845r,t1_fow5t62,1588114766.0,"Gotcha. As for the latter, it'll be available from the get-go.

I'll limit the spaces in tabs like the weapons or equipment, but overall, I've kind of realized this: Minecraft's vanilla inventory is purposefully limited, since it encourages players to build lots of chests (and by extension, a base). So in vanilla, the core game loop revolves around spending quite a significant chunk of time moving to and from your base to wherever just to put stuff away.

However, in a lot of modpacks and certainly in my mod, I want to encourage nomadic play equally as much as sheltering. So I want to build a system that doesn't punish players for carrying lots of stuff, since in my mod you also don't lose any of your items when you die.

It's easily one of the highest quality content that isn't really a review channel (bikeradar, for one), but I wouldn't compare them to Top Gear. 

The format is similar, but unlike TG, there's a few problems that never sits right with me when I'm watching their stuff. A) they're way too ""centrist"" for lack of a better term when it comes to their own opinions on certain things, lacking any degree of skepticism on camera and B) they're out of touch with the average joe.

The first point is most salient when it comes to comparing them to TG. Because in TG, you had Clarkson, Hammond, and May, who were heavily (as an understatement) opinionated on their views on cars and automotive trends. They weren't afraid to voice when they disliked something, even a car that some automotive corporation had spent tons of money into shipping to their studio for them to see. GCN really does not have any of that. They're way too pandering to the middle of the fence in fear of offending people and the companies, and the end result is an opinion that's so lukewarm, not on either side, that it's not worth even hearing at all. Actually this is true of the majority of cycling related online personalities and organizations, even youtubers.

The second point, TG focused on the broad spectra. Sure, the supercars were the most exciting, but some of their best content were their demonstrations of cars in the mid-range and the interesting things they did with them. Think the Evo, Ford Fiesta, hell even the Toyota truck. So cars that the average Joe, working a normal 9-5, could afford on their salary. But look at GCN. The majority of their content is centered around tired, rehashed top-10 lists, and when the focus is on bikes/equipment, it's on pro-content. How to ride like a pro, what equipment will make you like a pro, pro cycling training secrets, that kind of shit. Which is fine if you're an amateur pro starting out, but not for the majority of the cycling community.

I'll still watch some of their challenge videos that they don't really do very often, but they're just another top-10 channel at this point with wacky personalities filling in the entertainment now and again. If they stopped releasing so many top-10 lists and oversaturating their releases, and instead focused on less regular, but more personality driven content like challenges or weird experiments, then you could maybe make the comparison to TG."
