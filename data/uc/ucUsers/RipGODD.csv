berkeley,fpeykl6,t3_gcvqov,1588557741.0,"Am I the only one who thinks Berkeley is overrated? I am a Berkeley senior (stem major) and I have to say I did not enjoy the learning experience here. The whole elitist/competitive vibe is very discouraging and alienating. Professors, students, overly focus on RESULTS over PROGRESS, with no regard to what some students might be going through during the semester. Essentially if you fucked up once, you are fucked up forever. There is no such culture/policy at Berkeley that encourages students to try more and fail more. That is how you learn anyways. But at Berkeley, people are too scared to try classes outside of their comfort zone. They always try to pick the “safest” classes to take. Everything is about GPA and resume. To me, this kind of mindset defeats the purpose of education.  Also for example, for a lot of classes, the ranking of students, aka the “curve”, instead of how much they actually learned determines the final grades.You can get a 85% on a midterm but still one sd below average, resulting in a C range grade. I know there are some professors here who genuinely care about the well-being of students and foster a healthy learning environment. They are just very rare here imo."
