ucla,fpl9mei,t3_gdq1ai,1588708794.0,Would it be weird to do the undie run alone around the Hill? There’s not very many people still here but I gotta show my support for that too 😤😤✊🏽
ucla,fpf6bct,t3_gd2snf,1588562833.0,"Bruin Fam is here for you!!! My condolences to you and your family for this awful situation :( ... I can only try to fathom what you’re going through but if I know anything, it’s that your acceptance here is a testament to your perseverance and strength. 

I assure you that you’re not a disappointment. It’s hard losing family in any situation, and I can only imagine it’s even harder now in a time of quarantine. So, you deserve to grieve however you deem necessary, whether it’s putting off schoolwork or just letting yourself feel the flurry of emotions you may have. Try to remember the good times with your family and the fact that this won’t last forever — it just feels like it does. You are not alone and you have a huge network of fellow Bruins who are willing hear you out and help in any way we can!"
callmebyyourname,fpc2k84,t1_fpc0rvu,1588485569.0,You can always just see if your local library has a digital version to check out too! 10/10 recommend after watching the movie. Gives a lot more details than the movie (and that’s saying a lot considering how great the movie is). I was in the same boat last week.
ucla,fpbt97m,t1_fpbqqzq,1588478142.0,"I’m mostly frustrated at people sitting in an area that’s probably less than 300 feet long. I was moving around avoiding people as best as I could, aside from a biker who rode past me and got fairly close. All of these people were just sitting down, not seeming to show any care for the fact that they were surrounded by others in every direction in pretty close proximity. 

I assure you nobody sitting down on Janss was there to “do exactly what I wanted to do.” I was running on campus out of convenience and due to it being the only suitable place for me to run since I’m quarantined to UCLA. It was understandable for seniors to be taking their senior pictures. It was understandable to see other people exercising. It was understandable for people to play frisbee in a small group next to Powell. However, it was not understandable to see multitudes of groups just hanging out in this one part of campus. Compared to the tiny portion of people who would do this during Spring Break, this was probably 10x the amount of people gathered there :/// so I’m worried for how long this pandemic will last and how largely it will affect us if this continues. If large crowds gather here, we will never be able to go to in-person classes for quite some time."
StarWars,fp59e5t,t3_gbdcay,1588320931.0,currently wondering if the rogue one line coming up from ahsoka means she may have had some interaction with Chirrut.... and if that could have any connection with the rogue one spinoff coming up 👀
StarWars,fp58y0g,t1_fp58u4r,1588320469.0,Yep! Mondayyyyyyyy
StarWars,fp58wzf,t3_gbdcay,1588320441.0,Might sound stupid but has anybody honed in on the story behind the title? Like yeah I see how that can relate to emotions and the falling order... but I feel like I’m missing something

ucla,fp11jq7,t1_fp0w8uu,1588221945.0,bRuh... they should let us remove our meal plans entirely so I can get my money’s worth at ralphs
callmebyyourname,foubdf5,t3_g9mhm3,1588080682.0,"I agree with you for the most part except for the part about the morning after being too jarring. I personally felt that it was a bit of an accurate portrayal (this is coming a bit from personal experience) and it displays Elio’s inclination to understand if that relationship is something he really wants. But once he distances himself (albeit for a very short time), he realizes he does want to be with him. 

I personally don’t enjoy the parents being such passive characters throughout the entire plot. They do have their slight influence in pushing the two together, but I feel like their role could have been expanded upon at from an earlier point in the film. (This might just be personal preference to changing up the plot a bit considering the parents know what those two are doing)

I also feel like the marriage notification should have been done in person during a visit like in the book. In light of the maturity difference, it just seems like a copout to have this done over the phone... despite it giving us Elio’s amazing fireplace scene. For a guy trying so hard as to not hurt or break Elio, Oliver seems to do exactly that, leaving him in his fearful qualms that he started the film with per the landing of the fly on him. Excellent use of motifs and acting, but it reduces Oliver’s maturity as opposed to relishing in Elio’s coming-of-age."
callmebyyourname,foqfjht,t3_g8r5xw,1587992356.0,"also just watched it for the first time at 1am... when I finished, I had to sit here for 10 minutes and ponder about what to do with my life because the ending made me feel empty on the inside... then not even an hour later I wanted to watch it again. it is very rare that movies/shows make me wanna watch them again—much less after only an hour of being watched the first time. I applaud you CMBYN."

ucla,fo14epw,t1_fo12z0f,1587425522.0,I haven’t had that happen to me... but it’s not really your fault so I wouldn’t see why they would penalize you for it. The sign out time is out of all of our hands except probably the IT department :/

StarWars,fno78ui,t3_g2wu6h,1587114716.0,Am I the only one confused as to why Ahsoka & Anakin didn’t wish each other “may the force be with you” instead of their “good luck”???? I really felt like something was missing there when they didn’t say it to each other. Especially knowing this is probably their last time seeing each other :(
ucla,fnb913p,t3_g0qahx,1586811339.0,not too sure anybody would openly tell you online lmaooooooo
ucla,fn7m23h,t3_g02zrj,1586723036.0,"1) probably cheaper to do CC, but then you have to go through the process of enrolling for the school and then having your credits transferred over to UCLA... plus you gotta make sure the CC class actually counts for UC credit 
2) depends on your financial need and how early you apply... doesn’t affect other financial aid I’m pretty sure 
3) dispersed to your bruinbill like any other financial aid and then reimbursed to your bruindirect account if there’s excess"

ucla,fmym5rn,t3_fy79qe,1586489559.0,I forgot to pick up something during quarantine even though I’m still here and they still sent it back. It took only like a day for them to email me saying it was refunded.
ucla,fmy01cj,t3_fy298p,1586475280.0,"I’m not really for or against the organization, but I’m currently looking through their budget report and seeing a lot of money that (to me) doesn’t seem like it’s being fully utilized. 

And frankly, as I continue to go through some of these organizations, I don’t really understand why I (someone with an EFC fairly close to 0) am being forced to take out loans to pay for some of these costs— a small cost but I’m sure I’m not the only one in this situation. So as someone marginalized, I am now questioning the validity of the organization given that all of my clubs/orgs seem to get little-to-nothing from USAC and still are high-functioning... especially when there are many club dues/fees/fundraising...

Just my opinion as someone that isn’t super FOR or AGAINST them."
