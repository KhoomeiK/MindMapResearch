Rainmeter,fnmfgyo,t3_g2nc1d,1587070478.0,"I wanted to make a variant of my [previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainmeter/comments/eiaqe5/mountain_sunset/) with a cooler color scheme, so here it is!  
All of the skins, icons, and software used in this skin can be found in that previous post as well. The only new addition is the [Nord Windows Theme](https://www.deviantart.com/niivu/art/Nord-Windows-10-Theme-837266272) that I got from u/niivu's post.   


Thanks again guys and I hope you enjoy!"
