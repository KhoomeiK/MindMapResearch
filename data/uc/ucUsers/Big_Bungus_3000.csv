This is the 2019-2020 version, but for the most part, it's a good place to see more or less what you need.

UCSantaBarbara,fnds974,t3_g0zvtq,1586876516.0,I’m also taking 21 units! It’s a grind but make a schedule and make yourself accountable. If you don’t finish something like you said you would you need to make up for it and  you tend to get it right the second time. Best of luck to us all and you can push through!

UCSantaBarbara,fn0kema,t1_fmyocsg,1586543558.0,"I have friends at UCI and from what I understand, compared to what they learn we are more hands  on. As for job opportunities there is plenty. The surrounding of Goleta has a ton of opportunities for internships and future jobs. I don’t think you were asking about research, but there is also ways to get into that easily. UCI and UCSB are both great schools so in my opinion go to the one that’s going to make you happier, I did and it’s been working out for me ever since. Dm me if you have more questions"
