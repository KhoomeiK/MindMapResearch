Excision,fp7kxe5,t3_gbrolv,1588372570.0,I’m wondering if we wil be even able to gather in giant groups like a concert by November though
UCSC,fp7ksrd,t3_gbna8w,1588372500.0,"I would 100% take it up with the department. “Remote instruction” has proven to be very annoying for many reasons, and submitting work is one of those reasons. I had a similar issue like that with one of my midterms and with every lab I’ve turned in this quarter. Just a pain and your professor should understand that"
AmItheAsshole,fp4otp9,t3_gb57ss,1588303800.0,NTA. Your boyfriend is very problematic & sounds very toxic
college,fp4m05c,t3_gb1bzy,1588301991.0,My school already sent out an email saying that regardless of the teaching method for Fall 2020 that tuition will remain the same as an in-person quarter would. I just plan on taking a lighter workload of courses until classes resume in person
UCSC,fp38nl2,t3_gb29bn,1588275006.0,Yeah i would recommend C9/10. One thing I loved about C9/10 compared to my college (Stevenson) is that is was right next to Science Hill which is where most of my classes have been. You’re also not too far from the school of engineering at C9/10
UCSC,fp103ci,t3_gajxyq,1588220931.0,I have David as a TA right now for linear algebra and he’s pretty good at communicating concepts
UCSC,fp0znpf,t3_gaob08,1588220631.0,^ i also had breakspear and ended w an A with not too much effort; just the big research paper we worked on throughout the quarter was probably the most intense use of time

LightningInABottle,fnnuvsl,t3_g2q8fi,1587102453.0,"Response I got from LIB when I emailed them asking this question:

The VIP experience is going to be brand new and something we’ve never offered before.  At the moment VIP access will include backstage lounges with private bars and refreshments, special viewing access areas and some other fun stuff we are working on. We’re still brainstorming ideas, but we’re talking about unique events inside the festival, private interactive experiences and special merchandise items. The details have not been worked out yet but we plan to create an experience that will not disappoint."

AmItheAsshole,fn6r37s,t3_fzvxw7,1586705653.0,"NTA. I was just like your 12 year old sister. My brother’s friends would say stuff like this to him and he told me (years later) that he cut off their friendships becauce like you said, who says that about a 12 year old girl?"
