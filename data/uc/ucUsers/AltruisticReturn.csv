berkeley,fo3glho,t3_fqdm9d,1587486553.0,"If I take Stat 20 and CS 61A, do I still need to take Stat C8 for a Data Science, or can I use the ""grandfathering"" policy to not do it?"
berkeley,fnwrn0b,t1_fnwjes6,1587324093.0,"I’ll take stat 20 simply bc it fulfills requirement for stats, econ, haas, and even data science if i can’t end up declaring one of the impacted majors."
berkeley,fnwj8oa,t1_fnwimvt,1587319422.0,"For Econ's math requirements, it says the following: ""At least one semester of the calculus/statistics requirement must be completed at UC Berkeley."" I'm assuming that means I have to take some sort of calc at Cal."
ucla,fn6wjt6,t1_fmxrx9a,1586708745.0,I chose cal!
