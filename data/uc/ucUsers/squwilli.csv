FireEmblemHeroes,fplqfqr,t1_fplnyi9,1588717505.0,"You can sacrifice units to give some of their skills to other units. In this case, Nailah has both distant counter and null c-disrupt, which would be given to Ike. 

Generally, sacrificing 5 star units isn’t something done lightly and new players shouldn’t do it until they’re more familiar with the game, but Brave Ike is so absurdly strong that I think it’s worth it. 

Also obligatory tip to not merge 5 star exclusive units unless you’re sure about what you’re doing, and also to not merge 4 star units until you promote them to 5 stars."

FireEmblemHeroes,fpdv8sx,t3_g8vktp,1588534919.0,"Is Larcei (+atk -res) good in AR-D? I already have V!Alm as my speedtank in light season offense since he also has the duo skill and atk reduction. On paper, she should be pretty annoying to face but it seems that the most annoying defenses consist of either mage rally traps or ridiculous stat balls. My alternative is a galeforce OG Eliwood with swift sparrow 3 and lull spd/def 3 but he's still a WIP sadly (hunting for a +spd still). I'm also considering Dimitri to synergize with my Lysithea/L!Azura rally trap but he seems kind of inconsistent as well.

Also, I've only focused on AR-O so far, so what's the general rundown on what teams are common on light vs astra season? Not sure what the difference is aside from naga making dragons obsolete on AR-D astra season."
FireEmblemHeroes,fpdtoya,t1_fp89to7,1588534024.0,"I'd recommend something like Edelgard, Reinhardt, Veronica, Peony for general PvE. For general team building tips, you should have a variety of different colors (so ideally one of red/green/blue), damage types (physical or magic), ranges (1 vs 2 range), and roles (either enemy phase focused or player phase focused).

My thought process for making the team was basically this: Edelgard can lure enemies closer to your team since she can take a hit, and then wipe out the squishier ones next turn. The ones she can't kill are likely either reds or high defense units (because she's a green physical unit) so Reinhardt can snipe those units off instead, and Peony can then help him either retreat or snipe another unit. I recommend Veronica as your last unit because she's such a good generalist unit, being able to both attack without getting counterattacked, buff, debuff, and heal."

* fodder ss3 to either OG Eliwood (running galeforce and lull spd/def) or F!Byleth (running galeforce/windsweep/fb3 seal)

I also got a copy of nagi to fodder off since I already have one and I don't really like dragon armors, so who should I give dc to between:

* Phina so she can dance and double as a vantage sweeper on enemy phase
* Y!Marth, who is basically just Phina but trades dance for a prf special

Right now I'm deciding between Est, The Reinhardt, Eliwood, and Ares. Rn I'm leaning toward one of the cavs since I managed to pull the duo Palla who seems better for obvious reasons.

Other notes:

Ares already has dc

Eliwood has lull spd/def from a -atk claude which is pretty dope, and is arguably the only unit here that needs every single stat from merges. Wish I had swift sparrow 3 though.

Reinhardt is my best blue mage by far"

FireEmblemHeroes,foi7xtf,t3_g7likd,1587780592.0,Depends on your build but I like the blazing refine better bc you can run galeforce without a heavy blade seal
FireEmblemHeroes,fofovqs,t1_foeto90,1587740180.0,"True, Marth beats Ares in his niche of cav and armor killing, but imo if they only inherit dc and not special spiral then Marth is inconsistent because he can’t fire off specials, so he’s kind of screwed against bulky infantry (and fliers I guess), while Ares doesn’t need special spiral but can instead fire off 3 cd specials thanks to his slaying effect.

Marth does win by a fair bit if he have special spiral though thanks to his effectiveness while only doing around 4 less damage to non effective units, on top of being able to set up with infantry pulse. He could also use NCD for AR if he wanted to, but if we’re comparing equal investment (as in just dc for both units) I still think Ares is better."
FireEmblemHeroes,foctesi,t1_focpzdq,1587675605.0,"Special spiral lets Marth activate Hero's Blood on every vantage counterattack, so it improves his consistency immensely, so tbh it depends on how much spiral fodder you have vs. how much you need.

If you didn't want to spend special spiral fodder then I'd recommend Ares, since he has special spiral built in he only needs dc to do essentially the same thing as Marth.

If you put special spiral on Marth they become a lot more comparable performance-wise though, with Marth doing better against cavalry and armors and Ares doing better against everyone else, not to mention their different move types giving them different advantages."
FireEmblemHeroes,focpibq,t3_g4nyte,1587674170.0,"Got a -atk claude, normally I would keep him but 44 atk with his weapon is really sad...

So I need to decide who to give lull spd/def to. Generally, my rationale was that it should go to a unit that does physical damage (obviously), is player phase, and has no better options. Any ideas? I'm also willing to take 3-4 star suggestions but from my box I've narrowed it down to:

* Brave Lyn 
   * 5 range offensive unit that's basically a slightly better Claude
   * However, slight redundancy because her weapon already has dull ranged. Also unable to use her prf B skill if I use lull instead.
* OG Eliwood
   * Reliable galeforce unit since all he needs is a double to activate galeforce, and this would boost his atk and spd which he needs a lot of since 54 atk/43 spd on initiation is kinda meh. A +10 project.
   * But, mostly used on AR defense for now with Lunge, and for that purpose I'm not sure it's much better. Also I don't have optimal IVs for him yet and the copies are not coming in fast.
* Brave Eliwood
   * Good generic pp lance cav, better offensive stats than OG Eliwood, also has Swift Sparrow 3 while OG Eliwood only has SS2. Also good dragon/beast check during Arena Assault.
   * Also used on AR defense for rally trapping, and he would drop his niche (in my box at least) as a rally support since he's my only ruse user."

FireEmblemHeroes,fo7ulr9,t3_g67bs7,1587584815.0,"Obligatory ""don't merge 4 stars"", and especially not Ares and Eliwood since they're actually really good with some investment. I see you have a Nailah, so I recommend foddering her for both distant counter and null c-disrupt to Brave Ike, and to refine Brave Ike's weapon as soon as possible.

For advancing missions, the most important thing to have is a good enemy tank, hence why I mentioned Brave Ike. If you don't want to use him, I recommend Blue Hector and Idunn as other options. 

For your next slot, I'd recommend Brave Camilla because she can both heal your tank and deal magic damage, with the bonus of locking enemies down in an AOE.

I recommend Legendary Azura for your third slot because she can help Camilla snipe down an enemy or escape. Alternatively, Altina also works as an off-tank.

Your last teammate I would recommend a high damage dealer such as Legendary Alm or Reinhardt."

* Phina as a backup vantage sweeper that can also use WoM, don't have special spiral fodder though (+atk +1)
* Young Marth if I actually get him bc he's a 4 star sidegrade to Phina since he trades Phina's dance for a better special
