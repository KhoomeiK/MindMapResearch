SkincareAddiction,foiln6i,t3_g7nlfn,1587789817.0,"my experience with accutane was short lived. a month in, my skin was pretty much fixed, save for my scars and whatnot. however, my lips were drier than a desert. they were so cracked and bloody, all the time, no matter how much chapstick i used. also, i had frequent nosebleeds, and my skin on my fingers became very ‚Äúthin.‚Äù idk how to describe it further, it was just more prone to cuts, scratches, and bruises. oh, and peeling. my skin was so dry and peeled everywhere. but damn i looked good."

berkeley,fo0ifwa,t1_fo0idcy,1587413716.0,"okay, i think you can safely go with berkeley. it‚Äôs hard getting first picks, but waitlists are a thing and most people i know always get the classes they need."
berkeley,fo0iaus,t3_g4zv7p,1587413643.0,"if you‚Äôre talking about ucla (idk why you‚Äôre hiding that fact, it would help people give you better advice) then go with ucla since it‚Äôs regents. but don‚Äôt worry too much, you‚Äôll get the classes you need especially if it‚Äôs in your major. if you haven‚Äôt even declared a major yet i‚Äôd still give it a try."
QualityReps,fnni752,t3_g2n257,1587092950.0,"i have retail CDG, LV, MCM, Burberry, Bape, Balenciaga, basically the shit that FashionReps tries to get right. i only really wear my MCM bag and Bali coat these days. 

i think my style is still growing, and before this i never really knew about avant garde fashion or obscure japanese designers. 

since i‚Äôm in college now, i don‚Äôt have too much money to spend on these types of pieces, much less even source them. i find that getting reps of rick owens, margiela, saint laurent is pretty fun and i like being able to explore new styles without committing to retail pricetags."

QualityReps,fnji6rj,t3_g1gsot,1586999477.0,"as long as the material used was the stretchy synthetic denim it should be fine, but knowing gremade and undercover‚Äôs construction, it‚Äôs probably just tight. i‚Äôm gonna have these in hand soon and i promise i‚Äôll drop a comprehensive review with fit pics."
SkincareAddiction,fnjes3o,t3_g23r6i,1586997502.0,Strongly recommend japanese or korean milkshake spf brands. they‚Äôre not as strong but they work wonders on your skin.
QualityReps,fnjdly8,t3_g1uzl5,1586996836.0,yall think it‚Äôs worth it to just cop retail off grailed or consignment stores in LA? rly itching for these or the 85s. i guess asking gremade is the best shot for these pants

FashionRepsBST,fnaysgn,t3_g0jnki,1586806202.0,"great quality rep, but people need to stop claiming 1:1 on mcm stark reps, regardless of color or size. the shapes have always been wrong and haven‚Äôt been updated in over four years. older repfam know this, and as a retail owner of a visetos, it‚Äôs just obvious. price is still reasonable but ive been seeing too many .7:1 claiming to be 1:1 to not speak out. OP didn‚Äôt do anything wrong, i‚Äôm just tryna remind the community something that was apparently forgotten entirely."
lego,fn4o5gv,t3_fzkt4x,1586645389.0,"you could scout garage sales, flea markets, warehouse sales (in my area some warehouses sell a lot of toys, lego included).

FashionReps,fn2fjnu,t1_fn2fa71,1586587230.0,yeah. eventually you‚Äôll move on from this stuff and look at more upstyle parisian brands. then you‚Äôll peak once you get into japanese designer.
SkincareAddiction,fn2fhl0,t3_fyxni6,1586587174.0,"it‚Äôs a perfectly normal, very human thing to have! if you look closely, you‚Äôll notice everyone else has them too. but still, it helps to shave it and ensure there‚Äôs no hair causing an uneven pigmentation from the sun."
