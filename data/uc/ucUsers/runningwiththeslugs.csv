Get a pet. A companion like a cat or dog. Maybe even two. Heck a ferret/lizard/bird if your home doesn't allow cats or dogs. It's not a magical fix it but it means in all this shitty quarantine you have someone by your side. And when this is all done you have someone who is glad to see you come home.

If you have friends reach out. Tell them exactly how you feel so they can do their job as friends to comfort you. You're already occupying your time with hobbies, try learning skills for something else too just in case you do need to find a new industry. Can't hurt to learn smth new and there are online programs and sites that teach you things for that."

Advice,fpc501k,t3_gclu9y,1588487803.0,"There's two factors very important in this. Is your sister willing to step up for herself or not? If she is willing I say you sit her down and tell her that for all that she loves this man, she agreed to date him because he was a good man who she believes will treat her right. What she didn't do was sign up to be disrespected by his son. You have to push her to tell her husband that he is the parent not her and while she understands that it's his kid, he is being unfair in expecting her to put up with disrespect.

My dad said something that rung with me once about his own sister. ""If I make them break up she'll always look back and think 'what if?' and blame me. If she breaks up of her own accord she'll be more secure in the outcome.

Now, if this is one of those situations where you're sister will likely just take it then you talk to her and say something else. You tell her that family looks out for each other and that this is you looking out for her. Because if there was a situation where it was reverse you'd like to think she'd stand up for you. You tell her you're going to have a serious talk with her boyfriend. Don't go too into detail but tell her you want a talk to her boyfriend if this guy is going to stick around.

You talk to her boy friend and you basically say the stuff in my first paragraph. You may only be 19 but disrespect is disrespect and you won't tolerate this treatment to your sister. That kid of his is treating your sister like shit and he's letting it happen. You don't care what his excuses are but your sister agreed to date a man who would respect her and he won't even protect her from disrespect. Your sister deserves better and don't approve of someone who can't give that. If that kid needs therapy so be it. His problems shouldn't he your sister's misery. You tell the kid that you aren't handling this anymore. That's his sister you're treating like shit and if he thinks that in this world you can take out your anger on innocent women and people will let you get away with it he has another thing coming. He better fix his issues or he's going to have to deal with you. Also like warn your sister and the father so they can be aware you aren't just saying this as an empty threat. MAYBE Inform your parents a bit so they aren't blind to the situation.

Go stand up for you're sister. Just because you're 19 doesn't mean you can't do it. Doesn't mean you should just be quiet and let your sister maybe marry a guy who is going to condemn your sister to years of disrespect because he feels guilty over a woman already out of his life."
AskReddit,fpc3uia,t3_gclryx,1588486723.0,Joined the BTS fandom. Sounds childish but what followed was I made a lot of friends and my Twitter account (because that where we mostly operate) has a huge following and I make insane bank on selling related merch because I'm trusted. Not only that but the job I hold I got because I got recommended by a fellow fan. I'm doing pretty well monetarily all because of all of this.
Advice,fpc3jvo,t3_gclo4j,1588486459.0,"You have a right to be angry but not pissed. More like upset and a bit disappointed. Don't yell at him or anything. If the order of those things were reversed.

""Okay I'm down."" You were right to think he had just made you a promise. 

Talk to him. One point against you is you didn't bring it up. If you had brought it up like the next day when you met up he would have known for sure. It's highly likely he took you not brining it up as disinterest and had also been silently wondering if you would mention it too. Sit down and say you had been waiting throughout the week for you to bring up plans and looking forward to it. Be mature and say you were disappointed and hurt that next thing you hear, he had been on a trip with someone else while you were excitedly waiting to hear from him about travel plans. It sounds shady to say make him feel guilty but yes. You don't want to start a fight, you want him to know he did wrong. If he's a good friend he won't brush off your feelings. Say you need some time, take a break from him a bit to get over it, since what is done is done. And when you feel less hurt and upset then go back to him."

Advice,fpc2vup,t3_gcliay,1588485862.0,"I kind of had this same situation with my younger brother. My father died and I have like one friend and look awkward. Meanwhile my brother has his father and already dating well. It sucks, huh? Not every day but it sucks on those specific days when you just find it so damn unfair that when compared to one another you aren't the one that is better off in life. 

My advice is what I did, which was get better but in ways that cannot be compared. I still love my brother so the last thing I wanted was to be one of those cliches of people who's entire success was done out of inferiority and competition. I did my own thing and I found my niche and succeeded in those things. Get better for yourself, gain skills you can be proud of and succeed. I can paint, I'm tech savvy, I can bake and cook. I worked through college and did amazing. I know what I want to do with my life, I didn't get into trouble. Things my brother isn't and while I shouldn't compare them smugly to him, I didn't do it because of him and it just helps a bit when things get dark. Basically what I'm saying is build yourself up into the person you want to be so that you can build up the confidence to not be so insecure. You're insecure because you feel yourself lacking in comparison to your sister, so stop lacking and work on yourself so you don't feel as inferior. What you feel is, yeah, a bit sad, but it's natural. You're allowed to feel like your situation is unfair. 

Also, whenever you're ready have a private talk with your mom. She likely thinks all is fairly well with everyone. Telling her one of her kids isn't as fine as she thinks will make her more aware that it isn't sunshine and daisies and parents should be aware of those things. Whether your relationship will change, we don't know, but she will be more mindful things is she does know. Lastly, whatever you do just don't be a little shit. Don't get into trouble. If you think you feel like shit now and then you don't want to know how worse you'll feel when it dawns on you you're the problem child too."
AskReddit,fp15xld,t3_gapqzs,1588225312.0,"I'd argue wedding are a big deal regardless of location. But traditionally weddings were more like a business arrangement between families so a big celebration of it was more like a ceremony for cementing and tying of families/making deals. Plus religion traditionally ties in with it so half assing it was seen as a sign of disrespect to the gods/god since the two are still getting officially married before a deity. And disrespecting your diety meant bad things would happen to them and the families arranging it. Over time this just kinda stuck, that you can't half ass a wedding. It was a status flaunting occasion and as wealth grew throughout the centuries until you reach the present day it's still seen as a status thing. Arranging a shitty wedding reflects bad on your status as a new couple. And if you're religious it's still disrespectful to your deity."

It was my dad and we were close I loved him to bits but it honestly caused me more grief and pain watching him die than after. Life just went on and I cried during the funeral and shed a tear now and then but I never grieved. It's caused our family to even question if I even cared and that hurts more. My dad spent years preparing me for death and the only solace I have is that this is exactly how he told me he wanted me to handle his death. Also from what I remember him describing his mother's death I have handled my parent's death exactly how he handled his own, so another thing we're identical in. I just didn't expect I would be able to do it. The 'healthy way' of handling death is seen as breaking down and then getting back up, so I thought that would be me.

Advice,fp13pju,t3_ga6anp,1588223554.0,"You need to start standing your ground or either A.) It's not going to end and/or B.) It's going to be too late and someone will be dead. Tell your parents you are done, like seriously drive it home, don't take no for an answer say you've had it. Say either they do something or you're calling the cops. If they say you're being dramatic ask if they're sure because if you told this to the authorities you doubt they'd agree. If they're deaf they don't know what it's like. Okay they get to have a nice nights sleep, you don't. Also they never got beaten and their lives threatened so how bad of a parent can you be to not be concerned when one child suffers but constantly play off the actions of the other. This is where I want you to seriously sit and think this through. How done are you? Because the most straight forward option is to start calling the cops. Calling the cops with 'My brother is mentally unstable and is yelling and threatening to beat me with a hockey stick I'm scared for my life.' is going all the way but it will get the job done. Even if they let him go and you get in trouble you would keep doing it and tell your parents you are going to keep doing it until the authorities take him or you out of that hell hole. And if they say you're over reacting you tell them, ""The cops obviously didn't think so since they came when I described what was happening."" You keep calling the cops, if they ask about your situation you tell them everything. Take video too for proof. Post it online pull all the bells. Making a fuss is often people's ways to freedom because it's a form of insurance/support on your side.

I say really think this through because I understand that what I'm  describing sounds like a lot of drama but really from what I""m reading you'd just be exchanging one for the other. Honestly this might go so far as to have authorities remove you from that house but you should honestly see it as a testament of how bad your situation is that normal people would think you should be removed."

Because it takes two to tango and if both don't want it it really shouldn't be done. Your concerns are valid, you guys are YOUNG.

I don't know where you're from I'm in the U.S. and the difference between and 18 year old adult and a 21 year old one in the eyes of paperwork, laws, and opportunity are more important than people ever tell you. It's more than if you want to as well you have to personally sit down and separate him from the equation and think is being thrown into adulthood what you are ready for? Is it what you want right now? Will you be as financially comfortable in that situation as you are right now with your parents? Big decisions this guy is asking of you it's more than 'would you like to live with me'.

It's the midlevel and high level stalking that is bad. A brief bout of online stalking to find out who this dude is, catch their vibe and then leaving it at that is no biggie. Looking up their phone number, the minor details, that's when it get concerning. My friend went on a date and because she was a small young girl her group did the basic 'send us a text ever hour or two'. And when she didn't check in her friends hit me up and said find this dude. (She was fine in the end) What I did was good intentions but it was still stalking.

But up in the stands there was appropriate space between people so I wasn't overwhelmed. And those giant screens really are sharp and big enough that you can see all the details. Plus, and this I think was specific to that concert, but the people had these glowing light sticks that knew your seat location and connected with each other, so if your were in the bleachers you'd see these cool visual effects pan out.

The biggest tip I can give you is to be careful how you word things when talking to people as you handle this. Dont give any hint of 'give me some points, I'm apologizing' or 'woe is me' or 'I'll do anything to get you to forgive me' (sounds cheap, like their forgiveness can be bought) feelings because that might be the deciding factor, how you handle this, on whether people are willing to forgive you.

Advice,fmxio7z,t3_fy08fj,1586465712.0,"1. You need to come to terms with the fact (read: FACT) that you were in an abusive relationship. He was abusive. Every single thing you've described is a textbook example of a possessive, emotionally abusive relationship. The insults? Abusive. The cold shoulder? Abusive. The possessiveness? Abusive. The attempting to get you to turn on someone else? Abusive. The harassment after your relationship was over? Abusive.

2. Once you've come to terms with that you'll find it easier to move one. Because once you've understood it wasn't about you, it was about him abusing you into THINKING it was about you, you'll feel less and less guilt because, again, you did nothing wrong. The guilt is 100% on him you did nothing wrong. You didn't do anything that a reasonable, loving, emotionally stable boyfriend would have had problem with. 

3. Tell your friends. I'm sure you talked about the situation to them somewhat but I think you need to sit and vent out to them even more. Tell them that he emotionally abused and manipulated you and you're starting to realize that because it's all 'over' and yet your still dealing with it's effects and traumatized. If you're close enough to your parents sit down and tell them. Assuming they're the type to support you and care for your well being they're of course going to care about their child. Your friends will provide a cruch to help you. Also maybe talk to the friends he tried to abuse you for interacting with. They likely assumed something was off and would like the full story.

4. See about therapy- this is why I said come clean to your parents if you can. You dont have to even have a sit down therapist (face time if now because quarantine, there are hotlines and online things you can do.

You said he was in a bad family situation so it's possible that that has turned him into this. That being said, don't think you're obligated to forgive the man if you don't want to. In 2020, the age of the internet people know what is and isn't the right thing to do. He had to have know some of the things he was doing was NOT okay. You do not insult the person you claim to love no matter the reason. He isn't stupid but he probably thinks that what he's doing is at least a little normal. Maybe via your friends he'll learn from the grape vine that his behavior was abusive. Maybe if you can ever bring yourself to you can tell him to his face.

But how do you know they even have that cam footage? If you can contact ask for proof. I'd also say demand whoever own that porn account to speak up now. For all you know the blackmailers just made an account with that password themselves. Also seriously buy a cover for your monitors, you should have done that as soon as you got it. Try to figure out with your family if they're even telling the truth. If they are then I guess pay the ransom since your family's reputation means that much, though know they may not delete it."

You could also be in an abused situation to which I again say call a hot line. You're also giving too little details for anyone to give you concrete advice other than save up enough money so you don't end up homeless.

Reassure her that there's nothing wrong with her but you've been going through a lot of issues with depression and you realize now especially is not the time for a relationship especially online. If she tries to convince you that she can be there for you pr etc insist that it isn't that you don't want her anymore it's that you know better than to dive into a relationship when you aren't in your best mind. Just be sure to ha dle any resistance or push back calmly so she doesn't walk away thinking it's her fault.

Either hand over the money now, come clean about why you're keeping it, or someone (because social distancing) is showing up at their front door tomorrow morning to collect it themselves. The trick is to hint that you guys think she's doing something suspicious. If she isn't she'll get mad and hand the money over or finally explain the situation to clear her name. If she is then you finally know and heck storm her house and take stuff to pay yourselves back lol. Paint her as the bad guy until she cracks. If she doesn't take this seriously then make her take it serious. Money is a touchy issue right now, she should know what she's ik inviting by not telling you guys about YOUR money."

Advice,fmpwgqq,t3_fwqusw,1586288594.0,"Unfortunately doxing is so new and especially from a group is so overwhelming that there is no program to help people get out. 

Start with googling yourself and putting everything on lockdown. Have a good password, maybe two step verification, so your account stay your accounts. If you find those impersonation accounts of course report them to the site, email the site and say you're being doxxed, this account is using your photos and information without you permission. The best defense you have is making sure people know so they dismiss this groups actions. Tell your friends, your family, employer etc... they'll provide extra eyes and ears and tell them to inform you if they find run into anything. Also keep track of all this stuff with screen shots. If you want to take it to another level then find information on them. Once you can get their information you can actually sue them with the evidence you picked up. Can't figure out their info and desperate to retaliate? I mean technically you can hire someone to dig up information though I'm personally not sure how to. I don't know how old you or these people are but age doesn't mean anything online at times. Watch them be living with their parents in which case don't think its beneath you to contact those parents. Don't think its beneath you to contact their boss if they are an adult and rat them out. That's if you find info on one of course. For the most part just hold onto your assets, tell everyone around you to beware and wait for the storm to pass. They aren't going to dedicated the rest of their lives to stalking you, eventually their next victim will snatch their attention"

If the workers ask say they need to go to the boss because you've been fired. You need to understand that if you refuse they can't do anything, they aren't your boss anymore. Not just that but if you get hired by some other company you can't be helping competitors. If they pull the friendship card then you do it too. Say while you get that people had to be laid off theyre grown adults and they know they cant go asking so.wone to work for them and not pay anything. You offered to help for less money and they didn't take it. They pay your consulting fee or they leave you alone.

But her friends wedding really was the only chance of finally experiencing a sliver of a 'moment'. She was very excited, getting to dress up, make up, spend time with other people and just have fun.

She got too excited. The bride said the dresses didn't have to be exact just along this color scheme and obviously nothing too flamboyant because this is a wedding after all. My mom went and got a custom dress, okay nothing bad, a but expensive but let my mom feel pretty. Then it went down hill. While shopping for accessories she saw another dress and bought it. I was just watching thinking 'oh no' this dress was not the right color. It was sparkly, it would make her stand out at someone else's wedding. She was buying more accessories, and expensive bag and then more bags. She was BUYING a selection to choose from as opposed to buying what she'd end up choosing. She was so excited she stopped caring about her friends wedding, it was about her. This was her time to finally shine. I legit hated her husband for a second, realizing how much it must have secretly hurtled my mother to never feel beautiful and always be working so hard that she never got to have fun. It was pitiful. We're not even at the wedding yet. Wedding day comes and she's panicking like it's her wedding. Wedding occurs and she's out of color, out of style, her friends are giving each other looks like is this really happening. I try to whisper what's happening and they kind of understand at least why and feel sorry for her. So thankfully the bride doesn't blow up on her, but she's very upset with my mother. Makeup stylist comes and honestly when I saw my mom's face I was freaked out, like I didn't want her looking at me idk what they did to her eyebrows but it was a disaster. But my mom felt like she was having her moment. Wedding goes on and she has her fun unaware of the looks she's getting. It. Was. Sad. Bride was the most open for good reason and barely talked to my mom. As the night tones down and the excitement dwindles my mom has a break down. Crying about how much she spent for no reason on things she can't even return. Of how she ruined the wedding and hurt her friend just because she can't get over never having even a wedding. And people are just staring at her not sure what to do. Some of the nicer bridesmaids are comforting her but she's a wreck and the night ends on a sad drunk note and I apologized to the bride and said I'd take my mom back home now and give the rest of the guests some peace for the remainder of the wedding."
AskReddit,fmmjzql,t3_fw6k33,1586206662.0,"I hate that it takes so much for me to be a teacher. My seniors took a test and got certification. I have to study the subject I want to teach AND Education. I have to take tests, then apply for my credentials. I'm recommend a year after getting my degree as a substitute because credential programs wants rec letters. The credentials is now a 2 years program with a masters because just getting a credentials puts you at a disadvantage. This is a total of 7 years after I graduate high school. Then once I can finally be a teacher I hop from city to city, state to state to find a school that will keep me long enough to give me tenure. Because first hired is first to go but at the same time you don't want to get tenure in a school you don't want to spend the rest of your life in, because it is for life, so you need to find a good school, in a neighborhood you'd want to raise a family and grow old in, then hope they don't lay you off until a newer teacher of your subject is hired to create buffer for you. All this for quite shit pay really. I love teaching and so I prioritize doing what I love over money but why make us just through all these obstacles and dig your heels in at the thought of paying us just a dollar more?"

Advice,fmkluf8,t1_fmkksnt,1586159496.0,"Yeah personally I'm along the lines of Off-White or Fear of God. Those simplistic designs. And most streetwear tends to be that way, simple and even when it goes complex it's attached to an identifying symbol/logo. Streetware is admittedly a lot about the reputation and being able to identify exactly what the guy/girl over there has and attaching that brand reputation to the person for having obtained it. Not saying it can't be streetwise, because there's those outliers. It'll take some smart marketing moves to make it catch with streetwear and if it does indeed catch then the fact that it's so different in style can actually become it's identifying feature and make it distinguishable. But also I can see this being big with Bohemian lovers. Who knows, this can become the Lululemon of bohemian wear, but I don't know much about that style and to me at least it doesn't look like brand is as big a thing there as it is with streetwear so going big might actually harder with that style but there's a first for anything. So risk it all with streetwear where you may burn but if you succeed you're golden. Or take the grueling route of trying to be the Lululemon of bohemian."
