AmItheAsshole,fpkouss,t1_fpkje9w,1588698463.0,But then how will everyone in this sub know that women are bad???????
SelfAwarewolves,fpgtwmc,t1_fpgbawr,1588609437.0,Your religion promotes some of the worst misogyny I’ve ever seen. I know Mormon girls and they are crazy as a result of the weird brainwashing from their churches and families. How can I “understand” differently? And don’t try to tell me these are just “exceptions” or “individuals” I’ve seen it way to many times. These practices and ideas are a part of Mormonism.

ENLIGHTENEDCENTRISM,fp6eitn,t1_fp61mlk,1588350968.0,I’m pretty sure the mods straight up stopped doing anything
AmITheAngel,fp6cw5p,t1_fp663gp,1588350170.0,It’s because fake AITA validation posts always have to have the part where “everyone thinks I’m an asshole” so they can justify why they’re posting on reddit. OP just took it to the extreme lmao
coaxedintoasnafu,foh8vbc,t1_foh4a2m,1587761971.0,"Yeah, I was trying to continue OP’s joke. He’s mocking coaxedintoasnafu in this comic"
coaxedintoasnafu,foh2pse,t1_foh2dd4,1587759852.0,OP is suggesting that about the top comments in THIS subreddit
coaxedintoasnafu,foh1stk,t3_g76yzd,1587759551.0,"Guys look I’m so good at comedy I reduced the purpose of a popular subreddit down to baby talk and drew some pictures to go with it. Nuance doesn’t exist. I’m so clever because I disagree with people and that makes me better than them. Hahahaha look how many people agree with me, that means I must be better than all the other reditors, the people who agree with them r dumb. I mean just look how dumb they are in my dumb picture."

AmITheAngel,fobljjy,t1_fob73yd,1587661050.0,One of my comments got removed for rule 1 bc I said “attention whore”
survivinginfidelity,fo9jmnd,t1_fo8ud7r,1587621432.0,"I disagree with what you said about being a father. My dad’s father passed away when he was young, and my dad considers his stepfather to be fully his “father” and I consider him my grandfather. (I didn’t even know we weren’t related by blood until my parents mentioned it when I was older). Yes the biological father is unique, but doesn’t hold some special “irreplaceable” status in my eyes. I think that someone not related to you by blood can absolutely be your dad."

AmITheAngel,fo731ld,t1_fo72b6z,1587571364.0,Yeah the people who spend years studying to become practicing doctors and the people who have babies at 26 don’t have very much overlap
AmITheAngel,fo6xjl4,t3_g5vs1g,1587568578.0,"A bunch of comments start out with “wow, that... was a read. NTA.” 

Like how do you make it all the way through this jumbled mess of AITA tropes and STILL not have the thought “ya know, this might not be real!”"
ENLIGHTENEDCENTRISM,fnspwq3,t1_fnqwsd6,1587226538.0,I’ve never seen a sub die in such a perfectly ironic way

TheRightCantMeme,fnp36hn,t1_fnp0sny,1587138416.0,"Especially uneducated white women. 53% of white women voted for trump, but when you compare women with a college education vs. no college education, the difference shows (with college it was 50/50, without it was 60% for trump). Side note: this is exit poll data, so it’s not necessarily the most accurate imo."
badwomensanatomy,fnp1jlp,t1_fnonrg9,1587137606.0,"I mostly agree, except I definitely don’t think about my clit on a daily basis"
ENLIGHTENEDCENTRISM,fnp13yp,t3_g2t53n,1587137377.0,"1) this post isn’t enlightened centrism, it’s  some random shitty defense of a “nazi trump supporter.” It doesn’t say he’s “just as bad as the other side,” instead it just tries to give excuses for why it’s not that bad. 2) This guy is a troll and there is photo evidence to prove that. He took this photo in front of the trump supporters and then left."

AskReddit,fnmw9x3,t1_fnmc822,1587079391.0,"But true feminists don’t criticize men for problems. They critique and examine the patriarchy, a social structure that places power with men and not with women. I think it’s interesting what you mentioned with men not “having the option” to stay at home while women do. The thing is, under a patriarchal system men have all the options- they can stay at home or work - where women do not - they cannot choose to work or stay at home. However, there was definitely a social stigma for men being homemakers, but this has mostly faded along with the stigma that women shouldn’t work (these two are correlated, IMO). This happened largely because women were able to work. This is the work of the feminist movement. It is in the interest of feminism for men to have the same options (socially and legally) of staying at home vs. working. So basically, feminists aren’t ignoring men’s issues, and many instances of inequalities men face originate from the very patriarchy that feminists oppose."
AskReddit,fnmv223,t1_fnmetbl,1587078711.0,"Hmmm this model doesn’t seem to work for members of the gay community. That’s ok, I’m sure you took them into consideration somehow, right?"
AmITheAngel,fnlfnva,t3_g2h6tb,1587052724.0,"I cannot stand how fickle the people on AITA are. One minute 18 and 19 year olds are “just kids” and the next they expect 14 year olds to learn lessons about paying bills and taking on debt. It’s whatever is convenient for their stupid NTA verdict. (Also I just want to mention that there is a HUGE difference between being 14 and being 20, so yeah the sister is gonna have a different understanding of the situation than her older sister)

Edit: sister not brother"
AmITheAngel,fng0tbj,t1_fnfy2hx,1586919682.0,"One commenter in that thread insisted that “pregnancy hormones can make you seriously insane.” Like, uh, no they can’t? They mess around with cravings and nausea and mood swings but it’s not like they turn women into psychopaths"

Cooking,fmzuw36,t1_fmzopam,1586530032.0,"No offense, but you sound more old, grumpy, and judgemental than critical here. To me this reads entirely as “back in my day things were better!!”"
AmITheAngel,fmwhpbx,t3_fxueov,1586446779.0,It’s just straight up impossible to believe anyone would act like that. Douche bags exist but holy shit this was written like a screenplay.
survivinginfidelity,fmv0v15,t3_fxij3h,1586403334.0,"“Stay together for the kids” is a gross idea. You should do what’s best for the kids, and that doesn’t always mean staying together."
berkeley,fmuz6yk,t1_fmuwyka,1586402217.0,Checked his post history and he actually is LOL. He’s in for an interesting time if/when he comes here. Honestly I’m still laughing at a high schooler lecturing a Berkeley student on “passion for CS”
relationship_advice,fmuockz,t1_fmuo049,1586395414.0,"Ok, but they still would have been just as happy and together for the same amount of time even if they weren’t married so young. The way I see it, why risk it? If you really are going to be together forever just get married later. There’s no need to trap yourself. On the other hand, if you’re married at age 20, and then decide you don’t want to be with your partner when you’re 27, you’ll have to go through a divorce instead of a break up."
relationship_advice,fmumx35,t1_fmubs82,1586394564.0,"Oh no how could things possibly go south when you’re married to your high school boyfriend and you started living together at 19??? It baffles me that some people don’t realize how long their life will last - if you marry and live with someone you met before you turned 20, you’re now stuck with that person for the majority of your life (or you’ll have to go through a divorce, and those suck)"

Do you think you could find a picture where his butthole is showing? So I can properly mourn his loss."
relationships,fmsqibi,t1_fms9gg3,1586360372.0,"20 year old women are adults, not naive teens! I am 20 and I understand the implications of moving in with a man 7 years older than me. Also “isn’t comfortable living with strangers” is BS. If you’re in a university, you either find roommates or you’re fucked. This guy sure as hell isn’t her last option. Honestly he shouldn’t even be an option. There is clearly something going on between them."
