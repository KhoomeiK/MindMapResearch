berkeley,fom0hex,t1_folm0zd,1587875003.0,You think so? Its been almost 2 months since I submitted my verification :/
berkeley,folfn2m,t1_fol6mm7,1587861200.0,To add on though be careful bc spring enrollment is different from fall enrollment for UGBA. For spring there was no waitlist and there were a ton of empty seats and fall I think there was. It differs due to demand.

It's subjective so as long as you think in terms of optimism you can find it :). I know that when I first came it didn't live up to my views and I was upset because I thought that college would be a lot more fun and thrilling, but when I got into a routine and learned to be positive and optimistic I loved it, and I am someone who has struggled with mental health in the past and Cal made me forget that I even had issues. Also don't worry about the schoolwork part, pushing yourself is NOT a bad thing, and if you really care about school you can find yourself enjoying it because you will feel productive and meaningful--which is a common aspect of happiness. Good luck!! Seriously don't worry too much. Cal has a stigma of being a cesspool of unhappiness but if YOU look for it you *can* find it."
berkeley,fn3n8bb,t1_fn2airl,1586624104.0,Would econ 140 also be a not good idea? I'd have taken stat 2([assist.org](https://assist.org) equivalent but my actual class included probability so like stat 20 I guess)

berkeley,flt84od,t1_flrroy0,1585462417.0,I think Cal def has more recognition overall than UCLA and the connections could hold more weight for Bay Area jobs. Ultimately I would visit both campuses and see which you like better as you can gauge the vibes a little better. I know it helped me a lot since you can tell a lot from being on the campus
