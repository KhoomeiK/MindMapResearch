nintendo,fokw7v2,t3_g7vuf0,1587850126.0,"Going outside with some friends! Its been a while since I’ve been able to really socialize. I’m also looking forward to camping, watching the sunset, and listening to music with family"
UCSD,fnusae6,t3_g3xpkk,1587269765.0,"I totally understand your situation. For the past few weeks, I’ve almost felt different. There’s no simple way to put it, but it felt like I just lost a purpose. Like The things I thought would make me happy kinda fell through. I wouldn’t say it was depression or anything serious but I was definitely feeling out of the ordinary. The thing that got me to feel better last week is just to exercise a little here and there. You definitely don’t have to do full body exercises or anything but just having something to keep you active seems to help me. I’d recommend you try it and listen to some music to see if it helps! 
Another thing that might help is to call friends often. This is still something I’m working on tbh haha 
Good luck!"
