UCSantaBarbara,fpkzrrz,t3_gduy3m,1588703859.0,I took 4 CS courses this quarter thinking it would be easier to keep up with them being online. I was so fuckin wrong. I've been behind for like weeks now and I feel like at this point it's impossible to really catch up. Really taking a toll on my mental health and I barely feel like I'm able to find time for myself and to work on my own projects and such instead of solely focusing on school work.

buildapcforme,fp1x0ge,t1_fp1tegj,1588250122.0,Honestly probably the best build for the price point.
buildapcforme,fp1wtko,t3_gartxc,1588249980.0,"You won't be able to find something as good as an Xbox at that price point unfortunately, unless you get really lucky and maybe buy some used parts. Reason being, Xbox sells the actual hardware for low profit margins, if not at a loss, because they make up the cost in keeping you in their ecosystem with GOLD, Game Pass, Microsoft Store, etc. 

Problem is you can't really migrate your Xbox games to PC, so most people keep buying the newer Xbox instead of buying a PC so they don't have to re-buy their old games or restart save files.  

My recommendation is: either save up bit more to around $800-$1000 to build a PC (keeping in mind you'll have to re-buy any games you want to play. On a side note, there's a good site called isthereanydeal.com that'll get you better prices for games), or option 2: just buy a new Xbox. I'd go for a One X if you can find one for $400, not sure what they go for these days. Otherwise go for an S."
buildapcforme,fosga9w,t1_fos22ms,1588030130.0,"Right, that makes sense not to go for storage, but paying another $100+ for less than 5% performance boost just doesn't make sense to me. The only benefit is the extra cores, but my personal system has zero issues streaming so it's definitely not necessary.

Personally, I would recommend something like this: [https://pcpartpicker.com/list/b3Wftp](https://pcpartpicker.com/list/b3Wftp)Only differences are the Ryzen 5 3600, switching the motherboard out for an x570 for better future-proofing, and a slightly better PSU for upgrades in the future. OP can decide obviously what they want to go with. but I just think if you're only going to get 5% better performance for $100, you might as well make improvements in other areas so that when you do buy a new processor say 5 years down the line, it'll actually be worth the upgrade.

&#x200B;

EDIT: I guess everyone else is recommending the 3700X kinda standard as part of the desire to stream. That's fine, I just know from personal experience that the 3600 works perfectly fine with a game running alongside the streaming application and a bunch of other background processes."
buildapcforme,foquiqo,t1_foqav3n,1588001065.0,"I have a similar setup. You can definitely just go with a Ryzen 5 3600 CPU on this. I know everybody and their grandmother is putting this in their PC Part Pickrr lists, but for a $1200 budget, it's hard to beat. The 3700X only offers minor improvements for about $150 more, which could get him a like 500 GB - 1 TB M.2 SSD or something."
