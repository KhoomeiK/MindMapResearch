UCI,fpbcp5a,t3_gceoiq,1588467011.0,"I’m not a fan, I find it highly concerning and the fact that it alters settings on our computer, sometimes without acknowledging us what it is that they’re doing. Say what you will about setting up something to return settings back to normal after closing respondus, how is that our responsibility as students to figure it out ourselves. If teachers are so adament about using Respondis, how about they use it as well and see how comfortable they feel using the software. Yes we sometimes download things that may be as sketchy as Respondus, the difference being, we choose to install those things vs us being forced to download them."
UCI,fpas6qr,t3_gca3bw,1588454600.0,"to all the TAs and Professors understanding of the big stress of being home, learning online, and above all else dealing with the virus. Thank you for accepting the late assignments full credit, thank you for letting us take exams without proctoring, thank you for making exams less stressful, thank you for being available."
UCI,fp6xx6u,t1_fp6cjf0,1588360523.0,wow if only all of us were computer experts
UCI,fp0i5ot,t3_gahaom,1588209748.0,Same
UCI,fokeuz9,t3_g7pqp1,1587840770.0,"The fact is that there already isn’t enough housing for all students as it is, meaning adding 50% of freshman to that pool will either mean some students will literally be “homeless” or will have to get a farther away apartment and find their method of transportation to campus. This seems HIGHLY unlikely for UCI force freshman to do or force other undegrads to do and I can’t imagine them during Winter or Spring reconfiguring the single and double rooms into doubles, triples and quads. Universities are by far the easiest way for diseases and viruses to transmit, the sad, yet most probable future is online 20-21 school year."
UCI,fokecy0,t1_foirxx7,1587840504.0,Is she really that great? Is this for Stats 120C
UCI,foke3vj,t3_g7r544,1587840370.0,"I fear that you’re opinion is shared by most especially if there’s no reduction in tuition, most people will choose the in class version and it’ll be too dangerous for that amount of congregation of people. Also I mean most of the profs are old meaning higher risk and UCI won’t want to compromise their safety."
UCI,fody7dn,t3_g6zfxu,1587692380.0,Irvine Public transport is not the best BY A LONG SHOT. We have a couple good bus systems but nothing as grand or wonderful as DTLA. A car would help greatly but there are some ways to get around without one.
UCI,fo9q52k,t1_fo9eik0,1587627305.0,"bruh housing market does not affect Irvine Company and ACC housing the way rates change is if the rent goes up, ain’t never seen ACC LOWER rent. University Housing has been exploited at the expense of students. These apartments are not worth the average 1k that students pay, a double room should be 500 and a single 750, market price. IT DOES NOT MATTER WHAT THE HOUSING MARKET IT, without students you’re market is gone, don’t exploit us because we need you."
UCI,fo7nm03,t3_g64976,1587581410.0,"RESPONDUS is the absolute worst, literally uninstalls the webcam from my laptop then says it can’t find a webcam, LIKE EXCUSE ME YOU UNINSTALLED IT. I literally wasted so much time that I could’ve spent on my exam cause respondus screwed up my laptop. I literally had to pull out my old, slow ass laptop from High School download and install respondus and then take the exam like 30 minutes later. Respondus is the worst thing to ever exist."
UCI,fo7nd1a,t1_fo78992,1587581287.0,is this for Stats 120C? Lol glad I dropped it before Week 2
UCI,fo7c6hv,t1_fo760l3,1587575840.0,"the thing is not everyone knew they’d have to use respondus, for example, only 2 of my classes are using it and others are just letting the quizzes and exams be open note. If you could kindly also email OIT with the concerns even though you are unaffected it would help out a lot."
UCI,fo16bip,t3_g5328k,1587426639.0,"Bus Admin courses are not as difficult as our other courses esp Engineering plus professors in the school of business are incredibly nice and approachable meaning the potential for good grades is really high. Bus Admin profs want to see you succeed and their classes are created towards you getting an A, no fret. Now if we talking Engineering profs, it’s a whole nother thing."
UCI,fo161gs,t3_g53x2p,1587426473.0,"I’m not sure why they would ever need to but I’m assuming not, but I mean they do have access to anything you do while using their WIFI because I’m sure somewhere you agreed in some form that using UCI WiFi allows for that breach of privacy"
UCI,fnxntfp,t1_fnwl4cs,1587342560.0,"Same, I wasn’t in the course but my roomies were and so I went to one of their DISCUSSIONs not lecture but discussion and my LORDDDDD, they said it TWAS easy but my goodness it was so much info and honestly seemed like a lot of work. It may have been “easy” but it’s lots of work. In my opinion easy courses are those that are both easy in material and workload so that should be specified when people say it’s “easy”"

UCI,fn7tokh,t3_g03g66,1586727423.0,"bruh wtf ACC should allow students to shift their lease, SUMMER SESSION is remotr"
UCI,fn1u7r4,t1_fn0dku0,1586570220.0,"Yes but in COMPARISON to Irvine, it’s likely a high quality job will be in LA. Don’t be rude and negative, I’m just saying a fact DTLA has a large amount of jobs availability and easier to transport around via public transportation meaning no cars necessary. Whereas Irvine has the sh*tiest public transport meaning even if you get a good job, you’ll need a car to get there. Don’t be rude."
UCI,fn0knjp,t1_fmyyw1q,1586543691.0,"So tbh with you, they aren’t going to rescind based on this semesters grades so I think you’re in the clear. But as for last semester, I thought that for UCS you had to update your fall semester grades in like January, although not sending an official transcript you just had to input your grades via the UC app website. Meaning if they already knew your grades for fall semester and still accepted you, then you’re in the clear."
UCI,fn0kcvt,t1_fmyyw1q,1586543532.0,"Ok I am so sorry for asking, I just would not feel comfortable proving beneficial advice to someone who did such a thing especially if the advice is about getting into my school."
UCI,fn0k4g0,t1_fn0f9hw,1586543407.0,"Bruh it’s more like $8000 to $12,000. Ain’t no one paying $6,000 per year, that’d be too cheap for Irvine housing because we are a “SAFE” city."

UCI,fmtfuyn,t3_fx1lj9,1586372009.0,"The thing is that this ain’t like the chicken pox meaning even after someone gets it and recovers, it doesn’t necessarily mean they cannot catch it again. What this means is that until theres a vaccine or literally every single person is cured and every area is disinfected, it’s gonna be a long while before things will return to normal. Additionally even if the situation clears itself by fall, we as a society cannot go immediately from social distancing back to full social contact we need to ease our way back in because our minds, bodies and immune systems are not prepared for that kind of shock."
UCI,fmrirv1,t3_fx05pc,1586324465.0,"Real competitive, they accept like 10 transfer majors every quarter."

UCI,fmo2rbr,t1_fmnywik,1586243268.0,"The opportunities are better at a private university because the resources available by a school like USC are way better than UCI. This is mainly because private schools are more expensive but the money of the private schools allow for better resources. Also USC being a private school means smaller class size which means a more personal attention from professors which can lead to better letters of rec and research opportunities. The smaller class sizes makes it feel a lot more like high school which makes learning a lot better tbh in the 200+ student classes im enrolled in, it just doesn’t feel like I’m being heard."
UCI,fmnnz71,t1_fmeuyo2,1586230623.0,"YES! Nearly all bus admin courses are offered over summer while a very limited amount of engineering courses are offered over summer. ADDITIONALLY, most of the bus admin courses offered over summer are offered online so you can manage to get a job/internship and do your courses. Yes it’s true they may not share that many courses, they only share like 2 intro math courses and 1 econ courses. However bus admin majors take at most like 20 classes required for their major. Meaning over the 12 quarters, you only need to take 1-2 major courses and get the bus admin degree and if you do a couple summers, HELL even just one summer of courses, you can manage to take one extra course per quarter to get your bus admin degree."
UCI,fmnnaxc,t3_fwallc,1586230135.0,USC!!! Arguably the amount you’ll save in housing will be equal to amount you’ll save in tuition. USC has higher prestige and better opportunities just by being a private school. Plus I mean USC is in the hub of DTLA meaning a future internship is likely to sprout in DTLA which is beneficial for you cause the commute from your school to work will just minuscule and you can likely use public transportation to get there rather than having to eventually purchase a car. USCs environment compared to UCI is 1000000 tines better and getting around LA compared to Irvine is way better.
UCI,fmm9wot,t3_fv9cbg,1586201485.0,"I think it’s really different for UCI and other UCs because in most schools you end up living in dorm like housing for all the years you go to the school, but at UCI after your first year you’re basically in a apartment with 2-3 other people who may or may not be people who are your friends since ACC housing apps suck. Apartment living is really different from dorming because unlike the dorms, you’re most likely not gonna be buddy buddy with your neighbors."
UCI,fmm9ltp,t3_fvvjvi,1586201329.0,"Bruh I’m sure the MIDDLE EARTH gym will be a lot nicer considering it’s gonna be brand new. I don’t think it has the more hardcore equipment, but it has the basics of a gym: weights, cardio machines, pull up bar, pull downs (triceps, back) and a couple leg machines. They don’t have a lot of the more dangerous machines like bench press of squat racks because it adds a lot more liability and their staff is not like typical gym staff, they’re literally there to scan you in."
UCI,fmjnt3d,t3_fvnol6,1586134077.0,"You gotta email your academic advisor, and tbh the amount of units doesn’t really matter, it’s the difficulty and workload of the courses that really matters."
