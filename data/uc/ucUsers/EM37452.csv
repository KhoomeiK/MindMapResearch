demisexuality,fpl39rp,t1_fpkfvrc,1588705598.0,Maybe identification or signaling things about you to others? Since people are generally assumed to be aro and straight I think flags of some kind could be a useful way to signal to others that you're not that?

JustAFluBro,fpjpyw4,t1_fpjiqhm,1588677460.0,Thank you for illustrating my point
BDSMAdvice,fpjbscn,t3_gdr32k,1588662876.0,I'm a nonmonogamous person so take this with a grain of salt. But ultimately you can't prevent her from doing anything. You can warn her about what your boundaries are and that if she continues to participate in this the relationship between you and her will end but ultimately she may decide to leave you over it. If I were you I would think very seriously about what your hard boundaries are before talking with her and what you really feel so strongly against that you'd be willing to end the relationship over. Then tell her what your boundaries are and be firm.
JustAFluBro,fpjb1qs,t3_gdl2at,1588662164.0,I liked this post more before I read all of OPs follow up comments
AreTheStraightsOK,fpgwncu,t1_fpg2r0p,1588610838.0,"Agreed. I think the issue isn't the fact a specific person isn't attracted to heavier or short people, but that traits in a person who are seen as ""undesirable"" are often policed by the peers of people who are attracted to that body type. So, for instance, men who are primarily attracted to bigger girls might be made fun of for being ""chubby chasers"" or women might say ""ew hes shorter than you"". It's not only the fact that maybe there's a smaller pool of people attracted to those with certain physical characteristics, but also the stigma can deplete their dating pool even more or lead to people sleeping with them in secret because they're embarrassed which is just fucked up"
AreTheStraightsOK,fpgv5s9,t1_fpggjn2,1588610083.0,"I think if you are attracted to someone but have a ""rule"" about not dating a person of a certain body type you should go to therapy to work that out.

nonmonogamy,fp7jy8e,t1_fp7fdbj,1588372037.0,"I think that shouldn't be the expectation though. There are primary partners who are experienced and allow their partners to have long term fulfilling relationships, so to say that it's not the responsibility of the people who are exploring and don't know what they want to communicate where they're at, but rather on the secondary to always be prepared for things to collapse doesn't seem to allow for secondaries to fully jump into the dynamics they're offered"
nonmonogamy,fp7777f,t1_fp76p8u,1588365303.0,I completely agree with everything you said. I do think that there are instances where veto's after establishment of a relationship is ethical though and that is when the other person is abusive.
nonmonogamy,fp7513n,t1_fp746ks,1588364174.0,"I meant to show respect and consideration for your secondaries is basic human decency. Not following my suggestions to the letter. Upon reflecting on your responses I am under the impression that you are in a DNDT of sorts will all of your partners except for the fact that other partners exist (but no cross communication about dynamics across relationships), is that true? Because I'm not saying that's wrong. On the contrary, I think it's totally fine to have lack of communication be an expectation as long as that is informed upfront and agreed to. I'm advocating against dynamics where people aren't aware of or refuse to communicate with their partners what they can offer them and don't set up appropriate expectations to what their secondaries are agreeing to. The specific relationship model I was talking about is one where there is an expectation of communication by the secondary partner, but they don't receive it and that's what my suggestions for communication were geared towards"
nonmonogamy,fp70mk7,t1_fp6zhv6,1588361893.0,"I think you are imposing a lot of intentions on my post that I don't actually have. My main point is that secondary relationship are relationships with real people who also get hurt and their feelings need to be considered. My specifics were more guidelines for what I think are easy ways to communicate with your secondary so they are aware of what they are agreeing to. But i only said you should be clear about what you can offer and to give information about impending possibilities of it ending rather than blind siding them. Obviously people communicate differently and there are going to be some dynamics where specifics of communication will work smoothly in ways different than how I described, but my post was motivated by MANY instances of primary couples completely disregarding the emotions of their secondary partners, only to abruptly end relationships with no discussion, communication or explanation and very heavily hurting those people and I don't think that saying that's not ethical is closed minded"
nonmonogamy,fp6zy1i,t1_fp6zdj0,1588361550.0,"I've had a very similar experience in multiple different relationship dynamics. The most recent time I was broken up with over issues with the primary relationship though, my meta took me aside and explained her reasonings to me directly and told me she was aware it wasn't my fault but how his and my relationship caused communication issues with their relationship and they needed to put their relationship first. I was very sad but I felt so respected and had answers to all my questions and it made it so much easier than in prior experiences where the meta had no intention of meeting me. It really made a world of difference and I hope I can be that considerate when my current primary gets a secondary"
nonmonogamy,fp6ylrj,t1_fp6y0sy,1588360869.0,"I think respect for others should be universal. And I've noticed it's very common for primary relationships to be so concerned for each other's emotional well being that they completely discount the feelings of secondary partners. And I personally believe that when you open your relationship you lose the right to certain aspects of privacy (not everything, but things that could have a direct impact on the secondary partner). This is for hierarchical relationship models though. For just hookups or anything where an expectation of strictly casual is communicated I don't think this applies. But it's unfair to offer someone a relationship but then not give them any indication of what they can depend on in that relationship. I think if that's the only thing that ""works for you"" as the primary couple you shouldn't have secondary partners, you should stick to hook ups and more casual encounters with others"
nonmonogamy,fp6xc1q,t1_fp6w2xw,1588360225.0,"Out of curiosity, which of those things would be unappealing to you if you were the secondary? And I definitely think if the secondary is uncomfortable with that much communication then obviously it should be adjusted. I guess my point is that even in hierarchical relationship models, it's not just the primary relationship that should be the focus of comfortability. The secondary deserves the updated information they need to opt in or out and readjust their expectations."
nonmonogamy,fp6je3y,t1_fp6iu7r,1588353353.0,"Additionally, I think it helps to think of ways of coping with your jealousy in a way that is productive in the relationship. Talking and expressing emotions is important, but when I have nervous fear of being left I focus my energy into doing house chores, making special surprises for my partner, etc. That way I can focus my obsessive energy into something that assures me I'm a good partner and worthy of love (which is my fear usually when I'm jealous). Also then it takes less stress off my partner and they are able to give me more emotional support over my jealousy without it turning into only fun with the other partner and only hostile jealousy energy with me"
nonmonogamy,fp6iu7r,t3_gbej96,1588353086.0,"I would like to point out there has been new research on the long term sexual desires of men and women in monogamous partners and women on average have the same decline in sexual attraction to their monogamous partner between years 1 and 4 that men have over the course of 10 years. 

There is more and more research that discount the theory that men are the ones more inclined for sexual variety, and in fact suggest the opposite is true. 

Because of this I would try to keep in mind that there is nothing wrong with you or your relationship with her because she desires sex outside of the relationship, even if she desires it more. 

I personally am like this. I love my partner with all my heart. I think he's sexy and I love the sex we have. I would never want anyone else as a primary partner, but my sex drive dies when he's my only partner. It gets jump started when either one of us is seeing someone else. It's not really about any short comings in our relationship or sex life, it's just a form of variety that is exciting. The new relationship honeymoon phase makes me hornier in a way that I just don't get in long term relationships with one person. 

I don't know if this helps you change your perspective in a way that makes it easier, but this has been my experience. Also, having the freedom to explore my needs with others makes me so grateful and reinforces my love for my primary. After hooking up with someone else or a great date I'm flooded with love because my partner is the one who allows himself to go through discomfort so I can have such a great experience. And I make sure to return the favor when I can"

nonmonogamy,fp2uwmj,t3_gatdwn,1588268294.0,"Since many people have commented here on the strategies of the couples here I would like to comment on my own experience with what I learned I needed to do to protect myself as the potential unicorn. 

When I was younger and engaging in threesomes with partnered couples I think I was often so worried about not stepping on their toes or not wanting to over step my boundaries that I didn't advocate for my needs the way I would now. Now that doesn't mean that a hetero couple doesn't need to hold themselves accountable, but I realized I wasn't doing my due diligence on the intentions of the couple I was getting involved with the same way I would with a single man who I had known for an equally long period of time. There are questions you can ask to get a read on a situation when dating that feels natural when talking to a single person (what are you looking for? Have you done this before? Are you still friends with your last partners? What are you into? Etc) that can feel weird to ask to a preexisting couple. I understand some couples lie because they want to get with you, but I think there's a lot you can figure out through conversation before you let your guard down. 

If a couple views you as an accessory to their sex life versus a 3 dimensional person, they are probably unlikely to ask you many questions about yourself and your feelings and desires. I don't think there's anything inherently wrong with couples looking for a third like I don't think there's anything wrong with someone looking for a hookup on Tinder, but you need to be aware that there are some people who see you as a conquest rather than a person and it might take more effort to weed those people out."
polyamory,fp2ms3g,t1_fp1znk6,1588264426.0,"I think there are some ways in which people state deal breakers that are okay and give people the agency to choose, and there are ways in which it's a manipulation tactic. 

I personally think the difference is inviting the no, much like how to ask someone out in a way that reduces pressure. ""hey, I just I discovered that this is a thing about me I can't/ won't live without. If you aren't into it then we should break up and I completely understand if that's the choice you make"" is a very different way of framing the same thing as ""well I need to choke during sex or it does nothing for me. So if you can't do the one thing I need then we should just break up right now!""

One is stating a choice and telling the other person they have the option to make it a deal breaker for them too. The other is a threat and framed as a false choice. That person isn't given time to think and explore whether or not that is a true boundary, they are being told they have to or they are the bad person who ruined the relationship. 

I would be curious to hear what others think though. What are the distinguishing factors for you all between breaking up as a manipulation and setting a deal breaker boundary around sex,or can those be distinguished in your eyes?"
polyamory,fp2kn9o,t1_fp1yrwd,1588263389.0,"I agree with the fact that there are issues of power dynamics that often arise but I think when you make things a consent issue that often times implies a burden of responsibility on one partner that may not be fair. 

For instance, let's say there's a mono married hetero couple where the woman makes all the money and the man stays at home and doesn't really have the skills or experience to make more than minimum wage. Then the man's sex drive completely dies. The wife communicates after many months of celibacy that she's unwilling to live the rest of her life with a partner who won't have sex with her. The man is now faced with a choice, face the repercussions of a break up he can't financially handle, or have sex he doesn't want to. 

This is a bad situation, but I also don't think it's fair to tell the wife since she has unequal power that naturally emerged over the course of a marriage that she is not allowed to set her own boundaries and deal breakers, otherwise she is coercing him and violating his consent. Ultimately he does have a choice, but he is being pressured by external factors. But I think in those situations if you make it an issue of violating consent, the wife in that situation would be expected to suck it up and be unallowed to set her own boundaries within her relationship dynamic"
polyamory,fp2jklh,t1_fp1m26x,1588262861.0,"I completely agree with this. My example of ""you either conform or break up"" was given from the stance of a new relationship being formed not an existing one. So communicating boundaries upfront, rather than a response to your partners already communicated boundaries. I think it's very easy to unintentionally manipulate people once love and intense feelings are involved, so verbally acknowledging that the issue can be a deal breaker for both parties and that they can split over it on good terms is very important for any deal breakers that are discovered during an existing relationship dynamic"
polyamory,fp0nlpn,t1_fp0dw58,1588212923.0,I know of various instances of people being mono under duress. I think it's just not named because mono is the standard relationship model
polyamory,fp0nd1k,t1_fp0et2w,1588212779.0,"I agree with this completely. There are many times in a relationship where someone might feel pressured to do something, but that pressure isn't necessarily being imposed on them by their partner. They may feel pressure because they want to make their partner happy or they don't want the relationship to end, but unless that pressure is specifically being imposed upon them by their partner, in my opinion, it isn't an issue of consent but rather needing to explore ones own boundaries and stick up for their wants and needs. 

I think it's a hard thing because there genuinely are people who threaten to break up as a way of manipulating their partner into every little thing, but if a point really is a deal breaker, they should be allowed to express that fact honestly to their partner. This is the line that I think is the most sticky, but I personally think if you make a clear declaration on boundaries ""it's this or we break up"" and you stick too that without any argument if the other person says ""fine, then we break up"" it's an issue of incompatibility rather than consent"
polyamory,fp0eh4m,t1_fp0c6va,1588207696.0,I agree with this. If ENM/ mono is truly a deal breaker for both people and they are both aware then it shouldn't take more than one conversation to realize there's an incompatibility and they need to break up. But often either one or both parties is undecided on if it's a deal breaker or not and it takes experimentation to learn what the limits are for both people.
polyamory,fp0cw3h,t3_gakh6o,1588206835.0,"I agree with many of your points and we discussed certain aspects of this earlier but here is my point:

I think you have to assume that people have agency in their choices and in their relationships. Many times the ""duress"" in poly under duress comes when two people realize they have different desires and are A. entering into a new dynamic or B. considering to end an existing dynamic. I don't think either party should feel forced into conforming to a relationship dynamic if that is absolutely not what they want or if their partner is trying to make them, but I think it's perfectly okay for one person to say ""this is a deal breaker of mine. You need to either conform or we can't date"" and the other person to agree to something that they don't necessarily want or even don't feel comfortable with. 

If this is in any way coerced by their partner or the threat of breaking up is being used as a manipulation tactic rather than simply stating boundaries I do NOT think that's okay. Additionally if this really is a deal breaker for both parties, the two should break up. 

But I don't agree with the idea that something is only consensual when both parties feel comfortable and excitedly want to participate, both in relationships and with sex. Enthusiastic consent can be given by someone who is not necessarily enthusiastic about the act (or relationship dynamic), but enthusiastic about what it might mean to the relationship and to their partner. I think kinks are a good analogy, there are soft and hard limits. Hard limits should be left alone, but soft limits are open for discussion and can be negotiated if it's something that is not preferred by one partner but important to the other. 

Ultimately no one should engage in anything in a relationship that is traumatic, causes contempt, or that they are manipulated into doing by not being able to set their own boundaries or their boundaries being ignored. But I don't think no one should do things they aren't comfortable with. Relationships are about compromise and some times that will take you out of your comfort zone. As long as both parties have relatively equative power and can withdraw consent at any time, engaging in dynamics they wouldn't otherwise can be consensual"

sex,foxfjb5,t3_ga2cdn,1588142437.0,"I get that you're worried about the things she said sticking in your mind, but if that's the main reason you're planning on ending things I would recommend therapy for you/ you two. Obviously some of the stuff she said dug deep and I don't think ending things with her is a magic fix that will make you forget any of the things she said. If you believe she's genuine and there are no other break up worthy issues in the relationship I say stay with her. What she did was fucked up, but to add an alternative perspective I am a female who is with the most amazing guy I have ever met. Honestly I couldn't ask for someone better. And sometimes it gets fucking AWKWARD when my female friends are talking shit about guys who genuinely treat them like trash and I've got nothing significant at all. So its very possible she was just trying to fit in and said things she didn't mean. Not that that's okay, but for what it's worth I don't think you should internalize it any more than you can help"
nonmonogamy,foupc82,t1_foup71s,1588088158.0,That's fair. I've enjoyed discussing and would be interested in continuing if you make a post
nonmonogamy,fouo803,t1_foundxa,1588087607.0,"I haven't heard anything here that suggests coercion. People can also engage in sexual acts in relationships that they aren't excited about and even that make them uncomfortable consensually to be giving to a partner who they know it means a lot to. Coercion is being convinced of something or worn down on a topic that a very firm boundary has already been placed. OP said the sexual experience made her feel uncomfortable and wasn't really her thing, but she didn't say ""I said I never wanted to do that again, but then he begged pressured and pled with me until I gave in and said I'd consider it"". Now MAYBE that's the case here, but it ultimately just sounds to me like they both shared their preferences and OP is considering engaging in an act again that isn't her favorite because of what it would mean to her partner despite not feeling like she has to"
nonmonogamy,foumj15,t1_foulw5u,1588086763.0,"I think that's a false equivalency. I think duress when used in terms of most relationship models is used more loosely than coercion in sex. I think the important thing is lots of upfront information about peoples needs and desires without using manipulation tactics. From that point, you have to give people agency to make their own choices about what they are and aren't willing to compromise on for the happiness of their partner even if it makes them slightly uncomfortable. 

If bf would like ENM but OP NEEDS monogamy, would you consider bf under monogamy under duress and compare that to a coerced sexual experience?"
nonmonogamy,foul1z4,t1_fotzg8a,1588086006.0,"I'll disagree with one thing: there are actually lots of instances where ENM starts with ""I don't want this"" but the other person states ""I need this"" and there is clear communication. I believe the term is PUDS (poly under duress) and there are many examples where it turns into a mutually beneficial relationship where the originally uncomfortable partner now has that become their preferred relationship model. 

But points I do agree with is OP's partner does sound like lacking in some self awareness or clear communication, especially in the ""that doesn't count"" example. I'm giving the partner the benefit of the doubt here as it seems like he has expressed interest but also said he's willing to go without it if OP doesn't want and since this is coming from a place of inexperience I'm giving extra slack that bf doesn't really know what his desires are rather that being explicitly manipulative through low balling. 

That being said, because he doesn't know how important this is to him I don't think his response of it not being a deal breaker for him can really be believed at this point. It's possible this will become more important to him over time, but I don't think one more sexual experience is likely to have much of an influence over his eventual stance on it being a deal breaker"
relationship_advice,fotk321,t1_fotdz12,1588056374.0,For real. I was very stressed reading this but I was even more stressed reading the top comments. If you don't communicate your boundaries you can't be upset at someone for not following them. Also there's no reason to scream at your partner. If you get to that point you should take some time to calm down and some space. And your ex either has an anxiety disorder or has been abused (potentially in this relationship) because throwing up because of panic and fear in an argument is not a typical reaction for when things get a little heated

nonmonogamy,fot5jfm,t3_g9ercc,1588045127.0,"I don't think it will scratch an itch and he won't need to do it ever again. But I think if sexual openness is something that he needs he's just as likely to end the relationship to do it again after letting him try it one more time than of you put your foot down and say no now. 

If you make an agreement that he's allowed to do it one more time and then never again and he agrees, you aren't obligated to let him do it again any more than you're obligated to let him to it now. 

At the end of the day sexual openness is either a deal breaker for him or it isnt. If you want to do something nice for him and give him the freedom to explore this again I think that would be nice and potentially mean a lot to him but ultimately I don't see either decision making a long term impact on your relationship. Just my opinion though"
AreTheStraightsOK,foqv0hp,t1_foq4ocm,1588001314.0,"I personally stand for both men's and women's issues. I think men's rights groups that are anti feminist are toxic and I think feminist groups that are anti men are toxic. 

My point was that every time (in my personal experience) I have heard someone talk about these issues they have been used as a straw man argument to discount other legitimate issues women face by someone who doesn't actually give a shit about those issues. And I think that's both awful and ends up making a lot of people discount legitimate issues men face because they begin to associate those topics as bad faith arguments even if they are legitimate problems. 

Someone on here posted a link to r/MensLib and I checked it out and was actually touched and amazed because it was the first time I'd seen a platform of men talking about legitimate issues in and not just being positioned as an attack against women and then conversation for that problem being left to die on the vine because they don't genuinely give a shit.

AreTheStraightsOK,fooy2yd,t1_foombx9,1587948907.0,"I don't think 18 is a magic number that suddenly makes people more mature about sex. Additionally you can't really make kids wait and you definitely can't force them to wait till they're emotionally mature enough which for many would probably be early 20s. However, you can control for power differentials to a certain extent and those are pretty large for even a few years difference in the late teens. A 17 year old is a high schooler while 19 is usually working or in college and might use that status as a way to impose pressure to get sexual favors the younger one may not be ready for. On the other hand I don't think it makes sense to force two kids who have been dating and respect each other's boundaries to break up because they fall on opposite ends of a magical age boundary. Age of consent is a tricky situation. Personally I think that parents shouldn't be allowed to press charges on less than 5 year age gaps without the participation of their kid, but that the statute of limitations should be extended because many kids don't know they've been taken advantage of till much later"

FondantHate,foolldz,t1_fooka8n,1587941418.0,It's fondant cheaper though? Honestly if you're using shitty ingredients and no one really likes cake that much and maybe have other desserts I don't see an issue for the tah-duh! Effect of cutting into it. The real crime is when you use fondant on a cake and then expect your guests to eat it
berkeley,foogs74,t3_g8an1k,1587938684.0,"I also had this experience. I am now on course staff for an intro course and every friend I've made that I've taken a CS upper division with has been from my fellow course staff members. I highly recommend looking into this. 

When I was taking 61A my highlight was one charming individual would always call the girl who sat next to him an idiot and tell her how bad she was at this so I turned around and to make her feel better brought up a study I read that theorized a lot of lower level STEM courses are taught from a more equation based approach which tends to be better for males while more wholeistic and theory based approaches tend to be easier for females so a lot of times it takes till later courses for things to start making sense for a lot of females because many classes were structured in a way more intuitive for men at a time when women weren't in upper level education. He responded with asking if ""you people"" care so much about equality, going on a rant about the wage gap and calling his GWS Prof a fat cow. 

I avoided talking to people I met in class from that point forward"

demisexuality,fokswb4,t1_fokrmqq,1587848319.0,"Yeah it doesn't really bother me anymore I just find it amusing at this point. Like the only thing that the label demisexual gives me is the ability to communicate my experience with others who don't understand in a more compact way, and a sense of normalcy from talking to people who identify with the same label. That's it. There's literally no other benefits. Yet people act like creating a new term for a nuanced sexuality is akin to pulling off some elaborate scam or elevates your social status in some way you haven't earned"
demisexuality,foknm6t,t1_fokn5h5,1587845452.0,Interesting. Do you know what kind of studies? Seems like if using personality psychology and the Big 5 most conservatives would score pretty low on Openness. Interested to look into what other metrics might have been used
TheRightCantMeme,fokjmt5,t1_fokjh4r,1587843293.0,That example was geared more towards females. Sometimes riding busses or wearing tight jeans and shifting in specific ways can get you physically aroused
TheRightCantMeme,fokinfc,t1_fo8v3g3,1587842770.0,"Sexual arousal: how teenage boys can experience consistent random boners, even when focused on something or someone they aren't attracted to. 

If you've ever had dreams about sex with someone you are very much not attracted to but felt sexually aroused in your dream (most people have had a dream like this with, say, a family member and then woke up feeling repulsed)

When you're on a public bus and the motion suddenly has you aroused but there's no one around you you're trying to hook up with. 

Sexual attraction: when your chemistry with a specific person (either visually or emotionally CAUSES some kind of arousal)."
TheRightCantMeme,foki0ly,t3_g60z1u,1587842434.0,"
I find it really funny people get upset about new terms like demisexuality. Languages purpose is to communicate with others concepts and personal experiences. I'm demisexual and I know a fair amount of demisexuals and literally no one I know acts like they're in any way superior by having a label. It's just a useful term to let people know how our attraction works so they understand where we are coming from. 

What's the alternative? We don't say anything and when you ask if we are attracted to you we say ""idk yet"" or you get mad at us because we're down to date you but after a month still genuinely have no idea if we want to hook up or not? The term is to give sexual people a fair expectation about what they're getting themselves into, not to knight ourselves as all mighty (a)sexual beings."
TheRightCantMeme,fokhujf,t1_fo7t142,1587842345.0,"I'm a demisexual and yes. I had a huge crush on Harry Potter (from the book, not Daniel Radcliffe) as a kid and often times developed sexual attraction for book characters but never, say, a model"
demisexuality,fokh33b,t1_foe37uk,1587841941.0,Honestly I'd have so much casual sex if I wasn't demi. I have an incredibly high sex drive but am frequently not attracted to anyone I know and it's really frustrating. Like I want to have sex with SOMEONE but I'm not attracted to a single person I know.
nonmonogamy,foj0zab,t3_g7l6ox,1587804079.0,"So personally (female here) I am a need to know person. My boyfriend can do whatever with whoever (we basically only have rules about sexual safety and honesty) but I want to know EVERYTHING. I like know exactly what happened, who said what, every single detail. I also like to tell him everything with what happens with me and other partners but he doesn't care to hear as many of the gory details as I want to. I personally don't think there's anything wrong with that. I think different people feel comfortable with different things. Some people want DNDT, others want to tell each other every single little detail. I happen to be the latter. 🤷 my mind can make things up to be way worse than what reality could ever be, plus I like to feel included. 

I think you should tell your wife that's important to you and allow her to be transparent with her other partner that you like to know so he is aware of what she may or may not be sharing and see what she says. There's nothing wrong with wanting to know more"
relationships,foj0fcz,t1_foizxak,1587803481.0,I agree it's probably been on his mind but I think trapping someone in marriage with the intention of having them change their mind is very different and way more manipulative than thinking you'll be okay without something and realizing it's a deal breaker later on. And nothing in OPs post leads me to belief he was holding on to the believe she'd change her mind. But I definitely know a lot of people do approach relationships that way
relationships,foj05nr,t3_g7mqs9,1587803193.0,"I have cut off most members of my family (I won't go into details but it's definitely justified).

I've noticed certain aspects of my life are a lot easier than those of my peers with bad parental relationships and some are easier. 

The easier things are that I get to fully carve my own path in life. I have complete independence and am able to surround myself with friends who I wholeheartedly love and shape my life based off of those who completely accept me for who I am without worrying about conflict or disappointment. 

The hard part is you're losing people who know a piece of you no one else does. Your parents are often the only ones who saw your personality as a child, all the way in which you developed, and have a certain knowledge and investment in you that can't be replaced. 

The biggest thing it's you need to be in control of you adult life. You should be financially independent. You need to be able to use your time as leverage against your parents for respecting you and your boundaries. You need to think of what those are and inform your parents what they need to do to show you respect and if they don't listen then avoid them for a while. You should be prepared to cut them off completely if you need to but hopefully they'll learn that acting badly will lead to them losing you and change their behaviors"
relationships,foiz6l0,t1_foiz3in,1587802149.0,I'm just going based on the post. I would assume that if OP had felt any kind of consistent pressure about the topic that would have been included in the post considering how uncomfortable it made her
relationships,foiyt7b,t1_foire5l,1587801760.0,"Relationships are about compromising for the other person's feelings. If you reach an impasse where neither person is willing to compromise you should break up. It seems to me OPs partner realized he's not willing to compromise anymore and is telling OP he wants to break up (rather than trying to force her into doing it). She can choose if that's a deal breaker for her as well, but if it's something she's just uncomfortable with but not necessarily a deal breaker there's no shame in her trying it and seeing if it's workable since it's obviously so important to him"
relationships,foiycek,t1_foiw6xp,1587801271.0,"I think that hoping someone will change their mind later is common in relationships, but considering it sounds like he dropped it completely until he brought it up last weekend (presumably a while since they got married) it doesn't seem like thats the case in this instance. Usually there's more consistent pressure when you know thats what you what but are hoping for a change of heart rather than dropping an ultimatum seemingly out of the blue"
nonmonogamy,fodor0a,t3_g6uzqh,1587687304.0,"It sounds like the biggest issue here is communication. It sounds like your husband is trying to protect his own feelings and insecurities from being triggered by limiting what you do and don't discuss with him about your mate and it's causing a lot of issues and disconnection between you two. I think it would be good to talk to your husband about how you're feeling about HIM and how you need more communication to feel close to him again. 

I think you two could find some kind of compromise where you're able to share more of your thoughts and interests with him without having to censor yourself so entirely you feel disconnected, but not to go into so much detail that it upsets him to know how much this other guy fulfills your sexual needs. 

The fact that it doesn't seem like either one of you are aware of the areas of degrees to which the other is unsatisfied in the relationship is a big issue and figuring that out would give you two the tools to know if you can work on rebuilding or if you should call it quits"

There are unfortunately a lot of guys I think who still believe that women don't really enjoy sex in the same way that men do and kind of just do it for them. Additionally, the ones that do think women can enjoy sex often believe that all it takes to be ""good"" in bed with a woman is having a big dick and being able to hammer away for a long time.

TrueOffMyChest,fo9tfxy,t3_g6ct0i,1587630548.0,"My thing with the whole pronouns thing is that transgender people should keep in mind that it's a big linguistic shift for a lot of people and to be generous with mistakes. As for the other side, you don't actually need to believe in more than two genders to just be kind and try to put in the effort for something that's important to someone else and literally costs you nothing except maybe a little more mental effort. When you meet someone and they say ""call me Matt"" you'd seem like an ass to be like ""fuck you, I don't like that name. You look like a Steve to me so I'll call you Steve"".
