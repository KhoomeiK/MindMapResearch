AMA,fpmu4ia,t3_geaqvb,1588741786.0,"Oof, I definitely know the struggle of becoming an atheist in a religious home. Do you feel as if you need any support or help in looking for resources? It's not my intent to make you lean towards a religious belief, but there are a lot of great resources online that can help the whole process feel less daunting. Either way, hopefully covid-19 hasn't made life too rough on your end!"

UCSD,fp0rmtv,t1_fp0ojb9,1588215394.0,"I honestly didn't expect you to read the paragraph. I figured we were done here. You've been acting like a child for an entire day, and one would figure that you would've just moved on by now. First off, serological testing is the basis upon which you construct and effective reopening plan. That's the end all be all. There's no way to get around partially reopening some things, as the economy can't sustain a permanent lockdown. However, you seem to have a great deal of trouble with the precautionary principle. When it comes to a pandemic where circa 2,000 people are dying per day in the United States, one should hope that officials are more cautious than not. Thus, if you hope to implement an aggressive reopening strategy, the burden of proof is squarely on you. Also, it's not that hard to get some comprehensive serological testing done. 
As for your subsequent statement, I'm almost without words. You do realize that a flattening curve is caused by non-pharmaceutical interventions, right? Cases stop growing exponentially on account of two factors: non-pharmaceutical interventions, and a population attaining herd immunity. Herd immunity is attained at circa 80%. A flattening of the curve doesn't just occur. You bring about a flattening of the curve. Also, I never disputed that we should ensure that our hospitals are better prepared, nor the idea that we should continue wearing masks. All of that has to happen for quite some time. As for the rest of your paragraph, nice job downplaying my lived experience. You do realize that I have to eat too, right? I'm saying this as someone who's income is seriously threatened. I'm living with my parents, and I make a little bit of income on the side, but absent her small business income, we're not eating. I'm trying to tell you that I'm seeing it first hand. I'm well aware of the economic devastation. You can't just sacrifice people to the markets though. By the way, you CAN assist laborers during a time like this. WE HAVE CHOSEN NOT TO. Denmark, Canada, the United Kingdom, and New Zealand are all excellent examples of locales that have taken it in to their own hands to ensure that all of their people are getting 80% of their paycheck. Nowhere in your diatribe did you advocate for that. Funny how you care about the economy until it stops being convenient to your argument. As for the economy at large, please read me the sentence where I said: ""We're never going to reopen again."" I'm well aware that cash flow is important, but human lives are also important. This weird bait and switch you're playing on economic issues really doesn't match up with your position on a lot of other issues. 
As for your next point- I don't claim I have a pre-existing condition, I do have one. If you want medical documents, I'll send you the damn medical documents via DM. Either way, I care because the spread of infectious diseases directly affects everyone. I make some money for my family too. Remember that portion of a previous argument where you talked about privilege? Privilege is stating ""so, you're in danger, but your not me, so it's all good if every waking moment is horror, and you can't see your friends for years. Couldn't be me."" As for the serology test angle, I'm not entirely sure why you're so committed to dismissing it, but I agree with many of the other points you made there. I also stated that you claimed to be in favor of a South Korea style approach, and that conflicted with your statement. Not once have you advocated for universal healthcare, rigorous contact tracing, reducing corporate giveaways, and many of the other integral components of the South Korean response that have made it so successful.
Also, just when you were starting to sound more reasonable, you took it back to the car crash argument. You'd be a hell of a lot more convincing if you didn't stick with every bad point you make throughout the course of an argument. It's like you're trying to come off as unreliable. WE HAVE A RIGOROUS SYSTEM OF RULES AND REGULATIONS FOR DRIVING. DEAR GOD, HAVE YOU EVER SEEN A ROAD? I can't explain this to you if you're going to keep acting like a toddler. We already do our best to minimize fatalities from driving by way of the rules of the road, requiring licenses, increasingly complex technology in cars, police forces to enforce the rules or the road, dividers in roads to prevent cars from drifting off, and so forth. If we take precautions that extreme for reopening: that is, massively increasing the scope of testing, national mask-wearing guidelines, maintaining a distance of 2 meters between people, and keeping dine-in portions of restaurants closed, I'm all for gradually getting on that. Again, get off of the high horse. You're not winning any hearts or minds by being outright arrogant. I should imagine we're done here, as I wasn't even expecting this response. If you cared half as much about any of the issues you claim to care about, you'd be damn close to being right on most of them."
UCSD,fozosok,t1_foze33j,1588194250.0,"Yeah, unsurprisingly I've written a formal essay or two in my days. You're not my professor, and I don't know you, so I didn't care to format it. I didn't figure it would be a huge problem, but since you've decided that you are in fact the unquestioned ruler of Reddit, I'd be happy to tailor my responses to your fancy. 
Firstly, I'm not sure why you elected to truncate the quote. It wouldn't have taken that much effort to just type it out in its entirety. I contended that we needed an externally and internally invalid serological experiment to make determinations about policy in an informed manner. You just pushed ahead stating that It's likely that a lot more people have contracted SARS NCOV2. That's cool, and I agree, but we don't make policy on your hunches. Your hunches don't tell us the direction, or the magnitude that our public policy should take. That's what we utilized data for. Also, keep in mind that it wouldn't take all that long to run an externally and internally valid serological test. In the meantime, we can start opening up carefully whilst continuing to utilize non-pharmaceutical interventions like masks. 
You also end your comment by stating that you won't even look over the remainder of my reply because I misrepresented one of your positions. Your entire argument was built on Strawman arguments about my thoughts on economic policy when I had made no statements on it whatsoever, arguing that car crashes are somehow an argument against rigorous implementation of non-pharmaceutical interventions, and utterly ignoring the privilege inherent in your own statement whilst going out of your way to lambaste me. I did the courtesy of reading and replying to all of your arguments. If I'm wrong, you can either demonstrate why, or you can stay on your high horse. Either way, you've gotten way too upset about this. Have a nice day, and continue social distancing- somebody's life likely depends on it."
UCSD,foz900i,t1_foz4t19,1588186686.0,"You didn't list an exact number. You stated that it was insignificant that we lacked an internally and externally valid serology experiment. I disagreed for precisely that reason. It's important to understand precisely how effective non-pharmaceutical interventions are in limiting the transmissibility of a disease, and a way to go about doing that is to determine the IFR and CFR. Also, did you want an article linked? At literally no point in your reply did you ask for a source. By the way, the burden of proof is on the claimant. I don't have to prove that there won't be a significant improvement; you have to prove that there will be one. You don't get to waltz into a discussion and wait for everything you say to be proven wrong. Also, I don't disagree that modeling is important. There is not one model on earth that says ""IT'S SLIGHTLY HOTTER OUTSIDE, BETTER LET THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE CONTRACT A NOVEL VIRUS."" As for your point about driving, I absolutely detest this point. Driving is not a communicable disease. Driving fatalities can't be prevented by something as simple as wearing a mask. This is the pinnacle of all false equivalencies. Look at expected deaths juxtaposed to total deaths across all major population centers in the world. New York is thousands of deaths above expected (and yes, PEOPLE ARE TYPICALLY DRIVING). Also, how the hell would you go about deciphering that a motorists odds of getting in a fatal car crash are .17%? There are a ton of moving parts that are operating there. Either way, we have rules of the road, we have safe-driving technology in cars that alerts people when they're swerving or approaching another car too closely, and we make people undertake an examination process to get a driver's license. SO WE ALREADY DO TAKE MASSIVE PRECAUTIONS TO STOP CAR CRASH FATALITIES. What's the next argument? People didn't stop having sex during the AIDS crisis, therefore, who cares that 60,000 people are dead? This is some ironclad logic. Also, I never said there weren't immense problems with the economic dimension of the United States' response to SARS NCOV-2. You're conflating my argument that we shouldn't stop social distancing with support for the disastrous federal policy we've enacted. The Federal Reserve has pumped out an ungodly $8.3 Trillion in liquidity, and people are getting pennies to survive on. However, not every country is this massively corrupt and malicious in their response. In Canada, 80% of every worker's salary is being paid. In the United States, we pay United Airlines $25 billion to lay off the majority of its workers. I'm in support of good science, not bad economics. Wanting people to stay at home is a privileged position if you don't weight the economic aspect of the situation. You never said word one about that in your prior response. It really sounds as if you only started to care about underprivileged people as you were typing that comment. Also, my mother runs a small business. I'm not for castrating the small business economy. I'm for a reasoned return with massive cash injections for small businesses and workers so that mass testing can be administered. I have a pre-existing condition, and I'm not really willing to die to suit you whims. Sorry if that perturbs you. Also, nothing you typed above leads me to believe that you're at all interested in massive quantities of tests being administered in conjunction with rigorous contact tracing and national mask-wearing. That said, if you do truly want to emulate South Korea, perhaps you should have looked at the other dimension of privilege in this circumstance. SOUTH KOREA HAS UNIVERSAL HEALTHCARE. You're out here talking about taking risky measures in a population where 30 million, and the number is growing by the way, people lack health insurance. They might be turned aside, or wind up in medical debt for the rest of their life. Seeking adequate medical care is a privilege in the United States. I'm $2100 in debt due to prior medical expenses. Not all of us can waltz in to a hospital and expect to come out okay, whether that be a health outcome, or financially. I also never stated that I wanted to remain on complete lockdown. Models I like thus far include South Korea, Denmark, and the Czech Republic. All of those nations have eliminated added dimensions of socioeconomic strife via providing universal healthcare and adjacent economic relief. Denmark is perhaps the most impressive. So, in conclusion, stop setting up strawman arguments to knock them down. Also, your last point on the potential of the virus to mutate is a decent point. That doesn't mean we shouldn't try to stop the spread, after all, the more it proliferates, the more likely we'll see significant spread of a mutated strain. You're so dedicated to being a contrarian here, but you spent 90% of that paragraph agreeing with the original post, then took some detours to misrepresent my position on economic issues, and make a solid contender for worst argument of the epidemic utilizing car accidents. Get off the high horse, and just engage in rational dialogue. It'll do you a lot of good."
UCSD,foyw6ua,t1_foyryb1,1588180311.0,"UC Berkeley is certainly more likely to start their term online, but I think you're vastly underestimating covid-19. First of all, the lack of a comprehensive serology test is A GIGANTIC ISSUE. There are talking heads running around screaming 4%, 12%, 30% of the population has had the virus based on non-randomized samples, often from people who have come to testing centers with obvious symptoms. So that's precisely the problem, until we know what percentage of the population has had it-, by way of taking a large, representative and generalizable sample, we can't say anything. It's unscientific to say, ""Well, it sure spreads quickly, so thereby I'm going to assume that 4% of the population has had it and throw the precautionary principle to the wind, and just reopen everything. Sorry everyone who dies!"" That's unscientific, and it could result in multitudes of avoidable deaths. Also, you apparently didn't figure out that transmission rates are altered by non-pharmaceutical interventions, such as social distancing, mass wearing of masks, and temporary closures of some non-essential businesses. The entire idea of flattening the curve is to reduce the transmissibility of the disease in the short term so as to avoid overburdening the hospital system. The only thing you're really correct on here is that many more of us than we know have had it. However, is that number 3 million? Is it 10 million? Is it 2 million? You have no idea, and neither does anybody else. Either way, well in your excess of 2,000 people died yesterday. If you think this is even remotely close to over; you're delusional. That is of course compounded by the fact that we don't know what lasting health effects can stem from severe, or even mild cases. Young people have been having covid-induced strokes, enlarged heart has been found in some patients, ARDS is common in severe cases, and renal damage has been observed. We're working with a new disease here. I don't believe that a top research university that wants to retain that label is going to abandon the precautionary principle because it's more convenient in the short term."
UCSD,foxt55l,t3_ga5c63,1588155389.0,"It's an excellent review, and I love how they called out the immense flaws in the Stanford serology test. They should have also mentioned the fact that a venture capitalist associated with the study published an article in the Wall Street Journal without disclosing his role, and pretended that the study authoritatively showed that covid-19 had a low infection fatality rate. That said, they did a great job critiquing the massive internal and external validity problems with that study, and it's a reasonable take overall. Hopefully university administrators make some efforts to listen to people with takes such as this one."
Political_Revolution,fop534w,t1_fop4rsv,1587953263.0,"I'm well aware that he runs a delivery business. Several other billionaires, like the Waltons, run essential businesses like stores. Instead of utilizing the excess income they receive from growing demand to mayhaps protect workers, provide hazard pay, or help struggling local businesses, they all just keep the money. Jeff Bezos bought a multi-million dollar apartment, and he can't even be bothered to make sure working conditions are so basically tolerable that his workers aren't at enhanced risk for covid-19. Meanwhile, they're doing their best to make businesses die so they can steal their niche and make more money when the pandemic ends. The rich get richer every time there's an economic downturn, and the poor get poorer."
Political_Revolution,fop3c6e,t1_fooon3c,1587952162.0,"I'm not sure where you got ""the market is doing well"" from ""Billionaires have profited massively"". Let's look at Jeff Bezos, who's wealth is primarily in stocks in assets. You can literally track this. According to Fortune, he gained $24 billion from the beginning of the pandemic to April 16th. His wealth sat at $138.5 billion as of the publication of that article. He know has a total wealth of $145 billion. Billionaires are effectively immune to global catastrophes. Even if they lost money, they would gain it all back. However, most of them have just continued to profit, and have donated almost nothing. Moreover, Jeff Bezos purchased a multi-million dollar apartment just this month."
UCSD,fny68lu,t3_g4kkdc,1587354419.0,"So, firstly, you do select roommates, but it takes place over the summer. Secondly; I'd recommend checking out UCSD class of 2024 pages on Instagram and Facebook. They're a good way to meet people before the year begins, and you might be able to build some social networks before even stepping foot on campus. I found both of my roommates through the class of 2023 page, and everything went swimmingly for the quarters in which we all lived on campus. I'd highly recommend finding your roommates ahead of time. That said, you can also opt for random selection if you're not interested in frequenting pages on Instagram or Facebook.
