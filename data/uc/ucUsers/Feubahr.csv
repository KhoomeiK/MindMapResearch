It's funny how people are so loud in standing for their ""rights"" when they don't even know what those rights are."
Cigarettes,fpkwo4s,t1_fpjlt14,1588702331.0,"I'm sure you can see how your initial comment has none of the nuance of your last comment -- in fact, the comments are quite contradictory. You can see where you give off a certain impression that,, upon reflection, you didn't want to give.

""1% of the worst cases"" is a far cry from ""straight up unbelievable."" 90% of people who get oral cancer are smokers, although it's fair to say that alcohol use probably plays a significant role as well because alcohol disrupts cellular membranes, making the oral cavity more permeable to substances in smoke. The shit in that picture may be the worst example, but would you want even a little of it?

Anyways, the point isn't to lecture you about what happens with smokers. I hope you understand that I'm not trying to condescend here. I'm just reminding you that you don't know everything... but you knew that."

Cigarettes,fpiy2qq,t1_fpg6y7k,1588651479.0,"Do you suppose that it's impossible for oral cancers to become this bad, or is it a matter of the shitty healthcare system and widespread poverty in India and other Third World nations that allow cancer to progress to this point? Plus, this guy probably smoked bidis, the ingredients of which probably vary from day to day. Any time your cigarette comes wrapped in a leaf of unknown provenance,  tied off with a piece of string, you have to question its origins.

Also, it's important to remember that just because you haven't seen it doesn't mean it doesn't exist -- you're only one person, and I'm betting that you aren't an oncologist. Some of the shit you see in their textbooks will make your eyes water.

You need to think critically about things -- don't just rush to feel good about ""being right."""
berkeley,fpifoj2,t3_gdjaee,1588639946.0,"You know, you're actually allowed to leave your floor and make friends with people who live on co-ed floors, right? Most people socialize within the building, as opposed to within their own floor, so unless you land in Stern, I doubt your experience will be much different whether you're in a single sex or co-ed situation."
berkeley,fpif065,t1_fpi4sbz,1588639552.0,"Random violence is (perceived as) a bigger deal because of its unpredictability. It's upsetting to people's sense of security when there's little to no personal agency involved in avoiding sudden, unforeseen events. 3000+ people died during the 9/11 attacks.

That same year, 42000+ people died in vehicular accidents, and everyone just shrugs. People's brains are wired to suck at understanding statistics and risk. After 9/11, people stopped flying due to fear of terrorism and shifted to long drives, resulting in 1600 more deaths beyond the normal toll -- that's something like six years worth of air deaths (worldwide).

There's also a matter of certain people having extreme perceptions of risk that have little to no basis in fact. Most people don't assess risk that well, but some people are wired to be a lot worse at it. They literally perceive risks differently from most people. See u/catulio in this thread or low information types who harass the parents of children who died in school shootings because some shit talker on the radio told them the shooting was faked."
AskReddit,fpicuwl,t1_fpg8eq6,1588638299.0,Your comment seems to suggest that cheerleading is a sport -- it is most decidedly *not* a sport according to the US 2nd District Court of Appeals. Any female student participating in cheer does not offset Title IX requirements. The decision was made in 2012.
shittyfoodporn,fpdcgni,t3_gcr5vp,1588524263.0,"I think you might be off by a couple of decades. Gelatin based foods were first popular in the 1950s in the US as a way of showing off your new refrigerator -- prior to WWII those appliances were not common in most households.

I have no doubt that there were still people who ate aspics in the 1970s (unless you're French, since you're probably still eating them), but I wouldn't characterize a terrine as a food of the 1970s."
berkeley,foauqnf,t1_fo902nz,1587652806.0,"I know what you've posted, and that's enough. You make excuses for criminals and criminality, and when you have no rational argument, you resort to argumentum ad hominem -- that says plenty about you.

You're also fond of throwing up strawmen when you're clearly losing the argument. India has nothing to do with engaging in slavery, pimping, and murder on US soil. Or are you suggesting that we buy the argument that keeping low caste people as slaves is OK in the US because it's OK in India, which was your boy Reddy's argument in the first place? And you accuse me of trying to be ""politically correct?"" I suggest you look up the meaning of the term because you clearly have no clue.

You're an astroturfing shill. You should just shut your piehole now and leave it shut because you have nothing to contribute except lies.... but I'm sure you won't be able to resist the temptation to reply anyhow because Reddit is likely the only form of human contact you have in your life, and without picking fights with strangers, you would get no attention at all."
berkeley,fo8zng6,t1_fo7y7c0,1587607254.0,"How about I suffocate one of your family members after using them as a slave for years, and then I hide out for 20 years. You should forgive me then, shouldn't you? After all it would be 20 year old news by then, wouldn't it?

You show up on every thread mentioning Reddy, Raj or Everest and make not one, but multiple defenses of a criminal and companies built on his criminality. It's hard to believe that any unconnected person, even a ten year tenant, would expend so much effort without having a dog in the fight.

Methinks the u/tlpgigo doth protest *too* much.

TLDR: You're full of shit."
OutOfTheLoop,fnunx9h,t1_fntgwis,1587266648.0,"Even if they're not friends or family, people are only people. [Dunbar's number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunbar%27s_number) describes a rough limit to the number of people with which one can maintain a social tie.

People living in shelters have no homes. They're homeless.

People living in vehicles have no homes. They're homeless.

People couch surfing have no homes. They're homeless.

If someone has a trailer in a trailer park, they're housed, so why would they need some other option for living?
