WayOfTheBern,fnnof3h,t1_fnniei9,1587097287.0,"The main fly in your argument is something which drives Republicans - the federal judiciary. Four more years of incompetent far right judges being rammed through, and there really won’t be any scope for any progressive policies being instituted for many decades, anything done will just be struck down by the judiciary’s interpretation of the constitution. It’s extremely unlikely RBG will hold on for 4 more years either.

Is Biden gonna be a someone who plays it too safe, yeah that’s quite likely. Bernie or Warren would definitely get more done. But at the very least I should think he’ll surround himself with competent people and not sycophants, and we can expect some progress for the entire country rather than just the ultra rich.

I really don’t understand this distaste some people have for not voting for the lesser of two perceived evils. Is this system flawed? Sure. But then again, there is nothing in the short term which can be done to correct this. Any fixes would have to be institutional and done over time ( reducing influence of money in politics, making re-districting non partisan so the voice of the majority can actually be heard, etc ). The thought of four more years of trump terrifies me, he’ll simplify act with even more impunity as he’ll have nothing to lose, and simply pardon himself on the way out.
Overall, I feel some pragmatism is required in this situation. It’s a sucky situation for sure, though."

Don’t get me wrong, I fully support enforcement of current immigration laws, and don’t personally understand the reasoning behind sanctuary cities (though I guess ICE could stand to be less shady and drastic in their actions). For all intents and purposes the entire west coast is overwhelmingly blue regardless, and even if illegal immigrants do get naturalized through proper channels eventually I doubt it’ll affect matters much. Overall you see the demographics (age, etc) just tilting more towards Democrats as time passes. I would argue that the Republican Party is simply going out of touch with the general population in terms of policies, especially with the priorities of the younger generations."
