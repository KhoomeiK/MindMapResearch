technology,fnilitm,t3_g1q1bz,1586982081.0,"The real problem is although the older generations of Chinese citizens are strongly affected by the historical feudal propaganda, the younger ones are not. They know there’s a firewall so they will try hard to see what’s outside by all means, they have learned what’s really happening in other countries, thus, connect with the world. However, it’s countries leading by the States, whose citizens believe they have total freedom and access to all information, will disconnect with the world because they are too arrogant to actually look deep into events and believe there’s no reason to look inside the Chinese firewall, you can’t make an argument if you don’t even have the objective facts of what you are arguing against. The young generation of Chinese are cautious, skeptical, seeking informations to be objective and willing to change and improve, while the citizens (majority not all) of the “free countries” are too comfortable to be."
