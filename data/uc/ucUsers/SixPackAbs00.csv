ucla,fmxl9jy,t1_fmxktqa,1586467103.0,"$15 in quarterly fees just adds to the already burdensome USAC fees, which amount to over $200 per year. Just because they‚Äôre introduced piecemeal, doesn‚Äôt discount that overall it adds to an already large fee. It may be ‚Äúonly $15.33‚Äù now, but the overall amount is just going to keep growing with more of these ‚Äúsmall new fees.‚Äù

edit: Wow, I though it was a $15 annually. But it's actually $15 quarterly! That's 45$ per year. Get fucked USAC!"
