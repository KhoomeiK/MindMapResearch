Anybody can find a home here- I'm pretty introverted myself and I've discovered friend groups and clubs that are like family to me.  UCLA is not as competitive as you hear.  In general people are very collaborative, even in engineering (maybe not premed lol).  Anywhere you go will be an adjustment: UCSD or UCLA.  But you will feel right at home after a quarter or two.

I don't really know about the name difference and I don't think its relevant, but UCLA is better than SD in so many ways other than academics that I think it's the best choice.

The atmosphere at UCLA will make you into a better person: more organized, more sociable, and more focused.  I don't want to bash UCSD too hard, but from what I've heard it really is socially dead."

ucla,fp35h0x,t1_fp125py,1588273422.0,"I'm a bit more optimistic.  Given how much effort and money is being put into getting a vaccine ASAP, I think it's very possible we get a vaccine within a year.  Obviously it would take some time to ramp up to a level where everyone can be inoculated.  I have no doubts that things will return to normal by summer-fall 2021."
ucla,fowx6v3,t3_ga0j8c,1588129090.0,"As painful as this is to write, I think the writing's on the wall: fall quarter, and likely the entire academic year, may be entirely online.  If there's a second wave in the fall as most health officials predict, how will universities be able to open up for winter?  Things won't magically improve in December.

If the pandemic keeps trending in this direction, I may seriously consider taking the year off.  It's really hard to justify paying UC tuition for an online experience.

I really hope I'm wrong..."

Found it on the math department website

I don't know what class this is for, but I had him for 32B and he was great!"
