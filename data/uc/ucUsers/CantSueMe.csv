berkeley,fp9hd5j,t1_fp9ebya,1588426231.0,"CS61A/B is usually in Wheeler 150, with labs and discussions in Soda. EE16A/B also usually has lecture in Wheeler 150, with labs and discussions in Soda (Edit: 16AB labs are in Cory, not Soda). I think 7A/B takes place in LeConte. Math 53 depends on the class, but there usually is at least one class in Dwinelle. Perhaps it might also be in Stanley, or Pimmentel.

I've seen UGBA 10 taken in Wheeler 150 all my time here. Econ 1/2, I think, is the same as Math 53 (it could be in any large lecture hall on campus), same for Stat 20."
berkeley,fp8h0eb,t3_gbxozx,1588392071.0,"This is a little bit of a rant.

I think we live in a society where most people see coding and maybe oil (up until recently) as the only two viably growing technological sectors. That's why there's all this talk about finding replacement jobs for coal miners, the Green New Deal, learn to code, etc. Oil had new and profitable technologies in fracking and coding has new, profitable technologies, in, well, coding. 

In such a scenario, the downsides to cheating may be plentiful (expulsion, etc.), but to do poorly in CS is even worse. That would mean having to study something else. Perhaps even going into other engineering fields... And with the wonderful state of infrastructure in our city, our state, our country it baffles me as to why people crowd into CS and won't go do other STEM fields (/s). This crowding makes the major then hyper-competitive. And if you don't compete, you lose. And you lose bigly. You lose the 30k to 50k to 60k a year that people drop here. People lose some of their most vibrant years.

To go to university and major in CS and not cheat is to throw away the advantage of youth AND the opportunity of a cushy upper-middle class lifestyle that might substitute for youth. For now, the degree has the appearance of being enough to signify that one is capable enough to do well. At some point, though, the underlying value of the education will be decoupled from its derivative product (the degree). But, that's not the problem of the people who cheat. As long as the environment they graduate in favors college grads, they won't have to care. It's a problem for the university and its prestige, which is why I think instructors make threats on Piazza and try to get people to confess.

CS is the only major where the expected returns seem high enough to justify paying 30k-50k-60k+ a year. Factor in the (low) probability of getting caught, and a simple expected value model says the best option is to cheat."

berkeley,fp0vbsx,t3_gafgd6,1588217744.0,"There's a weird pacing switch after a ""Joe Goldberg"" joke that kind of threw me off. Also that joke went way over my head because idk whotf Joe Goldberg is. Your other jokes aren't very good either, sorry. Your jokes have the ""badum-badum-badum-badum-....- yeah..."" cadence of a Casually Explained joke, but your punchlines come off as ranty, rather than as some amusing, chuckle-inducing, self-deprecating joke. The ""so stupid"" remark at being written up for something dumb was kind of good though. Hope you keep working at this thing if comedy is what you're going for."

berkeley,forh2ip,t1_forgfog,1588012111.0,"I'm not 100% sure, since I'm not COE, but I think the only deadline to take classes by is the R&C A/B Literature series, which must be taken by the end of sophomore year. I took the EE16 series as a Junior anyway. I've heard some people delay taking 61C for a while as well."
berkeley,forg645,t3_g95hyz,1588011674.0,"I'm not EECS, but from the perspective of a middle-of-the-pack L&S CS student, I would personally recommend it. Taking three classes a semester is a yuuge load off my back compared to four. I feel like I actually have time to look into the material that I'm interested in. For the classes I'm not interested in, there's so much down time that I feel like I might as well do it if I have this much free time on my hands. When I was taking four classes a semester I was just grinding through and it was not enjoyable. Depends on why you're going to university though; you might want to get it done with quickly and get into the workforce or something. One change I would make would be to front load humanities classes into freshman/sophomore year and take EE16A/B later, since context switching between technicals and humanities courses heavily drains my motivation."

berkeley,fnfcfvd,t1_fnf42r6,1586905433.0,"That's the official prereq, but I also recommend having some experience with proofs. I highly recommend Math 55 to have some exposure to binary relations and partial/total orderings. CS 70 might be useful since it teaches stable marriage, which is taught with slight modifications in the middle part of the class. Otherwise, a general background in proof-based math is useful. In my experience, 53/54 were not proof-based classes."

berkeley,fmwfb3o,t3_fxtd3p,1586445552.0,"He’s fine, imo. Nothing too notable, either positive or negative. He mostly lectures out of the books and tells you the relevant parts in case you miss something.

Grading is what you might expect out of an EECS class: small percentage homework, small percent lab, big part exam. Homeworks take a lot of time and labs introduce interesting applications. Exams are tough, but it’s curved."
