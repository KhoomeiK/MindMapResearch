The physician/patient thing makes no sense cus... What's the correlation? All sorts of people have medical problems, including millionaires, poor folks, average ppl, and those aforementioned CEOs and their pays all depend on the region as well. So it makes no sense to calculate the average pay of patients. The patients also have nothing to do with the doctors' pay unless he gets paid based on the number of patients he sees, but even then it's the headcount that matters not anything the patient actually does which is just sit there and get treated.
