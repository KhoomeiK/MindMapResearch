FragileWhiteRedditor,fpmx747,t1_fpkeqbp,1588744092.0,"I was an NCAA athlete at the DIII level, we didn't get exclusive dining halls or a discount, but we did get priority enrollment. I feel I have to defend student athletes for a second.

Almost all the other student athletes I know regardless of school or division are enrolled in a serious major. Maybe at huge D1 basketball and football schools, some of them major in pointless fields, but for most of us sports is secondary to academics and serves as a way to help ends meet. 99.9% of student athletes get normal jobs when they graduate. I know a number that would otherwise be stuck in their hometown or in community college. This opportunity for all of us came at the cost of thousands of hours of practice and training. 

Exclusive dining halls are pretty simple, you exercise that much and you need to eat more. Not all student athletes can afford the extra cost of the food they need to keep pushing themselves.

 Priority enrollment is designed for us to plan out our schedule to avert conflicts with our 20 hours a week practices. It sounds like an entitlement until you hear about the other groups that also have this, students on low income scholarships, and international students from countries with a ""complicated"" relationship to the US. The thing all three of these have in common is that if they don't get out in four years, they'll probably never finish their degree. Do other people deserve this? Maybe, but that's another discussion.

I realize that you and I no doubt have different views regarding the value of sports. That aside, I hope we can come to an understanding and realize that student athletes don't get free stuff just because. They have to endure countless additional challenges to earn any privilege given to them, almost all of which are given to them with the intent of reducing the load they endure down to that of a standard student. If the value we brought to the university didn't match the cost, NCAA would have been disbanded decades ago"
California,fp3acqm,t3_gaz26g,1588275855.0,"Seeing this response makes me think of John Steinbeck's words, ""these are results, not causes"". The state is clearly tired of sheltering in place and it's starting to leak out in more ways than one. Gavin Newsom needs to start thinking of other strategies to get people to stop infecting each other. Telling everyone to stay home and wait for a miracle isn't going to work much longer.

I think an easy way to help would be to publish concrete numerical goals at which we can start to change our behavior. For example, peoples would be much more patient if the state said ""you may gather in small groups again when positive test rates in a particular region fall below 0.5% for 10 continuous days""."
bayarea,fouk95v,t1_fotnemz,1588085603.0,"That's because for University administration, this is a dream come true. They're getting paid and they can claim education is still occuring, but they don't have to deal with any of the usual challenges of running a university. That's why they need a hard deadline to reopen. They'd close down for 5 years ""just to be safe"" if they thought they could get away with it"
bayarea,fotik73,t3_g96ocj,1588055008.0,"After reading the article and seeing what everyone else here is saying, here's my armchair plan to open society back up.

1) Schools and Universities remain closed for one additional month with a hard deadline to reopen  with a plan to control and monitor any cases remaining

2) Nursing homes and hospitals continue current behavior

3) Business is allowed to reopen under the following conditions. The business must provide all employees ppe to protect themselves from infection, all employees are offered one month of paid sick leave if they feel unsafe or at risk, the county health department must inspect the facility and certify that ppe meets criteria, the business owner or chief of operations must certify that safe practices remain until the crisis ends or face criminally liability

4) Any non essential business that can't satisfy these criteria remains closed

5) Shelter in place is reduced from an order to a recommendation for the general population

6) Concerts, sporting events, and other large gatherings of strangers are cancelled until the end of May, after which they may only take place if the organizers create a safety plan which the county health department certifies"
UCSC,fotfrkl,t3_g9ejbm,1588052639.0,"Nah, among the engineerings at UCSC, CS is easily the path of least resistance. EE I think has the hardest classes on average as well as the most professors who want to watch you fail, RE is split between classes that are so easy you think you're doing it wrong, and classes that take 70 hours a week minimum. CE probably has to deal with the most bullshit in terms of unfair grading and ""figure it out yourself"" professors. BE and it's variants have the worst of both worlds between Bio and the Engineering"
MURICA,fogmjti,t1_fog51gt,1587754483.0,"I mean, this was a surprise to absolutely nobody who knew much about BSA politics. Venture Crews and Sea Scouts have recognized been co-ed crews for years, and historically they've been just progressive enough to keep the legacy troops in big cities from folding (have a look at their history with homosexual scouts for instance). When forced to choose between them and religious conservative troops, they've almost always chosen the former.

Meanwhile the Girl Scouts are still struggling with the concept of Dads wanting to be involved in their daughter's experience.

Personally as an Eagle Scout myself, I support them letting the local counsels making the choice of how best to serve their community and not lose relevance."

UCSC,fnpp2a5,t3_g33x8w,1587149402.0,"I think that UC is going to have no choice but to go offline for fall classes. Someone who has access to the UC cash flow could confirm this, but at some point, their budget is going to force their hand. If they go online, the number of people who decide to take a year off, take a gap year, or decide to drop out is going to increase. Some people do this every year, but if even 1-2% more of students do this it would be catastrophic to the budget because UC by it's very nature has to run on a thin budget margin. 

They're response is going to involve laying off associate and adjunct professors (among other positions), which will mean some classes don't get taught, which means more students will take time off etc. 

Campus full time employees such as groundskeepers and maintenance are also going to start looking for other jobs if UC lags behind the city in terms of opening back up again, and then UCSC has to spend time and money refilling those positions.

My prediction is that classes happen in person but remote options are available upon request, and certain professors with a high risk take a year off. The longer this goes on, the risk is going to get smaller, and the group for which the risk isn't worth taking is going to get smaller, and eventually the needs of the many will outweigh the needs of the few.

My advice: Find housing that goes on a month by month basis so you can back out if classes are online."

Swimming,ff2zepy,t1_ff2e5w3,1579529466.0,"Alright, it sounds like you have the core strength, and it wouldn't be accurate to say that you are still learning how to swim. You're also used to heavy training and at least you were doing a normal training load for highschool.

With that in mind, I'm going to guess that you probably need help with your stroke efficiency because it seems like you're not used to long distances and especially because you find fly to be your best stroke at this stage. That's something you can practice. Still do your best to find a coach who can help you, but also look up some freestyle drills and practice them at least an hour a day if you can.

Best of luck!"
