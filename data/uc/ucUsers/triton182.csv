This school seriously prepped me for the real world, has a lot of connections and looks really good on your resume 

All my friends have FAANG tier jobs, and I got a job with the biggest global firm in my field, and if it wasn't for UCSD I probably wouldn't be where I am now 

The main complaints about this school is how 'socially dead' it is , which to be fair it kind of is, people generally stick to their circle of friends and there aren't wild parties outside of greek life so if you don't make the effort to get yourself out there you are kind of stuck to study
And on another note, everyone here is seriously dedicated to their studying so the vibe is a lot more serious
The faculty at this school are amazing, have great industry connections and classes are top tier 
The location is great and its just a great environment 

As some of the top comments on this thread said some people are kind of stuck up and 'cut throat' when it comes to academics but YMMV imo there will always be kids like that and you get to choose who you surround yourself with
There really is no 'school spirit' here so if you're craving like a USC/UCLA/SDSU vibe with everybody partying you're not going to find it here but that doesn't mean its a bad environment
Hindsight is 20-20 and a lot of people think 'oh if I would have gone to SDSU/UCLA/Etc I would have been partying fucking bitches left and right blah blah', it really depends on your priorities 
This school's atmosphere just kinda sucks and believe me the campus is pretty dead since everyone commutes, the mts system is so crowded, the rent around the university is expensive, but I would say its still worth it to come here solely based on the opportunities that are available here in every field"
