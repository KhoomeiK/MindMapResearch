AskReddit,fpj1qr4,t3_gbxneq,1588654188.0,"a few years ago i was bussing to my friends house so we could go to great america. My dad had taken my phone away a fews day prior (he grounded me a lot) so i had no way of contacting my friends until i met them in person. I ended up getting lost and missing my stop. The bus driver dropped me off at the airport on the other side of town and wished me the best. I found a woman waiting for someone on a bench and asked her if she could call me an uber. The ride ended up costing around $30 and she was hesitant to pay, but I was otherwise stranded since my parents wouldn't come home for hours. She ended up paying for everything and i left with a thank you. I always regret that I never asked for her phone number or email so I could pay her back. dumb ungrateful thirteen year old me."

AmericanU,fo8zgad,t1_fo8enqr,1587607132.0,thanks so much! I'm planning on doing a double major in International Affairs and Environmental Science. I'm more of a STEM person than political (although I'm a huge activist I do not like arguing) which is why I'm a little wary of studying in DC. My major or career path might change though since I'm definitely not the most decisive person and my parents keep pushing me to go to med school instead.
