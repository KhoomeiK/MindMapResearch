AnimalCrossing,fpid5ty,t3_g997ij,1588638474.0,How do I get more villagers to come to my island? I just got my seventh today who came from the campsite but is there any faster way than waiting for them?
ucla,fpdq15d,t1_fpdo7kb,1588531922.0,"Thank you, I’m hopeful that they won’t but then again the admission process is known to be rather ruthless so who knows. It may sound bad, but knowing I’m not in this alone is definitely comforting"
TurnipStonkMarket,fpda26t,t3_gcr373,1588522895.0,I’d probably say my fav movie is Avengers: Infinity war. Watched it wayyyy too many times

ucla,fpc7oip,t3_gck03j,1588490406.0,"I just took a midterm on Thursday and I legit cried after. Not because it was some impossible exam, but because I was so overly stressed by everything going on that I had a hard time studying. Everything on the exam was in my notes, but I just couldn’t focus. Both my parents went to get tested this weekend and who knows maybe one of them has it. I’ve been feeling awfully shitty these last few days but I can’t tell whether it’s the ro ro or just stress and allergies. I want to take all of my classes P/NP but I’m worried that if I do end up deciding to go to grad school that will ruin my chances of getting in anywhere decent, making it mandatory would take away so much stress. It’s not like I wouldn’t pay attention because I’m still paying so I might as well learn something"

AnimalCrossing,fp2o554,t3_g997ij,1588265073.0,"I’m in the part of the game where I am trying to get my star rating up. However, I am trying to avoid building more bridges and inclines because I want to wait until after I terraform. Is this possible? Or do I need to build bridges and inclines in order to get a three star rating?"

ucla,fozz8zh,t3_gafamc,1588199533.0,"Yep I feel it. It was hard adjusting to ucla, but once I finally did, I had to go home early and not even get to experience my first year in its entirety. I want to be optimistic, but it’s really hard to be especially after getting that email yesterday."

Spectrum,fmww5sm,t1_fmv69a0,1586454097.0,"Yea that makes sense.  I totally understand that the traffic is so much higher now and that would cause congestion.  I guess it just doesn’t make sense to me why they would only set up the POP servers for the average instead of setting them up assuming that everyone is online at the same time.  I understand in normal circumstances that would be overkill, but it would ultimately be beneficial if the need arises.

Also, thanks for the in depth explanation, it definitely clears things up from a technical standpoint."
