She’s come to terms with it...not much she could do at the time it happened. Maybe the professor will take the WiFi outage into consideration when grading."
UCDavis,fph4ub1,t3_gdeyme,1588614990.0,XFinity went down in the middle of my housemate’s physics midterm
interestingasfuck,fp7no75,t3_gbkwc0,1588374094.0,"As someone who’s been watching their chem TA listlessly read a boring PowerPoint for “labs”, I would love a program like this. I have not learned a single thing in lab since online classes became a thing, and since we no longer get the hands-on experience, this is a wonderful substitute. At the very least during the quarantine."
UCDavis,fosa55t,t1_fos9ifk,1588026753.0,Yep!

UCDavis,fnnqfuz,t3_g2lkd5,1587098793.0,"Alumni don’t get access unless they’re part of the alumni association (which makes you pay a fee every year). You can also apply for a Library card, for about a hundred or so dollars, which is almost as much as the alumni fee. The library card needs to be paid for every year."

UCDavis,fnkayez,t3_g205ni,1587020504.0,"Depending on how the interview is conducted, I’d be interested!"
UCDavis,fnkawlx,t3_g2510t,1587020457.0,Wondering the same thing.
UCDavis,fn3nx3i,t3_fympyb,1586624491.0,"I switched from the Neuroscience CogSci Major because it ended up being more about the philosophy of the brain than the actual brain functions itself. “Why IS the brain? Does the mind truly exist? Is the mind logical?” In my opinion, it was a huge waste of time, since I am interested in neurobiology research and I don’t think I learned anything relevant to my current major (Psychology with the Biology emphasis)."
UCDavis,fmrkzf1,t3_fv8ox8,1586326444.0,"If you can get a job directly out of your undergrad and earn a steadily growing salary, grad school will only burn you out and drain your money supply for no reason. Don’t go to grad school unless you’re super passionate about smthng or it’s absolutely necessary for the career you want."
AcademicPsychology,flrn7ts,t3_fqq2pr,1585423708.0,I’m not sure if this is the right subreddit for you to seek therapy/resources relating to this personal issue
