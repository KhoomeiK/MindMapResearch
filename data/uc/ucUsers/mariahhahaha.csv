UCSC,fox6d0t,t3_ga1bfw,1588135183.0,i was really sussed out when it asked me for my address just to sign up? Why would I need to provide my address for the account when i haven’t even paid for anything to require a billing address.

I got a small triple, but my friends on different floors has huge rooms so it’s just luck. But as a 2nd year you get priority living at your residential college’s apartments and the RCC apartments by far, are the best ones on campus (maybe i’m bias because i live in one) but there’s enough apartments so it isn’t a competition to get one (like with other colleges) and my triple and living room is huge. it is far from what i call the middle of campus (aka where you can reach science hill and the quarry easily) but i loved living there for the views and just overall vibe of the college. also depending on which quad/area you live in, you’ll get one of the first on campus stops for a loop meaning empty bus and don’t need to worry about not getting on."
