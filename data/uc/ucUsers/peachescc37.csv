I think you should give Cal another shot. I didn‚Äôt really find my best friends until sophomore year. You have to put yourself out there - join social clubs that match your interests. A lot of people join AFX and find their friends there.

ApplyingToCollege,fp7aa8w,t3_gbnhxo,1588366881.0,"First off, we go to college for a good return on investment and to get a job so heres the differences in UCLA career outcomes vs Cal career outcomes: 
Cal: https://career.berkeley.edu/survey/survey
UCLA: https://www.sairo.ucla.edu/First-Destination-Survey-Data
As you can see, Cal graduates on average earn $15k more than UCLA grads ($70k Cal, $55k UCLA) and are 11% more likely to be employed full time after graduation (56% Cal, 45% UCLA). Looking at the majors individually, Cal grads make more and are more likely to be employed. The mechanical engineering major at Cal has a 56% full time employment rate while UCLA has a 41%. Only 18% of Cal mech e grade are still seeking employment while 28% of UCLA mech e grads are seeking employment. That‚Äôs a whole 10% difference! Be proud you‚Äôre going to Berkeley, the prestige here is real. You‚Äôll be graduating with a higher likelihood of getting a good paying job (that‚Äôs what we invest in college for!) We‚Äôre not the public Ivy for nothing! 

Second, there are also endless things to do at Cal. Unlike LA where you need a car to get everywhere (also TRAFFIC!) we have a great public transportation system. Cal gives every student an AC transit card and you can take the public buses for as many times for free. Take the F bus for 15 minutes and you can go shopping at Emeryville. Stay on the bus for another 45ish minutes and you‚Äôll find yourself in SF! On days when I didn‚Äôt have many classes, I took the bus to SF to study at Salesforce park :). If you want a faster way to get to the city, take the bart (our subway system). A 5 minute bus ride on 51B (or 15 min walk) gets you to the Downtown Berkeley BART station. Take the subway for 30 minutes and you‚Äôll be in the city. Berkeley itself is a city to explore and I love the convenience. No need to take an Uber to get your shampoo or other essentials because right across campus is a plethora of small shops you can get your essentials from. Also something I found lacking when I visited the UCLA campus was nature. The Berkeley campus has so much nature, we have strawberry creek, lots of trees, the botanical gardens, big C hiking trail, it‚Äôs endless. UCLA was very brick imo and didn‚Äôt have much diversity in terms of the campus buildings. 

Also, there are soooo many different student orgs and students here. Not everyone is into the grind and cutthroat culture, you‚Äôll definitely find people who party often. Sororities and Frats are present at Cal. I‚Äôm not sure where all these stereotypes about Berkeley being stressful and cutthroat come from tbh, we‚Äôre such a diverse campus not everyone is the same, we should be old enough to not generalize. I don‚Äôt think UCLA would be any less or more social. It‚Äôs still a difficult institution with weeder classes. Come and you‚Äôll find your group of people at Cal. 

I hope this helps! Honestly, there‚Äôs been a lot of negativity around Cal on here but all of it is because people seem to like to feed into the stereotypes and exaggerate them (many of the people blowing up the stereotypes aren‚Äôt even Cal students or alumni so what would they know) so don‚Äôt listen to those. You‚Äôll have a blast here don‚Äôt look back! Go bearsüêªüíõüíô"

It is a feeder school into Wall Street, investment banks, big-name tech, the big 4, consulting, etc. Go on LinkedIn and you'll see that most econ majors are interning or working full time at McKinsey, Goldman Sachs, PWC, Deloitte, Google, Facebook, etc. The Berkeley brand will bring you far both in the USA and DEFINITELY outside of the USA. I have relatives on the other side of the globe who see Berkeley as the Harvard of the East."
CollegeVsCollege,fo2dvjk,t3_fqlpvf,1587458649.0,"Berkeley all the way!! Econ program at Cal is ranked #1 in the nation alongside Harvard, Stanford, Princeton, and MIT https://www.usnews.com/best-graduate-schools/top-humanities-schools/economics-rankings and HAAS is just trailing behind UPenn Wharton and MIT for business undergrad https://www.usnews.com/best-colleges/rankings/business. My friends who majored in either Econ or Business all ended up at big banks like Goldman Sachs and top consulting firms like McKinsey and the Big 4"
ApplyingToCollege,fo2d16u,t1_fnqjs2f,1587457756.0,"If u love Berkeley for pretty much everything u should go! The CS, psych, and cog sci programs are all ranked #1 at Cal according to us news (alongside Stanford, MIT, ivies etc.) Go with ur gut u can‚Äôt go wrong with either tbh :) and classes are only gonna be big in general ed lectures and some lower divs. Once u hit junior year those classes will get much smaller (>30 students per class)"
ApplyingToCollege,fo26o7o,t3_g4jsp5,1587451436.0,"Go to Berkeley! Like you said, it‚Äôs pretty much ranked within the top 5 for most majors ranging from STEM to humanities so no major can go wrong at Cal :) also I agree that NorCal > Baltimore. I have family friends who went to Berkeley for undergrad and are now at JHU for med school and they feel much safer in NorCal."
ApplyingToCollege,fo25s74,t3_g4l6o3,1587450624.0,I felt exactly the same way when I got admitted back in 2016! I had a 3.8 gpa so not that much better than you. I also had sleepless nights debating whether or not I should attend a less prestigious uni but I ended up choosing Cal for the challenge. Fast forward to today I graduated in 3 years! Nothing‚Äôs impossible if u work hard for what u want :) u got admitted for a reason! Go and have the best time üíôüíõ
ApplyingToCollege,fo24op3,t3_g4qaao,1587449628.0,Definitely Berkeley! It has the #1 CS undergrad program tied with MIT and Stanford https://www.usnews.com/best-graduate-schools/top-science-schools/computer-science-rankings. Cal‚Äôs job placements and connections to Silicon Valley are invaluable. CS Alumni are all over California and Seattle ranging from Facebook to Google to LinkedIn to Microsoft to Amazon. My housemates were both CS majors and 2 are currently at Google and the other at Facebook and since it sounds like ur confident in ur coding skills I‚Äôd say declaring won‚Äôt be a concern. Go for it :)
ApplyingToCollege,fo23nqf,t3_g51486,1587448732.0,Lol how much did the University of Spoiled Children pay for this
ApplyingToCollege,fo21id2,t1_fo201e8,1587446937.0,Ur gonna love it! Go bears!! üíôüíõüêª
CollegeVsCollege,fo1x15p,t3_frfe7y,1587443513.0,"I‚Äôd go with Berkeley! HAAS has excellent connections to and rep with top banks, consulting firms, big 4, tech, etc. It‚Äôs definitely a big target school. It‚Äôs ranked #3 for the best undergrad business program in the nation (only behind UPenn and MIT) https://www.usnews.com/best-colleges/rankings/business. It‚Äôs also 30 mins away from San Francisco and Silicon Valley. It‚Äôs basically Wall Street of the West coast. Also you can‚Äôt beat regents - you‚Äôll have housing all 4 years and priority when choosing classes"
CollegeVsCollege,fo1vgbq,t3_fut7i9,1587442404.0,"I‚Äôd say Berkeley, it‚Äôs ranked #1 for Econ tied with Harvard, MIT, Princeton and Stanford and I‚Äôm sure law school admissions will take note of the fact that you graduated w an Econ degree from a prestigious program! https://www.usnews.com/best-graduate-schools/top-humanities-schools/economics-rankings"
CollegeVsCollege,fo1uiz8,t3_fwa7ti,1587441803.0,Berkeley CS for sure will set you up for success. CS at Berkeley is ranked #1 tied with Stanford and MIT!
CollegeVsCollege,fo18e8n,t3_fxeozf,1587427855.0,"I'd say go to Berkeley for these reasons:

1. You can easily declare the economics major at Berkeley after taking the necessary pre-reqs, while it is close to impossible to transfer into USC Marshall (highly competitive and sought after)
2. Economics is ranked #1 in the nation at Berkeley, tied with Harvard, Princeton, Stanford, and MIT [https://www.usnews.com/best-graduate-schools/top-humanities-schools/economics-rankings](https://www.usnews.com/best-graduate-schools/top-humanities-schools/economics-rankings). At Berkeley you will have classes taught by the best professors who are leading the economics field, such as Christina and David Romer, who were top economic advisors for Obama and his administration. Lots of people also take courses with Robert Reich, who was the former United States Secretary of Labor which I think is absolutely awesome and an invaluable learning experience you can only get at Berkeley.
3. Prestige - regardless of whether you are in HAAS or majoring in economics, the opportunities are endless. Berkeley is a target school, just like the Ivys. It is a feeder school into Wall Street, investment banks, big-name tech, the big 4, consulting, etc. Go on LinkedIn and you'll see that most econ majors are interning or working full time at McKinsey, Goldman Sachs, PWC, Deloitte, Google, Facebook, etc.

The prestige and reputation that Berkeley has built up over the years have made it a place where big names desperately want to recruit talent. These companies and firms know that Berkeley kids truly have the work ethic and brains to help their companies thrive. In fact, I got my current full-time consulting role at one of the biggest consulting firms and I didn't even apply for the position. A recruiter reached out to me via our school's job portal called Handshake and told me to come in for an interview. I wasn't even a HAAS or econ major (I wasn't even a tech major) and was able to secure the job. She told me that UC Berkeley students are of quality regardless of their major. This is definitely not an opportunity I would've gotten if I went to any other school. Also, the UC Berkeley brand will bring you far both in the USA and DEFINITELY outside of the USA (while USC not so much - UCLA more so). I have relatives on the other side of the globe who see Berkeley as the Harvard of the East. For someone who wants to work abroad later on in life, this is a huge plus. I won't have any trouble landing a good job outside of the US.

4) Tuition - you don't want to be paying $80k+ a year for undergrad and put yourself in $320k+ debt by the time you graduated, especially if you plan on getting an MBA postgrad, so if you are in-state, definitely go to Berkeley for Ivy league caliber education for less than half the price

5) Location - yes, Berkeley can be unsafe for being in a city but USC is not much different. I've visited both campuses and USC is definitely not any safer than Berkeley. There have been students in the past that got shot walking around the USC area and it's very much in a dangerous part of downtown LA. I have friends that said they've heard gunshots in the middle of the night from their dorms. Since both locations are dangerous, think of which location (Norcal or Socal) will be more beneficial for your postgrad. San Francisco has more banking/finance opportunities as well as Silicon Valley big tech while LA has more opportunities in entertainment. 

Hope this helps you make a decision! Let us know which you end up committing to :) honestly you'll end up where you need to be! :)"
