Dahl is a really great professor too so i would definitely recommend taking the class or any other classes he teaches! (-:"
UCSC,fpkoyqv,t1_fpklupd,1588698518.0,"Yes! I believe they just offered it this spring quarter because there werenâ€™t enough senior seminars available, so Iâ€™m not sure if itâ€™ll continue to be available to take during spring quarter. 

So the class is Emotional Development, so far weâ€™ve just been covering the topic broadly ( mainly looking at different theories on emotional development/ emotion regulation/ emotions as constructs/ etc.). 

We do have a 5-7 page research paper due at the end of the quarter but the class is set up so that certain sections of it are due throughout the quarter. Itâ€™s not a super crazy research paper either, itâ€™s basically just picking a topic on emotional development and then 3/4 of the paper is a literature review and the other 1/4 is a research proposal. 

The class mainly focuses on writing this paper & Dahl does go over the readings/ reading topics In class. Iâ€™m not sure if the course is a little simplified due to the current pandemic but itâ€™s definitely not as stressful as I would have imagine a senior seminar to be!"

UCSC,fpjis0c,t3_gdqtuz,1588670067.0,"Iâ€™ve taken classes with both Storm (PSYC 100) & Dahl (PSYC 112 & PSYC 119K currently), theyâ€™re both pretty great professors in my opinion! 

Also Dahl has been pretty awesome so far with online courses, especially teaching a senior seminar class. Super understanding & allows for alternative methods for attendance"

relationships,fovs8la,t3_g9v134,1588106631.0,"The fact that your therapists SO is friends with your boyfriend raises lots of ethical concerns with your therapist. Also their inability to build boundaries with clients (talking about their daughter, asking your bf questions about you, etc.) hinders their ability to really help since they canâ€™t remain unbiased. 

If I were you I would just try to explain to your boyfriend that the therapists inability to remain unbiased and practice ethically wonâ€™t allow him to really receive effective therapy. Iâ€™m not really sure about coping with the situation if your boyfriend decides to continue to be client of that therapist but I think the best you could do is find a better therapist that wonâ€™t let their personal life get in the way of their professional one. 

Hope this helps a little & good luck. This seems like a tricky situation to be in."
