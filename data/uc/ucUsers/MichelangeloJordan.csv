UCSantaBarbara,fpad9d9,t3_gca4a4,1588445760.0,"CS 8 is super easy and PSTAT 130 is the easiest programming (SAS) upper div on campus.     
However, if you are new to programming, learning 2 languages’ syntax at the same time may be a challenge. Even still, both courses were not a challenge at all. I skipped nearly every lecture of PSTAT 130 and still got a B."

I personally have some reservations about Dr. Fung’s explanation for the underlying biology of his treatments but his patients have good outcomes - and I have 0 problems with that."
fasting,foo961l,t1_fomx961,1587934927.0,"This doesn’t meet the standard for scientific evidence, but most people here ascribe their beliefs of fasting reducing loose skin to Dr. Jason Fung. Here is one of his articles https://www.dietdoctor.com/how-dolly-went-from-obesity-and-metabolic-syndrome
Not saying this is beyond reproach, but this is the “proof” for many people here."

fasting,fobpv1f,t3_g6lvpi,1587662364.0,"Carbs affect water retention big time. Look up hyponatremia (low amount of sodium in the blood). I recommend a tiny pinch of lite salt or sea salt in your drink of choice.   

Additionally - some of that discomfort is your body getting used to new eating habits. Stick with it long enough and your body should adapt."
UCSantaBarbara,fo8epko,t1_fo8e5vk,1587595135.0,Berkeley? You mean the one that was [unranked for misreporting data](https://www.berkeleyside.com/2019/07/28/uc-berkeley-kicked-off-the-u-s-news-world-report-rankings-of-best-u-s-colleges)?

I had a similar experience while working for a startup during undergrad - ended up getting a 1.7 GPA that quarter lmao. I'd rather take a loan/borrow money than go through that mental exhaustion again.   
Your labor is really cheap right now. If you are skilled enough to make their product as a student, they are going to milk you for everything you've got. Don't let them take advantage of you - it's YOUR future that they want to set aside to make this app.    
There's always more to do but you don't have to be the one to do it."
cscareerquestions,fo0f52h,t3_g4viz4,1587411999.0,"A firm and diplomatic no. Something like:   

“Hi SM,      

I appreciate your desire to help us work effectively in light of this pandemic. However, due to the need for social distancing for the health of our team and our families, I am very uncomfortable with the idea of you visiting my home and must decline.     
This may potentially cause exposure to the virus and I do not want to risk our health.     
  
I am open to suggestions for improving our workflows that can be done remotely.   

Thank you,   
Fuzzy_Draft”

UCSantaBarbara,fnq121s,t3_g343gw,1587155665.0,I'm sorry that happened to you OP. Those comments reflect way more on the student that wrote them than on you. I'm sure 99% of students really appreciate the effort you put into the course but the 1% of bad apples really are the worst.
