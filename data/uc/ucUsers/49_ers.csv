modernwarfare,fpe5yrn,t3_g95yhq,1588541021.0,Is it worth it to buy modern warfare rn? I haven‚Äôt had a COD since BO2 and quarantine got to me. I‚Äôm meh at this point with warzone but I really miss playing an actual cod game.
shittymobilegameads,fp4n763,t1_fp4mmry,1588302743.0,I think you‚Äôd have to argue for some kind of monetary loss to sue for so that why they get away with it
ApplyingToCollege,fp04de2,t1_fozql3t,1588202258.0,I like that we are coming together but feel left out since I'm majoring in neuroscience :(

chanceme,fnlj6zt,t3_g2h9kr,1587054465.0,Write good essays and you‚Äôll have as good a chance as anyone at those schools. Just remember the really elite schools are a crapshoot.
vexillology,fnhhda5,t1_fnhaqs3,1586962429.0,I like this a lot too. Feels more natural.
vexillology,fnfyzr9,t1_fnfyjzy,1586918523.0,"Yeah the blue stripe I definitely thought about making bigger and there was no reason for a 4 pointed star vs a 5 pointed one. 

But yeah that‚Äôs for the suggestions the bigger blue stripe looks a lot better."
vexillology,fnfx7xm,t3_g1j6xh,1586917405.0, So I have been bored and I did some research and my small town of about 5000 doesn‚Äôt have a city flag so I decided to make one. The dark green represents the huge forest that covers most of the town. The blue represents the many lakes and rivers that cut through the city and the white star represents the future of the town since the population has grown 200% (!) population wise over the last 10 years.
baylor,fnfo1b6,t3_g1grfe,1586911910.0,This would affect scholarships for the current high school junior class I‚Äôm assuming?
ACT,fnfibsr,t3_g1esfv,1586908599.0,Congrats! What state?
nextfuckinglevel,fnevpmb,t1_fnenp7y,1586896745.0,Saw the same exact thing. No shame smh
ApplyingToCollege,fnebbsz,t3_g19vef,1586886314.0,"It will differ for every AO, but if you‚Äôre taking about this specific testing cycle I have emailed a lot of colleges about this and they said they understand not taking the online test because of COVID. 

So it probably won‚Äôt hurt you this year however I would still recommend trying to take the tests just in case."

ACT,fnead75,t3_g0so82,1586885835.0,Don‚Äôt need too if you don‚Äôt want too. 34+ is good enough for any school/any major so trying for any more once your there would be for personal pride.
ACT,fne9p6a,t3_g0yq1m,1586885506.0,"I‚Äôll tell this to everyone as long as I‚Äôm breathing: the easiest way to improve your ACT score is to practice English.

It is 99% rule based which means after a few weeks of meaningful studying most people can get 33+ on that section. 

So I would start there and the rest should naturally come up through high school."
ACT,fne9g2k,t3_g11bai,1586885380.0,"Week 7 and a half here, ACT better get it together"
ApplyingToCollege,fndud6o,t1_fnct315,1586877658.0,Bro write a book or something that was some philosopher stuff
ACT,fnblnxu,t1_fnbf5ir,1586817744.0,"That‚Äôs a good idea, also try some English practice tests and maybe get a study guide.

English is 99% rule memorization so after a few weeks of consistent studying don‚Äôt be surprised if you get a 34+ in English."
ACT,fnbdwpq,t3_g0pe59,1586813808.0,"English is almost 100% rule based so I‚Äôd suggest getting a study guide and focusing on that. 

I‚Äôd bet a lot of money that most people can get 32+ in English if they would just study."
ACT,fnbdrov,t3_g0r2hu,1586813737.0,Ignore all the other scores on this sub. This score is 5 points above the national average. That score can get you into a lot of really good universities that will give you great opportunities to succeed. Seriously.
ApplyingToCollege,fn6f0h4,t1_fn5nj8l,1586697466.0,"So I took both this year and due to COVID they aren‚Äôt letting us take both tests this year. So I emailed a bunch of the colleges and they said to take BC instead of AB. 

I won‚Äôt be taking AB again I‚Äôm taking linear algebra so I should still be using the basics of AB and get the credit on next years round of APs."

ApplyingToCollege,fn59p5j,t1_fn52q9e,1586659327.0,Yup. And with the ‚Äúis it worth it‚Äù decisions it comes down to cost and other options anyways so more info is particularly important.
ACT,fn57174,t3_fzltci,1586657470.0,I called the ACT Friday and they said that if I didn't have me score by next Friday (April 18th) to call them back.
ApplyingToCollege,fn400dm,t3_fze6kk,1586631289.0,I used to be 100% into doing aviation in college and after a lot of research Daytona is probably the best choice. They have a lot of connections all over the aviation industry no matter what you actually do. Prescott is good as well.
ACT,fn32rrp,t1_fn2dpdz,1586611338.0,"Super scored, not straight up"
ACT,fn11kpu,t3_fymkfr,1586552958.0,here
ACT,fn11ik0,t3_fynqkl,1586552925.0,It really depends on where you are applying. If your ECs and GPA are good you could probably get in STEM to some state colleges. It also depends on your individual scores so if you did better in the math and science sections then you would have a much better chance.
ApplyingToCollege,fn0luo7,t3_fyluxs,1586544329.0,I don‚Äôt think anyone actually does this. Maybe for financial reasons.
ApplyingToCollege,fn0cfo6,t1_fn09qif,1586539390.0,I‚Äôll definitely try that around application time. I already know Baylor has no application fees which is great but I‚Äôll email everyone else thanks.
ApplyingToCollege,fn09esi,t1_fn093to,1586537823.0,Not low income enough I‚Äôve already tried to look into that. And right now that $950 is for 14 colleges.
chanceme,fmxbfs4,t1_fmx6zdp,1586461906.0,Never taken an SAT subject test but I'm assuming the biology one would be good. Any other ones you would recommend?
chanceme,fmxbc02,t1_fmx53db,1586461852.0,Yeah ND was right on the border for me. The other matches I think I have an above 50% chance even with the gpa and ecs.
ApplyingToCollege,fmx2pwa,t3_fxxoft,1586457409.0,"It's connected with the meta of A2C as a whole. The vast majority of people on this subreddit are extremely high achieving students relative to the rest of the student body. The higher ranked the student the more likely they are interested in more lucrative majors that are more competitive and reap more benefits monetarily. 

In general the pool of people here are the pool of people that would succeed in business, engineering or premed."
ApplyingToCollege,fmx2c69,t3_fxxpwz,1586457216.0,Congrats! Take advantage of the opportunity.
ApplyingToCollege,fmutvmi,t1_fmusqd3,1586398774.0,Never thought of that! Kissing family is probably a good sign of a well rounded student.
ApplyingToCollege,fmuq6dl,t1_fmupxqo,1586396504.0,How could you forget to tell them! I‚Äôd have your tree contact the alumni association NOW.
ApplyingToCollege,fmuq0k3,t3_fxj9wg,1586396407.0,As a junior in high school that wants to do pre-Med I think my medical experience gives me enough credibility to say we don‚Äôt know.
ApplyingToCollege,fmunj76,t3_fx9oco,1586394925.0,I'm having a minor existential crisis realizing it is now my turn to go through the chaos that is this process after watching you guys do it for the past 3 years. I'll definitely be using this info to help me out lol thank you.
ACT,fmterxt,t3_fxactr,1586371495.0,Same here. Got an email from the ACT about college matching so I think the wait is almost over.
ACT,fmtepfe,t3_fxav5k,1586371461.0,That 35 in math is nice thoüëÄ
ACT,fmteirj,t3_fxbc6c,1586371372.0,Congrats. Here‚Äôs a W
ApplyingToCollege,fmsbgmi,t1_fms9y6i,1586351783.0,I‚Äôll definitely go through my list again with the calculator. I cannot afford anywhere near that lol.
ApplyingToCollege,fmsbctt,t1_fmrqi5s,1586351711.0,I actually didn‚Äôt notice how selective they were for OOS. 41% for in-state to 13% OOS. Thanks so much.
ApplyingToCollege,fmsb9jm,t1_fms638q,1586351649.0,Lol yeah if I had a 36 in 7th grade I don‚Äôt think I would be worrying this much about my ECs.
ApplyingToCollege,fmrpapg,t1_fmrox42,1586330546.0,Yeah my school has something similar to CDS and it isn‚Äôt a good outlook for the UCs. The leadership ECs is something I‚Äôve been trying to add as well but at this point like you and some of the other replies said I‚Äôm just going to have to kill the essays.
ApplyingToCollege,fmrognz,t1_fmro763,1586329722.0,"Yeah I‚Äôve been thinking about it, I visited a few months ago and it might have been a bad day but it kind of felt gloomy lol. But I‚Äôve heard great things."
ApplyingToCollege,fmrodl3,t1_fmro66u,1586329641.0,Alright thanks.
ApplyingToCollege,fmro0zr,t1_fmrnqtu,1586329304.0,I appreciate it. I am OOS for the UCs though and I am worried about that based on what other people are saying. I‚Äôve heard it affects the financial aid a lot but not the actual acceptance rate.
ApplyingToCollege,fmrnoxg,t1_fmrng53,1586328982.0,"Fair, I think I‚Äôll add some more safeties as I find some that I like. I also don‚Äôt know of any other ECs I could add at this point that could relate to Biology but I‚Äôll do some digging. Thanks"
ApplyingToCollege,fmrnfuw,t1_fmrn9pu,1586328742.0,My HS is very highly ranked but with no class rank. Public and a very large graduating class as well if it helps.
ApplyingToCollege,fmrnch9,t1_fmrmz0w,1586328653.0,I‚Äôm kind of assuming I‚Äôll go 1 for 5 with the top 5 but hopefully it is a solid chance.
ApplyingToCollege,fmrn01u,t3_fx0zt3,1586328325.0,Robber baron
ApplyingToCollege,fmrlozh,t1_fmqjfh6,1586327102.0,65-70k OOS for UCs? Is that really happening? Wow I thought UCs offered more aid than usual.
ApplyingToCollege,fmrljjo,t3_fx11ab,1586326960.0,"UCLA is a top school in almost every single major, it‚Äôs also in a beautiful area of LA. Speaking of LA, every single during college and post college opportunity you could want is right there.

Hate to be blunt but you‚Äôre in your own head here, rankings at the very top do not matter. You got accepted into a t10 university, be proud."
ElectricSkateboarding,fmresoo,t1_fmrd20k,1586321126.0,Thank you that‚Äôs what I assumed. And to your last point if I do end up getting one I won‚Äôt be riding near anyone or anything for awhile lol.
ElectricSkateboarding,fmrc1zr,t3_drdsrv,1586318994.0,"I just have a quick question regarding mini boards and it‚Äôs that I‚Äôve heard they‚Äôre more difficult to handle. I‚Äôm looking at getting my first electric skateboard for college next year and having a small board seems so much easier for bringing around campus/class.

But I‚Äôm worried about the handling issues since my only board experience is that I‚Äôve snowboarded most of my life, never really picked up a skateboard.

So is the trade off between handling and portability worth it in my situation? Anything helps thanks."
ucla,fmnetha,t1_fmn7iru,1586224442.0,I‚Äôm gonna do this it makes too much sense lol.
ACT,fmgp1og,t3_fv5tyi,1586054116.0,Upvoting for good luck sheesh
