USC and Stanford used antibody testing to show that the mortality rate is actually at .12%-.20% if and when It is shown that Georgia is fine after opening up its economy then I hope people have the hindsight to say that it was overblown. If I am wrong I will gladly admit it."

Study out of USC estimates death rate as low as 0.2% because when using a test for covid antibodies rather than PCR on random civilians, it is found that a significant portion of the population has already been infected and didn’t know it.
A non-peer reviewer study out of Stanford found that number as low as 0.12%.

We now have data from New York, Iceland, and a few other places that corroborate these findings.
Japanese are right."
