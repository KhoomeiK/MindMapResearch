This virus is gonna spread and you are gonna have to accept that. People die and that’s how life works. 360,000 people are born every day and less than 250,000 have died from this virus so far. This pandemic is honestly a joke"
UCSantaBarbara,fpc9k6w,t3_gcg3ri,1588492322.0,These measures in place are prolonging the inevitable. Most people will get this virus and attacking people for not “social distancing” when you have no idea if they are just with their housemates is so stupid. If you are that afraid then just lock yourself in doors. Some people don’t want to live in fear. Since hospitals are relatively empty it’s time to go outside baby! It’s a lost cause my friends
UCSantaBarbara,fp2xrow,t1_fp1jhja,1588269662.0,A vaccine for SARS for declared the #1 priority for years after the outbreak in 2003 and there still isn’t one. We have never created a vaccine for a coronavirus and studies are showing that a vaccine (if possible) will be like the flu vaccine where they guess that variation each year. It’s a bad mindset to believe that there will be a vaccine soon. Not to mention human trials take at least a year
UCSantaBarbara,fp2vwd1,t1_fp2p676,1588268766.0,Lol if I was fat and unhealthy yeah of course I would. I’ve talked to my grandparents and they say that’s it’s insane that we have to shut everything down for their demographic. Literally said that’s it’s insane that we have to lose 12 years of job growth so the elderly can live a few more years while really damaging everyone else’s future. If they get it they might die and I’m fully prepared for that. That’s the cycle of life
UCSantaBarbara,fp1gnou,t1_fp1fwog,1588234885.0,Do you honestly think we should shut everything down for the possibility of ~2% of the population to die? We would still have an increase in human population due to so many births. It’s all about the taking care of the greater good my friend. We have too many people on this earth and because of it these viruses are arising
UCSantaBarbara,fp1fsv3,t1_fp1f7gj,1588234059.0,You should definitely not see anyone who is immunocompromised so that argument is silly. Also transmission on a beach is quite low lol just keep your distance to protect yourself from this pathetic virus
UCSantaBarbara,fp1evyl,t1_fp1e4ah,1588233197.0,"Haha yes I’m aware but there are many hospitals that are empty in CA. For example, there are 4,000 empty beds in San Diego alone. Studies are showing that this virus have a mortality rate of 0.2-1% which is nothing. Yes virus kill people but so does unemployment and mental health. Majority of people dying are obese so why should I have to lose my job and not be able to enjoy outdoor activities because others decided to get fat and unhealthy? For people that are immunocompromised  just stay inside. People die that’s life"
UCSantaBarbara,fp1dxa2,t1_fp1chw7,1588232304.0,It’s already been weeks and there is no end in sight because people somehow think “staying inside” is going to eradicate a disease that’s projected to be the next flu in the since that it will keep coming back as a new variation
UCSantaBarbara,fp1bqs5,t1_fp1bghw,1588230307.0,Closing down very wide open spaces for people to stay sane makes no sense. You have a much greater chance of getting infected at a grocery store. Being this restrictive will just lead to civil unrest. You really think this will stop people from seeing each other? These same people will just go to their friends houses lol
UCSantaBarbara,fp1b1wd,t3_gaqgrx,1588229693.0,This is so fucking stupid. Makes no sense
