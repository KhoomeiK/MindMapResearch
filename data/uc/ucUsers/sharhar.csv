berkeley,fpf2cel,t1_fpf1rh5,1588560160.0,OMG! That completely fixes my problem! Thank you so much!
berkeley,fpevani,t1_fpeuxct,1588555710.0,"I need 61a to declare, and having an A on it would significantly lower the stress of 61B and 70. I'm now realizing that since I'm just a freshman, this class probably won't matter too much in the long run, but I'm gonna have to really work my ass off now to make sure I don't get below a B-. Do you think it would be a good idea to email my College Advisor? Is advising at Cal actually helpful? I've never actually talked to my college advisor before."
berkeley,fperhho,t1_fper5xv,1588553381.0,"From my rough calculations, it should take my final grade down by around 8% (almost a letter grade), since out of the three components of my final grade (midterm, final, and homework) homework is worth 35% and one of the homeworks I accidentally missed was worth double the points. There are also no homework drops. And I really don't wanna have a B- in my physics class when I had all A's last semester."
physicsmemes,fp7i55f,t1_fp7er5d,1588371064.0,"Basically, charge quantization  along with energy quantization and angular momentum quantization is what forms the basis of quantum mechanics, which is notoriously complicated (this is super oversimplified, but the original comment was really just a joke anyways)."
physicsmemes,fp755b4,t3_gbip1m,1588364234.0,Can we all just agree that physics would be so much easier if charge wasn't quantized?
csMajors,fp6e9w2,t1_fp6d0oe,1588350845.0,"Oh, I completely misread your comment. Nvm then"
csMajors,fp62ya0,t1_fp3vqrw,1588345075.0,"Actually, there's both. Early decision is when you apply to a college early and if they accept you, you HAVE to go there (the exception to this if you can't afford it. They do allow you to see what their financial aid offer is and you can refuse if it's not enough). 

And then there's Early Action where you just apply early and get the decision early without any binding contract forcing you to attend.

There is also something called ""restrictive early action "" which is like the preciously mentioned early action with the caveat that you can't apply early action or decision to any other colleges (many colleges shared early applied information to see if students abide by the rule)"
berkeley,fowuu4j,t1_fowuacw,1588127630.0,Thank you so much for the detailed response! This makes all your other comments much clearer now!
berkeley,fowtuwl,t1_fowpxrb,1588127028.0,"I'm sorry if this was mentioned before, but can you please explain what a ""connectivity graph"" is? This post has been incredibly informative and I really want to get as much out of this discussion as I can."
berkeley,fov6ih8,t1_fov5q2w,1588096180.0,"The 5 series goes into more depth than the 7 series and I feel like I get a lot out of that extra depth. For example, in the end of 5A, there is a unit on Einstein's special Relativity, which is not in 7A, and it was that unit on special Relativity that made me realize I wanted to pursue physics. I'm sure the 7 series is fantastic, but I want to really challenge myself and learn the most I can."
berkeley,fov5afd,t1_fov4bq9,1588095610.0,"I know 7C can fill the requirement, but I am dead set on doing the 5 series. I think I'll just do 61c in the fall and I'll do EECS 16B in the spring."
berkeley,fot45uk,t1_fot3uqf,1588044243.0,"Okay, thanks for the advice"
berkeley,fot3k8o,t1_fot385j,1588043858.0,"Okay, thanks for the advice, that's definitely important to know. Do you know where to check if alternative final times are offered?"
berkeley,fop0as3,t3_g8ppur,1587950263.0,"I've only been at Berkeley for a year and I'm only an intended math major, but there are a few questions of yours I can answer. From what I've experienced, the student culture is really welcoming and not competitive at all. There is a math club called MUSA (Mathematics undergraduate student organization) which from what I've heard is a really great place to meet fellow math majors and just hangout.

Btw, please take everything I say with a grain of salt. I have only taken two math classes at Cal so far and I'm not that invested in the field, so this may not be the most accurate description of the department."
berkeley,fon795r,t3_g8bknl,1587913763.0,"I'm taking 61a this spring so hopefully my perspective helps. I found most of the homeworks pretty easy, but even for me homework 5 was a bitch. Everyone I talked to struggled on it. I think it might have just been an exceptionally hard homework. Homework 6 was much easier imo. Good luck with the rest of the class!"
Israel,fnic79e,t1_fnia0qz,1586977529.0,"Hmm, interesting. Thanks for the help. I guess this source might be a dead end then."
berkeley,fne1vwe,t1_fne0rwv,1586881593.0,"Oh wow, okay. Hopefully my situation is similar"
berkeley,fn0sni2,t1_fn0sg6a,1586547978.0,"Oh, that makes sense. But as long as you can manage your time and ensure that it doesn't impact your job performance, I don't see why they would care."
berkeley,fn0sh13,t1_fn0scdf,1586547883.0,"Yeah, if money is an issue, then this isn't a great solution. But I don't remember what the exact price for one class is, so I would recommend you at least look into it."
berkeley,fn0rg0t,t3_fymtjq,1586547331.0,"If you're already planning on studying for 61A during the summer, I would recommend actually taking 61A during the summer session. The whole class will be online so you will be able to do the whole thing from home and you'll enter Berkeley having already taken one of your major requirements.

Edit: btw, you can sign up for the class at any point until the start of the summer session (which in in mid-June if I remember correctly)"
SandersForPresident,fjf61vv,t3_fd4dgu,1583285071.0,Is that Yiddish?
