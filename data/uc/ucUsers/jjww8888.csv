berkeley,fpig551,t3_gdi2nx,1588640215.0,"In a similar situation right now - I can not take the final and still get an A in the class. Since I also have a Math 53 final, I'm mostly putting my effort on that to ensure I get an A in that as well. I'd say if you don't have anything better to do, then sure, go for the A+ (studying and reviewing that material is useful anyways), but prioritize other classes first if you do have any others."

berkeley,fommhqp,t3_g894a1,1587895672.0,"I'm in the class right now and I have to say, the grade bins are pretty crazy, especially taking into account how the class has been going on so far and how Midterm 2 was graded.

First, consider how our MT2 was graded. For our MT2, the test was held such that a bit less than half the credit came from entering the answers on WebWork. The other half of the credit came from submitting the written work. The issue with submitting on WebWork (other than the fact that some people had to retake several times due to us constantly crashing the servers) was that there was no partial credit. So essentially, if you made a small arithmetic mistake on the first part of one question and your error carried over, you would've lost around 8% of your overall test grade from WebWork and a few more percent of the written credit. Under this new grade bin, it would mean that that small error would've brought you from the A+ bin to the B bin. Coupled with the fact that MT2 was timed the same amount as usual, but with no additional time to scan in the written work (essentially getting less time to work on it than usual), it was challenging.

Second, the new grade bins represent a significant shift from the grade bins on MT1 (90% for an A, 86% for an A-, 81% for a B+, 74% for a B). Based on the fact that class is usually curved to a B, it would hint that the average on MT1 was likely a high C+ - which makes a 95% raw grade for an A kind of hard to believe. This class has so far had a ton of homework assignments, which we were hoping would help boost our overall grade in the class. Every week, on average we have 30 WebWork problems due online, 1 homework to scan in, 2 in-lecture mini-quizzes to scan in, as well as a weekly section quiz. But with this anticurve, it's basically like the class having no curve at all given you got full credit on all the assignments.

So far, the professor and the course staff have been very helpful and considerate (answering questions on Piazza extremely quickly, being very flexible with the technical difficulties of MT2, etc.), so I have to give them props for that. At the moment, it almost feels like that the new bins are like a punishment for people trying to take it for a letter grade. I'm hoping they will reconsider the grade bins."
ApplyingToCollege,fo697bi,t3_g5u4h3,1587551270.0,"Congratulations on getting into Berkeley! I'm currently a freshman studying CS here and I'd definitely recommend picking Cal over Riverside.

1. I'd say Berkeley is very competitive, but I wouldn't call it cutthroat (at least for CS majors). Yes, CS (and just about any popular major here) is extremely competitive due to the large amounts of people and somewhat limited resources (CS clubs here have a sub-2% acceptance rate, classes have extremely hard tests and not particularly great curves - based on just looking around, our lower-div CS tests seem to even be harder than the equivalents at MIT and Stanford). However, it's not cutthroat. By that, I mean most people form their own study groups and are helpful towards one another. If you put in the effort, it feels very rewarding and you will learn a lot. You will notice that the projects you do in your CS classes are well-designed and improve your coding abilities, the homework and labs you do prepare you well for coding interviews. There is a 3.3 declaration GPA requirement, but around 50% make it and I'd say if you prepare a bit over summer and put in your full effort, declaring shouldn't be too bad

2. In terms of dangerousness, I'd say the amount of crime here really isn't much different than any other school in an urban area of the US. The most common crime here is property theft - don't have your laptop out in any of the public cafes off-campus and you've already avoided half the crime here. Obviously, if you are walking around late at night, there are some sketchy characters around, but it's really not that different from any other urban, college town.

&#x200B;

3. You are right on this one - Berkeley housing is extremely expensive. Even as a Bay Area native, Berkeley rents is still a bit scary. Our group of 4 (me and 3 friends) were planning to sign a lease on 2 bedroom apartment before this epidemic - nice, newish building decently close to campus, but nothing extraordinary: $4800 per month. Another group of friends signed a lease for a 3 bed: $6000 per month. That said, if you can afford the cost of living in the dorms, outside housing can only be cheaper or same cost (if you are planning to live in a nicer new building like us). $4800 for a 2 bed divided among 4 people comes out to $1200 per month per person, or $13200 per year. Not as crazy if you think about it that way, especially compared to how expensive dorms are in general.
