ucr,fpksdlj,t3_gdlazq,1588700205.0,I can echo the same things that the others have said about UCR. It's honestly what you make of it and whether you take the initiative to advocate for yourself. But another point that should be brought up when you apply to college is whether UCR has the resources that can support your career passions/dreams.
ucr,fpimqdy,t3_gdo7r3,1588644136.0,"The best way to find out is to contact your major advisor. No one here on the Reddit can really answer that (unless they share the same major as you) because it depends between schools/majors whether they would accept your S (pass) credit to satisfy major requirements. Best of luck though! 

\^\^That is also part of the reason why some people are asking for changes to the  P/NP system. As of now, it is really dependent on your school/major whether they want to accept you P credit as completion of your major requirements."

ucr,fpezxo8,t3_gd1mh1,1588558606.0,It depends on your status whether you're an independent or dependent on FAFSA AND what your EFC was.
ucr,fpezuv8,t3_gd2yzq,1588558558.0,"Honestly, it is up to you whether you want to do it. Just make sure that there aren't any upper-division courses + other related courses that needs you to finish some level of physics before taking it. (NOTE: Not a Biology major specifically but a Biochemistry major)"
ucr,fpb43vw,t1_fpb3hiw,1588461697.0,"Since I'm at UCR not UCSD, I can tell you only what I know about UCR's resources.  

1. If you do choose to go to UCSD, you will not be able to take advantage of the Thomas Haider's program + Early Assurance Program. (You can read more about it on UCR's School of Medicine website)

2. There are a couple of programs/hospitals/clinics in the area that allows students to gain clinical/volunteer experiences. Examples include Future Physician Leaders program + other UCR SOM (School of Medicine) Pipeline programs that you can search up. Outside programs include COPE Health Scholars, regular volunteering at nearby hospitals (Riverside Community Hospital, Kaiser, etc). There is also a couple of Free Clinics that are affiliated with UCR SOM."

ucr,fpazrqf,t1_fp8dqbs,1588459113.0,Are you considered as an independent? I have heard that students who are considered independents on FAFSA will receive more money.
ucr,fp6vm4g,t3_gbcuq3,1588359356.0,"I currently lived in older Glen Mor and have seen my friend's apartment in new Glen Mor. I think the most significant changes is probably the layout of the kitchen (new Glen Mor has those open shelves while in old Glen Mor, the shelves all have doors). Furniture is different for both the commons (""living room area"") and your bedroom. You have more closet space in old Glen Mor though."
ucr,foxb0zn,t3_ga3lhx,1588138707.0,Highlander 150. It is cheaper and plus you most likely won't be able to finish the meal swipes (if you're like most kids).
ucr,foin6s7,t1_fogk5wi,1587791033.0,"Well, the school should be adjusting their financial aid packages to reflect their current housing status. Right now, it is a bit weird since a lot of people are ""at home"" but they are considered to be ""living off-campus."" For your friend, it is strange that this happened unless they are telling you the incorrect information. You might want to double-check and see if that is actually on their account. Plus, there are other factors that come into play when dealing with financial aid that you may not have talked about in your friend's case."

ucr,fnxabkq,t1_fnx9fc2,1587334613.0,"Well, it depends on the score that you received for your Calculus BC exam, I think. Make sure to check the website to see what credit you specifically receive for your score. At least for your major, I don't think that you have to take biochemistry. For medical school?, I think it would vary between different schools so you should do your own research for that. (I am not a pre-med! :) but I am a CNAS major)"
ucr,fnx7xwc,t3_g4fwp9,1587333257.0,"Since you're pre-med, you will be pretty much taking the same courses that a biology major (other related bio majors in CNAS) will be taking. Hate to break it to you but the order that you have those subjects may not work out, because many of these courses are prerequisites for the other courses + some courses are only offered during parts of the year. Just be careful and cautious when planning out your schedule (since you're an economics major).

For example, if you look at the prerequisites for biochemistry, you will need to have at least completed BIOL 005A before you can enroll in BCH 110A or BCH 100, so you would need to have completed BIOL 005A before your third year/summer before to take biochemistry in your 3rd year. 

In addition with your plan, are you at the required math levels to take general chemistry or physics?"

ucr,fnq32rc,t3_g39heb,1587156750.0,UCR might have adjusted your financial aid award to account for the fact that you are living at home now (off-campus).
ucr,fnig9l8,t3_g1xnef,1586979481.0,"It depends on what your financial aid package looks like now. If you receive Regents/Chancellor, that's an honorarium and I think that UCR has to give you that set amount every year. If you receive UCR grant, they are able to adjust that amount of that award to fit COA for people who live off-campus."
ucr,fnfi7cw,t3_g1gnaf,1586908532.0,"Even if you have priority registration (for fall 2020 registration at least), you will be registering AFTER the UCR continuing students have registered for their courses, so there most likely will not be any general seats left in your major courses for Fall 2020. It makes it easier for you to get your classes using reserved seating (downside is that you can't choose professor) and it is also a good way to make friends in the same majors. However, once you officially start to enroll + register for winter 2021, then you will probably enroll even earlier than most students (you're part of the priority registration group so you will register on the first day that registration opens) so you will have access to those general seats. It's more stressful on you though since you need to make sure to build your schedule in a way that allows you to get your major classes done. Either way, you don't really have much to lose if you join an LC or not."
ucr,fmwpok2,t3_fxvf0x,1586450824.0,Money is being refunded back to students who canceled their housing contracts but their financial aid budget has been adjusted to indicate that they are no longer living on-campus anymore.

ucr,fmd4vl7,t3_fujkp2,1585959378.0,"The amount of aid that UCI gives you (UCI grant vs UCR grant specifically) is up to their discretion. :) But since your EFC is so low, it should be around the same amount. (Just my two cents though)"
