ApplyingToCollege,fo47rgh,t1_fo44ftr,1587499648.0,"i eliminated most factors to give state school grads the benefit of the doubt. if we were to consider internships, networking opportunities, and proximity ( which most flagship state schools don't have ) , you're left with an enormous amount of missed chances that most students at elite schools have already taken. 

and then there's the issue of whether they're as qualified. you'll indubitably find that kids who come from already-prestigious schools proved their utility by attending said school; we aren't talking about the absolute minority population of state school grads who were already exceptional enough to compete with t20 grads. 

you can't equate the sheer existence of remarkable (<1% btw) students at a state school to kids who have already proven their worth. that's the NORM at an elite school. 

honestly, i know that you're known for always being kind and telling people ok this subreddit what they want to hear, but this is an argument you just can't really make."
