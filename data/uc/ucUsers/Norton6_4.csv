UCSD,folsoh1,t1_folrmdn,1587869553.0,He's godsend. Had him in all my Data Science lower divisions so far
UCSD,folrfrg,t1_foix2co,1587868727.0,I think I know this one. Is this Siddharth Saha?
UCSD,fo7aqz3,t1_fo643g6,1587575146.0,Tbf this class is one of the most if not the most important class in our department. It is the baseline for any internship we would want to do and so I really don't blame the professor for going to this extreme
UCSD,fnrkkuf,t1_fno1ihk,1587191928.0,Well in regular quarters even if you add at the end of the 2nd week you are expected to have completed the coursework up to then. The professor is being completely reasonable here. The add deadline was extended so that students could get a better idea of that course fits their schedule (and not drop out early/make a decision too early that can't be changed later). I don't see why the professor should be willing to accommodate someone who was trying to decide whether they should take the class or not for 3 weeks without doing any work assigned in that period.
UCSD,fn18jlm,t1_fn16ziw,1586556923.0,Thanks for the update! I just have a couple of upper divs to take but the one I am most concerned about was a cse class as those are usually high in demand. I guess I'll just wait and watch. Thanks again!
UCSD,fn0un50,t1_fn0svo8,1586549064.0,Ah thanks for this information! Is it April 14th morning or sometime afternoon/evening? Also if this was a regular quarter I would probably not be worried but with everything moving online I fear a lot more people would be opting to take those classes
UCSD,fn0ujc6,t1_fn0ssyq,1586549006.0,I was taking about the information on when do registrations for each year begin. Mine is on April 15th for example and I am not sure how many people would have an opportunity before me. If I know what time each level gets to enroll I will have a better idea
UCSD,fmxgnw0,t1_fmxexnx,1586464637.0,Moreso I hope they expand the number of seats in some classes
UCSD,fmx6e9d,t1_fmx5rak,1586459291.0,But wasn't the reason because this quarter was something completely unforeseen. Moreover summer session is optional for a lot of people (moreso than regular quarters). I don't see any reason why after an experience of a whole quarter they would extend those lenient policies into an optional quarter
UCSD,fmx38ls,t3_fxvh19,1586457675.0,Do you think the P/NP allowances(in both major and college sequences) will extend into summer as well?
UCSD,fakwh10,t1_fakt8ib,1576174287.0,It would become much more manageable. Any reason you took 180A over 183?
