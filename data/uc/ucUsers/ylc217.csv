berkeley,fotgn8v,t1_fotgfdi,1588053364.0,my floor was all quads and everyone seemed to get along really well with their roommates! Wishing you luck (:
berkeley,fotc9wi,t3_g9evz4,1588049864.0,Hi! I was in a quad with two chosen and one random and we all got along very well! I consider them to be my best friends (:
berkeley,fotc43q,t3_g9gr14,1588049742.0,Hi! I was in Clark Kerr and really liked that it was away from campus and very quiet. I personally did not enjoy the dining hall but that’s because their vegetarian options sucked lol
berkeley,fosyuu2,t1_fosy0k8,1588040941.0,hi! i am a returning student and did not ask about whether or not the same is true for incoming students. Sorry about that!
berkeley,foslsk6,t1_forikx1,1588033239.0,"I did not get an A in the course, but many people did. I really struggled with this class and my GSI didn’t speak english very well which made it difficult to get help from him. Just make sure you have a good GSI and you should be fine!"
berkeley,for7h7i,t1_for79v7,1588007477.0,If I remember correctly you should be able to before the housing deadline. I believe we added our third roommate after we submitted!
berkeley,for68hy,t3_g8zh6s,1588006872.0,"hi OP! i took 16a with no calc background and passed the class. Make sure you go to the tutoring center, office hours, and sign up for the adjunct course if there is one. You got this!"
berkeley,for5z4t,t3_g94kkz,1588006745.0,you can add someone through the housing portal of i remember correctly!
berkeley,for5vc6,t1_foq074y,1588006694.0,I was offering the advice I could give and what resources I am aware of based off of my experience at cal ((: hopefully OP gets something out of it
berkeley,fopx9o8,t1_fopwz0j,1587975243.0,i was trying to show through example how much less the actual cost vs the predicted cost is. but i guess that’s of not help to you. getting a work study job helps if that is something you qualify for (most on campus jobs require work study). RA fully covers your housing cost but it is very competitive! loans are also always an option
berkeley,fopuy0d,t3_g8tzdr,1587972980.0,"hi! usually the price they give you is much more expensive. I’m in state and the estimated price for me is around 37k. however, i was awarded around 25k i’m scholarships and that basically coveted me i just had to pay around 2k directly to the school out of pocket for one year! my books and stuff were also no more than $200 each semester. hope this helps (:"

berkeley,fnwjrl8,t3_g3uqbt,1587319712.0,Hello! I was in the same situation. I was set on Davis and then got into Berkeley. It wasn’t till I visited both campuses that I realized I did not like Davis at all (which is kinda sad because it was my dream school since freshman year!) and ended up going with Berkeley and I love it! I know it’s hard to go visit campuses with everything going on but try doing virtual tours of both schools.
