berkeley,fpjpv2a,t3_gduk5a,1588677361.0,"It’s been a lot for his friends and those that knew him. I knew him personally, albeit at a distance and mostly through others. He truly was a larger than life personality with so much ahead of him and behind. This weekend was rough for a lot of people, but through it all I think it’s important to remember how much impact he made in what little time he had. I’d like to leave you with this comment from a coworker of his: 

> The first time I met Courtney, it was on a call to convince him to join Twitter. He opened with ""Hi, nice to meet you. Here's the 4 tech companies that I would never work for. How is Twitter different from them?"" I was simultaneously amused and impressed. 

We lost a thoughtful person, and a would-be leader. I understand."

berkeley,fpilde5,t3_gdoqrp,1588643318.0,"Yes it is possible, and oftentimes likely, to be rejected for URAP (this varies significantly among research projects, however). From what I can tell it's better to try for research as an underclassman, and  your GPA will largely define your chances as an upperclassman."
berkeley,fphpou6,t1_fphpi3c,1588625525.0,"Yeah, his last tweet wasn’t too long before he was shot walking in the city. Rest in peace, Courtney."

berkeley,fpfyty8,t3_gd7yrx,1588588612.0,"Hey! Transfer here, more than willing to answer your questions about the school but not so much about the College of Chemistry. I will say that, for chemistry, Berkeley is the right choice academically and not only because of prestige.

That being said, I'd argue that an intense amount of transfer-specific organizations is not necessarily conducive a good transfer experience. For me, the campus transfer center, our student government, and campus housing were all enough in helping me adjust and meet others--what has really defined my Berkeley experience, however, has been being able to immediately join the campus in other ways. Professional clubs, research (for CoC, this will be important), and social clubs have all welcomed me and done more for my time in college than I think any other choice I had (as a political econ major that got into  SD, LA, and SC as well). I recommend thinking about how you can add to the total campus rather than the transfer cohort. :)

Feel free to reach out, and after all is said and done, and you still don't think Berkeley is the right choice, you don't have to chose it! It's okay to follow your gut and regardless of the program you'll be alright!"
berkeley,fparf5u,t1_fpani42,1588454145.0,I stumbled upon it in [this Atlantic article ](https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.theatlantic.com/amp/photo/557663/)! For historical photos I recommend checking out @CalBearsHistory on Twitter or [Calisphere](https://calisphere.org).

berkeley,fp9gzxz,t3_gc6da4,1588425944.0,"Hey bears! Been a while since I posted, but with my undergrad coming to an end and quarantine in full swing, felt like sharing this photo!

The 1918 flu pandemic infected about a third of the world’s population at the time and killed upwards of fifty million people. Berkeley administrators took it upon themselves to recommend all activities on and off campus be outdoors if possible, to avoid too many crowded gatherings. Plenty of spaces around the city were converted to temporary medical centers, including a few fraternities (Zeta Psi being the largest of them, whose original house is now an annex to the Berkeley Law building facing Wurster). 

Best of luck on finals, and stay healthy!"
berkeley,fp9clp0,t3_gb2dt7,1588422356.0,"Go where your heart takes you! It’s okay to want to prioritize student life at LA more than alumni outcome at Berkeley; not everyone is fit for this campus, nothing wrong with your preferences."
berkeley,fp9btkt,t3_gb8bmn,1588421645.0,"Please trust me when I say that Berkeley was the right choice, especially academically, and that you bloom where you are planted; little, flashy things about others’ experiences at different colleges don’t change your own (Berkeley is, well, Berkeley for a reason). You’ll thrive here if you give yourself the chance, and don’t be so hard on yourself either!

I love the history—learning about all the faculty and alumni, as well as changes made to campus; the location—Berkeley’s nature and the ability to visit SF whenever you want (free transit there and back); the community—people from all over the world, all backgrounds; the campus—a bit funky at first, the campus itself is truly the prettiest when you think about just how many different libraries, groves, etc. we have; the academics—some of the worlds leading professors and Nobel laureates all under one roof!"
