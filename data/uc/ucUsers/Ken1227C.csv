You need to take 3 bio cores and six other 4 units bio courses in order to get a bio minor degree. However, the prerequisites are still reinforced, which means you won’t be able to take most of the upper division courses and 98, 99 since I assume you are not taking Ochem and gen chem. If you are a chem major that’s prob fine, but otherwise the only choice you have is to take 93, 94, 97 and 6 lower division courses. If you are rly considering it you could take some lower division classes as GE and see if you like it."

worldnews,fnwy058,t1_fnwh4o2,1587327670.0,Your cloths and phones are cheap as they are right now because of the human right violation in China under CCP’ regime. Are you personally willing to pay for those cheap labors’ redemption?
worldnews,fnwxm3t,t1_fnwh4o2,1587327450.0,"I just don’t see how this slaughter will happen. Imagine what you suggest actually happen: CCP hit hard but the price of your cloths, phones, furniture, etc. increase by 50% or even more because the labor in lets say US is much higher. Can you imagine what it’ll do to the lower-class people? Also what how many export merchants in those western countries will lose their job? China has the world greatest population and therefore has the greatest market. British started a war for this market! 

Honestly as a Chinese I’m not big fan of CCP but on the other hand it is really that evil?"
worldnews,fnwe1j8,t1_fnvqvez,1587316598.0,Trade war is not one country (or countries)bullying another. It’s called war because it causes casualties on both sides.
