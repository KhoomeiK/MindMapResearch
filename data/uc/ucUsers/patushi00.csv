ucla,fp0xu8r,t3_g6c2ov,1588219384.0,"Does anyone know how likely it is to get off the UCLA waitlist as a transfer student? I have a 3.77 GPA and applied for a Biochemistry major and a list of extracurriculars. Idk if that makes a difference I’d just like to know if I have a good shot of getting admitted or if I should accept my other college options. Also, does anyone know when we will find out for real?"
UCSD,fovlf8h,t3_fi9kzn,1588103303.0,Does anyone know when we will get our UCSD email accounts assigned to us or how they will inform us?
UCSD,foqv3g2,t3_fi9kzn,1588001354.0,"I’m a transfer going into Marshall college. This means I have to take 2 upper division disciplinary breadth courses. With this in mind I just wanted some feedback on which of the following classes are an easy A/easier. This is [the list of classes](https://marshall.ucsd.edu/_files/academics/sigwriting.pdf) I have the option of taking. Again I need two, so anyone who has gone through this before, any feedback would be great."
UCSD,fombioe,t3_g885it,1587884203.0,"This is just like my brain when I start studying. It just talks to itself like “hey, lets get stuff done today!”... “wait, giraffes though.”"
UCSD,fojl99l,t3_fi9kzn,1587823804.0,Just got in as a transfer student for biochemistry/chemistry at Marshall college! Super excited to be apart of the Triton family and continue my education at such an awesome school 🔱!
UCSD,fojkzxv,t1_foieuph,1587823625.0,"Just go with what you’re gut feeling tells you. If it’s your dream school and you think it will make you ultimately happier in the end, then come to UCSD! While it may seem like a lot now, $400 in the long run will be nothing if you made the right move and are happier going to UCSD. Just weigh out your options for a bit before you decide into go all in at UCSD. Remember both schools have pros and cons. SDSU has sports and a lot of social life while UCSD you can find friends and clubs but it’s just not the same environment (more studious). I hope this helped a little bit and good luck deciding!"
UCSD,fojkfws,t3_g7ro69,1587823240.0,Truly enlightening 🙏😂

GlobalTalk,fn7afbq,t3_fxzf9g,1586716448.0,"I’m a student in California and this disease has really made me have to adapt to online classes. I have taken a couple through my educational career, but having all online classes as a biochemistry major poses it’s challenges. Like many I am also faced with the challenges surrounding going to the grocery store, gas station, etc., but something not a lot of individuals can relate to is the emotional toll it has had on me. As a student, I used to be able to be my own self and explore without the constant judgment from my parents but now with the stay at home order I am forced to stay with them. Again, like I am back in high school, I have to abide by their rules and schedule. This includes helping around the house when I have a huge amount of work to do. They do not respect the fact that I am still in school working harder than ever. My situation is nowhere near the worst I understand that, but I think it’s useful to hear many sides of the story surrounding this topic. Thank you and stay safe!"
