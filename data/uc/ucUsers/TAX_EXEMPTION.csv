bose,fo1b3n1,t3_g54pbh,1587429466.0,"I've got both that I regularly use. Honestly, the NC700's noice cancellation is way better than the AirPod Pros, but I use both quite frequently depending on the use case. For any teleconference I use the NC700's because of their background noise cancellation (I've got a loud fan in my room), and whenever I'm doing work (writing or programming) I'll use the NC700 because the over-ear lets me concentrate better. For everything else though (cooking, working out, phone calls where I'm walking around, podcasts, Apple TV) I'll use my AirPods just because they're way lighter and more convenient.

I haven't had any connection issues with my NC700's with my iPhone or Macbook, but I have seen the wonky connection to the app before where you have to force close it. You don't need it open to listen to stuff though so I don't worry about it."
