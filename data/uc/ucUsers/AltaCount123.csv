UCSD,fpjn4qh,t3_gdtzm0,1588674673.0,I love MMW because collectively shitting on it with other ERC students is a bonding experience. Other than that it hasn't really made any impact on me.

UCSD,fpi9qhr,t1_fphzi0r,1588636490.0,"Yeah I get what you mean, it's kinda weird how our brains work that way. Like if you think about it if you pay $100 and never go it's essentially the same thing as paying $100 for a closed gym, either way you're paying for an unused service. But then when one option offers the ability to do something it feels a lot more valuable, even if you never actually do it."
UCSD,fph67eb,t1_fpfatv6,1588615674.0,I get that but if you don't go to RIMAC and you've been paying a few quarters then isn't it the same thing as if RIMAC had been closed and you'd been charged?
UCSD,fpex7kx,t3_gcn063,1588556906.0,"I feel like a lot of people were fine paying for stuff like RIMAC normally even if they never used the campus fee resources, but now that the campus is supposed to be closed they suddenly want a refund."

UCSD,fpewjps,t1_fpeeyie,1588556490.0,"I think you're taking the post too personally, there's flaws in the arguments but it seems pretty extreme to call the whole thing fake."
UCSD,fpewgk1,t1_fpdn72c,1588556436.0,"lmfao OP has an issue with the majority white/asian population here but is considering going to USC or Cornell, has an issue with the CSE department as a whole despite only having spent a single quarter taking classes, hates the social climate but also never joined major-related orgs to get to know more people with similar interests. It seems like OP is in for a shock at wherever they end up going."

UCSD,fpeupwy,t1_fpeexuj,1588555345.0,"You are the one basing everything around race. You generalize international chinese TAs with interational students, indian TAs with indian students, white male professors with white male students but having the same race as someone else does not mean that both people went through the same experiences or struggles. It's a lot more about the demographics that you grew up in rather than a shared race, if you grew up in a predominantly white area you are going to relate far more to the types of white people you grew up with than a white person growing up in, for example, the predominantly asian parts of the bay area. To say that a white male professor prefers white male students or that an indian TA prefers indian students is an incorrect assumption that you are making and is quite frankly unfair to the students whose individual experiences you are ignoring on account of their racial background."
UCSD,fpc94qn,t1_fpc2w4e,1588491886.0,"If you are in the department then enrolling should be much easier, unless they have to cancel one of the sections for a class. If you have priority enrollment from something else then it should just give you a really early enrollment time, and you (typically) wouldn't even need to waitlist for a class. 

Also to add onto u/gbdude917's comment, if you make the effort to start your assignments earlier then debugging them becomes much easier. I've seen many people starting long homework assignments right before the due date (I'm quite guilty of this myself) and it becomes nearly impossible to finish in the time given. If you try to even just do a bit every day it's way more manageable. I've also tended to have good experiences with staff but overall that can be more subjective."
UCSD,fpc22ha,t1_fpbyqsl,1588485135.0,"CS/CE students get priority in enrolling for cs classes. Classes with priority enrollment have about half their seats open initially for anyone to enroll in, and then everyone else has to waitlist. Then they take people off the waitlist but they give priority to CS/CE students meaning even if you're #1 on the waitlist, if you aren't in those majors they'll pick a CS/CE student behind you first. Then, most of the upper divs are straight up restricted to those majors meaning there's no waitlist priority but nobody else can enroll until classes start."

UCSD,fow41yx,t1_fow1r7q,1588112622.0,"You call UCSD socially dead yet you want to room with ""someone who has no time to waste in doing anything but striving for their goals"". Do you realize that a lot of people who do nothing besides striving towards a goal are not very social?

&nbsp;

You say you want to motivate people and lift them up when they're at their low, but you seem to be making very strong judgements against people when you talk about lazy people ""who can barely scrape the bottom of the barrel for motivation to complete their homework"". I hope you realize that a lot of people you seem to want to motivate are probably in the exact situation of not having motivation or a goal, and you seem to be trying to humiliate them further.

&nbsp;

You're contradicting yourself and it comes off in a very negative way to other people. If you ""would hate to come off this way in real life"" then why do you think people are responding with criticism when you act this way online?"
UCSD,fow04rt,t1_fovol3r,1588110586.0,"hahaha this has to be bait

What makes you think Stanford choosing your roommate for you is any better than you trying to choose one yourself? Also clearly you must have thought you'd be getting a better educational experience by going to UCSD. Are you really so fixated on your living situation that the thought of having to live with someone different from you makes you already regret your college choice? Is that really the most important factor to you in picking where you're going?

It isn't May 1st yet, go enroll at Stanford if that's what you really want."

UCSD,fo0rn6g,t3_g4j7rs,1587418491.0,"Since CSE is capped and CogSci isn't, you could switch to taking CogSci classes while staying in the CSE department. You'd be safety-netting yourself against the possibility that you like CogSci less than CSE and want to switch back."
UCSD,fo0i94h,t1_fo03auv,1587413619.0,"¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯ I often see posts about how hard the grading scales are for MCWP/WCWP and how a significant portion of the class seems to be getting a B- or lower, meanwhile in my MMW sections there's been an overwhelming number of A-/B+ grades with a few higher and a few lower. Also writing about some shit that actually happened seems like an easier task to me than trying to analyze some texts or whatever they do in MCWP."
UCSD,fo00vh1,t3_g4qrzi,1587404121.0,"MMW is tedious, but it's probably one of the easier GE sequences in terms of actual rigor imo (unlike Muir/Warren, which I've heard are hell). You may not consistently get As, but the averages in the classes tend to be around a B/B+ so it shouldn't be too bad. The main issue I had with it was that I found it extremely difficult to try to be interested in the material. The other big GE req is 4 quarters of a foreign language, which if you're not interested in will probably be just as tedious as MMW. I'd say if you start early on your GEs, they won't really impact you that much. Also, since you're a comms major, you may have to take Science and Math GEs since those don't overlap with your major, but I've heard there's some pretty easy classes to get out of each of the two requirements."

UCSD,fn99suo,t3_g0ddl3,1586764603.0,"One time I smoked weed whilst gary gillespie took a piss 5 feet away from me

i sometimes hit my dab pen in the toilet in the cse dungeon between writing code and hating myself. that one time, i blew a fat fucking blinker cloud just as i was wrapping up downstairs. feeling very accomplished for having taken that like a champ and eyes redder than clifford i stepped out of the stall with a little cough. I looked up sheepishly and regretted doing so immediately. I locked eyes with a urinating gary gillespie for a second, and just that second of eye contact with the 5 more of contextual setup made my mind implode. I walked to the sink rapidly, hoping to avoid gary, and i felt his eyes on the back of my head as he jerked his cock one too many times to rid it of any remaining droplets of piss. Then he asked me for some cabbage and we got lit in the cse dungeon. Jk, i managed to escape and live to fight another day, but this encounter will definitely go down as one of the most terrifying events of my life."
