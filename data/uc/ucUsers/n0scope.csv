I didn't want to wait to have it replaced, since it seemed quite serious (although I should have asked a local shop to do it)"

oculusnsfw,fohefm1,t3_g7abnv,1587764564.0,"I feel like if theres lack of content because of covid19, studios should instead look to remaster some of their older scenes, like what VRHush, and Wankz has been doing.

Its a great way to push out content in times like these and to keep a strong following.

Oh how I would love to revisit some of my old favorites with newly encoded technology. It's a huge difference."
oculusnsfw,fo5ptgk,t3_g5tvoy,1587532020.0,"I always thought the popular choice was DeoVR, never used Skybox.

To those that prefer Skybox, what are some of the better features it has?

I'd love to try it myself but I don't have access to a headset atm."

oculusnsfw,fnw78lx,t3_g4a8oa,1587312825.0,"Off topic, but as someone who likes to trip and do vr, this type of idea sounded very interesting to me (making vr videos psychedelic) but this one in particular was poorly executed. Does anyone know of any cool psychedlic compilations? Thanks"
nextdoorasians,fntr5ma,t3_g3on00,1587247142.0,whats her @?
oculusnsfw,fnpng6v,t3_g2pi50,1587148586.0,PLEASE do Trading Up with Lily Lebeau next! She hasn't been in the vr game since forever so a remaster would be perfect!

UCSD,fnnmjfe,t3_g2t2kn,1587095932.0,"Honestly, it's not surprising. Even though Fall starts in late September, they need to make an official decision months *before* that. And I don't think anybody is an expert Corona Virus weather forecaster to predict if this whole thing will be gone by Fall."
UCSD,fn9dr7k,t3_g0e9s7,1586769020.0,"If you need to review 8A, all you need to know is how to do the basics like loops, if/else statements and instance variables/methods. Im sure it can come back to you quickly if you take the time and do it a step at a time.

There are plemty of resouces online such as youtube tutorials, java docs, etc. Don't worry about doing things on python.

As for 8B, it's important that you start early and start often. Imo, the difficulty spike from 8A and 8B was pretty large, especially woards the middle/end of the course. Start studying now and good luck"
