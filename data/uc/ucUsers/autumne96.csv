gradadmissions,fpc1fic,t1_fpc0ryq,1588484580.0,a couple of schools extended their deadlines to May 1 because of the pandemic and since people couldn't visit schools... but the downside is that not majority of the schools follow this and hence some people would already have made a decision by April 15

astrophysics,fo5eael,t1_fo5d0ms,1587523576.0,"To answer your questions, it really depends on the major curriculum of your school. Some schools offer a two-semesters intro to astrophysics courses that you could take during sophomore year (after completing 1-2 semesters of calculus and freshman physics classes). Some schools may not have that and require students to complete multivariable calc, linear algebra and differential equation, along with all lower division physics classes, before allowing majors to take upper division astrophysics classes.

I would assume most, if not all, schools that offer the astrophysics major offer upper division astrophysics classes instead of forcing more upper division physics classes down the students' throats."
astrophysics,fo5ct8d,t3_g5svjh,1587522597.0,"You'd need quite a bit of physics background to fully understand cosmology, stellar physics, planets, black holes, etc. I think that you'd need to be good at E&M to fully understand 90% of black holes (accretion, jets, etc). Most astrophysics major curriculum requires a handful of physics classes too. You can definitely have more astrophysics than physics, but that won't happen until like junior year, until you build the foundation in physics you need. 

Source: graduated as an astrophysics and physics double major. While I won't need to do as many physics classes as I did had I majored only in astro, I feel that stat mech had really helped me understand stellar physics and cosmology a lot better.  While I am also very intrigued by black holes, I am never going to go near E&M ever again, unless absolutely necessary. Besides, if you are planning to go to grad school, an astro major who completed more upper division physics classes will be more competitive than one who did not."

gradadmissions,fo1bfvp,t1_fo19hsc,1587429669.0,"I was in a similar situation with one of the schools I applied to.

Initially, my application was considered incomplete because of a glitch in their application portal. Emailed the person-in-charge about the issue but I got no response at all. Called the person up only to reach the voicemail, left a message and he/she finally replied to my email and sorted the issue. I was **promised** that my application will get equal consideration as everyone else (as the school had already made some offers by the time the person responded to me). As the decision deadline crept nearer, I emailed to ask for updates since I didn't get anything - no response as well. It was only until April 14 that the school sent generic email to check the website (for a rejection mail).

I thought that was really inconsiderate, if I was on a waitlist, it won't hurt to let me know. If I was on the reject pile, I would appreciate knowing it earlier rather than a day before the decision deadline. I was very close to emailing them to demand my application fee back, had they not provide me an update by April 15 (in hindsight, given their track record, they might just ignore my email lol).

I feel like there should be a rule in place to make sure schools provide an update to applicants like at least 1-2 weeks before the April 15 deadline. I understand that while some schools  work differently in sending out offers, I stand by the opinion that emailing students about their application status 1-2 weeks before Apr 15 is not **that difficult.**"
gradadmissions,fo15bb9,t3_g51f8p,1587426051.0,"I feel that if some schools aren't able to reply to students before decision deadline, they should either let the students know that the pandemic situation has slowed them down, or just refund the horribly expensive application fee (especially for those who got zero updates on their applications since submitting in Dec/Jan until now). It is unfair to keep applicants waiting for updates even beyond the usual decision deadline."
gradadmissions,fnymcej,t1_fnxk2ij,1587367673.0,"For grad classes that are usually smaller in size, I sure do hope that in-person classes can still be held with adequate social distancing in class as well as hygiene and prevention measures. Some classes are just not ideal to be conducted online... 

I was thinking about deferring too, but I would probably have to move back to my home country and I very much prefer having a stable monthly stipend instead of sitting duck waiting for it to be over.  So, I might not defer.

On the other hand, if classes were going to be held online, I would rather move home too, since TA-ing and doing research online are actually possible for my case (only issue is just timezone difference of 13/14 hours). That way, I could save on rent and help my family out financially, since my family's business isn't considered essential and hence has been closed for the past month. But then again, I really want to be able to enjoy fully a grad class as an incoming grad student and have in-person meetings with potential advisors :("

gradadmissions,fnuj094,t1_fnui5xr,1587263238.0,"Same. I'm a person who over-plans and needs to prepare all the contingency plans that I may need for all the situations that may or may not arise. However, this situation has totally thrown me off and we literally have so little control over any major decision that would really impact us :/ 

It's so stressful having no idea if I should or should not move halfway across the country. Housing would also go quickly if I don't make a decision soon. I would lose my deposit if I were to cancel my lease if classes turn out to be online. (I want to be home if classes were online, as I am likely able to TA and do research remotely - less expenses and I could help out my family using my grad student stipend). I really hate being in this situation ugh."
gradadmissions,fntvql8,t1_fnsxkss,1587249516.0,"Same! I never got a chance to visit the school I will be attending because the campus started to restrict off-campus visitors 3 days before the supposed visit and thus, the visits were all cancelled. I really like the flexibility of online classes, but at the same time, I feel that grad classes are just not structured to be taken online and it is just not ideal to learn via a screen :( I wish some schools could either make the decision of moving online earlier and stick with it (so students could make plans about housing) or have in-person classes with adequate social distancing, self-hygiene and prevention measures."
gradadmissions,fntvb3i,t3_g3qlu9,1587249281.0,"I'm in a very similar boat as you! I graduated in Dec and I'm having a gap semester right now and I am so undisciplined with no endless deadlines to chase after. I literally sent an email to the faculty at the program I will be attending to ask about some of the questions you just mentioned! 

At this point, nobody knows if classes would be online or in-person for my school and this is incredibly difficult as I don't know if I should sign a lease for an apartment and if I could cancel the lease if classes were to be online. I would have to move halfway across the country for grad school, but if classes were to be online instead, I would very much prefer to spend the semester back at my home country instead of at a foreign land :/ Also, I heard that some schools allow cancellations for on-campus housing if classes were to be online for the fall, so you might want to look into that and see if that is an option at your school."

astrophysics,fn81tqc,t1_fn6n5mv,1586732131.0,"Did my undergrad in astrophysics and physics at UC Berkeley, but will not recommend anyone to come here for astro. It is going downhill and faculty are not realizing that some of them are the problem. This is the case for lots of established departments - they love sticking with the old ways that no longer work, instead of keeping up with the times.

Granted, the classes here are rigorous and really prepare you for grad school (though can really tank your GPA at times), and that there are lots of resources available. It is also easy for anyone to get lost in the sea of students and it is a very swim-or-sink situation here. 

However, research-wise, it is not easy to find professors who want to take in students, except for 2-3 of them who actually love to mentor undergrads. Most people here end up working with postdocs and they usually have less of an edge when it comes to applying for grad school (as letters from postdocs cannot triumphs people from other schools who work with professors who has more reputation). Feel free to PM me if you want to know more."
