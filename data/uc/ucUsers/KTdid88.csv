UCSantaBarbara,fpmmkp7,t1_fpmlelw,1588736428.0,I would actually say the fact that it’s online makes it less likely. A lot of people register for summer and then drop because they choose not to stick around campus or take on an internship. I anticipate less of that since students can opt to register and still save money by not needing to be in IV.
UCSantaBarbara,fpmmgba,t3_gebkbo,1588736347.0,Depends on the class and your spot in the waitlist.
UCSantaBarbara,fpmme7y,t1_fpmj07n,1588736308.0,Curious which school you would be looking to transfer to? I imagine most are in the same situation UCSB is.
UCSantaBarbara,fpmj6us,t3_ge9gfm,1588734243.0,"Yes, that means credit for the pre-req class needs to be earned but a specific grade isn't expected. P will earn you credit so you shouldn't have issues."
UCSantaBarbara,fplfnkf,t1_fpl9cf1,1588711856.0,"Technically they have. Universities won’t be bringing students back for spring, and public k-12 schools mostly end in mid to late May anyways. Even if the plan was to open things back up for July/August all that means is schools can start bringing people back to prep for fall. 
Also I thinks it important to look at “schools” and universities differently. K-12 are technically higher level of importance since that level of education is required by law."

UCSantaBarbara,fpdq682,t3_gclsfh,1588532002.0,"No, once you earn credit (c or better/P) credit can not be earned again and you can’t retake a passing grade unless it’s a class that you can earn units for multiple time (like research units.)"
UCSantaBarbara,fp8i89u,t1_fp8bwol,1588392975.0,"You should look at transfer requirements for campuses you would consider. Most of them Are going to expect you to take lower division math and programming classes as prep. (GEs dont make you a competitive transfer student.)
As someone else said if your goal is to transfer to a campus for CS it might be better to start at a CC where you can actually take math and cs prep. If you want to be at UCSB no matter what then find a backup major and pursue the change for CS for the first few quarters"
UCSantaBarbara,fp8hsd2,t1_fp7arqw,1588392645.0,"You’re going to pay full tuition at UCSB either way (only summer session is charged per unit) so you would be paying UCSB tuition PLUS cc by unit. So no, that’s not a cheaper plan."
UCSantaBarbara,fp7qhm4,t1_fp7q3u8,1588375697.0,"It's varies by individual and class. Definitely not a time to overload yourself since things move much faster. Generally 8-12 units a session is fine (again, depending on the classes you plan to take) which means you could get anywhere from 2-6 classes out of the way if you do session A and B. Though that's a good way to burn out on school. You'll have to map out requirements for a double major so creating a grid with the CS you have remaining, peppered with GEs and the ling requirements will show you how much to expect and you can see if that's a course load you want to take on. Or if you are okay doing summer/graduating after an extra quarter or two."
UCSantaBarbara,fp7lnff,t3_gbrt72,1588372971.0,I don't think there's anyone on campus pursuing both those majors right now. You might be a first! But it's possible. Easier if you are already in CS and plan to add in Ling. You might need summer sessions or some pretty heavy unit quarters to finish in 4 years unless you are well ahead in requirements for your current major.
UCSantaBarbara,fp5c2aw,t1_fp4rc5p,1588323760.0,Where does THAT statistic come from? Because if I had to guesstimate the COE average GPA is somewhere around 3.0
UCSantaBarbara,fp4qww2,t3_gb67da,1588305187.0,Have you tried emailing them? A lot of offices are empty and might not be responding to calls.
UCSantaBarbara,fp4qmqm,t1_fp1dp6t,1588304993.0,Not impossible but. But not a guarantee either. They usually have about 10 seats a year for students to change in and there are definitely more students than that trying to do so. This puts a bit more weight on your gpa in the major related classes like math and physics that they are going to look at.
UCSantaBarbara,fp18ad2,t1_fp17t6d,1588227277.0,The student. If you’re taking an exam and using a website to get the answers you’re cheating. If a faculty wants to put up a trap to catch cheaters they didn’t do anything wrong other than make it easier to find those cheating.
UCSantaBarbara,fozxzwc,t1_fozvh6v,1588198880.0,"I think you might have an easier time getting into the ME courses required to make that change, but maintaining a competitive GPA can be challenging. They are looking at your grades in Math, Physics, and the required ME 14 that you take sophomore year. Additionally that's a department that limits how many students they allow to change in and it's dependent on available cohort seats each year so the number fluctuates."
UCSantaBarbara,foz0qiz,t1_foxlekp,1588182680.0,"Two weeks is a bit. I would resend the original email with just a ""following up on this previous inquiry"" note."
UCSantaBarbara,foyw728,t1_fox6aix,1588180314.0,"This advising just unintentionally directed any incoming CCS or COE student to the L&S course catalog and THAT is why random reddit advising is dangerous. Because an incoming student might not understand that they have different advisors, policies, and course requirements and follow along with this advice for 1-2 quarters before they reach out to anyone and get the right information."
UCSantaBarbara,foyvn9n,t1_foxrbeb,1588180017.0,"Were you accepted as an engineering major anywhere else? If so, you need to strongly consider that campus. The first 3 quarters for most engineering majors are focused on Math/Chemistry/Physics so as a pre-bio major you should be able to get those classes, but getting into engineering specific classes like CS or ENGR 3 is not as easy. There will be 20-100 other students trying to waitlist and do the same thing (depending on the class) and the departments won't be able to offer seats to every non-major trying to take the class. 

The major you're interested in will also determine the difficulty. CS is super popular and tons of people are trying to change in every year- whereas something the ChemE isn't necessarily as popular but students attempting to change in will need to keep their STEM GPA strong to be competitive. Most ENGR departments only have a finite number of seats to fill via change of majors and will take the strongest students over those who barely met the minimum change requirements."
UCSantaBarbara,foykr2r,t1_foxrmzt,1588174284.0,We don’t have official emphasis tracks for the engineering majors
UCSantaBarbara,fowxv0n,t1_fown758,1588129513.0,UC payroll is public. It's a government agency and therefor anyone who is paid by the UC has their annual earnings posted. If you can't google that then I don't know how to help you.
UCSantaBarbara,fowjywf,t1_fowjror,1588121258.0,"I agree, reddit is a great place to come and ask about teaching styles and workloads. Not what to take in your first quarter (because reddit doesn't know how to ask the appropriate leading questions or have access to student files.)"
UCSantaBarbara,fowjbhm,t1_fowixp0,1588120895.0,"That's not necessarily the responsibility of an advisor. If the course was beyond your ability then you could have dropped it or made your own schedule adjustment. You also could have taken a 12 unit quarter. Engineering advisors enroll international students in their required courses and a full course load. Beyond that they can't possibly estimate each individual students course comfort without meeting them. (Also, many STEM majors have a harder time in a humanities GEs over a math or chem class. That's not necessarily specific to international students.)"
UCSantaBarbara,fowi6dw,t1_fowhw24,1588120255.0,"No it's not. Not if you needed units, and an area D (assuming you enrolled in Econ 1.) Thats often a GE with space available at orientation, whereas something like CH ST 1 or MUS 15 fills up within 2 minutes. Was it your preferred topic? Maybe not. But is Econ 1 a valid GE recommendation for someone who needs 12 units? Sure."
UCSantaBarbara,fowhybc,t1_fowfg0r,1588120132.0,"It's a later pass time, but they only open up a specific number of seats for enrollment per orientation session. While some things may fill up quickly, you aren't necessarily at a disadvantaged when registering during non-attending orientation dates. Outside of not having had a prior guided walkthrough of the system and what you should register for before your pass starts. 

I don't know what orientation on campus cost so I can't compare the two."
UCSantaBarbara,fow917c,t3_g9xia3,1588115258.0,"What's the confusion? This is literally how they pay the staff and student peers that work throughout the year/summer to keep the modules moving and coordinated, answer student questions, etc. If freshmen don't want orientation they don't have to pay for it and they can register at the beginning of September with the rest of the students who don't attend orientation. It's not mandatory."
UCSantaBarbara,fow8r5a,t1_fow8h5o,1588115108.0,Getting advised by untrained peers is the fastest way to make scheduling and requirement mistakes. Orientation peers are trained on the curriculums and policy that they are advising on- random volunteers could lead a new freshman completely down the wrong first quarter path.
UCSantaBarbara,fou4f9o,t3_g9ijfb,1588075904.0,"You will get units, they just don’t articulate as the physics classes engineers take. Look at it this way: you’ll be properly prepped for the first physics and chemistry classes you have to take."
UCSantaBarbara,fonb02c,t3_g8bhr4,1587915979.0,"Could it have been pushed into a different letter area? For ex: if it’s E and F is it showing up in the F? Also, be sure you actually did a “run audit with WIP.”

I’ve never personally seen a class originally fulfill an area and then just suddenly not mid quarter."
UCSantaBarbara,fojuaak,t1_foh95oi,1587829526.0,"The “opt in” is whether or not YOUR major department will accept p/np to fulfill a major requirement. It doesn’t matter if a department that you aren’t majoring in but taking a class within doesn’t opt in as long as the class is offered for that option. 

Ex: if Math didn’t opt in (hypothetical because they did) but you were an engineer taking a math class you could choose p/np as long as the option exists in the system. Because ENGR did opt in and will accept that P in your math class.

And since a P means you got a c or higher it should meet most prerequisite minimum grade requirements for future registration purposes. Unless you take any classes that requires higher than a C in which case I’m not sure but that’s pretty unpopular and you probably won’t ever experience that."
UCSantaBarbara,foj5sd4,t1_foikg1u,1587809510.0,Not sure why I’m getting downvoted when this is the policy. A P definitely fulfills prerequisites. Otherwise HOW would every department allow their students to move on with major requirements? Why would you think you could take math 3b P/NP and move on to 4A but not apply the same logic to chem 1B?
UCSantaBarbara,foikg1u,t3_g7kncv,1587788904.0,"If your department has opted in to the p/no policy you can replace the D with a P. If you haven’t exceeded your 16 units of gpa replacing repeats then the impact the D is having will be replaced with the P. Which doesn’t do much since P/NP has 0 impact. It will just be like you earned the credit and the D never happened. 
And a P should clear you of future prerequisites because it indicates you got a C or better in the class. 
A NP will not replace your original grade."
UCSantaBarbara,foik3mw,t3_g7lab0,1587788645.0,"Some things: use assist.org to see what courses your local CCs have and if they cover what you need. Check to see if your CC is semester or quarter. Either way they should be done in time for you to start winter at UCSB. CC grades won’t factor in to your gpa here so if you need to meet certain gpa standards for full major keep that in mind. 
Reach out to a department advisor to ask about the pre-major policy on transferred courses. 
And then if everything lines up cancel fall registration and create a quarter via the application system at your CC. 
And do the readmission application when you’re ready to pick back up here."

UCSantaBarbara,foed082,t1_fode5dz,1587700870.0,"Nobody knows what fall will bring yet, but contingency plans are being put in place in the event it does stay remote. 
Email admissions to ask about deferred enrollment. I’m sure it’s something they will be prepared to answer. 
Whether or not it’s something you should do is totally up to you. If you are ok delaying degree completion by a quarter or two and that’s a valued trade off for in person learning then why not."
UCSantaBarbara,focb16i,t1_foc7gru,1587669206.0,"Then the decision seems to be: accept an admission offer that you've received, ideally at a school that might offer a CS minor or would allow a change later (UCSB offers neither) or continue on at a CC for another year, get the required courses and try to reapply as a different major.

You should reach out to admissions (admissions@sa.ucsb.edu) and see if this path would be recommended- I'm not an admissions officer and don't know all the policies surrounding transfer units and re-applying after a declined admissions offer."
UCSantaBarbara,fobwi75,t3_g6q8mk,1587664442.0,Very much depends on your department. COE has a team dedicated to building relationships between companies and the College for everything from research partnerships w/ labs to internship opportunities for undergrads.
UCSantaBarbara,fobvr4n,t1_foblhrv,1587664203.0,"I suggest using assist.org and see what other CCs might have the courses you are missing. I don't think all of your transfer courses have to come from 1 CC, or even transfer between eachother as long as they all transfer correctly to UCSB. Especially if 1 campus doesn't offer the things you need. 
SBCC, Oxnard, DeAnza, and Foothill all come to mind and might have what you're looking for. 

Unfortunately if you want to be considered for CS at UCSB and you don't meet the minimum transfer requirements right now, the only option is to decline admission, finish the CS transfer requirements you are missing via a CC, and re-apply later. However, there is no guarantee you will be accepted again for a different major or even the one you've currently been admitted into. Once you accept admission into an L&S major as a transfer and start a quarter on our campus you will not be able to be CS at UCSB. 

Were you accepted as CS or preCS at any other campus? That's the most guarantee you have and if your heart is set on that degree you need to go there."
UCSantaBarbara,foaypmk,t1_fo9f8gk,1587654132.0,"I can answer your second question: No. Once you accept a major and matriculate as a transfer at UCSB you won’t be able to change majors into COE, and you can't reapply because you would already be a UC student with a record on campus. The only way to join engr as a transfer is to be accepted directly into that major upon admission.
*Edited to change can to can't. Important distinction."
UCSantaBarbara,fo99f7h,t1_fo8gaae,1587613652.0,Google “UCSB summer sessions” and follow the enrollment steps for new transfers. Then reach out to your new department advisor if needed to find out what might be appropriate to take.
UCSantaBarbara,fo73dc8,t1_fo6su2d,1587571529.0,How about give them a week or two to have meetings and make plans. There's no previously laid guidance for any of this and inundating administration with the same email over and over actually slows down the process and takes away from all the work people are trying to do.
UCSantaBarbara,fo6a1jj,t3_g5w2mq,1587552160.0,"If you can get into cs 8 it might give you an idea if you enjoy programming in the slightest but you can probably find an intro CS course easier via a CC. If you’ve already had to repeat a math class you may have a hard time meeting minimum GPA requirements to actually be in the major (3.0 for math, 3.2 for the 3 CS classes- 1st take only.)

The change of major requirements and FAQS for the department are here:

UCSantaBarbara,fnmbzoz,t1_fnm8wnu,1587068694.0,"Often there aren't any. If you are a student in good academic standing you can take a break and come back whenever it makes sense for you. That might mean waiting until courses you need are offered (say you want to return for Winter but nothing you need is offered until Spring- better to wait for Spring.) Important note: This applies to the academic side- if you are a scholarship or aid recipient you would want to check with a counselor there and see what a couple quarters off would mean for the funding. 

If you wait too long and your department makes a lot of curriculum updates (as in YEARS later) then you might have a bit of a headache figuring out what you need to take to complete your older catalog year. But that's an extreme scenario that is mostly only an issue if you're gone a decade. 

So basically- if you're okay delaying your degree completion in exchange for on-campus quarters and it makes sense financially/ living wise then why not do it? No need to rob yourself of the education you really want or that would most benefit you."

B) Once a student withdraws/ cancels registration for a quarter they have to submit a readmit application with a $70 fee- 30% of the reduction you're fighting for. Is it worth the $130 that remains? I supposed if you use your quarter off to work then it's financially worth your time."
UCSantaBarbara,fnklrn4,t3_g28y4i,1587031932.0,"Official drop deadline is 4/24. Historically L&S has considered students late drop requests through the change of grading deadline, which for spring is the last day of instruction.

Joining campus undeclared, trying to get into the math, physics, CS that you would need for the majors you’re interested is going to be an uphill battle. At the very least you should declare a stem major like stats or physics. The departments also have a cap on how many students they accept each year. So you have to maintain a competitive gpa in all the classes they are looking at. 
Only come here if you’re prepared to have a plan B that you would be happy with.

UCSantaBarbara,fmkrisq,t1_fmkfkzz,1586165811.0,"It really won’t. Every single graduate admissions officer/reviewer will know what was happening in the world in spring 2020. And again: you could earn a B and it’s going to be a P whereas a reviewer might just assume a C and then how is it really benefiting you? It is 100% mental and gpa based and THATS OKAY but the departments who don’t opt in aren’t hindering students in any way of getting their degree. We all have to make decisions that are best for our mental wellbeing and I PROMISE YOU the difference between a c- or a b- will not matter a year, two years, or ten years from now.what I’m saying is let’s stop putting this insane stigma and mental pressure on students over a passing grade. C or A, in the long run nobody in your life will know the difference."
UCSantaBarbara,fmjlqza,t1_fmjj047,1586132867.0,"I’m staff and coming from a perspective of degree completion, which seems to be both of our points. I’m not understanding what you don’t agree with. P/np option is strictly to salvage gpa, nothing else. I’m not against departments extending this option to their students- I’m just wondering how this severely impacts students who are arguing if their departments don’t? All it means is that a P won’t count towards your degree- not necessarily that you can’t NP if the quarter isn’t agreeing with you. If you are earning a P then you got a c or better anyways. If you think you are going to get a D you take the NP and try again regardless. 

My question is: if a C- OR a C would fulfill your degree requirement, why argue to have your P which in actuality was a B count over just taking the B?"
