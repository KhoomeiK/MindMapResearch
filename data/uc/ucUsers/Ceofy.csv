knitting,fog14dt,t3_g76ce5,1587746318.0,"When I was starting, I found it super helpful to try interesting scarves just to learn the pattern and new techniques! I didn't always take the time and the yarn to finish out the whole scarf, but I learned a lot and had a lot of fun. It was good to let go of the pressure to produce items, and just enjoy the process of knitting."

knitting,fnpdosh,t1_fnnqwav,1587143692.0,"I started knitting recently too, and my best advice would be to persevere! Knitting is incredible and intricate, and I take comfort in the fact that following directions on a pattern is not rocket science! While it may take a lot of skill to come up with new patterns, I found that I was capable of making very beautiful, intricate things very quickly, by persevering through reading confusing instructions!"
knitting,fnpd72c,t3_g165py,1587143442.0,"Does anyone have any neat tricks for preventing yarn from sliding off the ends of double pointed needles? I'm making a kerchief on two double pointed needles, and since every row has more stitches than the last row, I'm starting to get a little concerned."

It's a crochet pattern, but I have 2 skeins of this yarn as a gift from a friend and I would love to be able to recreate this, if it's possible to convert the pattern!  


I'm kind of new to knitting and I don't have any crochet experience, so my question is whether it's possible to accomplish this kind of thing with knitting? (I'm quarantined with no crochet needles, sadly)"

fountainpens,fl1mhyi,t3_flvfqa,1584731930.0,"I've always loved writing in cursive, and I remember the moment when I first tried it with a fountain pen and realized what cursive was made for! I just love the beauty, elegance, and utility of fountain pens, and of course the joy they are to write with.

Thank you for brightening everyone's day a little! I've loved reading everyone's reasons for loving fountain pens."
