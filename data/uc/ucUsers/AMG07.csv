I’ve actually been able to be consistent to practice music, learn languages and even get  internships! I do slip up here and there with my work but it has relatively easy to catch up."

Believe me, even if it’s old, it will learn to love you no more than a kitten. And if training is of concern, even if they are older it doesn’t mean they are not capable of learning.
If you are by Chula Vista there’s I think like 5 cats left at the Chula Vista Animal Care Facility."
