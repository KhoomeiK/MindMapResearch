I've been watching this show since the first season, and now I'm on the last. The last season kind of surprised me. I don't know where they're going with the show, but hopefully I get to see how it all plays out. Don't take it too seriously though. It could go a ton of ways: maybe the main antagonist isn't really who he is. I remember he said writers were liars."
